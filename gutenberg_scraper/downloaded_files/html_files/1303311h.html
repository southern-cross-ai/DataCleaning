     WRITTEN</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">Since I came to this place I have been very restless,
  wasting my energies in the futile beginning of ill-conceived books. One does
  not settle down very readily at two and forty to a new way of living, and I
  have found myself with the teeming interests of the life I have abandoned
  still buzzing like a swarm of homeless bees in my head. My mind has been full
  of confused protests and justifications. In any case I should have found
  difficulties enough in expressing the complex thing I have to tell, but it
  has added greatly to my trouble that I have a great analogue, that a certain
  Niccolo Machiavelli chanced to fall out of politics at very much the age I
  have reached, and wrote a book to engage the restlessness of his mind, very
  much as I have wanted to do. He wrote about the relation of the great
  constructive spirit in politics to individual character and weaknesses, and
  so far his achievement lies like a deep rut in the road of my intention. It
  has taken me far astray. It is a matter of many weeks now&mdash;diversified
  indeed by some long drives into the mountains behind us and a memorable sail
  to Genoa across the blue and purple waters that drowned Shelley&mdash;since I
  began a laboured and futile imitation of "The Prince." I sat up late last
  night with the jumbled accumulation; and at last made a little fire of olive
  twigs and burnt it all, sheet by sheet&mdash;to begin again clear this
  morning.</p>

  <p>But incidentally I have re-read most of Machiavelli, not excepting those
  scandalous letters of his to Vettori, and it seems to me, now that I have
  released myself altogether from his literary precedent, that he still has his
  use for me. In spite of his vast prestige I claim kindred with him and set
  his name upon my title-page, in partial intimation of the matter of my story.
  He takes me with sympathy not only by reason of the dream he pursued and the
  humanity of his politics, but by the mixture of his nature. His vices come
  in, essential to my issue. He is dead and gone, all his immediate
  correlations to party and faction have faded to insignificance, leaving only
  on the one hand his broad method and conceptions, and upon the other his
  intimate living personality, exposed down to its salacious corners as the
  soul of no contemporary can ever be exposed. Of those double strands it is I
  have to write, of the subtle protesting perplexing play of instinctive
  passion and desire against too abstract a dream of statesmanship. But things
  that seemed to lie very far apart in Machiavelli's time have come near to one
  another; it is no simple story of white passions struggling against the red
  that I have to tell.</p>

  <p>The state-making dream is a very old dream indeed in the world's history.
  It plays too small a part in novels. Plato and Confucius are but the highest
  of a great host of minds that have had a kindred aspiration, have dreamt of a
  world of men better ordered, happier, finer, securer. They imagined cities
  grown more powerful and peoples made rich and multitudinous by their efforts,
  they thought in terms of harbours and shining navies, great roads engineered
  marvellously, jungles cleared and deserts conquered, the ending of muddle and
  diseases and dirt and misery; the ending of confusions that waste human
  possibilities; they thought of these things with passion and desire as other
  men think of the soft lines and tender beauty of women. Thousands of men
  there are to-day almost mastered by this white passion of statecraft, and in
  nearly every one who reads and thinks you could find, I suspect, some sort of
  answering response. But in every one it presents itself extraordinarily
  entangled and mixed up with other, more intimate things.</p>

  <p>It was so with Machiavelli. I picture him at San Casciano as he lived in
  retirement upon his property after the fall of the Republic, perhaps with a
  twinge of the torture that punished his conspiracy still lurking in his
  limbs. Such twinges could not stop his dreaming. Then it was "The Prince" was
  written. All day he went about his personal affairs, saw homely neighbours,
  dealt with his family, gave vent to everyday passions. He would sit in the
  shop of Donato del Corno gossiping curiously among vicious company, or pace
  the lonely woods of his estate, book in hand, full of bitter meditations. In
  the evening he returned home and went to his study. At the entrance, he says,
  he pulled off his peasant clothes covered with the dust and dirt of that
  immediate life, washed himself, put on his "noble court dress," closed the
  door on the world of toiling and getting, private loving, private hating and
  personal regrets, sat down with a sigh of contentment to those wider
  dreams.</p>

  <p>I like to think of him so, with brown books before him lit by the light of
  candles in silver candlesticks, or heading some new chapter of "The Prince,"
  with a grey quill in his clean fine hand.</p>

  <p>So writing, he becomes a symbol for me, and the less none because of his
  animal humour, his queer indecent side, and because of such lapses into utter
  meanness as that which made him sound the note of the begging-letter writer
  even in his "Dedication," reminding His Magnificence very urgently, as if it
  were the gist of his matter, of the continued malignity of fortune in his
  affairs. These flaws complete him. They are my reason for preferring him as a
  symbol to Plato, of whose indelicate side we know nothing, and whose
  correspondence with Dionysius of Syracuse has perished; or to Confucius who
  travelled China in search of a Prince he might instruct, with lapses and
  indignities now lost in the mists of ages. They have achieved the apotheosis
  of individual forgetfulness, and Plato has the added glory of that acquired
  beauty, that bust of the Indian Bacchus which is now indissolubly mingled
  with his tradition. They have passed into the world of the ideal, and every
  humbug takes his freedoms with their names. But Machiavelli, more recent and
  less popular, is still all human and earthly, a fallen brother&mdash;and at
  the same time that nobly dressed and nobly dreaming writer at the desk.</p>

  <p>That vision of the strengthened and perfected state is protagonist in my
  story. But as I re-read "The Prince" and thought out the manner of my now
  abandoned project, I came to perceive how that stir and whirl of human
  thought one calls by way of embodiment the French Revolution, has altered
  absolutely the approach to such a question. Machiavelli, like Plato and
  Pythagoras and Confucius two hundred odd decades before him, saw only one
  method by which a thinking man, himself not powerful, might do the work of
  state building, and that was by seizing the imagination of a Prince. Directly
  these men turned their thoughts towards realisation, their attitudes
  became&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;secretarial. Machiavelli, it is
  true, had some little doubts about the particular Prince he wanted, whether
  it was Caesar Borgia of Giuliano or Lorenzo, but a Prince it had to be.
  Before I saw clearly the differences of our own time I searched my mind for
  the modern equivalent of a Prince. At various times I redrafted a parallel
  dedication to the Prince of Wales, to the Emperor William, to Mr. Evesham, to
  a certain newspaper proprietor who was once my schoolfellow at City
  Merchants', to Mr. J. D. Rockefeller&mdash;all of them men in their several
  ways and circumstances and possibilities, princely. Yet in every case my pen
  bent of its own accord towards irony because&mdash;because, although at first
  I did not realise it, I myself am just as free to be a prince. The appeal was
  unfair. The old sort of Prince, the old little principality has vanished from
  the world. The commonweal is one man's absolute estate and responsibility no
  more. In Machiavelli's time it was indeed to an extreme degree one man's
  affair. But the days of the Prince who planned and directed and was the
  source and centre of all power are ended. We are in a condition of affairs
  infinitely more complex, in which every prince and statesman is something of
  a servant and every intelligent human being something of a Prince. No
  magnificent pensive Lorenzos remain any more in this world for secretarial
  hopes.</p>

  <p>In a sense it is wonderful how power has vanished, in a sense wonderful
  how it has increased. I sit here, an unarmed discredited man, at a small
  writing-table in a little defenceless dwelling among the vines, and no human
  being can stop my pen except by the deliberate self-immolation of murdering
  me, nor destroy its fruits except by theft and crime. No King, no council,
  can seize and torture me; no Church, no nation silence me. Such powers of
  ruthless and complete suppression have vanished. But that is not because
  power has diminished, but because it has increased and become multitudinous,
  because it has dispersed itself and specialised. It is no longer a negative
  power we have, but positive; we cannot prevent, but we can do. This age, far
  beyond all previous ages, is full of powerful men, men who might, if they had
  the will for it, achieve stupendous things.</p>

  <p>The things that might be done to-day! The things indeed that are being
  done! It is the latter that give one so vast a sense of the former. When I
  think of the progress of physical and mechanical science, of medicine and
  sanitation during the last century, when I measure the increase in general
  education and average efficiency, the power now available for human service,
  the merely physical increment, and compare it with anything that has ever
  been at man's disposal before, and when I think of what a little straggling,
  incidental, undisciplined and uncoordinated minority of inventors,
  experimenters, educators, writers and organisers has achieved this
  development of human possibilities, achieved it in spite of the disregard and
  aimlessness of the huge majority, and the passionate resistance of the active
  dull, my imagination grows giddy with dazzling intimations of the human
  splendours the justly organised state may yet attain. I glimpse for a
  bewildering instant the heights that may be scaled, the splendid enterprises
  made possible.</p>

  <p>But the appeal goes out now in other forms, in a book that catches at
  thousands of readers for the eye of a Prince diffused. It is the old appeal
  indeed for the unification of human effort, the ending of confusions, but
  instead of the Machiavellian deference to a flattered lord, a man cries out
  of his heart to the unseen fellowship about him. The last written dedication
  of all those I burnt last night, was to no single man, but to the socially
  constructive passion&mdash;in any man...</p>

  <p>There is, moreover, a second great difference in kind between my world and
  Machiavelli's. We are discovering women. It is as if they had come across a
  vast interval since his time, into the very chamber of the statesman.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">In Machiavelli's outlook the interest of womanhood was in a
  region of life almost infinitely remote from his statecraft. They were the
  vehicle of children, but only Imperial Rome and the new world of to-day have
  ever had an inkling of the significance that might give them in the state.
  They did their work, he thought, as the ploughed earth bears its crops. Apart
  from their function of fertility they gave a humorous twist to life,
  stimulated worthy men to toil, and wasted the hours of Princes. He left the
  thought of women outside with his other dusty things when he went into his
  study to write, dismissed them from his mind. But our modern world is
  burthened with its sense of the immense, now half articulate, significance of
  women. They stand now, as it were, close beside the silver candlesticks,
  speaking as Machiavelli writes, until he stays his pen and turns to discuss
  his writing with them.</p>

  <p>It is this gradual discovery of sex as a thing collectively portentous
  that I have to mingle with my statecraft if my picture is to be true which
  has turned me at length from a treatise to the telling of my own story. In my
  life I have paralleled very closely the slow realisations that are going on
  in the world about me. I began life ignoring women, they came to me at first
  perplexing and dishonouring; only very slowly and very late in my life and
  after misadventure, did I gauge the power and beauty of the love of man and
  woman and learnt how it must needs frame a justifiable vision of the ordered
  world. Love has brought me to disaster, because my career had been planned
  regardless of its possibility and value. But Machiavelli, it seems to me,
  when he went into his study, left not only the earth of life outside but its
  unsuspected soul.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Like Machiavelli at San Casciano, if I may take this analogy
  one step further, I too am an exile. Office and leading are closed to me. The
  political career that promised so much for me is shattered and ended for
  ever.</p>

  <p>I look out from this vine-wreathed veranda under the branches of a stone
  pine; I see wide and far across a purple valley whose sides are terraced and
  set with houses of pine and ivory, the Gulf of Liguria gleaming sapphire
  blue, and cloud-like baseless mountains hanging in the sky, and I think of
  lank and coaly steamships heaving on the grey rollers of the English Channel
  and darkling streets wet with rain, I recall as if I were back there the busy
  exit from Charing Cross, the cross and the money-changers' offices, the
  splendid grime of giant London and the crowds going perpetually to and fro,
  the lights by night and the urgency and eventfulness of that great rain-swept
  heart of the modern world.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to think we have left that&mdash;for many years if not for
  ever. In thought I walk once more in Palace Yard and hear the clink and
  clatter of hansoms and the quick quiet whirr of motors; I go in vivid recent
  memories through the stir in the lobbies, I sit again at eventful dinners in
  those old dining-rooms like cellars below the House&mdash;dinners that ended
  with shrill division bells, I think of huge clubs swarming and excited by the
  bulletins of that electoral battle that was for me the opening opportunity. I
  see the stencilled names and numbers go up on the green baize, constituency
  after constituency, amidst murmurs or loud shouting...</p>

  <p>It is over for me now and vanished. That opportunity will come no more.
  Very probably you have heard already some crude inaccurate version of our
  story and why I did not take office, and have formed your partial judgement
  on me. And so it is I sit now at my stone table, half out of life already, in
  a warm, large, shadowy leisure, splashed with sunlight and hung with vine
  tendrils, with paper before me to distil such wisdom as I can, as Machiavelli
  in his exile sought to do, from the things I have learnt and felt during the
  career that has ended now in my divorce.</p>

  <p>I climbed high and fast from small beginnings. I had the mind of my party.
  I do not know where I might not have ended, but for this red blaze that came
  out of my unguarded nature and closed my career for ever.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap1_02"
     name="chap1_02"></a>II. &mdash; BROMSTEAD AND MY FATHER</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">I dreamt first of states and cities and political things
  when I was a little boy in knickerbockers.</p>

  <p>When I think of how such things began in my mind, there comes back to me
  the memory of an enormous bleak room with its ceiling going up to heaven and
  its floor covered irregularly with patched and defective oilcloth and a dingy
  mat or so and a "surround" as they call it, of dark stained wood. Here and
  there against the wall are trunks and boxes. There are cupboards on either
  side of the fireplace and bookshelves with books above them, and on the wall
  and rather tattered is a large yellow-varnished geological map of the South
  of England. Over the mantel is a huge lump of white coral rock and several
  big fossil bones, and above that hangs the portrait of a brainy gentleman,
  sliced in half and displaying an interior of intricate detail and much vigour
  of coloring. It is the floor I think of chiefly; over the oilcloth of which,
  assumed to be land, spread towns and villages and forts of wooden bricks;
  there are steep square hills (geologically, volumes of Orr's <i>Cyclopaedia
  of the Sciences</i>) and the cracks and spaces of the floor and the bare
  brown surround were the water channels and open sea of that continent of
  mine.</p>

  <p>I still remember with infinite gratitude the great-uncle to whom I owe my
  bricks. He must have been one of those rare adults who have not forgotten the
  chagrins and dreams of childhood. He was a prosperous west of England
  builder; including my father he had three nephews, and for each of them he
  caused a box of bricks to be made by an out-of-work carpenter, not the
  insufficient supply of the toyshop, you understand, but a really adequate
  quantity of bricks made out of oak and shaped and smoothed, bricks about five
  inches by two and a half by one, and half-bricks and quarter-bricks to
  correspond. There were hundreds of them, many hundreds. I could build six
  towers as high as myself with them, and there seemed quite enough for every
  engineering project I could undertake. I could build whole towns with streets
  and houses and churches and citadels; I could bridge every gap in the
  oilcloth and make causeways over crumpled spaces (which I feigned to be
  morasses), and on a keel of whole bricks it was possible to construct ships
  to push over the high seas to the remotest port in the room. And a
  disciplined population, that rose at last by sedulous begging on birthdays
  and all convenient occasions to well over two hundred, of lead sailors and
  soldiers, horse, foot and artillery, inhabited this world.</p>

  <p>Justice has never been done to bricks and soldiers by those who write
  about toys. The praises of the toy theatre have been a common theme for
  essayists, the planning of the scenes, the painting and cutting out of the
  caste, penny plain twopence coloured, the stink and glory of the performance
  and the final conflagration. I had such a theatre once, but I never loved it
  nor hoped for much from it; my bricks and soldiers were my perpetual drama. I
  recall an incessant variety of interests. There was the mystery and charm of
  the complicated buildings one could make, with long passages and steps and
  windows through which one peeped into their intricacies, and by means of
  slips of card one could make slanting ways in them, and send marbles rolling
  from top to base and thence out into the hold of a waiting ship. Then there
  were the fortresses and gun emplacements and covered ways in which one's
  soldiers went. And there was commerce; the shops and markets and store-rooms
  full of nasturtium seed, thrift seed, lupin beans and suchlike provender from
  the garden; such stuff one stored in match-boxes and pill-boxes, or packed in
  sacks of old glove fingers tied up with thread and sent off by waggons along
  the great military road to the beleaguered fortress on the Indian frontier
  beyond the worn places that were dismal swamps. And there were battles on the
  way.</p>

  <p>That great road is still clear in my memory. I was given, I forget by what
  benefactor, certain particularly fierce red Indians of lead&mdash;I have
  never seen such soldiers since&mdash;and for these my father helped me to
  make tepees of brown paper, and I settled them in a hitherto desolate country
  under the frowning nail-studded cliffs of an ancient trunk. Then I conquered
  them and garrisoned their land. (Alas! they died, no doubt through contact
  with civilisation&mdash;one my mother trod on&mdash;and their land became a
  wilderness again and was ravaged for a time by a clockwork crocodile of vast
  proportions.) And out towards the coal-scuttle was a region near the
  impassable thickets of the ragged hearthrug where lived certain china Zulus
  brandishing spears, and a mountain country of rudely piled bricks concealing
  the most devious and enchanting caves and several mines of gold and silver
  paper. Among these rocks a number of survivors from a Noah's Ark made a
  various, dangerous, albeit frequently invalid and crippled fauna, and I was
  wont to increase the uncultivated wildness of this region further by trees of
  privet-twigs from the garden hedge and box from the garden borders. By these
  territories went my Imperial Road carrying produce to and fro, bridging gaps
  in the oilcloth, tunnelling through Encyclopaedic hills&mdash;one tunnel was
  three volumes long&mdash;defended as occasion required by camps of paper
  tents or brick blockhouses, and ending at last in a magnificently engineered
  ascent to a fortress on the cliffs commanding the Indian reservation.</p>

  <p>My games upon the floor must have spread over several years and developed
  from small beginnings, incorporating now this suggestion and now that. They
  stretch, I suppose, from seven to eleven or twelve. I played them
  intermittently, and they bulk now in the retrospect far more significantly
  than they did at the time. I played them in bursts, and then forgot them for
  long periods; through the spring and summer I was mostly out of doors, and
  school and classes caught me early. And in the retrospect I see them all not
  only magnified and transfigured, but fore-shortened and confused together. A
  clockwork railway, I seem to remember, came and went; one or two clockwork
  boats, toy sailing ships that, being keeled, would do nothing but lie on
  their beam ends on the floor; a detestable lot of cavalrymen, undersized and
  gilt all over, given me by a maiden aunt, and very much what one might expect
  from an aunt, that I used as Nero used his Christians to ornament my public
  buildings; and I finally melted some into fratricidal bullets, and therewith
  blew the rest to flat splashes of lead by means of a brass cannon in the
  garden.</p>

  <p>I find this empire of the floor much more vivid and detailed in my memory
  now than many of the owners of the skirts and legs and boots that went
  gingerly across its territories. Occasionally, alas! they stooped to scrub,
  abolishing in one universal destruction the slow growth of whole days of
  civilised development. I still remember the hatred and disgust of these
  catastrophes. Like Noah I was given warnings. Did I disregard them, coarse
  red hands would descend, plucking garrisons from fortresses and sailors from
  ships, jumbling them up in their wrong boxes, clumsily so that their rifles
  and swords were broken, sweeping the splendid curves of the Imperial Road
  into heaps of ruins, casting the jungle growth of Zululand into the fire.</p>

  <p>"Well, Master Dick," the voice of this cosmic calamity would say, "you
  ought to have put them away last night. No! I can't wait until you've sailed
  them all away in ships. I got my work to do, and do it I will."</p>

  <p>And in no time all my continents and lands were swirling water and swiping
  strokes of house-flannel.</p>

  <p>That was the worst of my giant visitants, but my mother too, dear lady,
  was something of a terror to this microcosm. She wore spring-sided boots, a
  kind of boot now vanished, I believe, from the world, with dull bodies and
  shiny toes, and a silk dress with flounces that were very destructive to the
  more hazardous viaducts of the Imperial Road. She was always, I seem to
  remember, fetching me; fetching me for a meal, fetching me for a walk or,
  detestable absurdity! fetching me for a wash and brush up, and she never
  seemed to understand anything whatever of the political Systems across which
  she came to me. Also she forbade all toys on Sundays except the bricks for
  church-building and the soldiers for church parade, or a Scriptural use of
  the remains of the Noah's Ark mixed up with a wooden Swiss dairy farm. But
  she really did not know whether a thing was a church or not unless it
  positively bristled with cannon, and many a Sunday afternoon have I played
  Chicago (with the fear of God in my heart) under an infidel pretence that it
  was a new sort of ark rather elaborately done.</p>

  <p>Chicago, I must explain, was based upon my father's description of the pig
  slaughterings in that city and certain pictures I had seen. You made your
  beasts&mdash;which were all the ark lot really, provisionally conceived as
  pigs&mdash;go up elaborate approaches to a central pen, from which they went
  down a cardboard slide four at a time, and dropped most satisfyingly down a
  brick shaft, and pitter-litter over some steep steps to where a head
  slaughterman (ne Noah) strung a cotton loop round their legs and sent them by
  pin hooks along a wire to a second slaughterman with a chipped foot (formerly
  Mrs. Noah) who, if I remember rightly, converted them into Army sausage by
  means of a portion of the inside of an old alarum clock.</p>

  <p>My mother did not understand my games, but my father did. He wore bright-
  coloured socks and carpet slippers when he was indoors&mdash;my mother
  disliked boots in the house&mdash;and he would sit down on my little chair
  and survey the microcosm on the floor with admirable understanding and
  sympathy.</p>

  <p>It was he who gave me most of my toys and, I more than suspect, most of my
  ideas. "Here's some corrugated iron," he would say, "suitable for roofs and
  fencing," and hand me a lump of that stiff crinkled paper that is used for
  packing medicine bottles. Or, "Dick, do you see the tiger loose near the
  Imperial Road?&mdash;won't do for your cattle ranch." And I would find a
  bright new lead tiger like a special creation at large in the world, and
  demanding a hunting expedition and much elaborate effort to get him safely
  housed in the city menagerie beside the captured dragon crocodile, tamed now,
  and his key lost and the heart and spring gone out of him.</p>

  <p>And to the various irregular reading of my father I owe the inestimable
  blessing of never having a boy's book in my boyhood except those of Jules
  Verne. But my father used to get books for himself and me from the Bromstead
  Institute, Fenimore Cooper and Mayne Reid and illustrated histories; one of
  the Russo-Turkish war and one of Napier's expedition to Abyssinia I read from
  end to end; Stanley and Livingstone, lives of Wellington, Napoleon and
  Garibaldi, and back volumes of <i>Punch</i>, from which I derived conceptions
  of foreign and domestic politics it has taken years of adult reflection to
  correct. And at home permanently we had Wood's <i>Natural History</i>, a
  brand-new illustrated Green's <i>History of the English People</i>, Irving's
  <i>Companions of Columbus</i>, a great number of unbound parts of some
  geographical work, <i>A Voyage Round the World</i> I think it was called,
  with pictures of foreign places, and Clarke's <i>New Testament</i> with a map
  of Palestine, and a variety of other informing books bought at sales. There
  was a Sowerby's <i>Botany</i> also, with thousands of carefully tinted
  pictures of British plants, and one or two other important works in the
  sitting-room. I was allowed to turn these over and even lie on the floor with
  them on Sundays and other occasions of exceptional cleanliness.</p>

  <p>And in the attic I found one day a very old forgotten map after the
  fashion of a bird's-eye view, representing the Crimea, that fascinated me and
  kept me for hours navigating its waters with a pin.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">My father was a lank-limbed man in easy shabby tweed clothes
  and with his hands in his trouser pockets. He was a science teacher, taking a
  number of classes at the Bromstead Institute in Kent under the old Science
  and Art Department, and "visiting" various schools; and our resources were
  eked out by my mother's income of nearly a hundred pounds a year, and by his
  inheritance of a terrace of three palatial but structurally unsound stucco
  houses near Bromstead Station.</p>

  <p>They were big clumsy residences in the earliest Victorian style,
  interminably high and with deep damp basements and downstairs coal-cellars
  and kitchens that suggested an architect vindictively devoted to the
  discomfort of the servant class. If so, he had overreached himself and
  defeated his end, for no servant would stay in them unless for exceptional
  wages or exceptional tolerance of inefficiency or exceptional freedom in
  repartee. Every storey in the house was from twelve to fifteen feet high
  (which would have been cool and pleasant in a hot climate), and the stairs
  went steeply up, to end at last in attics too inaccessible for occupation.
  The ceilings had vast plaster cornices of classical design, fragments of
  which would sometimes fall unexpectedly, and the wall-papers were bold and
  gigantic in pattern and much variegated by damp and ill-mended rents.</p>

  <p>As my father was quite unable to let more than one of these houses at a
  time, and that for the most part to eccentric and undesirable tenants, he
  thought it politic to live in one of the two others, and devote the rent he
  received from the let one, when it was let, to the incessant necessary
  repairing of all three. He also did some of the repairing himself and,
  smoking a bull-dog pipe the while, which my mother would not allow him to do
  in the house, he cultivated vegetables in a sketchy, unpunctual and not
  always successful manner in the unoccupied gardens. The three houses faced
  north, and the back of the one we occupied was covered by a grape-vine that
  yielded, I remember, small green grapes for pies in the spring, and
  imperfectly ripe black grapes in favourable autumns for the purposes of
  dessert. The grape-vine played an important part in my life, for my father
  broke his neck while he was pruning it, when I was thirteen.</p>

  <p>My father was what is called a man of ideas, but they were not always good
  ideas. My grandfather had been a private schoolmaster and one of the founders
  of the College of Preceptors, and my father had assisted him in his school
  until increasing competition and diminishing attendance had made it evident
  that the days of small private schools kept by unqualified persons were
  numbered. Thereupon my father had roused himself and had qualified as a
  science teacher under the Science and Art Department, which in these days had
  charge of the scientific and artistic education of the mass of the English
  population, and had thrown himself into science teaching and the earning of
  government grants therefor with great if transitory zeal and success.</p>

  <p>I do not remember anything of my father's earlier and more energetic time.
  I was the child of my parents' middle years; they married when my father was
  thirty-five and my mother past forty, and I saw only the last decadent phase
  of his educational career.</p>

  <p>The Science and Art Department has vanished altogether from the world, and
  people are forgetting it now with the utmost readiness and generosity. Part
  of its substance and staff and spirit survive, more or less completely
  digested into the Board of Education.</p>

  <p>The world does move on, even in its government. It is wonderful how many
  of the clumsy and limited governing bodies of my youth and early manhood have
  given place now to more scientific and efficient machinery. When I was a boy,
  Bromstead, which is now a borough, was ruled by a strange body called a Local
  Board&mdash;it was the Age of Boards&mdash;and I still remember indistinctly
  my father rejoicing at the breakfast-table over the liberation of London from
  the corrupt and devastating control of a Metropolitan Board of Works. Then
  there were also School Boards; I was already practically in politics before
  the London School Board was absorbed by the spreading tentacles of the London
  County Council.</p>

  <p>It gives a measure of the newness of our modern ideas of the State to
  remember that the very beginnings of public education lie within my father's
  lifetime, and that many most intelligent and patriotic people were shocked
  beyond measure at the State doing anything of the sort. When he was born,
  totally illiterate people who could neither read a book nor write more than
  perhaps a clumsy signature, were to be found everywhere in England; and great
  masses of the population were getting no instruction at all. Only a few
  schools flourished upon the patronage of exceptional parents; all over the
  country the old endowed grammar schools were to be found sinking and
  dwindling; many of them had closed altogether. In the new great centres of
  population multitudes of children were sweated in the factories, darkly
  ignorant and wretched and the under-equipped and under-staffed National and
  British schools, supported by voluntary contributions and sectarian
  rivalries, made an ineffectual fight against this festering darkness. It was
  a condition of affairs clamouring for remedies, but there was an immense
  amount of indifference and prejudice to be overcome before any remedies were
  possible. Perhaps some day some industrious and lucid historian will
  disentangle all the muddle of impulses and antagonisms, the commercialism,
  utilitarianism, obstinate conservatism, humanitarian enthusiasm, out of which
  our present educational organisation arose. I have long since come to believe
  it necessary that all new social institutions should be born in confusion,
  and that at first they should present chiefly crude and ridiculous aspects.
  The distrust of government in the Victorian days was far too great, and the
  general intelligence far too low, to permit the State to go about the new
  business it was taking up in a businesslike way, to train teachers, build and
  equip schools, endow pedagogic research, and provide properly written
  school-books. These things it was felt MUST be provided by individual and
  local effort, and since it was manifest that it was individual and local
  effort that were in default, it was reluctantly agreed to stimulate them by
  money payments. The State set up a machinery of examination both in Science
  and Art and for the elementary schools; and payments, known technically as
  grants, were made in accordance with the examination results attained, to
  such schools as Providence might see fit to send into the world. In this way
  it was felt the Demand would be established that would, according to the
  beliefs of that time, inevitably ensure the Supply. An industry of "Grant
  earning" was created, and this would give education as a necessary
  by-product.</p>

  <p>In the end this belief was found to need qualification, but Grant-earning
  was still in full activity when I was a small boy. So far as the Science and
  Art Department and my father are concerned, the task of examination was
  entrusted to eminent scientific men, for the most part quite unaccustomed to
  teaching. You see, if they also were teaching similar classes to those they
  examined, it was feared that injustice might be done. Year after year these
  eminent persons set questions and employed subordinates to read and mark the
  increasing thousands of answers that ensued, and having no doubt the national
  ideal of fairness well developed in their minds, they were careful each year
  to re-read the preceding papers before composing the current one, in order to
  see what it was usual to ask. As a result of this, in the course of a few
  years the recurrence and permutation of questions became almost calculable,
  and since the practical object of the teaching was to teach people not
  science, but how to write answers to these questions, the industry of Grant-
  earning assumed a form easily distinguished from any kind of genuine
  education whatever.</p>

  <p>Other remarkable compromises had also to be made with the spirit of the
  age. The unfortunate conflict between Religion and Science prevalent at this
  time was mitigated, if I remember rightly, by making graduates in arts and
  priests in the established church Science Teachers <i>ex officio</i>, and
  leaving local and private enterprise to provide schools, diagrams, books,
  material, according to the conceptions of efficiency prevalent in the
  district. Private enterprise made a particularly good thing of the books. A
  number of competing firms of publishers sprang into existence specialising in
  Science and Art Department work; they set themselves to produce text-books
  that should supply exactly the quantity and quality of knowledge necessary
  for every stage of each of five and twenty subjects into which desirable
  science was divided, and copies and models and instructions that should give
  precisely the method and gestures esteemed as proficiency in art. Every
  section of each book was written in the idiom found to be most satisfactory
  to the examiners, and test questions extracted from papers set in former
  years were appended to every chapter. By means of these last the teacher was
  able to train his class to the very highest level of grant-earning
  efficiency, and very naturally he cast all other methods of exposition aside.
  First he posed his pupils with questions and then dictated model replies.</p>

  <p>That was my father's method of instruction. I attended his classes as an
  elementary grant-earner from the age of ten until his death, and it is so I
  remember him, sitting on the edge of a table, smothering a yawn occasionally
  and giving out the infallible formulae to the industriously scribbling class
  sitting in rows of desks before him. Occasionally he would slide to his feet
  and go to a blackboard on an easel and draw on that very slowly and
  deliberately in coloured chalks a diagram for the class to copy in coloured
  pencils, and sometimes he would display a specimen or arrange an experiment
  for them to see. The room in the Institute in which he taught was equipped
  with a certain amount of apparatus prescribed as necessary for subject this
  and subject that by the Science and Art Department, and this my father would
  supplement with maps and diagrams and drawings of his own.</p>

  <p>But he never really did experiments, except that in the class in
  systematic botany he sometimes made us tease common flowers to pieces. He did
  not do experiments if he could possibly help it, because in the first place
  they used up time and gas for the Bunsen burner and good material in a
  ruinous fashion, and in the second they were, in his rather careless and
  sketchy hands, apt to endanger the apparatus of the Institute and even the
  lives of his students. Then thirdly, real experiments involved washing up.
  And moreover they always turned out wrong, and sometimes misled the too
  observant learner very seriously and opened demoralising controversies. Quite
  early in life I acquired an almost ineradicable sense of the unscientific
  perversity of Nature and the impassable gulf that is fixed between systematic
  science and elusive fact. I knew, for example, that in science, whether it be
  subject XII., Organic Chemistry, or subject XVII., Animal Physiology, when
  you blow into a glass of lime-water it instantly becomes cloudy, and if you
  continue to blow it clears again, whereas in truth you may blow into the
  stuff from the lime-water bottle until you are crimson in the face and
  painful under the ears, and it never becomes cloudy at all. And I knew, too,
  that in science if you put potassium chlorate into a retort and heat it over
  a Bunsen burner, oxygen is disengaged and may be collected over water,
  whereas in real life if you do anything of the sort the vessel cracks with a
  loud report, the potassium chlorate descends sizzling upon the flame, the
  experimenter says "Oh! Damn!" with astonishing heartiness and distinctness,
  and a lady student in the back seats gets up and leaves the room.</p>

  <p>Science is the organised conquest of Nature, and I can quite understand
  that ancient libertine refusing to co-operate in her own undoing. And I can
  quite understand, too, my father's preference for what he called an
  illustrative experiment, which was simply an arrangement of the apparatus in
  front of the class with nothing whatever by way of material, and the Bunsen
  burner clean and cool, and then a slow luminous description of just what you
  did put in it when you were so ill-advised as to carry the affair beyond
  illustration, and just exactly what ought anyhow to happen when you did. He
  had considerable powers of vivid expression, so that in this way he could
  make us see all he described. The class, freed from any unpleasant nervous
  tension, could draw this still life without flinching, and if any part was
  too difficult to draw, then my father would produce a simplified version on
  the blackboard to be copied instead. And he would also write on the
  blackboard any exceptionally difficult but grant-earning words, such as
  "empyreumatic" or "botryoidal."</p>

  <p>Some words in constant use he rarely explained. I remember once sticking
  up my hand and asking him in the full flow of description, "Please, sir, what
  is flocculent?"</p>

  <p>"The precipitate is."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, but what does it mean?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! flocculent!" said my father, "flocculent! Why&mdash;" he extended his
  hand and arm and twiddled his fingers for a second in the air. "Like that,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>I thought the explanation sufficient, but he paused for a moment after
  giving it. "As in a flock bed, you know," he added and resumed his
  discourse.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">My father, I am afraid, carried a natural incompetence in
  practical affairs to an exceptionally high level. He combined practical
  incompetence, practical enterprise and a thoroughly sanguine temperament, in
  a manner that I have never seen paralleled in any human being. He was always
  trying to do new things in the briskest manner, under the suggestion of books
  or papers or his own spontaneous imagination, and as he had never been
  trained to do anything whatever in his life properly, his futilities were
  extensive and thorough. At one time he nearly gave up his classes for
  intensive culture, so enamoured was he of its possibilities; the peculiar
  pungency of the manure he got, in pursuit of a chemical theory of his own,
  has scarred my olfactory memories for a lifetime. The intensive culture phase
  is very clear in my memory; it came near the end of his career and when I was
  between eleven and twelve. I was mobilised to gather caterpillars on several
  occasions, and assisted in nocturnal raids upon the slugs by lantern-light
  that wrecked my preparation work for school next day. My father dug up both
  lawns, and trenched and manured in spasms of immense vigour alternating with
  periods of paralysing distaste for the garden. And for weeks he talked about
  eight hundred pounds an acre at every meal.</p>

  <p>A garden, even when it is not exasperated by intensive methods, is a thing
  as exacting as a baby, its moods have to be watched; it does not wait upon
  the cultivator's convenience, but has times of its own. Intensive culture
  greatly increases this disposition to trouble mankind; it makes a garden
  touchy and hysterical, a drugged and demoralised and over-irritated garden.
  My father got at cross purposes with our two patches at an early stage.
  Everything grew wrong from the first to last, and if my father's manures
  intensified nothing else, they certainly intensified the Primordial Curse.
  The peas were eaten in the night before they were three inches high, the
  beans bore nothing but blight, the only apparent result of a spraying of the
  potatoes was to develop a PENCHANT in the cat for being ill indoors, the
  cucumber frames were damaged by the catapulting of boys going down the lane
  at the back, and all your cucumbers were mysteriously embittered. That lane
  with its occasional passers-by did much to wreck the intensive scheme,
  because my father always stopped work and went indoors if any one watched
  him. His special manure was apt to arouse a troublesome spirit of inquiry in
  hardy natures.</p>

  <p>In digging his rows and shaping his patches he neglected the guiding
  string and trusted to his eye altogether too much, and the consequent
  obliquity and the various wind-breaks and scare-crows he erected, and
  particularly an irrigation contrivance he began and never finished by which
  everything was to be watered at once by means of pieces of gutter from the
  roof and outhouses of Number 2, and a large and particularly obstinate clump
  of elder-bushes in the abolished hedge that he had failed to destroy entirely
  either by axe or by fire, combined to give the gardens under intensive
  culture a singularly desolate and disorderly appearance. He took steps
  towards the diversion of our house drain under the influence of the Sewage
  Utilisation Society; but happily he stopped in time. He hardly completed any
  of the operations he began; something else became more urgent or simply he
  tired; a considerable area of the Number 2 territory was never even dug
  up.</p>

  <p>In the end the affair irritated him beyond endurance. Never was a man less
  horticulturally-minded. The clamour of these vegetables he had launched into
  the world for his service and assistance, wore out his patience. He would
  walk into the garden the happiest of men after a day or so of disregard,
  talking to me of history perhaps or social organisation, or summarising some
  book he had read. He talked to me of anything that interested him, regardless
  of my limitations. Then he would begin to note the growth of the weeds. "This
  won't do," he would say and pull up a handful.</p>

  <p>More weeding would follow and the talk would become fragmentary. His hands
  would become earthy, his nails black, weeds would snap off in his careless
  grip, leaving the roots behind. The world would darken. He would look at his
  fingers with disgusted astonishment. "CURSE these weeds!" he would say from
  his heart. His discourse was at an end.</p>

  <p>I have memories, too, of his sudden unexpected charges into the
  tranquillity of the house, his hands and clothes intensively enriched. He
  would come in like a whirlwind. "This damned stuff all over me and the
  Agricultural Chemistry Class at six! Bah! AAAAAAH!"</p>

  <p>My mother would never learn not to attempt to break him of swearing on
  such occasions. She would remain standing a little stiffly in the scullery
  refusing to assist him to the adjectival towel he sought.</p>

  <p>"If you say such things&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He would dance with rage and hurl the soap about. "The towel!" he would
  cry, flicking suds from big fingers in every direction; "the towel! I'll let
  the blithering class slide if you don't give me the towel! I'll give up
  everything, I tell you&mdash;everything!"...</p>

  <p>At last with the failure of the lettuces came the breaking point. I was in
  the little arbour learning Latin irregular verbs when it happened. I can see
  him still, his peculiar tenor voice still echoes in my brain, shouting his
  opinion of intensive culture for all the world to hear, and slashing away at
  that abominable mockery of a crop with a hoe. We had tied them up with bast
  only a week or so before, and now half were rotten and half had shot up into
  tall slender growths. He had the hoe in both hands and slogged. Great wipes
  he made, and at each stroke he said, "Take that!"</p>

  <p>The air was thick with flying fragments of abortive salad. It was a
  fantastic massacre. It was the French Revolution of that cold tyranny, the
  vindictive overthrow of the pampered vegetable aristocrats. After he had
  assuaged his passion upon them, he turned for other prey; he kicked holes in
  two of our noblest marrows, flicked off the heads of half a row of
  artichokes, and shied the hoe with a splendid smash into the cucumber frame.
  Something of the awe of that moment returns to me as I write of it.</p>

  <p>"Well, my boy," he said, approaching with an expression of beneficent
  happiness, "I've done with gardening. Let's go for a walk like reasonable
  beings. I've had enough of this"&mdash;his face was convulsed for an instant
  with bitter resentment&mdash;"Pandering to cabbages."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">That afternoon's walk sticks in my memory for many reasons.
  One is that we went further than I had ever been before; far beyond Keston
  and nearly to Seven-oaks, coming back by train from Dunton Green, and the
  other is that my father as he went along talked about himself, not so much to
  me as to himself, and about life and what he had done with it. He monologued
  so that at times he produced an effect of weird world-forgetfulness. I
  listened puzzled, and at that time not understanding many things that
  afterwards became plain to me. It is only in recent years that I have
  discovered the pathos of that monologue; how friendless my father was and
  uncompanioned in his thoughts and feelings, and what a hunger he may have
  felt for the sympathy of the undeveloped youngster who trotted by his
  side.</p>

  <p>"I'm no gardener," he said, "I'm no anything. Why the devil did I start
  gardening?</p>

  <p>"I suppose man was created to mind a garden... But the Fall let us out of
  that! What was I created for? God! what was I created for?...</p>

  <p>"Slaves to matter! Minding inanimate things! It doesn't suit me, you know.
  I've got no hands and no patience. I've mucked about with life. Mucked about
  with life." He suddenly addressed himself to me, and for an instant I started
  like an eavesdropper discovered. "Whatever you do, boy, whatever you do, make
  a Plan. Make a good Plan and stick to it. Find out what life is about&mdash;I
  never have&mdash;and set yourself to do whatever you ought to do. I admit
  it's a puzzle...</p>

  <p>"Those damned houses have been the curse of my life. Stucco white
  elephants! Beastly cracked stucco with stains of green&mdash;black and green.
  Conferva and soot... Property, they are! ... Beware of Things, Dick, beware
  of Things! Before you know where you are you are waiting on them and minding
  them. They'll eat your life up. Eat up your hours and your blood and energy!
  When those houses came to me, I ought to have sold them&mdash;or fled the
  country. I ought to have cleared out. Sarcophagi&mdash;eaters of men! Oh! the
  hours and days of work, the nights of anxiety those vile houses have cost me!
  The painting! It worked up my arms; it got all over me. I stank of it. It
  made me ill. It isn't living&mdash;it's minding...</p>

  <p>"Property's the curse of life. Property! Ugh! Look at this country all cut
  up into silly little parallelograms, look at all those villas we passed just
  now and those potato patches and that tarred shanty and the hedge! Somebody's
  minding every bit of it like a dog tied to a cart's tail. Patching it and
  bothering about it. Bothering! Yapping at every passer-by. Look at that
  notice-board! One rotten worried little beast wants to keep us other rotten
  little beasts off HIS patch,&mdash;God knows why! Look at the weeds in it.
  Look at the mended fence! ... There's no property worth having, Dick, but
  money. That's only good to spend. All these things. Human souls buried under
  a cartload of blithering rubbish...</p>

  <p>"I'm not a fool, Dick. I have qualities, imagination, a sort of go. I
  ought to have made a better thing of life.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I could have done things. Only the old people pulled my leg.
  They started me wrong. They never started me at all. I only began to find out
  what life was like when I was nearly forty.</p>

  <p>"If I'd gone to a university; if I'd had any sort of sound training, if I
  hadn't slipped into the haphazard places that came easiest...</p>

  <p>"Nobody warned me. Nobody. It isn't a world we live in, Dick; it's a
  cascade of accidents; it's a chaos exasperated by policemen! <i>you</i> be
  warned in time, Dick. You stick to a plan. Don't wait for any one to show you
  the way. Nobody will. There isn't a way till you make one. Get education, get
  a good education. Fight your way to the top. It's your only chance. I've
  watched you. You'll do no good at digging and property minding. There isn't a
  neighbour in Bromstead won't be able to skin you at suchlike games. You and I
  are the brainy unstable kind, topside or nothing. And if ever those
  blithering houses come to you&mdash;don't have 'em. Give them away! Dynamite
  'em&mdash;and off! <i>Live</i>, Dick! I'll get rid of them for you if I can,
  Dick, but remember what I say."...</p>

  <p>So it was my father discoursed, if not in those particular words, yet
  exactly in that manner, as he slouched along the southward road, with
  resentful eyes becoming less resentful as he talked, and flinging out clumsy
  illustrative motions at the outskirts of Bromstead as we passed along them.
  That afternoon he hated Bromstead, from its foot-tiring pebbles up. He had no
  illusions about Bromstead or himself. I have the clearest impression of him
  in his garden-stained tweeds with a deer-stalker hat on the back of his head
  and presently a pipe sometimes between his teeth and sometimes in his
  gesticulating hand, as he became diverted by his talk from his original
  exasperation...</p>

  <p>This particular afternoon is no doubt mixed up in my memory with many
  other afternoons; all sorts of things my father said and did at different
  times have got themselves referred to it; it filled me at the time with a
  great unprecedented sense of fellowship and it has become the symbol now for
  all our intercourse together. If I didn't understand the things he said, I
  did the mood he was in. He gave me two very broad ideas in that talk and the
  talks I have mingled with it; he gave them to me very clearly and they have
  remained fundamental in my mind; one a sense of the extraordinary confusion
  and waste and planlessness of the human life that went on all about us; and
  the other of a great ideal of order and economy which he called variously
  Science and Civilisation, and which, though I do not remember that he ever
  used that word, I suppose many people nowadays would identify with
  Socialism,&mdash;as the Fabians expound it.</p>

  <p>He was not very definite about this Science, you must understand, but he
  seemed always to be waving his hand towards it,&mdash;just as his
  contemporary Tennyson seems always to be doing&mdash;he belonged to his age
  and mostly his talk was destructive of the limited beliefs of his time, he
  led me to infer rather than actually told me that this Science was coming, a
  spirit of light and order, to the rescue of a world groaning and travailing
  in muddle for the want of it...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">When I think of Bromstead nowadays I find it inseparably
  bound up with the disorders of my father's gardening, and the odd patchings
  and paintings that disfigured his houses. It was all of a piece with
  that.</p>

  <p>Let me try and give something of the quality of Bromstead and something of
  its history. It is the quality and history of a thousand places round and
  about London, and round and about the other great centres of population in
  the world. Indeed it is in a measure the quality of the whole of this modern
  world from which we who have the statesman's passion struggle to evolve, and
  dream still of evolving order.</p>

  <p>First, then, you must think of Bromstead a hundred and fifty years ago, as
  a narrow irregular little street of thatched houses strung out on the London
  and Dover Road, a little mellow sample unit of a social order that had a kind
  of completeness, at its level, of its own. At that time its population
  numbered a little under two thousand people, mostly engaged in agricultural
  work or in trades serving agriculture. There was a blacksmith, a saddler, a
  chemist, a doctor, a barber, a linen-draper (who brewed his own beer); a
  veterinary surgeon, a hardware shop, and two capacious inns. Round and about
  it were a number of pleasant gentlemen's seats, whose owners went frequently
  to London town in their coaches along the very tolerable high-road. The
  church was big enough to hold the whole population, were people minded to go
  to church, and indeed a large proportion did go, and all who married were
  married in it, and everybody, to begin with, was christened at its font and
  buried at last in its yew-shaded graveyard. Everybody knew everybody in the
  place. It was, in fact, a definite place and a real human community in those
  days. There was a pleasant old market-house in the middle of the town with a
  weekly market, and an annual fair at which much cheerful merry making and
  homely intoxication occurred; there was a pack of hounds which hunted within
  five miles of London Bridge, and the local gentry would occasionally enliven
  the place with valiant cricket matches for a hundred guineas a side, to the
  vast excitement of the entire population. It was very much the same sort of
  place that it had been for three or four centuries. A Bromstead Rip van
  Winkle from 1550 returning in 1750 would have found most of the old houses
  still as he had known them, the same trades a little improved and
  differentiated one from the other, the same roads rather more carefully
  tended, the Inns not very much altered, the ancient familiar market-house.
  The occasional wheeled traffic would have struck him as the most remarkable
  difference, next perhaps to the swaggering painted stone monuments instead of
  brasses and the protestant severity of the communion-table in the parish
  church,&mdash;both from the material point of view very little things. A Rip
  van Winkle from 1350, again, would have noticed scarcely greater changes;
  fewer clergy, more people, and particularly more people of the middling sort;
  the glass in the windows of many of the houses, the stylish chimneys
  springing up everywhere would have impressed him, and suchlike details. The
  place would have had the same boundaries, the same broad essential features,
  would have been still itself in the way that a man is still himself after he
  has "filled out" a little and grown a longer beard and changed his
  clothes.</p>

  <p>But after 1750 something got hold of the world, something that was
  destined to alter the scale of every human affair.</p>

  <p>That something was machinery and a vague energetic disposition to improve
  material things. In another part of England ingenious people were beginning
  to use coal in smelting iron, and were producing metal in abundance and metal
  castings in sizes that had hitherto been unattainable. Without warning or
  preparation, increment involving countless possibilities of further increment
  was coming to the strength of horses and men. "Power," all unsuspected, was
  flowing like a drug into the veins of the social body.</p>

  <p>Nobody seems to have perceived this coming of power, and nobody had
  calculated its probable consequences. Suddenly, almost inadvertently, people
  found themselves doing things that would have amazed their ancestors. They
  began to construct wheeled vehicles much more easily and cheaply than they
  had ever done before, to make up roads and move things about that had
  formerly been esteemed too heavy for locomotion, to join woodwork with iron
  nails instead of wooden pegs, to achieve all sorts of mechanical
  possibilities, to trade more freely and manufacture on a larger scale, to
  send goods abroad in a wholesale and systematic way, to bring back
  commodities from overseas, not simply spices and fine commodities, but goods
  in bulk. The new influence spread to agriculture, iron appliances replaced
  wooden, breeding of stock became systematic, paper-making and printing
  increased and cheapened. Roofs of slate and tile appeared amidst and
  presently prevailed over the original Bromstead thatch, the huge space of
  Common to the south was extensively enclosed, and what had been an
  ill-defined horse-track to Dover, only passable by adventurous coaches in dry
  weather, became the Dover Road, and was presently the route first of one and
  then of several daily coaches. The High Street was discovered to be too
  tortuous for these awakening energies, and a new road cut off its worst
  contortions. Residential villas appeared occupied by retired tradesmen and
  widows, who esteemed the place healthy, and by others of a strange new
  unoccupied class of people who had money invested in joint-stock enterprises.
  First one and then several boys' boarding-schools came, drawing their pupils
  from London,&mdash;my grandfather's was one of these. London, twelve miles to
  the north-west, was making itself felt more and more.</p>

  <p>But this was only the beginning of the growth period, the first trickle of
  the coming flood of mechanical power. Away in the north they were casting
  iron in bigger and bigger forms, working their way to the production of steel
  on a large scale, applying power in factories. Bromstead had almost doubted
  in size again long before the railway came; there was hardly any thatch left
  in the High Street, but instead were houses with handsome brass-knockered
  front doors and several windows, and shops with shop-fronts all of square
  glass panes, and the place was lighted publicly now by oil
  lamps&mdash;previously only one flickering lamp outside each of the coaching
  inns had broken the nocturnal darkness. And there was talk, it long remained
  talk,&mdash;of gas. The gasworks came in 1834, and about that date my
  father's three houses must have been built convenient for the London Road.
  They mark nearly the beginning of the real suburban quality; they were let at
  first to City people still engaged in business.</p>

  <p>And then hard on the gasworks had come the railway and cheap coal; there
  was a wild outbreak of brickfields upon the claylands to the east, and the
  Great Growth had begun in earnest. The agricultural placidities that had
  formerly come to the very borders of the High Street were broken up north,
  west and south, by new roads. This enterprising person and then that began to
  "run up" houses, irrespective of every other enterprising person who was
  doing the same thing. A Local Board came into existence, and with much
  hesitation and penny-wise economy inaugurated drainage works. Rates became a
  common topic, a fact of accumulating importance. Several chapels of zinc and
  iron appeared, and also a white new church in commercial Gothic upon the
  common, and another of red brick in the residential district out beyond the
  brickfields towards Chessington.</p>

  <p>The population doubled again and doubled again, and became particularly
  teeming in the prolific "working-class" district about the deep-rutted,
  muddy, coal-blackened roads between the gasworks, Blodgett's laundries, and
  the railway goods-yard. Weekly properties, that is to say small houses built
  by small property owners and let by the week, sprang up also in the Cage
  Fields, and presently extended right up the London Road. A single national
  school in an inconvenient situation set itself inadequately to collect
  subscriptions and teach the swarming, sniffing, grimy offspring of this dingy
  new population to read. The villages of Beckington, which used to be three
  miles to the west, and Blamely four miles to the east of Bromstead, were
  experiencing similar distensions and proliferations, and grew out to meet us.
  All effect of locality or community had gone from these places long before I
  was born; hardly any one knew any one; there was no general meeting place any
  more, the old fairs were just common nuisances haunted by gypsies, van
  showmen, Cheap Jacks and London roughs, the churches were incapable of a
  quarter of the population. One or two local papers of shameless veniality
  reported the proceedings of the local Bench and the local Board, compelled
  tradesmen who were interested in these affairs to advertise, used the epithet
  "Bromstedian" as one expressing peculiar virtues, and so maintained in the
  general mind a weak tradition of some local quality that embraced us all.
  Then the parish graveyard filled up and became a scandal, and an ambitious
  area with an air of appetite was walled in by a Bromstead Cemetery Company,
  and planted with suitably high-minded and sorrowful varieties of conifer. A
  stonemason took one of the earlier villas with a front garden at the end of
  the High Street, and displayed a supply of urns on pillars and headstones and
  crosses in stone, marble, and granite, that would have sufficed to
  commemorate in elaborate detail the entire population of Bromstead as one
  found it in 1750.</p>

  <p>The cemetery was made when I was a little boy of five or six; I was in the
  full tide of building and growth from the first; the second railway with its
  station at Bromstead North and the drainage followed when I was ten or
  eleven, and all my childish memories are of digging and wheeling, of woods
  invaded by building, roads gashed open and littered with iron pipes amidst a
  fearful smell of gas, of men peeped at and seen toiling away deep down in
  excavations, of hedges broken down and replaced by planks, of wheelbarrows
  and builders' sheds, of rivulets overtaken and swallowed up by drain-pipes.
  Big trees, and especially elms, cleared of undergrowth and left standing amid
  such things, acquired a peculiar tattered dinginess rather in the quality of
  needy widow women who have seen happier days.</p>

  <p>The Ravensbrook of my earlier memories was a beautiful stream. It came
  into my world out of a mysterious Beyond, out of a garden, splashing brightly
  down a weir which had once been the weir of a mill. (Above the weir and
  inaccessible there were bulrushes growing in splendid clumps, and beyond
  that, pampas grass, yellow and crimson spikes of hollyhock, and blue
  suggestions of wonderland.) From the pool at the foot of this initial cascade
  it flowed in a leisurely fashion beside a footpath,&mdash;there were two
  pretty thatched cottages on the left, and here were ducks, and there were
  willows on the right,&mdash;and so came to where great trees grew on high
  banks on either hand and bowed closer, and at last met overhead. This part
  was difficult to reach because of an old fence, but a little boy might
  glimpse that long cavern of greenery by wading. Either I have actually seen
  kingfishers there, or my father has described them so accurately to me that
  he inserted them into my memory. I remember them there anyhow. Most of that
  overhung part I never penetrated at all, but followed the field path with my
  mother and met the stream again, where beyond there were flat meadows,
  Roper's meadows. The Ravensbrook went meandering across the middle of these,
  now between steep banks, and now with wide shallows at the bends where the
  cattle waded and drank. Yellow and purple loose-strife and ordinary rushes
  grew in clumps along the bank, and now and then a willow. On rare occasions
  of rapture one might see a rat cleaning his whiskers at the water's edge. The
  deep places were rich with tangled weeds, and in them fishes lurked&mdash;to
  me they were big fishes&mdash;water-boatmen and water-beetles traversed the
  calm surface of these still deeps; in one pool were yellow lilies and
  water-soldiers, and in the shoaly places hovering fleets of small fry basked
  in the sunshine&mdash;to vanish in a flash at one's shadow. In one place,
  too, were Rapids, where the stream woke with a start from a dreamless
  brooding into foaming panic and babbled and hastened. Well do I remember that
  half-mile of rivulet; all other rivers and cascades have their reference to
  it for me. And after I was eleven, and before we left Bromstead, all the
  delight and beauty of it was destroyed.</p>

  <p>The volume of its water decreased abruptly&mdash;I suppose the new
  drainage works that linked us up with Beckington, and made me first
  acquainted with the geological quality of the London clay, had to do with
  that&mdash;until only a weak uncleansing trickle remained. That at first did
  not strike me as a misfortune. An adventurous small boy might walk dryshod in
  places hitherto inaccessible. But hard upon that came the pegs, the planks
  and carts and devastation. Roper's meadows, being no longer in fear of
  floods, were now to be slashed out into parallelograms of untidy road, and
  built upon with rows of working-class cottages. The roads
  came,&mdash;horribly; the houses followed. They seemed to rise in the night.
  People moved into them as soon as the roofs were on, mostly workmen and their
  young wives, and already in a year some of these raw houses stood empty again
  from defaulting tenants, with windows broken and wood-work warping and
  rotting. The Ravensbrook became a dump for old iron, rusty cans, abandoned
  boots and the like, and was a river only when unusual rains filled it for a
  day or so with an inky flood of surface water...</p>

  <p>That indeed was my most striking perception in the growth of Bromstead.
  The Ravensbrook had been important to my imaginative life; that way had
  always been my first choice in all my walks with my mother, and its rapid
  swamping by the new urban growth made it indicative of all the other things
  that had happened just before my time, or were still, at a less dramatic
  pace, happening. I realised that building was the enemy. I began to
  understand why in every direction out of Bromstead one walked past
  scaffold-poles into litter, why fragments of broken brick and cinder mingled
  in every path, and the significance of the universal notice-boards, either
  white and new or a year old and torn and battered, promising sites,
  proffering houses to be sold or let, abusing and intimidating passers-by for
  fancied trespass, and protecting rights of way.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to disentangle now what I understood at this time and what
  I have since come to understand, but it seems to me that even in those
  childish days I was acutely aware of an invading and growing disorder. The
  serene rhythms of the old established agriculture, I see now, were everywhere
  being replaced by cultivation under notice and snatch crops; hedges ceased to
  be repaired, and were replaced by cheap iron railings or chunks of corrugated
  iron; more and more hoardings sprang up, and contributed more and more to the
  nomad tribes of filthy paper scraps that flew before the wind and overspread
  the country. The outskirts of Bromstead were a maze of exploitation roads
  that led nowhere, that ended in tarred fences studded with nails (I don't
  remember barbed wire in those days; I think the Zeitgeist did not produce
  that until later), and in trespass boards that used vehement language. Broken
  glass, tin cans, and ashes and paper abounded. Cheap glass, cheap tin,
  abundant fuel, and a free untaxed Press had rushed upon a world quite
  unprepared to dispose of these blessings when the fulness of enjoyment was
  past.</p>

  <p>I suppose one might have persuaded oneself that all this was but the
  replacement of an ancient tranquillity, or at least an ancient balance, by a
  new order. Only to my eyes, quickened by my father's intimations, it was
  manifestly no order at all. It was a multitude of incoordinated fresh starts,
  each more sweeping and destructive than the last, and none of them ever
  really worked out to a ripe and satisfactory completion. Each left a legacy
  of products, houses, humanity, or what not, in its wake. It was a sort of
  progress that had bolted; it was change out of hand, and going at an
  unprecedented pace nowhere in particular.</p>

  <p>No, the Victorian epoch was not the dawn of a new era; it was a hasty,
  trial experiment, a gigantic experiment of the most slovenly and wasteful
  kind. I suppose it was necessary; I suppose all things are necessary. I
  suppose that before men will discipline themselves to learn and plan, they
  must first see in a hundred convincing forms the folly and muddle that come
  from headlong, aimless and haphazard methods. The nineteenth century was an
  age of demonstrations, some of them very impressive demonstrations, of the
  powers that have come to mankind, but of permanent achievement, what will our
  descendants cherish? It is hard to estimate what grains of precious metal may
  not be found in a mud torrent of human production on so large a scale, but
  will any one, a hundred years from now, consent to live in the houses the
  Victorians built, travel by their roads or railways, value the furnishings
  they made to live among or esteem, except for curious or historical reasons,
  their prevalent art and the clipped and limited literature that satisfied
  their souls?</p>

  <p>That age which bore me was indeed a world full of restricted and
  undisciplined people, overtaken by power, by possessions and great new
  freedoms, and unable to make any civilised use of them whatever; stricken now
  by this idea and now by that, tempted first by one possession and then
  another to ill-considered attempts; it was my father's exploitation of his
  villa gardens on the wholesale level. The whole of Bromstead as I remember
  it, and as I saw it last&mdash;it is a year ago now&mdash;is a dull useless
  boiling-up of human activities, an immense clustering of futilities. It is as
  unfinished as ever; the builders' roads still run out and end in mid-field in
  their old fashion; the various enterprises jumble in the same hopeless
  contradiction, if anything intensified. Pretentious villas jostle slums, and
  public-house and tin tabernacle glower at one another across the cat-haunted
  lot that intervenes. Roper's meadows are now quite frankly a slum; back doors
  and sculleries gape towards the railway, their yards are hung with tattered
  washing unashamed; and there seem to be more boards by the railway every time
  I pass, advertising pills and pickles, tonics and condiments, and suchlike
  solicitudes of a people with no natural health nor appetite left in
  them...</p>

  <p>Well, we have to do better. Failure is not failure nor waste wasted if it
  sweeps away illusion and lights the road to a plan.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">Chaotic indiscipline, ill-adjusted effort, spasmodic aims,
  these give the quality of all my Bromstead memories. The crowning one of them
  all rises to desolating tragedy. I remember now the wan spring sunshine of
  that Sunday morning, the stiff feeling of best clothes and aggressive
  cleanliness and formality, when I and my mother returned from church to find
  my father dead. He had been pruning the grape vine. He had never had a ladder
  long enough to reach the sill of the third-floor windows&mdash;at
  house-painting times he had borrowed one from the plumber who mixed his
  paint&mdash;and he had in his own happy-go-lucky way contrived a combination
  of the garden fruit ladder with a battered kitchen table that served all
  sorts of odd purposes in an outhouse. He had stayed up this arrangement by
  means of the garden roller, and the roller had at the critical
  moment&mdash;rolled. He was lying close by the garden door with his head
  queerly bent back against a broken and twisted rainwater pipe, an expression
  of pacific contentment on his face, a bamboo curtain rod with a tableknife
  tied to end of it, still gripped in his hand. We had been rapping for some
  time at the front door unable to make him hear, and then we came round by the
  door in the side trellis into the garden and so discovered him.</p>

  <p>"Arthur!" I remember my mother crying with the strangest break in her
  voice, "What are you doing there? Arthur! And&mdash;<i>Sunday</i>!"</p>

  <p>I was coming behind her, musing remotely, when the quality of her voice
  roused me. She stood as if she could not go near him. He had always puzzled
  her so, he and his ways, and this seemed only another enigma. Then the truth
  dawned on her, she shrieked as if afraid of him, ran a dozen steps back
  towards the trellis door and stopped and clasped her ineffectual gloved
  hands, leaving me staring blankly, too astonished for feeling, at the
  carelessly flung limbs.</p>

  <p>The same idea came to me also. I ran to her. "Mother!" I cried, pale to
  the depths of my spirit, "<i>Is he dead?</i>"</p>

  <p>I had been thinking two minutes before of the cold fruit pie that
  glorified our Sunday dinner-table, and how I might perhaps get into the tree
  at the end of the garden to read in the afternoon. Now an immense fact had
  come down like a curtain and blotted out all my childish world. My father was
  lying dead before my eyes... I perceived that my mother was helpless and that
  things must be done.</p>

  <p>"Mother!" I said, "we must get Doctor Beaseley,&mdash;and carry him
  indoors."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap1_03"
     name="chap1_03"></a>III. &mdash; SCHOLASTIC</h2>1

  <p>My formal education began in a small preparatory school in Bromstead. I
  went there as a day boy. The charge for my instruction was mainly set off by
  the periodic visits of my father with a large bag of battered fossils to
  lecture to us upon geology. I was one of those fortunate youngsters who take
  readily to school work, I had a good memory, versatile interests and a
  considerable appetite for commendation, and when I was barely twelve I got a
  scholarship at the City Merchants School and was entrusted with a scholar's
  railway season ticket to Victoria. After my father's death a large and very
  animated and solidly built uncle in tweeds from Staffordshire, Uncle Minter,
  my mother's sister's husband, with a remarkable accent and remarkable vowel
  sounds, who had plunged into the Bromstead home once or twice for the night
  but who was otherwise unknown to me, came on the scene, sold off the three
  gaunt houses with the utmost gusto, invested the proceeds and my father's
  life insurance money, and got us into a small villa at Penge within sight of
  that immense facade of glass and iron, the Crystal Palace. Then he retired in
  a mood of good-natured contempt to his native habitat again. We stayed at
  Penge until my mother's death.</p>

  <p>School became a large part of the world to me, absorbing my time and
  interest, and I never acquired that detailed and intimate knowledge of Penge
  and the hilly villadom round about, that I have of the town and outskirts of
  Bromstead.</p>

  <p>It was a district of very much the same character, but it was more
  completely urbanised and nearer to the centre of things; there were the same
  unfinished roads, the same occasional disconcerted hedges and trees, the same
  butcher's horse grazing under a builder's notice-board, the same incidental
  lapses into slum. The Crystal Palace grounds cut off a large part of my
  walking radius to the west with impassable fences and forbiddingly expensive
  turnstiles, but it added to the ordinary spectacle of meteorology a great
  variety of gratuitous fireworks which banged and flared away of a night after
  supper and drew me abroad to see them better. Such walks as I took, to
  Croydon, Wembledon, West Wickham and Greenwich, impressed upon me the
  interminable extent of London's residential suburbs; mile after mile one
  went, between houses, villas, rows of cottages, streets of shops, under
  railway arches, over railway bridges. I have forgotten the detailed local
  characteristics&mdash;if there were any&mdash;of much of that region
  altogether. I was only there two years, and half my perambulations occurred
  at dusk or after dark. But with Penge I associate my first realisations of
  the wonder and beauty of twilight and night, the effect of dark walls
  reflecting lamplight, and the mystery of blue haze-veiled hillsides of
  houses, the glare of shops by night, the glowing steam and streaming sparks
  of railway trains and railway signals lit up in the darkness. My first
  rambles in the evening occurred at Penge&mdash;I was becoming a big and
  independent-spirited boy&mdash;and I began my experience of smoking during
  these twilight prowls with the threepenny packets of American cigarettes then
  just appearing in the world.</p>

  <p>My life centred upon the City Merchants School. Usually I caught the
  eight-eighteen for Victoria, I had a midday meal and tea; four nights a week
  I stayed for preparation, and often I was not back home again until within an
  hour of my bedtime. I spent my half holidays at school in order to play
  cricket and football. This, and a pretty voracious appetite for miscellaneous
  reading which was fostered by the Penge Middleton Library, did not leave me
  much leisure for local topography. On Sundays also I sang in the choir at St.
  Martin's Church, and my mother did not like me to walk out alone on the
  Sabbath afternoon, she herself slumbered, so that I wrote or read at home. I
  must confess I was at home as little as I could contrive.</p>

  <p>Home, after my father's death, had become a very quiet and uneventful
  place indeed. My mother had either an unimaginative temperament or her mind
  was greatly occupied with private religious solicitudes, and I remember her
  talking to me but little, and that usually upon topics I was anxious to
  evade. I had developed my own view about low-Church theology long before my
  father's death, and my meditation upon that event had finished my secret
  estrangement from my mother's faith. My reason would not permit even a remote
  chance of his being in hell, he was so manifestly not evil, and this religion
  would not permit him a remote chance of being out yet. When I was a little
  boy my mother had taught me to read and write and pray and had done many
  things for me, indeed she persisted in washing me and even in making my
  clothes until I rebelled against these things as indignities. But our minds
  parted very soon. She never began to understand the mental processes of my
  play, she never interested herself in my school life and work, she could not
  understand things I said; and she came, I think, quite insensibly to regard
  me with something of the same hopeless perplexity she had felt towards my
  father.</p>

  <p>Him she must have wedded under considerable delusions. I do not think he
  deceived her, indeed, nor do I suspect him of mercenariness in their union;
  but no doubt he played up to her requirements in the half ingenuous way that
  was and still is the quality of most wooing, and presented himself as a very
  brisk and orthodox young man. I wonder why nearly all love-making has to be
  fraudulent. Afterwards he must have disappointed her cruelly by letting one
  aspect after another of his careless, sceptical, experimental temperament
  appear. Her mind was fixed and definite, she embodied all that confidence in
  church and decorum and the assurances of the pulpit which was characteristic
  of the large mass of the English people&mdash;for after all, the rather low-
  Church section <i>was</i> the largest single mass&mdash;in early Victorian
  times. She had dreams, I suspect, of going to church with him side by side;
  she in a little poke bonnet and a large flounced crinoline, all mauve and
  magenta and starched under a little lace-trimmed parasol, and he in a tall
  silk hat and peg-top trousers and a roll-collar coat, and looking rather like
  the Prince Consort,&mdash;white angels almost visibly raining benedictions on
  their amiable progress. Perhaps she dreamt gently of much-belaced babies and
  an interestingly pious (but not too dissenting or fanatical) little girl or
  boy or so, also angel-haunted. And I think, too, she must have seen herself
  ruling a seemly "home of taste," with a vivarium in the conservatory that
  opened out of the drawing-room, or again, making preserves in the kitchen. My
  father's science-teaching, his diagrams of disembowelled humanity, his
  pictures of prehistoric beasts that contradicted the Flood, his disposition
  towards soft shirts and loose tweed suits, his inability to use a clothes
  brush, his spasmodic reading fits and his bulldog pipes, must have jarred
  cruelly with her rather unintelligent anticipations. His wild moments of
  violent temper when he would swear and smash things, absurd almost lovable
  storms that passed like summer thunder, must have been starkly dreadful to
  her. She was constitutionally inadaptable, and certainly made no attempt to
  understand or tolerate these outbreaks. She tried them by her standards, and
  by her standards they were wrong. Her standards hid him from her. The blazing
  things he said rankled in her mind unforgettably.</p>

  <p>As I remember them together they chafed constantly. Her attitude to nearly
  all his moods and all his enterprises was a sceptical disapproval. She
  treated him as something that belonged to me and not to her. "<i>Your</i>
  father," she used to call him, as though I had got him for her.</p>

  <p>She had married late and she had, I think, become mentally self-
  subsisting before her marriage. Even in those Herne Hill days I used to
  wonder what was going on in her mind, and I find that old speculative
  curiosity return as I write this. She took a considerable interest in the
  housework that our generally servantless condition put upon her&mdash;she
  used to have a charwoman in two or three times a week&mdash;but she did not
  do it with any great skill. She covered most of our furniture with flouncey
  ill-fitting covers, and she cooked plainly and without very much judgment.
  The Penge house, as it contained nearly all our Bromstead things, was crowded
  with furniture, and is chiefly associated in my mind with the smell of
  turpentine, a condiment she used very freely upon the veneered mahogany
  pieces. My mother had an equal dread of "blacks" by day and the "night air,"
  so that our brightly clean windows were rarely open.</p>

  <p>She took a morning paper, and she would open it and glance at the
  headlines, but she did not read it until the afternoon and then, I think, she
  was interested only in the more violent crimes, and in railway and mine
  disasters and in the minutest domesticities of the Royal Family. Most of the
  books at home were my father's, and I do not think she opened any of them.
  She had one or two volumes that dated from her own youth, and she tried in
  vain to interest me in them; there was Miss Strickland's <i>Queens of
  England</i>, a book I remember with particular animosity, and <i>Queechy</i>
  and the <i>Wide Wide World</i>. She made these books of hers into a class
  apart by sewing outer covers upon them of calico and figured muslin. To me in
  these habiliments they seemed not so much books as confederated old
  ladies.</p>

  <p>My mother was also very punctual with her religious duties, and rejoiced
  to watch me in the choir.</p>

  <p>On winter evenings she occupied an armchair on the other side of the table
  at which I sat, head on hand reading, and she would be darning stockings or
  socks or the like. We achieved an effect of rather stuffy comfortableness
  that was soporific, and in a passive way I think she found these among her
  happy times. On such occasions she was wont to put her work down on her knees
  and fall into a sort of thoughtless musing that would last for long intervals
  and rouse my curiosity. For like most young people I could not imagine mental
  states without definite forms.</p>

  <p>She carried on a correspondence with a number of cousins and friends,
  writing letters in a slanting Italian hand and dealing mainly with births,
  marriages and deaths, business starts (in the vaguest terms) and the
  distresses of bankruptcy.</p>

  <p>And yet, you know, she did have a curious intimate life of her own that I
  suspected nothing of at the time, that only now becomes credible to me. She
  kept a diary that is still in my possession, a diary of fragmentary entries
  in a miscellaneous collection of pocket books. She put down the texts of the
  sermons she heard, and queer stiff little comments on casual
  visitors,&mdash;"Miss G. and much noisy shrieking talk about games and such
  frivolities and <i>croquay</i>. A. delighted and <i>very attentive</i>." Such
  little human entries abound. She had an odd way of never writing a name, only
  an initial; my father is always "A.," and I am always "D." It is manifest she
  followed the domestic events in the life of the Princess of Wales, who is now
  Queen Mother, with peculiar interest and sympathy. "Pray G. all may be well,"
  she writes in one such crisis.</p>

  <p>But there are things about myself that I still find too poignant to tell
  easily, certain painful and clumsy circumstances of my birth in very great
  detail, the distresses of my infantile ailments. Then later I find such
  things as this: "Heard D. s&mdash;."HOME The "s" is evidently "swear
  "&mdash;"G. bless and keep my boy from evil." And again, with the thin
  handwriting shaken by distress: "D. would not go to church, and hardened his
  heart and said wicked infidel things, much disrespect of the clergy. The
  anthem is tiresome!!! That men should set up to be wiser than their maker!!!"
  Then trebly underlined: "<i>I fear his father's teaching</i>." Dreadful
  little tangle of misapprehensions and false judgments! More comforting for me
  to read, "D. very kind and good. He grows more thoughtful every day." I
  suspect myself of forgotten hypocrisies.</p>

  <p>At just one point my mother's papers seem to dip deeper. I think the death
  of my father must have stirred her for the first time for many years to think
  for herself. Even she could not go on living in any peace at all, believing
  that he had indeed been flung headlong into hell. Of this gnawing solicitude
  she never spoke to me, never, and for her diary also she could find no
  phrases. But on a loose half-sheet of notepaper between its pages I find this
  passage that follows, written very carefully. I do not know whose lines they
  are nor how she came upon them. They run:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And if there be no meeting past the grave; If all is darkness, silence,
  yet 'tis rest. Be not afraid ye waiting hearts that weep, For God still
  giveth His beloved sleep, And if an endless sleep He wills, so best."</p>

  <p>That scrap of verse amazed me when I read it. I could even wonder if my
  mother really grasped the import of what she had copied out. It affected me
  as if a stone-deaf person had suddenly turned and joined in a whispered
  conversation. It set me thinking how far a mind in its general effect quite
  hopelessly limited, might range. After that I went through all her diaries,
  trying to find something more than a conventional term of tenderness for my
  father. But I found nothing. And yet somehow there grew upon me the
  realisation that there had been love... Her love for me, on the other hand,
  was abundantly expressed.</p>

  <p>I knew nothing of that secret life of feeling at the time; such expression
  as it found was all beyond my schoolboy range. I did not know when I pleased
  her and I did not know when I distressed her. Chiefly I was aware of my
  mother as rather dull company, as a mind thorny with irrational conclusions
  and incapable of explication, as one believing quite wilfully and
  irritatingly in impossible things. So I suppose it had to be; life was coming
  to me in new forms and with new requirements. It was essential to our
  situation that we should fail to understand. After this space of years I have
  come to realisations and attitudes that dissolve my estrangement from her, I
  can pierce these barriers, I can see her and feel her as a loving and feeling
  and desiring and muddle-headed person. There are times when I would have her
  alive again, if only that I might be kind to her for a little while and give
  her some return for the narrow intense affection, the tender desires, she
  evidently lavished so abundantly on me. But then again I ask how I could make
  that return? And I realise the futility of such dreaming. Her demand was
  rigid, and to meet it I should need to act and lie.</p>

  <p>So she whose blood fed me, whose body made me, lies in my memory as I saw
  her last, fixed, still, infinitely intimate, infinitely remote...</p>

  <p>My own case with my mother, however, does not awaken the same regret I
  feel when I think of how she misjudged and irked my father, and turned his
  weaknesses into thorns for her own tormenting. I wish I could look back
  without that little twinge to two people who were both in their different
  quality so good. But goodness that is narrow is a pedestrian and ineffectual
  goodness. Her attitude to my father seems to me one of the essentially tragic
  things that have come to me personally, one of those things that nothing can
  transfigure, that REMAIN sorrowful, that I cannot soothe with any
  explanation, for as I remember him he was indeed the most lovable of weak
  spasmodic men. But my mother had been trained in a hard and narrow system
  that made evil out of many things not in the least evil, and inculcated
  neither kindliness nor charity. All their estrangement followed from
  that.</p>

  <p>These cramping cults do indeed take an enormous toll of human love and
  happiness, and not only that but what we Machiavellians must needs consider,
  they make frightful breaches in human solidarity. I suppose I am a deeply
  religious man, as men of my quality go, but I hate more and more, as I grow
  older, the shadow of intolerance cast by religious organisations. All my life
  has been darkened by irrational intolerance, by arbitrary irrational
  prohibitions and exclusions. Mahometanism with its fierce proselytism, has, I
  suppose, the blackest record of uncharitableness, but most of the Christian
  sects are tainted, tainted to a degree beyond any of the anterior paganisms,
  with this same hateful quality. It is their exclusive claim that sends them
  wrong, the vain ambition that inspires them all to teach a uniform one-sided
  God and be the one and only gateway to salvation. Deprecation of all outside
  the household of faith, an organised undervaluation of heretical goodness and
  lovableness, follows, necessarily. Every petty difference is exaggerated to
  the quality of a saving grace or a damning defect. Elaborate precautions are
  taken to shield the believer's mind against broad or amiable suggestions; the
  faithful are deterred by dark allusions, by sinister warnings, from books,
  from theatres, from worldly conversation, from all the kindly instruments
  that mingle human sympathy. For only by isolating its flock can the
  organisation survive.</p>

  <p>Every month there came to my mother a little magazine called, if I
  remember rightly, <i>The Home Churchman</i>, with the combined authority of
  print and clerical commendation. It was the most evil thing that ever came
  into the house, a very devil, a thin little pamphlet with one woodcut
  illustration on the front page of each number; now the uninviting visage of
  some exponent of the real and only doctrine and attitudes, now some coral
  strand in act of welcoming the missionaries of God's mysterious preferences,
  now a new church in the Victorian Gothic. The vile rag it was! A score of
  vices that shun the policeman have nothing of its subtle wickedness. It was
  an outrage upon the natural kindliness of men. The contents were all
  admirably adjusted to keep a spirit in prison. Their force of sustained
  suggestion was tremendous. There would be dreadful intimations of the swift
  retribution that fell upon individuals for Sabbath-breaking, and upon nations
  for weakening towards Ritualism, or treating Roman Catholics as tolerable
  human beings; there would be great rejoicings over the conversion of alleged
  Jews, and terrible descriptions of the death-beds of prominent infidels with
  boldly invented last words,&mdash;the most unscrupulous lying; there would be
  the appallingly edifying careers of "early piety" lusciously described, or
  stories of condemned criminals who traced their final ruin unerringly to
  early laxities of the kind that leads people to give up subscribing to <i>The
  Home Churchman</i>.</p>

  <p>Every month that evil spirit brought about a slump in our mutual love. My
  mother used to read the thing and become depressed and anxious for my
  spiritual welfare, used to be stirred to unintelligent pestering...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">A few years ago I met the editor of this same <i>Home
  Churchman</i>. It was at one of the weekly dinners of that Fleet Street
  dining club, the Blackfriars.</p>

  <p>I heard the paper's name with a queer little shock and surveyed the man
  with interest. No doubt he was only a successor of the purveyor of discords
  who darkened my boyhood. It was amazing to find an influence so terrible
  embodied in a creature so palpably petty. He was seated some way down a table
  at right angles to the one at which I sat, a man of mean appearance with a
  greyish complexion, thin, with a square nose, a heavy wiry moustache and a
  big Adam's apple sticking out between the wings of his collar. He ate with
  considerable appetite and unconcealed relish, and as his jaw was underhung,
  he chummed and made the moustache wave like reeds in the swell of a steamer.
  It gave him a conscientious look. After dinner he a little forced himself
  upon me. At that time, though the shadow of my scandal was already upon me, I
  still seemed to be shaping for great successes, and he was glad to be in
  conversation with me and anxious to intimate political sympathy and support.
  I tried to make him talk of <i>The Home Churchman</i> and the kindred
  publications he ran, but he was manifestly ashamed of his job so far as I was
  concerned.</p>

  <p>"One wants," he said, pitching himself as he supposed in my key, "to put
  constructive ideas into our readers, but they are narrow, you know, very
  narrow. Very." He made his moustache and lips express judicious regret. "One
  has to consider them carefully, one has to respect their attitudes. One dare
  not go too far with them. One has to feel one's way."</p>

  <p>He chummed and the moustache bristled.</p>

  <p>A hireling, beyond question, catering for a demand. I gathered there was a
  home in Tufnell Park, and three boys to be fed and clothed and
  educated...</p>

  <p>I had the curiosity to buy a copy of his magazine afterwards, and it
  seemed much the same sort of thing that had worried my mother in my boyhood.
  There was the usual Christian hero, this time with mutton-chop whiskers and a
  long bare upper lip. The Jesuits, it seemed, were still hard at it, and
  Heaven frightfully upset about the Sunday opening of museums and the falling
  birth-rate, and as touchy and vindictive as ever. There were two vigorous
  paragraphs upon the utter damnableness of the Rev. R. J. Campbell, a
  contagious damnableness I gathered, one wasn't safe within a mile of Holborn
  Viaduct, and a foul-mouthed attack on poor little Wilkins the
  novelist&mdash;who was being baited by the moralists at that time for making
  one of his big women characters, not being in holy wedlock, desire a baby and
  say so...</p>

  <p>The broadening of human thought is a slow and complex process. We do go
  on, we do get on. But when one thinks that people are living and dying now,
  quarrelling and sulking, misled and misunderstanding, vaguely fearful,
  condemning and thwarting one another in the close darknesses of these narrow
  cults&mdash;Oh, God! one wants a gale out of Heaven, one wants a great wind
  from the sea!</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">While I lived at Penge two little things happened to me,
  trivial in themselves and yet in their quality profoundly significant. They
  had this in common, that they pierced the texture of the life I was quietly
  taking for granted and let me see through it into realities&mdash;realities I
  had indeed known about before but never realised. Each of these experiences
  left me with a sense of shock, with all the values in my life perplexingly
  altered, attempting readjustment. One of these disturbing and illuminating
  events was that I was robbed of a new pocket-knife and the other that I fell
  in love. It was altogether surprising to me to be robbed. You see, as an only
  child I had always been fairly well looked after and protected, and the
  result was an amazing confidence in the practical goodness of the people one
  met in the world. I knew there were robbers in the world, just as I knew
  there were tigers; that I was ever likely to meet robber or tiger face to
  face seemed equally impossible.</p>

  <p>The knife as I remember it was a particularly jolly one with all sorts of
  instruments in it, tweezers and a thing for getting a stone out of the hoof
  of a horse, and a corkscrew; it had cost me a carefuly accumulated
  half-crown, and amounted indeed to a new experience in knives. I had had it
  for two or three days, and then one afternoon I dropped it through a hole in
  my pocket on a footpath crossing a field between Penge and Anerley. I heard
  it fall in the way one does without at the time appreciating what had
  happened, then, later, before I got home, when my hand wandered into my
  pocket to embrace the still dear new possession I found it gone, and
  instantly that memory of something hitting the ground sprang up into
  consciousness. I went back and commenced a search. Almost immediately I was
  accosted by the leader of a little gang of four or five extremely dirty and
  ragged boys of assorted sizes and slouching carriage who were coming from the
  Anerley direction.</p>

  <p>"Lost anythink, Matey?" said he.</p>

  <p>I explained.</p>

  <p>"'E's dropped 'is knife," said my interlocutor, and joined in the
  search.</p>

  <p>"What sort of 'andle was it, Matey?" said a small white-faced sniffing boy
  in a big bowler hat.</p>

  <p>I supplied the information. His sharp little face scrutinised the ground
  about us.</p>

  <p>"<i>Got</i> it," he said, and pounced.</p>

  <p>"Give it 'ere," said the big boy hoarsely, and secured it.</p>

  <p>I walked towards him serenely confident that he would hand it over to me,
  and that all was for the best in the best of all possible worlds.</p>

  <p>"No bloomin' fear!" he said, regarding me obliquely. "Oo said it was your
  knife?"</p>

  <p>Remarkable doubts assailed me. "Of course it's my knife," I said. The
  other boys gathered round me.</p>

  <p>"This ain't your knife," said the big boy, and spat casually.</p>

  <p>"I dropped it just now."</p>

  <p>"Findin's keepin's, I believe," said the big boy.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," I said. "Give me my knife."</p>

  <p>"'Ow many blades it got?"</p>

  <p>"Three."</p>

  <p>"And what sort of 'andle?"</p>

  <p>"Bone."</p>

  <p>"Got a corkscrew like?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Ah! This ain't your knife no'ow. See?"</p>

  <p>He made no offer to show it to me. My breath went.</p>

  <p>"Look here!" I said. "I saw that kid pick it up. It IS my knife."</p>

  <p>"Rot!" said the big boy, and slowly, deliberately put my knife into his
  trouser pocket.</p>

  <p>I braced my soul for battle. All civilisation was behind me, but I doubt
  if it kept the colour in my face. I buttoned my jacket and clenched my fists
  and advanced on my antagonist&mdash;he had, I suppose, the advantage of two
  years of age and three inches of height. "Hand over that knife," I said.</p>

  <p>Then one of the smallest of the band assailed me with extraordinary vigour
  and swiftness from behind, had an arm round my neck and a knee in my back
  before I had the slightest intimation of attack, and so got me down. "I got
  'im, Bill," squeaked this amazing little ruffian. My nose was flattened by a
  dirty hand, and as I struck out and hit something like sacking, some one
  kicked my elbow. Two or three seemed to be at me at the same time. Then I
  rolled over and sat up to discover them all making off, a ragged flight,
  footballing my cap, my City Merchants' cap, amongst them. I leapt to my feet
  in a passion of indignation and pursued them.</p>

  <p>But I did not overtake them. We are beings of mixed composition, and I
  doubt if mine was a single-minded pursuit. I knew that honour required me to
  pursue, and I had a vivid impression of having just been down in the dust
  with a very wiry and active and dirty little antagonist of disagreeable odour
  and incredible and incalculable unscrupulousness, kneeling on me and gripping
  my arm and neck. I wanted of course to be even with him, but also I doubted
  if catching him would necessarily involve that. They kicked my cap into the
  ditch at the end of the field, and made off compactly along a cinder lane
  while I turned aside to recover my dishonoured headdress. As I knocked the
  dust out of that and out of my jacket, and brushed my knees and readjusted my
  very crumpled collar, I tried to focus this startling occurrence in my
  mind.</p>

  <p>I had vague ideas of going to a policeman or of complaining at a police
  station, but some boyish instinct against informing prevented that. No doubt
  I entertained ideas of vindictive pursuit and murderous reprisals. And I was
  acutely enraged whenever I thought of my knife. The thing indeed rankled in
  my mind for weeks and weeks, and altered all the flavour of my world for me.
  It was the first time I glimpsed the simple brute violence that lurks and
  peeps beneath our civilisation. A certain kindly complacency of attitude
  towards the palpably lower classes was qualified for ever.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">But the other experience was still more cardinal. It was the
  first clear intimation of a new motif in life, the sex motif, that was to
  rise and increase and accumulate power and enrichment and interweave with and
  at last dominate all my life.</p>

  <p>It was when I was nearly fifteen this happened. It is inseparably
  connected in my mind with the dusk of warm September evenings. I never met
  the girl I loved by daylight, and I have forgotten her name. It was some
  insignificant name.</p>

  <p>Yet the peculiar quality of the adventure keeps it shining darkly like
  some deep coloured gem in the common setting of my memories. It came as
  something new and strange, something that did not join on to anything else in
  my life or connect with any of my thoughts or beliefs or habits; it was a
  wonder, a mystery, a discovery about myself, a discovery about the whole
  world. Only in after years did sexual feeling lose that isolation and spread
  itself out to illuminate and pervade and at last possess the whole broad
  vision of life.</p>

  <p>It was in that phase of an urban youth's development, the phase of the
  cheap cigarette, that this thing happened. One evening I came by chance on a
  number of young people promenading by the light of a row of shops towards
  Beckington, and, with all the glory of a glowing cigarette between my lips, I
  joined their strolling number. These twilight parades of young people,
  youngsters chiefly of the lower middle-class, are one of the odd social
  developments of the great suburban growths&mdash;unkindly critics, blind to
  the inner meanings of things, call them, I believe, Monkeys'
  Parades&mdash;the shop apprentices, the young work girls, the boy clerks and
  so forth, stirred by mysterious intimations, spend their first-earned money
  upon collars and ties, chiffon hats, smart lace collars, walking-sticks,
  sunshades or cigarettes, and come valiantly into the vague transfiguring
  mingling of gaslight and evening, to walk up and down, to eye meaningly, even
  to accost and make friends. It is a queer instinctive revolt from the narrow
  limited friendless homes in which so many find themselves, a going out
  towards something, romance if you will, beauty, that has suddenly become a
  need&mdash;a need that hitherto has lain dormant and unsuspected. They
  promenade.</p>

  <p>Vulgar!&mdash;it is as vulgar as the spirit that calls the moth abroad in
  the evening and lights the body of the glow-worm in the night. I made my way
  through the throng, a little contemptuously as became a public schoolboy, my
  hands in my pockets&mdash;none of your cheap canes for me!&mdash;and very
  careful of the lie of my cigarette upon my lips. And two girls passed me, one
  a little taller than the other, with dim warm-tinted faces under clouds of
  dark hair and with dark eyes like pools reflecting stars.</p>

  <p>I half turned, and the shorter one glanced back at me over her shoulder
  &mdash;I could draw you now the pose of her cheek and neck and shoulder
  &mdash;and instantly I was as passionately in love with the girl as I have
  ever been before or since, as any man ever was with any woman. I turned about
  and followed them, I flung away my cigarette ostentatiously and lifted my
  school cap and spoke to them.</p>

  <p>The girl answered shyly with her dark eyes on my face. What I said and
  what she said I cannot remember, but I have little doubt it was something
  absolutely vapid. It really did not matter; the thing was we had met. I felt
  as I think a new-hatched moth must feel when suddenly its urgent headlong
  searching brings it in tremulous amazement upon its mate.</p>

  <p>We met, covered from each other, with all the nets of civilisation keeping
  us apart. We walked side by side.</p>

  <p>It led to scarcely more than that. I think we met four or five times
  altogether, and always with her nearly silent elder sister on the other side
  of her. We walked on the last two occasions arm in arm, furtively caressing
  each other's hands, we went away from the glare of the shops into the quiet
  roads of villadom, and there we whispered instead of talking and looked
  closely into one another's warm and shaded face. "Dear," I whispered very
  daringly, and she answered, "Dear!" We had a vague sense that we wanted more
  of that quality of intimacy and more. We wanted each other as one wants
  beautiful music again or to breathe again the scent of flowers.</p>

  <p>And that is all there was between us. The events are nothing, the thing
  that matters is the way in which this experience stabbed through the common
  stuff of life and left it pierced, with a light, with a huge new interest
  shining through the rent.</p>

  <p>When I think of it I can recall even now the warm mystery of her face, her
  lips a little apart, lips that I never kissed, her soft shadowed throat, and
  I feel again the sensuous stir of her proximity...</p>

  <p>Those two girls never told me their surname nor let me approach their
  house. They made me leave them at the corner of a road of small houses near
  Penge Station. And quite abruptly, without any intimation, they vanished and
  came to the meeting place no more, they vanished as a moth goes out of a
  window into the night, and left me possessed of an intolerable want...</p>

  <p>The affair pervaded my existence for many weeks. I could not do my work
  and I could not rest at home. Night after night I promenaded up and down that
  Monkeys' Parade full of an unappeasable desire, with a thwarted sense of
  something just begun that ought to have gone on. I went backwards and
  forwards on the way to the vanishing place, and at last explored the
  forbidden road that had swallowed them up. But I never saw her again, except
  that later she came to me, my symbol of womanhood, in dreams. How my blood
  was stirred! I lay awake of nights whispering in the darkness for her. I
  prayed for her.</p>

  <p>Indeed that girl, who probably forgot the last vestiges of me when her
  first real kiss came to her, ruled and haunted me, gave a Queen to my
  imagination and a texture to all my desires until I became a man.</p>

  <p>I generalised her at last. I suddenly discovered that poetry was about her
  and that she was the key to all that had hitherto seemed nonsense about love.
  I took to reading novels, and if the heroine could not possibly be like her,
  dusky and warm and starlike, I put the book aside...</p>

  <p>I hesitate and add here one other confession. I want to tell this thing
  because it seems to me we are altogether too restrained and secretive about
  such matters. The cardinal thing in life sneaks in to us darkly and
  shamefully like a thief in the night.</p>

  <p>One day during my Cambridge days&mdash;it must have been in my first year
  before I knew Hatherleigh&mdash;I saw in a print-shop window near the Strand
  an engraving of a girl that reminded me sharply of Penge and its dusky
  encounter. It was just a half length of a bare-shouldered, bare-breasted
  Oriental with arms akimbo, smiling faintly. I looked at it, went my way, then
  turned back and bought it. I felt I must have it. The odd thing is that I was
  more than a little shamefaced about it. I did not have it framed and hung in
  my room open to the criticism of my friends, but I kept it in the drawer of
  my writing-table. And I kept that drawer locked for a year. It speedily
  merged with and became identified with the dark girl of Penge. That engraving
  became in a way my mistress. Often when I had sported my oak and was supposed
  to be reading, I was sitting with it before me.</p>

  <p>Obeying some instinct I kept the thing very secret indeed. For a time
  nobody suspected what was locked in my drawer nor what was locked in me. I
  seemed as sexless as my world required.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">These things stabbed through my life, intimations of things
  above and below and before me. They had an air of being no more than
  incidents, interruptions.</p>

  <p>The broad substance of my existence at this time was the City Merchants
  School. Home was a place where I slept and read, and the mooning explorations
  of the south-eastern postal district which occupied the restless evenings and
  spare days of my vacations mere interstices, giving glimpses of enigmatical
  lights and distant spaces between the woven threads of a school-boy's career.
  School life began for me every morning at Herne Hill, for there I was joined
  by three or four other boys and the rest of the way we went together. Most of
  the streets and roads we traversed in our morning's walk from Victoria are
  still intact, the storms of rebuilding that have submerged so much of my
  boyhood's London have passed and left them, and I have revived the impression
  of them again and again in recent years as I have clattered dinnerward in a
  hansom or hummed along in a motor cab to some engagement. The main gate still
  looks out with the same expression of ancient well-proportioned kindliness
  upon St. Margaret's Close. There are imposing new science laboratories in
  Chambers Street indeed, but the old playing fields are unaltered except for
  the big electric trams that go droning and spitting blue flashes along the
  western boundary. I know Ratten, the new Head, very well, but I have not been
  inside the school to see if it has changed at all since I went up to
  Cambridge.</p>

  <p>I took all they put before us very readily as a boy, for I had a mind of
  vigorous appetite, but since I have grown mentally to man's estate and
  developed a more and more comprehensive view of our national process and our
  national needs, I am more and more struck by the oddity of the educational
  methods pursued, their aimless disconnectedness from the constructive forces
  in the community. I suppose if we are to view the public school as anything
  more than an institution that has just chanced to happen, we must treat it as
  having a definite function towards the general scheme of the nation, as being
  in a sense designed to take the crude young male of the more or less
  responsible class, to correct his harsh egotisms, broaden his outlook, give
  him a grasp of the contemporary developments he will presently be called upon
  to influence and control, and send him on to the university to be made a
  leading and ruling social man. It is easy enough to carp at schoolmasters and
  set up for an Educational Reformer, I know, but still it is impossible not to
  feel how infinitely more effectually&mdash;given certain impossibilities
  perhaps&mdash;the job might be done.</p>

  <p>My memory of school has indeed no hint whatever of that quality of
  elucidation it seems reasonable to demand from it. Here all about me was
  London, a vast inexplicable being, a vortex of gigantic forces, that filled
  and overwhelmed me with impressions, that stirred my imagination to a
  perpetual vague enquiry; and my school not only offered no key to it, but had
  practically no comment to make upon it at all. We were within three miles of
  Westminster and Charing Cross, the government offices of a fifth of mankind
  were all within an hour's stroll, great economic changes were going on under
  our eyes, now the hoardings flamed with election placards, now the Salvation
  Army and now the unemployed came trailing in procession through the
  winter-grey streets, now the newspaper placards outside news-shops told of
  battles in strange places, now of amazing discoveries, now of sinister
  crimes, abject squalor and poverty, imperial splendour and luxury, Buckingham
  Palace, Rotten Row, Mayfair, the slums of Pimlico, garbage-littered streets
  of bawling costermongers, the inky silver of the barge-laden
  Thames&mdash;such was the background of our days. We went across St.
  Margaret's Close and through the school gate into a quiet puerile world apart
  from all these things. We joined in the earnest acquirement of all that was
  necessary for Greek epigrams and Latin verse, and for the rest played games.
  We dipped down into something clear and elegantly proportioned and time-worn
  and for all its high resolve of stalwart virility a little feeble, like our
  blackened and decayed portals by Inigo Jones.</p>

  <p>Within, we were taught as the chief subjects of instruction, Latin and
  Greek. We were taught very badly because the men who taught us did not
  habitually use either of these languages, nobody uses them any more now
  except perhaps for the Latin of a few Levantine monasteries. At the utmost
  our men read them. We were taught these languages because long ago Latin had
  been the language of civilisation; the one way of escape from the narrow and
  localised life had lain in those days through Latin, and afterwards Greek had
  come in as the vehicle of a flood of new and amazing ideas. Once these two
  languages had been the sole means of initiation to the detached criticism and
  partial comprehension of the world. I can imagine the fierce zeal of our
  first Heads, Gardener and Roper, teaching Greek like passionate missionaries,
  as a progressive Chinaman might teach English to the boys of Pekin, clumsily,
  impatiently, with rod and harsh urgency, but sincerely, patriotically,
  because they felt that behind it lay revelations, the irresistible stimulus
  to a new phase of history. That was long ago. A new great world, a vaster
  Imperialism had arisen about the school, had assimilated all these amazing
  and incredible ideas, had gone on to new and yet more amazing developments of
  its own. But the City Merchants School still made the substance of its
  teaching Latin and Greek, still, with no thought of rotating crops, sowed in
  a dream amidst the harvesting.</p>

  <p>There is no fierceness left in the teaching now. Just after I went up to
  Trinity, Gates, our Head, wrote a review article in defence of our
  curriculum. In this, among other indiscretions, he asserted that it was
  impossible to write good English without an illuminating knowledge of the
  classic tongues, and he split an infinitive and failed to button up a
  sentence in saying so. His main argument conceded every objection a
  reasonable person could make to the City Merchants' curriculum. He admitted
  that translation had now placed all the wisdom of the past at a common man's
  disposal, that scarcely a field of endeavour remained in which modern work
  had not long since passed beyond the ancient achievement. He disclaimed any
  utility. But there was, he said, a peculiar magic in these grammatical
  exercises no other subjects of instruction possessed. Nothing else provided
  the same strengthening and orderly discipline for the mind.</p>

  <p>He said that, knowing the Senior Classics he did, himself a Senior
  Classic!</p>

  <p>Yet in a dim confused way I think he was making out a case. In schools as
  we knew them, and with the sort of assistant available, the sort of assistant
  who has been trained entirely on the old lines, he could see no other
  teaching so effectual in developing attention, restraint, sustained
  constructive effort and various yet systematic adjustment. And that was as
  far as his imagination could go.</p>

  <p>It is infinitely easier to begin organised human affairs than end them;
  the curriculum and the social organisation of the English public school are
  the crowning instances of that. They go on because they have begun. Schools
  are not only immortal institutions but reproductive ones. Our founder, Jabez
  Arvon, knew nothing, I am sure, of Gates' pedagogic values and would, I feel
  certain, have dealt with them disrespectfully. But public schools and
  university colleges sprang into existence correlated, the scholars went on to
  the universities and came back to teach the schools, to teach as they
  themselves had been taught, before they had ever made any real use of the
  teaching; the crowd of boys herded together, a crowd perpetually renewed and
  unbrokenly the same, adjusted itself by means of spontaneously developed
  institutions. In a century, by its very success, this revolutionary
  innovation of Renascence public schools had become an immense tradition woven
  closely into the fabric of the national life. Intelligent and powerful people
  ceased to talk Latin or read Greek, they had got what was wanted, but that
  only left the schoolmaster the freer to elaborate his point. Since most men
  of any importance or influence in the country had been through the mill, it
  was naturally a little difficult to persuade them that it was not quite the
  best and most ennobling mill the wit of man could devise. And, moreover, they
  did not want their children made strange to them. There was all the machinery
  and all the men needed to teach the old subjects, and none to teach whatever
  new the critic might propose. Such science instruction as my father gave
  seemed indeed the uninviting alternative to the classical grind. It was
  certainly an altogether inferior instrument at that time.</p>

  <p>So it was I occupied my mind with the exact study of dead languages for
  seven long years. It was the strangest of detachments. We would sit under the
  desk of such a master as Topham like creatures who had fallen into an
  enchanted pit, and he would do his considerable best to work us up to
  enthusiasm for, let us say, a Greek play. If we flagged he would lash himself
  to revive us. He would walk about the class-room mouthing great lines in a
  rich roar, and asking us with a flushed face and shining eyes if it was not
  "<i>glorious</i>." The very sight of Greek letters brings back to me the
  dingy, faded, ink-splashed quality of our class-room, the banging of books,
  Topham's disordered hair, the sheen of his alpaca gown, his deep unmusical
  intonations and the wide striding of his creaking boots. Glorious! And being
  plastic human beings we would consent that it was glorious, and some of us
  even achieved an answering reverberation and a sympathetic flush. I at times
  responded freely. We all accepted from him unquestioningly that these
  melodies, these strange sounds, exceeded any possibility of beauty that lay
  in the Gothic intricacy, the splash and glitter, the jar and recovery, the
  stabbing lights, the heights and broad distances of our English tongue. That
  indeed was the chief sin of him. It was not that he was for Greek and Latin,
  but that he was fiercely against every beauty that was neither classic nor
  deferred to classical canons.</p>

  <p>And what exactly did we make of it, we seniors who understood it best? We
  visualised dimly through that dust and the grammatical difficulties, the
  spectacle of the chorus chanting grotesquely, helping out protagonist and
  antagonist, masked and buskined, with the telling of incomprehensible
  parricides, of inexplicable incest, of gods faded beyond symbolism, of that
  Relentless Law we did not believe in for a moment, that no modern western
  European can believe in. We thought of the characters in the unconvincing
  wigs and costumes of our school performance. No Gilbert Murray had come as
  yet to touch these things to life again. It was like the ghost of an
  antiquarian's toy theatre, a ghost that crumbled and condensed into a gritty
  dust of construing as one looked at it.</p>

  <p>Marks, shindies, prayers and punishments, all flavoured with the leathery
  stuffiness of time-worn Big Hall...</p>

  <p>And then out one would come through our grey old gate into the evening
  light and the spectacle of London hurrying like a cataract, London in black
  and brown and blue and gleaming silver, roaring like the very loom of Time.
  We came out into the new world no teacher has yet had the power and courage
  to grasp and expound. Life and death sang all about one, joys and fears on
  such a scale, in such an intricacy as never Greek nor Roman knew. The
  interminable procession of horse omnibuses went lumbering past, bearing
  countless people we knew not whence, we knew not whither. Hansoms clattered,
  foot passengers jostled one, a thousand appeals of shop and boarding caught
  the eye. The multi-coloured lights of window and street mingled with the warm
  glow of the declining day under the softly flushing London skies; the
  ever-changing placards, the shouting news-vendors, told of a kaleidoscopic
  drama all about the globe. One did not realise what had happened to us, but
  the voice of Topham was suddenly drowned and lost, he and his minute, remote
  gesticulations...</p>

  <p>That submerged and isolated curriculum did not even join on to living
  interests where it might have done so. We were left absolutely to the hints
  of the newspapers, to casual political speeches, to the cartoons of the comic
  papers or a chance reading of some Socialist pamphlet for any general ideas
  whatever about the huge swirling world process in which we found ourselves. I
  always look back with particular exasperation to the cessation of our modern
  history at the year 1815. There it pulled up abruptly, as though it had come
  upon something indelicate...</p>

  <p>But, after all, what would Topham or Flack have made of the huge
  adjustments of the nineteenth century? Flack was the chief cricketer on the
  staff; he belonged to that great cult which pretends that the place of this
  or that county in the struggle for the championship is a matter of supreme
  importance to boys. He obliged us to affect a passionate interest in the
  progress of county matches, to work up unnatural enthusiasms. What a fuss
  there would be when some well-trained boy, panting as if from Marathon,
  appeared with an evening paper! "I say, you chaps, Middlesex all out for a
  hundred and five!"</p>

  <p>Under Flack's pressure I became, I confess, a cricket humbug of the first
  class. I applied myself industriously year by year to mastering scores and
  averages; I pretended that Lords or the Oval were the places nearest Paradise
  for me. (I never went to either.) Through a slight mistake about the county
  boundary I adopted Surrey for my loyalty, though as a matter of fact we were
  by some five hundred yards or so in Kent. It did quite as well for my
  purposes. I bowled rather straight and fast, and spent endless hours
  acquiring the skill to bowl Flack out. He was a bat in the Corinthian style,
  rich and voluminous, and succumbed very easily to a low shooter or an
  unexpected Yorker, but usually he was caught early by long leg. The
  difficulty was to bowl him before he got caught. He loved to lift a ball to
  leg. After one had clean bowled him at the practice nets one deliberately
  gave him a ball to leg just to make him feel nice again.</p>

  <p>Flack went about a world of marvels dreaming of leg hits. He has been
  observed, going across the Park on his way to his highly respectable club in
  Piccadilly, to break from profound musings into a strange brief dance that
  ended with an imaginary swipe with his umbrella, a roofer, over the trees
  towards Buckingham Palace. The hit accomplished, Flack resumed his way.</p>

  <p>Inadequately instructed foreigners would pass him in terror, needlessly
  alert.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">These schoolmasters move through my memory as always a
  little distant and more than a little incomprehensible. Except when they wore
  flannels, I saw them almost always in old college caps and gowns, a uniform
  which greatly increased their detachment from the world of actual men. Gates,
  the head, was a lean loose-limbed man, rather stupid I discovered when I
  reached the Sixth and came into contact with him, but honest, simple and very
  eager to be liberal-minded. He was bald, with an almost conical baldness,
  with a grizzled pointed beard, small featured and, under the stresses of a
  Zeitgeist that demanded liberality, with an expression of puzzled but
  resolute resistance to his own unalterable opinions. He made a tall dignified
  figure in his gown. In my junior days he spoke to me only three or four
  times, and then he annoyed me by giving me a wrong surname; it was a sore
  point because I was an outsider and not one of the old school families, the
  Shoesmiths, the Naylors, the Marklows, the Tophams, the Pevises and suchlike,
  who came generation after generation. I recall him most vividly against the
  background of faded brown book-backs in the old library in which we less
  destructive seniors were trusted to work, with the light from the
  stained-glass window falling in coloured patches on his face. It gave him the
  appearance of having no colour of his own. He had a habit of scratching the
  beard on his cheek as he talked, and he used to come and consult us about
  things and invariably do as we said. That, in his phraseology, was
  "maintaining the traditions of the school."</p>

  <p>He had indeed an effect not of a man directing a school, but of a man
  captured and directed by a school. Dead and gone Elizabethans had begotten a
  monster that could carry him about in its mouth.</p>

  <p>Yet being a man, as I say, with his hair a little stirred by a Zeitgeist
  that made for change, Gates did at times display a disposition towards
  developments. City Merchants had no modern side, and utilitarian spirits were
  carping in <i>The Pall Mall Gazette</i> and elsewhere at the omissions from
  our curriculum, and particularly at our want of German. Moreover, four
  classes still worked together with much clashing and uproar in the old Big
  Hall that had once held in a common tumult the entire school. Gates used to
  come and talk to us older fellows about these things.</p>

  <p>"I don't wish to innovate unduly," he used to say. "But we ought to get in
  some German, you know,&mdash;for those who like it. The army men will be
  wanting it some of these days."</p>

  <p>He referred to the organisation of regular evening preparation for the
  lower boys in Big Hall as a "revolutionary change," but he achieved it, and
  he declared he began the replacement of the hacked wooden tables, at which
  the boys had worked since Tudor days, by sloping desks with safety inkpots
  and scientifically adjustable seats, "with grave misgivings." And though he
  never birched a boy in his life, and was, I am convinced, morally incapable
  of such a scuffle, he retained the block and birch in the school through all
  his term of office, and spoke at the Headmasters' Conference in temperate
  approval of corporal chastisement, comparing it, dear soul! to the power of
  the sword...</p>

  <p>I wish I could, in some measure and without tediousness, convey the effect
  of his discourses to General Assembly in Big Hall. But that is like trying to
  draw the obverse and reverse of a sixpence worn to complete illegibility. His
  tall fine figure stood high on the days, his thoughtful tenor filled the air
  as he steered his hazardous way through sentences that dragged inconclusive
  tails and dropped redundant prepositions. And he pleaded ever so urgently,
  ever so finely, that what we all knew for Sin was sinful, and on the whole
  best avoided altogether, and so went on with deepening notes and even with
  short arresting gestures of the right arm and hand, to stir and exhort us
  towards goodness, towards that modern, unsectarian goodness, goodness in
  general and nothing in particular, which the Zeitgeist seemed to indicate in
  those transitional years.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">The school never quite got hold of me. Partly I think that
  was because I was a day-boy and so freer than most of the boys, partly
  because of a temperamental disposition to see things in my own way and have
  my private dreams, partly because I was a little antagonised by the family
  traditions that ran through the school. I was made to feel at first that I
  was a rank outsider, and I never quite forgot it. I suffered very little
  bullying, and I never had a fight&mdash;in all my time there were only three
  fights&mdash;but I followed my own curiosities. I was already a very keen
  theologian and politician before I was fifteen. I was also intensely
  interested in modern warfare. I read the morning papers in the Reading Room
  during the midday recess, never missed the illustrated weeklies, and often
  when I could afford it I bought a <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> on my way
  home.</p>

  <p>I do not think that I was very exceptional in that; most intelligent boys,
  I believe, want naturally to be men, and are keenly interested in men's
  affairs. There is not the universal passion for a magnified puerility among
  them it is customary to assume. I was indeed a voracious reader of everything
  but boys' books&mdash;which I detested&mdash;and fiction. I read histories,
  travel, popular science and controversy with particular zest, and I loved
  maps. School work and school games were quite subordinate affairs for me. I
  worked well and made a passable figure at games, and I do not think I was
  abnormally insensitive to the fine quality of our school, to the charm of its
  mediaeval nucleus, its Gothic cloisters, its scraps of Palladian and its
  dignified Georgian extensions; the contrast of the old quiet, that in spite
  of our presence pervaded it everywhere, with the rushing and impending London
  all about it, was indeed a continual pleasure to me. But these things were
  certainly not the living and central interests of my life.</p>

  <p>I had to conceal my wider outlook to a certain extent&mdash;from the
  masters even more than from the boys. Indeed I only let myself go freely with
  one boy, Britten, my especial chum, the son of the Agent-General for East
  Australia. We two discovered in a chance conversation A PROPOS of a map in
  the library that we were both of us curious why there were Malays in
  Madagascar, and how the Mecca pilgrims came from the East Indies before
  steamships were available. Neither of us had suspected that there was any one
  at all in the school who knew or cared a rap about the Indian Ocean, except
  as water on the way to India. But Britten had come up through the Suez Canal,
  and his ship had spoken a pilgrim ship on the way. It gave him a startling
  quality of living knowledge. From these pilgrims we got to a comparative
  treatment of religions, and from that, by a sudden plunge, to entirely
  sceptical and disrespectful confessions concerning Gates' last outbreak of
  simple piety in School Assembly. We became congenial intimates from that
  hour.</p>

  <p>The discovery of Britten happened to me when we were both in the Lower
  Fifth. Previously there had been a watertight compartment between the books I
  read and the thoughts they begot on the one hand and human intercourse on the
  other. Now I really began my higher education, and aired and examined and
  developed in conversation the doubts, the ideas, the interpretations that had
  been forming in my mind. As we were both day-boys with a good deal of control
  over our time we organised walks and expeditions together, and my habit of
  solitary and rather vague prowling gave way to much more definite joint
  enterprises. I went several times to his house, he was the youngest of
  several brothers, one of whom was a medical student and let us assist at the
  dissection of a cat, and once or twice in vacation time he came to Penge, and
  we went with parcels of provisions to do a thorough day in the grounds and
  galleries of the Crystal Palace, ending with the fireworks at close quarters.
  We went in a river steamboat down to Greenwich, and fired by that made an
  excursion to Margate and back; we explored London docks and Bethnal Green
  Museum, Petticoat Lane and all sorts of out-of-the-way places together.</p>

  <p>We confessed shyly to one another a common secret vice, "Phantom warfare."
  When we walked alone, especially in the country, we had both developed the
  same practice of fighting an imaginary battle about us as we walked. As we
  went along we were generals, and our attacks pushed along on either side,
  crouching and gathering behind hedges, cresting ridges, occupying copses,
  rushing open spaces, fighting from house to house. The hillsides about Penge
  were honeycombed in my imagination with the pits and trenches I had created
  to check a victorious invader coming out of Surrey. For him West Kensington
  was chiefly important as the scene of a desperate and successful last stand
  of insurrectionary troops (who had seized the Navy, the Bank and other
  advantages) against a royalist army&mdash;reinforced by
  Germans&mdash;advancing for reasons best known to themselves by way of Harrow
  and Ealing. It is a secret and solitary game, as we found when we tried to
  play it together. We made a success of that only once. All the way down to
  Margate we schemed defences and assailed and fought them as we came back
  against the sunset. Afterwards we recapitulated all that conflict by means of
  a large scale map of the Thames and little paper ironclads in plan cut out of
  paper.</p>

  <p>A subsequent revival of these imaginings was brought about by Britten's
  luck in getting, through a friend of his father's, admission for us both to
  the spectacle of volunteer officers fighting the war game in Caxton Hall. We
  developed a war game of our own at Britten's home with nearly a couple of
  hundred lead soldiers, some excellent spring cannons that shot hard and true
  at six yards, hills of books and a constantly elaborated set of rules. For
  some months that occupied an immense proportion of our leisure. Some of our
  battles lasted several days. We kept the game a profound secret from the
  other fellows. They would not have understood.</p>

  <p>And we also began, it was certainly before we were sixteen, to write, for
  the sake of writing. We liked writing. We had discovered Lamb and the best of
  the middle articles in such weeklies as <i>The Saturday Gazette</i>, and we
  imitated them. Our minds were full of dim uncertain things we wanted to drag
  out into the light of expression. Britten had got hold of <i>In Memoriam</i>,
  and I had disinterred Pope's <i>Essay on Man</i> and <i>Rabbi Ben Ezra</i>,
  and these things had set our theological and cosmic solicitudes talking. I
  was somewhere between sixteen and eighteen, I know, when he and I walked
  along the Thames Embankment confessing shamefully to one another that we had
  never read Lucretius. We thought every one who mattered had read
  Lucretius.</p>

  <p>When I was nearly sixteen my mother was taken ill very suddenly, and died
  of some perplexing complaint that involved a post-mortem examination; it was,
  I think, the trouble that has since those days been recognised as
  appendicitis. This led to a considerable change in my circumstances; the
  house at Penge was given up, and my Staffordshire uncle arranged for me to
  lodge during school terms with a needy solicitor and his wife in Vicars
  Street, S. W., about a mile and a half from the school. So it was I came
  right into London; I had almost two years of London before I went to
  Cambridge.</p>

  <p>Those were our great days together. Afterwards we were torn apart; Britten
  went to Oxford, and our circumstances never afterwards threw us continuously
  together until the days of <i>The Blue Weekly</i>.</p>

  <p>As boys, we walked together, read and discussed the same books, pursued
  the same enquiries. We got a reputation as inseparables and the nickname of
  the Rose and the Lily, for Britten was short and thick-set with dark close
  curling hair and a ruddy Irish type of face; I was lean and fair-haired and
  some inches taller than he. Our talk ranged widely and yet had certain very
  definite limitations. We were amazingly free with politics and religion, we
  went to that little meeting-house of William Morris's at Hammersmith and
  worked out the principles of Socialism pretty thoroughly, and we got up the
  Darwinian theory with the help of Britten's medical-student brother and the
  galleries of the Natural History Museum in Cromwell Road. Those wonderful
  cases on the ground floor illustrating mimicry, dimorphism and so forth, were
  new in our times, and we went through them with earnest industry and tried
  over our Darwinism in the light of that. Such topics we did exhaustively. But
  on the other hand I do not remember any discussion whatever of human sex or
  sexual relationships. There, in spite of intense secret curiosities, our lips
  were sealed by a peculiar shyness. And I do not believe we ever had occasion
  either of us to use the word "love." It was not only that we were
  instinctively shy of the subject, but that we were mightily ashamed of the
  extent of our ignorance and uncertainty in these matters. We evaded them
  elaborately with an assumption of exhaustive knowledge.</p>

  <p>We certainly had no shyness about theology. We marked the emancipation of
  our spirits from the frightful teachings that had oppressed our boyhood, by
  much indulgence in blasphemous wit. We had a secret literature of irreverent
  rhymes, and a secret art of theological caricature. Britten's father had
  delighted his family by reading aloud from Dr. Richard Garnett's <i>Twilight
  of the Gods</i>, and Britten conveyed the precious volume to me. That and
  <i>The Bab Ballads</i> were the inspiration of some of our earliest
  lucubrations.</p>

  <p>For an imaginative boy the first experience of writing is like a tiger's
  first taste of blood, and our literary flowerings led very directly to the
  revival of the school magazine, which had been comatose for some years. But
  there we came upon a disappointment.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 8</h3>

  <p class="first">In that revival we associated certain other of the Sixth
  Form boys, and notably one for whom our enterprise was to lay the foundations
  of a career that has ended in the House of Lords, Arthur Cossington, now Lord
  Paddockhurst. Cossington was at that time a rather heavy, rather good-looking
  boy who was chiefly eminent in cricket, an outsider even as we were and
  preoccupied no doubt, had we been sufficiently detached to observe him, with
  private imaginings very much of the same quality and spirit as our own. He
  was, we were inclined to think, rather a sentimentalist, rather a poseur, he
  affected a concise emphatic style, played chess very well, betrayed a belief
  in will-power, and earned Britten's secret hostility, Britten being a sloven,
  by the invariable neatness of his collars and ties. He came into our magazine
  with a vigour that we found extremely surprising and unwelcome.</p>

  <p>Britten and I had wanted to write. We had indeed figured our project
  modestly as a manuscript magazine of satirical, liberal and brilliant
  literature by which in some rather inexplicable way the vague tumult of ideas
  that teemed within us was to find form and expression; Cossington, it was
  manifest from the outset, wanted neither to write nor writing, but a
  magazine. I remember the inaugural meeting in Shoesmith major's
  study&mdash;we had had great trouble in getting it together&mdash;and how
  effectually Cossington bolted with the proposal.</p>

  <p>"I think we fellows ought to run a magazine," said Cossington. "The school
  used to have one. A school like this ought to have a magazine."</p>

  <p>"The last one died in '84," said Shoesmith from the hearthrug. "Called
  <i>The Observer</i>. Rot rather."</p>

  <p>"Bad title," said Cossington.</p>

  <p>"There was a <i>Tatler</i> before that," said Britten, sitting on the
  writing table at the window that was closed to deaden the cries of the Lower
  School at play, and clashing his boots together.</p>

  <p>"We want something suggestive of City Merchants."</p>

  <p>"<i>City Merchandize</i>," said Britten.</p>

  <p>"Too fanciful. What of <i>Arvonian</i>? Richard Arvon was our founder, and
  it seems almost a duty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They call them all -usians or -onians," said Britten.</p>

  <p>"I like <i>City Merchandize</i>," I said. "We could probably find a
  quotation to suggest&mdash;oh! mixed good things."</p>

  <p>Cossington regarded me abstractedly.</p>

  <p>"Don't want to put the accent on the City, do we?" said Shoesmith, who had
  a feeling for county families, and Naylor supported him by a murmur of
  approval.</p>

  <p>"We ought to call it <i>The Arvonian</i>," decided Cossington, "and we
  might very well have underneath, 'With which is incorporated <i>The
  Observer</i>.' That picks up the old traditions, makes an appeal to old boys
  and all that, and it gives us something to print under the title."</p>

  <p>I still held out for <i>City Merchandize</i>, which had taken my fancy.
  "Some of the chaps' people won't like it," said Naylor, "certain not to. And
  it sounds Rum."</p>

  <p>"Sounds Weird," said a boy who had not hitherto spoken.</p>

  <p>"We aren't going to do anything Queer," said Shoesmith, pointedly not
  looking at Britten.</p>

  <p>The question of the title had manifestly gone against us. "Oh! <i>Have</i>
  it <i>Arvonian</i>," I said.</p>

  <p>"And next, what size shall we have?" said Cossington.</p>

  <p>"Something like <i>Macmillan's Magazine</i>&mdash;or <i>Longmans'</i>';
  <i>Longmans'</i> is better because it has a whole page, not columns. It makes
  no end of difference to one's effects."</p>

  <p>"What effects?" asked Shoesmith abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Oh! a pause or a white line or anything. You've got to write closer for a
  double column. It's nuggetty. You can't get a swing on your prose." I had
  discussed this thoroughly with Britten.</p>

  <p>"If the fellows are going to write&mdash;" began Britten.</p>

  <p>"We ought to keep off fine writing," said Shoesmith. "It's cheek. I vote
  we don't have any."</p>

  <p>"We sha'n't get any," said Cossington, and then as an olive branch to me,
  "unless Remington does a bit. Or Britten. But it's no good making too much
  space for it."</p>

  <p>"We ought to be very careful about the writing," said Shoesmith. "We don't
  want to give ourselves away."</p>

  <p>"I vote we ask old Topham to see us through," said Naylor.</p>

  <p>Britten groaned aloud and every one regarded him. "Greek epigrams on the
  fellows' names," he said. "Small beer in ancient bottles. Let's get a stuffed
  broody hen to <i>sit</i> on the magazine."</p>

  <p>"We might do worse than a Greek epigram," said Cossington. "One in each
  number. It&mdash;it impresses parents and keeps up our classical tradition.
  And the masters <i>can</i> help. We don't want to antagonise them. Of
  course&mdash;we've got to departmentalise. Writing is only one section of the
  thing. <i>The Arvonian</i> has to stand for the school. There's questions of
  space and questions of expense. We can't turn out a great chunk of printed
  prose like&mdash;like wet cold toast and call it a magazine."</p>

  <p>Britten writhed, appreciating the image.</p>

  <p>"There's to be a section of sports. <i>You</i> must do that."</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to do any fine writing," said Shoesmith.</p>

  <p>"What you've got to do is just to list all the chaps and put a note to
  their play:&mdash;'Naylor minor must pass more. Football isn't the place for
  extreme individualism.' 'Ammersham shapes well as half-back.' Things like
  that."</p>

  <p>"I could do that all right," said Shoesmith, brightening and manifestly
  becoming pregnant with judgments.</p>

  <p>"One great thing about a magazine of this sort," said Cossington, "is to
  mention just as many names as you can in each number. It keeps the interest
  alive. Chaps will turn it over looking for their own little bit. Then it all
  lights up for them."</p>

  <p>"Do you want any reports of matches?" Shoesmith broke from his
  meditation.</p>

  <p>"Rather. With comments."</p>

  <p>"Naylor surpassed himself and negotiated the lemon safely home," said
  Shoesmith.</p>

  <p>"Shut it," said Naylor modestly.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Cossington. "That gives us three features," touching them
  off on his fingers, "Epigram, Literary Section, Sports. Then we want a
  section to shove anything into, a joke, a notice of anything that's going on.
  So on. Our Note Book."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Hell!" said Britten, and clashed his boots, to the silent disapproval
  of every one.</p>

  <p>"Then we want an editorial."</p>

  <p>"A <i>what</i>?" cried Britten, with a note of real terror in his
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Well, don't we? Unless we have our Note Book to begin on the front page.
  It gives a scrappy effect to do that. We want something manly and
  straightforward and a bit thoughtful, about Patriotism, say, or <i>esprit de
  corps</i>, or After-Life."</p>

  <p>I looked at Britten. Hitherto we had not considered Cossington mattered
  very much in the world.</p>

  <p>He went over us as a motor-car goes over a dog. There was a sort of energy
  about him, a new sort of energy to us; we had never realised that anything of
  the sort existed in the world. We were hopelessly at a disadvantage. Almost
  instantly we had developed a clear and detailed vision of a magazine made up
  of everything that was most acceptable in the magazines that flourished in
  the adult world about us, and had determined to make it a success. He had by
  a kind of instinct, as it were, synthetically plagiarised every successful
  magazine and breathed into this dusty mixture the breath of life. He was
  elected at his own suggestion managing director, with the earnest support of
  Shoesmith and Naylor, and conducted the magazine so successfully and
  brilliantly that he even got a whole back page of advertisements from the big
  sports shop in Holborn, and made the printers pay at the same rate for a
  notice of certain books of their own which they said they had inserted by
  inadvertency to fill up space. The only literary contribution in the first
  number was a column by Topham in faultless stereotyped English in
  depreciation of some fancied evil called Utilitarian Studies and ending with
  that noble old quotation:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"To the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome."</p>

  <p>And Flack crowded us out of number two with a bright little paper on the
  "Humours of Cricket," and the Head himself was profusely thoughtful all over
  the editorial under the heading of "The School Chapel; and How it Seems to an
  Old Boy."</p>

  <p>Britten and I found it difficult to express to each other with any grace
  or precision what we felt about that magazine.</p>

     name="chap1_04"></a>IV. &mdash; ADOLESCENCE</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">I find it very difficult to trace how form was added to form
  and interpretation followed interpretation in my ever-spreading,
  ever-deepening, ever-multiplying and enriching vision of this world into
  which I had been born. Every day added its impressions, its hints, its subtle
  explications to the growing understanding. Day after day the living
  interlacing threads of a mind weave together. Every morning now for three
  weeks and more (for to-day is Thursday and I started on a Tuesday) I have
  been trying to convey some idea of the factors and early influences by which
  my particular scrap of subjective tapestry was shaped, to show the child
  playing on the nursery floor, the son perplexed by his mother, gazing aghast
  at his dead father, exploring interminable suburbs, touched by first
  intimations of the sexual mystery, coming in with a sort of confused avidity
  towards the centres of the life of London. It is only by such an effort to
  write it down that one realises how marvellously crowded, how marvellously
  analytical and synthetic those ears must be. One begins with the little child
  to whom the sky is a roof of blue, the world a screen of opaque and
  disconnected facts, the home a thing eternal, and "being good" just simple
  obedience to unquestioned authority; and one comes at last to the vast world
  of one's adult perception, pierced deep by flaring searchlights of partial
  understanding, here masked by mists, here refracted and distorted through
  half translucent veils, here showing broad prospects and limitless vistas and
  here impenetrably dark.</p>

  <p>I recall phases of deep speculation, doubts and even prayers by night, and
  strange occasions when by a sort of hypnotic contemplation of nothingness I
  sought to pierce the web of appearances about me. It is hard to measure these
  things in receding perspective, and now I cannot trace, so closely has mood
  succeeded and overlaid and obliterated mood, the phases by which an utter
  horror of death was replaced by the growing realisation of its necessity and
  dignity. Difficulty of the imagination with infinite space, infinite time,
  entangled my mind; and moral distress for the pain and suffering of bygone
  ages that made all thought of reformation in the future seem but the grimmest
  irony upon now irreparable wrongs. Many an intricate perplexity of these
  broadening years did not so much get settled as cease to matter. Life crowded
  me away from it.</p>

  <p>I have confessed myself a temerarious theologian, and in that passage from
  boyhood to manhood I ranged widely in my search for some permanently
  satisfying Truth. That, too, ceased after a time to be urgently interesting.
  I came at last into a phase that endures to this day, of absolute
  tranquillity, of absolute confidence in whatever that Incomprehensible
  Comprehensive which must needs be the substratum of all things, may be.
  Feeling OF IT, feeling BY IT, I cannot feel afraid of it. I think I had got
  quite clearly and finally to that adjustment long before my Cambridge days
  were done. I am sure that the evil in life is transitory and finite like an
  accident or distress in the nursery; that God is my Father and that I may
  trust Him, even though life hurts so that one must needs cry out at it, even
  though it shows no consequence but failure, no promise but pain...</p>

  <p>But while I was fearless of theology I must confess it was comparatively
  late before I faced and dared to probe the secrecies of sex. I was afraid of
  sex. I had an instinctive perception that it would be a large and difficult
  thing in my life, but my early training was all in the direction of regarding
  it as an irrelevant thing, as something disconnected from all the broad
  significances of life, as hostile and disgraceful in its quality. The world
  was never so emasculated in thought, I suppose, as it was in the Victorian
  time...</p>

  <p>I was afraid to think either of sex or (what I have always found
  inseparable from a kind of sexual emotion) beauty. Even as a boy I knew the
  thing as a haunting and alluring mystery that I tried to keep away from. Its
  dim presence obsessed me none the less for all the extravagant decency, the
  stimulating silences of my upbringing...</p>

  <p>The plaster Venuses and Apollos that used to adorn the vast aisle and huge
  grey terraces of the Crystal Palace were the first intimations of the beauty
  of the body that ever came into my life. As I write of it I feel again the
  shameful attraction of those gracious forms. I used to look at them not
  simply, but curiously and askance. Once at least in my later days at Penge, I
  spent a shilling in admission chiefly for the sake of them...</p>

  <p>The strangest thing of all my odd and solitary upbringing seems to me now
  that swathing up of all the splendours of the flesh, that strange combination
  of fanatical terrorism and shyness that fenced me about with prohibitions. It
  caused me to grow up, I will not say blankly ignorant, but with an ignorance
  blurred and dishonoured by shame, by enigmatical warnings, by cultivated
  aversions, an ignorance in which a fascinated curiosity and desire struggled
  like a thing in a net. I knew so little and I felt so much. There was indeed
  no Aphrodite at all in my youthful Pantheon, but instead there was a
  mysterious and minatory gap. I have told how at last a new Venus was born in
  my imagination out of gas lamps and the twilight, a Venus with a cockney
  accent and dark eyes shining out of the dusk, a Venus who was a warm,
  passion-stirring atmosphere rather than incarnate in a body. And I have told,
  too, how I bought a picture.</p>

  <p>All this was a thing apart from the rest of my life, a locked avoided
  chamber...</p>

  <p>It was not until my last year at Trinity that I really broke down the
  barriers of this unwholesome silence and brought my secret broodings to the
  light of day. Then a little set of us plunged suddenly into what we called at
  first sociological discussion. I can still recall even the physical feeling
  of those first tentative talks. I remember them mostly as occurring in the
  rooms of Ted Hatherleigh, who kept at the corner by the Trinity great gate,
  but we also used to talk a good deal at a man's in King's, a man named, if I
  remember rightly, Redmayne. The atmosphere of Hatherleigh's rooms was a haze
  of tobacco smoke against a background brown and deep. He professed himself a
  socialist with anarchistic leanings&mdash;he had suffered the martyrdom of
  ducking for it&mdash;and a huge French May-day poster displaying a splendid
  proletarian in red and black on a barricade against a flaring orange sky,
  dominated his decorations. Hatherleigh affected a fine untidiness, and all
  the place, even the floor, was littered with books, for the most part open
  and face downward; deeper darknesses were supplied by a discarded gown and
  our caps, all conscientiously battered, Hatherleigh's flopped like an
  elephant's ear and inserted quill pens supported the corners of mine; the
  highlights of the picture came chiefly as reflections from his chequered blue
  mugs full of audit ale. We sat on oak chairs, except the four or five who
  crowded on a capacious settle, we drank a lot of beer and were often fuddled,
  and occasionally quite drunk, and we all smoked reckless-looking
  pipes,&mdash;there was a transient fashion among us for corn cobs for which
  Mark Twain, I think, was responsible. Our little excesses with liquor were
  due far more to conscience than appetite, indicated chiefly a resolve to
  break away from restraints that we suspected were keeping us off the
  instructive knife-edges of life. Hatherleigh was a good Englishman of the
  premature type with a red face, a lot of hair, a deep voice and an explosive
  plunging manner, and it was he who said one evening&mdash;Heaven knows how we
  got to it&mdash;"Look here, you know, it's all Rot, this Shutting Up about
  Women. We <i>ought</i> to talk about them. What are we going to do about
  them? It's got to come. We're all festering inside about it. Let's out with
  it. There's too much Decency altogether about this Infernal University!"</p>

  <p>We rose to his challenge a little awkwardly and our first talk was clumsy,
  there were flushed faces and red ears, and I remember Hatherleigh broke out
  into a monologue on decency. "Modesty and Decency," said Hatherleigh, "are
  Oriental vices. The Jews brought them to Europe. They're Semitic, just like
  our monasticism here and the seclusion of women and mutilating the dead on a
  battlefield. And all that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>Hatherleigh's mind progressed by huge leaps, leaps that were usually
  wildly inaccurate, and for a time we engaged hotly upon the topic of those
  alleged mutilations and the Semitic responsibility for decency. Hatherleigh
  tried hard to saddle the Semitic race with the less elegant war customs of
  the Soudan and the northwest frontier of India, and quoted Doughty, at that
  time a little-known author, and Cunninghame Graham to show that the Arab was
  worse than a county-town spinster in his regard for respectability. But his
  case was too preposterous, and Esmeer, with his shrill penetrating voice and
  his way of pointing with all four long fingers flat together, carried the
  point against him. He quoted Cato and Roman law and the monasteries of
  Thibet.</p>

  <p>"Well, anyway," said Hatherleigh, escaping from our hands like an
  intellectual frog, "Semitic or not, I've got no use for decency."</p>

  <p>We argued points and Hatherleigh professed an unusually balanced and
  tolerating attitude. "I don't mind a certain refinement and dignity," he
  admitted generously. "What I object to is this spreading out of decency until
  it darkens the whole sky, until it makes a man's father afraid to speak of
  the most important things, until it makes a man afraid to look a frank book
  in the face or think&mdash;even think! until it leads to our coming
  to&mdash;to the business at last with nothing but a few prohibitions, a few
  hints, a lot of dirty jokes and, and "&mdash;he waved a hand and seemed to
  seek and catch his image in the air&mdash;"oh, a confounded buttered slide of
  sentiment, to guide us. I tell you I'm going to think about it and talk about
  it until I see a little more daylight than I do at present. I'm twenty-two.
  Things might happen to me anywhen. You men can go out into the world if you
  like, to sin like fools and marry like fools, not knowing what you are doing
  and ashamed to ask. You'll take the consequences, too, I expect, pretty
  meekly, sniggering a bit, sentimentalising a bit, like&mdash;like Cambridge
  humorists... I mean to know what I'm doing."</p>

  <p>He paused to drink, and I think I cut in with ideas of my own. But one is
  apt to forget one's own share in a talk, I find, more than one does the
  clear-cut objectivity of other people's, and I do not know how far I
  contributed to this discussion that followed. I am, however, pretty certain
  that it was then that ideal that we were pleased to call aristocracy and
  which soon became the common property of our set was developed. It was
  Esmeer, I know, who laid down and maintained the proposition that so far as
  minds went there were really only two sorts of man in the world, the
  aristocrat and the man who subdues his mind to other people's.</p>

  <p>"'I couldn't <i>think</i> of it, Sir,'" said Esmeer in his elucidatory
  tones; "that's what a servant says. His mind even is broken in to run between
  fences, and he admits it. <i>We've</i> got to be able to think of anything.
  And 'such things aren't for the Likes of Us!' That's another servant's
  saying. Well, everything IS for the Likes of Us. If we see fit, that is."</p>

  <p>A small fresh-coloured man in grey objected.</p>

  <p>"Well," exploded Hatherleigh, "if that isn't so what the deuce are we up
  here for? Instead of working in mines? If some things aren't to be thought
  about ever! We've got the privilege of all these extra years for getting
  things straight in our heads, and then we won't use 'em. Good God! what do
  you think a university's for?"...</p>

  <p>Esmeer's idea came with an effect of real emancipation to several of us.
  We were not going to be afraid of ideas any longer, we were going to throw
  down every barrier of prohibition and take them in and see what came of it.
  We became for a time even intemperately experimental, and one of us, at the
  bare suggestion of an eminent psychic investigator, took hashish and very
  nearly died of it within a fortnight of our great elucidation.</p>

  <p>The chief matter of our interchanges was of course the discussion of sex.
  Once the theme had been opened it became a sore place in our intercourse;
  none of us seemed able to keep away from it. Our imaginations got astir with
  it. We made up for lost time and went round it and through it and over it
  exhaustively. I recall prolonged discussion of polygamy on the way to
  Royston, muddy November tramps to Madingley, when amidst much profanity from
  Hatherleigh at the serious treatment of so obsolete a matter, we weighed the
  reasons, if any, for the institution of marriage. The fine dim night-time
  spaces of the Great Court are bound up with the inconclusive finales of
  mighty hot-eared wrangles; the narrows of Trinity Street and Petty Cury and
  Market Hill have their particular associations for me with that spate of
  confession and free speech, that almost painful goal delivery of long pent
  and crappled and sometimes crippled ideas.</p>

  <p>And we went on a reading party that Easter to a place called Pulborough in
  Sussex, where there is a fishing inn and a river that goes under a bridge. It
  was a late Easter and a blazing one, and we boated and bathed and talked of
  being Hellenic and the beauty of the body until at moments it seemed to us
  that we were destined to restore the Golden Age, by the simple abolition of
  tailors and outfitters.</p>

  <p>Those undergraduate talks! how rich and glorious they seemed, how
  splendidly new the ideas that grew and multiplied in our seething minds! We
  made long afternoon and evening raids over the Downs towards Arundel, and
  would come tramping back through the still keen moonlight singing and
  shouting. We formed romantic friendships with one another, and grieved more
  or less convincingly that there were no splendid women fit to be our
  companions in the world. But Hatherleigh, it seemed, had once known a girl
  whose hair was gloriously red. "My God!" said Hatherleigh to convey the
  quality of her; just simply and with projectile violence: "My God!"</p>

  <p>Benton had heard of a woman who lived with a man refusing to be married to
  him&mdash;we thought that splendid beyond measure,&mdash;I cannot now imagine
  why. She was "like a tender goddess," Benton said. A sort of shame came upon
  us in the dark in spite of our liberal intentions when Benton committed
  himself to that. And after such talk we would fall upon great pauses of
  emotional dreaming, and if by chance we passed a girl in a governess cart, or
  some farmer's daughter walking to the station, we became alertly silent or
  obstreperously indifferent to her. For might she not be just that one
  exception to the banal decency, the sickly pointless conventionality, the
  sham modesty of the times in which we lived?</p>

  <p>We felt we stood for a new movement, not realising how perennially this
  same emancipation returns to those ancient courts beside the Cam. We were the
  anti-decency party, we discovered a catch phrase that we flourished about in
  the Union and made our watchword, namely, "stark fact." We hung nude pictures
  in our rooms much as if they had been flags, to the earnest concern of our
  bedders, and I disinterred my long-kept engraving and had it framed in fumed
  oak, and found for it a completer and less restrained companion, a companion
  I never cared for in the slightest degree...</p>

  <p>This efflorescence did not prevent, I think indeed it rather helped, our
  more formal university work, for most of us took firsts, and three of us got
  Fellowships in one year or another. There was Benton who had a Research
  Fellowship and went to Tubingen, there was Esmeer and myself who both became
  Residential Fellows. I had taken the Mental and Moral Science Tripos (as it
  was then), and three years later I got a lectureship in political science. In
  those days it was disguised in the cloak of Political Economy.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">It was our affectation to be a little detached from the main
  stream of undergraduate life. We worked pretty hard, but by virtue of our
  beer, our socialism and suchlike heterodoxy, held ourselves to be
  differentiated from the swatting reading man. None of us, except Baxter, who
  was a rowing blue, a rather abnormal blue with an appetite for ideas, took
  games seriously enough to train, and on the other hand we intimated contempt
  for the rather mediocre, deliberately humorous, consciously gentlemanly and
  consciously wild undergraduate men who made up the mass of Cambridge life.
  After the manner of youth we were altogether too hard on our contemporaries.
  We battered our caps and tore our gowns lest they should seem new, and we
  despised these others extremely for doing exactly the same things; we had an
  idea of ourselves and resented beyond measure a similar weakness in these our
  brothers.</p>

  <p>There was a type, or at least there seemed to us to be a type&mdash;I'm a
  little doubtful at times now whether after all we didn't create it&mdash;for
  which Hatherleigh invented the nickname the "Pinky Dinkys," intending thereby
  both contempt and abhorrence in almost equal measure. The Pinky Dinky
  summarised all that we particularly did not want to be, and also, I now
  perceive, much of what we were and all that we secretly dreaded becoming.</p>

  <p>But it is hard to convey the Pinky Dinky idea, for all that it meant so
  much to us. We spent one evening at least during that reading party upon the
  Pinky Dinky; we sat about our one fire after a walk in the rain&mdash;it was
  our only wet day&mdash;smoked our excessively virile pipes, and elaborated
  the natural history of the Pinky Dinky. We improvised a sort of Pinky Dinky
  litany, and Hatherleigh supplied deep notes for the responses.</p>

  <p>"The Pinky Dinky extracts a good deal of amusement from life," said some
  one.</p>

  <p>"Damned prig!" said Hatherleigh.</p>

  <p>"The Pinky Dinky arises in the Union and treats the question with a light
  gay touch. He makes the weird ones mad. But sometimes he cannot go on because
  of the amusement he extracts."</p>

  <p>"I want to shy books at the giggling swine," said Hatherleigh.</p>

  <p>"The Pinky Dinky says suddenly while he is making the tea, 'We're all
  being frightfully funny. It's time for you to say something now.'"</p>

  <p>"The Pinky Dinky shakes his head and says: 'I'm afraid I shall never be a
  responsible being.' And he really IS frivolous."</p>

  <p>"Frivolous but not vulgar," said Esmeer.</p>

  <p>"Pinky Dinkys are chaps who've had their buds nipped," said Hatherleigh.
  "They're Plebs and they know it. They haven't the Guts to get hold of things.
  And so they worry up all those silly little jokes of theirs to carry it
  off."...</p>

  <p>We tried bad ones for a time, viciously flavoured.</p>

  <p>Pinky Dinkys are due to over-production of the type that ought to keep
  outfitters' shops. Pinky Dinkys would like to keep outfitters' shops with
  whimsy 'scriptions on the boxes and make your bill out funny, and not be
  snobs to customers, no!&mdash;not even if they had titles."</p>

  <p>"Every Pinky Dinky's people are rather good people, and better than most
  Pinky Dinky's people. But he does not put on side."</p>

  <p>"Pinky Dinkys become playful at the sight of women."</p>

  <p>"'Croquet's my game,' said the Pinky Dinky, and felt a man
  condescended."</p>

  <p>"But what the devil do they think they're up to, anyhow?" roared old
  Hatherleigh suddenly, dropping plump into bottomless despair.</p>

  <p>We felt we had still failed to get at the core of the mystery of the Pinky
  Dinky.</p>

  <p>We tried over things about his religion. "The Pinky Dinky goes to King's
  Chapel, and sits and feels in the dusk. Solemn things! Oh <i>hush</i>! He
  wouldn't tell you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He <i>couldn't</i> tell you."</p>

  <p>"Religion is so sacred to him he never talks about it, never reads about
  it, never thinks about it. Just feels!"</p>

  <p>"But in his heart of hearts, oh! ever so deep, the Pinky Dinky has a
  doubt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Some one protested.</p>

  <p>"Not a vulgar doubt," Esmeer went on, "but a kind of hesitation whether
  the Ancient of Days is really exactly what one would call good form...
  There's a lot of horrid coarseness got into the world somehow.
  <i>Somebody</i> put it there... And anyhow there's no particular reason why a
  man should be seen about with Him. He's jolly Awful of course and all
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The Pinky Dinky for all his fun and levity has a clean mind."</p>

  <p>"A thoroughly clean mind. Not like Esmeer's&mdash;the Pig!"</p>

  <p>"If once he began to think about sex, how could he be comfortable at
  croquet?"</p>

  <p>"It's their Damned Modesty," said Hatherleigh suddenly, "that's what's the
  matter with the Pinky Dinky. It's Mental Cowardice dressed up as a virtue and
  taking the poor dears in. Cambridge is soaked with it; it's some confounded
  local bacillus. Like the thing that gives a flavour to Havana cigars. He
  comes up here to be made into a man and a ruler of the people, and he thinks
  it shows a nice disposition not to take on the job! How the Devil is a great
  Empire to be run with men like him?"</p>

  <p>"All his little jokes and things," said Esmeer regarding his feet on the
  fender, "it's just a nervous sniggering&mdash;because he's afraid... Oxford's
  no better."</p>

  <p>"What's he afraid of?" said I.</p>

  <p>"God knows!" exploded Hatherleigh and stared at the fire.</p>

  <p>"LIFE!" said Esmeer. "And so in a way are we," he added, and made a
  thoughtful silence for a time.</p>

  <p>"I say," began Carter, who was doing the Natural Science Tripos, "what is
  the adult form of the Pinky Dinky?"</p>

  <p>But there we were checked by our ignorance of the world.</p>

  <p>"What is the adult form of any of us?" asked Benton, voicing the thought
  that had arrested our flow.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">I do not remember that we ever lifted our criticism to the
  dons and the organisation of the University. I think we took them for
  granted. When I look back at my youth I am always astonished by the multitude
  of things that we took for granted. It seemed to us that Cambridge was in the
  order of things, for all the world like having eyebrows or a vermiform
  appendix. Now with the larger scepticism of middle age I can entertain very
  fundamental doubts about these old universities. Indeed I had a
  scheme&mdash;</p>

  <p>I do not see what harm I can do now by laying bare the purpose of the
  political combinations I was trying to effect.</p>

  <p>My educational scheme was indeed the starting-point of all the big project
  of conscious public reconstruction at which I aimed. I wanted to build up a
  new educational machine altogether for the governing class out of a
  consolidated system of special public service schools. I meant to get to work
  upon this whatever office I was given in the new government. I could have
  begun my plan from the Admiralty or the War Office quite as easily as from
  the Education Office. I am firmly convinced it is hopeless to think of
  reforming the old public schools and universities to meet the needs of a
  modern state, they send their roots too deep and far, the cost would exceed
  any good that could possibly be effected, and so I have sought a way round
  this invincible obstacle. I do think it would be quite practicable to
  side-track, as the Americans say, the whole system by creating hardworking,
  hard-living, modern and scientific boys' schools, first for the Royal Navy
  and then for the public service generally, and as they grew, opening them to
  the public without any absolute obligation to subsequent service.
  Simultaneously with this it would not be impossible to develop a new college
  system with strong faculties in modern philosophy, modern history, European
  literature and criticism, physical and biological science, education and
  sociology.</p>

  <p>We could in fact create a new liberal education in this way, and cut the
  umbilicus of the classical languages for good and all. I should have set this
  going, and trusted it to correct or kill the old public schools and the
  Oxford and Cambridge tradition altogether. I had men in my mind to begin the
  work, and I should have found others. I should have aimed at making a
  hard-trained, capable, intellectually active, proud type of man. Everything
  else would have been made subservient to that. I should have kept my grip on
  the men through their vacation, and somehow or other I would have contrived a
  young woman to match them. I think I could have seen to it effectually enough
  that they didn't get at croquet and tennis with the vicarage daughters and
  discover sex in the Peeping Tom fashion I did, and that they realised quite
  early in life that it isn't really virile to reek of tobacco. I should have
  had military manoeuvres, training ships, aeroplane work, mountaineering and
  so forth, in the place of the solemn trivialities of games, and I should have
  fed and housed my men clean and very hard&mdash;where there wasn't any audit
  ale, no credit tradesmen, and plenty of high pressure douches...</p>

  <p>I have revisited Cambridge and Oxford time after time since I came down,
  and so far as the Empire goes, I want to get clear of those two places...</p>

  <p>Always I renew my old feelings, a physical oppression, a sense of lowness
  and dampness almost exactly like the feeling of an underground room where
  paper moulders and leaves the wall, a feeling of ineradicable contagion in
  the Gothic buildings, in the narrow ditch-like rivers, in those roads and
  roads of stuffy little villas. Those little villas have destroyed all the
  good of the old monastic system and none of its evil...</p>

  <p>Some of the most charming people in the world live in them, but their
  collective effect is below the quality of any individual among them.
  Cambridge is a world of subdued tones, of excessively subtle humours, of prim
  conduct and free thinking; it fears the Parent, but it has no fear of God; it
  offers amidst surroundings that vary between disguises and antiquarian charm
  the inflammation of literature's purple draught; one hears there a peculiar
  thin scandal like no other scandal in the world&mdash;a covetous
  scandal&mdash;so that I am always reminded of Ibsen in Cambridge. In
  Cambridge and the plays of Ibsen alone does it seem appropriate for the
  heroine before the great crisis of life to "enter, take off her overshoes,
  and put her wet umbrella upon the writing desk."...</p>

  <p>We have to make a new Academic mind for modern needs, and the last thing
  to make it out of, I am convinced, is the old Academic mind. One might as
  soon try to fake the old VICTORY at Portsmouth into a line of battleship
  again. Besides which the old Academic mind, like those old bathless, damp
  Gothic colleges, is much too delightful in its peculiar and distinctive way
  to damage by futile patching.</p>

  <p>My heart warms to a sense of affectionate absurdity as I recall dear old
  Codger, surely the most "unleaderly" of men. No more than from the old
  Schoolmen, his kindred, could one get from him a School for Princes. Yet
  apart from his teaching he was as curious and adorable as a good Netsuke.
  Until quite recently he was a power in Cambridge, he could make and bar and
  destroy, and in a way he has become the quintessence of Cambridge in my
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>I see him on his way to the morning's lecture, with his plump childish
  face, his round innocent eyes, his absurdly non-prehensile fat hand carrying
  his cap, his grey trousers braced up much too high, his feet a trifle
  inturned, and going across the great court with a queer tripping pace that
  seemed cultivated even to my naive undergraduate eye. Or I see him lecturing.
  He lectured walking up and down between the desks, talking in a fluting rapid
  voice, and with the utmost lucidity. If he could not walk up and down he
  could not lecture. His mind and voice had precisely the fluid quality of some
  clear subtle liquid; one felt it could flow round anything and overcome
  nothing. And its nimble eddies were wonderful! Or again I recall him drinking
  port with little muscular movements in his neck and cheek and chin and his
  brows knit&mdash;very judicial, very concentrated, preparing to say the apt
  just thing; it was the last thing he would have told a lie about.</p>

  <p>When I think of Codger I am reminded of an inscription I saw on some
  occasion in Regent's Park above two eyes scarcely more limpidly innocent than
  his&mdash;"Born in the Menagerie." Never once since Codger began to display
  the early promise of scholarship at the age of eight or more, had he been
  outside the bars. His utmost travel had been to lecture here and lecture
  there. His student phase had culminated in papers of quite exceptional
  brilliance, and he had gone on to lecture with a cheerful combination of wit
  and mannerism that had made him a success from the beginning. He has lectured
  ever since. He lectures still. Year by year he has become plumper, more
  rubicund and more and more of an item for the intelligent visitor to see.
  Even in my time he was pointed out to people as part of our innumerable
  enrichments, and obviously he knew it. He has become now almost the leading
  Character in a little donnish world of much too intensely appreciated
  Characters.</p>

  <p>He boasted he took no exercise, and also of his knowledge of port wine. Of
  other wines he confessed quite frankly he had no "special knowledge." Beyond
  these things he had little pride except that he claimed to have read every
  novel by a woman writer that had ever entered the Union Library. This,
  however, he held to be remarkable rather than ennobling, and such boasts as
  he made of it were tinged with playfulness. Certainly he had a scholar's
  knowledge of the works of Miss Marie Corelli, Miss Braddon, Miss Elizabeth
  Glyn and Madame Sarah Grand that would have astonished and flattered those
  ladies enormously, and he loved nothing so much in his hours of relaxation as
  to propound and answer difficult questions upon their books. Tusher of King's
  was his ineffectual rival in this field, their bouts were memorable and
  rarely other than glorious for Codger; but then Tusher spread himself too
  much, he also undertook to rehearse whole pages out of Bradshaw, and tell you
  with all the changes how to get from any station to any station in Great
  Britain by the nearest and cheapest routes...</p>

  <p>Codger lodged with a little deaf innocent old lady, Mrs. Araminta Mergle,
  who was understood to be herself a very redoubtable Character in the
  Gyp-Bedder class; about her he related quietly absurd anecdotes. He displayed
  a marvellous invention in ascribing to her plausible expressions of opinion
  entirely identical in import with those of the Oxford and Harvard
  Pragmatists, against whom he waged a fierce obscure war...</p>

  <p>It was Codger's function to teach me philosophy, philosophy! the intimate
  wisdom of things. He dealt in a variety of Hegelian stuff like nothing else
  in the world, but marvellously consistent with itself. It was a wonderful web
  he spun out of that queer big active childish brain that had never lusted nor
  hated nor grieved nor feared nor passionately loved,&mdash;a web of
  iridescent threads. He had luminous final theories about Love and Death and
  Immortality, odd matters they seemed for him to think about! and all his
  woven thoughts lay across my perception of the realities of things, as flimsy
  and irrelevant and clever and beautiful, oh!&mdash;as a dew-wet spider's web
  slung in the morning sunshine across the black mouth of a gun...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">All through those years of development I perceive now there
  must have been growing in me, slowly, irregularly, assimilating to itself all
  the phrases and forms of patriotism, diverting my religious impulses,
  utilising my esthetic tendencies, my dominating idea, the statesman's idea,
  that idea of social service which is the protagonist of my story, that real
  though complex passion for Making, making widely and greatly, cities,
  national order, civilisation, whose interplay with all those other factors in
  life I have set out to present. It was growing in me&mdash;as one's bones
  grow, no man intending it.</p>

  <p>I have tried to show how, quite early in my life, the fact of
  disorderliness, the conception of social life as being a multitudinous
  confusion out of hand, came to me. One always of course simplifies these
  things in the telling, but I do not think I ever saw the world at large in
  any other terms. I never at any stage entertained the idea which sustained my
  mother, and which sustains so many people in the world,&mdash;the idea that
  the universe, whatever superficial discords it may present, is as a matter of
  fact "all right," is being steered to definite ends by a serene and
  unquestionable God. My mother thought that Order prevailed, and that disorder
  was just incidental and foredoomed rebellion; I feel and have always felt
  that order rebels against and struggles against disorder, that order has an
  up-hill job, in gardens, experiments, suburbs, everything alike; from the
  very beginnings of my experience I discovered hostility to order, a constant
  escaping from control.</p>

  <p>The current of living and contemporary ideas in which my mind was
  presently swimming made all in the same direction; in place of my mother's
  attentive, meticulous but occasionally extremely irascible Providence, the
  talk was all of the Struggle for Existence and the survival not of the
  Best&mdash;that was nonsense, but of the fittest to survive.</p>

  <p>The attempts to rehabilitate Faith in the form of the Individualist's
  <i>laissez faire</i> never won upon me. I disliked Herbert Spencer all my
  life until I read his autobiography, and then I laughed a little and loved
  him. I remember as early as the City Merchants' days how Britten and I
  scoffed at that pompous question-begging word "Evolution," having, so to
  speak, found it out. Evolution, some illuminating talker had remarked at the
  Britten lunch table, had led not only to man, but to the liver-fluke and
  skunk, obviously it might lead anywhere; order came into things only through
  the struggling mind of man. That lit things wonderfully for us. When I went
  up to Cambridge I was perfectly clear that life was a various and splendid
  disorder of forces that the spirit of man sets itself to tame. I have never
  since fallen away from that persuasion.</p>

  <p>I do not think I was exceptionally precocious in reaching these
  conclusions and a sort of religious finality for myself by eighteen or
  nineteen. I know men and women vary very much in these matters, just as
  children do in learning to talk. Some will chatter at eighteen months and
  some will hardly speak until three, and the thing has very little to do with
  their subsequent mental quality. So it is with young people; some will begin
  their religious, their social, their sexual interests at fourteen, some not
  until far on in the twenties. Britten and I belonged to one of the precocious
  types, and Cossington very probably to another. It wasn't that there was
  anything priggish about any of us; we should have been prigs to have
  concealed our spontaneous interests and ape the theoretical boy.</p>

  <p>The world of man centred for my imagination in London, it still centres
  there; the real and present world, that is to say, as distinguished from the
  wonder-lands of atomic and microscopic science and the stars and future time.
  I had travelled scarcely at all, I had never crossed the Channel, but I had
  read copiously and I had formed a very good working idea of this round globe
  with its mountains and wildernesses and forests and all the sorts and
  conditions of human life that were scattered over its surface. It was all
  alive, I felt, and changing every day; how it was changing, and the changes
  men might bring about, fascinated my mind beyond measure.</p>

  <p>I used to find a charm in old maps that showed The World as Known to the
  Ancients, and I wish I could now without any suspicion of self-deception
  write down compactly the world as it was known to me at nineteen. So far as
  extension went it was, I fancy, very like the world I know now at forty-two;
  I had practically all the mountains and seas, boundaries and races, products
  and possibilities that I have now. But its intension was very different. All
  the interval has been increasing and deepening my social knowledge, replacing
  crude and second-hand impressions by felt and realised distinctions.</p>

  <p>In 1895&mdash;that was my last year with Britten, for I went up to
  Cambridge in September&mdash;my vision of the world had much the same
  relation to the vision I have to-day that an ill-drawn daub of a mask has to
  the direct vision of a human face. Britten and I looked at our world and saw
  &mdash;what did we see? Forms and colours side by side that we had no
  suspicion were interdependent. We had no conception of the roots of things
  nor of the reaction of things. It did not seem to us, for example, that
  business had anything to do with government, or that money and means affected
  the heroic issues of war. There were no wagons in our war game, and where
  there were guns, there it was assumed the ammunition was gathered together.
  Finance again was a sealed book to us; we did not so much connect it with the
  broad aspects of human affairs as regard it as a sort of intrusive nuisance
  to be earnestly ignored by all right-minded men. We had no conception of the
  quality of politics, nor how "interests" came into such affairs; we believed
  men were swayed by purely intellectual convictions and were either right or
  wrong, honest or dishonest (in which case they deserved to be shot), good or
  bad. We knew nothing of mental inertia, and could imagine the opinion of a
  whole nation changed by one lucid and convincing exposition. We were capable
  of the most incongruous transfers from the scroll of history to our own
  times, we could suppose Brixton ravaged and Hampstead burnt in civil wars for
  the succession to the throne, or Cheapside a lane of death and the front of
  the Mansion House set about with guillotines in the course of an accurately
  transposed French Revolution. We rebuilt London by Act of Parliament, and
  once in a mood of hygienic enterprise we transferred its population <i>en
  masse</i> to the North Downs by an order of the Local Government Board. We
  thought nothing of throwing religious organisations out of employment or
  superseding all the newspapers by freely distributed bulletins. We could
  contemplate the possibility of laws abolishing whole classes; we were equal
  to such a dream as the peaceful and orderly proclamation of Communism from
  the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral, after the passing of a simply worded
  bill,&mdash;a close and not unnaturally an exciting division carrying the
  third reading. I remember quite distinctly evolving that vision. We were then
  fully fifteen and we were perfectly serious about it. We were not fools; it
  was simply that as yet we had gathered no experience at all of the limits and
  powers of legislation and conscious collective intention...</p>

  <p>I think this statement does my boyhood justice, and yet I have my doubts.
  It is so hard now to say what one understood and what one did not understand.
  It isn't only that every day changed one's general outlook, but also that a
  boy fluctuates between phases of quite adult understanding and phases of
  tawdrily magnificent puerility. Sometimes I myself was in those tumbrils that
  went along Cheapside to the Mansion House, a Sydney Cartonesque figure, a
  white defeated Mirabean; sometimes it was I who sat judging and condemning
  and ruling (sleeping in my clothes and feeding very simply) the soul and
  autocrat of the Provisional Government, which occupied, of all inconvenient
  places! the General Post Office at St. Martin's-le-Grand!...</p>

  <p>I cannot trace the development of my ideas at Cambridge, but I believe the
  mere physical fact of going two hours' journey away from London gave that
  place for the first time an effect of unity in my imagination. I got outside
  London. It became tangible instead of being a frame almost as universal as
  sea and sky.</p>

  <p>At Cambridge my ideas ceased to live in a duologue; in exchange for
  Britten, with whom, however, I corresponded lengthily, stylishly and self-
  consciously for some years, I had now a set of congenial friends. I got talk
  with some of the younger dons, I learnt to speak in the Union, and in my
  little set we were all pretty busily sharpening each other's wits and
  correcting each other's interpretations. Cambridge made politics personal and
  actual. At City Merchants' we had had no sense of effective contact; we
  boasted, it is true, an under secretary and a colonial governor among our old
  boys, but they were never real to us; such distinguished sons as returned to
  visit the old school were allusive and pleasant in the best Pinky Dinky
  style, and pretended to be in earnest about nothing but our football and
  cricket, to mourn the abolition of "water," and find a shuddering personal
  interest in the ancient swishing block. At Cambridge I felt for the first
  time that I touched the thing that was going on. Real living statesmen came
  down to debate in the Union, the older dons had been their college intimates,
  their sons and nephews expounded them to us and made them real to us. They
  invited us to entertain ideas; I found myself for the first time in my life
  expected to read and think and discuss, my secret vice had become a
  virtue.</p>

  <p>That combination-room world is at last larger and more populous and
  various than the world of schoolmasters. The Shoesmiths and Naylors who had
  been the aristocracy of City Merchants' fell into their place in my mind;
  they became an undistinguished mass on the more athletic side of Pinky
  Dinkyism, and their hostility to ideas and to the expression of ideas ceased
  to limit and trouble me. The brighter men of each generation stay up; these
  others go down to propagate their tradition, as the fathers of families, as
  mediocre professional men, as assistant masters in schools. Cambridge which
  perfects them is by the nature of things least oppressed by
  them,&mdash;except when it comes to a vote in Convocation.</p>

  <p>We were still in those days under the shadow of the great Victorians. I
  never saw Gladstone (as I never set eyes on the old Queen), but he had
  resigned office only a year before I went up to Trinity, and the Combination
  Rooms were full of personal gossip about him and Disraeli and the other big
  figures of the gladiatorial stage of Parlimentary history, talk that leaked
  copiously into such sets as mine. The ceiling of our guest chamber at Trinity
  was glorious with the arms of Sir William Harcourt, whose Death Duties had
  seemed at first like a socialist dawn. Mr. Evesham we asked to come to the
  Union every year, Masters, Chamberlain and the old Duke of Devonshire; they
  did not come indeed, but their polite refusals brought us all, as it were,
  within personal touch of them. One heard of cabinet councils and meetings at
  country houses. Some of us, pursuing such interests, went so far as to read
  political memoirs and the novels of Disraeli and Mrs. Humphry Ward. From
  gossip, example and the illustrated newspapers one learnt something of the
  way in which parties were split, coalitions formed, how permanent officials
  worked and controlled their ministers, how measures were brought forward and
  projects modified.</p>

  <p>And while I was getting the great leading figures on the political stage,
  who had been presented to me in my schooldays not so much as men as the
  pantomimic monsters of political caricature, while I was getting them reduced
  in my imagination to the stature of humanity, and their motives to the
  quality of impulses like my own, I was also acquiring in my Tripos work a
  constantly developing and enriching conception of the world of men as a
  complex of economic, intellectual and moral processes...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Socialism is an intellectual Proteus, but to the men of my
  generation it came as the revolt of the workers. Rodbertus we never heard of
  and the Fabian Society we did not understand; Marx and Morris, the Chicago
  Anarchists, JUSTICE and Social Democratic Federation (as it was then)
  presented socialism to our minds. Hatherleigh was the leading exponent of the
  new doctrines in Trinity, and the figure upon his wall of a huge-muscled,
  black-haired toiler swaggering sledgehammer in hand across a revolutionary
  barricade, seemed the quintessence of what he had to expound. Landlord and
  capitalist had robbed and enslaved the workers, and were driving them quite
  automatically to inevitable insurrection. They would arise and the capitalist
  system would flee and vanish like the mists before the morning, like the dews
  before the sunrise, giving place in the most simple and obvious manner to an
  era of Right and Justice and Virtue and Well Being, and in short a Perfectly
  Splendid Time.</p>

  <p>I had already discussed this sort of socialism under the guidance of
  Britten, before I went up to Cambridge. It was all mixed up with ideas about
  freedom and natural virtue and a great scorn for kings, titles, wealth and
  officials, and it was symbolised by the red ties we wore. Our simple verdict
  on existing arrangements was that they were "all wrong." The rich were
  robbers and knew it, kings and princes were usurpers and knew it, religious
  teachers were impostors in league with power, the economic system was an
  elaborate plot on the part of the few to expropriate the many. We went about
  feeling scornful of all the current forms of life, forms that esteemed
  themselves solid, that were, we knew, no more than shapes painted on a
  curtain that was presently to be torn aside...</p>

  <p>It was Hatherleigh's poster and his capacity for overstating things, I
  think, that first qualified my simple revolutionary enthusiasm. Perhaps also
  I had met with Fabian publications, but if I did I forget the circumstances.
  And no doubt my innate constructiveness with its practical corollary of an
  analytical treatment of the material supplied, was bound to push me on beyond
  this melodramatic interpretation of human affairs.</p>

  <p>I compared that Working Man of the poster with any sort of working man I
  knew. I perceived that the latter was not going to change, and indeed could
  not under any stimulus whatever be expected to change, into the former. It
  crept into my mind as slowly and surely as the dawn creeps into a room that
  the former was not, as I had at first rather glibly assumed, an "ideal," but
  a complete misrepresentation of the quality and possibilities of things.</p>

  <p>I do not know now whether it was during my school-days or at Cambridge
  that I first began not merely to see the world as a great contrast of rich
  and poor, but to feel the massive effect of that multitudinous majority of
  people who toil continually, who are for ever anxious about ways and means,
  who are restricted, ill clothed, ill fed and ill housed, who have limited
  outlooks and continually suffer misadventures, hardships and distresses
  through the want of money. My lot had fallen upon the fringe of the
  possessing minority; if I did not know the want of necessities I knew
  shabbiness, and the world that let me go on to a university education
  intimated very plainly that there was not a thing beyond the primary needs
  that my stimulated imagination might demand that it would not be an effort
  for me to secure. A certain aggressive radicalism against the ruling and
  propertied classes followed almost naturally from my circumstances. It did
  not at first connect itself at all with the perception of a planless disorder
  in human affairs that had been forced upon me by the atmosphere of my
  upbringing, nor did it link me in sympathy with any of the profounder
  realities of poverty. It was a personal independent thing. The dingier people
  one saw in the back streets and lower quarters of Bromstead and Penge, the
  drift of dirty children, ragged old women, street loafers, grimy workers that
  made the social background of London, the stories one heard of privation and
  sweating, only joined up very slowly with the general propositions I was
  making about life. We could become splendidly eloquent about the social
  revolution and the triumph of the Proletariat after the Class war, and it was
  only by a sort of inspiration that it came to me that my bedder, a garrulous
  old thing with a dusty black bonnet over one eye and an ostentatiously clean
  apron outside the dark mysteries that clothed her, or the cheeky little
  ruffians who yelled papers about the streets, were really material to such
  questions.</p>

  <p>Directly any of us young socialists of Trinity found ourselves in
  immediate contact with servants or cadgers or gyps or bedders or plumbers or
  navvies or cabmen or railway porters we became unconsciously and unthinkingly
  aristocrats. Our voices altered, our gestures altered. We behaved just as all
  the other men, rich or poor, swatters or sportsmen or Pinky Dinkys, behaved,
  and exactly as we were expected to behave. On the whole it is a population of
  poor quality round about Cambridge, rather stunted and spiritless and very
  difficult to idealise. That theoretical Working Man of ours!&mdash;if we felt
  the clash at all we explained it, I suppose, by assuming that he came from
  another part of the country; Esmeer, I remember, who lived somewhere in the
  Fens, was very eloquent about the Cornish fishermen, and Hatherleigh, who was
  a Hampshire man, assured us we ought to know the Scottish miner. My private
  fancy was for the Lancashire operative because of his co-operative societies,
  and because what Lancashire thinks to-day England thinks to-morrow... And
  also I had never been in Lancashire.</p>

  <p>By little increments of realisation it was that the profounder verities of
  the problem of socialism came to me. It helped me very much that I had to go
  down to the Potteries several times to discuss my future with my uncle and
  guardian; I walked about and saw Bursley Wakes and much of the human aspects
  of organised industrialism at close quarters for the first time. The picture
  of a splendid Working Man cheated out of his innate glorious possibilities,
  and presently to arise and dash this scoundrelly and scandalous system of
  private ownership to fragments, began to give place to a limitless spectacle
  of inefficiency, to a conception of millions of people not organised as they
  should be, not educated as they should be, not simply prevented from but
  incapable of nearly every sort of beauty, mostly kindly and well meaning,
  mostly incompetent, mostly obstinate, and easily humbugged and easily
  diverted. Even the tragic and inspiring idea of Marx, that the poor were
  nearing a limit of painful experience, and awakening to a sense of
  intolerable wrongs, began to develop into the more appalling conception that
  the poor were simply in a witless uncomfortable inconclusive
  way&mdash;"muddling along"; that they wanted nothing very definitely nor very
  urgently, that mean fears enslaved them and mean satisfactions decoyed them,
  that they took the very gift of life itself with a spiritless lassitude,
  hoarding it, being rather anxious not to lose it than to use it in any way
  whatever.</p>

  <p>The complete development of that realisation was the work of many years. I
  had only the first intimations at Cambridge. But I did have intimations. Most
  acutely do I remember the doubts that followed the visit of Chris Robinson.
  Chris Robinson was heralded by such heroic anticipations, and he was so
  entirely what we had not anticipated.</p>

  <p>Hatherleigh got him to come, arranged a sort of meeting for him at
  Redmayne's rooms in King's, and was very proud and proprietorial. It failed
  to stir Cambridge at all profoundly. Beyond a futile attempt to screw up
  Hatherleigh made by some inexpert duffers who used nails instead of screws
  and gimlets, there was no attempt to rag. Next day Chris Robinson went and
  spoke at Bennett Hall in Newnham College, and left Cambridge in the evening
  amidst the cheers of twenty men or so. Socialism was at such a low ebb
  politically in those days that it didn't even rouse men to opposition.</p>

  <p>And there sat Chris under that flamboyant and heroic Worker of the poster,
  a little wrinkled grey-bearded apologetic man in ready-made clothes, with
  watchful innocent brown eyes and a persistent and invincible air of being out
  of his element. He sat with his stout boots tucked up under his chair, and
  clung to a teacup and saucer and looked away from us into the fire, and we
  all sat about on tables and chair-arms and windowsills and boxes and anywhere
  except upon chairs after the manner of young men. The only other chair whose
  seat was occupied was the one containing his knitted woollen comforter and
  his picturesque old beach-photographer's hat. We were all shy and didn't know
  how to take hold of him now we had got him, and, which was disconcertingly
  unanticipated, he was manifestly having the same difficulty with us. We had
  expected to be gripped.</p>

  <p>"I'll not be knowing what to say to these Chaps," he repeated with a
  north-country quality in his speech.</p>

  <p>We made reassuring noises.</p>

  <p>The Ambassador of the Workers stirred his tea earnestly through an
  uncomfortable pause.</p>

  <p>"I'd best tell 'em something of how things are in Lancashire, what with
  the new machines and all that," he speculated at last with red reflections in
  his thoughtful eyes.</p>

  <p>We had an inexcusable dread that perhaps he would make a mess of the
  meeting.</p>

  <p>But when he was no longer in the unaccustomed meshes of refined
  conversation, but speaking with an audience before him, he became a different
  man. He declared he would explain to us just exactly what socialism was, and
  went on at once to an impassioned contrast of social conditions. "You young
  men," he said "come from homes of luxury; every need you feel is
  supplied&mdash;"</p>

  <p>We sat and stood and sprawled about him, occupying every inch of
  Redmayne's floor space except the hearthrug-platform, and we listened to him
  and thought him over. He was the voice of wrongs that made us indignant and
  eager. We forgot for a time that he had been shy and seemed not a little
  incompetent, his provincial accent became a beauty of his earnest speech, we
  were carried away by his indignations. We looked with shining eyes at one
  another and at the various dons who had dropped in and were striving to
  maintain a front of judicious severity. We felt more and more that social
  injustice must cease, and cease forthwith. We felt we could not sleep upon
  it. At the end we clapped and murmured our applause and wanted badly to
  cheer.</p>

  <p>Then like a lancet stuck into a bladder came the heckling. Denson, that
  indolent, liberal-minded sceptic, did most of the questioning. He lay
  contorted in a chair, with his ugly head very low, his legs crossed and his
  left boot very high, and he pointed his remarks with a long thin hand and
  occasionally adjusted the unstable glasses that hid his watery eyes. "I don't
  want to carp," he began. "The present system, I admit, stands condemned.
  Every present system always HAS stood condemned in the minds of intelligent
  men. But where it seems to me you get thin, is just where everybody has been
  thin, and that's when you come to the remedy."</p>

  <p>"Socialism," said Chris Robinson, as if it answered everything, and
  Hatherleigh said "Hear! Hear!" very resolutely.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I <i>ought</i> to take that as an answer," said Denson, getting
  his shoulder-blades well down to the seat of his chair; "but I don't. I
  don't, you know. It's rather a shame to cross-examine you after this fine
  address of yours"&mdash;Chris Robinson on the hearthrug made acquiescent and
  inviting noises&mdash;"but the real question remains how exactly are you
  going to end all these wrongs? There are the administrative questions. If you
  abolish the private owner, I admit you abolish a very complex and clumsy way
  of getting businesses run, land controlled and things in general
  administered, but you don't get rid of the need of administration, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"Democracy," said Chris Robinson.</p>

  <p>"Organised somehow," said Denson. "And it's just the How perplexes me. I
  can quite easily imagine a socialist state administered in a sort of
  scrambling tumult that would be worse than anything we have got now.</p>

  <p>"Nothing could be worse than things are now," said Chris Robinson. "I have
  seen little children&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I submit life on an ill-provisioned raft, for example, could easily be
  worse&mdash;or life in a beleagured town."</p>

  <p>Murmurs.</p>

  <p>They wrangled for some time, and it had the effect upon me of coming out
  from the glow of a good matinee performance into the cold daylight of late
  afternoon. Chris Robinson did not shine in conflict with Denson; he was an
  orator and not a dialectician, and he missed Denson's points and displayed a
  disposition to plunge into untimely pathos and indignation. And Denson hit me
  curiously hard with one of his shafts. "Suppose," he said, "you found
  yourself prime minister&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I looked at Chris Robinson, bright-eyed and his hair a little ruffled and
  his whole being rhetorical, and measured him against the huge machine of
  government muddled and mysterious. Oh! but I was perplexed!</p>

  <p>And then we took him back to Hatherleigh's rooms and drank beer and smoked
  about him while he nursed his knee with hairy wristed hands that protruded
  from his flannel shirt, and drank lemonade under the cartoon of that
  emancipated Worker, and we had a great discursive talk with him.</p>

  <p>"Eh! you should see our big meetings up north?" he said.</p>

  <p>Denson had ruffled him and worried him a good deal, and ever and again he
  came back to that discussion. "It's all very easy for your learned men to sit
  and pick holes," he said, "while the children suffer and die. They don't pick
  holes up north. They mean business."</p>

  <p>He talked, and that was the most interesting part of it all, of his going
  to work in a factory when he was twelve&mdash;"when you Chaps were all with
  your mammies "&mdash;and how he had educated himself of nights until he would
  fall asleep at his reading.</p>

  <p>"It's made many of us keen for all our lives," he remarked, "all that
  clemming for education. Why! I longed all through one winter to read a bit of
  Darwin. I must know about this Darwin if I die for it, I said. And I could
  no' get the book."</p>

  <p>Hatherleigh made an enthusiastic noise and drank beer at him with round
  eyes over the mug.</p>

  <p>"Well, anyhow I wasted no time on Greek and Latin," said Chris Robinson.
  "And one learns to go straight at a thing without splitting straws. One gets
  hold of the Elementals."</p>

  <p>(Well, did they? That was the gist of my perplexity.)</p>

  <p>"One doesn't quibble," he said, returning to his rankling memory of
  Denson, "while men decay and starve."</p>

  <p>"But suppose," I said, suddenly dropping into opposition, "the alternative
  is to risk a worse disaster&mdash;or do something patently futile."</p>

  <p>"I don't follow that," said Chris Robinson. "We don't propose anything
  futile, so far as I can see."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">The prevailing force in my undergraduate days was not
  Socialism but Kiplingism. Our set was quite exceptional in its socialistic
  professions. And we were all, you must understand, very distinctly
  Imperialists also, and professed a vivid sense of the "White Man's
  Burden."</p>

  <p>It is a little difficult now to get back to the feelings of that period;
  Kipling has since been so mercilessly and exhaustively mocked, criticised and
  torn to shreds;&mdash;never was a man so violently exalted and then, himself
  assisting, so relentlessly called down. But in the middle nineties this
  spectacled and moustached little figure with its heavy chin and its general
  effect of vehement gesticulation, its wild shouts of boyish enthusiasm for
  effective force, its lyric delight in the sounds and colours, in the very
  odours of empire, its wonderful discovery of machinery and cotton waste and
  the under officer and the engineer, and "shop" as a poetic dialect, became
  almost a national symbol. He got hold of us wonderfully, he filled us with
  tinkling and haunting quotations, he stirred Britten and myself to futile
  imitations, he coloured the very idiom of our conversation. He rose to his
  climax with his "Recessional," while I was still an undergraduate.</p>

  <p>What did he give me exactly?</p>

  <p>He helped to broaden my geographical sense immensely, and he provided
  phrases for just that desire for discipline and devotion and organised effort
  the Socialism of our time failed to express, that the current socialist
  movement still fails, I think, to express. The sort of thing that follows,
  for example, tore something out of my inmost nature and gave it a shape, and
  I took it back from him shaped and let much of the rest of him, the tumult
  and the bullying, the hysteria and the impatience, the incoherence and
  inconsistency, go uncriticised for the sake of it:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Keep ye the Law&mdash;be swift in all obedience&mdash;Clear the land of
  evil, drive the road and bridge the ford, Make ye sure to each his own That
  he reap where he hath sown; By the peace among Our peoples let men know we
  serve the Lord!"</p>

  <p>And then again, and for all our later criticism, this sticks in my mind,
  sticks there now as quintessential wisdom:</p>

  <p>"The 'eathen in 'is blindness bows down to wood an' stone; 'E don't obey
  no orders unless they is 'is own; 'E keeps 'is side-arms awful: 'e leaves 'em
  all about An' then comes up the regiment an' pokes the 'eathen out. All along
  o' dirtiness, all along o' mess, All along o' doin' things
  rather-more-or-less, All along of abby-nay, kul, an' hazar-ho, Mind you keep
  your rifle an' yourself jus' so!"</p>

  <p>It is after all a secondary matter that Kipling, not having been born and
  brought up in Bromstead and Penge, and the war in South Africa being yet in
  the womb of time, could quite honestly entertain the now remarkable delusion
  that England had her side-arms at that time kept anything but "awful." He
  learnt better, and we all learnt with him in the dark years of exasperating
  and humiliating struggle that followed, and I do not see that we fellow
  learners are justified in turning resentfully upon him for a common ignorance
  and assumption...</p>

  <p>South Africa seems always painted on the back cloth of my Cambridge
  memories. How immense those disasters seemed at the time, disasters our
  facile English world has long since contrived in any edifying or profitable
  sense to forget! How we thrilled to the shouting newspaper sellers as the
  first false flush of victory gave place to the realisation of defeat. Far
  away there our army showed itself human, mortal and human in the sight of all
  the world, the pleasant officers we had imagined would change to wonderful
  heroes at the first crackling of rifles, remained the pleasant, rather
  incompetent men they had always been, failing to imagine, failing to plan and
  co-operate, failing to grip. And the common soldiers, too, they were just
  what our streets and country-side had made them, no sudden magic came out of
  the war bugles for them. Neither splendid nor disgraceful were
  they,&mdash;just ill-trained and fairly plucky and wonderfully good-tempered
  men&mdash;paying for it. And how it lowered our vitality all that first
  winter to hear of Nicholson's Nek, and then presently close upon one another,
  to realise the bloody waste of Magersfontein, the shattering retreat from
  Stormberg, Colenso&mdash;Colenso, that blundering battle, with White, as it
  seemed, in Ladysmith near the point of surrender! and so through the long
  unfolding catalogue of bleak disillusionments, of aching, unconcealed anxiety
  lest worse should follow. To advance upon your enemy singing about his lack
  of cleanliness and method went out of fashion altogether! The dirty
  retrogressive Boer vanished from our scheme of illusion.</p>

  <p>All through my middle Cambridge period, the guns boomed and the rifles
  crackled away there on the veldt, and the horsemen rode and the tale of
  accidents and blundering went on. Men, mules, horses, stores and money poured
  into South Africa, and the convalescent wounded streamed home. I see it in my
  memory as if I had looked at it through a window instead of through the pages
  of the illustrated papers; I recall as if I had been there the wide open
  spaces, the ragged hillsides, the open order attacks of helmeted men in
  khaki, the scarce visible smoke of the guns, the wrecked trains in great
  lonely places, the burnt isolated farms, and at last the blockhouses and the
  fences of barbed wire uncoiling and spreading for endless miles across the
  desert, netting the elusive enemy until at last, though he broke the meshes
  again and again, we had him in the toils. If one's attention strayed in the
  lecture-room it wandered to those battle-fields.</p>

  <p>And that imagined panorama of war unfolds to an accompaniment of yelling
  newsboys in the narrow old Cambridge streets, of the flicker of papers
  hastily bought and torn open in the twilight, of the doubtful reception of
  doubtful victories, and the insensate rejoicings at last that seemed to some
  of us more shameful than defeats...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">A book that stands out among these memories, that stimulated
  me immensely so that I forced it upon my companions, half in the spirit of
  propaganda and half to test it by their comments, was Meredith's <i>One of
  Our Conquerors</i>. It is one of the books that have made me. In that I got a
  supplement and corrective of Kipling. It was the first detached and adverse
  criticism of the Englishman I had ever encountered. It must have been
  published already nine or ten years when I read it. The country had paid no
  heed to it, had gone on to the expensive lessons of the War because of the
  dull aversion our people feel for all such intimations, and so I could read
  it as a book justified. The war endorsed its every word for me, underlined
  each warning indication of the gigantic dangers that gathered against our
  system across the narrow seas. It discovered Europe to me, as watching and
  critical.</p>

  <p>But while I could respond to all its criticisms of my country's
  intellectual indolence, of my country's want of training and discipline and
  moral courage, I remember that the idea that on the continent there were
  other peoples going ahead of us, mentally alert while we fumbled, disciplined
  while we slouched, aggressive and preparing to bring our Imperial pride to a
  reckoning, was extremely novel and distasteful to me. It set me worrying of
  nights. It put all my projects for social and political reconstruction upon a
  new uncomfortable footing. It made them no longer merely desirable but
  urgent. Instead of pride and the love of making one might own to a baser
  motive. Under Kipling's sway I had a little forgotten the continent of
  Europe, treated it as a mere envious echo to our own world-wide display. I
  began now to have a disturbing sense as it were of busy searchlights over the
  horizon...</p>

  <p>One consequence of the patriotic chagrin Meredith produced in me was an
  attempt to belittle his merit. "It isn't a good novel, anyhow," I said.</p>

  <p>The charge I brought against it was, I remember, a lack of unity. It
  professed to be a study of the English situation in the early nineties, but
  it was all deflected, I said, and all the interest was confused by the story
  of Victor Radnor's fight with society to vindicate the woman he had loved and
  never married. Now in the retrospect and with a mind full of bitter
  enlightenment, I can do Meredith justice, and admit the conflict was not only
  essential but cardinal in his picture, that the terrible inflexibility of the
  rich aunts and the still more terrible claim of Mrs. Burman Radnor, the
  "infernal punctilio," and Dudley Sowerby's limitations, were the central
  substance of that inalertness the book set itself to assail. So many things
  have been brought together in my mind that were once remotely separated. A
  people that will not valiantly face and understand and admit love and passion
  can understand nothing whatever. But in those days what is now just obvious
  truth to me was altogether outside my range of comprehension...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 8</h3>

  <p class="first">As I seek to recapitulate the interlacing growth of my
  apprehension of the world, as I flounder among the half-remembered
  developments that found me a crude schoolboy and left me a man, there comes
  out, as if it stood for all the rest, my first holiday abroad. That did not
  happen until I was twenty-two. I was a fellow of Trinity, and the Peace of
  Vereeniging had just been signed.</p>

  <p>I went with a man named Willersley, a man some years senior to myself, who
  had just missed a fellowship and the higher division of the Civil Service,
  and who had become an enthusiastic member of the London School Board, upon
  which the cumulative vote and the support of the "advanced" people had placed
  him. He had, like myself, a small independent income that relieved him of any
  necessity to earn a living, and he had a kindred craving for social
  theorising and some form of social service. He had sought my acquaintance
  after reading a paper of mine (begotten by the visit of Chris Robinson) on
  the limits of pure democracy. It had marched with some thoughts of his
  own.</p>

  <p>We went by train to Spiez on the Lake of Thun, then up the Gemmi, and
  thence with one or two halts and digressions and a little modest climbing we
  crossed over by the Antrona pass (on which we were benighted) into Italy, and
  by way of Domo D'ossola and the Santa Maria Maggiore valley to Cannobio, and
  thence up the lake to Locarno (where, as I shall tell, we stayed some
  eventful days) and so up the Val Maggia and over to Airolo and home.</p>

  <p>As I write of that long tramp of ours, something of its freshness and
  enlargement returns to me. I feel again the faint pleasant excitement of the
  boat train, the trampling procession of people with hand baggage and laden
  porters along the platform of the Folkestone pier, the scarcely perceptible
  swaying of the moored boat beneath our feet. Then, very obvious and simple,
  the little emotion of standing out from the homeland and seeing the long
  white Kentish cliffs recede. One walked about the boat doing one's best not
  to feel absurdly adventurous, and presently a movement of people directed
  one's attention to a white lighthouse on a cliff to the east of us, coming up
  suddenly; and then one turned to scan the little different French coast
  villages, and then, sliding by in a pale sunshine came a long wooden pier
  with oddly dressed children upon it, and the clustering town of Boulogne.</p>

  <p>One took it all with the outward calm that became a young man of nearly
  three and twenty, but one was alive to one's finger-tips with pleasing little
  stimulations. The custom house examination excited one, the strangeness of a
  babble in a foreign tongue; one found the French of City Merchants' and
  Cambridge a shy and viscous flow, and then one was standing in the train as
  it went slowly through the rail-laid street to Boulogne Ville, and one looked
  out at the world in French, porters in blouses, workmen in enormous purple
  trousers, police officers in peaked caps instead of helmets and romantically
  cloaked, big carts, all on two wheels instead of four, green shuttered
  casements instead of sash windows, and great numbers of neatly dressed women
  in economical mourning.</p>

  <p>"Oh! there's a priest!" one said, and was betrayed into suchlike artless
  cries.</p>

  <p>It was a real other world, with different government and different
  methods, and in the night one was roused from uneasy slumbers and sat
  blinking and surly, wrapped up in one's couverture and with one's oreiller
  all awry, to encounter a new social phenomenon, the German official, so
  different in manner from the British; and when one woke again after that one
  had come to Bale, and out one tumbled to get coffee in Switzerland...</p>

  <p>I have been over that route dozens of times since, but it still revives a
  certain lingering youthfulness, a certain sense of cheerful release in
  me.</p>

  <p>I remember that I and Willersley became very sociological as we ran on to
  Spiez, and made all sorts of generalisations from the steeply sloping fields
  on the hillsides, and from the people we saw on platforms and from little
  differences in the way things were done.</p>

  <p>The clean prosperity of Bale and Switzerland, the big clean stations,
  filled me with patriotic misgivings, as I thought of the vast dirtiness of
  London, the mean dirtiness of Cambridgeshire. It came to me that perhaps my
  scheme of international values was all wrong, that quite stupendous
  possibilities and challenges for us and our empire might be developing here
  &mdash;and I recalled Meredith's Skepsey in France with a new
  understanding.</p>

  <p>Willersley had dressed himself in a world-worn Norfolk suit of greenish
  grey tweeds that ended unfamiliarly at his rather impending, spectacled,
  intellectual visage. I didn't, I remember, like the contrast of him with the
  drilled Swiss and Germans about us. Convict coloured stockings and vast
  hobnail boots finished him below, and all his luggage was a borrowed rucksac
  that he had tied askew. He did not want to shave in the train, but I made him
  at one of the Swiss stations&mdash;I dislike these Oxford
  slovenlinesses&mdash;and then confound him! he cut himself and bled...</p>

  <p>Next morning we were breathing a thin exhilarating air that seemed to have
  washed our very veins to an incredible cleanliness, and eating hard-boiled
  eggs in a vast clear space of rime-edged rocks, snow-mottled, above a blue-
  gashed glacier. All about us the monstrous rock surfaces rose towards the
  shining peaks above, and there were winding moraines from which the ice had
  receded, and then dark clustering fir trees far below.</p>

  <p>I had an extraordinary feeling of having come out of things, of being
  outside.</p>

  <p>"But this is the round world!" I said, with a sense of never having
  perceived it before; "this is the round world!"</p><br>

  <h3>§ 9</h3>

  <p class="first">That holiday was full of big comprehensive effects; the
  first view of the Rhone valley and the distant Valaisian Alps, for example,
  which we saw from the shoulder of the mountain above the Gemmi, and the early
  summer dawn breaking over Italy as we moved from our night's crouching and
  munched bread and chocolate and stretched our stiff limbs among the tumbled
  and precipitous rocks that hung over Lake Cingolo, and surveyed the winding
  tiring rocky track going down and down to Antronapiano.</p>

  <p>And our thoughts were as comprehensive as our impressions. Willersley's
  mind abounded in historical matter; he had an inaccurate abundant habit of
  topographical reference; he made me see and trace and see again the Roman
  Empire sweep up these winding valleys, and the coming of the first great
  Peace among the warring tribes of men...</p>

  <p>In the retrospect each of us seems to have been talking about our outlook
  almost continually. Each of us, you see, was full of the same question, very
  near and altogether predominant to us, the question: "What am I going to do
  with my life?" He saw it almost as importantly as I, but from a different
  angle, because his choice was largely made and mine still hung in the
  balance.</p>

  <p>"I feel we might do so many things," I said, "and everything that calls
  one, calls one away from something else."</p>

  <p>Willersley agreed without any modest disavowals.</p>

  <p>"We have got to think out," he said, "just what we are and what we are up
  to. We've got to do that now. And then&mdash;it's one of those questions it
  is inadvisable to reopen subsequently."</p>

  <p>He beamed at me through his glasses. The sententious use of long words was
  a playful habit with him, that and a slight deliberate humour, habits
  occasional Extension Lecturing was doing very much to intensify.</p>

  <p>"You've made your decision?"</p>

  <p>He nodded with a peculiar forward movement of his head.</p>

  <p>"How would you put it?"</p>

  <p>"Social Service&mdash;education. Whatever else matters or doesn't matter,
  it seems to me there is one thing we <i>must</i> have and increase, and that
  is the number of people who can think a little&mdash;and have"&mdash;he
  beamed again&mdash;"an adequate sense of causation."</p>

  <p>"You're sure it's worth while."</p>

  <p>"For me&mdash;certainly. I don't discuss that any more."</p>

  <p>"I don't limit myself too narrowly," he added. "After all, the work is all
  one. We who know, we who feel, are building the great modern state, joining
  wall to wall and way to way, the new great England rising out of the decaying
  old ... we are the real statesmen&mdash;I like that use of
  'statesmen.'..."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said with many doubts. "Yes, of course..."</p>

  <p>Willersley is middle-aged now, with silver in his hair and a deepening
  benevolence in his always amiable face, and he has very fairly kept his word.
  He has lived for social service and to do vast masses of useful,
  undistinguished, fertilising work. Think of the days of arid administrative
  plodding and of contention still more arid and unrewarded, that he must have
  spent! His little affectations of gesture and manner, imitative affectations
  for the most part, have increased, and the humorous beam and the humorous
  intonations have become a thing he puts on every morning like an old coat.
  His devotion is mingled with a considerable whimsicality, and they say he is
  easily flattered by subordinates and easily offended into opposition by
  colleagues; he has made mistakes at times and followed wrong courses, still
  there he is, a flat contradiction to all the ordinary doctrine of motives, a
  man who has foregone any chances of wealth and profit, foregone any easier
  paths to distinction, foregone marriage and parentage, in order to serve the
  community. He does it without any fee or reward except his personal
  self-satisfaction in doing this work, and he does it without any hope of
  future joys and punishments, for he is an implacable Rationalist. No doubt he
  idealises himself a little, and dreams of recognition. No doubt he gets his
  pleasure from a sense of power, from the spending and husbanding of large
  sums of public money, and from the inevitable proprietorship he must feel in
  the fair, fine, well-ordered schools he has done so much to develop. "But for
  me," he can say, "there would have been a Job about those diagrams, and that
  subject or this would have been less ably taught."...</p>

  <p>The fact remains that for him the rewards have been adequate, if not to
  content at any rate to keep him working. Of course he covets the notice of
  the world he has served, as a lover covets the notice of his mistress. Of
  course he thinks somewhere, somewhen, he will get credit. Only last year I
  heard some men talking of him, and they were noting, with little mean smiles,
  how he had shown himself self-conscious while there was talk of some honorary
  degree-giving or other; it would, I have no doubt, please him greatly if his
  work were to flower into a crimson gown in some Academic parterre. Why
  shouldn't it? But that is incidental vanity at the worst; he goes on anyhow.
  Most men don't.</p>

  <p>But we had our walk twenty years and more ago now. He was oldish even then
  as a young man, just as he is oldish still in middle age. Long may his
  industrious elderliness flourish for the good of the world! He lectured a
  little in conversation then; he lectures more now and listens less,
  toilsomely disentangling what you already understand, giving you in detail
  the data you know; these are things like callosities that come from a man's
  work.</p>

  <p>Our long three weeks' talk comes back to me as a memory of ideas and
  determinations slowly growing, all mixed up with a smell of wood smoke and
  pine woods and huge precipices and remote gleams of snow-fields and the sound
  of cascading torrents rushing through deep gorges far below. It is mixed,
  too, with gossips with waitresses and fellow travellers, with my first essays
  in colloquial German and Italian, with disputes about the way to take, and
  other things that I will tell of in another section. But the white passion of
  human service was our dominant theme. Not simply perhaps nor altogether
  unselfishly, but quite honestly, and with at least a frequent
  self-forgetfulness, did we want to do fine and noble things, to help in their
  developing, to lessen misery, to broaden and exalt life. It is very
  hard&mdash;perhaps it is impossible&mdash;to present in a page or two the
  substance and quality of nearly a month's conversation, conversation that is
  casual and discursive in form, that ranges carelessly from triviality to
  immensity, and yet is constantly resuming a constructive process, as workmen
  on a wall loiter and jest and go and come back, and all the while build.</p>

  <p>We got it more and more definite that the core of our purpose beneath all
  its varied aspects must needs be order and discipline. "Muddle," said I, "is
  the enemy." That remains my belief to this day. Clearness and order, light
  and foresight, these things I know for Good. It was muddle had just given us
  all the still freshly painful disasters and humiliations of the war, muddle
  that gives us the visibly sprawling disorder of our cities and industrial
  country-side, muddle that gives us the waste of life, the limitations,
  wretchedness and unemployment of the poor. Muddle! I remember myself quoting
  Kipling&mdash;</p>

  <p>"All along o' dirtiness, all along o' mess, All along o' doin' things
  rather-more-or-less."</p>

  <p>"We build the state," we said over and over again. "That is what we are
  for&mdash;servants of the new reorganisation!"</p>

  <p>We planned half in earnest and half Utopianising, a League of Social
  Service.</p>

  <p>We talked of the splendid world of men that might grow out of such unpaid
  and ill-paid work as we were setting our faces to do. We spoke of the
  intricate difficulties, the monstrous passive resistances, the hostilities to
  such a development as we conceived our work subserved, and we spoke with that
  underlying confidence in the invincibility of the causes we adopted that is
  natural to young and scarcely tried men.</p>

  <p>We talked much of the detailed life of politics so far as it was known to
  us, and there Willersley was more experienced and far better informed than I;
  we discussed possible combinations and possible developments, and the chances
  of some great constructive movement coming from the heart-searchings the Boer
  war had occasioned. We would sink to gossip&mdash;even at the Suetonius
  level. Willersley would decline towards illuminating anecdotes that I capped
  more or less loosely from my private reading. We were particularly wise, I
  remember, upon the management of newspapers, because about that we knew
  nothing whatever. We perceived that great things were to be done through
  newspapers. We talked of swaying opinion and moving great classes to massive
  action.</p>

  <p>Men are egotistical even in devotion. All our splendid projects were
  thickset with the first personal pronoun. We both could write, and all that
  we said in general terms was reflected in the particular in our minds; it was
  ourselves we saw, and no others, writing and speaking that moving word. We
  had already produced manuscript and passed the initiations of proof reading;
  I had been a frequent speaker in the Union, and Willersley was an active man
  on the School Board. Our feet were already on the lower rungs that led up and
  up. He was six and twenty, and I twenty-two. We intimated our individual
  careers in terms of bold expectation. I had prophetic glimpses of walls and
  hoardings clamorous with "Vote for Remington," and Willersley no doubt saw
  himself chairman of this committee and that, saying a few slightly ironical
  words after the declaration of the poll, and then sitting friendly beside me
  on the government benches. There was nothing impossible in such dreams. Why
  not the Board of Education for him? My preference at that time wavered
  between the Local Government Board&mdash;I had great ideas about
  town-planning, about revisions of municipal areas and re-organised internal
  transit&mdash;and the War Office. I swayed strongly towards the latter as the
  journey progressed. My educational bias came later.</p>

  <p>The swelling ambitions that have tramped over Alpine passes! How many of
  them, like mine, have come almost within sight of realisation before they
  failed?</p>

  <p>There were times when we posed like young gods (of unassuming exterior),
  and times when we were full of the absurdest little solicitudes about our
  prospects. There were times when one surveyed the whole world of men as if it
  was a little thing at one's feet, and by way of contrast I remember once
  lying in bed&mdash;it must have been during this holiday, though I cannot for
  the life of me fix where&mdash;and speculating whether perhaps some day I
  might not be a K. C. B., Sir Richard Remington, K. C. B., M. P.</p>

  <p>But the big style prevailed...</p>

  <p>We could not tell from minute to minute whether we were planning for a
  world of solid reality, or telling ourselves fairy tales about this prospect
  of life. So much seemed possible, and everything we could think of so
  improbable. There were lapses when it seemed to me I could never be anything
  but just the entirely unimportant and undistinguished young man I was for
  ever and ever. I couldn't even think of myself as five and thirty.</p>

  <p>Once I remember Willersley going over a list of failures, and why they had
  failed&mdash;but young men in the twenties do not know much about
  failures.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 10</h3>

  <p class="first">Willersley and I professed ourselves Socialists, but by this
  time I knew my Rodbertus as well as my Marx, and there was much in our
  socialism that would have shocked Chris Robinson as much as anything in life
  could have shocked him. Socialism as a simple democratic cry we had done with
  for ever. We were socialists because Individualism for us meant muddle, meant
  a crowd of separated, undisciplined little people all obstinately and
  ignorantly doing things jarringly, each one in his own way. "Each," I said
  quoting words of my father's that rose apt in my memory, "snarling from his
  own little bit of property, like a dog tied to a cart's tail."</p>

  <p>"Essentially," said Willersley, "essentially we're for conscription, in
  peace and war alike. The man who owns property is a public official and has
  to behave as such. That's the gist of socialism as I understand it."</p>

  <p>"Or be dismissed from his post," I said, "and replaced by some better sort
  of official. A man's none the less an official because he's irresponsible.
  What he does with his property affects people just the same. Private! No one
  is really private but an outlaw..."</p>

  <p>Order and devotion were the very essence of our socialism, and a splendid
  collective vigour and happiness its end. We projected an ideal state, an
  organised state as confident and powerful as modern science, as balanced and
  beautiful as a body, as beneficent as sunshine, the organised state that
  should end muddle for ever; it ruled all our ideals and gave form to all our
  ambitions.</p>

  <p>Every man was to be definitely related to that, to have his predominant
  duty to that. Such was the England renewed we had in mind, and how to serve
  that end, to subdue undisciplined worker and undisciplined wealth to it, and
  make the Scientific Commonweal, King, was the continuing substance of our
  intercourse.</p><br>

  <p class="first">Every day the wine of the mountains was stronger in our
  blood, and the flush of our youth deeper. We would go in the morning sunlight
  along some narrow Alpine mule-path shouting large suggestions for national
  reorganisation, and weighing considerations as lightly as though the world
  was wax in our hands. "Great England," we said in effect, over and over
  again, "and we will be among the makers! England renewed! The country has
  been warned; it has learnt its lesson. The disasters and anxieties of the war
  have sunk in. England has become serious... Oh! there are big things before
  us to do; big enduring things!"</p>

  <p>One evening we walked up to the loggia of a little pilgrimage church, I
  forget its name, that stands out on a conical hill at the head of a winding
  stair above the town of Locarno. Down below the houses clustered amidst a
  confusion of heat-bitten greenery. I had been sitting silently on the
  parapet, looking across to the purple mountain masses where Switzerland
  passes into Italy, and the drift of our talk seemed suddenly to gather to a
  head.</p>

  <p>I broke into speech, giving form to the thoughts that had been
  accumulating. My words have long since passed out of my memory, the phrases
  of familiar expression have altered for me, but the substance remains as
  clear as ever. I said how we were in our measure emperors and kings, men
  undriven, free to do as we pleased with life; we classed among the happy
  ones, our bread and common necessities were given us for nothing, we had
  abilities,&mdash;it wasn't modesty but cowardice to behave as if we
  hadn't&mdash;and Fortune watched us to see what we might do with opportunity
  and the world.</p>

  <p>"There are so many things to do, you see," began Willersley, in his
  judicial lecturer's voice.</p>

  <p>"So many things we may do," I interrupted, "with all these years before
  us... We're exceptional men. It's our place, our duty, to do things."</p>

  <p>"Here anyhow," I said, answering the faint amusement of his face; "I've
  got no modesty. Everything conspires to set me up. Why should I run about
  like all those grubby little beasts down there, seeking nothing but mean
  little vanities and indulgencies&mdash;and then take credit for modesty? I
  <i>know</i> I am capable. I <i>know</i> I have imagination. Modesty! I know
  if I don't attempt the very biggest things in life I am a damned shirk. The
  very biggest! Somebody has to attempt them. I feel like a loaded gun that is
  only a little perplexed because it has to find out just where to aim
  itself..."</p>

  <p>The lake and the frontier villages, a white puff of steam on the distant
  railway to Luino, the busy boats and steamers trailing triangular wakes of
  foam, the long vista eastward towards battlemented Bellinzona, the vast
  mountain distances, now tinged with sunset light, behind this nearer
  landscape, and the southward waters with remote coast towns shining dimly,
  waters that merged at last in a luminous golden haze, made a broad panoramic
  spectacle. It was as if one surveyed the world,&mdash;and it was like the
  games I used to set out upon my nursery floor. I was exalted by it; I felt
  larger than men. So kings should feel.</p>

  <p>That sense of largeness came to me then, and it has come to me since,
  again and again, a splendid intimation or a splendid vanity. Once, I
  remember, when I looked at Genoa from the mountain crest behind the town and
  saw that multitudinous place in all its beauty of width and abundance and
  clustering human effort, and once as I was steaming past the brown low hills
  of Staten Island towards the towering vigour and clamorous vitality of New
  York City, that mood rose to its quintessence. And once it came to me, as I
  shall tell, on Dover cliffs. And a hundred times when I have thought of
  England as our country might be, with no wretched poor, no wretched rich, a
  nation armed and ordered, trained and purposeful amidst its vales and rivers,
  that emotion of collective ends and collective purposes has returned to me. I
  felt as great as humanity. For a brief moment I was humanity, looking at the
  world I had made and had still to make...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 12</h3>

  <p class="first">And mingled with these dreams of power and patriotic service
  there was another series of a different quality and a different colour, like
  the antagonistic colour of a shot silk. The white life and the red life,
  contrasted and interchanged, passing swiftly at a turn from one to another,
  and refusing ever to mingle peacefully one with the other. I was asking
  myself openly and distinctly: what are you going to do for the world? What
  are you going to do with yourself? and with an increasing strength and
  persistence Nature in spite of my averted attention was asking me in
  penetrating undertones: what are you going to do about this other fundamental
  matter, the beauty of girls and women and your desire for them?</p>

  <p>I have told of my sisterless youth and the narrow circumstances of my
  upbringing. It made all women-kind mysterious to me. If it had not been for
  my Staffordshire cousins I do not think I should have known any girls at all
  until I was twenty. Of Staffordshire I will tell a little later. But I can
  remember still how through all those ripening years, the thought of women's
  beauty, their magic presence in the world beside me and the unknown, untried
  reactions of their intercourse, grew upon me and grew, as a strange presence
  grows in a room when one is occupied by other things. I busied myself and
  pretended to be wholly occupied, and there the woman stood, full half of life
  neglected, and it seemed to my averted mind sometimes that she was there clad
  and dignified and divine, and sometimes Aphrodite shining and commanding, and
  sometimes that Venus who stoops and allures.</p>

  <p>This travel abroad seemed to have released a multitude of things in my
  mind; the clear air, the beauty of the sunshine, the very blue of the
  glaciers made me feel my body and quickened all those disregarded dreams. I
  saw the sheathed beauty of women's forms all about me, in the cheerful
  waitresses at the inns, in the pedestrians one encountered in the tracks, in
  the chance fellow travellers at the hotel tables. "Confound it!" said I, and
  talked all the more zealously of that greater England that was calling
  us.</p>

  <p>I remember that we passed two Germans, an old man and a tall fair girl,
  father and daughter, who were walking down from Saas. She came swinging and
  shining towards us, easy and strong. I worshipped her as she approached.</p>

  <p>"Gut Tag!" said Willersley, removing his hat.</p>

  <p>"Morgen!" said the old man, saluting.</p>

  <p>I stared stockishly at the girl, who passed with an indifferent face.</p>

  <p>That sticks in my mind as a picture remains in a room, it has kept there
  bright and fresh as a thing seen yesterday, for twenty years...</p>

  <p>I flirted hesitatingly once or twice with comely serving girls, and was a
  little ashamed lest Willersley should detect the keen interest I took in
  them, and then as we came over the pass from Santa Maria Maggiore to
  Cannobio, my secret preoccupation took me by surprise and flooded me and
  broke down my pretences.</p>

  <p>The women in that valley are very beautiful&mdash;women vary from valley
  to valley in the Alps and are plain and squat here and divinities five miles
  away&mdash;and as we came down we passed a group of five or six of them
  resting by the wayside. Their burthens were beside them, and one like Ceres
  held a reaping hook in her brown hand. She watched us approaching and smiled
  faintly, her eyes at mine.</p>

  <p>There was some greeting, and two of them laughed together.</p>

  <p>We passed.</p>

  <p>"Glorious girls they were," said Willersley, and suddenly an immense sense
  of boredom enveloped me. I saw myself striding on down that winding road,
  talking of politics and parties and bills of parliament and all sorts of
  dessicated things. That road seemed to me to wind on for ever down to dust
  and infinite dreariness. I knew it for a way of death. Reality was behind
  us.</p>

  <p>Willersley set himself to draw a sociological moral. "I'm not so sure," he
  said in a voice of intense discriminations, "after all, that agricultural
  work isn't good for women."</p>

  <p>"Damn agricultural work!" I said, and broke out into a vigorous cursing of
  all I held dear. "Fettered things we are!" I cried. "I wonder why I stand
  it!"</p>

  <p>"Stand what?"</p>

  <p>"Why don't I go back and make love to those girls and let the world and
  you and everything go hang? Deep breasts and rounded limbs&mdash;and we poor
  emasculated devils go tramping by with the blood of youth in us! ..."</p>

  <p>"I'm not quite sure, Remington," said Willersley, looking at me with a
  deliberately quaint expression over his glasses, "that picturesque scenery is
  altogether good for your morals."</p>

  <p>That fever was still in my blood when we came to Locarno.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 13</h3>

  <p class="first">Along the hot and dusty lower road between the Orrido of
  Traffiume and Cannobio Willersley had developed his first blister. And partly
  because of that and partly because there was a bag at the station that gave
  us the refreshment of clean linen and partly because of the lazy lower air
  into which we had come, we decided upon three or four days' sojourn in the
  Empress Hotel.</p>

  <p>We dined that night at a table-d'hote, and I found myself next to an
  Englishwoman who began a conversation that was resumed presently in the hotel
  lounge. She was a woman of perhaps thirty-three or thirty-four, slenderly
  built, with a warm reddish skin and very abundant fair golden hair, the wife
  of a petulant-looking heavy-faced man of perhaps fifty-three, who smoked a
  cigar and dozed over his coffee and presently went to bed. "He always goes to
  bed like that," she confided startlingly. "He sleeps after all his meals. I
  never knew such a man to sleep."</p>

  <p>Then she returned to our talk, whatever it was.</p>

  <p>We had begun at the dinner table with itineraries and the usual
  topographical talk, and she had envied our pedestrian travel. "My husband
  doesn't walk," she said. "His heart is weak and he cannot manage the
  hills."</p>

  <p>There was something friendly and adventurous in her manner; she conveyed
  she liked me, and when presently Willersley drifted off to write letters our
  talk sank at once to easy confidential undertones. I felt enterprising, and
  indeed it is easy to be daring with people one has never seen before and may
  never see again. I said I loved beautiful scenery and all beautiful things,
  and the pointing note in my voice made her laugh. She told me I had bold
  eyes, and so far as I can remember I said she made them bold. "Blue they
  are," she remarked, smiling archly. "I like blue eyes." Then I think we
  compared ages, and she said she was the Woman of Thirty, "George Moore's
  Woman of Thirty."</p>

  <p>I had not read George Moore at the time, but I pretended to
  understand.</p>

  <p>That, I think, was our limit that evening. She went to bed, smiling good-
  night quite prettily down the big staircase, and I and Willersley went out to
  smoke in the garden. My head was full of her, and I found it necessary to
  talk about her. So I made her a problem in sociology. "Who the deuce are
  these people?" I said, "and how do they get a living? They seem to have
  plenty of money. He strikes me as being&mdash;Willersley, what is a
  drysalter? I think he's a retired drysalter."</p>

  <p>Willersley theorised while I thought of the woman and that provocative
  quality of dash she had displayed. The next day at lunch she and I met like
  old friends. A huge mass of private thinking during the interval had been
  added to our effect upon one another. We talked for a time of insignificant
  things.</p>

  <p>"What do you do," she asked rather quickly, "after lunch? Take a
  siesta?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes," I said, and hung for a moment eye to eye.</p>

  <p>We hadn't a doubt of each other, but my heart was beating like a steamer
  propeller when it lifts out of the water.</p>

  <p>"Do you get a view from your room?" she asked after a pause.</p>

  <p>"It's on the third floor, Number seventeen, near the staircase. My
  friend's next door."</p>

  <p>She began to talk of books. She was interested in Christian Science, she
  said, and spoke of a book. I forget altogether what that book was called,
  though I remember to this day with the utmost exactness the purplish magenta
  of its cover. She said she would lend it to me and hesitated.</p>

  <p>Willersley wanted to go for an expedition across the lake that afternoon,
  but I refused. He made some other proposals that I rejected abruptly. "I
  shall write in my room," I said.</p>

  <p>"Why not write down here?"</p>

  <p>"I shall write in my room," I snarled like a thwarted animal, and he
  looked at me curiously. "Very well," he said; "then I'll make some notes and
  think about that order of ours out under the magnolias."</p>

  <p>I hovered about the lounge for a time buying postcards and feverishly
  restless, watching the movements of the other people. Finally I went up to my
  room and sat down by the windows, staring out. There came a little tap at the
  unlocked door and in an instant, like the go of a taut bowstring, I was up
  and had it open.</p>

  <p>"Here is that book," she said, and we hesitated.</p>

  <p>"COME IN!" I whispered, trembling from head to foot.</p>

  <p>"You're just a boy," she said in a low tone.</p>

  <p>I did not feel a bit like a lover, I felt like a burglar with the safe-
  door nearly opened. "Come in," I said almost impatiently, for anyone might be
  in the passage, and I gripped her wrist and drew her towards me.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she answered with a faint smile on her lips, and
  awkward and yielding.</p>

  <p>I shut the door behind her, still holding her with one hand, then turned
  upon her&mdash;she was laughing nervously&mdash;and without a word drew her
  to me and kissed her. And I remember that as I kissed her she made a little
  noise almost like the purring miaow with which a cat will greet one and her
  face, close to mine, became solemn and tender.</p>

  <p>She was suddenly a different being from the discontented wife who had
  tapped a moment since on my door, a woman transfigured...</p>

  <p>That evening I came down to dinner a monster of pride, for behold! I was a
  man. I felt myself the most wonderful and unprecedented of adventurers. It
  was hard to believe that any one in the world before had done as much. My
  mistress and I met smiling, we carried things off admirably, and it seemed to
  me that Willersley was the dullest old dog in the world. I wanted to give him
  advice. I wanted to give him derisive pokes. After dinner and coffee in the
  lounge I was too excited and hilarious to go to bed, I made him come with me
  down to the cafe under the arches by the pier, and there drank beer and
  talked extravagant nonsense about everything under the sun, in order not to
  talk about the happenings of the afternoon. All the time something shouted
  within me: "I am a man! I am a man!"...</p>

  <p>"What shall we do to-morrow?" said he.</p>

  <p>"I'm for loafing," I said. "Let's row in the morning and spend to-morrow
  afternoon just as we did to-day."</p>

  <p>"They say the church behind the town is worth seeing."</p>

  <p>"We'll go up about sunset; that's the best time for it. We can start about
  five."</p>

  <p>We heard music, and went further along the arcade to discover a place
  where girls in operatic Swiss peasant costume were singing and dancing on a
  creaking, protesting little stage. I eyed their generous display of pink neck
  and arm with the seasoned eye of a man who has lived in the world. Life was
  perfectly simple and easy, I felt, if one took it the right way.</p>

  <p>Next day Willersley wanted to go on, but I delayed. Altogether I kept him
  back four days. Then abruptly my mood changed, and we decided to start early
  the following morning. I remember, though a little indistinctly, the feeling
  of my last talk with that woman whose surname, odd as it may seem, either I
  never learnt or I have forgotten. (Her christian name was Milly.) She was
  tired and rather low-spirited, and disposed to be sentimental, and for the
  first time in our intercourse I found myself liking her for the sake of her
  own personality. There was something kindly and generous appearing behind the
  veil of naive and uncontrolled sensuality she had worn. There was a curious
  quality of motherliness in her attitude to me that something in my nature
  answered and approved. She didn't pretend to keep it up that she had yielded
  to my initiative. "I've done you no harm," she said a little doubtfully, an
  odd note for a man's victim! And, "we've had a good time. You have liked me,
  haven't you?"</p>

  <p>She interested me in her lonely dissatisfied life; she was childless and
  had no hope of children, and her husband was the only son of a rich meat
  salesman, very mean, a mighty smoker&mdash;"he reeks of it," she said,
  "always"&mdash;and interested in nothing but golf, billiards (which he played
  very badly), pigeon shooting, convivial Free Masonry and Stock Exchange
  punting. Mostly they drifted about the Riviera. Her mother had contrived her
  marriage when she was eighteen. They were the first samples I ever
  encountered of the great multitude of functionless property owners which
  encumbers modern civilisation&mdash;but at the time I didn't think much of
  that aspect of them...</p>

  <p>I tell all this business as it happened without comment, because I have no
  comment to make. It was all strange to me, strange rather than wonderful,
  and, it may be, some dream of beauty died for ever in those furtive meetings;
  it happened to me, and I could scarcely have been more irresponsible in the
  matter or controlled events less if I had been suddenly pushed over a cliff
  into water. I swam, of course&mdash;finding myself in it. Things tested me,
  and I reacted, as I have told. The bloom of my innocence, if ever there had
  been such a thing, was gone. And here is the remarkable thing about it; at
  the time and for some days I was over-weeningly proud; I have never been so
  proud before or since; I felt I had been promoted to virility; I was unable
  to conceal my exultation from Willersley. It was a mood of shining shameless
  ungracious self-approval. As he and I went along in the cool morning sunshine
  by the rice fields in the throat of the Val Maggia a silence fell between
  us.</p>

  <p>"You know?" I said abruptly,&mdash;"about that woman?"</p>

  <p>Willersley did not answer for a moment. He looked at me over the corner of
  his spectacles.</p>

  <p>"Things went pretty far?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh! all the way!" and I had a twinge of fatuous pride in my
  unpremeditated achievement.</p>

  <p>"She came to your room?"</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"I heard her. I heard her whispering... The whispering and rustling and so
  on. I was in my room yesterday... Any one might have heard you."</p>

  <p>I went on with my head in the air.</p>

  <p>"You might have been caught, and that would have meant endless trouble.
  You might have incurred all sorts of consequences. What did you know about
  her? ... We have wasted four days in that hot close place. When we found that
  League of Social Service we were talking about," he said with a determined
  eye upon me, "chastity will be first among the virtues prescribed."</p>

  <p>"I shall form a rival league," I said a little damped. "I'm hanged if I
  give up a single desire in me until I know why."</p>

  <p>He lifted his chin and stared before him through his glasses at nothing.
  "There are some things," he said, "that a man who means to work&mdash;to do
  great public services&mdash;MUST turn his back upon. I'm not discussing the
  rights or wrongs of this sort of thing. It happens to be the conditions we
  work under. It will probably always be so. If you want to experiment in that
  way, if you want even to discuss it,&mdash;out you go from political life.
  You must know that's so... You're a strange man, Remington, with a kind of
  kink in you. You've a sort of force. You might happen to do immense things...
  Only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped. He had said all that he had forced himself to say.</p>

  <p>"I mean to take myself as I am," I said. "I'm going to get experience for
  humanity out of all my talents&mdash;and bury nothing."</p>

  <p>Willersley twisted his face to its humorous expression. "I doubt if sexual
  proclivities," he said drily, "come within the scope of the parable."</p>

  <p>I let that go for a little while. Then I broke out. "Sex!" said I, "is a
  fundamental thing in life. We went through all this at Trinity. I'm going to
  look at it, experience it, think about it&mdash;and get it square with the
  rest of life. Career and Politics must take their chances of that. It's part
  of the general English slackness that they won't look this in the face. Gods!
  what a muffled time we're coming out of! Sex means breeding, and breeding is
  a necessary function in a nation. The Romans broke up upon that. The
  Americans fade out amidst their successes. Eugenics&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>That</i> wasn't Eugenics," said Willersley.</p>

  <p>"It was a woman," I said after a little interval, feeling oddly that I had
  failed altogether to answer him, and yet had a strong dumb case against
  him.</p>

  <h2><a id="book2"
     name="book2">BOOK II. &mdash; MARGARET</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="chap2_01"
     name="chap2_01"></a>I. &mdash; MARGARET IN STAFFORDSHIRE</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">I must go back a little way with my story. In the previous
  book I have described the kind of education that happens to a man of my class
  nowadays, and it has been convenient to leap a phase in my experience that I
  must now set out at length. I want to tell in this second hook how I came to
  marry, and to do that I must give something of the atmosphere in which I
  first met my wife and some intimations of the forces that went to her making.
  I met her in Staffordshire while I was staying with that uncle of whom I have
  already spoken, the uncle who sold my father's houses and settled my mother
  in Penge. Margaret was twenty then and I was twenty-two.</p>

  <p>It was just before the walking tour in Switzerland that opened up so much
  of the world to me. I saw her once, for an afternoon, and circumstances so
  threw her up in relief that I formed a very vivid memory of her. She was in
  the sharpest contrast with the industrial world about her; she impressed me
  as a dainty blue flower might do, come upon suddenly on a clinker heap. She
  remained in my mind at once a perplexing interrogation and a symbol...</p>

  <p>But first I must tell of my Staffordshire cousins and the world that
  served as a foil for her.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">I first went to stay with my cousins when I was an awkward
  youth of sixteen, wearing deep mourning for my mother. My uncle wanted to
  talk things over with me, he said, and if he could, to persuade me to go into
  business instead of going up to Cambridge.</p>

  <p>I remember that visit on account of all sorts of novel things, but
  chiefly, I think, because it was the first time I encountered anything that
  deserves to be spoken of as wealth. For the first time in my life I had to do
  with people who seemed to have endless supplies of money, unlimited good
  clothes, numerous servants; whose daily life was made up of things that I had
  hitherto considered to be treats or exceptional extravagances. My cousins of
  eighteen and nineteen took cabs, for instance, with the utmost freedom, and
  travelled first-class in the local trains that run up and down the district
  of the Five Towns with an entire unconsciousness of the magnificence, as it
  seemed to me, of such a proceeding.</p>

  <p>The family occupied a large villa in Newcastle, with big lawns before it
  and behind, a shrubbery with quite a lot of shrubs, a coach house and stable,
  and subordinate dwelling-places for the gardener and the coachman. Every
  bedroom contained a gas heater and a canopied brass bedstead, and had a
  little bathroom attached equipped with the porcelain baths and fittings my
  uncle manufactured, bright and sanitary and stamped with his name, and the
  house was furnished throughout with chairs and tables in bright shining wood,
  soft and prevalently red Turkish carpets, cosy corners, curtained archways,
  gold-framed landscapes, overmantels, a dining-room sideboard like a palace
  with a large Tantalus, and electric light fittings of a gay and expensive
  quality. There was a fine billiard-room on the ground floor with three
  comfortable sofas and a rotating bookcase containing an excellent collection
  of the English and American humorists from <i>Three Men in a Boat</i> to the
  penultimate Mark Twain. There was also a conservatory opening out of the
  dining-room, to which the gardener brought potted flowers in their
  season...</p>

  <p>My aunt was a little woman with a scared look and a cap that would get
  over one eye, not very like my mother, and nearly eight years her junior; she
  was very much concerned with keeping everything nice, and unmercifully
  bullied by my two cousins, who took after their father and followed the
  imaginations of their own hearts. They were tall, dark, warmly flushed girls
  handsome rather than pretty. Gertrude, the eldest and tallest, had eyes that
  were almost black; Sibyl was of a stouter build, and her eyes, of which she
  was shamelessly proud, were dark blue. Sibyl's hair waved, and Gertrude's was
  severely straight. They treated me on my first visit with all the contempt of
  the adolescent girl for a boy a little younger and infinitely less expert in
  the business of life than herself. They were very busy with the writings of
  notes and certain mysterious goings and comings of their own, and left me
  very much to my own devices. Their speech in my presence was full of
  unfathomable allusions. They were the sort of girls who will talk over and
  through an uninitiated stranger with the pleasantest sense of
  superiority.</p>

  <p>I met them at breakfast and at lunch and at the half-past six o'clock high
  tea that formed the third chief meal of the day. I heard them rattling off
  the compositions of Chaminade and Moskowski, with great decision and effect,
  and hovered on the edge of tennis foursomes where it was manifest to the
  dullest intelligence that my presence was unnecessary. Then I went off to
  find some readable book in the place, but apart from miscellaneous popular
  novels, some veterinary works, a number of comic books, old bound volumes of
  <i>The Illustrated London News</i> and a large, popular illustrated
  <i>History of England</i>, there was very little to be found. My aunt talked
  to me in a casual feeble way, chiefly about my mother's last illness. The two
  had seen very little of each other for many years; she made no secret of it
  that the ineligible qualities of my father were the cause of the
  estrangement. The only other society in the house during the day was an old
  and rather decayed Skye terrier in constant conflict with what were no doubt
  imaginary fleas. I took myself off for a series of walks, and acquired a
  considerable knowledge of the scenery and topography of the Potteries.</p>

  <p>It puzzled my aunt that I did not go westward, where it was country-side
  and often quite pretty, with hedgerows and fields and copses and flowers. But
  always I went eastward, where in a long valley industrialism smokes and
  sprawls. That was the stuff to which I turned by nature, to the human effort,
  and the accumulation and jar of men's activities. And in such a country as
  that valley social and economic relations were simple and manifest. Instead
  of the limitless confusion of London's population, in which no man can trace
  any but the most slender correlation between rich and poor, in which everyone
  seems disconnected and adrift from everyone, you can see here the works, the
  potbank or the ironworks or what not, and here close at hand the congested,
  meanly-housed workers, and at a little distance a small middle-class quarter,
  and again remoter, the big house of the employer. It was like a very
  simplified diagram&mdash;after the untraceable confusion of London.</p>

  <p>I prowled alone, curious and interested, through shabby back streets of
  mean little homes; I followed canals, sometimes canals of mysteriously heated
  waters with ghostly wisps of steam rising against blackened walls or a
  distant prospect of dustbin-fed vegetable gardens, I saw the women pouring
  out from the potbanks, heard the hooters summoning the toilers to work, lost
  my way upon slag heaps as big as the hills of the south country, dodged
  trains at manifestly dangerous level crossings, and surveyed across dark
  intervening spaces, the flaming uproar, the gnome-like activities of iron
  foundries. I heard talk of strikes and rumours of strikes, and learnt from
  the columns of some obscure labour paper I bought one day, of the horrors of
  the lead poisoning that was in those days one of the normal risks of certain
  sorts of pottery workers. Then back I came, by the ugly groaning and clanging
  steam train of that period, to my uncle's house and lavish abundance of money
  and more or less furtive flirtations and the tinkle of Moskowski and
  Chaminade. It was, I say, diagrammatic. One saw the expropriator and the
  expropriated&mdash;as if Marx had arranged the picture. It was as jumbled and
  far more dingy and disastrous than any of the confusions of building and
  development that had surrounded my youth at Bromstead and Penge, but it had a
  novel quality of being explicable. I found great virtue in the word
  "exploitation."</p>

  <p>There stuck in my mind as if it was symbolical of the whole thing the
  twisted figure of a man, whose face had been horribly scalded&mdash;I can't
  describe how, except that one eye was just expressionless white&mdash;and he
  ground at an organ bearing a card which told in weak and bitterly satirical
  phrasing that he had been scalded by the hot water from the tuyeres of the
  blast furnace of Lord Pandram's works. He had been scalded and quite
  inadequately compensated and dismissed. And Lord Pandram was worth half a
  million.</p>

  <p>That upturned sightless white eye of his took possession of my
  imagination. I don't think that even then I was swayed by any crude
  melodramatic conception of injustice. I was quite prepared to believe the
  card wasn't a punctiliously accurate statement of fact, and that a case could
  be made out for Lord Pandram. Still there in the muddy gutter, painfully and
  dreadfully, was the man, and he was smashed and scalded and wretched, and he
  ground his dismal hurdygurdy with a weary arm, calling upon Heaven and the
  passer-by for help, for help and some sort of righting&mdash;one could not
  imagine quite what. There he was as a fact, as a by-product of the system
  that heaped my cousins with trinkets and provided the comic novels and the
  abundant cigars and spacious billiard-room of my uncle's house. I couldn't
  disconnect him and them.</p>

  <p>My uncle on his part did nothing to conceal the state of war that existed
  between himself and his workers, and the mingled contempt and animosity he
  felt from them.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Prosperity had overtaken my uncle. So quite naturally he
  believed that every man who was not as prosperous as he was had only himself
  to blame. He was rich and he had left school and gone into his father's
  business at fifteen, and that seemed to him the proper age at which
  everyone's education should terminate. He was very anxious to dissuade me
  from going up to Cambridge, and we argued intermittently through all my
  visit.</p>

  <p>I had remembered him as a big and buoyant man, striding destructively
  about the nursery floor of my childhood, and saluting my existence by slaps,
  loud laughter, and questions about half herrings and half eggs subtly framed
  to puzzle and confuse my mind. I didn't see him for some years until my
  father's death, and then he seemed rather smaller, though still a fair size,
  yellow instead of red and much less radiantly aggressive. This altered effect
  was due not so much to my own changed perspectives, I fancy, as to the facts
  that he was suffering for continuous cigar smoking, and being taken in hand
  by his adolescent daughters who had just returned from school.</p>

  <p>During my first visit there was a perpetual series of&mdash;the only word
  is rows, between them and him. Up to the age of fifteen or thereabouts, he
  had maintained his ascendancy over them by simple old-fashioned physical
  chastisement. Then after an interlude of a year it had dawned upon them that
  power had mysteriously departed from him. He had tried stopping their pocket
  money, but they found their mother financially amenable; besides which it was
  fundamental to my uncle's attitude that he should give them money freely. Not
  to do so would seem like admitting a difficulty in making it. So that after
  he had stopped their allowances for the fourth time Sybil and Gertrude were
  prepared to face beggary without a qualm. It had been his pride to give them
  the largest allowance of any girls at the school, not even excepting the
  granddaughter of Fladden the Borax King, and his soul recoiled from this
  discipline as it had never recoiled from the ruder method of the earlier
  phase. Both girls had developed to a high pitch in their mutual
  recriminations a gift for damaging retort, and he found it an altogether
  deadlier thing than the power of the raised voice that had always cowed my
  aunt. Whenever he became heated with them, they frowned as if involuntarily,
  drew in their breath sharply, said: "Daddy, you really must not say&mdash;"
  and corrected his pronunciation. Then, at a great advantage, they resumed the
  discussion...</p>

  <p>My uncle's views about Cambridge, however, were perfectly clear and
  definite. It was waste of time and money. It was all damned foolery. Did they
  make a man a better business man? Not a bit of it. He gave instances. It
  spoilt a man for business by giving him "false ideas." Some men said that at
  college a man formed useful friendships. What use were friendships to a
  business man? He might get to know lords, but, as my uncle pointed out, a
  lord's requirements in his line of faience were little greater than a common
  man's. If college introduced him to hotel proprietors there might be
  something in it. Perhaps it helped a man into Parliament, Parliament still
  being a confused retrogressive corner in the world where lawyers and suchlike
  sheltered themselves from the onslaughts of common-sense behind a fog of
  Latin and Greek and twaddle and tosh; but I wasn't the sort to go into
  Parliament, unless I meant to be a lawyer. Did I mean to be a lawyer? It cost
  no end of money, and was full of uncertainties, and there were no judges nor
  great solicitors among my relations. "Young chaps think they get on by
  themselves," said my uncle. "It isn't so. Not unless they take their coats
  off. I took mine off before I was your age by nigh a year."</p>

  <p>We were at cross purposes from the outset, because I did not think men
  lived to make money; and I was obtuse to the hints he was throwing out at the
  possibilities of his own potbank, not willfully obtuse, but just failing to
  penetrate his meaning. Whatever City Merchants had or had not done for me,
  Flack, Topham and old Gates had certainly barred my mistaking the profitable
  production and sale of lavatory basins and bathroom fittings for the highest
  good. It was only upon reflection that it dawned upon me that the splendid
  chance for a young fellow with my uncle, "me, having no son of my own," was
  anything but an illustration for comparison with my own chosen career.</p>

  <p>I still remember very distinctly my uncle's talk,&mdash;he loved to speak
  "reet Staffordshire"&mdash;his rather flabby face with the mottled complexion
  that told of crude ill-regulated appetites, his clumsy gestures&mdash;he kept
  emphasising his points by prodding at me with his finger&mdash;the ill-worn,
  costly, grey tweed clothes, the watch chain of plain solid gold, and soft
  felt hat thrust back from his head. He tackled me first in the garden after
  lunch, and then tried to raise me to enthusiasm by taking me to his potbank
  and showing me its organisation, from the dusty grinding mills in which
  whitened men worked and coughed, through the highly ventilated glazing room
  in which strangely masked girls looked ashamed of themselves,&mdash;"They'll
  risk death, the fools, to show their faces to a man," said my uncle, quite
  audibly&mdash;to the firing kilns and the glazing kilns, and so round the
  whole place to the railway siding and the gratifying spectacle of three
  trucks laden with executed orders.</p>

  <p>Then we went up a creaking outside staircase to his little office, and he
  showed off before me for a while, with one or two subordinates and the
  telephone.</p>

  <p>"None of your Gas," he said, "all this. It's Real every bit of it. Hard
  cash and hard glaze."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, with memories of a carelessly read pamphlet in my mind, and
  without any satirical intention, "I suppose you <i>must</i> use lead in your
  glazes?"</p>

  <p>Whereupon I found I had tapped the ruling grievance of my uncle's life. He
  hated leadless glazes more than he hated anything, except the benevolent
  people who had organised the agitation for their use. "Leadless glazes ain't
  only fit for buns," he said. "Let me tell you, my boy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He began in a voice of bland persuasiveness that presently warmed to
  anger, to explain the whole matter. I hadn't the rights of the matter at all.
  Firstly, there was practically no such thing as lead poisoning. Secondly, not
  everyone was liable to lead poisoning, and it would be quite easy to pick out
  the susceptible types&mdash;as soon as they had it&mdash;and put them to
  other work. Thirdly, the evil effects of lead poisoning were much
  exaggerated. Fourthly, and this was in a particularly confidential undertone,
  many of the people liked to get lead poisoning, especially the women, because
  it caused abortion. I might not believe it, but he knew it for a fact.
  Fifthly, the work-people simply would not learn the gravity of the danger,
  and would eat with unwashed hands, and incur all sorts of risks, so that as
  my uncle put it: "the fools deserve what they get." Sixthly, he and several
  associated firms had organised a simple and generous insurance scheme against
  lead-poisoning risks. Seventhly, he never wearied in rational (as
  distinguished from excessive, futile and expensive) precautions against the
  disease. Eighthly, in the ill-equipped shops of his minor competitors lead
  poisoning was a frequent and virulent evil, and people had generalised from
  these exceptional cases. The small shops, he hazarded, looking out of the
  cracked and dirty window at distant chimneys, might be advantageously
  closed...</p>

  <p>"But what's the good of talking?" said my uncle, getting off the table on
  which he had been sitting. "Seems to me there'll come a time when a master
  will get fined if he don't run round the works blowing his girls noses for
  them. That's about what it'll come to."</p>

  <p>He walked to the black mantelpiece and stood on the threadbare rug, and
  urged me not to be misled by the stories of prejudiced and interested enemies
  of our national industries.</p>

  <p>"They'll get a strike one of these days, of employers, and then we'll see
  a bit," he said. "They'll drive Capital abroad and then they'll whistle to
  get it back again."...</p>

  <p>He led the way down the shaky wooden steps and cheered up to tell me of
  his way of checking his coal consumption. He exchanged a ferocious greeting
  with one or two workpeople, and so we came out of the factory gates into the
  ugly narrow streets, paved with a peculiarly hard diapered brick of an
  unpleasing inky-blue colour, and bordered with the mean and squalid homes of
  his workers. Doors stood open and showed grimy interiors, and dirty ill-clad
  children played in the kennel.</p>

  <p>We passed a sickly-looking girl with a sallow face, who dragged her limbs
  and peered at us dimly with painful eyes. She stood back, as partly blinded
  people will do, to allow us to pass, although there was plenty of room for
  us.</p>

  <p>I glanced back at her.</p>

  <p>"<i>That's</i> ploombism," said my uncle casually.</p>

  <p>"What?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Ploombism. And the other day I saw a fool of a girl, and what d'you
  think? She'd got a basin that hadn't been fired, a cracked piece of biscuit
  it was, up on the shelf over her head, just all over glaze, killing glaze,
  man, and she was putting up her hand if you please, and eating her dinner out
  of it. Got her dinner in it!</p>

  <p>"Eating her dinner out of it," he repeated in loud and bitter tones, and
  punched me hard in the ribs.</p>

  <p>"And then they comes to <i>that</i>&mdash;and grumbles. And the fools up
  in Westminster want you to put in fans here and fans there&mdash;the Longton
  fools have... And then eating their dinners out of it all the time!"...</p>

  <p>At high tea that night&mdash;my uncle was still holding out against
  evening dinner&mdash;Sibyl and Gertrude made what was evidently a concerted
  demand for a motor-car.</p>

  <p>"You've got your mother's brougham," he said, "that's good enough for
  you." But he seemed shaken by the fact that some Burslem rival was launching
  out with the new invention. "He spoils his girls," he remarked. "He's a
  fool," and became thoughtful.</p>

  <p>Afterwards he asked me to come to him into his study; it was a room with a
  writing-desk and full of pieces of earthenware and suchlike litter, and we
  had our great row about Cambridge.</p>

  <p>"Have you thought things over, Dick?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll go to Trinity, Uncle," I said firmly. "I want to go to
  Trinity. It is a great college."</p>

  <p>He was manifestly chagrined. "You're a fool," he said.</p>

  <p>I made no answer.</p>

  <p>"You're a damned fool," he said. "But I suppose you've got to do it. You
  could have come here&mdash;That don't matter, though, now... You'll have your
  time and spend your money, and be a poor half-starved clergyman, mucking
  about with the women all the day and afraid to have one of your own ever, or
  you'll be a schoolmaster or some such fool for the rest of your life. Or some
  newspaper chap. That's what you'll get from Cambridge. I'm half a mind not to
  let you. Eh? More than half a mind..."</p>

  <p>"You've got to do the thing you can," he said, after a pause, "and likely
  it's what you're fitted for."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">I paid several short visits to Staffordshire during my
  Cambridge days, and always these relations of mine produced the same effect
  of hardness. My uncle's thoughts had neither atmosphere nor mystery. He lived
  in a different universe from the dreams of scientific construction that
  filled my mind. He could as easily have understood Chinese poetry. His
  motives were made up of intense rivalries with other men of his class and
  kind, a few vindictive hates springing from real and fancied slights, a habit
  of acquisition that had become a second nature, a keen love both of
  efficiency and display in his own affairs. He seemed to me to have no sense
  of the state, no sense and much less any love of beauty, no charity and no
  sort of religious feeling whatever. He had strong bodily appetites, he ate
  and drank freely, smoked a great deal, and occasionally was carried off by
  his passions for a "bit of a spree" to Birmingham or Liverpool or Manchester.
  The indulgences of these occasions were usually followed by a period of
  reaction, when he was urgent for the suppression of nudity in the local Art
  Gallery and a harsh and forcible elevation of the superficial morals of the
  valley. And he spoke of the ladies who ministered to the delights of his
  jolly-dog period, when he spoke of them at all, by the unprintable feminine
  equivalent. My aunt he treated with a kindly contempt and considerable
  financial generosity, but his daughters tore his heart; he was so proud of
  them, so glad to find them money to spend, so resolved to own them, so
  instinctively jealous of every man who came near them.</p>

  <p>My uncle has been the clue to a great number of men for me. He was an
  illuminating extreme. I have learnt what not to expect from them through him,
  and to comprehend resentments and dangerous sudden antagonisms I should have
  found incomprehensible in their more complex forms, if I had not first seen
  them in him in their feral state.</p>

  <p>With his soft felt hat at the back of his head, his rather heavy, rather
  mottled face, his rationally thick boots and slouching tweed-clad form, a
  little round-shouldered and very obstinate looking, he strolls through all my
  speculations sucking his teeth audibly, and occasionally throwing out a
  shrewd aphorism, the intractable unavoidable ore of the new civilisation.</p>

  <p>Essentially he was simple. Generally speaking, he hated and despised in
  equal measure whatever seemed to suggest that he personally was not the most
  perfect human being conceivable. He hated all education after fifteen because
  he had had no education after fifteen, he hated all people who did not have
  high tea until he himself under duress gave up high tea, he hated every game
  except football, which he had played and could judge, he hated all people who
  spoke foreign languages because he knew no language but Staffordshire, he
  hated all foreigners because he was English, and all foreign ways because
  they were not his ways. Also he hated particularly, and in this order,
  Londoner's, Yorkshiremen, Scotch, Welch and Irish, because they were not
  "reet Staffordshire," and he hated all other Staffordshire men as
  insufficiently "reet." He wanted to have all his own women inviolate, and to
  fancy he had a call upon every other woman in the world. He wanted to have
  the best cigars and the best brandy in the world to consume or give away
  magnificently, and every one else to have inferior ones. (His billiard table
  was an extra large size, specially made and very inconvenient.) And he hated
  Trade Unions because they interfered with his autocratic direction of his
  works, and his workpeople because they were not obedient and untiring
  mechanisms to do his bidding. He was, in fact, a very naive, vigorous human
  being. He was about as much civilised, about as much tamed to the ideas of
  collective action and mutual consideration as a Central African negro.</p>

  <p>There are hordes of such men as he throughout all the modern industrial
  world. You will find the same type with the slightest modifications in the
  Pas de Calais or Rhenish Prussia or New Jersey or North Italy. No doubt you
  would find it in New Japan. These men have raised themselves up from the
  general mass of untrained, uncultured, poorish people in a hard industrious
  selfish struggle. To drive others they have had first to drive themselves.
  They have never yet had occasion nor leisure to think of the state or social
  life as a whole, and as for dreams or beauty, it was a condition of survival
  that they should ignore such cravings. All the distinctive qualities of my
  uncle can be thought of as dictated by his conditions; his success and
  harshness, the extravagances that expressed his pride in making money, the
  uncongenial luxury that sprang from rivalry, and his self-reliance, his
  contempt for broad views, his contempt for everything that he could not
  understand.</p>

  <p>His daughters were the inevitable children of his life. Queer girls they
  were! Curiously "spirited" as people phrase it, and curiously limited. During
  my Cambridge days I went down to Staffordshire several times. My uncle,
  though he still resented my refusal to go into his business, was also in his
  odd way proud of me. I was his nephew and poor relation, and yet there I was,
  a young gentleman learning all sorts of unremunerative things in the grandest
  manner, "Latin and mook," while the sons of his neighhours, not nephews
  merely, but sons, stayed unpolished in their native town. Every time I went
  down I found extensive changes and altered relations, and before I had
  settled down to them off I went again. I don't think I was one person to
  them; I was a series of visitors. There is a gulf of ages between a gaunt
  schoolboy of sixteen in unbecoming mourning and two vividly self-conscious
  girls of eighteen and nineteen, but a Cambridge "man" of two and twenty with
  a first and good tennis and a growing social experience, is a fair
  contemporary for two girls of twenty-three and twenty-four.</p>

  <p>A motor-car appeared, I think in my second visit, a bottle-green affair
  that opened behind, had dark purple cushions, and was controlled mysteriously
  by a man in shiny black costume and a flat cap. The high tea had been shifted
  to seven and rechristened dinner, but my uncle would not dress nor consent to
  have wine; and after one painful experiment, I gathered, and a scene, he put
  his foot down and prohibited any but high-necked dresses.</p>

  <p>"Daddy's perfectly impossible," Sybil told me.</p>

  <p>The foot had descended vehemently! "My own daughters!" he had said,
  "dressed up like&mdash;"&mdash;and had arrested himself and fumbled and
  decided to say&mdash;"actresses, and showin' their fat arms for every fool to
  stare at!" Nor would he have any people invited to dinner. He didn't, he had
  explained, want strangers poking about in his house when he came home tired.
  So such calling as occurred went on during his absence in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>One of the peculiarities of the life of these ascendant families of the
  industrial class to which wealth has come, is its tremendous insulations.
  There were no customs of intercourse in the Five Towns. All the isolated
  prosperities of the district sprang from economising, hard driven homes, in
  which there was neither time nor means for hospitality. Social intercourse
  centred very largely upon the church or chapel, and the chapels were better
  at bringing people together than the Establishment to which my cousins
  belonged. Their chief outlet to the wider world lay therefore through the
  acquaintances they had formed at school, and through two much less prosperous
  families of relations who lived at Longton and Hanley. A number of gossiping
  friendships with old school mates were "kept up," and my cousins would "spend
  the afternoon" or even spend the day with these; such occasions led to other
  encounters and interlaced with the furtive correspondences and snatched
  meetings that formed the emotional thread of their lives. When the billiard
  table had been new, my uncle had taken to asking in a few approved friends
  for an occasional game, but mostly the billiard-room was for glory and the
  girls. Both of them played very well. They never, so far as I know, dined
  out, and when at last after bitter domestic conflicts they began to go to
  dances, they went with the quavering connivance of my aunt, and changed into
  ball frocks at friends' houses on the way. There was a tennis club that
  formed a convenient afternoon rendezvous, and I recall that in the period of
  my earlier visits the young bloods of the district found much satisfaction in
  taking girls for drives in dog-carts and suchlike high-wheeled vehicles, a
  disposition that died in tangled tandems at the apparition of
  motor-car's.</p>

  <p>My aunt and uncle had conceived no plans in life for their daughters at
  all. In the undifferentiated industrial community from which they had sprung,
  girls got married somehow, and it did not occur to them that the
  concentration of property that had made them wealthy, had cut their children
  off from the general social sea in which their own awkward meeting had
  occurred, without necessarily opening any other world in exchange. My uncle
  was too much occupied with the works and his business affairs and his private
  vices to philosophise about his girls; he wanted them just to keep girls,
  preferably about sixteen, and to be a sort of animated flowers and make home
  bright and be given things. He was irritated that they would not remain at
  this, and still more irritated that they failed to suppress altogether their
  natural interest in young men. The tandems would be steered by weird and
  devious routes to evade the bare chance of his bloodshot eye. My aunt seemed
  to have no ideas whatever about what was likely to happen to her children.
  She had indeed no ideas about anything; she took her husband and the days as
  they came.</p>

  <p>I can see now the pathetic difficulty of my cousins' position in life; the
  absence of any guidance or instruction or provision for their development.
  They supplemented the silences of home by the conversation of schoolfellows
  and the suggestions of popular fiction. They had to make what they could out
  of life with such hints as these. The church was far too modest to offer them
  any advice. It was obtruded upon my mind upon my first visit that they were
  both carrying on correspondences and having little furtive passings and
  seeings and meetings with the mysterious owners of certain initials, S. and
  L. K., and, if I remember rightly, "the R. N." brothers and cousins, I
  suppose, of their friends. The same thing was going on, with a certain
  intensification, at my next visit, excepting only that the initials were
  different. But when I came again their methods were maturer or I was no
  longer a negligible quantity, and the notes and the initials were no longer
  flaunted quite so openly in my face.</p>

  <p>My cousins had worked it out from the indications of their universe that
  the end of life is to have a "good time." They used the phrase. That and the
  drives in dog-carts were only the first of endless points of resemblance
  between them and the commoner sort of American girl. When some years ago I
  paid my first and only visit to America I seemed to recover my cousins'
  atmosphere as soon as I entered the train at Euston. There were three girls
  in my compartment supplied with huge decorated cases of sweets, and being
  seen off by a company of friends, noisily arch and eager about the "steamer
  letters" they would get at Liverpool; they were the very soul-sisters of my
  cousins. The chief elements of a good time, as my cousins judged it, as these
  countless thousands of rich young women judge it, are a petty eventfulness,
  laughter, and to feel that you are looking well and attracting attention.
  Shopping is one of its leading joys. You buy things, clothes and trinkets for
  yourself and presents for your friends. Presents always seemed to be flying
  about in that circle; flowers and boxes of sweets were common currency. My
  cousins were always getting and giving, my uncle caressed them with parcels
  and cheques. They kissed him and he exuded sovereigns as a stroked
  <i>aphis</i> exudes honey. It was like the new language of the Academy of
  Lagado to me, and I never learnt how to express myself in it, for nature and
  training make me feel encumbered to receive presents and embarrassed in
  giving them. But then, like my father, I hate and distrust possessions.</p>

  <p>Of the quality of their private imagination I never learnt anything; I
  suppose it followed the lines of the fiction they read and was romantic and
  sentimental. So far as marriage went, the married state seemed at once very
  attractive and dreadfully serious to them, composed in equal measure of
  becoming important and becoming old. I don't know what they thought about
  children. I doubt if they thought about them at all. It was very secret if
  they did.</p>

  <p>As for the poor and dingy people all about them, my cousins were always
  ready to take part in a Charitable Bazaar. They were unaware of any economic
  correlation of their own prosperity and that circumambient poverty, and they
  knew of Trade Unions simply as disagreeable external things that upset my
  uncle's temper. They knew of nothing wrong in social life at all except that
  there were "Agitators." It surprised them a little, I think, that Agitators
  were not more drastically put down. But they had a sort of instinctive dread
  of social discussion as of something that might breach the happiness of their
  ignorance...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">My cousins did more than illustrate Marx for me; they also
  undertook a stage of my emotional education. Their method in that as in
  everything else was extremely simple, but it took my inexperience by
  surprise.</p>

  <p>It must have been on my third visit that Sybil took me in hand. Hitherto I
  seemed to have seen her only in profile, but now she became almost completely
  full face, manifestly regarded me with those violet eyes of hers. She passed
  me things I needed at breakfast&mdash;it was the first morning of my visit
  &mdash;before I asked for them.</p>

  <p>When young men are looked at by pretty cousins, they become intensely
  aware of those cousins. It seemed to me that I had always admired Sybil's
  eyes very greatly, and that there was something in her temperament congenial
  to mine. It was odd I had not noted it on my previous visits.</p>

  <p>We walked round the garden somewhen that morning, and talked about
  Cambridge. She asked quite a lot of questions about my work and my ambitions.
  She said she had always felt sure I was clever.</p>

  <p>The conversation languished a little, and we picked some flowers for the
  house. Then she asked if I could run. I conceded her various starts and we
  raced up and down the middle garden path. Then, a little breathless, we went
  into the new twenty-five guinea summer-house at the end of the herbaceous
  border.</p>

  <p>We sat side by side, pleasantly hidden from the house, and she became
  anxious about her hair, which was slightly and prettily disarranged, and
  asked me to help her with the adjustment of a hairpin. I had never in my life
  been so near the soft curly hair and the dainty eyebrow and eyelid and warm
  soft cheek of a girl, and I was stirred&mdash;</p>

  <p>It stirs me now to recall it.</p>

  <p>I became a battleground of impulses and inhibitions.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said my cousin, and moved a little away from me.</p>

  <p>She began to talk about friendship, and lost her thread and forgot the
  little electric stress between us in a rather meandering analysis of her
  principal girl friends.</p>

  <p>But afterwards she resumed her purpose.</p>

  <p>I went to bed that night with one proposition overshadowing everything
  else in my mind, namely, that kissing my cousin Sybil was a difficult, but
  not impossible, achievement. I do not recall any shadow of a doubt whether on
  the whole it was worth doing. The thing had come into my existence,
  disturbing and interrupting its flow exactly as a fever does. Sybil had
  infected me with herself.</p>

  <p>The next day matters came to a crisis in the little upstairs sitting-room
  which had been assigned me as a study during my visit. I was working up
  there, or rather trying to work in spite of the outrageous capering of some
  very primitive elements in my brain, when she came up to me, under a
  transparent pretext of looking for a book.</p>

  <p>I turned round and then got up at the sight of her. I quite forget what
  our conversation was about, but I know she led me to believe I might kiss
  her. Then when I attempted to do so she averted her face.</p>

  <p>"How <i>could</i> you?" she said; "I didn't mean that!"</p>

  <p>That remained the state of our relations for two days. I developed a
  growing irritation with and resentment against cousin Sybil, combined with an
  intense desire to get that kiss for which I hungered and thirsted. Cousin
  Sybil went about in the happy persuasion that I was madly in love with her,
  and her game, so far as she was concerned, was played and won. It wasn't
  until I had fretted for two days that I realised that I was being used for
  the commonest form of excitement possible to a commonplace girl; that dozens
  perhaps of young men had played the part of Tantalus at cousin Sybil's lips.
  I walked about my room at nights, damning her and calling her by terms which
  on the whole she rather deserved, while Sybil went to sleep pitying "poor old
  Dick!"</p>

  <p>"Damn it!" I said, "I <i>will</i> be equal with you."</p>

  <p>But I never did equalise the disadvantage, and perhaps it's as well, for I
  fancy that sort of revenge cuts both people too much for a rational man to
  seek it...</p>

  <p>"Why are men so silly?" said cousin Sybil next morning, wriggling back
  with down-bent head to release herself from what should have been a
  compelling embrace.</p>

  <p>"Confound it!" I said with a flash of clear vision. "You <i>started</i>
  this game."</p>

  <p>"Oh!"</p>

  <p>She stood back against a hedge of roses, a little flushed and excited and
  interested, and ready for the delightful defensive if I should renew my
  attack.</p>

  <p>"Beastly hot for scuffling," I said, white with anger. "I don't know
  whether I'm so keen on kissing you, Sybil, after all. I just thought you
  wanted me to."</p>

  <p>I could have whipped her, and my voice stung more than my words.</p>

  <p>Our eyes met; a real hatred in hers leaping up to meet mine.</p>

  <p>"Let's play tennis," I said, after a moment's pause.</p>

  <p>"No," she answered shortly, "I'm going indoors."</p>

  <p>"Very well."</p>

  <p>And that ended the affair with Sybil.</p>

  <p>I was still in the full glare of this disillusionment when Gertrude awoke
  from some preoccupation to an interest in my existence. She developed a
  disposition to touch my hand by accident, and let her fingers rest in contact
  with it for a moment,&mdash;she had pleasant soft hands;&mdash;she began to
  drift into summer houses with me, to let her arm rest trustfully against
  mine, to ask questions about Cambridge. They were much the same questions
  that Sybil had asked. But I controlled myself and maintained a profile of
  intelligent and entirely civil indifference to her blandishments.</p>

  <p>What Gertrude made of it came out one evening in some talk&mdash;I forget
  about what&mdash;with Sybil.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dick!" said Gertrude a little impatiently, "Dick's Pi."</p>

  <p>And I never disillusioned her by any subsequent levity from this theory of
  my innate and virginal piety.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">It was against this harsh and crude Staffordshire background
  that I think I must have seen Margaret for the first time. I say I think
  because it is quite possible that we had passed each other in the streets of
  Cambridge, no doubt with that affectation of mutual disregard which was once
  customary between undergraduates and Newnham girls. But if that was so I had
  noted nothing of the slender graciousness that shone out so pleasingly
  against the bleaker midland surroundings.</p>

  <p>She was a younger schoolfellow of my cousins', and the step-daughter of
  Seddon, a prominent solicitor of Burslem. She was not only not in my cousins'
  generation but not in their set, she was one of a small hardworking group who
  kept immaculate note-books, and did as much as is humanly possible of that
  insensate pile of written work that the Girls' Public School movement has
  inflicted upon school-girls. She really learnt French and German admirably
  and thoroughly, she got as far in mathematics as an unflinching industry can
  carry any one with no great natural aptitude, and she went up to Bennett
  Hall, Newnham, after the usual conflict with her family, to work for the
  History Tripos.</p>

  <p>There in her third year she made herself thoroughly ill through overwork,
  so ill that she had to give up Newnham altogether and go abroad with her
  stepmother. She made herself ill, as so many girls do in those university
  colleges, through the badness of her home and school training. She thought
  study must needs be a hard straining of the mind. She worried her work, she
  gave herself no leisure to see it as a whole, she felt herself not making
  headway and she cut her games and exercise in order to increase her hours of
  toil, and worked into the night. She carried a knack of laborious
  thoroughness into the blind alleys and inessentials of her subject. It didn't
  need the badness of the food for which Bennett Hall is celebrated and the
  remarkable dietary of nocturnal cocoa, cakes and soft biscuits with which the
  girls have supplemented it, to ensure her collapse. Her mother brought her
  home, fretting and distressed, and then finding her hopelessly unhappy at
  home, took her and her half-brother, a rather ailing youngster of ten who
  died three years later, for a journey to Italy.</p>

  <p>Italy did much to assuage Margaret's chagrin. I think all three of them
  had a very good time there. At home Mr. Seddon, her step-father, played the
  part of a well-meaning blight by reason of the moods that arose from nervous
  dyspepsia. They went to Florence, equipped with various introductions and
  much sound advice from sympathetic Cambridge friends, and having acquired an
  ease in Italy there, went on to Siena, Orvieto, and at last Rome. They
  returned, if I remember rightly, by Pisa, Genoa, Milan and Paris. Six months
  or more they had had abroad, and now Margaret was back in Burslem, in health
  again and consciously a very civilised person.</p>

  <p>New ideas were abroad, it was Maytime and a spring of abundant flowers
  &mdash;daffodils were particularly good that year&mdash;and Mrs. Seddon
  celebrated her return by giving an afternoon reception at short notice, with
  the clear intention of letting every one out into the garden if the weather
  held.</p>

  <p>The Seddons had a big old farmhouse modified to modern ideas of comfort on
  the road out towards Misterton, with an orchard that had been rather
  pleasantly subdued from use to ornament. It had rich blossoming cherry and
  apple trees. Large patches of grass full of nodding yellow trumpets had been
  left amidst the not too precisely mown grass, which was as it were grass path
  with an occasional lapse into lawn or glade. And Margaret, hatless, with the
  fair hair above her thin, delicately pink face very simply done, came to meet
  our rather too consciously dressed party,&mdash;we had come in the motor four
  strong, with my aunt in grey silk. Margaret wore a soft flowing flowered blue
  dress of diaphanous material, all unconnected with the fashion and tied with
  pretty ribbons, like a slenderer, unbountiful Primavera.</p>

  <p>It was one of those May days that ape the light and heat of summer, and I
  remember disconnectedly quite a number of brightly lit figures and groups
  walking about, and a white gate between orchard and garden and a large lawn
  with an oak tree and a red Georgian house with a verandah and open French
  windows, through which the tea drinking had come out upon the moss-edged
  flagstones even as Mrs. Seddon had planned.</p>

  <p>The party was almost entirely feminine except for a little curate with a
  large head, a good voice and a radiant manner, who was obviously attracted by
  Margaret, and two or three young husbands still sufficiently addicted to
  their wives to accompany them. One of them I recall as a quite romantic
  figure with abundant blond curly hair on which was poised a grey felt hat
  encircled by a refined black band. He wore, moreover, a loose rich shot silk
  tie of red and purple, a long frock coat, grey trousers and brown shoes, and
  presently he removed his hat and carried it in one hand. There were two
  tennis-playing youths besides myself. There was also one father with three
  daughters in anxious control, a father of the old school scarcely half broken
  in, reluctant, rebellious and consciously and conscientiously "reet
  Staffordshire." The daughters were all alert to suppress the possible
  plungings, the undesirable humorous impulses of this almost feral guest. They
  nipped his very gestures in the bud. The rest of the people were mainly
  mothers with daughters&mdash;daughters of all ages, and a scattering of
  aunts, and there was a tendency to clotting, parties kept together and
  regarded parties suspiciously. Mr. Seddon was in hiding, I think, all the
  time, though not formally absent.</p>

  <p>Matters centred upon the tea in the long room of the French windows, where
  four trim maids went to and fro busily between the house and the clumps of
  people seated or standing before it; and tennis and croquet were
  intermittently visible and audible beyond a bank of rockwork rich with the
  spikes and cups and bells of high spring.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Seddon presided at the tea urn, and Margaret partly assisted and
  partly talked to me and my cousin Sibyl&mdash;Gertrude had found a disused
  and faded initial and was partnering him at tennis in a state of gentle
  revival&mdash;while their mother exercised a divided chaperonage from a seat
  near Mrs. Seddon. The little curate, stirring a partially empty cup of tea,
  mingled with our party, and preluded, I remember, every observation he made
  by a vigorous resumption of stirring.</p>

  <p>We talked of Cambridge, and Margaret kept us to it. The curate was a
  Selwyn man and had taken a pass degree in theology, but Margaret had come to
  Gaylord's lecturers in Trinity for a term before her breakdown, and
  understood these differences. She had the eagerness of an exile to hear the
  old familiar names of places and personalities. We capped familiar anecdotes
  and were enthusiastic about Kings' Chapel and the Backs, and the curate,
  addressing himself more particularly to Sibyl, told a long confused story
  illustrative of his disposition to reckless devilry (of a pure-minded kindly
  sort) about upsetting two canoes quite needlessly on the way to
  Grantchester.</p>

  <p>I can still see Margaret as I saw her that afternoon, see her fresh fair
  face, with the little obliquity of the upper lip, and her brow always
  slightly knitted, and her manner as of one breathlessly shy but determined.
  She had rather open blue eyes, and she spoke in an even musical voice with
  the gentlest of stresses and the ghost of a lisp. And it was true, she
  gathered, that Cambridge still existed. "I went to Grantchester," she said,
  "last year, and had tea under the apple-blossom. I didn't think then I should
  have to come down." (It was that started the curate upon his anecdote.)</p>

  <p>"I've seen a lot of pictures, and learnt a lot about them&mdash;at the
  Pitti and the Brera,&mdash;the Brera is wonderful&mdash;wonderful places,
  &mdash;but it isn't like real study," she was saying presently... "We bought
  bales of photographs," she said.</p>

  <p>I thought the bales a little out of keeping.</p>

  <p>But fair-haired and quite simply and yet graciously and fancifully
  dressed, talking of art and beautiful things and a beautiful land, and with
  so much manifest regret for learning denied, she seemed a different kind of
  being altogether from my smart, hard, high-coloured, black-haired and
  resolutely hatted cousin; she seemed translucent beside Gertrude. Even the
  little twist and droop of her slender body was a grace to me.</p>

  <p>I liked her from the moment I saw her, and set myself to interest and
  please her as well as I knew how.</p>

  <p>We recalled a case of ragging that had rustled the shrubs of Newnham, and
  then Chris Robinson's visit&mdash;he had given a talk to Bennett Hall also
  &mdash;and our impression of him.</p>

  <p>"He disappointed me, too," said Margaret.</p>

  <p>I was moved to tell Margaret something of my own views in the matter of
  social progress, and she listened&mdash;oh! with a kind of urged attention,
  and her brow a little more knitted, very earnestly. The little curate
  desisted from the appendices and refuse heaps and general debris of his
  story, and made himself look very alert and intelligent.</p>

  <p>"We did a lot of that when I was up in the eighties," he said. "I'm glad
  Imperialism hasn't swamped you fellows altogether."</p>

  <p>Gertrude, looking bright and confident, came to join our talk from the
  shrubbery; the initial, a little flushed and evidently in a state of
  refreshed relationship, came with her, and a cheerful lady in pink and more
  particularly distinguished by a pink bonnet joined our little group. Gertrude
  had been sipping admiration and was not disposed to play a passive part in
  the talk.</p>

  <p>"Socialism!" she cried, catching the word. "It's well Pa isn't here. He
  has Fits when people talk of socialism. Fits!"</p>

  <p>The initial laughed in a general kind of way.</p>

  <p>The curate said there was socialism <i>and</i> socialism, and looked at
  Margaret to gauge whether he had been too bold in this utterance. But she was
  all, he perceived, for broad-mindness, and he stirred himself (and
  incidentally his tea) to still more liberality of expression. He said the
  state of the poor was appalling, simply appalling; that there were times when
  he wanted to shatter the whole system, "only," he said, turning to me
  appealingly, "What have we got to put in its place?"</p>

  <p>"The thing that exists is always the more evident alternative," I
  said.</p>

  <p>The little curate looked at it for a moment. "Precisely," he said
  explosively, and turned stirring and with his head a little on one side, to
  hear what Margaret was saying.</p>

  <p>Margaret was saying, with a swift blush and an effect of daring, that she
  had no doubt she was a socialist.</p>

  <p>"And wearing a gold chain!" said Gertrude, "And drinking out of eggshell!
  I like that!"</p>

  <p>I came to Margaret's rescue. "It doesn't follow that because one's a
  socialist one ought to dress in sackcloth and ashes."</p>

  <p>The initial coloured deeply, and having secured my attention by prodding
  me slightly with the wrist of the hand that held his teacup, cleared his
  throat and suggested that "one ought to be consistent."</p>

  <p>I perceived we were embarked upon a discussion of the elements. We began
  an interesting little wrangle one of those crude discussions of general ideas
  that are dear to the heart of youth. I and Margaret supported one another as
  socialists, Gertrude and Sybil and the initial maintained an anti-socialist
  position, the curate attempted a cross-bench position with an air of
  intending to come down upon us presently with a casting vote. He reminded us
  of a number of useful principles too often overlooked in argument, that in a
  big question like this there was much to be said on both sides, that if every
  one did his or her duty to every one about them there would be no difficulty
  with social problems at all, that over and above all enactments we needed
  moral changes in people themselves. My cousin Gertrude was a difficult
  controversialist to manage, being unconscious of inconsistency in statement
  and absolutely impervious to reply. Her standpoint was essentially
  materialistic; she didn't see why she shouldn't have a good time because
  other people didn't; they would have a good time, she was sure, if she
  didn't. She said that if we did give up everything we had to other people,
  they wouldn't very likely know what to do with it. She asked if we were so
  fond of work-people, why we didn't go and live among them, and expressed the
  inflexible persuasion that if we HAD socialism, everything would be just the
  same again in ten years' time. She also threw upon us the imputation of
  ingratitude for a beautiful world by saying that so far as she was concerned
  she didn't want to upset everything. She was contented with things as they
  were, thank you.</p>

  <p>The discussion led in some way that I don't in the least recall now, and
  possibly by abrupt transitions, to a croquet foursome in which Margaret
  involved the curate without involving herself, and then stood beside me on
  the edge of the lawn while the others played. We watched silently for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"I <i>hate</i> that sort of view," she said suddenly in a confidential
  undertone, with her delicate pink flush returning.</p>

  <p>"It's want of imagination," I said.</p>

  <p>"To think we are just to enjoy ourselves," she went on; "just to go on
  dressing and playing and having meals and spending money!" She seemed to be
  referring not simply to my cousins, but to the whole world of industry and
  property about us. "But what is one to do?" she asked. "I do wish I had not
  had to come down. It's all so pointless here. There seems to be nothing going
  forward, no ideas, no dreams. No one here seems to feel quite what I feel,
  the sort of need there is for MEANING in things. I hate things without
  meaning."</p>

  <p>"Don't you do&mdash;local work?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I shall. I suppose I must find something. Do you think&mdash;if
  one were to attempt some sort of propaganda?"</p>

  <p>"Could you&mdash;?" I began a little doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I couldn't," she answered, after a thoughtful moment. "I
  suppose it would come to nothing. And yet I feel there is so much to be done
  for the world, so much one ought to be doing... I want to do something for
  the world."</p>

  <p>I can see her now as she stood there with her brows nearly frowning, her
  blue eyes looking before her, her mouth almost petulant. "One feels that
  there are so many things going on&mdash;out of one's reach," she said.</p>

  <p>I went back in the motor-car with my mind full of her, the quality of
  delicate discontent, the suggestion of exile. Even a kind of weakness in her
  was sympathetic. She told tremendously against her background. She was, I
  say, like a protesting blue flower upon a cinder heap. It is curious, too,
  how she connects and mingles with the furious quarrel I had with my uncle
  that very evening. That came absurdly. Indirectly Margaret was responsible.
  My mind was running on ideas she had revived and questions she had set
  clamouring, and quite inadvertently in my attempt to find solutions I talked
  so as to outrage his profoundest feelings...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">What a preposterous shindy that was!</p>

  <p>I sat with him in the smoking-room, propounding what I considered to be
  the most indisputable and non-contentious propositions
  conceivable&mdash;until, to my infinite amazement, he exploded and called me
  a "damned young puppy."</p>

  <p>It was seismic.</p>

  <p>"Tremendously interesting time," I said, "just in the beginning of making
  a civilisation."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said, with an averted face, and nodded, leaning forward over his
  cigar.</p>

  <p>I had not the remotest thought of annoying him.</p>

  <p>"Monstrous muddle of things we have got," I said, "jumbled streets, ugly
  population, ugly factories&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'd do a sight better if you had to do with it," said my uncle,
  regarding me askance.</p>

  <p>"Not me. But a world that had a collective plan and knew where it meant to
  be going would do a sight better, anyhow. We're all swimming in a flood of
  ill-calculated chances&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll be making out I organised that business down there&mdash;by
  chance&mdash;next," said my uncle, his voice thick with challenge.</p>

  <p>I went on as though I was back in Trinity.</p>

  <p>"There's a lot of chance in the making of all great businesses," I
  said.</p>

  <p>My uncle remarked that that showed how much I knew about businesses. If
  chance made businesses, why was it that he always succeeded and grew while
  those fools Ackroyd and Sons always took second place? He showed a
  disposition to tell the glorious history of how once Ackroyd's overshadowed
  him, and how now he could buy up Ackroyd's three times over. But I wanted to
  get out what was in my mind.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" I said, "as between man and man and business and business, some of
  course get the pull by this quality or that&mdash;but it's forces quite
  outside the individual case that make the big part of any success under
  modern conditions. <i>You</i> never invented pottery, nor any process in
  pottery that matters a rap in your works; it wasn't <i>your</i> foresight
  that joined all England up with railways and made it possible to organise
  production on an altogether different scale. You really at the utmost can't
  take credit for much more than being the sort of man who happened to fit what
  happened to be the requirements of the time, and who happened to be in a
  position to take advantage of them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was then my uncle cried out and called me a damned young puppy, and
  became involved in some unexpected trouble of his own.</p>

  <p>I woke up as it were from my analysis of the situation to discover him
  bent over a splendid spittoon, cursing incoherently, retching a little, and
  spitting out the end of his cigar which he had bitten off in his last attempt
  at self-control, and withal fully prepared as soon as he had cleared for
  action to give me just all that he considered to be the contents of his mind
  upon the condition of mine.</p>

  <p>Well, why shouldn't I talk my mind to him? He'd never had an outside view
  of himself for years, and I resolved to stand up to him. We went at it hammer
  and tongs! It became clear that he supposed me to be a Socialist, a zealous,
  embittered hater of all ownership&mdash;and also an educated man of the
  vilest, most pretentiously superior description. His principal grievance was
  that I thought I knew everything; to that he recurred again and again...</p>

  <p>We had been maintaining an armed truce with each other since my resolve to
  go up to Cambridge, and now we had out all that had accumulated between us.
  There had been stupendous accumulations...</p>

  <p>The particular things we said and did in that bawling encounter matter
  nothing at all in this story. I can't now estimate how near we came to
  fisticuffs. It ended with my saying, after a pungent reminder of benefits
  conferred and remembered, that I didn't want to stay another hour in his
  house. I went upstairs, in a state of puerile fury, to pack and go off to the
  Railway Hotel, while he, with ironical civility, telephoned for a cab.</p>

  <p>"Good riddance!" shouted my uncle, seeing me off into the night.</p>

  <p>On the face of it our row was preposterous, but the underlying reality of
  our quarrel was the essential antagonism, it seemed to me, in all human
  affairs, the antagonism between ideas and the established method, that is to
  say, between ideas and the rule of thumb. The world I hate is the
  rule-of-thumb world, the thing I and my kind of people exist for primarily is
  to battle with that, to annoy it, disarrange it, reconstruct it. We question
  everything, disturb anything that cannot give a clear justification to our
  questioning, because we believe inherently that our sense of disorder implies
  the possibility of a better order. Of course we are detestable. My uncle was
  of that other vaster mass who accept everything for the thing it seems to be,
  hate enquiry and analysis as a tramp hates washing, dread and resist change,
  oppose experiment, despise science. The world is our battleground; and all
  history, all literature that matters, all science, deals with this conflict
  of the thing that is and the speculative "if" that will destroy it.</p>

  <p>But that is why I did not see Margaret Seddon again for five years.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap2_02"
     name="chap2_02"></a>II. &mdash; MARGARET IN LONDON</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">I was twenty-seven when I met Margaret again, and the
  intervening five years had been years of vigorous activity for me, if not of
  very remarkable growth. When I saw her again, I could count myself a grown
  man. I think, indeed, I counted myself more completely grown than I was. At
  any rate, by all ordinary standards, I had "got on" very well, and my ideas,
  if they had not changed very greatly, had become much more definite and my
  ambitions clearer and bolder.</p>

  <p>I had long since abandoned my fellowship and come to London. I had
  published two books that had been talked about, written several articles, and
  established a regular relationship with <i>The Weekly Review</i> and <i>The
  Evening Gazette</i>. I was a member of the Eighty Club and learning to adapt
  the style of the Cambridge Union to larger uses. The London world had opened
  out to me very readily. I had developed a pleasant variety of social
  connections. I had made the acquaintance of Mr. Evesham, who had been
  attracted by my NEW RULER, and who talked about it and me, and so did a very
  great deal to make a way for me into the company of prominent and amusing
  people. I dined out quite frequently. The glitter and interest of good London
  dinner parties became a common experience. I liked the sort of conversation
  one got at them extremely, the little glow of duologues burning up into more
  general discussions, the closing-in of the men after the going of the women,
  the sage, substantial masculine gossiping, the later resumption of effective
  talk with some pleasant woman, graciously at her best. I had a wide range of
  houses; Cambridge had linked me to one or two correlated sets of artistic and
  literary people, and my books and Mr. Evesham and opened to me the big vague
  world of "society." I wasn't aggressive nor particularly snobbish nor
  troublesome, sometimes I talked well, and if I had nothing interesting to say
  I said as little as possible, and I had a youthful gravity of manner that was
  liked by hostesses. And the other side of my nature that first flared through
  the cover of restraints at Locarno, that too had had opportunity to develop
  along the line London renders practicable. I had had my experiences and
  secrets and adventures among that fringe of ill-mated or erratic or
  discredited women the London world possesses. The thing had long ago ceased
  to be a matter of magic or mystery, and had become a question of appetites
  and excitement, and among other things the excitement of not being found
  out.</p>

  <p>I write rather doubtfully of my growing during this period. Indeed I find
  it hard to judge whether I can say that I grew at all in any real sense of
  the word, between three and twenty and twenty-seven. It seems to me now to
  have been rather a phase of realisation and clarification. All the broad
  lines of my thought were laid down, I am sure, by the date of my Locarno
  adventure, but in those five years I discussed things over and over again
  with myself and others, filled out with concrete fact forms I had at first
  apprehended sketchily and conversationally, measured my powers against my
  ideals and the forces in the world about me. It was evident that many men no
  better than myself and with no greater advantages than mine had raised
  themselves to influential and even decisive positions in the worlds of
  politics and thought. I was gathering the confidence and knowledge necessary
  to attack the world in the large manner; I found I could write, and that
  people would let me write if I chose, as one having authority and not as the
  scribes. Socially and politically and intellectually I knew myself for an
  honest man, and that quite without any deliberation on my part this showed
  and made things easy for me. People trusted my good faith from the
  beginning&mdash;for all that I came from nowhere and had no better position
  than any adventurer.</p>

  <p>But the growth process was arrested, I was nothing bigger at twenty-seven
  than at twenty-two, however much saner and stronger, and any one looking
  closely into my mind during that period might well have imagined growth
  finished altogether. It is particularly evident to me now that I came no
  nearer to any understanding of women during that time. That Locarno affair
  was infinitely more to me than I had supposed. It ended
  something&mdash;nipped something in the bud perhaps&mdash;took me at a stride
  from a vague, fine, ignorant, closed world of emotion to intrigue and a
  perfectly definite and limited sensuality. It ended my youth, and for a time
  it prevented my manhood. I had never yet even peeped at the sweetest,
  profoundest thing in the world, the heart and meaning of a girl, or dreamt
  with any quality of reality of a wife or any such thing as a friend among
  womanhood. My vague anticipation of such things in life had vanished
  altogether. I turned away from their possibility. It seemed to me I knew what
  had to be known about womankind. I wanted to work hard, to get on to a
  position in which I could develop and forward my constructive projects.
  Women, I thought, had nothing to do with that. It seemed clear I could not
  marry for some years; I was attractive to certain types of women, I had
  vanity enough to give me an agreeable confidence in love-making, and I went
  about seeking a convenient mistress quite deliberately, some one who should
  serve my purpose and say in the end, like that kindly first mistress of mine,
  "I've done you no harm," and so release me. It seemed the only wise way of
  disposing of urgencies that might otherwise entangle and wreck the career I
  was intent upon.</p>

  <p>I don't apologise for, or defend my mental and moral phases. So it was I
  appraised life and prepared to take it, and so it is a thousand ambitious men
  see it to-day...</p>

  <p>For the rest these five years were a period of definition. My political
  conceptions were perfectly plain and honest. I had one constant desire ruling
  my thoughts. I meant to leave England and the empire better ordered than I
  found it, to organise and discipline, to build up a constructive and
  controlling State out of my world's confusions. We had, I saw, to suffuse
  education with public intention, to develop a new better-living generation
  with a collectivist habit of thought, to link now chaotic activities in every
  human affair, and particularly to catch that escaped, world-making,
  world-ruining, dangerous thing, industrial and financial enterprise, and
  bring it back to the service of the general good. I had then the precise
  image that still serves me as a symbol for all I wish to bring about, the
  image of an engineer building a lock in a swelling torrent&mdash;with water
  pressure as his only source of power. My thoughts and acts were habitually
  turned to that enterprise; it gave shape and direction to all my life. The
  problem that most engaged my mind during those years was the practical and
  personal problem of just where to apply myself to serve this almost innate
  purpose. How was I, a child of this confusion, struggling upward through the
  confusion, to take hold of things? Somewhere between politics and literature
  my grip must needs be found, but where? Always I seem to have been looking
  for that in those opening years, and disregarding everything else to discover
  it.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">The Baileys, under whose auspices I met Margaret again, were
  in the sharpest contrast with the narrow industrialism of the Staffordshire
  world. They were indeed at the other extreme of the scale, two active
  self-centred people, excessively devoted to the public service. It was
  natural I should gravitate to them, for they seemed to stand for the maturer,
  more disciplined, better informed expression of all I was then urgent to
  attempt to do. The bulk of their friends were politicians or public
  officials, they described themselves as publicists&mdash;a vague yet
  sufficiently significant term. They lived and worked in a hard little house
  in Chambers Street, Westminster, and made a centre for quite an astonishing
  amount of political and social activity.</p>

  <p>Willersley took me there one evening. The place was almost pretentiously
  matter-of-fact and unassuming. The narrow passage-hall, papered with some
  ancient yellowish paper, grained to imitate wood, was choked with hats and
  cloaks and an occasional feminine wrap. Motioned rather than announced by a
  tall Scotch servant woman, the only domestic I ever remember seeing there, we
  made our way up a narrow staircase past the open door of a small study packed
  with blue-books, to discover Altiora Bailey receiving before the fireplace in
  her drawing-room. She was a tall commanding figure, splendid but a little
  untidy in black silk and red beads, with dark eyes that had no depths, with a
  clear hard voice that had an almost visible prominence, aquiline features and
  straight black hair that was apt to get astray, that was now astray like the
  head feathers of an eagle in a gale. She stood with her hands behind her
  back, and talked in a high tenor of a projected Town Planning Bill with
  Blupp, who was practically in those days the secretary of the local
  Government Board. A very short broad man with thick ears and fat white hands
  writhing intertwined behind him, stood with his back to us, eager to bark
  interruptions into Altiora's discourse. A slender girl in pale blue,
  manifestly a young political wife, stood with one foot on the fender
  listening with an expression of entirely puzzled propitiation. A tall
  sandy-bearded bishop with the expression of a man in a trance completed this
  central group.</p>

  <p>The room was one of those long apartments once divided by folding doors,
  and reaching from back to front, that are common upon the first floors of
  London houses. Its walls were hung with two or three indifferent water
  colours, there was scarcely any furniture but a sofa or so and a chair, and
  the floor, severely carpeted with matting, was crowded with a curious medley
  of people, men predominating. Several were in evening dress, but most had the
  morning garb of the politician; the women were either severely rational or
  radiantly magnificent. Willersley pointed out to me the wife of the Secretary
  of State for War, and I recognised the Duchess of Clynes, who at that time
  cultivated intellectuality. I looked round, identifying a face here or there,
  and stepping back trod on some one's toe, and turned to find it belonged to
  the Right Hon. G. B. Mottisham, dear to the <i>Punch</i> caricaturists. He
  received my apology with that intentional charm that is one of his most
  delightful traits, and resumed his discussion. Beside him was Esmeer of
  Trinity, whom I had not seen since my Cambridge days...</p>

  <p>Willersley found an ex-member of the School Board for whom he had
  affinities, and left me to exchange experiences and comments upon the company
  with Esmeer. Esmeer was still a don; but he was nibbling, he said, at certain
  negotiations with <i>The Times</i> that might bring him down to London. He
  wanted to come to London. "We peep at things from Cambridge," he said.</p>

  <p>"This sort of thing," I said, "makes London necessary. It's the oddest
  gathering."</p>

  <p>"Every one comes here," said Esmeer. "Mostly we hate them like poison
  &mdash;jealousy&mdash;and little irritations&mdash;Altiora can be a horror at
  times&mdash;but we <i>have</i> to come."</p>

  <p>"Things are being done?"</p>

  <p>"Oh!&mdash;no doubt of it. It's one of the parts of the British
  machinery&mdash;that doesn't show... But nobody else could do it.</p>

  <p>"Two people," said Esmeer, "who've planned to be a power&mdash;in an
  original way. And by Jove! they've done it!"</p>

  <p>I did not for some time pick out Oscar Bailey, and then Esmeer showed him
  to me in elaborately confidential talk in a corner with a
  distinguished-looking stranger wearing a ribbon. Oscar had none of the fine
  appearance of his wife; he was a short sturdy figure with a rounded
  protruding abdomen and a curious broad, flattened, clean-shaven face that
  seemed nearly all forehead. He was of Anglo-Hungarian extraction, and I have
  always fancied something Mongolian in his type. He peered up with reddish
  swollen-looking eyes over gilt-edged glasses that were divided horizontally
  into portions of different refractive power, and he talking in an
  ingratiating undertone, with busy thin lips, an eager lisp and nervous
  movements of the hand.</p>

  <p>People say that thirty years before at Oxford he was almost exactly the
  same eager, clever little man he was when I first met him. He had come up to
  Balliol bristling with extraordinary degrees and prizes capturned in
  provincial and Irish and Scotch universities&mdash;and had made a name for
  himself as the most formidable dealer in exact fact the rhetoricians of the
  Union had ever had to encounter. From Oxford he had gone on to a position in
  the Higher Division of the Civil Service, I think in the War Office, and had
  speedily made a place for himself as a political journalist. He was a
  particularly neat controversialist, and very full of political and
  sociological ideas. He had a quite astounding memory for facts and a mastery
  of detailed analysis, and the time afforded scope for these gifts. The later
  eighties were full of politico-social discussion, and he became a prominent
  name upon the contents list of <i>The Nineteenth Century</i>, <i>The
  Fortnightly</i> and <i>Contemporary</i> chiefly as a half sympathetic but
  frequently very damaging critic of the socialism of that period. He won the
  immense respect of every one specially interested in social and political
  questions, he soon achieved the limited distinction that is awarded such
  capacity, and at that I think he would have remained for the rest of his life
  if he had not encountered Altiora.</p>

  <p>But Altiora Macvitie was an altogether exceptional woman, an extraordinary
  mixture of qualities, the one woman in the world who could make something
  more out of Bailey than that. She had much of the vigour and handsomeness of
  a slender impudent young man, and an unscrupulousness altogether feminine.
  She was one of those women who are waiting in&mdash;what is the
  word?&mdash;muliebrity. She had courage and initiative and a philosophical
  way of handling questions, and she could be bored by regular work like a man.
  She was entirely unfitted for her sex's sphere. She was neither uncertain,
  coy nor hard to please, and altogether too stimulating and aggressive for any
  gentleman's hours of ease. Her cookery would have been about as sketchy as
  her handwriting, which was generally quite illegible, and she would have
  made, I feel sure, a shocking bad nurse. Yet you mustn't imagine she was an
  inelegant or unbeautiful woman, and she is inconceivable to me in high
  collars or any sort of masculine garment. But her soul was bony, and at the
  base of her was a vanity gaunt and greedy! When she wasn't in a state of
  personal untidiness that was partly a protest against the waste of hours
  exacted by the toilet and partly a natural disinclination, she had a gypsy
  splendour of black and red and silver all her own. And somewhen in the early
  nineties she met and married Bailey.</p>

  <p>I know very little about her early years. She was the only daughter of Sir
  Deighton Macvitie, who applied the iodoform process to cotton, and only his
  subsequent unfortunate attempts to become a Cotton King prevented her being a
  very rich woman. As it was she had a tolerable independence. She came into
  prominence as one of the more able of the little shoal of young women who
  were led into politico-philanthropic activities by the influence of the
  earlier novels of Mrs. Humphry Ward&mdash;the Marcella crop. She went
  "slumming" with distinguished vigour, which was quite usual in those
  days&mdash;and returned from her experiences as an amateur flower girl with
  clear and original views about the problem&mdash;which is and always had been
  unusual. She had not married, I suppose because her standards were high, and
  men are cowards and with an instinctive appetite for muliebrity. She had kept
  house for her father by speaking occasionally to the housekeeper, butler and
  cook her mother had left her, and gathering the most interesting dinner
  parties she could, and had married off four orphan nieces in a harsh and
  successful manner. After her father's smash and death she came out as a
  writer upon social questions and a scathing critic of the Charity
  Organisation Society, and she was three and thirty and a little at loose ends
  when she met Oscar Bailey, so to speak, in <i>The Contemporary Review</i>.
  The lurking woman in her nature was fascinated by the ease and precision with
  which the little man rolled over all sorts of important and authoritative
  people, she was the first to discover a sort of imaginative bigness in his
  still growing mind, the forehead perhaps carried him off physically, and she
  took occasion to meet and subjugate him, and, so soon as he had sufficiently
  recovered from his abject humility and a certain panic at her attentions,
  marry him.</p>

  <p>This had opened a new phase in the lives of Bailey and herself. The two
  supplemented each other to an extraordinary extent. Their subsequent career
  was, I think, almost entirely her invention. She was aggressive, imaginative,
  and had a great capacity for ideas, while he was almost destitute of
  initiative, and could do nothing with ideas except remember and discuss them.
  She was, if not exact, at least indolent, with a strong disposition to save
  energy by sketching&mdash;even her handwriting showed that&mdash;while he was
  inexhaustibly industrious with a relentless invariable caligraphy that grew
  larger and clearer as the years passed by. She had a considerable power of
  charming; she could be just as nice to people&mdash;and incidentally just as
  nasty&mdash;as she wanted to be. He was always just the same, a little
  confidential and <i>sotto voce</i>, artlessly rude and egoistic in an
  undignified way. She had considerable social experience, good social
  connections, and considerable social ambition, while he had none of these
  things. She saw in a flash her opportunity to redeem his defects, use his
  powers, and do large, novel, rather startling things. She ran him. Her
  marriage, which shocked her friends and relations beyond measure&mdash;for a
  time they would only speak of Bailey as "that gnome"&mdash;was a stroke of
  genius, and forthwith they proceeded to make themselves the most formidable
  and distinguished couple conceivable. P. B. P., she boasted, was engraved
  inside their wedding rings, Pro Bono Publico, and she meant it to be no idle
  threat. She had discovered very early that the last thing influential people
  will do is to work. Everything in their lives tends to make them dependent
  upon a supply of confidently administered detail. Their business is with the
  window and not the stock behind, and in the end they are dependent upon the
  stock behind for what goes into the window. She linked with that the fact
  that Bailey had a mind as orderly as a museum, and an invincible power over
  detail. She saw that if two people took the necessary pains to know the facts
  of government and administration with precision, to gather together knowledge
  that was dispersed and confused, to be able to say precisely what had to be
  done and what avoided in this eventuality or that, they would necessarily
  become a centre of reference for all sorts of legislative proposals and
  political expedients, and she went unhesitatingly upon that.</p>

  <p>Bailey, under her vigorous direction, threw up his post in the Civil
  Service and abandoned sporadic controversies, and they devoted themselves to
  the elaboration and realisation of this centre of public information she had
  conceived as their role. They set out to study the methods and organisation
  and realities of government in the most elaborate manner. They did the work
  as no one had ever hitherto dreamt of doing it. They planned the research on
  a thoroughly satisfying scale, and arranged their lives almost entirely for
  it. They took that house in Chambers Street and furnished it with severe
  economy, they discovered that Scotch domestic who is destined to be the
  guardian and tyrant of their declining years, and they set to work. Their
  first book, "The Permanent Official," fills three plump volumes, and took
  them and their two secretaries upwards of four years to do. It is an
  amazingly good book, an enduring achievement. In a hundred directions the
  history and the administrative treatment of the public service was clarified
  for all time...</p>

  <p>They worked regularly every morning from nine to twelve, they lunched
  lightly but severely, in the afternoon they "took exercise" or Bailey
  attended meetings of the London School Board, on which he served, he said,
  for the purposes of study&mdash;he also became a railway director for the
  same end. In the late afternoon Altiora was at home to various callers, and
  in the evening came dinner or a reception or both.</p>

  <p>Her dinners and gatherings were a very important feature in their scheme.
  She got together all sorts of interesting people in or about the public
  service, she mixed the obscurely efficient with the ill-instructed famous and
  the rudderless rich, got together in one room more of the factors in our
  strange jumble of a public life than had ever met easily before. She fed them
  with a shameless austerity that kept the conversation brilliant, on a soup, a
  plain fish, and mutton or boiled fowl and milk pudding, with nothing to drink
  but whisky and soda, and hot and cold water, and milk and lemonade. Everybody
  was soon very glad indeed to come to that. She boasted how little her
  housekeeping cost her, and sought constantly for fresh economies that would
  enable her, she said, to sustain an additional private secretary. Secretaries
  were the Baileys' one extravagance, they loved to think of searches going on
  in the British Museum, and letters being cleared up and precis made overhead,
  while they sat in the little study and worked together, Bailey with a
  clockwork industry, and Altiora in splendid flashes between intervals of
  cigarettes and meditation. "All efficient public careers," said Altiora,
  "consist in the proper direction of secretaries."</p>

  <p>"If everything goes well I shall have another secretary next year,"
  Altiora told me. "I wish I could refuse people dinner napkins. Imagine what
  it means in washing! I dare most things... But as it is, they stand a lot of
  hardship here."</p>

  <p>"There's something of the miser in both these people," said Esmeer, and
  the thing was perfectly true. For, after all, the miser is nothing more than
  a man who either through want of imagination or want of suggestion misapplies
  to a base use a natural power of concentration upon one end. The
  concentration itself is neither good nor evil, but a power that can be used
  in either way. And the Baileys gathered and reinvested usuriously not money,
  but knowledge of the utmost value in human affairs. They produced an effect
  of having found themselves&mdash;completely. One envied them at times
  extraordinarily. I was attracted, I was dazzled&mdash;and at the same time
  there was something about Bailey's big wrinkled forehead, his lisping broad
  mouth, the gestures of his hands and an uncivil preoccupation I could not
  endure...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Their effect upon me was from the outset very
  considerable.</p>

  <p>Both of them found occasion on that first visit of mine to talk to me
  about my published writings and particularly about my then just published
  book <i>The New Ruler</i>, which had interested them very much. It fell in
  indeed so closely with their own way of thinking that I doubt if they ever
  understood how independently I had arrived at my conclusions. It was their
  weakness to claim excessively. That irritation, however, came later. We
  discovered each other immensely; for a time it produced a tremendous sense of
  kindred and co- operation.</p>

  <p>Altiora, I remember, maintained that there existed a great army of such
  constructive-minded people as ourselves&mdash;as yet undiscovered by one
  another.</p>

  <p>"It's like boring a tunnel through a mountain," said Oscar, "and presently
  hearing the tapping of the workers from the other end."</p>

  <p>"If you didn't know of them beforehand," I said, "it might be a rather
  badly joined tunnel."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Altiora with a high note, "and that's why we all want to
  find out each other..."</p>

  <p>They didn't talk like that on our first encounter, but they urged me to
  lunch with them next day, and then it was we went into things. A woman
  Factory Inspector and the Educational Minister for New Banksland and his wife
  were also there, but I don't remember they made any contribution to the
  conversation. The Baileys saw to that. They kept on at me in an urgent
  litigious way.</p>

  <p>"We have read your book," each began&mdash;as though it had been a joint
  function. "And we consider&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I protested, "I think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>That was a secondary matter.</p>

  <p>"They did not consider," said Altiora, raising her voice and going right
  over me, that I had allowed sufficiently for the inevitable development of an
  official administrative class in the modern state."</p>

  <p>"Nor of its importance," echoed Oscar.</p>

  <p>That, they explained in a sort of chorus, was the cardinal idea of their
  lives, what they were up to, what they stood for. "We want to suggest to
  you," they said&mdash;and I found this was a stock opening of
  theirs&mdash;"that from the mere necessities of convenience elected bodies
  MUST avail themselves more and more of the services of expert officials. We
  have that very much in mind. The more complicated and technical affairs
  become, the less confidence will the elected official have in himself. We
  want to suggest that these expert officials must necessarily develop into a
  new class and a very powerful class in the community. We want to organise
  that. It may be THE power of the future. They will necessarily have to have
  very much of a common training. We consider ourselves as amateur unpaid
  precursors of such a class."...</p>

  <p>The vision they displayed for my consideration as the aim of public-
  spirited endeavour, seemed like a harder, narrower, more specialised version
  of the idea of a trained and disciplined state that Willersley and I had
  worked out in the Alps. They wanted things more organised, more correlated
  with government and a collective purpose, just as we did, but they saw it not
  in terms of a growing collective understanding, but in terms of
  functionaries, legislative change, and methods of administration...</p>

  <p>It wasn't clear at first how we differed. The Baileys were very anxious to
  win me to co-operation, and I was quite prepared at first to identify their
  distinctive expressions with phrases of my own, and so we came very readily
  into an alliance that was to last some years, and break at last very
  painfully. Altiora manifestly liked me, I was soon discussing with her the
  perplexity I found in placing myself efficiently in the world, the problem of
  how to take hold of things that occupied my thoughts, and she was sketching
  out careers for my consideration, very much as an architect on his first
  visit sketches houses, considers requirements, and puts before you this
  example and that of the more or less similar thing already done...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">It is easy to see how much in common there was between the
  Baileys and me, and how natural it was that I should become a constant
  visitor at their house and an ally of theirs in many enterprises. It is not
  nearly so easy to define the profound antagonism of spirit that also held
  between us. There was a difference in texture, a difference in quality. How
  can I express it? The shapes of our thoughts were the same, but the substance
  quite different. It was as if they had made in china or cast iron what I had
  made in transparent living matter. (The comparison is manifestly from my
  point of view.) Certain things never seemed to show through their ideas that
  were visible, refracted perhaps and distorted, but visible always through
  mine.</p>

  <p>I thought for a time the essential difference lay in our relation to
  beauty. With me beauty is quite primary in life; I like truth, order and
  goodness, wholly because they are beautiful or lead straight to beautiful
  consequences. The Baileys either hadn't got that or they didn't see it. They
  seemed at times to prefer things harsh and ugly. That puzzled me extremely.
  The esthetic quality of many of their proposals, the "manners" of their work,
  so to speak, were at times as dreadful as&mdash;well, War Office barrack
  architecture. A caricature by its exaggerated statements will sometimes serve
  to point a truth by antagonising falsity and falsity. I remember talking to a
  prominent museum official in need of more public funds for the work he had in
  hand. I mentioned the possibility of enlisting Bailey's influence.</p>

  <p>"Oh, we don't want Philistines like that infernal Bottle-Imp running us,"
  he said hastily, and would hear of no concerted action for the end he had in
  view. "I'd rather not have the extension.</p>

  <p>"You see," he went on to explain, "Bailey's wanting in the
  essentials."</p>

  <p>"What essentials?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Oh! he'd be like a nasty oily efficient little machine for some merely
  subordinate necessity among all my delicate stuff. He'd do all we wanted no
  doubt in the way of money and powers&mdash;and he'd do it wrong and mess the
  place for ever. Hands all black, you know. He's just a means. Just a very
  aggressive and unmanageable means. This isn't a plumber's job..."</p>

  <p>I stuck to my argument.</p>

  <p>"I don't <i>like</i> him," said the official conclusively, and it seemed
  to me at the time he was just blind prejudice speaking...</p>

  <p>I came nearer the truth of the matter as I came to realise that our
  philosophies differed profoundly. That isn't a very curable
  difference,&mdash;once people have grown up. Theirs was a philosophy devoid
  of <i>finesse</i>. Temperamentally the Baileys were specialised,
  concentrated, accurate, while I am urged either by some Inner force or some
  entirely assimilated influence in my training, always to round off and shadow
  my outlines. I hate them hard. I would sacrifice detail to modelling always,
  and the Baileys, it seemed to me, loved a world as flat and metallic as
  Sidney Cooper's cows. If they had the universe in hand I know they would take
  down all the trees and put up stamped tin green shades and sunlight
  accumulators. Altiora thought trees hopelessly irregular and sea cliffs a
  great mistake... I got things clearer as time went on. Though it was an
  Hegelian mess of which I had partaken at Codger's table by way of a
  philosophical training, my sympathies have always been Pragmatist. I belong
  almost by nature to that school of Pragmatism that, following the medieval
  Nominalists, bases itself upon a denial of the reality of classes, and of the
  validity of general laws. The Baileys classified everything. They were, in
  the scholastic sense&mdash;which so oddly contradicts the modern use of the
  word "Realists." They believed classes were <i>real</i> and independent of
  their individuals. This is the common habit of all so-called educated people
  who have no metaphysical aptitude and no metaphysical training. It leads them
  to a progressive misunderstanding of the world. It was a favourite trick of
  Altiora's to speak of everybody as a "type"; she saw men as samples moving;
  her dining-room became a chamber of representatives. It gave a tremendously
  scientific air to many of their generalisations, using "scientific" in its
  nineteenth-century uncritical Herbert Spencer sense, an air that only began
  to disappear when you thought them over again in terms of actuality and the
  people one knew...</p>

  <p>At the Baileys' one always seemed to be getting one's hands on the very
  strings that guided the world. You heard legislation projected to affect this
  "type" and that; statistics marched by you with sin and shame and injustice
  and misery reduced to quite manageable percentages, you found men who were to
  frame or amend bills in grave and intimate exchange with Bailey's
  omniscience, you heard Altiora canvassing approaching resignations and
  possible appointments that might make or mar a revolution in administrative
  methods, and doing it with a vigorous directness that manifestly swayed the
  decision; and you felt you were in a sort of signal box with levers all about
  you, and the world outside there, albeit a little dark and mysterious beyond
  the window, running on its lines in ready obedience to these unhesitating
  lights, true and steady to trim termini.</p>

  <p>And then with all this administrative fizzle, this pseudo-scientific
  administrative chatter, dying away in your head, out you went into the
  limitless grimy chaos of London streets and squares, roads and avenues lined
  with teeming houses, each larger than the Chambers Street house and at least
  equally alive, you saw the chaotic clamour of hoardings, the jumble of
  traffic, the coming and going of mysterious myriads, you heard the rumble of
  traffic like the noise of a torrent; a vague incessant murmur of cries and
  voices, wanton crimes and accidents bawled at you from the placards;
  imperative unaccountable fashions swaggered triumphant in dazzling windows of
  the shops; and you found yourself swaying back to the opposite conviction
  that the huge formless spirit of the world it was that held the strings and
  danced the puppets on the Bailey stage...</p>

  <p>Under the lamps you were jostled by people like my Staffordshire uncle out
  for a spree, you saw shy youths conversing with prostitutes, you passed young
  lovers pairing with an entire disregard of the social suitability of the
  "types" they might blend or create, you saw men leaning drunken against lamp-
  posts whom you knew for the "type" that will charge with fixed bayonets into
  the face of death, and you found yourself unable to imagine little Bailey
  achieving either drunkenness or the careless defiance of annihilation. You
  realised that quite a lot of types were underrepresented in Chambers Street,
  that feral and obscure and altogether monstrous forces must be at work, as
  yet altogether unassimilated by those neat administrative
  reorganisations.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Altiora, I remember, preluded Margaret's reappearance by
  announcing her as a "new type."</p>

  <p>I was accustomed to go early to the Baileys' dinners in those days, for a
  preliminary gossip with Altiora in front of her drawing-room fire. One got
  her alone, and that early arrival was a little sign of appreciation she
  valued. She had every woman's need of followers and servants.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to send you down to-night," she said, "with a very interesting
  type indeed&mdash;one of the new generation of serious gals. Middle-class
  origin&mdash;and quite well off. Rich in fact. Her step-father was a
  solicitor and something of an <i>entrepreneur</i> towards the end, I
  fancy&mdash;in the Black Country. There was a little brother died, and she's
  lost her mother quite recently. Quite on her own, so to speak. She's never
  been out into society very much, and doesn't seem really very anxious to
  go... Not exactly an intellectual person, you know, but quiet, and great
  force of character. Came up to London on her own and came to us&mdash;someone
  had told her we were the sort of people to advise her&mdash;to ask what to
  do. I'm sure she'll interest you."</p>

  <p>"What <i>can</i> people of that sort do?" I asked. "Is she capable of
  investigation?"</p>

  <p>Altiora compressed her lips and shook her head. She always did shake her
  head when you asked that of anyone.</p>

  <p>"Of course what she ought to do," said Altiora, with her silk dress pulled
  back from her knee before the fire, and with a lift of her voice towards a
  chuckle at her daring way of putting things, "is to marry a member of
  Parliament and see he does his work... Perhaps she will. It's a very
  exceptional gal who can do anything by herself&mdash;quite exceptional. The
  more serious they are&mdash;without being exceptional&mdash;the more we want
  them to marry."</p>

  <p>Her exposition was truncated by the entry of the type in question.</p>

  <p>"Well!" cried Altiora turning, and with a high note of welcome,
  "<i>Here</i> you are!"</p>

  <p>Margaret had gained in dignity and prettiness by the lapse of five years,
  and she was now very beautifully and richly and simply dressed. Her fair hair
  had been done in some way that made it seem softer and more abundant than it
  was in my memory, and a gleam of purple velvet-set diamonds showed amidst its
  mist of little golden and brown lines. Her dress was of white and violet, the
  last trace of mourning for her mother, and confessed the gracious droop of
  her tall and slender body. She did not suggest Staffordshire at all, and I
  was puzzled for a moment to think where I had met her. Her sweetly shaped
  mouth with the slight obliquity of the lip and the little kink in her brow
  were extraordinarily familiar to me. But she had either been prepared by
  Altiora or she remembered my name. "We met," she said, "while my step-father
  was alive&mdash;at Misterton. You came to see us"; and instantly I recalled
  the sunshine between the apple blossom and a slender pale blue girlish shape
  among the daffodils, like something that had sprung from a bulb itself. I
  recalled at once that I had found her very interesting, though I did not
  clearly remember how it was she had interested me.</p>

  <p>Other guests arrived&mdash;it was one of Altiora's boldly blended mixtures
  of people with ideas and people with influence or money who might perhaps be
  expected to resonate to them. Bailey came down late with an air of hurry, and
  was introduced to Margaret and said absolutely nothing to her&mdash;there
  being no information either to receive or impart and nothing to do&mdash;but
  stood snatching his left cheek until I rescued him and her, and left him free
  to congratulate the new Lady Snape on her husband's K. C. B.</p>

  <p>I took Margaret down. We achieved no feats of mutual expression, except
  that it was abundantly clear we were both very pleased and interested to meet
  again, and that we had both kept memories of each other. We made that
  Misterton tea-party and the subsequent marriages of my cousins and the world
  of Burslem generally, matter for quite an agreeable conversation until at
  last Altiora, following her invariable custom, called me by name imperatively
  out of our duologue. "Mr. Remington," she said, "we want your opinion&mdash;"
  in her entirely characteristic effort to get all the threads of conversation
  into her own hands for the climax that always wound up her dinners. How the
  other women used to hate those concluding raids of hers! I forget most of the
  other people at that dinner, nor can I recall what the crowning rally was
  about. It didn't in any way join on to my impression of Margaret.</p>

  <p>In the drawing-room of the matting floor I rejoined her, with Altiora's
  manifest connivance, and in the interval I had been thinking of our former
  meeting.</p>

  <p>"Do you find London," I asked, "give you more opportunity for doing things
  and learning things than Burslem?"</p>

  <p>She showed at once she appreciated my allusion to her former confidences.
  "I was very discontented then," she said and paused. "I've really only been
  in London for a few months. It's so different. In Burslem, life seems all
  business and getting&mdash;without any reason. One went on and it didn't seem
  to mean anything. At least anything that mattered... London seems to be so
  full of meanings&mdash;all mixed up together."</p>

  <p>She knitted her brows over her words and smiled appealingly at the end as
  if for consideration for her inadequate expression, appealingly and almost
  humorously.</p>

  <p>I looked understandingly at her. "We have all," I agreed, "to come to
  London."</p>

  <p>"One sees so much distress," she added, as if she felt she had completely
  omitted something, and needed a codicil.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing in London?"</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking of studying. Some social question. I thought perhaps I might
  go and study social conditions as Mrs. Bailey did, go perhaps as a work-girl
  or see the reality of living in, but Mrs. Bailey thought perhaps it wasn't
  quite my work."</p>

  <p>"Are you studying?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to a good many lectures, and perhaps I shall take up a regular
  course at the Westminster School of Politics and Sociology. But Mrs. Bailey
  doesn't seem to believe very much in that either."</p>

  <p>Her faintly whimsical smile returned. "I seem rather indefinite," she
  apologised, "but one does not want to get entangled in things one can't do.
  One&mdash;one has so many advantages, one's life seems to be such a trust and
  such a responsibility&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped.</p>

  <p>"A man gets driven into work," I said.</p>

  <p>"It must be splendid to be Mrs. Bailey," she replied with a glance of
  envious admiration across the room.</p>

  <p>"<i>She</i> has no doubts, anyhow," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"She <i>had</i>," said Margaret with the pride of one who has received
  great confidences.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">"You've met before?" said Altiora, a day or so later.</p>

  <p>I explained when.</p>

  <p>"You find her interesting?"</p>

  <p>I saw in a flash that Altiora meant to marry me to Margaret.</p>

  <p>Her intention became much clearer as the year developed. Altiora was
  systematic even in matters that evade system. I was to marry Margaret, and
  freed from the need of making an income I was to come into politics&mdash;as
  an exponent of Baileyism. She put it down with the other excellent and
  advantageous things that should occupy her summer holiday. It was her pride
  and glory to put things down and plan them out in detail beforehand, and I'm
  not quite sure that she did not even mark off the day upon which the
  engagement was to be declared. If she did, I disappointed her. We didn't come
  to an engagement, in spite of the broadest hints and the glaring obviousness
  of everything, that summer.</p>

  <p>Every summer the Baileys went out of London to some house they hired or
  borrowed, leaving their secretaries toiling behind, and they went on working
  hard in the mornings and evenings and taking exercise in the open air in the
  afternoon. They cycled assiduously and went for long walks at a trot, and
  raided and studied (and incidentally explained themselves to) any social
  "types" that lived in the neighbourhood. One invaded type, resentful under
  research, described them with a dreadful aptness as Donna Quixote and Sancho
  Panza&mdash;and himself as a harmless windmill, hurting no one and signifying
  nothing. She did rather tilt at things. This particular summer they were at a
  pleasant farmhouse in level country near Pangbourne, belonging to the Hon.
  Wilfrid Winchester, and they asked me to come down to rooms in the
  neighbourhood&mdash;Altiora took them for a month for me in August&mdash;and
  board with them upon extremely reasonable terms; and when I got there I found
  Margaret sitting in a hammock at Altiora's feet. Lots of people, I gathered,
  were coming and going in the neighbourhood, the Ponts were in a villa on the
  river, and the Rickhams' houseboat was to moor for some days; but these
  irruptions did not impede a great deal of duologue between Margaret and
  myself.</p>

  <p>Altiora was efficient rather than artistic in her match-making. She sent
  us off for long walks together&mdash;Margaret was a fairly good walker
  &mdash;she exhumed some defective croquet things and incited us to croquet,
  not understanding that detestable game is the worst stimulant for lovers in
  the world. And Margaret and I were always getting left about, and finding
  ourselves for odd half-hours in the kitchen-garden with nothing to do except
  talk, or we were told with a wave of the hand to run away and amuse each
  other.</p>

  <p>Altiora even tried a picnic in canoes, knowing from fiction rather than
  imagination or experience the conclusive nature of such excursions. But there
  she fumbled at the last moment, and elected at the river's brink to share a
  canoe with me. Bailey showed so much zeal and so little skill&mdash;his hat
  fell off and he became miraculously nothing but paddle-clutching hands and a
  vast wrinkled brow&mdash;that at last he had to be paddled ignominiously by
  Margaret, while Altiora, after a phase of rigid discretion, as nearly as
  possible drowned herself&mdash;and me no doubt into the bargain&mdash;with a
  sudden lateral gesture of the arm to emphasise the high note with which she
  dismissed the efficiency of the Charity Organisation Society. We shipped
  about an inch of water and sat in it for the rest of the time, an
  inconvenience she disregarded heroically. We had difficulties in landing
  Oscar from his frail craft upon the ait of our feasting,&mdash;he didn't
  balance sideways and was much alarmed, and afterwards, as Margaret had a pain
  in her back, I took him in my canoe, let him hide his shame with an
  ineffectual but not positively harmful paddle, and towed the other by means
  of the joined painters. Still it was the fault of the inadequate information
  supplied in the books and not of Altiora that that was not the date of my
  betrothal.</p>

  <p>I find it not a little difficult to state what kept me back from proposing
  marriage to Margaret that summer, and what urged me forward at last to marry
  her. It is so much easier to remember one's resolutions than to remember the
  moods and suggestions that produced them.</p>

  <p>Marrying and getting married was, I think, a pretty simple affair to
  Altiora; it was something that happened to the adolescent and unmarried when
  you threw them together under the circumstances of health, warmth and
  leisure. It happened with the kindly and approving smiles of the more
  experienced elders who had organised these proximities. The young people
  married, settled down, children ensued, and father and mother turned their
  minds, now decently and properly disillusioned, to other things. That to
  Altiora was the normal sexual life, and she believed it to be the quality of
  the great bulk of the life about her.</p>

  <p>One of the great barriers to human understanding is the wide temperamental
  difference one finds in the values of things relating to sex. It is the issue
  upon which people most need training in charity and imaginative sympathy.
  Here are no universal standards at all, and indeed for no single man nor
  woman does there seem to be any fixed standard, so much do the accidents of
  circumstances and one's physical phases affect one's interpretations. There
  is nothing in the whole range of sexual fact that may not seem supremely
  beautiful or humanly jolly or magnificently wicked or disgusting or trivial
  or utterly insignificant, according to the eye that sees or the mood that
  colours. Here is something that may fill the skies and every waking hour or
  be almost completely banished from a life. It may be everything on Monday and
  less than nothing on Saturday. And we make our laws and rules as though in
  these matters all men and women were commensurable one with another, with an
  equal steadfast passion and an equal constant duty...</p>

  <p>I don't know what dreams Altiora may have had in her schoolroom days, I
  always suspected her of suppressed and forgotten phases, but certainly her
  general effect now was of an entirely passionless worldliness in these
  matters. Indeed so far as I could get at her, she regarded sexual passion as
  being hardly more legitimate in a civilised person than&mdash;let us
  say&mdash;homicidal mania. She must have forgotten&mdash;and Bailey too. I
  suspect she forgot before she married him. I don't suppose either of them had
  the slightest intimation of the dimensions sexual love can take in the
  thoughts of the great majority of people with whom they come in contact. They
  loved in their way&mdash;an intellectual way it was and a fond way&mdash;but
  it had no relation to beauty and physical sensation&mdash;except that there
  seemed a decree of exile against these things. They got their glow in high
  moments of altruistic ambition&mdash;and in moments of vivid worldly success.
  They sat at opposite ends of their dinner table with so and so "captured,"
  and so and so, flushed with a mutual approval. They saw people in love
  forgetful and distraught about them, and just put it down to forgetfulness
  and distraction. At any rate Altiora manifestly viewed my situation and
  Margaret's with an abnormal and entirely misleading simplicity. There was the
  girl, rich, with an acceptable claim to be beautiful, shiningly virtuous,
  quite capable of political interests, and there was I, talented, ambitious
  and full of political and social passion, in need of just the money, devotion
  and regularisation Margaret could provide. We were both unmarried&mdash;white
  sheets of uninscribed paper. Was there ever a simpler situation? What more
  could we possibly want?</p>

  <p>She was even a little offended at the inconclusiveness that did not settle
  things at Pangbourne. I seemed to her, I suspect, to reflect upon her
  judgment and good intentions.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">I didn't see things with Altiora's simplicity.</p>

  <p>I admired Margaret very much, I was fully aware of all that she and I
  might give each other; indeed so far as Altiora went we were quite in
  agreement. But what seemed solid ground to Altiora and the ultimate footing
  of her emasculated world, was to me just the superficial covering of a gulf
  &mdash;oh! abysses of vague and dim, and yet stupendously significant
  things.</p>

  <p>I couldn't dismiss the interests and the passion of sex as Altiora did.
  Work, I agreed, was important; career and success; but deep unanalysable
  instincts told me this preoccupation was a thing quite as important;
  dangerous, interfering, destructive indeed, but none the less a dominating
  interest in life. I have told how flittingly and uninvited it came like a
  moth from the outer twilight into my life, how it grew in me with my manhood,
  how it found its way to speech and grew daring, and led me at last to
  experience. After that adventure at Locarno sex and the interests and desires
  of sex never left me for long at peace. I went on with my work and my career,
  and all the time it was like&mdash;like someone talking ever and again in a
  room while one tries to write.</p>

  <p>There were times when I could have wished the world a world all of men, so
  greatly did this unassimilated series of motives and curiosities hamper me;
  and times when I could have wished the world all of women. I seemed always to
  be seeking something in women, in girls, and I was never clear what it was I
  was seeking. But never&mdash;even at my coarsest&mdash;was I moved by
  physical desire alone. Was I seeking help and fellowship? Was I seeking some
  intimacy with beauty? It was a thing too formless to state, that I seemed
  always desiring to attain and never attaining. Waves of gross sensuousness
  arose out of this preoccupation, carried me to a crisis of gratification or
  disappointment that was clearly not the needed thing; they passed and left my
  mind free again for a time to get on with the permanent pursuits of my life.
  And then presently this solicitude would have me again, an irrelevance as it
  seemed, and yet a constantly recurring demand.</p>

  <p>I don't want particularly to dwell upon things that are disagreeable for
  others to read, but I cannot leave them out of my story and get the right
  proportions of the forces I am balancing. I was no abnormal man, and that
  world of order we desire to make must be built of such stuff as I was and am
  and can beget. You cannot have a world of Baileys; it would end in one
  orderly generation. Humanity is begotten in Desire, lives by Desire.</p>

  <p>"Love which is lust, is the Lamp in the Tomb; Love which is lust, is the
  Call from the Gloom."</p>

  <p>I echo Henley.</p>

  <p>I suppose the life of celibacy which the active, well-fed, well-exercised
  and imaginatively stirred young man of the educated classes is supposed to
  lead from the age of nineteen or twenty, when Nature certainly meant him to
  marry, to thirty or more, when civilisation permits him to do so, is the most
  impossible thing in the world. We deal here with facts that are kept secret
  and obscure, but I doubt for my own part if more than one man out of five in
  our class satisfies that ideal demand. The rest are even as I was, and
  Hatherleigh and Esmeer and all the men I knew. I draw no lessons and offer no
  panacea; I have to tell the quality of life, and this is how it is. This is
  how it will remain until men and women have the courage to face the facts of
  life.</p>

  <p>I was no systematic libertine, you must understand; things happened to me
  and desire drove me. Any young man would have served for that Locarno
  adventure, and after that what had been a mystic and wonderful thing passed
  rapidly into a gross, manifestly misdirected and complicating one. I can
  count a meagre tale of five illicit loves in the days of my youth, to include
  that first experience, and of them all only two were sustained relationships.
  Besides these five "affairs," on one or two occasions I dipped so low as the
  inky dismal sensuality of the streets, and made one of those pairs of
  correlated figures, the woman in her squalid finery sailing homeward, the man
  modestly aloof and behind, that every night in the London year flit by the
  score of thousands across the sight of the observant...</p>

  <p>How ugly it is to recall; ugly and shameful now without qualification! Yet
  at the time there was surely something not altogether ugly in
  it&mdash;something that has vanished, some fine thing mortally ailing.</p>

  <p>One such occasion I recall as if it were a vision deep down in a pit, as
  if it had happened in another state of existence to someone else. And yet it
  is the sort of thing that has happened, once or twice at least, to half the
  men in London who have been in a position to make it possible. Let me try and
  give you its peculiar effect. Man or woman, you ought to know of it.</p>

  <p>Figure to yourself a dingy room, somewhere in that network of streets that
  lies about Tottenham Court Road, a dingy bedroom lit by a solitary candle and
  carpeted with scraps and patches, with curtains of cretonne closing the
  window, and a tawdry ornament of paper in the grate. I sit on a bed beside a
  weary-eyed, fair-haired, sturdy young woman, half undressed, who is telling
  me in broken German something that my knowledge of German is at first
  inadequate to understand...</p>

  <p>I thought she was boasting about her family, and then slowly the meaning
  came to me. She was a Lett from near Libau in Courland, and she was telling
  me&mdash;just as one tells something too strange for comment or
  emotion&mdash;how her father had been shot and her sister outraged and
  murdered before her eyes.</p>

  <p>It was as if one had dipped into something primordial and stupendous
  beneath the smooth and trivial surfaces of life. There was I, you know, the
  promising young don from Cambridge, who wrote quite brilliantly about
  politics and might presently get into Parliament, with my collar and tie in
  my hand, and a certain sense of shameful adventure fading out of my mind.</p>

  <p>"Ach Gott!" she sighed by way of comment, and mused deeply for a moment
  before she turned her face to me, as to something forgotten and remembered,
  and assumed the half-hearted meretricious smile.</p>

  <p>"Bin ich eine hubsche?" she asked like one who repeats a lesson.</p>

  <p>I was moved to crave her pardon and come away.</p>

  <p>"Bin ich eine hubsche?" she asked a little anxiously, laying a detaining
  hand upon me, and evidently not understanding a word of what I was striving
  to say.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 8</h3>

  <p class="first">I find it extraordinarily difficult to recall the phases by
  which I passed from my first admiration of Margaret's earnestness and
  unconscious daintiness to an intimate acquaintance. The earlier encounters
  stand out clear and hard, but then the impressions become crowded and mingle
  not only with each other but with all the subsequent developments of
  relationship, the enormous evolutions of interpretation and comprehension
  between husband and wife. Dipping into my memories is like dipping into a
  ragbag, one brings out this memory or that, with no intimation of how they
  came in time or what led to them and joined them together. And they are all
  mixed up with subsequent associations, with sympathies and discords, habits
  of intercourse, surprises and disappointments and discovered
  misunderstandings. I know only that always my feelings for Margaret were
  complicated feelings, woven of many and various strands.</p>

  <p>It is one of the curious neglected aspects of life how at the same time
  and in relation to the same reality we can have in our minds streams of
  thought at quite different levels. We can be at the same time idealising a
  person and seeing and criticising that person quite coldly and clearly, and
  we slip unconsciously from level to level and produce all sorts of
  inconsistent acts. In a sense I had no illusions about Margaret; in a sense
  my conception of Margaret was entirely poetic illusion. I don't think I was
  ever blind to certain defects of hers, and quite as certainly they didn't
  seem to matter in the slightest degree. Her mind had a curious want of
  vigour, "flatness" is the only word; she never seemed to escape from her
  phrase; her way of thinking, her way of doing was indecisive; she remained in
  her attitude, it did not flow out to easy, confirmatory action.</p>

  <p>I saw this quite clearly, and when we walked and talked together I seemed
  always trying for animation in her and never finding it. I would state my
  ideas. "I know," she would say, "I know."</p>

  <p>I talked about myself and she listened wonderfully, but she made no
  answering revelations. I talked politics, and she remarked with her blue eyes
  wide and earnest: "Every WORD you say seems so just."</p>

  <p>I admired her appearance tremendously but&mdash;I can only express it by
  saying I didn't want to touch her. Her fair hair was always delectably done.
  It flowed beautifully over her pretty small ears, and she would tie its fair
  coilings with fillets of black or blue velvet that carried pretty buckles of
  silver and paste. The light, the faint down on her brow and cheek was
  delightful. And it was clear to me that I made her happy.</p>

  <p>My sense of her deficiencies didn't stand in the way of my falling at last
  very deeply in love with her. Her very shortcomings seemed to offer me
  something...</p>

  <p>She stood in my mind for goodness&mdash;and for things from which it
  seemed to me my hold was slipping.</p>

  <p>She seemed to promise a way of escape from the deepening opposition in me
  between physical passions and the constructive career, the career of wide
  aims and human service, upon which I had embarked. All the time that I was
  seeing her as a beautiful, fragile, rather ineffective girl, I was also
  seeing her just as consciously as a shining slender figure, a radiant
  reconciliation, coming into my darkling disorders of lust and impulse. I
  could understand clearly that she was incapable of the most necessary
  subtleties of political thought, and yet I could contemplate praying to her
  and putting all the intricate troubles of my life at her feet.</p>

  <p>Before the reappearance of Margaret in my world at all an unwonted disgust
  with the consequences and quality of my passions had arisen in my mind. Among
  other things that moment with the Lettish girl haunted me persistently. I
  would see myself again and again sitting amidst those sluttish surroundings,
  collar and tie in hand, while her heavy German words grouped themselves to a
  slowly apprehended meaning. I would feel again with a fresh stab of remorse,
  that this was not a flash of adventure, this was not seeing life in any
  permissible sense, but a dip into tragedy, dishonour, hideous degradation,
  and the pitiless cruelty of a world as yet uncontrolled by any ordered
  will.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" I put it to myself, "that I should finish the work those
  Cossacks had begun! I who want order and justice before everything! There's
  no way out of it, no decent excuse! If I didn't think, I ought to have
  thought!"...</p>

  <p>"How did I get to it?" ... I would ransack the phases of my development
  from the first shy unveiling of a hidden wonder to the last extremity as a
  man will go through muddled account books to find some disorganising
  error...</p>

  <p>I was also involved at that time&mdash;I find it hard to place these
  things in the exact order of their dates because they were so disconnected
  with the regular progress of my work and life&mdash;in an intrigue, a clumsy,
  sensuous, pretentious, artificially stimulated intrigue, with a Mrs.
  Larrimer, a woman living separated from her husband. I will not go into
  particulars of that episode, nor how we quarrelled and chafed one another.
  She was at once unfaithful and jealous and full of whims about our meetings;
  she was careless of our secret, and vulgarised our relationship by
  intolerable interpretations; except for some glowing moments of
  gratification, except for the recurrent and essentially vicious desire that
  drew us back to each other again, we both fretted at a vexatious and
  unexpectedly binding intimacy. The interim was full of the quality of work
  delayed, of time and energy wasted, of insecure precautions against scandal
  and exposure. Disappointment is almost inherent in illicit love. I had, and
  perhaps it was part of her recurrent irritation also, a feeling as though one
  had followed something fine and beautiful into a net&mdash;into bird lime!
  These furtive scuffles, this sneaking into shabby houses of assignation, was
  what we had made out of the suggestion of pagan beauty; this was the reality
  of our vision of nymphs and satyrs dancing for the joy of life amidst
  incessant sunshine. We had laid hands upon the wonder and glory of bodily
  love and wasted them...</p>

  <p>It was the sense of waste, of finely beautiful possibilities getting
  entangled and marred for ever that oppressed me. I had missed, I had lost. I
  did not turn from these things after the fashion of the Baileys, as one turns
  from something low and embarrassing. I felt that these great organic forces
  were still to be wrought into a harmony with my constructive passion. I felt
  too that I was not doing it. I had not understood the forces in this struggle
  nor its nature, and as I learnt I failed. I had been started wrong, I had
  gone on wrong, in a world that was muddled and confused, full of false
  counsel and erratic shames and twisted temptations. I learnt to see it so by
  failures that were perhaps destroying any chance of profit in my lessons.
  Moods of clear keen industry alternated with moods of relapse and indulgence
  and moods of dubiety and remorse. I was not going on as the Baileys thought I
  was going on. There were times when the blindness of the Baileys irritated me
  intensely. Beneath the ostensible success of those years, between
  twenty-three and twenty-eight, this rottenness, known to scarcely any one but
  myself, grew and spread. My sense of the probability of a collapse
  intensified. I knew indeed now, even as Willersley had prophesied five years
  before, that I was entangling myself in something that might smother all my
  uses in the world. Down there among those incommunicable difficulties, I was
  puzzled and blundering. I was losing my hold upon things; the chaotic and
  adventurous element in life was spreading upward and getting the better of
  me, over-mastering me and all my will to rule and make... And the strength,
  the drugging urgency of the passion!</p>

  <p>Margaret shone at times in my imagination like a radiant angel in a world
  of mire and disorder, in a world of cravings, hot and dull red like scars
  inflamed...</p>

  <p>I suppose it was because I had so great a need of such help as her
  whiteness proffered, that I could ascribe impossible perfections to her, a
  power of intellect, a moral power and patience to which she, poor fellow
  mortal, had indeed no claim. If only a few of us <i>were</i> angels and freed
  from the tangle of effort, how easy life might be! I wanted her so badly, so
  very badly, to be what I needed. I wanted a woman to save me. I forced myself
  to see her as I wished to see her. Her tepidities became infinite delicacies,
  her mental vagueness an atmospheric realism. The harsh precisions of the
  Baileys and Altiora's blunt directness threw up her fineness into relief and
  made a grace of every weakness.</p>

  <p>Mixed up with the memory of times when I talked with Margaret as one talks
  politely to those who are hopelessly inferior in mental quality, explaining
  with a false lucidity, welcoming and encouraging the feeblest response, when
  possible moulding and directing, are times when I did indeed, as the old
  phrase goes, worship the ground she trod on. I was equally honest and
  unconscious of inconsistency at each extreme. But in neither phase could I
  find it easy to make love to Margaret. For in the first I did not want to,
  though I talked abundantly to her of marriage and so forth, and was a little
  puzzled at myself for not going on to some personal application, and in the
  second she seemed inaccessible, I felt I must make confessions and put things
  before her that would be the grossest outrage upon the noble purity I
  attributed to her.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 9</h3>

  <p class="first">I went to Margaret at last to ask her to marry me, wrought
  up to the mood of one who stakes his life on a cast. Separated from her, and
  with the resonance of an evening of angry recriminations with Mrs. Larrimer
  echoing in my mind, I discovered myself to be quite passionately in love with
  Margaret. Last shreds of doubt vanished. It has always been a feature of our
  relationship that Margaret absent means more to me than Margaret present; her
  memory distils from its dross and purifies in me. All my criticisms and
  qualifications of her vanished into some dark corner of my mind. She was the
  lady of my salvation; I must win my way to her or perish.</p>

  <p>I went to her at last, for all that I knew she loved me, in passionate
  self-abasement, white and a-tremble. She was staying with the Rockleys at
  Woking, for Shena Rockley had been at Bennett Hall with her and they had
  resumed a close intimacy; and I went down to her on an impulse, unheralded. I
  was kept waiting for some minutes, I remember, in a little room upon which a
  conservatory opened, a conservatory full of pots of large mauve-edged, white
  cyclamens in flower. And there was a big lacquer cabinet, a Chinese thing, I
  suppose, of black and gold against the red-toned wall. To this day the
  thought of Margaret is inseparably bound up with the sight of a cyclamen's
  back-turned petals.</p>

  <p>She came in, looking pale and drooping rather more than usual. I suddenly
  realised that Altiora's hint of a disappointment leading to positive illness
  was something more than a vindictive comment. She closed the door and came
  across to me and took and dropped my hand and stood still. "What is it you
  want with me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The speech I had been turning over and over in my mind on the way vanished
  at the sight of her.</p>

  <p>"I want to talk to you," I answered lamely.</p>

  <p>For some seconds neither of us said a word.</p>

  <p>"I want to tell you things about my life," I began.</p>

  <p>She answered with a scarcely audible "yes."</p>

  <p>"I almost asked you to marry me at Pangbourne," I plunged. "I didn't. I
  didn't because&mdash;because you had too much to give me."</p>

  <p>"Too much!" she echoed, "to give you!" She had lifted her eyes to my face
  and the colour was coming into her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Don't misunderstand me," I said hastily. "I want to tell you things,
  things you don't know. Don't answer me. I want to tell you."</p>

  <p>She stood before the fireplace with her ultimate answer shining through
  the quiet of her face. "Go on," she said, very softly. It was so pitilessly
  manifest she was resolved to idealise the situation whatever I might say. I
  began walking up and down the room between those cyclamens and the cabinet.
  There were little gold fishermen on the cabinet fishing from little islands
  that each had a pagoda and a tree, and there were also men in boats or
  something, I couldn't determine what, and some obscure sub-office in my mind
  concerned itself with that quite intently. Yet I seem to have been striving
  with all my being to get words for the truth of things. "You see," I emerged,
  "you make everything possible to me. You can give me help and sympathy,
  support, understanding. You know my political ambitions. You know all that I
  might do in the world. I do so intensely want to do constructive things, big
  things perhaps, in this wild jumble... Only you don't know a bit what I am. I
  want to tell you what I am. I'm complex... I'm streaked."</p>

  <p>I glanced at her, and she was regarding me with an expression of blissful
  disregard for any meaning I was seeking to convey.</p>

  <p>"You see," I said, "I'm a bad man."</p>

  <p>She sounded a note of valiant incredulity.</p>

  <p>Everything seemed to be slipping away from me. I pushed on to the ugly
  facts that remained over from the wreck of my interpretation. "What has held
  me back," I said, "is the thought that you could not possibly understand
  certain things in my life. Men are not pure as women are. I have had love
  affairs. I mean I have had affairs. Passion&mdash;desire. You see, I have had
  a mistress, I have been entangled&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She seemed about to speak, but I interrupted. "I'm not telling you," I
  said, "what I meant to tell you. I want you to know clearly that there is
  another side to my life, a dirty side. Deliberately I say, dirty. It didn't
  seem so at first&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I stopped blankly. "Dirty," I thought, was the most idiotic choice of
  words to have made.</p>

  <p>I had never in any tolerable sense of the word been dirty.</p>

  <p>"I drifted into this&mdash;as men do," I said after a little pause and
  stopped again.</p>

  <p>She was looking at me with her wide blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"Did you imagine," she began, "that I thought you&mdash;that I
  expected&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But how can you know?"</p>

  <p>"I know. I do know."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" I began.</p>

  <p>"I know," she persisted, dropping her eyelids. "Of course I know," and
  nothing could have convinced me more completely that she did not know.</p>

  <p>"All men&mdash;" she generalised. "A woman does not understand these
  temptations."</p>

  <p>I was astonished beyond measure at her way of taking my confession....</p>

  <p>"Of course," she said, hesitating a little over a transparent difficulty,
  "it is all over and past."</p>

  <p>"It's all over and past," I answered.</p>

  <p>There was a little pause.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to know," she said. "None of that seems to matter now in the
  slightest degree."</p>

  <p>She looked up and smiled as though we had exchanged some acceptable
  commonplaces. "Poor dear!" she said, dismissing everything, and put out her
  arms, and it seemed to me that I could hear the Lettish girl in the
  background&mdash;doomed safety valve of purity in this intolerable
  world&mdash;telling something in indistinguishable German&mdash;I know not
  what nor why...</p>

  <p>I took Margaret in my arms and kissed her. Her eyes were wet with tears.
  She clung to me and was near, I felt, to sobbing.</p>

  <p>"I have loved you," she whispered presently, "Oh! ever since we met in
  Misterton&mdash;six years and more ago."</p>

     name="chap2_03"></a>III. &mdash; MARGARET IN VENICE</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">There comes into my mind a confused memory of conversations
  with Margaret; we must have had dozens altogether, and they mix in now for
  the most part inextricably not only with one another, but with later talks
  and with things we discussed at Pangbourne. We had the immensest
  anticipations of the years and opportunities that lay before us. I was now
  very deeply in love with her indeed. I felt not that I had cleaned up my life
  but that she had. We called each other "confederate" I remember, and made
  during our brief engagement a series of visits to the various legislative
  bodies in London, the County Council, the House of Commons, where we dined
  with Villiers, and the St. Pancras Vestry, where we heard Shaw speaking. I
  was full of plans and so was she of the way in which we were to live and
  work. We were to pay back in public service whatever excess of wealth beyond
  his merits old Seddon's economic advantage had won for him from the toiling
  people in the potteries. The end of the Boer War was so recent that that
  blessed word "efficiency" echoed still in people's minds and thoughts. Lord
  Roseberry in a memorable oration had put it into the heads of the big outer
  public, but the Baileys with a certain show of justice claimed to have set it
  going in the channels that took it to him&mdash;if as a matter of fact it was
  taken to him. But then it was their habit to make claims of that sort. They
  certainly did their share to keep "efficient" going. Altiora's highest praise
  was "thoroughly efficient." We were to be a "thoroughly efficient" political
  couple of the "new type." She explained us to herself and Oscar, she
  explained us to ourselves, she explained us to the people who came to her
  dinners and afternoons until the world was highly charged with explanation
  and expectation, and the proposal that I should be the Liberal candidate for
  the Kinghamstead Division seemed the most natural development in the
  world.</p>

  <p>I was full of the ideal of hard restrained living and relentless activity,
  and throughout a beautiful November at Venice, where chiefly we spent our
  honeymoon, we turned over and over again and discussed in every aspect our
  conception of a life tremendously focussed upon the ideal of social
  service.</p>

  <p>Most clearly there stands out a picture of ourselves talking in a gondola
  on our way to Torcella. Far away behind us the smoke of Murano forms a black
  stain upon an immense shining prospect of smooth water, water as unruffled
  and luminous as the sky above, a mirror on which rows of posts and distant
  black high-stemmed, swan-necked boats with their minutely clear swinging
  gondoliers, float aerially. Remote and low before us rises the little tower
  of our destination. Our men swing together and their oars swirl leisurely
  through the water, hump back in the rowlocks, splash sharply and go swishing
  back again. Margaret lies back on cushions, with her face shaded by a holland
  parasol, and I sit up beside her.</p>

  <p>"You see," I say, and in spite of Margaret's note of perfect acquiescence
  I feel myself reasoning against an indefinable antagonism, "it is so easy to
  fall into a slack way with life. There may seem to be something priggish in a
  meticulous discipline, but otherwise it is so easy to slip into indolent
  habits&mdash;and to be distracted from one's purpose. The country, the world,
  wants men to serve its constructive needs, to work out and carry out plans.
  For a man who has to make a living the enemy is immediate necessity; for
  people like ourselves it's&mdash;it's the constant small opportunity of
  agreeable things."</p>

  <p>"Frittering away," she says, "time and strength."</p>

  <p>"That is what I feel. It's so pleasant to pretend one is simply modest, it
  looks so foolish at times to take one's self too seriously. We've <i>got</i>
  to take ourselves seriously."</p>

  <p>She endorses my words with her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I feel I can do great things with life."</p>

  <p>"I <i>know</i> you can."</p>

  <p>"But that's only to be done by concentrating one's life upon one main end.
  We have to plan our days, to make everything subserve our scheme."</p>

  <p>"I feel," she answers softly, "we ought to give&mdash;every hour."</p>

  <p>Her face becomes dreamy. "I <i>want</i> to give every hour," she
  adds.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">That holiday in Venice is set in my memory like a little
  artificial lake in uneven confused country, as something very bright and
  skylike, and discontinuous with all about it. The faded quality of the very
  sunshine of that season, the mellow discoloured palaces and places, the huge,
  time-ripened paintings of departed splendours, the whispering, nearly
  noiseless passage of hearse-black gondolas, for the horrible steam launch had
  not yet ruined Venice, the stilled magnificences of the depopulated lagoons,
  the universal autumn, made me feel altogether in recess from the teeming
  uproars of reality. There was not a dozen people all told, no Americans and
  scarcely any English, to dine in the big cavern of a dining-room, with its
  vistas of separate tables, its distempered walls and its swathed chandeliers.
  We went about seeing beautiful things, accepting beauty on every hand, and
  taking it for granted that all was well with ourselves and the world. It was
  ten days or a fortnight before I became fretful and anxious for action; a
  long tranquillity for such a temperament as mine.</p>

  <p>Our pleasures were curiously impersonal, a succession of shared aesthetic
  appreciation threads all that time. Our honeymoon was no exultant coming
  together, no mutual shout of "<i>You</i>!" We were almost shy with one
  another, and felt the relief of even a picture to help us out. It was
  entirely in my conception of things that I should be very watchful not to
  shock or distress Margaret or press the sensuous note. Our love-making had
  much of the tepid smoothness of the lagoons. We talked in delicate innuendo
  of what should be glorious freedoms. Margaret had missed Verona and Venice in
  her previous Italian journey&mdash;fear of the mosquito had driven her mother
  across Italy to the westward route&mdash;and now she could fill up her gaps
  and see the Titians and Paul Veroneses she already knew in colourless
  photographs, the Carpaccios, (the St. George series delighted her beyond
  measure,) the Basaitis and that great statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni that
  Ruskin praised.</p>

  <p>But since I am not a man to look at pictures and architectural effects day
  after day, I did watch Margaret very closely and store a thousand memories of
  her. I can see her now, her long body drooping a little forward, her sweet
  face upraised to some discovered familiar masterpiece and shining with a
  delicate enthusiasm. I can hear again the soft cadences of her voice
  murmuring commonplace comments, for she had no gift of expressing the
  shapeless satisfaction these things gave her.</p>

  <p>Margaret, I perceived, was a cultivated person, the first cultivated
  person with whom I had ever come into close contact. She was cultivated and
  moral, and I, I now realise, was never either of these things. She was
  passive, and I am active. She did not simply and naturally look for beauty
  but she had been incited to look for it at school, and took perhaps a keener
  interest in books and lectures and all the organisation of beautiful things
  than she did in beauty itself; she found much of her delight in being guided
  to it. Now a thing ceases to be beautiful to me when some finger points me
  out its merits. Beauty is the salt of life, but I take my beauty as a wild
  beast gets its salt, as a constituent of the meal...</p>

  <p>And besides, there was that between us that should have seemed more
  beautiful than any picture...</p>

  <p>So we went about Venice tracking down pictures and spiral staircases and
  such-like things, and my brains were busy all the time with such things as a
  comparison of Venice and its nearest modern equivalent, New York, with the
  elaboration of schemes of action when we returned to London, with the
  development of a theory of Margaret.</p>

  <p>Our marriage had done this much at least, that it had fused and destroyed
  those two independent ways of thinking about her that had gone on in my mind
  hitherto. Suddenly she had become very near to me, and a very big thing, a
  sort of comprehensive generalisation behind a thousand questions, like the
  sky or England. The judgments and understandings that had worked when she
  was, so to speak, miles away from my life, had now to be altogether revised.
  Trifling things began to matter enormously, that she had a weak and easily
  fatigued back, for example, or that when she knitted her brows and stammered
  a little in talking, it didn't really mean that an exquisite significance
  struggled for utterance.</p>

  <p>We visited pictures in the mornings chiefly. In the afternoon, unless we
  were making a day-long excursion in a gondola, Margaret would rest for an
  hour while I prowled about in search of English newspapers, and then we would
  go to tea in the Piazza San Marco and watch the drift of people feeding the
  pigeons and going into the little doors beneath the sunlit arches and domes
  of Saint Mark's. Then perhaps we would stroll on the Piazzetta, or go out
  into the sunset in a gondola. Margaret became very interested in the shops
  that abound under the colonnades and decided at last to make an extensive
  purchase of table glass. "These things," she said, "are quite beautiful, and
  far cheaper than anything but the most ordinary looking English ware." I was
  interested in her idea, and a good deal charmed by the delightful qualities
  of tinted shape, slender handle and twisted stem. I suggested we should get
  not simply tumblers and wineglasses but bedroom waterbottles, fruit- and
  sweet-dishes, water-jugs, and in the end we made quite a business-like
  afternoon of it.</p>

  <p>I was beginning now to long quite definitely for events. Energy was
  accumulating in me, and worrying me for an outlet. I found <i>The Times</i>
  and <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> and the other papers I managed to get hold of,
  more and more stimulating. I nearly wrote to the former paper one day in
  answer to a letter by Lord Grimthorpe&mdash;I forget now upon what point. I
  chafed secretly against this life of tranquil appreciations more and more. I
  found my attitudes of restrained and delicate affection for Margaret
  increasingly difficult to sustain. I surprised myself and her by little gusts
  of irritability, gusts like the catspaws before a gale. I was alarmed at
  these symptoms.</p>

  <p>One night when Margaret had gone up to her room, I put on a light
  overcoat, went out into the night and prowled for a long time through the
  narrow streets, smoking and thinking. I returned and went and sat on the edge
  of her bed to talk to her.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Margaret," I said; "this is all very well, but I'm
  restless."</p>

  <p>"Restless!" she said with a faint surprise in her voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I think I want exercise. I've got a sort of feeling&mdash;I've never
  had it before&mdash;as though I was getting fat."</p>

  <p>"My dear!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"I want to do things;&mdash;ride horses, climb mountains, take the devil
  out of myself."</p>

  <p>She watched me thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't we <i>do</i> something?" she said.</p>

  <p>Do what?</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Couldn't we perhaps go away from here soon&mdash;and walk
  in the mountains&mdash;on our way home."</p>

  <p>I thought. "There seems to be no exercise at all in this place."</p>

  <p>"Isn't there some walk?"</p>

  <p>"I wonder," I answered. "We might walk to Chioggia perhaps, along the
  Lido." And we tried that, but the long stretch of beach fatigued Margaret's
  back, and gave her blisters, and we never got beyond Malamocco...</p>

  <p>A day or so after we went out to those pleasant black-robed, bearded
  Armenians in their monastery at Saint Lazzaro, and returned towards sundown.
  We fell into silence. "<i>Più lento</i>," said Margaret to the gondolier, and
  released my accumulated resolution.</p>

  <p>"Let us go back to London," I said abruptly.</p>

  <p>Margaret looked at me with surprised blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"This is beautiful beyond measure, you know," I said, sticking to my
  point, "but I have work to do."</p>

  <p>She was silent for some seconds. "I had forgotten," she said.</p>

  <p>"So had I," I sympathised, and took her hand. "Suddenly I have
  remembered."</p>

  <p>She remained quite still. "There is so much to be done," I said, almost
  apologetically.</p>

  <p>She looked long away from me across the lagoon and at last sighed, like
  one who has drunk deeply, and turned to me.</p>

  <p>"I suppose one ought not to be so happy," she said. "Everything has been
  so beautiful and so simple and splendid. And clean. It has been just With You
  &mdash;the time of my life. It's a pity such things must end. But the world
  is calling you, dear... I ought not to have forgotten it. I thought you were
  resting&mdash;and thinking. But if you are rested. &mdash; Would you like us
  to start to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>She looked at once so fragile and so devoted that on the spur of the
  moment I relented, and we stayed in Venice four more days.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap2_04"
     name="chap2_04"></a>IV. &mdash; THE HOUSE IN WESTMINSTER</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">Margaret had already taken a little house in Radnor Square,
  Westminster, before our marriage, a house that seemed particularly adaptable
  to our needs as public-spirited efficients; it had been very pleasantly
  painted and papered under Margaret's instructions, white paint and clean open
  purples and green predominating, and now we set to work at once upon the
  interesting business of arranging and&mdash;with our Venetian glass as a
  beginning&mdash;furnishing it. We had been fairly fortunate with our wedding
  presents, and for the most part it was open to us to choose just exactly what
  we would have and just precisely where we would put it.</p>

  <p>Margaret had a sense of form and colour altogether superior to mine, and
  so quite apart from the fact that it was her money equipped us, I stood aside
  from all these matters and obeyed her summons to a consultation only to
  endorse her judgment very readily. Until everything was settled I went every
  day to my old rooms in Vincent Square and worked at a series of papers that
  were originally intended for <i>The Fortnightly Review</i>, the papers that
  afterwards became my fourth book, "New Aspects of Liberalism."</p>

  <p>I still remember as delightful most of the circumstances of getting into
  79, Radnor Square. The thin flavour of indecision about Margaret disappeared
  altogether in a shop; she had the precisest ideas of what she wanted, and the
  devices of the salesman did not sway her. It was very pleasant to find her
  taking things out of my hands with a certain masterfulness, and showing the
  distinctest determination to make a house in which I should be able to work
  in that great project of "doing something for the world."</p>

  <p>"And I do want to make things pretty about us," she said. "You don't think
  it wrong to have things pretty?"</p>

  <p>"I want them so."</p>

  <p>"Altiora has things hard."</p>

  <p>"Altiora," I answered, "takes a pride in standing ugly and uncomfortable
  things. But I don't see that they help her. Anyhow they won't help me."</p>

  <p>So Margaret went to the best shops and got everything very simple and very
  good. She bought some pictures very well indeed; there was a little Sussex
  landscape, full of wind and sunshine, by Nicholson, for my study, that hit my
  taste far better than if I had gone out to get some such expression for
  myself.</p>

  <p>"We will buy a picture just now and then," she said, "sometimes&mdash;when
  we see one."</p>

  <p>I would come back through the January mire or fog from Vincent Square to
  the door of 79, and reach it at last with a quite childish appreciation of
  the fact that its solid Georgian proportions and its fine brass furnishings
  belonged to <i>my</i> home; I would use my latchkey and discover Margaret in
  the warm-lit, spacious hall with a partially opened packing-case, fatigued
  but happy, or go up to have tea with her out of the right tea things, "come
  at last," or be told to notice what was fresh there. It wasn't simply that I
  had never had a house before, but I had really never been, except in the most
  transitory way, in any house that was nearly so delightful as mine promised
  to be. Everything was fresh and bright, and softly and harmoniously toned.
  Downstairs we had a green dining-room with gleaming silver, dark oak, and
  English colour-prints; above was a large drawing-room that could be made
  still larger by throwing open folding doors, and it was all carefully done in
  greys and blues, for the most part with real Sheraton supplemented by
  Sheraton so skilfully imitated by an expert Margaret had discovered as to be
  indistinguishable except to a minute scrutiny. And for me, above this and
  next to my bedroom, there was a roomy study, with specially thick
  stair-carpet outside and thick carpets in the bedroom overhead and a big old
  desk for me to sit at and work between fire and window, and another desk
  specially made for me by that expert if I chose to stand and write, and open
  bookshelves and bookcases and every sort of convenient fitting. There were
  electric heaters beside the open fire, and everything was put for me to make
  tea at any time&mdash;electric kettle, infuser, biscuits and fresh butter, so
  that I could get up and work at any hour of the day or night. I could do no
  work in this apartment for a long time, I was so interested in the perfection
  of its arrangements. And when I brought in my books and papers from Vincent
  Square, Margaret seized upon all the really shabby volumes and had them
  re-bound in a fine official-looking leather.</p>

  <p>I can remember sitting down at that desk and looking round me and feeling
  with a queer effect of surprise that after all even a place in the Cabinet,
  though infinitely remote, was nevertheless in the same large world with these
  fine and quietly expensive things.</p>

  <p>On the same floor Margaret had a "den," a very neat and pretty den with
  good colour-prints of Botticellis and Carpaccios, and there was a third
  apartment for sectarial purposes should the necessity for them arise, with a
  severe-looking desk equipped with patent files. And Margaret would come
  flitting into the room to me, or appear noiselessly standing, a tall
  gracefully drooping form, in the wide open doorway. "Is everything right,
  dear?" she would ask.</p>

  <p>"Come in," I would say, "I'm sorting out papers."</p>

  <p>She would come to the hearthrug.</p>

  <p>"I mustn't disturb you," she would remark.</p>

  <p>"I'm not busy yet."</p>

  <p>"Things are getting into order. Then we must make out a time-table as the
  Baileys do, and BEGIN!"</p>

  <p>Altiora came in to see us once or twice, and a number of serious young
  wives known to Altiora called and were shown over the house, and discussed
  its arrangements with Margaret. They were all tremendously keen on efficient
  arrangements.</p>

  <p>"A little pretty," said Altiora, with the faintest disapproval,
  "still&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was clear she thought we should grow out of that. From the day of our
  return we found other people's houses open to us and eager for us. We went
  out of London for week-ends and dined out, and began discussing our projects
  for reciprocating these hospitalities. As a single man unattached, I had had
  a wide and miscellaneous social range, but now I found myself falling into
  place in a set. For a time I acquiesced in this. I went very little to my
  clubs, the Climax and the National Liberal, and participated in no bachelor
  dinners at all. For a time, too, I dropped out of the garrulous literary and
  journalistic circles I had frequented. I put up for the Reform, not so much
  for the use of the club as a sign of serious and substantial political
  standing. I didn't go up to Cambridge, I remember, for nearly a year, so
  occupied was I with my new adjustments.</p>

  <p>The people we found ourselves among at this time were people, to put it
  roughly, of the Parliamentary candidate class, or people already actually
  placed in the political world. They ranged between very considerable wealth
  and such a hard, bare independence as old Willersley and the sister who kept
  house for him possessed. There were quite a number of young couples like
  ourselves, a little younger and more artless, or a little older and more
  established. Among the younger men I had a sort of distinction because of my
  Cambridge reputation and my writing, and because, unlike them, I was an
  adventurer and had won and married my way into their circles instead of being
  naturally there. They couldn't quite reckon upon what I should do; they felt
  I had reserves of experience and incalculable traditions. Close to us were
  the Cramptons, Willie Crampton, who has since been Postmaster-General, rich
  and very important in Rockshire, and his younger brother Edward, who has
  specialised in history and become one of those unimaginative men of letters
  who are the glory of latter-day England. Then there was Lewis, further
  towards Kensington, where his cousins the Solomons and the Hartsteins lived,
  a brilliant representative of his race, able, industrious and invariably
  uninspired, with a wife a little in revolt against the racial tradition of
  feminine servitude and inclined to the suffragette point of view, and Bunting
  Harblow, an old blue, and with an erratic disposition well under the control
  of the able little cousin he had married. I had known all these men, but now
  (with Altiora floating angelically in benediction) they opened their hearts
  to me and took me into their order. They were all like myself, prospective
  Liberal candidates, with a feeling that the period of wandering in the
  wilderness of opposition was drawing near its close. They were all
  tremendously keen upon social and political service, and all greatly under
  the sway of the ideal of a simple, strenuous life, a life finding its
  satisfactions in political achievements and distinctions. The young wives
  were as keen about it as the young husbands, Margaret most of all, and I
  &mdash;whatever elements in me didn't march with the attitudes and habits of
  this set were very much in the background during that time.</p>

  <p>We would give little dinners and have evening gatherings at which
  everything was very simple and very good, with a slight but perceptible
  austerity, and there was more good fruit and flowers and less perhaps in the
  way of savouries, patties and entrees than was customary. Sherry we banished,
  and Marsala and liqueurs, and there was always good home-made lemonade
  available. No men waited, but very expert parlourmaids. Our meat was usually
  Welsh mutton&mdash;I don't know why, unless that mountains have ever been the
  last refuge of the severer virtues. And we talked politics and books and
  ideas and Bernard Shaw (who was a department by himself and supposed in those
  days to be ethically sound at bottom), and mingled with the
  intellectuals&mdash;I myself was, as it were, a promoted intellectual.</p>

  <p>The Cramptons had a tendency to read good things aloud on their less
  frequented receptions, but I have never been able to participate submissively
  in this hyper-digestion of written matter, and generally managed to provoke a
  disruptive debate. We were all very earnest to make the most of ourselves and
  to be and do, and I wonder still at times, with an unassuaged perplexity, how
  it is that in that phase of utmost earnestness I have always seemed to myself
  to be most remote from reality.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">I look back now across the detaching intervention of sixteen
  crowded years, critically and I fancy almost impartially, to those beginnings
  of my married life. I try to recall something near to their proper order the
  developing phases of relationship. I am struck most of all by the immense
  unpremeditated, generous-spirited insincerities upon which Margaret and I
  were building.</p>

  <p>It seems to me that here I have to tell perhaps the commonest experience
  of all among married educated people, the deliberate, shy, complex effort to
  fill the yawning gaps in temperament as they appear, the sustained, failing
  attempt to bridge abysses, level barriers, evade violent pressures. I have
  come these latter years of my life to believe that it is possible for a man
  and woman to be absolutely real with one another, to stand naked souled to
  each other, unashamed and unafraid, because of the natural all-glorifying
  love between them. It is possible to love and be loved untroubling, as a bird
  flies through the air. But it is a rare and intricate chance that brings two
  people within sight of that essential union, and for the majority marriage
  must adjust itself on other terms. Most coupled people never really look at
  one another. They look a little away to preconceived ideas. And each from the
  first days of love-making HIDES from the other, is afraid of disappointing,
  afraid of offending, afraid of discoveries in either sense. They build not
  solidly upon the rock of truth, but upon arches and pillars and queer
  provisional supports that are needed to make a common foundation, and below
  in the imprisoned darknesses, below the fine fabric they sustain together
  begins for each of them a cavernous hidden life. Down there things may be
  prowling that scarce ever peep out to consciousness except in the grey
  half-light of sleepless nights, passions that flash out for an instant in an
  angry glance and are seen no more, starved victims and beautiful dreams
  bricked up to die. For the most of us there is no jail delivery of those
  inner depths, and the life above goes on to its honourable end.</p>

  <p>I have told how I loved Margaret and how I came to marry her. Perhaps
  already unintentionally I have indicated the quality of the injustice our
  marriage did us both. There was no kindred between us and no understanding.
  We were drawn to one another by the unlikeness of our quality, by the things
  we misunderstood in each other. I know a score of couples who have married in
  that fashion.</p>

  <p>Modern conditions and modern ideas, and in particular the intenser and
  subtler perceptions of modern life, press more and more heavily upon a
  marriage tie whose fashion comes from an earlier and less discriminating
  time. When the wife was her husband's subordinate, meeting him simply and
  uncritically for simple ends, when marriage was a purely domestic
  relationship, leaving thought and the vivid things of life almost entirely to
  the unencumbered man, mental and temperamental incompatibilities mattered
  comparatively little. But now the wife, and particularly the loving childless
  wife, unpremeditatedly makes a relentless demand for a complete association,
  and the husband exacts unthought of delicacies of understanding and
  co-operation. These are stupendous demands. People not only think more fully
  and elaborately about life than they ever did before, but marriage obliges us
  to make that ever more accidented progress a three-legged race of carelessly
  assorted couples...</p>

  <p>Our very mental texture was different. I was rough-minded, to use the
  phrase of William James, primary and intuitive and illogical; she was tender-
  minded, logical, refined and secondary. She was loyal to pledge and persons,
  sentimental and faithful; I am loyal to ideas and instincts, emotional and
  scheming. My imagination moves in broad gestures; her's was delicate with a
  real dread of extravagance. My quality is sensuous and ruled by warm
  impulses; hers was discriminating and essentially inhibitory. I like the
  facts of the case and to mention everything; I like naked bodies and the
  jolly smells of things. She abounded in reservations, in circumlocutions and
  evasions, in keenly appreciated secondary points. Perhaps the reader knows
  that Tintoretto in the National Gallery, the Origin of the Milky Way. It is
  an admirable test of temperamental quality. In spite of my early training I
  have come to regard that picture as altogether delightful; to Margaret it has
  always been "needlessly offensive." In that you have our fundamental breach.
  She had a habit, by no means rare, of damning what she did not like or find
  sympathetic in me on the score that it was not my "true self," and she did
  not so much accept the universe as select from it and do her best to ignore
  the rest. And also I had far more initiative than had she. This is no
  catalogue of rights and wrongs, or superiorities and inferiorities; it is a
  catalogue of differences between two people linked in a relationship that
  constantly becomes more intolerant of differences.</p>

  <p>This is how we stood to each other, and none of it was clear to either of
  us at the outset. To begin with, I found myself reserving myself from her,
  then slowly apprehending a jarring between our minds and what seemed to me at
  first a queer little habit of misunderstanding in her...</p>

  <p>It did not hinder my being very fond of her...</p>

  <p>Where our system of reservation became at once most usual and most
  astounding was in our personal relations. It is not too much to say that in
  that regard we never for a moment achieved sincerity with one another during
  the first six years of our life together. It goes even deeper than that, for
  in my effort to realise the ideal of my marriage I ceased even to attempt to
  be sincere with myself. I would not admit my own perceptions and
  interpretations. I tried to fit myself to her thinner and finer
  determinations. There are people who will say with a note of approval that I
  was learning to conquer myself. I record that much without any note of
  approval...</p>

  <p>For some years I never deceived Margaret about any concrete fact nor,
  except for the silence about my earlier life that she had almost forced upon
  me, did I hide any concrete fact that seemed to affect her, but from the
  outset I was guilty of immense spiritual concealments, my very marriage was
  based, I see now, on a spiritual subterfuge; I hid moods from her, pretended
  feelings...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">The interest and excitement of setting-up a house, of
  walking about it from room to room and from floor to floor, or sitting at
  one's own dinner table and watching one's wife control conversation with a
  pretty, timid resolution, of taking a place among the secure and free people
  of our world, passed almost insensibly into the interest and excitement of my
  Parliamentary candidature for the Kinghamstead Division, that shapeless chunk
  of agricultural midland between the Great Western and the North Western
  railways. I was going to "take hold" at last, the Kinghamstead Division was
  my appointed handle. I was to find my place in the rather indistinctly
  sketched constructions that were implicit in the minds of all our circle. The
  precise place I had to fill and the precise functions I had to discharge were
  not as yet very clear, but all that, we felt sure, would become plain as
  things developed.</p>

  <p>A few brief months of vague activities of "nursing" gave place to the
  excitements of the contest that followed the return of Mr. Camphell-Bannerman
  to power in 1905. So far as the Kinghamstead Division was concerned it was a
  depressed and tepid battle. I went about the constituency making three
  speeches that were soon threadbare, and an odd little collection of people
  worked for me; two solicitors, a cheap photographer, a democratic parson, a
  number of dissenting ministers, the Mayor of Kinghamstead, a Mrs. Bulger, the
  widow of an old Chartist who had grown rich through electric traction
  patents, Sir Roderick Newton, a Jew who had bought Calersham Castle, and old
  Sir Graham Rivers, that sturdy old soldier, were among my chief supporters.
  We had headquarters in each town and village, mostly there were empty shops
  we leased temporarily, and there at least a sort of fuss and a coming and
  going were maintained. The rest of the population stared in a state of
  suspended judgment as we went about the business. The country was supposed to
  be in a state of intellectual conflict and deliberate decision, in history it
  will no doubt figure as a momentous conflict. Yet except for an occasional
  flare of bill-sticking or a bill in a window or a placard-plastered motor-car
  or an argumentative group of people outside a public-house or a sluggish
  movement towards the schoolroom or village hall, there was scarcely a sign
  that a great empire was revising its destinies. Now and then one saw a
  canvasser on a doorstep. For the most part people went about their business
  with an entirely irresponsible confidence in the stability of the universe.
  At times one felt a little absurd with one's flutter of colours and one's air
  of saving the country.</p>

  <p>My opponent was a quite undistinguished Major-General who relied upon his
  advocacy of Protection, and was particularly anxious we should avoid
  "personalities" and fight the constituency in a gentlemanly spirit. He was
  always writing me notes, apologising for excesses on the part of his
  supporters, or pointing out the undesirability of some course taken by
  mine.</p>

  <p>My speeches had been planned upon broad lines, but they lost touch with
  these as the polling approached. To begin with I made a real attempt to put
  what was in my mind before the people I was to supply with a political voice.
  I spoke of the greatness of our empire and its destinies, of the splendid
  projects and possibilities of life and order that lay before the world, of
  all that a resolute and constructive effort might do at the present time. "We
  are building a state," I said, "secure and splendid, we are in the dawn of
  the great age of mankind." Sometimes that would get a solitary "'Ear! 'ear!"
  Then having created, as I imagined, a fine atmosphere, I turned upon the
  history of the last Conservative administration and brought it into contrast
  with the wide occasions of the age; discussed its failure to control the
  grasping financiers in South Africa, its failure to release public education
  from sectarian squabbles, its misconduct of the Boer War, its waste of the
  world's resources...</p>

  <p>It soon became manifest that my opening and my general spaciousness of
  method bored my audiences a good deal. The richer and wider my phrases the
  thinner sounded my voice in these non-resonating gatherings. Even the
  platform supporters grew restive unconsciously, and stirred and coughed. They
  did not recognise themselves as mankind. Building an empire, preparing a
  fresh stage in the history of humanity, had no appeal for them. They were
  mostly everyday, toiling people, full of small personal solicitudes, and they
  came to my meetings, I think, very largely as a relaxation. This stuff was
  not relaxing. They did not think politics was a great constructive process,
  they thought it was a kind of dog-fight. They wanted fun, they wanted spice,
  they wanted hits, they wanted also a chance to say "'Ear', 'ear!" in an
  intelligent and honourable manner and clap their hands and drum with their
  feet. The great constructive process in history gives so little scope for
  clapping and drumming and saying "'Ear, 'ear!" One might as well think of
  hounding on the solar system.</p>

  <p>So after one or two attempts to lift my audiences to the level of the
  issues involved, I began to adapt myself to them. I cut down my review of our
  imperial outlook and destinies more and more, and developed a series of hits
  and anecdotes and&mdash;what shall I call them?&mdash;"crudifications" of the
  issue. My helper's congratulated me on the rapid improvement of my platform
  style. I ceased to speak of the late Prime Minister with the respect I bore
  him, and began to fall in with the popular caricature of him as an artful
  rabbit-witted person intent only on keeping his leadership, in spite of the
  vigorous attempts of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain to oust him therefrom. I ceased
  to qualify my statement that Protection would make food dearer for the
  agricultural labourer. I began to speak of Mr. Alfred Lyttelton as an
  influence at once insane and diabolical, as a man inspired by a passionate
  desire to substitute manacled but still criminal Chinese for honest British
  labourers throughout the world. And when it came to the mention of our own
  kindly leader, of Mr. John Burns or any one else of any prominence at all on
  our side I fell more and more into the intonation of one who mentions the
  high gods. And I had my reward in brighter meetings and readier and readier
  applause.</p>

  <p>One goes on from phase to phase in these things.</p>

  <p>"After all," I told myself, "if one wants to get to Westminster one must
  follow the road that leads there," but I found the road nevertheless rather
  unexpectedly distasteful. "When one gets there," I said, "then it is one
  begins."</p>

  <p>But I would lie awake at nights with that sore throat and headache and
  fatigue which come from speaking in ill-ventilated rooms, and wondering how
  far it was possible to educate a whole people to great political ideals. Why
  should political work always rot down to personalities and personal appeals
  in this way? Life is, I suppose, to begin with and end with a matter of
  personalities, from personalities all our broader interests arise and to
  personalities they return. All our social and political effort, all of it, is
  like trying to make a crowd of people fall into formation. The broader lines
  appear, but then come a rush and excitement and irrelevancy, and forthwith
  the incipient order has vanished and the marshals must begin the work over
  again!</p>

  <p>My memory of all that time is essentially confusion. There was a frightful
  lot of tiresome locomotion in it; for the Kinghamstead Division is extensive,
  abounding in ill-graded and badly metalled cross-roads and vicious little
  hills, and singularly unpleasing to the eye in a muddy winter. It is
  sufficiently near to London to have undergone the same process of
  ill-regulated expansion that made Bromstead the place it is. Several of its
  overgrown villages have developed strings of factories and sidings along the
  railway lines, and there is an abundance of petty villas. There seemed to be
  no place at which one could take hold of more than this or that element of
  the population. Now we met in a meeting-house, now in a Masonic Hall or Drill
  Hall; I also did a certain amount of open-air speaking in the dinner hour
  outside gas-works and groups of factories. Some special sort of people was,
  as it were, secreted in response to each special appeal. One said things
  carefully adjusted to the distinctive limitations of each gathering. Jokes of
  an incredible silliness and shallowness drifted about us. Our advisers made
  us declare that if we were elected we would live in the district, and one
  hasty agent had bills printed, "If Mr. Remington is elected he will live
  here." The enemy obtained a number of these bills and stuck them on
  outhouses, pigstyes, dog-kennels; you cannot imagine how irksome the
  repetition of that jest became. The vast drifting indifference in between my
  meetings impressed me more and more. I realised the vagueness of my own plans
  as I had never done before I brought them to the test of this experience. I
  was perplexed by the riddle of just how far I was, in any sense of the word,
  taking hold at all, how far I wasn't myself flowing into an accepted
  groove.</p>

  <p>Margaret was troubled by no such doubts. She was clear I had to go into
  Parliament on the side of Liberalism and the light, as against the late
  Government and darkness. Essential to the memory of my first contest, is the
  memory of her clear bright face, very resolute and grave, helping me
  consciously, steadfastly, with all her strength. Her quiet confidence, while
  I was so dissatisfied, worked curiously towards the alienation of my
  sympathies. I felt she had no business to be so sure of me. I had moments of
  vivid resentment at being thus marched towards Parliament.</p>

  <p>I seemed now always to be discovering alien forces of character in her.
  Her way of taking life diverged from me more and more. She sounded amazing,
  independent notes. She bought some particularly costly furs for the campaign
  that roused enthusiasm whenever she appeared. She also made me a birthday
  present in November of a heavily fur-trimmed coat and this she would make me
  remove as I went on to the platform, and hold over her arm until I was ready
  to resume it. It was fearfully heavy for her and she liked it to be heavy for
  her. That act of servitude was in essence a towering self-assertion. I would
  glance sideways while some chairman floundered through his introduction and
  see the clear blue eye with which she regarded the audience, which existed so
  far as she was concerned merely to return me to Parliament. It was a friendly
  eye, provided they were not silly or troublesome. But it kindled a little at
  the hint of a hostile question. After we had come so far and taken so much
  trouble!</p>

  <p>She constituted herself the dragoman of our political travels. In hotels
  she was serenely resolute for the quietest and the best, she rejected all
  their proposals for meals and substituted a severely nourishing dietary of
  her own, and even in private houses she astonished me by her tranquil
  insistence upon special comforts and sustenance. I can see her face now as it
  would confront a hostess, a little intent, but sweetly resolute and
  assured.</p>

  <p>Since our marriage she had read a number of political memoirs, and she had
  been particularly impressed by the career of Mrs. Gladstone. I don't think it
  occurred to her to compare and contrast my quality with that of Mrs.
  Gladstone's husband. I suspect her of a deliberate intention of achieving
  parallel results by parallel methods. I was to be Gladstonised. Gladstone it
  appeared used to lubricate his speeches with a mixture&mdash;if my memory
  serves me right&mdash;of egg beaten up in sherry, and Margaret was very
  anxious I should take a leaf from that celebrated book. She wanted, I know,
  to hold the glass in her hand while I was speaking.</p>

  <p>But here I was firm. "No," I said, very decisively, "simply I won't stand
  that. It's a matter of conscience. I shouldn't feel&mdash;democratic. I'll
  take my chance of the common water in the carafe on the chairman's
  table."</p>

  <p>"I <i>do</i> wish you wouldn't," she said, distressed.</p>

  <p>It was absurd to feel irritated; it was so admirable of her, a little
  childish, infinitely womanly and devoted and fine&mdash;and I see now how
  pathetic. But I could not afford to succumb to her. I wanted to follow my own
  leading, to see things clearly, and this reassuring pose of a high destiny,
  of an almost terribly efficient pursuit of a fixed end when as a matter of
  fact I had a very doubtful end and an aim as yet by no means fixed, was all
  too seductive for dalliance...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">And into all these things with the manner of a trifling and
  casual incident comes the figure of Isabel Rivers. My first impressions of
  her were of a rather ugly and ungainly, extraordinarily interesting
  schoolgirl with a beautiful quick flush under her warm brown skin, who said
  and did amusing and surprising things. When first I saw her she was riding a
  very old bicycle downhill with her feet on the fork of the frame&mdash;it
  seemed to me to the public danger, but afterwards I came to understand the
  quality of her nerve better&mdash;and on the third occasion she was for her
  own private satisfaction climbing a tree. On the intervening occasion we had
  what seems now to have been a long sustained conversation about the political
  situation and the books and papers I had written.</p>

  <p>I wonder if it was.</p>

  <p>What a delightful mixture of child and grave woman she was at that time,
  and how little I reckoned on the part she would play in my life! And since
  she has played that part, how impossible it is to tell now of those early
  days! Since I wrote that opening paragraph to this section my idle pen has
  been, as it were, playing by itself and sketching faces on the blotting
  pad&mdash;one impish wizened visage is oddly like little Bailey&mdash;and I
  have been thinking cheek on fist amidst a limitless wealth of memories. She
  sits below me on the low wall under the olive trees with our little child in
  her arms. She is now the central fact in my life. It still seems a little
  incredible that that should be so. She has destroyed me as a politician,
  brought me to this belated rebeginning of life. When I sit down and try to
  make her a girl again, I feel like the Arabian fisherman who tried to put the
  genius back into the pot from which it had spread gigantic across the
  skies...</p>

  <p>I have a very clear vision of her rush downhill past our labouring
  ascendant car&mdash;my colours fluttered from handle-bar and shoulder-knot
  &mdash;and her waving hand and the sharp note of her voice. She cried out
  something, I don't know what, some greeting.</p>

  <p>"What a pretty girl!" said Margaret.</p>

  <p>Parvill, the cheap photographer, that industrious organiser for whom by
  way of repayment I got those magic letters, that knighthood of the
  underlings, "J. P." was in the car with us and explained her to us. "One of
  the best workers you have," he said...</p>

  <p>And then after a toilsome troubled morning we came, rather cross from the
  strain of sustained amiability, to Sir Graham Rivers' house. It seemed all
  softness and quiet&mdash;I recall dead white panelling and oval mirrors
  horizontally set and a marble fireplace between white marble-blind Homer and
  marble-blind Virgil, very grave and fine&mdash;and how Isabel came in to
  lunch in a shapeless thing like a blue smock that made her bright quick-
  changing face seem yellow under her cloud of black hair. Her step-sister was
  there, Miss Gamer, to whom the house was to descend, a well-dressed lady of
  thirty, amiably disavowing responsibility for Isabel in every phrase and
  gesture. And there was a very pleasant doctor, an Oxford man, who seemed on
  excellent terms with every one. It was manifest that he was in the habit of
  sparring with the girl, but on this occasion she wasn't sparring and refused
  to be teased into a display in spite of the taunts of either him or her
  father. She was, they discovered with rising eyebrows, shy. It seemed an
  opportunity too rare for them to miss. They proclaimed her enthusiasm for me
  in a way that brought a flush to her cheek and a look into her eye between
  appeal and defiance. They declared she had read my books, which I thought at
  the time was exaggeration, their dry political quality was so distinctly not
  what one was accustomed to regard as schoolgirl reading. Miss Gamer protested
  to protect her, "When once in a blue moon Isabel is well-behaved...!"</p>

  <p>Except for these attacks I do not remember much of the conversation at
  table; it was, I know, discursive and concerned with the sort of
  topographical and social and electioneering fact natural to such a visit. Old
  Rivers struck me as a delightful person, modestly unconscious of his
  doubly-earned V. C. and the plucky defence of Kardin-Bergat that won his
  baronetcy. He was that excellent type, the soldier radical, and we began that
  day a friendship that was only ended by his death in the hunting-field three
  years later. He interested Margaret into a disregard of my plate and the fact
  that I had secured the illegal indulgence of Moselle. After lunch we went for
  coffee into another low room, this time brown panelled and looking through
  French windows on a red-walled garden, graceful even in its winter
  desolation. And there the conversation suddenly picked up and became good. It
  had fallen to a pause, and the doctor, with an air of definitely throwing off
  a mask and wrecking an established tranquillity, remarked: "Very probably you
  Liberals will come in, though I'm not sure you'll come in so mightily as you
  think, but what you do when you do come in passes my comprehension."</p>

  <p>"There's good work sometimes," said Sir Graham, "in undoing."</p>

  <p>"You can't govern a great empire by amending and repealing the Acts of
  your predecessors," said the doctor.</p>

  <p>There came that kind of pause that happens when a subject is broached too
  big and difficult for the gathering. Margaret's blue eyes regarded the
  speaker with quiet disapproval for a moment, and then came to me in the not
  too confident hope that I would snub him out of existence with some prompt
  rhetorical stroke. A voice spoke out of the big armchair.</p>

  <p>"We'll do things," said Isabel.</p>

  <p>The doctor's eye lit with the joy of the fisherman who strikes his fish at
  last. "What will you do?" he asked her.</p>

  <p>"Every one knows we're a mixed lot," said Isabel.</p>

  <p>"Poor old chaps like me!" interjected the general.</p>

  <p>"But that's not a programme," said the doctor.</p>

  <p>"But Mr. Remington has published a programme," said Isabel.</p>

  <p>The doctor cocked half an eye at me.</p>

  <p>"In some review," the girl went on. "After all, we're not going to elect
  the whole Liberal party in the Kinghamstead Division. I'm a
  Remington-ite!"</p>

  <p>"But the programme," said the doctor, "the programme&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In front of Mr. Remington!"</p>

  <p>"Scandal always comes home at last," said the doctor. "Let him hear the
  worst."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to hear," I said. "Electioneering shatters convictions and
  enfeebles the mind."</p>

  <p>"Not mine," said Isabel stoutly. "I mean&mdash;Well, anyhow I take it Mr.
  Remington stands for constructing a civilised state out of this muddle."</p>

  <p>"THIS muddle," protested the doctor with an appeal of the eye to the
  beautiful long room and the ordered garden outside the bright clean
  windows.</p>

  <p>"Well, <i>that</i> muddle, if you like! There's a slum within a mile of us
  already. The dust and blacks get worse and worse, Sissie?"</p>

  <p>"They do," agreed Miss Gamer.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Remington stands for construction, order, education, discipline."</p>

  <p>"And you?" said the doctor.</p>

  <p>"I'm a good Remington-ite."</p>

  <p>"Discipline!" said the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Isabel. "At times one has to be&mdash;Napoleonic. They want to
  libel me, Mr. Remington. A political worker can't always be in time for
  meals, can she? At times one has to make&mdash;splendid cuts."</p>

  <p>Miss Gamer said something indistinctly.</p>

  <p>"Order, education, discipline," said Sir Graham. "Excellent things! But
  I've a sort of memory&mdash;in my young days&mdash;we talked about something
  called liberty."</p>

  <p>"Liberty under the law," I said, with an unexpected approving murmur from
  Margaret, and took up the defence. "The old Liberal definition of liberty was
  a trifle uncritical. Privilege and legal restrictions are not the only
  enemies of liberty. An uneducated, underbred, and underfed propertyless man
  is a man who has lost the possibility of liberty. There's no liberty worth a
  rap for him. A man who is swimming hopelessly for life wants nothing but the
  liberty to get out of the water; he'll give every other liberty for
  it&mdash;until he gets out."</p>

  <p>Sir Graham took me up and we fell into a discussion of the changing
  qualities of Liberalism. It was a good give-and-take talk, extraordinarily
  refreshing after the nonsense and crowding secondary issues of the
  electioneering outside. We all contributed more or less except Miss Gamer;
  Margaret followed with knitted brows and occasional interjections. "People
  won't SEE that," for example, and "It all seems so plain to me." The doctor
  showed himself clever but unsubstantial and inconsistent. Isabel sat back
  with her black mop of hair buried deep in the chair looking quickly from face
  to face. Her colour came and went with her vivid intellectual excitement;
  occasionally she would dart a word, usually a very apt word, like a lizard's
  tongue into the discussion. I remember chiefly that a chance illustration
  betrayed that she had read Bishop Burnet...</p>

  <p>After that it was not surprising that Isabel should ask for a lift in our
  car as far as the Lurky Committee Room, and that she should offer me quite
  sound advice EN ROUTE upon the intellectual temperament of the Lurky
  gasworkers.</p>

  <p>On the third occasion that I saw Isabel she was, as I have said, climbing
  a tree&mdash;and a very creditable tree&mdash;for her own private
  satisfaction. It was a lapse from the high seriousness of politics, and I
  perceived she felt that I might regard it as such and attach too much
  importance to it. I had some difficulty in reassuring her. And it's odd to
  note now&mdash;it has never occurred to me before&mdash;that from that day to
  this I do not think I have ever reminded Isabel of that encounter.</p>

  <p>And after that memory she seems to be flickering about always in the
  election, an inextinguishable flame; now she flew by on her bicycle, now she
  dashed into committee rooms, now she appeared on doorsteps in animated
  conversation with dubious voters; I took every chance I could to talk to her
  &mdash;I had never met anything like her before in the world, and she
  interested me immensely&mdash;and before the polling day she and I had
  become, in the frankest simplicity, fast friends...</p>

  <p>That, I think, sets out very fairly the facts of our early relationship.
  But it is hard to get it true, either in form or texture, because of the
  bright, translucent, coloured, and refracting memories that come between. One
  forgets not only the tint and quality of thoughts and impressions through
  that intervening haze, one forgets them altogether. I don't remember now that
  I ever thought in those days of passionate love or the possibility of such
  love between us. I may have done so again and again. But I doubt it very
  strongly. I don't think I ever thought of such aspects. I had no more sense
  of any danger between us, seeing the years and things that separated us, than
  I could have had if she had been an intelligent bright-eyed bird. Isabel came
  into my life as a new sort of thing; she didn't join on at all to my previous
  experiences of womanhood. They were not, as I have laboured to explain,
  either very wide or very penetrating experiences, on the whole, "strangled
  dinginess" expresses them, but I do not believe they were narrower or
  shallower than those of many other men of my class. I thought of women as
  pretty things and beautiful things, pretty rather than beautiful, attractive
  and at times disconcertingly attractive, often bright and witty, but, because
  of the vast reservations that hid them from me, wanting, subtly and
  inevitably wanting, in understanding. My idealisation of Margaret had
  evaporated insensibly after our marriage. The shrine I had made for her in my
  private thoughts stood at last undisguisedly empty. But Isabel did not for a
  moment admit of either idealisation or interested contempt. She opened a new
  sphere of womanhood to me. With her steady amber-brown eyes, her unaffected
  interest in impersonal things, her upstanding waistless blue body, her
  energy, decision and courage, she seemed rather some new and infinitely finer
  form of boyhood than a feminine creature, as I had come to measure
  femininity. She was my perfect friend. Could I have foreseen, had my world
  been more wisely planned, to this day we might have been such friends.</p>

  <p>She seemed at that time unconscious of sex, though she has told me since
  how full she was of protesting curiosities and restrained emotions. She
  spoke, as indeed she has always spoken, simply, clearly, and vividly;
  schoolgirl slang mingled with words that marked ample voracious reading, and
  she moved quickly with the free directness of some graceful young animal. She
  took many of the easy freedoms a man or a sister might have done with me. She
  would touch my arm, lay a hand on my shoulder as I sat, adjust the lapel of a
  breast-pocket as she talked to me. She says now she loved me always from the
  beginning. I doubt if there was a suspicion of that in her mind those days. I
  used to find her regarding me with the clearest, steadiest gaze in the world,
  exactly like the gaze of some nice healthy innocent animal in a forest,
  interested, inquiring, speculative, but singularly untroubled...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Polling day came after a last hoarse and dingy crescendo.
  The excitement was not of the sort that makes one forget one is tired out.
  The waiting for the end of the count has left a long blank mark on my memory,
  and then everyone was shaking my hand and repeating: "Nine hundred and
  seventy-six."</p>

  <p>My success had been a foregone conclusion since the afternoon, but we all
  behaved as though we had not been anticipating this result for hours, as
  though any other figures but nine hundred and seventy-six would have meant
  something entirely different. "Nine hundred and seventy-six!" said Margaret.
  "They didn't expect three hundred."</p>

  <p>"Nine hundred and seventy-six," said a little short man with a paper. "It
  means a big turnover. Two dozen short of a thousand, you know."</p>

  <p>A tremendous hullaboo began outside, and a lot of fresh people came into
  the room.</p>

  <p>Isabel, flushed but not out of breath, Heaven knows where she had sprung
  from at that time of night! was running her hand down my sleeve almost
  caressingly, with the innocent bold affection of a girl. "Got you in!" she
  said. "It's been no end of a lark."</p>

  <p>"And now," said I, "I must go and be constructive."</p>

  <p>"Now you must go and be constructive," she said.</p>

  <p>"You've got to live here," she added.</p>

  <p>"By Jove! yes," I said. "We'll have to house hunt."</p>

  <p>"I shall read all your speeches."</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I wish I was you," she said, and said it as though it was not exactly the
  thing she was meaning to say.</p>

  <p>"They want you to speak," said Margaret, with something unsaid in her
  face.</p>

  <p>"You must come out with me," I answered, putting my arm through hers, and
  felt someone urging me to the French windows that gave on the balcony.</p>

  <p>"If you think&mdash;" she said, yielding gladly</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>rather</i>!" said I.</p>

  <p>The Mayor of Kinghamstead, a managing little man with no great belief in
  my oratorical powers, was sticking his face up to mine.</p>

  <p>"It's all over," he said, "and you've won. Say all the nice things you can
  and say them plainly."</p>

  <p>I turned and handed Margaret out through the window and stood looking over
  the Market-place, which was more than half filled with swaying people. The
  crowd set up a roar of approval at the sight of us, tempered by a little
  booing. Down in one corner of the square a fight was going on for a flag, a
  fight that even the prospect of a speech could not instantly check. "Speech!"
  cried voices, "Speech!" and then a brief "boo-oo-oo" that was drowned in a
  cascade of shouts and cheers. The conflict round the flag culminated in the
  smashing of a pane of glass in the chemist's window and instantly sank to
  peace.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen voters of the Kinghamstead Division," I began.</p>

  <p>"Votes for Women!" yelled a voice, amidst laughter&mdash;the first time I
  remember hearing that memorable war-cry.</p>

  <p>"Three cheers for Mrs. Remington!"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Remington asks me to thank you," I said, amidst further uproar and
  reiterated cries of "Speech!"</p>

  <p>Then silence came with a startling swiftness.</p>

  <p>Isabel was still in my mind, I suppose. "I shall go to Westminster," I
  began. I sought for some compelling phrase and could not find one. "To do my
  share," I went on, "in building up a great and splendid civilisation."</p>

  <p>I paused, and there was a weak gust of cheering, and then a renewal of
  booing.</p>

  <p>"This election," I said, "has been the end and the beginning of much. New
  ideas are abroad&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Chinese labour," yelled a voice, and across the square swept a wildfire
  of booting and bawling.</p>

  <p>It is one of the few occasions when I quite lost my hold on a speech. I
  glanced sideways and saw the Mayor of Kinghamstead speaking behind his hand
  to Parvill. By a happy chance Parvill caught my eye.</p>

  <p>"What do they want?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"What do they want?"</p>

  <p>"Say something about general fairness&mdash;the other side," prompted
  Parvill, flattered but a little surprised by my appeal. I pulled myself
  hastily into a more popular strain with a gross eulogy of my opponent's good
  taste.</p>

  <p>"Chinese labour!" cried the voice again.</p>

  <p>"You've given that notice to quit," I answered.</p>

  <p>The Market-place roared delight, but whether that delight expressed
  hostility to Chinamen or hostility to their practical enslavement no student
  of the General Election of 1906 has ever been able to determine. Certainly
  one of the most effective posters on our side displayed a hideous yellow
  face, just that and nothing more. There was not even a legend to it. How it
  impressed the electorate we did not know, but that it impressed the
  electorate profoundly there can be no disputing.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">Kinghamstead was one of the earliest constituencies fought,
  and we came back&mdash;it must have been Saturday&mdash;triumphant but very
  tired, to our house in Radnor Square. In the train we read the first
  intimations that the victory of our party was likely to be a sweeping
  one.</p>

  <p>Then came a period when one was going about receiving and giving
  congratulations and watching the other men arrive, very like a boy who has
  returned to school with the first batch after the holidays. The London world
  reeked with the General Election; it had invaded the nurseries. All the
  children of one's friends had got big maps of England cut up into squares to
  represent constituencies and were busy sticking gummed blue labels over the
  conquered red of Unionism that had hitherto submerged the country. And there
  were also orange labels, if I remember rightly, to represent the new Labour
  party, and green for the Irish. I engaged myself to speak at one or two
  London meetings, and lunched at the Reform, which was fairly tepid, and dined
  and spent one or two tumultuous evenings at the National Liberal Club, which
  was in active eruption. The National Liberal became feverishly congested
  towards midnight as the results of the counting came dropping in. A big
  green-baize screen had been fixed up at one end of the large smoking-room
  with the names of the constituencies that were voting that day, and directly
  the figures came to hand, up they went, amidst cheers that at last lost their
  energy through sheer repetition, whenever there was record of a Liberal gain.
  I don't remember what happened when there was a Liberal loss; I don't think
  that any were announced while I was there.</p>

  <p>How packed and noisy the place was, and what a reek of tobacco and whisky
  fumes we made! Everybody was excited and talking, making waves of harsh
  confused sound that beat upon one's ears, and every now and then hoarse
  voices would shout for someone to speak. Our little set was much in evidence.
  Both the Cramptons were in, Lewis, Bunting Harblow. We gave brief addresses
  attuned to this excitement and the late hour, amidst much enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"Now we can <i>do</i> things!" I said amidst a rapture of applause. Men I
  did not know from Adam held up glasses and nodded to me in solemn fuddled
  approval as I came down past them into the crowd again.</p>

  <p>Men were betting whether the Unionists would lose more or less than two
  hundred seats.</p>

  <p>"I wonder just what we shall do with it all," I heard one sceptic
  speculating...</p>

  <p>After these orgies I would get home very tired and excited, and find it
  difficult to get to sleep. I would lie and speculate about what it was we
  <i>were</i> going to do. One hadn't anticipated quite such a tremendous
  accession to power for one's party. Liberalism was swirling in like a
  flood...</p>

  <p>I found the next few weeks very unsatisfactory and distressing. I don't
  clearly remember what it was I had expected; I suppose the fuss and strain of
  the General Election had built up a feeling that my return would in some way
  put power into my hands, and instead I found myself a mere undistinguished
  unit in a vast but rather vague majority. There were moments when I felt very
  distinctly that a majority could be too big a crowd altogether. I had all my
  work still before me, I had achieved nothing as yet but opportunity, and a
  very crowded opportunity it was at that. Everyone about me was chatting
  Parliament and appointments; one breathed distracting and irritating
  speculations as to what would be done and who would be asked to do it. I was
  chiefly impressed by what was unlikely to be done and by the absence of any
  general plan of legislation to hold us all together. I found the talk about
  Parliamentary procedure and etiquette particularly trying. We dined with the
  elder Cramptons one evening, and old Sir Edward was lengthily sage about what
  the House liked, what it didn't like, what made a good impression and what a
  bad one. "A man shouldn't speak more than twice in his first session, and not
  at first on too contentious a topic," said Sir Edward. "No."</p>

  <p>"Very much depends on manner. The House hates a lecturer. There's a sort
  of airy earnestness&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He waved his cigar to eke out his words.</p>

  <p>"Little peculiarities of costume count for a great deal. I could name one
  man who spent three years living down a pair of spatterdashers. On the other
  hand&mdash;a thing like that&mdash;if it catches the eye of the <i>Punch</i>
  man, for example, may be your making."</p>

  <p>He went off into a lengthy speculation of why the House had come to like
  an originally unpopular Irishman named Biggar...</p>

  <p>The opening of Parliament gave me some peculiar moods. I began to feel
  more and more like a branded sheep. We were sworn in in batches, dozens and
  scores of fresh men, trying not to look too fresh under the inspection of
  policemen and messengers, all of us carrying new silk hats and wearing
  magisterial coats. It is one of my vivid memories from this period, the
  sudden outbreak of silk hats in the smoking-room of the National Liberal
  Club. At first I thought there must have been a funeral. Familiar faces that
  one had grown to know under soft felt hats, under bowlers, under liberal-
  minded wide brims, and above artistic ties and tweed jackets, suddenly met
  one, staring with the stern gaze of self-consciousness, from under silk hats
  of incredible glossiness. There was a disposition to wear the hat much too
  forward, I thought, for a good Parliamentary style.</p>

  <p>There was much play with the hats all through; a tremendous competition to
  get in first and put hats on coveted seats. A memory hangs about me of the
  House in the early afternoon, an inhumane desolation inhabited almost
  entirely by silk hats. The current use of cards to secure seats came later.
  There were yards and yards of empty green benches with hats and hats and hats
  distributed along them, resolute-looking top hats, lax top hats with a kind
  of shadowy grin under them, sensible top bats brim upward, and one scandalous
  incontinent that had rolled from the front Opposition bench right to the
  middle of the floor. A headless hat is surely the most soulless thing in the
  world, far worse even than a skull...</p>

  <p>At last, in a leisurely muddled manner we got to the Address; and I found
  myself packed in a dense elbowing crowd to the right of the Speaker's chair;
  while the attenuated Opposition, nearly leaderless after the massacre, tilted
  its brim to its nose and sprawled at its ease amidst its empty benches.</p>

  <p>There was a tremendous hullaboo about something, and I craned to see over
  the shoulder of the man in front. "Order, order, order!"</p>

  <p>"What's it about?" I asked.</p>

  <p>The man in front of me was clearly no better informed, and then I gathered
  from a slightly contemptuous Scotchman beside me that it was Chris Robinson
  had walked between the honourable member in possession of the house and the
  Speaker. I caught a glimpse of him blushingly whispering about his
  misadventure to a colleague. He was just that same little figure I had once
  assisted to entertain at Cambridge, but grey-haired now, and still it seemed
  with the same knitted muffler he had discarded for a reckless half-hour while
  he talked to us in Hatherleigh's rooms.</p>

  <p>It dawned upon me that I wasn't particularly wanted in the House, and that
  I should get all I needed of the opening speeches next day from <i>The
  Times</i>.</p>

  <p>I made my way out and was presently walking rather aimlessly through the
  outer lobby.</p>

  <p>I caught myself regarding the shadow that spread itself out before me,
  multiplied itself in blue tints of various intensity, shuffled itself like a
  pack of cards under the many lights, the square shoulders, the silk hat,
  already worn with a parliamentary tilt backward; I found I was surveying this
  statesmanlike outline with a weak approval. "A MEMBER!" I felt the little
  cluster of people that were scattered about the lobby must be saying.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" I said in hot reaction, "what am I doing here?"</p>

  <p>It was one of those moments infinitely trivial in themselves, that yet are
  cardinal in a man's life. It came to me with extreme vividness that it wasn't
  so much that I had got hold of something as that something had got hold of
  me. I distinctly recall the rebound of my mind. Whatever happened in this
  Parliament, I at least would attempt something. "By God!" I said, "I won't be
  overwhelmed. I am here to do something, and do something I will!"</p>

  <p>But I felt that for the moment I could not remain in the House.</p>

  <p>I went out by myself with my thoughts into the night. It was a chilling
  night, and rare spots of rain were falling. I glanced over my shoulder at the
  lit windows of the Lords. I walked, I remember, westward, and presently came
  to the Grosvenar Embankment and followed it, watching the glittering black
  rush of the river and the dark, dimly lit barges round which the water
  swirled. Across the river was the hunched sky-line of Doulton's potteries,
  and a kiln flared redly. Dimly luminous trams were gliding amidst a dotted
  line of lamps, and two little trains crawled into Waterloo station.
  Mysterious black figures came by me and were suddenly changed to the
  commonplace at the touch of the nearer lamps. It was a big confused world, I
  felt, for a man to lay his hands upon.</p>

  <p>I remember I crossed Vauxhall Bridge and stood for a time watching the
  huge black shapes in the darkness under the gas-works. A shoal of coal barges
  lay indistinctly on the darkly shining mud and water below, and a colossal
  crane was perpetually hauling up coal into mysterious blacknesses above, and
  dropping the empty clutch back to the barges. Just one or two minute black
  featureless figures of men toiled amidst these monster shapes. They did not
  seem to be controlling them but only moving about among them. These gas-works
  have a big chimney that belches a lurid flame into the night, a livid
  shivering bluish flame, shot with strange crimson streaks...</p>

  <p>On the other side of Lambeth Bridge broad stairs go down to the lapping
  water of the river; the lower steps are luminous under the lamps and one
  treads unwarned into thick soft Thames mud. They seem to be purely
  architectural steps, they lead nowhere, they have an air of absolute
  indifference to mortal ends.</p>

  <p>Those shapes and large inhuman places&mdash;for all of mankind that one
  sees at night about Lambeth is minute and pitiful beside the industrial
  monsters that snort and toil there&mdash;mix up inextricably with my memories
  of my first days as a legislator. Black figures drift by me, heavy vans
  clatter, a newspaper rough tears by on a motor bicycle, and presently, on the
  Albert Embankment, every seat has its one or two outcasts huddled together
  and slumbering.</p>

  <p>"These things come, these things go," a whispering voice urged upon me,
  "as once those vast unmeaning Saurians whose bones encumber museums came and
  went rejoicing noisily in fruitless lives."...</p>

  <p>Fruitless lives!&mdash;was that the truth of it all?...</p>

  <p>Later I stood within sight of the Houses of Parliament in front of the
  colonnades of St Thomas's Hospital. I leant on the parapet close by a lamp-
  stand of twisted dolphins&mdash;and I prayed!</p>

  <p>I remember the swirl of the tide upon the water, and how a string of
  barges presently came swinging and bumping round as high-water turned to ebb.
  That sudden change of position and my brief perplexity at it, sticks like a
  paper pin through the substance of my thoughts. It was then I was moved to
  prayer. I prayed that night that life might not be in vain, that in
  particular I might not live in vain. I prayed for strength and faith, that
  the monstrous blundering forces in life might not overwhelm me, might not
  beat me back to futility and a meaningless acquiescence in existent things. I
  knew myself for the weakling I was, I knew that nevertheless it was set for
  me to make such order as I could out of these disorders, and my task cowed
  me, gave me at the thought of it a sense of yielding feebleness.</p>

  <p>"Break me, O God," I prayed at last, "disgrace me, torment me, destroy me
  as you will, but save me from self-complacency and little interests and
  little successes and the life that passes like the shadow of a dream."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap3_01"
     name="chap3_01"></a>I. &mdash; THE RIDDLE FOR THE STATESMAN</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">I have been planning and replanning, writing and rewriting,
  this next portion of my book for many days. I perceive I must leave it raw
  edged and ill joined. I have learnt something of the impossibility of
  History. For all I have had to tell is the story of one man's convictions and
  aims and how they reacted upon his life; and I find it too subtle and
  involved and intricate for the doing. I find it taxes all my powers to convey
  even the main forms and forces in that development. It is like looking
  through moving media of changing hue and variable refraction at something
  vitally unstable. Broad theories and generalisations are mingled with
  personal influences, with prevalent prejudices; and not only coloured but
  altered by phases of hopefulness and moods of depression. The web is made up
  of the most diverse elements, beyond treatment multitudinous... For a week or
  so I desisted altogether, and walked over the mountains and returned to sit
  through the warm soft mornings among the shaded rocks above this little
  perched-up house of ours, discussing my difficulties with Isabel and I think
  on the whole complicating them further in the effort to simplify them to
  manageable and stateable elements.</p>

  <p>Let me, nevertheless, attempt a rough preliminary analysis of this
  confused process. A main strand is quite easily traceable. This main strand
  is the story of my obvious life, my life as it must have looked to most of my
  acquaintances. It presents you with a young couple, bright, hopeful, and
  energetic, starting out under Altiora's auspices to make a career. You figure
  us well dressed and active, running about in motor-cars, visiting in great
  people's houses, dining amidst brilliant companies, going to the theatre,
  meeting in the lobby. Margaret wore hundreds of beautiful dresses. We must
  have had an air of succeeding meritoriously during that time.</p>

  <p>We did very continually and faithfully serve our joint career. I thought
  about it a great deal, and did and refrained from doing ten thousand things
  for the sake of it. I kept up a solicitude for it, as it were by inertia,
  long after things had happened and changes occurred in me that rendered its
  completion impossible. Under certain very artless pretences, we wanted
  steadfastly to make a handsome position in the world, achieve respect,
  <i>succeed</i>. Enormous unseen changes had been in progress for years in my
  mind and the realities of my life, before our general circle could have had
  any inkling of their existence, or suspected the appearances of our life.
  Then suddenly our proceedings began to be deflected, our outward unanimity
  visibly strained and marred by the insurgence of these so long-hidden
  developments.</p>

  <p>That career had its own hidden side, of course; but when I write of these
  unseen factors I do not mean that but something altogether broader. I do not
  mean the everyday pettinesses which gave the cynical observer scope and told
  of a narrower, baser aspect of the fair but limited ambitions of my
  ostensible self. This "sub-careerist" element noted little things that
  affected the career, made me suspicious of the rivalry of so-and-so,
  propitiatory to so-and-so, whom, as a matter of fact, I didn't respect or
  feel in the least sympathetic towards; guarded with that man, who for all his
  charm and interest wasn't helpful, and a little touchy at the appearance of
  neglect from that. No, I mean something greater and not something smaller
  when I write of a hidden life.</p>

  <p>In the ostensible self who glowed under the approbation of Altiora Bailey,
  and was envied and discussed, praised and depreciated, in the House and in
  smoking-room gossip, you really have as much of a man as usually figures in a
  novel or an obituary notice. But I am tremendously impressed now in the
  retrospect by the realisation of how little that frontage represented me, and
  just how little such frontages do represent the complexities of the
  intelligent contemporary. Behind it, yet struggling to disorganise and alter
  it, altogether, was a far more essential reality, a self less personal, less
  individualised, and broader in its references. Its aims were never simply to
  get on; it had an altogether different system of demands and satisfactions.
  It was critical, curious, more than a little unfeeling&mdash;and relentlessly
  illuminating.</p>

  <p>It is just the existence and development of this more generalised self-
  behind-the-frontage that is making modern life so much more subtle and
  intricate to render, and so much more hopeful in its relations to the
  perplexities of the universe. I see this mental and spiritual hinterland vary
  enormously in the people about me, from a type which seems to keep, as people
  say, all its goods in the window, to others who, like myself, come to regard
  the ostensible existence more and more as a mere experimental feeder and
  agent for that greater personality behind. And this back-self has its history
  of phases, its crises and happy accidents and irrevocable conclusions, more
  or less distinct from the adventures and achievements of the ostensible self.
  It meets persons and phrases, it assimilates the spirit of a book, it is
  startled into new realisations by some accident that seems altogether
  irrelevant to the general tenor of one's life. Its increasing independence of
  the ostensible career makes it the organ of corrective criticism; it
  accumulates disturbing energy. Then it breaks our overt promises and
  repudiates our pledges, coming down at last like an overbearing mentor upon
  the small engagements of the pupil.</p>

  <p>In the life of the individual it takes the role that the growth of
  philosophy, science, and creative literature may play in the development of
  mankind.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">It is curious to recall how Britten helped shatter that
  obvious, lucidly explicable presentation of myself upon which I had embarked
  with Margaret. He returned to revive a memory of adolescent dreams and a
  habit of adolescent frankness; he reached through my shallow frontage as no
  one else seemed capable of doing, and dragged that back-self into relation
  with it.</p>

  <p>I remember very distinctly a dinner and a subsequent walk with him which
  presents itself now as altogether typical of the quality of his
  influence.</p>

  <p>I had come upon him one day while lunching with Somers and Sutton at the
  Playwrights' Club, and had asked him to dinner on the spur of the moment. He
  was oddly the same curly-headed, red-faced ventriloquist, and oddly
  different, rather seedy as well as untidy, and at first a little inclined to
  make comparisons with my sleek successfulness. But that disposition presently
  evaporated, and his talk was good and fresh and provocative. And something
  that had long been straining at its checks in my mind flapped over, and he
  and I found ourselves of one accord.</p>

  <p>Altiora wasn't at this dinner. When she came matters were apt to become
  confusedly strenuous. There was always a slight and ineffectual struggle at
  the end on the part of Margaret to anticipate Altiora's overpowering tendency
  to a rally and the establishment of some entirely unjustifiable conclusion by
  a <i>coup-de-main</i>. When, however, Altiora was absent, the quieter
  influence of the Cramptons prevailed; temperance and information for its own
  sake prevailed excessively over dinner and the play of thought... Good Lord!
  what bores the Cramptons were! I wonder I endured them as I did. They had all
  of them the trick of lying in wait conversationally; they had no sense of the
  self-exposures, the gallant experiments in statement that are necessary for
  good conversation. They would watch one talking with an expression exactly
  like peeping through bushes. Then they would, as it were, dash out, dissent
  succinctly, contradict some secondary fact, and back to cover. They gave one
  twilight nerves. Their wives were easier but still difficult at a stretch;
  they talked a good deal about children and servants, but with an air caught
  from Altiora of making observations upon sociological types. Lewis gossiped
  about the House in an entirely finite manner. He never raised a discussion;
  nobody ever raised a discussion. He would ask what we thought of Evesham's
  question that afternoon, and Edward would say it was good, and Mrs. Willie,
  who had been behind the grille, would think it was very good, and then
  Willie, parting the branches, would say rather conclusively that he didn't
  think it was very much good, and I would deny hearing the question in order
  to evade a profitless statement of views in that vacuum, and then we would
  cast about in our minds for some other topic of equal interest...</p>

  <p>On this occasion Altiora was absent, and to qualify our Young Liberal
  bleakness we had Mrs. Millingham, with her white hair and her fresh mind and
  complexion, and Esmeer. Willie Crampton was with us, but not his wife, who
  was having her third baby on principle; his brother Edward was present, and
  the Lewises, and of course the Bunting Harblows. There was also some other
  lady. I remember her as pale blue, but for the life of me I cannot remember
  her name.</p>

  <p>Quite early there was a little breeze between Edward Crampton and Esmeer,
  who had ventured an opinion about the partition of Poland. Edward was at work
  then upon the seventh volume of his monumental Life of Kosciusko, and a
  little impatient with views perhaps not altogether false but betraying a
  lamentable ignorance of accessible literature. At any rate, his correction of
  Esmeer was magisterial. After that there was a distinct and not altogether
  delightful pause, and then some one, it may have been the pale-blue lady,
  asked Mrs. Lewis whether her aunt Lady Carmixter had returned from her rest-
  and-sun-cure in Italy. That led to a rather anxiously sustained talk about
  regimen, and Willie told us how he had profited by the no-breakfast system.
  It had increased his power of work enormously. He could get through ten hours
  a day now without inconvenience.</p>

  <p>"What do you do?" said Esmeer abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Oh! no end of work. There's all the estate and looking after things."</p>

  <p>"But publicly?"</p>

  <p>"I asked three questions yesterday. And for one of them I had to consult
  nine books!"</p>

  <p>We were drifting, I could see, towards Doctor Haig's system of dietary,
  and whether the exclusion or inclusion of fish and chicken were most
  conducive to high efficiency, when Britten, who had refused lemonade and
  claret and demanded Burgundy, broke out, and was discovered to be demanding
  in his throat just what we Young Liberals thought we were up to?</p>

  <p>"I want," said Britten, repeating his challenge a little louder, "to hear
  just exactly what you think you are doing in Parliament?"</p>

  <p>Lewis laughed nervously, and thought we were "Seeking the Good of the
  Community."</p>

  <p>"HOW?"</p>

  <p>"Beneficient Legislation," said Lewis.</p>

  <p>"Beneficient in what direction?" insisted Britten. "I want to know where
  you think you are going."</p>

  <p>"Amelioration of Social Conditions," said Lewis.</p>

  <p>"That's only a phrase!"</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't have me sketch bills at dinner?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like you to indicate directions," said Britten, and waited.</p>

  <p>"Upward and On," said Lewis with conscious neatness, and turned to ask
  Mrs. Bunting Harblow about her little boy's French.</p>

  <p>For a time talk frothed over Britten's head, but the natural mischief in
  Mrs. Millingham had been stirred, and she was presently echoing his demand in
  lisping, quasi-confidential undertones. "What <i>are</i> we Liberals doing?"
  Then Esmeer fell in with the revolutionaries.</p>

  <p>To begin with, I was a little shocked by this clamour for fundamentals
  &mdash;and a little disconcerted. I had the experience that I suppose comes
  to every one at times of discovering oneself together with two different sets
  of people with whom one has maintained two different sets of attitudes. It
  had always been, I perceived, an instinctive suppression in our circle that
  we shouldn't be more than vague about our political ideals. It had almost
  become part of my morality to respect this convention. It was understood we
  were all working hard, and keeping ourselves fit, tremendously fit, under
  Altiora's inspiration, Pro Bono Publico. Bunting Harblow had his
  under-secretaryship, and Lewis was on the verge of the Cabinet, and these
  things we considered to be in the nature of confirmations... It added to the
  discomfort of the situation that these plunging enquiries were being made in
  the presence of our wives.</p>

  <p>The rebel section of our party forced the talk.</p>

  <p>Edward Crampton was presently declaring&mdash;I forget in what relation:
  "The country is with us."</p>

  <p>My long-controlled hatred of the Cramptons' stereotyped phrases about the
  Country and the House got the better of me. I showed my cloven hoof to my
  friends for the first time.</p>

  <p>"We don't respect the Country as we used to do," I said. "We haven't the
  same belief we used to have in the will of the people. It's no good,
  Crampton, trying to keep that up. We Liberals know as a matter of
  fact&mdash;nowadays every one knows&mdash;that the monster that brought us
  into power has, among other deficiencies, no head. We've got to give it
  one&mdash;if possible with brains and a will. That lies in the future. For
  the present if the country is with us, it means merely that we happen to have
  hold of its tether."</p>

  <p>Lewis was shocked. A "mandate" from the Country was sacred to his system
  of pretences.</p>

  <p>Britten wasn't subdued by his first rebuff; presently he was at us again.
  There were several attempts to check his outbreak of interrogation; I
  remember the Cramptons asked questions about the welfare of various cousins
  of Lewis who were unknown to the rest of us, and Margaret tried to engage
  Britten in a sympathetic discussion of the Arts and Crafts exhibition. But
  Britten and Esmeer were persistent, Mrs. Millingham was mischievous, and in
  the end our rising hopes of Young Liberalism took to their thickets for good,
  while we talked all over them of the prevalent vacuity of political
  intentions. Margaret was perplexed by me. It is only now I perceive just how
  perplexing I must have been. "Of course, she said with that faint stress of
  apprehension in her eyes, one must have aims." And, "it isn't always easy to
  put everything into phrases." "Don't be long," said Mrs. Edward Crampton to
  her husband as the wives trooped out. And afterwards when we went upstairs I
  had an indefinable persuasion that the ladies had been criticising Britten's
  share in our talk in an altogether unfavourable spirit. Mrs. Edward evidently
  thought him aggressive and impertinent, and Margaret with a quiet firmness
  that brooked no resistance, took him at once into a corner and showed him
  Italian photographs by Coburn. We dispersed early.</p>

  <p>I walked with Britten along the Chelsea back streets towards Battersea
  Bridge&mdash;he lodged on the south side.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Millingham's a dear," he began.</p>

  <p>"She's a dear."</p>

  <p>"I liked her demand for a hansom because a four-wheeler was too safe."</p>

  <p>"She was worked up," I said. "She's a woman of faultless character, but
  her instincts, as Altiora would say, are anarchistic&mdash;when she gives
  them a chance."</p>

  <p>"So she takes it out in hansom cabs."</p>

  <p>"Hansom cabs."</p>

  <p>"She's wise," said Britten...</p>

  <p>"I hope, Remington," he went on after a pause, "I didn't rag your other
  guests too much. I've a sort of feeling at moments&mdash;Remington, those
  chaps are so infernally not&mdash;not bloody. It's part of a man's duty
  sometimes at least to eat red beef and get drunk. How is he to understand
  government if he doesn't? It scares me to think of your lot&mdash;by a sort
  of misapprehension&mdash;being in power. A kind of neuralgia in the head, by
  way of government. I don't understand where <i>you</i> come in. Those
  others&mdash;they've no lusts. Their ideal is anaemia. You and I, we had at
  least a lust to take hold of life and make something of it. They&mdash;they
  want to take hold of life and make nothing of it. They want to cut out all
  the stimulants. Just as though life was anything else but a reaction to
  stimulation!"...</p>

  <p>He began to talk of his own life. He had had ill-fortune through most of
  it. He was poor and unsuccessful, and a girl he had been very fond of had
  been attacked and killed by a horse in a field in a very horrible manner.
  These things had wounded and tortured him, but they hadn't broken him. They
  had, it seemed to me, made a kind of crippled and ugly demigod of him. He
  was, I began to perceive, so much better than I had any right to expect. At
  first I had been rather struck by his unkempt look, and it made my reaction
  all the stronger. There was about him something, a kind of raw and bleeding
  faith in the deep things of life, that stirred me profoundly as he showed it.
  My set of people had irritated him and disappointed him. I discovered at his
  touch how they irritated him. He reproached me boldly. He made me feel
  ashamed of my easy acquiescences as I walked in my sleek tall neatness beside
  his rather old coat, his rather battered hat, his sturdier shorter shape, and
  listened to his denunciations of our self-satisfied New Liberalism and
  Progressivism.</p>

  <p>"It has the same relation to progress&mdash;the reality of progress
  &mdash;that the things they paint on door panels in the suburbs have to art
  and beauty. There's a sort of filiation... Your Altiora's just the political
  equivalent of the ladies who sell traced cloth for embroidery; she's a dealer
  in Refined Social Reform for the Parlour. The real progress, Remington, is a
  graver thing and a painfuller thing and a slower thing altogether. Look!
  <i>That</i>"&mdash;and he pointed to where under a boarding in the light of a
  gas lamp a dingy prostitute stood lurking&mdash;"was in Babylon and Nineveh.
  Your little lot make believe there won't be anything of the sort after this
  Parliament! They're going to vanish at a few top notes from Altiora Bailey!
  Remington!&mdash;it's foolery. It's prigs at play. It's make-believe,
  make-believe! Your people there haven't got hold of things, aren't beginning
  to get hold of things, don't know anything of life at all, shirk life, avoid
  life, get in little bright clean rooms and talk big over your bumpers of
  lemonade while the Night goes by outside&mdash;untouched. Those Crampton
  fools slink by all this,"&mdash;he waved at the woman again&mdash;"pretend it
  doesn't exist, or is going to be banished root and branch by an Act to keep
  children in the wet outside public-houses. Do you think they really care,
  Remington? I don't. It's make-believe. What they want to do, what Lewis wants
  to do, what Mrs. Bunting Harblow wants her husband to do, is to sit and feel
  very grave and necessary and respected on the Government benches. They think
  of putting their feet out like statesmen, and tilting shiny hats with
  becoming brims down over their successful noses. Presentation portrait to a
  club at fifty. That's their Reality. That's their scope. They don't, it's
  manifest, <i>want</i> to think beyond that. The things there <i>are</i>,
  Remington, they'll never face! the wonder and the depth of life,&mdash;lust,
  and the night-sky,&mdash;pain."</p>

  <p>"But the good intention," I pleaded, "the Good Will!"</p>

  <p>"Sentimentality," said Britten. "No Good Will is anything but dishonesty
  unless it frets and burns and hurts and destroys a man. That lot of yours
  have nothing but a good will to think they have good will. Do you think they
  lie awake of nights searching their hearts as we do? Lewis? Crampton? Or
  those neat, admiring, satisfied little wives? See how they shrank from the
  probe!"</p>

  <p>"We all," I said, "shrink from the probe."</p>

  <p>"God help us!" said Britten...</p>

  <p>"We are but vermin at the best, Remington," he broke out,"and the greatest
  saint only a worm that has lifted its head for a moment from the dust. We are
  damned, we are meant to be damned, coral animalculae building upward, upward
  in a sea of damnation. But of all the damned things that ever were damned,
  your damned shirking, temperate, sham-efficient, self-satisfied, respectable,
  make-believe, Fabian-spirited Young Liberal is the utterly damnedest." He
  paused for a moment, and resumed in an entirely different note: "Which is why
  I was so surprised, Remington, to find <i>you</i> in this set!"</p>

  <p>"You're just the old plunger you used to be, Britten," I said. "You're
  going too far with all your might for the sake of the damns. Like a donkey
  that drags its cart up a bank to get thistles. There's depths in
  Liberalism&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We were talking about Liberals."</p>

  <p>"Liberty!"</p>

  <p>"Liberty! What do <i>your</i> little lot know of liberty?"</p>

  <p>"What does any little lot know of liberty?"</p>

  <p>"It waits outside, too big for our understanding. Like the night and the
  stars. And lust, Remington! lust and bitterness! Don't I know them? with all
  the sweetness and hope of life bitten and trampled, the dear eyes and the
  brain that loved and understood&mdash;and my poor mumble of a life going on!
  I'm within sight of being a drunkard, Remington! I'm a failure by most
  standards! Life has cut me to the bone. But I'm not afraid of it any more.
  I've paid something of the price, I've seen something of the meaning."</p>

  <p>He flew off at a tangent. "I'd rather die in Delirium Tremens," he cried,
  "than be a Crampton or a Lewis..."</p>

  <p>"Make-believe. Make-believe." The phrase and Britten's squat gestures
  haunted me as I walked homeward alone. I went to my room and stood before my
  desk and surveyed papers and files and Margaret's admirable equipment of
  me.</p>

  <p>I perceived in the lurid light of Britten's suggestions that so it was Mr.
  George Alexander would have mounted a statesman's private room...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">I was never at any stage a loyal party man. I doubt if party
  will ever again be the force it was during the eighteenth and nineteenth
  centuries. Men are becoming increasingly constructive and selective, less
  patient under tradition and the bondage of initial circumstances. As
  education becomes more universal and liberating, men will sort themselves
  more and more by their intellectual temperaments and less and less by their
  accidental associations. The past will rule them less; the future more. It is
  not simply party but school and college and county and country that lose
  their glamour. One does not hear nearly as much as our forefathers did of the
  "old Harrovian," "old Arvonian," "old Etonian" claim to this or that unfair
  advantage or unearnt sympathy. Even the Scotch and the Devonians weaken a
  little in their clannishness. A widening sense of fair play destroys such
  things. They follow freemasonry down&mdash;freemasonry of which one is
  chiefly reminded nowadays in England by propitiatory symbols outside shady
  public-houses...</p>

  <p>There is, of course, a type of man which clings very obstinately to party
  ties. These are the men with strong reproductive imaginations and no
  imaginative initiative, such men as Cladingbowl, for example, or Dayton. They
  are the scholars-at-large in life. For them the fact that the party system
  has been essential in the history of England for two hundred years gives it
  an overwhelming glamour. They have read histories and memoirs, they see the
  great grey pile of Westminster not so much for what it is as for what it was,
  rich with dramatic memories, populous with glorious ghosts, phrasing itself
  inevitably in anecdotes and quotations. It seems almost scandalous that new
  things should continue to happen, swamping with strange qualities the savour
  of these old associations.</p>

  <p>That Mr. Ramsay Macdonald should walk through Westminster Hall, thrust
  himself, it may be, through the very piece of space that once held Charles
  the Martyr pleading for his life, seems horrible profanation to Dayton, a
  last posthumous outrage; and he would, I think, like to have the front
  benches left empty now for ever, or at most adorned with laureated ivory
  tablets: "Here Dizzy sat," and "On this Spot William Ewart Gladstone made his
  First Budget Speech." Failing this, he demands, if only as signs of modesty
  and respect on the part of the survivors, meticulous imitation. "Mr. G.," he
  murmurs, "would not have done that," and laments a vanished subtlety even
  while Mr. Evesham is speaking. He is always gloomily disposed to lapse into
  wonderings about what things are coming to, wonderings that have no grain of
  curiosity. His conception of perfect conduct is industrious persistence along
  the worn-down, well-marked grooves of the great recorded days. So infinitely
  more important to him is the documented, respected thing than the elusive
  present.</p>

  <p>Cladingbowl and Dayton do not shine in the House, though Cladingbowl is a
  sound man on a committee, and Dayton keeps <i>The Old Country Gazette</i>,
  the most gentlemanly paper in London. They prevail, however, in their clubs
  at lunch time. There, with the pleasant consciousness of a morning's work
  free from either zeal or shirking, they mingle with permanent officials,
  prominent lawyers, even a few of the soberer type of business men, and relax
  their minds in the discussion of the morning paper, of the architecture of
  the West End, and of the latest public appointments, of golf, of holiday
  resorts, of the last judicial witticisms and forensic "crushers." The New
  Year and Birthday honours lists are always very sagely and exhaustively
  considered, and anecdotes are popular and keenly judged. They do not talk of
  the things that are really active in their minds, but in the formal and
  habitual manner they suppose to be proper to intelligent but still honourable
  men. Socialism, individual money matters, and religion are forbidden topics,
  and sex and women only in so far as they appear in the law courts. It is to
  me the strangest of conventions, this assumption of unreal loyalties and
  traditional respects, this repudiation and concealment of passionate
  interests. It is like wearing gloves in summer fields, or bathing in a gown,
  or falling in love with the heroine of a novel, or writing under a pseudonym,
  or becoming a masked Tuareg...</p>

  <p>It is not, I think, that men of my species are insensitive to the great
  past that is embodied in Westminster and its traditions; we are not so much
  wanting in the historical sense as alive to the greatness of our present
  opportunities and the still vaster future that is possible to us. London is
  the most interesting, beautiful, and wonderful city in the world to me,
  delicate in her incidental and multitudinous littleness, and stupendous in
  her pregnant totality; I cannot bring myself to use her as a museum or an old
  bookshop. When I think of Whitehall that little affair on the scaffold
  outside the Banqueting Hall seems trivial and remote in comparison with the
  possibilities that offer themselves to my imagination within the great grey
  Government buildings close at hand.</p>

  <p>It gives me a qualm of nostalgia even to name those places now. I think of
  St. Stephen's tower streaming upwards into the misty London night and the
  great wet quadrangle of New Palace Yard, from which the hansom cabs of my
  first experiences were ousted more and more by taxicabs as the second
  Parliament of King Edward the Seventh aged; I think of the Admiralty and War
  office with their tall Marconi masts sending out invisible threads of
  direction to the armies in the camps, to great fleets about the world. The
  crowded, darkly shining river goes flooding through my memory once again, on
  to those narrow seas that part us from our rival nations; I see quadrangles
  and corridors of spacious grey-toned offices in which undistinguished little
  men and little files of papers link us to islands in the tropics, to frozen
  wildernesses gashed for gold, to vast temple-studded plains, to forest worlds
  and mountain worlds, to ports and fortresses and lighthouses and watch-towers
  and grazing lands and corn lands all about the globe. Once more I traverse
  Victoria Street, grimy and dark, where the Agents of the Empire jostle one
  another, pass the big embassies in the West End with their flags and
  scutcheons, follow the broad avenue that leads to Buckingham Palace, witness
  the coming and going of troops and officials and guests along it from every
  land on earth... Interwoven in the texture of it all, mocking, perplexing,
  stimulating beyond measure, is the gleaming consciousness, the challenging
  knowledge: "You and your kind might still, if you could but grasp it here,
  mould all the destiny of Man!"</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">My first three years in Parliament were years of active
  discontent. The little group of younger Liberals to which I belonged was very
  ignorant of the traditions and qualities of our older leaders, and quite out
  of touch with the mass of the party. For a time Parliament was enormously
  taken up with moribund issues and old quarrels. The early Educational
  legislation was sectarian and unenterprising, and the Licensing Bill went
  little further than the attempted rectification of a Conservative mistake. I
  was altogether for the nationalisation of the public-houses, and of this end
  the Bill gave no intimations. It was just beer-baiting. I was recalcitrant
  almost from the beginning, and spoke against the Government so early as the
  second reading of the first Education Bill, the one the Lords rejected in
  1906. I went a little beyond my intention in the heat of speaking,&mdash;it
  is a way with inexperienced man. I called the Bill timid, narrow, a mere sop
  to the jealousies of sects and little-minded people. I contrasted its aim and
  methods with the manifest needs of the time.</p>

  <p>I am not a particularly good speaker; after the manner of a writer I worry
  to find my meaning too much; but this was one of my successes. I spoke after
  dinner and to a fairly full House, for people were already a little curious
  about me because of my writings. Several of the Conservative leaders were
  present and stayed, and Mr. Evesham, I remember, came ostentatiously to hear
  me, with that engaging friendliness of his, and gave me at the first chance
  an approving "Hear, Hear!" I can still recall quite distinctly my two futile
  attempts to catch the Speaker's eye before I was able to begin, the nervous
  quiver of my rather too prepared opening, the effect of hearing my own voice
  and my subconscious wonder as to what I could possibly be talking about, the
  realisation that I was getting on fairly well, the immense satisfaction
  afterwards of having on the whole brought it off, and the absurd gratitude I
  felt for that encouraging cheer.</p>

  <p>Addressing the House of Commons is like no other public speaking in the
  world. Its semi-colloquial methods give it an air of being easy, but its
  shifting audience, the comings and goings and hesitations of members behind
  the chair&mdash;not mere audience units, but men who matter&mdash;the
  desolating emptiness that spreads itself round the man who fails to interest,
  the little compact, disciplined crowd in the strangers' gallery, the light,
  elusive, flickering movements high up behind the grill, the wigged,
  attentive, weary Speaker, the table and the mace and the chapel-like Gothic
  background with its sombre shadows, conspire together, produce a confused,
  uncertain feeling in me, as though I was walking upon a pavement full of
  trap-doors and patches of uncovered morass. A misplaced, well-meant "Hear,
  Hear!" is apt to be extraordinarily disconcerting, and under no other
  circumstances have I had to speak with quite the same sideways twist that the
  arrangement of the House imposes. One does not recognise one's own voice
  threading out into the stirring brown. Unless I was excited or speaking to
  the mind of some particular person in the house, I was apt to lose my feeling
  of an auditor. I had no sense of whither my sentences were going, such as one
  has with a public meeting well under one's eye. And to lose one's sense of an
  auditor is for a man of my temperament to lose one's sense of the immediate,
  and to become prolix and vague with qualifications.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">My discontents with the Liberal party and my mental
  exploration of the quality of party generally is curiously mixed up with
  certain impressions of things and people in the National Liberal Club. The
  National Liberal Club is Liberalism made visible in the flesh&mdash;and
  Doultonware. It is an extraordinary big club done in a bold, wholesale,
  shiny, marbled style, richly furnished with numerous paintings, steel
  engravings, busts, and full-length statues of the late Mr. Gladstone; and its
  spacious dining-rooms, its long, hazy, crowded smoking-room with innumerable
  little tables and groups of men in armchairs, its magazine room and library
  upstairs, have just that undistinguished and unconcentrated diversity which
  is for me the Liberal note. The pensive member sits and hears perplexing
  dialects and even fragments of foreign speech, and among the clustering
  masses of less insistent whites his roving eye catches profiles and
  complexions that send his mind afield to Calcutta or Rangoon or the West
  Indies or Sierra Leone or the Cape...</p>

  <p>I was not infrequently that pensive member. I used to go to the Club to
  doubt about Liberalism.</p>

  <p>About two o'clock in the day the great smoking-room is crowded with
  countless little groups. They sit about small round tables, or in circles of
  chairs, and the haze of tobacco seems to prolong the great narrow place, with
  its pillars and bays, to infinity. Some of the groups are big, as many as a
  dozen men talk in loud tones; some are duologues, and there is always a
  sprinkling of lonely, dissociated men. At first one gets an impression of men
  going from group to group and as it were linking them, but as one watches
  closely one finds that these men just visit three or four groups at the
  outside, and know nothing of the others. One begins to perceive more and more
  distinctly that one is dealing with a sort of human mosaic; that each patch
  in that great place is of a different quality and colour from the next and
  never to be mixed with it. Most clubs have a common link, a lowest common
  denominator in the Club Bore, who spares no one, but even the National
  Liberal bores are specialised and sectional. As one looks round one sees here
  a clump of men from the North Country or the Potteries, here an island of
  South London politicians, here a couple of young Jews ascendant from
  Whitechapel, here a circle of journalists and writers, here a group of Irish
  politicians, here two East Indians, here a priest or so, here a clump of
  old-fashioned Protestants, here a little knot of eminent Rationalists
  indulging in a blasphemous story <i>sotto voce.</i> Next them are a group of
  anglicised Germans and highly specialised chess-players, and then two of the
  oddest-looking persons&mdash;bulging with documents and intent upon
  extraordinary business transactions over long cigars...</p>

  <p>I would listen to a stormy sea of babblement, and try to extract some
  constructive intimations. Every now and then I got a whiff of politics. It
  was clear they were against the Lords&mdash;against plutocrats&mdash;against
  Cossington's newspapers&mdash;against the brewers... It was tremendously
  clear what they were against. The trouble was to find out what on earth they
  were for!...</p>

  <p>As I sat and thought, the streaked and mottled pillars and wall, the
  various views, aspects, and portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone, the
  partitions of polished mahogany, the yellow-vested waiters, would dissolve
  and vanish, and I would have a vision of this sample of miscellaneous men of
  limited, diverse interests and a universal littleness of imagination
  enlarged, unlimited, no longer a sample but a community, spreading,
  stretching out to infinity&mdash;all in little groups and duologues and
  circles, all with their special and narrow concerns, all with their backs to
  most of the others.</p>

  <p>What but a common antagonism would ever keep these multitudes together? I
  understood why modern electioneering is more than half of it denunciation.
  Let us condemn, if possible, let us obstruct and deprive, but not let us do.
  There is no real appeal to the commonplace mind in "Let us do." That calls
  for the creative imagination, and few have been accustomed to respond to that
  call. The other merely needs jealousy and bate, of which there are great and
  easily accessible reservoirs in every human heart...</p>

  <p>I remember that vision of endless, narrow, jealous individuality very
  vividly. A seething limitlessness it became at last, like a waste place
  covered by crawling locusts that men sweep up by the sackload and drown by
  the million in ditches...</p>

  <p>Grotesquely against it came the lean features, the sidelong shy movements
  of Edward Crampton, seated in a circle of talkers close at hand. I had a
  whiff of his strained, unmusical voice, and behold! he was saying something
  about the "Will of the People..."</p>

  <p>The immense and wonderful disconnectednesses of human life! I forgot the
  smoke and jabber of the club altogether; I became a lonely spirit flung aloft
  by some queer accident, a stone upon a ledge in some high and rocky
  wilderness, and below as far as the eye could reach stretched the swarming
  infinitesimals of humanity, like grass upon the field, like pebbles upon
  unbounded beaches. Was there ever to be in human life more than that endless
  struggling individualism? Was there indeed some giantry, some immense valiant
  synthesis, still to come&mdash;or present it might be and still unseen by me,
  or was this the beginning and withal the last phase of mankind?...</p>

  <p>I glimpsed for a while the stupendous impudence of our ambitions, the
  tremendous enterprise to which the modern statesman is implicitly addressed.
  I was as it were one of a little swarm of would-be reef builders looking back
  at the teeming slime upon the ocean floor. All the history of mankind, all
  the history of life, has been and will be the story of something struggling
  out of the indiscriminated abyss, struggling to exist and prevail over and
  comprehend individual lives&mdash;an effort of insidious attraction, an idea
  of invincible appeal. That something greater than ourselves, which does not
  so much exist as seek existence, palpitating between being and not-being, how
  marvellous it is! It has worn the form and visage of ten thousand different
  gods, sought a shape for itself in stone and ivory and music and wonderful
  words, spoken more and more clearly of a mystery of love, a mystery of unity,
  dabbling meanwhile in blood and cruelty beyond the common impulses of men. It
  is something that comes and goes, like a light that shines and is withdrawn,
  withdrawn so completely that one doubts if it has ever been...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">I would mark with a curious interest the stray country
  member of the club up in town for a night or so. My mind would be busy with
  speculations about him, about his home, his family, his reading, his
  horizons, his innumerable fellows who didn't belong and never came up. I
  would fill in the outline of him with memories of my uncle and his
  Staffordshire neighbours. He was perhaps Alderman This or Councillor That
  down there, a great man in his ward, J. P. within seven miles of the boundary
  of the borough, and a God in his home. Here he was nobody, and very shy, and
  either a little too arrogant or a little too meek towards our very democratic
  mannered but still livened waiters. Was he perhaps the backbone of England?
  He over-ate himself lest he should appear mean, went through our Special
  Dinner conscientiously, drank, unless he was teetotal, of unfamiliar wines,
  and did his best, in spite of the rules, to tip. Afterwards, in a state of
  flushed repletion, he would have old brandy, black coffee, and a banded
  cigar, or in the name of temperance omit the brandy and have rather more
  coffee, in the smoking-room. I would sit and watch that stiff dignity of
  self-indulgence, and wonder, wonder...</p>

  <p>An infernal clairvoyance would come to me. I would have visions of him in
  relation to his wife, checking always, sometimes bullying, sometimes being
  ostentatiously "kind"; I would see him glance furtively at his domestic
  servants upon his staircase, or stiffen his upper lip against the reluctant,
  protesting business employee. We imaginative people are base enough, heaven
  knows, but it is only in rare moods of bitter penetration that we pierce down
  to the baser lusts, the viler shames, the everlasting lying and muddle-headed
  self-justification of the dull.</p>

  <p>I would turn my eyes down the crowded room and see others of him and
  others. What did he think he was up to? Did he for a moment realise that his
  presence under that ceramic glory of a ceiling with me meant, if it had any
  rational meaning at all, that we were jointly doing something with the nation
  and the empire and mankind? ... How on earth could any one get hold of him,
  make any noble use of him? He didn't read beyond his newspaper. He never
  thought, but only followed imaginings in his heart. He never discussed. At
  the first hint of discussion his temper gave way. He was, I knew, a deep,
  thinly-covered tank of resentments and quite irrational moral rages. Yet
  withal I would have to resist an impulse to go over to him and nudge him and
  say to him, "Look here! What indeed do you think we are doing with the nation
  and the empire and mankind? You know&mdash;<i>Mankind</i>!"</p>

  <p>I wonder what reply I should have got.</p>

  <p>So far as any average could be struck and so far as any backbone could be
  located, it seemed to me that this silent, shy, replete, sub-angry, middle-
  class sentimentalist was in his endless species and varieties and dialects
  the backbone of our party. So far as I could be considered as representing
  anything in the House, I pretended to sit for the elements of
  <i>him</i>...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">For a time I turned towards the Socialists. They at least
  had an air of coherent intentions. At that time Socialism had come into
  politics again after a period of depression and obscurity, with a tremendous
  ECLAT. There was visibly a following of Socialist members to Chris Robinson;
  mysteriously uncommunicative gentlemen in soft felt hats and short coats and
  square-toed boots who replied to casual advances a little surprisingly in
  rich North Country dialects. Members became aware of a "seagreen
  incorruptible," as Colonel Marlow put it to me, speaking on the Address, a
  slender twisted figure supporting itself on a stick and speaking with a fire
  that was altogether revolutionary. This was Philip Snowden, the member for
  Blackburn. They had come in nearly forty strong altogether, and with an air
  of presently meaning to come in much stronger. They were only one aspect of
  what seemed at that time a big national movement. Socialist societies, we
  gathered, were springing up all over the country, and every one was inquiring
  about Socialism and discussing Socialism. It had taken the Universities with
  particular force, and any youngster with the slightest intellectual
  pretension was either actively for or brilliantly against. For a time our
  Young Liberal group was ostentatiously sympathetic...</p>

  <p>When I think of the Socialists there comes a vivid memory of certain
  evening gatherings at our house...</p>

  <p>These gatherings had been organised by Margaret as the outcome of a
  discussion at the Baileys'. Altiora had been very emphatic and uncharitable
  upon the futility of the Socialist movement. It seemed that even the leaders
  fought shy of dinner-parties.</p>

  <p>"They never meet each other," said Altiora, "much less people on the other
  side. How can they begin to understand politics until they do that?"</p>

  <p>"Most of them have totally unpresentable wives," said Altiora, "totally!"
  and quoted instances, "and they <i>will</i> bring them. Or they won't come!
  Some of the poor creatures have scarcely learnt their table manners. They
  just make holes in the talk..."</p>

  <p>I thought there was a great deal of truth beneath Altiora's outburst. The
  presentation of the Socialist case seemed very greatly crippled by the want
  of a common intimacy in its leaders; the want of intimacy didn't at first
  appear to be more than an accident, and our talk led to Margaret's attempt to
  get acquaintance and easy intercourse afoot among them and between them and
  the Young Liberals of our group. She gave a series of weekly dinners,
  planned, I think, a little too accurately upon Altiora's model, and after
  each we had as catholic a reception as we could contrive.</p>

  <p>Our receptions were indeed, I should think, about as catholic as
  receptions could be. Margaret found herself with a weekly houseful of
  insoluble problems in intercourse. One did one's best, but one got a
  nightmare feeling as the evening wore on.</p>

  <p>It was one of the few unanimities of these parties that every one should
  be a little odd in appearance, funny about the hair or the tie or the shoes
  or more generally, and that bursts of violent aggression should alternate
  with an attitude entirely defensive. A number of our guests had an air of
  waiting for a clue that never came, and stood and sat about silently, mildly
  amused but not a bit surprised that we did not discover their distinctive
  Open-Sesames. There was a sprinkling of manifest seers and prophetesses in
  shapeless garments, far too many, I thought, for really easy social
  intercourse, and any conversation at any moment was liable to become
  oracular. One was in a state of tension from first to last; the most innocent
  remark seemed capable of exploding resentment, and replies came out at the
  most unexpected angles. We Young Liberals went about puzzled but polite to
  the gathering we had evoked. The Young Liberals' tradition is on the whole
  wonderfully discreet, superfluous steam is let out far away from home in the
  Balkans or Africa, and the neat, stiff figures of the Cramptons, Bunting
  Harblow, and Lewis, either in extremely well-cut morning coats indicative of
  the House, or in what is sometimes written of as "faultless evening dress,"
  stood about on those evenings, they and their very quietly and simply and
  expensively dressed little wives, like a datum line amidst lakes and
  mountains.</p>

  <p>I didn't at first see the connection between systematic social
  reorganisation and arbitrary novelties in dietary and costume, just as I
  didn't realise why the most comprehensive constructive projects should appear
  to be supported solely by odd and exceptional personalities. On one of these
  evenings a little group of rather jolly-looking pretty young people seated
  themselves for no particular reason in a large circle on the floor of my
  study, and engaged, so far as I could judge, in the game of Hunt the Meaning,
  the intellectual equivalent of Hunt the Slipper. It must have been that same
  evening I came upon an unbleached young gentleman before the oval mirror on
  the landing engaged in removing the remains of an anchovy sandwich from his
  protruded tongue&mdash;visible ends of cress having misled him into the
  belief that he was dealing with doctrinally permissible food. It was not
  unusual to be given hand-bills and printed matter by our guests, but there I
  had the advantage over Lewis, who was too tactful to refuse the stuff, too
  neatly dressed to pocket it, and had no writing-desk available upon which he
  could relieve himself in a manner flattering to the giver. So that his hands
  got fuller and fuller. A relentless, compact little woman in what Margaret
  declared to be an extremely expensive black dress has also printed herself on
  my memory; she had set her heart upon my contributing to a weekly periodical
  in the lentil interest with which she was associated, and I spent much time
  and care in evading her.</p>

  <p>Mingling with the more hygienic types were a number of Anti-Puritan
  Socialists, bulging with bias against temperance, and breaking out against
  austere methods of living all over their faces. Their manner was packed with
  heartiness. They were apt to choke the approaches to the little buffet
  Margaret had set up downstairs, and there engage in discussions of
  Determinism&mdash;it always seemed to be Determinism&mdash;which became
  heartier and noisier, but never acrimonious even in the small hours. It
  seemed impossible to settle about this Determinism of theirs&mdash;ever. And
  there were worldly Socialists also. I particularly recall a large, active,
  buoyant, lady-killing individual with an eyeglass borne upon a broad black
  ribbon, who swam about us one evening. He might have been a slightly frayed
  actor, in his large frock-coat, his white waistcoat, and the sort of black
  and white check trousers that twinkle. He had a high-pitched voice with
  aristocratic intonations, and he seemed to be in a perpetual state of
  interrogation. "What are we all he-a for?" he would ask only too audibly.
  "What are we doing he-a? What's the connection?"</p>

  <p>What <i>was</i> the connection?</p>

  <p>We made a special effort with our last assembly in June, 1907. We tried to
  get something like a representative collection of the parliamentary leaders
  of Socialism, the various exponents of Socialist thought and a number of
  Young Liberal thinkers into one room. Dorvil came, and Horatio Bulch;
  Featherstonehaugh appeared for ten minutes and talked charmingly to Margaret
  and then vanished again; there was Wilkins the novelist and Toomer and Dr.
  Tumpany. Chris Robinson stood about for a time in a new comforter, and
  Magdeberg and Will Pipes and five or six Labour members. And on our side we
  had our particular little group, Bunting Harblow, Crampton, Lewis, all
  looking as broad-minded and open to conviction as they possibly could, and
  even occasionally talking out from their bushes almost boldly. But the
  gathering as a whole refused either to mingle or dispute, and as an
  experiment in intercourse the evening was a failure. Unexpected dissociations
  appeared between Socialists one had supposed friendly. I could not have
  imagined it was possible for half so many people to turn their backs on
  everybody else in such small rooms as ours. But the unsaid things those backs
  expressed broke out, I remarked, with refreshed virulence in the various
  organs of the various sections of the party next week.</p>

  <p>I talked, I remember, with Dr. Tumpany, a large young man in a still
  larger professional frock-coat, and with a great shock of very fair hair, who
  was candidate for some North Country constituency. We discussed the political
  outlook, and, like so many Socialists at that time, he was full of vague
  threatenings against the Liberal party. I was struck by a thing in him that I
  had already observed less vividly in many others of these Socialist leaders,
  and which gave me at last a clue to the whole business. He behaved exactly
  like a man in possession of valuable patent rights, who wants to be dealt
  with. He had an air of having a corner in ideas. Then it flashed into my head
  that the whole Socialist movement was an attempted corner in ideas...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 8</h3>

  <p class="first">Late that night I found myself alone with Margaret amid the
  debris of the gathering.</p>

  <p>I sat before the fire, hands in pockets, and Margaret, looking white and
  weary, came and leant upon the mantel.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lord!" said Margaret.</p>

  <p>I agreed. Then I resumed my meditation.</p>

  <p>"Ideas," I said, "count for more than I thought in the world."</p>

  <p>Margaret regarded me with that neutral expression behind which she was
  accustomed to wait for clues.</p>

  <p>"When you think of the height and depth and importance and wisdom of the
  Socialist ideas, and see the men who are running them," I explained... "A big
  system of ideas like Socialism grows up out of the obvious common sense of
  our present conditions. It's as impersonal as science. All these
  men&mdash;They've given nothing to it. They're just people who have pegged
  out claims upon a big intellectual No-Man's-Land&mdash;and don't feel quite
  sure of the law. There's a sort of quarrelsome uneasiness... If we professed
  Socialism do you think they'd welcome us? Not a man of them! They'd feel it
  was burglary..."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Margaret, looking into the fire. "That is just what I felt
  about them all the evening... Particularly Dr. Tumpany."</p>

  <p>"We mustn't confuse Socialism with the Socialists," I said; "that's the
  moral of it. I suppose if God were to find He had made a mistake in dates or
  something, and went back and annihilated everybody from Owen onwards who was
  in any way known as a Socialist leader or teacher, Socialism would be exactly
  where it is and what it is to-day&mdash;a growing realisation of constructive
  needs in every man's mind, and a little corner in party politics. So, I
  suppose, it will always be... But they <i>were</i> a damned lot,
  Margaret!"</p>

  <p>I looked up at the little noise she made. "TWICE!" she said, smiling
  indulgently, "to-day!" (Even the smile was Altiora's.)</p>

  <p>I returned to my thoughts. They <i>were</i> a damned human lot. It was an
  excellent word in that connection...</p>

  <p>But the ideas marched on, the ideas marched on, just as though men's
  brains were no more than stepping-stones, just as though some great brain in
  which we are all little cells and corpuscles was thinking them!...</p>

  <p>"I don't think there is a man among them who makes me feel he is
  trustworthy," said Margaret; "unless it is Featherstonehaugh."</p>

  <p>I sat taking in this proposition.</p>

  <p>"They'll never help us, I feel," said Margaret.</p>

  <p>"Us?"</p>

  <p>"The Liberals."</p>

  <p>"Oh, damn the Liberals!" I said. "They'll never even help themselves."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I could possibly get on with any of those people," said
  Margaret, after a pause.</p>

  <p>She remained for a time looking down at me and, I could feel, perplexed by
  me, but I wanted to go on with my thinking, and so I did not look up, and
  presently she stooped to my forehead and kissed me and went rustling softly
  to her room.</p>

  <p>I remained in my study for a long time with my thoughts crystallising
  out...</p>

  <p>It was then, I think, that I first apprehended clearly how that opposition
  to which I have already alluded of the immediate life and the mental
  hinterland of a man, can be applied to public and social affairs. The ideas
  go on&mdash;and no person or party succeeds in embodying them. The reality of
  human progress never comes to the surface, it is a power in the deeps, an
  undertow. It goes on in silence while men think, in studies where they write
  self-forgetfully, in laboratories under the urgency of an impersonal
  curiosity, in the rare illumination of honest talk, in moments of emotional
  insight, in thoughtful reading, but not in everyday affairs. Everyday affairs
  and whatever is made an everyday affair, are transactions of the ostensible
  self, the being of habits, interests, usage. Temper, vanity, hasty reaction
  to imitation, personal feeling, are their substance. No man can abolish his
  immediate self and specialise in the depths; if he attempt that, he simply
  turns himself into something a little less than the common man. He may have
  an immense hinterland, but that does not absolve him from a frontage. That is
  the essential error of the specialist philosopher, the specialist teacher,
  the specialist publicist. They repudiate frontage; claim to be pure
  hinterland. That is what bothered me about Codger, about those various
  schoolmasters who had prepared me for life, about the Baileys and their dream
  of an official ruling class. A human being who is a philosopher in the first
  place, a teacher in the first place, or a statesman in the first place, is
  thereby and inevitably, though he bring God-like gifts to the
  pretence&mdash;a quack. These are attempts to live deep-side shallow, inside
  out. They produce merely a new pettiness. To understand Socialism, again, is
  to gain a new breadth of outlook; to join a Socialist organisation is to join
  a narrow cult which is not even tolerably serviceable in presenting or
  spreading the ideas for which it stands...</p>

  <p>I perceived I had got something quite fundamental here. It had taken me
  some years to realise the true relation of the great constructive ideas that
  swayed me not only to political parties, but to myself. I had been disposed
  to identify the formulae of some one party with social construction, and to
  regard the other as necessarily anti-constructive, just as I had been
  inclined to follow the Baileys in the self-righteousness of supposing myself
  to be wholly constructive. But I saw now that every man of intellectual
  freedom and vigour is necessarily constructive-minded nowadays, and that no
  man is disinterestedly so. Each one of us repeats in himself the conflict of
  the race between the splendour of its possibilities and its immediate
  associations. We may be shaping immortal things, but we must sleep and answer
  the dinner gong, and have our salt of flattery and self-approval. In politics
  a man counts not for what he is in moments of imaginative expansion, but for
  his common workaday, selfish self; and political parties are held together
  not by a community of ultimate aims, but by the stabler bond of an accustomed
  life. Everybody almost is for progress in general, and nearly everybody is
  opposed to any change, except in so far as gross increments are change, in
  his particular method of living and behaviour. Every party stands essentially
  for the interests and mental usages of some definite class or group of
  classes in the exciting community, and every party has its scientific-minded
  and constructive leading section, with well-defined hinterlands formulating
  its social functions in a public-spirited form, and its superficial-minded
  following confessing its meannesses and vanities and prejudices. No class
  will abolish itself, materially alter its way of life, or drastically
  reconstruct itself, albeit no class is indisposed to co-operate in the
  unlimited socialisation of any other class. In that capacity for aggression
  upon other classes lies the essential driving force of modern affairs. The
  instincts, the persons, the parties, and vanities sway and struggle. The
  ideas and understandings march on and achieve themselves for all&mdash;in
  spite of every one...</p>

  <p>The methods and traditions of British politics maintain the form of two
  great parties, with rider groups seeking to gain specific ends in the event
  of a small Government majority. These two main parties are more or less
  heterogeneous in composition. Each, however, has certain necessary
  characteristics. The Conservative Party has always stood quite definitely for
  the established propertied interests. The land-owner, the big lawyer, the
  Established Church, and latterly the huge private monopoly of the liquor
  trade which has been created by temperance legislation, are the essential
  Conservatives. Interwoven now with the native wealthy are the families of the
  great international usurers, and a vast miscellaneous mass of financial
  enterprise. Outside the range of resistance implied by these interests, the
  Conservative Party has always shown itself just as constructive and
  collectivist as any other party. The great landowners have been as well-
  disposed towards the endowment of higher education, and as willing to co-
  operate with the Church in protective and mildly educational legislation for
  children and the working class, as any political section. The financiers,
  too, are adventurous-spirited and eager for mechanical progress and technical
  efficiency. They are prepared to spend public money upon research, upon ports
  and harbours and public communications, upon sanitation and hygienic
  organisation. A certain rude benevolence of public intention is equally
  characteristic of the liquor trade. Provided his comfort leads to no excesses
  of temperance, the liquor trade is quite eager to see the common man
  prosperous, happy, and with money to spend in a bar. All sections of the
  party are aggressively patriotic and favourably inclined to the idea of an
  upstanding, well-fed, and well-exercised population in uniform. Of course
  there are reactionary landowners and old-fashioned country clergy, full of
  localised self-importance, jealous even of the cottager who can read, but
  they have neither the power nor the ability to retard the constructive forces
  in the party as a whole. On the other hand, when matters point to any
  definitely confiscatory proposal, to the public ownership and collective
  control of land, for example, or state mining and manufactures, or the
  nationalisation of the so-called public-house or extended municipal
  enterprise, or even to an increase of the taxation of property, then the
  Conservative Party presents a nearly adamantine bar. It does not stand for,
  it IS, the existing arrangement in these affairs.</p>

  <p>Even more definitely a class party is the Labour Party, whose immediate
  interest is to raise wages, shorten hours of labor, increase employment, and
  make better terms for the working-man tenant and working-man purchaser. Its
  leaders are no doubt constructive minded, but the mass of the following is
  naturally suspicious of education and discipline, hostile to the higher
  education, and&mdash;except for an obvious antagonism to employers and
  property owners&mdash;almost destitute of ideas. What else can it be? It
  stands for the expropriated multitude, whose whole situation and difficulty
  arise from its individual lack of initiative and organising power. It favours
  the nationalisation of land and capital with no sense of the difficulties
  involved in the process; but, on the other hand, the equally reasonable
  socialisation of individuals which is implied by military service is steadily
  and quite naturally and quite illogically opposed by it. It is only in recent
  years that Labour has emerged as a separate party from the huge hospitable
  caravanserai of Liberalism, and there is still a very marked tendency to step
  back again into that multitudinous assemblage.</p>

  <p>For multitudinousness has always been the Liberal characteristic.
  Liberalism never has been nor ever can be anything but a diversified crowd.
  Liberalism has to voice everything that is left out by these other parties.
  It is the party against the predominating interests. It is at once the party
  of the failing and of the untried; it is the party of decadence and hope.
  From its nature it must be a vague and planless association in comparison
  with its antagonist, neither so constructive on the one hand, nor on the
  other so competent to hinder the inevitable constructions of the civilised
  state. Essentially it is the party of criticism, the "Anti" party. It is a
  system of hostilities and objections that somehow achieves at times an
  elusive common soul. It is a gathering together of all the smaller interests
  which find themselves at a disadvantage against the big established classes,
  the leasehold tenant as against the landowner, the retail tradesman as
  against the merchant and the moneylender, the Nonconformist as against the
  Churchman, the small employer as against the demoralising hospitable
  publican, the man without introductions and broad connections against the man
  who has these things. It is the party of the many small men against the fewer
  prevailing men. It has no more essential reason for loving the Collectivist
  state than the Conservatives; the small dealer is doomed to absorption in
  that just as much as the large owner; but it resorts to the state against its
  antagonists as in the middle ages common men pitted themselves against the
  barons by siding with the king. The Liberal Party is the party against "class
  privilege" because it represents no class advantages, but it is also the
  party that is on the whole most set against Collective control because it
  represents no established responsilibity. It is constructive only so far as
  its antagonism to the great owner is more powerful than its jealousy of the
  state. It organises only because organisation is forced upon it by the
  organisation of its adversaries. It lapses in and out of alliance with Labour
  as it sways between hostility to wealth and hostility to public
  expenditure...</p>

  <p>Every modern European state will have in some form or other these three
  parties: the resistent, militant, authoritative, dull, and unsympathetic
  party of establishment and success, the rich party; the confused,
  sentimental, spasmodic, numerous party of the small, struggling, various,
  undisciplined men, the poor man's party; and a third party sometimes
  detaching itself from the second and sometimes reuniting with it, the party
  of the altogether expropriated masses, the proletarians, Labour. Change
  Conservative and Liberal to Republican and Democrat, for example, and you
  have the conditions in the United States. The Crown or a dethroned dynasty,
  the Established Church or a dispossessed church, nationalist secessions, the
  personalities of party leaders, may break up, complicate, and confuse the
  self-expression of these three necessary divisions in the modern social
  drama, the analyst will make them out none the less for that...</p>

  <p>And then I came back as if I came back to a refrain;&mdash;the ideas go
  on&mdash;as though we are all no more than little cells and corpuscles in
  some great brain beyond our understanding...</p>

  <p>So it was I sat and thought my problem out... I still remember my
  satisfaction at seeing things plainly at last. It was like clouds dispersing
  to show the sky. Constructive ideas, of course, couldn't hold a party
  together alone, "interests and habits, not ideas," I had that now, and so the
  great constructive scheme of Socialism, invading and inspiring all parties,
  was necessarily claimed only by this collection of odds and ends, this
  residuum of disconnected and exceptional people. This was true not only of
  the Socialist idea, but of the scientific idea, the idea of veracity&mdash;of
  human confidence in humanity&mdash;of all that mattered in human life outside
  the life of individuals... The only real party that would ever profess
  Socialism was the Labour Party, and that in the entirely one-sided form of an
  irresponsible and non-constructive attack on property. Socialism in that
  mutilated form, the teeth and claws without the eyes and brain, I wanted as
  little as I wanted anything in the world.</p>

  <p>Perfectly clear it was, perfectly clear, and why hadn't I seen it before?
  ... I looked at my watch, and it was half-past two.</p>

  <p>I yawned, stretched, got up and went to bed.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 9</h3>

  <p class="first">My ideas about statecraft have passed through three main
  phases to the final convictions that remain. There was the first immediacy of
  my dream of ports and harbours and cities, railways, roads, and administered
  territories &mdash;the vision I had seen in the haze from that little church
  above Locarno. Slowly that had passed into a more elaborate legislative
  constructiveness, which had led to my uneasy association with the Baileys and
  the professedly constructive Young Liberals. To get that ordered life I had
  realised the need of organisation, knowledge, expertness, a wide movement of
  co-ordinated methods. On the individual side I thought that a life of urgent
  industry, temperance, and close attention was indicated by my perception of
  these ends. I married Margaret and set to work. But something in my mind
  refused from the outset to accept these determinations as final. There was
  always a doubt lurking below, always a faint resentment, a protesting
  criticism, a feeling of vitally important omissions.</p>

  <p>I arrived at last at the clear realisation that my political associates,
  and I in my association with them, were oddly narrow, priggish, and unreal,
  that the Socialists with whom we were attempting co-operation were
  preposterously irrelevant to their own theories, that my political life
  didn't in some way comprehend more than itself, that rather perplexingly I
  was missing the thing I was seeking. Britten's footnotes to Altiora's
  self-assertions, her fits of energetic planning, her quarrels and rallies and
  vanities, his illuminating attacks on Cramptonism and the heavy-spirited
  triviality of such Liberalism as the Children's Charter, served to point my
  way to my present conclusions. I had been trying to deal all along with human
  progress as something immediate in life, something to be immediately attacked
  by political parties and groups pointing primarily to that end. I now began
  to see that just as in my own being there was the rather shallow, rather
  vulgar, self-seeking careerist, who wore an admirable silk hat and bustled
  self-consciously through the lobby, and a much greater and indefinitely
  growing unpublished personality behind him&mdash;my hinterland, I have called
  it&mdash;so in human affairs generally the permanent reality is also a
  hinterland, which is never really immediate, which draws continually upon
  human experience and influences human action more and more, but which is
  itself never the actual player upon the stage. It is the unseen dramatist who
  never takes a call. Now it was just through the fact that our group about the
  Baileys didn't understand this, that with a sort of frantic energy they were
  trying to develop that sham expert officialdom of theirs to plan, regulate,
  and direct the affairs of humanity, that the perplexing note of silliness and
  shallowness that I had always felt and felt now most acutely under Britten's
  gibes, came in. They were neglecting human life altogether in social
  organisation.</p>

  <p>In the development of intellectual modesty lies the growth of
  statesmanship. It has been the chronic mistake of statecraft and all
  organising spirits to attempt immediately to scheme and arrange and achieve.
  Priests, schools of thought, political schemers, leaders of men, have always
  slipped into the error of assuming that they can think out the whole&mdash;or
  at any rate completely think out definite parts&mdash;of the purpose and
  future of man, clearly and finally; they have set themselves to legislate and
  construct on that assumption, and, experiencing the perplexing obduracy and
  evasions of reality, they have taken to dogma, persecution, training,
  pruning, secretive education; and all the stupidities of self-sufficient
  energy. In the passion of their good intentions they have not hesitated to
  conceal fact, suppress thought, crush disturbing initiatives and apparently
  detrimental desires. And so it is blunderingly and wastefully, destroying
  with the making, that any extension of social organisation is at present
  achieved.</p>

  <p>Directly, however, this idea of an emancipation from immediacy is grasped,
  directly the dominating importance of this critical, less personal, mental
  hinterland in the individual and of the collective mind in the race is
  understood, the whole problem of the statesman and his attitude towards
  politics gain a new significance, and becomes accessible to a new series of
  solutions. He wants no longer to "fix up," as people say, human affairs, but
  to devote his forces to the development of that needed intellectual life
  without which all his shallow attempts at fixing up are futile. He ceases to
  build on the sands, and sets himself to gather foundations.</p>

  <p>You see, I began in my teens by wanting to plan and build cities and
  harbours for mankind; I ended in the middle thirties by desiring only to
  serve and increase a general process of thought, a process fearless,
  critical, real-spirited, that would in its own time give cities, harbours,
  air, happiness, everything at a scale and quality and in a light altogether
  beyond the match-striking imaginations of a contemporary mind. I wanted
  freedom of speech and suggestion, vigour of thought, and the cultivation of
  that impulse of veracity that lurks more or less discouraged in every man.
  With that I felt there must go an emotion. I hit upon a phrase that became at
  last something of a refrain in my speech and writings, to convey the spirit
  that I felt was at the very heart of real human progress&mdash;love and fine
  thinking.</p>

  <p>(I suppose that nowadays no newspaper in England gets through a week
  without the repetition of that phrase.)</p>

  <p>My convictions crystallised more and more definitely upon this. The more
  of love and fine thinking the better for men, I said; the less, the worse.
  And upon this fresh basis I set myself to examine what I as a politician
  might do. I perceived I was at last finding an adequate expression for all
  that was in me, for those forces that had rebelled at the crude presentations
  of Bromstead, at the secrecies and suppressions of my youth, at the dull
  unrealities of City Merchants, at the conventions and timidities of the Pinky
  Dinkys, at the philosophical recluse of Trinity and the phrases and
  tradition-worship of my political associates. None of these things were half
  alive, and I wanted life to be intensely alive and awake. I wanted thought
  like an edge of steel and desire like a flame. The real work before mankind
  now, I realised once and for all, is the enlargement of human expression, the
  release and intensification of human thought, the vivider utilisation of
  experience and the invigoration of research&mdash;and whatever one does in
  human affairs has or lacks value as it helps or hinders that.</p>

  <p>With that I had got my problem clear, and the solution, so far as I was
  concerned, lay in finding out the point in the ostensible life of politics at
  which I could most subserve these ends. I was still against the muddles of
  Bromstead, but I had hunted them down now to their essential form. The jerry-
  built slums, the roads that went nowhere, the tarred fences, litigious
  notice-boards and barbed wire fencing, the litter and the heaps of dump, were
  only the outward appearances whose ultimate realities were jerry-built
  conclusions, hasty purposes, aimless habits of thought, and imbecile bars and
  prohibitions in the thoughts and souls of men. How are we through politics to
  get at that confusion?</p>

  <p>We want to invigorate and reinvigorate education. We want to create a
  sustained counter effort to the perpetual tendency of all educational
  organisations towards classicalism, secondary issues, and the evasion of
  life.</p>

  <p>We want to stimulate the expression of life through art and literature,
  and its exploration through research.</p>

  <p>We want to make the best and finest thought accessible to every one, and
  more particularly to create and sustain an enormous free criticism, without
  which art, literature, and research alike degenerate into tradition or
  imposture.</p>

  <p>Then all the other problems which are now so insoluble, destitution,
  disease, the difficulty of maintaining international peace, the scarcely
  faced possibility of making life generally and continually beautiful,
  become&mdash;EASY...</p>

  <p>It was clear to me that the most vital activities in which I could engage
  would be those which most directly affected the Church, public habits of
  thought, education, organised research, literature, and the channels of
  general discussion. I had to ask myself how my position as Liberal member for
  Kinghamstead squared with and conduced to this essential work.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap3_02"
     name="chap3_02"></a>II. &mdash; SEEKING ASSOCIATES</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">I have told of my gradual abandonment of the pretensions and
  habits of party Liberalism. In a sense I was moving towards aristocracy.
  Regarding the development of the social and individual mental hinterland as
  the essential thing in human progress, I passed on very naturally to the
  practical assumption that we wanted what I may call "hinterlanders." Of
  course I do not mean by aristocracy the changing unorganised medley of rich
  people and privileged people who dominate the civilised world of to-day, but
  as opposed to this, a possibility of co-ordinating the will of the finer
  individuals, by habit and literature, into a broad common aim. We must have
  an aristocracy&mdash;not of privilege, but of understanding and
  purpose&mdash;or mankind will fail. I find this dawning more and more clearly
  when I look through my various writings of the years between 1903 and 1910. I
  was already emerging to plain statements in 1908.</p>

  <p>I reasoned after this fashion. The line of human improvement and the
  expansion of human life lies in the direction of education and finer
  initiatives. If humanity cannot develop an education far beyond anything that
  is now provided, if it cannot collectively invent devices and solve problems
  on a much richer, broader scale than it does at the present time, it cannot
  hope to achieve any very much finer order or any more general happiness than
  it now enjoys. We must believe, therefore, that it <i>can</i> develop such a
  training and education, or we must abandon secular constructive hope. And
  here my peculiar difficulty as against crude democracy comes in. If humanity
  at large is capable of that high education and those creative freedoms our
  hope demands, much more must its better and more vigorous types be so
  capable. And if those who have power and leisure now, and freedom to respond
  to imaginative appeals, cannot be won to the idea of collective
  self-development, then the whole of humanity cannot be won to that. From that
  one passes to what has become my general conception in politics, the
  conception of the constructive imagination working upon the vast complex of
  powerful people, clever people, enterprising people, influential people,
  amidst whom power is diffused to-day, to produce that self-conscious, highly
  selective, open-minded, devoted aristocratic culture, which seems to me to be
  the necessary next phase in the development of human affairs. I see human
  progress, not as the spontaneous product of crowds of raw minds swayed by
  elementary needs, but as a natural but elaborate result of intricate human
  interdependencies, of human energy and curiosity liberated and acting at
  leisure, of human passions and motives, modified and redirected by literature
  and art...</p>

  <p>But now the reader will understand how it came about that, disappointed by
  the essential littleness of Liberalism, and disillusioned about the
  representative quality of the professed Socialists, I turned my mind more and
  more to a scrutiny of the big people, the wealthy and influential people,
  against whom Liberalism pits its forces. I was asking myself definitely
  whether, after all, it was not my particular job to work through them and not
  against them. Was I not altogether out of my element as an Anti-? Weren't
  there big bold qualities about these people that common men lack, and the
  possibility of far more splendid dreams? Were they really the obstacles,
  might they not be rather the vehicles of the possible new braveries of
  life?</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">The faults of the Imperialist movement were obvious enough.
  The conception of the Boer War had been clumsy and puerile, the costly errors
  of that struggle appalling, and the subsequent campaign of Mr. Chamberlain
  for Tariff Reform seemed calculated to combine the financial adventurers of
  the Empire in one vast conspiracy against the consumer. The cant of
  Imperialism was easy to learn and use; it was speedily adopted by all sorts
  of base enterprises and turned to all sorts of base ends. But a big child is
  permitted big mischief, and my mind was now continually returning to the
  persuasion that after all in some development of the idea of Imperial
  patriotism might be found that wide, rough, politically acceptable expression
  of a constructive dream capable of sustaining a great educational and
  philosophical movement such as no formula of Liberalism supplied. The fact
  that it readily took vulgar forms only witnessed to its strong popular
  appeal. Mixed in with the noisiness and humbug of the movement there appeared
  a real regard for social efficiency, a real spirit of animation and
  enterprise. There suddenly appeared in my world&mdash;I saw them first, I
  think, in 1908&mdash;a new sort of little boy, a most agreeable development
  of the slouching, cunning, cigarette-smoking, town-bred youngster, a small
  boy in a khaki hat, and with bare knees and athletic bearing, earnestly
  engaged in wholesome and invigorating games up to and occasionally a little
  beyond his strength&mdash;the Boy Scout. I liked the Boy Scout, and I find it
  difficult to express how much it mattered to me, with my growing bias in
  favour of deliberate national training, that Liberalism hadn't been able to
  produce, and had indeed never attempted to produce, anything of this
  kind.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">In those days there existed a dining club called&mdash;there
  was some lost allusion to the exorcism of party feeling in its
  title&mdash;the Pentagram Circle. It included Bailey and Dayton and myself,
  Sir Herbert Thorns, Lord Charles Kindling, Minns the poet, Gerbault the big
  railway man, Lord Gane, fresh from the settlement of Framboya, and Rumbold,
  who later became Home Secretary and left us. We were men of all parties and
  very various experiences, and our object was to discuss the welfare of the
  Empire in a disinterested spirit. We dined monthly at the Mermaid in
  Westminster, and for a couple of years we kept up an average attendance of
  ten out of fourteen. The dinner-time was given up to desultory conversation,
  and it is odd how warm and good the social atmosphere of that little
  gathering became as time went on; then over the dessert, so soon as the
  waiters had swept away the crumbs and ceased to fret us, one of us would open
  with perhaps fifteen or twenty minutes' exposition of some specially prepared
  question, and after him we would deliver ourselves in turn, each for three or
  four minutes. When every one present had spoken once talk became general
  again, and it was rare we emerged upon Hendon Street before midnight.
  Sometimes, as my house was conveniently near, a knot of men would come home
  with me and go on talking and smoking in my dining-room until two or three.
  We had Fred Neal, that wild Irish journalist, among us towards the end, and
  his stupendous flow of words materially prolonged our closing discussions and
  made our continuance impossible.</p>

  <p>I learned very much and very many things at those dinners, but more
  particularly did I become familiarised with the habits of mind of such men as
  Neal, Crupp, Gane, and the one or two other New Imperialists who belonged to
  us. They were nearly all like Bailey Oxford men, though mostly of a younger
  generation, and they were all mysteriously and inexplicably advocates of
  Tariff Reform, as if it were the principal instead of at best a secondary
  aspect of constructive policy. They seemed obsessed by the idea that streams
  of trade could be diverted violently so as to link the parts of the Empire by
  common interests, and they were persuaded, I still think mistakenly, that
  Tariff Reform would have an immense popular appeal. They were also very keen
  on military organisation, and with a curious little martinet twist in their
  minds that boded ill for that side of public liberty. So much against them.
  But they were disposed to spend money much more generously on education and
  research of all sorts than our formless host of Liberals seemed likely to do;
  and they were altogether more accessible than the Young Liberals to bold,
  constructive ideas affecting the universities and upper classes. The Liberals
  are abjectly afraid of the universities. I found myself constantly falling
  into line with these men in our discussions, and more and more hostile to
  Dayton's sentimentalising evasions of definite schemes and Minns' trust in
  such things as the "Spirit of our People" and the "General Trend of
  Progress." It wasn't that I thought them very much righter than their
  opponents; I believe all definite party "sides" at any time are bound to be
  about equally right and equally lop-sided; but that I thought I could get
  more out of them and what was more important to me, more out of myself if I
  co-operated with them. By 1908 I had already arrived at a point where I could
  be definitely considering a transfer of my political allegiance.</p>

  <p>These abstract questions are inseparably interwoven with my memory of a
  shining long white table, and our hock bottles and burgundy bottles, and
  bottles of Perrier and St. Galmier and the disturbed central trophy of
  dessert, and scattered glasses and nut-shells and cigarette-ends and
  menu-cards used for memoranda. I see old Dayton sitting back and cocking his
  eye to the ceiling in a way he had while he threw warmth into the ancient
  platitudes of Liberalism, and Minns leaning forward, and a little like a
  cockatoo with a taste for confidences, telling us in a hushed voice of his
  faith in the Destiny of Mankind. Thorns lounges, rolling his round face and
  round eyes from speaker to speaker and sounding the visible depths of misery
  whenever Neal begins. Gerbault and Gane were given to conversation in
  undertones, and Bailey pursued mysterious purposes in lisping whispers. It
  was Crupp attracted me most. He had, as people say, his eye on me from the
  beginning. He used to speak at me, and drifted into a custom of coming home
  with me very regularly for an after-talk.</p>

  <p>He opened his heart to me.</p>

  <p>"Neither of us," he said, "are dukes, and neither of us are horny-handed
  sons of toil. We want to get hold of the handles, and to do that, one must go
  where the power is, and give it just as constructive a twist as we can.
  That's <i>my</i> Toryism."</p>

  <p>"Is it Kindling's&mdash;or Gerbault's?"</p>

  <p>"No. But theirs is soft, and mine's hard. Mine will wear theirs out. You
  and I and Bailey are all after the same thing, and why aren't we working
  together?"</p>

  <p>"Are you a Confederate?" I asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"That's a secret nobody tells," he said.</p>

  <p>"What are the Confederates after?"</p>

  <p>"Making aristocracy work, I suppose. Just as, I gather, you want to
  do."...</p>

  <p>The Confederates were being heard of at that time. They were at once
  attractive and repellent to me, an odd secret society whose membership nobody
  knew, pledged, it was said, to impose Tariff Reform and an ample constructive
  policy upon the Conservatives. In the press, at any rate, they had an air of
  deliberately organised power. I have no doubt the rumour of them greatly
  influenced my ideas...</p>

  <p>In the end I made some very rapid decisions, but for nearly two years I
  was hesitating. Hesitations were inevitable in such a matter. I was not
  dealing with any simple question of principle, but with elusive and
  fluctuating estimates of the trend of diverse forces and of the nature of my
  own powers. All through that period I was asking over and over again: how far
  are these Confederates mere dreamers? How far&mdash;and this was more
  vital&mdash;are they rendering lip-service to social organisations? Is it
  true they desire war because it confirms the ascendency of their class? How
  far can Conservatism be induced to plan and construct before it resists the
  thrust towards change. Is it really in bulk anything more than a mass of
  prejudice and conceit, cynical indulgence, and a hard suspicion of and
  hostility to the expropriated classes in the community?</p>

  <p>That is a research which yields no statistics, an enquiry like asking what
  is the ruling colour of a chameleon. The shadowy answer varied with my
  health, varied with my mood and the conduct of the people I was watching. How
  fine can people be? How generous?&mdash;not incidentally, but all round? How
  far can you educate sons beyond the outlook of their fathers, and how far
  lift a rich, proud, self-indulgent class above the protests of its business
  agents and solicitors and its own habits and vanity? Is chivalry in a class
  possible?&mdash;was it ever, indeed, or will it ever indeed be possible? Is
  the progress that seems attainable in certain directions worth the
  retrogression that may be its price?</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">It was to the Pentagram Circle that I first broached the new
  conceptions that were developing in my mind. I count the evening of my paper
  the beginning of the movement that created <i>The Blue Weekly</i> and our
  wing of the present New Tory party. I do that without any excessive egotism,
  because my essay was no solitary man's production; it was my reaction to
  forces that had come to me very large through my fellow-members; its quick
  reception by them showed that I was, so to speak, merely the first of the
  chestnuts to pop. The atmospheric quality of the evening stands out very
  vividly in my memory. The night, I remember, was warmly foggy when after
  midnight we went to finish our talk at my house.</p>

  <p>We had recently changed the rules of the club to admit visitors, and so it
  happened that I had brought Britten, and Crupp introduced Arnold Shoesmith,
  my former schoolfellow at City Merchants, and now the wealthy successor of
  his father and elder brother. I remember his heavy, inexpressively handsome
  face lighting to his rare smile at the sight of me, and how little I dreamt
  of the tragic entanglement that was destined to involve us both. Gane was
  present, and Esmeer, a newly-added member, but I think Bailey was absent.
  Either he was absent, or he said something so entirely characteristic and
  undistinguished that it has left no impression on my mind.</p>

  <p>I had broken a little from the traditions of the club even in my title,
  which was deliberately a challenge to the liberal idea: it was, "The World
  Exists for Exceptional People." It is not the title I should choose
  now&mdash;for since that time I have got my phrase of "mental hinterlander"
  into journalistic use. I should say now, "The World Exists for Mental
  Hinterland."</p>

  <p>The notes I made of that opening have long since vanished with a thousand
  other papers, but some odd chance has preserved and brought with me to Italy
  the menu for the evening; its back black with the scrawled notes I made of
  the discussion for my reply. I found it the other day among some letters from
  Margaret and a copy of the 1909 Report of the Poor Law Commission, also rich
  with pencilled marginalia.</p>

  <p>My opening was a criticism of the democratic idea and method, upon lines
  such as I have already sufficiently indicated in the preceding sections. I
  remember how old Dayton fretted in his chair, and tushed and pished at that,
  even as I gave it, and afterwards we were treated to one of his platitudinous
  harangues, he sitting back in his chair with that small obstinate eye of his
  fixed on the ceiling, and a sort of cadaverous glow upon his face, repeating
  &mdash;quite regardless of all my reasoning and all that had been said by
  others in the debate&mdash;the sacred empty phrases that were his soul's
  refuge from reality. "You may think it very clever," he said with a nod of
  his head to mark his sense of his point, "not to Trust in the People. I do."
  And so on. Nothing in his life or work had ever shown that he did trust in
  the people, but that was beside the mark. He was the party Liberal, and these
  were the party incantations.</p>

  <p>After my preliminary attack on vague democracy I went on to show that all
  human life was virtually aristocratic; people must either recognise
  aristocracy in general or else follow leaders, which is aristocracy in
  particular, and so I came to my point that the reality of human progress lay
  necessarily through the establishment of freedoms for the human best and a
  collective receptivity and understanding. There was a disgusted grunt from
  Dayton, "Superman rubbish&mdash;Nietzsche. Shaw! Ugh!" I sailed on over him
  to my next propositions. The prime essential in a progressive civilisation
  was the establishment of a more effective selective process for the privilege
  of higher education, and the very highest educational opportunity for the
  educable. We were too apt to patronise scholarship winners, as though a
  scholarship was toffee given as a reward for virtue. It wasn't any reward at
  all; it was an invitation to capacity. We had no more right to drag in
  virtue, or any merit but quality, than we had to involve it in a search for
  the tallest man. We didn't want a mere process for the selection of good as
  distinguished from gifted and able boys&mdash;"No, you DON'T," from
  Dayton&mdash;we wanted all the brilliant stuff in the world concentrated upon
  the development of the world. Just to exasperate Dayton further I put in a
  plea for gifts as against character in educational, artistic, and legislative
  work. "Good teaching," I said, "is better than good conduct. We are becoming
  idiotic about character."</p>

  <p>Dayton was too moved to speak. He slewed round upon me an eye of agonised
  aversion.</p>

  <p>I expatiated on the small proportion of the available ability that is
  really serving humanity to-day. "I suppose to-day all the thought, all the
  art, all the increments of knowledge that matter, are supplied so far as the
  English-speaking community is concerned by&mdash;how many?&mdash;by three or
  four thousand individuals. ('Less,' said Thorns.) To be more precise, by the
  mental hinterlands of three or four thousand individuals. We who know some of
  the band entertain no illusions as to their innate rarity. We know that they
  are just the few out of many, the few who got in our world of chance and
  confusion, the timely stimulus, the apt suggestion at the fortunate moment,
  the needed training, the leisure. The rest are lost in the crowd, fail
  through the defects of their qualities, become commonplace workmen and
  second-rate professional men, marry commonplace wives, are as much waste as
  the driftage of superfluous pollen in a pine forest is waste."</p>

  <p>"Decent honest lives!" said Dayton to his bread-crumbs, with his chin in
  his necktie. "WASTE!"</p>

  <p>"And the people who do get what we call opportunity get it usually in
  extremely limited and cramping forms. No man lives a life of intellectual
  productivity alone; he needs not only material and opportunity, but helpers,
  resonators. Round and about what I might call the REAL men, you want the
  sympathetic cooperators, who help by understanding. It isn't that
  our&mdash;SALT of three or four thousand is needlessly rare; it is sustained
  by far too small and undifferentiated a public. Most of the good men we know
  are not really doing the very best work of their gifts; nearly all are a
  little adapted, most are shockingly adapted to some second-best use. Now, I
  take it, this is the very centre and origin of the muddle, futility, and
  unhappiness that distresses us; it's the cardinal problem of the
  state&mdash;to discover, develop, and use the exceptional gifts of men. And I
  see that best done&mdash;I drift more and more away from the common stuff of
  legislative and administrative activity&mdash;by a quite revolutionary
  development of the educational machinery, but by a still more unprecedented
  attempt to keep science going, to keep literature going, and to keep what is
  the necessary spur of all science and literature, an intelligent and
  appreciative criticism going. You know none of these things have ever been
  kept going hitherto; they've come unexpectedly and inexplicably."</p>

  <p>"Hear, hear!" from Dayton, cough, nodding of the head, and an expression
  of mystical profundity.</p>

  <p>"They've lit up a civilisation and vanished, to give place to darkness
  again. Now the modern state doesn't mean to go back to darkness
  again&mdash;and so it's got to keep its light burning." I went on to attack
  the present organisation of our schools and universities, which seemed
  elaborately designed to turn the well-behaved, uncritical, and uncreative men
  of each generation into the authoritative leaders of the next, and I
  suggested remedies upon lines that I have already indicated in the earlier
  chapters of this story...</p>

  <p>So far I had the substance of the club with me, but I opened new ground
  and set Crupp agog by confessing my doubt from which party or combination of
  groups these developments of science and literature and educational
  organisation could most reasonably be expected. I looked up to find Crupp's
  dark little eye intent upon me.</p>

  <p>There I left it to them.</p>

  <p>We had an astonishingly good discussion; Neal burst once, but we emerged
  from his flood after a time, and Dayton had his interlude. The rest was all
  close, keen examination of my problem.</p>

  <p>I see Crupp now with his arm bent before him on the table in a way we had,
  as though it was jointed throughout its length like a lobster's antenna, his
  plump, short-fingered hand crushing up a walnut shell into smaller and
  smaller fragments. "Remington," he said, "has given us the data for a
  movement, a really possible movement. It's not only possible, but
  necessary&mdash;urgently necessary, I think, if the Empire is to go on."</p>

  <p>"We're working altogether too much at the social basement in education and
  training," said Gane. "Remington is right about our neglect of the higher
  levels."</p>

  <p>Britten made a good contribution with an analysis of what he called the
  spirit of a country and what made it. "The modern community needs its serious
  men to be artistic and its artists to be taken seriously," I remember his
  saying. "The day has gone by for either dull responsibility or merely witty
  art."</p>

  <p>I remember very vividly how Shoesmith harped on an idea I had thrown out
  of using some sort of review or weekly to express and elaborate these
  conceptions of a new, severer, aristocratic culture.</p>

  <p>"It would have to be done amazingly well," said Britten, and my mind went
  back to my school days and that ancient enterprise of ours, and how
  Cossington had rushed it. Well, Cossington had too many papers nowadays to
  interfere with us, and we perhaps had learnt some defensive devices.</p>

  <p>"But this thing has to be linked to some political party," said Crupp,
  with his eye on me. "You can't get away from that. The Liberals," he added,
  "have never done anything for research or literature."</p>

  <p>"They had a Royal Commission on the Dramatic Censorship," said Thorns,
  with a note of minute fairness. "It shows what they were made of," he
  added.</p>

  <p>"It's what I've told Remington again and again," said Crupp, "we've got to
  pick up the tradition of aristocracy, reorganise it, and make it work. But
  he's certainly suggested a method."</p>

  <p>"There won't be much aristocracy to pick up," said Dayton, darkly to the
  ceiling, "if the House of Lords throws out the Budget."</p>

  <p>"All the more reason for picking it up," said Neal. "For we can't do
  without it."</p>

  <p>"Will they go to the bad, or will they rise from the ashes, aristocrats
  indeed&mdash;if the Liberals come in overwhelmingly?" said Britten.</p>

  <p>"It's we who might decide that," said Crupp, insidiously.</p>

  <p>"I agree," said Gane.</p>

  <p>"No one can tell," said Thorns. "I doubt if they will get beaten."</p>

  <p>It was an odd, fragmentary discussion that night. We were all with ideas
  in our minds at once fine and imperfect. We threw out suggestions that showed
  themselves at once far inadequate, and we tried to qualify them by minor
  self-contradictions. Britten, I think, got more said than any one. "You all
  seem to think you want to organise people, particular groups and classes of
  individuals," he insisted. "It isn't that. That's the standing error of
  politicians. You want to organise a culture. Civilisation isn't a matter of
  concrete groupings; it's a matter of prevailing ideas. The problem is how to
  make bold, clear ideas prevail. The question for Remington and us is just
  what groups of people will most help this culture forward."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but how are the Lords going to behave?" said Crupp. "You yourself
  were asking that a little while ago."</p>

  <p>"If they win or if they lose," Gane maintained, "there will be a movement
  to reorganise aristocracy&mdash;Reform of the House of Lords, they'll call
  the political form of it."</p>

  <p>"Bailey thinks that," said some one.</p>

  <p>"The labour people want abolition," said some one. "Let 'em," said
  Thorns.</p>

  <p>He became audible, sketching a possibility of action.</p>

  <p>"Suppose all of us were able to work together. It's just one of those
  indeterminate, confused, eventful times ahead when a steady jet of ideas
  might produce enormous results."</p>

  <p>"Leave me out of it," said Dayton, "IF you please."</p>

  <p>"We should," said Thorns under his breath.</p>

  <p>I took up Crupp's initiative, I remember, and expanded it.</p>

  <p>"I believe we could do&mdash;extensive things," I insisted.</p>

  <p>"Revivals and revisions of Toryism have been tried so often," said Thorns,
  "from the Young England movement onward."</p>

  <p>"Not one but has produced its enduring effects," I said. "It's the
  peculiarity of English conservatism that it's persistently progressive and
  rejuvenescent."</p>

  <p>I think it must have been about that point that Dayton fled our presence,
  after some clumsy sentence that I decided upon reflection was intended to
  remind me of my duty to my party.</p>

  <p>Then I remember Thorns firing doubts at me obliquely across the table.
  "You can't run a country through its spoilt children," he said. "What you
  call aristocrats are really spoilt children. They've had too much of
  everything, except bracing experience."</p>

  <p>"Children can always be educated," said Crupp.</p>

  <p>"I said <i>spoilt</i> children," said Thorns.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Thorns!" said I. "If this Budget row leads to a storm, and
  these big people get their power clipped, what's going to happen? Have you
  thought of that? When they go out lock, stock, and barrel, who comes in?"</p>

  <p>"Nature abhors a Vacuum," said Crupp, supporting me.</p>

  <p>"Bailey's trained officials," suggested Gane.</p>

  <p>"Quacks with a certificate of approval from Altiora," said Thorns. "I
  admit the horrors of the alternative. There'd be a massacre in three
  years."</p>

  <p>"One may go on trying possibilities for ever," I said. "One thing emerges.
  Whatever accidents happen, our civilisation needs, and almost consciously
  needs, a culture of fine creative minds, and all the necessary tolerances,
  opennesses, considerations, that march with that. For my own part, I think
  that is the Most Vital Thing. Build your ship of state as you will; get your
  men as you will; I concentrate on what is clearly the affair of my sort of
  man,&mdash;I want to ensure the quality of the quarter deck."</p>

  <p>"Hear, hear!" said Shoesmith, suddenly&mdash;his first remark for a long
  time. "A first-rate figure," said Shoesmith, gripping it.</p>

  <p>"Our danger is in missing that," I went on. "Muddle isn't ended by
  transferring power from the muddle-headed few to the muddle-headed many, and
  then cheating the many out of it again in the interests of a bureaucracy of
  sham experts. But that seems the limit of the liberal imagination. There is
  no real progress in a country, except a rise in the level of its free
  intellectual activity. All other progress is secondary and dependant. If you
  take on Bailey's dreams of efficient machinery and a sort of fanatical
  discipline with no free-moving brains behind it, confused ugliness becomes
  rigid ugliness,&mdash;that's all. No doubt things are moving from looseness
  to discipline, and from irresponsible controls to organised
  controls&mdash;and also and rather contrariwise everything is becoming as
  people say, democratised; but all the more need in that, for an ark in which
  the living element may be saved."</p>

  <p>"Hear, hear!" said Shoesmith, faint but pursuing.</p>

  <p>It must have been in my house afterwards that Shoesmith became noticeable.
  He seemed trying to say something vague and difficult that he didn't get said
  at all on that occasion. "We could do immense things with a weekly," he
  repeated, echoing Neal, I think. And there he left off and became a mute
  expressiveness, and it was only afterwards, when I was in bed, that I saw we
  had our capitalist in our hands...</p>

  <p>We parted that night on my doorstep in a tremendous glow&mdash;but in that
  sort of glow one doesn't act upon without much reconsideration, and it was
  some months before I made my decision to follow up the indications of that
  opening talk.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">I find my thoughts lingering about the Pentagram Circle. In
  my developments it played a large part, not so much by starting new trains of
  thought as by confirming the practicability of things I had already
  hesitatingly entertained. Discussion with these other men so prominently
  involved in current affairs endorsed views that otherwise would have seemed
  only a little less remote from actuality than the guardians of Plato or the
  labour laws of More. Among other questions that were never very distant from
  our discussions, that came apt to every topic, was the true significance of
  democracy, Tariff Reform as a method of international hostility, and the
  imminence of war. On the first issue I can still recall little Bailey, glib
  and winking, explaining that democracy was really just a dodge for getting
  assent to the ordinances of the expert official by means of the polling
  booth. "If they don't like things," said he, "they can vote for the
  opposition candidate and see what happens then&mdash;and that, you see, is
  why we don't want proportional representation to let in the wild men." I
  opened my eyes&mdash;the lids had dropped for a moment under the caress of
  those smooth sounds&mdash;to see if Bailey's artful forefinger wasn't at the
  side of his predominant nose.</p>

  <p>The international situation exercised us greatly. Our meetings were
  pervaded by the feeling that all things moved towards a day of reckoning with
  Germany, and I was largely instrumental in keeping up the suggestion that
  India was in a state of unstable equilibrium, that sooner or later something
  must happen there&mdash;something very serious to our Empire. Dayton frankly
  detested these topics. He was full of that old Middle Victorian persuasion
  that whatever is inconvenient or disagreeable to the English mind could be
  annihilated by not thinking about it. He used to sit low in his chair and
  look mulish. "Militarism," he would declare in a tone of the utmost moral
  fervour, "is a curse. It's an unmitigated curse." Then he would cough shortly
  and twitch his head back and frown, and seem astonished beyond measure that
  after this conclusive statement we could still go on talking of war.</p>

  <p>All our Imperialists were obsessed by the thought of international
  conflict, and their influence revived for a time those uneasinesses that had
  been aroused in me for the first time by my continental journey with
  Willersley and by Meredith's "One of Our Conquerors." That quite justifiable
  dread of a punishment for all the slackness, mental dishonesty, presumption,
  mercenary respectability and sentimentalised commercialism of the Victorian
  period, at the hands of the better organised, more vigorous, and now far more
  highly civilised peoples of Central Europe, seemed to me to have both a good
  and bad series of consequences. It seemed the only thing capable of bracing
  English minds to education, sustained constructive effort and research; but
  on the other hand it produced the quality of a panic, hasty preparation,
  impatience of thought, a wasteful and sometimes quite futile immediacy. In
  1909, for example, there was a vast clamour for eight additional
  Dreadnoughts&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We want eight And we won't wait,"</p>

  <p>but no clamour at all about our national waste of inventive talent, our
  mean standard of intellectual attainment, our disingenuous criticism, and the
  consequent failure to distinguish men of the quality needed to carry on the
  modern type of war. Almost universally we have the wrong men in our places of
  responsibility and the right men in no place at all, almost universally we
  have poorly qualified, hesitating, and resentful subordinates, because our
  criticism is worthless and, so habitually as to be now almost unconsciously,
  dishonest. Germany is beating England in every matter upon which competition
  is possible, because she attended sedulously to her collective mind for sixty
  pregnant years, because in spite of tremendous defects she is still far more
  anxious for quality in achievement than we are. I remember saying that in my
  paper. From that, I remember, I went on to an image that had flashed into my
  mind. "The British Empire," I said, "is like some of those early vertebrated
  monsters, the Brontosaurus and the Atlantosaurus and such-like; it sacrifices
  intellect to character; its backbone, that is to say,&mdash;especially in the
  visceral region&mdash;is bigger than its cranium. It's no accident that
  things are so. We've worked for backbone. We brag about backbone, and if the
  joints are anchylosed so much the better. We're still but only half awake to
  our error. You can't change that suddenly."</p>

  <p>"Turn it round and make it go backwards," interjected Thorns.</p>

  <p>"It's trying to do that," I said, "in places."</p>

  <p>And afterwards Crupp declared I had begotten a nightmare which haunted him
  of nights; he was trying desperately and belatedly to blow a brain as one
  blows soap-bubbles on such a mezoroic saurian as I had conjured up, while the
  clumsy monster's fate, all teeth and brains, crept nearer and nearer...</p>

  <p>I've grown, I think, since those days out of the urgency of that
  apprehension. I still think a European war, and conceivably a very
  humiliating war for England, may occur at no very distant date, but I do not
  think there is any such heroic quality in our governing class as will make
  that war catastrophic. The prevailing spirit in English life&mdash;it is one
  of the essential secrets of our imperial endurance&mdash;is one of underbred
  aggression in prosperity and diplomatic compromise in moments of danger; we
  bully haughtily where we can and assimilate where we must. It is not for
  nothing that our upper and middle-class youth is educated by teachers of the
  highest character, scholars and gentlemen, men who can pretend quite honestly
  that Darwinism hasn't upset the historical fall of man, that cricket is moral
  training, and that Socialism is an outrage upon the teachings of Christ. A
  sort of dignified dexterity of evasion is the national reward. Germany, with
  a larger population, a vigorous and irreconcilable proletariat, a bolder
  intellectual training, a harsher spirit, can scarcely fail to drive us at
  last to a realisation of intolerable strain. So we may never fight at all.
  The war of preparations that has been going on for thirty years may end like
  a sham-fight at last in an umpire's decision. We shall proudly but very
  firmly take the second place. For my own part, since I love England as much
  as I detest her present lethargy of soul, I pray for a chastening war&mdash;I
  wouldn't mind her flag in the dirt if only her spirit would come out of it.
  So I was able to shake off that earlier fear of some final and irrevocable
  destruction truncating all my schemes. At the most, a European war would be a
  dramatic episode in the reconstruction I had in view.</p>

  <p>In India, too, I no longer foresee, as once I was inclined to see,
  disaster. The English rule in India is surely one of the most extraordinary
  accidents that has ever happened in history. We are there like a man who has
  fallen off a ladder on to the neck of an elephant, and doesn't know what to
  do or how to get down. Until something happens he remains. Our functions in
  India are absurd. We English do not own that country, do not even rule it. We
  make nothing happen; at the most we prevent things happening. We suppress our
  own literature there. Most English people cannot even go to this land they
  possess; the authorities would prevent it. If Messrs. Perowne or Cook
  organised a cheap tour of Manchester operatives, it would be stopped. No one
  dare bring the average English voter face to face with the reality of India,
  or let the Indian native have a glimpse of the English voter. In my time I
  have talked to English statesmen, Indian officials and ex-officials,
  viceroys, soldiers, every one who might be supposed to know what India
  signifies, and I have prayed them to tell me what they thought we were up to
  there. I am not writing without my book in these matters. And beyond a phrase
  or so about "even-handed justice"&mdash;and look at our sedition
  trials!&mdash;they told me nothing. Time after time I have heard of that
  apocryphal native ruler in the north-west, who, when asked what would happen
  if we left India, replied that in a week his men would be in the saddle, and
  in six months not a rupee nor a virgin would be left in Lower Bengal. That is
  always given as our conclusive justification. But is it our business to
  preserve the rupees and virgins of Lower Bengal in a sort of magic
  inconclusiveness? Better plunder than paralysis, better fire and sword than
  futility. Our flag is spread over the peninsula, without plans, without
  intentions&mdash;a vast preventive. The sum total of our policy is to arrest
  any discussion, any conferences that would enable the Indians to work out a
  tolerable scheme of the future for themselves. But that does not arrest the
  resentment of men held back from life. Consider what it must be for the
  educated Indian sitting at the feast of contemporary possibilities with his
  mouth gagged and his hands bound behind him! The spirit of insurrection
  breaks out in spite of espionage and seizures. Our conflict for inaction
  develops stupendous absurdities. The other day the British Empire was taking
  off and examining printed cotton stomach wraps for seditious emblems and
  inscriptions...</p>

  <p>In some manner we shall have to come out of India. We have had our chance,
  and we have demonstrated nothing but the appalling dulness of our national
  imagination. We are not good enough to do anything with India. Codger and
  Flack, and Gates and Dayton, Cladingbowl in the club, and <i>The Home
  Churchman</i> in the home, cant about "character," worship of strenuous force
  and contempt of truth; for the sake of such men and things as these, we must
  abandon in fact, if not in appearance, that empty domination. Had we great
  schools and a powerful teaching, could we boast great men, had we the spirit
  of truth and creation in our lives, then indeed it might be different. But a
  race that bears a sceptre must carry gifts to justify it.</p>

  <p>It does not follow that we shall be driven catastrophically from India.
  That was my earlier mistake. We are not proud enough in our bones to be
  ruined by India as Spain was by her empire. We may be able to abandon India
  with an air of still remaining there. It is our new method. We train our
  future rulers in the public schools to have a very wholesome respect for
  strength, and as soon as a power arises in India in spite of us, be it a man
  or a culture, or a native state, we shall be willing to deal with it. We may
  or may not have a war, but our governing class will be quick to learn when we
  are beaten. Then they will repeat our South African diplomacy, and arrange
  for some settlement that will abandon the reality, such as it is, and
  preserve the semblance of power. The conqueror DE FACTO will become the new
  "loyal Briton," and the democracy at home will be invited to celebrate our
  recession&mdash;triumphantly. I am no believer in the imminent dissolution of
  our Empire; I am less and less inclined to see in either India or Germany the
  probability of an abrupt truncation of those slow intellectual and moral
  constructions which are the essentials of statecraft.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">I sit writing in this little loggia to the sound of dripping
  water &mdash;this morning we had rain, and the roof of our little casa is
  still not dry, there are pools in the rocks under the sweet chestnuts, and
  the torrent that crosses the salita is full and boastful,&mdash;and I try to
  recall the order of my impressions during that watching, dubious time, before
  I went over to the Conservative Party. I was trying&mdash;chaotic
  task&mdash;to gauge the possibilities inherent in the quality of the British
  aristocracy. There comes a broad spectacular effect of wide parks,
  diversified by woods and bracken valleys, and dappled with deer; of great
  smooth lawns shaded by ancient trees; of big facades of sunlit buildings
  dominating the country side; of large fine rooms full of handsome,
  easy-mannered people. As a sort of representative picture to set off against
  those other pictures of Liberals and of Socialists I have given, I recall one
  of those huge assemblies the Duchess of Clynes inaugurated at Stamford House.
  The place itself is one of the vastest private houses in London, a huge
  clustering mass of white and gold saloons with polished floors and wonderful
  pictures, and staircases and galleries on a Gargantuan scale. And there she
  sought to gather all that was most representative of English activities, and
  did, in fact, in those brilliant nocturnal crowds, get samples of nearly
  every section of our social and intellectual life, with a marked predominance
  upon the political and social side.</p>

  <p>I remember sitting in one of the recesses at the end of the big saloon
  with Mrs. Redmondson, one of those sharp-minded, beautiful rich women one
  meets so often in London, who seem to have done nothing and to be capable of
  everything, and we watched the crowd&mdash;uniforms and splendours were
  streaming in from a State ball&mdash;and exchanged information. I told her
  about the politicians and intellectuals, and she told me about the
  aristocrats, and we sharpened our wit on them and counted the percentage of
  beautiful people among the latter, and wondered if the general effect of
  tallness was or was not an illusion.</p>

  <p>They were, we agreed, for the most part bigger than the average of people
  in London, and a handsome lot, even when they were not subtly individualised.
  "They look so well nurtured," I said, "well cared for. I like their quiet,
  well-trained movements, their pleasant consideration for each other."</p>

  <p>"Kindly, good tempered, and at bottom utterly selfish," she said, "like
  big, rather carefully trained, rather pampered children. What else can you
  expect from them?"</p>

  <p>"They are good tempered, anyhow," I witnessed, "and that's an achievement.
  I don't think I could ever be content under a bad-tempered, sentimentalism,
  strenuous Government. That's why I couldn't stand the Roosevelt <i>regime</i>
  in America. One's chief surprise when one comes across these big people for
  the first time is their admirable easiness and a real personal modesty. I
  confess I admire them. Oh! I like them. I wouldn't at all mind, I believe,
  giving over the country to this aristocracy&mdash;given SOMETHING&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which they haven't got."</p>

  <p>"Which they haven't got&mdash;or they'd be the finest sort of people in
  the world."</p>

  <p>"That something?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I've been puzzling my wits to know. They've done all sorts
  of things&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's Lord Wrassleton," she interrupted, "whose leg was broken&mdash;you
  remember?&mdash;at Spion Kop."</p>

  <p>"It's healed very well. I like the gold lace and the white glove resting,
  with quite a nice awkwardness, on the sword. When I was a little boy I wanted
  to wear clothes like that. And the stars! He's got the V. C. Most of these
  people here have at any rate shown pluck, you know&mdash;brought something
  off."</p>

  <p>"Not quite enough," she suggested.</p>

  <p>"I think that's it," I said. "Not quite enough&mdash;not quite hard
  enough," I added.</p>

  <p>She laughed and looked at me. "You'd like to make us," she said.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Hard."</p>

  <p>"I don't think you'll go on if you don't get hard."</p>

  <p>"We shan't be so pleasant if we do."</p>

  <p>"Well, there my puzzled wits come in again. I don't see why an aristocracy
  shouldn't be rather hard trained, and yet kindly. I'm not convinced that the
  resources of education are exhausted. I want to better this, because it
  already looks so good."</p>

  <p>"How are we to do it?" asked Mrs. Redmondson.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there you have me! I've been spending my time lately in trying to
  answer that! It makes me quarrel with"&mdash;I held up my fingers and ticked
  the items off&mdash;"the public schools, the private tutors, the army exams,
  the Universities, the Church, the general attitude of the country towards
  science and literature&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We all do," said Mrs. Redmondson. "We can't begin again at the
  beginning," she added.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't one," I nodded at the assembly in general, start a movement?</p>

  <p>"There's the Confederates," she said, with a faint smile that masked a
  gleam of curiosity... "You want," she said, "to say to the aristocracy, 'Be
  aristocrats. <i>Noblesse oblige.</i>' Do you remember what happened to the
  monarch who was told to 'Be a King'?"</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "I want an aristocracy."</p>

  <p>"This," she said, smiling, "is the pick of them. The backwoodsmen are off
  the stage. These are the brilliant ones&mdash;the smart and the blues... They
  cost a lot of money, you know."</p>

  <p>So far Mrs. Redmondson, but the picture remained full of things not stated
  in our speech. They were on the whole handsome people, charitable minded,
  happy, and easy. They led spacious lives, and there was something free and
  fearless about their bearing that I liked extremely. The women particularly
  were wide-reading, fine-thinking. Mrs. Redmondson talked as fully and widely
  and boldly as a man, and with those flashes of intuition, those startling,
  sudden delicacies of perception few men display. I liked, too, the relations
  that held between women and men, their general tolerance, their antagonism to
  the harsh jealousies that are the essence of the middle-class order...</p>

  <p>After all, if one's aim resolved itself into the development of a type and
  culture of men, why shouldn't one begin at this end?</p>

  <p>It is very easy indeed to generalise about a class or human beings, but
  much harder to produce a sample. Was old Lady Forthundred, for instance,
  fairly a sample? I remember her as a smiling, magnificent presence, a
  towering accumulation of figure and wonderful shimmering blue silk and black
  lace and black hair, and small fine features and chins and chins and chins,
  disposed in a big cane chair with wraps and cushions upon the great terrace
  of Champneys. Her eye was blue and hard, and her accent and intonation were
  exactly what you would expect from a rather commonplace dressmaker pretending
  to be aristocratic. I was, I am afraid, posing a little as the intelligent
  but respectful inquirer from below investigating the great world, and she was
  certainly posing as my informant. She affected a cynical coarseness. She
  developed a theory on the governance of England, beautifully frank and
  simple. "Give 'um all a peerage when they get twenty thousand a year," she
  maintained. "That's my remedy."</p>

  <p>In my new role of theoretical aristocrat I felt a little abashed.</p>

  <p>"Twenty thousand," she repeated with conviction.</p>

  <p>It occurred to me that I was in the presence of the aristocratic theory
  currently working as distinguished from my as yet unformulated
  intentions.</p>

  <p>"You'll get a lot of loafers and scamps among 'um," said Lady Forthundred.
  "You get loafers and scamps everywhere, but you'll get a lot of men who'll
  work hard to keep things together, and that's what we're all after, isn't
  ut?</p>

  <p>"It's not an ideal arrangement."</p>

  <p>"Tell me anything better," said Lady Forthundred.</p>

  <p>On the whole, and because she refused emphatically to believe in
  education, Lady Forthundred scored.</p>

  <p>We had been discussing Cossington's recent peerage, for Cossington, my old
  schoolfellow at City Merchants', and my victor in the affair of the magazine,
  had clambered to an amazing wealth up a piled heap of energetically pushed
  penny and halfpenny magazines, and a group of daily newspapers. I had
  expected to find the great lady hostile to the new-comer, but she accepted
  him, she gloried in him.</p>

  <p>"We're a peerage," she said, "but none of us have ever had any nonsense
  about nobility."</p>

  <p>She turned and smiled down on me. "We English," she said, "are a practical
  people. We assimilate 'um."</p>

  <p>"Then, I suppose, they don't give trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Then they don't give trouble."</p>

  <p>"They learn to shoot?"</p>

  <p>"And all that," said Lady Forthundred. "Yes. And things go on. Sometimes
  better than others, but they go on&mdash;somehow. It depends very much on the
  sort of butler who pokes 'um about."</p>

  <p>I suggested that it might be possible to get a secure twenty thousand a
  year by at least detrimental methods&mdash;socially speaking.</p>

  <p>"We must take the bad and the good of 'um," said Lady Forthundred,
  courageously...</p>

  <p>Now, was she a sample? It happened she talked. What was there in the
  brains of the multitude of her first, second, third, fourth, and fifth
  cousins, who didn't talk, who shone tall, and bearing themselves finely,
  against a background of deft, attentive maids and valets, on every spacious
  social scene? How did things look to them?</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">Side by side with Lady Forthundred, it is curious to put
  Evesham with his tall, bent body, his little-featured almost elvish face, his
  unequal mild brown eyes, his gentle manner, his sweet, amazing oratory. He
  led all these people wonderfully. He was always curious and interested about
  life, wary beneath a pleasing frankness&mdash;and I tormented my brain to get
  to the bottom of him. For a long time he was the most powerful man in England
  under the throne; he had the Lords in his hand, and a great majority in the
  Commons, and the discontents and intrigues that are the concomitants of an
  overwhelming party advantage broke against him as waves break against a
  cliff. He foresaw so far in these matters that it seemed he scarcely troubled
  to foresee. He brought political art to the last triumph of naturalness.
  Always for me he has been the typical aristocrat, so typical and above the
  mere forms of aristocracy, that he remained a commoner to the end of his
  days.</p>

  <p>I had met him at the beginning of my career; he read some early papers of
  mine, and asked to see me, and I conceived a flattered liking for him that
  strengthened to a very strong feeling indeed. He seemed to me to stand alone
  without an equal, the greatest man in British political life. Some men one
  sees through and understands, some one cannot see into or round because they
  are of opaque clay, but about Evesham I had a sense of things hidden as it
  were by depth and mists, because he was so big and atmospheric a personality.
  No other contemporary has had that effect upon me. I've sat beside him at
  dinners, stayed in houses with him&mdash;he was in the big house party at
  Champneys&mdash;talked to him, sounded him, watching him as I sat beside him.
  I could talk to him with extraordinary freedom and a rare sense of being
  understood. Other men have to be treated in a special manner; approached
  through their own mental dialect, flattered by a minute regard for what they
  have said and done. Evesham was as widely and charitably receptive as any man
  I have ever met. The common politicians beside him seemed like rows of stuffy
  little rooms looking out upon the sea.</p>

  <p>And what was he up to? What did <i>he</i> think we were doing with
  Mankind? That I thought worth knowing.</p>

  <p>I remember his talking on one occasion at the Hartsteins', at a dinner so
  tremendously floriferous and equipped that we were almost forced into
  duologues, about the possible common constructive purpose in politics.</p>

  <p>"I feel so much," he said, "that the best people in every party converge.
  We don't differ at Westminster as they do in the country towns. There's a
  sort of extending common policy that goes on under every government, because
  on the whole it's the right thing to do, and people know it. Things that used
  to be matters of opinion become matters of science&mdash;and cease to be
  party questions."</p>

  <p>He instanced education.</p>

  <p>"Apart," said I, "from the religious question."</p>

  <p>"Apart from the religious question."</p>

  <p>He dropped that aspect with an easy grace, and went on with his general
  theme that political conflict was the outcome of uncertainty. "Directly you
  get a thing established, so that people can say, 'Now this is Right,' with
  the same conviction that people can say water is a combination of oxygen and
  hydrogen, there's no more to be said. The thing has to be done..."</p>

  <p>And to put against this effect of Evesham, broad and humanely tolerant,
  posing as the minister of a steadily developing constructive conviction,
  there are other memories.</p>

  <p>Have I not seen him in the House, persistent, persuasive, indefatigable,
  and by all my standards wickedly perverse, leaning over the table with those
  insistent movements of his hand upon it, or swaying forward with a grip upon
  his coat lapel, fighting with a diabolical skill to preserve what are in
  effect religious tests, tests he must have known would outrage and humiliate
  and injure the consciences of a quarter&mdash;and that perhaps the best
  quarter&mdash;of the youngsters who come to the work of elementary
  education?</p>

  <p>In playing for points in the game of party advantage Evesham displayed at
  times a quite wicked unscrupulousness in the use of his subtle mind. I would
  sit on the Liberal benches and watch him, and listen to his urbane voice,
  fascinated by him. Did he really care? Did anything matter to him? And if it
  really mattered nothing, why did he trouble to serve the narrowness and
  passion of his side? Or did he see far beyond my scope, so that this petty
  iniquity was justified by greater, remoter ends of which I had no
  intimation?</p>

  <p>They accused him of nepotism. His friends and family were certainly well
  cared for. In private life he was full of an affectionate intimacy; he
  pleased by being charmed and pleased. One might think at times there was no
  more of him than a clever man happily circumstanced, and finding an interest
  and occupation in politics. And then came a glimpse of thought, of
  imagination, like the sight of a soaring eagle through a staircase skylight.
  Oh, beyond question he was great! No other contemporary politician had his
  quality. In no man have I perceived so sympathetically the great contrast
  between warm, personal things and the white dream of statecraft. Except that
  he had it seemed no hot passions, but only interests and fine affections and
  indolences, he paralleled the conflict of my life. He saw and thought widely
  and deeply; but at times it seemed to me his greatness stood over and behind
  the reality of his life, like some splendid servant, thinking his own
  thoughts, who waits behind a lesser master's chair...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 8</h3>

  <p class="first">Of course, when Evesham talked of this ideal of the
  organised state becoming so finely true to practicability and so clearly
  stated as to have the compelling conviction of physical science, he spoke
  quite after my heart. Had he really embodied the attempt to realise that, I
  could have done no more than follow him blindly. But neither he nor I
  embodied that, and there lies the gist of my story. And when it came to a
  study of others among the leading Tories and Imperialists the doubt
  increased, until with some at last it was possible to question whether they
  had any imaginative conception of constructive statecraft at all; whether
  they didn't opaquely accept the world for what it was, and set themselves
  single-mindedly to make a place for themselves and cut a figure in it.</p>

  <p>There were some very fine personalities among them: there were the great
  peers who had administered Egypt, India, South Africa, Framboya&mdash;Cromer,
  Kitchener, Curzon, Milner, Gane, for example. So far as that easier task of
  holding sword and scales had gone, they had shown the finest qualities, but
  they had returned to the perplexing and exacting problem of the home country,
  a little glorious, a little too simply bold. They wanted to arm and they
  wanted to educate, but the habit of immediate necessity made them far more
  eager to arm than to educate, and their experience of heterogeneous controls
  made them overrate the need for obedience in a homogeneous country. They
  didn't understand raw men, ill-trained men, uncertain minds, and intelligent
  women; and these are the things that matter in England... There were also the
  great business adventurers, from Cranber to Cossington (who was now Lord
  Paddockhurst). My mind remained unsettled, and went up and down the scale
  between a belief in their far-sighted purpose and the perception of crude
  vanities, coarse ambitions, vulgar competitiveness, and a mere habitual
  persistence in the pursuit of gain. For a time I saw a good deal of
  Cossington&mdash;I wish I had kept a diary of his talk and gestures, to mark
  how he could vary from day to day between a POSEUR, a smart tradesman, and a
  very bold and wide-thinking political schemer. He had a vanity of sweeping
  actions, motor car pounces, Napoleonic rushes, that led to violent
  ineffectual changes in the policy of his papers, and a haunting pursuit by
  parallel columns in the liberal press that never abashed him in the slightest
  degree. By an accident I plumbed the folly in him&mdash;but I feel I never
  plumbed his wisdom. I remember him one day after a lunch at the Barhams'
  saying suddenly, out of profound meditation over the end of a cigar, one of
  those sentences that seem to light the whole interior being of a man. "Some
  day," he said softly, rather to himself than to me, and A PROPOS of
  nothing&mdash;"some day I will raise the country."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" I said, after a pause, and leant across him for the little
  silver spirit-lamp, to light my cigarette...</p>

  <p>Then the Tories had for another section the ancient creations, and again
  there were the financial peers, men accustomed to reserve, and their big
  lawyers, accustomed to&mdash;well, qualified statement. And below the giant
  personalities of the party were the young bloods, young, adventurous men of
  the type of Lord Tarvrille, who had seen service in South Africa, who had
  travelled and hunted; explorers, keen motorists, interested in aviation,
  active in army organisation. Good, brown-faced stuff they were, but
  impervious to ideas outside the range of their activities, more ignorant of
  science than their chaffeurs, and of the quality of English people than welt-
  politicians; contemptuous of school and university by reason of the Gateses
  and Flacks and Codgers who had come their way, witty, light-hearted,
  patriotic at the Kipling level, with a certain aptitude for bullying. They
  varied in insensible gradations between the noble sportsmen on the one hand,
  and men like Gane and the Tories of our Pentagram club on the other. You
  perceive how a man might exercise his mind in the attempt to strike an
  average of public serviceability in this miscellany! And mixed up with these,
  mixed up sometimes in the same man, was the pure reactionary, whose
  predominant idea was that the village schools should confine themselves to
  teaching the catechism, hat-touching and courtesying, and be given a holiday
  whenever beaters were in request...</p>

  <p>I find now in my mind as a sort of counterpoise to Evesham the figure of
  old Lord Wardingham, asleep in the largest armchair in the library of
  Stamford Court after lunch. One foot rested on one of those things&mdash;I
  think they are called gout stools. He had been playing golf all the morning
  and wearied a weak instep; at lunch he had sat at my table and talked in the
  overbearing manner permitted to irascible important men whose insteps are
  painful. Among other things he had flouted the idea that women would ever
  understand statecraft or be more than a nuisance in politics, denied flatly
  that Hindoos were capable of anything whatever except excesses in population,
  regretted he could not censor picture galleries and circulating libraries,
  and declared that dissenters were people who pretended to take theology
  seriously with the express purpose of upsetting the entirely satisfactory
  compromise of the Established Church. "No sensible people, with anything to
  gain or lose, argue about religion," he said. "They mean mischief." Having
  delivered his soul upon these points, and silenced the little conversation to
  the left of him from which they had arisen, he became, after an appreciative
  encounter with a sanguinary woodcock, more amiable, responded to some
  respectful initiatives of Crupp's, and related a number of classical
  anecdotes of those blighting snubs, vindictive retorts and scandalous
  miscarriages of justice that are so dear to the forensic mind. Now he
  reposed. He was breathing heavily with his mouth a little open and his head
  on one side. One whisker was turned back against the comfortable padding. His
  plump strong hands gripped the arms of his chair, and his frown was a little
  assuaged. How tremendously fed up he looked! Honours, wealth, influence,
  respect, he had them all. How scornful and hard it had made his unguarded
  expression!</p>

  <p>I note without comment that it didn't even occur to me then to wake him up
  and ask him what <i>he</i> was up to with mankind.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 9</h3>

  <p class="first">One countervailing influence to my drift to Toryism in those
  days was Margaret's quite religious faith in the Liberals. I realised that
  slowly and with a mild astonishment. It set me, indeed, even then questioning
  my own change of opinion. We came at last incidentally, as our way was, to an
  exchange of views. It was as nearly a quarrel as we had before I came over to
  the Conservative side. It was at Champneys, and I think during the same visit
  that witnessed my exploration of Lady Forthundred. It arose indirectly, I
  think, out of some comments of mine upon our fellow-guests, but it is one of
  those memories of which the scene and quality remain more vivid than the
  things said, a memory without any very definite beginning or end. It was
  afternoon, in the pause between tea and the dressing bell, and we were in
  Margaret's big silver-adorned, chintz-bright room, looking out on the trim
  Italian garden... Yes, the beginning of it has escaped me altogether, but I
  remember it as an odd exceptional little wrangle.</p>

  <p>At first we seem to have split upon the moral quality of the aristocracy,
  and I had an odd sense that in some way too feminine for me to understand our
  hostess had aggrieved her. She said, I know, that Champneys distressed her;
  made her "eager for work and reality again."</p>

  <p>"But aren't these people real?"</p>

  <p>"They're so superficial, so extravagant!"</p>

  <p>I said I was not shocked by their unreality. They seemed the least
  affected people I had ever met. "And are they really so extravagant?" I
  asked, and put it to her that her dresses cost quite as much as any other
  woman's in the house.</p>

  <p>"It's not only their dresses," Margaret parried. "It's the scale and
  spirit of things."</p>

  <p>I questioned that. "They're cynical," said Margaret, staring before her
  out of the window.</p>

  <p>I challenged her, and she quoted the Brabants, about whom there had been
  an ancient scandal. She'd heard of it from Altiora, and it was also Altiora
  who'd given her a horror of Lord Carnaby, who was also with us. "You know his
  reputation," said Margaret. "That Normandy girl. Every one knows about it. I
  shiver when I look at him. He seems&mdash;oh! like something not of
  <i>our</i> civilisation. He <i>will</i> come and say little things to
  me."</p>

  <p>"Offensive things?"</p>

  <p>"No, politenesses and things. Of course his manners are&mdash;quite right.
  That only makes it worse, I think. It shows he might have helped&mdash;all
  that happened. I do all I can to make him see I don't like him. But none of
  the others make the slightest objection to him."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps these people imagine something might be said for him."</p>

  <p>"That's just it," said Margaret.</p>

  <p>"Charity," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"I don't like that sort of toleration."</p>

  <p>I was oddly annoyed. "Like eating with publicans and sinners," I said.
  "No! ..."</p>

  <p>But scandals, and the contempt for rigid standards their condonation
  displayed, weren't more than the sharp edge of the trouble. "It's their whole
  position, their selfish predominance, their class conspiracy against the mass
  of people," said Margaret. "When I sit at dinner in that splendid room, with
  its glitter and white reflections and candlelight, and its flowers and its
  wonderful service and its candelabra of solid gold, I seem to feel the slums
  and the mines and the over-crowded cottages stuffed away under the
  table."</p>

  <p>I reminded Margaret that she was not altogether innocent of unearned
  increment.</p>

  <p>"But aren't we doing our best to give it back?" she said.</p>

  <p>I was moved to question her. "Do you really think," I asked, "that the
  Tories and peers and rich people are to blame for social injustice as we have
  it to-day? Do you really see politics as a struggle of light on the Liberal
  side against darkness on the Tory?"</p>

  <p>"They MUST know," said Margaret.</p>

  <p>I found myself questioning that. I see now that to Margaret it must have
  seemed the perversest carping against manifest things, but at the time I was
  concentrated simply upon the elucidation of her view and my own; I wanted to
  get at her conception in the sharpest, hardest lines that were possible. It
  was perfectly clear that she saw Toryism as the diabolical element in
  affairs. The thing showed in its hopeless untruth all the clearer for the
  fine, clean emotion with which she gave it out to me. My sleeping peer in the
  library at Stamford Court and Evesham talking luminously behind the Hartstein
  flowers embodied the devil, and my replete citizen sucking at his cigar in
  the National Liberal Club, Willie Crampton discussing the care and management
  of the stomach over a specially hygienic lemonade, and Dr. Tumpany in his
  aggressive frock-coat pegging out a sort of copyright in Socialism, were the
  centre and wings of the angelic side. It was nonsense. But how was I to put
  the truth to her?</p>

  <p>"I don't see things at all as you do," I said. "I don't see things in the
  same way."</p>

  <p>"Think of the poor," said Margaret, going off at a tangent.</p>

  <p>"Think of every one," I said. "We Liberals have done more mischief through
  well-intentioned benevolence than all the selfishness in the world could have
  done. We built up the liquor interest."</p>

  <p>"WE!" cried Margaret. "How can you say that? It's against us."</p>

  <p>"Naturally. But we made it a monopoly in our clumsy efforts to prevent
  people drinking what they liked, because it interfered with industrial
  regularity&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" cried Margaret, stung; and I could see she thought I was talking
  mere wickedness.</p>

  <p>"That's it," I said.</p>

  <p>"But would you have people drink whatever they pleased?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. What right have I to dictate to other men and women?"</p>

  <p>"But think of the children!"</p>

  <p>"Ah! there you have the folly of modern Liberalism, its half-cunning,
  half-silly way of getting at everything in a roundabout fashion. If
  neglecting children is an offence, and it IS an offence, then deal with it as
  such, but don't go badgering and restricting people who sell something that
  may possibly in some cases lead to a neglect of children. If drunkenness is
  an offence, punish it, but don't punish a man for selling honest drink that
  perhaps after all won't make any one drunk at all. Don't intensify the
  viciousness of the public-house by assuming the place isn't fit for women and
  children. That's either spite or folly. Make the public-house FIT for women
  and children. Make it a real public-house. If we Liberals go on as we are
  going, we shall presently want to stop the sale of ink and paper because
  those things tempt men to forgery. We do already threaten the privacy of the
  post because of betting tout's letters. The drift of all that kind of thing
  is narrow, unimaginative, mischievous, stupid..."</p>

  <p>I stopped short and walked to the window and surveyed a pretty fountain,
  facsimile of one in Verona, amidst trim-cut borderings of yew. Beyond, and
  seen between the stems of ilex trees, was a great blaze of yellow
  flowers...</p>

  <p>"But prevention," I heard Margaret behind me, "is the essence of our
  work."</p>

  <p>I turned. "There's no prevention but education. There's no antiseptics in
  life but love and fine thinking. Make people fine, make fine people. Don't be
  afraid. These Tory leaders are better people individually than the average;
  why cast them for the villains of the piece? The real villain in the
  piece&mdash;in the whole human drama&mdash;is the muddle-headedness, and it
  matters very little if it's virtuous-minded or wicked. I want to get at
  muddle-headedness. If I could do that I could let all that you call
  wickedness in the world run about and do what it jolly well pleased. It would
  matter about as much as a slightly neglected dog&mdash;in an otherwise well-
  managed home."</p>

  <p>My thoughts had run away with me.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand you," said Margaret, in the profoundest distress. "I
  can't understand how it is you are coming to see things like this."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 10</h3>

  <p class="first">The moods of a thinking man in politics are curiously
  evasive and difficult to describe. Neither the public nor the historian will
  permit the statesman moods. He has from the first to assume he has an Aim, a
  definite Aim, and to pretend to an absolute consistency with that. Those
  subtle questionings about the very fundamentals of life which plague us all
  so relentlessly nowadays are supposed to be silenced. He lifts his chin and
  pursues his Aim explicitly in the sight of all men. Those who have no real
  political experience can scarcely imagine the immense mental and moral strain
  there is between one's everyday acts and utterances on the one hand and the
  "thinking-out" process on the other. It is perplexingly difficult to keep in
  your mind, fixed and firm, a scheme essentially complex, to keep balancing a
  swaying possibility while at the same time under jealous, hostile, and stupid
  observation you tread your part in the platitudinous, quarrelsome,
  ill-presented march of affairs...</p>

  <p>The most impossible of all autobiographies is an intellectual
  autobiography. I have thrown together in the crudest way the elements of the
  problem I struggled with, but I can give no record of the subtle details; I
  can tell nothing of the long vacillations between Protean values, the talks
  and re-talks, the meditations, the bleak lucidities of sleepless
  nights...</p>

  <p>And yet these things I have struggled with must be thought out, and, to
  begin with, they must be thought out in this muddled, experimenting way. To
  go into a study to think about statecraft is to turn your back on the
  realities you are constantly needing to feel and test and sound if your
  thinking is to remain vital; to choose an aim and pursue it in despite of all
  subsequent questionings is to bury the talent of your mind. It is no use
  dealing with the intricate as though it were simple, to leap haphazard at the
  first course of action that presents itself; the whole world of politicians
  is far too like a man who snatches a poker to a failing watch. It is easy to
  say he wants to "get something done," but the only sane thing to do for the
  moment is to put aside that poker and take thought and get a better
  implement...</p>

  <p>One of the results of these fundamental preoccupations of mine was a
  curious irritability towards Margaret that I found difficult to conceal. It
  was one of the incidental cruelties of our position that this should happen.
  I was in such doubt myself, that I had no power to phrase things for her in a
  form she could use. Hitherto I had stage-managed our "serious" conversations.
  Now I was too much in earnest and too uncertain to go on doing this. I
  avoided talk with her. Her serene, sustained confidence in vague formulae and
  sentimental aspirations exasperated me; her want of sympathetic apprehension
  made my few efforts to indicate my changing attitudes distressing and futile.
  It wasn't that I was always thinking right, and that she was always saying
  wrong. It was that I was struggling to get hold of a difficult thing that
  was, at any rate, half true, I could not gauge how true, and that Margaret's
  habitual phrasing ignored these elusive elements of truth, and without
  premeditation fitted into the weaknesses of my new intimations, as though
  they had nothing but weaknesses. It was, for example, obvious that these big
  people, who were the backbone of Imperialism and Conservatism, were
  temperamentally lax, much more indolent, much more sensuous, than our
  deliberately virtuous Young Liberals. I didn't want to be reminded of that,
  just when I was in full effort to realise the finer elements in their
  composition. Margaret classed them and disposed of them. It was our incurable
  differences in habits and gestures of thought coming between us again.</p>

  <p>The desert of misunderstanding widened. I was forced back upon myself and
  my own secret councils. For a time I went my way alone; an unmixed evil for
  both of us. Except for that Pentagram evening, a series of talks with Isabel
  Rivers, who was now becoming more and more important in my intellectual life,
  and the arguments I maintained with Crupp, I never really opened my mind at
  all during that period of indecisions, slow abandonments, and slow
  acquisitions.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap3_03"
     name="chap3_03"></a>III. &mdash; SECESSION</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">At last, out of a vast accumulation of impressions, decision
  distilled quite suddenly. I succumbed to Evesham and that dream of the right
  thing triumphant through expression. I determined I would go over to the
  Conservatives, and use my every gift and power on the side of such forces on
  that side as made for educational reorganisation, scientific research,
  literature, criticism, and intellectual development. That was in 1909. I
  judged the Tories were driving straight at a conflict with the country, and I
  thought them bound to incur an electoral defeat. I under-estimated their
  strength in the counties. There would follow, I calculated, a period of
  profound reconstruction in method and policy alike. I was entirely at one
  with Crupp in perceiving in this an immense opportunity for the things we
  desired. An aristocracy quickened by conflict and on the defensive, and full
  of the idea of justification by reconstruction, might prove altogether more
  apt for thought and high professions than Mrs. Redmondson's spoilt children.
  Behind the now inevitable struggle for a reform of the House of Lords, there
  would be great heart searchings and educational endeavour. On that we
  reckoned...</p>

  <p>At last we talked it out to the practical pitch, and Crupp and Shoesmith,
  and I and Gane, made our definite agreement together...</p>

  <p>I emerged from enormous silences upon Margaret one evening.</p>

  <p>She was just back from the display of some new musicians at the
  Hartsteins. I remember she wore a dress of golden satin, very rich-looking
  and splendid. About her slender neck there was a rope of gold-set amber
  beads. Her hair caught up and echoed and returned these golden notes. I, too,
  was in evening dress, but where I had been escapes me,&mdash;some forgotten
  dinner, I suppose. I went into her room. I remember I didn't speak for some
  moments. I went across to the window and pulled the blind aside, and looked
  out upon the railed garden of the square, with its shrubs and shadowed turf
  gleaming pallidly and irregularly in the light of the big electric standard
  in the corner.</p>

  <p>"Margaret," I said, "I think I shall break with the party."</p>

  <p>She made no answer. I turned presently, a movement of enquiry.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid you meant to do that," she said.</p>

  <p>"I'm out of touch," I explained. "Altogether."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I know."</p>

  <p>"It places me in a difficult position," I said.</p>

  <p>Margaret stood at her dressing-table, looking steadfastly at herself in
  the glass, and with her fingers playing with a litter of stoppered bottles of
  tinted glass. "I was afraid it was coming to this," she said.</p>

  <p>"In a way," I said, "we've been allies. I owe my seat to you. I couldn't
  have gone into Parliament..."</p>

  <p>"I don't want considerations like that to affect us," she interrupted.</p>

  <p>There was a pause. She sat down in a chair by her dressing-table, lifted
  an ivory hand-glass, and put it down again.</p>

  <p>"I wish," she said, with something like a sob in her voice, "it were
  possible that you shouldn't do this." She stopped abruptly, and I did not
  look at her, because I could feel the effort she was making to control
  herself.</p>

  <p>"I thought," she began again, "when you came into Parliament&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There came another silence. "It's all gone so differently," she said.
  "Everything has gone so differently."</p>

  <p>I had a sudden memory of her, shining triumphant after the Kinghampstead
  election, and for the first time I realised just how perplexing and
  disappointing my subsequent career must have been to her.</p>

  <p>"I'm not doing this without consideration," I said.</p>

  <p>"I know," she said, in a voice of despair, "I've seen it coming. But
  &mdash;I still don't understand it. I don't understand how you can go
  over."</p>

  <p>"My ideas have changed and developed," I said.</p>

  <p>I walked across to her bearskin hearthrug, and stood by the mantel.</p>

  <p>"To think that you," she said; "you who might have been leader&mdash;" She
  could not finish it. "All the forces of reaction," she threw out.</p>

  <p>"I don't think they are the forces of reaction," I said. "I think I can
  find work to do&mdash;better work on that side."</p>

  <p>"Against us!" she said. "As if progress wasn't hard enough! As if it
  didn't call upon every able man!"</p>

  <p>"I don't think Liberalism has a monopoly of progress."</p>

  <p>She did not answer that. She sat quite still looking in front of her.
  "<i>Why</i> have you gone over?" she asked abruptly as though I had said
  nothing.</p>

  <p>There came a silence that I was impelled to end. I began a stiff
  dissertation from the hearthrug. "I am going over, because I think I may join
  in an intellectual renascence on the Conservative side. I think that in the
  coming struggle there will be a partial and altogether confused and
  demoralising victory for democracy, that will stir the classes which now
  dominate the Conservative party into an energetic revival. They will set out
  to win back, and win back. Even if my estimate of contemporary forces is
  wrong and they win, they will still be forced to reconstruct their outlook. A
  war abroad will supply the chastening if home politics fail. The effort at
  renascence is bound to come by either alternative. I believe I can do more in
  relation to that effort than in any other connexion in the world of politics
  at the present time. That's my case, Margaret."</p>

  <p>She certainly did not grasp what I said. "And so you will throw aside all
  the beginnings, all the beliefs and pledges&mdash;" Again her sentence
  remained incomplete. "I doubt if even, once you have gone over, they will
  welcome you."</p>

  <p>"That hardly matters."</p>

  <p>I made an effort to resume my speech.</p>

  <p>"I came into Parliament, Margaret," I said, "a little prematurely. Still
  &mdash;I suppose it was only by coming into Parliament that I could see
  things as I do now in terms of personality and imaginative range..." I
  stopped. Her stiff, unhappy, unlistening silence broke up my
  disquisition.</p>

  <p>"After all," I remarked, "most of this has been implicit in my
  writings."</p>

  <p>She made no sign of admission.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Keep my seat for a time and make the reasons of my breach clear. Then
  either I must resign or&mdash;probably this new Budget will lead to a General
  Election. It's evidently meant to strain the Lords and provoke a
  quarrel."</p>

  <p>"You might, I think, have stayed to fight for the Budget."</p>

  <p>"I'm not," I said, "so keen against the Lords."</p>

  <p>On that we halted.</p>

  <p>"But what are you going to do?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I shall make my quarrel over some points in the Budget. I can't quite
  tell you yet where my chance will come. Then I shall either resign my seat
  &mdash;or if things drift to dissolution I shall stand again."</p>

  <p>"It's political suicide."</p>

  <p>"Not altogether."</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine you out of Parliament again. It's just like&mdash;like
  undoing all we have done. What will you do?"</p>

  <p>"Write. Make a new, more definite place for myself. You know, of course,
  there's already a sort of group about Crupp and Gane."</p>

  <p>Margaret seemed lost for a time in painful thought.</p>

  <p>"For me," she said at last, "our political work has been a religion
  &mdash;it has been more than a religion."</p>

  <p>I heard in silence. I had no form of protest available against the
  implications of that.</p>

  <p>"And then I find you turning against all we aimed to do&mdash;talking of
  going over, almost lightly&mdash;to those others."...</p>

  <p>She was white-lipped as she spoke. In the most curious way she had
  captured the moral values of the situation. I found myself protesting
  ineffectually against her fixed conviction. "It's because I think my duty
  lies in this change that I make it," I said.</p>

  <p>"I don't see how you can say that," she replied quietly.</p>

  <p>There was another pause between us.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she said and clenched her hand upon the table. "That it should have
  come to this!"</p>

  <p>She was extraordinarily dignified and extraordinarily absurd. She was hurt
  and thwarted beyond measure. She had no place in her ideas, I thought, for
  me. I could see how it appeared to her, but I could not make her see anything
  of the intricate process that had brought me to this divergence. The
  opposition of our intellectual temperaments was like a gag in my mouth. What
  was there for me to say? A flash of intuition told me that behind her white
  dignity was a passionate disappointment, a shattering of dreams that needed
  before everything else the relief of weeping.</p>

  <p>"I've told you," I said awkwardly, "as soon as I could."</p>

  <p>There was another long silence. "So that is how we stand," I said with an
  air of having things defined. I walked slowly to the door.</p>

  <p>She had risen and stood now staring in front of her.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," I said, making no movement towards our habitual kiss.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," she answered in a tragic note...</p>

  <p>I closed the door softly. I remained for a moment or so on the big
  landing, hesitating between my bedroom and my study. As I did so I heard the
  soft rustle of her movement and the click of the key in her bedroom door.
  Then everything was still...</p>

  <p>She hid her tears from me. Something gripped my heart at the thought.</p>

  <p>"Damnation!" I said wincing. "Why the devil can't people at least
  <i>think</i> in the same manner?"</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">And that insufficient colloquy was the beginning of a
  prolonged estrangement between us. It was characteristic of our relations
  that we never reopened the discussion. The thing had been in the air for some
  time; we had recognised it now; the widening breach between us was confessed.
  My own feelings were curiously divided. It is remarkable that my very real
  affection for Margaret only became evident to me with this quarrel. The
  changes of the heart are very subtle changes. I am quite unaware how or when
  my early romantic love for her purity and beauty and high-principled devotion
  evaporated from my life; but I do know that quite early in my parliamentary
  days there had come a vague, unconfessed resentment at the tie that seemed to
  hold me in servitude to her standards of private living and public act. I
  felt I was caught, and none the less so because it had been my own act to
  rivet on my shackles. So long as I still held myself bound to her that
  resentment grew. Now, since I had broken my bonds and taken my line it
  withered again, and I could think of Margaret with a returning
  kindliness.</p>

  <p>But I still felt embarrassment with her. I felt myself dependent upon her
  for house room and food and social support, as it were under false pretences.
  I would have liked to have separated our financial affairs altogether. But I
  knew that to raise the issue would have seemed a last brutal indelicacy. So I
  tried almost furtively to keep my personal expenditure within the scope of
  the private income I made by writing, and we went out together in her motor
  brougham, dined and made appearances, met politely at breakfast&mdash;parted
  at night with a kiss upon her cheek. The locking of her door upon me, which
  at that time I quite understood, which I understand now, became for a time in
  my mind, through some obscure process of the soul, an offence. I never
  crossed the landing to her room again.</p>

  <p>In all this matter, and, indeed, in all my relations with Margaret, I
  perceive now I behaved badly and foolishly. My manifest blunder is that I,
  who was several years older than she, much subtler and in many ways wiser,
  never in any measure sought to guide and control her. After our marriage I
  treated her always as an equal, and let her go her way; held her responsible
  for all the weak and ineffective and unfortunate things she said and did to
  me. She wasn't clever enough to justify that. It wasn't fair to expect her to
  sympathise, anticipate, and understand. I ought to have taken care of her,
  roped her to me when it came to crossing the difficult places. If I had loved
  her more, and wiselier and more tenderly, if there had not been the
  consciousness of my financial dependence on her always stiffening my pride, I
  think she would have moved with me from the outset, and left the Liberals
  with me. But she did not get any inkling of the ends I sought in my change of
  sides. It must have seemed to her inexplicable perversity. She had, I
  knew&mdash;for surely I knew it then&mdash;an immense capacity for loyalty
  and devotion. There she was with these treasures untouched, neglected and
  perplexed. A woman who loves wants to give. It is the duty and business of
  the man she has married for love to help her to help and give. But I was
  stupid. My eyes had never been opened. I was stiff with her and difficult to
  her, because even on my wedding morning there had been, deep down in my soul,
  voiceless though present, something weakly protesting, a faint perception of
  wrong-doing, the infinitesimally small, slow-multiplying germs of
  shame.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">I made my breach with the party on the Budget.</p>

  <p>In many ways I was disposed to regard the 1909 Budget as a fine piece of
  statecraft. Its production was certainly a very unexpected display of vigour
  on the Liberal side. But, on the whole, this movement towards collectivist
  organisation on the part of the Liberals rather strengthened than weakened my
  resolve to cross the floor of the house. It made it more necessary, I
  thought, to leaven the purely obstructive and reactionary elements that were
  at once manifest in the opposition. I assailed the land taxation proposals in
  one main speech, and a series of minor speeches in committee. The line of
  attack I chose was that the land was a great public service that needed to be
  controlled on broad and far-sighted lines. I had no objection to its
  nationalisation, but I did object most strenuously to the idea of leaving it
  in private hands, and attempting to produce beneficial social results through
  the pressure of taxation upon the land-owning class. That might break it up
  in an utterly disastrous way. The drift of the government proposals was all
  in the direction of sweating the landowner to get immediate values from his
  property, and such a course of action was bound to give us an irritated and
  vindictive land-owning class, the class upon which we had hitherto
  relied&mdash;not unjustifiably&mdash;for certain broad, patriotic services
  and an influence upon our collective judgments that no other class seemed
  prepared to exercise. Abolish landlordism if you will, I said, buy it out,
  but do not drive it to a defensive fight, and leave it still sufficiently
  strong and wealthy to become a malcontent element in your state. You have
  taxed and controlled the brewer and the publican until the outraged Liquor
  Interest has become a national danger. You now propose to do the same thing
  on a larger scale. You turn a class which has many fine and truly
  aristocratic traditions towards revolt, and there is nothing in these or any
  other of your proposals that shows any sense of the need for leadership to
  replace these traditional leaders you are ousting. This was the substance of
  my case, and I hammered at it not only in the House, but in the press...</p>

  <p>The Kinghampstead division remained for some time insensitive to my
  defection.</p>

  <p>Then it woke up suddenly, and began, in the columns of <i>The
  Kingshampstead Guardian</i>, an indignant, confused outcry. I was treated to
  an open letter, signed "Junius Secundus," and I replied in provocative terms.
  There were two thinly attended public meetings at different ends of the
  constituency, and then I had a correspondence with my old friend Parvill, the
  photographer, which ended in my seeing a deputation.</p>

  <p>My impression is that it consisted of about eighteen or twenty people.
  They had had to come upstairs to me and they were manifestly full of
  indignation and a little short of breath. There was Parvill himself, J.P.,
  dressed wholly in black&mdash;I think to mark his sense of the occasion
  &mdash;and curiously suggestive in his respect for my character and his
  concern for the honourableness of <i>The Kinghampstead Guardian</i> editor,
  of Mark Antony at the funeral of Caesar. There was Mrs. Bulger, also in
  mourning; she had never abandoned the widow's streamers since the death of
  her husband ten years ago, and her loyalty to Liberalism of the severest type
  was part as it were of her weeds. There was a nephew of Sir Roderick Newton,
  a bright young Hebrew of the graver type, and a couple of dissenting
  ministers in high collars and hats that stopped halfway between the bowler of
  this world and the shovel-hat of heaven. There was also a young solicitor
  from Lurky done in the horsey style, and there was a very little nervous man
  with a high brow and a face contracting below as though the jawbones and
  teeth had been taken out and the features compressed. The rest of the
  deputation, which included two other public-spirited ladies and several
  ministers of religion, might have been raked out of any omnibus going
  Strandward during the May meetings. They thrust Parvill forward as spokesman,
  and manifested a strong disposition to say "Hear, hear!" to his more
  strenuous protests provided my eye wasn't upon them at the time.</p>

  <p>I regarded this appalling deputation as Parvill's apologetic but quite
  definite utterances drew to an end. I had a moment of vision. Behind them I
  saw the wonderful array of skeleton forces that stand for public opinion,
  that are as much public opinion as exists indeed at the present time. The
  whole process of politics which bulks so solidly in history seemed for that
  clairvoyant instant but a froth of petty motives above abysms of
  indifference...</p>

  <p>Some one had finished. I perceived I had to speak.</p>

  <p>"Very well," I said, "I won't keep you long in replying. I'll resign if
  there isn't a dissolution before next February, and if there is I shan't
  stand again. You don't want the bother and expense of a bye-election
  (approving murmurs) if it can be avoided. But I may tell you plainly now that
  I don't think it will be necessary for me to resign, and the sooner you find
  my successor the better for the party. The Lords are in a corner; they've got
  to fight now or never, and I think they will throw out the Budget. Then they
  will go on fighting. It is a fight that will last for years. They have a sort
  of social discipline, and you haven't. You Liberals will find yourselves with
  a country behind you, vaguely indignant perhaps, but totally unprepared with
  any ideas whatever in the matter, face to face with the problem of bringing
  the British constitution up-to-date. Anything may happen, provided only that
  it is sufficiently absurd. If the King backs the Lords&mdash;and I don't see
  why he shouldn't&mdash;you have no Republican movement whatever to fall back
  upon. You lost it during the Era of Good Taste. The country, I say, is
  destitute of ideas, and you have no ideas to give it. I don't see what you
  will do... For my own part, I mean to spend a year or so between a window and
  my writingdesk."</p>

  <p>I paused. "I think, gentlemen," began Parvill, "that we hear all this with
  very great regret..."</p><br>

  <p class="first">My estrangement from Margaret stands in my memory now as
  something that played itself out within the four walls of our house in Radnor
  Square, which was, indeed, confined to those limits. I went to and fro
  between my house and the House of Commons, and the dining-rooms and clubs and
  offices in which we were preparing our new developments, in a state of
  aggressive and energetic dissociation, in the nascent state, as a chemist
  would say. I was free now, and greedy for fresh combination. I had a
  tremendous sense of released energies. I had got back to the sort of thing I
  could do, and to the work that had been shaping itself for so long in my
  imagination. Our purpose now was plain, bold, and extraordinarily congenial.
  We meant no less than to organise a new movement in English thought and life,
  to resuscitate a Public Opinion and prepare the ground for a revised and
  renovated ruling culture.</p>

  <p>For a time I seemed quite wonderfully able to do whatever I wanted to do.
  Shoesmith responded to my first advances. We decided to create a weekly paper
  as our nucleus, and Crupp and I set to work forthwith to collect a group of
  writers and speakers, including Esmeer, Britten, Lord Gane, Neal, and one or
  two younger men, which should constitute a more or less definite editorial
  council about me, and meet at a weekly lunch on Tuesday to sustain our
  general co-operations. We marked our claim upon Toryism even in the colour of
  our wrapper, and spoke of ourselves collectively as the Blue Weeklies. But
  our lunches were open to all sorts of guests, and our deliberations were
  never of a character to control me effectively in my editorial decisions. My
  only influential councillor at first was old Britten, who became my
  sub-editor. It was curious how we two had picked up our ancient intimacy
  again and resumed the easy give and take of our speculative dreaming
  schoolboy days.</p>

  <p>For a time my life centred altogether upon this journalistic work. Britten
  was an experienced journalist, and I had most of the necessary instincts for
  the business. We meant to make the paper right and good down to the smallest
  detail, and we set ourselves at this with extraordinary zeal. It wasn't our
  intention to show our political motives too markedly at first, and through
  all the dust storm and tumult and stress of the political struggle of 1910,
  we made a little intellectual oasis of good art criticism and good writing.
  It was the firm belief of nearly all of us that the Lords were destined to be
  beaten badly in 1910, and our game was the longer game of reconstruction that
  would begin when the shouting and tumult of that immediate conflict were
  over. Meanwhile we had to get into touch with just as many good minds as
  possible.</p>

  <p>As we felt our feet, I developed slowly and carefully a broadly conceived
  and consistent political attitude. As I will explain later, we were feminist
  from the outset, though that caused Shoesmith and Gane great searching of
  heart; we developed Esmeer's House of Lords reform scheme into a general cult
  of the aristocratic virtues, and we did much to humanise and liberalise the
  narrow excellencies of that Break-up of the Poor Law agitation, which had
  been organised originally by Beatrice and Sidney Webb. In addition, without
  any very definite explanation to any one but Esmeer and Isabel Rivers, and as
  if it was quite a small matter, I set myself to secure a uniform
  philosophical quality in our columns.</p>

  <p>That, indeed, was the peculiar virtue and characteristic of <i>The Blue
  Weekly</i>. I was now very definitely convinced that much of the confusion
  and futility of contemporary thought was due to the general need of
  metaphysical training... The great mass of people&mdash;and not simply common
  people, but people active and influential in intellectual things&mdash;are
  still quite untrained in the methods of thought and absolutely innocent of
  any criticism of method; it is scarcely a caricature to call their thinking a
  crazy patchwork, discontinuous and chaotic. They arrive at conclusions by a
  kind of accident, and do not suspect any other way may be found to their
  attainment. A stage above this general condition stands that minority of
  people who have at some time or other discovered general terms and a certain
  use for generalisations. They are&mdash;to fall back on the ancient
  technicality&mdash;Realists of a crude sort. When I say Realist of course I
  mean Realist as opposed to Nominalist, and not Realist in the almost
  diametrically different sense of opposition to Idealist. Such are the
  Baileys; such, to take their great prototype, was Herbert Spencer (who
  couldn't read Kant); such are whole regiments of prominent and entirely
  self-satisfied contemporaries. They go through queer little processes of
  definition and generalisation and deduction with the completest belief in the
  validity of the intellectual instrument they are using. They are
  Realists&mdash;Cocksurists&mdash;in matter of fact; sentimentalists in
  behaviour. The Baileys having got to this glorious stage in mental
  development&mdash;it is glorious because it has no doubts&mdash;were always
  talking about training "Experts" to apply the same simple process to all the
  affairs of mankind. Well, Realism isn't the last word of human wisdom.
  Modest-minded people, doubtful people, subtle people, and the like&mdash;the
  kind of people William James writes of as "tough-minded," go on beyond this
  methodical happiness, and are forever after critical of premises and terms.
  They are truer&mdash;and less confident. They have reached scepticism and the
  artistic method. They have emerged into the new Nominalism.</p>

  <p>Both Isabel and I believe firmly that these differences of intellectual
  method matter profoundly in the affairs of mankind, that the collective mind
  of this intricate complex modern state can only function properly upon neo-
  Nominalist lines. This has always been her side of our mental co-operation
  rather than mine. Her mind has the light movement that goes so often with
  natural mental power; she has a wonderful art in illustration, and, as the
  reader probably knows already, she writes of metaphysical matters with a rare
  charm and vividness. So far there has been no collection of her papers
  published, but they are to be found not only in <i>The Blue Weekly</i>
  columns but scattered about the monthlies; many people must be familiar with
  her style. It was an intention we did much to realise before our private
  downfall, that we would use <i>The Blue Weekly</i> to maintain a stream of
  suggestion against crude thinking, and at last scarcely a week passed but
  some popular distinction, some large imposing generalisation, was touched to
  flaccidity by her pen or mine...</p>

  <p>I was at great pains to give my philosophical, political, and social
  matter the best literary and critical backing we could get in London. I
  hunted sedulously for good descriptive writing and good criticism; I was
  indefatigable in my readiness to hear and consider, if not to accept advice;
  I watched every corner of the paper, and had a dozen men alert to get me
  special matter of the sort that draws in the unattached reader. The chief
  danger on the literary side of a weekly is that it should fall into the hands
  of some particular school, and this I watched for closely. It seems
  impossible to get vividness of apprehension and breadth of view together in
  the same critic. So it falls to the wise editor to secure the first and
  impose the second. Directly I detected the shrill partisan note in our
  criticism, the attempt to puff a poor thing because it was "in the right
  direction," or damn a vigorous piece of work because it wasn't, I tackled the
  man and had it out with him. Our pay was good enough for that to matter a
  good deal...</p>

  <p>Our distinctive little blue and white poster kept up its neat persistent
  appeal to the public eye, and before 1911 was out, <i>The Blue Weekly</i> was
  printing twenty pages of publishers' advertisements, and went into all the
  clubs in London and three-quarters of the country houses where week-end
  parties gather together. Its sale by newsagents and bookstalls grew steadily.
  One got more and more the reassuring sense of being discussed, and
  influencing discussion.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Our office was at the very top of a big building near the
  end of Adelphi Terrace; the main window beside my desk, a big undivided
  window of plate glass, looked out upon Cleopatra's Needle, the corner of the
  Hotel Cecil, the fine arches of Waterloo Bridge, and the long sweep of south
  bank with its shot towers and chimneys, past Bankside to the dimly seen piers
  of the great bridge below the Tower. The dome of St. Paul's just floated into
  view on the left against the hotel facade. By night and day, in every light
  and atmosphere, it was a beautiful and various view, alive as a throbbing
  heart; a perpetual flow of traffic ploughed and splashed the streaming silver
  of the river, and by night the shapes of things became velvet black and grey,
  and the water a shining mirror of steel, wearing coruscating gems of light.
  In the foreground the Embankment trams sailed glowing by, across the water
  advertisements flashed and flickered, trains went and came and a rolling
  drift of smoke reflected unseen fires. By day that spectacle was sometimes a
  marvel of shining wet and wind-cleared atmosphere, sometimes a mystery of
  drifting fog, sometimes a miracle of crowded details, minutely fine.</p>

  <p>As I think of that view, so variously spacious in effect, I am back there,
  and this sunlit paper might be lamp-lit and lying on my old desk. I see it
  all again, feel it all again. In the foreground is a green shaded lamp and
  crumpled galley slips and paged proofs and letters, two or three papers in
  manuscript, and so forth. In the shadows are chairs and another table bearing
  papers and books, a rotating bookcase dimly seen, a long window seat black in
  the darkness, and then the cool unbroken spectacle of the window. How often I
  would watch some tram-car, some string of barges go from me slowly out of
  sight. The people were black animalculae by day, clustering, collecting,
  dispersing, by night, they were phantom face-specks coming, vanishing,
  stirring obscurely between light and shade.</p>

  <p>I recall many hours at my desk in that room before the crisis came, hours
  full of the peculiar happiness of effective strenuous work. Once some piece
  of writing went on, holding me intent and forgetful of time until I looked up
  from the warm circle of my electric lamp to see the eastward sky above the
  pale silhouette of the Tower Bridge, flushed and banded brightly with the
  dawn.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap3_04"
     name="chap3_04"></a>IV. &mdash; THE BESETTING OF SEX</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">Art is selection and so is most autobiography. But I am
  concerned with a more tangled business than selection, I want to show a
  contemporary man in relation to the state and social usage, and the social
  organism in relation to that man. To tell my story at all I have to simplify.
  I have given now the broad lines of my political development, and how I
  passed from my initial liberal-socialism to the conception of a constructive
  aristocracy. I have tried to set that out in the form of a man discovering
  himself. Incidentally that self-development led to a profound breach with my
  wife. One has read stories before of husband and wife speaking severally two
  different languages and coming to an understanding. But Margaret and I began
  in her dialect, and, as I came more and more to use my own, diverged.</p>

  <p>I had thought when I married that the matter of womankind had ended for
  me. I have tried to tell all that sex and women had been to me up to my
  married life with Margaret and our fatal entanglement, tried to show the
  queer, crippled, embarrassed and limited way in which these interests break
  upon the life of a young man under contemporary conditions. I do not think my
  lot was a very exceptional one. I missed the chance of sisters and girl
  playmates, but that is not an uncommon misadventure in an age of small
  families; I never came to know any woman at all intimately until I was
  married to Margaret. My earlier love affairs were encounters of sex, under
  conditions of furtiveness and adventure that made them things in themselves,
  restricted and unilluminating. From a boyish disposition to be mystical and
  worshipping towards women I had passed into a disregardful attitude, as
  though women were things inferior or irrelevant, disturbers in great affairs.
  For a time Margaret had blotted out all other women; she was so different and
  so near; she was like a person who stands suddenly in front of a little
  window through which one has been surveying a crowd. She didn't become
  womankind for me so much as eliminate womankind from my world... And then
  came this secret separation...</p>

  <p>Until this estrangement and the rapid and uncontrollable development of my
  relations with Isabel which chanced to follow it, I seemed to have solved the
  problem of women by marriage and disregard. I thought these things were over.
  I went about my career with Margaret beside me, her brow slightly knit, her
  manner faintly strenuous, helping, helping; and if we had not altogether
  abolished sex we had at least so circumscribed and isolated it that it would
  not have affected the general tenor of our lives in the slightest degree if
  we had.</p>

  <p>And then, clothing itself more and more in the form of Isabel and her
  problems, this old, this fundamental obsession of my life returned. The thing
  stole upon my mind so that I was unaware of its invasion and how it was
  changing our long intimacy. I have already compared the lot of the modern
  publicist to Machiavelli writing in his study; in his day women and sex were
  as disregarded in these high affairs as, let us say, the chemistry of air or
  the will of the beasts in the fields; in ours the case has altogether
  changed, and woman has come now to stand beside the tall candles, half in the
  light, half in the mystery of the shadows, besetting, interrupting, demanding
  unrelentingly an altogether unprecedented attention. I feel that in these
  matters my life has been almost typical of my time. Woman insists upon her
  presence. She is no longer a mere physical need, an aesthetic bye-play, a
  sentimental background; she is a moral and intellectual necessity in a man's
  life. She comes to the politician and demands, Is she a child or a citizen?
  Is she a thing or a soul? She comes to the individual man, as she came to me
  and asks, Is she a cherished weakling or an equal mate, an unavoidable
  helper? Is she to be tried and trusted or guarded and controlled, bond or
  free? For if she is a mate, one must at once trust more and exact more,
  exacting toil, courage, and the hardest, most necessary thing of all, the
  clearest, most shameless, explicitness of understanding...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">In all my earlier imaginings of statecraft I had tacitly
  assumed either that the relations of the sexes were all right or that anyhow
  they didn't concern the state. It was a matter they, whoever "they" were, had
  to settle among themselves. That sort of disregard was possible then. But
  even before 1906 there were endless intimations that the dams holding back
  great reservoirs of discussion were crumbling. We political schemers were
  ploughing wider than any one had ploughed before in the field of social
  reconstruction. We had also, we realised, to plough deeper. We had to plough
  down at last to the passionate elements of sexual relationship and examine
  and decide upon them.</p>

  <p>The signs multiplied. In a year or so half the police of the metropolis
  were scarce sufficient to protect the House from one clamorous aspect of the
  new problem. The members went about Westminster with an odd, new sense of
  being beset. A good proportion of us kept up the pretence that the Vote for
  Women was an isolated fad, and the agitation an epidemic madness that would
  presently pass. But it was manifest to any one who sought more than comfort
  in the matter that the streams of women and sympathisers and money
  forthcoming marked far deeper and wider things than an idle fancy for the
  franchise. The existing laws and conventions of relationship between Man and
  Woman were just as unsatisfactory a disorder as anything else in our tumbled
  confusion of a world, and that also was coming to bear upon statecraft.</p>

  <p>My first parliament was the parliament of the Suffragettes. I don't
  propose to tell here of that amazing campaign, with its absurdities and
  follies, its courage and devotion. There were aspects of that unquenchable
  agitation that were absolutely heroic and aspects that were absolutely
  pitiful. It was unreasonable, unwise, and, except for its one central
  insistence, astonishingly incoherent. It was amazingly effective. The very
  incoherence of the demand witnessed, I think, to the forces that lay behind
  it. It wasn't a simple argument based on a simple assumption; it was the
  first crude expression of a great mass and mingling of convergent feelings,
  of a widespread, confused persuasion among modern educated women that the
  conditions of their relations with men were oppressive, ugly, dishonouring,
  and had to be altered. They had not merely adopted the Vote as a symbol of
  equality; it was fairly manifest to me that, given it, they meant to use it,
  and to use it perhaps even vindictively and blindly, as a weapon against many
  things they had every reason to hate...</p>

  <p>I remember, with exceptional vividness, that great night early in the
  session of 1909, when&mdash;I think it was&mdash;fifty or sixty women went to
  prison. I had been dining at the Barham's, and Lord Barham and I came down
  from the direction of St. James's Park into a crowd and a confusion outside
  the Caxton Hall. We found ourselves drifting with an immense multitude
  towards Parliament Square and parallel with a silent, close-packed column of
  girls and women, for the most part white-faced and intent. I still remember
  the effect of their faces upon me. It was quite different from the general
  effect of staring about and divided attention one gets in a political
  procession of men. There was an expression of heroic tension.</p>

  <p>There had been a pretty deliberate appeal on the part of the women's
  organisers to the Unemployed, who had been demonstrating throughout that
  winter, to join forces with the movement, and the result was shown in the
  quality of the crowd upon the pavement. It was an ugly, dangerous-looking
  crowd, but as yet good-tempered and sympathetic. When at last we got within
  sight of the House the square was a seething seat of excited people, and the
  array of police on horse and on foot might have been assembled for a
  revolutionary outbreak. There were dense masses of people up Whitehall, and
  right on to Westminster Bridge. The scuffle that ended in the arrests was the
  poorest explosion to follow such stupendous preparations...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Later on in that year the women began a new attack. Day and
  night, and all through the long nights of the Budget sittings, at all the
  piers of the gates of New Palace Yard and at St. Stephen's Porch, stood women
  pickets, and watched us silently and reproachfully as we went to and fro.
  They were women of all sorts, though, of course, the independent worker-class
  predominated. There were grey-headed old ladies standing there, sturdily
  charming in the rain; battered-looking, ambiguous women, with something of
  the desperate bitterness of battered women showing in their eyes;
  north-country factory girls; cheaply-dressed suburban women; trim,
  comfortable mothers of families; valiant-eyed girl graduates and
  undergraduates; lank, hungry-looking creatures, who stirred one's
  imagination; one very dainty little woman in deep mourning, I recall, grave
  and steadfast, with eyes fixed on distant things. Some of those women looked
  defiant, some timidly aggressive, some full of the stir of adventure, some
  drooping with cold and fatigue. The supply never ceased. I had a mortal fear
  that somehow the supply might halt or cease. I found that continual siege of
  the legislature extraordinarily impressive&mdash;infinitely more impressive
  than the feeble-forcible "ragging" of the more militant section. I thought of
  the appeal that must be going through the country, summoning the women from
  countless scattered homes, rooms, colleges, to Westminster.</p>

  <p>I remember too the petty little difficulty I felt whether I should ignore
  these pickets altogether, or lift a hat as I hurried past with averted eyes,
  or look them in the face as I did so. Towards the end the House evoked an
  etiquette of salutation.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">There was a tendency, even on the part of its sympathisers,
  to treat the whole suffrage agitation as if it were a disconnected issue,
  irrelevant to all other broad developments of social and political life. We
  struggled, all of us, to ignore the indicating finger it thrust out before
  us. "Your schemes, for all their bigness," it insisted to our reluctant,
  averted minds, "still don't go down to the essential things..."</p>

  <p>We have to go deeper, or our inadequate children's insufficient children
  will starve amidst harvests of earless futility. That conservatism which
  works in every class to preserve in its essentials the habitual daily life is
  all against a profounder treatment of political issues. The politician,
  almost as absurdly as the philosopher, tends constantly, in spite of
  magnificent preludes, vast intimations, to specialise himself out of the
  reality he has so stupendously summoned&mdash;he bolts back to littleness.
  The world has to be moulded anew, he continues to admit, but without, he
  adds, any risk of upsetting his week-end visits, his morning cup of
  tea...</p>

  <p>The discussion of the relations of men and women disturbs every one. It
  reacts upon the private life of every one who attempts it. And at any
  particular time only a small minority have a personal interest in changing
  the established state of affairs. Habit and interest are in a constantly
  recruited majority against conscious change and adjustment in these matters.
  Drift rules us. The great mass of people, and an overwhelming proportion of
  influential people, are people who have banished their dreams and made their
  compromise. Wonderful and beautiful possibilities are no longer to be thought
  about. They have given up any aspirations for intense love, their splendid
  offspring, for keen delights, have accepted a cultivated kindliness and an
  uncritical sense of righteousness as their compensation. It's a settled
  affair with them, a settled, dangerous affair. Most of them fear, and many
  hate, the slightest reminder of those abandoned dreams. As Dayton once said
  to the Pentagram Circle, when we were discussing the problem of a universal
  marriage and divorce law throughout the Empire, "I am for leaving all these
  things alone." And then, with a groan in his voice, "Leave them alone! Leave
  them all alone!"</p>

  <p>That was his whole speech for the evening, in a note of suppressed
  passion, and presently, against all our etiquette, he got up and went
  out.</p>

  <p>For some years after my marriage, I too was for leaving them alone. I
  developed a dread and dislike for romance, for emotional music, for the human
  figure in art&mdash;turning my heart to landscape. I wanted to sneer at
  lovers and their ecstasies, and was uncomfortable until I found the effective
  sneer. In matters of private morals these were my most uncharitable years. I
  didn't want to think of these things any more for ever. I hated the people
  whose talk or practice showed they were not of my opinion. I wanted to
  believe that their views were immoral and objectionable and contemptible,
  because I had decided to treat them as at that level. I was, in fact, falling
  into the attitude of the normal decent man.</p>

  <p>And yet one cannot help thinking! The sensible moralised man finds it hard
  to escape the stream of suggestion that there are still dreams beyond these
  commonplace acquiescences,&mdash;the appeal of beauty suddenly shining upon
  one, the mothlike stirrings of serene summer nights, the sweetness of distant
  music...</p>

  <p>It is one of the paradoxical factors in our public life at the present
  time, which penalises abandonment to love so abundantly and so heavily, that
  power, influence and control fall largely to unencumbered people and sterile
  people and people who have married for passionless purposes, people whose
  very deficiency in feeling has left them free to follow ambition, people
  beautyblind, who don't understand what it is to fall in love, what it is to
  desire children or have them, what it is to feel in their blood and bodies
  the supreme claim of good births and selective births above all other affairs
  in life, people almost of necessity averse from this most fundamental aspect
  of existence...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">It wasn't, however, my deepening sympathy with and
  understanding of the position of women in general, or the change in my ideas
  about all these intimate things my fast friendship with Isabel was bringing
  about, that led me to the heretical views I have in the last five years
  dragged from the region of academic and timid discussion into the field of
  practical politics. Those influences, no doubt, have converged to the same
  end, and given me a powerful emotional push upon my road, but it was a
  broader and colder view of things that first determined me in my attempt to
  graft the Endowment of Motherhood in some form or other upon British
  Imperialism. Now that I am exiled from the political world, it is possible to
  estimate just how effectually that grafting has been done.</p>

  <p>I have explained how the ideas of a trained aristocracy and a universal
  education grew to paramount importance in my political scheme. It is but a
  short step from this to the question of the quantity and quality of births in
  the community, and from that again to these forbidden and fear-beset topics
  of marriage, divorce, and the family organisation. A sporadic discussion of
  these aspects had been going on for years, a Eugenic society existed, and
  articles on the Falling Birth Rate, and the Rapid Multiplication of the Unfit
  were staples of the monthly magazines. But beyond an intermittent scolding of
  prosperous childless people in general&mdash;one never addressed them in
  particular&mdash;nothing was done towards arresting those adverse processes.
  Almost against my natural inclination, I found myself forced to go into these
  things. I came to the conclusion that under modern conditions the isolated
  private family, based on the existing marriage contract, was failing in its
  work. It wasn't producing enough children, and children good enough and well
  trained enough for the demands of the developing civilised state. Our
  civilisation was growing outwardly, and decaying in its intimate substance,
  and unless it was presently to collapse, some very extensive and courageous
  reorganisation was needed. The old haphazard system of pairing, qualified
  more and more by worldly discretions, no longer secures a young population
  numerous enough or good enough for the growing needs and possibilities of our
  Empire. Statecraft sits weaving splendid garments, no doubt, but with a puny,
  ugly, insufficient baby in the cradle.</p>

  <p>No one so far has dared to take up this problem as a present question for
  statecraft, but it comes unheralded, unadvocated, and sits at every
  legislative board. Every improvement is provisional except the improvement of
  the race, and it became more and more doubtful to me if we were improving the
  race at all! Splendid and beautiful and courageous people must come together
  and have children, women with their fine senses and glorious devotion must be
  freed from the net that compels them to be celibate, compels them to be
  childless and useless, or to bear children ignobly to men whom need and
  ignorance and the treacherous pressure of circumstances have forced upon
  them. We all know that, and so few dare even to whisper it for fear that they
  should seem, in seeking to save the family, to threaten its existence. It is
  as if a party of pigmies in a not too capacious room had been joined by a
  carnivorous giant&mdash;and decided to go on living happily by cutting him
  dead...</p>

  <p>The problem the developing civilised state has to solve is how it can get
  the best possible increase under the best possible conditions. I became more
  and more convinced that the independent family unit of to-day, in which the
  man is master of the wife and owner of the children, in which all are
  dependent upon him, subordinated to his enterprises and liable to follow his
  fortunes up or down, does not supply anything like the best conceivable
  conditions. We want to modernise the family footing altogether. An enormous
  premium both in pleasure and competitive efficiency is put upon voluntary
  childlessness, and enormous inducements are held out to women to subordinate
  instinctive and selective preferences to social and material
  considerations.</p>

  <p>The practical reaction of modern conditions upon the old tradition of the
  family is this: that beneath the pretence that nothing is changing, secretly
  and with all the unwholesomeness of secrecy everything is changed. Offspring
  fall away, the birth rate falls and falls most among just the most efficient
  and active and best adapted classes in the community. The species is
  recruited from among its failures and from among less civilised aliens.
  Contemporary civilisations are in effect burning the best of their possible
  babies in the furnaces that run the machinery. In the United States the
  native Anglo-American strain has scarcely increased at all since 1830, and in
  most Western European countries the same is probably true of the ablest and
  most energetic elements in the community. The women of these classes still
  remain legally and practically dependent and protected, with the only natural
  excuse for their dependence gone...</p>

  <p>The modern world becomes an immense spectacle of unsatisfactory groupings;
  here childless couples bored to death in the hopeless effort to sustain an
  incessant honeymoon, here homes in which a solitary child grows unsocially,
  here small two or three-child homes that do no more than continue the culture
  of the parents at a great social cost, here numbers of unhappy educated but
  childless married women, here careless, decivilised fecund homes, here
  orphanages and asylums for the heedlessly begotten. It is just the disorderly
  proliferation of Bromstead over again, in lives instead of in houses.</p>

  <p>What is the good, what is the common sense, of rectifying boundaries,
  pushing research and discovery, building cities, improving all the facilities
  of life, making great fleets, waging wars, while this aimless decadence
  remains the quality of the biological outlook?...</p>

  <p>It is difficult now to trace how I changed from my early aversion until I
  faced this mass of problems. But so far back as 1910 I had it clear in my
  mind that I would rather fail utterly than participate in all the surrenders
  of mind and body that are implied in Dayton's snarl of "Leave it alone; leave
  it all alone!" Marriage and the begetting and care of children, is the very
  ground substance in the life of the community. In a world in which everything
  changes, in which fresh methods, fresh adjustments and fresh ideas
  perpetually renew the circumstances of life, it is preposterous that we
  should not even examine into these matters, should rest content to be ruled
  by the uncriticised traditions of a barbaric age.</p>

  <p>Now, it seems to me that the solution of this problem is also the solution
  of the woman's individual problem. The two go together, are right and left of
  one question. The only conceivable way out from our IMPASSE lies in the
  recognition of parentage, that is to say of adequate mothering, as no longer
  a chance product of individual passions but a service rendered to the State.
  Women must become less and less subordinated to individual men, since this
  works out in a more or less complete limitation, waste, and sterilisation of
  their essentially social function; they must become more and more
  subordinated as individually independent citizens to the collective purpose.
  Or, to express the thing by a familiar phrase, the highly organised,
  scientific state we desire must, if it is to exist at all, base itself not
  upon the irresponsible man-ruled family, but upon the matriarchal family, the
  citizen-ship and freedom of women and the public endowment of motherhood.</p>

  <p>After two generations of confused and experimental revolt it grows clear
  to modern women that a conscious, deliberate motherhood and mothering is
  their special function in the State, and that a personal subordination to an
  individual man with an unlimited power of control over this intimate and
  supreme duty is a degradation. No contemporary woman of education put to the
  test is willing to recognise any claim a man can make upon her but the claim
  of her freely-given devotion to him. She wants the reality of her choice and
  she means "family" while a man too often means only possession. This alters
  the spirit of the family relationships fundamentally. Their form remains just
  what it was when woman was esteemed a pretty, desirable, and incidentally a
  child-producing, chattel. Against these time-honoured ideas the new spirit of
  womanhood struggles in shame, astonishment, bitterness, and tears...</p>

  <p>I confess myself altogether feminist. I have no doubts in the matter. I
  want this coddling and browbeating of women to cease. I want to see women
  come in, free and fearless, to a full participation in the collective purpose
  of mankind. Women, I am convinced, are as fine as men; they can be as wise as
  men; they are capable of far greater devotion than men. I want to see them
  citizens, with a marriage law framed primarily for them and for their
  protection and the good of the race, and not for men's satisfactions. I want
  to see them bearing and rearing good children in the State as a generously
  rewarded public duty and service, choosing their husbands freely and
  discerningly, and in no way enslaved by or subordinated to the men they have
  chosen. The social consciousness of women seems to me an unworked, an almost
  untouched mine of wealth for the constructive purpose of the world. I want to
  change the respective values of the family group altogether, and make the
  home indeed the women's kingdom and the mother the owner and responsible
  guardian of her children.</p>

  <p>It is no use pretending that this is not novel and revolutionary; it is.
  The Endowment of Motherhood implies a new method of social organization, a
  rearrangement of the social unit, untried in human experience&mdash;as
  untried as electric traction was or flying in 1800. Of course, it may work
  out to modify men's ideas of marriage profoundly. To me that is a secondary
  consideration. I do not believe that particular assertion myself, because I
  am convinced that a practical monogamy is a psychological necessity to the
  mass of civilised people. But even if I did believe it I should still keep to
  my present line, because it is the only line that will prevent a highly
  organised civilisation from ending in biological decay. The public Endowment
  of Motherhood is the only possible way which will ensure the permanently
  developing civilised state at which all constructive minds are aiming. A
  point is reached in the life-history of a civilisation when either this
  reconstruction must be effected or the quality and MORALE of the population
  prove insufficient for the needs of the developing organisation. It is not so
  much moral decadence that will destroy us as moral inadaptability. The old
  code fails under the new needs. The only alternative to this profound
  reconstruction is a decay in human quality and social collapse. Either this
  unprecedented rearrangement must be achieved by our civilisation, or it must
  presently come upon a phase of disorder and crumble and perish, as Rome
  perished, as France declines, as the strain of the Pilgrim Fathers dwindles
  out of America. Whatever hope there may be in the attempt therefore, there is
  no alternative to the attempt.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">I wanted political success now dearly enough, but not at the
  price of constructive realities. These questions were no doubt monstrously
  dangerous in the political world; there wasn't a politician alive who didn't
  look scared at the mention of "The Family," but if raising these issues were
  essential to the social reconstructions on which my life was set, that did
  not matter. It only implied that I should take them up with deliberate
  caution. There was no release because of risk or difficulty.</p>

  <p>The question of whether I should commit myself to some open project in
  this direction was going on in my mind concurrently with my speculations
  about a change of party, like bass and treble in a complex piece of music.
  The two drew to a conclusion together. I would not only go over to
  Imperialism, but I would attempt to biologise Imperialism.</p>

  <p>I thought at first that I was undertaking a monstrous uphill task. But as
  I came to look into the possibilities of the matter, a strong persuasion grew
  up in my mind that this panic fear of legislative proposals affecting the
  family basis was excessive, that things were much riper for development in
  this direction than old-experienced people out of touch with the younger
  generation imagined, that to phrase the thing in a parliamentary fashion,
  "something might be done in the constituencies" with the Endowment of
  Motherhood forthwith, provided only that it was made perfectly clear that
  anything a sane person could possibly intend by "morality" was left untouched
  by these proposals.</p>

  <p>I went to work very carefully. I got Roper of <i>The Daily Telephone</i>
  and Burkett of the DIAL to try over a silly-season discussion of State Help
  for Mothers, and I put a series of articles on eugenics, upon the fall in the
  birth-rate, and similar topics in <i>The Blue Weekly</i>, leading up to a
  tentative and generalised advocacy of the public endowment of the nation's
  children. I was more and more struck by the acceptance won by a sober and
  restrained presentation of this suggestion.</p>

  <p>And then, in the fourth year of <i>The Blue Weekly</i>'s career, came the
  Handitch election, and I was forced by the clamour of my antagonist, and very
  willingly forced, to put my convictions to the test. I returned triumphantly
  to Westminster with the Public Endowment of Motherhood as part of my open
  profession and with the full approval of the party press. Applauding benches
  of Imperialists cheered me on my way to the table between the whips.</p>

  <p>That second time I took the oath I was not one of a crowd of new members,
  but salient, an event, a symbol of profound changes and new purposes in the
  national life.</p>

  <p>Here it is my political book comes to an end, and in a sense my book ends
  altogether. For the rest is but to tell how I was swept out of this great
  world of political possibilities. I close this Third Book as I opened it,
  with an admission of difficulties and complexities, but now with a pile of
  manuscript before me I have to confess them unsurmounted and still
  entangled.</p>

  <p>Yet my aim was a final simplicity. I have sought to show my growing
  realisation that the essential quality of all political and social effort is
  the development of a great race mind behind the interplay of individual
  lives. That is the collective human reality, the basis of morality, the
  purpose of devotion. To that our lives must be given, from that will come the
  perpetual fresh release and further ennoblement of individual lives...</p>

  <p>I have wanted to make that idea of a collective mind play in this book the
  part United Italy plays in Machiavelli's PRINCE. I have called it the
  hinterland of reality, shown it accumulating a dominating truth and rightness
  which must force men's now sporadic motives more and more into a disciplined
  and understanding relation to a plan. And I have tried to indicate how I
  sought to serve this great clarification of our confusions...</p>

  <p>Now I come back to personality and the story of my self-betrayal, and how
  it is I have had to leave all that far-reaching scheme of mine, a mere
  project and beginning for other men to take or leave as it pleases them.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap4_01"
     name="chap4_01"></a>I. &mdash; LOVE AND SUCCESS</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">I come to the most evasive and difficult part of my story,
  which is to tell how Isabel and I have made a common wreck of our joint
  lives.</p>

  <p>It is not the telling of one simple disastrous accident. There was a vein
  in our natures that led to this collapse, gradually and at this point and
  that it crept to the surface. One may indeed see our destruction&mdash;for
  indeed politically we could not be more extinct if we had been shot
  dead&mdash;in the form of a catastrophe as disconnected and conclusive as a
  meteoric stone falling out of heaven upon two friends and crushing them both.
  But I do not think that is true to our situation or ourselves. We were not
  taken by surprise. The thing was in us and not from without, it was akin to
  our way of thinking and our habitual attitudes; it had, for all its impulsive
  effect, a certain necessity. We might have escaped no doubt, as two men at a
  hundred yards may shoot at each other with pistols for a considerable time
  and escape. But it isn't particularly reasonable to talk of the contrariety
  of fate if they both get hit.</p>

  <p>Isabel and I were dangerous to each other for several years of friendship,
  and not quite unwittingly so.</p>

  <p>In writing this, moreover, there is a very great difficulty in steering my
  way between two equally undesirable tones in the telling. In the first place
  I do not want to seem to confess my sins with a penitence I am very doubtful
  if I feel. Now that I have got Isabel we can no doubt count the cost of it
  and feel unquenchable regrets, but I am not sure whether, if we could be put
  back now into such circumstances as we were in a year ago, or two years ago,
  whether with my eyes fully open I should not do over again very much as I
  did. And on the other hand I do not want to justify the things we have done.
  We are two bad people&mdash;if there is to be any classification of good and
  bad at all, we have acted badly, and quite apart from any other
  considerations we've largely wasted our own very great possibilities. But it
  is part of a queer humour that underlies all this, that I find myself
  slipping again and again into a sentimental treatment of our case that is as
  unpremeditated as it is insincere. When I am a little tired after a morning's
  writing I find the faint suggestion getting into every other sentence that
  our blunders and misdeeds embodied, after the fashion of the prophet Hosea,
  profound moral truths. Indeed, I feel so little confidence in my ability to
  keep this altogether out of my book that I warn the reader here that in spite
  of anything he may read elsewhere in the story, intimating however shyly an
  esoteric and exalted virtue in our proceedings, the plain truth of this
  business is that Isabel and I wanted each other with a want entirely
  formless, inconsiderate, and overwhelming. And though I could tell you
  countless delightful and beautiful things about Isabel, were this a book in
  her praise, I cannot either analyse that want or account for its extreme
  intensity.</p>

  <p>I will confess that deep in my mind there is a belief in a sort of wild
  rightness about any love that is fraught with beauty, but that eludes me and
  vanishes again, and is not, I feel, to be put with the real veracities and
  righteousnesses and virtues in the paddocks and menageries of human
  reason...</p>

  <p>We have already a child, and Margaret was childless, and I find myself
  prone to insist upon that, as if it was a justification. But, indeed, when we
  became lovers there was small thought of Eugenics between us. Ours was a
  mutual and not a philoprogenitive passion. Old Nature behind us may have had
  such purposes with us, but it is not for us to annex her intentions by a
  moralising afterthought. There isn't, in fact, any decent justification for
  us whatever&mdash;at that the story must stand.</p>

  <p>But if there is no justification there is at least a very effective excuse
  in the mental confusedness of our time. The evasion of that passionately
  thorough exposition of belief and of the grounds of morality, which is the
  outcome of the mercenary religious compromises of the late Vatican period,
  the stupid suppression of anything but the most timid discussion of sexual
  morality in our literature and drama, the pervading cultivated and protected
  muddle-headedness, leaves mentally vigorous people with relatively enormous
  possibilities of destruction and little effective help. They find themselves
  confronted by the habits and prejudices of manifestly commonplace people, and
  by that extraordinary patched-up Christianity, the cult of a "Bromsteadised"
  deity, diffused, scattered, and aimless, which hides from examination and any
  possibility of faith behind the plea of good taste. A god about whom there is
  delicacy is far worse than no god at all. We are FORCED to be laws unto
  ourselves and to live experimentally. It is inevitable that a considerable
  fraction of just that bolder, more initiatory section of the intellectual
  community, the section that can least be spared from the collective life in a
  period of trial and change, will drift into such emotional crises and such
  disaster as overtook us. Most perhaps will escape, but many will go down,
  many more than the world can spare. It is the unwritten law of all our public
  life, and the same holds true of America, that an honest open scandal ends a
  career. England in the last quarter of a century has wasted half a dozen
  statesmen on this score; she would, I believe, reject Nelson now if he sought
  to serve her. Is it wonderful that to us fretting here in exile this should
  seem the cruellest as well as the most foolish elimination of a necessary
  social element? It destroys no vice; for vice hides by nature. It not only
  rewards dullness as if it were positive virtue, but sets an enormous premium
  upon hypocrisy. That is my case, and that is why I am telling this side of my
  story with so much explicitness.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Ever since the Kinghamstead election I had maintained what
  seemed a desultory friendship with Isabel. At first it was rather Isabel kept
  it up than I. Whenever Margaret and I went down to that villa, with its three
  or four acres of garden and shrubbery about it, which fulfilled our election
  promise to live at Kinghamstead, Isabel would turn up in a state of frank
  cheerfulness, rejoicing at us, and talk all she was reading and thinking to
  me, and stay for all the rest of the day. In her shameless liking for me she
  was as natural as a savage. She would exercise me vigorously at tennis, while
  Margaret lay and rested her back in the afternoon, or guide me for some long
  ramble that dodged the suburban and congested patches of the constituency
  with amazing skill. She took possession of me in that unabashed,
  straight-minded way a girl will sometimes adopt with a man, chose my path or
  criticised my game with a motherly solicitude for my welfare that was absurd
  and delightful. And we talked. We discussed and criticised the stories of
  novels, scraps of history, pictures, social questions, socialism, the policy
  of the Government. She was young and most unevenly informed, but she was
  amazingly sharp and quick and good. Never before in my life had I known a
  girl of her age, or a woman of her quality. I had never dreamt there was such
  talk in the world. Kinghamstead became a lightless place when she went to
  Oxford. Heaven knows how much that may not have precipitated my abandonment
  of the seat!</p>

  <p>She went to Ridout College, Oxford, and that certainly weighed with me
  when presently after my breach with the Liberals various little undergraduate
  societies began to ask for lectures and discussions. I favoured Oxford. I
  declared openly I did so because of her. At that time I think we neither of
  us suspected the possibility of passion that lay like a coiled snake in the
  path before us. It seemed to us that we had the quaintest, most delightful
  friendship in the world; she was my pupil, and I was her guide, philosopher,
  and friend. People smiled indulgently&mdash;even Margaret smiled indulgently
  &mdash;at our attraction for one another.</p>

  <p>Such friendships are not uncommon nowadays&mdash;among easy-going,
  liberal-minded people. For the most part, there's no sort of harm, as people
  say, in them. The two persons concerned are never supposed to think of the
  passionate love that hovers so close to the friendship, or if they do, then
  they banish the thought. I think we kept the thought as permanently in exile
  as any one could do. If it did in odd moments come into our heads we
  pretended elaborately it wasn't there.</p>

  <p>Only we were both very easily jealous of each other's attention, and
  tremendously insistent upon each other's preference.</p>

  <p>I remember once during the Oxford days an intimation that should have set
  me thinking, and I suppose discreetly disentangling myself. It was one Sunday
  afternoon, and it must have been about May, for the trees and shrubs of
  Ridout College were gay with blossom, and fresh with the new sharp greens of
  spring. I had walked talking with Isabel and a couple of other girls through
  the wide gardens of the place, seen and criticised the new brick pond, nodded
  to the daughter of this friend and that in the hammocks under the trees, and
  picked a way among the scattered tea-parties on the lawn to our own circle on
  the grass under a Siberian crab near the great bay window. There I sat and
  ate great quantities of cake, and discussed the tactics of the Suffragettes.
  I had made some comments upon the spirit of the movement in an address to the
  men in Pembroke, and it had got abroad, and a group of girls and women dons
  were now having it out with me.</p>

  <p>I forget the drift of the conversation, or what it was made Isabel
  interrupt me. She did interrupt me. She had been lying prone on the ground at
  my right hand, chin on fists, listening thoughtfully, and I was sitting
  beside old Lady Evershead on a garden seat. I turned to Isabel's voice, and
  saw her face uplifted, and her dear cheeks and nose and forehead all splashed
  and barred with sunlight and the shadows of the twigs of the trees behind me.
  And something&mdash;an infinite tenderness, stabbed me. It was a keen
  physical feeling, like nothing I had ever felt before. It had a quality of
  tears in it. For the first time in my narrow and concentrated life another
  human being had really thrust into my being and gripped my very heart.</p>

  <p>Our eyes met perplexed for an extraordinary moment. Then I turned back and
  addressed myself a little stiffly to the substance of her intervention. For
  some time I couldn't look at her again.</p>

  <p>From that time forth I knew I loved Isabel beyond measure.</p>

  <p>Yet it is curious that it never occurred to me for a year or so that this
  was likely to be a matter of passion between us. I have told how definitely I
  put my imagination into harness in those matters at my marriage, and I was
  living now in a world of big interests, where there is neither much time nor
  inclination for deliberate love-making. I suppose there is a large class of
  men who never meet a girl or a woman without thinking of sex, who meet a
  friend's daughter and decide: "Mustn't get friendly with her&mdash;wouldn't
  <i>do</i>," and set invisible bars between themselves and all the wives in
  the world. Perhaps that is the way to live. Perhaps there is no other method
  than this effectual annihilation of half&mdash;and the most sympathetic and
  attractive half&mdash;of the human beings in the world, so far as any frank
  intercourse is concerned. I am quite convinced anyhow that such a qualified
  intimacy as ours, such a drifting into the sense of possession, such
  untrammeled conversation with an invisible, implacable limit set just where
  the intimacy glows, it is no kind of tolerable compromise. If men and women
  are to go so far together, they must be free to go as far as they may want to
  go, without the vindictive destruction that has come upon us. On the basis of
  the accepted codes the jealous people are right, and the liberal-minded ones
  are playing with fire. If people are not to love, then they must be kept
  apart. If they are not to be kept apart, then we must prepare for an
  unprecedented toleration of lovers.</p>

  <p>Isabel was as unforeseeing as I to begin with, but sex marches into the
  life of an intelligent girl with demands and challenges far more urgent than
  the mere call of curiosity and satiable desire that comes to a young man. No
  woman yet has dared to tell the story of that unfolding. She attracted men,
  and she encouraged them, and watched them, and tested them, and dismissed
  them, and concealed the substance of her thoughts about them in the way that
  seems instinctive in a natural-minded girl. There was even an
  engagement&mdash;amidst the protests and disapproval of the college
  authorities. I never saw the man, though she gave me a long history of the
  affair, to which I listened with a forced and insincere sympathy. She struck
  me oddly as taking the relationship for a thing in itself, and regardless of
  its consequences. After a time she became silent about him, and then threw
  him over; and by that time, I think, for all that she was so much my junior,
  she knew more about herself and me than I was to know for several years to
  come.</p>

  <p>We didn't see each other for some months after my resignation, but we kept
  up a frequent correspondence. She said twice over that she wanted to talk to
  me, that letters didn't convey what one wanted to say, and I went up to
  Oxford pretty definitely to see her&mdash;though I combined it with one or
  two other engagements&mdash;somewhere in February. Insensibly she had become
  important enough for me to make journeys for her.</p>

  <p>But we didn't see very much of one another on that occasion. There was
  something in the air between us that made a faint embarrassment; the mere
  fact, perhaps, that she had asked me to come up.</p>

  <p>A year before she would have dashed off with me quite unscrupulously to
  talk alone, carried me off to her room for an hour with a minute of
  chaperonage to satisfy the rules. Now there was always some one or other near
  us that it seemed impossible to exorcise.</p>

  <p>We went for a walk on the Sunday afternoon with old Fortescue, K. C.,
  who'd come up to see his two daughters, both great friends of Isabel's, and
  some mute inglorious don whose name I forget, but who was in a state of
  marked admiration for her. The six of us played a game of conversational
  entanglements throughout, and mostly I was impressing the Fortescue girls
  with the want of mental concentration possible in a rising politician. We
  went down Carfex, I remember, to Folly Bridge, and inspected the Barges, and
  then back by way of Merton to the Botanic Gardens and Magdalen Bridge. And in
  the Botanic Gardens she got almost her only chance with me.</p>

  <p>"Last months at Oxford," she said.</p>

  <p>"And then?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm coming to London," she said.</p>

  <p>"To write?"</p>

  <p>She was silent for a moment. Then she said abruptly, with that quick flush
  of hers and a sudden boldness in her eyes: "I'm going to work with you. Why
  shouldn't I?"</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Here, again, I suppose I had a fair warning of the drift of
  things. I seem to remember myself in the train to Paddington, sitting with a
  handful of papers&mdash;galley proofs for <i>The Blue Weekly</i>, I
  suppose&mdash;on my lap, and thinking about her and that last sentence of
  hers, and all that it might mean to me.</p>

  <p>It is very hard to recall even the main outline of anything so elusive as
  a meditation. I know that the idea of working with her gripped me, fascinated
  me. That my value in her life seemed growing filled me with pride and a kind
  of gratitude. I was already in no doubt that her value in my life was
  tremendous. It made it none the less, that in those days I was obsessed by
  the idea that she was transitory, and bound to go out of my life again. It is
  no good trying to set too fine a face upon this complex business, there is
  gold and clay and sunlight and savagery in every love story, and a multitude
  of elvish elements peeped out beneath the fine rich curtain of affection that
  masked our future. I've never properly weighed how immensely my vanity was
  gratified by her clear preference for me. Nor can I for a moment determine
  how much deliberate intention I hide from myself in this affair.</p>

  <p>Certainly I think some part of me must have been saying in the train:
  "Leave go of her. Get away from her. End this now." I can't have been so
  stupid as not to have had that in my mind...</p>

  <p>If she had been only a beautiful girl in love with me, I think I could
  have managed the situation. Once or twice since my marriage and before Isabel
  became of any significance in my life, there had been incidents with other
  people, flashes of temptation&mdash;no telling is possible of the thing
  resisted. I think that mere beauty and passion would not have taken me. But
  between myself and Isabel things were incurably complicated by the
  intellectual sympathy we had, the jolly march of our minds together. That has
  always mattered enormously. I should have wanted her company nearly as badly
  if she had been some crippled old lady; we would have hunted shoulder to
  shoulder, as two men. Only two men would never have had the patience and
  readiness for one another we two had. I had never for years met any one with
  whom I could be so carelessly sure of understanding or to whom I could listen
  so easily and fully. She gave me, with an extraordinary completeness, that
  rare, precious effect of always saying something fresh, and yet saying it so
  that it filled into and folded about all the little recesses and corners of
  my mind with an infinite, soft familiarity. It is impossible to explain that.
  It is like trying to explain why her voice, her voice heard speaking to any
  one&mdash;heard speaking in another room&mdash;pleased my ears.</p>

  <p>She was the only Oxford woman who took a first that year. She spent the
  summer in Scotland and Yorkshire, writing to me continually of all she now
  meant to do, and stirring my imagination. She came to London for the autumn
  session. For a time she stayed with old Lady Colbeck, but she fell out with
  her hostess when it became clear she wanted to write, not novels, but
  journalism, and then she set every one talking by taking a flat near Victoria
  and installing as her sole protector an elderly German governess she had
  engaged through a scholastic agency. She began writing, not in that copious
  flood the undisciplined young woman of gifts is apt to produce, but in
  exactly the manner of an able young man, experimenting with forms, developing
  the phrasing of opinions, taking a definite line. She was, of course,
  tremendously discussed. She was disapproved of, but she was invited out to
  dinner. She got rather a reputation for the management of elderly
  distinguished men. It was an odd experience to follow Margaret's soft rustle
  of silk into some big drawing-room and discover my snub-nosed girl in the
  blue sack transformed into a shining creature in the soft splendour of pearls
  and ivory-white and lace, and with a silver band about her dusky hair.</p>

  <p>For a time we did not meet very frequently, though always she professed an
  unblushing preference for my company, and talked my views and sought me out.
  Then her usefulness upon <i>The Blue Weekly</i> began to link us closelier.
  She would come up to the office, and sit by the window, and talk over the
  proofs of the next week's articles, going through my intentions with a keen
  investigatory scalpel. Her talk always puts me in mind of a steel blade. Her
  writing became rapidly very good; she had a wit and a turn of the phrase that
  was all her own. We seemed to have forgotten the little shadow of
  embarrassment that had fallen over our last meeting at Oxford. Everything
  seemed natural and easy between us in those days; a little unconventional,
  but that made it all the brighter.</p>

  <p>We developed something like a custom of walks, about once a week or so,
  and letters and notes became frequent. I won't pretend things were not keenly
  personal between us, but they had an air of being innocently mental. She used
  to call me "Master" in our talks, a monstrous and engaging flattery, and I
  was inordinately proud to have her as my pupil. Who wouldn't have been? And
  we went on at that distance for a long time&mdash;until within a year of the
  Handitch election.</p>

  <p>After Lady Colbeck threw her up as altogether too "intellectual" for
  comfortable control, Isabel was taken up by the Balfes in a less formal and
  compromising manner, and week-ended with them and their cousin Leonora
  Sparling, and spent large portions of her summer with them in Herefordshire.
  There was a lover or so in that time, men who came a little timidly at this
  brilliant young person with the frank manner and the Amazonian mind, and, she
  declared, received her kindly refusals with manifest relief. And Arnold
  Shoesmith struck up a sort of friendship that oddly imitated mine. She took a
  liking to him because he was clumsy and shy and inexpressive; she embarked
  upon the dangerous interest of helping him to find his soul. I had some
  twinges of jealousy about that. I didn't see the necessity of him. He invaded
  her time, and I thought that might interfere with her work. If their
  friendship stole some hours from Isabel's writing, it did not for a long
  while interfere with our walks or our talks, or the close intimacy we had
  together.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">Then suddenly Isabel and I found ourselves passionately in
  love.</p>

  <p>The change came so entirely without warning or intention that I find it
  impossible now to tell the order of its phases. What disturbed pebble started
  the avalanche I cannot trace. Perhaps it was simply that the barriers between
  us and this masked aspect of life had been wearing down unperceived.</p>

  <p>And there came a change in Isabel. It was like some change in the cycle of
  nature, like the onset of spring&mdash;a sharp brightness, an uneasiness. She
  became restless with her work; little encounters with men began to happen,
  encounters not quite in the quality of the earlier proposals; and then came
  an odd incident of which she told me, but somehow, I felt, didn't tell me
  completely. She told me all she was able to tell me. She had been at a dance
  at the Ropers', and a man, rather well known in London, had kissed her. The
  thing amazed her beyond measure. It was the sort of thing immediately
  possible between any man and any woman, that one never expects to happen
  until it happens. It had the surprising effect of a judge generally known to
  be bald suddenly whipping off his wig in court. No absolutely unexpected
  revelation could have quite the same quality of shock. She went through the
  whole thing to me with a remarkable detachment, told me how she had
  felt&mdash;and the odd things it seemed to open to her.</p>

  <p>"I <i>want</i> to be kissed, and all that sort of thing," she avowed. "I
  suppose every woman does."</p>

  <p>She added after a pause: "And I don't want any one to do it."</p>

  <p>This struck me as queerly expressive of the woman's attitude to these
  things. "Some one presently will&mdash;solve that," I said.</p>

  <p>"Some one will perhaps."</p>

  <p>I was silent.</p>

  <p>"Some one will," she said, almost viciously. "And then we'll have to stop
  these walks and talks of ours, dear Master... I'll be sorry to give them
  up."</p>

  <p>"It's part of the requirements of the situation," I said, "that he should
  be&mdash;oh, very interesting! He'll start, no doubt, all sorts of new
  topics, and open no end of attractive vistas... You can't, you know, always
  go about in a state of pupillage."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I can," said Isabel. "But it's only just recently I've
  begun to doubt about it."</p>

  <p>I remember these things being said, but just how much we saw and
  understood, and just how far we were really keeping opaque to each other
  then, I cannot remember. But it must have been quite soon after this that we
  spent nearly a whole day together at Kew Gardens, with the curtains up and
  the barriers down, and the thing that had happened plain before our eyes. I
  don't remember we ever made any declaration. We just assumed the new
  footing...</p>

  <p>It was a day early in that year&mdash;I think in January, because there
  was thin, crisp snow on the grass, and we noted that only two other people
  had been to the Pagoda that day. I've a curious impression of greenish
  colour, hot, moist air and huge palm fronds about very much of our talk, as
  though we were nearly all the time in the Tropical House. But I also remember
  very vividly looking at certain orange and red spray-like flowers from
  Patagonia, which could not have been there. It is a curious thing that I do
  not remember we made any profession of passionate love for one another; we
  talked as though the fact of our intense love for each other had always been
  patent between us. There was so long and frank an intimacy between us that we
  talked far more like brother and sister or husband and wife than two people
  engaged in the war of the sexes. We wanted to know what we were going to do,
  and whatever we did we meant to do in the most perfect concert. We both felt
  an extraordinary accession of friendship and tenderness then, and, what again
  is curious, very little passion. But there was also, in spite of the
  perplexities we faced, an immense satisfaction about that day. It was as if
  we had taken off something that had hindered our view of each other, like
  people who unvizored to talk more easily at a masked ball.</p>

  <p>I've had since to view our relations from the standpoint of the ordinary
  observer. I find that vision in the most preposterous contrast with all that
  really went on between us. I suppose there I should figure as a wicked
  seducer, while an unprotected girl succumbed to my fascinations. As a matter
  of fact, it didn't occur to us that there was any personal inequality between
  us. I knew her for my equal mentally; in so many things she was beyond
  comparison cleverer than I; her courage outwent mine. The quick leap of her
  mind evoked a flash of joy in mine like the response of an induction wire;
  her way of thinking was like watching sunlight reflected from little waves
  upon the side of a boat, it was so bright, so mobile, so variously and easily
  true to its law. In the back of our minds we both had a very definite belief
  that making love is full of joyous, splendid, tender, and exciting
  possibilities, and we had to discuss why we shouldn't be to the last degree
  lovers.</p>

  <p>Now, what I should like to print here, if it were possible, in all the
  screaming emphasis of red ink, is this: that the circumstances of my
  upbringing and the circumstances of Isabel's upbringing had left not a shadow
  of belief or feeling that the utmost passionate love between us was in itself
  intrinsically WRONG. I've told with the fullest particularity just all that I
  was taught or found out for myself in these matters, and Isabel's reading and
  thinking, and the fierce silences of her governesses and the breathless
  warnings of teachers, and all the social and religious influences that had
  been brought to bear upon her, had worked out to the same void of conviction.
  The code had failed with us altogether. We didn't for a moment consider
  anything but the expediency of what we both, for all our quiet faces and
  steady eyes, wanted most passionately to do.</p>

  <p>Well, here you have the state of mind of whole brigades of people, and
  particularly of young people, nowadays. The current morality hasn't gripped
  them; they don't really believe in it at all. They may render it lip-service,
  but that is quite another thing. There are scarcely any tolerable novels to
  justify its prohibitions; its prohibitions do, in fact, remain unjustified
  amongst these ugly suppressions. You may, if you choose, silence the
  admission of this in literature and current discussion; you will not prevent
  it working out in lives. People come up to the great moments of passion
  crudely unaware, astoundingly unprepared as no really civilised and
  intelligently planned community would let any one be unprepared. They find
  themselves hedged about with customs that have no organic hold upon them, and
  mere discretions all generous spirits are disposed to despise.</p>

  <p>Consider the infinite absurdities of it! Multitudes of us are trying to
  run this complex modern community on a basis of "Hush" without explaining to
  our children or discussing with them anything about love and marriage at all.
  Doubt and knowledge creep about in enforced darknesses and silences. We are
  living upon an ancient tradition which everybody doubts and nobody has ever
  analysed. We affect a tremendous and cultivated shyness and delicacy about
  imperatives of the most arbitrary appearance. What ensues? What did ensue
  with us, for example? On the one hand was a great desire, robbed of any
  appearance of shame and grossness by the power of love, and on the other
  hand, the possible jealousy of so and so, the disapproval of so and so,
  material risks and dangers. It is only in the retrospect that we have been
  able to grasp something of the effectual case against us. The social
  prohibition lit by the intense glow of our passion, presented itself as
  preposterous, irrational, arbitrary, and ugly, a monster fit only for
  mockery. We might be ruined! Well, there is a phase in every love affair, a
  sort of heroic hysteria, when death and ruin are agreeable additions to the
  prospect. It gives the business a gravity, a solemnity. Timid people may
  hesitate and draw back with a vague instinctive terror of the immensity of
  the oppositions they challenge, but neither Isabel nor I are timid
  people.</p>

  <p>We weighed what was against us. We decided just exactly as scores of
  thousands of people have decided in this very matter, that if it were
  possible to keep this thing to ourselves, there was nothing against it. And
  so we took our first step. With the hunger of love in us, it was easy to
  conclude we might be lovers, and still keep everything to ourselves. That
  cleared our minds of the one persistent obstacle that mattered to
  us&mdash;the haunting presence of Margaret.</p>

  <p>And then we found, as all those scores of thousands of people scattered
  about us have found, that we could not keep it to ourselves. Love will out.
  All the rest of this story is the chronicle of that. Love with sustained
  secrecy cannot be love. It is just exactly the point people do not
  understand.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">But before things came to that pass, some months and many
  phases and a sudden journey to America intervened.</p>

  <p>"This thing spells disaster," I said. "You are too big and I am too big to
  attempt this secrecy. Think of the intolerable possibility of being found
  out! At any cost we have to stop&mdash;even at the cost of parting."</p>

  <p>"Just because we may be found out!"</p>

  <p>"Just because we may be found out."</p>

  <p>"Master, I shouldn't in the least mind being found out with you. I'm
  afraid&mdash;I'd be proud."</p>

  <p>"Wait till it happens."</p>

  <p>There followed a struggle of immense insincerity between us. It is hard to
  tell who urged and who resisted.</p>

  <p>She came to me one night to the editorial room of <i>The Blue Weekly</i>,
  and argued and kissed me with wet salt lips, and wept in my arms; she told me
  that now passionate longing for me and my intimate life possessed her, so
  that she could not work, could not think, could not endure other people for
  the love of me...</p>

  <p>I fled absurdly. That is the secret of the futile journey to America that
  puzzled all my friends.</p>

  <p>I ran away from Isabel. I took hold of the situation with all my strength,
  put in Britten with sketchy, hasty instructions to edit the paper, and
  started headlong and with luggage, from which, among other things, my shaving
  things were omitted, upon a tour round the world.</p>

  <p>Preposterous flight that was! I remember as a thing almost farcical my
  explanations to Margaret, and how frantically anxious I was to prevent the
  remote possibility of her coming with me, and how I crossed in the TUSCAN, a
  bad, wet boat, and mixed seasickness with ungovernable sorrow. I
  wept&mdash;tears. It was inexpressibly queer and ridiculous&mdash;and, good
  God! how I hated my fellow-passengers!</p>

  <p>New York inflamed and excited me for a time, and when things slackened, I
  whirled westward to Chicago&mdash;eating and drinking, I remember, in the
  train from shoals of little dishes, with a sort of desperate voracity. I did
  the queerest things to distract myself&mdash;no novelist would dare to invent
  my mental and emotional muddle. Chicago also held me at first, amazing lapse
  from civilisation that the place is! and then abruptly, with hosts expecting
  me, and everything settled for some days in Denver, I found myself at the end
  of my renunciations, and turned and came back headlong to London.</p>

  <p>Let me confess it wasn't any sense of perfect and incurable trust and
  confidence that brought me back, or any idea that now I had strength to
  refrain. It was a sudden realisation that after all the separation might
  succeed; some careless phrasing in one of her jealously read letters set that
  idea going in my mind&mdash;the haunting perception that I might return to
  London and find it empty of the Isabel who had pervaded it. Honour,
  discretion, the careers of both of us, became nothing at the thought. I
  couldn't conceive my life resuming there without Isabel. I couldn't, in
  short, stand it.</p>

  <p>I don't even excuse my return. It is inexcusable. I ought to have kept
  upon my way westward&mdash;and held out. I couldn't. I wanted Isabel, and I
  wanted her so badly now that everything else in the world was phantom-like
  until that want was satisfied. Perhaps you have never wanted anything like
  that. I went straight to her.</p>

  <p>But here I come to untellable things. There is no describing the reality
  of love. The shapes of things are nothing, the actual happenings are nothing,
  except that somehow there falls a light upon them and a wonder. Of how we
  met, and the thrill of the adventure, the curious bright sense of defiance,
  the joy of having dared, I can't tell&mdash;I can but hint of just one
  aspect, of what an amazing LARK&mdash;it's the only word&mdash;it seemed to
  us. The beauty which was the essence of it, which justifies it so far as it
  will bear justification, eludes statement.</p>

  <p>What can a record of contrived meetings, of sundering difficulties evaded
  and overcome, signify here? Or what can it convey to say that one looked deep
  into two dear, steadfast eyes, or felt a heart throb and beat, or gripped
  soft hair softly in a trembling hand? Robbed of encompassing love, these
  things are of no more value than the taste of good wine or the sight of good
  pictures, or the hearing of music,&mdash;just sensuality and no more. No one
  can tell love&mdash;we can only tell the gross facts of love and its
  consequences. Given love&mdash;given mutuality, and one has effected a
  supreme synthesis and come to a new level of life&mdash;but only those who
  know can know. This business has brought me more bitterness and sorrow than I
  had ever expected to bear, but even now I will not say that I regret that
  wilful home-coming altogether. We loved&mdash;to the uttermost. Neither of us
  could have loved any one else as we did and do love one another. It was ours,
  that beauty; it existed only between us when we were close together, for no
  one in the world ever to know save ourselves.</p>

  <p>My return to the office sticks out in my memory with an extreme vividness,
  because of the wild eagle of pride that screamed within me. It was Tuesday
  morning, and though not a soul in London knew of it yet except Isabel, I had
  been back in England a week. I came in upon Britten and stood in the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>"<i>God</i>!" he said at the sight of me.</p>

  <p>"I'm back," I said.</p>

  <p>He looked at my excited face with those red-brown eyes of his. Silently I
  defied him to speak his mind.</p>

  <p>"Where did you turn back?" he said at last.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">I had to tell what were, so far as I can remember my first
  positive lies to Margaret in explaining that return. I had written to her
  from Chicago and again from New York, saying that I felt I ought to be on the
  spot in England for the new session, and that I was coming
  back&mdash;presently. I concealed the name of my boat from her, and made a
  calculated prevarication when I announced my presence in London. I telephoned
  before I went back for my rooms to be prepared. She was, I knew, with the
  Bunting Harblows in Durham, and when she came back to Radnor Square I had
  been at home a day.</p>

  <p>I remember her return so well.</p>

  <p>My going away and the vivid secret of the present had wiped out from my
  mind much of our long estrangement. Something, too, had changed in her. I had
  had some hint of it in her letters, but now I saw it plainly. I came out of
  my study upon the landing when I heard the turmoil of her arrival below, and
  she came upstairs with a quickened gladness. It was a cold March, and she was
  dressed in unfamiliar dark furs that suited her extremely and reinforced the
  delicate flush of her sweet face. She held out both her hands to me, and drew
  me to her unhesitatingly and kissed me.</p>

  <p>"So glad you are back, dear," she said. "Oh! so very glad you are
  back."</p>

  <p>I returned her kiss with a queer feeling at my heart, too undifferentiated
  to be even a definite sense of guilt or meanness. I think it was chiefly
  amazement&mdash;at the universe&mdash;at myself.</p>

  <p>"I never knew what it was to be away from you," she said.</p>

  <p>I perceived suddenly that she had resolved to end our estrangement. She
  put herself so that my arm came caressingly about her.</p>

  <p>"These are jolly furs," I said.</p>

  <p>"I got them for you."</p>

  <p>The parlourmaid appeared below dealing with the maid and the luggage
  cab.</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about America," said Margaret. "I feel as though you'd been
  away six year's."</p>

  <p>We went arm in arm into our little sitting-room, and I took off the fur's
  for her and sat down upon the chintz-covered sofa by the fire. She had
  ordered tea, and came and sat by me. I don't know what I had expected, but of
  all things I had certainly not expected this sudden abolition of our
  distances.</p>

  <p>"I want to know all about America," she repeated, with her eyes
  scrutinising me. "Why did you come back?"</p>

  <p>I repeated the substance of my letters rather lamely, and she sat
  listening.</p>

  <p>"But why did you turn back&mdash;without going to Denver?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted to come back. I was restless."</p>

  <p>"Restlessness," she said, and thought. "You were restless in Venice. You
  said it was restlessness took you to America."</p>

  <p>Again she studied me. She turned a little awkwardly to her tea things, and
  poured needless water from the silver kettle into the teapot. Then she sat
  still for some moments looking at the equipage with expressionless eyes. I
  saw her hand upon the edge of the table tremble slightly. I watched her
  closely. A vague uneasiness possessed me. What might she not know or
  guess?</p>

  <p>She spoke at last with an effort. "I wish you were in Parliament again,"
  she said. "Life doesn't give you events enough."</p>

  <p>"If I was in Parliament again, I should be on the Conservative side."</p>

  <p>"I know," she said, and was still more thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"Lately," she began, and paused. "Lately I've been reading&mdash;you."</p>

  <p>I didn't help her out with what she had to say. I waited.</p>

  <p>"I didn't understand what you were after. I had misjudged. I didn't know.
  I think perhaps I was rather stupid." Her eyes were suddenly shining with
  tears. "You didn't give me much chance to understand."</p>

  <p>She turned upon me suddenly with a voice full of tears.</p>

  <p>"Husband," she said abruptly, holding her two hands out to me, "I want to
  begin over again!"</p>

  <p>I took her hands, perplexed beyond measure. "My dear!" I said.</p>

  <p>"I want to begin over again."</p>

  <p>I bowed my head to hide my face, and found her hand in mine and kissed
  it.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she said, and slowly withdrew her hand. She leant forward with her
  arm on the sofa-back, and looked very intently into my face. I felt the most
  damnable scoundrel in the world as I returned her gaze. The thought of
  Isabel's darkly shining eyes seemed like a physical presence between
  us...</p>

  <p>"Tell me," I said presently, to break the intolerable tension, "tell me
  plainly what you mean by this."</p>

  <p>I sat a little away from her, and then took my teacup in hand, with an odd
  effect of defending myself. "Have you been reading that old book of mine?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"That and the paper. I took a complete set from the beginning down to
  Durham with me. I have read it over, thought it over. I didn't understand
  &mdash;what you were teaching."</p>

  <p>There was a little pause.</p>

  <p>"It all seems so plain to me now," she said, "and so true."</p>

  <p>I was profoundly disconcerted. I put down my teacup, stood up in the
  middle of the hearthrug, and began talking. "I'm tremendously glad, Margaret,
  that you've come to see I'm not altogether perverse," I began. I launched out
  into a rather trite and windy exposition of my views, and she sat close to me
  on the sofa, looking up into my face, hanging on my words, a deliberate and
  invincible convert.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "yes."...</p>

  <p>I had never doubted my new conceptions before; now I doubted them
  profoundly. But I went on talking. It's the grim irony in the lives of all
  politicians, writers, public teachers, that once the audience is at their
  feet, a new loyalty has gripped them. It isn't their business to admit doubt
  and imperfections. They have to go on talking. And I was now so accustomed to
  Isabel's vivid interruptions, qualifications, restatements, and
  confirmations...</p>

  <p>Margaret and I dined together at home. She made me open out my political
  projects to her. "I have been foolish," she said. "I want to help."</p>

  <p>And by some excuse I have forgotten she made me come to her room. I think
  it was some book I had to take her, some American book I had brought back
  with me, and mentioned in our talk. I walked in with it, and put it down on
  the table and turned to go.</p>

  <p>"Husband!" she cried, and held out her slender arms to me. I was compelled
  to go to her and kiss her, and she twined them softly about my neck and drew
  me to her and kissed me. I disentangled them very gently, and took each wrist
  and kissed it, and the backs of her hands.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," I said. There came a little pause. "Good-night, Margaret," I
  repeated, and walked very deliberately and with a kind of sham preoccupation
  to the door.</p>

  <p>I did not look at her, but I could feel her standing, watching me. If I
  had looked up, she would, I knew, have held out her arms to me...</p>

  <p>At the very outset that secret, which was to touch no one but Isabel and
  myself, had reached out to stab another human being.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">The whole world had changed for Isabel and me; and we tried
  to pretend that nothing had changed except a small matter between us. We
  believed quite honestly at that time that it was possible to keep this thing
  that had happened from any reaction at all, save perhaps through some
  magically enhanced vigour in our work, upon the world about us! Seen in
  retrospect, one can realise the absurdity of this belief; within a week I
  realised it; but that does not alter the fact that we did believe as much,
  and that people who are deeply in love and unable to marry will continue to
  believe so to the very end of time. They will continue to believe out of
  existence every consideration that separates them until they have come
  together. Then they will count the cost, as we two had to do.</p>

  <p>I am telling a story, and not propounding theories in this book; and
  chiefly I am telling of the ideas and influences and emotions that have
  happened to me&mdash;me as a sort of sounding board for my world. The
  moralist is at liberty to go over my conduct with his measure and say, "At
  this point or at that you went wrong, and you ought to have
  done"&mdash;so-and-so. The point of interest to the statesman is that it
  didn't for a moment occur to us to do so-and-so when the time for doing it
  came. It amazes me now to think how little either of us troubled about the
  established rights or wrongs of the situation. We hadn't an atom of respect
  for them, innate or acquired. The guardians of public morals will say we were
  very bad people; I submit in defence that they are very bad
  guardians&mdash;provocative guardians... And when at last there came a claim
  against us that had an effective validity for us, we were in the full tide of
  passionate intimacy.</p>

  <p>I had a night of nearly sleepless perplexity after Margaret's return. She
  had suddenly presented herself to me like something dramatically recalled,
  fine, generous, infinitely capable of feeling. I was amazed how much I had
  forgotten her. In my contempt for vulgarised and conventionalised honour I
  had forgotten that for me there was such a reality as honour. And here it
  was, warm and near to me, living, breathing, unsuspecting. Margaret's pride
  was my honour, that I had had no right even to imperil.</p>

  <p>I do not now remember if I thought at that time of going to Isabel and
  putting this new aspect of the case before her. Perhaps I did. Perhaps I may
  have considered even then the possibility of ending what had so freshly and
  passionately begun. If I did, it vanished next day at the sight of her.
  Whatever regrets came in the darkness, the daylight brought an obstinate
  confidence in our resolution again. We would, we declared, "pull the thing
  off." Margaret must not know. Margaret should not know. If Margaret did not
  know, then no harm whatever would be done. We tried to sustain that...</p>

  <p>For a brief time we had been like two people in a magic cell, magically
  cut off from the world and full of a light of its own, and then we began to
  realise that we were not in the least cut off, that the world was all about
  us and pressing in upon us, limiting us, threatening us, resuming possession
  of us. I tried to ignore the injury to Margaret of her unreciprocated
  advances. I tried to maintain to myself that this hidden love made no
  difference to the now irreparable breach between husband and wife. But I
  never spoke of it to Isabel or let her see that aspect of our case. How could
  I? The time for that had gone...</p>

  <p>Then in new shapes and relations came trouble. Distressful elements crept
  in by reason of our unavoidable furtiveness; we ignored them, hid them from
  each other, and attempted to hide them from ourselves. Successful love is a
  thing of abounding pride, and we had to be secret. It was delightful at first
  to be secret, a whispering, warm conspiracy; then presently it became irksome
  and a little shameful. Her essential frankness of soul was all against the
  masks and falsehoods that many women would have enjoyed. Together in our
  secrecy we relaxed, then in the presence of other people again it was
  tiresome to have to watch for the careless, too easy phrase, to snatch back
  one's hand from the limitless betrayal of a light, familiar touch.</p>

  <p>Love becomes a poor thing, at best a poor beautiful thing, if it develops
  no continuing and habitual intimacy. We were always meeting, and most
  gloriously loving and beginning&mdash;and then we had to snatch at
  remorseless ticking watches, hurry to catch trains, and go back to this or
  that. That is all very well for the intrigues of idle people perhaps, but not
  for an intense personal relationship. It is like lighting a candle for the
  sake of lighting it, over and over again, and each time blowing it out. That,
  no doubt, must be very amusing to children playing with the matches, but not
  to people who love warm light, and want it in order to do fine and honourable
  things together. We had achieved&mdash;I give the ugly phrase that expresses
  the increasing discolouration in my mind&mdash;"illicit intercourse." To end
  at that, we now perceived, wasn't in our style. But where were we to
  end?...</p>

  <p>Perhaps we might at this stage have given it up. I think if we could have
  seen ahead and around us we might have done so. But the glow of our cell
  blinded us... I wonder what might have happened if at that time we had given
  it up... We propounded it, we met again in secret to discuss it, and our
  overpowering passion for one another reduced that meeting to absurdity...</p>

  <p>Presently the idea of children crept between us. It came in from all our
  conceptions of life and public service; it was, we found, in the quality of
  our minds that physical love without children is a little weak, timorous,
  more than a little shameful. With imaginative people there very speedily
  comes a time when that realisation is inevitable. We hadn't thought of that
  before&mdash;it isn't natural to think of that before. We hadn't known. There
  is no literature in English dealing with such things.</p>

  <p>There is a necessary sequence of phases in love. These came in their
  order, and with them, unanticipated tarnishings on the first bright
  perfection of our relations. For a time these developing phases were no more
  than a secret and private trouble between us, little shadows spreading by
  imperceptible degrees across that vivid and luminous cell.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 8</h3>

  <p class="first">The Handitch election flung me suddenly into prominence.</p>

  <p>It is still only two years since that struggle, and I will not trouble the
  reader with a detailed history of events that must be quite sufficiently
  present in his mind for my purpose already. Huge stacks of journalism have
  dealt with Handitch and its significance. For the reader very probably, as
  for most people outside a comparatively small circle, it meant my emergence
  from obscurity. We obtruded no editor's name in <i>The Blue Weekly</i>; I had
  never as yet been on the London hoardings. Before Handitch I was a journalist
  and writer of no great public standing; after Handitch, I was definitely a
  person, in the little group of persons who stood for the Young Imperialist
  movement. Handitch was, to a very large extent, my affair. I realised then,
  as a man comes to do, how much one can still grow after seven and twenty. In
  the second election I was a man taking hold of things; at Kinghamstead I had
  been simply a young candidate, a party unit, led about the constituency, told
  to do this and that, and finally washed in by the great Anti-Imperialist
  flood, like a starfish rolling up a beach.</p>

  <p>My feminist views had earnt the mistrust of the party, and I do not think
  I should have got the chance of Handitch or indeed any chance at all of
  Parliament for a long time, if it had not been that the seat with its long
  record of Liberal victories and its Liberal majority of 3642 at the last
  election, offered a hopeless contest. The Liberal dissensions and the belated
  but by no means contemptible Socialist candidate were providential
  interpositions. I think, however, the conduct of Gane, Crupp, and Tarvrille
  in coming down to fight for me, did count tremendously in my favour. "We
  aren't going to win, perhaps," said Crupp, "but we are going to talk." And
  until the very eve of victory, we treated Handitch not so much as a
  battlefield as a hoarding. And so it was the Endowment of Motherhood as a
  practical form of Eugenics got into English politics.</p>

  <p>Plutus, our agent, was scared out of his wits when the thing began.</p>

  <p>"They're ascribing all sorts of queer ideas to you about the Family," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"I think the Family exists for the good of the children," I said; "is that
  queer?"</p>

  <p>"Not when you explain it&mdash;but they won't let you explain it. And
  about marriage&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I'm all right about marriage&mdash;trust me."</p>

  <p>"Of course, if <i>you</i> had children," said Plutus, rather
  inconsiderately...</p>

  <p>They opened fire upon me in a little electioneering rag called <i>The
  Handitch Sentinel</i>, with a string of garbled quotations and
  misrepresentations that gave me an admirable text for a speech. I spoke for
  an hour and ten minutes with a more and more crumpled copy of <i>The
  Sentinel</i> in my hand, and I made the fullest and completest exposition of
  the idea of endowing motherhood that I think had ever been made up to that
  time in England. Its effect on the press was extraordinary. The Liberal
  papers gave me quite unprecedented space under the impression that I had only
  to be given rope to hang myself; the Conservatives cut me down or tried to
  justify me; the whole country was talking. I had had a pamphlet in type upon
  the subject, and I revised this carefully and put it on the book-stalls
  within three days. It sold enormously and brought me bushels of letters. We
  issued over three thousand in Handitch alone. At meeting after meeting I was
  heckled upon nothing else. Long before polling day Plutus was converted.</p>

  <p>"It's catching on like old age pensions," he said. "We've dished the
  Liberals! To think that such a project should come from our side!"</p>

  <p>But it was only with the declaration of the poll that my battle was won.
  No one expected more than a snatch victory, and I was in by over fifteen
  hundred. At one bound Cossington's papers passed from apologetics varied by
  repudiation to triumphant praise. "A renascent England, breeding men," said
  the leader in his chief daily on the morning after the polling, and claimed
  that the Conservatives had been ever the pioneers in sanely bold constructive
  projects.</p>

  <p>I came up to London with a weary but rejoicing Margaret by the night
  train.</p>

     name="chap4_02"></a>II. &mdash; THE IMPOSSIBLE POSITION</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">To any one who did not know of that glowing secret between
  Isabel and myself, I might well have appeared at that time the most
  successful and enviable of men. I had recovered rapidly from an uncongenial
  start in political life; I had become a considerable force through <i>The
  Blue Weekly</i>, and was shaping an increasingly influential body of opinion;
  I had re-entered Parliament with quite dramatic distinction, and in spite of
  a certain faltering on the part of the orthodox Conservatives towards the
  bolder elements in our propaganda, I had loyal and unenvious associates who
  were making me a power in the party. People were coming to our group,
  understandings were developing. It was clear we should play a prominent part
  in the next general election, and that, given a Conservative victory, I
  should be assured of office. The world opened out to me brightly and
  invitingly. Great schemes took shape in my mind, always more concrete, always
  more practicable; the years ahead seemed falling into order, shining with the
  credible promise of immense achievement.</p>

  <p>And at the heart of it all, unseen and unsuspected, was the secret of my
  relations with Isabel&mdash;like a seed that germinates and thrusts, thrusts
  relentlessly.</p>

  <p>From the onset of the Handitch contest onward, my meetings with her had
  been more and more pervaded by the discussion of our situation. It had
  innumerable aspects. It was very present to us that we wanted to be together
  as much as possible&mdash;we were beginning to long very much for actual
  living together in the same house, so that one could come as it were
  carelessly&mdash;unawares&mdash;upon the other, busy perhaps about some
  trivial thing. We wanted to feel each other in the daily atmosphere.
  Preceding our imperatively sterile passion, you must remember, outside it,
  altogether greater than it so far as our individual lives were concerned,
  there had grown and still grew an enormous affection and intellectual
  sympathy between us. We brought all our impressions and all our ideas to each
  other, to see them in each other's light. It is hard to convey that quality
  of intellectual unison to any one who has not experienced it. I thought more
  and more in terms of conversation with Isabel; her possible comments upon
  things would flash into my mind, oh!&mdash;with the very sound of her
  voice.</p>

  <p>I remember, too, the odd effect of seeing her in the distance going about
  Handitch, like any stranger canvasser; the queer emotion of her approach
  along the street, the greeting as she passed. The morning of the polling she
  vanished from the constituency. I saw her for an instant in the passage
  behind our Committee rooms.</p>

  <p>"Going?" said I.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Stay it out. I want you to see the fun. I remember&mdash;the other
  time."</p>

  <p>She didn't answer for a moment or so, and stood with face averted.</p>

  <p>"It's Margaret's show," she said abruptly. "If I see her smiling there
  like a queen by your side&mdash;! She did&mdash;last time. I remember." She
  caught at a sob and dashed her hand across her face impatiently. "Jealous
  fool, mean and petty, jealous fool! ... Good luck, old man, to you! You're
  going to win. But I don't want to see the end of it all the same..."</p>

  <p>"Good-bye!" said I, clasping her hand as some supporter appeared in the
  passage...</p>

  <p>I came back to London victorious, and a little flushed and coarse with
  victory; and so soon as I could break away I went to Isabel's flat and found
  her white and worn, with the stain of secret weeping about her eyes. I came
  into the room to her and shut the door.</p>

  <p>"You said I'd win," I said, and held out my arms.</p>

  <p>She hugged me closely for a moment.</p>

  <p>"My dear," I whispered, "it's nothing&mdash;without
  you&mdash;nothing!"</p>

  <p>We didn't speak for some seconds. Then she slipped from my hold. "Look!"
  she said, smiling like winter sunshine. "I've had in all the morning papers
  &mdash;the pile of them, and you&mdash;resounding."</p>

  <p>"It's more than I dared hope."</p>

  <p>"Or I."</p>

  <p>She stood for a moment still smiling bravely, and then she was sobbing in
  my arms. "The bigger you are&mdash;the more you show," she said&mdash;"the
  more we are parted. I know, I know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I held her close to me, making no answer.</p>

  <p>Presently she became still. "Oh, well," she said, and wiped her eyes and
  sat down on the little sofa by the fire; and I sat down beside her.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know all there was in love," she said, staring at the coals,
  "when we went love-making."</p>

  <p>I put my arm behind her and took a handful of her dear soft hair in my
  hand and kissed it.</p>

  <p>"You've done a great thing this time," she said. "Handitch will make
  you."</p>

  <p>"It opens big chances," I said. "But why are you weeping, dear one?"</p>

  <p>"Envy," she said, "and love."</p>

  <p>"You're not lonely?"</p>

  <p>"I've plenty to do&mdash;and lots of people."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I want you."</p>

  <p>"You've got me."</p>

  <p>She put her arm about me and kissed me. "I want you," she said, "just as
  if I had nothing of you. You don't understand&mdash;how a woman wants a man.
  I thought once if I just gave myself to you it would be enough. It was
  nothing&mdash;it was just a step across the threshold. My dear, every moment
  you are away I ache for you&mdash;ache! I want to be about when it isn't
  love-making or talk. I want to be doing things for you, and watching you when
  you're not thinking of me. All those safe, careless, intimate things. And
  something else&mdash;" She stopped. "Dear, I don't want to bother you. I just
  want you to know I love you..."</p>

  <p>She caught my head in her hands and kissed it, then stood up abruptly.</p>

  <p>I looked up at her, a little perplexed.</p>

  <p>"Dear heart," said I, "isn't this enough? You're my councillor, my
  colleague, my right hand, the secret soul of my life&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And I want to darn your socks," she said, smiling back at me.</p>

  <p>"You're insatiable."</p>

  <p>She smiled "No," she said. "I'm not insatiable, Master. But I'm a woman in
  love. And I'm finding out what I want, and what is necessary to me&mdash;and
  what I can't have. That's all."</p>

  <p>"We get a lot."</p>

  <p>"We want a lot. You and I are greedy people for the things we like,
  Master. It's very evident we've got nearly all we can ever have of one
  another&mdash;and I'm not satisfied."</p>

  <p>"What more is there?</p>

  <p>"For you&mdash;very little. I wonder. For me&mdash;every thing. Yes
  &mdash;everything. You didn't mean it, Master; you didn't know any more than
  I did when I began, but love between a man and a woman is sometimes very one-
  sided. Fearfully one-sided! That's all..."</p>

  <p>"Don't <i>you</i> ever want children?" she said abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I do."</p>

  <p>"You don't!"</p>

  <p>"I haven't thought of them."</p>

  <p>"A man doesn't, perhaps. But I have... I want them&mdash;like hunger.
  <i>Your</i> children, and home with you. Really, continually you! That's the
  trouble... I can't have 'em, Master, and I can't have you."</p>

  <p>She was crying, and through her tears she laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to make a scene," she said, "and get this over. I'm so
  discontented and miserable; I've got to tell you. It would come between us if
  I didn't. I'm in love with you, with everything&mdash;with all my brains.
  I'll pull through all right. I'll be good, Master, never you fear. But to-day
  I'm crying out with all my being. This election&mdash;You're going up; you're
  going on. In these papers&mdash;you're a great big fact. It's suddenly come
  home to me. At the back of my mind I've always had the idea I was going to
  have you somehow presently for myself&mdash;I mean to have you to go long
  tramps with, to keep house for, to get meals for, to watch for of an evening.
  It's a sort of habitual background to my thought of you. And it's
  nonsense&mdash;utter nonsense!" She stopped. She was crying and choking. "And
  the child, you know&mdash;the child!"</p>

  <p>I was troubled beyond measure, but Handitch and its intimations were clear
  and strong.</p>

  <p>"We can't have that," I said.</p>

  <p>"No," she said, "we can't have that."</p>

  <p>"We've got our own things to do."</p>

  <p>"<i>Your</i> things," she said.</p>

  <p>"Aren't they yours too?"</p>

  <p>"Because of you," she said.</p>

  <p>"Aren't they your very own things?"</p>

  <p>"Women don't have that sort of very own thing. Indeed, it's true! And
  think! You've been down there preaching the goodness of children, telling
  them the only good thing in a state is happy, hopeful children, working to
  free mothers and children&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And we give our own children to do it?" I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said. "And sometimes I think it's too much to give&mdash;too
  much altogether... Children get into a woman's brain&mdash;when she mustn't
  have them, especially when she must never hope for them. Think of the child
  we might have now!&mdash;the little creature with soft, tender skin, and
  little hands and little feet! At times it haunts me. It comes and says, Why
  wasn't I given life? I can hear it in the night... The world is full of such
  little ghosts, dear lover&mdash;little things that asked for life and were
  refused. They clamour to me. It's like a little fist beating at my heart.
  Love children, beautiful children. Little cold hands that tear at my heart!
  Oh, my heart and my lord!" She was holding my arm with both her hands and
  weeping against it, and now she drew herself to my shoulder and wept and
  sobbed in my embrace. "I shall never sit with your child on my knee and you
  beside me-never, and I am a woman and your lover! ..."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">But the profound impossibility of our relation was now
  becoming more and more apparent to us. We found ourselves seeking
  justification, clinging passionately to a situation that was coldly,
  pitilessly, impossible and fated. We wanted quite intensely to live together
  and have a child, but also we wanted very many other things that were
  incompatible with these desires. It was extraordinarily difficult to weigh
  our political and intellectual ambitions against those intimate wishes. The
  weights kept altering according as one found oneself grasping this valued
  thing or that. It wasn't as if we could throw everything aside for our love,
  and have that as we wanted it. Love such as we bore one another isn't
  altogether, or even chiefly, a thing in itself&mdash;it is for the most part
  a value set upon things. Our love was interwoven with all our other
  interests; to go out of the world and live in isolation seemed to us like
  killing the best parts of each other; we loved the sight of each other
  engaged finely and characteristically, we knew each other best as activities.
  We had no delusions about material facts; we didn't want each other alive or
  dead, we wanted each other fully alive. We wanted to do big things together,
  and for us to take each other openly and desperately would leave us nothing
  in the world to do. We wanted children indeed passionately, but children with
  every helpful chance in the world, and children born in scandal would be
  handicapped at every turn. We wanted to share a home, and not a solitude.</p>

  <p>And when we were at this stage of realisation, began the intimations that
  we were found out, and that scandal was afoot against us...</p>

  <p>I heard of it first from Esmeer, who deliberately mentioned it, with that
  steady grey eye of his watching me, as an instance of the preposterous
  falsehoods people will circulate. It came to Isabel almost simultaneously
  through a married college friend, who made it her business to demand either
  confirmation or denial. It filled us both with consternation. In the surprise
  of the moment Isabel admitted her secret, and her friend went off "reserving
  her freedom of action."</p>

  <p>Discovery broke out in every direction. Friends with grave faces and an
  atmosphere of infinite tact invaded us both. Other friends ceased to invade
  either of us. It was manifest we had become&mdash;we knew not how&mdash;a
  private scandal, a subject for duologues, an amazement, a perplexity, a vivid
  interest. In a few brief weeks it seemed London passed from absolute
  unsuspiciousness to a chattering exaggeration of its knowledge of our
  relations.</p>

  <p>It was just the most inappropriate time for that disclosure. The long
  smouldering antagonism to my endowment of motherhood ideas had flared up into
  an active campaign in <i>The Expurgator</i>, and it would be altogether
  disastrous to us if I should be convicted of any personal irregularity. It
  was just because of the manifest and challenging respectability of my
  position that I had been able to carry the thing as far as I had done. Now
  suddenly my fortunes had sprung a leak, and scandal was pouring in... It
  chanced, too, that a wave of moral intolerance was sweeping through London,
  one of those waves in which the bitterness of the consciously just finds an
  ally in the panic of the undiscovered. A certain Father Blodgett had been
  preaching against social corruption with extraordinary force, and had roused
  the Church of England people to a kind of competition in denunciation. The
  old methods of the Anti-Socialist campaign had been renewed, and had offered
  far too wide a scope and too tempting an opportunity for private animosity,
  to be restricted to the private affairs of the Socialists. I had intimations
  of an extensive circulation of "private and confidential" letters...</p>

  <p>I think there can be nothing else in life quite like the unnerving
  realisation that rumour and scandal are afoot about one. Abruptly one's
  confidence in the solidity of the universe disappears. One walks silenced
  through a world that one feels to be full of inaudible accusations. One
  cannot challenge the assault, get it out into the open, separate truth and
  falsehood. It slinks from you, turns aside its face. Old acquaintances
  suddenly evaded me, made extraordinary excuses; men who had presumed on the
  verge of my world and pestered me with an intrusive enterprise, now took the
  bold step of flat repudiation. I became doubtful about the return of a nod,
  retracted all those tentacles of easy civility that I had hitherto spread to
  the world. I still grow warm with amazed indignation when I recall that
  Edward Crampton, meeting me full on the steps of the Climax Club, cut me
  dead. "By God!" I cried, and came near catching him by the throat and
  wringing out of him what of all good deeds and bad, could hearten him, a
  younger man than I and empty beyond comparison, to dare to play the judge to
  me. And then I had an open slight from Mrs. Millingham, whom I had counted on
  as one counts upon the sunrise. I had not expected things of that sort; they
  were disconcerting beyond measure; it was as if the world were giving way
  beneath my feet, as though something failed in the essential confidence of
  life, as though a hand of wet ice had touched my heart. Similar things were
  happening to Isabel. Yet we went on working, visiting, meeting, trying to
  ignore this gathering of implacable forces against us.</p>

  <p>For a time I was perplexed beyond measure to account for this campaign.
  Then I got a clue. The centre of diffusion was the Bailey household. The
  Baileys had never forgiven me my abandonment of the young Liberal group they
  had done so much to inspire and organise; their dinner-table had long been a
  scene of hostile depreciation of <i>The Blue Weekly</i> and all its allies;
  week after week Altiora proclaimed that I was "doing nothing," and found
  other causes for our bye-election triumphs; I counted Chambers Street a
  dangerous place for me. Yet, nevertheless, I was astonished to find them
  using a private scandal against me. They did. I think Handitch had filled up
  the measure of their bitterness, for I had not only abandoned them, but I was
  succeeding beyond even their power of misrepresentation. Always I had been a
  wasp in their spider's web, difficult to claim as a tool, uncritical,
  antagonistic. I admired their work and devotion enormously, but I had never
  concealed my contempt for a certain childish vanity they displayed, and for
  the frequent puerility of their political intrigues. I suppose contempt galls
  more than injuries, and anyhow they had me now. They had me. Bailey, I found,
  was warning fathers of girls against me as a "reckless libertine," and
  Altiora, flushed, roguish, and dishevelled, was sitting on her fender curb
  after dinner, and pledging little parties of five or six women at a time with
  infinite gusto not to let the matter go further. Our cell was open to the
  world, and a bleak, distressful daylight streaming in.</p>

  <p>I had a gleam of a more intimate motive in Altiora from the reports that
  came to me. Isabel had been doing a series of five or six articles in the
  <i>Political Review</i> in support of our campaign, <i>The Political
  Review</i> which had hitherto been loyally Baileyite. Quite her best writing
  up to the present, at any rate, is in those papers, and no doubt Altiora had
  had not only to read her in those invaded columns, but listen to her praises
  in the mouths of the tactless influential. Altiora, like so many people who
  rely on gesture and vocal insistence in conversation, writes a poor and
  slovenly prose and handles an argument badly; Isabel has her University
  training behind her and wrote from the first with the stark power of a
  clear-headed man. "Now we know," said Altiora, with just a gleam of malice
  showing through her brightness, "now we know who helps with the writing!"</p>

  <p>She revealed astonishing knowledge.</p>

  <p>For a time I couldn't for the life of me discover her sources. I had,
  indeed, a desperate intention of challenging her, and then I bethought me of
  a youngster named Curmain, who had been my supplemental typist and secretary
  for a time, and whom I had sent on to her before the days of our breach. "Of
  course!" said I, "Curmain!" He was a tall, drooping, sidelong youth with
  sandy hair, a little forward head, and a long thin neck. He stole stamps,
  and, I suspected, rifled my private letter drawer, and I found him one day on
  a turn of the stairs looking guilty and ruffled with a pretty Irish housemaid
  of Margaret's manifestly in a state of hot indignation. I saw nothing, but I
  felt everything in the air between them. I hate this pestering of servants,
  but at the same time I didn't want Curmain wiped out of existence, so I had
  packed him off without unnecessary discussion to Altiora. He was quick and
  cheap anyhow, and I thought her general austerity ought to redeem him if
  anything could; the Chambers Street housemaid wasn't for any man's kissing
  and showed it, and the stamps and private letters were looked after with an
  efficiency altogether surpassing mine. And Altiora, I've no doubt left now
  whatever, pumped this young undesirable about me, and scenting a story, had
  him to dinner alone one evening to get to the bottom of the matter. She got
  quite to the bottom of it,&mdash;it must have been a queer duologue. She read
  Isabel's careless, intimate letters to me, so to speak, by this proxy, and
  she wasn't ashamed to use this information in the service of the bitterness
  that had sprung up in her since our political breach. It was essentially a
  personal bitterness; it helped no public purpose of theirs to get rid of me.
  My downfall in any public sense was sheer waste,&mdash;the loss of a man. She
  knew she was behaving badly, and so, when it came to remonstrance, she
  behaved worse. She'd got names and dates and places; the efficiency of her
  information was irresistible. And she set to work at it marvellously. Never
  before, in all her pursuit of efficient ideals, had Altiora achieved such
  levels of efficiency. I wrote a protest that was perhaps ill-advised and
  angry, I went to her and tried to stop her. She wouldn't listen, she wouldn't
  think, she denied and lied, she behaved like a naughty child of six years old
  which has made up its mind to be hurtful. It wasn't only, I think, that she
  couldn't bear our political and social influence; she also&mdash;I realised
  at that interview couldn't bear our loving. It seemed to her the sickliest
  thing,&mdash;a thing quite unendurable. While such things were, the virtue
  had gone out of her world.</p>

  <p>I've the vividest memory of that call of mine. She'd just come in and
  taken off her hat, and she was grey and dishevelled and tired, and in a
  business-like dress of black and crimson that didn't suit her and was muddy
  about the skirts; she'd a cold in her head and sniffed penetratingly, she
  avoided my eye as she talked and interrupted everything I had to say; she
  kept stabbing fiercely at the cushions of her sofa with a long hat-pin and
  pretending she was overwhelmed with grief at the <i>débâcle</i> she was
  deliberately organising.</p>

  <p>"Then part," she cried, "part. If you don't want a smashing
  up,&mdash;part! You two have got to be parted. You've got never to see each
  other ever, never to speak." There was a zest in her voice. "We're not
  circulating stories," she denied. "No! And Curmain never told us
  anything&mdash;Curmain is an <i>excellent</i> young man; oh! a quite
  excellent young man. You misjudged him altogether."...</p>

  <p>I was equally unsuccessful with Bailey. I caught the little wretch in the
  League Club, and he wriggled and lied. He wouldn't say where he had got his
  facts, he wouldn't admit he had told any one. When I gave him the names of
  two men who had come to me astonished and incredulous, he attempted absurdly
  to make me think they had told <i>him</i>. He did his horrible little best to
  suggest that honest old Quackett, who had just left England for the Cape, was
  the real scandalmonger. That struck me as mean, even for Bailey. I've still
  the odd vivid impression of his fluting voice, excusing the inexcusable, his
  big, shifty face evading me, his perspiration-beaded forehead, the shrugging
  shoulders, and the would-be exculpatory gestures&mdash;Houndsditch gestures
  &mdash;of his enormous ugly hands.</p>

  <p>"I can assure you, my dear fellow," he said; "I can assure you we've done
  everything to shield you&mdash;everything."...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Isabel came after dinner one evening and talked in the
  office. She made a white-robed, dusky figure against the deep blues of my big
  window. I sat at my desk and tore a quill pen to pieces as I talked.</p>

  <p>"The Baileys don't intend to let this drop," I said. "They mean that every
  one in London is to know about it."</p>

  <p>"I know."</p>

  <p>"Well!" I said.</p>

  <p>"Dear heart," said Isabel, facing it, "it's no good waiting for things to
  overtake us; we're at the parting of the ways."</p>

  <p>"What are we to do?"</p>

  <p>"They won't let us go on."</p>

  <p>"Damn them!"</p>

  <p>"They are <i>organising</i> scandal."</p>

  <p>"It's no good waiting for things to overtake us," I echoed; "they have
  overtaken us." I turned on her. "What do you want to do?"</p>

  <p>"Everything," she said. "Keep you and have our work. Aren't we Mates?"</p>

  <p>"We can't."</p>

  <p>"And we can't!"</p>

  <p>"I've got to tell Margaret," I said.</p>

  <p>"Margaret!"</p>

  <p>"I can't bear the idea of any one else getting in front with it. I've been
  wincing about Margaret secretly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know. You'll have to tell her&mdash;and make your peace with her."</p>

  <p>She leant back against the bookcases under the window.</p>

  <p>"We've had some good times, Master;" she said, with a sigh in her
  voice.</p>

  <p>And then for a long time we stared at one another in silence.</p>

  <p>"We haven't much time left," she said.</p>

  <p>"Shall we bolt?" I said.</p>

  <p>"And leave all this?" she asked, with her eyes going round the room. "And
  that?" And her head indicated Westminster. "No!"</p>

  <p>I said no more of bolting.</p>

  <p>"We've got to screw ourselves up to surrender," she said.</p>

  <p>"Something."</p>

  <p>"A lot."</p>

  <p>"Master," she said, "it isn't all sex and stuff between us?"</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"I can't give up the work. Our work's my life."</p>

  <p>We came upon another long pause.</p>

  <p>"No one will believe we've ceased to be lovers&mdash;if we simply do," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"We shouldn't."</p>

  <p>"We've got to do something more parting than that."</p>

  <p>I nodded, and again we paused. She was coming to something.</p>

  <p>"I could marry Shoesmith," she said abruptly.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" I objected.</p>

  <p>"He knows. It wasn't fair. I told him."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that explains," I said. "There's been a kind of
  sulkiness&mdash;But&mdash;you told him?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. "He's rather badly hurt," she said. "He's been a good friend
  to me. He's curiously loyal. But something, something he said one
  day&mdash;forced me to let him know... That's been the beastliness of all
  this secrecy. That's the beastliness of all secrecy. You have to spring
  surprises on people. But he keeps on. He's steadfast. He'd already suspected.
  He wants me very badly to marry him..."</p>

  <p>"But you don't want to marry him?"</p>

  <p>"I'm forced to think of it."</p>

  <p>"But does he want to marry you at that? Take you as a present from the
  world at large?&mdash;against your will and desire? ... I don't understand
  him."</p>

  <p>"He cares for me."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"He thinks this is a fearful mess for me. He wants to pull it
  straight."</p>

  <p>We sat for a time in silence, with imaginations that obstinately refused
  to take up the realities of this proposition.</p>

  <p>"I don't want you to marry Shoesmith," I said at last.</p>

  <p>"Don't you like him?"</p>

  <p>"Not as your husband."</p>

  <p>"He's a very clever and sturdy person&mdash;and very generous and devoted
  to me."</p>

  <p>"And me?"</p>

  <p>"You can't expect that. He thinks you are wonderful&mdash;and, naturally,
  that you ought not to have started this."</p>

  <p>"I've a curious dislike to any one thinking that but myself. I'm quite
  ready to think it myself."</p>

  <p>"He'd let us be friends&mdash;and meet."</p>

  <p>"Let us be friends!" I cried, after a long pause. "You and me!"</p>

  <p>"He wants me to be engaged soon. Then, he says, he can go round fighting
  these rumours, defending us both&mdash;and force a quarrel on the
  Baileys."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand him," I said, and added, "I don't understand you."</p>

  <p>I was staring at her face. It seemed white and set in the dimness.</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean this, Isabel?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"What else is there to do, my dear?&mdash;what else is there to do at all?
  I've been thinking day and night. You can't go away with me. You can't smash
  yourself suddenly in the sight of all men. I'd rather die than that should
  happen. Look what you are becoming in the country! Look at all you've built
  up!&mdash;me helping. I wouldn't let you do it if you could. I wouldn't let
  you&mdash;if it were only for Margaret's sake. <i>This</i>... closes the
  scandal, closes everything."</p>

  <p>"It closes all our life together," I cried.</p>

  <p>She was silent.</p>

  <p>"It never ought to have begun," I said.</p>

  <p>She winced. Then abruptly she was on her knees before me, with her hands
  upon my shoulder and her eyes meeting mine.</p>

  <p>"My dear," she said very earnestly, "don't misunderstand me! Don't think
  I'm retreating from the things we've done! Our love is the best thing I could
  ever have had from life. Nothing can ever equal it; nothing could ever equal
  the beauty and delight you and I have had together. Never! You have loved me;
  you do love me..."</p>

  <p>No one could ever know how to love you as I have loved you; no one could
  ever love me as you have loved me, my king. And it's just because it's been
  so splendid, dear; it's just because I'd die rather than have a tithe of all
  this wiped out of my life again&mdash;for it's made me, it's all I
  am&mdash;dear, it's years since I began loving you&mdash;it's just because of
  its goodness that I want not to end in wreckage now, not to end in the
  smashing up of all the big things I understand in you and love in you...</p>

  <p>"What is there for us if we keep on and go away?" she went on. "All the
  big interests in our lives will vanish&mdash;everything. We shall become
  specialised people&mdash;people overshadowed by a situation. We shall be an
  elopement, a romance&mdash;all our breadth and meaning gone! People will
  always think of it first when they think of us; all our work and aims will be
  warped by it and subordinated to it. Is it good enough, dear? Just to
  specialise... I think of you. We've got a case, a passionate case, the best
  of cases, but do we want to spend all our lives defending it and justifying
  it? And there's that other life. I know now you care for Margaret&mdash;you
  care more than you think you do. You have said fine things of her. I've
  watched you about her. Little things have dropped from you. She's given her
  life for you; she's nothing without you. You feel that to your marrow all the
  time you are thinking about these things. Oh, I'm not jealous, dear. I love
  you for loving her. I love you in relation to her. But there it is, an added
  weight against us, another thing worth saving."</p>

  <p>Presently, I remember, she sat back on her heels and looked up into my
  face. "We've done wrong&mdash;and parting's paying. It's time to pay. We
  needn't have paid, if we'd kept to the track... You and I, Master, we've got
  to be men."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said; "we've got to be men."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">I was driven to tell Margaret about our situation by my
  intolerable dread that otherwise the thing might come to her through some
  stupid and clumsy informant. She might even meet Altiora, and have it from
  her.</p>

  <p>I can still recall the feeling of sitting at my desk that night in that
  large study of mine in Radnor Square, waiting for Margaret to come home. It
  was oddly like the feeling of a dentist's reception-room; only it was for me
  to do the dentistry with clumsy, cruel hands. I had left the door open so
  that she would come in to me.</p>

  <p>I heard her silken rustle on the stairs at last, and then she was in the
  doorway. "May I come in?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Do," I said, and turned round to her.</p>

  <p>"Working?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Hard," I answered. "Where have <i>you</i> been?"</p>

  <p>"At the Vallerys'. Mr. Evesham was talking about you. They were all
  talking. I don't think everybody knew who I was. Just Mrs. Mumble I'd been to
  them. Lord Wardenham doesn't like you."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't."</p>

  <p>"But they all feel you're rather big, anyhow. Then I went on to Park Lane
  to hear a new pianist and some other music at Eva's."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then I looked in at the Brabants' for some midnight tea before I came on
  here. They'd got some writers&mdash;and Grant was there."</p>

  <p>"You <i>have</i> been flying round..."</p>

  <p>There was a little pause between us.</p>

  <p>I looked at her pretty, unsuspecting face, and at the slender grace of her
  golden-robed body. What gulfs there were between us! "You've been amused," I
  said.</p>

  <p>"It's been amusing. You've been at the House?"</p>

  <p>"The Medical Education Bill kept me."...</p>

  <p>After all, why should I tell her? She'd got to a way of living that
  fulfilled her requirements. Perhaps she'd never hear. But all that day and
  the day before I'd been making up my mind to do the thing.</p>

  <p>"I want to tell you something," I said. "I wish you'd sit down for a
  moment or so."...</p>

  <p>Once I had begun, it seemed to me I had to go through with it.</p>

  <p>Something in the quality of my voice gave her an intimation of unusual
  gravity. She looked at me steadily for a moment and sat down slowly in my
  armchair.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she said.</p>

  <p>I went on awkwardly. "I've got to tell you&mdash;something extraordinarily
  distressing," I said.</p>

  <p>She was manifestly altogether unaware.</p>

  <p>"There seems to be a good deal of scandal abroad&mdash;I've only recently
  heard of it&mdash;about myself&mdash;and Isabel."</p>

  <p>"Isabel!"</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"What do they say?" she asked.</p>

  <p>It was difficult, I found, to speak.</p>

  <p>"They say she's my mistress."</p>

  <p>"Oh! How abominable!"</p>

  <p>She spoke with the most natural indignation. Our eyes met.</p>

  <p>"We've been great friends," I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes. And to make <i>that</i> of it. My poor dear! But how can they?" She
  paused and looked at me. "It's so incredible. How can any one believe it? I
  couldn't."</p>

  <p>She stopped, with her distressed eyes regarding me. Her expression changed
  to dread. There was a tense stillness for a second, perhaps.</p>

  <p>I turned my face towards the desk, and took up and dropped a handful of
  paper fasteners.</p>

  <p>"Margaret," I said, "I'm afraid you'll have to believe it."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Margaret sat very still. When I looked at her again, her
  face was very white, and her distressed eyes scrutinised me. Her lips
  quivered as she spoke. "You really mean&mdash;<i>that</i>?" she said.</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"I never dreamt."</p>

  <p>"I never meant you to dream."</p>

  <p>"And that is why&mdash;we've been apart?"</p>

  <p>I thought. "I suppose it is."</p>

  <p>"Why have you told me now?"</p>

  <p>"Those rumours. I didn't want any one else to tell you."</p>

  <p>"Or else it wouldn't have mattered?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>She turned her eyes from me to the fire. Then for a moment she looked
  about the room she had made for me, and then quite silently, with a childish
  quivering of her lips, with a sort of dismayed distress upon her face, she
  was weeping. She sat weeping in her dress of cloth of gold, with her bare
  slender arms dropped limp over the arms of her chair, and her eyes averted
  from me, making no effort to stay or staunch her tears. "I am sorry,
  Margaret," I said. "I was in love... I did not understand..."</p>

  <p>Presently she asked: "What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"You see, Margaret, now it's come to be your affair&mdash;I want to know
  what you&mdash;what you want."</p>

  <p>"You want to leave me?"</p>

  <p>"If you want me to, I must."</p>

  <p>"Leave Parliament&mdash;leave all the things you are doing,&mdash;all this
  fine movement of yours?"</p>

  <p>"No." I spoke sullenly. "I don't want to leave anything. I want to stay
  on. I've told you, because I think we&mdash;Isabel and I, I mean&mdash;have
  got to drive through a storm of scandal anyhow. I don't know how far things
  may go, how much people may feel, and I can't, I can't have you unconscious,
  unarmed, open to any revelation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She made no answer.</p>

  <p>"When the thing began&mdash;I knew it was stupid but I thought it was a
  thing that wouldn't change, wouldn't be anything but itself, wouldn't unfold
  &mdash;consequences... People have got hold of these vague rumours...
  Directly it reached any one else but&mdash;but us two&mdash;I saw it had to
  come to you."</p>

  <p>I stopped. I had that distressful feeling I have always had with Margaret,
  of not being altogether sure she heard, of being doubtful if she understood.
  I perceived that once again I had struck at her and shattered a thousand
  unsubstantial pinnacles. And I couldn't get at her, to help her, or touch her
  mind! I stood up, and at my movement she moved. She produced a dainty little
  handkerchief, and made an effort to wipe her face with it, and held it to her
  eyes. "Oh, my Husband!" she sobbed.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean to do?" she said, with her voice muffled by her
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"We're going to end it," I said.</p>

  <p>Something gripped me tormentingly as I said that. I drew a chair beside
  her and sat down. "You and I, Margaret, have been partners," I began. "We've
  built up this life of ours together; I couldn't have done it without you.
  We've made a position, created a work&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "You," she said.</p>

  <p>"You helping. I don't want to shatter it&mdash;if you don't want it
  shattered. I can't leave my work. I can't leave you. I want you to
  have&mdash;all that you have ever had. I've never meant to rob you. I've made
  an immense and tragic blunder. You don't know how things took us, how
  different they seemed! My character and accident have conspired&mdash;We'll
  pay&mdash;in ourselves, not in our public service."</p>

  <p>I halted again. Margaret remained very still.</p>

  <p>"I want you to understand that the thing is at an end. It is definitely at
  an end. We&mdash;we talked&mdash;yesterday. We mean to end it altogether." I
  clenched my hands. "She's&mdash;she's going to marry Arnold Shoesmith."</p>

  <p>I wasn't looking now at Margaret any more, but I heard the rustle of her
  movement as she turned on me.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," I said, clinging to my explanation. "We're doing nothing
  shabby. He knows. He will. It's all as right&mdash;as things can be now.
  We're not cheating any one, Margaret. We're doing things straight&mdash;now.
  Of course, you know... We shall&mdash;we shall have to make sacrifices. Give
  things up pretty completely. Very completely... We shall have not to see each
  other for a time, you know. Perhaps not a long time. Two or three years. Or
  write&mdash;or just any of that sort of thing ever&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Some subconscious barrier gave way in me. I found myself crying
  uncontrollably&mdash;as I have never cried since I was a little child. I was
  amazed and horrified at myself. And wonderfully, Margaret was on her knees
  beside me, with her arms about me, mingling her weeping with mine. "Oh, my
  Husband!" she cried, "my poor Husband! Does it hurt you so? I would do
  anything! Oh, the fool I am! Dear, I love you. I love you over and away and
  above all these jealous little things!"</p>

  <p>She drew down my head to her as a mother might draw down the head of a
  son. She caressed me, weeping bitterly with me. "Oh! my dear," she sobbed,
  "my dear! I've never seen you cry! I've never seen you cry. Ever! I didn't
  know you could. Oh! my dear! Can't you have her, my dear, if you want her? I
  can't bear it! Let me help you, dear. Oh! my Husband! My Man! I can't bear to
  have you cry!" For a time she held me in silence.</p>

  <p>"I've thought this might happen, I dreamt it might happen. You two, I
  mean. It was dreaming put it into my head. When I've seen you together, so
  glad with each other... Oh! Husband mine, believe me! believe me! I'm stupid,
  I'm cold, I'm only beginning to realise how stupid and cold, but all I want
  in all the world is to give my life to you."...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">"We can't part in a room," said Isabel.</p>

  <p>"We'll have one last talk together," I said, and planned that we should
  meet for a half a day between Dover and Walmer and talk ourselves out. I
  still recall that day very well, recall even the curious exaltation of grief
  that made our mental atmosphere distinctive and memorable. We had seen so
  much of one another, had become so intimate, that we talked of parting even
  as we parted with a sense of incredible remoteness. We went together up over
  the cliffs, and to a place where they fall towards the sea, past the white,
  quaint-lanterned lighthouses of the South Foreland. There, in a kind of niche
  below the crest, we sat talking. It was a spacious day, serenely blue and
  warm, and on the wrinkled water remotely below a black tender and six hooded
  submarines came presently, and engaged in mysterious manoeuvers. Shrieking
  gulls and chattering jackdaws circled over us and below us, and dived and
  swooped; and a skerry of weedy, fallen chalk appeared, and gradually
  disappeared again, as the tide fell and rose.</p>

  <p>We talked and thought that afternoon on every aspect of our relations. It
  seems to me now we talked so wide and far that scarcely an issue in the life
  between man and woman can arise that we did not at least touch upon. Lying
  there at Isabel's feet, I have become for myself a symbol of all this world-
  wide problem between duty and conscious, passionate love the world has still
  to solve. Because it isn't solved; there's a wrong in it either way.. .. The
  sky, the wide horizon, seemed to lift us out of ourselves until we were
  something representative and general. She was womanhood become articulate,
  talking to her lover.</p>

  <p>"I ought," I said, "never to have loved you."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't a thing planned," she said.</p>

  <p>"I ought never to have let our talk slip to that, never to have turned
  back from America."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad we did it," she said. "Don't think I repent."</p>

  <p>I looked at her.</p>

  <p>"I will never repent," she said. "Never!" as though she clung to her life
  in saying it.</p>

  <p>I remember we talked for a long time of divorce. It seemed to us then, and
  it seems to us still, that it ought to have been possible for Margaret to
  divorce me, and for me to marry without the scandalous and ugly publicity,
  the taint and ostracism that follow such a readjustment. We went on to the
  whole perplexing riddle of marriage. We criticised the current code, how
  muddled and conventionalised it had become, how modified by subterfuges and
  concealments and new necessities, and the increasing freedom of women. "It's
  all like Bromstead when the building came," I said; for I had often talked to
  her of that early impression of purpose dissolving again into chaotic forces.
  "There is no clear right in the world any more. The world is Byzantine. The
  justest man to-day must practise a tainted goodness."</p>

  <p>These questions need discussion&mdash;a magnificent frankness of
  discussion&mdash;if any standards are again to establish an effective hold
  upon educated people. Discretions, as I have said already, will never hold
  any one worth holding&mdash;longer than they held us. Against every "shalt
  not" there must be a "why not" plainly put,&mdash;the "why not" largest and
  plainest, the law deduced from its purpose. "You and I, Isabel," I said,
  "have always been a little disregardful of duty, partly at least because the
  idea of duty comes to us so ill-clad. Oh! I know there's an extravagant
  insubordinate strain in us, but that wasn't all. I wish humbugs would leave
  duty alone. I wish all duty wasn't covered with slime. That's where the real
  mischief comes in. Passion can always contrive to clothe itself in beauty,
  strips itself splendid. That carried us. But for all its mean associations
  there is this duty...</p>

  <p>"Don't we come rather late to it?"</p>

  <p>"Not so late that it won't be atrociously hard to do."</p>

  <p>"It's queer to think of now," said Isabel. "Who could believe we did all
  we have done honestly? Well, in a manner honestly. Who could believe we
  thought this might be hidden? Who could trace it all step by step from the
  time when we found that a certain boldness in our talk was pleasing? We
  talked of love... Master, there's not much for us to do in the way of
  Apologia that any one will credit. And yet if it were possible to tell the
  very heart of our story...</p>

  <p>"Does Margaret really want to go on with you?" she asked&mdash;"shield
  you&mdash;knowing of ... <i>This</i>?"</p>

  <p>"I'm certain. I don't understand&mdash;just as I don't understand
  Shoesmith, but she does. These people walk on solid ground which is just thin
  air to us. They've got something we haven't got. Assurances? I
  wonder."...</p>

  <p>Then it was, or later, we talked of Shoesmith, and what her life might be
  with him.</p>

  <p>"He's good," she said; "he's kindly. He's everything but magic. He's the
  very image of the decent, sober, honourable life. You can't say a thing
  against him or I&mdash;except that something&mdash;something in his
  imagination, something in the tone of his voice&mdash;fails for me. Why don't
  I love him?&mdash;he's a better man than you! Why don't you? IS he a better
  man than you? He's usage, he's honour, he's the right thing, he's the breed
  and the tradition,&mdash;a gentleman. You're your erring, incalculable self.
  I suppose we women will trust this sort and love your sort to the very end of
  time..."</p>

  <p>We lay side by side and nibbled at grass stalks as we talked. It seemed
  enormously unreasonable to us that two people who had come to the pitch of
  easy and confident affection and happiness that held between us should be
  obliged to part and shun one another, or murder half the substance of their
  lives. We felt ourselves crushed and beaten by an indiscriminating machine
  which destroys happiness in the service of jealousy. "The mass of people
  don't feel these things in quite the same manner as we feel them," she said.
  "Is it because they're different in grain, or educated out of some primitive
  instinct?"</p>

  <p>"It's because we've explored love a little, and they know no more than the
  gateway," I said. "Lust and then jealousy; their simple conception&mdash;and
  we have gone past all that and wandered hand in hand..."</p>

  <p>I remember that for a time we watched two of that larger sort of gull,
  whose wings are brownish-white, circle and hover against the blue. And then
  we lay and looked at a band of water mirror clear far out to sea, and
  wondered why the breeze that rippled all the rest should leave it so
  serene.</p>

  <p>"And in this State of ours," I resumed.</p>

  <p>"Eh!" said Isabel, rolling over into a sitting posture and looking out at
  the horizon. "Let's talk no more of things we can never see. Talk to me of
  the work you are doing and all we shall do&mdash;after we have parted. We've
  said too little of that. We've had our red life, and it's over. Thank Heaven!
  &mdash;though we stole it! Talk about your work, dear, and the things we'll
  go on doing&mdash;just as though we were still together. We'll still be
  together in a sense&mdash;through all these things we have in common."</p>

  <p>And so we talked of politics and our outlook. We were interested to the
  pitch of self-forgetfulness. We weighed persons and forces, discussed the
  probabilities of the next general election, the steady drift of public
  opinion in the north and west away from Liberalism towards us. It was very
  manifest that in spite of Wardenham and the EXPURGATOR, we should come into
  the new Government strongly. The party had no one else, all the young men
  were formally or informally with us; Esmeer would have office, Lord
  Tarvrille, I ... and very probably there would be something for Shoesmith.
  "And for my own part," I said, "I count on backing on the Liberal side. For
  the last two years we've been forcing competition in constructive legislation
  between the parties. The Liberals have not been long in following up our
  Endowment of Motherhood lead. They'll have to give votes and lip service
  anyhow. Half the readers of <i>The Blue Weekly</i>, they say, are
  Liberals...</p>

  <p>"I remember talking about things of this sort with old Willersley," I
  said, "ever so many years ago. It was some place near Locarno, and we looked
  down the lake that shone weltering&mdash;just as now we look over the sea.
  And then we dreamt in an indistinct featureless way of all that you and I are
  doing now."</p>

  <p>"I!" said Isabel, and laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, of some such thing," I said, and remained for awhile silent,
  thinking of Locarno.</p>

  <p>I recalled once more the largeness, the release from small personal things
  that I had felt in my youth; statecraft became real and wonderful again with
  the memory, the gigantic handling of gigantic problems. I began to talk out
  my thoughts, sitting up beside her, as I could never talk of them to any one
  but Isabel; began to recover again the purpose that lay under all my
  political ambitions and adjustments and anticipations. I saw the State,
  splendid and wide as I had seen it in that first travel of mine, but now it
  was no mere distant prospect of spires and pinnacles, but populous with fine-
  trained, bold-thinking, bold-doing people. It was as if I had forgotten for a
  long time and now remembered with amazement.</p>

  <p>At first, I told her, I had been altogether at a loss how I could do
  anything to battle against the aimless muddle of our world; I had wanted a
  clue&mdash;until she had come into my life questioning, suggesting,
  unconsciously illuminating. "But I have done nothing," she protested. I
  declared she had done everything in growing to education under my eyes, in
  reflecting again upon all the processes that had made myself, so that instead
  of abstractions and blue-books and bills and devices, I had realised the
  world of mankind as a crowd needing before all things fine women and men.
  We'd spoilt ourselves in learning that, but anyhow we had our lesson. Before
  her I was in a nineteenth-century darkness, dealing with the nation as if it
  were a crowd of selfish men, forgetful of women and children and that shy
  wild thing in the hearts of men, love, which must be drawn upon as it has
  never been drawn upon before, if the State is to live. I saw now how it is
  possible to bring the loose factors of a great realm together, to create a
  mind of literature and thought in it, and the expression of a purpose to make
  it self-conscious and fine. I had it all clear before me, so that at a score
  of points I could presently begin. <i>The Blue Weekly</i> was a centre of
  force. Already we had given Imperialism a criticism, and leavened half the
  press from our columns. Our movement consolidated and spread. We should
  presently come into power. Everything moved towards our hands. We should be
  able to get at the schools, the services, the universities, the church;
  enormously increase the endowment of research, and organise what was sorely
  wanted, a criticism of research; contrive a closer contact between the press
  and creative intellectual life; foster literature, clarify, strengthen the
  public consciousness, develop social organisation and a sense of the State.
  Men were coming to us every day, brilliant young peers like Lord Dentonhill,
  writers like Carnot and Cresswell. It filled me with pride to win such men.
  "We stand for so much more than we seem to stand for," I said. I opened my
  heart to her, so freely that I hesitate to open my heart even to the reader,
  telling of projects and ambitions I cherished, of my consciousness of great
  powers and widening opportunities...</p>

  <p>Isabel watched me as I talked.</p>

  <p>She too, I think, had forgotten these things for a while. For it is
  curious and I think a very significant thing that since we had become lovers,
  we had talked very little of the broader things that had once so strongly
  gripped our imaginations.</p>

  <p>"It's good," I said, "to talk like this to you, to get back to youth and
  great ambitions with you. There have been times lately when politics has
  seemed the pettiest game played with mean tools for mean ends&mdash;and none
  the less so that the happiness of three hundred million people might be
  touched by our follies. I talk to no one else like this... And now I think of
  parting, I think but of how much more I might have talked to you."...</p>

  <p>Things drew to an end at last, but after we had spoken of a thousand
  things.</p>

  <p>"We've talked away our last half day," I said, staring over my shoulder at
  the blazing sunset sky behind us. "Dear, it's been the last day of our lives
  for us... It doesn't seem like the last day of our lives. Or any day."</p>

  <p>"I wonder how it will feel?" said Isabel.</p>

  <p>"It will be very strange at first&mdash;not to be able to tell you
  things."</p>

  <p>"I've a superstition that after&mdash;after we've parted&mdash;if ever I
  go into my room and talk, you'll hear. You'll be&mdash;somewhere."</p>

  <p>"I shall be in the world&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>"I don't feel as though these days ahead were real. Here we are, here we
  remain."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I feel that. As though you and I were two immortals, who didn't live
  in time and space at all, who never met, who couldn't part, and here we lie
  on Olympus. And those two poor creatures who did meet, poor little Richard
  Remington and Isabel Rivers, who met and loved too much and had to part, they
  part and go their ways, and we lie here and watch them, you and I. She'll
  cry, poor dear."</p>

  <p>"She'll cry. She's crying now!"</p>

  <p>"Poor little beasts! I think he'll cry too. He winces. He could&mdash;for
  tuppence. I didn't know he had lachrymal glands at all until a little while
  ago. I suppose all love is hysterical&mdash;and a little foolish. Poor mites!
  Silly little pitiful creatures! How we have blundered! Think how we must look
  to God! Well, we'll pity them, and then we'll inspire him to stiffen up again
  &mdash;and do as we've determined he shall do. We'll see it through,&mdash;we
  who lie here on the cliff. They'll be mean at times, and horrid at times; we
  know them! Do you see her, a poor little fine lady in a great
  house,&mdash;she sometimes goes to her room and writes."</p>

  <p>"She writes for his <i>Blue Weekly</i> still."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Sometimes&mdash;I hope. And he's there in the office with a bit of
  her copy in his hand."</p>

  <p>"Is it as good as if she still talked it over with him before she wrote
  it? Is it?"</p>

  <p>"Better, I think. Let's play it's better&mdash;anyhow. It may be that
  talking over was rather mixed with love-making. After all, love-making is joy
  rather than magic. Don't let's pretend about that even... Let's go on
  watching him. (I don't see why her writing shouldn't be better. Indeed I
  don't.) See! There he goes down along the Embankment to Westminster just like
  a real man, for all that he's smaller than a grain of dust. What is running
  round inside that speck of a head of his? Look at him going past the
  Policemen, specks too&mdash;selected large ones from the country. I think
  he's going to dinner with the Speaker&mdash;some old thing like that. Is his
  face harder or commoner or stronger?&mdash;I can't quite see... And now he's
  up and speaking in the House. Hope he'll hold on to the thread. He'll have to
  plan his speeches to the very end of his days&mdash;and learn the
  headings."</p>

  <p>"Isn't she up in the women's gallery to hear him?"</p>

  <p>"No. Unless it's by accident."</p>

  <p>"She's there," she said.</p>

  <p>"Well, by accident it happens. Not too many accidents, Isabel. Never any
  more adventures for us, dear, now. No! ... They play the game, you know.
  They've begun late, but now they've got to. You see it's not so very hard for
  them since you and I, my dear, are here always, always faithfully here on
  this warm cliff of love accomplished, watching and helping them under high
  heaven. It isn't so <i>very</i> hard. Rather good in some ways. Some people
  <i>have</i> to be broken a little. Can you see Altiora down there, by any
  chance?"</p>

  <p>"She's too little to be seen," she said.</p>

  <p>"Can you see the sins they once committed?"</p>

  <p>"I can only see you here beside me, dear&mdash;for ever. For all my life,
  dear, till I die. Was that&mdash;the sin?"...</p>

  <p>I took her to the station, and after she had gone I was to drive to Dover,
  and cross to Calais by the night boat. I couldn't, I felt, return to London.
  We walked over the crest and down to the little station of Martin Mill side
  by side, talking at first in broken fragments, for the most part of
  unimportant things.</p>

  <p>"None of this," she said abruptly, "seems in the slightest degree real to
  me. I've got no sense of things ending."</p>

  <p>"We're parting," I said.</p>

  <p>"We're parting&mdash;as people part in a play. It's distressing. But I
  don't feel as though you and I were really never to see each other again for
  years. Do you?"</p>

  <p>I thought. "No," I said.</p>

  <p>"After we've parted I shall look to talk it over with you."</p>

  <p>"So shall I."</p>

  <p>"That's absurd."</p>

  <p>"Absurd."</p>

  <p>"I feel as if you'd always be there, just about where you are now.
  Invisible perhaps, but there. We've spent so much of our lives joggling
  elbows."...</p>

  <p>"Yes. Yes. I don't in the least realise it. I suppose I shall begin to
  when the train goes out of the station. Are we wanting in imagination,
  Isabel?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. We've always assumed it was the other way about."</p>

  <p>"Even when the train goes out of the station&mdash;! I've seen you into so
  many trains."</p>

  <p>"I shall go on thinking of things to say to you&mdash;things to put in
  your letters. For years to come. How can I ever stop thinking in that way
  now? We've got into each other's brains."</p>

  <p>"It isn't real," I said; "nothing is real. The world's no more than a
  fantastic dream. Why are we parting, Isabel?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It seems now supremely silly. I suppose we have to. Can't
  we meet?&mdash;don't you think we shall meet even in dreams?"</p>

  <p>"We'll meet a thousand times in dreams," I said.</p>

  <p>"I wish we could dream at the same time," said Isabel... "Dream walks. I
  can't believe, dear, I shall never have a walk with you again."</p>

  <p>"If I'd stayed six months in America," I said, "we might have walked long
  walks and talked long talks for all our lives."</p>

  <p>"Not in a world of Baileys," said Isabel. "And anyhow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped short. I looked interrogation.</p>

  <p>"We've loved," she said.</p>

  <p>I took her ticket, saw to her luggage, and stood by the door of the
  compartment. "Good-bye," I said a little stiffly, conscious of the people
  upon the platform. She bent above me, white and dusky, looking at me very
  steadfastly.</p>

  <p>"Come here," she whispered. "Never mind the porters. What can they know?
  Just one time more&mdash;I must."</p>

  <p>She rested her hand against the door of the carriage and bent down upon
  me, and put her cold, moist lips to mine.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap4_03"
     name="chap4_03"></a>III. &mdash; THE BREAKING POINT</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">And then we broke down. We broke our faith with both
  Margaret and Shoesmith, flung career and duty out of our lives, and went away
  together.</p>

  <p>It is only now, almost a year after these events, that I can begin to see
  what happened to me. At the time it seemed to me I was a rational,
  responsible creature, but indeed I had not parted from her two days before I
  became a monomaniac to whom nothing could matter but Isabel. Every truth had
  to be squared to that obsession, every duty. It astounds me to think how I
  forgot Margaret, forgot my work, forgot everything but that we two were
  parted. I still believe that with better chances we might have escaped the
  consequences of the emotional storm that presently seized us both. But we had
  no foresight of that, and no preparation for it, and our circumstances
  betrayed us. It was partly Shoesmith's unwisdom in delaying his marriage
  until after the end of the session&mdash;partly my own amazing folly in
  returning within four days to Westminster. But we were all of us intent upon
  the defeat of scandal and the complete restoration of appearances. It seemed
  necessary that Shoesmith's marriage should not seem to be hurried, still more
  necessary that I should not vanish inexplicably. I had to be visible with
  Margaret in London just as much as possible; we went to restaurants, we
  visited the theatre; we could even contemplate the possibility of my presence
  at the wedding. For that, however, we had schemed a weekend visit to Wales,
  and a fictitious sprained ankle at the last moment which would justify my
  absence...</p>

  <p>I cannot convey to you the intolerable wretchedness and rebellion of my
  separation from Isabel. It seemed that in the past two years all my thoughts
  had spun commisures to Isabel's brain and I could think of nothing that did
  not lead me surely to the need of the one intimate I had found in the world.
  I came back to the House and the office and my home, I filled all my days
  with appointments and duty, and it did not save me in the least from a lonely
  emptiness such as I had never felt before in all my life. I had little sleep.
  In the daytime I did a hundred things, I even spoke in the House on two
  occasions, and by my own low standards spoke well, and it seemed to me that I
  was going about in my own brain like a hushed survivor in a house whose owner
  lies dead upstairs.</p>

  <p>I came to a crisis after that wild dinner of Tarvrille's. Something in
  that stripped my soul bare.</p>

  <p>It was an occasion made absurd and strange by the odd accident that the
  house caught fire upstairs while we were dining below. It was a men's dinner
  &mdash;"A dinner of all sorts," said Tarvrille, when he invited me;
  "everything from Evesham and Gane to Wilkins the author, and Heaven knows
  what will happen!" I remember that afterwards Tarvrille was accused of having
  planned the fire to make his dinner a marvel and a memory. It was indeed a
  wonderful occasion, and I suppose if I had not been altogether drenched in
  misery, I should have found the same wild amusement in it that glowed in all
  the others. There were one or two university dons, Lord George Fester, the
  racing man, Panmure, the artist, two or three big City men, Weston Massinghay
  and another prominent Liberal whose name I can't remember, the three men
  Tarvrille had promised and Esmeer, Lord Wrassleton, Waulsort, the member for
  Monckton, Neal and several others. We began a little coldly, with duologues,
  but the conversation was already becoming general&mdash;so far as such a long
  table permitted&mdash;when the fire asserted itself.</p>

  <p>It asserted itself first as a penetrating and emphatic smell of burning
  rubber,&mdash;it was caused by the fusing of an electric wire. The reek
  forced its way into the discussion of the Pekin massacres that had sprung up
  between Evesham, Waulsort, and the others at the end of the table. "Something
  burning," said the man next to me.</p>

  <p>"Something must be burning," said Panmure.</p>

  <p>Tarvrille hated undignified interruptions. He had a particularly
  imperturbable butler with a cadaverous sad face and an eye of rigid
  disapproval. He spoke to this individual over his shoulder. "Just see, will
  you," he said, and caught up the pause in the talk to his left.</p>

  <p>Wilkins was asking questions, and I, too, was curious. The story of the
  siege of the Legations in China in the year 1900 and all that followed upon
  that, is just one of those disturbing interludes in history that refuse to
  join on to that general scheme of protestation by which civilisation is
  maintained. It is a break in the general flow of experience as disconcerting
  to statecraft as the robbery of my knife and the scuffle that followed it had
  been to me when I was a boy at Penge. It is like a tear in a curtain
  revealing quite unexpected backgrounds. I had never given the business a
  thought for years; now this talk brought back a string of pictures to my
  mind; how the reliefs arrived and the plundering began, how section after
  section of the International Army was drawn into murder and pillage, how the
  infection spread upward until the wives of Ministers were busy looting, and
  the very sentinels stripped and crawled like snakes into the Palace they were
  set to guard. It did not stop at robbery, men were murdered, women, being
  plundered, were outraged, children were butchered, strong men had found
  themselves with arms in a lawless, defenceless city, and this had followed.
  Now it was all recalled.</p>

  <p>"Respectable ladies addicted to district visiting at home were as bad as
  any one," said Panmure. "Glazebrook told me of one&mdash;flushed like a woman
  at a bargain sale, he said&mdash;and when he pointed out to her that the silk
  she'd got was bloodstained, she just said, 'Oh, bother!' and threw it aside
  and went back..."</p>

  <p>We became aware that Tarvrille's butler had returned. We tried not to seem
  to listen.</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon, m'lord," he said. "The house IS on fire, m'lord."</p>

  <p>"Upstairs, m'lord."</p>

  <p>"Just overhead, m'lord."</p>

  <p>"The maids are throwing water, m'lord, and I've telephoned FIRE."</p>

  <p>"No, m'lord, no immediate danger."</p>

  <p>"It's all right," said Tarvrille to the table generally. "Go on! It's not
  a general conflagration, and the fire brigade won't be five minutes. Don't
  see that it's our affair. The stuff's insured. They say old Lady
  Paskershortly was dreadful. Like a harpy. The Dowager Empress had shown her
  some little things of hers. Pet things&mdash;hidden away. Susan went straight
  for them&mdash;used to take an umbrella for the silks. Born shoplifter."</p>

  <p>It was evident he didn't want his dinner spoilt, and we played up
  loyally.</p>

  <p>"This is recorded history," said Wilkins,&mdash;"practically. It makes one
  wonder about unrecorded history. In India, for example."</p>

  <p>But nobody touched that.</p>

  <p>"Thompson," said Tarvrille to the imperturbable butler, and indicating the
  table generally, "champagne. Champagne. Keep it going."</p>

  <p>"M'lord," and Thompson marshalled his assistants.</p>

  <p>Some man I didn't know began to remember things about Mandalay. "It's
  queer," he said, "how people break out at times;" and told his story of an
  army doctor, brave, public-spirited, and, as it happened, deeply religious,
  who was caught one evening by the excitement of plundering&mdash;and stole
  and hid, twisted the wrist of a boy until it broke, and was afterwards
  overcome by wild remorse.</p>

  <p>I watched Evesham listening intently. "Strange," he said, "very strange.
  We are such stuff as thieves are made of. And in China, too, they murdered
  people&mdash;for the sake of murdering. Apart, so to speak, from mercenary
  considerations. I'm afraid there's no doubt of it in certain cases. No doubt
  at all. Young soldiers fresh from German high schools and English homes!"</p>

  <p>"Did <i>our</i> people?" asked some patriot.</p>

  <p>"Not so much. But I'm afraid there were cases... Some of the Indian troops
  were pretty bad."</p>

  <p>Gane picked up the tale with confirmations.</p>

  <p>It is all printed in the vividest way as a picture upon my memory, so that
  were I a painter I think I could give the deep rich browns and warm greys
  beyond the brightly lit table, the various distinguished faces, strongly
  illuminated, interested and keen, above the black and white of evening dress,
  the alert menservants with their heavier, clean-shaved faces indistinctly
  seen in the dimness behind. Then this was coloured emotionally for me by my
  aching sense of loss and sacrifice, and by the chance trend of our talk to
  the breaches and unrealities of the civilised scheme. We seemed a little
  transitory circle of light in a universe of darkness and violence; an effect
  to which the diminishing smell of burning rubber, the trampling of feet
  overhead, the swish of water, added enormously. Everybody&mdash;unless,
  perhaps, it was Evesham&mdash;drank rather carelessly because of the
  suppressed excitement of our situation, and talked the louder and more
  freely.</p>

  <p>"But what a flimsy thing our civilisation is!" said Evesham; "a mere thin
  net of habits and associations!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose those men came back," said Wilkins.</p>

  <p>"Lady Paskershortly did!" chuckled Evesham.</p>

  <p>"How do they fit it in with the rest of their lives?" Wilkins speculated.
  "I suppose there's Pekin-stained police officers, Pekin-stained J.
  P.'s&mdash;trying petty pilferers in the severest manner."...</p>

  <p>Then for a time things became preposterous. There was a sudden cascade of
  water by the fireplace, and then absurdly the ceiling began to rain upon us,
  first at this point and then that. "My new suit!" cried some one.
  "Perrrrrr-up pe-rr"&mdash;a new vertical line of blackened water would
  establish itself and form a spreading pool upon the gleaming cloth. The men
  nearest would arrange catchment areas of plates and flower bowls. "Draw up!"
  said Tarvrille, "draw up. That's the bad end of the table!" He turned to the
  imperturbable butler. "Take round bath towels," he said; and presently the
  men behind us were offering&mdash;with inflexible dignity&mdash;"Port wine,
  Sir. Bath towel, Sir!" Waulsort, with streaks of blackened water on his
  forehead, was suddenly reminded of a wet year when he had followed the French
  army manoeuvres. An animated dispute sprang up between him and Neal about the
  relative efficiency of the new French and German field guns. Wrassleton
  joined in and a little drunken shrivelled Oxford don of some sort with a
  black-splashed shirt front who presently silenced them all by the immensity
  and particularity of his knowledge of field artillery. Then the talk drifted
  to Sedan and the effect of dead horses upon drinking-water, which brought
  Wrassleton and Weston Massinghay into a dispute of great vigour and emphasis.
  "The trouble in South Africa," said Weston Massinghay, "wasn't that we didn't
  boil our water. It was that we didn't boil our men. The Boers drank the same
  stuff we did. <i>They</i> didn't get dysentery."</p>

  <p>That argument went on for some time. I was attacked across the table by a
  man named Burshort about my Endowment of Motherhood schemes, but in the gaps
  of that debate I could still hear Weston Massinghay at intervals repeat in a
  rather thickened voice: "<i>They</i> didn't get dysentery."</p>

  <p>I think Evesham went early. The rest of us clustered more and more closely
  towards the drier end of the room, the table was pushed along, and the area
  beneath the extinguished conflagration abandoned to a tinkling, splashing
  company of pots and pans and bowls and baths. Everybody was now disposed to
  be hilarious and noisy, to say startling and aggressive things; we must have
  sounded a queer clamour to a listener in the next room. The devil inspired
  them to begin baiting me. "Ours isn't the Tory party any more," said
  Burshort. "Remington has made it the Obstetric Party."</p>

  <p>"That's good!" said Weston Massinghay, with all his teeth gleaming; "I
  shall use that against you in the House!"</p>

  <p>"I shall denounce you for abusing private confidences if you do," said
  Tarvrille.</p>

  <p>"Remington wants us to give up launching Dreadnoughts and launch babies
  instead," Burshort urged. "For the price of one Dreadnought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The little shrivelled don who had been omniscient about guns joined in the
  baiting, and displayed himself a venomous creature. Something in his eyes
  told me he knew Isabel and hated me for it. "Love and fine thinking," he
  began, a little thickly, and knocking over a wine-glass with a too easy
  gesture. "Love and fine thinking. Two things don't go together. No philosophy
  worth a damn ever came out of excesses of love. Salt Lake
  City&mdash;Piggott&mdash;Ag&mdash;Agapemone again&mdash;no works to
  matter."</p>

  <p>Everybody laughed.</p>

  <p>"Got to rec'nise these facts," said my assailant. "Love and fine think'n
  pretty phrase&mdash;attractive. Suitable for p'litical dec'rations. Postcard,
  Christmas, gilt lets, in a wreath of white flow's. Not oth'wise
  valu'ble."</p>

  <p>I made some remark, I forget what, but he overbore me.</p>

  <p>Real things we want are Hate&mdash;Hate and <i>coarse</i> think'n. I
  b'long to the school of Mrs. F's Aunt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What?" said some one, intent.</p>

  <p>"In 'Little Dorrit,'" explained Tarvrille; "go on!"</p>

  <p>"Hate a fool," said my assailant.</p>

  <p>Tarvrille glanced at me. I smiled to conceal the loss of my temper.</p>

  <p>"Hate," said the little man, emphasising his point with a clumsy fist.
  "Hate's the driving force. What's m'rality?&mdash;hate of rotten goings on.
  What's patriotism?&mdash;hate of int'loping foreigners. What's Radicalism?
  &mdash;hate of lords. What's Toryism?&mdash;hate of disturbance. It's all
  hate&mdash;hate from top to bottom. Hate of a mess. Remington owned it the
  other day, said he hated a mu'll. There you are! If you couldn't get hate
  into an election, damn it (hic) people wou'n't poll. Poll for love!&mdash;no'
  me!"</p>

  <p>He paused, but before any one could speak he had resumed.</p>

  <p>"Then this about fine thinking. Like going into a bear pit armed with a
  tagle&mdash;talgent&mdash;talgent galv'nometer. Like going to fight a mad dog
  with Shasepear and the Bible. Fine thinking&mdash;what we want is the
  thickes' thinking we can get. Thinking that stands up alone. Taf Reform means
  work for all, thassort of thing."</p>

  <p>The gentleman from Cambridge paused. "<i>You</i> a flag!" he said. "I'd as
  soon go to ba'ell und' wet tissue paper!"</p>

  <p>My best answer on the spur of the moment was:</p>

  <p>"The Japanese did." Which was absurd.</p>

  <p>I went on to some other reply, I forget exactly what, and the talk of the
  whole table drew round me. It was an extraordinary revelation to me. Every
  one was unusually careless and outspoken, and it was amazing how manifestly
  they echoed the feeling of this old Tory spokesman. They were quite friendly
  to me, they regarded me and <i>The Blue Weekly</i> as valuable party assets
  for Toryism, but it was clear they attached no more importance to what were
  my realities than they did to the remarkable therapeutic claims of Mrs. Eddy.
  They were flushed and amused, perhaps they went a little too far in their
  resolves to draw me, but they left the impression on my mind of men
  irrevocably set upon narrow and cynical views of political life. For them the
  political struggle was a game, whose counters were human hate and human
  credulity; their real aim was just every one's aim, the preservation of the
  class and way of living to which their lives were attuned. They did not know
  how tired I was, how exhausted mentally and morally, nor how cruel their
  convergent attack on me chanced to be. But my temper gave way, I became tart
  and fierce, perhaps my replies were a trifle absurd, and Tarvrille, with that
  quick eye and sympathy of his, came to the rescue. Then for a time I sat
  silent and drank port wine while the others talked. The disorder of the room,
  the still dripping ceiling, the noise, the displaced ties and crumpled shirts
  of my companions, jarred on my tormented nerves...</p>

  <p>It was long past midnight when we dispersed. I remember Tarvrille coming
  with me into the hall, and then suggesting we should go upstairs to see the
  damage. A manservant carried up two flickering candles for us. One end of the
  room was gutted, curtains, hangings, several chairs and tables were
  completely burnt, the panelling was scorched and warped, three smashed
  windows made the candles flare and gutter, and some scraps of broken china
  still lay on the puddled floor.</p>

  <p>As we surveyed this, Lady Tarvrille appeared, back from some party, a
  slender, white-cloaked, satin-footed figure with amazed blue eyes beneath her
  golden hair. I remember how stupidly we laughed at her surprise.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">I parted from Panmure at the corner of Aldington Street, and
  went my way alone. But I did not go home, I turned westward and walked for a
  long way, and then struck northward aimlessly. I was too miserable to go to
  my house.</p>

  <p>I wandered about that night like a man who has discovered his Gods are
  dead. I can look back now detached yet sympathetic upon that wild confusion
  of moods and impulses, and by it I think I can understand, oh! half the
  wrongdoing and blundering in the world.</p>

  <p>I do not feel now the logical force of the process that must have
  convinced me then that I had made my sacrifice and spent my strength in vain.
  At no time had I been under any illusion that the Tory party had higher
  ideals than any other party, yet it came to me like a thing newly discovered
  that the men I had to work with had for the most part no such dreams, no
  sense of any collective purpose, no atom of the faith I held. They were just
  as immediately intent upon personal ends, just as limited by habits of
  thought, as the men in any other group or party. Perhaps I had slipped
  unawares for a time into the delusions of a party man&mdash;but I do not
  think so.</p>

  <p>No, it was the mood of profound despondency that had followed upon the
  abrupt cessation of my familiar intercourse with Isabel, that gave this fact
  that had always been present in my mind its quality of devastating
  revelation. It seemed as though I had never seen before nor suspected the
  stupendous gap between the chaotic aims, the routine, the conventional
  acquiescences, the vulgarisations of the personal life, and that clearly
  conscious development and service of a collective thought and purpose at
  which my efforts aimed. I had thought them but a little way apart, and now I
  saw they were separated by all the distance between earth and heaven. I saw
  now in myself and every one around me, a concentration upon interests close
  at hand, an inability to detach oneself from the provocations, tendernesses,
  instinctive hates, dumb lusts and shy timidities that touched one at every
  point; and, save for rare exalted moments, a regardlessness of broader aims
  and remoter possibilities that made the white passion of statecraft seem as
  unearthly and irrelevant to human life as the story an astronomer will tell,
  half proven but altogether incredible, of habitable planets and answering
  intelligences, suns' distances uncounted across the deep. It seemed to me I
  had aspired too high and thought too far, had mocked my own littleness by
  presumption, had given the uttermost dear reality of life for a theoriser's
  dream.</p>

  <p>All through that wandering agony of mine that night a dozen threads of
  thought interwove; now I was a soul speaking in protest to God against a task
  too cold and high for it, and now I was an angry man, scorned and pointed
  upon, who had let life cheat him of the ultimate pride of his soul. Now I was
  the fool of ambition, who opened his box of gold to find blank emptiness, and
  now I was a spinner of flimsy thoughts, whose web tore to rags at a touch. I
  realised for the first time how much I had come to depend upon the mind and
  faith of Isabel, how she had confirmed me and sustained me, how little
  strength I had to go on with our purposes now that she had vanished from my
  life. She had been the incarnation of those great abstractions, the saving
  reality, the voice that answered back. There was no support that night in the
  things that had been. We were alone together on the cliff for ever
  more!&mdash;that was very pretty in its way, but it had no truth whatever
  that could help me now, no ounce of sustaining value. I wanted Isabel that
  night, no sentiment or memory of her, but Isabel alive,&mdash;to talk to me,
  to touch me, to hold me together. I wanted unendurably the dusky gentleness
  of her presence, the consolation of her voice.</p>

  <p>We were alone together on the cliff! I startled a passing cabman into
  interest by laughing aloud at that magnificent and characteristic
  sentimentality. What a lie it was, and how satisfying it had been! That was
  just where we shouldn't remain. We of all people had no distinction from that
  humanity whose lot is to forget. We should go out to other interests, new
  experiences, new demands. That tall and intricate fabric of ambitious
  understandings we had built up together in our intimacy would be the first to
  go; and last perhaps to endure with us would be a few gross memories of
  sights and sounds, and trivial incidental excitements...</p>

  <p>I had a curious feeling that night that I had lost touch with life for a
  long time, and had now been reminded of its quality. That infernal little
  don's parody of my ruling phrase, "Hate and coarse thinking," stuck in my
  thoughts like a poisoned dart, a centre of inflammation. Just as a man who is
  debilitated has no longer the vitality to resist an infection, so my mind,
  slackened by the crisis of my separation from Isabel, could find no
  resistance to his emphatic suggestion. It seemed to me that what he had said
  was overpoweringly true, not only of contemporary life, but of all possible
  human life. Love is the rare thing, the treasured thing; you lock it away
  jealously and watch, and well you may; hate and aggression and force keep the
  streets and rule the world. And fine thinking is, in the rough issues of
  life, weak thinking, is a balancing indecisive process, discovers with
  disloyal impartiality a justice and a defect on each disputing side. "Good
  honest men," as Dayton calls them, rule the world, with a way of thinking out
  decisions like shooting cartloads of bricks, and with a steadfast pleasure in
  hostility. Dayton liked to call his antagonists "blaggards and
  scoundrels"&mdash;it justified his opposition&mdash;the Lords were
  "scoundrels," all people richer than be were "scoundrels," all Socialists,
  all troublesome poor people; he liked to think of jails and justice being
  done. His public spirit was saturated with the sombre joys of conflict and
  the pleasant thought of condign punishment for all recalcitrant souls. That
  was the way of it, I perceived. That had survival value, as the biologists
  say. He was fool enough in politics to be a consistent and happy
  politician...</p>

  <p>Hate and coarse thinking; how the infernal truth of the phrase beat me
  down that night! I couldn't remember that I had known this all along, and
  that it did not really matter in the slightest degree. I had worked it all
  out long ago in other terms, when I had seen how all parties stood for
  interests inevitably, and how the purpose in life achieves itself, if it
  achieves itself at all, as a bye product of the war of individuals and
  classes. Hadn't I always known that science and philosophy elaborate
  themselves in spite of all the passion and narrowness of men, in spite of the
  vanities and weakness of their servants, in spite of all the heated disorder
  of contemporary things? Wasn't it my own phrase to speak of "that greater
  mind in men, in which we are but moments and transitorily lit cells?" Hadn't
  I known that the spirit of man still speaks like a thing that struggles out
  of mud and slime, and that the mere effort to speak means choking and
  disaster? Hadn't I known that we who think without fear and speak without
  discretion will not come to our own for the next two thousand years?</p>

  <p>It was the last was most forgotten of all that faith mislaid. Before
  mankind, in my vision that night, stretched new centuries of confusion, vast
  stupid wars, hastily conceived laws, foolish temporary triumphs of order,
  lapses, set-backs, despairs, catastrophes, new beginnings, a multitudinous
  wilderness of time, a nigh plotless drama of wrong-headed energies. In order
  to assuage my parting from Isabel we had set ourselves to imagine great
  rewards for our separation, great personal rewards; we had promised ourselves
  success visible and shining in our lives. To console ourselves in our
  separation we had made out of <i>The Blue Weekly</i> and our young Tory
  movement preposterously enormous things-as though those poor fertilising
  touches at the soil were indeed the germinating seeds of the millennium, as
  though a million lives such as ours had not to contribute before the
  beginning of the beginning. That poor pretence had failed. That magnificent
  proposition shrivelled to nothing in the black loneliness of that night.</p>

  <p>I saw that there were to be no such compensations. So far as my real
  services to mankind were concerned I had to live an unrecognised and
  unrewarded life. If I made successes it would be by the way. Our separation
  would alter nothing of that. My scandal would cling to me now for all my
  life, a thing affecting relationships, embarrassing and hampering my spirit.
  I should follow the common lot of those who live by the imagination, and
  follow it now in infinite loneliness of soul; the one good comforter, the one
  effectual familiar, was lost to me for ever; I should do good and evil
  together, no one caring to understand; I should produce much weary work, much
  bad-spirited work, much absolute evil; the good in me would be too often
  ill-expressed and missed or misinterpreted. In the end I might leave one
  gleaming flake or so amidst the slag heaps for a moment of postmortem
  sympathy. I was afraid beyond measure of my derelict self. Because I believed
  with all my soul in love and fine thinking that did not mean that I should
  necessarily either love steadfastly or think finely. I remember how I fell
  talking to God&mdash;I think I talked out loud. "Why do I care for these
  things?" I cried, "when I can do so little! Why am I apart from the jolly
  thoughtless fighting life of men? These dreams fade to nothingness, and leave
  me bare!"</p>

  <p>I scolded. "Why don't you speak to a man, show yourself? I thought I had a
  gleam of you in Isabel,&mdash;and then you take her away. Do you really think
  I can carry on this game alone, doing your work in darkness and silence,
  living in muddled conflict, half living, half dying?"</p>

  <p>Grotesque analogies arose in my mind. I discovered a strange parallelism
  between my now tattered phrase of "Love and fine thinking" and the "Love and
  the Word" of Christian thought. Was it possible the Christian propaganda had
  at the outset meant just that system of attitudes I had been feeling my way
  towards from the very beginning of my life? Had I spent a lifetime making my
  way back to Christ? It mocks humanity to think how Christ has been overlaid.
  I went along now, recalling long-neglected phrases and sentences; I had a new
  vision of that great central figure preaching love with hate and coarse
  thinking even in the disciples about Him, rising to a tidal wave at last in
  that clamour for Barabbas, and the public satisfaction in His fate...</p>

  <p>It's curious to think that hopeless love and a noisy disordered dinner
  should lead a man to these speculations, but they did. "He DID mean that!" I
  said, and suddenly thought of what a bludgeon they'd made of His
  Christianity. Athwart that perplexing, patient enigma sitting inaudibly among
  publicans and sinners, danced and gibbered a long procession of the champions
  of orthodoxy. "He wasn't human," I said, and remembered that last despairing
  cry, "My God! My God! why hast Thou forsaken Me?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>he</i> forsakes every one," I said, flying out as a tired mind
  will, with an obvious repartee...</p>

  <p>I passed at a bound from such monstrous theology to a towering rage
  against the Baileys. In an instant and with no sense of absurdity I wanted
  &mdash;in the intervals of love and fine thinking&mdash;to fling about that
  strenuously virtuous couple; I wanted to kick Keyhole of the PEEPSHOW into
  the gutter and make a common massacre of all the prosperous rascaldom that
  makes a trade and rule of virtue. I can still feel that transition. In a
  moment I had reached that phase of weakly decisive anger which is for people
  of my temperament the concomitant of exhaustion.</p>

  <p>"I will have her," I cried. "By Heaven! I <i>will</i> have her! Life mocks
  me and cheats me. Nothing can be made good to me again... Why shouldn't I
  save what I can? I can't save myself without her..."</p>

  <p>I remember myself&mdash;as a sort of anti-climax to that&mdash;rather
  tediously asking my way home. I was somewhere in the neighbourhood of Holland
  Park...</p>

  <p>It was then between one and two. I felt that I could go home now without
  any risk of meeting Margaret. It had been the thought of returning to
  Margaret that had sent me wandering that night. It is one of the ugliest
  facts I recall about that time of crisis, the intense aversion I felt for
  Margaret. No sense of her goodness, her injury and nobility, and the enormous
  generosity of her forgiveness, sufficed to mitigate that. I hope now that in
  this book I am able to give something of her silvery splendour, but all
  through this crisis I felt nothing of that. There was a triumphant kindliness
  about her that I found intolerable. She meant to be so kind to me, to offer
  unstinted consolation, to meet my needs, to supply just all she imagined
  Isabel had given me.</p>

  <p>When I left Tarvrille's, I felt I could anticipate exactly how she would
  meet my homecoming. She would be perplexed by my crumpled shirt front, on
  which I had spilt some drops of wine; she would overlook that by an effort,
  explain it sentimentally, resolve it should make no difference to her. She
  would want to know who had been present, what we had talked about, show the
  alertest interest in whatever it was&mdash;it didn't matter what... No, I
  couldn't face her.</p>

  <p>So I did not reach my study until two o'clock.</p>

  <p>There, I remember, stood the new and very beautiful old silver
  candlesticks that she had set there two days since to please me&mdash;the
  foolish kindliness of it! But in her search for expression, Margaret heaped
  presents upon me. She had fitted these candlesticks with electric lights, and
  I must, I suppose, have lit them to write my note to Isabel. "Give me a word
  &mdash;the world aches without you," was all I scrawled, though I fully meant
  that she should come to me. I knew, though I ought not to have known, that
  now she had left her flat, she was with the Balfes&mdash;she was to have been
  married from the Balfes&mdash;and I sent my letter there. And I went out into
  the silent square and posted the note forthwith, because I knew quite clearly
  that if I left it until morning I should never post it at all.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">I had a curious revulsion of feeling that morning of our
  meeting. (Of all places for such a clandestine encounter she had chosen the
  bridge opposite Buckingham Palace.) Overnight I had been full of self pity,
  and eager for the comfort of Isabel's presence. But the ill-written scrawl in
  which she had replied had been full of the suggestion of her own weakness and
  misery. And when I saw her, my own selfish sorrows were altogether swept away
  by a wave of pitiful tenderness. Something had happened to her that I did not
  understand. She was manifestly ill. She came towards me wearily, she who had
  always borne herself so bravely; her shoulders seemed bent, and her eyes were
  tired, and her face white and drawn. All my life has been a narrow
  self-centred life; no brothers, no sisters or children or weak things had
  ever yet made any intimate appeal to me, and suddenly&mdash;I verily believe
  for the first time in my life!&mdash;I felt a great passion of protective
  ownership; I felt that here was something that I could die to shelter,
  something that meant more than joy or pride or splendid ambitions or splendid
  creation to me, a new kind of hold upon me, a new power in the world. Some
  sealed fountain was opened in my breast. I knew that I could love Isabel
  broken, Isabel beaten, Isabel ugly and in pain, more than I could love any
  sweet or delightful or glorious thing in life. I didn't care any more for
  anything in the world but Isabel, and that I should protect her. I trembled
  as I came near her, and could scarcely speak to her for the emotion that
  filled me...</p>

  <p>"I had your letter," I said.</p>

  <p>"I had yours."</p>

  <p>"Where can we talk?"</p>

  <p>I remember my lame sentences. "We'll have a boat. That's best here."</p>

  <p>I took her to the little boat-house, and there we hired a boat, and I
  rowed in silence under the bridge and into the shade of a tree. The square
  grey stone masses of the Foreign Office loomed through the twigs, I remember,
  and a little space of grass separated us from the pathway and the scrutiny of
  passers-by. And there we talked.</p>

  <p>"I had to write to you," I said.</p>

  <p>"I had to come."</p>

  <p>"When are you to be married?"</p>

  <p>"Thursday week."</p>

  <p>"Well?" I said. "But&mdash;can we?"</p>

  <p>She leant forward and scrutinised my face with eyes wide open. "What do
  you mean?" she said at last in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Can we stand it? After all?"</p>

  <p>I looked at her white face. "Can you?" I said.</p>

  <p>She whispered. "Your career?"</p>

  <p>Then suddenly her face was contorted,&mdash;she wept silently, exactly as
  a child tormented beyond endurance might suddenly weep...</p>

  <p>"Oh! I don't care," I cried, "now. I don't care. Damn the whole system of
  things! Damn all this patching of the irrevocable! I want to take care of
  you, Isabel! and have you with me."</p>

  <p>"I can't stand it," she blubbered.</p>

  <p>"You needn't stand it. I thought it was best for you... I thought indeed
  it was best for you. I thought even you wanted it like that."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't I live alone&mdash;as I meant to do?"</p>

  <p>"No," I said, "you couldn't. You're not strong enough. I've thought of
  that; I've got to shelter you."</p>

  <p>"And I want you," I went on. "I'm not strong enough&mdash;I can't stand
  life without you."</p>

  <p>She stopped weeping, she made a great effort to control herself, and
  looked at me steadfastly for a moment. "I was going to kill myself," she
  whispered. "I was going to kill myself quietly&mdash;somehow. I meant to wait
  a bit and have an accident. I thought&mdash;you didn't understand. You were a
  man, and couldn't understand..."</p>

  <p>"People can't do as we thought we could do," I said. "We've gone too far
  together."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, and I stared into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"The horror of it," she whispered. "The horror of being handed over. It's
  just only begun to dawn upon me, seeing him now as I do. He tries to be kind
  to me... I didn't know. I felt adventurous before... It makes me feel like
  all the women in the world who have ever been owned and subdued... It's not
  that he isn't the best of men, it's because I'm a part of you... I can't go
  through with it. If I go through with it, I shall be left&mdash;robbed of
  pride&mdash;outraged&mdash;a woman beaten..."</p>

  <p>"I know," I said, "I know."</p>

  <p>"I want to live alone... I don't care for anything now but just escape. If
  you can help me..."</p>

  <p>"I must take you away. There's nothing for us but to go away
  together."</p>

  <p>"But your work," she said; "your career! Margaret! Our promises!"</p>

  <p>"We've made a mess of things, Isabel&mdash;or things have made a mess of
  us. I don't know which. Our flags are in the mud, anyhow. It's too late to
  save those other things! They have to go. You can't make terms with defeat. I
  thought it was Margaret needed me most. But it's you. And I need you. I
  didn't think of that either. I haven't a doubt left in the world now. We've
  got to leave everything rather than leave each other. I'm sure of it. Now we
  have gone so far. We've got to go right down to earth and begin again...
  Dear, I <i>want</i> disgrace with you..."</p>

  <p>So I whispered to her as she sat crumpled together on the faded cushions
  of the boat, this white and weary young woman who had been so valiant and
  careless a girl. "I don't care," I said. "I don't care for anything, if I can
  save you out of the wreckage we have made together."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">The next day I went to the office of <i>The Blue Weekly</i>
  in order to get as much as possible of its affairs in working order before I
  left London with Isabel. I just missed Shoesmith in the lower office.
  Upstairs I found Britten amidst a pile of outside articles, methodically
  reading the title of each and sometimes the first half-dozen lines, and
  either dropping them in a growing heap on the floor for a clerk to return, or
  putting them aside for consideration. I interrupted him, squatted on the
  window-sill of the open window, and sketched out my ideas for the
  session.</p>

  <p>"You're far-sighted," he remarked at something of mine which reached out
  ahead.</p>

  <p>"I like to see things prepared," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, and ripped open the envelope of a fresh aspirant.</p>

  <p>I was silent while he read.</p>

  <p>"You're going away with Isabel Rivers," he said abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Well!" I said, amazed.</p>

  <p>"I know," he said, and lost his breath. "Not my business. Only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was queer to find Britten afraid to say a thing.</p>

  <p>"It's not playing the game," he said.</p>

  <p>"What do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Everything that matters."</p>

  <p>"Some games," I said, "are too hard to play."</p>

  <p>There came a pause between us.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know you were watching all this," I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered, after a pause, "I've watched."</p>

  <p>"Sorry&mdash;sorry you don't approve."</p>

  <p>"It means smashing such an infernal lot of things, Remington."</p>

  <p>I did not answer.</p>

  <p>"You're going away then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Soon?"</p>

  <p>"Right away."</p>

  <p>"There's your wife."</p>

  <p>"I know."</p>

  <p>"Shoesmith&mdash;whom you're pledged to in a manner. You've just picked
  him out and made him conspicuous. Every one will know. Oh! of
  course&mdash;it's nothing to you. Honour&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know."</p>

  <p>"Common decency."</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"All this movement of ours. That's what I care for most... It's come to be
  a big thing, Remington."</p>

  <p>"That will go on."</p>

  <p>"We have a use for you&mdash;no one else quite fills it. No one... I'm not
  sure it will go on."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I haven't thought of all these things?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders, and rejected two papers unread.</p>

  <p>"I knew," he remarked, "when you came back from America. You were alight
  with it." Then he let his bitterness gleam for a moment. "But I thought you
  would stick to your bargain."</p>

  <p>"It's not so much choice as you think," I said.</p>

  <p>"There's always a choice."</p>

  <p>"No," I said.</p>

  <p>He scrutinised my face.</p>

  <p>"I can't live without her&mdash;I can't work. She's all mixed up with
  this&mdash;and everything. And besides, there's things you can't understand.
  There's feelings you've never felt... You don't understand how much we've
  been to one another."</p>

  <p>Britten frowned and thought.</p>

  <p>"Some things one's <i>got</i> to do," he threw out.</p>

  <p>"Some things one can't do."</p>

  <p>"These infernal institutions&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Some one must begin," I said.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "Not <i>you</i>," he said. "No!"</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hands on the desk before him, and spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Remington," he said, "I've thought of this business day and night too. It
  matters to me. It matters immensely to me. In a way&mdash;it's a thing one
  doesn't often say to a man&mdash;I've loved you. I'm the sort of man who
  leads a narrow life... But you've been something fine and good for me, since
  that time, do you remember? when we talked about Mecca together."</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes. And you'll always be something fine and good for me anyhow. I know
  things about you,&mdash;qualities&mdash;no mere act can destroy them.. ..
  Well, I can tell you, you're doing wrong. You're going on now like a man who
  is hypnotised and can't turn round. You're piling wrong on wrong. It was
  wrong for you two people ever to be lovers."</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>"It gripped us hard," I said.</p>

  <p>"Yes!&mdash;but in your position! And hers! It was vile!"</p>

  <p>"You've not been tempted."</p>

  <p>"How do you know? Anyhow&mdash;having done that, you ought to have stood
  the consequences and thought of other people. You could have ended it at the
  first pause for reflection. You didn't. You blundered again. You kept on. You
  owed a certain secrecy to all of us! You didn't keep it. You were careless.
  You made things worse. This engagement and this publicity!&mdash;Damn it,
  Remington!"</p>

  <p>"I know," I said, with smarting eyes. "Damn it! with all my heart! It came
  of trying to patch... You <i>can't</i> patch."</p>

  <p>"And now, as I care for anything under heaven, Remington, you two ought to
  stand these last consequences&mdash;and part. You ought to part. Other people
  have to stand things! Other people have to part. You ought to. You say
  &mdash;what do you say? It's loss of so much life to lose each other. So is
  losing a hand or a leg. But it's what you've incurred. Amputate. Take your
  punishment&mdash;After all, you chose it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, damn!" I said, standing up and going to the window.</p>

  <p>"Damn by all means. I never knew a topic so full of justifiable damns. But
  you two did choose it. You ought to stick to your undertaking."</p>

  <p>I turned upon him with a snarl in my voice. "My dear Britten!" I cried.
  "Don't I <i>know</i> I'm doing wrong? Aren't I in a net? Suppose I don't go!
  Is there any right in that? Do you think we're going to be much to ourselves
  or any one after this parting? I've been thinking all last night of this
  business, trying it over and over again from the beginning. How was it we
  went wrong? Since I came back from America&mdash;I grant you
  <i>that</i>&mdash;but SINCE, there's never been a step that wasn't forced,
  that hadn't as much right in it or more, as wrong. You talk as though I was a
  thing of steel that could bend this way or that and never change. You talk as
  though Isabel was a cat one could give to any kind of owner... We two are
  things that change and grow and alter all the time. We're&mdash;so interwoven
  that being parted now will leave us just misshapen cripples... You don't know
  the motives, you don't know the rush and feel of things, you don't know how
  it was with us, and how it is with us. You don't know the hunger for the mere
  sight of one another; you don't know anything."</p>

  <p>Britten looked at his finger-nails closely. His red face puckered to a wry
  frown. "Haven't we all at times wanted the world put back?" he grunted, and
  looked hard and close at one particular nail.</p>

  <p>There was a long pause.</p>

  <p>"I want her," I said, "and I'm going to have her. I'm too tired for
  balancing the right or wrong of it any more. You can't separate them. I saw
  her yesterday... She's&mdash;ill... I'd take her now, if death were just
  outside the door waiting for us."</p>

  <p>"Torture?"</p>

  <p>I thought. "Yes."</p>

  <p>"For her?"</p>

  <p>"There isn't," I said.</p>

  <p>"If there was?"</p>

  <p>I made no answer.</p>

  <p>"It's blind Want. And there's nothing ever been put into you to stand
  against it. What are you going to do with the rest of your lives?"</p>

  <p>"No end of things."</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you are right," I said. "I believe we can save
  something&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Britten shook his head. "Some scraps of salvage won't excuse you," he
  said.</p>

  <p>His indignation rose. "In the middle of life!" he said. "No man has a
  right to take his hand from the plough!"</p>

  <p>He leant forward on his desk and opened an argumentative palm. "You know,
  Remington," he said, "and I know, that if this could be fended off for six
  months&mdash;if you could be clapped in prison, or got out of the way
  somehow,&mdash;until this marriage was all over and settled down for a year,
  say&mdash;you know then you two could meet, curious, happy, as friends.
  Saved! You <i>know</i> it."</p>

  <p>I turned and stared at him. "You're wrong, Britten," I said. "And does it
  matter if we could?"</p>

  <p>I found that in talking to him I could frame the apologetics I had not
  been able to find for myself alone.</p>

  <p>"I am certain of one thing, Britten. It is our duty not to hush up this
  scandal."</p>

  <p>He raised his eyebrows. I perceived now the element of absurdity in me,
  but at the time I was as serious as a man who is burning.</p>

  <p>"It's our duty," I went on, "to smash now openly in the sight of every
  one. Yes! I've got that as clean and plain&mdash;as prison whitewash. I am
  convinced that we have got to be public to the uttermost now&mdash;I mean it
  &mdash;until every corner of our world knows this story, knows it fully, adds
  it to the Parnell story and the Ashton Dean story and the Carmel story and
  the Witterslea story, and all the other stories that have picked man after
  man out of English public life, the men with active imaginations, the men of
  strong initiative. To think this tottering old-woman ridden Empire should
  dare to waste a man on such a score! You say I ought to be
  penitent&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Britten shook his head and smiled very faintly.</p>

  <p>"I'm boiling with indignation," I said. "I lay in bed last night and went
  through it all. What in God's name was to be expected of us but what has
  happened? I went through my life bit by bit last night, I recalled all I've
  had to do with virtue and women, and all I was told and how I was prepared. I
  was born into cowardice and debasement. We all are. Our generation's grimy
  with hypocrisy. I came to the most beautiful things in life&mdash;like
  peeping Tom of Coventry. I was never given a light, never given a touch of
  natural manhood by all this dingy, furtive, canting, humbugging English
  world. Thank God! I'll soon be out of it! The shame of it! The very savages
  in Australia initiate their children better than the English do to-day.
  Neither of us was ever given a view of what they call morality that didn't
  make it show as shabby subservience, as the meanest discretion, an abject
  submission to unreasonable prohibitions! meek surrender of mind and body to
  the dictation of pedants and old women and fools. We weren't taught&mdash;we
  were mumbled at! And when we found that the thing they called unclean,
  unclean, was Pagan beauty&mdash;God! it was a glory to sin, Britten, it was a
  pride and splendour like bathing in the sunlight after dust and grime!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Britten. "That's all very well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I interrupted him. "I know there's a case&mdash;I'm beginning to think it
  a valid case against us; but we never met it! There's a steely pride in self
  restraint, a nobility of chastity, but only for those who see and think and
  act&mdash;untrammeled and unafraid. The other thing, the current thing, why!
  it's worth as much as the chastity of a monkey kept in a cage by itself!" I
  put my foot in a chair, and urged my case upon him. "This is a dirty world,
  Britten, simply because it is a muddled world, and the thing you call
  morality is dirtier now than the thing you call immorality. Why don't the
  moralists pick their stuff out of the slime if they care for it, and wipe
  it?&mdash;damn them! I am burning now to say: 'Yes, we did this and this,' to
  all the world. All the world! ... I will!"</p>

  <p>Britten rubbed the palm of his hand on the corner of his desk. "That's all
  very well, Remington," he said. "You mean to go."</p>

  <p>He stopped and began again. "If you didn't know you were in the wrong you
  wouldn't be so damned rhetorical. You're in the wrong. It's as plain to you
  as it is to me. You're leaving a big work, you're leaving a wife who trusted
  you, to go and live with your jolly mistress... You won't see you're a
  statesman that matters, that no single man, maybe, might come to such
  influence as you in the next ten years. You're throwing yourself away and
  accusing your country of rejecting you."</p>

  <p>He swung round upon his swivel at me. "Remington," he said, "have you
  forgotten the immense things our movement means?"</p>

  <p>I thought. "Perhaps I am rhetorical," I said.</p>

  <p>"But the things we might achieve! If you'd only stay now&mdash;even now!
  Oh! you'd suffer a little socially, but what of that? You'd be able to go
  on&mdash;perhaps all the better for hostility of the kind you'd get. You
  know, Remington&mdash;you <i>know</i>."</p>

  <p>I thought and went back to his earlier point. "If I am rhetorical, at any
  rate it's a living feeling behind it. Yes, I remember all the implications of
  our aims&mdash;very splendid, very remote. But just now it's rather like
  offering to give a freezing man the sunlit Himalayas from end to end in
  return for his camp-fire. When you talk of me and my jolly mistress, it isn't
  fair. That misrepresents everything. I'm not going out of this&mdash;for
  delights. That's the sort of thing men like Snuffles and Keyhole
  imagine&mdash;that excites them! When I think of the things these creatures
  think! Ugh! But <i>you</i> know better? You know that physical passion that
  burns like a fire&mdash;ends clean. I'm going for love, Britten&mdash;if I
  sinned for passion. I'm going, Britten, because when I saw her the other day
  she <i>hurt</i> me. She hurt me damnably, Britten... I've been a cold
  man&mdash;I've led a rhetorical life&mdash;you hit me with that word!&mdash;I
  put things in a windy way, I know, but what has got hold of me at last is her
  pain. She's ill. Don't you understand? She's a sick thing&mdash;a weak thing.
  She's no more a goddess than I'm a god... I'm not in love with her now; I'm
  RAW with love for her. I feel like a man that's been flayed. I have been
  flayed... You don't begin to imagine the sort of helpless solicitude... She's
  not going to do things easily; she's ill. Her courage fails... It's hard to
  put things when one isn't rhetorical, but it's this, Britten&mdash;there are
  distresses that matter more than all the delights or achievements in the
  world... I made her what she is&mdash;as I never made Margaret. I've made
  her&mdash;I've broken her... I'm going with my own woman. The rest of my life
  and England, and so forth, must square itself to that..."</p>

  <p>For a long time, as it seemed, we remained silent and motionless. We'd
  said all we had to say. My eyes caught a printed slip upon the desk before
  him, and I came back abruptly to the paper.</p>

  <p>I picked up this galley proof. It was one of Winter's essays. "This man
  goes on doing first-rate stuff," I said. "I hope you will keep him
  going."</p>

  <p>He did not answer for a moment or so. "I'll keep him going," he said at
  last with a sigh.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">I have a letter Margaret wrote me within a week of our
  flight. I cannot resist transcribing some of it here, because it lights
  things as no word of mine can do. It is a string of nearly inconsecutive
  thoughts written in pencil in a fine, tall, sprawling hand. Its very
  inconsecutiveness is essential. Many words are underlined. It was in answer
  to one from me; but what I wrote has passed utterly from my mind...</p>

  <p>"Certainly," she says, "I want to hear from you, but I do not want to see
  you. There's a sort of abstract <i>you</i> that I want to go on with.
  Something I've made out of you... I want to know things about you&mdash;but I
  don't want to see or feel or imagine. When some day I have got rid of my
  intolerable sense of proprietorship, it may be different. Then perhaps we may
  meet again. I think it is even more the loss of our political work and dreams
  that I am feeling than the loss of your presence. Aching loss. I thought so
  much of the things we were DOING for the world&mdash;had given myself so
  unreservedly. You've left me with nothing to <i>do</i>. I am suddenly at
  loose ends...</p>

  <p>"We women are trained to be so dependent on a man. I've got no life of my
  own at all. It seems now to me that I wore my clothes even for you and your
  schemes...</p>

  <p>"After I have told myself a hundred times why this has happened, I ask
  again, 'Why did he give things up? Why did he give things up?'...</p>

  <p>"It is just as though you were wilfully dead...</p>

  <p>"Then I ask again and again whether this thing need have happened at all,
  whether if I had had a warning, if I had understood better, I might not have
  adapted myself to your restless mind and made this catastrophe
  impossible...</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear! why hadn't you the pluck to hurt me at the beginning, and
  tell me what you thought of me and life? You didn't give me a chance; not a
  chance. I suppose you couldn't. All these things you and I stood away from.
  You let my first repugnances repel you...</p>

  <p>"It is strange to think after all these years that I should be asking
  myself, do I love you? have I loved you? In a sense I think I <i>hate</i>
  you. I feel you have taken my life, dragged it in your wake for a time,
  thrown it aside. I am resentful. Unfairly resentful, for why should I exact
  that you should watch and understand my life, when clearly I have understood
  so little of yours. But I am savage&mdash;savage at the wrecking of all you
  were to do.</p>

  <p>"Oh, why&mdash;why did you give things up?</p>

  <p>"No human being is his own to do what he likes with. You were not only
  pledged to my tiresome, ineffectual companionship, but to great purposes.
  They <i>are</i> great purposes...</p>

  <p>"If only I could take up your work as you leave it, with the strength you
  had&mdash;then indeed I feel I could let you go&mdash;you and your young
  mistress... All that matters so little to me...</p>

  <p>"Yet I think I must indeed love you yourself in my slower way. At times I
  am mad with jealousy at the thought of all I hadn't the wit to give you...
  I've always hidden my tears from you&mdash;and what was in my heart. It's my
  nature to hide&mdash;and you, you want things brought to you to see. You are
  so curious as to be almost cruel. You don't understand reserves. You have no
  mercy with restraints and reservations. You are not really a <i>civilised</i>
  man at all. You hate pretences&mdash;and not only pretences but decent
  coverings...</p>

  <p>"It's only after one has lost love and the chance of loving that slow
  people like myself find what they might have done. Why wasn't I bold and
  reckless and abandoned? It's as reasonable to ask that, I suppose, as to ask
  why my hair is fair...</p>

  <p>"I go on with these perhapses over and over again here when I find myself
  alone...</p>

  <p>"My dear, my dear, you can't think of the desolation of things&mdash;I
  shall never go back to that house we furnished together, that was to have
  been the laboratory (do you remember calling it a laboratory?) in which you
  were to forge so much of the new order...</p>

  <p>"But, dear, if I can help you&mdash;even now&mdash;in any way&mdash;help
  both of you, I mean... It tears me when I think of you poor and discredited.
  You will let me help you if I can&mdash;it will be the last wrong not to let
  me do that...</p>

  <p>"You had better not get ill. If you do, and I hear of it&mdash;I shall
  come after you with a troupe of doctor's and nurses. If I am a failure as a
  wife, no one has ever said I was anything but a success as a district
  visitor..."</p>

  <p>There are other sheets, but I cannot tell whether they were written before
  or after the ones from which I have quoted. And most of them have little
  things too intimate to set down. But this oddly penetrating analysis of our
  differences must, I think, be given.</p>

  <p>"There are all sorts of things I can't express about this and want to.
  There's this difference that has always been between us, that you like
  nakedness and wildness, and I, clothing and restraint. It goes through
  everything. You are always <i>talking</i> of order and system, and the
  splendid dream of the order that might replace the muddled system you hate,
  but by a sort of instinct you seem to want to break the law. I've watched you
  so closely. Now I want to obey laws, to make sacrifices, to follow rules. I
  don't want to make, but I do want to keep. You are at once makers and rebels,
  you and Isabel too. You're bad people&mdash;criminal people, I feel, and yet
  full of something the world must have. You're so much better than me, and so
  much viler. It may be there is no making without destruction, but it seems to
  me sometimes that it is nothing but an instinct for lawlessness that drives
  you. You remind me&mdash;do you remember?&mdash;of that time we went from
  Naples to Vesuvius, and walked over the hot new lava there. Do you remember
  how tired I was? I know it disappointed you that I was tired. One walked
  there in spite of the heat because there was a crust; like custom, like law.
  But directly a crust forms on things, you are restless to break down to the
  fire again. You talk of beauty, both of you, as something terrible,
  mysterious, imperative. <i>Your</i> beauty is something altogether different
  from anything I know or feel. It has pain in it. Yet you always speak as
  though it was something I ought to feel and am dishonest not to feel.
  <i>My</i> beauty is a quiet thing. You have always laughed at my feeling for
  old-fashioned chintz and blue china and Sheraton. But I like all these
  familiar <i>used</i> things. My beauty is <i>still</i> beauty, and yours, is
  excitement. I know nothing of the fascination of the fire, or why one should
  go deliberately out of all the decent fine things of life to run dangers and
  be singed and tormented and destroyed. I don't understand..."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">I remember very freshly the mood of our departure from
  London, the platform of Charing Cross with the big illuminated clock
  overhead, the bustle of porters and passengers with luggage, the shouting of
  newsboys and boys with flowers and sweets, and the groups of friends seeing
  travellers off by the boat train. Isabel sat very quiet and still in the
  compartment, and I stood upon the platform with the door open, with a curious
  reluctance to take the last step that should sever me from London's ground. I
  showed our tickets, and bought a handful of red roses for her. At last came
  the guards crying: "Take your seats," and I got in and closed the door on me.
  We had, thank Heaven! a compartment to ourselves. I let down the window and
  stared out.</p>

  <p>There was a bustle of final adieux on the platform, a cry of "Stand away,
  please, stand away!" and the train was gliding slowly and smoothly out of the
  station.</p>

  <p>I looked out upon the river as the train rumbled with slowly gathering
  pace across the bridge, and the bobbing black heads of the pedestrians in the
  footway, and the curve of the river and the glowing great hotels, and the
  lights and reflections and blacknesses of that old, familiar spectacle. Then
  with a common thought, we turned our eyes westward to where the pinnacles of
  Westminster and the shining clock tower rose hard and clear against the
  still, luminous sky.</p>

  <p>"They'll be in Committee on the Reformatory Bill to-night," I said, a
  little stupidly.</p>

  <p>"And so," I added, "good-bye to London!"</p>

  <p>We said no more, but watched the south-side streets below&mdash;bright
  gleams of lights and movement, and the dark, dim, monstrous shapes of houses
  and factories. We ran through Waterloo Station, London Bridge, New Cross, St.
  John's. We said never a word. It seemed to me that for a time we had
  exhausted our emotions. We had escaped, we had cut our knot, we had accepted
  the last penalty of that headlong return of mine from Chicago a year and a
  half ago. That was all settled. That harvest of feelings we had reaped. I
  thought now only of London, of London as the symbol of all we were leaving
  and all we had lost in the world. I felt nothing now but an enormous and
  overwhelming regret...</p>

  <p>The train swayed and rattled on its way. We ran through old Bromstead,
  where once I had played with cities and armies on the nursery floor. The
  sprawling suburbs with their scattered lights gave way to dim tree-set
  country under a cloud-veiled, intermittently shining moon. We passed
  Cardcaster Place. Perhaps old Wardingham, that pillar of the old
  Conservatives, was there, fretting over his unsuccessful struggle with our
  young Toryism. Little he recked of this new turn of the wheel and how it
  would confirm his contempt of all our novelties. Perhaps some faint
  intimation drew him to the window to see behind the stems of the young fir
  trees that bordered his domain, the little string of lighted carriage windows
  gliding southward...</p>

  <p>Suddenly I began to realise just what it was we were doing.</p>

  <p>And now, indeed, I knew what London had been to me, London where I had
  been born and educated, the slovenly mother of my mind and all my ambitions,
  London and the empire! It seemed to me we must be going out to a world that
  was utterly empty. All our significance fell from us&mdash;and before us was
  no meaning any more. We were leaving London; my hand, which had gripped so
  hungrily upon its complex life, had been forced from it, my fingers left
  their hold. That was over. I should never have a voice in public affairs
  again. The inexorable unwritten law which forbids overt scandal sentenced me.
  We were going out to a new life, a life that appeared in that moment to be a
  mere shrivelled remnant of me, a mere residuum of sheltering and feeding and
  seeing amidst alien scenery and the sound of unfamiliar tongues. We were
  going to live cheaply in a foreign place, so cut off that I meet now the
  merest stray tourist, the commonest tweed-clad stranger with a mixture of
  shyness and hunger... And suddenly all the schemes I was leaving appeared
  fine and adventurous and hopeful as they had never done before. How great was
  this purpose I had relinquished, this bold and subtle remaking of the English
  will! I had doubted so many things, and now suddenly I doubted my
  unimportance, doubted my right to this suicidal abandonment. Was I not a
  trusted messenger, greatly trusted and favoured, who had turned aside by the
  way? Had I not, after all, stood for far more than I had thought; was I not
  filching from that dear great city of my birth and life, some vitally
  necessary thing, a key, a link, a reconciling clue in her political
  development, that now she might seek vaguely for in vain? What is one life
  against the State? Ought I not to have sacrificed Isabel and all my passion
  and sorrow for Isabel, and held to my thing&mdash;stuck to my thing?</p>

  <p>I heard as though he had spoken it in the carriage Britten's "It
  <i>was</i> a good game." No end of a game. And for the first time I imagined
  the faces and voices of Crupp and Esmeer and Gane when they learnt of this
  secret flight, this flight of which they were quite unwarned. And Shoesmith
  might be there in the house,&mdash;Shoesmith who was to have been married in
  four days&mdash;the thing might hit him full in front of any kind of people.
  Cruel eyes might watch him. Why the devil hadn't I written letters to warn
  them all? I could have posted them five minutes before the train started. I
  had never thought to that moment of the immense mess they would be in; how
  the whole edifice would clatter about their ears. I had a sudden desire to
  stop the train and go back for a day, for two days, to set that negligence
  right. My brain for a moment brightened, became animated and prolific of
  ideas. I thought of a brilliant line we might have taken on that confounded
  Reformatory Bill...</p>

  <p>That sort of thing was over...</p>

  <p>What indeed wasn't over? I passed to a vaguer, more multitudinous
  perception of disaster, the friends I had lost already since Altiora began
  her campaign, the ampler remnant whom now I must lose. I thought of people I
  had been merry with, people I had worked with and played with, the companions
  of talkative walks, the hostesses of houses that had once glowed with welcome
  for us both. I perceived we must lose them all. I saw life like a tree in
  late autumn that had once been rich and splendid with friends&mdash;and now
  the last brave dears would be hanging on doubtfully against the frosty chill
  of facts, twisting and tortured in the universal gale of indignation, trying
  to evade the cold blast of the truth. I had betrayed my party, my intimate
  friend, my wife, the wife whose devotion had made me what I was. For awhile
  the figure of Margaret, remote, wounded, shamed, dominated my mind, and the
  thought of my immense ingratitude. Damn them! they'd take it out of her too.
  I had a feeling that I wanted to go straight back and grip some one by the
  throat, some one talking ill of Margaret. They'd blame her for not keeping
  me, for letting things go so far... I wanted the whole world to know how fine
  she was. I saw in imagination the busy, excited dinner tables at work upon us
  all, rather pleasantly excited, brightly indignant, merciless.</p>

  <p>Well, it's the stuff we are!...</p>

  <p>Then suddenly, stabbing me to the heart, came a vision of Margaret's tears
  and the sound of her voice saying, "Husband mine! Oh! husband mine! To see
  you cry!"...</p>

  <p>I came out of a cloud of thoughts to discover the narrow compartment, with
  its feeble lamp overhead, and our rugs and hand-baggage swaying on the rack,
  and Isabel, very still in front of me, gripping my wilting red roses tightly
  in her bare and ringless hand.</p>

  <p>For a moment I could not understand her attitude, and then I perceived she
  was sitting bent together with her head averted from the light to hide the
  tears that were streaming down her face. She had not got her handkerchief out
  for fear that I should see this, but I saw her tears, dark drops of tears,
  upon her sleeve...</p>

  <p>I suppose she had been watching my expression, divining my thoughts.</p>

  <p>For a time I stared at her and was motionless, in a sort of still and
  weary amazement. Why had we done this injury to one another? <i>Why</i>? Then
  something stirred within me.</p>

  <p>"<i>Isabel</i>!" I whispered.</p>

  <p>She made no sign.</p>

  <p>"Isabel!" I repeated, and then crossed over to her and crept closely to
  her, put my arm about her, and drew her wet cheek to mine.</p>
