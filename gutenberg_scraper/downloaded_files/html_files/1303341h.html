<p>Production Notes:</p>
<p>The present reformatted title is occasioned by recently
receiving all the maps belonging to Volume I., not previously
available. It incorporates the following changes:<br>
* now as two separate volumes (like the original), each not so
bulky;<br>
* all maps are referred to in each volume and are available for
each volume;<br>
* better resolution maps may be had by clicking on the map in
this book to download;<br>
* searchable [text] indexes of persons, localities and subjects
(Volume 2);<br>
* numbers provided for pages beginning each chapter;<br>
* better resolution illustrations, each located close to the
subject;<br>
* improved readability by repositioning each footnote at the end
of the relevant paragraph.</p>
<p>[The last three illustrations have been moved to Volume II.,
where chapters on their subjects are found. Owing to their
abundance, the footnotes in Chapter XXXIII. have been moved to
the end of that chapter.]</p>
<p>Volume II. is available from <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/plusfifty-a-m.html#jack">Robert Logan Jack's listing</a> at Project Gutenberg

AUSTRALIA</p>
<br>
<h3><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>CHAPTER I</h3>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>T<small>HE</small> Cape York Peninsula, forming, as it does,
the link binding the two great islands of Australia and New
Guinea, is necessarily of the highest importance from a
geological, ethnological, zoological, botanical, historical,
political and strategical point of view.</p>
<p>It so happens that the Peninsula is the first part of
Australia to which authentic written history refers. On the
earliest landing of Europeans there arose the complex questions
which obtrude themselves whenever civilisation comes into contact
with barbarism.</p>
<p>My practical interest in the Peninsula began with a tour made
in 1879 in the course of my Geological Survey work. On my way to
the recently rushed and still more recently abandoned "Coen" gold
diggings, I crossed the base of the then almost unknown Cape
Melville Peninsula, where I found indications of auriferous
country, and also the rivers south of Princess Charlotte Bay,
down which the unfortunate explorer Kennedy had struggled in vain
to keep his appointment with the relief ship twenty-two years
earlier. From the Coen, I was only able to push out to the north
for a period inexorably limited by the condition of my horses and
the quantity of food remaining in my saddle-bags. Even under
these conditions, however, I penetrated for some distance into
the McIlwraith Range, and on the heads of the river which I named
the Peach (unaware that it was the river named the Archer by the
Brothers Jardine, who crossed it near its mouth) I found
widespread evidence of the presence of gold and tin.</p>
<p>From the Laura Telegraph Office, from Cooktown, and ultimately
from my headquarters at Townsville, I made such communications as
were possible in anticipation of a complete report to the head of
the Department of Mines, which administered the Geological
Survey.</p>
<p>My individual impression was that the reefs in the district
traversed were of more importance than the alluvial gold, but
there had been neither means nor time at my disposal to enable me
to satisfy myself of the value of either, and this view I duly
represented in my correspondence with the Department.</p>
<p>The desire of the Government, and of the eager diggers
throughout Queensland, was to discover an alluvial goldfield on
the pattern of the Palmer, which was by that time approaching
exhaustion.</p>
<p>A party of miners, headed by James Crosbie, volunteered to go
and settle the question of the existence of payable alluvial
gold, and they asked for and obtained government assistance, and
I was instructed to lead them to the spot. In addition, a
prospecting party was equipped, with money subscribed in
Cook-town, and sent out to anticipate the expedition subsidised
by the Government.</p>
<p>The combined geological and prospecting parties left Cooktown
on 26th November, 1879, and striking out from the "bend of the
Kennedy" on the Cooktown-Palmerville road, reached the "Peach"
(Archer) River on 20th December. The prospectors commenced
operations at once, and were rewarded with "prospects" which led
them into the jungle-clad recesses of the McIlwraith Range. Here,
to their disappointment, although prospects were obtained here
and there, the creeks and gullies were found to run over almost
bare rocks, their beds being too steep for the retention of any
quantity of alluvial "washdirt." On 30th December, the wet season
set in. For the remainder of our time in the field, the creeks
were too swollen for the "bottom" to be reached where there was
any washdirt at all, or the ground was too sodden to carry our
horses. There were long and vexatious delays when it was neither
possible to work nor to travel. Nevertheless, we continued,
during breaks in the bad weather, to cross the McIlwraith Range
and touch the Macrossan Range. Regaining the summit of the
McIlwraith Range, we followed it to its northern extremity, where
the valley of the Pascoe River separates it from the mountain
mass which we named the Janet Range. It was found that the Pascoe
River bounds the Janet Range on the south and east, and we
practically followed it down till we had finally to cross it
where it took an easterly course towards the Pacific. We had
already made up our minds that it was safer to chance the unknown
in the north than to return to Cooktown across several great
rivers, now all certain to be flooded. No sooner had we left the
Pascoe than we entered on the Bad Lands or Wet Desert of "heath"
and "scrub" without anything for horses to live on. From the
Pascoe to the Escape River, our course must have coincided in
many places with Kennedy's on his "forlorn hope" journey, and we
repeated many of his experiences, as told by his surviving
companion Jackey-Jackey, but happily not the series of disasters
which resulted in his own death and the disasters which overtook
the two parties he left behind to await the relief he went to
bring. The natives displayed in our case, as in Kennedy's, a
persistent hostility which hampered our movements and partially
incapacitated me during the final stages of the journey. Horses
died of starvation or poison, and the men of the party were
running perilously short of food&mdash;the journey having been
prolonged beyond our calculations&mdash;when we reached Somerset
on 3rd April, 1880.</p>
<p>Kennedy's maps and journals (1848) perished with him, and what
we know of his expedition is taken (as far north as the Pascoe
River) from the narrative written by William Carron, one of the
three survivors, and (north of the Pascoe) from the "statement"
of the black boy Jackey-Jackey, another of the survivors and the
only one of the thirteen men to make the complete journey from
Rockingham Bay to Somerset. The Geological and Prospecting
Party's <i>route</i> only coincided for a short distance, from
the head of the Jardine River to its westward bend, with that of
the Jardine Brothers (1865). Day after day, during the whole of
my journey, I was mapping the mountain ranges, rivers and other
features of the country, checking my latitudes by
star-observations whenever the night sky was clear enough, and as
far as charting was concerned we were in virgin ground.</p>
<p>My report on the two expeditions was completed at my
Townsville office in the winter of 1880 and sent to the Minister
for Mines, Brisbane, with the relative map, which had taken a
good deal of time, subject to interruptions by other duties. The
report was printed and officially issued on 14th September, 1881,
without my having had any opportunity of seeing it through the
press, and to my astonishment the map&mdash;which might have been
supposed to be of the first importance&mdash;was omitted. What
became of the map and of my office copy will be seen in Chapter
LXVII.</p>
<p>After the map had reached Brisbane and before my report was
published, my map had been reduced to a smaller scale and
embodied in official maps issued by the Department of Lands. In
that form, however, my charting was open, in parts, to an
interpretation which I could never have sanctioned.</p>
<p>In 1913, when I had been out of the government service for
about fourteen years, and when for the first time some degree of
leisure had begun to fall to my share, I commenced to prepare a
revised and corrected issue of the report, with its map
reconstructed from my notes, with the intention of offering it to
the Government for republication (the report itself having been
long out of print). Some progress had been made when my friend
James Dick, of Cooktown, sent me proofs of a pamphlet in which he
proposed to summarise the narrative of the Geological and
Prospecting Expeditions. When I had gone over the proofs,
correcting them only in so far as statements of fact were
concerned, I fully realised how misleading my original narrative
must have been, misprinted as it was, and unaccompanied by the
map which formed its most essential part. I resumed my task with
renewed vigour, and with a wider scope, and Mr. Dick, up to the
date of his death, assisted me in many ways through his local and
personal knowledge, happily of more recent date than mine. I am
grateful to his memory, and am conscious that he was, in a sense,
"the only begetter of these ensuing lines."</p>
<p>Between 1880 and 1913, a great deal of charting of the
interior had been accomplished by the Departments of Lands and
Mines, although even now that work is incomplete. The new lines
gave me, when I was recharting the lost map, an opportunity of
correcting my sketching to correspond with actual surveys.</p>
<p>The first lesson to force itself upon me was that my estimates
of distances covered had been influenced by fatigue or
difficulties on the one hand (leading to over-estimation) or by
good-going and good-feeding for the horses on the other (leading
to underestimation).</p>
<p>The second lesson was that, even in the direction of my
course, I had in many instances strayed to the right or left, as
a ship may steer a definite course and yet make leeway owing to
the pressure of forces incorrectly estimated, or even not
recognised. In short, the personal equation had to be introduced
and allowed for before I could hope to reconcile my supposed with
my actual position on any given date.</p>
<p>Long before I had finished the revision of my own narrative,
it had become evident that its significance could not be fully
understood without a critical study of the diaries of explorers
who had gone before me and whose paths I had crossed from time to
time. This led me back from Mulligan to Leichhardt, and as one by
one the writings of honoured pioneers came under my review, I
subjected them to the tests already applied to my own, and to the
best of my ability substituted where the writers were for where
they thought they were, and made the necessary allowances and
corrections. Then it seemed that the story might as well be
continued to the present date by the addition of the developments
which have taken place since 1880 through the instrumentality of
surveyors, explorers and prospectors. Some of the actors are,
happily, still alive, and these have rendered material assistance
by the contribution of original matter. Among these are Webb,
Bradford, Paterson and Embley. To the last-named gentleman,
especially, I am indebted for assistance rendered doubly valuable
by his prolonged residence in the Peninsula, and which, in some
parts of the work, almost amounted to collaboration.</p>
<p>While dealing with land explorers it was borne in upon me that
they owed some of their difficulties and many of their errors to
an imperfect comprehension of the work of earlier maritime
explorers. They were not, indeed, to be blamed for this, as in
few instances could they have perused the narratives or seen the
charts of the sea-adventurers. As it was, the Dutch sailors named
"reviers," or inlets, on the Gulf coast, and subsequent explorers
of the interior, almost without exception, made bad guesses at
the connection of their rivers with the inlets on the coast line.
I do not propose any reform so drastic as to restore their
original names to the western rivers of the Peninsula, but
content myself, after years of research, with distinguishing the
original, or right, or <i>de jure</i> names from the <i>de
facto</i> names, the product of pardonable misidentifications
sanctioned, in many cases, by half a century of popular and
official usage. I have, I hope, succeeded in making it clear
that, in many instances, the <i>de facto</i> names are in reality
not those bestowed by the earliest explorers, but rather what are
called "complimentary" names.</p>
<p>From the preceding explanation, it will be understood that
this work began, so to speak, in the middle, and followed lines
dictated by the questions which arose during its progress. It was
ultimately realised that it would be advisable to arrange it in
chronological order, so that the tale told by each explorer might
be compared with the facts ascertained by his predecessors and at
the same time be complete in itself. Of no less importance was
the consideration of precisely how much knowledge each explorer
had of the achievements of his predecessors; and this point has
exacted very careful study. I am forced to the conclusion that in
most instances the later explorers knew very little about their
predecessors, having taken what little they knew at second hand
and without having had access to important documents, some of
which, indeed, only came to light after their own time.</p>
<p>While aiming at chronological order, it must be conceded that
it is not always possible to observe it strictly. It may be that
the stories of two observers overlap; or a statement may demand
historical investigation into the past; or, again, it may be
convenient at once to trace the outcome of a newly discovered
fact downwards to the present time. Hence a certain amount of
repetition is inevitable, as facts or statements are viewed by
one observer after another from a different angle.</p>
<p>It is impossible to define the exact base of the Cape York
Peninsula, and in writing of it one must occasionally follow its
pioneers beyond its southern boundary, however liberal or elastic
the definition of the latter may be. The historian of France
needs no excuse for referring to happenings in Germany or Italy.
In a parallel way, what was commenced as a history of the Cape
York Peninsula has come to include Torres Strait, the "Gulf"
country west to the boundary of Queensland and the Pacific
country as far south as Bowen.</p>

<p>A <small>MASS</small> of vague and fragmentary evidence points
to the conclusion that by the middle of the sixteenth century
Spanish and Portuguese navigators had become aware that New
Guinea was separated by a strait from a continent lying to the
south. The knowledge was, however, jealously guarded. A
significant passage occurs in an English edition, published in
Louvain in 1597, of <span class="a">Cornelis Wytfliet's</span>
<i>Descriptionis Ptolemic&aelig; Augmentum</i> (1597):</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The Australis Terra is the most
southern of all lands. It is separated from New Guinea by a
narrow strait. Its shores are hitherto but little known, since,
after one voyage and another, that <i>route</i> has been
deserted, and seldom is the country visited, unless when sailors
are driven there by storms. The Australis Terra begins at two or
three degrees from the equator, and is maintained by some to be
of so great an extent that, if it were thoroughly explored, it
would be regarded as a fifth part of the world." <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) Collingridge, <i>Discovery of Australia</i>, p.
219.]</blockquote>
<p>The inference, as pointed out by Collingridge, is inevitable
that Wytfliet referred to sources of information other than
Dutch.</p>
<p>Collingridge adduces <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b>
reasonable support for his contention that the western coast of
Australia had been "charted". (although the word "sketched" might
be more appropriate) by the Portuguese and the eastern coast by
the Spanish prior to the year 1530. In the <span class=
"a">Dauphin Chart</span>, on which this conjecture is founded,
the point identified as Cape York is, however, not depicted, as
it really is, south of New Guinea, but as lying west of Timor and
in the latitude of the north coast of Java. The supposed Gulf of
Carpentaria has for its western limit the eastern end of Java,
and from its south-western corner what may be called a strait or
channel, or still more correctly a canal, runs westward between
"Jave" on the north and "Jave la Grande," or Australia, on the
south. The supposed Gulf of Carpentaria is, according to the map,
interrupted by a few islands, and on it is written, in the
Portuguese language, the legend "Anda ne Barcha" (no ships come
here). <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> Collingridge conjectures
that the French compiler of the map, ignorant of Portuguese,
copied this legend from an older Portuguese map, under the
impression that it was the name of the Gulf or of the group of
islands.</p>
<blockquote>[2) British Association for the Advancement of
Science: Sydney meeting, 1914. See also his work, <i>The
Discovery of Australia</i>, Sydney, 1895, p. 172, where the
"Dauphin Chart," dated 1530-1536, is reproduced.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[3) The equivalent of the phrase in modern Spanish,
<i>viz.</i> "Barcas no andan," differs so little from the
Portuguese that some hesitation may be felt in settling the
question on the sole evidence of language. Blank ignorance of
Portuguese on the part of a French cartographer is rather a bold
assumption. The most genuinely learned men of these days were to
be found among the compilers of maps.]</blockquote>
<p>In the sixteenth century, the islands between Asia and
Australia came to be well known to European adventurers. In 1512,
Portugal took possession of the Molucca group, the centre of the
"Spice Islands," and this possession speedily grew to great
commercial importance and passed into the hands of Spain.
Magelhaen "discovered" the Philippines in 1520 and Spain annexed
them fifty years later. Meantime the Dutch and the English were
on the alert and looking for a foothold.</p>
<p>As far back as July, 1493, a <span class="a">bull of Pope
Alexander</span> VI had fixed a north and south line of
demarcation between the claims of Portugal and Spain to future
discoveries. Portugal was to occupy the hemisphere to the east
and Spain the hemisphere to the west of that line, which was
placed 100 leagues (5&deg; 43') <b style="color:#603000">[4]</b>
west of the Azores and Cape Verde Islands. The generosity of the
Pope was no doubt fully appreciated by the two beneficiaries, but
the line was not quite satisfactory to either of them; besides,
it was ill-defined, because some six degrees of longitude extend
between the westmost Azores and the eastmost Cape Verdes. A
private arrangement or treaty was therefore made on 4th June,
1494, by Don Juan II of Portugal on the one hand and Isabella and
Ferdinand of Spain on the other, whereby it was agreed that the
line should run 370 leagues (21&deg; 9') west of the Cape Verde
Islands.</p>
<blockquote>[4) 17&frac12; Spanish leagues= 1 geographical
degree.]</blockquote>
<p>Assuming 25&deg; W. to be the mean longitude of the Azores and
Cape Verde Islands, the bull of 1493 bisected the globe by the
meridians of 40&deg; 43' W. and 149&deg; 17' E., the latter
meridian giving to Portugal the islands of the Pacific west of
the eastmost cape of New Guinea and to Spain all those east of
that cape. The treaty of 1494 cut through the globe by the
meridians of 46&deg; 9' W. and 133&deg; 51' E.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that <span class="a">Columbus</span> had
just discovered the West Indian Islands a year before the issue
of the papal bull. The mainland of America was discovered in 1497
by <span class="a">Sebastian Cabot</span>, a Venetian in the
service of Henry VII of England. Then the passage of the
<span class="a">Spanish main</span>, the sphere of influence
granted to Spain, became, for Europe, a question of very
practical politics, over which much blood was to be shed, as
other nations claimed the freedom of the sea. It was not till
1588 that the question was settled by the decisive defeat of the
Spanish armada by the English fleet.</p>
<p>Had the nations outside of Spain and Portugal admitted the
validity of the bull, the greater part of Australia would have
belonged to Portugal, and a slice of the eastern coast, covering
Sydney, Brisbane and Rockhampton, would have been Spanish. By the
treaty (which was a sort of reciprocal Monroe doctrine), the
western half of Australia would have been Portuguese and the
eastern half Spanish.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that no other maritime powers ever
assented to the partition between Spain and Portugal of all lands
to be discovered in the future. The title of the two Powers was
soon to be disputed by the rising maritime nations England and
Holland. Moreover, the definition of the treaty line in the
Pacific raised, between Spain and Portugal themselves, questions
which brought them to the verge of war.</p>
<p>Here, then, was an excellent reason why Spaniards and
Portuguese should preserve secrecy or practise deceit regarding
the location of discoveries in the vicinity of the boundary line,
whether by bull or treaty. The interest of a Portuguese tempted
him, sometimes beyond his strength, to place his discovery west,
while a Spaniard was tempted to place his discovery east of the
boundary line in the Pacific. Secret instructions must have been
issued to navigators by the authorities of both countries, in
consequence of which they would systematically misrepresent their
longitudes, and the truth would be arrived at by the authorities
on reading the reports and charts with the aid of a "key."</p>
<p>Granting that the "Dauphin Chart" was compiled in parts from
Spanish or Portuguese originals and that the land shown to the
south of Java really represents the northern portion of
Australia, which was already, early in the sixteenth century,
vaguely known to both Spanish and Portuguese, the westward-moving
of the new continent was clearly in the interest of Portugal, and
the warning or danger signal "ships do not (or cannot or must
not) come here"&mdash;in other words, "not navigable"&mdash;was
clearly a "bluff." It was, therefore, probably a Portuguese map
which was drawn upon for the information given in the Dauphin
chart.</p>
<h4>MAGELHAEN AND CANO</h4>
<p><span class="a">Magelhaen</span>, a Portuguese who had taken
service with Spain, set out with five vessels from Luzar on 10th
September, 1519. After passing through the strait which now bears
his name, he reached the Philippine Islands, where he was killed
by the natives. Only one ship of his squadron returned to Europe,
<i>via</i> the Cape of Good Hope, carrying eighteen persons, all
very sick. This ship was the "<i>Victoria</i>," Captain Juan
Sebastian del <span class="a">Cano</span>. The "<i>Victoria</i>"
sailed <i>via</i> the Moluccas to Timor. Thence she must have
gone south-westward till "certain islands" were discovered under
the tropic of Capricorn. As this land, according to Cano, was
only 100 leagues (5&deg; 43') from Timor, it is more likely to
have been the continent of Australia (somewhere between Onslow
and Carnarvon, Western Australia) than Madagascar, as has been
assumed by some writers. Whether Cano actually landed here is
uncertain, but it may be taken for granted that in these days no
ship could afford to neglect an opportunity of landing for the
purpose of taking in water.</p>
<h4>TORRES</h4>
<p>A Spanish expedition under <span class="a">Alvaro Mendana de
Meyra</span>, with <span class="a">Pedro Fernandez de
Quiros</span> as second in command, sailed from Callao on 9th
April, 1595, and discovered the island of <span class="a">Santa
Cruz</span> (lat. 11&deg; S., long. 166&deg; E.), where an
attempt was made to establish a colony. The result was a
disastrous failure, and Mendana's death took place soon after.
<span class="a">Wytfliet's map</span> (1597 <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b>) shows, in the same latitude as the
southmost Solomon Islands (10&deg; S.), a strait dividing Nova
Guinea and Terra Australis, and this is actually the latitude of
Torres Strait. The map has a note stating that <span class=
"a">Terra Australis</span> is "<span class="a">separated from New
Guinea</span> by a narrow strait. Its shores are hitherto but
little known, since, after one voyage and another, that
<i>route</i> has been deserted, and seldom is the country visited
unless when sailors are driven there by storms." In this harmless
statement, there is surely no ground for Collingridge's
accusation of fraud on the part of the Dutch, or of a desire to
filch the credit of the discovery of the strait. Collingridge
adduces a good many fragments of evidence that both the Spanish
and the Dutch were well aware of the existence of the strait
before the end of the sixteenth century, but after Wytfliet's
admission there was a growing tendency on the part of the Dutch
to deny the existence of such a strait, and several failures on
their part to verify it only strengthened this doubt. They
doubted more and more until the question was finally settled by
Cook in 1770.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>The Discovery of Australia</i>, by George
Collingridge, 4to, Sydney, 1895, p. 218.]</blockquote>
<p>That the strait was known to Spaniards early in the
seventeenth century is proved by a remarkable document, dating
from somewhere between 1614 and 1621. This is a <span class=
"a">Memorial</span> which <span class="a">Dr. Jean Luis
Arias</span>, a lawyer in Chili, writing on behalf of a number of
priests, addressed to King Philip III, urging more vigorous
exploration, on humanitarian and religious grounds. <span class=
"a">New Guinea</span> is referred to in it as "a Country
<span class="a">encompassed with water</span>."</p>
<p><span class="a">Quiros</span>, who persisted for years in
urging the colonisation of Santa Cruz and the further exploration
of the South Land, was at last given the command of an
expedition, which left <span class="a">Callao</span>, Peru, on
21st December, 1605. He hoisted his flag on the "<i>San Pedro y
San Pablo</i>" (usually referred to in narratives as "<i>El
Capitano</i>," or the Flagship), with, as his Captain or Chief
Pilot, <span class="a">Juan Ochao de Bilbaho</span>. This officer
was not a man of his own choice, but was forced upon him by the
Viceroy at Lima, whose relative and <i>proteg&eacute;</i> he was.
In the course of the voyage he was disrated and replaced by the
Junior Pilot <span class="a">Gaspar Gonzalez de Leza.
Torres</span> commanded the "<i>San Pedro</i>" (usually called,
"for short," the "<i>Almirante</i>," or Lieutenant's ship). A
zabra, or tender, named the "<i>Tres Reyes</i>," was in charge of
<span class="a">Pedro Bernal Cerme&ntilde;o</span>.</p>
<p>The flagship parted company with her consorts at the island of
Espiritu Santo, and thereafter the two fragments of the
expedition pursued separate courses. It is only with the section
commanded by <span class="a">Torres</span> that the historian of
the Cape York Peninsula is directly concerned, but the full
significance of Torres' voyage cannot be correctly estimated
without some consideration of the events which preceded the
separation.</p>
<p>Quiros and Torres were among the last of Spain's navigators of
the first order: by the time their expedition set out, Spain's
influence in the Pacific was on the wane. The records of their
experiences met with the usual fate of such documents. In
accordance with what had become almost a matter of routine, they
were at first jealously kept secret. Pigeon-holed, they were in
due time forgotten, only to be unearthed, piece by piece, through
the diligence of patriots, politicians and historians. In
reviewing the progress of discovery subsequent to Quiros and
Torres, it is necessary to remind ourselves that at any given
date the information available was limited to such documents as
had come to light, and the problems confronting new explorers
were not at all those which would have been before them had they
been fully aware of what had already been done. It may be
confidently asserted that had the various reports of Quiros and
Torres been given to the world in their true chronological order,
the course of history would have differed widely from what it has
been. Up to comparatively recent times the achievements of Quiros
were only known at second hand, and chiefly through the meagre
references by Torres, Arias and Torquemada. It was only in 1876
that the text of <span class="a">Quiros' Voyage</span> was given
to the world by <span class="a">Justo Zaragoza</span>, whereupon
clouds of tradition and misconception were dispelled. Practically
the whole of the Quiros documents have been skilfully marshalled
by the late <span class="a">Sir Clements Markham</span> for the
Hakluyt Society in the two volumes published in 1904. The chief
items in the QuirosTorres bibliography are enumerated in the

<p>On leaving Callao, the expedition steered WSW. into 26&deg;

and if no land has yet been found, a course will be followed on
that parallel to the west in search of the Island of Santa Cruz.
There a port will be sought in the bay of Graciosa, in 10&deg; of
latitude and 1,850 leagues from the city of The Kings [Lima] to
the South of a great and lofty volcano standing alone in the sea,
about 8 leagues from the said bay. The Captain who arrives first
in this Port, which is at the head of the Bay, between a spring
of water and a moderate-sized river, with bottom from 40 to 35
fathoms, is to anchor there and wait there three months for the
other two ships. When together, a resolution will be taken as to
what further shall be done, in compliance with His Majesty's
orders. If by chance the other ships do not arrive, the Captain
before he departs, is to raise a Cross, and at the foot of it, or
of the nearest tree, he is to make a sign on the trunk to be
understood by him who next arrives, and to bury a jar with the
mouth closed with tar, and containing a narrative of all that has
happened and of his intentions. Then he will steer SW. as far as
20&deg;, thence NW. to 4&deg;, and on that parallel he is to
steer West in search of New Guinea. After coasting all along that
land, he is to proceed to the Country of Manila, by the Island of
Luzon of the Philippines, in 14&deg; North, thence by the Eastern
Indies to Spain."</blockquote>
<p>Much confusion has arisen, and much speculation has been
indulged in, owing to a doubt as to the correct interpretation of
references by Torres to the "prescribed latitude." The general
and very natural impression has hitherto been that Quiros was
under orders not to turn north until he had reached a certain
southern latitude, the precise situation of which he and Torres
were ordered to keep secret.</p>
<p>The narrative of Bermudez (as the mouthpiece of Quiros), only
recently given to the world, proves conclusively that there was
no mystery and no intentional concealment. Quiros, as a matter of
fact, received no orders from Spain, and the valedictory epistle
of the Governor of Peru did not restrict his discretionary
powers.</p>
<p>The expedition was manned by 130 seafarers and six priests.
The flagship and the "<i>Almirante</i>" were vessels of 150 and
120 tons respectively.</p>
<p><span class="a">Quiros</span> had barely gone to sea when he
began to be ill, and he was more or less of an invalid during the
whole of the voyage. From the occasional references to headaches
and other symptoms, a layman would conjecture that he had got a
"touch of the sun" at Lima. At all events, he was frequently too
ill to take his proper place of command and was under the
necessity of leaving to subordinates many decisions which were
among his own obvious duties. The narrative (written, it must be
remembered, by a faithful admirer) na&iuml;vely shows him to have
been by turn querulous, weak, timid and vacillating, although
ever honestly and even zealously solicitous for the glory of his
God and the advantage of his King. His sentiments, as reported by
Bermudez, were humane, honourable and far ahead of his time, and
I do not think they were cant, such as flowed readily enough from
the pens of some previous and contemporary navigators. His
shortcomings may charitably, and I think justly, be set down as
symptoms of his malady.</p>
<p>The too early abandonment of the initial WSW. course was
unfortunate for Quiros, who, had he persevered, would probably
have anticipated Tasman's discovery of New Zealand. Torres
protested against it and endeavoured to induce Quiros to carry
out his original intention of touching 30&deg; S. before
"diminishing his latitude," but to no purpose.</p>
<p>There is reason to believe that Quiros was influenced in his
decision to steer WNW. no less by the insubordinate, if not
mutinous, conduct of a section of his crew than by the lateness
of the season. Probably enough, with a commander of greater
firmness, the ugly word "mutiny" would never have been heard.</p>
<p>Having reached, approximately, the latitude of 10&deg; S., the
expedition steered west for <span class="a">Vera Cruz</span>,
driven by the imperative need for fresh water and firewood. These
requisites, however, were obtained at an island named
<span class="a">Toumaco</span>, and the project of making for
Vera Cruz was abandoned.</p>
<p>By this time, the <span class="a">insubordination</span> on
the flagship had to be dealt with. The ringleader was the Chief
Pilot, or Captain, <span class="a">Juan Ochoa De Bilbaho</span>,
for whom Quiros considered that a sufficient punishment was to be
relieved of his office and sent on board the
"<i>Almirante</i>"&mdash;a proceeding which was perhaps a little
hard on Torres. Ochoa was replaced by <span class="a">Gaspar
Gonzalez de Leza</span>, Junior Pilot.</p>
<p>A bitterly spiteful enemy of Quiros, and necessarily a
supporter of the disrated Captain, was <span class="a">Diego de
Prado y Tobar</span>, who, according to his own account,
voluntarily accompanied Ochoa and boarded the "<i>Almirante</i>"
at Toumaco. In allowing an officer of the flagship t0 desert
openly and to side with a degraded malcontent, it seems to me
that Quiros displayed a weakness which was most reprehensible,
unless it was to be pardoned as a "symptom" of his illness. Be
this as it may, we owe to the desertion of Prado, as will
afterwards appear, a much fuller knowledge of Torres' subsequent
proceedings than we should have had if Prado had not accompanied
Torres for the remainder of the expedition. In the letters
already referred to, Prado states that: "I went as Captain of the
ship '<i>Capitano</i>', knew what took place on board and took
part in it, and as it was not in conformity with the good of Your
Majesty's Service, I could not stay. So I disembarked at Toumaco
and went to the <i>Almirante</i>,' where I was well received."
The assertion that he was Captain is sheer impudence, as there
can be no question that the Captain was Ochoa. Prado was perhaps
a mate" of some sort, and the sailing of the ship may at some
time have temporarily devolved upon him in the course of duty,
but beyond this there was never any justification for his claim.
His version of the story is that he gave Quiros timely warning of
the mutinous disposition of the "<i>Capitano's</i>" officers and
crew, and he insinuates that Quiros either did not believe him or
stood so much in fear of the malcontents that he made things so
unpleasant that he (Prado) was glad to exchange into the
"<i>Almirante</i>."</p>
<p>At Toumaco, the natives were understood to say that large
lands (which, of course, might prove to be the desired South
Land) lay to the south, and the course was changed accordingly.
In latitude 15&deg; 40' S. and longitude 176&deg; E., the
promised land seemed to have been reached at last, on 30th April,
1606. Good harbourage was afforded by the <span class="a">Gran
Baya de San Felipe y Santiago</span> (Saints Philip and James),
otherwise the Port of <span class="a">Vera Cruz</span> (True
Cross), thus going one better than Mendano with his Santa Cruz
(Holy Cross). On the banks of the <span class="a">Jordan
River</span>, at the head of the bay, the site for the great
colonial city, the <span class="a">New Jerusalem</span> was
selected. The country was at first called the Land of
<span class="a">Espiritu Santo</span> (Holy Ghost), but as Quiros
became convinced that it was part of the great Southern
Continent, he expanded the title to <span class="a">Australia del
Espiritu Santo</span>, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and took
formal possession, in the name of his Sovereign, of "all lands
then seen, and still to be seen, as far as the South Pole." The
grandiose names bestowed illustrate not only the innate piety but
also the weakness for superlatives which characterised the
Spaniard of the seventeenth century.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Markham supports the view that the name should
read&mdash;as it sometimes does, spelling in the seventeenth
century being capricious&mdash;Austrialia, a claim to Austria
being signified in one of the titles of the King of
Spain.]</blockquote>
<p>It has been argued (<i>e.g</i>., by the late Cardinal Moran)
that Quiros, with three ships under his command, could not have
spent five weeks at the Island of Santo without discovering that
it was no part of a continent. The fact remains that he did
believe it to be continental, although from the first Torres did
not agree with him. Quiros approached the island predisposed to
believe as he did. The elaborate ceremony which marked his stay,
including the nomination of municipal officers, the erection of a
votive church and the inauguration of an order of Knighthood of
the Holy Ghost, sufficiently attested the sincerity of his
belief. The ceremonies and the hopes to which they testified
were, indeed, as Sir Clements Markham observed, in the light of
our present knowledge, not a little pathetic.</p>
<p>In after years the conviction obsessed him, till he besought
his King and the world to believe that he had added to the
Spanish Crown a territory of hardly less importance than that
gained by the discoveries of Columbus. He died, broken-hearted,
shouting this belief into deaf ears.</p>
<p>The argument that Quiros had time enough to ascertain that
Santo was an island is sufficiently answered by the fact now
clearly discernible from the narrative of Bermudez, that the
exploration which took place during the five weeks was confined
to the "Gran Baya" and its environs, and that Quiros, in the
flagship, was never outside of the bay until the day when he
finally departed from it, to be driven out of sight of land and
separated from his two consorts. Unexpected confirmation of this
fact is supplied by the <span class="a">chart of the Gran
Baya</span> (brought to light as recently as 1878) signed by
<span class="a">Prado</span>, which shows so many anchorages
inside the bay that it may easily be believed they account for as
many of the thirty-five days as were not spent ashore. The chart,
whether the credit of the surveying or only of the
draughtsmanship belongs to Prado, agrees so well with modern
Admiralty Charts of that portion of the island, that there can be
no question of the accuracy of Captain Cook's
identification&mdash;made, of course, without the assistance of
Prado's Chart, which, in 1770, lay unknown in the Spanish
archives.</p>
<p>Sir Clements Markham, for many years President of the Royal
Geographical Society, had no difficulty in admitting the honesty
of Quiros' belief that he had discovered the southern land, and
wrote of his approach to the Island of Espiritu Santo:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Island after island, all lofty and
thickly inhabited, rose upon the horizon, and at last he sighted
such extensive coast-lines that he believed the Southern
Continent to be spread out before him. The islands of the New
Hebrides Group, such as Aurora, Leper, and Pentecost, overlapping
each other to the south-east, seemed to him to be continuous
coast-lines, while to the south-west was the land which he named
Austrialia del Espiritu Santo. All appeared to his vivid
imagination to be one continuous continental land."</blockquote>
<p>The expedition, as has been mentioned, remained in the Bay of
Saints Philip and James for thirty-five days, <i>viz.</i>, from
3rd May to 8th June, 1606, the numerous anchorages laid down on
Prado's chart showing how thoroughly the shores must have been
examined. The sailors made themselves very much at home and
behaved with such arrogance, cruelty and rapacity that the
natives treated them with well-merited hostility, and although
Quiros "deplored" such excesses, he seems to have taken no
suitable steps to stop them, beyond formally prohibiting profane
swearing and other unseemly practices. It is noteworthy that the
outrageous conduct of Prado was so far condoned that he figured
in the list of officers of the municipality of the New Jerusalem
as Depositario General. This term is translated by Markham as
"General Storekeeper," but in my opinion, the fact that Prado
carried off with him, among other things, the manuscript, or at
least a copy, of the new chart of the bay and its environs,
favours the view that the office held by him was the more
responsible one of receiver or recorder.</p>
<p>The three vessels left the bay on 8th June, presumably with
the intention of coasting along the continent to the north-west,
or, should Espiritu Santo prove to be a cape, of running
south-west to 20&deg; S. north-west to 4&deg;, and west on that
parallel to the coast of New Guinea, given an open sea, in
accordance with the spirit of the instructions given to Torres
for his guidance in the event of a separation. As soon, however,
as they cleared the cape which formed the north-western horn of
the bay, they met with a strong wind from the south-east and
endeavoured to get back into the bay for shelter. In this attempt
the "<i>Almirante</i>" and the <i>tender</i> succeeded, but the
<span class="a">flagship</span> was blown further and further to
leeward and in the morning succeeding the first night was out of
sight of land and hopelessly <span class="a">separated from her
consorts</span>. Quiros himself was "below," too ill to direct
the conduct of his vessel. Prado asserts, indeed, that Quiros was
a prisoner in the hands of mutineers, but as he was not on board
and could only have obtained his information at second hand, and,
moreover, was prejudiced and malicious, the statement may be
disregarded. Quiros himself, as he complained, had enemies on
board, discontented and sulky, but there can be no doubt of the
loyalty and devotion of his new Captain, de Leza, and his
Secretary, Bermudez, who, perhaps jointly, conducted affairs
during Quiros' incapacity.</p>
<p>The "<i>Capitano</i>," having reached 10&deg; S., the latitude
of Santa Cruz, without seeing the island, being probably between
it and the Solomon Group, it was resolved on 18th June to make
for Acapulca. unless some friendly port should first be
discovered suitable for refitting and repairing the ship. On a
NE. by N. course the line was crossed on 2nd July. The course was
shortly altered to NE., and lay, in all probability, between the
Marshall and Gilbert Islands. Having reached 38&deg; N. latitude,
the vessel steered ESE. until North American land was sighted in
34&deg; on 23rd September. The Mexican coast was then followed to
the SE. and Acapulca was reached on 23rd November, 1606. Only one
death occurred during the voyage, that of an old priest. Quiros,
who landed without resources, was coldly received. He, however,
managed to reach Madrid on 9th October, 1607. The remainder of
his life was spent in making passionate appeals to the King for
the means to prosecute his discoveries and develop the imaginary
continent in the interests of Spain. Wearied by his
importunities, the Government got him out of the way by giving
him an open letter to the Governor at Panama, who was instructed
to assist him to his object, at the same time sending another
letter in which the Governor was secretly instructed to string
him on and delay him <i>ad infinitum</i>. Fortunately for
himself, he died on the voyage to Panama (1609-1610) unaware of
the treachery of which he was to be the victim. He was only fifty
years of age, but was, says Markham, "worn out and driven to his
grave by Councils and Committees with their futile talk, needless
delays and endless obstructions."</p>
<p>The flagship having disappeared, <span class="a">Torres</span>
waited and searched for it for fifteen days, before feeling
himself free to form his own plans for carrying out the
instructions given him by Quiros. He weighed anchor on 26th June,
and commenced the voyage which took him through the passage on
which Dalrymple afterwards conferred the name of <span class=
"a">Torres Strait</span>.</p>
<p>Torres' relation or report on this voyage occurs in the form
of a letter from Manila, dated 12th July, 1607, addressed to the
King of Spain, and is, so far as is known, the <i>first
recorded</i> account of the passage of Torres Straits. Had this
report been published at once future explorers would have
followed different lines from those now marked by history. We
have already seen how this report disappeared. There are
indications that Robert de Vaugondy had got some inkling of it,
or of charts relating to it, between 1752, when his map of the
region showed no strait, but only a "bight" on the western side
(the Dutch idea), and 1756, when his map showed the strait. The
report was, in fact, discovered at Manila <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> in 1762, when a copy fell into the hands
of Alexander Dalrymple, who printed the Spanish text in Edinburgh
in 1772, as an appendix to his <i>Charts and Memoirs</i>. He had
not, apparently, mastered its contents, or grasped its
significance, in 1770. Years later,. he translated it into
English, and permitted Captain James Burney to print the
translation in his <i>Discoveries in the South Seas in 1806</i>.
Dalrymple, in fact, only knew of Torres' achievement at second
hand, and chiefly through the references of Arias, when Cook
sailed in the "<i>Endeavour</i>" in 1768.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Flinders' Voyage to Terra Australis in 1801, 1802
and 1803, London, 1814, vol. i, p. 10.]</blockquote>
<p>Up to the last quarter of the eighteenth century, the
references to the voyages of Torres, second hand and
unauthenticated as they were, contained in Arias' Memorial
(written between 1614 and 1641) were practically all that were
known to the world of Torres and Torres Strait.</p>
<p>The last, and not the least important, of the sources of
information regarding Torres have come to light as recently as
1878. These are <span class="a">charts</span> signed by
<span class="a">Prado</span>, and purporting to have been drawn
during his voyage with Torres. It appears that Napoleon I looted
the treasures of the Spanish Archives in a wholesale fashion and
sent them to Paris. "There," says Collingridge, <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> "they were found some years ago by a
friend of mine, who caused them to be restored to their original
owners, and acquainted me with their existence." They were
reproduced in the <i>Bol. de la Soc. Geografica de Madrid</i>,
tom. iv, January, 1878, and, with two letters of Prado, dated
24th and 25th December, 1613, again reproduced by Collingridge.
<b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> Possibly, as Markham suggests,
the surveys were the work of Torres or his Sailing Master,
Fuentidue&ntilde;as, and only the draughtsmanship is to be
credited to Prado; but in any case the charts are undoubtedly
authentic and in accuracy of surveying bear comparison with
modern Admiralty work. Fortunately, Torres followed the pious
custom of his time in naming places discovered by him after the
Saint or Saints whose festivities appeared in the Calendar of the
day, and thus we get several important dates for which no other
authority can be cited.</p>
<blockquote>[2) First Discovery of Australia, p.
122.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[3) The First Discovery of Australia and New Guinea,
Sydney, 1906, pp. 246-256.]</blockquote>
<p>Our sources of information regarding Torres' important voyage
are, therefore, practically limited to (1) Torres' Letter to the
King of Spain, (2) Prado's Charts and Letters and (3) the Arias
Memorial. In the order in which these became known to the world
they should read (1) Arias, (2) Torres and (3) Prado.</p>
<p>It may be here observed that Torres apparently wrote without
having the charts before him, as he is vague and unreliable as to
latitudes; that Prado's charts contain latitudes which agree with
modern official maps; and that the Priests for whom Arias wrote
had to rely, to a great extent, upon hearsay evidence and were
not able to quote from either Torres or Prado, although it is
possible that they had seen the general map of the work of the
expedition referred to by Prado in one of his letters, and which
is still missing.</p>
<p>In spite of short rations, rough winds and the unwillingness
of his crew, Torres, after leaving Espiritu Santo, sailed
south-west and claimed to have passed, by one degree, the
latitude indicated by the sailing orders. In other words, he
reached 21&deg; S. He considered that he had thus proved Espiritu
Santo to be an island. In reality he demonstrated that if it was
a part of the mainland at all it must have been a cape jutting
out from it to the northeast. Having now passed the "prescribed
latitude" by a degree without seeing land, he altered his course
to the north-west, and again (probably about the latitude of
Princess Charlotte Bay, Queensland) to the north-east, and
"<span class="a">fell in with the beginning of New
Guinea</span>," and after coasting to the west for five days,
landed On what he named <span class="a">Tiera de
Buenaventura</span> on 18<i>th July</i>, 1606. Collingridge
clearly identifies this land as <span class="a">Basilisk
Island</span>, so named by Captain John Moresby, R.N., in 1873.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> West of Basilisk Island lies
Hayter Island, which is separated from New Guinea proper by the
narrow China Strait.</p>
<blockquote>[1) See Prado's Chart No. 2 and <i>Discoveries and
Surveys in New Guinea and the D'Entrecasteaux Islands</i>,
London, 1876.]</blockquote>
<p>Torres then sailed along the south coast of <span class=
"a">Hayter Island</span> (which he failed to distinguish from the
mainland of N. Guinea) and westward along the south coast of New
Guinea, noting "many ports, very large, with large rivers and
many plains." "In these parts," he says, "I took possession for
Your Majesty," adding: "We caught in all this land twenty persons
of different nations, that with them we might be able to give a
better account to Your Majesty." Shoals extending to the west
were skirted, and eventually cleared, according to Torres, in
11&deg; S. lat.</p>
<p>Having thus passed through <span class="a">Torres
Strait</span>, Torres hugged the coast of what is now
<span class="a">Dutch New Guinea</span>, mainly on a north-west
course, landing in many places and "taking possession for Your
Majesty," and noted that the natives had "iron, China bells and
other things, by which we knew we were near the Molucas." At last
the point was reached" where <span class="a">New Guinea comes to
an end</span>, fifty leagues before you reach the Molucas." Here
the adventurers found <span class="a">Mahomedan residents</span>,
with whom they traded for such of their immediate necessities as
they could afford to pay for with cloth. The Mahomedans "gave
them news of the events of the Molucas" and spoke of Dutch
ships.</p>
<p>Torres in his report gives impossible latitudes in and about
the <span class="a">Gulf of Papua</span>, and the inference is
inevitable that he was writing from memory and without having the
charts of his voyage, or perhaps even his log, before him.
Therefore, the southmost point (11&deg;) at which he says he
cleared the strait is open to grave doubt, especially as it is
actually nineteen minutes south of Cape York.</p>
<p>Prado's No. 3 Chart <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> shows the
expedition in "<span class="a">The Great Bay of St.
Laurence</span> and <span class="a">Port of Monterey</span>"
modern <span class="a">Orangerie Bay</span>), lat. 10&deg; 25'
(Prado has it 10&deg; 10'), long. 149&deg; 40', with the legend
"Discovered by D. Luis Vaes de Torres, 10 <i>August</i>, 1606."
This careful survey, which agrees admirably with modern charting,
is sufficient evidence of a sojourn of at least a few days, while
the sketched rectangular subdivision of the coast land into what
are probably agricultural areas or <span class=
"a">plantations</span> suggests that the site was considered to
be well adapted for a settlement.</p>
<blockquote>[1) See Collingridge's <i>Discovery of Australia</i>,
p. 251.]</blockquote>
<p>In Prado's No. 4 Map, of the <span class="a">Bay of S. Peter
of Arlanca</span> (lat. 3&deg; 40' S., according to Prado, more
correctly 3&deg; 56', according to modern charts, long. 134&deg;
7' E.), we have no difficulty in recognising, with Collingridge,
<span class="a">Triton Bay</span>, in Dutch New Guinea, nor in
identifying the "<span class="a">Isla del
Cap</span><sup>an.</sup> <span class="a">Luis Vaes de
Torres</span>" with the modern <span class="a">Aiduma
Island</span>. A legend on the map reads: "Discovered by D. Luis
Vaes de Torres, 18<i>th October</i>, 1606."</p>
<p><span class="a">The passage of Torres Strait</span>,
therefore, took place between the dates of Torres' touching at
Orangerie Bay, 10th August, and Triton Bay, 18th October.
Considering that, once he had cleared the reefs and banks of the
Gulf of Papua, and taken a north-westerly course along the Dutch
New Guinea coast, his difficulties were over, it would only be
reasonable to assign two-thirds of the time to the voyage east
and one-third to that west of the turning-point. On this
assumption, the approximate date of clearing the strait would be
24<i>th September</i>.</p>
<p>Torres' report was written at Manila and dated 12th July,
1607, and he states that he had been in that city for two months,
thus fixing the date of his arrival at the <span class=
"a">Philippines</span> approximately at 12<i>th May</i>.</p>
<p>The time employed between Triton Bay (18th October) and the
Philippines (12th May), nearly seven months, has now to be
accounted for. If we allow ten days for bargaining with the
Mahomedans at Triton Bay and leaving New Guinea "where it comes
to a termination fifty leagues before you come to the Molucas,"
the time to be accounted for is narrowed to the period between
28<i>th October</i> and 12<i>th May</i>.</p>
<p>At the outside, the run from the west end of New Guinea to
<span class="a">Batchian</span> (lat. 0&deg; 37' S., long.
117&deg; 36' E.), at the south-east end of the Moluccas, in a sea
already well known to the Spanish, could hardly have taken more
than a month, so that we may provisionally date Torres' arrival
there at 28<i>th November</i>.</p>
<p>On his arrival at <span class="a">Batchian</span>, Torres met
a priest who had about one hundred Christian followers, within
the territory of a friendly Mahomedan king. The priest, says
Torres, "begged me to subdue one of the Ternate islands inhabited
by revolted Mahomedans, to whom Don Pedro de Acunha had given
pardon in Your Majesty's name, which I had maintained; and I sent
advice to the M. de Campo, Juan de Esquival, who governed the
islands of Ternate, of my arrival, and demanded if it was
expedient to give this assistance to the King of Batchian; to
which he answered that it would be of great service to Your
Majesty, if I brought force for that purpose. On this, with 40
Spaniards and 400 Moors of the King of Batchian, I made
<span class="a">war</span>, and in only four days I defeated them
and took the fort and put the King of Batchian in possession of
it in Your Majesty's name, to whom we administered the usual
oaths, stipulating with him that he should never go to war
against Christians and that he should ever be a faithful vassal
to Your Majesty."</p>
<p>Assuming a week to have been occupied by the journey of
Torres' messenger, and another week for the four-days' missionary
war and preparations for the voyage, it was probably about
12<i>th December</i> when Torres himself sailed for <span class=
"a">Ternate</span> (lat. 0&deg; 48' N., long. 127&deg; 18' E.).
He probably did not take more than three days to reach the latter
port, say 15<i>th December</i>.</p>
<p>It is likely enough that Torres stayed for some time at
Ternate, where he was well received by Esquival, the Governor,
for he did not, as we have seen, arrive at <span class=
"a">Manila</span> till about 12th May, and the voyage of about
1,200 knots could hardly have taken five months.</p>
<p>The Moors, or Mahomedans, near the eastern extremity of New
Guinea (Triton Bay?), says Torres, "gave us news of the events of
the Molucas and told us of Dutch ships." Collingridge observes
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> that "the events of the Molucas
were of a stirring nature at that time," and raises the question
of whether the Dutch expedition of 1606 could have been sent out
in consequence of the Dutch having heard of Torres'
discoveries.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Discovery of Australia</i>, p.
236.]</blockquote>
<p>The "<i>Duyfken's</i>" cruise along the coasts of New Guinea
and the Cape York Peninsula took place within the limits set by
the yacht's departure from Bantam on 18th November, 1605, and its
return in or before June, 1906. It is therefore simply impossible
that the Dutch could have heard, prior to the despatch of the
"<i>Duyfken</i>" of the doings of Torres, who only reached
Ternate on 12th December, 1606. In fact the "<i>Duyfken</i>" had
returned to port before Torres had got in touch with civilisation
near the western extremity of New Guinea.</p>
<p>In Torres' narrative, there is not a word implying that he
laid any claim to the discovery of a passage between New Guinea
and Australia. On the contrary, everything points to his having
made for a passage regarding which he was already in possession
of some information, and there is a great deal of evidence that
the passage had already been used many times by Spanish and
Portuguese, although its existence was hidden from the Dutch and
English. The fact that Prado carefully labels the charted
landing-places on the south coast of New Guinea as having been
discovered by Torres in no way supports the claim (which Torres
never made) to the discovery of the strait itself.</p>
<p>The narrow sea (ninety-eight knots across) known as
<span class="a">Torres Strait</span>, between New Guinea and Cape
York, is crowded with islands and coral reefs, among which a
newcomer would be lucky indeed, as well as bold and skilful, if
he found an east and west passage. Modern surveys have laid down
nine such practicable passages, known, in their order from north
to south, as Napoleon, Bligh, Bramble, Yule, Simpson, Dayman,
Prince of Wales, Normanby and <i>Endeavour</i>. The question is,
by which of these did Torres clear the strait?</p>
<p>As Torres himself gives an impossible northern latitude for
his voyage in the Gulf of Papua, and the southern latitude
(11&deg;) he assigns to the strait is no less impossible, for the
reason that it would have brought him well into Queensland, there
can be no doubt that he was speaking from memory, and in round
numbers, without, for the time, having access to the documents
which would have enabled him to make accurate statements. On the
other hand, his description of the point where he was able to
turn from a southerly to a north-westerly course is of the
highest value. "Here," he says, "there were many large islands
and there appeared to be more to the southward." Such a
description would be ludicrously incorrect if written from any
point of view whatever in 11&deg; S. lat., but it fits admirably
what would be seen by an observer passing through the
<span class="a">Bligh Channel</span> (10&deg; 20' S.). This is
the second channel which Torres could possibly have found, and I
eliminate the first, or Napoleon, channel because it is obviously
hard to enter and barely navigable without the aid of steam.
Torres was, in fact, sailing west, with Jervis and the Belle Vue
Islands on his right and the two large islands, Mulgrave and
Banks, on his left, while catching glimpses of Hammond,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Horn and Prince of Wales Islands
still further to the south. I cannot, therefore, agree with
Collingridge's suggestion that <span class="a">Captain
Cook</span> in 1770 merely rediscovered, in his Endeavour Strait,
the channel used by Torres in 1606. No exception can be taken to
the name of Torres being applied to the whole of the strait, but
the merit of finding channels among its dangerous reefs is
considerably greater than if the reefs had been visible
islands.</p>

<blockquote class="inline">"T<small>HE</small> discovery of
<span class="u">New Guinea</span> is most commonly credited to
the Portuguese. In the early days, these people&mdash;then famous
for their brave efforts in exploration and settlement&mdash;held
Malacca <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and the Spice Islands
(<i>i.e</i>., the Moluccas). In 1527, one Jorgo de Meneses was
sent from Malacca to the latter islands. He attempted a new
<i>route</i> by going round the north of Borneo, and is said to
have then discovered New Guinea. He called the new island Papua,
because of the fact that the natives of the Molucca Islands
called the New Guinea aborigines 'Papuans,' on account of their
woolly hair. Next in order came the Spanish navigator Alvaro de
Saavedra, in 1537. In 1545 his countryman Ortis de Retes,
proceeding to take a more southerly course to the Moluccas, in
order to catch more favourable winds, sighted the island, and
imagined he was the discoverer, and named it Nueva Guinea. The
island first appeared on Mercator's chart of 1569."<b style=

Herald</i>, 27th May, 1916.]</blockquote>
<p>The Dutch had been more or less in possession of Java since
1597, but even within the first decade the necessity for
expansion had begun to be felt, and had a spur been needed it
would have been supplied by the rivalry excited by the comings
and goings of the Spanish and Portuguese. The Dutch "General
United East India Company," founded in 1602, was a power in the
East for three centuries, until its functions were absorbed by
the Government of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>On 10th April, 1602, at Banda Island, on board the ship
"<i>Gelderlant</i>," a general meeting of ships' officers was
held by order of Admiral Wolphert Hermanszoon. The meeting drew
up instructions for the yacht "<i>Duyfken</i>" [<i>sic</i>],
Skipper Willem Corneliszoon Schouten, and Supercargo Claes
Gaeff.</p>
<p>The ship was to proceed to the island of Ceran [<i>sic</i>],
calling at certain ports, <i>e.g</i>., Queuin, Quelibara,
Quelilonhen and Goulegoulij, where trade might be expected, and
to enquire whether anything was to be had besides sago, what was
the commerce of the port and to what places, what commodities
were in demand, how far their navigation had extended, if they
knew anything of Nova Guinea, and if they had sent ships there or
had been visited by ships from that country.</p>
<p>The above instructions were entered in the
"<i>Gelderlant's</i>" log of 10th April, 1602, and under date
15th May following a note gives what appears to be a brief
summary of the report brought back by the
"<i>Duyfken</i>":&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"They [the Ceramites, when
interrogated] can say nothing definite respecting the island of
New Guinea, but say that white people live on the south side,
inhabited by Portuguese, but they had seen no Portuguese ships.
They can give no information about their [the New Guineans']
commerce and products."<b style=

the Dutch Colonial Institute, Delft. Published by the Royal Dutch
Geographical Society in Commemoration of the Twenty-fifth
Anniversary of its Foundation. Leiden, E. J. Brill; London, Luzac
and Co., 1889, p. 3.]</blockquote>
<p>The language of the note is somewhat involved, but it may be
taken to mean "white people, possibly Portuguese." Portugal had
been in possession of the Molucca Islands, then usually referred
to as the Spice Islands, since 1512, and it is more than likely
that in the course of nearly a century her sailors had acquired
some knowledge of the not very distant southern coast of New
Guinea proper and had even spent some time on the land.</p>
<p>In 1605, Jan Willemszoon Verschoor, Manager of the Dutch East
India Company at Bantam, Java, sent out the "<i>Duyfken</i>" on a
voyage of discovery, under command of <span class="a">Willem
Janszoon</span>. The Subcargo (Junior Supercargo?) was
<span class="a">Jan Lodewijs van Rosingijn</span>.</p>
<p>There is much room for doubt as to whether the
"<i>Duyfken</i>" was (1) the 60-ton yacht of the expedition which
was equipped in 1603, was commanded by Steven van der Hagen, and
came out to the East Indies, or (2) the 30-ton yacht attached to
the expedition which left the Texel in Holland on 2nd April,
1595, and which sailed by Madagascar, reaching the south-west
coast of Sumatra on 1st June, 1596, called at Bali in 1597,
turned back on 26th February of that year, and returned to
Holland <i>via</i> the south coast of Java and the Cape of Good
Hope, reaching the Texel on 14th August, 1597. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<blockquote>[2) Collingridge, pp. 216, 222, 240.]</blockquote>
<p>No description of van der Hagen's 60-ton "<i>Duyfken</i>" is
available, beyond the statement of her tonnage. The Texel
"<i>Duyfken</i>" is described as "a small yacht of 30 tons,
carrying 20 men, and having 2 large and 6 small guns, with 2
bombards," and her master was Simon Lambertsz(oon) Mau. The other
vessels of the expedition were of 400, 400, and 200 tons
respectively. It is reasonable to suppose that this
"<i>Duyfken</i>" acted as a tender to the larger vessels, and it
is unlikely that in addition to her armament and twenty men she
could have had carrying capacity for native "trade" and stores
for her crew sufficient for a voyage of seven months. In the
course of the voyage on which she is first heard of, she probably
drew supplies periodically from the larger ships of the
expedition. I incline, therefore, to the opinion that the 60-ton
yacht was the one which Willem Janszoon commanded from November,
1605, to June, 1606.</p>
<p>The "<i>Duyfken</i>" left <span class="a">Bantam</span> for
New Guinea on 28th November, 1605, and was back at <span class=
"a">Banda Island</span> in or before June, 1606. Janszoon visited
<span class="a">Kei</span> and <span class="a">Aru Islands</span>
and made the coast of <span class="a">New Guinea</span> in 5&deg;
south latitude. He then followed the land south-eastward, passing
<span class="a">Torres Strait</span> without settling the
question of whether or not there was a passage, although less
than six months later <span class="a">Torres</span> left the New
Hebrides and made for the strait, evidently guided by previous
information. Still under the impression that he was off the New
Guinea coast, Janszoon kept the land in sight to 131 degrees of
south latitude. Instructions drawn up for the use of <span class=
"a">Abel Tasman</span> in 1644 refer to the "<i>Duyfken's</i>"
voyage in these terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"It being ascertained that vast
regions were for the greater part uncultivated and certain parts
inhabited by savage, cruel, black barbarians, who slew some of
our sailors, so that no information was obtained touching the
exact lie of the country or the commodities obtainable or in

necessaries, been compelled to return and abandon the discovery
they had begun, only registering in their chart, by the name of
<span class="u">Keerweer</span>, the extreme point of the

Banda, having found the iland; but on sending their men on shoare

Heathens, which are man-eaters. So they were constrained to
returne, finding no good to be done there."</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[3) Heeres, translating into Dutch, substitutes
"Hollandse" for "Flemmings."]</blockquote>
<p>The States of Holland and West Friesland had given the (Dutch)
<span class="a">General United East India Company</span> certain
advice touching a charter for the Australia Company, and a
Memorandum, dated 2nd August, 1618, was laid before the East
India Company as a basis for the reply. It is argued in this
document that the Australia Company should be excluded from the
southern parts between the meridian of the east end of Ceylon and
that lying 100 miles east of the Solomon Islands, because the
East India Company had already busied itself with this part of
New Guinea, instancing the explorations, about 1606, by the
"<i>Duyve</i>" ("<i>Duyfken</i>") by Skipper Willem Janszoon and
Supercargo Jan Lodovijkszoon van Rosingijn, "who made sundry
discoveries on the said coast of Nova Guinea, as is <span class=
"a">amply set forth in their journals</span>." Heeres remarks
that therefore the journals of the expedition must have been
extant in 1618. They were extant, I have no doubt, in 1623, when
<span class="a">Carstenszoon</span> sailed the "<i>Pera</i>"
along the west coast of Cape York Peninsula. Indeed, a close
reading of the "<i>Pera's</i>" log gives the impression that the
"<i>Duyfken's</i>" charts and journals were the daily study of
the officers of the "<i>Pera</i>." Yet there is no reference in
Tasman's instructions, drawn up in 1644, to the charts and
journals of the "<i>Duyfken</i>."</p>
<p>The "<i>Pera's</i>" log, hereinafter quoted at length,
contains the following entry, dated 11th May, 1623:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"In the afternoon we sailed past a
large river (which the men of the '<i>Duyfken</i>' went up with a
boat in 1606, and where one of them was killed by the missiles
thrown by the blacks). To this river, which is in lat. 11&deg;
48', we have given the name of <span class="u">Revier de
Carpentier</span> <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> in the new
chart."</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) This river is now named the <span class=
"u">Skardon</span> (see Queensland 4-mile Map, Sheet
21A).]</blockquote>
<p>I take this to be evidence of Carstenszoon's familiarity with
the "<i>Duyfken's</i>" charts and journals.</p>
<p>There is no absolute certainty that any of the
"<i>Duyfken's</i>" men, who "went up" the Carpentier River "in a
boat," set foot on the land. The man killed by missiles may have
been speared in the boat. If any of the crew landed, this is the
<span class="a">earliest recorded landing</span> of white men in
Australia.</p>
<p>The exact locality of the greater disaster which, according to
the Kling skipper, resulted in the death of nine of the
"<i>Duyfken's</i>" crew, is not stated. It may, however, be
presumed that the slaughter took place at <span class="a">Cape
Keerweer</span>, and finally determined the abandonment of the
enterprise. The loss of nine men, added to the loss of one at the
Carpentier River, must have left a 30-or even a 60-ton vessel
very short-handed.</p>
<p>The probability that the <i>Duyfken</i> "made still another
voyage to New Guinea, including possibly the Cape York Peninsula,
has been argued from the following passage in <i>A Narrative and
journal of the Voyage made from Bantam to the Coast of
Choromandel and other Parts of India</i>, by <span class=
"a">Paulus van Solt</span>, in the Years 1605, 1606, 1607,
1608:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"On the 4th of March, 1607, through
God's mercy, arrived before the Castle [of Victoria, Amboyna]. .
. Here we found the yacht <i>Duyfken</i>' which had come from
Nova Guinea [was van Nova Guinea gekommen]."<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) Heeres, p. 6.]</blockquote>
<p>When van Solt arrived at Amboyna, only nine months had elapsed
since the "<i>Duyfken</i>" had put in to Banda on her return from
her famous voyage. She might very well have made another voyage
to New Guinea in that time, but on the other hand, she may only
have been pointed out to van Solt as the vessel which had made
the adventurous and disastrous voyage, the fame of which had not
yet been forgotten.</p>
<p>At the time when Torres made his way through the strait
between New Guinea and Australia&mdash;a strait which had
probably been known to others before him&mdash;and when Janszoon
sailed past the western opening of the passage and coasted
Australia for 250 miles to the south, never doubting that he was
following the coastline of New Guinea, Queen Elizabeth was not
long dead and William Shakespeare was still a living force. The
events occurring in the Cape York Peninsula some three centuries
later were contemporaneous with the gay adventure of Germany in
setting forth, carrying "sword and fire, red ruin and the
breaking up of realms," for the acquisition of
"world-domination," her title being that she was strong enough to
take whatever she coveted, and found instead the "downfall" which
had been ironically alluded to in her boasting as the absurd and
wholly unimaginable alternative.</p>
<p>Through the first three centuries of Australian history,
contemporary events in Europe affected more or less the course of
exploration. The reader will be apt to reflect, as an example, on
the bearing of the Napoleonic wars on the career of Flinders, and
I venture to assert that Australian history is no isolated
phenomenon, but will be best understood by a reader who can
picture to himself what, at any given date, was happening in
other portions of the globe.</p>

<p>R<small>EPORTS</small> having reached Batavia of the loss of
the English ship "<i>Triall</i>" and the perilous experiences of
three Dutch ships, the "<i>Wapen van Hoorn</i>,"
"<i>Amsterdam</i>" and "<i>Dordrecht</i>," on the north-western
coast of Australia, the Governor and Council of the East India
Company at Batavia resolved to dispatch an expedition for further
explorations of the Southern Land. Instructions were accordingly
made out for the yachts "<i>Haring</i>" and "<i>Hasewint</i>."
Unforeseen circumstances having, however, prevented these yachts
carrying out the orders, they were taken over by the
"<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Aernem</i>."</p>
<p>The full text of the instructions is given by <span class=
"a">Professor Heeres</span> in his Commemoration Volume, <i>The
Part borne by the Dutch</i>, together with an English translation
by Mr. C. Stoffel. The latter is followed hereunder, except that
I have occasionally employed an English word or two which
appeared "more agreeable to the text" than the expression
selected by the translator.</p>
<p class="negindent2">"INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE YACHTS 'HARINGH' AND
'HASEWINT,' SELECTED FOR THE JOINT EXPLORATION OF THE SOUTHERN
LAND."</p>
<blockquote class="inline"><span class="u">Inasmuch</span> as our
Superiors earnestly enjoin us to despatch hence some yachts, with
the object of making discoveries in the Southern Land; and since,
moreover, experience has taught, through great perils incurred by
several of our ships, and still more through the destruction of
the English ship '<i>Triall</i>' on the said coast, how necessary
it is to have full and accurate knowledge of the true position of
this land, so that further misfortunes may henceforth be
prevented as much as is possible; and as, moreover, it is
desirable that this land, or any inhabited portion thereof,
should be explored, so as to ascertain whether any trade with
them might be worth while;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="inline"><span class="u">"Therefore</span>, for
the purpose before mentioned, we have resolved to fit out the
yachts '<i>Haringh'</i> [herring] and '<i>Hasewint</i>' to
undertake the voyage and to discover as much regarding the
resources of these regions as God Almighty shall
permit.]</blockquote>
<blockquote class="inline">"You will accordingly set sail from
here together, run out of Sunda Strait, and steer your course
from the western extremity of Java to the South Land, keeping as
close to the wind as ever you can, so as not to be driven too far
west by the southeasterly winds which generally prevail in these
waters. You may therefore run on as far as the thirty-second or
thirty-third degree if you do not before that fall in with the
land. If you should have sailed so far, and yet have seen no
land, you may conclude <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> that you
have fallen off too far westward, for sundry ships coming from
the fatherland have accidentally come upon the South Land before
these latitudes. In this case, you will have to shape your course
eastward and run on in that direction until you sight
land.</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) It will be observed that no direct observation
for longitude is suggested.]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote class="inline">"In running over to the South Land
aforesaid, you will have to keep a careful lookout, as soon as
you get in 14&deg; or 15&deg;, seeing that the said English ship
<i>Triall</i>,' when in 20&deg; 10' S. lat., got on certain
sunken rocks, which, according to the observation of the English
pilot, extend for 7 miles north-east and south-west, although no
dry land was visible. Nevertheless, the men who saved themselves
in the pinnace and boat and arrived here stated that about
13&deg; or 14&deg; they had seen masses of reeds, wood and other
drift floating about in the sea, from which they concluded that
there must be land or islands somewhere in the neighbourhood. The
aforesaid sunken rocks on which the <i>Triall</i>' was wrecked
ought, according to the report of the Englishmen, to be due south
of the west cape of Java.<br>
<br>
"Having reached the South Land in the said latitude or near it,
you will then sail along the same as far as lat. 50&deg;, in case
the land extends so far south, but if the land should come to an
end before you have oversailed the said latitude, and should be
found to trend eastward, you may follow it in that direction for
a little, but if you find no further southward extension
possible, you had better turn back. You will do the same if the
land should turn westward. On the return voyage you will run
along the coast as far as it extends to the north, and next
eastward or otherwise as the land goes, and thus follow the land
as close and as far as possible and as you judge your provisions
will suffice for the return home, even if, in so doing, you
should sail round the whole land and emerge to southward.<br>
<br>
"The main object for which you are dispatched on this occasion is
that from 45 or 50 degrees, or from the furthest point to which
the said land shall be found to extend southward between these
latitudes, up to the northmost end of the South Land, you are to
discover and survey all capes, forelands, bays, lands, islands,
rocks, reefs, sandbanks, deeps, shallows, roadsteads, winds,
currents and whatever else appertains to the same, so that they
may be charted and noted, with their true latitudes, longitudes,
bearings and conditions. You will moreover land in various places
and carefully observe whether they are inhabited, and what sort
of people and country there are, what towns and villages there
are, their government, their religion, their policy, their
war-equipment, their waters, their vessels, their fisheries, and
their commodities and manufactures, and more especially what
minerals they have, such as gold, silver, tin, iron, lead and
copper, as well as precious stones and pearls, and what
vegetables, animals and fruits these lands afford.<br>
<br>
"To all of which particulars and whatever else may be worth
noting you will pay diligent attention, keeping a careful record
or journal with reference thereto, that we may get full
information of all your doings and experiences and the Company
may obtain due and perfect knowledge of the natural resources of
these lands in return for their heavy outlay.<br>
<br>
"To all the places which you touch at, you will give appropriate
names, choosing for the same either the names of the United
Provinces or of the towns therein, or any other dignified names.
Of all which places, lands and islands, the Commander and
Officers of the said yachts will, by order and pursuant to the
Commission of The Honourable the Governor-General, Jan Peterszoon
Coen, sent out there [<i>i.e</i>., to the East Indies] by their
High Mightinesses the States General of the United Netherlands,
together with Messieurs the Directors of the General Chartered
United East India Company in these parts, by solemn declaration
signed by the Ships' Councils, take formal possession, and in
token thereof, besides, erect a stone column in such places as
shall be taken possession of, on which should be recorded in
bold, legible characters the year, the month, the day of the week
and the date, the person by whom, and when such possession has
been taken on behalf of the States General above mentioned. You
will likewise endeavour to enter into friendly relations and make
covenants with as such kings and nations as you shall happen to
fall in with, and prevail upon them to place themselves under the
protection of the States of the United Netherlands; of which
covenants and treaties you will likewise cause proper documents
to be exchanged with the other parties.<br>
<br>
"All lands, islands, places, etc., which you shall take
possession of, as aforesaid, you will duly mark in the chart,
with their true latitude, longitude and bearings, together with
the names newly conferred on the same.<br>
<br>
"According to the oath of allegiance which each of you, jointly
and severally has sworn to the Lords States General, His Princely
Excellency and Messieurs the Directors, none of you shall be
allowed to secrete, or by underhand means to retain any written
documents, journals, drawings or observations touching the
expedition but every one of you shall be bound on his return here
faithfully to deliver up the same without exception.<br>
<br>
"According to the writings of Jan Van Huygen [van Linschoten] and
the opinion of several others, some parts of this South Land are
likely to yield gold, a point in which you should inquire as
carefully as possible.<br>
<br>
"We also give you, for an experiment, divers ironwares, cloths,
'coast' dress [Heeres explains, in a footnote, 'from the coast of
Coromandel'] and linen stuff which you will show and try to
dispose of to such people as you may meet with, always carefully
noting what articles are found to be most in demand, what
quantities might be disposed of, and what might be obtained in
exchange for them. We also send samples of gold, silver, copper,
iron, lead and pearls, that you may inquire whether these
articles are known to the inhabitants and might be obtained there
in any reasonable quantity.<br>
<br>
"In landing anywhere you will exercise extreme caution, and never
go ashore inland unless well armed, trusting no one, however
simple the people may appear be, or how plausible, but be always
ready to stand on the defensive, so that no disaster may overtake
you, such as, God knows, has often happened in like cases. Should
people come out to you from the land, you will take the like care
that they suffer no harm from our men.<br>
<br>
"Coming to the northern extremity and east side of the South
Land, you will diligently enquire whether any sandalwood,
nutmegs, cloves, or other aromatic fruits grow there. Item, if
there are any good harbours or conveniently situated or fruitful
lands, where colonies might be planted which might be amply
self-supporting. In a word, let nothing pass you unobserved, and
whatever you find bring us a full and particular report of it, by
which you will do the States of the United Netherlands service
and lay up special honour for yourselves.<br>
<br>
"In places where you meet with people, you will, by dexterity
[behendlicheyt] or otherwise, get hold of some adults, or, still
better, young lads or girls, to the end that they should be
brought up here, and later, when opportunity offers, be broken in
at the said quarters.<br>
<br>
"The command of these two yachts is given to <span class="u">Jan

the Council and preside therein, by virtue of Our Special

<p>No better instructions could have been drawn up to serve the
guidance of sailors setting out on a voyage of discovery with the
object of acquiring geographical and commercial knowledge
(although some clauses indicating what was expected, such as the
references to kings and nations and treaties of alliance, may
bring a smile on the faces of those who have come to know what
was the actual condition of affairs. In other parts, the language
employed is intentionally and diplomatically ambiguous. A notable
instance is the instruction regarding the <span class="a">capture
of slaves</span>. The word "behendlicheyt" meaning literally
"hardihood," might be rendered as dexterity, adroitness,
ingenuity, strategy, smartness, trickery or treachery, and the
addition of "or otherwise" left no room for delicate scruples.
The sailors made no mistake in interpreting their orders to mean
that they were to capture slaves, with a minimum of friction, if
possible, but in any case to capture them somehow. It is not so
written, but it is easy to understand that the voyagers were
expected, by the capture of "adults, or, still better, young lads
or girls," to do something substantial towards recouping the
expenses of the expedition. Ample evidence will be found in the
log of the "<i>Pera</i>," which carried out the instructions
originally drawn up for the "<i>Haring</i>" and
"<i>Hasewint</i>," that this was the true meaning of the
instructions. One hundred and thirty-three years later, the Dutch
ship "<i>Rijder</i>" was carrying on the same tactics as were
employed by the "<i>Pera</i>," and on the same western shore of
the Cape York Peninsula. Even while the "<i>Pera</i>" was at sea,
Torres was at work on the same lines, for his Spanish masters, on
the southern shores of New Guinea; only he was more successful,
as he records with satisfaction that in the course of the voyage
he had captured twenty persons.</p>
<p>Early in the seventeenth century, the idea that there was
anything reprehensible in slavery had barely suggested itself to
the European mind, and I desire to point out that the Dutch were
neither better nor worse than their contemporaries. If their
proceedings appear simply abominable to readers in the twentieth
century, there can be no doubt that those of their contemporary
rivals were dictated by the same principles and carried out by
the same methods.</p>
<p>At the present day we are confronted by the spectacle of
savage populations dying out wherever they come in contact with
comparatively civilised men. Belated Christianity, benevolence,
philanthropy, charity or fair dealing seem alike powerless to
arrest the working of what appears to be a natural law. In these
circumstances, it is open to argument that for savage races a
probationary period of <span class="a">servitude</span> is
preferable to its only alternative, <span class=
"a">extinction</span>.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> history of the voyages of the "<i>Pera</i>"
and "<i>Aernem</i>" in 1623 may be studied in the original
records of the Dutch East India Company by those who have the
opportunity. They consist, in the first place, of a "covering
letter," dated 3rd January, 1624, from the Governor-General and
Council to the Directors of the Company, and secondly, what is
entitled <i>Journal kept by Jan Carstensz.(oon) on his Voyage to
Nova Guinea.</i></p>
<p>The letter states that, in January, 1623, Governor
<span class="a">van Speult</span> dispatched from <span class=
"a">Amboina</span> the yachts "<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Arnhem</i>"
for the purpose of cultivating friendly relations with the
inhabitants of Queij, Aroe and Tenimber and of exploring the land
of Nova Guinea. The above-named islanders, it is further stated,
had of their own free will placed themselves under the rule and
protection of the States of the United Netherlands and promised
to come and trade with the fortresses of Banda and Amboina. For
the remaining portion of the voyage, along the land of Nova
<span class="a">Guinea</span> (which was described as a barren
country, inhabited by absolutely barbarous, cruel savages), the
Directors were referred to the enclosure itself.</p>
<p>The second document, the <span class="a">Journal</span>, was
printed in full by L. C. D. Van Dijk, in 1859, in <i>Mededlingen
Oost-Indisch Archief: No. 1, Twee Togten naar de Golf van
Carpentaria</i>. The portions relating to Australia were
subsequently printed by Professor Heeres (Leiden, E. J. Brill,
London, Luzac and Co.) in his work <i>The Part of the Dutch in
the Discovery of Australia, 1606-1765</i>, issued by the Royal
Dutch Geographical Society on its twenty-fifth anniversary, in
1899, together with an English translation by Mr. C. Stoflel. The
Journal itself is bald and businesslike, makes no pretensions to
literary form, and is even careless as to grammatical accuracy.
Stoffel's translation, on the other hand, is a dainty piece of
work. It is as if he had rewritten a plain tale with the object
of suiting it for acceptance by a high-class magazine. He has,
indeed, while taking no serious liberties with the facts,
presented the tale in the garb of early seventeenth-century
English, the trick of which he has caught admirably. The only
fault to be found with the translation is that it is better than
the original. In the following pages, I have ventured, while
freely acknowledging my indebtedness to the Dutch translator, to
present an almost literally translated English version which, in
my opinion, more nearly reflects the rough-hewn story of the
author.</p>
<p>The Report is in the form of a <span class="a">diary</span>
kept on board the "<i>Pera</i>," and is probably in the main a
transcription of the ship's log, and is signed by <span class=
"a">Jan Carstenszoon</span>, the <span class="a">Commodore</span>
of the Expedition. It is headed "Journal kept by Jan Carstensz,"
that being the contraction in common use at a time when surnames
denoted only that the person known by a certain Christian name
was the son (zoon) of somebody else.</p>
<p>Although the "<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Aernem</i>" took over the
orders originally drawn up for the "<i>Haring</i>h" and
"<i>Hasewint</i>," the <span class="a">skipper</span> of the
"<i>Pera</i>," <span class="a">Jan Sluijs</span>, was not in the
position which was to have been occupied by Jan Vos, who,
presumably, was the skipper of one of the two vessels. Vos, it
was intended, should carry the flag, convene the Council and
preside therein." In short, he was not only to command his own
ship but to be commodore of the expedition as well. The
<span class="a">skippers</span> of the "<i>Pera</i>" (Sums) and
"<i>Aernem</i>" (<span class="a">Meliszoon</span>) had no higher
status than that of <span class="a">Sailing Masters</span>, and
although most of the hard work was assigned to them, they were
evidently of less importance than the merchants or traders
(kooplieden), as witness the order of precedence observed in the
Aru and Queij inscriptions.</p>
<p>A democratic institution, <i>viz.</i>, a "<span class="a">Full
Council</span>" of the assembled officers of both ships,
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> seems to a modern lay reader to
have been well calculated to destroy all order and discipline,
and yet there is no evidence that on these two ships any serious
trouble resulted.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The composition of the Full Council is explained
in Tasman's instructions.]</blockquote>
<p>From a reference in the log to a resolution of the Council on
a certain date, which resolution is not mentioned in the log of
that date, there is reason to suppose that the proceedings of the
Council were recorded in a separate minute book, which has been
lost, or lost sight of.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know the names of all the
adventurers who set out in 1623 and who lighted upon the Cape
York Peninsula, but no list is given in the log, only a few names
being mentioned incidentally, while a few more can be gathered
from other documents.</p>
<p><span class="a">Jan Carstenszoon</span>, "Opper Coopman"
(Upper merchant, or trader or <span class="a">supercargo</span>)
on the "<i>Pera</i>," acted as <span class="a">Commodore</span>
of the expedition. The <span class="a">Assistant
Supercargo</span> Of the "<i>Pera</i>" was <span class="a">Pieter
Lingtes</span> Or <span class="a">Lintiens</span>. The
<span class="a">Skipper</span> was <span class="a">Jan
Sluijs</span>. The <span class="a">Upper Steersman</span> (Chief
Mate)was <span class="a">Arend Martenszoon de Leeuw</span>, and
the <span class="a">Under Steersman</span> (Second Mate) was
<span class="a">Willem Joosten van Coolsteerdt</span>, who was
made skipper of the "<i>Aernem</i>" on the death of Meliszoon,
the original master (10th February, 1623). The number of the crew
is nowhere stated, but at any rate it was large enough to furnish
a boat's crew of thirteen men on occasion. A <span class=
"a">carpenter</span> and an "<span class="a">assistant</span>"
are referred to, but it is not clear whether the latter was the
carpenter's apprentice or a midshipman. A <span class=
"a">corporal</span> and <span class="a">ten musketeers</span> are
mentioned, but it is doubtful whether these were marines or
sailors armed for the occasion. There was also a <span class=
"a">barber-surgeon</span>, and a "<span class=
"a">jurebass</span>", who was an expert swimmer and who died of
liver complaint or of the operation performed by the barber.
Stoffel is unable to give an English equivalent for "jurebass"
and no more can I, nor can any Dutchman whom I have had an
opportunity of consulting. We must, therefore, for the present be
content to define a Jurebass as "a person who performs
jurebassial functions." My conjecture wavers between a slave,
prisoner, convict or hostage on the one hand and a lent or
temporarily impressed local pilot on the other.</p>
<p>The "<i>Aernem</i>" set out on the voyage under command of
<span class="a">Dirk Meliszoon</span>, assisted by an unnamed
<span class="a">first mate</span> and a <span class="a">second
mate</span> named <span class="a">Jan Janszoon</span>. On 10th
February, 1623, Meliszoon was killed by natives of New Guinea,
together with an "assistant." (midshipman?) named <span class=
"a">Jan Willemszoon van den Briel</span> and eight others. After
this disaster, <span class="a">van Coolsteerdt</span>, second
mate of the "Perez," was given command of the "<i>Aernem</i>,"
and <span class="a">Janszoon</span>, the "<i>Aernem's</i>" second
mate, was made <span class="a">first mate</span>.</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this study to follow the fortunes of
the expedition except in so far as they are connected with the
Cape York Peninsula, but it may be mentioned that the
"<i>Pera's</i>" officers completed their voyage under the
mistaken impression that they had demonstrated the <span class=
"a">Continuity of Ceram and New Guinea</span>, although
pre-existing maps showed this stretch of land to be divided into
a chain of islands. When <span class="a">de
Leeuw</span>&mdash;evidently some time after the
voyage&mdash;drew his famous sketch-chart, he must have been
satisfied of the error of this conclusion, as he showed the
islands. The expedition abandoned the search for the alleged
opening now known as <span class="a">Torres Strait</span>,
believing that it <span class="a">did not exist</span>, and
coasted Australia for eight degrees southward, having failed to
realise that New Guinea was a distinct island. On the other hand,
they furnished the earliest account of a portion of Australia and
added materially to the knowledge of New Guinea.</p>

<p>O<small>N</small> 11th March, 1623, the "<i>Pera</i>" and
"<i>Aernem</i>" anchored off a promontory, which they named
<span class="a">Valsch Caep</span> (False Cape), the western
extremity of what is now distinguished as <span class=
"a">Frederick Henry Island</span>, and is separated from the
mainland of New Guinea by the narrow Princess Marianne or Dourga

York Peninsula</span>, is reproduced almost <i>verbatim</i>.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"In the morning of the 12th [March,
1623], the breeze from the NW. In the forenoon, I, personally,
rowed to the land, with the two boats well manned and armed, in
order to see if there was anything worthy of note there; but when
we had got within a musket shot from the land, the water became
so shallow that we could not reach it, whereupon we all of us
went through the clay up to our waists and with great difficulty
reached the beach, where we saw a number of fresh human
footprints. On going a short distance into the bush, we saw 20 or
more huts made of dried grass, the huts being so small and
cramped that a man could hardly creep into them, from which we
could sufficiently conclude that the natives must be poor and
miserable specimens of humanity. We afterwards tried to penetrate
somewhat further into the bush, in order to ascertain the nature
and situation of the country. As we were returning, a number of
<span class="u">blacks</span> sprang out of the bush and let fly
their <span class="u">arrows</span> at us very furiously and with
a horrible shouting, wounding a carpenter in the belly and an
apprentice in the leg. They also made signals to other blacks to
come to their assistance. Being thus hard pressed, we fired three
or four muskets at the blacks, killing one stone dead, which
utterly took away their courage, and they dragged the dead man
into the bush. Being so far from the boats and a very difficult
path to travel, we returned, rowed out and went on board. The
same day, at low water, we saw a great shoal, extending SE., S.
and SW. from us, where we had been with the yachts on the 11th.
The said shoal stretches fully 4 miles [16 minutes] WSW. and W.
by S. of the land or hook, to which has been given in the new
chart the name of <span class="u">Valsch Caep</span>, and which
is in lat. 8&deg; 15' S. [really 8&deg; 21' and about 70 miles
[280 minutes] east [really SE.] of Aru.<br>
<br>
"<span class="u">Note</span> that the land which we have touched
at, as above mentioned, is low-lying and half-submerged to the
north, so that a large part of it is under water at high tide. In
the south it is somewhat higher, and here some men inhabit it,
and possess huts, but so far as we could ascertain it is barren,
although closely covered with tall, wild trees. The men are quite
black and naked. Their hair curls, like that of the Papuans. They
wear certain fish-bones through the nose, and through the ears
pieces of the bark of trees, a span in length, so that they look
more like monsters than human beings. Their weapons are
<span class="u">arrows and bows</span>, with which they are very
expert.<br>
<br>
"On the 13<i>th</i>, the wind N.: good weather and the current
stronger to west than to north. We got under sail in the
forenoon, course WNW. to get into deeper water, and when we had
run a short distance we got about 8 feet, upon which we turned
back, and towards evening anchored in 2 fathoms.<br>
<br>
"On the 14<i>th</i>, good weather, the wind N. by W., and the
current, as before, strong to the SW. At midday, both boats sent
out to take soundings, and they went fully a miles WNW. of the
yachts without finding anywhere more than 1&frac12; or 2 fathoms
of water. The same day, it was found practicable to set up again
the '<i>Aernem's</i>' main topmast (which had been lowered
because it was useless in the calm weather), for which the
weather was now every day becoming more suitable.<br>
<br>
"On the 15<i>th</i>, wind NNE., good weather, and the current as
strong as before. At midday, got under sail, on a tide coming
from the NW., in the hope of getting clear of the shoals, but
after beating about till towards evening, we were forced by
contrary currents to anchor in 3 fathoms.<br>

before midday. In the course of the day the wind dropped. Towards
evening the wind veered round to WSW. Course NNW. along the
shallows, in 2&frac12; and 2 fathoms. In the evening, anchored in
3 fathoms. We have found that in these parts the currents set
very strongly to SW., as before mentioned, and that the water
rises and falls fully 1&frac12; and 2 fathoms at each tide.<br>
<br>
"The 17<i>th</i>, the wind E. in the morning. Thereupon we set
sail, course WNW. and W. by N., getting into deeper water, about
5 fathoms. At noon the latitude was 8&deg; 4'. In the evening we

<br>
<blockquote class="inline">"On the 22<i>nd</i>, the Council
having been convened, it was finally resolved to land with the
two boats properly manned and armed, seeing that the coast here
is covered with coco-nut trees, and is also higher, better
looking and more fruitful than any country which we have seen
hitherto: afterwards when we failed to get ashore because of
mud-flats, we rowed to the before-mentioned islet, and let go the
anchor in order to visit it. While we were so engaged, the yacht
'<i>Aernem</i>' got adrift, owing to the force of the current and
the wind, and ran foul of the bows of the '<i>Pera</i>', much
damage being done to both ships . . . This prevented any further
sailing for some days, and indeed had God not specially looked
after them, both yachts would have gone ashore.<br>
<br>
"On the 23<i>rd</i>, good weather, and the Council having been
convened once more, I proposed to try every possible means to get
the '<i>Aernem</i>' into sailing trim again and in the first
place another rudder so as not to delay the voyage, but there was
absolutely no means of doing this because in neither of the
yachts were there any spare rudders or old ones which could be
cut down. Prevented thus from making a proper job of it, it was
finally resolved (to expedite the voyage and not have the yacht
lagging behind) that with the materials available a rudder should
be constructed Javanese or Chinese fashion. For this purpose the
<i>Pera</i> will have to give up her main topmast, the rest of
the required wood to be fetched from the land, and we shall stay
here until the rudder has been made.<br>
<br>
"On the 24<i>th</i> (while the rudder was being made) the
subcargo, <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> with both the boats,

circumference and is surrounded by many boulders and rocks (on
which plenty of oysters grow). The soil is very good and suitable
for all sorts of plants and cereals. It carries, by our estimate,
upwards of too full-grown coco-nut trees, with many young ones
coming on, and also some bananas and oubis, with fresh water,
which comes trickling through the clay in small rills and may be
caught in pits dug for the purpose. There are also a great many
bats (vleermuijsjen) which live in the trees, for which reason in
the new chart we have given the island the name of <span class=

us. There were altogether 25 <span class="u">blacks</span>, who
had nothing with them but their weapons. They called out and made
signs that we should come on shore. We threw them some small
pieces of iron and coral, at which they showed great
satisfaction. Gold, silver, nutmegs and cloves, which were shown
to them, they paid little or no attention to, though they were
willing to accept them as presents. Their canoes are very
skilfully made out of a single piece of wood, and some are so
large that they will carry 20 or more blacks. Their paddles are
long, and they used them standing or sitting. The men are black
and tall and carry themselves well, with big and strong limbs and
curled hair like the Kaffirs, which some of them bind on the neck
with a knot, while others let it hang loose down to their waists.
They have little or no beard. Some of them have two, and others
three, slits through the nose, in which they carry tusks of
boars, or the 'teeth' of swordfish. They are stark naked and have
their privates enclosed in a conch-shell (which is fastened to
the waist with a piece of twine). They have no rings of gold,
silver, copper, tin or iron on their bodies, but occasionally
they have them of turtle-shell, from which it may be inferred
that their country yields no metals, nor any wood of value, being
all low and submersible land, as indeed we have found it to be.
There were also among them some not provided with paddles, but
wearing two strings of human teeth round their necks, and
excelling the others in ugliness, carrying on the left arm a
hammer, with a handle of wood, with at one end a black
conch-shell, the size of a fist, and at the other, by which it is
held, a three-sided bone not unlike a staghorn. For one of these
hammers they were offered a rug, coral (beads) and iron, which
were refused, though the savages were quite willing to barter one
for one of the boys, to whom they had taken a fancy. It seems
likely that those who carry the aforesaid hammers belong to the
nobility or military. The people are cunning and suspicious and
by no finesse <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> could they be
induced to come near enough to let us catch one or two with the
nooses which we had prepared for the purpose. They carried also
in their canoes some human thighbones, which they repeatedly held
up to us, but what they meant by this is unknown to us. At last
they asked for a rope to tow the yacht to land, but found it too
hard work and quickly paddled back to the land.</blockquote>

advisable to send off the boat of the <i>Pera</i> with 13 men and
the Steersman of the '<i>Aernem</i>' (victualled for 4 days) to
take soundings and follow the land, extending to ENE., for 7 or 8
miles. [<span class="u">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP

"On the 30<i>th</i>, the wind N., good weather, so that we also
sent the boat of the <i>Aernem</i> to take soundings in various
directions for 2 or 3 miles out from the yachts. At low water we
saw several sandbanks and reefs lying dry, to wit: ESE., SSW. and
W. In the afternoon the <i>Aernem</i>'s boat came back, having
found shoals in every direction for two miles out. Towards
evening the <i>Pera's</i> boat also returned, and from the
Steersman we learned that they had been about 8 miles E. by S.
and ESE. of the yachts, and at that distance had found very
shallow water, such as 7, 8, 9 and 10 feet, which continued for
more than a mile, the depth thereafter increasing to 2,
2&frac12;, 3, 5 and 7 fathoms; that the land stretched E. and E.
by N., being very low and muddy and overgrown with a tangle of
brushwood and wild trees.<br>
<br>
"On the 31<i>st</i>, the wind NNE., with rain. After midday I
went personally, with both boats, to one of the reefs, to see how
things were between the yachts and the land, which area had
fallen dry with the low tide. In the afternoon the skipper of the
<i>Pera</i> was commanded to take the boat, properly manned and
armed, to the land, in order to ascertain what could be done for
the service of our masters, and to parley with the people, and,
if practicable, get hold of one or two. Very late in the evening,
the boat returned, and we were informed by the skipper that,
although it was high water, they could not come nearer than a
pistol-shot to the land, owing to the mud and shoals, and that
the low and submersible land was full of brushwood and wild
trees.<br>
<br>
"<span class="u">Note</span>.&mdash;Having heard the
above-written reports regarding the shoals to the east, we are
sufficiently assured (to our great regret) that it is not
possible any longer to trace the land which we have followed so
far to the east. Having sailed into the shoal as into a trap, we
must get out the same way, trying one direction and another and
taking advantage of the ebb; and having attained deeper water,
first run south to the 16th degree, or even further, should it be
found advisable, and then turn the bow northward along the coast
of New Guinea, according to our previous resolution come to on
6th March. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> We were now, as

free as to touch the men's muskets and try to take them off their
shoulders, and in fact, wanted to take everything they thought
they might have use for. These being kept interested with iron
and beads, an opportunity was espied, and one of them was seized
by a string which he had round his neck and taken on board the
boat. The others who were on the beach made a great hubbub and
outcry, but those who were concealed in the bush remained there.
The said people are pitch black, thin in body, and stark naked,
with basket-work or nets round their heads. As regards their hair
and figure, they are like the blacks of the coast of Coromandel,
but they seem to be less cunning, bold and wicked than the blacks
at the west end of New Guinea. Their weapons, some of which we
are bringing with us, are assegais, shields, clubs and sticks
about 1&frac12; fathoms in length, and are not so formidable as
those we have seen among other blacks. As regards their manners
and policy, and the nature of the country, Your Worships will in
time perhaps be able to elicit some information from the captured
blacks, to whom I refer you. [This day's diary concludes with the

of them being hit and having fallen. Such of our people as
penetrated further inland observed many weapons, and brought some

question was submitted by me whether it would be advisable to
sail further south: that, after several speeches regarding the
difficulties which were to be expected, it was agreed that we
might get into a huge bight, and it is evident that hereabouts in
these climes in the east monsoons north winds prevail, just as
south [north?] of the line in the forenamed monsoons south winds
do, and so we might fall on a lee shore. On which considerations,
it was judged to be best for the interests of our Masters, and
was determined and resolved to <span class="u">turn back</span>,
and to follow the coast of New Guinea northward as far as it may
be practicable also to touch at various places and examine them
carefully, and then shape our course for Aru and Queij . . . It
was further proposed by me, and ultimately agreed to, to offer to
the boats' crews for each black captured on the land and brought
on board ten reals of eight, and that, to this end, the crews may
use greater care and diligence, so as to do our Masters signal
service, for which they might expect to reap due recognition.<br>

"On the 25<i>th</i>, the skipper of the <i>Pera</i> was ordered
to land, with both boats well manned and armed, and especially to
look out for fresh water, with which we are now very poorly
provided. About midday, the skipper returned and reported that he
had sunk pits at various places on shore, but could find no
water: also that they had seen 7 small huts on the beach, made of
hay, and 7 or 8 blacks, who would not stop to parley. In the
afternoon, I, personally, taking both boats, went up a salt inlet
for about half a mile [about 2&#8531; English
miles.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>], and then, with the
party, walked a good way into the land, which was under water
[salt water?&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] in many places,
recalling the Waterland in Holland, so that it may be presumed
that further into the interior there may be great lakes or
marshes. We also saw many footprints of men, and the tracks of
large dogs, going from south to north; and since by resolution it
has been determined to begin the return voyage from here, we
have, in default of stone, nailed to a tree a wooden tablet, on
which the following words were engraved:&mdash;' Anno 1623 den
24n April sijn hier aen gecomen twee jachten wegen de Hooge
Mogende Heeren Staten Gen'.' ['In the year 1623 the 24th April
hereto came two yachts on behalf of the High and Mighty Lords
States General.'] The addition of the aforesaid river is
denominated the <span class="u">Staten River</span> in the newly
made chart." [A marginal note reads:&mdash;" The Staten Revier is
in latitude 170&deg; 8'."&mdash;This was the latitude of the
anchorage.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>[<span class="a">Editorial Note</span>.&mdash;The exact
position of the inlet named the "<span class="a">Staten
Revier</span>" by the Commodore of the Expedition is open to
question&mdash;within certain narrow limits.</p>
<p>The position is not defined with sufficient accuracy by the
midday solar observation of 24th April.</p>
<p>On that date, the "<i>Pera</i>" sailed southward till midday,
close to the land, as indicated by the soundings, which had a
maximum of 4&frac12; fathoms. At noon, the sun was taken, and
gave the latitude 17&deg; 8' S. As soon as the latitude had been
calculated and noted, orders were given to let go the anchor, and
probably the anchorage was an (English) mile or two south of
17&deg; 8', and very near the beach. We may assume that it was 2
miles south of the noon position, or, say, 17&deg; 10',
<i>i.e</i>., 4 (English) miles north of Accident Inlet. The
"<i>Pera</i>," no doubt, waited some time for the arrival of the
"<i>Aernem</i>" (which always lagged behind), in order that the
officers of both ships might meet in "full council" on board the
"<i>Pera</i>." The question of sailing further south or turning
back having been discussed at some length, the latter course was
decided on, and by this time the afternoon was too far advanced
for a landing.</p>
<p>The skipper of the "<i>Pera</i>" was "ordered" to land on the
25th, and to look out for fresh water. He landed, there can be no
doubt, on the nearest beach, where he saw huts and a few natives,
and dug unsuccessfully for water. There is no indication whatever
that he landed at, or because he saw, any "revier" or inlet. He
returned to the "<i>Pera</i>" at noon.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the Commodore (Carstenszoon) took the two
boats and, having found a "salt inlet," rowed up for some
2&frac12; (English) miles. The probability is that he searched to
the south for an inlet, the coast-line to the north having
already been seen from the ship the day before. Assuming the
anchorage to have been 17&deg; 10', there were only 4 (English)
miles to go before falling in with <span class="a">Accident
Inlet</span>, in 17&deg; 12', one of the mouths of the Gilbert
River. It was this inlet, there is every reason to believe, which
was named the <span class="a">Staten Revier</span>. It would have
been 9 (English) miles from the anchorage to the nearest inlet to
the north, <i>viz.</i>, the (erroneously named) Van Diemen Revier
(17&deg; 3' S.), which is another mouth of the Gilbert, known
inland as the Smithburne River, and the 18 miles of rowing at
sea, added to 4&#8532; on the inlet, would have taken so much of
the afternoon that the landing party would not have had daylight
enough to do all that they did on shore.</p>
<p>There is no ground whatever, now that we have the information
furnished by the log of the "<i>Pera</i>," for continuing to hold
the belief embodied in Flinders' chart (1802) and all subsequent
official maps, that the "<i>Pera's</i>" Staten River runs into
the Gulf of Carpentaria between latitudes 15&deg; 24' and 15&deg;
30' S.</p>
<p>The party left the boat and walked some distance, over country
which was partly "under water"&mdash;presumably stagnant salt
water, lying in "claypans." Thereafter they scratched an
inscription on a wooden slab, which they nailed to a tree before
returning to the ship.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>

<blockquote class="inline">"O<small>N</small> the 26<i>th</i>
[April, 1623], as in this place there was no water (whereof there
was great need), as we could hold no parley with the savages, and
as nothing of importance could be done, set sail again, the wind
ENE., stiff breeze, course N. along the land. [<span class=
"u">See</span> <a href="#map-m">MAP M.</a>] At midday latitude
16&deg; 44'. In the evening anchored in 4 fathoms close under the
land. [<span class="u">See</span> <a href="#map-h">MAP

<br>
"<span class="u">Note</span>.&mdash;That the yacht
'<i>Aernem</i>,' because of its poor sailing qualities and the
small liking and inclination for the voyage which the skipper and
steersman had shown, had on various occasions and at different
times seriously delayed the voyage, for the <i>Pera</i> (which
was leaking badly and had to get more than 8,000 strokes of the
pump every 24 hours) was nevertheless obliged to seek and follow
her every day for I, 2 or more miles to leeward.<br>
<br>
"On the 27<i>th</i>, the wind E. by S., good weather, the skipper
of the '<i>Pera</i>' rowed ashore, with both boats, duly provided
for defence, to look for fresh water, and sunk several holes, in
which none was found; whereupon we set sail, course SE. by E.,
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> along the land. Midday latitude
16&deg; 30' wind W. by N. So we made for the land, two full hours
before sunset, with foresail only, so as not to outpace the
'<i>Aernem</i>' (which was a howitzer shot behind us), and in the
evening, in 3 fathoms, 1&frac12; miles from the land, hung out a
lantern, that the 'Aernem' might keep clear of us when dropping
anchor, but this proved useless, because it is quite clear that,
with deliberate malice and perversity, and contrary to the
instructions and resolution, she ran away from us and shaped a
course for Aru (to have a good time there); but that time will
show."</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) An obvious mistake, as (1) a SE. by E. course
would have run the ship ashore, (2) the coast here runs NNE. to
SSW., and (3) the "<i>Pera</i>" made thirty-eight or forty
minutes of northing between morning and noon.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>[The few particulars available regarding the subsequent
proceedings of the "<i>Aernem</i>" will be mentioned later
on.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"In the morning of the 28<i>th</i>,
the wind E. by S., lovely weather, the skipper landed here with
the boat, to look for water, and sunk several holes in the sand,
without finding any: therefore set sail, course NE. by N., in 2,
3, 4 and 5 fathoms, along the land, and had got 2&frac12; miles
[10 minutes] when a violent land wind drove us off the land, and
we anchored in 3 fathoms: and the <span class="u">blacks</span>
made on the land such a great fire and smoke that we could hardly
see the shore. In the night, in the first watch, again set sail,
and, having gained 3&frac12; miles NNE., anchored in 2
fathoms.<br>
<br>
"In the morning of the 29<i>th</i>, wind SE. good weather, course
NE. by E., ran 1&frac12; miles along the land, in 2&frac12; and 3
fathoms, and anchored in 2 fathoms, and here also, as before,
landed to look for water. Several pits were dug, a good way in
from the shore, and no fresh water was found. Here the
<span class="u">blacks</span> showed themselves at a distance,
but were too shy to parley, nor did we succeed in luring any
towards us by any sort of strategy. At noon, in the latitude of
16&deg; to', we passed an inlet which is named the <span class=
"u">Revier Nassau</span> in the chart, and having satisfied
ourselves [by landing or by observation from the
sea?&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] that nothing profitable
could be done here, set sail again, the wind E., course NNE.,
along the land, and in the evening anchored in 2&frac12;
fathoms."</blockquote>
<p>[<span class="a">Editorial Note</span>.&mdash;The inlet, in
lat. 16&deg; 10', named the <span class="a">Nassau</span> by
Carstenszoon was, no doubt, the mouth of the unnamed creek
between Leichhardt's "Rocky Creek" and the "Staaten River" of
modern land maps. The creek in question has been traced from east
to west through the pastoral blocks Rocky No. 2, Wynola No. 4 and
Wynola No. 3 for a distance of about 13 miles. It may be referred
to as the <span class="a">Nassau</span> <i>de jure</i>, to
distinguish it from the <span class="a">Nassau</span> <i>de
facto</i>, which falls into the Gulf in lat. 15&deg;55'. The
lower course of the Nassau <i>de facto</i> has been named the
Nassau from an erroneous identification of it with the Nassau
<i>de jure</i>, while its upper course is known as Dunbar Creek.
This creek or river is one of the mouths of Leichhardt's
<span class="a">Mitchell River</span>.</p>
<p>The Nassau <i>de jure</i> traverses the continuous deltas of
the Mitchell and the Staaten <i>de facto</i>, and in times of
high flood would probably be found to be connected with both
rivers, as in the whole of this coastal flat the mouths of the
large rivers anastomose in a manner which could only be
satisfactorily traced in flood seasons (when nobody goes there)
with the aid of a canoe. It is, perhaps, more likely that a canoe
survey would prove the Nassau <i>de jure</i> to be a trickle
emanating from the Mitchell River than from the Staten River
<i>de facto</i>.</p>
<p>Although it is quite clear that the inland rivers have, in
many cases, been erroneously identified with the "reviers," or
inlets, named by the Dutch navigators, a wholesale <span class=
"a">renaming</span> of the rivers would be <span class=
"a">impracticable</span> at the present day. The names of the
inland rivers have been irrevocably fixed by the fact that they
have entered into history, into literature, into official maps,
proclamations and other documents, and even into title deeds. In
the circumstances, all that can now be done is to distinguish
between the inlets named by the Dutch (<i>de jure</i>) and the
watercourses to which the Dutch names have been erroneously
applied in the first place, to be afterwards sanctioned by usage
(<i>de facto</i>). It must, however, be clearly understood that
the <i>de facto</i> names are not names conferred by the Dutch
navigators, but names given in compliment to
them.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"In the morning of the 30<i>th</i>,
the wind SE., steady weather, course NNE., in 3 fathoms, along
the land. At noon, latitude 15&deg; 39', and anchored in
2&frac12; fathoms, and here, as before, <span class=
"u">landed</span> with the boat to look for fresh water and try
to fall in with natives, and after diligently digging several
pits found nothing. Then set sail again and in the evening
anchored in &frac12; fathoms [say, 15&deg; 30'
S.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]. [<span class=

<br>
"<i>May</i>.&mdash;In the morning of the 1<i>st</i>, the wind E.,
and the skipper again went ashore with the boat, and in three
holes which were dug found fresh water (which forced its way
through the sand), and we did our best to take in a supply. About
400 paces north of the outermost hole sunk was a little lake
(lagoon) with fresh water, but the water collected in the pits
was thought to be better.<br>
<br>
"In the morning of the 2<i>nd</i>, the wind ENE., and later in
the day SW., continued taking in water.<br>
<br>
"On the 3<i>rd</i>, continued taking in water as before, the wind
NE., and about midday SW., and I <span class="u">landed</span>
personally with 10 musketeers and went a good way into the thick
bush, without meeting any human beings. The land here is low and
flat, the same as hitherto, and continues so as far as 15&deg;
20', <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> but very dry and barren,
for during all the time we have been ashore here and have
explored the same and examined it to the best of our ability, we
did not see a single fruit-bearing tree nor anything that man
could make use of. There are no mountains or heights, so that it
may safely be presumed that there are no metals, nor any valuable
timbers, such as sandalwood, aloe or calumba, and in our judgment
this is the dryest and barrenest region that could be found in
the world. And even the men are more miserable and unsightly than
any I have seen in my age and time. Here they use no implements,
large or small, which results from the scarcity of large trees,
of which there is not one on the whole coast. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> This is near the place we were at
<b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> on the voyage out on Easter Day,
16th April, and we have, in the newly made chart, called it the
<span class="u">waterplaets</span> (Watering-place). At this
place, in the more sheltered localities, are fine and
good-looking sandy beaches, with delicate fish." [A marginal note
reads: "De Waterplaats leijdt op de hoochte van 15 gr., 30
minuten." Van Dijk and Heeres agree in this.]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) "Leijt op de hoochte van 15 gr. 20 min." Here the
verb employed is obviously "leiden," "to lead
to."&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) This sentence is obscurely expressed in the
original, but I think I have got the drift of it. Mr. Stoffel
translates it: "As there are no large trees anywhere on this
coast, they have no boats or canoes, whether large or
small."&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[3) They did not land on the 16th, but on the
following day, after a few hours' run in the afternoon, the
anchor was dropped, on the failing of the wind, "towards
evening," and Carstenszoon went ashore, and remarked on the flat,
good-looking land, with few trees. The probability is that,
writing on 3rd May, he inadvertently referred to the landing as
having taken place on the 16th instead of the 17th
April.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>[<span class="a">Editorial Note</span>.&mdash;In the marginal
note, the verb is evidently "liegen," "to lie." Writers of the
early seventeenth century were trammelled by no canons of
spelling. in the text, the writer meant to convey that the dry
and barren country he described extended from the Watering-place
to 15&deg; 20' (his knowledge of its extent having been derived
from the observations made on the outward voyage), and in the
marginal note he estimates the position of the Watering-place as
15&deg; 30', or 10 minutes south of the place touched at on 16th
(correctly, 17th) April. Accepting this as correct, the
Watering-place was about 8 English miles SSW. of Angeram Mission
Station, at the mouth of Topsy Creek.&mdash;<span class=

The <span class="u">blacks</span> came towards us offensively
with their weapons, but afterwards took to flight. Then our party
walked some way inland, and found, leaning against trees,.
specimens of their weapons, such as assegais and callaways, which
we did not disturb, except that we tied pieces of iron and beads
to them to attract the blacks, of which, however, they took
little notice, but, in the course of several advances, they
insolently held up their shields and launched them at the
muskets. These men, like all the others, are lank and meagre of
body, and quite naked, but malignant and cruel by nature. [Cape

strictly ordered to treat the <span class="u">blacks</span> well
and attract them with iron and beads and capture one while they
were engaged with these things. At noon, when they returned, we
were given to understand that on their arrival upwards of 100
blacks, with their weapons, had collected on the strand and in a
very hostile mood sought to prevent the landing; that a musket
shot was fired (to frighten them), whereupon they fled and
retreated into the bush, whence they tried every method and trick
to surprise and overpower our men. In features and build these
people are the same as those we have seen before, pitch black and
quite naked, but some of them had their faces painted red and
others white, with feathers stuck through their noses. Set sail
at noon, wind E., course N., along the land, being then in
latitude 13&deg; 20'. [West of mouth of <span class="u">Archer

"In the morning of the 8<i>th</i>, wind ESE., good weather, and I
<span class="u">landed</span> personally with 10 musketeers. We
saw numerous footprints of men and tracks of dogs (going from
south to north). We therefore spent some considerable time in
following the said footprints, which took us to a river, where we
plucked very delicate vegetables or pot herbs. When we had got
into the boat again, the <span class="u">blacks</span> emerged
with their weapons from two different points of the bush and came
out on the strand. There we enticed them with iron and beads
which we held out, till we got close to them, and one of them,
who had dropped his weapon, was seized round the waist by the
skipper, and then the quartermaster threw a noose round his neck,
by which he was dragged to the boat. The others, seeing this,
tried to help the captive, furiously throwing their assegais, so
that, in our defence, one of them was shot dead, and the others
ran away, upon which we embarked without further delay. These men
are, like all the others, pitch black and quite naked, with a
braided net on their head. Their weapons are assegais, callaways
and shields. Beyond this, we cannot give any account of their
manners or their ceremonies, or of how the land is populated, on
which points we could throw no light, with the few opportunities
which we had for exploration or examination. As to what relates
thereto, Your Worships may in time, please God 1 get something
out of the captive, to whom I refer you. The above-named river
lies in latitude 13&deg; 7' and is entitled the <span class=
"u">Revier Coen</span> in the the chart. In the afternoon, the
wind W. Set sail, course N., along the land, and in the evening
anchored in 3 fathoms." [<span class="u">Marginal
Note</span>.-"The Revier Coen lies in lat. 13&deg;
7'."]</blockquote>
<p>[<span class="a">Editorial Note</span>.&mdash;It is quite
clear from the narrative that the "<i>Pera</i>" anchored on 7th
May in lat. 13&deg; 7', and that on the following morning a party
landed, probably on a beach, and without having observed any
inlet, but having found human footprints, followed them north to
a river which they named the <span class="a">Coen</span> (the
<span class="a">Coen</span>, <i>de jure</i>). <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> Nothing is said as to whether the water
was fresh or salt, the only observation made being that the
neighbourhood yielded esculent herbs (pigweed). There cannot be a
river of any importance in this locality, as the Ward River,
running from north to south, a few miles to the east, restricts
the possible catchment area of the Coen within very narrow
limits.</p>
<blockquote>[1) In the course of the "<i>Investigator's</i>"
survey, <span class="u">Flinders</span> landed on 7th November,
1802, at an inlet in 12&deg; 13' S., which he described in his
Chart as "<span class="u">Inlet, Probably Coen R. Of The Old
Charts</span>." It was a most unfortunate misidentification,
which has given rise to much confusion. What Flinders took to be
the "<span class="u">Coen River</span> of the old charts" is now
charted as the <span class="u">Pennefather River</span>, but had
been called the Prince Revier by Tasman in. 1644.]</blockquote>
<p>The name Coen has been irrevocably attached to a river (the
<span class="u">Coen</span>, <i>de facto</i>) rising near the
Pacific coast in lat. 13&deg; 50' and which falls into the still
larger Archer River, which empties into the Gulf of Carpentaria
in 13&deg; 20'. <span class="a">Gold</span> was found in this
river in 1876, by a party of prospectors, who erroneously
identified it with Carstenszoon's Coen River. The establishment
of a township named Coen, with a post and telegraph office,
followed in due course. As it had become impossible to confer a
new name on the Coen, <i>de facto</i>, the Survey Office has
begun to call the river of the goldfield the <span class=
"a">South Coen</span>, to distinguish it from the <span class=
"a">Coen</span>, <i>de jure</i>, which it would be an historical
injustice to omit from the map. It remains to be seen whether the
name of South Coen will receive popular recognition.</p>
<p>It is quite clear that the landing party had for their walk
north and south only the time between daylight and noon, when
they returned to the "<i>Pera</i>," less the time taken by
(breakfast?), rowing ashore, tracking the footprints, gathering
herbs, fighting</p>
<p>and rowing to the ship. It was just after noon when they came
alongside, and the latitude of the anchorage (13&deg; 7' S.)
having been taken, the anchor was lifted, and the "<i>Pera</i>
"resumed her northward voyage. I conclude that they walked about
four miles north, and the same distance back,. which would put
the <span class="a">Coen River</span> in 13&deg; 4' S. latitude.
MR. N. HEY, of the Mapoon Mission, informs me that <i>precisely
in this position</i> is a creek, which is the only watercourse
between False Pera Head (12&deg; 58' S.), and the mouth of Ina
Creek (13&deg; 12' S.). This must be <span class=
"a">Carstenszoon's Coen Revier</span>. The subject is discussed
in greater detail in the chapters devoted to Mr. J. T. Embley's
Explorations and Surveys and Missionary Explorations.</p>
<p>It may be noted here that Flinders' "Chart of Terra
Australis," 1802-3 (Admiralty Chart No. 1043), gives the name of
"False Pera Head" to a small promontory in lat. 13&deg; 7', while
on Sheet 20D of the modern 4-mile map of Queensland issued by the
Department of Lands the name is given to a promontory about 3
minutes south of Pera Head, which is in 12&deg; 55'. Although I
am not aware on what ground the change was made, I accept it as
authoritative, especially as what Flinders called False Pera Head
had been named <span class="a">Rijder's Hoek</span> in 1756 by
<span class="a">Jean Etienne Gonzal</span>.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p><span class="a">Note in the Diary</span>.&mdash;" Wherever we
have landed, we have treated the blacks or savages with especial
kindness by every means in our power, such as offering them
presents of iron, beads and cloth, so as by this pretence to win
their friendship and be allowed to penetrate some distance inland
and make a reliable report on what we saw. But, notwithstanding
all this care and fair seeming, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
the blacks everywhere met us with the most marked hostility, so
that in most places our landings were attended with great peril.
Thus, and for various other reasons afterwards to be mentioned,
it has not been possible to learn how Nova Guinea is populated,
what sort of people and soil there are, what towns, what
inhabited villages, what distribution of wealth, what religion,
what politics, what preparation for war, what waters, what
shipping, what raw materials, what manufactures, or what ores of
gold, silver, tin, iron, lead, copper or quicksilver are to be
had. In the first place, in any further landings, we should have
to look out for rain which, at times when need for muskets might
arise, would be very damaging to them, whereas the weapons of the
savages would not be injuriously affected. Secondly, the paths
and roads, which are unknown to us, would have to be surveyed.
Thirdly, we might easily, seeing the number of the blacks, be
surrounded and cut off from the boats, and then the boats' crews
which we always employed in the landings, but who could not be
depended upon in the use of their weapons, would have been in
danger. If, on the other hand, we could make use of trained and
proved soldiers (who are really necessary on such an expedition),
we might make good reddings and scourings. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> Still, in spite of all these obstacles
and difficulties, we have spared neither labour, trouble nor
risk, with the means at our command, to inquire into everything,
for our honour and reputation, and that nothing may pass
unmarked, the following are the results of our
investigations:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>[1) This is a very subjective way of putting
it!&mdash;<i>Note by Heeres.</i>]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) "Reddinge ende scheuringh," pickings of odds and
ends. The old English verb "to redd" means to clean up. Stoffel's
free rendering of the phrase is "we might have done a good deal
of useful work."&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>"The land between 13&deg; and 17&deg; 8' is a dry and barren
tract, without any fruit trees or anything that man could make
use of. It is low and flat, without mountains or heights,
overgrown in many places with scrub and stunted timber, with
little fresh water and what there is must be collected in holes
dug for the purpose. There is also an entire absence of capes or
inlets, except for a few bights not sheltered from the sea winds.
It extends mainly N. by E. and S. by W., with clay- and
sand-bottomed shoals, with numerous salt inlets extending into
the interior, across which the natives ferry their women and
children by means of dry logs or boughs of trees. The men are in
general utter barbarians and built very much alike as to shape
and features, pitch black and stark naked, with a braided net on
head or neck for keeping their food in, the same consisting, so
far as we could make out, of roots which they dig out of the
earth, very evil-smelling. Their residences or dwelling-places
appeared to us to be on the beaches during the easterly monsoons,
as there we saw numerous huts made of hay. We also saw many dogs,
herons and water curlews and other wild fowl, and also delicate
fish, which may easily be caught with a seine net. They have
absolutely no acquaintance with gold, silver, tin, iron, lead or
copper, nor even with nutmegs, cloves or pepper, all of which we
repeatedly showed them without their evincing any sign of
recognising or setting any value on the same. From all of which,
taken together with the rest of our observations, it may safely
be concluded that they are poor and miserable creatures who prize
most such things as iron and beads. Their weapons are shields,
assegais and callaways, of the length of I+ fathoms, made of
light wood and cane, some with fish-bones and others with human
bones fastened to them. As we discovered, they are particularly
expert in throwing them by means of a stick half a fathom in
length, on which a hook is bound, so as to catch the upper part
of the callaway or assegai."</p>

<p>[<span class="a">Editorial Note</span>.&mdash;The latitude of

follows that the midday <span class="a">anchorage</span> of 9th
May was still <span class="a">south</span> of <span class=

would bring the "<i>Pera</i>" to what is now known as

Hey</span> (in a letter dated 5th February, 1919), there is only,
in wet weather, a <span class="a">small runnel of fresh
water</span>, which could not be called a creek. It is, I have no
doubt, the "<span class="a">waterplaets</span>" of 9th May, 1623,
regarding which <span class="a">Mr. J. T. Embley</span> has given
me the following additional particulars, in a letter dated 10th
August, 1916: "The Waterplaets is at Pera Head. These headlands
are about 80 feet high and consist of soft reddish and whitish
sandstone. The red is most conspicuous, as being uppermost, and
gives rise to the expression low reddish cliffs 'as in the sea
chart and land maps. After the wet season&mdash;April and
May&mdash;small <span class="a">soakages of fresh water</span>
may be noticed oozing out from the base, and it is this which
must have given rise to the <span class=
"a">waterplaets</span>.'"]</p>

Carstenszoon, "wind SW., course as before. From the aforesaid
watering-place to a high hook, or cape [<span class="u">Duyfken

<br>
<p>[<span class="a">Editorial Note</span>.&mdash;This night
anchorage was in <span class="a">Albatross Bay</span>, and,
judging by the course on which next day's journey had to be
begun, so as to clear Duyfken Point, outside of the shoals which
guard the mouths of the Embley and Mission Rivers. It is singular
that Carstenszoon gave no name to the bay, nor to its two
"horns," Pera Head and Duyfken Point. On 26th April, 1756,
Lavienne Lodowijk van Asschens, in charge of the "<i>Buijs</i>,"
recognised the bay as that which <span class="a">Tasman</span>,
in 1644, had named <span class="a">Vliegebaaij</span>, and on
31st May, 1756, Lieut. Jean Etienne Gonzal, commanding the
"<i>Rijder</i>," called it <span class="a">Mosselbaaij</span>.
The name now current was that of the Queensland Government's
steamer "<i>Albatross</i>," which used to patrol Torres Strait
during the administration of the Hon. John
Douglas.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] [<span class=

whereupon we landed again and threw them some pieces of iron,

distrustful, for, though pieces of iron and other things were
thrown to them, they would not stop to parley, but tried every
trick with the object of wounding and capturing one of our men.
This compelled us to fire one or two shots to frighten them, one
of them being hit in the breast and carried to the boat, while
all the others retired into the sand dunes. In their wretched
huts on the beach we found nothing but a four-edged assegai, two
or three little stones, and some human bones, with which they
make and scrape their weapons. We also found a quantity of resin
and a piece of metal, which the wounded man had in his net, and
which had probably been got from the '<i>Duyfken's</i>' men. At
last, there being nothing more to be done here, we turned back to
go aboard the ship, the wounded man dying on the
way."</blockquote>
<p>[<span class="a">Editorial Note</span>.&mdash;We are now
confronted with the most difficult problem raised by the
narrative of the "<i>Pera's</i>" eventful voyage, <i>viz.</i>,
the identification of the "reviers" Batavia and Carpentier.</p>
<p>It will be readily conceded that the diary for 11th May, 1623,
proves that the navigators of the "<i>Pera</i>" were familiar
with the charts of the "<i>Duyfken</i>," which were undoubtedly
then extant. They probably carried copies with them, and would
naturally make them their daily study.</p>
<p>Our difficulties begin with the discovery of the "Chart by the
Upper Steersman Arend Martensz(oon) <span class="a">de
Leeuw</span>, who took part in the Voyage," in the State archives
at the Hague. The chart has no date, but it may be taken for
granted that it was compiled prior to 1630, since in that year,
Kepler and Eekerbrecht's map followed de Leeuw's in naming the
Carpentier Revier the Batavia. It is not stated to what voyage
reference is made in the title of de Leeuw's chart, but there can
be no doubt that the "<i>Pera's</i>" voyage is indicated. The
chart is reproduced in <i>Remarkable Maps</i>, II, 5, and (on a
reduced scale) by Heeres (p. 46).</p>
<p>I offer the following as a fair and unbiassed paraphrase of
the diary of 11th May, 1623:&mdash;</p>
<p>In the morning of the 11th, we left the anchorage at 12&deg;
5', and, with good weather and a favourable wind (ESE.), sailed
NNE. along the land. Observed the sun at noon and made the
latitude 11&deg; 48'. North of this latitude, and in the
afternoon, having passed a large inlet, which we identified as
that where the <i>Duyfken</i>' had one of her men killed, and
which we named the <span class="a">Revier de Carpentier</span>
(Carpentier Inlet), we dropped the anchor. We landed here next
morning . . ."</p>
<p>The mouth of a river, now known as the <span class=
"a">Skardon</span>, enters the Gulf in 11&deg; 45', and
everything points to this having been the inlet which
Carstenszoon named the Carpentier.</p>
<p>It is very strange that the "<i>Pera</i>" should have passed,
without remark, the entrance to <span class="a">Port
Musgrave</span>, which is practically the estuary of the great
river which Tasman was the first to notice in 1644 and to which
Asschens, in 1756, gave the name of <span class=
"a">Batavia</span>, no doubt believing it to be de Leeuw's
Batavia, that is to say, Carstenszoon's Carpentier. According to
Mr. J. T. Embley, who is very familiar with the aspect of this
portion of the coast, the entrance to Port Musgrave could hardly
be missed by a ship passing in daylight and fine weather. Perhaps
it was not unobserved by the officers of the "<i>Pera</i>," but
the true explanation of their silence regarding it may lie in
their anxiety to make northing, coupled with the fact that they
were making good progress and the consideration that they passed
the entrance too early in the day to be willing to stop. On the
other hand, the identification, later in the day, of the inlet
which had been the scene of the "<i>Duyfken's</i>" mishap formed
a perfectly sound reason for a halt with the object of making
observations on shore.</p>
<p>Returning to <span class="a">de Leeuw's chart</span>: it
bears, to my thinking, internal evidence of having been
constructed&mdash;perhaps by request&mdash;some time after the
conclusion of the voyage, and from memory, possibly with the aid
of notes, by a man who had not, at the time, access to the ship's
log or diary, or to the authentic newly made chart so often
referred to therein. The following table shows, by means of
parallel columns, how imperfect was de Leeuw's knowledge (or
recollection) of the positions of the various inlets referred to
in the log.</p>

<p>The watering-place at <span class="a">Pera Head</span>, north
of the Coen River, to which de Leeuw assigned the latitude of
13&deg; 5' (correctly, 12&deg; 55') is one of the localities
where de Leeuw and the "<i>Pera's</i>" log evidently mean the
same thing. North of this watering-place de Leeuw shows a bay, at
the head of which his supposed "<span class="a">Revier De
Batavia</span> falls in. This bay (<span class="a">Albatross
Bay</span>) is now known to be entered by the Embley and Mission,
both considerable rivers, and although de Leeuw may have been
justified in conjecturing that at least one river would enter the
bay, it is more than doubtful if he could see either the Embley
or the Mission. In any case, he had no authority to name this
hypothetical river, or any other.</p>
<p>The captain of the "<i>Pera</i>" had his authority very much
curtailed by the "Full Council," and even Carstenszoon had to bow
to its decisions. It is quite possible that de Leeuw's memory,
when he made his sketch-chart, may have recalled a discussion in
the Council in the course of which the name Batavia was
suggested, but the log leaves no room for doubt that the name
Carpentier was finally adopted for the inlet identified with the
"<i>Duyfken's</i>" misfortune.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, de Leeuw "got the ear" of cartographers, so that
the name of Batavia appeared on Dutch maps long before Asschens
gave that name (in 1756) to the river which enters the Gulf at
Port Musgrave.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>

short sail] I, personally, rowed to the land, with the skipper
and to musketeers, and saw many human footprints and tracks of
dogs (going southwards) and also a very fine fresh water river
which runs out into the sea, whence water could conveniently be
taken by boats or pinnaces, and which lies in 10&deg; 50'
latitude, and is noted in the chart as <span class="u">de
waterplaets</span> (the Watering-place). The land is high and
duny (sand dunes), with reefs in front of the sandy beach. Seeing
that no service could be done, or profit made, here, we returned
to the yacht (which was standing by with shortened sail)."
[<span class="u">See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAPS B</a> AND
<a href="#map-a">A.</a>]</blockquote>
<p>[<span class="a">Editorial Note</span>.&mdash;There is no
reason to question the correctness of the observation for
latitude (11&deg; 16') made at noon on 13th May. The anchorage
for that night, which was "near" an inlet from which fresh water
was running out to sea, and which was named <span class="a">van
Spult</span>, is another matter. The "<i>Pera</i>" dropped her
anchor in the evening of the 13th, and sailed before daylight of
the 14th, so that there was no opportunity for a solar
observation.</p>
<p>The latitude attributed to the anchorage at the Van Spult
Inlet must therefore have been more or less of a guess based upon
dead reckoning. The guess made by the navigators was 10&deg; 50'.
Carstenszoon must have overestimated the distance sailed in the
afternoon of the 13th. Had the "<i>Pera</i>" reached the latitude
of 10&deg; 50', Barn Island and Red Island could not have escaped
observation, and indeed the high land of Prince of Wales Island
must have appeared a much more striking object than the low-lying
mainland. In view of what took place on the following day (14th
May), the probability is that the observed inlet was where the
modern chart shows a breach in the coast-line, in 10&deg; 59'.
The Van Spult is, therefore, probably a mouth of the <span class=
"a">Jardine River</span>. The principal channel of that river
(which has been carefully surveyed almost to its head),
discharges into the Gulf in 10&deg; 54', and the Jardine
Brothers, in 1865, found the tide to flow up it for about 6
miles, even in a very wet season. It is quite possible, however,
that another mouth, that named the Van Spult, carries fresh water
down to the beach. The point could easily be settled, even by a
party on foot, as the inlet is, apparently, not more than 10
miles west of Jardine's crossing of the river at his camp 87.
After the landing party rejoined the "<i>Pera</i>" on 14th May,
1623, the narrative continues as follows.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Towards evening [14<i>th May</i>], we
were about one mile from three little islands, of which the
southmost was the largest [<span class="u">Woody</span> and
<span class="u">Wallis Islands</span>] and some 5 miles [20
minutes] to the north, by our estimate, was mountainous land
[<span class="u">Prince of Wales Island</span>], which, however,
it was impossible to approach by reason of shoals; for in almost
every direction in which we took soundings very shallow water was
found, and we sailed for a long time over 5, 4, 3, 2&frac12;, 2
and 1&frac12; fathoms, or even less, and at last were obliged to
anchor in fathoms, without knowing where to look for greater or
less depths. After sunset, therefore, we sent out the boat to
take soundings, and water deeper than 2, 3 and 4&frac12; fathoms
was found, to which, very well pleased, we brought the yacht, and
anchored in 8 fathoms, thanking God Almighty for His unspeakable
grace and mercy on this occasion, as on all others.<br>
<br>
"In the morning of the 15<i>th</i>, the wind SE., good weather,
thereupon set sail, course W., which took us into shallower
water, such as 2, 2&frac12;. and 3 fathoms; altered course to
SW., where we had 3&frac12;, 4, 5 and 6 fathoms, or more. Lost
sight of the land, which, because of the shoals, reefs and banks,
as well as of the easterly winds, it was not possible to reach
and follow further. This was agreed to, and it was
resolved&mdash;to avoid all the obvious dangers which would be
encountered if we continued to coast the land any longer&mdash;to
<span class="u">turn back</span> and, firstly to shape our course
for the Yleermuis Eijlant. We therefore stood out to sea,
westwards, in 9&frac12; fathoms and upwards, and, keeping west,
made 17 miles [68 minutes] in 24 hours, finding no bottom in 27
fathoms.<br>
<br>
"<span class="u">Note</span>.&mdash;That in our landings between
13&deg; and 11&deg;, we only saw blacks or savages twice, and
that they received us with even greater hostility than had the
men further south; also that they have some knowledge of muskets,

the men of the '<i>Duyfken</i>,' who landed here in the year
1606.]<br>

<p>N<small>O</small> reader of Carstenszoon's narrative can fail
to observe that although the "<i>Aernem</i>" was inferior in
sailing qualities to her consort, the "<i>Pera</i>," she was
expected to keep up with her, and that her failure to do so was
the cause of much friction between the officers of the two
ships.</p>
<p>Before the expedition left the shores of <span class="a">New
Guinea</span> proper, and approximately in 4&deg; 20' S. lat.,
the "<i>Aernem</i>" met with a <span class="a">disaster</span>
which is related by Carstenszoon under date 11th February,
1623:-</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The same day the skipper of the yacht
"<i>Aernem</i>," <span class="u">Dirck Meliszoon</span>, without
the knowledge of myself or of the supercargo or first mate of the
said yacht, unadvisedly rowed to the open beach in the boat, with
fifteen persons, officers and hands, with only four muskets, with
the object of fishing. There was great disorder in landing, the
men running off in different directions, and presently the
<span class="u">blacks</span> issued savagely from the bush and,
to begin with, <span class="u">seized</span> an assistant named
<span class="u">Jan Willens(zoon) van den Briel</span>, who was
unarmed, and dragged him away from the others, and so forth,
without our people having been able to resist or shoot. Next,
with arrows, callaways and oars which they took out of the boat,
they <span class="u">slew</span> no less than <span class=
"u">nine</span> of our men and <span class="u">wounded</span> the
remaining <span class="u">seven</span> (among them the
<span class="u">skipper</span>, who was the first to run away),
who by a miracle, and by means of the boat and a single oar,
returned to the ship in a sorry plight, the skipper loudly
lamenting his gross imprudence and begging forgiveness for the
fault he had committed."</blockquote>
<p>He <span class="a">died</span> next day, and was succeeded by
<span class="a">Willem Joosten van Coolsteerdt</span>, second
mate of the "<i>Pera</i>."</p>
<p>The return voyage had barely commenced when the
"<i>Aernem</i>" once more lagged behind (27th April, 1623) before
dark, and the "<i>Pera</i>" saw her no more. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-h">MAP H.</a>) The latter was then
at anchor off the coast of the Cape York Peninsula, in about
16&deg; 25' S. lat. Carstenszoon, in his diary, accuses the
"<i>Aernem</i>" of deliberate desertion because her men had no
liking for the business, and he believed they desired to have "a
good time" at Aru, where, apparently, the natives were kind. It
is, indeed, more than likely that the "<i>Aernem's</i>"
complement were heartily tired of the voyage, which brought them
daily recrimination on account of the shortcomings of their
vessel, for which they were not to blame. They had hardships
enough, saw no chance of profit for themselves and were condemned
to play the unenviable part of second fiddle. On the other hand,
it is probable that the "jury" rudder was lost, in which case
(the wind being SE. by E.), the ship would have to stand out to
sea, and in course of time some other substitute for a rudder
would have to be rigged up. At any rate, <span class="a">Isack de
Brune</span>, Governor of <span class="a">Banda</span>, reported
to the Governor-General, <span class="a">Pieter de
Carpentier</span>, that on 14th May a ship was sighted, which
proved to be the "<i>Aernem</i>," and that she had lost her
rudder on the 13th.</p>
<p>No report of the "<i>Aernem</i>'s" voyage is known to exist,
and with her parting from the "<i>Pera</i>" she passes out of the
region with which we are dealing. <span class="a">Heeres</span>,
who has thoroughly investigated the whole of the available
documentary evidence, comes to the conclusion that the first land
she saw was <span class="a">Groote Eyland</span> and that
afterwards she skirted the north-western horn of the Gulf of
Carpentaria, forming the northern portion (now known as
<span class="a">Arnhem Land</span>) of the "Northern Territory"
of Australia.</p>

<p>O<small>F</small> all her gallant sailors there is none of
whom Holland has more reason to be proud than of <span class=
"a">Abel Janszoon Tasman</span>. In many voyages of discovery he
rendered signal services to his country. Only two of these,
however, come within the scope of our inquiry.</p>
<p>Prior to the first of these voyages, the western and a portion
of the southern shores of Australia were already known, but the
theory that the South Land formed part of a great antarctic
continent had yet to be disproved. In 1642-3, Tasman demonstrated
the <span class="a">Insularity of "New Holland"</span> by sailing
round it, although at a great distance, with Batavia as his
starting- and finishing-post. He touched <span class=
"a">Tasmania</span> (named by him Van Diemen's Land) and rounded
its southern end, believing it to be the southern limit of the
South Land, now to be called New Holland. Thence he sailed
eastward to <span class="a">New Zealand</span>, which he coasted
to the north. He returned to Batavia <i>via</i> the Friendly
Islands, Fiji and the north coast of <span class="a">New
Guinea</span>, which he believed to be the northmost part of New
Holland. Tasman's journal is extant and relates, with painstaking
industry, the minutest details of his remarkable voyage.</p>
<p>The voyage which mainly concerns us is that of 1644. The
<span class="a">Instructions</span> <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> of the Governor-General and Council of
the Dutch East India Company were drawn up at Batavia on 13th
January, 1644, and were signed by Antonie Van Diemen, Cornelis
Van Der Lijn (Director-General), Joan Maetsuijker, Justus
Schouten ("Councillor-Extraordinary to the present assembly"),
Salomon Sweers, and Pieter Metschagh (Secretary).</p>

<p>From the instructions and a list of members of the Full
Council, we gather how each of the ships was
officered:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>Limmen</i>". Commander and Skipper, Abel Janszoon Tasman.
Assistant Skipper, Pilot-Major Francois Jacobszoon Visscher.
Mate, Crin Hendrikszoon. Trader (Assistant Supercargo), Counsel
and Secretary, Anthonio Blauw.</p>
<p>"<i>Zeemeeuw</i>." Skipper, Dirck Corneliszoon Haen.
Supercargo, Isaac Gilesemans. Mate, Carsten Jeuraenszoon.</p>
<p>"Bracq." Skipper, Jasper Janszoon Koos. Mate,. Cornelis
Robel.</p>
<p>When matters concerning navigation were to be discussed in the
<span class="a">Full Council</span>, the second mates were to be
called in. Councils of individual ships were to consist of the
officers, to whom were to be added the Assistant Supercargoes or
book-keepers and the master-boatswains. The minutes of the Full
Council were to be made out in triplicate.</p>
<p>The fleet left <span class="a">Batavia</span> on 30th January,
and returned to that port on 10th August, 1644.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Sailing Orders</span> began with a
preamble recapitulating the achievements of previous navigators
in the region to be visited, and to this narrative we are
indebted, <i>inter alia</i>, in default of the "<i>Duyfken's</i>"
journal and charts, for some of our scanty information regarding
her disastrous pioneering voyage along the coast of the Cape York
Peninsula.</p>
<p>The orders were first to go to Banda and there to take in
water and firewood and to obtain such information regarding "New
Guinea" as could be supplied by the Vice-Governor, who, it was
said, was likely to have a copy of <span class="a">Carstenszoon's
Journal</span> of the "<i>Pera</i>" and <i>Aernem</i>"
expedition. This shows that, in 1644, the journal was not
obtainable in Batavia; and it may be assumed that the
"<i>Pera's</i>" chart was also missing. Tasman, therefore, unless
he succeeded in obtaining copies in Banda, must have started on
his voyage of exploration without these documents which were so
essential to his success in identifying the localities visited
and charted by Carstenszoon.</p>
<p>After leaving Banda, Tasman was instructed to make for
<span class="a">False Cape</span>, on the New Guinea coast; to
follow the coast east to 9&deg; S. latitude; cautiously to clear
the shoals (the so-called "<span class="a">Drooge Bocht</span>,"
the entrance to <span class="a">Torres Strait</span>); to anchor
near the High Island (<span class="a">Prince of Wales
Island</span>) or the <span class="a">Speult River</span> and to
send the "<i>Bracq</i>" into the bight to make one more search
for the alleged (and actual) passage. Having settled this point,
he was to skirt the west coast of "New Guinea" southward to the
<span class="a">furthest known point</span>, about 17&deg; S.
latitude. Thence he was to follow the coast and connect the
coast-line charted by Carstenszoon with the "<span class="a">Van
Diemen's Land</span>" discovered by himself and supposed to be
the southern extremity of the "South Land." He was, however, to
carry out only as much of this programme as time would permit;
but, in any case, he was to be back in Batavia, <i>via</i> Sunda
Strait, "by June or July."</p>
<p>The expedition, as we have seen, returned to Batavia on 10th
August, and we are justified in assuming that the instructions
were obeyed, although the carrying out of the full programme was
impossible. As a matter of fact, Tasman had only followed the
Australian coast (already to some extent known) to the Tropic of
Capricorn when the prescribed time-limit compelled him to make
for Batavia. Considerable portions of the Australian coast west
of where the "<i>Pera</i>" turned back had already, however, been
discovered and more or less charted from twenty-eight to
twenty-one years before; so that Tasman's achievement consisted
of a demonstration of the <span class="a">continuity of the
land</span> from the 44 Drooge Bocht (Torres Strait) to the
Tropic of Capricorn. His contributions to cartography were
chiefly the southern and western shores of the <span class=
"a">Gulf of Carpentaria</span> and the coast-line from Melville
Island to the Tropic of Capricorn.</p>
<p>A clause in the instructions (perhaps mere routine) empowered
Tasman to take possession of new discoveries and to enter into
Treaties. There is nothing to show that either power was
exercised. The tone of contemporary official references to the
expedition gives the impression that the Dutch East India Company
regarded it as having been only moderately successful and as
having failed to add materially to the Company's assets. The
presumption is that Tasman did not claim to have discovered any
land of value or to have fallen in with any potentates with whom
it was worth his while to conclude alliances.</p>
<p>Before leaving Batavia, Tasman was supplied with a
<span class="a">specially prepared chart</span>, which, no doubt,
showed all that was known of the south coast of New Guinea (as we
know the island to-day) and the north, west and south coasts of
Australia. There is reason to believe that, as regards previous
exploration of the coast of the Cape York Peninsula, this chart
was very imperfect.</p>
<p>In a report under date 23rd December, 164, signed by Van
Dieman, Van der Lijn, Sweers, Crooq and Van Alpen (President),
representing the Governor and Council of the Dutch East India
Company, and addressed to "The Noble, Worshipful, Provident and
Very Discreet Gentlemen" (The Directors of the Company in
Holland), it is stated that Tasman's expedition, after leaving
Bantam on 29th February, 1644, "followed the coast-line, but
found <span class="a">no open channel</span> between the
half-known Nova Guinea and the known land of Eendracht or
Willem's River in 22&frac12;&deg; S. latitude and 119&deg;
longitude. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> They, however, found
a large, spacious <span class="a">bay or gulf</span>, as shown in
the annexed <span class="a">chart and journals</span>. Nor did
they make any profit by bartering, having only met with naked,
beach-roaming wretches, destitute of rice and not possessed of
any fruits worth mentioning, excessively poor and in many places
of a very malignant nature, as Your Worships may in great detail
gather from the <span class="a">Batavia Minutes</span>, in which
are recorded the courses kept and the incidents of the voyage,
under date 4th, 5th and 10th August last, at which time the said
Tasman returned to our port through Sunda Strait, from the
latitude and longitude aforesaid of the South Land (having
continually sailed in shallow water along the coast) . . . This
vast and hitherto unknown South Land has by the said Tasman been
sailed round in two voyages and is computed to comprise 2,000
miles of land, as shown by the delineation of the Charts, which
we subjoin for Your Worships' inspection."</p>
<blockquote>[1) Actually 113&deg; E. The Dutch of this period
reckoned longitude from the meridian of the Peak of Teneriffe,
which is 16&deg; 46' W. of Greenwich.]</blockquote>
<p>Whatever became of Tasman's journal, it has not come down to
us. There is, however, a <span class="a">chart</span>, on the
scale of 1 cm. to a degree of longitude, showing Tasman's routes
in 1642-3 and 1644, entitled "Company's New Netherlands. To the
east the large Land of Nova Guinea forming one land with the
first-known South Land, and all of it joined together, as may be
seen from the dotted course-line of the Yachts '<i>Limmen</i>'
and <i>Zeemeeuw</i>' and the Galiot '<i>Bracq</i>' anno 1644." A
further inscription says: "This Work has been put together out of
divers Writings, together with Personal Observations by Abel
Janszoon Tasman anno Domini 1644." The chart shows a continuous
New Guinea and Cape York Peninsula, with a shallow bight between.
<span class="a">Professor Heeres</span> in his great work, <i>The
Life of Tasman</i>, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> describes it
as having been "drawn-up immediately, after the (1644) expedition
and under the eye of Tasman himself." It may, indeed, be a copy
of the chart forwarded with the Report by the Governor-General
and Council at Batavia to the Directors in Holland. It was
reproduced by <span class="a">Jacob Swart</span> in his
<i>Journaal van de Reis nar het Onbekende Zuidland in den Jare
1642 door Abel Janszoon Tasman</i> (<i>Amsterdam</i>, 1860), and
<span class="a">Heeres</span>, in his <i>Life of Tasman</i> gives
a version of it, with the place-names and other inscriptions
translated into English.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The full title is: "<i>Abel Janszoon Tasman's
Journal of his Discovery of Van Diemen's Land and New Zealand in
1642, with Documents relating to his Exploration of Australia in
1644, being Photo-lithographic Fac-Similes of the Original
Manuscript in the Colonial Archives of the Hague, with an English
Translation and Fac-Similes of Original Maps; To which are added
Life and Labours of Abel Janszoon Tasman, by J. E. Heeres, LL.D.,
Professor at the Dutch Colonial Institute, Delft, and
Observations made with the Compass on Tasman's Voyage by Dr. W.
Van Bemmelen, Assistant Director of the Royal Meteorological
Institute, Utrecht</i>". <i>Amsterdam</i>, 1898.<br>
<br>
It is almost needless to say that the greater part of the facts
quoted in this chapter relating to Tasman's voyage are borrowed
from this exhaustive work, for which Professor Heeres is
peculiarly qualified not only because of the exceptional
opportunities enjoyed by him for obtaining access to the original
documents, but also because of his critical and judicial mind. He
is, however, not at all responsible for the views and comments
herein. I may claim, perhaps, better opportunities for access to
Australian documents and charts.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>The names along the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula in
the charts reproduced by Swart and Heeres are as in Column I of
the table below, and the latitudes as in Columns II and III; but
the small scale of the map, together with a "personal equation"
resulting from mechanical differences in drawing between the two
maps, makes it impossible, in some cases, to be certain of the
positions indicated within a few minutes of latitude.</p>

<p>It would be of great assistance to know whether or not Tasman
succeeded in getting Carstenszoon's diary and charts from the
Vice-Governor at Banda. I am inclined to think that he left Banda
without these important documents <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> and had to rely entirely on the general
chart with which he was furnished at Batavia. Had he been able to
refer to the original report and chart, he would surely have
adopted for the northmost "Watering-place" at which he touched,
Carstenszoon's name of "Van Spult Revier." The question arises,
was the sketch-chart made by de Leeuw, mate of the "<i>Pera</i>,"
prepared for the guidance of Tasman? I conclude that it could not
have been, or Tasman would have used de Leeuw's name of "Batavia
Revier" instead of Carstenszoon's "Carpentier."</p>
<blockquote>[1) My son, R. Lockhart Jack, suggests that if Tasman
had a difficulty in obtaining the "<i>Pera's</i>" charts, he
would endeavour to enlist and carry with him some of the
"<i>Pera's</i>" old sailors, in the hope of getting from them
assistance in the identification of Carstenszoon's
reviers.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>The note at 17&deg; S. latitude, on Tasman's 1644 chart, which
may be freely translated: "Some people have been as far as this,"
was, in all probability, of the nature of an instruction. To that
point the coast had been explored, and it was in Tasman's
discretion (I) to hurry past it and begin where Carstenszoon left
off, or (2) to land from time to time for the purpose of
verifying Carstenszoon's report. His decision would depend upon
how much time he was prepared to spend on an already-known
coast.</p>
<p>In all probability, he landed, or at least anchored, in
several places on the coast of the Cape York Peninsula short of
previous explorers' furthest south, as he makes observations, or
leaves names, which he could not possibly have got from
pre-existing charts, <i>e.g</i>., the Prince Revier 12&deg; 12'),
the Revier mit Bosch (12&deg; 30' or 12&deg; 33'), Vliege Baij
(13&deg; 12'), Visscher's Revier (13&deg; 42', named after his
Assistant Skipper) and the Pera Revier (16&deg; 15'). It remains
for us to consider the places named by Tasman, one by one, in
their order from north to south.</p>
<p>Having given the shoals of the "Drooge Bocht" a wide berth,
the first position noted in Cape York Peninsula is the
<span class="a">water plaets</span> to which the latitude of
11&deg; S. is assigned.</p>
<p>Carstenszoon, in the "<i>Pera</i>," on 14th May, 1623, noted
an inlet (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A</a>)
which he named "<span class="a">watering-place</span>" and also
"<span class="a">Revier van Spult</span>", in, as he said,
10&deg; 50' S. lat. For reasons already given, I have pointed out
that this (which is the latitude of Red Island) is impossible,
and that the Van Spult Inlet must be a mouth of the Jardine
River, and in, or about, 10&deg; 59' S. Carstenszoon having
described it as an ideal watering-place, where fresh water could
be taken up in buckets lowered from ships, Tasman was likely
enough to have paid it a visit, especially if he needed water. If
he really found and identified it, he was practically correct in
placing it in 11&deg;. But why did he not 'adopt Carstenszoon's
name of "Van Spult"?</p>
<p>The next position noted by Tasman is the "<span class=
"a">Staeten Revier</span>", in 11&deg; 50' (Swart) or 11&deg; 54'
(Heeres). (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP
B.</a>) Close to the coast and in either of these latitudes,
Tasman would be looking into the mouth of <span class="a">Port
Musgrave</span>, the estuary common to the Batavia, Ducie and
Dalhunty Rivers of modern maps. He had just passed (apparently
without observing it) the river to which Carstenszoon gave the
name of <span class="a">Carpentier</span> (called the
<span class="a">Skardon River</span> in modern maps), and still
believed that river to be a long way south and this shows how
inaccurate was the chart on which he had to rely for information
as to his predecessor's discoveries. Having missed the real
Carpentier and found another "revier" not very far to the south,
he would almost certainly have called the latter the Batavia had
he been in possession of either de Leeuw's chart (date uncertain,
say 1623-30) or Kepler and Eekerbrecht's chart (1630), as de
Leeuw had altered Carstenszoon's name of Carpentier to Batavia
and Kepler and Eekerbrecht had copied from him. <span class=
"a">Tasman did not</span>, however, <span class="a">call the
Inlet the Batavia</span>, but, believing it to be new, called it
the Staeten (States) Revier. Why he should have called it by that
name is a mystery, seeing that (as proved by his subsequent
erroneous identification of another Staeten Revier in 16&deg;
47') Carstenszoon's Staten Revier was shown (although,
incorrectly, to the north of lat. 17&deg;) in the "specially
prepared" map which he carried.</p>
<p>Up to the date when Tasman passed Port Musgrave, the singular
state of affairs was that <span class="a">no</span> inlet had yet
been named the Batavia, although the name even then stood on at
least two charts. As a matter of fact, the name was first applied
in 1756 to the principal river debouching into Port Musgrave by
<span class="a">Van Asschens</span>, the mate in command of the
"<i>Buijs</i>," who, no doubt, was in possession of Kepler and
Eekerbrecht's chart, if not of de Leeuw's. Thus Tasman was the
first to notice the mouth of the Port Musgrave Estuary, but he
gave it a name (Staeten) which cannot be accepted, and Van
Asschens was the first to apply the name Batavia to the principal
river discharging into the estuary.</p>
<p>Tasman's third position is in 12&deg; 18' (Swart) or 12&deg;
13' (Heeres), and is named the <span class="a">Prince
Revier</span>, probably in honour of Prince Frederik Henry, then
Stadtholder of Holland. The only opening between 12&deg; 13' and
12&deg; 18' is the mouth (12&deg; 14'-12&deg; 15') of the
<span class="a">Pennefather River</span>, which has figured on
maps for several decades as the "<span class="a">Coen</span>"
River, from Flinders' erroneous identification with the "revier"
to which Carstenszoon gave that name. Tasman had named the inlet
in question the "<span class="a">Prince</span>" more than two
centuries before it was named the Pennefather.</p>
<p>Tasman's "<span class="a">Revier mit Bosch</span>"" (Wooded
Inlet) is placed in 12&deg; 33' by Swart and in 12&deg; 30' by
Heeres. On modern charts, the mouth of <span class=
"a">Pine</span> or <span class="a">Nomenade Creek</span> is in
12&deg; 30', but to reach it Tasman must have doubled sharply
round <span class="a">Duyfken Point</span>, and it is very odd
indeed that his 1644 chart gives no indication of this very
prominent cape. The omission may be attributable to a desire to
avoid overcrowding the chart with details.</p>
<p>If Tasman really sailed to the mouth of Pine Creek, he was
then well inside of <span class="a">Albatross Bay</span>, and his
next inlet, which he calls the "<span class="a">Revier
Carpentier</span>", 1S placed in a bay in 12&deg; 48'. In 12&deg;
40', the <span class="a">Embley River</span> discharges into
Albatross Bay. Tasman's observation may be correct, but why
should he have given a new name (Staeten Revier) to
Carstenszoon's Carpentier Inlet? And why should he have
identified as Carstenszoon's Carpentier an inlet 55 minutes to
the south of it? It is easier to believe that he was supplied
with a very imperfect chart of Carstenszoon's voyage than that he
was careless in his identifications. I conclude that he did not
find Carstenszoon's diary and chart at Banda, as the Governor and
Council at Batavia expected he would, and that the "special
chart" supplied to him was imperfect and misleading.</p>
<p>Tasman next writes "<span class="a">Vliege Baij</span>" (Fly
Bay) on the coast in 13&deg; 12' S. Towards the latter end of the
nineteenth century, this bay was labelled by the Hon. John
Douglas (I am afraid unalterably) "<span class="a">Albatross
Bay</span>." It extends from Duyfken Point (12&deg; 33' S.) to
Pera Head (12&deg; 55' S.), and receives the important, and to
some extent navigable, <span class="a">Mission</span> and
<span class="a">Embley Rivers</span>. Here, for the first time,
Tasman's latitude will not square with modern charting, as, even
if the latitude given by him is meant to be that where he left
the bay behind him, he is wrong by 17 minutes too much south. In
any case, his name of Fly Bay has priority, by more than two and
a half centuries, over the <i>de facto</i> name Albatross Bay.
The name probably records the fact that mosquitoes had forced
themselves on Tasman's notice. The skipper of the "<i>Buijs</i>,"
in April, 1756, recognised <span class="a">Vliege Baij</span>,
although, a month later, the skipper of the "<i>Rijder</i>" named
it <span class="a">Mossel Baij</span>. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-d">MAP D.</a>)</p>
<p>South of Albatross Bay, an inlet in 13&deg; 30' (Swart) or
13&deg; 27' (Heeres) was named the <span class="a">Revier
Coen</span> by Tasman, who evidently believed that he had
identified the inlet (in 13&deg; 7') so named by
Carstenszoon.</p>
<p>The "<i>Investigator</i>" Chart by <span class=
"a">Flinders</span> (1802), corrected by the Admiralty surveyors
up to 1896, shows no break in the coast-line in the position
(13&deg; 7' S.) assigned to the Coen Revier by Carstenszoon in
1623; nor does the Lands Department map. In the chapter devoted
to Missionary Exploration it is shown that the "<i>Pera's</i>"
anchorage was in 13&deg; 7' and that a boat's crew landed there,
and a short walking distance to the north found a small inlet
remarkable only for the presence of esculent herbs, and which was
named the <span class="a">Coen</span>. The Rev. N. Hey, of the
Mapoon Mission, informs me that there is such a water-course in
13&deg; 4' S. lat. Tasman was mistaken in his identification of
the inlet in 13&deg; 27'-13&deg; 30' with Carstenszoon's Coen,
which is in 13&deg; 4'. Tasman's inlet is, in fact, in lat.
13&deg; 20'-13&deg; 21', and is the mouth of the important river
named the <span class="a">Archer</span> by Jardine in 1865. Some
70 miles from its mouth, the Archer splits into two branches, and
the southern and shorter has borne the name of the <span class=
"a">Coen</span> since 1876, for the reason that the discoverers
of a <span class="a">Goldfield</span> on its upper reaches
believed it to be the head of the "<i>Pera's</i>" (<i>i.e</i>.,
Carstenszoon's) Coen. The Lands Department maps now call the
river of the goldfield the "<span class="a">South Coen</span>."
Tasman's erroneous identification was probably due to the
imperfection of the charts with which he had been supplied.</p>
<p>It would not surprise me if direct investigation were to prove
the inlet in 13&deg; 27'-30' which Tasman mistook for the Coen to
be a mouth of the Archer. Considering the "habit" of rivers on
this coast, I should expect a river like the Archer to have
several mouths. In fact, a sketch-map recently made by the Rev.
A. Richter, and certified by the Rev. N. Hey, shows a mouth named
the <span class="a">Dugally River</span> in 13&deg; 33'. There
are probably 'other inlets or mouths of the Archer between
13&deg; 33' and 13&deg; 20', where the only charted mouth is
located, and in this case we need not even suppose an error of a
few minutes of latitude on Tasman's part.</p>
<p>Next in order, in Tasman's 1664 chart, is <span class=
"a">Visscher's Revier</span>, in 13&deg; 42'. Here, again, no
inlet appears on the most recent Admiralty charts or on the maps
of the Lands Department. On the latter, the whole of the
coast-line from the mouth of the Archer River to Cape Keerweer is
a blank; but my charting (not very far to the east) of Jardine's
<i>route</i> of the last days of 1864, from his camp numbered 55
to that numbered 57, shows that a group of considerable streams
must find their way to the sea somewhere on this stretch of
coast, unless they all go to feed the Archer River. It is,
however, equally probable that, assuming Tasman's latitude to be
correct, the inlet which he named in compliment to his
Assistant-Skipper was a mouth of the Archer itself. So far, there
is no reason for suspecting any serious error in Tasman's
latitudes. The fact that he named what he believed to be a new
"revier" in 13&deg; 42' is strong evidence that he actually
landed in or near that latitude.</p>
<p>The next locality noted on Tasman's chart is <span class=
"a">Cape Keerweer</span> (where the "<i>Duyfken</i>" turned
back), which he places in 14&deg; 36'. In that latitude nothing
like a cape appears in modern official sea charts or land maps. I
suggest that his course here was too far out at sea to enable him
to lay down this not very prominent cape from his own observation
and that he copied it from the defective chart which he carried.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-f">MAP F.</a>)</p>
<p>South of the real (13&deg; 58') and the imaginary (14&deg;
36') Cape Keerweer, Tasman's chart shows the "<span class=
"a">Vereenigde Revier</span>" (the "main channel" of the
<span class="a">Mitchell River</span>), in 15&deg; 12' (Swart) or
15&deg; 6' (Heeres). Modern charts place it in 15&deg; 9'. Did
Tasman identify the inlet so named by Carstenszoon, or did he
merely copy from the chart supplied to him?</p>
<p>Next in order comes the "<span class="a">water plaets</span>"
in 15&deg; 30', which agrees with Carstenszoon's <i>data</i>. I
doubt if Tasman would have attempted to land here if he had had
access to the text of Carstenszoon's diary, which shows that
water was only to be collected by a tedious process and in
trifling quantity. For this reason, I conclude that he did not
land, and that he merely copied the note from the chart supplied
to him. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-h">MAP
H.</a>)</p>
<p>Tasman next places the <span class="a">Revier Nassau</span> in
15&deg; 37' (Swart) or 15&deg; 48' (Heeres), instead of in
16&deg; 10' where it was placed by Carstenszoon, and where,
according to modern maps, an unnamed creek runs into the sea. A
large river, which modern maps name the Nassau, and which is one
of the mouths of the Mitchell River, runs into the sea in
latitude, 15&deg; 54', but it was unnoticed by Carstenszoon. It
is more likely that Tasman copied the Revier Nassau from the
imperfect chart supplied to him than that he was 33 or 22 minutes
out in his own observation, so that I doubt if he really visited
it. His supposed identification of Carstenszoon's Nassau was,
unfortunately, accepted by <span class="a">Flinders</span>
(1802), and has, since then, passed into geography and
literature, so that the error cannot now be corrected. It must,
however, be understood that the "<span class="a">Nassau"
Mouth</span> of the <span class="a">Mitchell</span>, as it
appears on modern land maps, is not Carstenszoon's Nassau, and
that the name is merely a complimentary one.</p>
<p>On an inlet in 16&deg; (Swart) or 16&deg; 15' (Heeres), Tasman
bestows the name of the <span class="a">Revier Pera</span>. If
the latitude (16&deg;) scaled from Swart's version of Tasman's
chart correctly conveys Tasman's meaning, this Pera Inlet must,
according to the Lands Department map, be the "<span class=
"a">Tidal Mouth" of Leichhardt's "Rocky Creek</span>." This mouth
is navigable by small craft for four miles. It may, therefore, be
conceded that Tasman landed at or rowed up the inlet which he
named the Pera Revier.</p>
<p>South of the Pera inlet, and 5 minutes south of the mouth of
the large river which modern maps (incorrectly, though
irrevocably) name the Staaten River, Tasman places the
<span class="a">Revier Arnhem</span> in 16&deg; 30'. Modern land
maps show that a water-course, known as <span class="a">Van Rook
Creek</span>, leaks out of the Einasleigh, a tributary of the
Gilbert River, and falls into the Gulf in this latitude, only 6
miles south of the mouth of the Staaten River, <i>de facto</i>,
after meandering across the coastal plain, in a general WNW.
direction, for 150 miles. Carstenszoon, in the diary of the
"<i>Pera's</i>" voyage, made no mention of an inlet in this
neighbourhood, where he was fuming over the desertion and
supposed treachery of the "<i>Aernem</i>." I am inclined to
believe that Tasman actually saw the inlet which he named the
Arnhem, and that he named it in commemoration of the last
appearance of that yacht on the "New Guinea" coast.</p>
<p>In an inlet in 16&deg; 47' (Heeres), Tasman believed himself
to have recognised Carstenszoon's <span class="a">Staten
Revier</span>. The modern land map shows a mouth of the Gilbert
River falling into the Gulf in 16&deg; 45', and it may be assumed
that this is the inlet mistaken by Tasman for Carstenszoon's
Staten Revier. There is, however, as is argued elsewhere, every
ground for believing that <span class="a">Carstenszoon's Staten
Revier</span> was <span class="a">Accident Inlet</span>, another
mouth of the Gilbert, in 17&deg; 13'. However, seeing that the
note in the chart "specially prepared" for Tasman's use laid down
17&deg; as the limit of previous discovery, he was compelled to
recognise, <span class="a">short of that latitude</span>, some
inlet or other as that which was the "<i>Pera's</i>" and
"<i>Aernem's</i>" furthest south, and which Carstenszoon named
the <span class="a">Staten Revier</span>. That note itself was
incorrect, Carstenszoon's diary giving the latitude as 17&deg;
8', while 17&deg; 13' is probably more accurate. That Tasman
accepted the authority of the note is an additional proof, if
such were required, that he was not in possession of
Carstenszoon's diary or chart.</p>
<p>The foregoing attempt to follow Tasman, with the assistance of
modern charts, along the coast previously described by
Carstenszoon leads to the conclusion that while he might very
well, in following the instructions laid down for his guidance,
have passed rapidly over the already-described region and
commenced operations where Carstenszoon left off, he adopted the
alternative course of spending a considerable amount of time in
verifying Carstenszoon's information. That his success was
indifferent is probably attributable to the imperfection of the
chart with which he was supplied.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that we have not the chart which
accompanied Tasman's instructions, and that there are good
grounds for the belief that it gave only an imperfect,
second-hand delineation of Carstenszoon's discoveries; that
Tasman, apparently, was not furnished with Carstenszoon's diary
or chart; and that we have not Tasman's account of his own voyage
and have to rely on a small-scale chart on which he laid down his
discoveries, identifications and observations. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-m">MAP M.</a>)</p>
<br>
<p>Free at last, and with an absolutely untouched stretch of
coast before him, I am inclined to think that Tasman found that
he had already spent too much time in verifying Carstenszoon's
<i>data</i>, and that he had to hurry over what should have been
the most important part of his task. It may be truthfully said in
excuse for him that the whole world presents but few stretches of
coast less picturesque than that on which he was now entering. It
may well be imagined that he was content, in the first place, by
a cursory observation, to settle whether "New Guinea" (as he
regarded it), or Cape York Peninsula (in reality), was continuous
with Arnhem Land or whether a passage to the south lay
between.</p>
<p>Presumably with the intention of making certain that he was
now on an unexplored shore, Tasman made his first descent at
17&deg; 30' (Swart) or 17&deg; 33' (Heeres), where he named
<span class="a">Van Diemen Inlet</span> (Revier). Next, he named
the <span class="a">Van der Lijn</span> and <span class="a">Caron
Inlets</span>, the latter in 17&deg; 47'.</p>
<p><span class="a">Flinders</span>, in 1802, in the
"<i>Investigator</i>," believed he had identified Tasman's Van
Diemen Inlet in the mouth of the Gilbert River (16&deg; 57'). All
the attendant circumstances point to the incorrectness of this
identification, but it has, nevertheless, been adopted without
question in subsequent official maps. Firstly, there is the
discrepancy between the latitudes of 16&deg; 57' and 17&deg; 30'.
Then it is precisely at his Van Diemen's Inlet that Tasman makes
the trend of the coast-line change from S. by W. to W. by S. I
see no reason for doubting that Tasman's latitude of 17&deg; 30'
was substantially correct, especially as it is here that his
chart shows the abrupt change in the trend of the coast-line.
There can be no reasonable doubt that Tasman's <span class=
"a">Van Diemen Inlet</span> was the <span class="a">Mouth of the
Norman River</span>, now the port for the Croydon goldfield and a
considerable area of pastoral country. Its latitude is 17&deg;
28'.</p>
<p>Tasman's three inlets, the Van Diemen, Van Der Lijn and Caron,
are all, according to his chart, within 17 minutes of latitude.
The position in which the name of the <span class="a">Van der
Lijn</span> is written appears to me to be purposely indefinite,
as if it were designed to convey merely that the inlet is between
the Van Diemen and the Caron. I take it to be what is now mapped
as the "<span class="a">Bynoe</span>" mouth of the <span class=
"a">Flinders River</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Caron Inlet</span> is placed on Tasman's
chart in 17&deg; 47', and must be the principal <span class=
"a">Mouth of the Flinders</span> itself. Here, however, Tasman's
latitude is incorrect, according to modern charts, which place
the mouth of the river in 17&deg; 36', so that Tasman's position
is II minutes inland. I am under the impression that Tasman had
become rather indifferent as to his true position and had come to
regard the continuity of the coast of the Cape York Peninsula
with that of Arnhem Land as the problem of the moment.</p>
<p>It may be noted here that <span class="a">Flinders</span>'
chart of 1802 shows the <span class="a">Caron River</span> coming
from the east and falling into the Norman River at Normanton.
Subsequent Lands Department maps have always given the name of
the <span class="a">Caron River</span> to this water-course, thus
creating a mistaken impression. that this was supposed to be
Tasman's Caron.</p>
<p>From the Caron Inlet (Flinders River) Tasman passes beyond our
ken. By following the coast he established the <span class=
"a">Continuity of the Cape York Peninsula</span> (which he named
<span class="a">Carpentaria</span>) <span class="a">With Arnhem
Land</span>, and incidentally that instead of a passage to the
south there was merely the <span class="a">Gulf of
Carpentaria</span>.</p>
<h4>SUMMARY</h4>
<p>The loss of Tasman's journal reduces us to conjecture and the
weighing of probabilities when we attempt to realise what it was
that he accomplished, the groundwork or text of such speculations
being the sketch-chart containing the names which he bestowed on
certain inlets or capes.</p>
<p>So far as the Cape York Peninsula was concerned, he was
apparently supplied with a very imperfect and misleading
"<span class="a">specially made" chart</span> of the voyage of
his predecessor, <span class="a">Carstenszoon</span> (in the
"<i>Pera</i>"). He failed to procure the copies of Carstenszoon's
journal and chart which it was expected he might pick up at
Banda. Carstenszoon's journal, however, is available to us,
although it was denied to him, so that we are in a position to
judge how far he succeeded in identifying the inlets, etc. named
by Carstenszoon.</p>
<p>The truth is that he was very unsuccessful; but this must be
attributed entirely to the defects with the "specially made"
chart and to no fault of his own.</p>
<p>He began his exploration of the Peninsula by rediscovering the
"<i>Pera's</i>" "<span class="a">watering-place</span>" in or
near 11&deg; S. lat., but did not give it the additional name of
the "<span class="a">Revier Van Spult</span>" which Carstenszoon
had bestowed on it. He next made a very bad guess at the locality
of Carstenszoon's <span class="a">Coen Revier</span>, but either
correctly identified or copied from his "specially made" chart
(which seems to have been correct in this instance)
Carstenszoon's <span class="a">Vereenigde Revier</span> (the
<span class="a">Mitchell River</span>).</p>
<p>Carstenszoon's <span class="a">Nassau</span> and <span class=
"a">Staten Reviers</span> were incorrectly located by Tasman, the
latter inlet being placed north instead of south of 17&deg;,
because the "specially made" chart had erroneously fixed that
latitude as Carstenszoon's southern limit.</p>
<p>He was the first <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> to notice
<span class="a">Port Musgrave</span>, which&mdash;probably
misguided by the "specially made" chart&mdash;he seems to have
taken at first for Carstenszoon's Staten Revier (before he
realised that the latter was in the neighbourhood of
17&deg;).</p>
<p>He next found a new inlet (12&deg; 13'-18') which he named the
<span class="a">Prince Revier</span>. The name never "caught on."
For a good part of the nineteenth century this inlet was believed
(incorrectly) to be Carstenszoon's <span class="a">Coen</span>,
and towards the end of that century was officially, and
irrevocably, named the <span class="a">Pennefather</span>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Unless he was anticipated by Janszoon, in the
"<i>Duyfken</i>," of which there is no record.]</blockquote>
<p>He indicated a "<span class="a">Revier mit Bosch</span>" just
inside of <span class="a">Duyfken Point</span>, where modern maps
now show the mouth of <span class="a">Pine</span> or <span class=
"a">Nomenade Creek</span>. To press Tasman's undoubtedly just
claim to priority of nomenclature is not to be thought of, as it
would only add one more to the too numerous family of "Scrubby"
Creeks.</p>
<p>He was the first to give a name, <span class="a">Vliege
Baij</span> (Fly Bay) to what was afterwards named <span class=
"a">Mossel Baij</span>, and, in recent times, <span class=
"a">Albatross Bay</span>, now unalterably fixed by usage and
official recognition.</p>
<p>An inlet in this bay (12&deg; 48') was named by Tasman the
<span class="a">Carpentier</span>, although its identification
with the inlet so named by Carstenszoon would be absurd. This is
one of the few remaining uncharted portions of the coast land,
and if there should turn out to be an inlet of any importance in
the locality indicated, I would suggest that it be named the
<span class="a">Tasman.</span></p>
<p>In 13&deg; 27'-30', Tasman was the first to note a revier
which he erroneously took for Carstenszoon's Coen, but which must
have been one of the mouths of the great river named the
<span class="a">Archer</span> by Jardine in 1865.</p>
<p>A new Revier, <span class="a">Visscher's</span>, was placed by
Tasman in 13&deg; 42'. Should there prove to be such an inlet in
this uncharted portion of the coast land, there is every reason
why Tasman's name (Visscher) should be applied to it.</p>
<p><span class="a">Cape Keerweer</span> (where the
"<i>Duyfken</i>" turned back) is placed in an altogether wrong
position. 'It is more than doubtful if Tasman saw it, and I
believe he merely copied it from his incorrect "specially
prepared" chart.</p>
<p>An inlet in 16&deg; was named the <span class="a">Revier
Pera</span>. This inlet, one of the mouths of <span class=
"a">Leichhardt's Rocky Creek</span>, is only designated a
"<span class="a">tidal inlet</span>" in the modern official map,
and should have the name given to it by Tasman.</p>
<p>On Tasman's <span class="a">Revier Arnhem</span>, long use and
official recognition have irrevocably fixed the name of
<span class="a">Van Rook Creek</span>.</p>
<p>In Tasman's three inlets named <span class="a">Van Diemen's,
Van der Lijn's</span> and <span class="a">Caron's</span>, there
is no difficulty in recognising respectively (1) the mouth of the
<span class="a">Norman River</span>, (2) the "<span class=
"a">Bynoe" Mouth</span> Of the Flinders River and (3) the
"<span class="a">Flinders" Mouth</span> of the Flinders.</p>
<p>The name of the Van Der Lijn does not appear to have ever been
adopted by modern maps, but Flinders was responsible for
erroneous identifications of the Van Diemen and Caron, and,
following him, the name Van Diemen still persists as applied to
one of the mouths of the Gilbert River, in 16&deg; 58'. The
sooner it is dropped the better. Nor could any useful purpose now
be served by restoring Tasman's names for the three inlets, even
if it were possible to overcome the weight of long-established
private and official use of other names.</p>

<blockquote>[1) <i>Rijder</i>, Ritter, Rider, person of

<br>
<h4>THE "BUIJS" (ASSCHENS)</h4>
<p>Emerging from the friendly harbour of Banda on 1st April, the
"<i>Buijs</i>" barquentine sailed to the east, and on 23rd April,
while in latitude 12&deg; 58' S., "sighted the <span class=
"a">Land of Carpentaria</span>, recognising what has been named
<span class="a">Cape Keerweer</span>." The anchor was dropped at
sunset.</p>
<p>On 24<i>th April</i>, the noon latitude was 12&deg; 54'. The
anchor was dropped at sunset and bearings gave Cape Keerweer
8&#8531;&deg; N. and "the inner hook near the river," (inlet)
ENE. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-d">MAP D.</a>)</p>
<p>Assuming the correctness of the noon observation of 12&deg;
54' (and there is no reason to doubt it), the point of land was
not Cape Keerweer, which is in 13&deg; 59', but either
<span class="a">False Pera Head</span> or <span class="a">Pera
Head</span> itself&mdash;probably the former, the latter being
the "inner hook." The reference to "the revier" (inlet) is
obscure, but this may be the fault of the summary rather than of
the log.</p>
<p>Under the mistaken impression that he had identified the Cape
Keerweer of the "<i>Duyfken's</i>" voyage, Asschens resolved to
steer to the north. In the forenoon of 25<i>th April</i> he
cleared <span class="a">Pera Head</span>. At noon he was in
12&deg; 42' and he anchored at sunset.</p>
<p>Next morning the northerly course was resumed, and in the
forenoon "a red point" was seen to form the northern horn of "a
deep bay or bight" (now <span class="a">Albatross Bay</span>) on
which the "<i>Buijs</i>" had entered after clearing Pera Head.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>) The bay
was recognised as that which Tasman had designated <span class=
"a">Vliege Baij</span>. The Point, which now bears the name of
the "<span class="a">Duyfken</span>", was charted as <span class=
"a">Asschens' Hoek</span>, and by right of priority should be so
called. The error, however, has so long been condoned by usage as
to have become unalterable.</p>
<p>Leaving this point and keeping close to the land, the
"<i>Buijs</i>" was in 12&deg; 16' at noon. Smoke was observed on
land, and even what appeared to be men and huts. The anchor was
dropped at sunset in a position which may be conjectured to have
been about 12&deg; 2' S., a little south of the mouth Of
<span class="a">Janie Creek</span>, between the <span class=
"a">Pennefather River</span> (which Tasman had already named the
<span class="a">Prince Revier</span>) and <span class="a">Mapoon
Mission Station</span>.</p>
<p>Setting sail again at daybreak on 27<i>th April</i>, the land
was found to fall away to the east. As a matter of fact, in
coming from the south, the direction of the coast-line changes,
about 7 minutes short of Mapoon, from N. by E. to NE. Before
midday, Asschens was abreast of "a revier (inlet) with an island
lying off its mouth." The inlet (which had been seen by Tasman)
was designated by Asschens the <span class="a">Batavia</span>,
and by this name the largest river of the Peninsula, ending in
Port Musgrave estuary in 11&deg; 56' S., is now known. It is true
that the name of Batavia had already figured for some time on
Dutch maps, but it was improperly applied (following de Leeuw) to
the inlet which Carstenszoon had named the Carpentier River in
1623, and which is now known as the Skardon River.</p>
<p>The "<i>Duyfken</i>" had passed this inlet in 1606, and the
"<i>Aernem</i>" (once) and the "<i>Pera</i>" (twice) in 1623,
without observing it. The records of the "<i>Duyfken's</i>"
voyage have been lost, and it may be conjectured that the
"<i>Buijs</i>" either sailed closer to the land, or approached it
in a better light, than the "<i>Pera</i>" or the "<i>Aernem</i>."
The supposed island was, no doubt, a sandbank visible at low
tide, 3 miles off the mouth of Port Musgrave. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) Mr. J. T. Embley, who has sailed frequently along
this coast, and seen it from probably the same distance as the
"<i>Buijs</i>," writes me under date 18th July, 1916: "The
Batavia has a little island about three miles out from the mouth,
but it is only a high sandbank covered at high tide . . . The
mouth of the Batavia is plainly visible to any boat travelling
from the north at a distance of 15 or 20 miles before you come to
it. No boat could pass it in the daytime without seeing
it."]</blockquote>
<p>Without landing at the new river, the "<i>Buijs</i>" sailed on
to the north. At noon on the 27<i>th</i>, the latitude was
roughly estimated at 11&deg; 38'. Smoke was observed on the land,
and apparently the mouth of Carstenszoon's <span class=
"u">Carpentier River</span> was not seen. The "<i>Buijs</i>"
anchored in the afternoon. At noon on the 28<i>th</i> she was in
11&deg; 29'. At noon on the 29<i>th</i> she was in 11&deg; 3'.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>) Two
hours later, the anchor was dropped in 8 fathoms, the navigators
believing themselves to be close to the <span class="a">Van Spult
River</span> named by Carstenszoon in 1623. In this belief they
were quite correct, the solar observation at noon on the
30<i>th</i> giving 10&deg; 56'. They were, in fact, on the Inskip
Banks or the "extensive sandy shoals" south of the Banks which
are indicated by modern charts.</p>
<p>It had become necessary to take in water and firewood, both of
which were running short. The charted Watering-place at the Van
Spult River naturally suggested itself to Asschens, but the
uncharted shoals called for prudent action. Accordingly, on
30<i>th April</i>, a boat with eight men was sent out to take
soundings towards the land. The <span class="a">boat</span> was
lost sight of before nightfall and was <span class="a">never seen
or heard of again</span>. Whether it was wrecked among the shoals
or the crew fell into the hands of the natives must remain a
mystery. The "<i>Buijs</i>" waited for the boat till 12<i>th
May</i>, when the scarcity of water and firewood compelled her to
sail westward for <span class="a">Timor Laut</span>, <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> which was reached on 20th May. No attempt
appears to have been made to search the land for the boat's crew,
and it may have been that there were too few men left on the
"<i>Buijs</i>" to furnish a landing party and risk its loss.</p>
<blockquote>[2) The largest island of the Tenimber group, and now
known as Yamdena.]</blockquote>
<p>From the cartographer's covering letter, it appears that the
sailing orders of the "<i>Rijder</i>" and "<i>Buijs</i>" enjoined
some exploration of the interior, and Asschens probably intended
to carry out this instruction when the overwhelming disaster
overtook him. The cartographer's comment on Asschens is most
severe, and, I think, unjust:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Of the proceedings of 'Stuurman'
Lavienne Lodewijk Asschens (who had command of the barquentine
'<i>Buijs</i>'), the Undersigned can give no account deserving of
consideration, while his reports or notes are so misleading that
it is clear at the first glance that he can never have had any
first-hand knowledge or ocular view of the matters referred to by
him, seeing that he has hardly ever been nearer to the land than
3 miles off, at which distance, however, he pretends to have seen
a river with an island before its mouth, as well as men, huts,
etc.: all which seems to the Undersigned impossible on a flat
land, such as this is. Nor has he made any landing on the said
coast, although, contrary to Your Worships' orders, he had sailed
along it from S. to N. for 40 miles before the misfortune of the
loss of the boat befel, as Your Worships may gather from the
annexed rough sketch of the coast sent in by him."<b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) Heeres says: "I have not met with this
chart."]</blockquote>
<p>Asschens certainly began by mistaking Pera Head for Cape
Keerweer, but, with the exception of this mistake, his
description can easily be followed on, and agrees with, accurate
modern charts. It must be remembered that his description is only
known to us from a paraphrase of it made by a very unfavourably
impressed (shall we say, prejudiced?) official. He correctly
identified Tasman's Vliege Baij (Albatross Bay) and gave the name
of Asschen's Hoek to what is now called Duyfken Point. He noted
the estuary now called Port Musgrave, which he named the
<span class="a">Batavia Revier</span>. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> Lastly, he correctly located himself
abreast of the <span class="a">Van Spult River</span> before
leaving Australia.</p>
<blockquote>[2) Tasman, who was probably misled by the "specially
prepared" chart with which he was provided, had named it the
Staeten Revier, under the impression that it was the Staten
Revier of Carstenszoon.]</blockquote>
<br>
<h4>THE "RIJDER" (GONZAL)</h4>
<p>After losing sight of her consort, the "<i>Buijs</i>," off
Banda, on 26th March, 1756, and unaware that she had found
shelter, the "<span class="a">Rijder</span>", having weathered
the storm, continued her voyage, and reached <span class=
"a">False Cape</span>, the westmost point of Frederick Henry
Island, Papua, on 4th April. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-a">MAP A.</a>) "The <span class="a">High Land of
Carpentaria</span>, known by the name of <span class="a">Hoog
Eijland</span>," was sighted on 10th April. This "high land" was,
no doubt, <span class="a">Hammond</span> and <span class=
"a">Prince of Wales Islands</span>. A reef (the Gerard and
Larpent Banks) was observed to extend from the high land nearly
to a hitherto uncharted island, which was named <span class=
"a">Rijder's Island</span>, and which must have been <span class=
"a">Booby Island</span>. Possibly the ship's course lay between
the reef and the island. In making cautiously for the coast, the
"<i>Rijder</i>" apparently approached <span class="a">Prince of
Wales Island</span> near its north-western corner, where a first
<span class="a">landing</span> was made on 17<i>th April</i>.
Only one <span class="a">native</span> was seen, and he fled on
the approach of the boat's crew, who noted bark huts, a bark
canoe, fishing-lines, claws of animals used for fish-hooks, and
spears barbed with bone. The description of the country could not
possibly apply to any portion of the adjacent Cape York
Peninsula. There were very rich soil, tall grasses, long straight
timber and fine valleys with rills of fresh water. Several
landings were subsequently made for the purpose of taking in
water and firewood before the "<i>Rijder</i>" put out to sea
again on 26<i>th April</i>. Her next recorded course was ENE.,
"following the trend of the coast," in 5, 6 or 7 fathoms. The
coast-line of Prince of Wales Island, it is true, takes this
direction from the north-western point of the island, but modern
charts show that it would have been impossible to carry the depth
of water indicated for any distance on an ENE. course. The
presumption is that after an unsuccessful attempt on this
impossible coast-line, the ship stood out to sea until she had
cleared the Gerard and Larpent Banks and then followed the Prince
of Wales Channel east-north-eastward, passing the north sides of
<span class="a">Good</span> and <span class="a">Hammond
Islands</span>. The anchor was dropped on 28<i>th April</i> in
10&deg; 30' S. The only land in this latitude is <span class=
"a">Wednesday Island</span>. Here a party <span class=
"a">landed</span>, but found only bark huts inhabited by
<span class="a">natives</span>, who fled into the woods. The
ship's boat was beached and repaired. The "<i>Rijder</i>" herself
lay at anchor till 13<i>th May</i>, to give the "<i>Buijs</i>" a
chance of rejoining her.</p>
<p>Had Gonzal taken the "<i>Rijder</i>" east of Wednesday Island,
he would have had a clear way into the Coral Sea and the Pacific
Ocean, but he turned back on 13th May with the intention of
following the coast to the south. He kept well out from the land,
and, in fact, overdid it in his natural desire for sea-room, and
it was not until 24th May that he again sighted <span class=
"a">land</span> (south of the Pennefather River&mdash;Tasman's
Prince Revier), in 12&deg; 18' S. (<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>) Drawing closer to the shore, he
anchored on 25<i>th May</i> in 12&deg; 26' S. (9 miles north of
Duyfken Point).</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"As they lay at anchor at about 1 or
1&frac12; miles distance from the shore, they saw two of the
previously described canoes paddling up to the ship, each
containing two men, who, when they had got near the ship, by
signs and cries began to signify to our men that they wished them
to come ashore. The following day, being the 26<i>th of May</i>,
our men went ashore at daybreak, and on landing found several
persons there, who, however, all took to flight directly. They
also saw two dogs, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> not unlike
Bengal jackals. The persons who had fled shortly afterwards
returned to them, when they found them armed with the assegays
above described. They were accompanied by a number of womenfolk
who were clothed with a sort of mat. The natives then all of them
sat down on the beach near our men, who made signs to them that
they were seeking fresh water, upon which the natives rose and
signified their willingness to point out the places where water
was obtainable. And so it happened that our men were taken along
the beach for a short distance and conducted to a beautiful
valley with fine trees. This seemed to be the home of the
natives, as there were more women and children and also some
places where they lived, consisting merely of shelters beneath
the trees covered in with bark. The water which was found here
welled up through artificial openings. They walked round and
inspected the place and then returned to the strand, where they
found the two canoes in which the natives had first visited the
ship. While they sat on the beach, 19 natives came up to them,
having their bodies all besmeared with red, and held a frolic
with a kind of song. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> Then they
were treated to some arrack with sugar, and shortly afterwards
they retired satisfied into the wood.</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) They were thus the first white men to record
having seen the <span class="u">dingo</span>.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) This is the first record of white men having been
entertained with a <span class=
"u">corroborree</span>.]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote class="inline">"In the morning of the 27<i>th</i>,
our men landed again, to see if they could not capture a man or
two, but they did not succeed in doing so that day, because they
were too late to entice the natives to the beach. Early in the
morning of the 28th they landed again in order to execute their
plan. On their arrival the natives came dancing and singing, sat
down beside them and laid aside their so-called assegais or
weapons and again indulged in drinking, under the influence of
which two of them were seized, whereupon the others jumped up and
set upon our people with their assegais, without, however,
wounding anyone; but the ship's clerk, who was trying to get hold
of one of the savages, was slightly wounded by him in the hand.
Then a shot was fired and one of the natives was wounded and the
others fled into the bush. Our people then tried to drag to the
boat the two men they had got hold of, but while they were being
tied up one of them, by superhuman biting and tearing, managed to
break loose and took to flight. Immediately thereafter, upwards
of 50 natives came up, preparing to throw assegais, but a single
volley put them to flight. Then our men took their one captive on
board."</blockquote>
<p>On 29<i>th May</i>, the "<i>Rijder</i>" dropped anchor at noon
in 12&deg; 31' S., <i>i.e</i>., about 4 (English) miles north Of
<span class="a">Duyfken Point</span>. She lay at anchor all the
next day, and two canoes paddled out and inspected her from a
distance of half a mile (Dutch). On the 31<i>st</i>, she cleared
<span class="a">Duyfken Point</span>, and at noon was in lat.
12&deg; 44' S. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-d">MAP
D.</a>) After contending with a contrary current, she anchored at
sunset in <span class="a">Albatross Bay</span>, which Gonzal
named <span class="a">Mosselbaaij</span>. Asschens had recognised
it five weeks earlier as Tasman's <span class="a">Vliege
Baij</span>.</p>
<p>On 1<i>st June</i>, only a short distance was sailed in the
forenoon, and an anchor was dropped in 12&deg; 51' S. A boat was
sent out the following day, and reported abundant water at or
near the "<i>Pera's</i>" <span class="a">watering-place</span> of
9th May, 1623, where "the chart showed a fresh-water river." The
"<i>Rijder</i>" moved on, on 3rd June, to the position indicated,
which was in 12&deg; 57' S., between <span class="a">Pera
Head</span> and <span class="a">False Pera Head</span>, and
dropped her anchor. A stay of ten days was made here while water
and firewood were taken in and the boat was repaired. "Water came
rushing down the rocks, and there was also a fine pool where many
birds of different sorts were seen." The place was named
<span class="a">Rijder's Waterplaets</span>. The above
description is not unlike that of the "<i>Pera's</i>"
Waterplaets, but the two may be distinct, although they cannot be
far apart. No natives were seen.</p>
<p>The voyage was resumed on 13th June. At noon the latitude was
13&deg; 2' S. (the narrative gives 12&deg; 2' S., evidently a
clerical error). On the 14th, it was 13&deg; 8' at noon. "At the
first glass of the dog-watch," the anchor was dropped, slightly
to the south of the <span class="a">Rijder's Hoek</span>. To this
prominence, in 13&deg; 10', modern charts give no name. The
latitude of the anchorage was made out to be 13&deg; S. at noon
on the following day. I can only conclude that this was a faulty
observation, as it is contradicted by the observations of the two
preceding days, which agree with the contour of the coast-line.
In the morning of the same day, a boat's crew landed, after
having been met by two men in a canoe, who invited them to come
ashore. Eleven men and five women met them on the beach, the men
being armed with spears. The <span class="a">natives</span> tried
to take off the hats of the visitors, which the latter resisted
whereupon the natives threatened with their spears. A shot was
fired and the crowd fled, with the exception of one youth, who
was carried on board.</p>
<p>The sailors found a large pond of fresh water, and judged that
the country, if cultivated, would prove fertile. It was remarked
that the natives subsisted mainly on roots of trees, and wild
fruits such as batatas or oubis, with a little fish, and that
they seemed to have some knowledge of gold when some lumps of the
metal were shown them. It is not stated on what occasion these
observations were made. It cannot have been on the single
interview above referred to.</p>
<p>On 16<i>th June</i>, the course was set westward for
<span class="a">Aernem's Land</span>. On the 24<i>th</i>, the
"<span class="a">Mainland of New Holland</span> was sighted, and
the home journey was concluded <i>via</i> Timor and Rotti.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as her crew effected landings on Prince of 'Wales
Island and at three different localities on the mainland, the
"<i>Rijder</i>" added more to our knowledge of the interior and
its inhabitants than the "<i>Buijs</i>," whose men were defeated
on their only attempt at landing. The "<i>Rijder</i>" was the
first (except, perhaps, the "<i>Duyfken</i>") to land a party in
the neighbourhood of <span class="a">Duyfken Point</span> and to
explore the southern shore of <span class="a">Albatross
Bay</span>. The landing south of <span class="a">Pera Head</span>
confirmed the existence of the "<i>Pera's</i>" watering-place.
The last landing on the Peninsula, at <span class="a">Rijder's
Hoek</span>, was made in a locality till then unvisited. After
this landing, probably no white footprint marked the soil until,
fourteen years later, Captain Cook landed on the eastern coast of
the Peninsula.</p>

<p>B<small>EYOND</small> question, Lieutenant-Commander (by
courtesy Captain) James Cook, R.N., ranks foremost among the
navigators who helped to build up the British Empire. Among the
services which he performed, the greatest of all were the
discoveries which led to the acquisition of Australia.</p>
<p>The main incidents of his adventures in Australia are so well
known that in the present volume it is necessary to do little
more than to trace his connection with the Cape York
Peninsula.</p>
<p>The great "First" Voyage commenced in 1768 and ended in 1771.
Although Cook's original Log or Journal is still extant, it was
only given to the world in its entirety by Captain Sir W. J. L.
Wharton, R.N., in 1893. The Editor remarks:</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Strange it must appear that the
account of the most celebrated and certainly, to the English
nation, the most momentous voyage of discovery that has ever
taken place&mdash;for it practically gave birth to the great
Australian colonies&mdash;has never before been given to the
world in the very words of its great leader. It has fallen out in
this wise.]</blockquote>
<blockquote class="inline">"After the return of the
'<i>Endeavour</i>,' it was decided that a full and comprehensive
account of the voyage should be compiled. Cook's Journal dealt
with matters from the point of view of the seaman, the explorer
and the head of the expedition, responsible for life and for its
general success. The Journals of Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander
looked from the scientific side on all that presented itself to
their enthusiastic observation.]<br>
<br>
"What could be better than to combine these accounts and make up
a complete narrative from them all?</blockquote>
<blockquote class="inline">"The result, however, according to our
nineteenth-century ideas, was not altogether happy. Dr.
Hawkesworth, into whose hands the Journals were put, not only
interspersed reflections of his own, but managed to impose his
own ponderous style upon many of the extracts from the united
Journals; and, moreover, as they were all jumbled together, the
whole being put into Cook's mouth, it is impossible to know
whether we are reading Cook, Banks, Solander or Hawkesworth
himself."</blockquote>
<p>Up to the present day, numerous accounts of the "Voyages,"
"Lives," etc., have been issued, and in many languages. They
condense or expand with the greatest freedom, according to the
views or objects of this or that author or editor.</p>
<p>More than fifty years ago, I picked up, at an Edinburgh
bookstall, a Glasgow edition <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> of
Cook's Voyages, in three volumes, which may serve as an
illustration of how Cook's narrative was dealt with and edited in
such a fashion that Cook himself would hardly have recognised it.
It is Hawkesworth, without the division into chapters, or the
rubrics which preface the chapters. Portions, however, are
omitted and again portions are added, the Journals of Cook, Banks
and Solander, together with Kippis' <i>Life of Cook</i>, having
been laid under contribution, while many philosophical
observations were evidently contributed by the anonymous editor
himself. No acknowledgment is ever made, but, even for statements
or facts which at first appear to be new, justification can
usually be found somewhere in one or other of the authentic
documents. The editing, on the whole, is skilfully done, although
Captain Cook is made to speak "in the first person singular," and
reflections and observations are put into his mouth which he
certainly would never have dreamed of making. What between
Hawkesworth and the later editor, the plain tale of a sailor has
assumed a mask compounded of pedantry and Calvinistic piety which
forms a baffling disguise.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Captain Cook's Voyages, including Captain
Furneaux's Journal</i>. Glasgow, W. D. and A. Brownlie,
1807-8-9.]</blockquote>
<p>The primary object of the voyage which was commenced in 1768
was the measurement of the sun's distance by means of an
observation of the transit of Venus, a project which was urged by
the Royal Society and warmly supported by King George III. This
object having been accomplished, the expedition was to explore
the South Seas.</p>
<p>The barque "<i>Endeavour</i>," of 370 tons, originally built
as a collier, was selected as a suitable vessel and added to the
Royal Navy. Her complement was ninety-five persons in all,
inclusive of eleven who were civilians. Among the latter were Mr.
(afterwards Sir) Joseph Banks, a naturalist with a leaning
towards botany, who had been President of the Royal Society, Dr.
Charles Solander, his Secretary and Assistant, Mr. Charles Green,
Astronomer, and Messrs. Reynolds, Parkinson and Buchan, Artists.
All of the above-named, except Banks and Solander, died on the
voyage. As Banks was merely a passenger, and therefore
practically independent of Captain Cook, it would not have been
surprising if friction had arisen. But he was plentifully endowed
with judgment as well as with initiative and technical knowledge,
and was able to render signal services during the voyage, and
afterwards to help the Government with sage advice regarding the
conduct of the newly acquired colony of New South Wales.
Considering that the observations of Cook and Banks sometimes
overlapped, and that their journals were written simultaneously,
but independently, and that Cook, although self-taught, possessed
no mean scientific knowledge, it is, indeed, much to the credit
of both men that their intercourse was never marred by jealousy.
The obvious explanation is that both were gentlemen in the finest
sense of the word. It is, nevertheless, a fact that, reading
between the lines of both of their journals, one can find here
and there a trace of human weakness. The one can enjoy a joke
which tells against the other.</p>
<p>The transit of Venus was duly and successfully observed at
Tahiti, the locality selected for the purpose. Intimate relations
were established with the natives of the islands during a
residence of three months, and showed that an unsophisticated
race had attained a measure of civilisation along ethical lines
differing widely from those of Europe. New Zealand was next
visited, and the information given by Tasman was greatly added
to, the essential division of the land into two large islands
being established.</p>
<p>Early in the year 1770, Cook set sail from New Zealand and
struck the east coast of Australia near Cape Howe. Following the
coast to the north, he made his first landing on 28<i>th
April</i> at <span class="a">Botany Bay</span>, where he stayed
till 6th May. Fresh water was taken on board and Banks and
Solander revelled in new realms of natural history. Daily
attempts were made to cultivate the friendship of the natives,
who, unfortunately, proved hostile and suspicious, and on several
occasions threw spears. It was observed that they used
wimmeras.</p>
<p>Leaving Botany Bay, Cook followed the coast north and
northwest, giving to the majority of the capes and bays the names
which they now bear. His landings were few and brief, and were
made chiefly in search of fresh water. His first landing at the
base of Cape York Peninsula was at <span class="a">Trinity
Bay</span>, on 10<i>th June</i>. (<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-g">MAP G.</a>) It was at <span class="a">Cape
Tribulation</span> that his troubles began, on the night of that
same day. In fine weather and clear moonlight, the ship stuck
fast on a coral reef, and began to leak in an alarming manner.
Ballast, six guns, and other material over 50 tons&mdash;were
jettisoned, and at length, by throwing out anchors, the
"<i>Endeavour</i>" was warped into deep water. The leak was
temporarily overcome by the process known as "fothering,"
<i>i.e.</i>, a sail was passed below the keel and secured at both
bulwarks and was pressed into the hole by which the water had
been rushing into the ship. Then the pumps easily kept the water
under control. In the nick of time, a harbour of refuge was
found. On the 17th June, the "<i>Endeavour</i>" lay alongside a
steep beach in <span class="a">Endeavour Inlet</span>, where, 103
years later, arose the town of <span class="a">Cooktown</span>.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>) When the
bottom could be examined, it was found that the biggest hole was
plugged up by a stone which had been detached from the reef. Had
this rock dropped out, the ship must inevitably have
foundered.</p>
<p>While the ship was being repaired, the officers and passengers
explored the land. They were in harbour till 4th August. They
made the acquaintance of the kangaroo, the opossum, the dingo,
the flying fox, the snake, the turtle, the "alligator" and many
birds. Banks collected a store of plants then new to science.</p>
<p>Tied, as they were, to the crippled ship, we cannot expect
much information from Cook and his companions regarding the
interior. Cook himself climbed <span class="a">Grassy
Hill</span>, south of the harbour, and probably also the
jungle-clad hill now known as <span class="a">Mount Cook</span>.
What concerned him most was the question of a northward passage,
and the outlook in this respect was disquieting. He also climbed
one of the hills on the north side of the harbour, and another
(<span class="a">Mount Saunders?</span>) 7 or 8 miles further
north. Other members of the party rowed up the <span class=
"a">Endeavour River</span> to fresh water.</p>
<p>In Cook's mind, next to the safety of the ship, came the
desire to cultivate the friendship of the <span class=
"a">natives</span> (the Indians, as it was then the fashion to
call them) and observe their habits. The party had, however, been
in the harbour for no less than three weeks before they "spoke"
any of the inhabitants. On 10th July, four men appeared on the
north side of the estuary, engaged in spearing fish. Eventually,
they paddled their outrigger canoe to the ship and entered into
conversation "without expressing any fear or distrust." Small
presents were given to the men, who came on board and remained
for some time. Besides the spears which they carried, Cook noted
the wimmera or throwing-stick. Daily visits followed and amicable
relations were established and strengthened by gifts of iron,
beads and food. It took the natives, however, only nine days of
intercourse to learn how to presume upon the good nature of their
hosts. On 19th July, a party of sixteen or seventeen came to the
ship, the number including, for the first time, a few women.
Scornfully rejecting biscuits, they demanded a turtle and
attempted to take it by force. Foiled in this attempt, they
leaped into the sea, climbed into their canoe and paddled for the
shore. Cook and Banks got into a boat, with a crew, and were the
first to land. As soon as the natives landed, they snatched a
brand from beneath a kettle of pitch and set fire to the grass
around the camp. The smith's forge was destroyed and a pig was
burned to death. The natives then made for another spot, where
sailors were engaged in washing and drying nets, and set fire to
the grass. As matters had gone far enough, a musket loaded with
small shot was discharged at one of the natives, "which drew
blood at 40 yards," says Cook, and the natives fled. Then a ball
was fired "across their bows," to convince them that they were
not yet beyond the reach of punishment, whereupon the fugitives
quickened their pace and were lost to sight. A few minutes later,
they emerged from a wood, headed by an old man, made friendly
advances, and were forgiven, and received presents, among which,
by way of object-lesson, were musket bullets, the uses and
effects of which were explained. If the trouble had occurred a
few days earlier, Cook remarked, all his powder, which was then
ashore, would have been lost.</p>
<p>Four days later, a member of the crew incautiously walked into
a native camp, and found himself in the power of four "Indians,"
who, however, permitted him to depart in peace after having
satisfied their curiosity regarding the texture of his clothing
and skin and refused the knife which he offered them. They even
took the trouble to set him right when he made for the ship in
the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Such relations had been established before the
"<i>Endeavour</i>" left the harbour that the crew knew most of
their aboriginal visitors by name, and were able to distinguish
strangers when these made their appearance. The tribe consisted,
as far as Cook saw, of twelve men, seven women, one boy and one
girl. He observed the native method of fire-raising by
friction.</p>
<p>What "frightfulness" means in navigation can be fully
appreciated by any passenger on a mail steamer who has the run of
the chart-room on the bridge between Cooktown and Cape York. The
narrow passage between the land and the Barrier Reef, charted,
lighted, buoyed and beaconed though it now is, is crowded with
reefs ready to punish remorselessly any deviation from the right
path. That this path is negotiated daily in safety and comfort is
due to the skill and the ceaseless watch of the officers. What
must the passage have been when this was an unknown sea and the
frail sailing craft depended on the caprice of light winds!</p>
<p>Cook put out to sea on 5<i>th August</i>. The "Master" had
previously visited the "Three Islands" of the Low <span class=
"a">Woody Group</span>. The "<i>Endeavour</i>" rounded
<span class="a">Cape Bedford</span> and anchored off <span class=
"a">Lookout Point</span>, where <span class="a">Cook</span>
himself <span class="a">landed</span>. The lookout was very
unsatisfactory, as the chance of getting away to the north seemed
doubtful, and so the boats were called upon to scout. The Master
landed on the <span class="a">Turtle Islands</span> to the north.
<span class="a">Cook</span> himself <span class="a">landed</span>
and passed a night on <span class="a">Lizard Island</span>, and
on his way back to the ship landed on <span class="a">Eagle
Island</span>.</p>
<p>The "<i>Endeavour</i>" left <span class="a">Lookout
Point</span> on 13<i>th August</i> and, passing on the north side
of <span class="a">Eagle</span> and <span class="a">Lizard
Islands,</span> found a way (<span class="a">Cook's
Passage</span>) through the reef due east of the <span class=
"a">Howick Island</span>. There was deep water (over 150 fathoms)
outside of the reef and an open sea to the north-west, in which
direction the course was set. At four in the morning of the 16th,
it was found that although the lead gave "no bottom" the ship was
within a mile of a <span class="a">reef</span> on which the swell
broke thunderously: there was hardly a breath of wind, and a
strong current was driving the ship on the reef. After a fight
with death lasting till late in the afternoon, a light breeze and
a current combined to drive the ship through a narrow opening in
the reef into a peaceful anchorage. The passage was appropriately
named <span class="a">Providential Channel</span>.</p>
<p>Cook was, no doubt, even better pleased to get inside the reef
than he had been to get outside a few days before, and he
resolved, as he said, "whatever the consequence might be, to keep
the main land on board" for the rest of his northward voyage. He
had to settle, once and for ever, the question "whether this
country did or did not join to New Guinea." This question had
been answered centuries before by Spaniards and Portuguese, but
so well had these guarded the secret that the answer was unknown
not only to the Dutch in 1606, 1623, 1644 and 1756, but also to
the English in 1770.</p>
<p>Inside of the Barrier Reef, Cook again saw the mainland, at a
point which he named <span class="a">Cape Weymouth</span>.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>) On
resuming his northward course, he saw and named <span class=
"a">Temple Bay</span> and passed outside of the <span class=
"a">Forbes Islands</span>, which he named. He then rounded
<span class="a">Cape Grenville</span>, which he named, leaving
the <span class="a">Sir Charles Hardy</span> and <span class=
"a">Cockburn Islands</span>, which he named, on his right. Still
keeping the mainland in sight and steering to the north-west, he
passed outside of the islands which he named <span class=
"a">Bird</span> and <span class="a">Cairncross</span>. He also
named <span class="a">Newcastle Bay</span>. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>) Arrived within sight
of <span class="a">Mount Adolphus Island</span>, he observed that
the mainland receded to the west and altered his course to that
direction. <span class="a">Cape York</span>, the northmost horn
of Australia, was passed and named. The high lands of
<span class="a">Prince of Wales</span> and <span class="a">Horn
Islands</span>, which the earlier Dutch navigators had taken to
be part of the mainland, were recognised as islands. The
<span class="a">Insularity of New Guinea</span> was at last
settled beyond cavil.</p>
<p>Before bidding a last adieu to Australia, Cook landed on
<span class="a">Possession Island</span> and hoisted the
<span class="a">English Flag</span> on the highest point.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Having satisfied myself," says Cook,
"of the great probability of a passage, thro' which I intend
going with the Ship, and therefore may land no more upon this
Eastern coast of New Holland, and on the Western side I can make
no new discovery, the honour of which belongs to the Dutch
Navigators, but the Eastern Coast from the Lat. of 38&deg; down
to this place, I am confident, was never seen or visited by any
European before us; and notwithstanding I had in the Name of His
Majesty taken possession of many places upon this Coast, I now
once more hoisted English Colours, and in the Name of His Majesty
King George the Third took possession of the whole Eastern coast
from the above Lat. down to this place by the Name of New Wales,
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> together with all the Bays,
Harbours, Rivers and Islands, situated upon the said Coast; after
which we fired 3 Volleys of small Arms, which were answer'd by
the like number from the Ship."</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) New South Wales in the "Admiralty" copy of the
manuscript.]</blockquote>
<p>It would have been more correct, dramatically, if the ceremony
had been performed on the mainland, but the reason for the use of
the island is sufficiently explained by the passage from Cook's
diary above quoted.</p>
<p>On the summit of the highest hill in <span class=
"a">Possession Island</span>, and therefore practically on the
spot where Cook planted his flagstaff, a vein of <span class=
"a">auriferous quartz</span> was discovered by Mr. J. T. Embley
in 1895 and worked by him and others for some years afterwards.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> It is safe to say that had the
discovery been made by Captain Cook the development of Australia
would have proceeded from north to south instead of from south to
north. By what apparently trivial circumstances the currents of
historical events may be directed into one channel or
another!</p>
<blockquote>[1) See Chapter LXXXVII, Vol. II]</blockquote>
<p>Ten men were observed on a hill in <span class="a">Possession
Island</span>, and one of them appeared to have a <span class=
"a">bow and arrows</span>. Cook, however, confessed that the
observation was of doubtful value, having been made with glasses
and from a considerable distance. Subsequent observations have
proved bows and arrows to be foreign to the mainland of
Australia.</p>
<p>His task accomplished, Cook rounded the southern cape of
Prince of Wales Island and set his course to the north-west. One
more <span class="a">landing</span> was made in Australian
waters, at <span class="a">Booby Island</span>, on 23<i>rd
August</i>, 1770. On his homeward voyage, he visited New Guinea,
Timor, Java and the Cape of Good Hope, and reached Dover on 12th
June, 1771. In after years, and far from Cape York Peninsula, he
was fated to win further laurels and the crown of martyrdom.</p>
<p>The passage discovered by Cook is now known as
<i>Endeavour</i> Strait, and is the southmost of the nine
passages through the islands and reefs lying between Australia
and New Guinea recognised as practicable by the modern
cartographers of the Admiralty. The question of its identity with
the passage through which Torres found his way in 1606 has
already been discussed at some length, and there can be no
reasonable doubt that <span class="a">Torres</span> and
<span class="a">Cook</span> deserve the credit of having made
genuine and <span class="a">Distinct Discoveries</span>, although
the existence of a strait was known even before Torres.</p>
<p>Chiefly for the reason that the story of Cook is the best
known of all the Australian explorers, it has been judged
unnecessary to present to the reader anymore than a brief account
of his experiences in the Cape York Peninsula. This chapter may
fitly close with the less known story, "in lighter vein," of how
nearly another than Cook came to being in command of the
"<i>Endeavour</i>."</p>
<p><span class="a">Alexander Dalrymple</span>, a younger brother
of Sir John Dalrymple, Earl of Stair, the famous authority on the
law of Scotland, was an enthusiastic and scientific geographer,
and a shrewd and capable collector, critic and editor of
<i>Voyages</i>. Many important documents came to light through
his industrious researches. He had conducted marine surveys in
the East Indies, and had been present at the capture of Manila by
the British fleet in 1762.</p>
<p>When the Royal Society initiated the project of a Transit of
Venus expedition, Dalrymple was consulted as to the details and
claimed to have actually selected the "<i>Endeavour</i>" as a
suitable vessel. He was nominated as Observer of the transit and
expected to be given command of the ship, and might have received
it had not the conduct of the expedition been turned over to the
Royal Navy. The Naval authorities could not possibly have sent
out tars and marines under the command of a civilian. Dalrymple
was of the merchant service, and the Admiralty put Lieutenant
Cook in command.</p>
<p>This disappointment was never forgotten by Dalrymple during
his long and useful after life. (He was born in 1737 and died in
1808.) The memory of his grievance undoubtedly lent a tinge of
bitterness to his criticism of the explorers of his own time.</p>
<p><span class="a">Commodore</span> (afterwards Admiral)
<span class="a">Byron</span>, in H.M.S. "<i>Dolphin</i>," made a
voyage round the world (1764-6), in the course of which he
devoted a good deal of attention to Patagonia.</p>
<p>In 1766, after Byron's return to England, <span class=
"a">Captain Wallis</span> was sent out with the "<i>Dolphin</i>"
and <span class="a">Captain Cartaret</span> with the
"<i>Swallow</i>" to continue the discoveries made by Byron. The
"<i>Dolphin</i>" parted with the "<i>Swallow</i>" after passing
the Straits of Magellan and subsequently visited Prince Rupert
Island, Whitsun Island, Tahiti, etc., returning to England in
1768. In Tahiti the men of the "<i>Dolphin</i>" made themselves
much at home. The official account of the voyage may be read in
Vol. III of <i>A Collection of Voyages round the World performed
by Royal Authority</i>, London, 1790. A shorter <i>History of
Wallis and Cartaret's Voyage round the World</i> (London, A. Wren
and G. Hodges) hints at dalliance with the ladies, in passages
such as these: "Port Royal, 5th July, 1767.&mdash;The Captain was
entertained by a lady of authority, whom he called his Queen." .
. . "27th July.&mdash;The Queen parted from him with wild
demonstrations of regret. This Island is represented by Captain
Wallis as one of the most pleasant in the universe." It was owing
to the representations of Wallis that Cook was directed to Port
Royal as a favourable locality for the observation of the
transit.</p>
<p><span class="a">Dalrymple</span>, while Cook was prosecuting
his momentous first voyage, issued his admirable <i>Historical
Collection of the Several Voyages and Discoveries in the South
Pacific Ocean</i>, and seized the opportunity of expressing in a
<span class="a">Dedication</span> which is one of the curiosities
of literature, his opinion of Byron, Wallis and another whom I
cannot identify with confidence, and his admiration for an ideal
discoverer.</p>

<p class="height" align="right">JAN. 1, 1770.</p>
<p>I am not prepared to admit the justice of the contemptuous
allusions to Byron and Wallis. If the third person (mentioned
second in order) was Quiros, which his alleged reluctance to go
further than 20&deg; south renders probable, it must be
remembered that Dalrymple, when he wrote in 1770, was, like the
rest of the world, very imperfectly informed as to the
proceedings of Quiros. But whatever may have been the
shortcomings of Quiros (?), Byron and Wallis, to whom the book
was pointedly <span class="a">not</span> dedicated, the
description of the ideal navigator, the man after Dalrymple's own
heart, reads like a pen-portrait of Cook, who was even then,
while Dalrymple wrote with his pen steeped in gall, making the
great discoveries which the writer himself might have made if he
had been given the opportunity. After Cook's return Dalrymple
could not but admit the importance of his discoveries, but a
tendency towards bitterness may still be traced in his
inclinations to belittle the value of the passage between
Australia and New Guinea and the assertion that its discovery had
been forestalled by Torres.</p>

<h3>QUIROS, TORRES AND COOK AND THE VAUGONDY AND DALRYMPLE
MAPS</h3>
<p class="negindent2"><small>Insularity of New Guinea. Known to
the Spanish and Portuguese. Denied by the Dutch. Proved by
Torres, but Proof long withheld from Publicity. Demonstrated by
Cook.</small></p>
<p>W<small>E</small> have seen that, in 1606, <span class=
"a">Pedro Fernandez de Quiros</span> found a harbour which he
named <span class="a">Vera Cruz</span>, on the east side of one
of the islands of the New Hebrides group. Believing the land
adjoining the harbour to be the east coast of the southern
continent, he named the supposed continent <span class="a">La
Australia del Espiritu Santo</span>, and selected a site for its
capital, which was to be called the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Admiral (<i>i.e</i>., Second-in-Command) Luis <span class=
"a">de Vaes Torres</span>, who parted with Quiros at Vera Cruz,
threw a justifiable doubt on Quiros' assumptions and sailed along
the south coast of New Guinea. He thus demonstrated&mdash;though
not for the first time&mdash;the <span class="a">Separation of
New Guinea from Australia</span>, a few months after the Dutch
vessel the "<i>Duyfken</i>" had made a voyage along the southwest
coast of New Guinea and the west coast of Cape York Peninsula,
which voyage left, as far as the Dutch were concerned, the
question of a strait unsettled. In 1623, <span class=
"a">Carstenszoon</span>, in the "<i>Pera</i>" decided that there
was no strait, although the west coast of the Peninsula was
indented with a shallow bight.</p>
<p>Carstenszoon's view as to the connection of New Guinea with
Australia was held by <span class="a">Robert de Vaugondy</span>,
one of the best-informed Geographers of the eighteenth century,
when he and his father, who was Geographer to the King of France,
issued their magnificent <i>Atlas Universel</i>, containing a map
(on a globular projection) dated 1752. The map also showed
Tasmania as a part of Australia, and from Tasmania a "conjectural
coast-line" ran north-eastward to include Vera Cruz and then
west-north-westward to take in the north side of New Guinea,
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> in accordance with Tasman's
ideas on the conclusion of his voyage of 1642-3.</p>
<blockquote>[1) This 1752 map is reproduced in Collingridge's
work, p. 305, but transposed to a plane projection.]</blockquote>
<p>Robert de Vaugondy issued another map (on Mercator's
projection) in 1756, "pour servir de la lecture de l'Histoire des
Terres Australes." This, which is generally known as "Vaugondy's
Map," was on a scale of .15 inch to a degree. It is reproduced on
a slightly smaller scale (.109 inch to a degree) in Bartholomew
and Cramp's Australasian School Atlas of 1915. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> It shows a very distinct expanse of water
between New Guinea and Cape York Peninsula.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The only omission from the reproduction is that
of the legend "Carpentarie en 1644" applied to Cape York
Peninsula, or perhaps more correctly to the whole of the land
supposed to continue eastward to Vera Cruz.]</blockquote>
<p>A comparison of Vaugondy's two maps, therefore, leads to the
conclusion that between 1752 and 1756 the cartographer had become
convinced of, or had strong reason to suspect, the existence of
Torres Strait. What was the source of his information? As the
<i>raison d'etre</i> of the second map was to help in the correct
reading of President du Brosses' work, we naturally turn to that
work for an explanation of the change in Vaugondy's views between
1752 and 1756; and, strange to say, the text only refers to the
connection of New Guinea and the Southern Continent as doubtful.
Perhaps something was known to Vaugondy of which du Brosses was
ignorant. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP
A.</a>)</p>
<br>
<p>In rediscovering Torres Strait in 1770, <span class=
"a">Cook</span> was, in one sense, merely settling a question
which was still open to discussion, although he discovered a
channel distinct from that used by Torres. Had he read Torres'
report of 1607 there would have been no such question for him to
settle. It is possible that Cook was aware of the conclusion
arrived at by Vaugondy between 1752 and 1756, without knowing the
ground on which that conclusion was based.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, it would be well to know at what time
the fact of Torres' passage through the strait (which he does not
claim as a discovery at all) was given to the world, or
"published."</p>
<p>In accordance with the custom and policy of Spain, the report
would be kept a secret as long as possible. Likely enough, as it
so happened that shortly after Torres' voyages Spain's interest
in the South Sea diminished greatly, the report would soon be
forgotten, "pigeon-holed" and lost sight of.</p>
<p><span class="a">Alexander Dalrymple</span> <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> an eminent British Geographer (afterwards
Hydrographer to the Admiralty), published in 1767, an <i>Account
of the Discoveries in the South Pacifck Ocean previous to
1764</i>. The chart accompanying the volume bears the date of
October, 1767, and shows Torres' <i>route</i> between New Guinea
and New Holland, but the text makes no reference to Torres'
adventures.</p>
<blockquote>[2) Born 1737. See Biography in <i>European
Magazine</i> for Nov., 1802. Mitchell Library, A 923, 9
C.]</blockquote>
<p>Dalrymple again, in 1770, issued the same map, with the date
October, 1767, in his <i>Collection of Voyages and Discoveries in
the South Pacific Ocean</i>. Although Volume I is correctly
described as "being chiefly a literal translation from the
Spanish Authors," it contains no reference to Torres' report.</p>
<p>As early as 1774, Dalrymple had claimed, in a letter to the
editor of Cook's Voyages, that he had marked Torres' <i>route</i>
on his map from information contained in Arias' Memorial, and
that he had given a copy of that map to Mr. (afterwards Sir)
Joseph Banks before the latter sailed with Cook in the
"<i>Endeavour</i>" (<i>i.e</i>., before 27th May, 1768).
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> He therefore was quite justified
in assuming that Cook's passage through the strait was
"determined by" that information. It is reasonable to suppose
that Cook took into consideration the probability of there being
a passage, but that he considered it open to doubt as being based
on maps only (Vaugondy's 1756 map and Dalrymple's 1767
map&mdash;probably then in manuscript&mdash;supplied by him to
Banks).</p>
<blockquote>[1) Collingridge, p. 200.]</blockquote>
<p>It is clear that Dalrymple, although he had been in possession
of Torres' Narrative since 1762, had not yet seen, or at any rate
had not yet translated, the narrative of Torres when he furnished
Banks (prior to 27th May, 1768) with a map showing Torres Strait.
He himself states that the information which he had at that date
was taken from Arias' Memorial.</p>
<p>I believe that <span class="a">Torres' Report</span>, written
in 1607, was, to begin with, kept secret by the Spanish
Government, and was then pigeon-holed and forgotten. It need not,
however, be supposed that Torres sent in his report, or
narrative, without keeping a copy, and there is nothing in the
narrative, as given by Dalrymple, to indicate that it was
accompanied by a chart. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> A man
who had a genuine grievance against his government, Torres
probably (perhaps long after 1607) showed, or gave copies of the
narrative and chart to people of importance whom he wished to
interest. It is more than likely that he himself gave some high
officer of the Dutch East India Company at Manila the copy of the
narrative which was found by Alexander Dalrymple in the archives
of the city when it was taken by the British in 1762. It is
probable that a copy of Prado's general chart had come into
Vaugondy's hands between 1752 and 1756, but if a copy of Torres'
own narrative had come into Dalrymple's possession in 1762, he
had evidently not mastered its contents&mdash;perhaps had not
reached it in the course of working through the
translations&mdash;when he published his Collection of Voyages in
1770.</p>
<blockquote>[2) Three very accurate charts of localities on the
south side of New Guinea, all of which are described as having
been discovered by Torres, were made by Captain Prado, Torres'
companion, but they only came to light about 1778. Prado
referred, in a letter dated 24th December, 1613, to a general
chart of the Quiros-Torres Voyage, which has not yet been
discovered. The report of Torres himself bears internal evidence
of having been written at a time when he had not the charts of
his voyage to refer to.]</blockquote>
<p><span class="a">Dr. Jean Luis Arias</span>, acting as the
mouthpiece of a Committee of priests, in a <span class=
"a">Memorial</span> to King Philip III of Spain, exhorted the
King to rise to a sense of the duties of his position and conquer
the Southern Land, to the end that Christianity might be spread,
and, above all, that Dutch and English heretics might be
forestalled. Among the arguments employed are the achievements of
early Spanish navigators (recounted at some length), including
those of Torres.</p>
<p>Internal evidence dates this remarkable document between 1614
(referred to as the year of Quiros' death) and 1621 (when Philip
III died). The Memorial was published in Spanish in Edinburgh,
and translated by Dalrymple, who printed it as an appendix to his
<i>Charts and Memoirs</i> in 1772.</p>
<p>After relating the parting of Quiros and Torres, in 1606, the
memorialist goes on to say:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The Admiral Luis Vaes de Torres being
left in the Bay, and most disconsolate for the loss of the
'<i>Capitano</i>' [Quiros' vessel] resolved to continue the
discovery . . . Finding himself in great straits in 21&deg; S.,
to which high latitude he had persevered in sailing in about a
SW. direction from the 15&deg; or 20&deg; S., in which lay the
aforesaid Baia, he put back to the NW. and NE. up to 14&deg;, in
which he sighted a very extensive coast, which he took for that
of New Guadalcanal. From thence he sailed westwards, having
constantly on the right hand the coast of another very great
land, which he continued coasting, according to his own
reckoning, more than 600 leagues, having it still on the right
hand (in which course may be understood to be comprehended New
Guadalcanal and New Guinea). Along the same course he discovered
a great diversity of islands. The whole country was very fertile
and populous. He continued his voyage on to Bachan and Ternate,
and from thence to Manila, which was the end of his discovery."
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) An English translation is given by R. H. Major in
<i>Early Voyages to Terra Australis</i>. London, Hakluyt Soc.,
1859. Another is printed in the same Society's <i>Voyages of
Quiros</i>, 1904. A portion of it is given by Collingridge, p.
225.]</blockquote>
<p>Had Arias and his colleagues themselves seen Torres' report
they would not have had to conjecture, as they did (and rightly),
that the land which lay on Torres' right hand included New
Guinea, as Torres' report leaves no room for question on the
point. They therefore must have obtained the information at
second hand. The report was almost new&mdash;at the most not
fourteen years old&mdash;and must have been zealously kept a
secret if even priests powerful enough to lecture the King on his
neglect of duty, with impunity, were denied a sight of it.</p>
<p>It was not Torres' report but Arias' summary of it which was
known to Dalrymple in 1768 (although it may have been in his
possession, but still untranslated), and we may believe that it
had already come to the knowledge of Robert de Vaugondy between
1752 and 1756.</p>
<p>Torres' report, or a copy of it, was discovered in the
archives of Manila in 1762. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> It
was first presented to English readers in a translation by
Dalrymple in Captain James Burney's <i>Discoveries in the South
Sea</i>, 1806, Part II, p. 467. The translation is reprinted in
Collingridge, p. 229, where it is more accessible to the general
reader. Captain Burney refers (p. 272) to the manuscript as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>[2) Flinders, <i>Voyage to Terra Australis in 1801,
1802 and 1803</i>. London, 1814. In vol. i. p. 10, Flinders
writes: "Torres, it should appear, took the precaution to lodge a
copy of his letter in the Archives of Manila, for after that town
was taken by the British forces in 1762, Mr. <span class=
"u">Dalrymple</span> found out and drew from oblivion this
interesting document of early discovery; and . . . <span class=
"u">named</span> the passage <span class="u">Torres
Strait</span>."]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote class="inline">"Mr. Dalrymple has in his possession a
copy of the Narrative written by de Torres, of which he has made
an English translation . . . I have to acknowledge the being
favoured with the use of this valuable manuscript."</blockquote>
<p>Although Dalrymple had been in possession of a copy of the
Torres' manuscript since 1762, or shortly thereafter, he was
unaware of its contents in 1768, when he only knew as much of the
doings of Torres as is related in the Arias Memorial.</p>
<p>According to Collingridge (p. 229), Quiros' original narrative
is in the castle of Simancas, near Valladolid. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> The probability is that Dalrymple's copy
was one of those promulgated by Quiros himself, and not the
original, which had been filed in the archives of the State.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The documents in the castle were taken away by
Napoleon and afterwards restored. Collingridge, p. 246. Except
for this interruption, the archives of Castile and Leon have been
preserved in this stronghold since 1563.]</blockquote>

<p>W<small>ILLIAM BLIGH</small> was born in Cornwall about 1753.
He was Sailing Master of the "<i>Resolution</i>" in Captain
Cook's Second Expedition. In 1781 he took part in the naval
action off the Dogger Bank, and next year fought under Howe at
Gibraltar.</p>
<p>The story of the <span class="a">Mutiny of the "Bounty"</span>
has been so often told that it need only be referred to here as
the event which led to Bligh's acquaintance with the Cape York
Peninsula and Torres Strait, which is our immediate concern. His
memorable voyage in the <span class="a">"Bounty's" Launch</span>
brings into prominence the characteristic faults and virtues of
one who was at the same time a capable and courageous navigator
and an insufferable master.</p>
<p>The story is told in two books issued by Bligh. The first may
be referred to, by way of "short title," as the <i>Narrative</i>
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and the second as the
<i>Voyage</i>. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> The
<i>Narrative</i> was written and published with all possible
speed as Bligh's vindication of his conduct, and commences with
the departure of the ship from Otaheite on 4th April, 1789,
reviews the incidents of the mutiny of 29th April, and ends with
Bligh's arrival at Portsmouth on 14th March, 1790. The Voyage
commences with the departure of the "<i>Bounty</i>" from Spithead
on 23rd December, 1788, and includes a revised edition of the
<i>Narrative</i>. (<span class="a">Admiralty Chart</span>, No.
780.)</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>A Narrative of the Mutiny on board His
Majesty's Ship "Bounty," and the Subsequent Voyage of Part of the
Crew in the Ship's Boat, from Tofua, one of the Friendly Islands,
to Timor, written by Lieutenant William Bligh</i>. Illustrated
with Charts. London, 1790.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) <i>A Voyage to the South Seas, undertaken by
command of His Majesty for the Purpose of Conveying the Bread
Fruit Tree to the West Indies, in His Majesty's Ship the
"Bounty," commanded by Lieutenant William Bligh, including an

Voyage of Part of the Crew, in the Ship's Boat, from Tofua, one
of the Friendly Islands, to Timor, a Dutch Settlement in the East
Indies; the Whole illustrated by Charts, etc., Published by
Permission of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty</i>,
London, 1792.]</blockquote>
<p>At Tofua, twenty-five of the mutineers took possession of the
"<i>Bounty</i>" and forced Bligh and eighteen others, loyal to
him, or at least obnoxious to the ringleaders, on board the
ship's launch, and cast them adrift. The names of the men in the
boat were:&mdash;</p>
<div align="center" style=

&mdash;&mdash;. Samuel, Clerk.</div>
<p>Left in this plight, says Bligh:</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"My first determination was to seek a
supply of breadfruit and water at Tofua, and afterwards to sail
for Tonga Taboo, and there risk a solicitation to Poulaho, the
king, to equip our boat and grant us a supply of water and
provisions, so as to enable us to reach the East
Indies."</blockquote>
<p>A stock-taking of the provisions on board furnished a very
brief inventory: "Bread, 150 lb.; Pork, 32 lb.; Wine, 6 bottles;
Empty Barracoes, 4"&mdash;about nine days' rations on a most
economical scale. Three days' foraging in <span class=
"a">Tofua</span> produced only a few coco-nuts and plantains. On
1st May, thirty <span class="a">natives</span> were met with, and
supplied a small quantity of food in exchange for buttons and
beads. Next day, the crew, as they were getting into the boat,
were stoned by 200 natives, John Norton being killed and every
other man being more or less seriously injured. The idea of
seeking aid from the king was abandoned. A fresh stock-taking
showed that 12 lb. of the pork and three bottles of wine had been
consumed: the bread (150 lb.) was intact, and five quarts of rum
were discovered. With this provision, the voyage to Timor,
<i>via</i> New Holland, was commenced on the evening of 2nd May.
The nights were cold; the sea was rough enough to enforce
constant bailing; and there were frequent heavy rains, which at
any rate enabled the unhappy men to catch drinking water. The
rough weather continued till 26th May, and in all the twenty-four
days the only addition to the food supply consisted of three
small birds, two boobies and a noddy. As the boat approached
Australia, birds became comparatively plentiful. On 28th May, the
boat touched the <span class="a">Barrier Reef</span>, but a
passage was found in 12&deg; 51'. The mainland of <span class=
"a">Australia</span> was sighted, as well as an island, which
Bligh named <span class="a">Direction Island</span>.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP C.</a>)</p>
<p>This region is thus described by Bligh:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"As we advanced within the reefs, the
coast began to show itself very distinctly as a variety of high
and low land, some parts of which were covered with wood. In our
way towards the shore, we fell in with a point of a reef which is
connected with that towards the sea [the shoals south of
<span class="u">Chapman Island</span>, which are almost connected
with the '<span class="u">Frederick Patches</span>' to the
east.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] and here we came to a
grapnel, and tried to catch fish, but had no success. The
<span class="u">Island Direction</span> at this time lay about 4
miles to the W. by N. and appeared eligible for a resting-place,
if for nothing more; but on our approaching to the nearest island
[Ashton Rock?&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] it proved to
be only a heap of stones, and its size too inconsiderable to
shelter the boat. We therefore proceeded to the next
[<span class="u">Rocky Island</span>, 130 feet high, and
presumably what Bligh named Direction Island, from the
circumstance of its being where he picked up his
bearings.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>], which was close
to it and towards the main. On the north-west side of this
island, I found a bay, and a fine sandy point to land at. Our
distance was about a quarter of a mile from a projecting part of
the main [<span class="u">Villis Point</span>?&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>], which bore from SW. by S. to NNW.&frac34;W.,
we landed [presumably on the mainland south of Villis
Point.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] to examine if there
were any signs of the natives . . . We saw some old fireplaces,
but nothing to make me apprehend that this would be an unsafe
situation."</blockquote>
<p>The tide was low, and by this time it was nearly dark. Oysters
were found, and some of the party spent the night on shore.</p>
<p>Next morning (29th May), the boat passed what is now known as
<span class="a">Cape Direction</span>, and ran the chord of the
arc of <span class="a">Lloyd Bay</span> (20 miles), making for
the furthest visible point of land, which proved on closer
acquaintance to be an island. Bligh took its latitude at noon,
12&deg; 39' (12&deg; 37&frac12;' really, but near enough for
identification). (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP
B.</a>) The men dug and got water; found oysters in abundance;
made a fire with a magnifying glass; and indulged in a generous
stew of oysters and palm tops. "This day," says Bligh, "being the
anniversary of the restoration of King Charles II, and the name
not being inapplicable to our present situation (for we were
restored to fresh life and strength), I named this <span class=
"a">Restoration Island</span>."</p>
<p>Being now, as he thought, in a land flowing with water and
edibles, Bligh felt himself justified in distributing the
remainder of the pork. Next morning (30th May), after prayers, he
resumed the voyage to the north. As the men bent to the oars,
they saw, on the mainland, a crowd of <span class=
"a">natives</span>, who were armed with spears and wimmeras, and
who invited them to come ashore; but the invitation was
declined.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"I directed my course," continues
Bligh, "within two small islands [Blue Bell
Rocks?&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] that lie to the N.
[NNW.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] of Restoration Island,
passing between them and the mainland towards Fair Cape
[<span class="u">Weymouth Bay</span>, which extends from
Restoration Island to Fair Cape.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>] . . . I was abreast of it [<span class=
"u">Fair Cape</span>] by 8 o'clock. The coast we passed was high
and woody [<span class="u">Carron
Range</span>.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]. As I could
see no land beyond Fair Cape, I concluded that the coast inclined
to the NW. and WNW. I therefore steered more towards the W.; but
by 11 o'clock at night we met with low land which inclined to the
NE.; and at 3 o'clock in the morning [Sunday, 31st May], I found
that we were embayed [He had met with the promontory of
<span class="u">Cape Grenville</span>, which is the northern
limit of <span class="u">Temple Bay</span>, the southern being
Fair Cape.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>], which obliged us
to stand back for a short time to the southward."</blockquote>
<p>When daylight came (Sunday, 31st May), it was found that the
aspect of the country had completely changed.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"There was now," says Bligh," a low
sandy coast, with very little verdure, or anything to indicate
that it was at all habitable to a human being, except a few
patches of small trees or brushwood [the heathy swamp land,
interspersed with sandhills, between the Macmillan River and
Temple Bay.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]. Many small
islands [<span class="u">Cockburn
Islands</span>.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] were in
sight to the NE., about 6 miles distant. The east part of the
main [<span class="u">Cape Grenville</span>.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>] bore N., 4 miles, and <span class="u">Fair
Cape</span> SSE., 5 or 6 leagues. I took the channel between the
nearest island and the mainland [<span class="u">Cape
Grenville</span>.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] which were
all about a mile apart, leaving all the islands on the starboard
side. Some of these were very pretty spots, covered with wood and
well situated for fishing. Large shoals of fish were about us,
but we could not catch any. In passing this strait, we saw
another party of <span class="u">indians</span>, seven in number,
running towards us, shouting and making signs for us to land.
Some of them waved green branches of the bushes which were near
them, as a token of friendship; but some of their other motions
were less friendly. A little further off, we saw a larger party,
who likewise came towards us. I therefore determined not to land,
though I much wished to have had some intercourse with these
people. Nevertheless, I laid the boat close to the rocks, and
beckoned them to approach; but none of them would come within 200
yards of us. An island [<span class="u">Sunday Island</span>] of
a good height [157 feet] bore N. W., 4 miles from us, at which I
resolved to land, and from thence to take a look at the coast. At
this isle we arrived about 8 o'clock in the morning. The shore
was rocky, but the water was smooth, and we landed without
difficulty. I sent two parties out, one north and the other
south, to seek for supplies, and others I ordered to stay by the
boat. On this occasion, fatigue and weakness so far got the
better of their sense of duty that some of the people expressed
their discontent at having worked harder than their companions,
and declared that they would rather be without their dinner than
go in search of it. One person in particular went so far as to
tell me, with a <span class="u">mutinous look</span>, that he was
as good a man as myself. It was not possible for me to judge
where this might have an end, if not stopped in time; therefore,
to prevent such disputes in future, I determined either to
preserve my command or die in the attempt; and, seizing a
cutlass, I ordered him to take hold of another and defend
himself; on which he called out that I was going to kill him, and
immediately made concessions. I did not allow this to interfere
further with the harmony of the boat's crew, and everything
became quiet."</blockquote>
<p>The parties collected oysters and clams and a few small fish,
and water enough for their requirements. Bligh himself climbed to
the highest peak (157 feet), and named the scene of the
disturbance <span class="a">Sunday Island</span>. On rejoining
the boat, he steered NW. by N., in which direction he saw a small
"key," alongside which he grappled at night. At dawn on the
following day (Monday, 1st June), he landed, and named
<span class="a">Lagoon Key</span>. This was the south-western of
Cook's <span class="a">Bird Islands</span>. He observed the
shells and tracks of turtles, but the only edibles collected were
clams and dolichos (beans). The ruins of a native dwelling were
observed.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"After 8 o'clock, Mr. Samuel and Mr.
Peckover went out to watch for turtle, and three men went to the
east [north-east] key to endeavour to catch birds. All the
others, complaining of being sick, took their rest, except Mr.
Heywood [Hayward] and Mr. Elphinston, whom I directed to keep
watch. About midnight, the bird party returned, with only 12
noddies, birds which I have already described to be about the
size of pigeons; but if it had not been for the folly and
obstinacy of one of the party, Robert Lamb, (This man, when he
went to Java, acknowledged he had eaten nine birds raw after he
separated from his two companions), who separated from the other
two and disturbed the birds, they must have caught a great
number. I was so much provoked at my plans being thus defeated
that I gave the offender a good beating. I now [Tuesday, 2<i>nd
June</i>] went in search of the turtling party, who had taken
great pains, but without success."</blockquote>
<p>The party embarked at dawn on Tuesday, 2nd June, and set a
course N. by W. In about two leagues, the sea became very rough,
from which Bligh inferred that he was opposite an open channel in
the Barrier Reef. Beyond this there was a large shoal, (V Reef),
on which were two sandy keys. Between these keys and two others,
4 miles to the west (<span class="a">Hannibal</span> and
<span class="a">Bushy Islands</span>), Bligh passed on his way
northward. His journal continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Towards noon, I fell in with six
other keys [<span class="u">Boydong Cays</span> and <span class=
"u">Halfway Island</span>.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>],
most of which produced some small trees and brushwood. These
formed a pleasing contrast with the mainland we had passed, which
was full of sandhills, and the northmost land . . . appeared like
downs, sloping towards the sea. Nearly abreast of us was a
flat-topped hill, which, on account of its shape, I called
<span class="u">Pudding Pan Hill</span>, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> and a little to the north were two other
hills which we called <span class="u">The Paps</span>, and here
was a small tract of country without sand, the eastern part of
which forms a cape [<span class="u">Orford
Ness</span>.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>], whence the
coast inclines to the NW. by N." [<span class="u">See</span>
<a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) The tragic events which followed Kennedy's
mistaking a similar sandstone-capped hill, 50 miles to the south,
for Pudding Pan Hill, are related in a subsequent
chapter.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>At noon, Bligh observed the latitude of 11&deg; 18' S., the
Cape bearing W., at an estimated distance of 10 miles. A few
miles further, "five small keys bore W. [SW.?], distant 4 miles.
My course from the Lagoon Island had been N.&frac12;W., distance
30 miles."</p>
<p>This day the gunner's watch was lost, so that, as Bligh
remarked, "sunrise, noon and sunset for the future were the only
points of time accurately known."</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"At 5 p.m.," continues Bligh,
"steering to the NW., we passed a large and fair inlet
[<span class="u">Escape River</span>, in 10&deg; 58'.&mdash;R. L.
J.], into which, I imagine, there is a safe and commercial
entrance. It lies in lat. 11&deg; S. About three leagues
[miles?&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] to the north of
this, is an island, at which we arrived about sunset, and took
shelter for the night under a sandy point which was the only part
we could land at . . . The island was covered with wood, but in
other respects it was a lump of rock.<br>
<br>
"<i>Wednesday</i>, 3<i>rd June</i>. We lay at grapnel till
daylight. The main bore from SE. by S. to NNW. &frac12;W., 3
leagues; and a mountainous island with a flat top [<span class=
"u">Mount Adolphus Island</span>.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>] N. by W., 4 or 5 leagues, between which and
the mainland were several other islands. The spot we were at,
which I call <span class="u">Turtle Island</span> [He grappled to
the island on Tuesday night, and therefore it would be his
<span class="u">Tuesday Island</span>.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>], lies in latitude, by account, 10&deg; 52' S.
[say, 10&deg; 55' S.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>].
Abreast of it, the coast has the appearance of a sandy desert,
but improves about 3 leagues further to the northward, where it
terminates in a point, near to which are many small islands. I
sailed between these islands, where I found no bottom at 12
fathoms [He did not take the Albany Pass, in which the greatest
depth is 11 fathoms.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>], the
high mountainous land with a flat top [<span class="u">Mount
Adolphus Island</span>.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] and
four rocks to the SE. of it, that I call the <span class=
"u">Brothers</span>, being on my starboard hand. Soon after, an
extensive opening appeared in the mainland [He evidently
considered Prince of Wales and other high islands to be part of
the mainland.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>], in which were
a number of high islands. I called this the Bay of Islands. We
continued steering to the NW. Several islands [<span class=
"u">Endeavour Strait</span>, across which a chain of islands
(including Cook's Possession Island), stretching westward from
Peak Point, Cape York, to Rattlesnake Point, Prince of Wales
Island.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] and keys were in
sight to the northward. The most northerly island was
mountainous, having on it a very high round hill; and a smaller
was remarkable for a single-peaked hill.<br>
<br>
"The coast to the northward and westward of the Bay of Islands
[<span class="u">Horn</span> and <span class="u">Prince of Wales
Islands</span>.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] is high and
woody, and has a broken appearance, with many islands close to
it, amongst which there are fine bays and convenient places for
shipping. The northernmost of these islands I call <span class=
"u">Wednesday Island</span> [Wednesday, 3rd June, 1789].
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> To the NW. of this, we fell in
with a large reef [<span class="u">North-west
Reef</span>.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>], which, I
believe, joins a number of keys that were in sight from the NW.
to the ENE. We therefore stood to the SW., half a league, when it
was noon, and I had a good observation of the latitude in 10&deg;
31' S. Wednesday Island bore E. by S., 5 miles; the westmost land
in sight [<span class="u">Hammond Island</span>.&mdash;R. L. J.],
SW., 2 or 3 leagues; the islands to the northward from NW. by W.
to NE.; and the reef from W. to NE., distant 1 mile. I was now
tolerably certain that we should be clear of New Holland in the
afternoon.</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) Bligh did not name Tuesday, Thursday or Friday
Islands. He anchored on Tuesday at Turtle Island. After leaving
Wednesday Island on Wednesday, 3rd June, he took the Prince of
Wales Channel and reached Booby Island in the afternoon. The
earliest reference to Thursday Island which has come under my
notice is contained in Lieut. James Grant's <i>Narrative of a
Voyage of Discovery in the "Lady Nelson," 1801-2</i>. London,
1803.]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote class="inline">"I know not how far this reef extends.
It may be a continuation or a detached part of the range of
shoals that surround the coast. I believe the mountainous islands
[<span class="u">Prince of Wales
Island</span>.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] to be
separate from the shoals, and have no doubt that near them may be
found good passages for ships. But I rather recommend those who
are to pass this strait from the eastward to take their direction
from the coast of New Guinea. Yet I likewise think that a ship
coming from the southward will find a fair strait in the latitude
of 10&deg; S . . .<br>
<br>
"At 2 p.m., as we were steering towards the westernmost part of
the land in sight, we fell in with some large sandbanks that run
off from the coast. I therefore called this <span class="u">Shoal
Cape</span>. We were obliged to steer to the northward again till
we got round the shoals, when I directed my course to the
west.<br>
<br>
"At 4 o'clock, the westernmost of the islands to the northward
bore N., 4 leagues; Wednesday Island E. by N., 5 leagues; and
Shoal Cape SE. by E., 2 leagues. A small island was seen bearing
W., at which we arrived before dark, and found that it was only a
rock, where boobies resort, for which reason I called it
<span class="u">Booby Island</span>. Here terminated the rocks
and shoals of the north part of New Holland, for, except Booby
Island, no land was seen to the westward of south after 3 o'clock
this afternoon.<br>
<br>
"I find that Booby Island was seen by Captain Cook, and, by a
remarkable coincidence of ideas, received from him the same name;
but I cannot with certainty reconcile the situation of some parts
of the coast that I have seen to his survey. I ascribe this to
the various forms in which land appears when seen from the
different heights of a ship and a boat.<br>
<br>
"The chart which I have given is by no means meant to supersede
that made by Captain Cook, who had better opportunities than I
had and was in every respect properly provided for surveying. The
intention of mine is chiefly to render this narrative more
intelligible, and to show in what manner the coast appeared to me
from an open boat. I have but little doubt but that the opening
which I have named the <span class="u">Bay of Islands</span> is
<span class="u">Endeavour Strait</span>S; and that our track was
to the northward of Prince of Wales Isles. Perhaps, by those who
may hereafter navigate these seas, more advantage may be derived
from the possession of both our charts than from either of them
singly."</blockquote>
<p>Without landing on <span class="a">Booby Island</span>, Bligh
left it late on 3rd June. He reached <span class=
"a">Koepang</span>, Timor, on 14th June, 1789, and having
obtained a passage to Europe on a Dutch vessel, landed at
<span class="a">Portsmouth</span> on 14th March, 1790. Nine of
the mutineers found their way to Pitcairn Island, where they
married native women and founded a colony, which is still in
existence. The fate of the other sixteen is bound up with the
voyage and wreck of the frigate "<i>Pandora</i>" to which a
chapter must be devoted.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> "<i>Pandora</i>" a frigate carrying 160 men
and 24 guns, was commanded by <span class="a">Captain</span>
(afterwards Admiral) <span class="a">Edward Edwards</span>. Her
commission was to capture and bring to punishment the mutineers
who had seized the "<i>Bounty</i>" one of His Majesty's ships of
war, and turned her Captain and his adherents adrift in an
unvictualled open boat.</p>
<p>The fullest record of this voyage is the narrative of the
Surgeon, George Hamilton. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Next
in importance as regards detail, though probably more reliable as
to the navigation, are the Commander's Reports to the Admiralty,
especially one dealing with the wreck on the Barrier Reef and the
subsequent passage of the survivors, in four boats, through
Torres Strait. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> Then a Chart of
the Voyage, up to the date of the wreck, was constructed by
Lieutenant Hayward, and was published in 1798 by Alexander
Dalrymple. From the above materials, Flinders compiled a short
account of the voyage for his introductory chapter of <i>Terra
Australis</i> (I, XVI). On his own chart, he copied the
<i>route</i>, as far as the wreck, from Dalrymple; but he frankly
admitted that, as regards the boat voyage, the imperfection of
the narrative had baffled his editorial capacity. No serious
attempt to identify the <i>route</i> followed by the boats
appears to have been made up to 1915, when Basil Thomson,
<b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> formerly of the Colonial Service
and Acting Prime Minister of Tonga, reprinted and edited the

<p>The "<i>Pandora</i>" left Portsmouth in August, 1790, and
reached <span class="a">Tahiti</span> on 23rd March, 1791. Here
sixteen of the <span class="a">mutineers</span> had settled down,
but two had already been killed by the natives. The fourteen
remaining were arrested and confined on board the
"<i>Pandora</i>". The frigate left Tahiti on 8th May, and after
having made some search (without having any clue) for the
"<i>Bounty</i>" continued her voyage, <i>via</i> Palmerston
Island, Atafu, Samoa, the Friendly Islands and Tongatabu, Wallis
Island, the Santa Cruz Islands and Indispensable Reefs, to the
Great Barrier Reef. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-a">MAP A.</a>) The latter was met with on 26<i>th
August</i> <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> in about 10&deg; S.
lat. Steering westward, the <span class="a">Murray Island</span>S
were seen and named. The islands were found to be fringed by a
reef, which forced the ship to take a southerly course,
interrupted by many attempts to find a westerly passage. The last
of these attempts was made on 29<i>th August</i> late in the
afternoon, when the ship grounded on the reef in about 11&deg;
24' S. lat. The spot is now charted as <span class="a">Pandora
Entrance</span>. The "<i>Pandora</i>" was hammered on the reef
during the whole of the night, but at daylight next morning
(30<i>th August</i>) slipped over into deep water and
<span class="a">sank</span>. Thirty-one of the ship's company and
four of the mutineers were drowned. Ninety-nine men answered the
rollcall and found temporary refuge on a sandbank about four
miles from the wreck. Very little could be saved and the party
were almost destitute of provisions. It may be assumed, however,
that the Captain saved his sextant and charts and that each of
the boats carried a compass. A reference by Hamilton to the
boat's position "at meridian" makes it probable that Lieutenant
Larkin, on the "red yawl," had a sextant.</p>
<blockquote>[1) I correct the dates from this point onward.
Captain Edwards had lost a day in sailing round the world, but he
did not make the correction till he reached
Timor.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>From this point it is necessary to compare the reports of the
Commander and Surgeon, remembering always that the two witnesses
were in different boats, which parted company for a time.</p>
<h4>CAPTAIN EDWARDS</h4>
<blockquote class="inline">"On the 1st September, 1791, the
<span class="u">boats</span> were completed and were launched,
and we put everything we had saved on board of them, and at
half-past ten on the forenoon we embarked . . . We steered NW. by
W. and WNW., within the reef. This channel through the reef is
better than any hitherto known, besides the advantage it has of
being situated further to the north, by which many difficulties
would be avoided when within the reef. In the run from thence to
the entrance of <i>Endeavour</i> Straits, there is a small white
island or key on the larboard end of the channel, which lies in
latitude 11&deg; 23' S. The sides are strong and irregular.<br>
<br>
"On the 2nd September, in the morning, saw land, which probably
was the coast of <span class="u">New South Wales</span>. The
yawls were sent on shore to ground [sound?] and look out. They
saw ['on entering a very fine bay,' according to Hamilton] a run
of water, landed and filled their two barricois, which were the
only vessels of consequence they had with them, [What follows is
the narrative of Captain Edwards in the pinnace, the Surgeon,
with the yawls, having taken a more southerly course, almost
west, for the nearest land.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>],
and I steered for an island called by Lieutenant Bligh
<span class="u">Mountainous Island</span> [Mount Adolphus
Island.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>], and when
<span class="u">joined by the boats</span> ran into a bay of that
island [on 3rd September] . . ."</blockquote>
<h4>SURGEON HAMILTON</h4>
<blockquote class="inline">"Everything being ready on the
following day, 1st September, at 12 o'clock [10.30 a.m.,
Captain], we embarked in our little squadron, each boat having
been previously supplied with the latitude and longitude of the
island of Timor, 1,100 miles from this place. Our order of
sailing was as follows:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"<i>In the Pinnace.</i> <span class="u">Captain Edwards</span>;
Lt. Hayward; Mr. Rickards, Master's Mate; Mr. Packer, Gunner; Mr.
Edmonds, Captain's Clerk; Three Prisoners; Sixteen Privates.<br>
<br>
"<i>In the Red Yawl.</i> Lt. Larkin; <span class="u">Mr. George
Hamilton, Surgeon</span>; Mr. Reynolds, Master's Mate; Mr.
Matson, Midshipman; Two Prisoners; Eighteen Privates.<br>
<br>
"<i>In the Launch.</i> Lt. Corner; Mr. Gregory Bentham, Purser;
Mr. Montgomery, Carpenter; Mr. Bowling, Master's Mate; Mr.
McKendrick, Midshipman; Two Prisoners; Twenty-four Privates.<br>
<br>
"<i>In the Blue Yawl.</i> Mr. George Passmore, Master; Mr.
Cunningham, Boatswain; Mr. James Innes, Surgeon's Mate; Mr.
Fenwick, Midshipman; Three Prisoners; Fifteen Privates.<br>
<br>
"As soon as we embarked, we laid the oars upon the thwarts, which
formed a platform, by which means we stowed two tiers of men. A
pair of wooden scales was made in each boat, and a musket-ball
weight of bread served to each man.<br>
<br>
"At meridian, we saw a key, bounded with white craggy rocks. As
the principal part of our subsistence was in the launch, it was
necessary to keep together, both for our defence and support. We
towed each other during the night and at daybreak cast off the
tow-line.<br>
<br>
"At 8 in the morning [2nd September] the red and blue yawls were
sent ahead to sound and investigate the coast of New South Wales
and to search for a watering place. The country had been
described as very destitute of the article of water; but on
entering a very fine bay [Orford Bay.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>] we found most excellent water rushing from a
spring at the very edge of the beach. Here we filled our bellies,
a tea kettle and two quart pots. The pinnace and launch had gone
too far ahead to observe any signal of our success, and
immediately we set sail after them. The coast has a very barren
aspect, and from the appearance of the soil and land, looks like
a country abounding with minerals.<br>
<br>
"As we passed round the bay [towards Usher Point, west of Gilmore
Bank.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] two <span class=
"u">canoes</span>, with three black men in each, put off and
paddled very hard to get near us. They stood up in the canoes,
waved, and made signs for us to come to them. But as they were
perfectly naked, had a very savage aspect, and having heard an
indifferent account of the <span class="u">natives</span> of that
country, we judged it prudent to avoid them.<br>
<br>
"In two hours we joined the pinnace and launch, which were lying
to for us. At 10 at night, we were alarmed with the dreadful cry
of 'Breakers ahead.' We had got amongst a reef of rocks; and in
our present state, being worn out and fatigued, it is difficult
to say how we got out of them, as the place was fraught with
dangers all round . . . After running along, we came to an
inhabited island, from which we promised ourselves a supply of
water. [It was evidently daylight, and therefore 3rd
September.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] On our approach,
the <span class="u">natives</span> flocked down to the beach in
crowds . . . We made signals of distress to them for something to
drink which they understood; and on receiving some trifling
presents . . . they brought us a cag of good water, which we
emptied in a minute, and then sent if back to be filled again.
They, however, would not bring it the second time, but put it
down on the beach and made signs to us to come on shore for it.
This we declined, as we observed the women and children running
and supplying the men with bows and arrows. In a few minutes,
they let fly a shower of arrows amongst the thick of us. Luckily,
we had not a man wounded; but an arrow fell between the Captain
and Third Lieutenant and went through the boat's thwart and stuck
in it. We immediately discharged a volley of muskets at them,
which put them to flight. There were, however, none of them
killed. We now abandoned all hopes of refreshment here. This
island lies contiguous to Mountainous Island [Mount Adolphus
Island.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]. It may be observed
that the channel through the reef is better than any hitherto
known. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> We ascertained the
latitudes with the greatest accuracy and exactness."</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) Evidently an interpolation, being practically a
quotation from the Captain's log, which Mr. Hamilton probably saw
at Batavia. R. L. T.]</blockquote>
<p>The writer goes on to advise the Government to plant pines and
coco-nut palms as landmarks.</p>
<h4>CAPTAIN EDWARDS</h4>
<blockquote class="inline">"I steered for an island called by
Lieutenant Bligh Mountainous Island, and when joined by the boats
[2nd September] ran into a bay of that island [3rd September,
<span class="u">Mount Adolphus Island</span>.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>], where we saw <span class="u">indians</span>
on the beach. The water was shoal, and the Indians waded off to
the boats. I gave them some presents and made them sensible that
we were in want of water. They brought us a vessel filled with
water, which had been given them for the purpose, and they
returned to fill it again. They used many signs to signify they
wished us to land, but we declined their invitation from motives
of prudence.<br>
<br>
"Just as a person was entering the water with the second vessel
of water, an arrow was discharged at us by another person, which
struck my boat on the quarter, and perceiving that they were
collecting bows and arrows, a volley of small arms was fired at
them, which put them to flight. I did not think proper to land
and get water by force, as land was seen at that time in
different directions, which by appearance was likely to produce
that article, and which I flattered myself we might be able to
procure without being drove to that extremity. I therefore ran
close along the shore of this island and landed at different
places at some distance from the former situation. I also landed
at another island near it, which I called <span class="u">Plum
Island</span> [Thomson's footnote: '<span class="u">Tree
Island</span>.' Possibly <span class="u">Little Adolphus Island.
R.L.J</span>.], from its producing a species of that fruit, but
we were unsuccessful in finding the article we were in search of
and in so much want of.<br>
<br>
"In the evening [3rd September] we steered for the islands which
we supposed were those called by Captain Cook the <span class=
"u">Prince of Wales Islands</span>, and before midnight came to a
grapnel . . . near one of these islands, in a large sound formed
by several of the surrounding islands, to several of which we
gave names, and called the sound <span class="u">Sandwich
Sound</span>. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> It is fit for the
reception of ships, having from 5 to 7 fathoms of water. There is
plenty of wood on most of the islands, and by digging we found
very good water [in the morning of 4th September. <span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>] on the flat part of a large island which I
called <span class="u">Lafory's Island</span> [Basil Thomson's
Note: <span class="u">Horn Island</span>], situated on the
larboard hand as we entered the sound from the eastward. We saw a
burying-place and several wolves [Basil Thomson's Note:
'Dingoes'] near the watering-place, but we saw no natives. Here
we filled our several vessels with water and made two canvas
bags, in which we also put water, but with this assistance we had
barely the means to take a gallon of water for each man in the
boats. We sent our kettles on shore and made tea and portable
broth, and a few oysters we picked off the rocks, with which we
made a comfortable meal, indeed the only one which we had made
since the day before we left the ship."</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[2) Basil Thomson's Note: "Now called Prince of Wales
Channel. It is the best channel through Torres Straits, and if
Edwards' narrative had been published, his discovery would
doubtless have been perpetuated in his name."]</blockquote>
<br>
<h4>SURGEON HAMILTON</h4>
<blockquote class="inline">"3rd September. We steered from these
hostile savages to other islands in sight, and sent some armed
men on shore . . . without success. This island we called
<span class="u">Plumb Island</span>, from its bearing an austere,
astringent kind of fruit, resembling plumbs, but not fit to
eat.<br>
<br>
"In the evening, we steered for these islands which we supposed
were called the <span class="u">Prince of Wales Islands</span>,
and about 2 o'clock in the morning [4th September. 'Before
midnight,' says the Captain], came to anchor, with a grappling,
alongside of an island, which we called <span class="u">Lafory's
Island [Horn Island</span>]. As the night was very dark, and this
was the last land that could afford us relief, all hands went to
sleep.<br>
<br>
"The morning [4th September] was ushered in with the howling of
<span class="u">wolves</span>, who had smelt us in the night . .
. Lieutenant Corner and a party were sent at daylight to search
again for water; and, as we approached, the wild beasts retired
and filled the woods with their hideous growling."</blockquote>
<p>Water was discovered on digging in a hollow. Signs of recent
human presence were also observed.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"After having gorged our parched
bodies with water till we were perfectly waterlogged, we began to
feel the cravings of hunger&mdash;a new sensation of misery we
had hitherto been strangers to, from the excess of thirst
predominating. We found a harsh, austere, astringent fruit,
resembling a plumb . . . We permitted the men to fill their
bellies with them. There was also a small berry, of similar taste
to the plumb . . . We carefully avoided shooting at any bird,
lest the report . . . should alarm the natives, whom we had every
reason to suspect were at no great distance . . . When every
other thing was filled with water, the carpenter's boots were
also filled. The water in them was first served out, on account
of leakage.<br>
<br>
"There is a large sound here, to which we gave the name of
<span class="u">Sandwich's Sound</span> [now <span class=
"u">Flinders Passage</span>], and commodious anchorage for
shipping in the bay, to which we gave the name of <span class=
"u">Wolf's Bay</span>, in which there is from 5 to 7 fathoms
water all around. This is extremely well situated for a
<i>rendezvous</i> in surveying <i>Endeavour</i> Straits; and were
a little colony settled here, a concatenation of Christian
settlements would enchain the world and be useful to any
unfortunate ship; . . . or should a rupture take place with South
America, a great vein of commerce might find its way through this
channel.<br>
<br>
"<span class="u">Hammond's Island</span> lies NW. by W.,
<span class="u">Parker's Island [Wednesday Island</span>?] from
N. and by W. to N. and by E., and an island seen to the north
entrance NW. We supposed it to be an island called by Captain
Bligh <span class="u">Mountainous Island</span> [now <span class=
"u">Banks Island</span>.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>],
laid down in latitude 10&deg; 16' S. [The island now charted as
Hammond Island may or may not be the one so named on this
occasion, as the above confused description does not tally with
anything when the bearings are plotted on the modern chart. The
name, however, has been perpetuated, but must be regarded as a
'complimentary' one.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]<br>
<br>
<span class="a">Sandwich's Sound</span> is formed by Hammond's,
Parker's and a cluster of small islands on the stat board hand at
its eastern entrance. We also called a back land behind Hammond'
s Island and the other islands to the southward of it,
<span class="a">Cornwallis Land</span>. The uppermost part of the
mountain was separated from the main by a large gap. Under the
gap, low land was seen; but whether that was a continuation of
the main or not we could not determine. Near the centre of the
sound is a small, dark-coloured, rocky island. [By a 'back land,'
Hamilton probably meant a land behind the boats, and on this
assumption his <span class="u">Cornwallis Land</span> was
probably <span class="u">Prince of Wales
Island</span>.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]<br>
<br>
"This afternoon, at 3 o'clock, being the 4th of September, our
little squadron sailed again, and in the evening saw a
high-peaked island lying NW., which we called <span class=
"u">Hawkesbury's Island</span> [It rises to 560 feet]. The
passage through the north entrance [<i>i.e</i>., between Flinders
Passage and Prince of Wales Channel.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>] is about 2 miles wide. After passing through
it, saw a reef. As we approached it, we shallowed our water to 3
fathoms; but on hauling up more to the SW. we deepened it again
to 6 fathoms. Saw several large turtle, but could not catch any .
. . After clearing the reef, stood to the westward. Mountainous
Island [<span class="u">Banks Island</span>] bore N.&frac12;E.;
Captain Bligh's <span class="u">West Island</span>, which appears
in three hummocks, NNW.; a rock [<span class="u">Red Wallis
Island</span>] NW., at the SW. extreme of the mainland, S. and by
E.; and the <span class="u">Northernmost Cape of New South
Wales</span> SSE. [Not really Cape York, but the projecting hump
of land west of the mouth of the Jardine River and south of
Cook's Possession Island.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>];
and to the extreme of the land in sight, the eastward E.JN., a
small distance from the nearest of the Prince of Wales Islands,
we discovered another island, and which we called <span class=
"u">Christian's Island</span>. Saw two hummocks [<span class=
"u">Duncan Islands</span>, or <span class="u">Phipps</span> and
<span class="u">Spencer Islands</span>.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>] between Hawkesbury's Island and Mountainous
Island; but could not be certain whether it was one or two
islands.<br>
<br>
"We now entered the great Indian Ocean, and had a voyage of 1,000
miles to undertake in our open boats. As soon as we cleared the
land, we found a very heavy swell running, which threatened
destruction to our little fleet; for should we have separated, we
must inevitably perish for want of water, as we had not utensils
to divide our slender stock. For our mutual preservation, we took
each other in tow again."</blockquote>
<h4>CAPTAIN EDWARDS</h4>
<blockquote class="inline">"On the 4th September, at half-past 3
in the afternoon, we stood out of the north entrance of the sound
<i>i.e.</i>, out of <span class="u">Flinders Passage</span> into
<span class="u">Prince of Wales
Channel</span>.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]. Before 5,
we saw a reef extending from the N. to the WNW., and which
appeared to run in the latter direction, or more to the westward
[<span class="u">North-west Reef</span>], On the edge of this
reef, we had 3&frac34; fathoms of water, and after hauling to the
southwest we soon deepened our water to 5 fathoms. Besides
Mountainous and West Islands, seen by Lieutenant Bligh, we saw
several other islands between the north and the west, one of
which I called <span class="u">Hawkesbury Island</span> . . .<br>
<br>
"In the evening, we saw the <span class="u">Northernmost
Extremity of New South Wales</span> [really the hump of land west
of the mouth of the Jardine River.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>], which forms the south side of
<i>Endeavour</i> Straits. At night the boats took each other in
tow and we steered to the westward.<br>
<br>
"It is unnecessary to retail our particular sufferings in the
boats during our run to <span class="u">Timor</span>, and it is
sufficient to observe the company suffered more from heat and
thirst than from hunger, and that our strength was greatly
decreased. We fortunately had good weather."</blockquote>
<p>Surgeon Hamilton states that "we ascertained the latitudes
with the greatest accuracy and exactness," a claim which he would
hardly have made on his own account, and which, it may be
conjectured, he simply copied from the Captain's log, of which
the latter evidently made only a short abstract for his reports
to the Admiralty. Nor, I imagine, would the Captain himself have
made such a claim unless he had been provided with a sextant. The
Captain gives the position of <span class="u">Murray
Islands</span> as 9&deg; 57' S. and 216&deg; 43' W = 143&deg; 17'
E.; and the <span class="a">Wreck Reef</span> is also given in
his table, but the figures are left blank. The Surgeon gives the
same position to the Murray Islands, and fills in the blank at
the Wreck Reef with the figures 11&deg; 22' S. and 216&deg; 22'
W. = 143&deg; 38' E. The inference is that he copied from the
Captain's log, and set down, without question, <i>data</i>
regarding which the Captain himself had some doubt, so that he
omitted them from his report.</p>
<p>After many attempts at plotting from Hamilton's <i>data</i>,
on various hypotheses as to his meaning, I can no more make head
or tail of the positions of the islands and other landmarks
mentioned by him than could Flinders, although I had the
advantage of more complete charts than were accessible to, or
made by, Flinders. One hypothesis, suggested by the Surgeon's
tale, which I tried by all possible tests, was that the boats
went through <i>Endeavour</i> Strait; but this is flatly
contradicted by the Captain's narrative. I am satisfied,
therefore, that Basil Thomson is correct in supposing that the
"Sound" referred to by both Captain and Surgeon was neither
<i>Endeavour</i> Strait as a whole nor the passage between
Entrance Island and Prince of Wales Island, but the strait
between Horn and Wednesday Islands, now known as Flinders
Passage. Edwards thus anticipated Flinders (in the
"<i>Cumberland</i>") by twelve years. The island named
<span class="a">Lafory's</span> was, no doubt, as suggested by
Basil Thomson, <span class="a">Horn Island</span>, and the
"wolves" which Edwards saw and Hamilton heard must have been
<span class="a">dingoes</span>. This is the only mention of the
dingo as an indigenous inhabitant of the Torres Strait Islands
which I have met with.</p>
<p>Edwards, then, took the "<i>Pandora's</i>" boats through the
<span class="a">Flinders Passage</span>, and was actually its
discoverer, rounded the north end of <span class="a">Hammond
Island</span> <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> entered the
<span class="a">Prince of Wales Channel</span> and passed through
its western half. The first to enter the Prince of Wales Channel
was <span class="a">Gonzal</span>, in the "<i>Rijder</i>" in
1756. <span class="a">Bligh</span>, in the "<i>Bounty's</i>"
launch, in 1789, was the first to traverse it from end to
end.</p>
<blockquote>[1) He gave the name of Hammond to some island
hereabouts, but his narrative does not make it clear that it was
the island now known by this name.]</blockquote>
<p>Endeavouring to maintain a westerly course through the
Channel, Edwards encountered the "<span class="a">North-west
Reef</span>," and was forced by it southwards, nearly to Good
Island, before he found an open sea by which he could make
westward for Timor.</p>
<p>On emerging from the strait, a last glimpse of Australian land
was obtained, S. and by E. Both Edwards and Hamilton refer to
this as the northernmost extremity of New South Wales, Edwards
adding "which forms the south side of <i>Endeavour</i> Straits."
The land visible from the observer's position could not have been
Cape York, which would be shut out by the high Prince of Wales
Island, and must have been the blunt promontory west of the
<span class="a">mouth of the Jardine River</span>.</p>
<p>The provisions with which the boats left the scene of the
wreck were inventoried as "a small barrel of water, a keg of wine
and some biscuit." The ship's cat was saved from the wreck. The
scanty fare was supplemented by shellfish while the party
sojourned among the Torres Strait islands.</p>
<p>The survivors got a passage from Koepang, in <span class=
"a">Timor</span>, to Batavia and thence to Europe. At the Cape of
Good Hope, Edwards and his prisoners were transferred to H.M.S.
"<i>Gorgon</i>." They arrived at Spithead on 19th June, 1792. The
prisoners were tried by court martial, when six were condemned to
death (18th September), and three were executed.</p>
<p>It is beyond the limits of our task to relate the whole story
of the mutiny, one of the most tragic and romantic in modern
history; but the reader who desires to pursue the subject for its
own inherent interest may refer to Sir John Barrow's little book,
<i>The Mutiny of the "Bounty"</i> (the World's Classics, No.
CXCV, 1914).</p>

<p>H<small>AVING</small> reached England after his perilous
voyage in the open boat, following on the mutiny of the
"<i>Bounty</i>" and written his <i>Narrative</i>, <span class=
"a">Bligh</span> was given command of H.M.S. "<i>Providence</i>",
and was accompanied by the brig "<i>Assistant</i>", under
<span class="a">Lieutenant J. Nathaniel Portlock</span>, in a
second expedition having for its object the transference of
breadfruit from Tahiti to the West Indies. He had thus another
opportunity of traversing Torres Strait, and this time he
succeeded in his mission. So far as is known, he wrote no report
on this voyage, but he lodged his charts in the Admiralty Office.
The only available record of the voyage is the journal kept by
<span class="a">Matthew Flinders</span>, who accompanied Bligh as
a junior officer. (<i>Terra Australis</i>, Vol. I, pp. xix. <i>et
seq</i>.}. Bligh's charts, "with other authorities," were
incorporated in Plate XIII of Flinders' Atlas, and the journal
was sanctioned by Bligh, so that there is every reason for
accepting it as authoritative. The expedition left England in
1791. The quotations which follow are from Flinders' Journal.</p>
<p>Having come to the conclusion, when he threaded Torres Strait
in the open boat three years before, that ships attempting the
passage from the east should keep in touch with the New Guinea
coast, Bligh took the "<i>Providence</i>" and "<i>Assistant</i>"
north of his former course. After passing south of the Louisiade
Archipelago and the south-eastern part of New Guinea, he sighted
the <span class="a">reefs</span> which he named after Captain
<span class="a">Portlock</span> on 1st September, 1792. After
seeking vainly for a passage to the south, he steered to the
north till he had cleared the Portlock Reef, when he bore NW. and
SSW. for the high land which he named <span class="a">Darnley
Island</span>, and anchored NE. of the island on 4th September,
1792. He might, had he known the soundings, have set a straight
course SW. for Dalrymple Island, through what is now charted as
"<span class="a">Bligh Entrance</span>," but he did not,
preferring to make for the landmark to which he gave the name of
Darnley. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP
A.</a>)</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"5<i>th September</i>, 1792. Boats
were again sent to sound the passage. Several large sailing
canoes were seen, and the cutter making the signal for
assistance, the pinnace was sent to her, well manned and armed.
On the return of the boats in the afternoon, it appeared that of
four canoes which used their efforts to get up to the cutter, one
succeeded. There were in it 15 <span class="u">indians</span> . .
. and they made signs which were interpreted to be amicable.
These signs the officer imitated, but not thinking it prudent to
go so near as to take a green coco-nut which was held up to him,
he continued rowing for the ship. A man who was sitting upon the
shed erected in the centre of the canoe then said something to
those below, and immediately they began to string their bows. Two
of them had already fitted arrows, when the officer judged it
necessary to fire in his own defence. Six muskets were
discharged, and the Indians fell flat into the bottom of the
canoe, all except the man on the shed. The seventh musket was
fired at him. and he fell also. During this time, the canoe
dropped astern, and the three others having joined her, they all
gave chase to the cutter, trying to cut her off from the ship; in
which they would probably have succeeded had not the pinnace
arrived at that juncture to their assistance. The Indians then
hoisted their sails and steered for Darnley's Island.<br>
<br>
"No boats could have been man&oelig;uvred better in working to
windward than were these long canoes by the naked savages. Had
the four been able to reach the cutter, it is difficult to say
whether the superiority of our arms would have been equal to the
great difference of numbers, considering the ferocity of these
people and the skill with which they seemed to manage their
weapons.<br>
<br>
"6<i>th September</i>. Two boats were sent ahead and the vessels
followed them, between Canoe Key and the reef lying from it half
a mile to the north. After running 12 miles beyond this narrow
pass, they anchored in 13 fathoms, the latitude being 9&deg; 37'
and longitude 143&deg; 41' [east of Tobin Cay.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]. In the afternoon, they proceeded 5 miles
further to the NNW., and Darnley's Island then bore S. 74-75 E.,
2 leagues. Except on the north side, this island appears to be
surrounded with reefs and sandbanks to a considerable distance.
In sailing for [from.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] Canoe
Key, the vessels had left on the larboard hand a long chain of
reefs and banks, at the north end of which were three low woody
islands, the nearest of these, bearing S. 41&deg; W., 2 or 3
miles from the anchorage, was named <span class="u">Nepean
Island</span> . . .<br>
<br>
"This day, several canoes from <span class="u">Darnley
Island</span> came off to both vessels. On approaching, the
Indians clapped upon their heads and exclaimed 'Whou! whou!
whou!' repeatedly, with much vehemence; at the same time they
held out arrows and other weapons, and asked for 'toree, toree,'
by which they meant iron . . . Their arms were bows, arrows and
clubs, which they bartered for every kind of ironwork with
eagerness, but appeared to set little value on anything else . .
.<br>
<br>
"Their canoes are about 50 feet in length, and appear to have
been hollowed out of a single tree . . . These vessels are low
forward, but rise abaft, and being narrow are fitted with an
outrigger on each side to keep them steady. A raft, of greater
breadth than the canoe, extends over about half the length, and
upon this is fixed a shed or hut, thatched with palm leaves.
These people, in short, appeared to be dextrous sailors and
formidable warriours, and to be as much at ease in the water as
in their canoes.<br>
<br>
"7<i>th September</i>. The boats having found deep water round
the north end of the three low islands, the vessels followed
them, but anchored again soon after noon, in lat. 9&deg; 31' and
long. 143&deg; 31', being sheltered by the two western
<span class="u">islands</span>, named <span class=
"u">Stephens'</span> and <span class="u">Campbell's</span>, and
the reefs which surround them . . .<br>
<br>
"8<i>th September</i>. The vessels steered westward . . . No land
or other obstruction had been seen in that quarter, but at 10
o'clock they were forced to haul the wind to the southward, their
course being impeded by reefs, upon one of which was <span class=
"u">Pearce's Sandy Key</span>. At noon they had anchored in 15
fathoms under the lee of <span class="u">Dalrymple's
Island</span>, the westernmost before seen; but two other islands
were then visible in the S. by W . . . The latitude here was
9&deg; 37' and longitude 143&deg; 31'-143&deg; 15'E. In the
afternoon, <span class="u">natives</span> came out from the beach
and exchanged ornaments and plums for iron. A moderate-sized dog,
of a brown chestnut colour, was observed amongst the party."<br>
<br>
"9<i>th September</i>. The ships still followed the boats,
"between the cluster of islands to the southward and an extensive
reef to the west. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> . . . At noon,
the lat. was 9&deg; 48', long. 143&deg; 6', and two other islands
came in sight to the westward. Before 2 o'clock, an extensive
reef, partly dry, to which the name of Dungeness was given, made
it necessary to heave to until the boats had time to sound; after
which Captain Bligh bore away along the north side of the reef,
and anchored a mile from it . . . In this situation <span class=
"u">Dungeness Island</span>, which is low and woody, bore N.
64-87&deg; W., 3 miles, and a small sandy isle, named
<span class="u">Warriour's Island</span>, N. 6-1&deg; W., 4 miles
. . . Besides these, there were other low isles, called the
<span class="u">Six Sisters</span>, in sight to the SE., and a
long fiat island, bearing S. 33-46&deg; W., over the dry
Dungeness Reef. In the west also there were islands visible, at a
greater distance, and much higher, than the others. The strait,
instead of becoming clearer, seemed to be more and more
embarrassed with dangers as the vessels proceeded westward. The
latitude of this anchorage was 9&deg; 50&frac12;' S. and
longitude 142&deg; 55' E.</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) Warrior Reef&mdash;<span class=

<br>
<blockquote class="inline">"10<i>th September</i>. The boats
sounded the channel [<span class="u">Basilisk Pass</span>, so
named in 1871 by Captain Moresby, of the
"<i>Basilisk</i>."&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] to the
north-west between Dungeness and Warriour's Islands, and finding
sufficient water the vessels got under way at noon to follow
them. There were many <span class="u">natives</span> collected
upon the shore of Dungeness Island, and several canoes from
Warriour's Island were about the brig. Presently Captain Portlock
made the signal for assistance, and there was a discharge of
musketry and some guns from his vessel and from the boats. Canoes
were also coming towards the "<i>Providence</i>" and when a
musket was fired at the headmost, the natives set up a great
shout and paddled forward in a body; nor was musketry sufficient
to make them desist. The second great gun, loaded with grape, was
directed at the foremost of eight canoes, full of men, and the
round shot, after raking the whole length, struck the high stern.
The Indians leaped out and swam towards their companions,
plunging constantly to avoid the musket-balls which showered
thickly about them. The squadron then made off as fast as the
people could paddle, but afterwards rallied at a greater
distance, until a shot which passed over their heads made them
disperse and give up all idea of any further attack.<br>
<br>
"In passing the deserted canoe, one native was observed still
sitting in it. The other canoes afterwards returned to him, and,
with glasses, signals were perceived to be made by the Indians to
their friends on Dungeness Island, expressive, as was thought, of
grief and consternation.<br>
<br>
"No arrows fell on board the "<i>Providence</i>" but three men
were wounded in the '<i>Assistant</i>' and one of them afterwards
died. The depth to which the arrows penetrated into the deck and
sides of the brig was reported to be truly astonishing.<br>
<br>
"The vessels passed between Dungeness and Warriour's Islands
[<span class="u">Basilisk Pass</span>.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>] . . . and anchored at 4 o'clock under the lee
of <span class="u">Dungeness Island</span> and reef. The passage
to the westward then appeared clearer, three high islands bearing
from S. 60&deg; W., 3 leagues, to N. 76&deg; W., 5 leagues,
forming the sole visible obstructions.<br>

Besides the islands above mentioned, there was in sight a
mountainous land, to which the name of <span class=

<br>
<blockquote>[1) Charted as the "Orman Reef, 1816."]</blockquote>
<p>Here the ships lay at anchor for three days, the boats
sounding, while a fresh gale blew from the south-east.</p>

fixed inhabitants upon Possession Island, but from a fire which
had been recently extinguished, and the shells and bones of
turtle scattered about, it was supposed to have been visited not
many days before . . .<br>

several <span class="u">indians</span>, in three canoes, were

<br>
"On the signal being made for good anchorage further on, the
'<i>Assistant</i>' led to the W. by S.; but on reaching the
boats, the bottom was found much inferior to what had been
imagined. The approach of night, however, obliged Bligh to anchor
soon afterwards . . .<br>
<br>
"In this situation, the vessels were so closely surrounded with
rocks and reefs as scarcely to have swinging-room. The bottom was
rocky. The wind blowing a fresh gale, and a tide running between
4 and 5 knots an hour. This anxious night was, however, passed
without accident, and next morning.<br>

not three-quarters of a mile asunder . . .<br>

latitude here was 10&deg; 5', long. 141&deg; 56'. From north
nearly round by the east to S. 8&deg; E., there was a mass of
islands, rocks and reefs, at various distances; but in the
western half of the compass no danger was visible.</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[2) It is now charted as Bligh Channel. There are
very strong grounds for believing that Torres passed through it
in 1606.&mdash;R. L. J.]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote class="inline">"19<i>th September</i>. The wind
moderated, and the vessels steered W. by S. until noon . . . The
latitude was then 10&deg; 8&frac12;' S., longitude by timekeeper
141&deg; 31' E., and no land was in sight; nor did anything more
obstruct Captain Bligh and his associate in their <i>route</i> to
the <span class="u">Island Timor</span>."</blockquote>
<p>After his voyage in the "<i>Bounty</i>," Bligh was promoted to
Commander and afterwards to Post Captain. In 1794, he was Captain
of the 74-gun "<i>Warrior</i>" off Ushant. In 1797, he commanded
the 64-gun "<i>Director</i>" at Camper down and distinguished
himself on the occasion of the mutiny at the Nore. On 21st May,
1801, he commanded the 64-gun "<i>Glatton</i>" at Copenhagen, and
was personally thanked by Nelson.</p>
<p>During the administration of John Hunter and Philip Gidley
King as Governors of New South Wales, the colony had got somewhat
out of hand, chiefly on account of the "rum"-currency, the
usurpation of authority by the New South Wales Corps and
questions arising out of the status of freed convicts. To the
Government in England, it appeared that the only remedy lay in
the appointment of a strict disciplinarian, and his whole career
indicated that Bligh was such a man. He took up the reins in
1806.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Bligh's insistence on discipline,"
says Professor Scott, <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> "was
indeed sufficiently stiff, but unfortunately he was also a
quarrelsome, ill-tempered, coarse-speaking man. His manner of
doing business with those who had to see him was repellent. He
would, with no regard for the dignity of his position, pour forth
a stream of personal abuse, loaded with dire threats; and if he
felt angry with anyone he would blurt out his displeasure, no
matter where he was&mdash;on the parade ground, in the street, in
his own house, or in church. One who had experience of the
Governor in his tantrums wrote that he would not brook
contradiction or protest; 'his features became distorted, he
foamed at the mouth, stamped on the ground, and shook his fist at
the person so presuming.' He was a law unto himself, and he said
so. It can hardly be contended that Bligh's acts were more
arbitrary than those of his predecessors, and he had the same
refractory material to deal with; but his manner soon made him
hated by those who came into personal contact with him, and at
length brought about the mutiny by which he was deposed from
office."</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[3) <i>A Short History of Australia</i>, 1916, p.
66.]</blockquote>
<p>He was deposed and put under arrest on 26th January, 1808, by
the New South Wales Corps, whose officers administered the colony
until the arrival of Governor Macquarie in December, 1809. After
his return to England, Bligh was promoted to the rank of
Rear-Admiral in 1811, and to that of Vice-Admiral in 1814, but he
was never again entrusted with official responsibility. He died
on 7th December, 1817.</p>
<p>A foreign, and therefore presumably unbiassed, estimate of
Bligh's character, that of the Surgeon-Major of the French
warship "<i>La Z&egrave;el&eacute;e</i>" <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> may be given here.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Voyage autour du Monde de l'"Astrolabe" et de
la "Z&egrave;el&eacute;e," sous les ordres du Contre-Amiral
Dumont D'Urville, 1837-40, par Elie Le Guillou.</i> Paris,
1843.]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote class="inline">"He was a sea-wolf, a rude, brutal,
intrepid, indefatigable man. He never slept, and could not bear
that any of his crew should sleep. He was a poor eater, and he
desired that his crew should diet themselves on his scale. All
his words were words of wrath. All his orders were threats. All
his threats were of the lash. The day comes when his crew revolt
and Jay hold of the shark that has no pity. 'Cease your cries!'
say the mutinous sailors. 'We don't want to kill you, but we will
not obey you. We will put the launch in the water, and you in it,
with four sailors, all good swimmers. Then you can beat the waves
with those hands that are always so ready to strike. Farewell,
Bligh, and a good voyage. Here is the compass. Search for and
find . . . "</blockquote>
<p>Such was the imaginary scene conjured up by the dramatic
imagination of the Surgeon while his ship lay fast on a sandbank
in the "Canal Mauvais," near Warrior Island and within a few
miles of Bligh's track, and when it seemed more than likely that
the crews of the "<i>Astrolabe</i>" and
"<i>Z&egrave;el&eacute;e</i>" might have to make for Timor in
open boats, as Bligh had done forty-eight years before.</p>

<p>"T<small>HE</small> last passage known to have been made
through Torres Strait previously to the sailing of the
'Investigator,'" says Flinders (<i>Terra Australis</i>, I, xix)
"was by Messieurs <span class="a">William Bampton</span> and
<span class="a">Matthew Alt</span>, Commanders of the ships
'<i>Hormuzeer</i>' and 'Chesterfield.' Their discoveries were
made public in two charts by Mr. Dalrymple in 1798 and 1799, and
from them, and Captain Bampton's manuscript journal, the south
coast of New Guinea and most of the reefs and islands near it are
laid down in Plate XIII, after having been adjusted to the
observations of Captain Bligh and those subsequently made by me
in the '<i>Investigator</i>' and '<i>Cumberland</i>.' Flinders
then gives an abridgement of <span class="a">Bampton's
Journal</span>, which I further condense.</p>
<p>The "<i>Hormuzeer</i>" and "<i>Chesterfield</i>" sailed from
<span class="a">Norfolk Island</span> with the intention of
passing through <span class="a">Torres Strait</span> by a
<i>route</i> which the Commanders did not know to have been
before attempted. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-a">MAP A.</a>)</p>
<p>Late on 20th June, 1793, <span class="a">Murray Islands</span>
were seen, bearing NW.&frac12;W. The following day the course was
changed to the north. At the point where the change was made, the
latitude was 10&deg; 20'S. and the longitude 144&deg; 50'E.,
according to Flinders. It is doubtful whether it was the
intention of the Commanders to attempt a passage <i>via</i>
Murray Island; but if so, the Boot and Portlock Reefs no doubt
forced them to alter their plans. At noon on the 22<i>nd</i>,
they were in 8&deg; 48' S., and land (<span class="a">New
Guinea</span>) was seen an hour later. An attempt was made to
follow the New Guinea coast and to get away to the north between
New Guinea and the Louisiade Archipelago.</p>
<p>No such passage, however, having been found, and following the
coast of the Gulf of Papua having carried the ships too far east,
it was determined once more to seek a passage through
<span class="a">Torres Strait</span>. From 7&deg; 55' S.,
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> therefore, the ships turned
southward on 26th June. At dawn on 1st July., Bligh's
<span class="a">Darnley Island</span> was in sight, bearing W. by
N.&frac12;N., at an estimated distance of 5 leagues. Next day,
the boats were employed in sounding, and <span class=
"a">natives</span> from Darnley Island (to which the ships were
near enough for coco-nut trees to be seen) approached in canoes
and exchanged bows and arrows for knives, etc.</p>
<blockquote>[1) This latitude is only attainable at the very head
of the Gulf of Papua, between longitudes 144&deg; E. (eastern
mouth of Aird River) and 145&deg; 15' E. (mouth of Alele River.
New Guinea).&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>The following quotations are from <i>Terra Australis</i> (I,
xxxiii <i>et seq</i>.).</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"3<i>rd July</i>. Mr. Shaw, Chief Mate
of the "<i>Chesterfield</i>," Mr. Carter, and Captain Hill, of
the New South Wales Corps, who was a passenger, went away armed,
with five seamen, in a whaleboat, and were expected to return on
the following day; but the 4th, 5th and 6th passed, without any
tidings of them . . .<br>
<br>
"7<i>th July</i>.&mdash;Two boats, manned and armed, under the
command of Mr. Dell, Chief Mate of the '<i>Hormuzeer</i>,' were
sent in search of the whaleboat. On reaching the island, Mr. Dell
heard conch-shells sounding in various parts, and saw eighty or
ninety armed <span class="u">natives</span> upon the shore. To
the inquiries, by signs, after the missing boat, they answered
that she was gone to the westward; but none of them would venture
near; nor did they pay attention to a white handkerchief, which
was held up, and had before been considered a signal of
peace.<br>
<br>
"As the boats proceeded on their search round the island, the
natives followed along the shore, with increasing numbers. One
man, who was rubbed with something blue, and appeared to be a
chief, had a small axe in his hand, which was known, from the red
helve, to have belonged to Mr. Shaw. On reaching the bay in the
north-west side of the island, Mr. Dell remarked that the natives
disappeared, all except about thirty, who were very anxious in
persuading him to land. They brought down women, and made signs
that the boat and people whom he sought were a little way up in
the island. He, however, rowed onward, when the beach was
immediately crowded with people who had been lying in ambush
expecting him to land.<br>
<br>
"After having gone entirely round the island and seen nothing of
the objects of his research, Mr. Dell returned to the first cove,
where a great number of natives armed with bows, arrows, clubs
and lances, were assembled at the outskirt of the wood. By
offering knives and other things, a few were induced to approach
the boat, and the coxswain seized one of them by the hair and
neck, with the intention of his being taken off to the ships to
give an account of the missing boat and people. A shower of
arrows instantly came out of the wood, and a firing was
commenced, which killed one Indian and wounded some others. In
the meantime, the coxswain found it impossible to keep the man,
from his hair and body being greased, and the boat's crew was too
much occupied to assist him.<br>
<br>
"8<i>th July</i>. The two Commanders, having heard the report of
Mr. Dell, proceeded with the ships round the northern reefs and
sandbanks to the bay on the north-west side of Darnley Island,
which was named <span class="u">Treacherous Bay</span>.<br>
<br>
"9<i>th July</i>.&mdash;In the afternoon they anchored, . . . the
extremes of the island bearing E.&frac12;N. to SW. by S., and the
nearest part distant a quarter of a mile. A boat was sent on
shore, and returned at sunset with a few coco-nuts, but without
having seen any of the inhabitants.<br>
<br>
"10<i>th July</i>. An armed party of 44 men landed from the
ships, under the command of Mr. Dell. After hoisting the Union
Jack and <span class="u">taking possession</span> of this and the
neighbouring islands and coast of New Guinea in the name of His
Majesty, they examined the huts, and found the greatcoats of
Captain Hill, Mr. Carter and Mr. Shaw, with several other things
which had belonged to them and to the boat's crew, so that no
doubt was entertained of their having been <span class=
"u">murdered</span>. In the evening, the party arrived from
making the tour of the island, having burnt and destroyed 135
huts, 16 canoes measuring from 50 to 70 feet in length, and
various plantations of sugar-cane. The natives appeared to have
retired to the hills in the centre of the island, as not one of
them could be discovered . . . The plantations of the natives,
which were extensive and numerous in the plains, contained yams,
sweet potatoes, plantains and sugar-canes, included within neat
fences of bamboo, and coco-nut trees were very abundant,
particularly near the habitations.<br>
<br>
"The habitations of the Indians were generally placed at the
heads of the small coves, and formed into villages of ten or
twelve huts each . . . In each of the huts . . . were suspended
two or three human skulls, and several strings of hands, five or
six on a string. These were hung round a wooden image, rudely
carved into the representation of a man or of some bird . . . In
one hut, containing much the greater number of skulls, a kind of
gum was found burning before one of these images . . .<br>
<br>
"The corpse of a man who had been shot we found disposed of in
the following manner. Six stakes were driven into the ground
about three feet from each other and six feet high. A platform of
twigs was worked upon them at the height of about five feet, and
upon this the body was laid, without covering; but the putrid
state of the corpse did not allow of a close inspection.<br>
<br>
"11<i>th July</i>.&mdash;The '<i>Hormuzeer</i>' stood north. In
the afternoon both ships anchored off <span class="u">Stephens'
Island</span>. An armed party was immediately sent ashore to
obtain intelligence, if possible, of the lost whaleboat. The
<span class="u">natives</span> were assembled in hostile array
upon the hills, sounding their conches, but after lancing a few
arrows they fled. Several were wounded by the shots fired in
return, but they succeeded in escaping to a canoe at the back of
the island and getting off, all except one boy, who was taken
unhurt. In the huts which were burnt, several things were found,
and amongst them a sheet of copper which belonged to the
'Chesterfield.'<br>
<br>
"12<i>th July</i>.&mdash;Stephens' Island was traversed all over,
and a spike nail, with the King's broad arrow upon it, was
brought on board. [<i>Note by Flinders</i>: 'It had probably been
obtained from the crews of either the "<i>Providence</i>" or
"<i>Assistant</i>," which had been anchored under Stephens'
Island nine months before.']<br>
<br>
"13<i>th July</i>.&mdash;A boat was sent to <span class=
"u">Campbell's Island</span>, but it did not contain either
plantations, coco-nut trees or fixed habitations . . .<br>
<br>
"In the afternoon, the ships proceeded to the westward, but,
meeting with many reefs, they hauled more to the north, and
discovered <span class="u">Bristow Island</span>, lying close to
the coast of New Guinea. Their attempts to find a passage here
were fruitless, and, after incurring much danger, the
'<i>Chesterfield</i>' getting aground, they returned to their
former anchorage in the evening of<br>
<br>
"21<i>st July</i>.&mdash;The banks, reefs and land seen during
these eight days will be found marked in Plate XIII.<br>
<br>
"Two canoes immediately came off from <span class="u">Stephens'
Island</span>, and one of the natives remained on board the
'<i>Hormuzeer</i>' till 8 o'clock. He seemed to be without fear,
and when inquiry was made after the lost boat and people, he
pointed to a whaleboat and made signs that such a one had been at
Darnley's Island, and that six of the people were killed.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Many presents were made to this
man, and he was clothed and sent ashore in one of the
boats.</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) "Hill and four seamen were murdered by natives.
Shaw and Carter were severely wounded, but with Ascott, the
remaining seaman, they got into the boat, cut the grapnel rope
and escaped. They were without provision or compass, and it being
impossible to reach the ships, which lay 5 leagues to windward,
they bore away to the west, through the strait, in the hope of
reaching Timor. On the tenth day they reached Timor Laut."

<p>N<small>O</small> attempt to estimate the value of the
contribution made by Matthew Flinders to the geography of Torres
Strait and the Cape York Peninsula would be complete without a
relation of the circumstances which led to his visiting that part
of the world and the events which followed, and which put a
tragic end to his career. The story is taken in the main from his
own work on Terra Australis <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and
the atlas issued with it; but there is an immense mass of other
documents, both French and English, to be carefully considered.
Indeed, in a biography brimful of touching human interest the
chief difficulty of a writer is to leave out enough to reduce it
to reasonable proportions. In this difficult matter of
condensation, I gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness to
Professor Scott. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></p>

<blockquote>[2) <i>The Life of Captain Matthew Flinders, R.N.</i>
By Ernest Scott, Professor of History in the University of
Melbourne. Sydney, 1914.]</blockquote>
<p>Flinders was the son of a physician in Donington,
Lincolnshire, where he was born on 16th March, 1774. From his
earliest youth, he developed an invincible inclination towards
maritime pursuits. The patron so necessary in these days was
opportunely found for him in Captain (afterwards Admiral) Sir
Thomas Pasley, through whose influence he entered the Royal Navy
in 1789, and was rated as "Lieutenant's Servant" on the
"<i>Bellerophon</i>" on 31st July, 1790. In 1791, he joined the
"<i>Providence</i>" under Captain William Bligh, on his second
voyage for the transport of the breadfruit tree to the West
Indies. This mission was successfully accomplished, the plants
being delivered at their destination near the end of 1793. By
this time, Britain was at war with France. The only existing
account of the voyage of the "<i>Providence</i>" and her tender,
the "<i>Assistant</i>" is that given by Flinders in the
introductory chapter of his great work.</p>
<p>On his arrival in England, Flinders (then nineteen years of
age), eagerly embraced the opportunity of rejoining the
"<i>Bellerophon</i>" and Admiral Pasley, who had received a good
report on his conduct from Captain Bligh, made him his <i>aide de
camp</i>. In the great battle off Brest, Pasley's active career
was ended by the loss of a leg. Afterwards, although he received
promotion and honours, he was only fit for administrative duties,
and therefore Flinders left the "<i>Bellerophon</i>" after
exactly five days' experience of naval warfare (28th May to 1st
June, 1794).</p>
<p>In 1788, the British colony of <span class="a">New South
Wales</span> was inaugurated by <span class="a">Captain
Phillips</span>, who sailed from England in the "<i>Sirius</i>"
commanded by <span class="a">Captain John Hunter</span> (who
succeeded him in the governorship in 1794). In March, 1794, the
"<i>Reliance</i>" and "<i>Supply</i>" were commissioned to convey
Hunter to Sydney, and Flinders was a midshipman on the
first-named vessel. Sydney was reached on 7th September,
1795.</p>
<p>On the voyage out, a close friendship had sprung up between
Flinders and <span class="a">George Bass</span>, the Surgeon of
the "<i>Reliance</i>" The two friends had no sooner landed than
they concerted measures for the exploration of the coast of New
South Wales. Having secured the best boat available, the "<i>Tom
Thumb</i>," eight feet in length, they, and a boy, visited Botany
Bay and the St. Georges River before the end of 1795. In a second
boat of the same name, they left Sydney on 25th March, 1796, and
explored the coast of the Illawarra district to the south and
Port Hacking to the north, returning to Sydney on 2nd April.</p>
<p>A British protectorate of the Cape of Good Hope had by this
time been proclaimed, and the "Reliance" under Captain
Waterhouse, with the "<i>Supply</i>," under Captain William Kent,
made a voyage to the Cape and brought back cattle to stock the
colony of New South Wales. The ships returned to Sydney on 26th
June and 16th May, 1797, respectively. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> Flinders was one of the officers of the
"<i>Reliance</i>."</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Terra Australis</i>, I, civ.]</blockquote>
<p>While Flinders was either confined to the neighbourhood of
Sydney during the overhaul of the "<i>Reliance</i>" and
"<i>Supply</i>" or engaged in their voyage to the Cape,
<span class="a">Bass</span> started on the memorable voyage which
led to the discovery of <span class="a">Bass Strait</span>. He
set out from Sydney on 3rd December, 1797, in a <span class=
"a">whaleboat</span> with six men. A month later, they found
white men near Wilson's Promontory. These proved to be escaped
convicts, marooned by the treachery of some of their companions,
who made away with the only boat. On 5th January, 1798, Bass
discovered <span class="a">Western Port</span>, only a few miles
short of Port Phillip, and remained there for a fortnight. The
port is now a naval base for the Commonwealth fleet. Bass firmly
(and correctly) believed that he had discovered a strait
separating Tasmania from Australia; but official admission or
recognition of the fact was delayed until the strait had actually
been sailed through.</p>
<p>Flinders had passed as lieutenant while at the Cape in 1797.
On his return to Sydney, it was reported that the "<i>Sydney
Cove</i>" had been wrecked at the Furneaux Islands (north-east of
Tasmania), and the schooner "<i>Francis</i>" and sloop
"<i>Eliza</i>" were dispatched from Sydney for the scene of the
wreck on 1st February, 1798. Governor Hunter permitted Flinders
to embark on the "<i>Francis</i>," "to make such observations
serviceable to geography and navigation as circumstances might
afford." Unfortunately, the "<i>Eliza</i>" got separated from the
"<i>Francis</i>" and was lost with all hands. The
"<i>Francis</i>" returned to Sydney on 9th March. The net
geographical result of the voyage was the addition to the map of
the Kent group of islands, west of Tasmania.</p>
<p>Bass had returned to Sydney from his whaleboat voyage along
600 miles of the coast of New South Wales on 25th February. He
and Flinders were eager to "pursue inquiry to the point of proof
"regarding the separation of Tasmania from New South Wales, and
Flinders desired to circumnavigate Tasmania. Before this object
could be attained, however, Flinders, as an officer of the
"<i>Reliance</i>" had to make a trip (May to July, 1798) to
Norfolk Island. On 7th October, the Governor having put him in
command of the sloop "<i>Norfolk</i>" he sailed with a crew of
eight men, accompanied by Bass. They <span class=
"a">circumnavigated Tasmania</span> and returned to Sydney on
12th January, 1799.</p>
<p>On 8th July, 1799, Flinders sailed for the north in the
"<i>Norfolk</i>." He visited Moreton Bay, where he spent fifteen
days, and Hervey Bay, returning to Sydney on 20th August. He came
to the conclusion that there were no important rivers on this
stretch of the coast, having missed the Hunter, Clarence,
Richmond and Brisbane.</p>
<p>Flinders sailed for England on 3rd March, 1800, in the
"<i>Reliance</i>" under command of Captain Waterhouse, and
arrived at Portsmouth on 26th August. He pressed the Admiralty
for employment in the further exploration and survey of
Australia, and through the influence of <span class="a">Sir
Joseph Banks</span> was given the "<i>Investigator</i>" a sloop
of 334 tons, built as a merchantman and originally known as the
"<i>Xenophon</i>" He was promoted to the rank of commander, and
took possession of his ship on 25th January, 1801. The Admiralty
was most liberal in "finding" the vessel, giving Banks carte
blanche to furnish it according to his own and Flinders' ideas,
and the assistants were well remunerated, according to the value
of money at the time, as witness the sums placed against some of
their names. Evidently, the expedition was a popular one. Under
Flinders, the following were the officers:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left:1.0cm; font-size: 90%;">1st Lieutenant,
Robert Fowler.<br>
2nd Lieutenant, Ward Flinders.<br>
Midshipmen, 6, one of whom was John Franklin.<br>
Botanist, Robert Brown (&pound;420 per annum).<br>
Landscape and Figure Draftsman, William Westall (&pound;315).<br>
Botanical Draftsman, Ferdinand Bauer (&pound;315).<br>
Gardener, Peter Good (&pound;105).<br>
Miner, John Allen (&pound;105).</div>
<div style=
"text-indent:-0.5cm; margin-left:1.5cm; font-size: 90%;">
Astronomer, John Crossley (&pound;420). His health broke down,
and he returned to England from the Cape of Good Hope, when
Matthew Flinders and his brother, Ward, took over his
duties.</div>
<p>The East India Company donated &pound;600 for table-money for
the officers and staff.</p>
<p>Britain was at war with France at this time, but in view of
the purely scientific aims of the expedition Flinders was
provided with a passport signed by the French Minister of Marine
on behalf of the First Consul.</p>
<p>With this improvement in his position and prospects, Flinders
<span class="a">married</span>, on 17th April, 1801, Miss Ann
Chappell, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> whom he proposed to
take with him, in spite of a regulation to the contrary. The
regulation had, indeed, been frequently disregarded, but
unfortunately for Flinders recent instances of flagrant abuses on
the part of highly placed officers had just then forced the
Admiralty to insist on implicit obedience. Even Sir Joseph Banks
looked coldly upon what seemed like an attempt to smuggle a wife
on board. In the end, Flinders had to yield and leave his bride
behind. The separation was destined to last more than nine years,
and the married lovers had less than four years of life
together.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Scott, <i>Life of Flinders</i>, p.
164.]</blockquote>
<p>Flinders sailed from Spithead on 18th July, 1801, and it is
recorded that he raised discipline, sanitation and food supply to
a pitch never before attained, even improving on the methods of
Cook. The Australian coast, near <span class="a">Cape
Leeuwin</span>, was sighted on 6th December, 1801.</p>
<p>From the Leeuwin to Fowler's Bay, the coast was already
known.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"In 1791, Captain <span class=
"u">George Vancouver</span>, in the '<i>Cape Chatham</i>' sailed
along it from Cape Leeuwin to King Georges Sound, which he
discovered and named . . . In 1792, <span class="u">Bruny
D'Entrecasteaux</span>, with the French ships '<i>Recherche</i>'
and '<i>Esperance</i>,' searching for tidings of the lost
'Lap&eacute;rouse' followed the line of the shore more closely
than Vancouver had done, and penetrated much further eastward, to
131&deg; 38&frac12;', east of the present border-line of Western
and South Australia. These navigators, with the Dutchman
<span class="u">Pieter Nuyts</span>, in the early part of the
seventeenth century, and the Frenchman <span class="u">St.
Alouara</span>, who anchored near the <i>Leeuwin</i> in 1792,
were the only Europeans known to have been upon any part of these
southern coasts before the advent of Flinders; and the extent of
the voyage of Nuyts is by no means clear." <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) Scott, Life of Flinders, p. 206.]</blockquote>
<p>Fowler's Bay was named and surveyed by Flinders, who now
commenced to devote careful study to this part of the coast,
seeing that it was new to geography. As an evidence of the
minuteness of the survey, Scott compares the 240 names bestowed
by Flinders on the South Australian and Tasmanian coasts with the
103 noted by Cook along the whole of the eastern coast of
Australia.</p>
<p>Cape Catastrophe was rounded on 20th February, 1802, and the
northward trend of the land east of the Cape revived for a time
the old idea of the connection of the Bight with the Gulf of
Carpentaria. The ominous name of the cape was conferred because
on the 21st a boat, with the master of the "<i>Investigator,</i>"
John Thistle, a midshipman and six sailors, was upset while
returning from the shore to the ship, and the whole party was
lost.</p>
<p>Spencer's Gulf was explored and charted between 6th and 20th
March, 1802, and Kangaroo Island was also discovered. St.
Vincent's Gulf was entered on 27th March, and the survey was
finished on 1st April. Forty years later, the foundations of the
city of <span class="a">Adelaide</span> were laid at the foot of
the Mount Lofty Range, on country which Flinders had described as
"well clothed with forest timber" and "having a fertile
appearance."</p>
<p>Kangaroo Island was left behind on 6th April. About half a
degree to the east, on the 8th, Flinders met <span class=
"a">Baudin</span>, in the "<i>G&eacute;ographe</i>" in Encounter
Bay. It appeared that the "<i>G&eacute;ographe</i>" had sailed
through <span class="a">Bass Strait</span> and had been between
Wilson's Promontory and Cape Otway from the 28th to the 31st of
March, thus narrowly missing the discovery of Port Phillip.</p>
<p>Captain Nicolas Baudin, on the "<i>G&eacute;ographe</i>" left
Havre on 19th October, 1800, accompanied by Captain Hamelin, in
the "<i>Naturaliste</i>" on a geographical and scientific
expedition, and had passports not only from the Government of the
First Consul of France but also from the British Government,
although the two countries were at war. Early in the voyage,
scurvy made dreadful havoc in both ships. The expedition reached
(<i>via</i> Timor), in January, 1802, the southern shores of
Tasmania, in which island there was then no European settlement,
and sojourned there till March. On 7th-8th March, the vessels
were separated by a storm near the east end of Bass Strait. The
"<i>Naturaliste</i> "spent some time in Western Port, which had
already been discovered by Bass. Finally, Captain Hamelin took
her to Sydney, with the object of soliciting aid from the
Colonial Governor. In the meantime, Baudin had taken the
"<i>G&eacute;ographe</i>" westward through Bass Strait, and he
was fortunate enough to meet the "<i>Investigator</i>" in
Encounter Bay. Flinders advised and invited him to make for
Sydney to refit and victual his ship. Baudin went on to King
Island, where he turned back, and arrived at Sydney on 20th June,
1802.</p>
<p>Baudin had explored the coast from Cape Banks to Encounter
Bay. From Cape Banks to Port Phillip, the discoverer was Captain
Grant, of the "<i>Lady Nelson</i>" who sailed from the Cape of
Good Hope eastward through Bass Strait (3rd-16th December,
1800).</p>
<p>From Cape Otway, Flinders went to King Island, the southern
part of which had been discovered in 1799 by Captain John Reid, a
sealer, and the northern part by Captain John Black, of the
"<i>Harbinger</i>" Leaving King Island on 24th January, 1802,
Flinders sighted Grant's Cape Schanck on the 26th. Thence,
bearing west, to trace the land at the head of the Great Bight,
he entered <span class="a">Port Phillip</span>, which at first he
took for Bass' Western Port. It did not take him long to satisfy
himself that this was a mistake, and his natural conclusion was
that in Port Phillip he had himself discovered a bay of no less
importance than Western Port; but the discovery of Port Phillip
had been anticipated by Lieutenant John Murray, who succeeded
Captain Grant in the command of the "<i>Lady Nelson</i>" Flinders
surveyed the bay, and ascended Arthur Seat, where he found
himself with Port Phillip on the west and Western Port on the
east.</p>
<p>On 9th May, 1802, Flinders entered Port Jackson, with
something to be proud&mdash;of a clean bill of health&mdash;and
reported himself to Governor King. In the harbour lay the
"<i>Naturaliste</i>" (which had arrived on 24th April), and
Flinders was able to inform Hamelin that his lost consort would
make for Sydney also. As a matter of fact, Baudin brought the
"<i>G&eacute;ographe</i>" into the port on 20th June, with every
man on board sick.</p>
<p>The signing of a treaty of peace (which, unfortunately, proved
very temporary) between Britain and France had become known in
Sydney a few days before the arrival of the
"<i>G&eacute;ographe</i>." There was, therefore, nothing to
prevent the utmost kindness being extended to the distressed
explorer; but it is pleasing to relate that, even while a state
of war was supposed to prevail, the "<i>Naturaliste</i>" had been
equally well treated.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> "<i>Investigator</i>" having been repaired
and refitted in Sydney Harbour and a new master (John Aken)
having been appointed, it was decided, on consultation with
Governor King, that she should proceed to explore <span class=
"a">Torres Strait</span> and the eastern side of the <span class=
"a">Gulf of Carpentaria</span>, accompanied by the "<i>Lady
Nelson</i>" (Captain Murray).</p>
<p>Flinders accordingly left Sydney on list July, 1802, with the
"<i>Investigator</i>" and "<i>Lady Nelson</i>." The
latter&mdash;a 60-ton brig&mdash; proved herself from the first
to be an unsuitable ship, and merely a drag on the larger vessel,
and was sent back on 18th October. In following the coast to the
north, Flinders named (7th August) <span class="a">Port
Curtis</span>, now the port of <span class="a">Gladstone</span>,
and (28th September) the <span class="a">Percy Islands</span>.
(<span class="a">Admiralty Chart</span>, No. 2759A.) On 20th
October, he got outside of the Barrier Reef (18&deg; 45' S.;
148&deg; 10' E.) by the passage which now bears his own name.
Nine days later, he came inside of the reef by a passage in
9&deg; 50' S. and 144&deg; 45' E., between Portlock and Boot
Reefs, which he identified as the one used by Captain Edwards of
the "<i>Pandora</i>" in 1791, and therefore named <span class=
"a">Pandora Entrance</span>. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>) The same
night (29<i>th October</i>, 1802), he was at anchor north of the
largest of the <span class="a">Murray Islands</span>. He remarks,
<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> "I did not forget that the
inhabitants of these islands had made an attack on the
'<i>Providence</i>' and 'Assistant,' <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> nor that Mr. Bampton had some people cut
off at Darnley Island in 1793 (pp. xxxiv-xxxix). The marines were
therefore kept under arms . . . Bows and arrows were contained in
all the canoes, but no intimation of hostility was manifested by
the Indians." He bartered iron articles, including hatchets, for
plantains, bows and arrows, etc., with forty or fifty
islanders.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Now on Admiralty charts as "Pandora Passage." Not
to be confounded with the "Pandora Entrance" in Admiralty Chart,
No. 2759A, in 11&deg; 25' S. and 144&deg; E., where the
"<i>Pandora</i>" was wrecked.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) <i>Terra Australis</i>. Introduction, p.
xxiv.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[3) This attack was at Darnley Island, 30 miles
north-west of Murray Island. The expression "these islands"
evidently referred to the group. Flinders was the first to visit
the Murray Islands (29th October, 1802), although they were seen
and named by Edwards in August, 1791, a few days before the
"<i>Pandora</i> "was wrecked.]</blockquote>
<p>From Murray Island, Flinders picked his way cautiously among
the reefs and low islets southward and westward towards Cape
York. Late in the afternoon of 30th October, he anchored at the
south end of the reef surrounding what he called <span class=
"a">Halfway Island</span>. This island is described as being
barely a mile in circumference, only a few feet above the reach
of spring tides, and covered with casuarina and other trees.
Indications of the recent presence of "Indians" were
observed.</p>
<p>On 31<i>st October</i>, good progress was maintained to the
southwest. At noon, the position was 10&deg; 26" 45" S. and
142&deg; 39&frac12;' E., and from this position high land was
seen bearing SSE. and at an estimated distance of 10 or 12
miles&mdash;almost certainly the <span class="a">Mount Adolphus
Islands</span>, the larger of which rises to 548 feet. By 2 p.m.,
the ship passed on the north side of <span class="a">Double
Island</span> and the course was altered to SW. by S., in which
direction lay some rocky islets. These, however, when reached,
afforded no shelter, and the ship wore round to the west until an
anchorage was found on the north side of <span class=
"a">Wednesday Island</span> (10&deg; 30' S.; 142&deg; 18&frac12;'
E.), which had been named by Bligh.</p>
<p>On 1<i>st November</i>, the weather was too rough for landing
or sailing. Some fires were seen on <span class="a">Hammond
Island</span>, but Wednesday Island showed no sign of habitation
except for gigantic ant-hills which were at first taken for huts.
On the following morning (2nd November), the course was shaped
westward and west-southwestward, with Wednesday and Hammond
Islands to the south and the <span class="a">North-west
Reef</span> on the north. This passage is now officially known as
<span class="a">Prince of Wales Channel</span>. (In modern charts
the passage between Wednesday and Horn Islands, named
<span class="a">Flinders Passage</span>, is that used by Flinders
in his later voyage [1803] in the "<i>Cumberland</i>.")</p>
<p><span class="a">Hammond Island</span> was so named by Captain
Edwards on his voyage in the boat of the wrecked
"<i>Pandora</i>."</p>
<p>South-west of Hammond Island, Flinders distinguished another,
which he named <span class="a">Good Island</span>, after the
gardener of the expedition, and the anchor was dropped near its
west end in the afternoon. Flinders landed with the botanists and
took bearings, and remarked that "the stone is granite . . . and
. . . porphyry, and in one place I found streaks of verdegrease,
as if the cliffs above had contained copper ore." This is the
earliest recorded indication of "<span class="a">mineral
wealth</span>" in Queensland territory. The adjacent Hammond
Island, nearly a century later, was found to contain auriferous
quartz associated with copper pyrites, and there can be no doubt
that Flinders' observation on Good Island was correct and his
deduction justifiable.</p>
<p>From Good Island, <span class="a">Booby Island</span> was
visible, and the "<i>Investigator</i>" was therefore in the open
sea west of Torres Strait.</p>
<p>The voyage was resumed on 3<i>rd November</i>, with the
immediate object of "getting in with the mainland south of the
Prince of Wales Island." The course taken was mainly to the
south-west between the <span class="a">Larpent</span> and
<span class="a">Gerard Banks</span>, and must have been a very
hazardous one, from the shallow soundings shown on modern charts.
Once clear of the shoals, the vessel's head was turned to the
south, and at noon she was west of the <span class="a">Wallis
Islands</span> and between the <span class="a">Red</span> and
<span class="a">Wallis Banks</span>. Flinders wrote: <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> "Between Cape Cornwall [southern point of
Prince of Wales Island] and the low mainland . . . is the opening
called in the old Dutch chart <span class="a">Speult's
River</span>, but which Captain Cook, who sailed through it,
named Endeavour Strait."</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Terra Australis</i>, II, p. 122.]</blockquote>
<p>Some of the charts prior to Tasman's conveyed the idea that
the Van Speult Revier was identical with the passage afterwards
named Endeavour Strait, but Carstenszoon's diary (13th May, 1623)
clearly points out that it was the (or a) mouth of a fresh-water
river draining the land, and as such it was identified by
Asschens in the "<i>Buijs</i>" in 1756.</p>
<p>After clearing the <span class="a">Wallis Islands</span>,
further progress to the south was barred by the <span class=
"">Inskip Banks</span>, and the "<i>Investigator</i>" was forced
to the west until the mainland was lost sight of. It was late in
the day when the southerly course could be resumed, and at dusk
the anchor was dropped in 11&deg; 5' S. and 141&deg; 51' E.</p>
<p>From early morning till 3 p.m. next day (4<i>th November</i>),
the wind was unfavourable for an approach to the land, and the
ship still headed to the south, the midday latitude being 11&deg;
24&frac12;' S. and longitude 141&deg; 46&frac12;' E.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>) A change
of wind at 3 p.m. enabled the course to be laid ESE.: the
low-lying mainland soon afterwards came into view, and the anchor
was dropped near the shore.</p>
<p>On 5<i>th November</i>, the ship had gone but a little way
south when the wind failed. At this point, <span class=
"a">natives</span> could be seen grouped around a fire.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"At 11, the sea breeze came in from W.
by N., with dark, cloudy weather, and we steered forward, passing
a <span class="u">small opening</span> at one o'clock [where the
'<i>Duyfken's</i>' men landed in 1606, one of them being killed
by the natives; where Carstenszoon landed in 1623 from the
'<i>Pera</i>' naming the inlet the <span class="u">Carpentaria
Revier</span>; the mouth of what is now known as the <span class=
"u">Skardon River</span>, the name having been given by Jardine
in 1865 to what may possibly have been one of its
heads.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]. "This opening was 4
or 5 miles south of where the natives had been seen." A much
<span class="u">larger opening</span> came in sight at 2, into
which I hoped to get the ship; but the water was so shallow at 5
or 6 miles off that we were obliged to tack, and after making a
second ineffectual attempt it became dark, and we anchored in 6
fathoms, fine dark mud, the centre of the opening bearing S.
37&deg; E., 3 leagues.<br>
<br>
"The coast was low, as before, but the trees upon it were taller.
The largest opening [<span class="u">Port
Musgrave</span>.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] is about
two miles wide, leading in SE., but turning afterwards more east
and apparently contracting its width [the mouth of the
<span class="u">Dalhunty River</span>, <i>de facto</i>, of modern
maps, where it enters the Port Musgrave
estuary.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]. Near the
south-west point of the entrance [<span class="u">Cullen Point.
R.L.J</span>.], which projects a little from the general line of
the shore, was a clump of trees higher than usual, presenting the
first mark I had yet found for bearings. The latitude of this
opening is 11&deg; 55', and agrees nearly with that of the
<span class="u">Batavia River</span> in the old Dutch chart in
the old Dutch chart [<i>i.e</i>. in Thevenot's
chart.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]; but the shoal which
runs 6 miles out seemed to render it inaccessible to a ship."
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> [What is now known as the
<span class="u">Batavia River</span> falls into the south-western
corner of the Port Musgrave Estuary. Tasman anchored in 1644 off
the mouth of Port Musgrave, and named it <span class="u">Staaten
Revier</span>, which is curious, as there was already a Staten
Revier on the map, more than 5 degrees further
south.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Terra Australis</i>, II, p. 125.]</blockquote>
<p>In the morning of 6<i>th November</i>, adverse weather
conditions and the fear of the north-west monsoons forbade any
further investigation of this important opening, at the mouth of
which (on Cullen Point) now stands the headquarters and village
of the <span class="a">Mapoon Aboriginal Mission</span>. The
"<i>Investigator</i>" therefore coasted to SSW., and anchored at
sunset, about 12&deg; 12' S.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"7<i>th November</i>. At daylight
<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> we again steered southward, but
in two hours the wind died off and an anchor was dropped in 9
fathoms. There was a <span class="u">small opening</span> at
E&deg; (sic) 5' S., about 3 miles; and the botanical gentlemen
being desirous of seeing the productions of this part of the
country, the whale-boat was lowered down and we went to explore
the inlet . . . We had a good deal of difficulty to get in on
account of the shoals, the channel among them being narrow and
winding and not more than 9 to 12 feet deep. On the north side
was a party of <span class="u">natives</span>, and Bongaree went
on shore to them, naked and unarmed; but, although provided with
spears, they retreated from him and all our endeavours to bring
about an interview were unsuccessful. It was not safe for the
gentlemen to botanise in presence of these suspicious people, and
therefore we rowed a mile higher up, to a green-looking point on
the same side and landed about noon. The depth thus far was 2
fathoms, and I could see 2&frac12; miles further up the inlet to
the ESE., where it turned more southward round a wooded point,
and, from the strength of the tide, probably extended some miles
into the country.</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[2) <i>Ibid</i>., II, p. 126.]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote class="inline">"While the botanists were making their
examination and I walked along the shore to shoot some birds,
several voices were heard in the wood, as of people advancing
towards us . . . We rowed back to the first place, where the
country was open, and the gentlemen botanised, whilst sentinels
kept watch on the sandy hillocks . . .<br>
<br>
"Before quitting the shore, a hatchet was made fast to the branch
of a tree and set up conspicuously near the water side. We had
scarcely shoved off, when the party of Indians, sixteen in
number, made their appearance and called to us; but when the
boat's head was turned towards them they ran away. On the south
side of the entrance were four other natives, who also ran at our
approach. We therefore set up another hatchet for them, and
returned back to the ship.<br>
<br>
"These people were all naked; and in colour, as in everything
else, seemed to have a perfect resemblance to the inhabitants of
the east and south coasts of Terra Australis. In Torres Strait,
bows and arrows are the offensive weapons; but here we saw spears
only. Each man had several in his hand, and something which was
supposed to be a throwing stick.<br>
<br>
"This small opening appears to be the <span class="u">Coen
River</span> of the Dutch chart. Its latitude is 12&deg; 13' S .
. . "</blockquote>
<p>Tasman was the first to chart this inlet (1644), and he named
it <span class="a">Prince Revier</span>. Flinders' suggested
identification of it was a most unfortunate one, and was destined
to give rise to much confusion in later years. He could not
possibly have made the mistake had he been in possession of the
diary of Carstenszoon's voyage in the "<i>Pera</i>" which
distinctly places his <span class="a">Coen Inlet</span>, where he
landed on 8th May, 1623, and kidnapped a native, in 13&deg; 7'
S., <i>i.e.</i>, midway between the mouth of the Archer River and
Pera Head, the southern horn of Albatross Bay. The fact is,
Flinders had to rely on second-hand and generalised charts, such
as Thevenot's, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> of which he gives
a copy as an inset in his Chart Sheet 2, in the atlas issued with
<i>Terra Australis</i>. When, in the process of land exploration,
it became necessary to give names to rivers which rose in the
ranges near the east coast of the Peninsula, but obviously flowed
towards the Gulf, the natural tendency was to connect the new
rivers with the few inlets, or reviers, which appeared on the map
of the Gulf coast. Thus, when, in 1876, a goldfield was
discovered in 13&deg; 55' S. and 143&deg; 13' E., on a river
which flowed to the northwest, the discoverers believed
themselves to be near the head of the Dutch Coen River, whose
position was very erroneously laid down on the map, on the
authority of Flinders, in 12&deg; 13' S. It would be impossible
now to alter the name of the <span class="a">Coen
Goldfield</span>, which has been sanctioned by half a century of
usage, but the Department of Lands has begun to call the
"<span class="a">Coen River</span>" of the goldfield the
<span class="a">South Coen</span>, in order to minimise the
confusion.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Melchisadech Thevenot. <i>Divers Voyages
Curieux</i>. Fol. Paris, 1663-72. The source of Thevenot's
information is left to conjecture. His chart summarises Tasman's
discoveries, but as it agrees neither with the version of
Tasman's chart published by Swart, nor with that published by
Heeres, it was probably taken from some contemporary chart to
which neither Swart nor Heeres had access.]</blockquote>
<p>About 1881, the inlet named by Tasman the <span class=
"a">Prince Revier</span>, and erroneously identified by Flinders
as Carstenszoon's <span class="a">Coen Revier</span>, was renamed
the <span class="a">Pennefather River</span>. As the change took
place during the administration of the Hon. John Douglas, who
used, as Government Resident at Thursday Island, to patrol the
pearl fisheries of the Gulf, it was probably made because he had
realised the impossibility of the inlet being the real Coen,
while at the same time he may have been unaware that it had
already been named the Prince by Tasman.</p>
<p>When Flinders and "the botanical gentlemen" finally rowed out
of the supposed Coen River (to which we may henceforth refer as
the <span class="a">Pennefather</span>) and rejoined the ship, at
3 p.m., he resumed his narrative:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"We then steered south-westward along
the shore, and soon after sunset anchored in 10 fathoms nearly
four miles from the land, which . . . was still low and woody and
fronted with a sandy beach." According to the chart, the
anchorage was in 12&deg; 23 'S.<br>
<br>
"8<i>th November</i>, 1802. Early in the morning we steered along
the coast, with good soundings, between 10 and 9 fathoms, muddy
bottom. <span class="u">a sandy point</span>, with two hillocks
on it, . . . was passed at 10 o'clock; and, seeing a large bight
[<span class="u">Albatross Bay</span>.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>] round it, we tacked to work up . . . This
point is one of the very few remarkable projections to be found
on this low coast, but it is not noticed in the Dutch chart. [It
is, however (unknown to Flinders), very clearly referred to in
Carstenszoon's diary of the voyage of the '<i>Pera</i>' on 12th
May, 1623.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] There is little
doubt, however, that it was seen in 1606, in the yacht
'<i>Duyfken</i>' the first vessel which discovered any part of
Carpentaria; and, that the remembrance may not be lost, I gave
the name of the vessel to the point. Our observations placed the
south extreme of <span class="u">Duyfken Point</span> in 12&deg;
35' S. and 141&deg; 42" E. [It had already been named
<span class="u">Asschens Hoek</span> by Asschens, Skipper of the
'<i>Buijs</i>' who passed it on 26th April,
1756.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]<br>
<br>
"On the sea breeze setting in at 2 o'clock, we steered into the
bight until past 5, when, having no more water than 2&frac12;
fathoms, we tacked and stretched out. The bight extends 11 or 12
miles back from the line of the coast, and there are <span class=
"u">three small openings</span> in it; but the shore being so low
and in many places overrun with mangroves, these openings are
probably no more than drains out of salt swamps or lagoons. The
bearings when we tacked in 2&frac12; fathoms
were:&mdash;</blockquote>
<div style="font-size:90%; margin-left:0.5cm;">"[1] Duyfken
Point, south extreme, distant 6 or 7 miles, N. 63&deg; W.<br>
"[2] A small opening behind it, distant 5 or 6 miles, N. 23&deg;
W.<br>
"[3] A second opening, distant 4 miles, N. 64&deg; E.<br>
"[4] A third, distant 3 miles, S. 78&deg; E.]</div>
<p>These bearings, taken from the shoals off Urquhart Point, very
accurately locate:&mdash;</p>
<p>[2] <span class="a">Pine or Nomenade Creek</span>, referred to
in Tasman's chart as a wooded inlet ("<span class="a">Revier mit

<p>[3] <span class="a">Myall Creek</span>, now known as the
<span class="a">Mission River</span>.</p>
<p>[4] The <span class="a">Embley River</span>, which is
navigable for boats for a good many miles, and on which the
<span class="a">Weipa Mission Station</span> now stands.</p>
<p>Having "reached out of the bight" at 8 p.m., a southward
course was kept till 10.30, when the anchor was dropped,
approximately in 12&deg; 45' S. lat.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Next morning" (9<i>th November</i>),
says Flinders, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> "I set the west
extreme of Duyfken Point at N. 9&deg; E. and the furthest land in
the opposite direction at S. 9&deg; E. [<span class=
"u">See</span> <a href="#map-d">MAP D.</a>] This land forms the
south side of the large bight, and besides projecting beyond the
coast-line and being a little higher than usual, is remarkable
for having some reddish cliffs in it and deep water near the
shore. It is not noticed in the Dutch chart [referring to
Thevenot's chart.&mdash;R. L. J.], but I called it <span class=
"u">Pera Head</span>, to preserve the name of the second vessel
which, in 1623, sailed along this coast."</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Terra Australis</i>, II, p. 129.]</blockquote>
<p>Modern maps give the name <span class="u">Pera Head</span> to
the northmost point of this blunt promontory, while its southern
portion, where the "reddish cliffs" are marked on Flinders'
chart, is distinguished as <span class="a">False Pera
Head</span>; on the other hand, Flinders, in his chart, applies
the name of False Pera Head to a blunt projection about 14 miles
south of Pera Head proper. It is to be noted that Flinders'
<span class="a">False Pera Head</span> is in 13&deg; 8' S.,
practically where Gonzal, in the "<i>Rijder</i>" had placed
<span class="a">Rijder's Hoek</span> in 1756.</p>
<p>It is fortunate that Flinders did not add a third name to the
two which had already been given to the "bight" so carefully
charted by him. <span class="a">Tasman</span> had named it
<span class="a">Vliege Baij</span> in 1644, and as such it was
recognised by <span class="a">Asschens</span>, in the
"<i>Buijs</i>" on 26th April, 1756. On 31st May, 1756,
<span class="a">Gonzal</span>, in the "<i>Rijder</i>" had named
it <span class="a">Mossel Baaij</span>. Tasman's name of Vliege
Bay has undoubtedly the right of priority, but usage has
irrevocably fixed the name of <span class="a">Albatross
Bay</span>, bestowed upon it about 1881, after the small
government steamer used for patrol purposes during the residency
of the Hon. John Douglas.</p>
<p>The narrative of Flinders is resumed, after his sailing out of
Albatross Bay on 9th November, 1802:&mdash;</p>

passed at a distance of one mile and a half at noon, with 9
fathoms water; and the most projecting part of the cliff found to
be in 12&deg; 58&frac12;' S. and 141&deg; 40' E. The sea breeze
had then set in, and we steered southward till past 10 o'clock,
when a decrease in the soundings to 3 fathoms obliged us to tack
at a league from the land; and the wind being at south-west, we
worked along the shore till 10 in the evening, and then anchored
in 6 fathoms, oozy bottom. At daylight (10<i>th November</i>),
the land was seen to be 5 miles distant, equally low and sandy as
before; and a <span class="u">small opening</span> in it, perhaps
not accessible to boats, bore S. 79&deg; E. [mouth of
<span class="u">Archer River</span>.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]."</blockquote>
<p>Between Pera Head and the anchorage of 9th November, Flinders
had unwittingly passed the inlet in 13&deg; 7' S. where
Carstenszoon landed on 8th May, 1623, and which he named the
<span class="a">Coen Revier</span>. The unfortunate
misidentification of this inlet with the "Coen River" of the
goldfield has already been alluded to. Carstenszoon's latitude
(13&deg; 7' S.) places it north of the blunt projection which
Gonzal named <span class="a">Rijder's Hoek</span> on 13th June,
1756, and which Flinders saw obviously from a distance and named
<span class="a">False Pera Head</span> (not what is called False
Pera Head on modern charts). In Chapters LXXXV and LXXXIX it is
shown that Carstenszoon's Coen Revier is the creek located by the
missionaries about 13&deg; 4' S.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"On getting under way again [10<i>th
November</i>]" continues Flinders, "we closed in with the shore
and steered along it at the distance of 2 or 3 miles, in
soundings from 3 to 7 fathoms, until noon. Our latitude was then
13&deg; 42' 35", long. 141&deg; 32', being nearly the position of
<span class="u">Cape Keerweer</span>, at which the yacht
'<i>Duyfken</i>' gave up her examination. I could see nothing
like a cape here; but the southern extreme of the land, seen from
the masthead, projects a little, and from respect to antiquity
the Dutch name is there preserved [<i>i.e.</i>, at 13&deg; 57'
S.&mdash;R. L. J.]. At 4, we passed the southern extremity of
<span class="u">Cape Keerweer</span>, round which the coast falls
back somewhat; the water then became more shallow and did not
admit of [the coast] being safely approached nearer than 4 miles.
An opening is laid down here in the Dutch chart, called
<span class="u">Vereenichde River</span>, which certainly has no
existence. [Evidently referring to Thevenot's map, which puts the
Vereenichde River in 14 and makes no mention of Cape Keerweer.
Flinders does not deny the existence of the river, but merely
states that it is not in the position assigned to it by the Dutch
chart.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] All this afternoon
the sea breeze was fresh and favourable, and by 8 o'clock, when
we anchored in 5 fathoms [This would be about opposite the mouth
of Jardine's Hersey Creek.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>],
the distance run from noon exceeded 40 miles. A fire was seen on
the land about 4 miles off, and some smokes had been passed in
the day; so that the country should seem to be at least as well
peopled in this part of Carpentaria as further northward. The
coast was, if possible, still lower than before; not a single
hill had yet been seen; and the tops of the trees in the highest
land had scarcely exceeded the height of the ship's
masthead."</blockquote>
<p>In coasting from the mouth of the <span class="a">Archer
River</span> southward to <span class="a">Cape Keerweer</span>,
Flinders failed to observe two inlets noted on Tasman's chart, in
13&deg; 27-30' and 13&deg; 42' S. The former was erroneously
identified by Tasman with Carstenszoon's <span class=
"a">Coen</span> and the latter was named by him <span class=
"a">Visscher's Revier.</span> It would not surprise me if both
inlets should turn out to be mouths of the Archer River. It
<i>would</i> be surprising if a river of such importance as the
Archer were almost the only one on the western coast of
Carpentaria to have a single mouth. In fact, the Dugally River,
located on a missionary sketch-map in 13&deg; 33&frac12;' S., is
obviously a mouth of the Archer, and probably the same is true of
Visscher's Revier.</p>
<p>Continuing his account of the voyage. Flinders writes (II, p.
130):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"11<i>th November</i>, 1802.&mdash;The
land wind came from NNE., and our course was pursued along the
shore at the usual distance. At 8 o'clock, the depth decreased to
2&frac12; fathoms and obliged us to steer off, though 5 miles
from the land; and when fair soundings were obtained, the tops of
the trees only were visible from the deck. [<span class=
"u">See</span> <a href="#map-f">MAP F.</a>] At noon we had closed
in again, the shore being distant 5 or 6 miles and the depth 6
fathoms, on a gravelly bottom. Our latitude was 14&deg; 51' 5",
long. 141&deg; 33'; the extremes seen from the deck bore N.
29&deg; to S. 26&deg; E., and a smoke was seen arising at S.
28&deg; E. The sea breeze came in from the south-westward, but
the trending of the coast being nearly SSE., we lay along it
until past 4 o'clock and then tacked off, in 3 fathoms . . . At 8
in the evening, the breeze died away, and a stream anchor was
dropped in 5 fathoms, mud and shells, 5 or 6 miles off the shore,
where the latitude, from an observation of the moon, was 15&deg;
5' S.<br>
<br>
"12<i>th November</i>, 1802.&mdash;At sunrise next morning, the
ship was steering southward, with a land wind at east; and at 7
o'clock we passed an <span class="u">opening</span> near which
several <span class="u">natives</span> were collected. The
entrance seemed to be a full mile in width, but a spit from the
south side runs so far across that there is probably no access to
it unless for rowing boats. Its latitude is 15&deg; 12' S.,
corresponding with a bight in the Dutch chart to the south of the
second waterplaets. [This, beyond question, was the <span class=
"u">Vereenichde Revier</span>, afterwards named by <span class=
"u">Leichhardt</span> the <span class="u">Mitchell River.
R.L.J.</span>] . . . Our course southward was continued at 2 or 3
miles from the shore . . . The latitude at noon was 15&deg; 25'
20", and long. 141&deg; 32'. At 1 o'clock, we steered SSW., with
the whaleboat ahead . . . until 7 in the evening, when the stream
anchor was dropped about 4 miles from the shore. [<span class=
"u">See</span> <a href="#map-h">MAP H.</a>]<br>
<br>
"13<i>th November</i>, 1802.&mdash;We were again under way very
soon after 5 o'clock, and at 6, being then 4 miles from the land
and steering SSW., a <span class="u">lagoon</span> was seen from
the masthead over the front beach. It has doubtless some
connection with the sea, either by a constant or a temporary
opening, but none such could be perceived. The latitude, 15&deg;
53', corresponds with that of <span class="u">Nassau
Revier</span> in the old chart; and from the examples already
seen of the Dutch rivers here it seems probable that this lagoon
was meant. [Subsequent cartographers have accepted Flinders'
suggestion, which was, however, altogether a mistaken one.
<span class="u">Carstenszoon</span> gave the name of <span class=
"u">Nassau Revier</span> to an inlet in 16&deg; 10' S., where
modern Lands Department charting places the mouth of an unnamed
creek, near the head of which were <span class="u">Leichhardt's
camps</span> of 2nd and 3rd July, 1845. Thevenot's chart (perhaps
reduced and generalised from Tasman's) places the Nassau about
16.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]<br>
<br>
"A few miles further south, the shoal water obliged me to run
westward out of sight of land from the deck. [Thus Flinders
missed the 'Tidal Arm' of <span class="u">Leichhardt's 'Rocky
Creek'</span>, which had already been named the <span class=
"u">Revier Pera</span> by <span class=
"u">Tasman</span>.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] At noon,
when the latitude was 16&deg; 24' 29" and longitude 141&deg;
14&frac12;, trees were visible from the deck at N. 70&deg; E.,
and from thence to S. 50&deg; E., the nearest part, whence a
smoke arose, being distant 7 or 8 miles, and the depth of water 4
fathoms. The slight projection here is probably one of those
marked in the old chart on each side of <span class="u">Staten
River</span>; but where the river can be found I know
not."</blockquote>
<p>This "nearest part" of the land, "whence a smoke arose," is
identifiable, with the aid of Flinders' chart, about 16&deg; 25',
where, as a matter of fact, one of the mouths of a large river is
placed by modern Lands Department maps. Flinders' identification
of it, however, with the <span class="a">Staten Revier</span> of
the "<i>Pera's</i>" voyage is a very unhappy one, the latter
(which was the "furthest south" of the "<i>Pera</i>" and
"<i>Aernem</i>") being, in all probability, <span class=
"a">Accident Inlet</span>, one of the mouths of the <span class=
"a">Gilbert River</span>, in latitude 17&deg; 13' S. To do
Flinders justice, the identification of an inlet which he did not
even see was suggested by him in the most tentative way; but it
was accepted by Stokes (1841), Leichhardt (1845) and Jardine
(1864), and the river has become for all time the <span class=
"a">Staaten River</span>, <i>de facto</i>, though not <i>de
jure</i>. It is noteworthy that Flinders, although his diary
carefully gives the latitudes and his conjectures as to the
identification of his inlets with "the Dutch chart" (Thevenot's),
his own chart, "North Coast, Sheet 2," names no rivers or inlets
south of Cape Keerweer. The inference is that although he
indulged in conjectures his intention was to be careful not to
commit himself.</p>
<p>Flinders continues his narrative of 13<i>th
November</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The nearest approach made to the land
in the afternoon was 5 or 6 miles, with 3 fathoms water. At dusk
we anchored in 6 fathoms, mud, at 6 or 7 miles from the shore.
[Flinders' chart gives the latitude of this anchorage as 16&deg;
41' S., <i>i.e.</i>, just outside of the '<i>Pera's</i>'
anchorage of 26th April, 1623.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]"</blockquote>
<p>The voyage was resumed at daylight on 14<i>th
November</i>.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"We steered," says Flinders, "a course
nearly due south, which, as the coast then trended southward,
brought us in with it. At noon, the latitude was 17&deg; 3' 15",
longitude 141&deg; 0': a <span class="u">projecting part</span>
bore N. 59&deg; E., 3 or 4 miles. [<span class="u">See</span>
<a href="#map-m">MAP M.</a>]. . .There appeared to be a
<span class="u">small opening</span> on the south side of this
little projection, which corresponds in latitude to <span class=
"u">Van Diemen's River</span> in the old chart
[Thevenot's.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>], but across the
entrance was an extensive flat, nearly dry, and would probably
prevent even boats from getting in. If this place had any title
to be called a river in 1664 [<i>i.e</i>., by
Tasman.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>], the coast must have
undergone a great alteration since that time."</blockquote>
<p><span class="a">Tasman's Chart</span>, according to Swart's
version, gives to his <span class="a">Van Diemen River</span> the
latitude of 17&deg; 30', and it cannot therefore be doubted that
Flinders was in error in supposing his "small opening" south of
the "little projection"&mdash;where, in fact, one of the mouths
of Leichhardt's <span class="a">Gilbert River</span> is pushing
out delta-mud into the Gulf to be the Van Diemen Inlet. The
"small opening" must be the <span class="a">Smithburn
River</span> of modern Lands Department maps, which is one of the
numerous mouths of the <span class="a">Gilbert</span>.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"14<i>th November,
continued</i>.&mdash;In the afternoon, our course along shore was
more westward; and this, with the increasing shallowness of the
water, made me apprehend that the Gulph would be found to
terminate nearly as represented in the old charts, and disappoint
the hopes formed of a strait or passage leading out at some other
part of Terra Australis. At 4 o'clock, after running more than an
hour in 3&frac12; fathoms, or less than 3 at high water, our
distance from the shore was 5 miles, and a <span class="u">small
opening</span> then bore S. 14&deg; E., which seems to be the
<span class="u">Caron River</span> marked at the south-east
extremity of the Gulph in the Dutch charts [<i>i.e</i>., in
Thevenot's version of Tasman's chart. My impression is that
Thevenot, in reducing Tasman's chart to an inconveniently small
scale, found himself crowded towards the south-eastern corner of
the Gulf and omitted some of Tasman's names.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>], but," continues Flinders, "whatever it might
have been in Tasman's time, no navigator would now think of
attempting to enter it with a ship. The latitude is 17&deg; 26'
and longitude 140&deg; 52' E. From 4 till 7, our course was W. by
S., close to the wind, the depths being mostly 3 fathoms and the
land barely within sight from the masthead. We then stood off;
and the water being smooth, anchored on muddy ground in 4&frac12;
fathoms, which became 3&frac12; at low water."</blockquote>
<p>The position of this anchorage is not given on Flinders' own
chart. The "small opening" in 17&deg; 26', which Flinders thought
might be <span class="a">Tasman's Caron River</span> , was the
mouth of the modern <span class="a">Norman River</span>, which
was named the <span class="a">Van Diemen Revier</span> by
<span class="a">Tasman</span> in 1644. The precise position of
the mouth, according to Captain John Lort Stokes' survey of 1844,
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> is 17&deg; 28'. Stokes suggests,
by a dotted line entering the sea in 17&deg; 23', the position of
the <span class="a">Caron River</span>, and in this position,
according to the Lands Department Map, Sheet 19A, there actually
appears an insignificant water-course. But it is easier to
believe that Flinders' position was two minutes too far north
than that it was three minutes too far south, and the mouth of
the <span class="a">Norman River</span>, however little Flinders
may have thought of its possibilities, is a genuine "opening" and
is at the present day the port for Normanton and the Croydon
goldfield. Granting that the modern <span class="a">Norman
River</span> is <span class="a">Tasman's Van Diemen</span> (and
there seems no room for doubt), his <span class="a">Van der
Lijn's Revier</span> was the "Bynoe" mouth of the <span class=
"u">Flinders River</span>, and his <span class="a">Caron
Revier</span> was the principal mouth of the Flinders. Flinders'
course after he saw (from a distance) the mouth of what he
erroneously took for the Caron was too far from the land to
permit of his seeing the Van der Lijn and Caron Inlets.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Admiralty Chart, No. 1807.]</blockquote>
<p>As Flinders, when he altered his course after passing the
supposed Caron Inlet, passed out of the waters of the Cape York
Peninsula, it is unnecessary for us to follow his further
progress with critical minuteness. Some observations on the
character of his work are, however, in place here.</p>
<p>From his earliest youth, Flinders had put before himself a
lofty ideal, his constant endeavour, as he declared, being to do
his work in such a manner that no one should have to come after
him to correct it. Incidentally, it may be mentioned that he
carried a chronometer, and his longitudes are reliable, which
even Cook's were not. The chronometer was first adapted to
navigation by James Harrison in 1735. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> It had been officially tested on a voyage
to Barbados in 1763, when its efficiency was demonstrated, and it
is odd that Cook was not furnished with one, and had to rely
mainly on lunar observations for his longitudes. <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> In a word, the accuracy of Flinders' own
work along the western coast of the Cape York Peninsula was
beyond praise. On the other hand, his interpretation of the work
of previous navigators was very faulty. For this, however, he
could hardly be blamed, as his identifications were for the most
part based on second-hand and erroneous <i>data</i>. He had not
the advantage of access to the most important documents,
[<i>viz.</i>], Carstenszoon's diary of the "<i>Pera's</i>" voyage
and Tasman's chart of his second voyage, both of which came to
light after his time. The onus of the confusion which has arisen
lies rather with those cartographers who came after him and who
treated his obviously tentative suggestions as authoritative
statements.</p>

<br>
<p>The "<i>Lady Nelson</i>" was destined to make another
appearance in Torres Strait. In 1824, with the double object of
extending British commerce with the east and forestalling the
suspected intention of the French to claim part of Australia,
H.M.S. "<i>Tamar</i>" Captain James Gordon Bremer, was sent out
from England to Sydney with instructions to establish a
settlement in the vicinity of Melville Island. At Sydney, the
"<i>Tamar</i>" was joined by the "<i>Countess of Harcourt</i>"
and the "<i>Lady Nelson</i>" commissioned by the colonial
authorities to assist in the conveyance of troops and stores.</p>
<p>The three ships sailed <i>via</i> Cape Grafton, Snapper
Island, Cape Tribulation, Cape Flattery and the Howick Islands,
passed Cape Melville and the Flinders Islands, and anchored off
Cape Direction on 12th September, 1824. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAPS C</a>, <a href=
"#map-b">B</a> AND <a href="#map-e">E</a> AND <span class=
"a">Admiralty Chart</span>, No. 2922.) Thence they sailed by
Forbes Island and <span class="a">Bligh's Sunday Island</span> to
the <span class="a">Bird Islands</span> <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> (13th September). (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>) From the Bird group
they sailed to <span class="a">Mount Adolphus Island,</span>
where they anchored on 14th September. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>) They had, in the
course of the day, passed <span class="a">Turtle Island</span>,
where <span class="a">Bligh</span> had been with the
"<i>Bounty's</i>" launch on a Tuesday (which may therefore be
considered his <span class="a">Tuesday Island</span>, even if he
did not name it so). On 15th September the "<i>Tamar</i>" and her
consorts passed <span class="a">Wednesday</span> and <span class=
"a">Thursday Islands</span>, got into the open sea and, keeping a
westerly course, crossed the mouth of the Gulf of Carpentaria, to
anchor at <span class="a">Port Essington</span> on 20th
September.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Bligh had landed on Lagoon Island, one of the
Bird group, on Monday, 1st June, 1789, and that may therefore be
regarded as his Monday Island.]</blockquote>
<p>So far as his journals and charts show, Bligh (1789) named
only Sunday and Wednesday Islands. Lagoon Island, of the Bird
group, and Turtle Island, off the mouth of the Escape River,
were, respectively, the islands at which he touched on Monday and
Tuesday. He named Wednesday Island because he passed it that day
on his way to the open sea, but obviously he could not have named
Thursday and Friday Islands. There is no Monday Island on modern
charts, but there are <span class="a">Tuesday, Thursday</span>
and <span class="a">Friday Islands</span> (the Tuesday Island not
being where Bligh was on Tuesday), and the question arises, who
named the three last? As regards Thursday Island, at least, the
date of its naming is narrowed down by its mention by the
Commander of the "<i>Lady Nelson</i>" to the period between 1789
and 1824. The probability is that <span class="a">King</span>
named Tuesday, Thursday and Friday Islands in 1818, although the
names do not appear on his charts.</p>
<p>Having completed her mission at Port Essington, the
"<i>Tamar</i>" left for Mauritius and England on 10th November,
1824, taking the "<i>Countess of Harcourt</i>" with her. The
"<i>Lady Nelson</i>" was left behind, to make herself useful in
the transport and provisioning services required by the new
settlement. On 28th February, 1825, she set out from the port to
bring buffaloes from Timor. She fell into the hands of pirates
and her men, with, apparently, only one exception, were murdered.
Her wreck lay for many years on the rocks at Baba Island, one of
the Serawatti group. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>

<p>S<small>ATISFIED</small> at last that he had really reached
the "bottom" of the Gulf and that there was no passage between
"New South Wales" and the "mainland of New Holland," and weary of
the monotonous flats defended by wide shoals, Flinders turned the
head of the "<i>Investigator</i>" to the northwest, in order to
survey the western shores of the Gulf. On 22<i>nd November</i>,
1802, an anchorage was found in <span class="a">Investigator
Roads</span>, between <span class="a">Sweers</span> and
<span class="a">Bentinck Islands</span>, and fears having arisen
as to the condition of the ship, she was careened and examined by
the carpenters. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-m">MAP
M.</a>) Their comprehensive report (26th November) may be summed
up in a single line of Kipling. The ship was "just a pack of
rotten planks puttied up with tar." With luck and fine weather
she might hold together for six months. Flinders resolved to
pursue his work until the monsoons abated, and then to make for
Sydney by the west side of Australia, unless forced by rough
weather to run for shelter to some port in the East Indies.</p>
<p>After such repairs had been made as were possible in the
circumstances, Tasman's <span class="a">Cape Van Diemen</span>
was found to be an island, and named <span class="a">Mornington
Island</span>. Next the <span class="a">Sir Edward Pellew</span>
group of <span class="a">Islands</span> was visited and named.
Here were found traces of the former presence of <span class=
"a">Malays</span>, in the shape of fragments of pottery,
basket-work, rags, etc. The so-called <span class="a">Cape
Maria</span> had to be called <span class="a">Maria
Island</span>. In <span class="a">Blue Mud Bay</span>, the
master's mate was fatally speared by <span class=
"a">natives</span>. <span class="a">Melville Bay</span> was
discovered on 12th February, 1803.</p>
<p>On 17<i>th February</i>, the "<i>Investigator</i>" left the
Gulf and steered west along the north coast of <span class=
"a">Arnhem Land</span>. Here were met no fewer than sixty
<span class="a">Malay Vessels</span>, in squadrons. Their
business was to collect <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> for sale to
Chinese merchants at Timor.</p>
<p>Early in March, a severe outbreak of <span class=
"a">Scurvy</span> reinforced the argument furnished by the rotten
condition of the ship in favour of a speedy return to Sydney.
Flinders therefore made for <span class="a">Timor</span>, which
was reached by the end of March. His intention was to send
Lieutenant Fowler home in any Europe-bound ship, with his reports
and charts, and a scheme for completing the survey. No such ship
offered itself, and the "<i>Investigator</i>" finally sailed for
Sydney on 16<i>th April</i>, 1803. She touched at <span class=
"a">Cape Leeuwin</span> and the north-west cape of Tasmania, but
otherwise gave the land a wide berth. <span class=
"a">Sydney</span> was reached on 9<i>th June</i>. Flinders was
the first to <span class="a">circumnavigate Australia</span>,
although Tasman had previously demonstrated its insularity, but
not its separation from Tasmania. The crew were in a very bad way
with scurvy and dysentery, and Flinders himself was much
debilitated. As for the "<i>Investigator</i>," she was in such a
crazy condition that Flinders believed she must have foundered
had she encountered a single gale between Timor and Sydney. She
had done her last exploratory work, and was broken up at Deptford
in 1810. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>

<p>A<small>FTER</small> consultation with Governor King, Flinders
determined to go to England as a passenger by the
"<i>Porpoise</i>" under command of Lieutenant Fowler, to lay his
charts and journals before the Admiralty and to solicit the grant
of another vessel to continue his investigations. Fowler's
instructions were to go by <span class="a">Torres Strait</span>
"by the <i>route</i> Captain Flinders may indicate." The
"<i>Porpoise</i>" left Sydney on 10th August, 1803, accompanied
by the "<i>Bridgewater</i>" of the East India Company, and the
"<i>Cato</i>" of London, both bound for Batavia. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Terra Australis</i>, II, p. 286.]</blockquote>
<p>On 17<i>th August</i>, the "<i>Porpoise</i>" which was in the
lead, struck on <span class="a">Wreck Reef</span> (22&deg; 11'
S., 155&deg; 13' E.) and the "<i>Cato</i>" immediately did the
same. The "<i>Bridgewater</i>" weathered the reef and shamefully
deserted her consorts. (She reached Bombay and left for London;
after which she was never heard of again.)</p>
<p>Three lives were lost in the <span class="a">Wreck</span>, but
the remainder (ninety-four in number) of the crews of the
"<i>Porpoise</i>" and "<i>Cato</i>" got on a dry sandbank. They
saved what they could from the stranded "Porpoise" including
three months' provisions and sails to make tents, but the
"<i>Cato</i>" had disappeared.</p>
<p>On <i>25th August</i>, Flinders took three weeks' rations and
left for Sydney, with Captain Park, of the "<i>Cato</i>" and
twelve men, in a six-oared boat. The men left on the sandbank did
fairly well on the rations saved from the "<i>Porpoise</i>"
supplemented by fish and turtle, and they built a boat of 32 feet
keel, which was ready for launching early in October.</p>
<p>Flinders arrived in <span class="a">Sydney</span> on 8<i>th
September</i>, his boat having rowed 700 miles in fourteen days,
and reported the disaster to Governor King. It was planned that
Captain Cummings, of the "<i>Rolla</i>" a 438-ton ship bound for
Canton, should call at the reef and take some of the shipwrecked
men to his destination, while the "<i>Francis</i>" was to bring
the rest back to Sydney. Flinders was to take command of the
"<i>Cumberland</i>" a 29-ton schooner, and sail her to England,
with his charts and papers.</p>
<p>The flotilla left <span class="a">Port Jackson</span> on
21<i>st September</i> and reached the sandbank on 7<i>th
October</i>. Flinders selected to go with him on the
"<i>Cumberland</i>" John Aken, late Master of the
"<i>Investigator</i>" Edward Charrington, Boatswain, John Elder,
Steward, and seven seamen; and, on 11<i>th October</i> the three
ships sailed for their respective destinations. From the first,
the "<i>Cumberland</i>" proved an unseaworthy craft.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>) Flinders
took her through <span class="a">Torres Strait</span>, past
<span class="a">Murray Island</span> (see Inset Map on Plate 13,
Terra Australis Atlas) on 22<i>nd October</i>, and thence, not
far from his track in the "<i>Investigator</i>" a year earlier,
but a little to the south, through what is now known as
<span class="a">Cumberland Passage</span>, and between
<span class="a">Horn</span> <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and
<span class="a">Wednesday Islands</span> (24th October), north of
<span class="a">Hammond Island</span>, and westward through
<span class="a">Prince of Wales Channel</span>, north of
<span class="a">Booby Island</span>, and westward, [<i>via</i>]
Arnhem Land, towards <span class="a">Timor</span>, which was
reached on 10<i>th November</i>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Flinders did not actually give this name, but
referred to "a hill forming something like two horns at the top."
This hill appeared to him to be on <span class="u">Prince of
Wales Island</span> itself, but as he approached it from the
north-east he got a glimpse of a bight, which must have been the
"<span class="u">Boat Passage</span>" separating what is now
called <span class="u">Horn Island</span> from Prince of Wales
Island. Flinders, as well as Cook, passed north of <span class=
"u">Albany Island</span>, taking it for part of the
mainland.]</blockquote>
<p>Flinders had originally planned to call at Koepang, in Timor,
Mauritius, the Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena and the Canaries;
but by King's desire Mauritius was cut out of the programme. As
it happened, there were no facilities for repairs at Koepang, and
Flinders therefore left, with his ship unrepaired, for the Cape.
Bad weather shortly afterwards compelled him, in spite of
himself, to run to the Mauritius for shelter: moreover, he
doubted if it would be safe to complete the voyage in the
"<i>Cumberland</i>" and hoped to sell her and get a passage to
England by some other ship. He arrived at Port Louis,
<span class="a">Mauritius</span>, on 17th December, 1803. When he
left Sydney, England had been at peace with France, but
<span class="a">War</span>, unknown to him, had broken out soon
after between the two countries.</p>
<p>The Governor, or Captain-General, of the island was
<span class="a">General De Caen</span>, an old soldier, who had
been, in fact, one of the most conspicuously heroic figures in
the battle of Hohenlinden, and was violently anti-British; and
Flinders was unfortunate enough to strike the wrong note with him
from the first. In the prejudiced eyes of the Governor, he
appeared, to begin with, as an impostor; next as a spy; and
finally as an enemy who knew too much to be safely set free; and
all the time as a person of arrogant and unconciliatory bearing,
who demanded rights where he should have sued for favours. This
was very far indeed from being the true character of Flinders;
but he was wounded by the hostile reception he met with when he
expected a sympathetic welcome and generous assistance. On the
other hand, it was undeniable that his passport was three years
old and was for the "<i>Investigator</i>" and not for the
"<i>Cumberland</i>" and he should have made allowance for the
fact that his mere presence at the Mauritius in a time of war
would naturally raise a suspicion that he was not engaged in the
investigation covered by his French passport. Although when
Flinders left Sydney, Governor King had objected to his touching
at the Mauritius, he had foreseen the possibility of the
"<i>Cumberland</i>" being driven by stress of weather into French
waters, and that, in such a case, the necessity would arise for
an explanation of her presence there. Accordingly, he had
provided Flinders with two letters addressed to General Magallon,
Governor of the Mauritius (De Caen's predecessor), to be
forwarded from the Cape, or by such opportunity as might offer
itself. These letters, together with passports and commission,
were actually sent ashore for the Governor's inspection when
Flinders found himself obliged to seek shelter and assistance.
The probability is that De Caen chose to regard them as personal
and not official letters and declined to read them; or if he did
read them, considered them irrelevant, and confined himself to
the consideration of the passport and commission.</p>
<p>The details of <span class="a">Flinders' captivity</span> on
the island, which grew, as it did, out of a misunderstanding, are
most distressing, but he received much kindness from civilians
and from some of the French officers. His detention lasted till
13th June, 1810. Although, on 1st March, 1806, Napoleon, then
Emperor, ordered Flinders' release, the order did not reach
Mauritius till July, 1807, and by that time De Caen considered
that the circumstances had altered, and took the responsibility
of disobeying the order, pending further instructions. Britain
had, in fact, gained the mastery of the sea; had taken possession
of the Cape of Good Hope; and was threatening Mauritius. In June,
1809, a British squadron was actually blockading the island. On
15th March, De Caen consented to the liberation of Flinders. On
13th June, Flinders had his sword returned to him and was
liberated on parole. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The
blockading squadron being still outside the harbour, Flinders
arranged for a passage in the "<i>Otter</i>" to the Cape, where
he was delayed for six weeks. In August, 1810, he embarked on the
"<i>Olympia</i>" and he reached <span class="a">England</span> on
23<i>rd October</i>. He lost no time in rejoining the wife he had
left as a bride more than nine years before. The British captured
Mauritius on 3rd December, 1810.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Terra Australis</i>, II, p. 381.]</blockquote>
<p>In spite of failing health, Flinders laboured for over three
years on his narrative and charts, and his great work on Terra
Australis was published in 1814. The first copy of the book and
atlas came to his hand on 18th July, and he died on the 19th. His
wife lived till 1852, and he left a daughter, born 1st April,
1812.</p>

<h4>&sect;1. FIRST VOYAGE OF THE "MERMAID"</h4>
<p>C<small>APTAIN</small>, afterwards Admiral, <span class=
"a">Phillip Parker King</span>, a son of Phillip Gidley King, who
had been Governor of New South Wales from 1800 to 1805, left
England in 1819 in H.M.S. "<i>Mermaid</i>" on a surveying cruise
along the Australian coast. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> He
was accompanied by Allan Cunningham as Botanist.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Narrative of a Survey of Intertropical and
Western Coasts of Australia, 1819-22</i>, by Admiral Phillip P.
King. London, 1827.]</blockquote>
<p>On 27<i>th June</i>, 1819, the "<i>Mermaid</i>" anchored in
the <span class="a">Endeavour River</span>. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>) Amicable relations
were maintained with the <span class="a">natives</span> for
nearly a week, but on 2nd July the aboriginal instincts of
curiosity and acquisitiveness brought about a rupture. Some of
the sailors were washing clothes, to which the natives took a
violent fancy, going so far as to insist that one of the sailors
should denude himself for their benefit. They threw a spear, and
shots had to be fired over their heads before they would desist.
Two days later, they attempted to decoy and ambush the white
visitors.</p>
<p>On 8<i>th July</i>, a boat was rowed up the <span class=
"a">Endeavour River</span> to the limit of boat navigation, about
10 miles "as the crow flies," and this portion of the river was
charted and soundings were taken. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> In this chart, the name "<span class=
"a">Mount Cook</span>" appears for the first time.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Plan of Endeavour River, surveyed by Mr. J. S.
Roe, Master Mate of H.M. cutter "<i>Mermaid</i>,"
1819.]</blockquote>
<p>The ship left the harbour on 11<i>th July</i>, and followed
the coast to the north. After passing <span class="a">Cape
Bedford</span> and <span class="a">Cape Flattery</span>, Lieut.
Jeffreys named the <span class="a">Cole Group of Islands</span>
(off Murdoch Point), <span class="a">Cape Bowen</span> <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> and <span class="a">Cape Ninian</span>.
On 14<i>th July</i>, the "<i>Mermaid</i>" passed <span class=
"a">Cape Flinders</span>, the northmost point of Stanley Island,
Flinders Group (14&deg; 8' S.; 144&deg; 14" E.), where the wreck
of the "<i>Frederick</i>" was seen. On 20<i>th July</i>, King
named <span class="a">Haggerston</span> and the <span class=
"a">Sir Everard Home Islands</span> and <span class="a">Margaret
Bay</span>, all in the vicinity of Cape Grenville. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>) Bligh had already
crossed the mouth of Margaret Bay in the "<i>Bounty's</i>"
launch, in 1789.</p>
<blockquote>[2) My notebook contains a sketch of Cape Bowen,
taken from the steamer "<i>Normanby</i>" on 9th July, 1877. The
bare hillside shows three thick horizontal beds of sandstone,
separated by soft beds, presumably of shales, and resting on what
appear to be highly inclined schistose rocks.]</blockquote>
<p>On 24<i>th July</i>, the <span class="a">McArthur</span> and
<span class="a">Hannibal Islands</span> were named. <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-a">MAP A.</a>) The same day the "<i>Mermaid</i>" grounded
off the mouth of the <span class="a">Escape River</span> and was
got off with great difficulty. It is to this incident that the
river owes its name, and not, as is generally supposed, to the
attempted escape of Kennedy.</p>
<blockquote>[3) King also named Hannibal Bay, but the name, for
some reason, has been omitted from modern charts.]</blockquote>
<p>From the Escape River, King steered (25<i>th July</i>) NNW.,
altering his course to NW. between <span class="a">Albany</span>
and <span class="u">Mount Adolphus Islands</span>. Practically
following the <i>route</i> taken by Bligh in the
"<i>Bounty's</i>" launch, he rounded the northern capes of
<span class="a">Wednesday</span> and <span class="a">Hammond
Islands</span>S. Thence, between <span class="a">Good
Island</span> and the <span class="a">North-west Reef</span>
(<span class="a">Prince of Wales Channel</span>), he followed the
track of Flinders, in the "<i>Cumberland</i>" to <span class=
"a">Booby Island</span>. The long distance from the Escape River
to Booby Island was covered in a single day. Crossing the Gulf of
Carpentaria, <span class="a">Wessel's Island</span> was reached
on 28<i>th July</i>. (<span class="a">Admiralty Chart</span>, No.
447.)</p>
<h4>&sect;2. THIRD VOYAGE OF THE "MERMAID"</h4>
<p>The "<i>Mermaid's</i>" second voyage does not concern the
present inquiry. On her third, she left Sydney on 14<i>th
June</i>, 1820, and anchored for the second time in the
<span class="a">Endeavour River</span> on 27<i>th July</i>. The
previous watering-place was found to be dry. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>) The party made
observations and took in wood and water, and explored the land
within a radius of 6 miles. The <span class="a">natives</span>
appeared inclined to be tricky: on one occasion, they approached
furtively dragging spears with their toes.</p>
<p>The anchor was weighed on 5<i>th August</i>, and on the
following day a party landed on the <span class="a">Lizard
Island</span>, where rough weather detained the ship till the
8<i>th</i>. She touched on the 13<i>th</i> at Bligh's
<span class="a">Sunday Island</span>, off Cape Grenville, and on
the 14<i>th</i> at <span class="a">Cairncross Island</span>.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>) On
15<i>th</i>-16<i>th June</i>, King followed Cook's track through
<span class="a">Endeavour Strait</span> to <span class="a">Booby
Island</span>. He passed <span class="a">Cape Wessel</span> on
19<i>th August</i>, and reached Botany Bay on 4<i>th
December</i>, 1820. (<span class="a">Admiralty Chart</span>, No.
447.)</p>
<h4>&sect;3. VOYAGE OF THE "BATHURST"</h4>
<p>A survey of the "<i>Mermaid</i>" in Sydney showed her to be
unfit for further sea service, and after consultation with
Governor Macquarie the purchase of a 170-ton brig was effected.
The ship was renamed the "<i>Bathurst</i>" Her complement was 33
men, among whom were Allan Cunningham, Botanical Collector,
Andrew Montgomery, Surgeon, and an aboriginal named Bardwell. The
"<i>Bathurst</i>" left Sydney on 26<i>th May</i>, 1821,
accompanied by the merchant ship "<i>Dick</i>," bound for
Batavia. On 17<i>th June</i>, the merchant brig "<i>San
Antonio</i>," from Sydney for Singapore, was overtaken at the
largest of the <span class="a">Frankland Islands</span> (17&deg;
15' S., opposite the mouth of the Mulgrave River), and she
followed the "<i>Bathurst</i>" and "<i>Dick</i>." (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-k">MAP K.</a>) The same night they
anchored in <span class="a">Trinity Bay</span>, where they rode
out a storm. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-g">MAP
G.</a>) On 20<i>th June</i>, they were at <span class="a">Lizard
Island</span>, which, according to King, is granite.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>) On
21<i>st June</i>, they rounded <span class="a">Cape
Melville</span> and crossed Bathurst Bay, landing, 22<i>nd
June</i> (at <span class="a">Bathurst Head</span>?). Here the
landing party was surprised and threatened by <span class=
"a">natives</span>, and one man was slightly wounded. Presumably,
the Bay, the Head and the Bathurst Range were named on this
occasion. This voyage showed that <span class="a">Cape
Flinders</span>, till then believed to be a point of the
mainland, was really the northern extremity of the chain of
islands which prolongs Bathurst Head to the north for about 10
miles, and, as King demonstrated the fact, it may be assumed that
it was he who gave the islands the name of the <span class=
"a">Flinders Group</span> which they still bear. Cook had no idea
of the contour of this portion of the coast, as he was too far to
the east to see it in fact, outside of the Barrier Reef. Flinders
was still further east, both in the "<i>Investigator</i>" and
"<i>Cumberland</i>."</p>
<p>On 23<i>rd June</i>, <span class="a">Cunningham</span>
observed aboriginal <span class="a">cave-drawings</span> on
schistose rocks, underlying sandstone, on <span class="a">Clack's
Island</span> (144&deg; 15' E., 14&deg; 5' S.). They were
executed in white on a ground of red ochre, and represented
sharks, porpoises, turtles, lizards, tripang, starfish, clubs,
canoes, water-gourds and quadrupeds.</p>
<p>The ships were detained by bad weather from 27<i>th June</i>
to 1<i>st July</i>, on which day they reached the opening between
<span class="a">Albany</span> and <span class="a">Mount Adolphus
Islands</span>. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP
A.</a>) Thence they followed the "<i>Mermaid's</i>" track of 1818
to Booby Island, <i>via</i> Prince of Wales Channel. The
"<i>Bathurst</i>" left <span class="a">Booby Island</span>, where
she parted with the "<i>Dick</i>" and "<i>San Antonio</i>" on
1<i>st July</i>. <span class="a">Cape Wessel</span> was reached
on 3<i>rd July</i>, 1821, and <span class="a">Sydney</span> on
25<i>th April</i>, 1822.</p>
<p>The series of Admiralty Charts issued after King's surveys,
bringing the charts of Cook and Flinders up to date, may be said
to have set the hydrography of the Coral Sea on a firm
foundation. There were, however, many shoals, reefs and other
dangers still to be located before Torres Strait could be safely
navigated by sailing vessels.</p>
<p>King was responsible for the "<span class="a">Inner
Passage</span>" in the first issue of the Sailing Directions.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Two notes from the "Directions"
may be quoted here, with a view to their preservation:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The "<i>Lalla Rookh</i>" passing eastward through Torres
Strait in 1821, struck a reef "inside of "(<i>i.e</i>., east of)
<span class="a">Booby Island</span>. She was repaired at
<span class="a">Port Lihou</span>, on the south side of Prince of
Wales Island, and concluded her voyage to Sydney outside of the
Barrier Reef.</p>
<p>2. H.M.S. "<i>Tamar</i>" touched at <span class="a">Mount
Adolphus Island</span> in 1824.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> "<i>Charles Eaton</i>" a 313-ton barque,
commanded by <span class="a">Captain G. F. Moore</span>, left
Sydney on 29th July, 1834, for Canton, and was <span class=
"a">wrecked</span> on the Barrier Reef, near the <span class=
"a">Sir Charles Hardy Islands</span>. (<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>) The only available boat was taken by
George Pigott (Boatswain), Laurence Constantine (Carpenter), and
three seamen, two of whom were William Frendall and Joseph
Wright. The four above named, having sailed through Torres
Strait, landed at Timor Laut after a run of only five days, the
fifth man having died on the voyage. It was not till twelve
months later that they were able to leave the island, and they
eventually reached Amboyna and Batavia, whence the news of the
wreck slowly travelled to Sydney.</p>
<p>The story told by these men was that on 15th August, 1834, the
"<i>Charles Eaton</i>" "was making for an apparent opening in the
reef near Sir Charles Hardy's Islands" (ENE. of Cape Grenville)
when she grounded. "She fell broadside on, the sea making a clear
breach over her. The longboat and one of the quarter boats were
stove. The remaining boat was lowered and three seamen jumped
into her. The Captain and officers determined to continue in the
ship, as they thought the boat could not live. The rest of the
crew and passengers went on the poop."</p>
<p>The Captain of the ship "<i>Mangles</i>" reported that he had
seen, on an island in Torres Strait, a white boy who said he had
been in the wreck of the "<i>Charles Eaton</i>" The Captain made
an unsuccessful attempt to get the boy from the natives.</p>
<p>For the rescue of any of the crew or passengers who might
still be alive among the natives, the Government of New South
Wales fitted out their schooner the "<i>Isabella</i>" under
command of <span class="a">Captain C. M. Lewis</span>. The
Captain's journal was edited by <span class="a">Captain Phillip
Parker King</span>, R.N. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
Additional particulars are given by <span class="a">William
Edward Brockett</span>. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> The
words "I shipped on the '<i>Isabella</i>'" are the only clue to
the capacity in which Brockett was on board, but he was evidently
an educated man, and was occasionally entrusted with difficult
and delicate duties, so that it may be taken for granted that he
was an officer.</p>

Eaton</i>" became a hopeless wreck, but the upper part held
together and gave a foothold for the greater number of the
passengers and crew.</p>
<p>When she left Sydney, there were altogether thirty-one persons
on the ship, including about a dozen passengers, among whom were
Captain D'Oyley, H.E.I. Co.'s Artillery, his wife, two sons and a
native Indian servant, Dr. Grant and George Armstrong, Barrister.
Five left with the boat, leaving twenty-six on the wreck.</p>
<p>After the departure of the boat, as above related, the first
raft was constructed, but it proved of insufficient capacity. The
raft, therefore, carrying only nine persons, [<i>viz.</i>]
Captain Lewis, Dr. Grant, Mr. Armstrong, Captain D'Oyley, his
wife and two sons and native servant, with, probably, an officer
or seaman, left the ship. Of the fate of this <span class=
"a">First Raft</span> little is known with certainty. The only
survivors were the two D'Oyley boys, who said that the
<span class="a">Adults</span> of the party had all been killed.
The boys were taken in a canoe to an island, probably
<span class="a">Aureed</span>, and in all probability the heads
of the adults were taken there at the same time. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>) So at least we are
justified in conjecturing from what happened to the occupants of
the second raft.</p>
<p>Seven days after the first, a <span class="a">Second
Raft</span> left the ship, carrying seventeen persons, including
Mr. Clare (Chief Officer), W. Mayor (2nd Officer), John Ireland
(Steward's Boy), a boy named Sexton, and thirteen others. These,
after being two days and nights half-immersed in the sea, on a
daily ration of two glasses of water and half a biscuit, drifted
among a number of small islands. In the morning of the third day,
they saw a canoe, carrying about a dozen natives, approaching.
The natives were apparently unarmed, and appeared very friendly.
Proposals that the castaways should land were acceded to, and
they were taken in the canoe to "the island of <span class=
"a">Boydan</span>." (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-b">MAP B</a>, <span class="a">Boydong</span>, lat. 11&deg;
30' S., about 40 miles north-west of the Sir Charles Hardy
Islands.)</p>
<p>On this island, where there was neither water nor food, the
castaways lay defenceless, sleeping the sleep of utter
exhaustion, when they were set upon and <span class="a">beaten to
Death</span>, with the exception of <span class=
"a">Ireland</span> and <span class="a">Sexton</span>, who for
some reason were spared, although Ireland had a spear wound.
Growing boys have obviously some potential value, even among
savages. The heads of the murdered men were cut off and placed,
together with Ireland and Sexton, in a canoe which proceeded to
<span class="a">Aureed Island</span>, where a party of natives
were in temporary residence for the fishing season, and where
they found the two <span class="a">D'Oyley Boys</span>, who had
arrived before them. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-a">MAP A.</a>)</p>
<p>With the addition of the crew of the canoes from Boydong and
their captives, and the murderers of the castaways of the first
raft and their captives, there were now on this island about
fifty persons. About two months after the arrival of Ireland and
Sexton, the natives left the island in two parties. No. 1
<span class="a">Party</span> took Ireland and the two-year-old
D'Oyley boy, and No. 2 <span class="a">Party</span> took Sexton
and the elder D'Oyley boy, and both set out in their canoes, for
destinations which were of course unknown to the captives.</p>
<p>The boys with No. 2 <span class="a">Party</span> of savages
were never heard of again. No. 1 <span class="a">Party</span>,
after cruising among islands for some weeks, reached <span class=
"a">Marsden Island</span>. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> To
this island came, after a time, a native named Dappar and his
wife, who took Ireland and the younger D'Oyley boy to their home
on <span class="a">Murray Island</span>, where they were kindly
treated until their rescue by the "<i>Isabella</i>."</p>
<blockquote>[1) This island was probably named in honour of the
Rev. Samuel Marsden, Rector of St. John's, Parramatta, who, in
1812 and for many years after, was unofficially regarded as "the
head of the English Church in New South Wales." See J. P.
McGuanne in <i>Journ. Roy. Aust. Hist. Soc.,</i> Vol. V
(1919).]</blockquote>
<p>Ireland related that at <span class="a">Boydong Island</span>
the savages ate the eyes and cheeks of the murdered people, not,
as he judged, for food, but with an idea that the act would
increase their efficiency against enemies.</p>
<p>The "<i>Isabella</i>" left <span class="a">Sydney</span> on
3<i>rd June</i>, 1836, and on the 9<i>th</i> was "in the latitude
of <span class="a">Cato's Reef</span>" (23&deg; 20' S. and
155&deg; 35' E.). (<span class="a">Admiralty Chart</span>, No.
780.) Six days later, Captain Lewis saw floating wreckage, but
did not suppose it to have come from the "<i>Charles Eaton</i>."
On 17<i>th June</i>, the northmost reefs of the <span class=
"a">Eastern Fields</span> (<span class="a">Admiralty
Chart</span>, No. 2759 A) were rounded and a westward course was
set for the "<span class="a">Pandora Passage</span>" in the
Barrier Reef (<span class="a">Admiralty Chart</span>, No. 2422),
which was cleared in lat. 9&deg; 58' S. and long. 144&deg; 46' E.
on the 18<i>th</i>, and before noon of that day the anchor was
dropped off Murray Island. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) The <i>route</i> is plotted in ink, with notes in
Captain Lewis' own handwriting, on a copy of Flinders' Chart, Pl.
XIII of the Atlas to Terra Australis, in the Mitchell
Library.</blockquote>
<p>In the absence of all information, Captain Lewis' obvious
course would have been to commence his search for survivors at
the Sir Charles Hardy Islands, where the wreck took place. But
the meeting of the captain of the "<i>Mangles</i>" with a white
boy on an island in Torres Strait indicated that survivors might
be searched for further to the north, and therefore <span class=
"a">Murray Island</span> was selected as the starting-point.</p>
<p>Natives of Murray Island came out in canoes and made known by
signs that a white man was with them. This man, who proved to be
<span class="a">John Ireland</span>, two years older than when he
shipped as Steward's Boy on the "<i>Charles Eaton</i>" was
ultimately brought out to the "<i>Isabella</i>" and exchanged for
tomahawks. Later on, <span class="a">William</span>, the younger
of the <span class="a">D'Oyley</span> boys, was also produced and
ransomed, the chief difficulty being his reluctance to part with
his black foster-mother. He did not understand English, but spoke
the Murray Island language fluently.</p>
<p>On 24<i>th June</i>, the "<i>Isabella's</i>" launch was sent
to <span class="a">Wyer Island</span>, south of Murray Island,
where the men saw a string of <span class="a">Human Skulls</span>
in a hut. There was no reason to suppose that the skulls were
those of white men, but they, no doubt, gave Captain Lewis a
hint.</p>
<p>Four days later, the "<i>Isabella</i>" left for Darnley
Island, steering north-west, but grounded on Canoe Key, where she
was detained for a week. On the 5<i>th July</i>, she sailed round
the reefs east and north of <span class="a">Darnley
Island</span>, and anchored on the north side of the island. The
natives recognised the two boys. The island was searched for
survivors of the wreck, but without avail. On 21st July, the low
woody islands west of Darnley Island, [<i>viz.</i>], <span class=
"a">Stephen's</span> and <span class="a">Campbell's</span>, were
searched, and also (by parties in the two whaleboats) islands
lying to the windward, known by the native names of <span class=
"a">Masseed</span> and <span class="a">Caddow</span> (presumably
the two <span class="a">Yorke Islands</span> designated on the
modern chart <span class="a">Massik</span> and <span class=
"a">Kodall</span>). <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> The
inhabitants, who were apparently in a state of great alarm and
anxious to get rid of their visitors, came down to the beach,
offering gifts of coco-nuts, shells, etc. Ireland believed that
they had skulls hidden in the bush, but they denied the
imputation and fled.</p>
<blockquote>[2) Such variations are only natural when Europeans
spell foreign words phonetically.</blockquote>
<p>On 25<i>th July</i>, the "<i>Isabella</i>" anchored at
<span class="a">Aureed Island</span>, which was carefully
searched. No natives were met with, but in a hut there were found
a great number of <span class="a">Skulls</span>, many of them
having marks of violence, lashed with rope of European make to a
mask-like figure of turtle-shell. The skulls were taken
possession of and carried to Sydney, where a sufficient number
were pronounced to be <span class="a">of European Origin</span>
to account for the majority of the shipwrecked people.</p>
<p>The object of the expedition had been attained, and the
"<i>Isabella</i>" left Aureed on 26<i>th July</i>, on the home
voyage, calling at <span class="a">Halfway, Mount Adolphus</span>
and <span class="a">Double Islands</span>. While at Double
Island, the "<i>Isabella</i>" was overtaken by the
"<i>Tigris</i>" It appeared that the latter had sailed south-west
from Murray Island by a new <i>route</i>, now known as the
<span class="a">Tigris Passage</span>, changed her course to
north-west and rounded the north end of Halfway Island and
followed on the track taken by the "<i>Isabella</i>" to
<span class="a">Double Island</span>. The two ships left Double
Island on 2nd August, passed through the <span class="a">Prince
of Wales Channel</span>, passed <span class="a">Booby
Island</span> on 3rd August and reached <span class="a">Raffles
Bay</span>, and ultimately <span class="a">Timor</span>, where
they parted, the "<i>Isabella</i>" for Sydney and the
"<i>Tigris</i>" for India.</p>
<p>Although the geographical results of the "<i>Isabella's</i>"
voyage were of no great importance, the voyage furnished
ethnological <i>data</i> of considerable value. It gave, before
the disturbing influence of a white invasion had had time to make
itself seriously felt, a picture of the islands of the Coral Sea
inhabited by a race of Papuan type, absolutely distinct from the
Australian, who, while carrying their agricultural acquirements
with them, had specialised in navigation and fishing, roaming
from island to island in their canoes, fishing and turtle-hunting
here and there at what their observation of winds, rains and
currents had taught them were seasonable times for their
pursuits, with, probably, only a limited enjoyment of home or
head quarters. They worked the islands and fishing and hunting
grounds on a carefully thought out plan, comparable to a
scientific rotation of crops. As far as their opportunities
permitted, they were <span class="a">Head-hunters</span> and
<span class="a">Slavers</span>. They penetrated by sea at least
as far south as <span class="a">Cape Grenville</span>, and it is
very singular indeed that they seem never to have attempted to
seize or settle upon the mainland of Australia, and that they had
communicated very few of their accomplishments to the inhabitants
of the continent. So far as observation goes, slight or local
infusions of Papuan blood into the Australian race are the only
traces of their descents on the coast. It seems to me that the
only possible explanation must be that they had not had time
enough to make their mark on the Cape York Peninsula. In other
words, it may not have been many centuries, or perhaps not even
many generations, since they had begun their systematic
exploitation of the Torres Strait islands and reefs. To all
appearances, they had not had time, up to 1836, to exhaust or
seriously impoverish the fishing and hunting grounds which it was
their custom to harry year after year.</p>
<p>It is stated by Captain Watson <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> that Captain Moore, of the "<i>Charles
Eaton</i>" carried <span class="a">Captain Samuel Ashmore's
Charts</span>, which I have been unable to find, although modern
Admiralty charts locate several "dangers," etc., as having been
"seen by Mr. Ashmore." According to Captain Watson, Ashmore was
"a well-known master mariner of Sydney who, like Captain Thomas
Beckford Simpson, of a decade or two later, never went a voyage
without, on his return, giving his brother mariners and the
public the benefit of what he learned by a careful study of the
many problems which confronted the early navigators, of the
dangers on the Australian coast."</p>

<h4>THE "BEAGLE"<br>
&sect;1. FIRST CAPE YORK SURVEYING VOYAGE, 1839</h4>
<p>O<small>N</small> 29<i>th May</i>, 1839, Commander John
Clements Wickham left Sydney in H.M.S. "<i>Beagle</i>" to explore
the northern part of the Australian continent. The story of this
and the other Australian voyages of the "<i>Beagle</i>" is told
by Captain (afterwards Admiral) J. Lort Stokes, who succeeded
Wickham in the command in 1841. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Discoveries in Australia, with an Account of
the Coasts and Rivers Explored and Surveyed during the Voyage of
H.M.S. "Beagle" in the Years 1837-43, by Command of the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty.</i> By Captain J. Lort Stokes,
Commander, R.N. London, 1846.</blockquote>
<p>An interesting link with the last important surveying voyage
was found at Port Stephens, where Wickham and his officers were
the guests of <span class="a">Captain Phillip Parker King</span>,
who was settled as Superintendent of the <span class=
"a">Australian Agricultural Company</span>. This company, in
about eighty years of usefulness, up to the present date has
contributed greatly to the industrial progress of Australia.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>)</p>
<p>In crossing Princess Charlotte Bay, Wickham identified the
"remarkable level-topped hill" called by Captain Cook,
<span class="a">Jane's Tableland</span>. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>)</p>
<p>At the northern extremity of Lloyd Bay, he surveyed Cook's
<span class="a">Cape Weymouth</span> and Bligh's <span class=
"a">Restoration Island</span>, which he observed were of
granite.</p>
<p>In <span class="a">Boydong Island</span>, he recognised the
scene of the massacre of the castaways on the second raft from
the "<i>Charles Eaton</i>" (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-a">MAP A.</a>)</p>
<p>Sailing, as Cook had done, between Reefs Y and Z, and between
the Brothers and Albany Islands, the "<i>Beagle</i>" was headed
for <span class="a">Mount Adolphus Island</span>, where (in
Blackwood Bay) the anchor was dropped on 12<i>th July</i>. From
Mount Adolphus Island, she sailed west, past <span class=
"a">Possession Island</span>, into <span class="a">Endeavour
Strait</span>. In this neighbourhood, channels about the
<span class="a">Wallis Islands</span> and Cape Cornwall
(<span class="a">Prince of Wales Island</span>) were surveyed.
Wickham called the largest of the Prince of Wales Islands
<span class="a">Cook Island</span>, but the name has not been
adopted in official cartography. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<blockquote>[2) The "group" name of Prince of Wales Islands has
been dropped, and the largest island alone is now known as Prince
of Wales Island, the others having received distinctive names,
such as Wednesday, Hammond, Horn, and so on.]</blockquote>
<p>A few days afterwards, the "<i>Beagle</i>" passed <span class=
"a">Booby Island</span>, on her way to Port Essington. Some
particulars regarding this island recorded by Stokes are worthy
of preservation. The island, he says, is 30 feet above sea-level
and is composed of porphyry. The famous "<span class="a">Post
Office</span>" was started in 1835 by Captain Hobson, of the
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>" (afterwards Governor of New Zealand), who
also erected a flagstaff on the island.</p>
<p>Wickham's observations and experiences during the rest of this
voyage may be briefly alluded to.</p>
<p>Leaving <span class="a">Port Essington</span> on 4<i>th
September</i>, 1839, he called at <span class="a">Port
Darwin</span> (12<i>th September</i>), and then he and Stokes
explored the <span class="a">Victoria River</span> in boats.
(<span class="a">Admiralty Chart</span>, No. 2759 A.) Afterwards,
on landing at <span class="a">Point Pearce</span>, near the mouth
of that river, to correct his chronometers, Stokes was speared in
the left shoulder by <span class="a">natives</span> from an
ambush in a cliff. Having drawn out the spear, he ran, with the
natives in pursuit, to safety in the arms of a party of sailors
coming from the boat with instruments. By 12th December, he had
recovered from the wound sufficiently to bear the motion of the
vessel, which accordingly left Point Pearce for the Swan River
settlement. Twelve days later, he was "just able to crawl on the
poop." At the <span class="a">Swan River</span>, he was
interested in the shipping in Gage's Roads, which included some
American whalers, and in the infant city of <span class=
"a">Perth</span>. On 25th March, 1840, he visited the penal
establishment for aborigines on <span class="a">Rottnest
Island</span>. A surveying cruise to the north, along the western
coast of Australia, commenced on 4th April and ended at
<span class="a">Timor</span> on 23rd July, 1840.</p>
<p><span class="a">Timor</span> was left behind about 9th August.
The <span class="a">Swan River</span> was revisited. The town of
<span class="a">Albany</span> was visited on 2nd and <span class=
"a">Adelaide</span> on 27th November, and the "<i>Beagle</i>"
returned to <span class="a">Sydney</span> on 23<i>rd
December</i>.</p>
<h4>&sect;2. SECOND CAPE YORK SURVEYING VOYAGE, 1841</h4>
<p>On 3<i>rd June</i>, 1841, the "<i>Beagle</i>" again left
<span class="a">Sydney</span> for Torres Strait, this time in
command of Captain Stokes, as Captain Wickham had not recovered
from dysentery contracted at the Swan River. On anchoring on
19<i>th June</i> at <span class="a">Restoration Island</span>,
off Cape Weymouth (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-b">MAP B</a>), it was found that the island was temporarily
occupied by a large party of <span class="a">Blacks</span> from
Torres Strait, who had come in canoes. Some further surveying was
done between <span class="a">Possession</span> and <span class=
"a">Wallis Islands</span> (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-a">MAP A</a>), and <span class="a">Booby Island</span> was
reached on 23rd June (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-h">MAP H).</a></p>
<p>On 27<i>th June</i>, the "<i>Beagle</i>" lay off <span class=
"a">Bold Point</span> (17&deg; S.; 140&deg; 56' E.), on the Cape
York Peninsula. Two miles north-north-east of the point, an inlet
was observed, and, following Flinders, it was taken for Tasman's
Van Diemen Inlet. It was explored in whale-boats by Messrs.
Forsyth, Fitzmaurice and Tarrant up to fresh water, a distance of
27 miles by the windings, but not more than 10 in a direct
east-south-easterly line. <span class="a">natives</span> were
seen, but they displayed no hostility. This inlet is, in fact, as
later exploration has proved, the largest of the many
<span class="a">Mouths of the Gilbert River</span>.</p>
<p>Leaving Bold Point on 5<i>th July</i>, the "<i>Beagle</i>"
reached <span class="a">Bountiful Island</span> <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> (16&deg; 41' S.; 139&deg; 55' E.), east
of Mornington Island, the following day. On 8<i>th July</i>, she
dropped anchor in <span class="a">Investigator Roads</span>,
between Sweers and Bentinck Islands. (<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-m">MAP M.</a>) On the latter were found the well
sunk by Flinders and a tree branded "Investigator." About a dozen
<span class="a">natives</span> were observed under <span class=
"a">Mount Inspection</span>, but they displayed no hostility.</p>
<blockquote>[1) So named by Flinders on account of the abundance
of turtles.]</blockquote>
<p>Surveying and sounding in this neighbourhood occupied the time
till 21st July.</p>
<p>Two boats were sent out from Investigator Roads on 9th July,
under Lieutenants Forsyth and Parker. They returned on the 13th
with the report that they had passed to the south of Bentinck
Island and landed at <span class="a">Point Bailey</span>
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-n">MAP N.</a>), between
which and the south end of Mornington Island were what were named
the <span class="a">Forsyth Islands</span>. At <span class=
"a">Point Bailey</span> (139&deg; 4' E.; 16&deg; 55' S.), a
native well was observed. Ten and a half miles to the south-east
was <span class="a">Point Parker</span>, where, from a hillock 30
feet in height, there was a view of "a vast level."</p>
<blockquote class="inline">[In 1881, Point Parker became "a name
to conjure with," as it, or some place near it, was designated as
the northern terminus of a "Transcontinental Railway" which, as
an "all-Queensland" line, was to connect the existing railway
from Brisbane to Charleville with the Gulf of Carpentaria, and
thus shorten the line of communication between Australia and
England. The distinguishing feature of the undertaking was that,
on the American model, the interior of the country was to be
settled along the railway on a land-grant system, of which
principle Sir Thomas McIlwraith's government approved. The
railway was to be constructed by a British syndicate and handed
over to the Government, the syndicate receiving as a
consideration alternate blocks of land on both sides of it. There
seemed no reason why the settlement of a large inland population
should not have followed the realisation of such a scheme, as was
the experience of America.<br>
<br>
It was, however, too good an opportunity to be missed by the
rising Labour Party, and the Government fell, on a cry, raised by
Sir Samuel Griffith and his followers, of the danger involved in
the "alienation of the people's patrimony." The immediate
construction by the new Government, on borrowed money, of a
railway to the Cloncurry copper-field was promised as an
alternative. It was not, however, till the end of 1907 that
Cloncurry was connected with Townsville by rail. The delay of
twenty-six years deprived the great majority of the pioneer
discoverers of the copper-fields of the just reward of their
struggles; there was no population settled on "alternate blocks";
and the Townsville railway does not answer the purpose of a
"transcontinental" line, as it adds, for the produce of the
mines, the circumnavigation of Australia to the distance from a
European market.<br>
<br>
Major-General the Hon. William Feilding was in charge of the
Transcontinental Railway Expedition, and he traversed the country
from Charleville to Point Parker in what proved to be an
exceptionally hot and dry summer, and was consequently delayed
beyond expectation. Acting under instructions from the Colonial
Treasurer of Queensland, I rode from Townsville to Cloncurry (558
miles), where I arrived on 20th September, 1881. General Feilding
only arrived on 7th October, so that I had already had an
opportunity of inspecting a portion of the mining district. After
his arrival, while the main body of the expedition toiled on in
the direction of Point Parker, I accompanied him and Ernest
Henry, one of the leading pioneers, on excursions to outlying
mining properties, which, of course, still lay idle from the want
of facilities for transport. My reports were dated between 12th
October, 1881, and 1st March, 1882. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> I parted with General Feilding on 9th
October, 1881, at Gregory Downs and, after spending some further
time in the mineral district, returned to Townsville by a
<i>route</i> south of that by which I had travelled to
Cloncurry.</blockquote>

<p>The "<i>Beagle</i>" left <span class="a">Investigator
Roads</span> on 21<i>st July</i>, and at the same time
Lieutenants Fitzmaurice and Pascoe set out in boats to examine a
portion of the mainland which it was unsafe for the ship to
approach too closely. The officers on the boats reported on 30th
July to Captain Stokes (who by this time had brought the ship to
Flinders Inlet) the occurrence of a cape which was called
<span class="a">Point Tarrant</span> (139&deg; 31' E.; 17&deg;
24' S.), and, 2 miles west of it, a "promising inlet," up which a
boat was taken for about a league to the south-west.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-m">MAP M.</a>) Ten
miles south-east of Point Tarrant was a "large inlet," which was
named the <span class="a">Pascoe Inlet</span> (17&deg; 30' S.).
[It is now known to be the mouth of the <span class="a">Nicholson
River</span>.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] Seven miles
further in the same direction was an "important inlet,"
afterwards named the <span class="a">Albert River</span>.</p>
<p>The "<i>Beagle</i>" herself, which had left Investigator Roads
on 21<i>st July</i>, anchored on the 24<i>th</i> off <span class=
"a">Gore Point</span>, on the mainland, where (in 139&deg; 56'
30" E.; 17&deg; 38' S.) a sand-hill rises to a height of 40 feet.
Between the sand-hill and a quoin-shaped <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> clump of mangroves to the south-east, is
an opening, which was explored in boats by Stokes and Gore for 27
miles by the windings (9 miles direct, to SW.-&frac12;-W.), up to
"plains with open woodlands." It was named <span class=
"a">Disaster Inlet</span>, owing to a gun accident with injured
the hand of Lieutenant Gore, who was shooting at white cockatoos.
A pedestrian excursion for 6 miles S.-&frac12;-E. appears to have
been devoid of interest or incident. There can be little doubt
that Disaster Inlet is a mouth of the <span class="a">Leichhardt
River</span>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) A quoin is the wedge which used to be placed
below the breech of a cannon to give the desired
elevation.]</blockquote>
<p>On 26<i>th July</i>, the "<i>Beagle</i>" went eastward,
approaching the low "head" of the Gulf of Carpentaria as closely
as the soundings permitted (about 13 geographical miles off), to
<span class="a">Middle Point</span> (140&deg; 12' E.), 2 miles
east of which is <span class="a">Morning Inlet</span>.</p>
<p>On 28<i>th July</i>, the ship anchored in about 140&deg; 35'
E.; 17&deg; 35' S., off the mouth of a large inlet, which was
named the <span class="a">Flinders River</span> (which I believe
to be Tasman's <span class="a">Caron Revier</span>), and which
was explored southward in a boat on the 29th and the morning of
the 30th to 17&deg; 51&frac12;' S. Here the river split up into
two branches, one of which came from the east and the other from
the south. The former is now regarded as the "main" channel of
the <span class="a">Flinders River</span>, and, in fact, joins,
or rather "leaves," the "<span class="a">Bynoe" Mouth</span> of
the river; while the latter is known as" <span class=
"a">Armstrong Creek</span>. The reach below (north of) the
conjoined Armstrong and Flinders was named Burial Reach, because
an unburied aboriginal corpse was observed exposed in the fork of
a tree.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the 30th, Captain Stokes, accompanied by
Lieutenant Gore and Messrs. Forsyth and Dring, took a boat back
to the west to the "important inlet" noted by Fitzmaurice and
Pascoe on 21st July. They followed it to the south-west for about
40 miles as the crow flies, and more than 50 by the windings,
until the water had become quite fresh and the country had opened
up into the "<span class="a">Plains of Promise</span>" <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> (1st August). It was named the
<span class="a">Albert</span> River. At Stokes' "furthest south"
(17&deg; 58&frac12;'), he was, in fact, nearing the southern
limit of the coastal plain in which the mouths of the
<span class="a">Nicholson, Gregory</span> and <span class=
"">Leichhardt Rivers</span> anastomose. The party returned to the
ship on 6th August. Stokes indulged in speculations on the
facilities for <span class="a">inland exploration</span> afforded
by the landing at the Albert, opening up into country of the most
inviting character. They were wise words, and if they had come
under the eye of Kennedy I might have averted the disasters which
overtook that unfortunate explorer in 1848.</p>
<blockquote>[1) This country is now all occupied as pastoral
holdings: the part reached by the explorers is now Alice Vale No.
5 block on Bustard Plains run.]</blockquote>
<p>Up the <span class="a">Albert River</span>, about half-way to
Stokes' furthest point, now stands the town of <span class=
"a">Burketown</span>, which serves as the port for a large
pastorally occupied area, as well as for the northern portion of
the continuous mineral district extending from the heads of the
Burke and Wills Creeks (21&deg; 30' S.), through <span class=
"a">Cloncurry copperfields</span> and the <span class="a">Lawn
Hill silver-lead mines</span>.</p>
<p>While Captain Stokes was occupied as above mentioned,
Lieutenant Fitzmaurice had been engaged in examining the coast of
the Gulf between the mouth of the Flinders River and what was
known to him as the Van Diemen Inlet of Tasman. Ten miles from
the Flinders, he found the <span class="a">Bynoe Inlet</span>
(Tasman's <span class="a">Van der Lijn Revier</span>), another
mouth of the same river. Seven miles further, there was another,
which he did not name, in reality Tasman's <span class="a">Van
Diemen Revier</span>, but now known as the <span class="a">Norman
River</span>, on which stands <span class="a">Normanton</span>,
the sea outlet for a large pastoral country and the terminus of
the railway to the <span class="a">Croydon goldfield</span>. From
this inlet, the coast-line begins to trend only a few degrees to
the east of north, and it continues so for 25 miles to the
wrongly named Van Diemen Inlet (16&deg; 58' S.). North of this,
the coast-line trends north-north-east to the 16th parallel.</p>
<p>Thirteen miles south of the supposed Van Diemen Inlet
(Smithburn River, a mouth of the Gilbert), "an opening of some
magnitude" was observed (17&deg; 11' S.), with ponds of fresh
water on its southern side. Two and 4 miles south of it were
smaller openings (marked in the modern chart in 17&deg; 13' and
17&deg; 15&frac12; S.). The "opening of some magnitude" was named
<span class="a">Accident Inlet</span> because "Mr. Fitzgerald had
been seriously wounded in the ankle by the discharge of a gun,
which had gone off within a few yards of it." He was, in fact,
maimed for life.</p>
<p><span class="a">Accident Inlet</span> is the outlet of
<span class="a">Crooked Creek</span>, one of the mouths of the
<span class="a">Gilbert River</span>, and there is every reason
to believe it to be the <span class="a">Staten Revier</span>, the
"<i>Pera's</i>" boat's "furthest south" in the year 1623. Another
opening was noted in 17&deg; 4' S., and this is marked in modern
charts "Southern Mouth of Gilbert R." It is certainly a mouth of
the Gilbert, but Accident Inlet, which is another, is further
south. This so-called "Southern Mouth" is named the <span class=
"a">Smithburn River</span> in the maps of the Lands Department.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-h">MAPS H</a>, <a href=
"#map-f">F</a>, <a href="#map-d">D</a>, <a href="#map-b">B</a>
and <a href="#map-a">A.</a>)</p>
<p>From the Smithburn mouth of the Gilbert River, after the
wounded Lieutenant had been taken on board, the "<i>Beagle</i>"
ran along the western coast of the Cape York Peninsula to
<span class="a">Booby Island</span>. In passing, a cursory
examination was made of the <span class="a">North Wallis
Island</span> (now <span class="a">Red Wallis Island</span>),
which is described as a conical hill of coarse sandstone, 70 feet
in height modern charts say 60. A "grave" was seen, containing
several skeletons covered with turtle-shells.</p>
<p><span class="a">Booby Island</span> was left on 17<i>th
August</i>, 1841. <span class="a">Cape Wessel</span> was passed
on the 18th, and <span class="a">Port Essington</span> was
reached on the 20th. <span class="a">Koepang (Timor</span>) was
visited. Touching at the <span class="a">Swan River</span> and
<span class="a">Adelaide</span>, the "<i>Beagle</i>" returned to
<span class="a">Sydney</span> on 15<i>th March</i>, 1842. After a
visit to Tasmania, she arrived in England on 30th September,
1842.</p>
<p>It is greatly to be regretted that Stokes accepted, without
hesitation or investigation, Flinders' erroneous identifications
of several of the "reviers," or inlets, named by the early Dutch
navigators. In the case of Flinders, as we have already seen, the
errors into which he fell were very pardonable, as he had not
seen Carstenszoon's Journal of the voyage of the "<i>Pera</i>"
(1623) and was only acquainted with the chart of Tasman's voyage
of 1644 through the medium of Thevenot's by no means careful
reduction. Tasman's chart, in fact, only became available through
Jacob Swart's reproduction in 1860. We have to remind ourselves
that Flinders, although permitting himself to make guesses as to
the identity of Carstenszoon's and Tasman's inlets, modestly
omitted the names from his own chart. It would have been well if
Stokes had imitated Flinders' caution, since he, no more than
Flinders, could have seen Swart's version of Tasman's chart, and
he was equally unacquainted with Carstenszoon's "<i>Pera</i>"
journal which was first published by Van Dijk in 1859. The
acceptance by Stokes as <i>facts</i> of what Flinders merely put
forth as <i>conjectures</i> gave official authority for a number
of errors which must for all time disfigure the maps, to the
detriment of historical accuracy.</p>
<p>Taking the various inlets in their order from south to north,
the corrections which should be made, but which have been
rendered impossible by long official and private usage, may be
traced, so as to distinguish between <i>de facto</i> and <i>de
jure</i> names.</p>
<p>1. The <span class="a">Flinders River</span>, first named by
Stokes, may be accepted as a safe starting-point.</p>
<p>2. The <span class="a">Bynoe Inlet</span>, so named by Stokes,
is another mouth of the Flinders, but it had already been named
by Tasman <span class="a">Van der Lijn's Revier</span>.</p>
<p>3. The <span class="a">Norman River</span>, to which Stokes
alluded only as "another inlet," and to which he attached so
little importance that he gave it no name, and which Flinders had
erroneously conjectured to be Tasman's <span class="a">Caron
Revier</span>, is Tasman's <span class="a">Van Diemen
Revier</span>. (The name of Van Diemen Revier is erroneously
applied in modern charts to a mouth of the <span class=
"a">Gilbert River</span> in 16&deg; 58' S.)</p>
<p>4. Stokes' <span class="a">Accident Inlet</span> (a mouth of
the <span class="a">Gilbert River</span>, continued inland as
<span class="a">Crooked Creek</span>) was the "furthest south" of
the "<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Aernem</i>" expedition in 1623 and was
named the <span class="a">Staten Revier</span> by Carstenszoon,
who was on board the "<i>Pera</i>" and in command of the
expedition.</p>
<p>5. The Smithburn River, or <span class="a">Smithburn Mouth of
the Gilbert</span>, was fortunately not named by Stokes, who
merely refers to it as an "opening." (The modern chart, corrected
to 1896, calls it "Southern Mouth of Gilbert River," although
Accident Inlet, another mouth, is still further south.)</p>
<p>For the reason that many of the names of the officers have
been conferred on capes, islands and other geographical features
of Torres Strait, the Gulf of Carpentaria and the neighbourhood
of Cape York, the full list of the <i>personnel</i> of the

<h4>NORMANTON AND THE NORMAN RIVER</h4>
<h5>(SEE <a href="#map-m">MAP M.</a>)</h5>
<p>In consequence of the disastrous issue of the Burke and Wills
expedition, parties set out in different directions, in the year
1861, in search of traces or survivors, and two of these,
Landsborough's and Frederick Walker's, reached the base of the
Cape York Peninsula. Both parties had been carried north by the
200-ton brig "<i>Firefly</i>" (Captain Kirby). Walker's debarked
at Rockhampton and Landsborough's at the Albert River.
<span class="a">Landsborough</span> established a dep&ocirc;t 20
miles up the river and commenced his land travelling on 17th
October, 1861. He ran the <span class="a">Albert</span>
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-n">MAPS N</a> AND
<a href="#map-r">R</a>) up to its head, either by the Gregory or
O'Shanassy branch, crossed the <span class="a">Barkly
Tableland</span> and followed down the Herbert (now <span class=
"a">Georgina) River</span> southward to 20&deg; S., <i>i.e</i>.,
to about the site of <span class="a">Camooweal</span> township,
when the hostility of the natives compelled him to retrace his
steps to his dep&ocirc;t on the Albert River, which he regained
on 7th December, to find that Walker had already been there.
<span class="a">Walker</span> had gone westward from Rockhampton
to the Barcoo River in long. 146&deg; E. and lat. 24&deg; S., and
from this point had shaped his course to the north-west, running
down the river which was afterwards called the <span class=
"a">Norman</span>, and crossing the Flinders to the Albert. He
had left the dep&ocirc;t on his return journey before
Landsborough's arrival. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>

Recent Australian Explorations of McDouall Stuart, Burke and
Wills, Landsborough, etc., by William Westgarth. London,
1863.</blockquote>
<p>By the end of 1869, the northward march of pastoral occupation
had brought it to the southern shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria,
<span class="a">Burketown</span> had been established as a
township on the Albert, and a custom house on <span class=
"a">Sweers Island</span> was supposed to meet the requirements of
the Gulf and Straits. A small steamer named the "<i>Black
Diamond</i>" (Captain Norman) left Sweers Island in February,
1870, and landed 200 tons of cargo at the point where the
<span class="a">Normanton</span> custom house now stands. The new
township and the river itself were named in honour of Captain
Norman. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> Normanton is now the
port for a considerable area of pastoral country, as well as for
the Croydon goldfield, with which it is connected by a railway.
The railway which links Cairns with the Etheridge goldfield will
probably in the future be joined with that from Croydon to
Normanton. The ultimate northern, or Gulf, terminus of the
Townsville-Hughenden-Cloncurry-Mount Cuthbert railway will
probably be at Burketown rather than at Normanton, as not only is
the distance less (Burketown 152, Normanton 184 miles), but the
tendency will be to keep the line as far as possible on the high
and mineralised country extending through Mount Oxide and Lawn
Hills.</p>

<p>I have already pointed out, when dealing with Flinders'
conjectural identifications, that the "small opening in 17&deg;
26' S." (17&deg; 28' S., really), which he thought might be
Tasman's Caron Revier, was much more likely to have been what
Tasman named the Van Diemen Revier, and that this <span class=
"a">Van Diemen Inlet</span> is the mouth of the modern
<span class="a">Norman River</span>.</p>

<p>T<small>HIS</small> admirably planned and equipped expedition
left Toulon on 7th September, 1837, and returned to that port on
6th November, 1840. Its brilliant achievements and scientific
reports <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> form a valuable and
permanent addition to the world's knowledge of south polar as
well as of tropical regions. As usual, however, we confine
ourselves to that portion of the work bearing on the region dealt
with in this book.</p>

<p>The two vessels of the expedition, coming from New Zealand,
sailed westward, to the north of the <span class="a">Portlock
Reefs</span> and <span class="a">Anchor Cay</span>, and dropped
anchor in Treacherous Bay, <span class="a">Darnley Island</span>,
on 31st May, 1840. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-a">MAP A.</a>) A boat was sent ashore, and the <span class=
"a">natives</span> greeted their visitors with waving palm
branches. They endeavoured to entice the sailors to accompany
them inland, using women as decoys. This invitation having been
declined, they displayed a desire for iron articles of all kinds,
but indicated a preference for axes. They had, however, no
eatables to offer in exchange, and would not take the hint when
palm trees bearing fine coco-nuts were pointed out to them. When,
after what the Surgeon called "an agreeable hour" had been spent
ashore, and the visiting party turned back on the sound of the
recall from the flagship, the natives were so friendly as to
<i>carry</i> them to the boat and to repeat the word "to-morrow"
again and again.</p>
<p>In 1886, the Hon. John Douglas described Darnley Island
<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> as the most important in the
Strait, and as having a native population estimated at 300,
besides fifty South Sea Islanders and three or four Europeans.
Further evidences of progress were a police station and a mission
station, with plantations of bananas, coco-nuts, sweet potatoes
and bamboos.</p>

<p>On 1<i>st June</i>, the voyage was resumed, and the vessels
passed <span class="a">Stephens'</span> and <span class=
"a">Dalrymple Islands</span>, and made for the south end of the
<span class="a">Warrior Reef</span>. "On the right," says the
Admiral, "was the Grand Reef, off which is the little
<span class="a">Warrior Island</span>, called <span class=
"a">Toud</span> <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> by the natives.
I wished to anchor behind this little island and establish our
second stage. I kept close to the reef on the starboard side,
confident that it was completely charted. The blacks of Toud
Island ran out on the reefs to watch us." The Surgeon puts it
more elegantly: "We entered a calm channel, bordered with islets
which looked like oases on the surface of the blue sea. There
were shady dwellings beneath clumps of vegetation and coco-nut
groves. The natives ran out on the reefs to see us pass and
invited us to approach. We sailed confidently, being provided
with the carefully constructed charts of the scientific King . .
. But here are two passages, one wide, free and open, and the
other narrow, tortuous and bristling with reefs. The
"<i>Astrolabe</i>" takes this one. There are shoals ahead . . .
"</p>
<blockquote>[1) <span class="u">Tutte</span> in modern
charts.]</blockquote>
<p>Both vessels <span class="a">grounded</span> in the narrow
channel, on which the name of <span class="a">Canal
Mauvais</span> was appropriately bestowed. They were, in fact, on
the wrong side of Warrior Island. The channel on the south side,
which Moresby named <span class="a">Basilisk Pass</span> in 1871,
had already been used by <span class="a">Bligh</span> ("
<i>Providence</i>"and "<i>Assistant</i>") in 1792 and by
<span class="a">Bampton</span> and <span class="a">Alt</span>
("<i>Hormuzeer</i>" and "<i>Chesterfield</i>") in 1793.</p>
<p>The ships, which had, unfortunately, grounded at high water,
were very seriously&mdash;it seemed for a time
hopelessly&mdash;in danger, and there was something maddening in
the thought that the brave ships which had triumphantly come
through the storms of the southern seas were cast away on a
mud-bank in good daylight and fine weather, while the crews would
have to make their way in boats to Timor. But by dint of
superhuman exertions the ships were at last floated, the
"<i>Z&egrave;l&eacute;e</i>" on the 2nd and the
"<i>Astrolabe</i>" on the 4th June. Naturally, they had sustained
considerable damage; and, while the necessary repairs were being
effected, the way out of the passage was carefully surveyed and
sounded.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">natives</span> of the island were
considered to be of New Guinea origin, as by their hair, their
habits, and especially their custom of tattooing, they recalled
the Papuans. They were entirely distinct from the Australian
aborigines, and much more industrious and enterprising. They
possessed about thirty very fine carved canoes or dugouts, and
fishing was their daily avocation. Near the south end of the
island were about a dozen huts. As there was no fresh water, the
natives had a system of collecting it in large clam-shells placed
so as to catch the drip from pandanus trees when showers fell.
Their weapons were of Papuan type, bows and arrows, and spears
barbed with iron, and they had also iron hatchets. Their
vocabulary included a few English words, and the conclusion was
inevitable that they must have enjoyed frequent opportunities of
intercourse with the English. A heap of bones and skulls of the
dugong, observed at the north end of the island, was believed to
be a dep&ocirc;t to be drawn upon, as required, for the
decoration of graves.</p>
<p>On 8<i>th</i> and 9<i>th June</i>, the ships, piloted by the
boats which had been engaged in sounding, cleared the
<span class="a">Canal Mauvais</span>. In the morning of 10<i>th
June</i>, <span class="a">Gueborar (Gabba</span>, or
"<span class="a">The Brothers") Island</span> was passed on the
north, and, says D'Urville, "served as a guide-post towards
<span class="a">Bligh's Exit</span>: then we saw the high summits
of <span class="a">Banks, Mulgrave</span> and <span class=
"a">Jervis Islands</span>." In the afternoon, <span class=
"a">Passage Island</span> (which marks the entrance to Napoleon
Passage) was left behind and the anchor was dropped south of the
<span class="a">Jervis Reef</span>, which stretches east and west
between Jervis and Mulgrave Islands. The next day was spent in
soundings to assure a safe passage through <span class="a">Bligh
Channel</span>. The passage of the channel was made on 12<i>th
June</i>, and a week later <span class="a">Timor</span> was in
sight. <span class="a">Bligh</span> took the "<i>Providence</i>"
and "<i>Assistant</i>" through the channel which bears his name
in 1792, and there is every reason to believe that he had been
anticipated by <span class="a">Torres</span> in 1606.</p>
<p>Jervis Island was named by Bligh in 1792 and surveyed by
Moresby in the "<i>Basilisk</i>" in 1873, but I have been unable
to ascertain who discovered the channel now charted as
"<span class="a">Napoleon Passage</span> (1859)," a few miles
north of Bligh Passage and between Jervis Island and Jervis Reef.
The name suggests a French explorer, while the "<span class=
"a">Hamelin Boulders</span>" in the middle of the passage are
reminiscent of Captain Hamelin, of the "<i>Naturaliste</i>" whom
Flinders met in Sydney in 1802. Captain James H. Watson informs
me that he has seen a reference in the <i>Shipping Gazette</i> to
the passage (apparently by the Prince of Wales Channel) through
Torres Strait of a British ship called the "<i>Napoleon III</i>"
in July, 1856. It is quite possible that the same vessel may have
revisited the Strait three years later and discovered a new
passage, but I have failed to find any record of the
occurrence.</p>

<p>H<small>ER</small> Majesty's Ship "<i>Fly</i>," under command
of <span class="a">Captain F. P. Blackwood</span> (Sailing
Master, F. J. Evans; Mate, D. Aird), was commissioned by the
Admiralty to continue the <span class="a">surveying work</span>
on the coast of Australia which had been commenced by
<span class="a">Flinders</span> and carried on by <span class=
"a">King, Wickham</span> and <span class="a">Stokes</span>. She
was accompanied by the tender "<i>Bramble</i>" <span class=
"a">Lieutenant C. B. Yule</span>, and the pinnace, which was
named the "<i>Midge</i>" did useful service in the minuti&aelig;
of the surveying operations. Blackwood devoted himself heart and
soul to the work, but he was a parsimonious writer. He has left
us a short "Abstract of the Voyage," <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> which is little more than an itinerary,
and incomplete at that. The Admiralty charts, as revised and
corrected by him, and his "Chart of Endeavour Strait," and Notes
in "Sailing Directions," <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> were
apparently his only published contributions to the hydrography of
Torres Strait. Fortunately, there was, among the scientific
staff, a naturalist, J. <span class="a">Beete Jukes</span>, whose
account of the voyage not only took its place at once as a
geological classic, but abounded in that human interest which
gives to a book of travel a permanent value apart from its
geographical and scientific <i>data</i>. It is to this work,
<b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> therefore, that we must turn for
the greater number of the incidents and observations which made
the voyages of the "<i>Fly</i>" memorable. Jukes joined the
Geological Survey of Great Britain on his return from Australia,
and was subsequently appointed Director of the Geological Survey
of Ireland and Professor of Geology in the University of
Dublin.</p>

<br>
<h4>&sect;1. FIRST VOYAGE FROM SYDNEY AND CRUISE IN TORRES
STRAIT, 1843</h4>
<h5>(SEE <a href="#map-k">MAP K.</a>)</h5>
<p>Between 19th May and 1st June, 1843, the "<i>Fly</i>" and
"<i>Bramble</i>" lay in <span class="a">Rockingham Bay</span>,
off <span class="a">Gould Island</span>. The passage between
"<span class="a">Mount Hinchinbrook</span>" and the mainland,
which had been "suspected" by King, was explored by Lieutenant
Shadwell, Mr. Porcher and Jukes.</p>
<p>On the mainland, Blackwood explored "a fresh-water stream of
considerable size," in the north-western portion of Rockingham
Bay, probably the <span class="a">Tully River</span>. Two others,
traced by Lieutenant Ince, Mr. Pym and Jukes, through jungles
till they became streamlets of no importance, were probably
<span class="a">Dallachy</span> and <span class="a">Wreck
Creeks</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">natives</span> of Gould Island commenced
by being very friendly, and soon fell into the habit of paddling
up to the ships for long talks, punctuated by the occasional
receipt of trifling presents. Such confidence did they inspire
that boats' crews would sometimes "neglect" to take their
firearms when they went ashore. On 31st May, one crew netted a
good haul of fish, which they shared with the natives. Greatly to
their surprise, they were assailed shortly afterwards with
<span class="a">spears and stones</span>. Mr. Weekes, the
boatswain, was struck by a stone, which laid him off duty for a
week. One of the men happened to have an uncharged fowling-piece,
and after some search a ball was found on the bottom of the boat,
and with this one of the foremost of the blacks was wounded,
whereupon the attack was abandoned.</p>
<p>On another occasion, Jukes, Ince and Pym, when on a creek on
the north side of Rockingham Bay, were <span class=
"a">stoned</span> by some forty or fifty blacks, and replied with
small shot. One of the blacks was slightly wounded.</p>
<p>On 4<i>th June</i>, Jukes and others landed in <span class=
"a">Endeavour Harbour</span>, but found no trace of the visit of
Captain Cook, nor even of Captain King. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>)</p>
<p>On 5<i>th June</i>, Jukes, with Evans and others, climbed the
hill on <span class="a">Lizard Island</span> to make barometrical
observations. They camped on the summit for the night and took a
series of bearings in the morning. They made the altitude nearly
1,200 feet. While they descended, a party of <span class=
"a">natives</span>, five men and some women and children, were
seen below them. After they joined the ship, the voyage to the
north was resumed.</p>
<p>From 7<i>th</i> to 17<i>th June</i>, the "<i>Fly</i>" was
engaged in surveying the outer edge of the <span class=
"a">Barrier Reef</span> between Lizard Island and Cape
Melville.</p>
<p>On 17<i>th June</i>, Blackwood, Mackay and Jukes landed 2
miles south of <span class="a">Cape Melville</span> and Jukes
observed that the formation was granite. Some <span class=
"a">natives</span> approached, and after mutual laying down of
arms, guided the visitors to water. At sunset, the latter boarded
the boat which was waiting for them. They then discharged their
guns into the sea&mdash;with what object does not appear, unless
they meant to "impress" the natives, who were observing them from
some cliffs about 200 yards distant. It may be conjectured that
the natives took this to mean that, having "shot their bolt," the
visitors were at their mercy. At all events, the stowing away of
the guns in the lockers was the signal for the discharge of two
<span class="a">spears</span>, which fell close to the boat. The
arms were got out again, and Jukes, having loaded one barrel with
ball and the other with shot, fired at trees in the vicinity of
the blacks, alarming the blacks sufficiently to put them to
flight. A confiscated spear was found to be barbed with an iron
nail and two sting-ray spines.</p>
<p>For some time after this incident, the "<i>Fly</i>" was "in
and out" of the <span class="a">Barrier Reef</span> near Cape
Melville. Jukes himself was not on board, and Blackwood is
silent, but the expression "in and out" may be taken to mean that
the inner passage and the landward side of the Barrier Reef, from
the <span class="a">Pipon Islands</span> and <span class=
"a">Melanie Rock</span> south-westward, were surveyed on this
occasion.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Yule was dispatched with the "<i>Bramble</i>" from
Cape Melville, to measure the difference in latitude between that
cape and <span class="a">Cape Direction</span>, and Jukes was a
passenger. Evidently the "<i>Bramble</i>" took the passage inside
the reef, as <span class="a">Night Island</span> is mentioned as
having been seen before <span class="a">Cape Direction</span> was
reached on 24<i>th June</i>. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-c">MAP C.</a>) At daybreak on the 25<i>th</i>, two
<span class="a">natives</span> were observed near the anchorage
fishing from a large outrigger-dugout. Following on a brief
parley, some amicable bartering of spears, etc., for bottles,
biscuits and ribbons took place. After breakfast, two boats were
rowed ashore with a party comprising Lieutenant Yule, Dr.
McLatchie, Messrs. Pollard and Sweatman, Jukes and nine seamen.
The landing-place was probably near <span class="a">Villis
Point</span>, where Bligh had landed in 1789 from the
"<i>Bounty's</i>" launch. A few men were left in the boats, and
the rest of the party ascended <span class="a">Mount
Direction</span>, where they made a series of observations. The
hill was of granite and 490 feet high. The two blacks who had
been fishing reached the hill-top shortly after the whites, and
were presently joined by a third. To keep them in good humour and
prevent them disturbing Yule and the observing party, Jukes and
McLatchie engaged their attention by dancing and "daffing." When
the serious business was finished and the descent had begun, the
blacks shouted and signalled to others below, who replied, and
the whites began to suspect that they were being betrayed into an
ambush. The suspicion was justified when they reached the bottom
of the hill and made for the boats, and a crowd of natives
concealed in the bushes assailed their flank and rear with a
flight of <span class="a">spears</span>. Yule, at this time, was
limping painfully in the rear (being crippled with rheumatism),
and was followed by a sailor named Bayley, who carried the
artificial-horizon box. Jukes happened to look back just in time
to see a tall savage discharge a spear from a wimmera and
transfix <span class="a">Bayley</span>, who <span class=
"a">died</span> of the wound three days later. The <i>post
mortem</i> showed that the spear had passed from behind between
the heads of two ribs and the spine, splintering the bones, and
then penetrated the left lobe of the lungs all but an eighth of
an inch. The spear was barbed with a three-inch bone, wrought to
an acute spindle-shape, and this barb remained in the body when
the spear was withdrawn.</p>
<p>Some random shooting into the scrub followed this act of
treachery, but no good could be done, and it would have been mere
folly to follow the natives into the jungle.</p>
<p>The "<i>Bramble</i>" which had left the "<i>Fly</i>" at Cape
Melville about a week before the end of June, rejoined her in
Wreck Bay (143&deg; 50' E.; 12&deg; 10' S.). (<span class=
"a">Admiralty Chart</span>, No. 2920.)</p>
<p>There is nothing in the narratives of Jukes or Blackwell to
indicate the <i>route</i> taken by either the "<i>Fly</i>" from
Cape Melville or the "<i>Bramble</i>" from Cape Direction. It may
be considered the most probable conjecture that both ships got
outside of the Barrier Reef, the "<i>Fly</i>" by the <span class=
"a">Melville Passage</span>, due north of Cape Melville (4-mile
Sheet 20C), and the "<i>Bramble</i>" by "<span class="a">Bligh's
Boat Entrance</span>" (15&deg; 52' S.), east of Cape Direction.
In Wreck Bay, which is an indentation in the outer edge of the
Barrier Reef, there were seen (between 26<i>th June</i> and
12<i>th July</i>), the <span class="a">wrecks</span> of the
"<i>Ferguson</i>" (1840) and "<i>Martha Ridgway</i>" (1841).
Three vessels were met on their way to pass through Torres
Strait. Two of these, the "<i>Winscales</i>" and the "<i>John
Wrenwick</i>" carried sheep, potatoes and ale, and a bargain was
made for fresh provisions, which were badly needed, <span class=
"a">scurvy</span> having broken out on board; and it may be
added, the fresh food acted like a charm. (<span class="a">See
Sheet B and Admiralty Chart</span>, No. 2920.)</p>
<p>From Wreck Bay, and probably by the line of soundings shown on
the chart extending north-westward from the <span class=
"a">Martha Ridgway Reef</span>, the flotilla made for the
<span class="a">Sir Charles Hardy Islands</span>, which were
visited on 12<i>th July</i>. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-b">MAP B.</a>) Jukes describes them as composed of a brown
siliceous rock, like a flinty slate passing into porphyry, the
northmost island rising to 280 feet (modern charts give 320
feet). Thence the <i>route</i> lay by the <span class="a">Pollard
Channel</span>, south of the <span class="a">Cockburn
Reef</span>.</p>
<p>Jukes and Aird, in the "<i>Midge</i>" arrived at <span class=
"a">Cape Grenville</span> on 18<i>th July</i> and ascended the
eminence which modern charts name <span class="a">Highgate
Hill</span> (249 feet. Jukes gives it as 400). The rock was of
the same character as that of the Sir Charles Hardy Islands, and
the view comprised a "barren sandy country with low, scrub
covered hills." In fact, this was the dreary stretch of scrubby
sand-dunes through which the <span class="a">Macmillan
River</span> finds its way into <span class="a">Margaret
Bay</span>.</p>
<p>Probably the "<i>Fly</i>" and her consorts next rounded
<span class="a">Cockburn Reef</span> and surveyed the eastward
"course recommended" of the charts, by the "<span class="a">North
Channel</span>" to Raine Island. (<span class="a">Admiralty
Chart</span>, No. 2354.)</p>
<p><span class="a">Raine Island</span> was visited on 29<i>th
July</i>, and Blackwood and Jukes spent the night on it. It is
described as an oval rim of coral, enclosing a sandbank which
rises a few feet above the sea. As a breeding-place for birds it
can have few rivals. It was hardly possible to walk or lie down
without stepping on a bird or an egg. "The whole island," says
Jukes, "stank like a foul hen-roost, and we were covered with
bird-lice and ticks. After sleeping in the sand, we dined upon
young boobies and frigate-birds' and terns' eggs."</p>
<p>On 1<i>st August</i>, the ships anchored in <span class=
"a">Pandora Entrance</span> (where the "<i>Pandora</i>" was
wrecked in 1791). On the 3<i>rd</i>, 4<i>th</i> and 5<i>th</i>,
they skirted the outside of the <span class="a">Barrier
Reef</span> to the northward. On the 5<i>th</i>, they entered the
reef by a small opening in 10&deg; 1' S., and reached
<span class="a">Murray Island</span> the same day. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>) The highest point of
the large island was estimated at 700 feet (modern charts make it
750). Many huts were observed and the <span class=
"a">inhabitants</span> were numerous and eager to trade. In fact,
they were so numerous and so hearty in their manners, when
Blackwood landed on the 6<i>th</i>, accompanied by Jukes and
Melville (artist) and exchanged iron for coco-nuts, turtle-shell
and bows and arrows, that he feared his men might be hustled,
with an undesirable collision as the probable result. Jukes
observed that the whole of the lower portion of the island, and
even a good part of the hill slopes, were covered with a
continuous plantation of <span class="a">coco-nuts</span>.</p>
<p>Murray Island was left behind on the 7th, and the survey was
extended to <span class="a">Mount Adolphus Island</span> (11th).
Jukes climbed Mount Adolphus (518 feet) and observed that this
and the whole of the York Islands (meaning, apparently, Mount
Adolphus and the smaller islands in the vicinity) were composed
of porphyry.</p>
<p>On 14<i>th August</i>, 1843, the ships passed north of
<span class="a">Wednesday Island</span> and hove to off
<span class="a">Booby Island</span> for a visit to the
"<span class="a">Post Office</span>." The log-book and a bag of
beef and some biscuits were observed. The "<i>Fly</i>" then
sailed to <span class="a">Port Essington, Timor</span>, the
<span class="a">Swan River</span> and <span class=
"a">Tasmania</span>.</p>
<h4>&sect;2. SECOND VOYAGE FROM SYDNEY AND CRUISE IN TORRES
STRAIT, 1844-5</h4>
<p>The "<i>Fly</i>" left Sydney on 22<i>nd March</i>, 1844,
accompanied by the "<i>Bramble</i>" (Lieutenant Yule) and a small
revenue cutter named the "<i>Prince George</i>" and sailed direct
to <span class="a">Raine Island</span>, where a party under
command of <span class="a">Lieutenant Inge</span> landed on
27<i>th May</i>. (<span class="a">Admiralty Chart</span>, No.
2354.) Their primary business was the erection of a <span class=
"a">beacon</span> on the island to mark what was believed to be a
safe passage through the Barrier Reef for ships coming from the
east. A tank and some necessary timber were obtained from the
wreck of the "<i>Martha Ridgway</i>," but other building material
had to be cut or quarried from various islands or the mainland.
The work was not completed until the middle of September.</p>
<p>As there was no anchorage close to Raine Island, the
"<i>Fly</i>" lay about twelve miles to the south-west, under the
shelter of the "<span class="a">Great Detached Reef</span>",
while the smaller vessels were fetching and carrying for the
party camped on the site of the beacon. The "<i>Fly</i>" herself
had to keep in touch with, and serve as a base for, the party
operating on the island, but she managed, with the assistance of
the "<i>Prince George</i>" to put in a good deal of surveying and
sounding between Raine Island and Endeavour Strait. From 8<i>th
August</i> to 25<i>th September</i>, the "<i>Bramble</i>"
(Lieutenant Yule) was surveying <span class="a">Endeavour
Strait</span>. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>) On 21st September,
the "<i>Fly</i>" left Endeavour Strait for <span class="a">Port
Essington</span> and <span class="a">Sourabaya</span>, Java,
where she arrived on 19<i>th October</i>, 1844, to be joined,
shortly afterwards, by the "<i>Bramble</i>" and "<i>Prince
George</i>".</p>
<blockquote>[1) I gather the impression that Blackwood intended
to apply the name "Endeavour Strait" to the whole of Torres
Strait.]</blockquote>
<p>The "<i>Fly</i>" and "<i>Bramble</i>" returned to <span class=
"a">Torres Strait</span> on 10<i>th February</i>, 1845. At
<span class="a">Booby Island</span>, they left provisions for
possible future shipwrecked people&mdash;fortunately for
themselves, as it turned out. They were engaged up to 19<i>th
April</i> in surveying the central and north-eastern parts of
Torres Strait. During this time they laid down the "track
recommended" from the north-eastern end of the Barrier Reef to
Endeavour Strait. Lieutenant (afterwards Commander) Shadwell, of
the "<i>Fly</i>" made a series of magnetical observations.
<span class="a">Shadwell Point</span>, near Somerset, was named
after him. Yule, in the "<i>Bramble</i>" surveyed the passage
between the mainland and <span class="a">Albany Island</span> and
named it <span class="a">Port Albany</span>. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<blockquote>[2) <i>MacGillivray's Voyage of the
"Rattlesnake,"</i> 1, 132. MacGillivray erroneously gives the
year as 1846 instead of 1845.]</blockquote>
<p>From 28<i>th March</i> to 1<i>st April</i>, the ships lay off
the west side of <span class="a">Darnley</span> or <span class=
"a">Erroob Island</span>, and the officers and men spent a good
part of the time on shore. They sedulously cultivated a good
understanding with the <span class="a">natives</span>, and came
to regard some of them as personal friends. Among these were two
individuals named <span class="a">Mammoos</span> and <span class=
"a">Seewai</span>, who were leaders rather by virtue of their
strength of character than by right of any hereditary or
electoral chieftainship. It was observed by Jukes that
<span class="a">tobacco</span> was cultivated and smoked, and he
puzzled himself over the question of whether the plant and the
custom had been introduced by early Portuguese, Spanish or Dutch
visitors. He saw carved wooden figures, and was of opinion that
they had no religious significance, but represented the filling
up of idle time, or perhaps the instinctive expression of
artistic feeling. The barter of iron articles, chiefly axes and
knives, for coco-nuts and turtle-shell went on briskly. Jukes
made the observation that <span class="a">Darnley</span> and
<span class="a">Murray Islands</span> were of <span class=
"a">volcanic</span> origin, while the islands extending from Cape
<span class="a">York</span> to <span class="a">Mount
Cornwallis</span> were composed of granite or old metamorphic
rocks. Dr. Muirhead and Lieutenant Risk <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> were among the persons who landed on
Darnley Island.</p>
<blockquote>[3) <span class="u">Risk Point</span>, on the
mainland, opposite the Hannibal Islands was probably named after
him.]</blockquote>
<p>On 11<i>th April</i>, the ships anchored off <span class=
"a">Murray Island</span> and the <span class="a">natives</span>
gave Blackwood and Jukes a hospitable and even effusive welcome.
During the whole of their stay (till 15th April), the most
friendly relations were maintained between the islanders and the
ships' companies. Bartering was carried on with zest, the
islanders frequently visiting the ships in their canoes. It was
noted that the shore was lined with a continuous row of huts,
each enclosed in a courtyard of ten to twenty yards square,
fenced with bamboo. The interiors were neat and clean. The
natural products most in request were yams, plantains and
coco-nuts, which seemed to be parted with reluctantly; on the
other hand, the market was, perhaps, overstocked with bows and
arrows. Many of the houses contained <span class=
"a">skulls</span>, on which the tenants did not appear to set
much value. One skull was sold for a fig of tobacco.</p>
<p>Blackwood and Jukes visited the smaller islands of the group,
<span class="a">Dowar</span> and <span class="a">Wyer</span>, in
the "<i>Midge</i>" <span class="a">Darnley Island</span> is
composed of a lava-form hornblendic trap rock, with volcanic
sandstone and conglomerate. <span class="a">Wyer</span> and
<span class="a">Dowar</span> are composed of volcanic sandstone
and conglomerate, dipping at high angles quaquaversally,
<i>i.e</i>., from the centre towards the circumference of the
islands. There is an igneous rock also in the centre of the coral
ring known as <span class="a">Bramble Cay</span>.</p>
<p>On 19<i>th April</i>, Lieutenant Yule left with the
"<i>Bramble</i>" for Sydney, against the prevailing wind of the
season. She was successful, although Jukes remarks that the feat
had only twice been attempted before, first in the
"<i>Zenobia</i>" by Captain Lihou, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> and second by Captain McKenzie in the
"<i>Heroine</i>" (1845). On this southward voyage, the
"<i>Bramble</i>" surveyed the outside of the <span class=
"a">Barrier Reef</span> from Lizard Island to 16&deg; 40' S.
(south of <span class="a">Trinity Opening</span>). (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAPS E</a> AND <a href=
"#map-g">G</a> AND <span class="a">Admiralty Chart</span> No.
2759A.)</p>
<blockquote>[1) After whom is named <span class="u">Port
Lihou</span>, Prince of Wales Island (Admiralty Chart. No.
2354).]</blockquote>
<p>The "<i>Fly</i>" and "<i>Prince George</i>" finally left
Murray Island for New Guinea on 21<i>st April</i>. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>) On the 25<i>th</i>,
they anchored off the <span class="a">Warrior Reef</span>, the
eastern outline of which had already been surveyed by the
"<i>Bramble</i>." Thence they made northward for <span class=
"a">Bristow Island</span> and the adjacent portion of the
<span class="a">New Guinea</span> coast, into which the
<span class="a">Fly River</span> discharges its waters. The
sea-water was found to be barely salt 10 miles out from the
shore.</p>
<p>Blackwood and Ince explored, with the "<i>Fly's</i>" gig
(29<i>th April</i> to 1<i>st May</i>), the <span class="a">Fly
River</span>, which was 5 miles wide at its mouth. They found a
depth of 4 fathoms, and the water quite drinkable. They were not,
however, allowed to go far without opposition. A landing had been
made on the north, or left, bank of the river, when something
like 500 men rushed at them from the woods, and they retreated.
They were no sooner in the boat than a hot pursuit was commenced
by four <span class="a">war canoes</span>, each containing forty
men. At nightfall the party in the gig shook off their pursuers,
and at midnight they reached the "<i>Prince George</i>"and
safety.</p>
<p>The water was too shallow for the "<i>Fly</i>" and "<i>Prince
George</i>"and on 2<i>nd May</i> it was planned to outline the
coast with the "<i>Midge</i>," under Mr. Pym, and the second gig,
under Mr. Harvey. Mr. Millery is also mentioned as being in the
gig as a volunteer. Besides those named, there were twelve
seamen. Dirty weather set in and the boats and ships lost sight
of one another. Captain Blackwood's plans were upset and an
earnest search for the boats took the place of the projected
survey.</p>
<p>On 6<i>th May</i>, the "<i>Fly</i>" anchored at <span class=
"a">Bramble Cay</span>, and on 6<i>th</i> and 7<i>th</i> she
sailed northward towards <span class="a">Aird's Hill</span>.</p>
<p>No trace of the <span class="a">missing boats</span> having
rewarded the search, it was resolved to return to <span class=
"a">Darnley Island</span> and enlist the services of some of the
friendly natives, to "explain" matters to the New Guineans, and
accordingly the anchor was dropped in <span class="a">Treacherous
Bay</span> on 24<i>th May</i>.</p>
<p>The island (which Jukes estimated to contain no more than 100
men of military age) was in a ferment, and something like civil
war was in progress. When, after a time, the position began to
get clearer to Blackwood and Jukes, the trouble appeared to
resolve itself into a trial of strength between Mammoos and
Seewai and their respective partisans&mdash;a sort of tournament,
in fact. The islanders had seen and heard nothing of the missing
boats, and had no time for other people's affairs, and so turned
deaf ears to the proposal that either leader should withdraw
himself from the business in hand. Specifically and emphatically
did they object to visit "<span class="a">Dowdee</span>" (their
name for the nearest portion of New Guinea), whose people they
feared and hated.</p>
<p>In such a condition of affairs, the atmosphere is electric,
and it is not surprising that in a few days the strangers,
hitherto treated as friends, were subjected to an unprovoked
assault. Blackwood and Evans had been ashore taking a meridian
observation, and when they returned to their boat five
<span class="a">arrows</span> were discharged at them, and
muskets had to be fired in return. Happily, there were no
casualties on either side.</p>
<p>At last the contending parties of natives met and "had it out"
with bows and arrows. There were only light wounds on either
side. Apparently somebody's, or everybody's, honour was
satisfied, and the affair was over, obviously to the great relief
of all concerned.</p>
<p>The peace, however, did nothing to overcome the reluctance of
the islanders to go to "Dowdee," and after promises had been made
and broken again and again, the idea of obtaining help from
Darnley Island had to be abandoned.</p>
<p>The "<i>Fly</i>" left Darnley Island on 27<i>th May</i> and
joined the "<i>Prince George</i>" at <span class="a">Bramble
Cay</span>.</p>
<p>On 29<i>th May</i>, Blackwood and Jukes went on board the
"Prince George" and sailed to a point 24 miles north of 8&deg; S.
latitude, and up a large inlet (<span class="a">Aird
River</span>) in 7&deg; 50' S., where they had a sharp encounter
with the New Guinea men, ten or twelve of whom were shot, some,
it was supposed, being killed.</p>
<p>It would be going too far outside the scope of this work to
detail the further adventures of the "<i>Fly</i>" and "<i>Prince
George</i>" in New Guinea. The point that chiefly concerns us is
that nothing was heard or seen of the missing boats.</p>
<p>The "<i>Prince George</i>" was sent, on 2<i>nd June</i>,
direct to <span class="a">Booby Island</span>, where she found,
in the "post office," an account of the adventures of the
boats.</p>
<p>On 3<i>rd June</i>, the "<i>Fly</i>" once more cast anchor in
Treacherous Bay, <span class="a">Darnley Island</span>, and this
time gentle peace was smiling on the land. Nevertheless, the
islanders did not disguise their satisfaction when they heard
that their white friends had been obliged to shoot some of the
detested Dowdeeans.</p>
<p>There were on the island a good many visitors from Tutte
(<span class="a">Warrior</span>) and Damood (Damuth or
<span class="a">Dalrymple) Islands</span>, and these reported
that the <span class="a">missing boats</span> had passed by their
islands peaceably and safely.</p>
<p>On 4<i>th June</i>, the "<i>Fly</i>" left Darnley Island, ran
rapidly round Attagor (Attagoy or <span class="a">Stephen's
Island</span>), and between <span class="a">Damood</span>
(Dalrymple) and <span class="a">Tutte</span> (Warrior Island),
and anchored under <span class="a">Dove Island</span> (10&deg;
S.; 143&deg; 2' E.). On the following day she was in <span class=
"a">Evans Bay, Cape York</span>, where the 6th, 7th and 8th were
employed in watering. The presence of five <span class=
"a">Australian natives</span> gave Jukes an opportunity of
contrasting the physical characteristics of this race with those
of the natives of the islands, who are of Papuan type. Briefly,
his observations may be stated thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="negindent4"><i>Skin</i>.&mdash;Australians, sooty
black. Islanders, reddish or yellowish brown.</p>
<p class="negindent4"><i>Hair</i>.&mdash;Australians, uniformly
fine, and either straight or waved in broad, open curls.
Islanders, tufted on head and body: on the head frizzled when
short, and forming hard pipe-ringlets when long.</p>
<p>Jukes says of the Australians:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Houseless and homeless, without
gardens or any kind of cultivation, destitute of the coco-nut,
the bamboo, the plantain or the yam, as of almost all useful
vegetables, they pass their lives either in the search for food
or in listless indolence. Instead of associating with us on
something like terms of equality, bartering with us, teaching us
their words and learning some of ours, laughing, joking and
engaging in sports, like our Erroobian friends, these Australians
sat listlessly looking on, standing where we told them, fetching
anything or doing anything we ordered them, with great docility
indeed, but with a complete want of interest or curiosity. In our
endeavours to get words from them, they merely repeated our
sounds or imitated our gestures." <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) My own experience corroborates these remarks. In
spite of many more opportunities for learning the Aboriginal
language, or languages, than Jukes enjoyed, I was completely
baffled by the attitude which he so well describes. All attempts
that I made to "exchange words," although my object was quite
well understood to begin with, met with the invariable routine of
amusement as at a game, a tired feeling, brain-fag, sulks and
insubordination.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>In the vegetation of the two regions, there was a line of
demarcation equally clear. On the mainland, gum trees extended to
Cape York and the immediately adjoining islands, with
jungle-foliage only in gullies. On the northern islands of the
strait, there were no gum trees, and the woods were dense and
umbrageous, and often matted into thickets, with coco-nuts,
plantains, bamboos, etc. "It was evident," says Jukes, "that in
crossing Torres Strait we were passing from the Australian centre
of life, so to speak, into that of the Indian Archipelago, or,
more strictly, perhaps, of the Moluccas."</p>
<p>Having replenished the water supply at Evans Bay, the
"<i>Fly</i>" sailed to <span class="a">Booby Island</span>, where
she found the "<i>Prince George</i>" whose men had learned
through the "post office" all about the movements of the
<span class="a">lost boats</span>. It appeared that the boats,
unable to sight the ships or to make Bramble Cay, the length of
their stay being determined by the amount of the provisions
carried, had made for Booby Island, where, fortunately, the
provisions left by the "<i>Fly</i>" in February were still
available. Their men had got water at <span class="a">Port
Lihou</span>, Prince of Wales Island, and then taken on the
"<i>Midge</i>" to <span class="a">Port Essington</span>.</p>
<p>The "<i>Fly</i>" and "<i>Prince George</i>" arrived at
<span class="a">Port Essington</span> on 12<i>th June</i>, 1845.
There they found the crews and passengers of the
"<i>Hyderabad</i>" and "<i>Coringa Packet</i>" which had been
<span class="a">wrecked</span>, the former in the Cumberland
Passage, near Murray Island, and the latter on outside reefs in
17&deg; S. and 150&deg; E. The "<i>Prince George</i>" conveyed
some of the men to Singapore and the "<i>Fly</i>" took the rest
to <span class="a">Sydney</span>, where she arrived on 25<i>th
September</i>, 1845. There, orders were waiting, requiring the
"<i>Fly</i>" to return to England, while the survey was to be
continued by Yule in the "<i>Bramble</i>" with a tender to be
commanded by Master (now Lieutenant) Aird. The
"<i>Castlereagh</i>" was subsequently purchased in Sydney for
this purpose, but was found unsuitable and was resold. The
"<i>Bramble</i>" was paid off in Sydney, but on the arrival of
the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" to replace the "<i>Fly</i>" was
recommissioned to act as her tender and again put under the
command of Lieutenant Yule. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) MacGillivray's Voyage of the "Rattlesnake," 1, p.
43.]</blockquote>
<p>In reviewing the voyage of the "<i>Fly</i>" Jukes strongly
urged the establishment of a <span class="a">Post at Cape
York</span> similar to that at Port Essington. He foreshadowed
the changes soon to be brought about by steam navigation, citing
Captain McKenzie's article in the <i>Nautical Magazine</i> for
February, 1847, in support of his views, and insisted on the
necessity for coaling stations. He predicted for such a
settlement that it would speedily become "another Singapore."</p>

<h3>LEICHHARDT'S OVERLAND EXPEDITION FROM BRISBANE TO PORT
ESSINGTON, 1844-5<br>
<br>
BRISBANE TO THE LYND RIVER</h3>
<p class="negindent2"><small>Leichhardt's Previous History. The
Overland Expedition. Start from Brisbane. Personnel and
Equipment. Mobilise at Jimbour. Itinerary from Jimbour to the
Head of the Lynd.</small></p>
<p>F<small>OR</small> a brief hour, as the southern cross appears
to a watcher in the north, <span class="a">Dr. Ludwig
Leichhardt</span>, the first land explorer to reach the Cape York
Peninsula from the south, rises above our horizon.</p>
<p>Leichhardt was born in Trebatch, L&uuml;bben, Prussia, in
1813. Owing to the accidental omission of his name from the
military rolls, he found himself, on arriving at the age of
manhood, free to indulge the passion for travel which had been
born with him. He reached Sydney in 1842, and as soon as he had
attained sufficient prominence to be noticed, was posted in his
native country as a deserter. At a later date, in recognition of
his services to science, the King of Prussia was graciously
pleased to remove the stigma from his name by granting him a free
pardon. He might prove a useful instrument for peaceful
penetration.</p>
<p>For a little over two years, Leichhardt occupied himself in
<span class="a">botanical and geological travels</span>, in the
course of which he went as far north as Moreton Bay
(Brisbane).</p>
<p>Apart from the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death,
Leichhardt's fame rests on his successful <span class=
"a">traverse of the Australian continent</span> from Moreton Bay
to Port Essington, the early settlement in Coburg Peninsula, in
the north of Arnhem Land, which has since been superseded by Port
Darwin.</p>
<p><span class="a">Leichhardt left Sydney</span> on 13<i>th
August</i>, 1844, accompanied by <span class="a">James Calvert,
John Roper, John Murphy</span> (aged 16), <span class="a">William
Phillips</span> (a "prisoner of the Crown") and "<span class=
"a">Harry Brown</span>", an aboriginal of the Newcastle
tribe.</p>
<p>In Brisbane, there were added to the party, <span class=
"a">Pemberton Hodgson</span>, a botanist; <span class="a">John
Gilbert</span>, who had been collecting for Gould, the
Naturalist; <span class="a">Caleb</span>, an American negro; and
<span class="a">Charley</span>, an aboriginal from Bathurst.</p>
<p>The expedition was mobilised at <span class=
"a">Jimbour</span>, on the Darling Downs, and finally left that
station on 1st October, 1844.</p>
<p>The scientific <span class="a">equipment</span> consisted of a
sextant and mercurial horizon; a chronometer; a compass; and
Arrowsmith's Map of New Holland. The <span class=
"a">transport</span> animals were seventeen horses and sixteen
bullocks.</p>
<p><span class="a">a spring cart</span> formed part of the
initial train, but was evidently not meant to go far: as a matter
of fact, it was abandoned after a few days.</p>
<p>Leichhardt's original idea was to <span class="a">live</span>
almost entirely <span class="a">on game</span>, as far as meat
was concerned. This was, however, soon found to be impracticable,
and as it was necessary to reduce the number of the party,
<span class="a">Hodgson</span> and <span class="a">Caleb
left</span> on 3rd November to return to Jimbour, the main camp
being then on the heads of the <span class="a">Dawson
River</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">itinerary</span> of the expedition from
Darling Downs to the heads of the rivers falling into the Gulf of
Carpentaria need only be briefly summarised, as only the latter
portion of the journey comes within the region forming the
subject of this work.</p>
<p>From <span class="a">Jimbour</span> station, north of
<span class="a">Dalby</span> <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> to
near <span class="a">Miles,</span> <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> the plain on the southern side of the
Bunya Bunya Range was followed. The range was crossed north of
Miles and the heads of the <span class="a">Dawson River</span>
were successively crossed on a course which was at first nearly
west and gradually swung round to the north. The <span class=
"a">Comet River</span> was next run down from its head to its
junction with the <span class="a">Mackenzie</span>. After the
high ground forming the <span class="a">Peak Range</span> had
been traversed, a descent was made into the valley of the Isaacs
River, in the latitude of Broad Sound. The <span class=
"a">Isaacs</span> was then run up to its head, at a gap in the
<span class="a">Denham Range</span>, leading to the head of the
<span class="a">Suttor River</span>; and the Suttor was followed
down to the Burdekin. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-q">MAP Q.</a>) The <span class="a">Burdekin</span> valley
was next followed up, past Sellheim railway station on the
Townsville to Charters Towers line, Dalrymple and the Valley of
Lagoons, and the <span class="a">divide</span> between the waters
of the Pacific and the Gulf of Carpentaria was cleared north of
<span class="a">Mount Lang</span>. (<span class="a">See</span>

<h5>(SEE <a href="#map-k">MAP K</a>)</h5>
<p>A<small>FTER</small> spending some time in an attempt to get
on western waters, Leichhardt succeeded in crossing the
<span class="a">dividing range</span> and dropped down on the
river to which he gave the name of <span class="a">Lynd</span>,
and which he ultimately followed down to the north-west till it
joined the <span class="a">Mitchell River</span>.</p>
<p>Leichhardt's narrative of this portion of his travels shows
some carelessness as regards the direction and the distances
travelled daily. It may be assumed that, as he knew that he was
following a river with a general north-westerly course, he
trusted to the establishment of his position from time to time by
observations for latitude, but as a matter of fact such
observations were not always possible or convenient. The best
that can now be done is to assume the correctness of the
latitudes given and trust to hints in the narrative for the
position of intermediate camps. Arrowsmith's map, however, gives
additional information on many points, and, as it was "laid down
from Leichhardt's original map," such information is of material
assistance.</p>
<p>The gap by which Leichhardt crossed the <span class=
"a">dividing range</span> on 23<i>rd May</i>, 1845, appears to
have been that which now takes the <span class="a">telegraph
line</span> from Junction Creek to Mount Garnet. From this gap he
reached the <span class="a">Lynd</span> in about 6 miles. The
rock passed over was mainly granite. <span class="a">Camp, 23rd
May</span>. Lat. 17&deg; 58' S.</p>
<p>25<i>th May</i>.&mdash;Eight miles down the river WNW. Granite
and pegmatite. <span class="a">Camp 25th May</span>. This camp
was probably about the mark LL 7 of the modern survey.</p>
<p>26<i>th May</i>.&mdash;This day's journey was mainly in
granite country, although basalt was met with towards the end of
the stage. Very rough and mountainous. Probably covered 8 miles
to WSW. down the river. <span class="a">Camp 26th May</span> must
have been about the western boundary-line of Glenfinlas block,
St. Ronan's run.</p>
<p>27<i>th May</i>.&mdash;Low rocky ranges. Course of river
mainly NW. Basalt reappeared on the banks of the river below "a
range of rugged little peaks" (<span class="a">Rob's
Range</span>?) and "extended for some distance, now filling the
flats with its rough and cellular blocks and pebbles and again
forming small hillocks of black bare rock." <span class="a">Camp
27</span><i>th May</i>. The latitude is given as 17&deg; 44' 40",
which is probably a clerical error, and should read 17&deg; 54'
40", and on this assumption the camp would be about the modern
bench mark L, XIX. This day some <span class="a">natives</span>,
men, women and children, were met with. "The men poised their
spears and shook their waddies to frighten us," says Leichhardt,
"but when, notwithstanding their menaces, we approached them,
they left all their goods and, with their weapons only, hurried
up the rocks with wonderful agility."</p>
<p>A halt of three days was made at this camp while a bullock was
killed and the beef dried, the last of the salt having already
been used. A series of <span class="a">lunar observations</span>
enabled Leichhardt to calculate the longitude of the camp as
143&deg; 30'. It may be that by a clerical error "143" has been
substituted for "144," as the error is practically one degree;
but if Leichhardt really meant 143&deg; 30' his longitudes must
be taken with caution. Arrowsmith charts the camp at 144&deg;,
which is impossible.</p>
<p>The expedition moved on down the river on 31<i>st May</i>, the
country being granitic except for small outbreaks of basalt. The
distance travelled is not mentioned, nor the direction, but the
latter must have been NW. and the former about 14 miles.
<span class="a">Camp</span> 31<i>st May</i> was probably on the
site of the "<span class="a">Lyndbrook</span>" station on the
modern <span class="a">Chillagoe-Etheridge Railway</span>.</p>
<p>On 1<i>st June</i>, 8 miles down the river to NW. took the
party to the infall of Fossilbrook. <span class="a">Camp</span>
1<i>st June</i>. Lat. 17&deg; 45' 50" S., at Bench Mark LF.</p>
<p>2<i>nd June</i>.&mdash;Seven and a half miles WNW. down the
river, in porphyry and granite. <span class="a">Camp</span>
2<i>nd June</i>. Opposite mouth of <span class="a">Hackett's
(Fulford) Creek</span>.</p>
<p>3<i>rd June</i>.&mdash;Seven miles NW. down the river, in
porphyry and granite, but had to leave the river in some places
and cross porphyry hills. Saw a family of <span class=
"a">natives</span>, who fled. <span class="a">Camp</span> 3<i>rd
June</i>. Talc schist near the camp.</p>
<p>4<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Travelling so rough that the party was
compelled to leave the river. Regained the river after covering
about 8 miles, gaining about 5 miles to NW. Camp in lat. 17&deg;
34' 17.</p>
<p>5<i>th June</i>.&mdash;The party travelled about 9 miles west,
on the chord of an arc formed by a northward detour of the river.
A range north of the river was named <span class="a">Kirchner
Range</span>. (The 4-mile map names one of its peaks <span class=
"a">Mount Valentine</span>.) The rocks observed during the day's
journey were granite, syenite, permatite and hornblende rock.
<span class="a">Camp</span> 5<i>th June</i>. On bank of river,
near bench mark L 95.</p>
<p>6<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Nine miles west. Porphyry rocks,
"composing hills of an almost conical form." <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 6<i>th June</i>. Lat. 17&deg; 39' 47" S. Opposite
bench mark L 87.</p>
<p>7<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Travelled about 9 miles down the river,
NW. Porphyry for the first 4 miles, and then sandstone rocks
appeared in the distance on the left. As the party progressed,
the sandstone approached the river, until they were forced to
travel in its bed. <span class="a">Camp</span> 7<i>th June</i>.
About a mile short of the mouth of the river which Hann
afterwards named the <span class="a">Tate</span>. Passed a camp
of <span class="a">natives</span>.</p>
<p>8<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Travelled about 9 miles NW. Open
country, although the sandstone ranges approached the river in
many places. <span class="a">Camp</span> 8<i>th June</i>. About 2
miles below bench mark L 71.</p>
<p>9<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Ten miles down the river NNW. Box-tree
flats interrupted by "abrupt barren craggy hills composed of
sandstone, which seemed to rest on layers of argillaceous rock."
<span class="a">Camp</span> 9<i>th June</i>. Near the division
between Torwood and Torwood No. 1 pastoral blocks.</p>
<p>10<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Five miles NNW. down the river, over
similar country. <span class="a">Camp</span> 10<i>th June</i>.
Lat. 17&deg; 9' 7". At bench mark L54.</p>
<p>11<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Travelled 8 miles a few degrees west
of north, the river opening up into fine flats. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 11<i>th June</i>. About 6 miles below bench mark
L 50. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-g">MAP
G.</a>)</p>
<p>12<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Travelled 9 miles NNW. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 12<i>th June</i>. Lat. 16&deg; 55' S.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-h">MAP H.</a>)</p>
<p>13<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Travelled 9 miles NNW. on "a coarse
conglomerate of broken pieces of quartz, either white or coloured
with oxide of iron." Leichhardt remarks of this conglomerate that
"it greatly resembles the rock of Wybong Hills on the Upper
Hunter." <span class="a">Camp</span> 13<i>th June</i>. About 2
miles south of <span class="a">Massie Creek.</span></p>
<p>14<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Travelled 9 miles N. by W. over
extensive box-tree flats. Saw a <span class="a">two-storey native
hut</span> or gunyah. <span class="a">Camp</span> 14<i>th
June</i>. Lat. 16&deg; 38' S.</p>
<p>15<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Travelled 9&frac12; miles N. by W.
down the river, over similar country. <span class="a">Camp</span>
15<i>th June</i>. Lat. 16&deg; 30' S.</p>
<p>This was the <span class="a">Last Camp on the Lynd</span>. It
will be observed that a sandstone, apparently resting on
argillaceous strata, and associated with a conglomerate bearing a
resemblance to certain rocks on the Upper Hunter, was met with
from 7th to 15th June. I have been accustomed to regard this and
similar sandstones, occurring in tablelands in this district, as
belonging to <span class="a">Daintree's Desert Sandstone</span>
formation (Upper Cretaceous), but in view of its proximity to
"<span class="a">Taylor's Carboniferous Range</span>" and the
relation of the latter to <span class="a">Mount Mulligan</span>,
it is at least as likely to prove to be <span class=
"a">Permo-Carboniferous</span>. (See <i>postea</i>, under "Hann's
Expedition.")</p>
<p>Beneath this horizontally-bedded sandstone, or at least a
portion of it, there is reason to believe that the <span class=
"a">Lower Cretaceous</span> sedimentary rocks (which, in this
region, are the principal source of <span class="a">artesian
water</span>) will be found. The probability is that the
fossiliferous strata of the Walsh River and Elizabeth Creek
(<i>vide</i>, Taylor, in Hann's Expedition) are continued
<span class="a">beneath the newer sandstones of the Lower
Lynd</span> till they join the great artesian basin of western
Queensland.</p>
<p>All the way down the Lynd, <span class="a">game</span> was
abundant, and the presence of animals not destined for "the pot"
was noted by the leader of the expedition Among these were scrub
turkey, bower bird, black cockatoo, kite, crow, duck, teal, white
crane, native companion, pike, perch, sawfish (10th June),
kangaroo, wallaby, opossum, bandicoot and dingo.</p>

<h4>(SEE <a href="#map-h">MAP H.</a>)</h4>
<p>I<small>T</small> is easy to follow Leichhardt's footsteps
down the Mitchell with the aid of modern maps. It must not,
however, be forgotten that seventy years ago Leichhardt was
traversing an absolutely uncharted new land, and that his were
the first contributions to the charting which now delineates the
topography of the interior of the Cape York Peninsula.</p>
<p>Before tracing Leichhardt's progress north and west of the
mouth of the Lynd, it is necessary to consider the <span class=
"a">rheography of the Nassau</span>, <i>de jure</i>, <span class=
"a">and Mitchell Rivers</span>, as it is now understood.</p>
<p>Travelling from south to north, the three rivers, the
<span class="a">Nassau</span>, <i>de jure</i> (the <span class=
"a">Staaten</span>, <i>de facto</i>), the <span class=
"a">Lynd</span> and the <span class="a">Mitchell</span>, are
perfectly distinct, but long before they reach the Gulf of
Carpentaria they have entered a coastal plain which is common to
them all, and have lost their identity by linking one with
another in a complex system of anastomosis.</p>
<p>For about 25 miles of its lower course, before joining the
Mitchell, the <span class="a">Lynd</span> begins to leak through
numerous channels into the Staaten, <i>de facto</i>. Then the
<span class="a">Mitchell</span>, nearly as far down as the mouth
of the Palmer, sends similar leakages to the <span class=
"a">Staaten</span>, <i>de facto</i>. Below the Palmer, the
<span class="a">Mitchell</span>, now only a little more than a
degree of longitude from the sea, begins to spread out a
<span class="a">fan of mouths</span>, which, however, do not keep
independent courses but form a bewildering network of
anastomosing channels. It is difficult at all times for a
traveller to be certain which is the "main channel" of such a
river, and it must be that, if not from year to year, at least
from century to century, floods alter the channels in such a
manner that their comparative importance undergoes radical
alterations.</p>
<p>Leichhardt himself did not actually see the <span class=
"a">Junction of the Lynd with the Mitchell</span> when he camped
about 2 miles south of it on 15<i>th June</i>, 1845. Had he
realised, at the time, the importance of the Mitchell, he would
not have been content to take, as he did, his information about
it from his followers. Roper, Brown and Charley described the
river at the junction as having a very broad sandy bed, quite
bare of vegetation, and, meandering through the sand, a small
stream which here and there expanded into large water-holes.</p>
<p>The expedition moved on 16<i>th June</i> WNW. down the
Mitchell for an estimated distance of 9 miles. The <span class=
"a">Camp</span> was on <span class="a">Highbury Lagoon</span>, on
the left bank of the river (long afterwards a Native Police
Reserve).</p>
<p>A delay of two days was made at this camp while a bullock was
killed and the meat cured. The flour had been finished three
weeks before.</p>
<p>On 19<i>th June</i>, a stage of about 8 miles was made to the
NW., down the Mitchell. The <span class="a">Camp</span>, beside a
deep lagoon on the left bank, was in lat. 16&deg; 22' 16" S., and
must have been about bench mark 10 M. Here Leichhardt noticed the
tracks of <span class="a">crocodiles</span>.</p>
<p>20<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Ten miles NW. down the Mitchell, past
some fine <span class="a">lagoons</span>. Camp at bench mark
20M.</p>
<p>21<i>st June</i>.&mdash;Nine miles NW. down the Mitchell, past
more fine lagoons. The <span class="a">Camp</span>, in lat.
16&deg; 9' 41" S., was on "a small creek, scarcely a mile from
the river, from which John Murphy and Brown brought the leaves of
the first <span class="a">palm trees</span> we had seen on the
waters of the Gulf. They belonged to the genus Corypha." This
creek runs into the left bank of the river near bench mark 30M.
<span class="a">natives</span> were observed collecting the seeds
of water-lilies for food.</p>
<p>From the Lynd to the camp of 21st June, Leichhardt's course is
now followed by the road connecting <span class=
"a">Gamboola</span> with <span class="a">Dunbar</span> cattle
station.</p>
<p>22<i>nd June</i>.&mdash;Twelve miles NW. down the Mitchell.
Passed a very long lagoon and noted the superior quality of the
grass now known as <span class="a">Mitchell grass</span>, which
is the most appreciated of all on the "sheep country" of the
western interior of Queensland. The <span class="a">camp</span>,
in lat. 16&deg; 3' 11" S., was on a swamp or sedgy lagoon near
bench mark L.</p>
<p>23<i>rd June</i>.&mdash;Eight or 9 miles NW. down the
Mitchell, passing a great number of dry <span class=
"a">swamps</span>. The <span class="a">camp</span> was in lat.
16&deg; 0' 26", about the bench mark R 100. The river is thus
described: "Its banks were covered with a rather open vine brush.
Palm trees became numerous and grew 40 or 50 feet high, with a
thick trunk swelling in the middle and tapering upwards and
downwards. <i>Sarcocephalus</i>, the clustered fig tree, and the
drooping tea tree were also present as usual. The bed of the
river, an immense sheet of sand, was full a mile and a half
broad, but the stream itself did not exceed 30 yards in width."
In the course of this day's journey, the infall of the
<span class="a">Palmer River</span> was passed, but was not
observed.</p>
<p>24<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Nine miles W. by N., to lat. 15&deg;
59' 30" S., the <span class="a">camp</span> being on <span class=
"a">Plain Creek</span>. This creek leaks out of the left bank of
the Mitchell and falls into Dunbar Creek, which itself leaks out
of the Mitchell. Leichhardt, referring to it, remarks that "a
chain of water-holes, fringed with mangrove myrtle, changed into
a creek which had no connection with the river, but was probably
one of the heads of the Nassau."</p>
<p>This erroneous conjecture has been followed by all subsequent
cartographers, and the creek named <span class="a">Dunbar
Creek</span> where it issues from the river, is designated the
Nassau River further to the west. It <span class="a">should be
named the Dunbar throughout</span>.</p>
<p>The inlet which the Dutch navigators named the <span class=
"a">Nassau Revier</span> is the river which hugs the parallel of
16&deg; 30' S. lat. westward from the meridian of 142&deg; 35' E.
long., and which is erroneously named the Staaten on modern maps.
The true <span class="a">Staten Revier</span> of the Dutch is one
of the mouths of the Gilbert River, probably Accident Inlet.</p>
<p>25<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Travelled 10 miles NW., but did not
follow the river, which made large windings to the north. The
track lay "over a well-grassed forest land and several
<span class="a">creeks, which, although rising near the river,
appeared to have no communication with it</span>." The plains,
says Leichhardt, "rose slightly towards the river, forming a
remarkable watershed, perhaps between the Nassau (<i>i.e</i>.,
<span class="a">Dunbar Creek</span>) and the <span class=
"a">Mitchell</span>."</p>
<p>Leichhardt was, in fact, puzzled by a phenomenon which is well
known to travellers in lands where large rivers deploy upon flat
country. The beds of such rivers tend to silt up, and the
deposits left by periodical floods raise the banks until they
become the highest land of the neighbourhood. The best known
instance is that of "China's Sorrow," the <span class="a">Hoang
Ho</span>, whose channel has to be laboriously cleared out from
time to time as a precaution against the inundation of the
"netherlands."</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Camp</span> of 25<i>th June</i> was in
15&deg; 21' 26" S. lat., on an anabranch now known as
<span class="a">Leichhardt Creek</span>.</p>
<p>Here Leichhardt determined to <span class="a">leave the
Mitchell</span>, which was carrying him too far north, his
intention being to round the southern end of the Gulf.</p>
<p>26<i>th June</i>. Seven miles almost due west, passing a
number of fine long reedy water-holes. The <span class=
"a">Camp</span>, in lat. 15&deg; 52' 38" S., was on <span class=
"a">London Creek</span>, and on the road which now connects
<span class="a">Dunbar</span> and <span class="a">Kalka</span>
stations. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) Assuming the correctness of the modern map,
Leichhardt's positions from 20th to 25th June are all about 4
miles too far south.]</blockquote>
<p>27<i>th June</i>.&mdash;Eight miles WSW. to a <span class=
"a">Camp</span> on a lagoon parallel to a dry creek, "which,"
says Leichhardt, "must belong to the Nassau, as its latitude was
15&deg; 55' 8"." This is the water-course which, as has already
been pointed out, ought to be called <span class="a">Dunbar
Creek</span>.</p>
<p>The smoke of <span class="a">natives' fires</span> was seen on
the plains in every direction, and in all probability the fires
were gathering signals.</p>
<p>After the party had arrived in camp, Leichhardt relates that
"whilst Charley and Brown were in search of game, they observed a
<span class="a">native</span> sneaking up to our bullocks,
evidently with the intention of driving them towards a party of
his black companions, who, with <span class="a">poised
spears</span>, were waiting to receive them. Upon detecting this
man&oelig;uvre, Charley and his companion hurried forward to
prevent their being driven away, when the natives gave the alarm,
and all took to their heels, with the exception of a lame fellow,
who endeavoured to persuade his friends to stand fight. Charley,
however, fired his gun, which had the intended effect of
frightening them, for they deserted their camp, which was 300
yards from ours, in a great hurry, leaving, among other articles,
a small net full of potatoes [yams?] which Charley afterwards
picked up. The gins had previously retired; a proof that mischief
was intended."</p>
<p>28<i>th June</i>. Crossing <span class="a">Dunbar Creek</span>
(which Leichhardt erroneously believed to be the Nassau), the
party travelled 9 miles west, over "a most beautifully varied
country, of plains, of forest land, and chains of lagoons. The
camp was on a chain of shallow lagoons, connected by a
hollow."</p>
<h4>THE DELTA OF THE MITCHELL</h4>
<h5>(SEE <a href="#map-h">MAPS H</a> AND <a href=
"#map-f">F.</a>)</h5>
<p>It is convenient, in this place, to conclude the description
of the Lower Mitchell, as it is now known.</p>
<p>It has already been pointed out how Leichhardt, in 1845,
followed down the river which he had named the Mitchell, while it
was still a distinct watercourse and ran in its own valley, and
how, having entered on the delta, he ran down Dunbar Creek, one
of the mouths of the Mitchell, which (following Flinders) he
erroneously identified with Carstenszoon's Nassau Revier. The
error has since been confirmed by long usage, and <span class=
"a">Dunbar Creek</span>, <i>de jure</i>, has become the
<span class="a">Nassau River</span>, <i>de facto</i>.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Jardine Brothers</span>' traverse of the
delta of the Mitchell in 1864 was further west than Leichhardt's.
Keeping a northerly course, they crossed <span class="a">Dunbar
Creek</span> (the Nassau River, <i>de facto</i>) and were the
first to wander among the anastomosing channels intersecting the
delta. They next crossed the <span class="a">Scrutton
River</span>, which comes out of Magnificent Creek and runs into
the Dunbar, and <span class="a">magnificent creek</span> (named
by them Arbour Creek), which comes out of the Mitchell proper and
runs into the "South Mouth" of the river. Lastly, they followed
the <span class="a">Mitchell</span> proper northwestward to lat.
15&deg; 10' S., where the "North Mitchell" leaks out of the mouth
which is named the "Main Channel."</p>
<p>Most of the mouths of the Mitchell (below the infall of the
Palmer) were surveyed by J. T. Embley in 1886-7.</p>
<p>It was the part of the <span class="a">Church of England
Mission</span> to the Aborigines to make the latest addition to
our knowledge of the delta. I am indebted to the Rev. John Jones,
of the Australian Board of Missions, for a pamphlet entitled
"Mitchell River Aboriginal Mission," printed in Thursday Island,
undated, but evidently issued after 11th July, 1905, as it
contains excerpts from Bishop White's diary of that date. A map
attached to the pamphlet shows that <span class="a">Kilpatrick
Creek</span> has been traced northwestward to its junction with
the "South Mitchell," while another creek, to the west, runs NNW.
and joins Kilpatrick Creek. On this creek, which may be referred
to as <span class="a">Bosworth Creek</span>, is located
<span class="a">"Old" Bosworth (Cattle) Station</span> (lat.
15&deg; 30' S.), as well as the site of a new mission station, to
be named <span class="a">Yeremundo</span>. West of Magnificent
Creek, a chain of fine fresh-water lagoons extends from east to
west, and on the banks of the lagoons are first the
out-mission-station <span class="a">Daphne</span>, and then the
head station <span class="a">Trubanaman</span>. Below the head
station the lagoons merge into a winding salt-water inlet,
opening into the Gulf in lat. 11&deg; 25' S. Two out-stations of
the mission, <span class="a">Koongalara</span> and <span class=
"a">Angeram</span>, are situated on this salt-water inlet, the
former about a mile west of the head station and the latter on
the sea coast. A few miles south of the Trubanaman Creek and
lagoons, <span class="a">Topsy Creek</span> commences in the
east, also as a chain of fresh-water lagoons, and further west
becomes a salt-water inlet, which falls into Trubanaman Creek.
Bishop White, in his diary, expresses the belief that both
Trubanaman and Topsy Creeks leak out of Magnificent Creek, and I
have no doubt that he is right.</p>
<p>The Mission, for which a reserve of about 500 square miles has
been set apart, was initiated in 1902, and evidently exercises a
civilising influence on the natives, but I am unable to assign
the credit due to individual missionaries for their part in the
exploration of this exceptionally interesting geographical
region.</p>

<p>A<small>T</small> Leichhardt's camp on 28th June, 1845, a
terrible disaster overtook his party. (<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-h">MAP H.</a>)</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"After dinner," says Leichhardt,
"Messrs. Roper and Calvert retired to their tent, and Mr.
Gilbert, John Murphy and the aboriginal Brown were platting palm
leaves to make a hat. Gilbert then retired with John to the tent.
This was about seven o'clock, and I stretched myself upon the
ground as usual, at a little distance from the fire, and fell
into a dose, from which I was suddenly roused by a loud noise and
a call for help from Calvert and Roper. <span class=
"u">natives</span> had suddenly <span class="a">attacked</span>
us. They had doubtless watched our movements during the afternoon
and marked the position of the different tents; and as soon as it
was dark sneaked upon us and threw a shower of spears at the
tents of Calvert, Roper and Gilbert, and a few at that of
Phillips, and also one or two towards the fire.<br>
<br>
"Charley and Brown called for caps, which I hastened to find, and
as soon as they were provided they discharged their guns into the
crowd of the natives, who instantly fled, leaving Roper and
Calvert pierced with several spears and severely beaten by their
waddies. Several of these spears were barbed and could not be
extracted without difficulty. I had to force one of them through
the arm of Roper, to break off the barb; and to cut another out
of the groin of Mr. Calvert. John Murphy had succeeded in getting
out of the tent and concealing himself behind a tree, whence he
fired at the natives, and severely wounded one of them before
Brown had discharged his gun."</blockquote>
<p><span class="a">Gilbert</span> was <span class=
"a">killed</span> outright. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> On
coming out of his tent, he handed a gun and ammunition to the
aboriginal Charley, and then dropped dead. "The spear," says
Leichhardt, "had entered the chest between the clavicle and the
neck; but made so small a wound that for some time I was unable
to detect it."</p>
<blockquote>[1) MacGillivray, who was Naturalist on the
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>," wrote in September, 1849:&mdash;I am
convinced that some at least of the collisions which have taken
place in Australia between the first European visitors and the
natives of any given district have originated in causes of
offence brought on by the indiscretion of one or more of the
party and revenged on others who were innocent. As a memorable
instance I may give that which happened during Leichhardt's
overland journey to Port Essington, when his camp was attacked
one evening and Mr. Gilbert lost his life. Long afterwards, the
undoubted cause of this apparently unaccountable attack
transpired, in the acknowledgment, while intoxicated, by one of
the persons concerned, that a gross outrage had been committed
upon an aboriginal woman a day or two previously by the two
blacks belonging to the expedition." (<i>Voyage of the
"Rattlesnake</i>," 1, 313.) MacGillivray, who was a man of sound
and temperate judgment, and who had more than once been
confronted with the aboriginal problem in its most practical
form, must be respectfully heard, and it may be presumed that he
had satisfied himself of the truth of the story, although, as he
tells it, it certainly would not pass for legal evidence in a
court of justice.</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote class="inline">"Mr. <span class="u">Roper</span> had
received two or three spear wounds on the scalp of his head: one
spear had passed through his left arm, another into his cheek
below the jugal bone, and penetrated the orbit, and injured the
optic nerve, and another in his loins, besides a heavy blow on
the shoulder. <span class="u">Mr. Calvert</span> had received
several severe blows from a waddi; one on the nose, which had
crushed the nasal bones; one on the elbow, and another on the
back of his hand; besides which, a barbed spear had entered his
groin, and another into his knee. As may be readily imagined,
both suffered great pain and were scarcely able to
move."</blockquote>
<p>Both the wounded men recovered rapidly. Calvert was able to
resume his duties by 21st July.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">journey was resumed</span> on 1<i>st
July</i>, and <span class="a">salt water</span> was met with on
the 5th, in an inlet from the Gulf of Carpentaria. It is of
interest, before going further, to quote Leichhardt's own
summing-up of his progress to this point. He remarks, with
satisfaction:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"We had now discovered a line of
communication by land between the eastern coast of Australia and
the Gulf of Carpentaria. We had travelled along never-failing
and, for the greater part, running waters; and over an excellent
country, available, almost in its whole extent, for pastoral
purposes."</blockquote>
<p>On 7<i>th July</i>, the party forded a salt-water river, in
16&deg; 30' S. lat., which Leichhardt (erroneously, following
Flinders, who followed Tasman) supposed to be the "<i>Pera's</i>"
<span class="a">Staten Revier</span>, but which, it is now clear,
must have been the "<i>Pera's</i>" <span class="a">Nassau
Revier</span>. It would be impossible to restore the original
name, and long use has indelibly stamped the river as the
<span class="a">Staaten</span>, <i>de facto</i>.</p>
<p>On 9<i>th July</i>, the explorers camped on what Arrowsmith's
map <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> called the <span class=
"a">Van Diemen River</span>. This, according to modern maps, is
the <span class="a">Smithburn Mouth of the Gilbert</span>,
erroneously identified by Flinders as Tasman's Van Diemen River.
On the 12th, 13 miles to the south-west, they crossed a small
river which Leichhardt named the <span class="a">Gilbert</span>.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-m">MAP M.</a>) This
appears to have been <span class="a">Crooked Creek</span> (ending
in <span class="a">Accident Inlet</span>), below the modern
Midlothian Station. It is the southmost mouth of the Gilbert, and
there are the strongest grounds for the belief that it was the
"furthest south" of the "<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Aernem</i>" named
by Carstenszoon the <span class="a">Staten Revier</span>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Australia, from Surveys made by Order of the
British Government combined with those of D'Entrecasteaux,
Baudin, Freicinet, etc., etc.</i>, by John Arrowsmith, 1838.
Evidently the map by which Leichhardt travelled.</blockquote>
<p>On 18th July, Leichhardt camped in 17&deg; 41' 52", probably
east of the modern township of <span class="a">Normanton</span>.
There does not appear to have been anything distinctive enough
about the <span class="a">Norman River</span>, in this region, to
call for a name. It was simply that the party had to go a long
way round to the east and south to avoid mangrove swamps. On the
17th, presumably because he was near the latitude (16&deg; 23')
of the inlet which Flinders had mistaken for Tasman's Caron
Revier, he reckoned he had identified "Caron <span class=
"a">River (Corner Inlet</span>)." Possibly it was <span class=
"a">Brannigan Creek</span>.</p>
<p>It may be said here that I have made painful and conscientious
attempts to follow Leichhardt round the southern end of the Gulf
by the aid of his diary and Arrowsmith's illustrative map, and I
warn those who may essay the task in future that "that way
madness lies." Leichhardt did not give sufficient <i>data</i> for
the identification of his positions on the modern map, whereas
Arrowsmith, with only the coast-line to guide him, must have had
even a harder task than was mine. I have come to the deliberate
conclusion that all charting of this portion of Leichhardt's
journey is worthless. His latitudes <i>must</i> be wrong. Perhaps
his sextant was out of order. He must have been very careless
about distances and bearings.</p>
<p>We find him camped on 6<i>th August</i> in what he calls lat.
17&deg; 57' S., on a river which, he says, "I am inclined to
think is the <span class="a">Albert</span> of Captain Stokes and
the Maetsuyker of the Dutch navigators." Sir (then Mr.) Augustus
Gregory noted (in 1856) the obvious mistake and named the river
the <span class="a">Leichhardt</span>.</p>
<p>On 18<i>th August</i>, Leichhardt struck a large river which
must have been the real <span class="a">Albert</span>, and had to
follow it up 4 or 5 miles to the south-west before he could find
a crossing. A running creek was found falling into its left bank,
and was named <span class="a">Beame's Brook</span>, after Walter
Beames, of Sydney. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-n">MAP N.</a>)</p>
<p>Leaving Beame's Brook on a north-westerly course, a river,
which Leichhardt named the <span class="a">Nicholson</span>,
after Henry Alleyne Nicholson, of Bristol, was crossed within two
miles. Pursuing this, or a slightly more northerly course, the
138th meridian of east longitude was passed. This line now
divides the State of <span class="a">Queensland</span> from the
<span class="a">Northern Territory</span>.</p>
<p>Leichhardt's journey across the southern end of the Gulf of
Carpentaria was marked by few noteworthy incidents. His assiduity
in making botanical and geological observations had full play,
and his success in "shooting for the pot" gave him no reason for
complaint as regards diet, emus, pigeons and cockatoos being
abundant.</p>
<p>It is not within the scope of our subject to follow the
fortunes of the expedition from the <span class="a">Gulf to Port
Essington</span>, which was reached on 17th December, 1845. At
the small settlement, the party were entertained for a month by
the Commandant, Captain Macarthur. The schooner "<i>Heroine</i>"
Captain MacKenzie, conveyed the party, <i>via</i> Torres Strait
and the inner passage, to <span class="a">Sydney</span>, where
they arrived on 29th March, and were accorded an enthusiastic
welcome.</p>
<p><span class="a">Leichhardt's Second Expedition</span> had for
its object the crossing of the continent from <span class=
"a">Brisbane to the "Swan River Settlement</span>" (now Perth).
Having collected funds and made other necessary preparations, he
<span class="a">left Melbourne</span> in September, 1846. The
expedition was, like the first, mobilised at <span class=
"a">Jimbour</span>, which was left on 7th December. The party
comprised <span class="a">Leichhardt, Daniel Bunce</span>
(Botanist and Naturalist), <span class="a">John F. Mann</span>
(Draftsman), <span class="a">Hovenden Hely, James Perry</span>
(Saddler), <span class="a">Henry Boecking</span> (Cook),
<span class="a">Turnbull</span> (Assistant Storekeeper) and
<span class="a">Wommai</span> (or Jimmy) and "<span class=
"a">Harry Brown</span>" (both aboriginals).</p>
<p>The progress of this second expedition is mainly to be
followed in <span class="a">Bunce's "Notes from Travels with Dr.
Leichhardt"</span> and <span class="a">Mann's "Eight Months with
Dr. Leichhardt.</span>" <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Both men
had grievances against their leader, and refused to follow him in
his subsequent campaigns. This circumstance may have coloured
their narratives, but even allowing for such colouring, there
seems to be strong grounds for the belief that Leichhardt's
<span class="a">preparations</span> for a two-years' trip were
<span class="a">inadequate</span> beyond all reason or prudence.
There was hardly any <span class="a">medicine chest</span>, and
as for <span class="a">food</span>, Bunce states:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="inline">"The quantity of <span class=
"u">flour</span> taken was just sufficient to admit of a daily
allowance of 3&frac12; <span class="u">ounces</span> to each man
for a period of 8 <span class="u">months</span>, by which time it
was supposed they would have become sufficiently abstemious in
their habits to enable them to dispense with that staff of life
during the remainder of their journey, which it was expected
would terminate in <span class="a">two years</span> from that
period."</blockquote>
<p>It is not to be wondered at that the expedition was a
fiasco.</p>
<p>By slow marches, interrupted by long periods of camping in
different places, the expedition wound its way to the
<span class="a">north-northwest</span>. The <i>route</i> of the
previous "overland expedition" was followed for the most part,
the chief exception being that the head waters of the
<span class="a">Dawson</span> were crossed a little further to
the east and the <span class="a">Expedition Range</span> was
crossed from east to west into the valley of the <span class=
"a">Comet River</span>.</p>
<p><span class="a">Everything went wrong from the start</span>.
Much time was lost in <span class="a">searching for
horses</span>, mules, cattle, sheep and goats, which continually
strayed. A heavy <span class="a">wet season</span> set in, and
the march along alluvial flats on which mud was drying in the sun
brought <span class="a">malarial fever</span> in its train. By
the end of March, 1847, the whole stock of <span class=
"a">flour</span> had <span class="a">soured</span>. Parties of
the sick had to be left here and there, the main body having to
wait for them to catch up. The individual members of the
expedition grumbled and discussed the advisability of retreat,
and the leader, himself sick, lost his nerve and displayed the
most embarrassing vacillation.</p>
<p>Bunce's statement that the expedition set out on a
two-and-a-half years' trip, with only a starvation allowance of
flour for eight months, if true, shows that the leader was rash
to the point of criminality. On the other hand, if his followers
were aware of the state of affairs from the start (and in
handling the loads daily they must have learned the facts in a
few days at most), their only course, as sensible men, would have
been to refuse to embark on an expedition foredoomed to
failure.</p>
<p>On 22<i>nd June</i>, 1847, <span class="a">Leichhardt turned
back</span> from a point on the eastern side of the <span class=
"a">Peak Range</span> in lat. 22&deg; 50' S. (approx.). This was
the point from which he had originally planned to strike west for
the Swan River, but the hopelessness of the task had become
obvious, and the inevitable had to be accepted.</p>
<p><span class="a">Chauvel's Station</span> on the <span class=
"a">Condamine River</span>, at that time the furthest outpost of
civilisation, was reached on 6<i>th July</i>, 1847, and the party
was broken up.</p>
<p>Here Leichhardt heard of the successful termination of
<span class="a">Sir Thomas Mitchell's Expedition</span>, and on
9th August he set out from <span class="a">Henry Stuart Russell's
Station</span>, on what may be called his <span class="a">Third
Expedition</span>, accompanied by <span class="a">F. N. Isaacs,
James Perry, Daniel Bunce and Wommai</span> (Jimmy), the
aboriginal. No difficulty was experienced in reaching and
identifying Mitchell's <span class="a">Fitzroy Downs</span> and
<span class="a">Grafton Range</span>. The <i>route</i> traversed
by Leichhardt, indeed, offered no natural obstacles (except black
soil in wet seasons) and is now served by the Western Railway.
Leichhardt joined lines with Mitchell at <span class="a">Mount
Abundance</span>, near Roma, where smiling vineyards now gratify
the eye of the tourist.</p>
<p>Leichhardt returned to <span class="a">Jimbour</span> about
14<i>th September</i>, and shortly afterwards went to
<span class="a">Sydney</span>. His journal of this Third
Expedition is given in an Appendix to Bunce's <i>Travels with Dr.
Leichhardt</i>, and is also to be found, as edited by the
<span class="a">Rev. W. B. Clarke</span>, in <i>Waugh's
Australian Almanac</i> for 1860. The latter, it may be pointed
out, is an instance of the extraordinary <i>media</i> chosen by
Clarke for the publication of his writings, which were valuable
at the time, and have now become of historical as well as
scientific importance. It may well be doubted whether any human
being is in possession of Clarke's <i>Omnia Opera</i>, and the
fact that somebody vaguely recollected having somewhere seen
something written by Clarke is, no doubt, responsible for the
luxuriant growth of unverifiable legend which has gathered around
his statements and opinions.</p>
<p>Leichhardt's <span class="a">Fourth</span>, and last,
<span class="a">Expedition</span> set out from "<span class=
"a">Birrell's Station</span> on the <span class=
"a">Condamine</span>" in March, 1848. Its only record is
contained in a short letter, dated 3rd April, from "<span class=
"a">Macpherson's Station</span> on the <span class=
"a">Cogoon</span>," <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> in which he
states that he had travelled to that station, [<i>via</i>]
<span class="a">Mount Abundance</span>, in eleven days. The rest
is silence.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Now better known as Muckadilla Creek. It runs
south-eastward from Muckadilla railway station and falls into the
Balonne River about fifty miles south of Roma.]</blockquote>
<p>The party consisted of <span class="a">Leichhardt, Boecking,
Classen, Hentig, Stuart, Kelly,</span> and two <span class=
"a">black boys</span>. Boecking, who had been cook on the second
expedition, was the only white man who had been with Leichhardt
before. <span class="a">Bunce</span> makes the significant
statement that he and other members of the second expedition had
agreed to join the fourth on certain conditions to which
Leichhardt had agreed at the conclusion of the second expedition,
but which he repudiated on his return from Sydney. We can only
conjecture that the disputed stipulations referred, <i>inter
alia</i>, to food, medicines and remuneration. Bunce's words
regarding the "stipulations" are: "They were such as we humbly
conceived to be of the greatest importance to the success of the
expedition."</p>
<p>From the mass of documents relating to Leichhardt's
preparations, I carry away the impression that he was short of
funds, and that what appeared mean and parsimonious to the men
who were prepared to share his adventures and privations, may
have been forced upon him by pecuniary considerations, added to,
of course, by his desire to <span class="a">travel light</span>,
and <span class="a">trust to luck</span> for game and vegetable
foods. It appears also, according to Bunce, that Leichhardt held
some faddist theory that men could train themselves to dispense
with farinaceous food.</p>
<p>As on his second expedition, <span class="a">Leichhardt's
goal</span> on his fourth and last was the <span class="a">Swan
River Settlement</span> (Perth, Western Australia). He is known
to have entertained theories as to the northward extension of the
supposed "Great Australian Desert," which would naturally lead
him to the north of a direct westerly course. Many conjectures
have been made regarding his <i>route</i>, some even supposing
that he would make for the Gulf of Carpentaria before turning to
the south-west. Several <span class="a">search parties</span>
tried to solve the mystery of his fate; none of them, however,
met with any success, except, perhaps, Mr. (afterwards
<span class="a">Sir) Augustus Gregory's</span>, who, in April,
1858, discovered traces of what may have been <span class="a">one
of Leichhardt's camps</span> on the upper waters of the
<span class="a">Barcoo River</span> between the modern townships
of Tambo and Blackall, and, perhaps, Duncan Macintyre of
Glengower's.</p>
<p>Macintyre, who had made a journey down the Flinders to the
Gulf of Carpentaria towards the end of the year 1864, reported on
his return that he had seen two trees marked L on the western
bank of the Flinders in about 20&deg; S. lat. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-r">MAP R.</a>) It would be natural
to suppose that the marks were Landsborough's, made in 1862, but
the growth of bark over the incised letters appeared to be of
considerably greater age than two years, and besides there were
no numbers, whereas it was Landsborough's custom to mark his
camps with consecutive numbers as well as initials. On these
grounds it was argued that the marked trees indicated camps of
Leichhardt on his last journey. Two old horses picked up by
Macintyre on the Dugald River (which he named) about 100 miles
west of the marked trees, he also supposed to have been
Leichhardt's. The ladies of Melbourne raised a sum of money and
sent Macintyre back to the locality in 1865, but no further
traces of Leichhardt were discovered. On this occasion, Duncan
Macintyre observed a tract of fine land on Julia Creek, where,
later, his brother, Donald, took up Dalgonally Station. (See
<i>Proc. Roy. Geogr. Soc.</i>, Vol. IX, p. 303, quoting letter to
the Editor of the <i>Melbourne Age</i> of 24th December, 1864,
signed by Drs. Ferd. von Mueller and David Wilkie, and <i>The
Empty North</i>, by John Norman Macintyre. Sydney, Penfold,
1920.)</p>
<p>It will never be known whether Leichhardt and his party were
killed by natives, or whether they fell before one of the other
furies of the waste whose dread names are Famine, Thirst, Flood
and Fire.</p>
<p>In the cities of the south, Leichhardt was noted for a
charming and ingratiating manner, and this served him in good
stead while he was soliciting financial aid for his schemes of
exploration. He desired above all things to win the honour of a
British Knighthood, and this ambition was probably never lost
sight of when he cultivated the friendship and support of
influential colonists. The conspicuous success of his "Overland"
expedition, and afterwards the tragedy of his mysterious
disappearance from the face of the earth, stimulated the
enthusiasm of a generous public to a high appreciation of the
amiable and admirable qualities he had displayed.</p>
<p>The success of the "Overland" expedition was due in a great
measure more to the luck of an exceptionally favourable season
than to the perfection of his plans. His other expeditions were
no less ill-planned, and they confronted him with obstacles which
he was incompetent to overcome.</p>
<p>Out in the field with his men, and faced with difficulties
which foresight and resource on his part should have averted or
minimised, he would not have been recognised as the suave and
tactful courtier known to Sydney Society. The coarse bully
lecturing his followers and comparing himself to a general
leading an army had forgotten that he had taken advantage of the
mistake of a registrar to evade the military service which was
the law of his own land. He was callous to the sufferings of the
fever-stricken members of the party, who were unable to keep up
with his pace. He made agreements which he refused to fulfil. He
carried secret stores of dainties on which he luxuriated while
his followers were on the brink of starvation. In the middle of
the nineteenth century he was a living proof that the Prussian
spirit, as the world came to know it in 1914-18, was no new
thing.</p>
<p>It is painful to write such words of a man who did
unquestionable service to Australia, and I am conscious that my
opinions may be supposed to be tinged with the bitterness
engendered by the Great War. As a matter of fact, these opinions
were formed on the whole mass of documentary evidence before the
war broke out, and I am unable to place the easy-going rule of
saying nothing but pleasant things of the dead above the duty
devolving on the historian to write the unvarnished truth. It may
be added that my conclusions had been arrived at before my
reading on the subject had taken me as far as Ernest Favenc's
<i>History of Australian Exploration.</i> <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> After reading that writer's illuminating
remarks, it will be understood that I make no claim to
originality for my estimate of Leichhardt's personal
character.</p>

<p>E<small>DMUND BESLEY COURT KENNEDY</small> had been second in
command of Sir Thomas Mitchell's expedition, which left Buree on
15th December, 1845, and which penetrated to the Darling River,
Balonne, St. George and the Maranoa River. In 1847, he led an
expedition with the object of tracing the course of the Barcoo,
when he followed the river into South Australia till it ran out
into marshes.</p>
<p>In 1848, he was appointed by the Government of New South Wales
to the leadership of an expedition designed <span class="a">to
explore</span> the coast country <span class="a">from Rockingham
Bay</span> (18&deg; S. lat.) <span class="a">to Cape York</span>.
The successes of Mitchell and Leichhardt had roused him to
emulate their exploits and to plan an expedition on a more
ambitious scale than the one which he had already concluded. He
carried a copy of Leichhardt's <i>Overland Expedition</i>, then
fresh from the press. No doubt it was his daily study, and
Leichhardt's methods his model. The influence of the book is very
distinctly traceable in the nature of his preparations and
equipment&mdash;which proved singularly inapplicable to the
country he was to travel over. He and his party left Sydney in
the "<i>Tam O'Shanter</i>" barque, on 29th April, 1848, convoyed
by H.M.S. "<i>Rattlesnake</i>." The "<i>Rattlesnake's</i>"
voyages extended to New Guinea and the Louisiade Archipelago,
although she set out from Sydney with the specific object of
surveying the "Inner Passage," <i>viz</i>., that between the
eastern side of Cape York Peninsula and the Barrier Reef.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Narrative of the Voyage of H.M.S."
Rattlesnake," commanded by the late Captain Owen Stanley, R.N.,
F.R.S., etc., during the Years 1846-50</i>. By John MacGillivray,
F.R.G.S., Naturalist to the Expedition. London, T. and W. Boone,
1852.]</blockquote>
<p>The ship was also to carry Kennedy's party to Rockingham Bay
and assist in their debarkation and start. The two vessels
anchored on 23rd May under the lea of the westmost of the Family
Islands group, and the debarkation was accomplished on the two
following days. The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" carried a distinguished
group of naturalists, among whom was <span class="a">Thomas
Huxley</span>, Assistant Surgeon. Huxley accompanied Kennedy,
before the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" sailed, on an excursion made by
the explorer "for the purpose of searching a way out from the low
swampy district of Rockingham Bay," and contributed a drawing,
reproduced in the <i>Narrative of the Voyage</i>, of a scene
entitled "Cutting through the Scrub." Kennedy is represented
hacking at vines with a tomahawk, and is followed by a man
carrying a gun. Both men lead spirited and gaily-caparisoned
horses. MacGillivray remarks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"I last saw poor Kennedy on the
evening before he broke up his camp: he was then in high spirits
and confident of success. The party, of 13 men and 28 horses
(with carts, a flock of sheep for food, etc.), appeared to be
furnished with every requisite for their intended journey, and
the arrangements and appointments seemed to me to be perfect. Nor
did I, despite the forebodings of others, argue anything but a
successful result to an undertaking, the blame of which was
<i>afterwards</i> attempted to be thrown upon those who had
planned it." <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b></blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[2) With all due respect to MacGillivray's high
attainments in his own line of study, the value of his opinion on
a question of bush equipment may be doubted.]</blockquote>
<p>We learn from the <i>Narrative of the Voyage</i> that
Kennedy's original plan was to explore first to the east of the
dividing range; to meet a vessel <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b>
which was to wait at Cape York with supplies; and then to make
his way southward by the west coast to the southeast corner of
the Gulf of Carpentaria, and make his way back, as might be found
convenient, to the nearest settlement. It was a gigantic
undertaking, and its success obviously depended upon the
endurance of the horses, regarding which bushmen of experience
might well have entertained serious forebodings.</p>
<blockquote>[3) The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" herself, according to
Carron.]</blockquote>
<p>It appears also that H.M.S. "<i>Bramble</i>" was to be in
<span class="a">Princess Charlotte Bay</span> in the beginning of
August, <b style="color:#603000">[4]</b> and Kennedy expected to
obtain <span class="a">supplies</span> from her. He arrived,
however, too late, and abandoned the attempt to reach the coast
on 13th October, in the belief that the "<i>Bramble</i>" must
have left the <i>rendezvous</i>.</p>
<blockquote>[4) Carron's Narrative, quoted in
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>," Vol. II, p. 203.]</blockquote>
<p>Kennedy was provided with a <span class="a">sextant</span> and
must also have carried a <span class="a">chronometer</span>
<b style="color:#603000">[5]</b> as, in the few instances where
the latitude is given and the still fewer instances where the
longitude is recorded, the figures are as accurate as could be
expected in the circumstances. He may have given these readings
to Carron at the request of the latter, or Carron may have
assisted in the observations and noted the results.</p>
<blockquote>[5 )The search party from the "<i>Freak</i>" found
"part of a key belonging to a chronometer" on the site of the
Pascoe camp on 3rd May, 1849.]</blockquote>
<p>The leader kept a <span class="a">diary</span>, which was
<span class="a">lost,</span> or lost all but a few unimportant
scraps. Carron kept a private diary, but that portion of it which
would have been of geographical value, bringing the travels of
the party to his last camp at the mouth of the Pascoe River, was
lost, and it was only from an abstract of it that he
reconstructed his narrative.</p>
<p>Practically, the only record of the ill-fated expedition is
contained in an octavo booklet entitled:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Narrative of an Expedition undertaken
under the Direction of the late Mr. Assistant Surveyor, E. B.
Kennedy, for the Exploration of the Country lying between
Rockingham Bay and Cape York: By <span class="u">William
Carron</span>, one of the Survivors of the
Expedition";</blockquote>
<p>to which are added:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">(1) "The Statement of the Aboriginal
Native <span class="u">Jackey-Jackey</span>, who accompanied Mr.
Kennedy";<br>
<br>
(2) "The Statement of <span class="u">Dr. Vallack</span> and
<span class="u">Captain Dobson</span>, who rescued the Survivors
of the Expedition"; and<br>
<br>
(3) "The Statement of <span class="u">Captain Simpson</span>, of
the '<i>Freak</i>,' who proceeded in search of Mr. Kennedy's
Papers, etc."</blockquote>
<p>The booklet was printed in Sydney in 1849 by Kemp &amp;
Fairfax. It is now almost inaccessible to the public, the only
copy for sale in Sydney being priced at three guineas. It has,
however, been substantially incorporated in the <i>Voyage of the
"Rattlesnake"</i> and an examination of the copy in the Mitchell
Library enables me to point out the omissions from the
reprint.</p>
<p>1. The Statement of Captain Dobson, of the "<i>Ariel</i>" is
omitted entirely.</p>
<p>2. In Captain Simpson's Statement, the portion of the diary
relating to the voyage from the Percy Islands to the Claremont
Islands is omitted.</p>
<p>3. In "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" II, p. 263, after the words "pick
them up," the following passage seems to have been inadvertently
left out:</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"At 2 p.m., the tide commenced ebbing,
the schooner got under way and worked down towards the
'<i>Freak</i>.' At half-past 6 p.m., the tide being down, the
schooner anchored about 1 mile to the northward of us, while I
returned on board."</blockquote>
<p>Besides Carron's Narrative, some facts have been gleaned from
documents in the Parliamentary Library of New South Wales, to
which I obtained access through the courtesy of Mr. Charles
Walsh, Parliamentary Librarian. Chief among these are:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">(a) A notice of the arrival at Sydney,
on 5th March, 1849, of the schooner "<i>Ariel</i>" printed,
together with an interview with the Survivors, in the <i>Sydney
Morning Herald</i> of 6th March, 1849.<br>
<br>

<br>
<p>Having carefully perused all the available material, I
propose, in the pages which follow, to tell the story as it
appears to me, in the light of modern maps. In other words, an
attempt is made to ascertain where Kennedy was from day to day
and to compare my conclusions with the ideas held by Carron or
Jackey-Jackey as to his whereabouts. It must be remembered that
although Kennedy was an expert surveyor, and no doubt had
provided himself with "blanks" constructed from the then existing
Admiralty charts, and plotted his work on these blanks, this
material, there is every reason to believe, has been
irretrievably lost, as has also his journal.</p>
<p>Kennedy's party consisted, besides the <span class=
"a">Leader</span>, of <span class="a">William Carron</span>,
Botanist; <span class="a">Thomas Wall</span>, Naturalist;
<span class="a">C. Niblet</span>, Storekeeper; <span class=
"a">James Luff</span> <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b>
<span class="a">Edward Taylor</span> and <span class="a">William

Thomas Mitchell</span>, <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b>
<span class="a">John Douglas</span> and <span class="a">Denis
Dunn</span>, Labourers; and <span class="a">Jackey-Jackey</span>,
an aboriginal from the Hunter River; thirteen persons in all.
Kennedy seems to have had no misgivings about the unlucky number!
There were also 28 horses, 100 sheep, three kangaroo dogs and one
sheep-dog. One ton of flour, 600 lb. of sugar, 90 lb. of tea, 22
lb. of gunpowder, 130 lb. of shot, a quarter-cask of ammunition,
588 feet of tether rope, 40 hobble chains and straps, boxes and
paper, etc., for preserving specimens, firearms, cloaks,
blankets, tomahawks, horse-shoes, cooking utensils, four tents
and a canvas sheep-fold constituted the chief items of the load,
and there were, besides, 24 pack saddles and harness for nine
draught horses. The greater part of the load was to be carried in
<span class="a">one heavy square cart</span> and <span class=
"a">two spring carts</span>, while each man had a horse to ride
and a spare horse in reserve. Some of the stores, which it was
not expected would be required before the arrival of the
expedition at Cape York, were repacked and sent on board the
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>" on 30th May. After a good deal of rehearsal
and experiment, <span class="a">a start</span> was made on 5<i>th
June</i>, with seven pack-horses and three carts, carrying 21
cwt., drawn by nine horses. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-k">MAP K.</a>)</p>
<blockquote>[1) Luff had been with Kennedy in 1847, when he
traced the course of the Barcoo.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) The Mural Tablet in St. James' Church, Sydney,
has "J. Mitchell."]</blockquote>
<p>The large party, with its equipment, was <span class=
"a">landed at Tam O'Shanter Point</span> on 24<i>th</i> and
25<i>th May</i>, 1848. The tents were pitched in the form of a
square, with the <span class="a">sheep-fold</span> in the centre,
about 200 yards from the beach and near a fresh-water creek. One
<span class="a">horse</span> was <span class="a">drowned</span>
in landing.</p>
<p>A party of <span class="a">natives</span> approached (24<i>th
May</i>) and watched the landing of the sheep with curiosity, and
without displaying hostility.</p>
<p><span class="a">Kennedy</span> and three others rode out to
examine the country in advance of the main party, leaving on
30<i>th May</i> and returning to the camp on 3<i>rd June</i>,
<span class="a">Huxley</span> accompanying him part of the way.
Kennedy came to the conclusion that a get-away to the north or
north-west was impossible because of swamps and dense scrubs. Had
he gone further north, the coast range coming down close to the
sea would have formed an insuperable barrier to his progress. If
he had left the sheep and carts behind and landed at Port Douglas
he might have got away by the now-existing road; but of course he
knew nothing of the country before him. Again, had he landed at
Cardwell, 18 miles south of Tam O'Shanter Point, and made a road
up a comparatively easy spur of the coast range, as George
Elphinstone Dalrymple did in 1864, he might have carried his
expedition to a successful issue.</p>
<p>It was most unfortunate that, before parting with the "<i>Tam
O'Shanter</i>" and "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" Kennedy did not make a
<i>reconnaissance</i> to the south. As it was, he started on
5<i>th June</i>, with an outfit of <span class="a">carts</span>
and <span class="a">sheep</span>, to penetrate a country equally
unsuitable for the carriage of the one and the feeding of the
other.</p>
<p>The caravan had only gone two miles south when it met with a
large tidal river, which was then named the <span class=
"a">Mackay</span> on the Admiralty charts, but which has since
been named the <span class="a">Hull River</span>. A boat lent by
the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" assisted in carrying the stores and some
of the sheep across, while the horses and the remainder of the
sheep swam. The <span class="a">natives</span> assembled in great
numbers to watch the landing, but gave no trouble. Kennedy
himself <span class="a">camped</span>, in the dark, on the south
side (right bank) of the river, whilst Carron and five others
recrossed for fresh water, with which they filled their kegs,
returning to Kennedy's camp at midnight.</p>
<p>On 6<i>th June</i>, <span class="a">Lieutenant Simpson</span>,
of the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>," left to rejoin the ship, and the
exploring party thereafter saw no more white faces. Carron does
not explain how the carts were got across the river, but says
that early in the morning they loaded the carts and pack-horses
and travelled for 3 miles inland, when they met with impassable
swamps and returned to the beach and resumed their southward
course. In 2 miles (say 3) they reached, about dusk, a second
tidal river, larger than the first, the <span class=
"a">Tully</span> (subsequently named after the Commissioner of
Crown Lands, who took part in Dalrymple's expedition in 1864),
and <span class="a">camped</span> on its left, or northern,
bank.</p>
<p>In the morning of 7<i>th June</i>, a <span class=
"a">raft</span> or punt was improvised by covering the body of
one of the carts with a tarpaulin, its buoyancy enhanced by
air-filled kegs and water-bags; and the tether-ropes having been
tied together and made fast on both banks, the punt was pulled
from bank to bank. Most of the things were thus got across during
the day, and the party <span class="a">camped</span>, some on the
right and some on the left bank of the river.</p>
<p>8<i>th June</i>. The remaining baggage was transported across
the river. The horses also were taken across, not without
difficulty. Nothing is said about the sheep, which probably were
ferried in the punt. The party camped on the right bank of the
river, near the beach.</p>
<p>9<i>th June</i>. With the exception of Kennedy, Jackey-Jackey
and three others, the party remained in camp, where they were
visited by a great number of <span class="a">natives</span>, who
evinced no hostility.</p>
<p>10<i>th June</i>. Kennedy and his companions returned to the
camp at night, having found nothing but swamps and no practicable
inland <i>route</i> for the carts.</p>
<p>11<i>th June</i>. After about 4 miles of travelling southward
along the beach, the party came to another river, the
<span class="a">Murray</span>, and <span class="a">camped</span>.
Near the river, they explored an untenanted native camp, noting a
shield, four wooden two-handed swords, fishing lines, fish-hooks
made of shells, cooking ovens of a now well-known type,
consisting of excavations nearly filled with stones, and gourds
for holding water.</p>
<p>12<i>th June</i>. Taylor having failed, owing to the strength
of the ebbing tide, to swim across with a rope, some <span class=
"a">natives</span> who had been observed fishing from canoes were
induced to take the rope across and make it fast on the right
bank, receiving a tomahawk for the service. It was 10 o'clock
before the last of the baggage had been punted across, by
moonlight. The horses were led across a quarter of a mile above
the ferry, the operation being watched with interest by several
natives, who afterwards visited the camp and were presented with
fish-hooks. It may be assumed that the party <span class=
"a">camped</span> at night on the southern, or right, bank of the
river, and that the carts were got across somehow on the
following day, but Carron says nothing about these matters.</p>
<p>13<i>th June</i>. In the morning <span class=
"a">Carpenter</span>, the shepherd, was <span class=
"a">missing</span>, and was ascertained to have taken with him a
damper weighing 11 lb., 10 lb. of sugar and 2 lb. of tea. He was
<span class="a">found</span>, after much searching, next day, in
the act of sharing the damper with a party of <span class=
"a">natives</span>. He expressed contrition, but, according to
Carron, "throughout the expedition he was of very little service,
being, in fact, little better than an idiot." Carpenter died at
the Pascoe camp on 26th November. It is well known that many
Australian shepherds of the old days went mad as a natural
consequence of their lonely life. If Carpenter had really been
recruited from that class, it is more than likely that his mind
was unhinged by the new style of shepherding, with its attendant
difficulties, to which he had been introduced.</p>
<p>Carron mentions that on the 14th an <span class=
"a">alligator</span> rose to the surface of the water close to
the camp and appeared to have his eyes on the sheep. The unhappy
sheep were further disturbed by a pack of dogs belonging to the
natives.</p>
<p>On 15<i>th June</i>, the party progressed 3 miles inland, and
camped on the edge of some fresh-water swamps. On this and the
following day, Kennedy, with a small party, endeavoured, without
success, to find a way through the swamps. The camp was broken up
on 17<i>th June</i>, and a stage of 5 miles was made along the
edge of the swamp, the cart-wheels often sinking to the axles in
the rotten ground.</p>
<p>The next day, Sunday, 18<i>th June</i>, was observed as a day
of rest, the Leader reading prayers at eleven.</p>
<p>19<i>th</i>-22<i>nd June</i>. Kennedy and five others explored
unsuccessfully for a way out of the swamps, and the Leader made
up his mind to return to the beach. There was heavy rain from the
night of the 19th to the night of the 22nd. Two of the horses
left at the main camp were found bogged, and were extricated.
Parties of <span class="a">natives</span>, as many as 80 or 100,
came and surveyed the main camp from a distance.</p>
<p>23<i>rd June</i>. The expedition moved on southward by the
beach, and presently crossed a small tidal river (<span class=
"a">Dallachy Creek?</span>), on a sand-bar near its mouth.
Turning inland for a short distance, they camped on the north, or
left, bank of "a small river" (<span class="a">Wreck
Creek</span>) south of the last. Kennedy and five men spent the
next day (24<i>th June</i>) looking for a way out of the swamps,
but without success.</p>
<p>On 25<i>th June</i>, they accomplished 5 or 6 miles southward,
near the beach, the ground being rotten and sandy.</p>
<p>On 26<i>th June</i>, after a little distance southward along
the beach, another "small river "was met with, which Carron
thought might be the same they had left the day before
(<span class="a">Wreck Creek</span>), but which must have been
<span class="a">Meunga Creek</span>, 2 miles north of the modern
town of <span class="a">Cardwell</span>. In crossing this creek,
the carts sunk into the mud, and had to be unloaded, the goods
being carried ashore. In this operation, a number of <span class=
"a">natives</span>, who had by this time learned to address some
of the party by name, assisted. One or two were detected in petty
acts of theft. The <span class="a">Camp</span> was made on a
grassy rise, after cutting through half a mile of mangroves.</p>
<p>On 27<i>th June</i>, a progress of 5 miles was made inland
(west), the country rising gradually and becoming dryer. Probably
the night's <span class="a">Camp</span> was on <span class=
"a">Meunga Creek</span>, where it turns south. On the 28th, a
road had to be cut for 3 miles west, through a thick scrub, after
which a <span class="a">Camp</span> was made in open forest
country. <span class="a">Luff</span> and <span class=
"a">Douglas</span> were very ill with <span class=
"a">ague</span>.</p>
<p>From 29<i>th June</i> to 1<i>st July</i>, Kennedy and three
others, leaving the main camp, explored 40 miles of country,
having, as they believed, at last found the <span class="a">way
out</span>. A fresh start was to have been made on Monday, 3rd
July, but was delayed by the continued <span class=
"a">illness</span> of <span class="a">Luff</span> and
<span class="a">Douglas</span>. The <span class="a">horses</span>
were <span class="a">getting weak</span> and the <span class=
"a">sheep</span> were <span class="a">falling away</span>, and
for this reason four days more were spent at the camp. On 4<i>th
July</i>, Kennedy and three others, roaming "some distance from
the camp," were <span class="a">attacked by natives</span>. "One
spear was actually thrown, when Mr. Kennedy, fearing for the
safety of his party, ordered his men to <span class=
"a">fire</span> upon them. Four of the natives fell, but Mr.
Kennedy could not ascertain whether more than one was killed, as
the other three were immediately carried off into the scrub."</p>
<p>On 6<i>th July</i> the camp was broken up and the <span class=
"a">westward march</span> was resumed. Early in the day two
creeks were met with, running to the north-east. The second was
crossed with difficulty, the <span class="a">carts</span> having
to be lowered into its bed with ropes and pulleys. The
<span class="a">Camp</span> was made on the north, or left, bank,
in hilly open forest country, with a high range visible to the
west.</p>
<p>On 7<i>th July</i>, small progress was made, owing to fallen
timber which impeded the carts. The evening <span class=
"a">Camp</span> was made on a creek with a large sandy bed. This
was, no doubt, what is now called <span class="a">Kennedy
Creek</span>, one of the heads of Meunga Creek.</p>
<p>8<i>th July</i>. Cutting <span class="a">scrub</span> on north
side of Kennedy Creek. Small progress. <span class=
"a">camped</span> in open forest country with large boulders of
granite.</p>
<p>9<i>th July</i> (Sunday). Rest and prayers.</p>
<p>10<i>th</i> to 13<i>th July</i>. Travelling at an estimated
rate of 3 to 5 miles per day (probably less), cutting
<span class="a">scrub</span> and crossing many small creeks. I am
convinced that they must have taken an ENE. course till they had
rounded <span class="a">Mount Carruchan</span> (2,810 feet), as
they could never have got the <span class="a">carts</span> across
the spur of the range connecting that mountain with <span class=
"a">Mount Alma</span> (3,300 feet). These four days' travelling
probably brought them to <span class="a">Deep Creek</span> or
<span class="a">Dundonald Creek</span>, tributaries of the
<span class="a">Murray River</span>. On the 11th the party was
visited by a small tribe of <span class="a">natives</span>, "who
appeared very friendly and did not stop long."</p>
<p>On 14<i>th July</i>, in crossing country which had the
appearance of being frequently inundated, <span class="a">one of
the carts broke down</span> and had to be left behind. A start
had been made early in the morning, and at dusk <span class=
"a">the other two carts stuck fast</span> at the crossing of a
small creek and some of the horses got bogged. It was only two
hours short of midnight when the loads were carried to a dry
<span class="a">Camp</span>.</p>
<p>This experience finally convinced Kennedy that the
<span class="a">carts</span> were a useless impediment, and he
admitted that they had to be <span class="a">left behind</span>.
While it is impossible to withhold our admiration for the
tenacity of purpose with which he clung to his original plan, it
is to be deplored that he was not convinced of its hopelessness
till forty days of incessant work and worry had taken the heart
out of man and beast. Certainly the horses never recovered from
the strain which had been put upon them at the beginning of the
journey.</p>
<p>The 15<i>th</i> and 17<i>th July</i> were devoted to
rearranging the load for transport on pack-saddles, a crosscut
saw, pickaxes and various other articles being left behind; among
them Carron specially lamented his specimen-box. Sunday the 16th
was given to rest and prayers.</p>
<p>On 18<i>th July</i>, the company set out in the new order,
"rejoicing," says Carron, "to have got rid of one great
impediment to our progress." He adds: "The <span class=
"a">Blacks</span> regarded us with curious interest as we
proceeded on our way, forming a train of twenty-six horses,
followed by the sheep, and Mitchell occasionally sounding a horn
he had brought with him." Little wonder that the blacks were
impressed by this outburst of innocent merriment! But for the
absence of a score or so of banners, it might have been a Chinese
procession. Carron records that the <span class="a">sheep</span>
had by this time grown very thin and poor. "They had, however,
become so habituated to following the horses that they cost us
very little trouble in driving them." Thus is the wind tempered
to the shorn lamb ! On this day, after travelling about 6 miles
(presumably NNW.) through open forest land, the party camped near
a creek on the edge of a thick scrub.</p>
<p>For four days, from the 19th to the 22nd July, the march was
continued over mountainous country, with numerous belts of
<span class="a">scrub</span>, which had to be cut. Considering
the sheep, the scrub, the steep gullies and the inevitable
windings, the rate of progress may be estimated at 3 miles per
day. <span class="a">Sunday</span>, the 23rd was devoted to
<span class="a">rest and prayers</span>.</p>
<p>On 24<i>th July</i>, similar country was passed through, with
occasional patches of open forest, and the <span class=
"a">Camp</span> was pitched by a creek running to the north. One
<span class="a">horse</span>, which had fallen lame, was shot.
This would leave twenty-five. A tribe of friendly <span class=
"a">natives</span> visited the camp. The creek was found to be
one of two branches of a river running to the south-east, the
other running east, possibly <span class="a">Bear Creek</span>
and <span class="a">Davidson Creek</span>, affluents of the
<span class="a">Tully River</span>.</p>
<p>25<i>th July</i>. The party went up the creek (NW.) for 3
miles, having much scrub to cut, and crossed the creek; here
several horses fell among granite boulders. Unable to get out of
the scrub before dark, the party <span class="a">camped</span>
and the horses were tied up for the night. The next day is not
accounted for by Carron. Probably it was spent in hacking through
the scrub for a short distance.</p>
<p>27<i>th July</i>. The greater part of the day was occupied in
cutting scrub and little progress was made. Eventually the creek
was recrossed and a path was cut to the top of a high hill on
which there was grass for the horses. Here the party spent the
night, the horses being tethered lest they should fall down the
steep bank of the creek. A high granite range lay ahead.</p>
<p>28<i>th July</i>. No sooner had the <span class=
"a">horses</span> been untethered than one of them fell down 30
feet and was <span class="a">killed</span> (twenty-four left).
The party cut through the scrub down the hill to the foot of the
range, and camped.</p>
<p>29<i>th July</i>. Kennedy was out exploring the range, which
was densely scrubby. The following day being Sunday was spent in
the usual manner. On Monday, Kennedy took out Jackey-Jackey and
four others, clearing a way up the mountain through the scrub, a
task which occupied them till Wednesday, 2nd August.</p>
<p>On 3<i>rd August</i>, the party climbed a spur of the range by
the cleared track. One horse was unable to do his part and was
tied up to a tree and left behind, the party going on a little
further and <span class="a">camping</span> in the scrub. Next
morning (4<i>th August</i>), the whole of the horses, including
the weak one, and the sheep, were driven back to grass by Carron,
Mitchell and Dunn, who camped beside them. At the main camp,
Niblet and three others remained to watch over the stores, while
Kennedy, Jackey-Jackey and four others formed an advance party
cutting scrub. The main camp was on the creek by which the party
had camped on 24th July.</p>
<p>On 6<i>th August</i>, the party camping with the horses and
sheep were visited by seven or eight <span class=
"a">natives</span>, who ran away on seeing Carron shoot a bird
which had opportunely perched on a neighbouring tree.</p>
<p>Carron left his camp on 7<i>th August</i> with the sheep and
horses, widening and improving the partially cleared track made
by the advance party, whom they overtook on the 9th. At Carron' s
camp on the night of the 8th, great difficulty was experienced in
lighting a fire, everything having been saturated with rain, and
he and his companions were copiously bled by <span class=
"a">leeches</span>. I may say that I have had a similar
experience on the coast range further north, and that the
annoyance is something frightful. Carron left one horse, which
was too weak to travel, at his camp on the morning of the 7th,
thus reducing the number to twenty-three.</p>

<h5>(SEE <a href="#map-k">MAP K.</a>)</h5>
<p>O<small>N</small> 9<i>th August</i>, the united party reached
the <span class="a">summit of the coast range</span>, which
Kennedy estimated to be over 2,000 feet above sea-level, and
<span class="a">camped</span> on the western side of a small
river, which must have been <span class="a">Blunder Creek</span>,
a tributary of the Herbert River, which falls into the south end
of Rockingham Bay. (<span class="a">See 16-mile Map of
Queensland, or, preferably, the 16-mile Inset in Sketch Map of
the Walsh and Tinaroo Mineral Field, 1904: No. 181 Of Geological
Survey Publications</span>.)</p>
<p>Sixty-six days of toil and hardship had brought the explorers
into the <span class="a">Herbert Valley</span>, their actual
start for the north having been preceded by a long and arduous
journey in the opposite direction. Kennedy was, at this furthest
south, 2 miles from the site of Cardwell and within a few miles
of the point where, had he only known, he might have ascended the
range by <span class="a">Dalrymple's Gap</span> and then made his
way with ease up the Herbert valley to the point which he had at
length reached with so much difficulty.</p>
<p>On 10<i>th August</i>, <span class="a">Blunder Creek</span>
was crossed and the party camped on the right bank, lat. 17&deg;
48' S. long.; 145&deg; 20' E. The horses swam across and the
sheep followed them "like dogs." A deep channel between two rocks
was bridged with three trees, over which the men carried the
stores. "<span class="a">Niblet</span>, who had been very
<span class="a">unwell</span> for three or four days, was taken
much worse to-day."</p>
<p>Consideration for the horses kept the party in camp on the
11<i>th</i>. Five miles of uneven open forest country were
covered on the 12<i>th</i>, and the party <span class=
"a">camped</span> by a chain of rocky water-holes, which must
have been near the left, or southern, bank of <span class=
"a">Quamber Creek</span>(?). The 13<i>th</i>, being Sunday, was
given to rest and prayers.</p>
<p>Next day (14<i>th August</i>) it was found that <span class=
"">Niblet</span>, the storekeeper, had been <span class=
"a">appropriating stores</span> for himself and making false
returns. Kennedy thereupon gave the charge of this department to
Carron and a weekly ration was directed to be weighed out for the
future. The <span class="a">flour</span> was found to have been
reduced to 700 <span class="a">lb</span>. Having started with
2,240 lb. on 5th June, about two-thirds had been consumed in 70
days, or at the rate of about 118 lb. per man, which works out at
about 1.7 lb. per man per day. The future <span class=
"a">ration</span> was fixed at 50 lb. per week for the thirteen
men; equal to a little over half a pound per man per day. In
addition, there were to be served out weekly for the thirteen
men: 12 lb. of sugar and 2&frac34; lb. of tea; and, as before, a
sheep was to be killed every second day. Starting with 100 sheep,
35 would be eaten in the 70 days, and allowing 5 more for losses,
there would now be about 60 left.</p>
<p>The journey was resumed on 15<i>th August</i>, scrub having to
be cut nearly all day, and the party camped "by the side of a
fine Casuarina creek coming from the north-east." There can be no
doubt that this was the <span class="a">wild river</span>, the
head of the Herbert. The <span class="a">Camp</span> was probably
about 4 miles above the modern <span class="a">Woodleigh</span>
cattle station and 20 miles below the tin-mining township of
<span class="a">Herberton</span>, which is now connected by
<span class="a">railway</span> with the port of Cairns, in
Trinity Bay. One more <span class="a">horse</span> was
<span class="a">abandoned,</span> leaving twenty-two.</p>
<p>16<i>th August</i>. No reference is made by Carron to the
crossing of the Wild River, and the presumption is that it was
forded without difficulty, as it may be in many places.
(<span class="a">Mulligan</span> must have crossed <span class=
"a">Kennedy's track</span> here on 8th June, 1875.) This day's
stage, to the north-west probably, ended near the head of
<span class="a">Nettle Creek</span>, a tributary of the Wild
River and a prolific source of stream tin in later years. One
<span class="a">horse</span>, too weak to travel further, was
<span class="a">killed</span> (leaving twenty-one) and what flesh
was on him was <span class="a">eaten</span> in two days, and the
<span class="a">saving of one sheep</span> for future consumption
was effected. On the following day (17<i>th</i>), only a short
stage had been made when the party camped out of consideration
for the horses, there being rugged and broken country to the
north-west. This country, although the explorers were not aware
of it&mdash;or at any rate Carron was not&mdash;was the
<span class="a">divide between</span> the rivers falling eastward
into the <span class="a">Pacific</span> and westward into the
<span class="a">Gulf of Carpentaria</span>. The night's
<span class="a">Camp</span> must have been a little north of the
modern tin-mining township of <span class="a">Coolgarra</span>
and not far from the present <span class="a">telegraph
line</span> and road from Coolgarra to Herberton.</p>
<p>On 18<i>th August</i>, the march was continued <span class=
"a">across the divide</span> and 4 miles north-west till a camp
was found "by the side of a fine river, with steep reedy banks
lined with large casuarinas and flooded-gum trees, and abundance
of grass in the valley." The march was difficult, one
<span class="a">horse</span> falling into a gully, to
<span class="a">die</span> next day, thus leaving only twenty.
The position of this <span class="a">camp</span> is given as
17&deg; 30' S. and 145&deg; 12' E., and if this is correct the
camp would be down the valley a little below the <span class=
"a">Glen Linedale</span> tin mines, Glen Linedale being one of
the heads of <span class="a">Emu Creek</span>, which falls into
the Walsh River.</p>
<p>A halt on Saturday, 19<i>th August</i>, was substituted for
the usual Sunday halt, and the journey was resumed on the
20<i>th</i>. The expedition moved on to the north-west during
that and the three following days, camping on the 23<i>rd</i> by
"a creek running to the westward, with rather a broad bed and
steep banks of strong clay." The country traversed during the
four days, in the valley of Emu Creek, was undulating forest
land, with red ant-hills, up to 10 feet in height, on the sandy
flats. About midway between the <span class="a">camps</span> of
the 18<i>th</i> and 23<i>rd</i>, the expedition's track is now
crossed by the <span class="a">Chillagoe Railway</span> east of
<span class="a">Lappa Lappa Junction</span>. The district
traversed between these two points is now thickly studded with
tin, copper and silver mines. The creek on which the <span class=
"a">Camp</span> was pitched on 23<i>rd</i> August was the
<span class="a">Walsh River</span>, about three miles below the
mouth of Eureka Creek.</p>
<p>When the party approached the camp, about a score of
<span class="a">natives</span> made a friendly visit and were
presented with fish-hooks and a tin plate.</p>
<p>The camp having been pitched, Goddard and Jackey-Jackey went
out to shoot wallabies for the pot. They parted at a hill, which
they agreed to round in different directions, and meet.
<span class="a">Goddard</span>, however, got <span class=
"a">lost</span> and did not reach the camp till late next day,
after the party had searched anxiously for him. Only a short
stage to the north-west was made that day (24<i>th August</i>),
owing to the late start. The march was probably continued
northward on the 25<i>th</i> and 26<i>th</i>. Carron does not
give the direction in which the party travelled; but it was
probably north, as they wished to go in that direction, and that
it was possible to do so was proved by Mulligan in 1874 (6th to
9th September). Carron mentions only that three or four of the
party suffered severely from eating figs. It is now known that
these native figs can be made more wholesome by a period of
burial, this method being practised by the blacks. (<span class=
"a">Mulligan's Camp</span> of 8th September, 1874, west of
<span class="a">Wolfram Camp</span>, was probably on <span class=
"a">Kennedy's</span> footsteps of 25th August, 1848.)</p>
<p>27<i>th August</i> (Sunday). Prayers at eleven. Carron refers
to the "poor condition of the horses," saying that the wool from
slaughtered sheep was carefully saved to stuff saddles.</p>
<p>28<i>th August</i>. During this day's (presumably northward)
march, a <span class="a">horse</span>, too weak to travel, was
<span class="a">shot</span>, and the meat saved for consumption.
(This left nineteen.) Only a short distance was covered, and the
<span class="a">camp</span> was pitched on a small creek, which I
assume to be <span class="a">Mount Mulligan Creek</span>,
draining the south-eastern end of Mount Mulligan and falling into
the Hodgkinson River. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-g">MAP G.</a>)</p>
<p>Another weak <span class="a">horse</span> was <span class=
"a">abandoned</span> before a start was made on 29<i>th
August</i>, leaving eighteen. The party <span class=
"a">camped</span> at night on the <span class="a">Hodgkinson
River</span>, which was not running, but had large
water-holes.</p>
<p>On the 30<i>th</i> and 31<i>st August</i> and 1<i>st
September</i>, the party followed the <span class=
"a">Hodgkinson</span> down the valley to the north-west, with
much difficulty, owing to the roughness of the country, the depth
of the gullies and the density of the scrub on the hills. On
2<i>nd September</i>, they left the river at a
bend&mdash;probably about 6 miles short of its junction with the
Mitchell, and in about 5 miles to the north-west <span class=
"a">camped</span> on the <span class="a">Mitchell River</span>
itself. They had been under the impression that the Hodgkinson
would lead them to Princess Charlotte Bay. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) <span class="u">Mulligan's</span> journey of 2nd
and 3rd September, 1874, practically covered the same ground as
<span class="u">Kennedy's</span> of 28th August to 2nd September,
1848.</blockquote>
<p>On Sunday, 3<i>rd September</i>, prayers were read as usual,
and some of the party hunted for food, bagging an emu, a kangaroo
and some fish.</p>
<p>For six days (4<i>th</i> to 9<i>th September</i>), the party
followed the <span class="a">Mitchell</span> to west-north-west,
sometimes in its bed and sometimes over hill-tops, being under
the impression that the river would lead them to Princess
Charlotte Bay. Kennedy's mountain <span class=
"a">barometer</span> was <span class="a">broken</span>, so that
altitudes, for the future, could only be guessed at. The
<span class="a">camp</span> of 9<i>th September</i> was on the
river, probably about the 144th meridian, where it is now crossed
by the <span class="a">telegraph line</span> between the Walsh
and Palmerville stations (<span class="a">Hann's camps</span> 16
and 48, 1873).</p>
<p>There is no evidence in Carron's narrative that Kennedy
identified this river with Leichhardt's Mitchell, and, of course,
Kennedy was many leagues higher up the river than Leichhardt had
been. The mere fact that he expected it to lead him to Princess
Charlotte Bay proves that he considered it a different river.</p>
<p>Kennedy must by this time have been convinced that he had gone
far enough west if he was to strike Princess Charlotte Bay, where
the relief ship was awaiting him. On 5<i>th September</i>, while
they were travelling down the Mitchell, Carron says: "We were now
in the vicinity of <span class="a">Cape Tribulation</span>."
Possibly Kennedy may have told him they were near the
<i>latitude</i> of that cape, but they must then have been at
least 80 miles west of it. The Leader now (10th August)
<span class="a">altered</span> his <span class="a">course</span>
from NW. to N.: in fact, he took the <i>route</i> which
<span class="a">Hann</span> followed in 1872 and <span class=
"a">Mulligan</span> in 1873, and which is now followed by the
<span class="a">telegraph line</span> from the Walsh to the
Palmer.</p>
<p>The 10<i>th September</i> was a Sunday, and although the party
was on the march, there were "prayers as usual at eleven
o'clock." Exactly twelve hours later, three <span class=
"a">spears</span> were thrown into the camp, and were answered by
a few <span class="a">shots</span> fired in the dark, but no
casualties appear to have resulted on either side.</p>
<p>From the 11<i>th</i> to the 14<i>th September</i>, the course
was north, over "rotten," but fairly level, country, partly
liable to inundation and occasionally with small grass-covered
hillocks, among which the failing horses continually stumbled and
fell. A camp was surprised and the <span class="a">natives</span>
having fled in alarm, a half-cooked chestnut cake and some
pandanus fruit were taken away, fish-hooks being left in
compensation. The pandanus did not prove satisfactory because of
its laxative properties and its tendency to produce violent
headache. It might have been better, after all, to have eaten the
fish-hooks and left the pandanus to the natives. On the
15<i>th</i>, the party crossed the <span class="a">Palmer
River</span> and <span class="a">camped</span> on its right, or
northern, bank, opposite the site of the future <span class=
"a">Palmerville</span>. The Hodgkinson, Walsh and Palmer are, of
course, designated by names bestowed long after Kennedy's day. By
what name he distinguished them will never be known.</p>
<p>After the camp had been pitched, a party caught a few fish in
the river. Towards evening, six or eight <span class=
"a">natives</span> threatened the camp, shipping their
<span class="a">spears</span> in throwing-sticks (wimmeras). An
endeavour to convince the intruders that hostility was not
intended was construed into an indication of fear and the advance
was continued, whereupon the white men <span class=
"a">fired</span>. No one was hurt, and the invaders retired, but
only to go and attack the fishing party. Here again they met a
determined defence, and they only fled after they had been fired
on.</p>
<p>The party remained in camp on the following day (16<i>th
September</i>), when they were again <span class=
"a">attacked</span>, this time by 12 or 14 <span class=
"a">natives</span>, armed with spears and boomerangs.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Their bodies were painted," says
Carron, "with a yellowish earth, which, with their warlike
gestures, made them look very ferocious. The grass in the
position they had taken up was very long and very dry, quite up
to the edge of the gully; they set it on fire in three or four
places, and the wind blowing from them to us, it burned very
rapidly. Thinking we should be frightened by this display, they
followed the fire with their spears shipped, making a most
hideous noise, and with the most savage gestures. Knowing the
fire could not reach us, as there was nothing to burn on our side
of the gully, we drew up towards them with our firearms prepared.
They approached near enough to throw three spears into our camp,
one of which went quite through one of our tents. No one was
hurt, but a few of our party fired at them; we could not tell
whether any were wounded, as they disappeared almost immediately.
We kept three on watch this night for fear of the
natives."</blockquote>
<p>It does not appear that Kennedy or any of his party prospected
the Palmer, or had any suspicion of the presence of <span class=
"a">gold</span>, which was to be so amply demonstrated by the
subsequent explorations of <span class="a">Hann</span> and
<span class="a">Mulligan</span>.</p>

<h5>(SEE <a href="#map-g">MAP G.</a>)</h5>
<p>F<small>ROM</small> the 17<i>th</i> to 21<i>st September</i>,
inclusive, the course is given by Carron as north-west; more
probably it was north-west to begin with, and then veered round
to the west until a gap was found in the "<span class=
"a">Conglomerate Range</span>," which bounds the Palmer valley on
the north&mdash;likely enough the same gap which was subsequently
made use of by "<span class="a">Macmillan's Road</span>," and
then the north-western course was resumed, to be changed to a
northern as soon as the nature of the ground permitted. "There
was," says Carron, "occasionally fair travelling over stiff soil
intersected by many creeks, most of them dry, but we were
everywhere able to find water at intervals of a few miles. We
passed over some ironstone ridges and rocky hills covered with
<i>Callitris</i>, <i>Cochlospermum</i> and <i>Sterculia</i>"</p>
<p>After clearing the gap and getting on the "Conglomerate"
tableland, Kennedy was on <span class="a">Pacific waters</span>,
and must have crossed the heads (here no more than rivulets) of
the river to which his name was afterwards given, and which is
popularly believed to have been followed by him northward to
Princess Charlotte Bay. That this idea is erroneous is evident
when we consider that his course was nearly north, while the
Kennedy River presently turns sharply to the north-east. A few
miles to the north would take him out of the catchment area of
the Kennedy. It should therefore be understood that the
<span class="a">Kennedy River</span> was <span class="a">named in
honour of Kennedy</span>, but was not, as is supposed, traced by
him from its head to the ocean. (<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>)</p>
<p>On 22<i>nd September</i>, the explorers "crossed a creek
running eastward" and <span class="a">camped</span>. This was, in
all probability, <span class="a">Wangow Creek</span>. The
<span class="a">camp</span> of 23<i>rd September</i> was on the
same creek, at a point where it ran temporarily south-west. My
first camp on my second Cape York Peninsula expedition must have
been close to this camp of Kennedy's.</p>
<p>Kennedy crossed to the right bank of the creek next morning,
and as the creek was running south-west, he supposed it to be an
affluent of the Palmer (Carron, p. 193). He had not yet grasped
the idea that he was now at last on <span class="a">Princess
Charlotte Bay waters</span>. By this time the heat had become
intense, noonday shade temperatures of 95 to 100 degrees Fahr.
being recorded, and this must have added greatly to the distress
of the surviving horses.</p>
<p>The description of the country traversed (northward) on the
24<i>th</i> and 25<i>th</i> is that which is typical of the
sandstone tablelands in these latitudes.</p>
<p>On the morning of 25<i>th September</i>, three <span class=
"a">horses</span> were <span class="a">missing</span>, and four
men were left behind to search for them, while the rest of the
party moved on. At night, a <span class="a">Camp</span> was made
on a large water-hole. One of the four men came in, stating that
the other three had halted for the night. Carron, by Kennedy's
instructions, went back and led them (and presumably also the
lost horses) to the camp in the dark. The best <span class=
"a">kangaroo dog</span> failed to reach this camp, having been
overpowered by the heat. He crawled into the camp of the 28th, 30
miles on, but <span class="a">died</span> next day.</p>
<p>On 26<i>th September</i>, Kennedy's <span class=
"a">camp</span> was fixed "in a sandy creek where the country
seemed to fall slightly to the north-east." Kennedy was still
under the impression that the waters he was meeting with ran into
the Mitchell, <i>via</i> the Palmer, and "still hoped to find a
river running into Princess Charlotte Bay." As a matter of fact,
he had been on such rivers for several days without being aware
of it; but the valleys on sandstone tablelands are not, as a
rule, separated by "ranges." The "sandy creek" of the
<span class="a">Camp</span> of 26<i>th September</i> was the
"<span class="a">Station Creek</span>" of modern maps, about 5
miles south of <span class="a">Mulligan's</span> <span class=
"a">route</span> (1875), between his 80th and 81st camps, and
which he (Mulligan) named the <span class="a">Warner
River</span>.</p>
<p>In this place it becomes necessary to refer once more to the
comedy of errors arising out of the multiplication of "Kennedy"
Rivers and Creeks. The river which Kennedy is supposed to have
followed down towards Princess Charlotte Bay is placed in
Carron's sketch map on the 144th meridian of east latitude, and
this was, of course, the only river in these parts then known to
geographers. In what is practically the same map, attached to A.
J. Richardson's <i>Overland Expedition from Port Denison to Cape
York under the Command of F. and A. Jardine, Esqrs., in 1865</i>,
this river appears as the "Kennedy River." It was not known, even
at that date, that quite a number of rivers run northward into
Princess Charlotte Bay, their mouths anastomosing when they reach
the coastal plain. From east to west, these now appear on the
maps as the Laura River, Normanby River, Kennedy Creek, Kennedy
River, North Kennedy River and Hann River. The first of the
"Kennedy" group, <i>viz</i>., Kennedy Creek, might advantageously
be renamed. The Kennedy River, long known as such by the
thousands who have come and gone between Cooktown and the Palmer,
and the largest of the group, should retain the name of the
revered explorer who was the first to reach Princess Charlotte
Bay by land. To the whole of the so-called North Kennedy, the
name of Therrimburi Creek, which is borne by its upper reach,
should be applied. It was <span class="a">between Therrimburi
Creek and the Hann River</span> (named by Mulligan) that
<span class="a">Kennedy travelled</span> northward in 1848.</p>
<p>On 27<i>th September</i>, the party travelled over sandy
ridges and marshy flats subject to inundation. The <span class=
"a">Camp</span> was made at a rocky creek containing very little
water, probably the <span class="a">Warner River (Station
Creek</span>), where it takes an easterly course before falling
into the so-called "North Kennedy River" (Therrimburi Creek). The
<span class="a">salt water</span> came up the creek to the camp,
but fresh water was obtained in a lagoon.</p>
<p>For the next two days (28<i>th</i> and 29<i>th September</i>),
a halt was necessitated by the <span class="a">straying</span> of
the <span class="a">sheep</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">sheep</span> are only once again referred
to in Carron's narrative, <i>viz</i>., on 11th November, when the
last was killed at the Pascoe camp, and it may be surmised that
the majority were finally <span class="a">lost</span> here, as
the party evidently subsisted for the rest of the way to the
Pascoe mainly on horseflesh, a little flour and what game they
could shoot. When we last took stock of the sheep, on 14th
August, 60 were left of the original 100. Since that date,
reckoning the consumption at one in two days, and balancing
losses while travelling by economies made possible by the capture
of game, there should have been 38 left on 27th September.</p>
<p>Two <span class="a">natives</span> were seen, carrying spears,
on 28th September.</p>
<p>On 30<i>th September</i>, the expedition moved on for 5 or 6
miles to the west, across a plain, when, finding a dry lagoon
where a supply of water was expected, they <span class=
"a">returned</span> to the camp on <span class="a">Station
Creek</span>. Nothing is said of the <span class=
"a">sheep</span>, but the poor animals must have been about
equally unfortunate whether they had to be left where there was
no water or were driven 10 or 12 miles back in the summer
heat.</p>
<p>The 1<i>st of October</i>, being Sunday, was spent in rest and
prayer. Next day (2<i>nd October</i>), the party again crossed
the plain westward, the <span class="a">natives</span>
<span class="a">burning the grass</span> behind them, so that
they were glad to hurry on to a patch which had already been
burned. They must have reached water, probably in the
<span class="a">Hann River</span>, about the place where I
crossed it on 4th September, 1879. One horse, too weak to travel,
was bled, and his blood was mixed with flour and made into a
pudding. The <span class="a">horse died</span> next day, and his
flesh was prepared for food. This left seventeen horses alive.
The <span class="a">strength of the men was declining</span>, and
it is sad to record that their morals also had been sapped by
privation and toil, so that, to guard against selfish peculation,
it became necessary to watch the horseflesh when it was drying in
the sun.</p>
<p>When the march to the north-west was resumed on 4th October,
<span class="a">Jane's Tableland</span> <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> was in sight. It appears in Arrowsmith's
map, issued in 1838. I saw this tableland on 4th September, 1879.
It is impossible, from Carron's journal, to account
satisfactorily for the whole of the 4th, 5th and 6th October
(1848), but on the afternoon of the 6th the <span class=
"a">Camp</span> was pitched near "a salt-water creek," which is
probably that now shown on the maps as "<span class="a">Saltwater
Creek</span>," and which was known as such to the diggers who
rushed the "Coen" in 1878. My track from the Hann River to
Saltwater Creek, on 4th September, 1879, probably coincided with
Kennedy's.</p>
<blockquote>[1) This conspicuous table was probably named by
King, in the "<i>Bathurst</i>," in 1821.]</blockquote>
<p>Near the explorers' camp of 6th October, a <span class=
"a">native camp</span> was inspected in the absence of its
owners. There were seven or eight conical huts built of saplings
and lined inside with woven strips of bamboo and covered outside
with palm leaves. It was obviously a camp designed to keep out
rain in the wet season. In the huts were stone ovens,
fishing-nets and pieces of <span class=
"a">bottleglass</span>.</p>
<p>On 7<i>th</i>, 8<i>th</i> and 9<i>th October</i>, the march
was continued NNW. to "a river running into Princess Charlotte
Bay, in lat. 14&deg; 30' S. and long. 143&deg; 56'," which must
have been the <span class="a">Annie River</span>, if the latitude
is correct. The longitude given is evidently about 10 minutes too
far east, as the river was crossed 12 or 14 miles from the sea,
where the water was only brackish.</p>
<p>During the midday halt on 10<i>th October</i>, the party were
visited by a large number of <span class="a">natives</span>,
including women, who had been collecting the fruit of the nondah.
When the march was resumed, says Carron, "the natives followed us
at some distance, continually <span class="a">throwing
spears</span> after us for some time: one was thrown into the
thigh of a horse, but, fortunately, not being barbed, was taken
out, and the horse was not much injured. We then rode after them
in two or three directions, and <span class="a">fired</span> at
them, when they left us, and we saw no more of them."</p>
<p>On the 11<i>th</i>, when halting in a place where there was no
water, the travellers were visited by <span class=
"a">natives</span>, who, in exchange for fish-hooks, brought
water in bark vessels, and left quietly.</p>
<p>I am unable to place Kennedy's camps between the 9th and 20th
of October, but it is evident that he must have travelled
north-north-west and kept as close to the west coast of
<span class="a">Princess Charlotte Bay</span> as the mangroves
and salt-water creeks and swamps permitted. In all probability,
from the <span class="a">Annie</span> to the <span class=
"a">Stewart River</span>, his <i>route</i> was near perhaps a
little west of that followed by William Hann on his "home" trip,
5th to 8th September, 1872, between his camps Nos. 32 and 35.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP C.</a>)</p>
<p>On 13<i>th October</i>, a last unsuccessful attempt was made
to penetrate the mangroves to the beach. It may be surmised that
this was somewhere near the latitude of the Rattlesnake Reefs.
H.M.S. "<i>Bramble</i>" was to have been in Princess Charlotte
Bay in the beginning of August, and Kennedy was satisfied that
the ship must have come and gone, and that relief was no longer
to be expected.</p>
<p>On the 15<i>th</i> (Sunday), there were "prayers as usual at
11 o'clock," and the sugar was finished. Next day (16<i>th</i>) a
horse which fell into a rocky water-hole was killed and his flesh
was dried in the sun. This left sixteen horses, for the most part
too exhausted to carry loads, and the horses were now driven on
chiefly for food. One tent and other useless articles of baggage
were left behind.</p>
<p>In the four days, 16<i>th</i> to 20<i>th October</i>, the
march continued across the creeks which drain the eastern side of
the <span class="a">McIlwraith Range</span>, including the
valleys of the Rocky River, Scrubby Creek and Chester River,
which now form the <span class="a">Rocky River Goldfield</span>.
It is noted on the 19th that "several of our horses were now
quite unable to carry anything but the saddle." On the following
day the party "passed over a piece of stiff ground about two
miles in extent, which appeared to have been the scene of a
devastating <span class="a">Hurricane</span>. The ground was
covered with fallen timber, which rendered it very difficult to
cross. The wind must have swept from the south-west to the
north-east, and from the appearance of the saplings which were
growing from the stumps of some of the trees which had been
broken, this terrific storm appeared to have taken place about
two years ago. Not a tree had been left standing . . . Many of
the trees in the middle of the fallen timber measured two feet in
diameter. Some were torn up by the roots, and the trunks of
others were snapped off at various heights from the ground." It
is interesting to compare this description with that of the
cyclone-swept clearing seen by me on 20th February, 1880.</p>
<p>Kennedy's camp of 20<i>th October</i> was in 13&deg; 35' S.
lat., which was probably in the valley between the McIlwraith and
Macrossan Ranges, south of the mouth of the <span class=
"a">Nisbet River</span>. It is safe to assume that Kennedy
followed this valley, which not only affords an easy passage to
the north, but is practically the only one.</p>
<p>On the 22<i>nd October</i>, only a short stage was made, three
of the party, Douglas, Taylor and Costigan, who were suffering
from diarrhoea, being compelled to ride, in spite of the weakness
of the horses. The flour was found to be reduced to 200 lb. In 70
days which had passed since it was weighed at 700 lb., the 13 men
had consumed 500 lb., or at the rate of 0.55 lb. per man per day,
so that they must have kept strictly to the ration fixed on 14th
August. The three sick men "complained despairingly to Mr.
Kennedy that they should <span class="a">never be able to reach
Cape York</span>"&mdash;and they never did. The travelling this
day is briefly described as "between the hills," which makes it
almost certain that the party was between the McIlwraith and
Macrossan Ranges, and now ascending the valley of the
<span class="a">Nisbet River</span>. The blacks were burning the
grass to the south.</p>
<p>In the six following days, 23<i>rd</i> to 28<i>th October</i>,
the expedition travelled over "a rocky mountainous country,
interspersed with deep gullies and creeks, fringed with belts of
scrub." Kennedy must have got up on the eastern slopes of the
<span class="a">McIlwraith Range</span>, crossing Swallow,
Cherry, Surprise and Greyhound Creeks. Had he but known, he might
have found an ideal natural road by running the Nisbet River to
its head and crossing into the Lockhart Valley by an almost
imperceptible gap.</p>
<p>In all probability, when I was attacked on 9th January, 1880,
and my horse was killed by the blacks, I was standing on
Kennedy's footsteps. I probably also followed his track on 18th
January, 1880, between my Camps 25 and 26. Dickie, Dick and
Sheffield's "home" track, as far as it went NNW. from Cherry
Creek, in 1910, was probably also Kennedy's.</p>
<p>29<i>th October</i>. This was Sunday and there were "prayers
at eleven o'clock" and three wallabies were shot to eke out the
scanty food supply. The party remained in camp, and the horses
must have needed rest.</p>
<p>30<i>th October</i>. Luff was too lame to walk. Here the two
last of the round tents were burned to lighten the load and
enable Luff to ride. The party had left Rockingham Bay with a 6
ft. by 8 ft. tent for Kennedy and two large tents and a small
round one for the others.</p>
<p>It is doubtful, from the wording of Carron's narrative,
whether the party left camp on the 1st and 2nd November. One more
horse was killed, leaving fifteen.</p>
<p>Very little progress was made on 3<i>rd November</i>, the
party having had to cut through scrub intersected by deep gullies
and rocky hills. In the afternoon they reached "a small river,
with very uneven rocky bottom, running southerly," with a rapid
current swollen by a recent rainfall. There can be no doubt that
this was the upper portion of the <span class="a">Pascoe
River</span>, the only stream with a southerly fall in these
parts. (Here I crossed his track, in 1880, between my Camps 31
and 32, and again between Camps 32 and 33.) The Pascoe, it may be
remarked, has a singular course. Rising in the centre of the
Janet Range, it first runs south-south-east and south for 14
miles, then west for 20 miles, due north for 16 miles, north-east
for 17 miles, and finally east for 10 miles, when it falls into
Weymouth Bay.</p>
<p>On reaching the Pascoe, five of the horses, including the one
carrying <span class="a">Carron's botanical specimens and
seeds</span>, fell in crossing the river, but the specimens were
recovered. The night's camp was in a thick bamboo scrub by the
side of the river, the <span class="a">horses</span> being
<span class="a">tied to trees</span>.</p>
<p>On the 4<i>th November</i>, the camp was not moved.
Jackey-Jackey climbed a hill and saw grass ahead, and shot a
cassowary. Mr. Wall failed to preserve the skin "properly."
Greater misfortunes were to follow.</p>
<p>While admiring the persistency with which the botanist and
naturalist kept their object before them, one cannot help
wondering whether they had not lost all sense of proportion. To
load even a single horse with specimens at the same time that
they were daily throwing away the necessaries of life seems a
questionable proceeding.</p>
<p>On 5<i>th November</i>, the camp was moved to the hill from
which Jackey-Jackey had seen the grass, and another horse was
killed, leaving fourteen. A halt was made at this hill on 6<i>th
November</i>, and two more horses were killed, leaving twelve.
The condition of the remaining horses, which had, apparently, not
eaten for four days, may be imagined.</p>
<p>On 7<i>th</i> and 8<i>th November</i>, travelling over "very
rough rocky ground, intersected with gullies and belts of scrub,
the head of the <span class="a">Pascoe</span> <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> was reached.</p>
<blockquote>[1) This river was afterwards named in honour of
Lieutenant Pascoe, the officer in command of the party of marines
who arrived at Somerset on 25th March, 1863.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>On 9<i>th November</i>, starting without breakfast, having had
no water to bake with, the party got over a gap and into a creek
running to the north. They must have threaded their way among the
peaks afterwards named <span class="a">South Pap, North Pap,
Mount Dobson</span> and <span class="a">Mount
Nelson</span>&mdash;probably west of the "Paps" and east of the
"Mounts." They ran the creek down, and in the evening found water
in its bed and camped. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-b">MAP B.</a>)</p>
<p>On 10<i>th November</i>, the expedition moved about three
miles northward down the valley of the creek and camped near a
spot where a great number of pandanus trees were growing. On the
11<i>th</i>, a further progress of 2 or 3 miles was made to the
north; the creek was crossed where it turned eastward and showed
the influence of the tide; and the party camped. This day the
<span class="a">last sheep</span> presumably the only one that
had reached the camp&mdash;was <span class="a">killed</span>.</p>
<p>The camp was visited by several <span class=
"a">natives</span>, who conducted themselves peaceably, having
been gratified by presents of a tin plate and fish-hooks and
impressed by the shooting of fourteen or fifteen hawks. One of
the dogs killed a puppy belonging to the natives, and the puppy
was eaten by Dunn, Luff, Costigan and Goddard.</p>
<p>On Sunday, 12<i>th November</i>, there were "prayers at
eleven." Carron and Jackey-Jackey walked to the beach in the hope
of finding a supply of salt, but were disappointed.</p>
<p>On 13<i>th November</i>, the camp was shifted to a more
suitable position on the right or southern bank of the creek, at
the foot of a high bare hill. The hill was evidently what appears
in the Admiralty Chart of 1897 as <span class="a">Barrett
Hill</span>, the camp being at the northern end of the hill.
Carron gives its latitude as 12&deg; 35' S., but it is really
12&deg; 31'.</p>
<p>Kennedy was constitutionally averse to admitting his defeat
and hard to convince; but he had at last been satisfied by the
unanswerable logic of facts that it was impossible to complete
the journey as he had originally planned. He now made
preparations for a <span class="a">dash to Cape York</span>, from
which he hoped to bring speedy relief to the party left in charge
of <span class="a">Carron</span> at the dep&ocirc;t on the
<span class="a">Pascoe River</span>, near its outfall into
Weymouth Bay.</p>
<p>A short distance below the dep&ocirc;t, the creek which had
been followed down from 9th November becomes a tidal inlet and
joins the <span class="a">Pascoe River</span>. The river itself
is little more than a mile north of the camp of the 11th. North
of the river, a range of mountains extends north-westward, by
Fair Cape to Temple Bay. To this I gave the name of the
<span class="a">Carron Range</span> (see my Diary of 11th
February, 1880). According to the Admiralty Chart of 1897,
individual peaks of the range are now named <span class="a">Wall
Hill, Huxley Hill, Stanley Hill, Kennedy Hill</span> (the highest
point, 1,440 feet) and <span class="a">Carron Hill</span> (1,380
feet). <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> South of the river mouth
lies the mountain mass which I named the <span class="a">Janet
Range</span> in 1880. Individual points now appear on the chart,
including <span class="a">Simpson Hill</span> at the mouth of the
Pascoe, <span class="a">Barrett Hill</span> (on the north end of
which was Carron's dep&ocirc;t), the <span class="a">Round Back
Hills</span>, near Cape Weymouth, <span class="a">Mount
Tozer</span> (the highest point, 1,953 feet), the "<span class=
"a">South</span>" and "<span class="a">North" Paps, Mount Dobson,
Mount Nelson</span> and the <span class="a">Goddard Hills</span>.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The names commemorate Kennedy's
expedition, the voyage of the relief ship "<i>Ariel</i>" (1848),
the voyage of the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" and the administration of
two Premiers of Queensland, Sir Horace Tozer and Sir Hugh
Nelson.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Names given by the officers of the surveying
ships "<i>Paluma</i>" and "<i>Dart</i>," 1890-8. See the chapters
on Minuti&aelig; of Marine Surveys.]</blockquote>
<p>Kennedy and Carron took stock of the <span class=
"a">provisions</span> remaining on 13th November, which consisted
of 46 lb. of flour, 75 lb. of dried horseflesh and 1 lb. of tea.
The consumption of flour since stock was taken on 23rd October
had been at the rate of 0.7 lb. per man per day.</p>
<p>The twenty-seven <span class="a">horses</span> with which the
expedition set out from Rockingham Bay had now been reduced to
<span class="a">nine</span>. There were, apparently, twelve on
6th November, so that three are unaccounted for. They either died
in the passage of the Janet Range, or Carron omitted to mention
some deaths or losses when they took place.</p>
<p><span class="a">Kennedy took</span> with him <span class=
"a">seven</span> of the <span class="a">horses</span>, the 75 lb.
of <span class="a">horseflesh</span>, 18 lb. of <span class=
"a">flour</span> and half a pound of <span class="a">tea.
Carron</span> and his party were left with 28 lb. of <span class=
"a">flour</span>, half a pound of <span class="a">tea</span> and
two <span class="a">horses</span>, which were to be killed for
food as occasion required. He was instructed to make his
provisions last for six weeks. Besides Carron, the party left at
the dep&ocirc;t consisted of Wall, Niblet, Taylor, Carpenter,
Goddard, Mitchell and Douglas. Those eight men were to wait in
camp for the relief which Kennedy hoped to bring them by water in
fourteen days at the earliest. Kennedy expected to meet H.M.S.
"<i>Bramble</i>" at Port Albany and to have a party sent out at
once to Weymouth Bay by sea.</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald Meston in his <i>Report on the Aboriginals of
Queensland</i>, <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> states that in
1896 he mustered the blacks of the district surrounding Moreton
Telegraph Station, and adds: "One old fellow remembered Kennedy's
expedition of 1848 and all the fatal circumstances of the last
sad days. He said Kennedy had been shooting blacks all along his
track."</p>
<blockquote>[2) <i>Report on the Aboriginals of Queensland</i>,
by Archibald Meston, Special Commission under Instructions from
the Queensland Government, Brisbane. By Authority,
1896.]</blockquote>
<p>If that old black really saw the Kennedy expedition
forty-eight years before he told the story, there can be no doubt
that he exaggerated grossly. Carron records only two instances
(16th September and 10th October, 1848) when Kennedy's party used
firearms in self-defence. If there was any foundation for the
"old fellow's" story, he was probably confounding the Kennedy
with the Jardine expeditions. Supposing him to have been ten
years old in 1848, he would be fifty-eight when Meston
interviewed him, and at fifty-eight an Australian aborigine is in
his dotage. The accuracy of such a person's recollection of
dates, figures or names would be open to grave doubt.</p>

<p>K<small>ENNEDY</small>, accompanied by <span class=
"a">Costigan, Dunn, Luff</span> and <span class=
"a">Jackey-Jackey, left the Pascoe Depot</span> on 13<i>th
November</i>, 1848. On 22<i>nd December</i>, <span class=
"a">Jackey-Jackey</span>, the sole survivor of the party, having
been forty days on the journey, <span class="u">arrived at Cape
York</span> and he was taken on board the "<i>Ariel</i>" on the
following morning. The "<i>Ariel</i>" sailed the same evening
bent on relief, and Dr. <span class="a">Adoniah Vallack</span>,
who was on board, committed <span class="a">Jackey-Jackey's
deposition</span> to writing. This deposition is a document of
the utmost value, not only because it is almost the only record
of Kennedy's last journey, but also because it throws light on
the aboriginal mind and its limitations. I have myself on many
occasions been under the necessity of eliciting information from
aboriginals, and my experience is that a very short course of
interrogation is sufficient to confuse and give them brain-fag,
which generally ends in sulks, so that it is difficult or
impossible to obtain from them a consecutive tale.
Jackey-Jackey's "Statement" is a marked instance of this
limitation, and it is evident that Dr. Vallack, tactful as he
was, gave up the attempt to pin the hero of the tale down to
dates. Moreover, the poor fellow was <span class="a">distracted,
weak</span> from wounds and fatigue, and <span class=
"a">starving</span>, and was probably <span class=
"a">unconscious</span> for a considerable part of the eventful
forty days; and thus could not be expected to take note of the
divisions of time in such a manner as to satisfy either a Justice
of the Peace or an historian.</p>
<p>As the "Statement," for what it is worth, must form the text
from which any conclusions whatever regarding the last days of
Kennedy's career must be drawn, it is given below in its
entirety; but I have added my conjectures as to dates in notes
within the text and appended explanatory footnotes.</p>

<p><span class="a">I started with Mr. Kennedy</span> from
Weymouth Bay for Cape York, on the 13<i>th November</i>, 1848,
accompanied by <span class="a">Costigan, Dunn, and Luff</span>,
leaving eight men at the camp, at Weymouth Bay. We went on till
we came to a <span class="a">river</span> <a href=
"#note-01"><b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></a> which empties
itself into Weymouth Bay. A little further north we crossed the
river [13<i>th November</i>]; next morning a lot of <span class=
"a">natives</span> camped on the other side of the river. Mr.
Kennedy and the rest of us went on a <span class="a">very high
hill</span> <a href="#note-02"><b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b></a> and came to a flat on the other side
and camped there [14<i>th November</i>]; I went on a good way
next day [15<i>th November</i>]; a <span class="a">horse
fell</span> down a creek; the <span class="a">flour</span> we
took with us <span class="a">lasted three days</span>; we had
much trouble in getting the horse out of the creek; we went on,
and came out, and camped [16<i>th November</i>] on the ridges; we
had <span class="a">no water</span>. Next morning went on and
<span class="a">Luff</span> was taken <span class="a">ill</span>
with a very bad knee; we left him behind, and Dunn went back
again and brought him on [17<i>th November</i>]; Luff was riding
a horse named Fiddler; then we went on and camped at a little
creek <a href="#note-03"><b style="color:#603000">[3]</b></a>
[18<i>th November</i>]; the flour being out this day we commenced
<span class="a">eating horseflesh</span>, which Carron gave us
when we left Weymouth Bay; as we went on we came on a small
river, <a href="#note-04"><b style="color:#603000">[4]</b></a>
and saw no blacks there; as we proceeded we gathered <span class=
"a">nondas</span>, and lived upon them and the meat; we stopped
at a little creek <a href="#note-05"><b style=
"color:#603000">[5]</b></a> and it came on raining, and
<span class="a">Costigan shot himself</span>; <a href=
"#note-06"><b style="color:#603000">[6]</b></a> in putting his
saddle under the tarpaulin a string caught the trigger and the
ball went in under the right arm and came out at his back under
the shoulder; we went on this morning all of us, and stopped at
another creek in the evening [19<i>th November</i>], and the next
morning <a href="#note-07"><b style="color:#603000">[7]</b></a>
we <span class="a">killed a horse</span> named Browney, smoked
him that night [20<i>th November</i>], and went on next day,
taking as much of the horse as we could with us, and went on
about a mile and then turned back again to where we killed the
horse, because Costigan was very bad and in much pain; we went
back again because there was no water; then Mr. Kennedy and I had
dinner there and went on in the afternoon [21<i>st November</i>],
<span class="a">leaving Dunn, Costigan and Luff</span> at the
creek. This was at Pudding-Pan Hill, near Shelburne Bay.
<span class="a">Mr. Kennedy called it Pudding-Pan Hill</span>.
<a href="#note-08"><b style="color:#603000">[8]</b></a> We left
some horse meat with the three men at Pudding-Pan Hill and
carried some with us on a pack-horse. Mr. Kennedy wanted to make
great haste when he left this place, in order to get the doctor
to go down to the men that were ill. This was about three weeks
after leaving Weymouth Bay. <a href="#note-09"><b style=
"color:#603000">[9]</b></a> <span class="a">one horse</span> was
<span class="a">left</span> with the three men at Pudding-Pan
Hill, and <span class="a">we</span> (Kennedy and myself) took
with us <span class="a">three horses</span>. <a href=
"#note-10"><b style="color:#603000">[10]</b></a> The three men
were to remain there until Mr. Kennedy and myself had gone to and
returned from Cape York for them. Mr. Kennedy told Luff and Dunn
when he left them, if Costigan died they were to come along the
beach till they saw the ship, and then to fire a gun; he told
them he would not be long away, so it was not likely they would
move from there for some time. They stopped to take care of the
man that was shot; we (me and Mr. Kennedy) <span class="a">killed
a horse</span> for them before we came away. Having <span class=
"a">left these three men</span>, we camped that night [21<i>st
November</i>] where there was no water; <a href=
"#note-11"><b style="color:#603000">[11]</b></a> next morning Mr.
Kennedy and me went on with the <span class="a">four
horses</span>: <a href="#note-12"><b style=
"color:#603000">[12]</b></a> two pack-horses and two
saddle-horses; <span class="a">one horse</span> got <span class=
"a">bogged</span> in a swamp. We tried to get him out all day,
but could not; we <span class="a">left him</span> there, <a href=
"#note-13"><b style="color:#603000">[13]</b></a> and camped at
another creek <a href="#note-14"><b style=
"color:#603000">[14]</b></a> [22<i>nd November</i>]. The next day
Mr. Kennedy and I went on again, and passed up a ridge very
scrubby and had to turn back again, and went along gulleys to get
clear of the creek and scrub. <a href="#note-15"><b style=
"color:#603000">[15]</b></a> Now it rained and we camped <a href=
"#note-16"><b style="color:#603000">[16]</b></a> [23<i>rd
November</i>]; there were plenty of <span class="a">blacks</span>
here, but we did not see them, but plenty of fresh tracks, and
camps, and smoke. <a href="#note-17"><b style=
"color:#603000">[17]</b></a> Next morning we went on and camped
at another creek <a href="#note-18"><b style=
"color:#603000">[18]</b></a> [27<i>th November</i>], and on the
following morning we continued going on, and camped in the
evening close to a scrub <a href="#note-19"><b style=
"color:#603000">[19]</b></a> [28<i>th November</i>]; it rained in
the night. Next day we went on in the <span class=
"a">scrub</span>, but <span class="a">could not get
through</span>. I cut and cleared away, and it was near sundown
before we got through the scrub&mdash;there we camped [29<i>th
November</i>]. [<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP
A.</a>] It was heavy <span class="a">rain</span> next morning,
and we went on in the rain; then I changed horses and rode a
black colt, to spell the other, and rode him all day, and in the
afternoon we got on clear ground, and the <span class="a">horse
fell</span> down, me and all; the horse lay upon my right hip.
Here Mr. Kennedy got off his horse and moved my horse from my
thigh; we stopped there that night [30<i>th November</i>], and
could not get the horse up; we looked to him in the morning and
he was <span class="a">dead</span>; <a href="#note-20"><b style=
"color:#603000">[20]</b></a> we left him there. We had some horse
meat left to eat, and went on that day and crossed a <span class=
"a">little river</span> and camped <a href="#note-21"><b style=
"color:#603000">[21]</b></a> [1<i>st December</i>]. The next day
we went a good way; Mr. Kennedy told me to go up a tree to see a
sandy hill somewhere; I went up a tree, and saw a sandy hill a
little way down from Port Albany. That day we camped near a swamp
<a href="#note-22"><b style="color:#603000">[22]</b></a> [2<i>nd
December</i>]; it was a very rainy day. The next morning we went
on, and Mr. Kennedy told me we should get round to Port Albany in
a day; we travelled on all day till twelve o'clock (noon), and
then we saw Port Albany; then he said: "There is <span class=
"a">Port Albany</span>, Jackey a ship is there you see that
island there," pointing to <span class="a">Albany Island</span>;
this was when we were at the mouth of <span class="a">Escape
River</span>. <a href="#note-23"><b style=
"color:#603000">[23]</b></a> We stopped there a little while;
<span class="a">all the meat was gone</span>; I tried to get some
fish, but could not; we went on in the afternoon half a mile
<span class="a">along the river-side</span>, <a href=
"#note-24"><b style="color:#603000">[24]</b></a> and met a good
lot of <span class="a">blacks</span>, and we camped [3<i>rd
December</i>]; the blacks all cried out "Powad powad," and rubbed
their bellies; and we thought they were friendly, and Mr. Kennedy
gave them fish-hooks all round; everyone asked me if I had
anything to give away, and I said "No," and Mr. Kennedy said,
"Give them your knife, Jackey"; this fellow on board was the man
I gave the knife to; I am sure of it; I know him well; the black
that was shot in the canoe was the most active in urging all the
others on to spear Mr. Kennedy; <span class="a">I gave the man on
board my knife</span>; <a href="#note-25"><b style=
"color:#603000">[25]</b></a> we went on this day, <a href=
"#note-26"><b style="color:#603000">[26]</b></a> and I looked
behind, and they were getting up their spears, and ran all round
the camp which we had left; I told Mr. Kennedy that very likely
those black fellows would follow us, and he said, "No, Jackey,
those blacks are very friendly"; I said to him, "I know these
black fellows well, they too much speak"; we went on some 2 or 3
miles and camped [4<i>th December</i>]; I and Mr. Kennedy watched
them that night, taking it in turns every hour all night;
by-and-by I saw the black fellows; it was a <span class=
"a">moonlight night</span>; and I walked up to Mr. Kennedy and
said to him, "There is plenty of black fellows now"; this was in
the middle of the night; Mr. Kennedy told me to get my gun ready;
the blacks did not know where we slept, as we did not make a
fire; we both sat up all night; after this, daylight came [5<i>th
December</i>], and I fetched the horses and saddled them; then we
went on a good way up the river, and then we sat down a little
while, and we saw three <span class="a">black fellows</span>
coming along our track, and they saw us, and one fellow ran back
as hard as he could run, and fetched up plenty more, like a flock
of sheep almost; I told Mr. Kennedy to put the saddles on the
<span class="a">two horses</span> and go on, and the blacks came
up, and they <span class="a">followed us all the day</span>; all
along it was raining, and I now told him to leave the horses and
come on without them, that the horses made too much track. Mr.
Kennedy was too weak, and would not leave the horses. We went on
this day till towards evening [5<i>th December</i>]; raining
hard, and the blacks followed us all the day, some behind, some
planted before; in fact, <span class="a">blacks all around</span>
following us. Now we went on into a little bit of a scrub, and I
told Mr. Kennedy to look behind always; sometimes he would do so,
and sometimes he would not look behind to look out for the
blacks. Then a good many black fellows came behind in the scrub,
and threw plenty of <span class="a">spears</span>, and
<span class="a">hit Mr. Kennedy</span> in the back first. Mr.
Kennedy said to me, "Oh ! Jackey-Jackey ! shoot 'em, shoot 'em."
Then I pulled out my gun and fired, and hit one fellow all over
the face with buck shot; he tumbled down, and got up again and
again, and wheeled right round, and two black fellows picked him
up and carried him away. They went away then a little way, and
came back again, <span class="a">throwing spears</span> all
around, more than they did before; very large spears. I pulled
out the spear at once from Mr. Kennedy's back, and cut out the
jag with Mr. Kennedy's knife; then Mr. Kennedy got his gun and
snapped, but the gun would not go off. The blacks sneaked all
along by the trees, and speared Mr. Kennedy again in the right
leg, above the knee a little, and <span class="a">I got
speared</span> over the eye, and the blacks were now throwing
their spears all ways, never giving over, and shortly again
speared Mr. Kennedy in the right side; there were large jags to
the spears, and I cut them out and put them into my pocket. At
the same time we got speared, the <span class="a">horses got
speared</span> too; and jumped and bucked all about, and got into
the swamp. I now told Mr. Kennedy to sit down, while I looked
after the saddle-bags, which I did; and when I came back again, I
saw blacks along with Mr. Kennedy; I then asked him if he saw the
blacks with him; he was <span class="a">stupid with the spear
wounds</span>, and said "No"; then I asked where was his watch. I
saw the blacks taking away watch and hat as I was returning to
Mr. Kennedy; then I carried Mr. Kennedy into the scrub; he said,
"Don't carry me a good way"; then Mr. Kennedy looked this way,
very bad (Jackey rolling his eyes). I said to him, "Don't look
far away," as I thought he would be frightened; I asked him
often, "Are you well now," and he said, "I don't care for the
spear wound in my leg, Jackey, but for the other two spear wounds
in my side and back," and said, "I am bad inside, Jackey." I told
him black fellow always die when he got spear in there (the
back); he said, "I am out of wind, Jackey"; and I asked him, "Mr.
Kennedy, are you going to leave me?" and he said, "Yes, my boy, I
am going to leave you"; he said," I am very bad, Jackey; you
<span class="a">take the books</span>, Jackey, to the Captain,
<span class="a">but not the big ones</span>, <a href=
"#note-27"><b style="color:#603000">[27]</b></a> the Governor
will give anything for them." I then tied up the papers; he then
said, "Jackey, give me paper and I will write"; I gave him paper
and pencil and he tried to write, and he then fell back and died
<a href="#note-28"><b style="color:#603000">[28]</b></a> [5<i>th
December</i>, dusk]; and I caught him as he fell back and held
him, and I then turned round myself and cried; I was crying a
good while until I got well; that was about an hour, and then
<span class="a">I buried him</span>; I digged up the ground with
a tomahawk, and covered him over with logs, then grass, and my
shirt and trousers.</p>
<p>That night I left him near dark; I would go through the scrub,
and the <span class="a">blacks threw spears</span> at me, a good
many, and I went back again into the scrub; then I went down the
creek which runs into <span class="a">Escape River</span>, and I
walked along the water in the creek very easy, with my head only
above water, to avoid the blacks, and get out of their way; in
this way I went half a mile; then I got out of the creek, and got
clear of them, and walked on all night nearly, and slept in the
bush without a fire; I went on next morning and felt very bad,
and I spelled for two days [6<i>th</i> and 7<i>th December</i>];
I lived upon nothing but salt water; next day I went on and
camped 1 mile away from where I left [8<i>th December</i>, camp],
and ate one of the pandanus fruits; next morning I went on 2
miles, and sat down there, and I wanted to spell a little there,
and go on; but when I tried to get up, I could not, but fell down
again very tired and cramped, and I spelled here two days [camp];
then I went on again 1 mile, and got nothing to eat but one nonda
[camp]; and I went on that day <a href="#note-29"><b style=
"color:#603000">[29]</b></a> and camped [camp], and on again next
morning, about half a mile, and sat down where there was good
water, and remained all day [camp]. On the following morning, I
went a good way, went round a great swamp and mangroves, and got
a good way by sundown [camp]; the next morning I went and saw a
very large track of black fellows; I went clear of the track and
of swamp or sandy ground; then I came to a <span class="a">very
large river</span>; <a href="#note-30"><b style=
"color:#603000">[30]</b></a> and a large lagoon; plenty of
<span class="a">alligators</span> in the lagoon, about 10 miles
from Port Albany. I now got into the ridges by sundown, and went
up a tree and saw <span class="a">Albany Island</span> [camp];
then next morning at four o'clock <a href="#note-31"><b style=
"color:#603000">[31]</b></a> I went on as hard as I could go all
the way down, over fine clear ground, fine ironbark timber, and
plenty of good grass; I went on round the point (this was towards
Cape York north of Albany Island) and went on and <span class=
"a">followed a creek down</span>, and went on top of the hill,
and <span class="a">saw Cape York</span>; and I knew it was Cape
York, because the sand did not go on further; I sat down then a
good while; I said to myself, "This is <span class="a">Port
Albany</span>, I believe inside somewhere"; Mr. Kennedy also told
me that the ship was inside, close up to the mainland; I went on
a little way, and <span class="a">saw the ship</span> and boat; I
met close up here two black gins and a good many piccaninnies;
one said to me "Powad, powad" <a href="#note-32"><b style=
"color:#603000">[32]</b></a> ; then I asked her for eggs; she
gave me turtle's eggs, and I gave her a burning-glass; she
pointed to the ship which I had seen before; I was very
frightened of seeing the black men all along here, and when I was
on the rock cooeying, and murry murry glad when the boat came for
me [8 <i>a.m.</i>, 23<i>rd December</i>, 1848].</p>

<br>
<blockquote><a name="note-08" id="note-08"></a>[8) It is clear,
from subsequent events, that Kennedy was mistaken in his position
and believed that he was at the Pudding-Pan Hill of the Charts
(named by Bligh) when he was actually 50 miles south of it. As
far as appearance goes, any one of the numerous fragmentary
Desert Sandstone tablelands might be supposed to bear a fanciful
resemblance to an inverted "pudding-pan." All the known
circumstances are in favour of Kennedy's so-called Pudding-Pan
Hill being west of Cape Grenville. The probability is that it was
the "Sandstone Table" sketched by me on 25th February, 1880, in
12&deg; 1' S. lat. and 142&deg; 34' E. long. Jackey-Jackey's
petulant remark: "Mr. Kennedy called it Pudding-Pan Hill "was
evidently his reply to cross-examination when the spot where the
men had been left had become the question of the hour in the
minds of the officers of the relief ship.]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote><a name="note-09" id="note-09"></a>[9) Jackey-Jackey
has accounted for only nine days. They probably seemed like three
weeks to him, and his arithmetic was defective.]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote><a name="note-10" id="note-10"></a>[10) Jackey-Jackey
breaking down under the strain of prolonged cross-interrogation
and his memory and arithmetic hazy. He states on the

so-called Pudding-Pan Hill with two pack-horses and two
saddle-horses.]</blockquote>

Pascoe with seven horses. One was killed on 19th November, one
live horse and one which was killed for food were left with the
party at the so-called Pudding-Pan Hill on 20th. Four were now
left to go on with Kennedy.]</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote><a name="note-15" id="note-15"></a>[15) The
description of this country, with its bogs and scrub, corresponds
with that of the country where my own party were in great
difficulties from the same cause (involving starvation for the
horses) between Camps 51 and 55, 1st-6th March, 1880, and where
the Jardine Brothers had experienced similar difficulties between
their Camps 71 and 77, 17th-23rd January, 1865. The "ridge very
scrubby" may have been the same on which Jardine's 74th and 75th
Camps and my 51st, 54th and 55th were situated.]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote><a name="note-16" id="note-16"></a>[16) This camp was
probably west of Helby Hill, near Jardine's 77th and my 52nd
Camp. The "gulleys" to which the travellers doubled back" to get
clear of the creek and scrub "were probably heads of my "Captain
Billy's" and "Camisade" Creeks.]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote><a name="note-17" id="note-17"></a>[17) The
<i>Herald</i> reporter obtained a significant addition to
Jackey-Jackey's story (<i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, 6th March,
1849): "Mr. Kennedy once got into a bog, after leaving
Pudding-Pan Hill, up to his shoulder, and was 'like a pig in the
mud,' Jackey says. He lifted him out . . . After Jackey had taken
Mr. Kennedy out of the bog between Shelburne Bay and Escape
River, they <span class="u">spelled for several days</span>, he
was so ill, and Jackey says he carried him often on his
back&mdash;not far; only half a mile at a time . . . Sometimes
Jackey carried Mr. Kennedy from place to place when he was ill,
out of the way of the blacks, and, as he terms it, 'planted'
him." It may be conjectured that this "spell" of several days
took place at the camp of 23rd November. We may suppose that
perhaps for three days (24th, 25th and 26th) Jackey-Jackey was
busy collecting food, evading the blacks, and from time to time
carrying his enfeebled master to new hiding-places.]</blockquote>

the spot on 11th May, 1849.]</blockquote>

have been 23rd December, although by the most liberal reckoning
of the Camps mentioned by Jackey-Jackey it would only be the
15th. Eight days are thus unaccounted for. Hungry, thirsty and
utterly exhausted as the narrator of the tale was, as is evident
from his creeping on at the rate of a mile or half a mile in a
day, his periods of sleep and insensibility were, no doubt,
longer than he knew, and as he scarcely knew, at times, what he
was doing, his memory was not to be relied on&mdash;at least
since his and Kennedy's arrival at the Escape

<p>T<small>HE</small> Schooner "<i>Ariel</i>" (72 tons),
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> under the command of
<span class="a">Captain Dobson</span>, having on board
<span class="a">Dr. Adoniah Vallack</span> and <span class=
"a">Barrett</span>, who were to join Kennedy's party, was
chartered by the Government of New South Wales to await Kennedy's
arrival and supply him with provisions for the return journey.
The ship left Sydney on 2<i>nd October</i>, 1848, and reached
<span class="a">Port Albany</span> on the 27<i>th</i> of the same
month. Although the period for which she had been chartered had
expired, she was still waiting when <span class="a">Jackey-Jackey
arrived</span> on 23<i>rd December</i> with the news of the fate
of the expedition.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Number of hands not stated. One of the crew was
named Parker and another is referred to by Dr. Vallack as
"Thomas" and "Tom," but it is not clear whether this was a
Christian name or a surname.]</blockquote>
<p>The story of the rescue of the survivors is contained in (1) a
<span class="a">Statement by Captain Dobson</span>, printed with
Carron's Narrative but not reprinted in the <i>Voyage of the
"Rattlesnake</i>" (2) a <span class="a">Statement by Dr.
Vallack</span>, printed with Carron's Narrative and reprinted in
the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" (3) a few <span class="a">Notes by Dr.
John MacGillivray</span> in the <i>Voyage of the
"Rattlesnake."</i> Captain Dobson's Statement is short and bald
and he evidently delegated to Dr. Vallack the task of writing the
history of his voyage.</p>
<p><span class="a">Jackey-Jackey</span> was seen from the ship
about 8 a.m. on 23rd December, "first standing, then walking very
lame, then sitting down on a rock." When taken on board he became
faint and had to be revived with wine. He carried the mark of a
spear wound on his forehead. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-a">MAP A.</a>)</p>
<p>The "<i>Ariel</i>" after losing the remainder of the day in an
attempt to increase the supply of beef, got away on 24<i>th
December</i>. <span class="a">Dr. Vallack</span> spent that day
in eliciting the information already given in <span class=
"a">Jackey-Jackey's "Statement</span>." The deponent could not be
kept too long under the strain of examination and Dr. Vallack
humoured him "by changing the subject now and then by speaking of
his comrades at Jerry's Plains." The anchorage for the night was
5 miles south of <span class="a">Shadwell Point</span>, opposite
the mouth of <span class="a">Henderson Creek</span>.</p>
<p>A dead calm the following morning (25<i>th December</i>) made
it useless to weigh anchor till about 10 o'clock, when a light
breeze sprang up. Shortly afterwards, a <span class=
"a">canoe</span> was met with&mdash;probably about 2 miles north
of the Gilmore Bank&mdash;and the native crew were interrogated.
One native was allowed to come on board, and Jackey-Jackey, who
had been stationed in the foretop, recognised the <span class=
"a">natives</span> as those <span class="a">who had speared
Kennedy</span>, the one who had come on board being the one to
whom Jackey-Jackey had given his knife at Kennedy's request. The
native was therefore forcibly detained, and it was observed that
his arm was decorated with part of a bridle and a piece of a
tendon of a horse round his arm. The other blacks in the meantime
had jumped into the sea and the long-boat was put out to examine
the deserted canoe for other relics. Observing the boat, the
natives re-entered the canoe and paddled for the shore. The boat,
however, overtook the canoe, when all the blacks again sprang
overboard, with the exception of one, who <span class="a">speared
Barrett</span> in the arm, and was himself shot. The boat
returned to the ship towing the canoe, in which lay the dying
native. A portion of a spear, an inch in length, was extracted by
Dr. Vallack from Barrett's arm on 13th February.</p>
<p>There were found in the canoe "the leg part of a pair of
trousers, three spears, a piece of iron of a saddle, hooks and
lines, etc.," and a piece of moleskin was taken off the captive
native's leg and identified by Jackey-Jackey as part of his own
trousers which he had tied round <span class="a">Kennedy's</span>
head before burying the body. Jackey concluded, and, no doubt,
correctly, that the <span class="a">body</span> had been
<span class="a">exhumed</span>. (<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>)</p>
<p>With a favouring and refreshing breeze the ship resumed her
course, and shortly afterwards Jackey-Jackey pointed out from the
foretop, a <span class="a">hill</span> which he said was
<span class="a">like Pudding-Pan Hill. This las</span> the real
"<span class="a">Pudding-Pan Hill</span>" of the chart, but the
absence of certain surroundings which Jackey-Jackey had noted
soon convinced him that it was <span class="a">not the hill to
which Kennedy had</span> erroneously <span class="a">given that
name</span>. On his vehement insistence, the "<i>Ariel</i>" kept
on its course to the south and anchored at nightfall "in the
centre of <span class="a">Hannibal Bay, Risk Point</span>
ahead."</p>
<p>There is no Hannibal Bay in the chart from which I made my
travelling "blank" in 1869, nor in that of 1894, but the double
bay extending north from the latitude of the Hannibal Islands to
False Orford Ness was so named in the older charts which,
presumably, were carried by Kennedy and Captain Dobson in 1848.
Risk Point, although not named in the chart which I used in 1879,
nor in later issues, must have appeared in the charts carried by
Kennedy and Captain Dobson in 1848, and is located from bearings
taken by Captain Simpson as 11&deg; 35' 30" S. The probability is
that the anchorage of 25<i>th December</i> was off the mouth of
<span class="a">Camisade Creek</span>, where, thirty-one years
later, the blacks attacked my own party.</p>
<p>While approaching the anchorage in the afternoon of 25th
December, Dr. Vallack saw about forty <span class=
"a">natives</span> on the shore.</p>
<p>On 26<i>th December</i>, the "<i>Ariel</i>" struck a reef
within a few minutes of weighing anchor, but got off without
damage. She <span class="a">anchored</span> in the afternoon in
<span class="a">Shelburne Bay</span> in sight of a <span class=
"a">hill</span> which Jackey-Jackey identified by surrounding
landmarks as the locality <span class="a">where Costigan, Dunn
and Luff had been left</span> on 20th November (Costigan having
been mortally wounded by an accidental gunshot) and which Kennedy
erroneously supposed to be the "Pudding-Pan Hill" of the chart.
Captain Dobson saw two <span class="a">natives</span> on the
shore <span class="a">wearing</span> what he took to be either
<span class="a">cloaks or blue shirts</span>.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate, considering how important it was to locate
the last resting-place of Costigan, Dunn and Luff, that Captain
Dobson did not record the latitude of his landing, which he might
easily have done from the chart in the absence of an
observation.</p>
<p>At daybreak of 27<i>th December</i> a party consisting of
<span class="a">Captain Dobson, Dr. Vallack, Barrett</span>, a
sailor named <span class="a">Tom</span> and <span class=
"a">Jackey-Jackey</span> landed on the coast, the last named
acting as guide. From a careful consideration of every expression
made use of by Dr. Vallack, the probability is that the boat,
which was left in charge of two of the "hands," touched first at
<span class="a">Double Point</span>. A <span class=
"a">canoe</span> was found here, containing part of a cloak which
Jackey-Jackey said belonged to the men left behind on the 20th
November. The party then "trudged through dense scrub inland for
about an hour." Considering the density of the scrub, that
Barrett had a spear wound, and that Jackey-Jackey had by no means
recovered his "condition," probably not more than 2 miles were
covered. The direction of the march is not stated, although
"inland" may be taken to be south-west, or at right angles to the
coast-line. Jackey-Jackey then declared that they were not going
far enough south and might as well get away in that direction
from a new point of departure on the coast which would be easier
to reach by the boat. Returning to the boat, it was decided,
before again going inland, to visit a point, probably
"<span class="a">White Point</span>", about 4 miles distant, and
at "the southernmost part of the bay," where fires had been seen
in the morning, as well as on the previous night. No camp,
however, was seen, but only the remains of a bush fire.
Jackey-Jackey then pointed out a place, about three miles distant
and "more in the central part of the bay," as the spot where the
next landing should be made. Jackey-Jackey, who was weak and lame
and had to rest from time to time, led the party westward for a
distance estimated at 6 miles, but which was probably less. He
then climbed a tree, from which he reported that he could see
<span class="a">Kennedy's supposed "Pudding-Pan Hill</span>," but
it was still a long way off, and as the party had left early in
the morning without food, under the impression that only a short
walk was before them, they went back to the boat and rejoined the
ship. The men waiting in the boat reported having seen from 50 to
100 <span class="a">natives</span> on the beach.</p>
<p>Concluding, as there was every reason to do, that Costigan,
Dunn and Luff must have long ago been dead; and seeing that
Jackey-Jackey had collapsed and was no longer capable of acting
as a guide through the bush; and, above all, mindful of their
duty to the men still possibly alive at the Pascoe Camp, it was
resolved to spend no more time in investigating the circumstances
attending the death of the "Pudding-Pan Hill" party.</p>
<p>The "<i>Ariel</i>" accordingly left Shelburne Bay next
morning, 28<i>th December</i>, dropping her anchor at night
between the <span class="a">"M" Reef</span> and <span class=
"a">Young Island</span>.</p>
<p>On the 29<i>th</i>, the anchor was dropped at the mouth of the
<span class="a">Pascoe River</span> in <span class="a">Weymouth
Bay</span>, and on the following day the last <span class=
"a">survivors of Kennedy's Expedition</span> found rest and
succour on board the "<i>Ariel</i>"</p>

<h4>THE "FREAK"</h4>
<p>B<small>EFORE</small> relating the story of the rescue of the
two survivors of the Pascoe Camp, the last efforts made to
discover traces of <span class="a">Costigan, Dunn</span> and
<span class="a">Luff</span>, and of <span class=
"a">Kennedy</span> himself, have to be recorded.</p>
<p>The brig "<i>Freak</i>," <span class="a">Captain T. Beckford
Simpson</span>, Chief Officer, Macnate, was chartered by the
Government of New South Wales" to call (on her way to Port
Essington) at Shelburne Bay and Escape River, to
ascertain&mdash;if possible&mdash;the fate of the three men left
at the former place, and recover the papers of Mr. Kennedy
secreted by Jackey-Jackey." <span class="a">Jackey-Jackey</span>
was on board, together with two other natives of his own tribe.
<span class="a">Captain Simpson's Private Log</span> of the
voyage, which appeared in Carron's book, and was reprinted in the
<i>Voyage of the "Rattlesnake"</i> gives the only available
account of what was done.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of 4<i>th May</i>, 1849, the "<i>Freak</i>"
anchored near Round Point, the eastern horn of <span class=
"a">Shelburne Bay</span>. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-b">MAP B.</a>) The importance of the exact position of the
anchorage was fully realised by the Captain, who took careful
bearings from three distinct landmarks which were then, and are
now, laid down on the chart.</p>
<!--Table bottom page 237-->
<table align="center">
<tr>
<td>Conical Hill</td>
<td>. . . . . .</td>
<td>SE.&frac12;E.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Saddle Hill</td>
<td>. . . . . .</td>
<td>S.&frac34;E.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Remarkable Sand Patch</td>
<td>. . . . . .</td>
<td>SW.&frac12;W.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Unfortunately these bearings, when plotted on the chart,
<span class="a">fix no position</span>; the inference being that
the landmarks had only been sketched from a surveying vessel, and
were therefore valueless for Captain Simpson's purpose. Had he
contented himself with giving the bearing of Round Point and
marking the approximate latitude and longitude, as taken from the
chart, the position of the anchorage and of what Jackey-Jackey
pointed out as <span class="a">Kennedy's supposed "Pudding-Pan
Hill</span>" would have been tolerably certain. From the
anchorage the bearing of that hill is given as W.&frac14;N.
Whether we assume the anchorage to have been "in 6 fathoms water"
(as stated) on the bearings given from Conical Hill, or on those
given from Saddle Hill, W.&frac14;N. would place the supposed
Pudding-Pan Hill <span class="a">north</span> of where the
"<i>Ariel's</i>" boat party first landed on 27th December, 1848;
and where that party tried, guided by Jackey-Jackey, to get away
<span class="a">south</span>. The presumption is that, seen from
a point of view new to him, Jackey-Jackey pointed out the
<span class="a">wrong hill</span> to Captain Simpson. For a
mistake of this kind, Jackey-Jackey might very well be excused,
as my own travels showed the neighbourhood to be full of little
detached sandstone tablelands, any one of which might be
fancifully likened to an inverted pudding-pan. The balance of
probability is in favour of <span class="a">Costigan, Dunn And
Luff's last camp</span> and <span class="a">Kennedy's supposed
"Pudding-Pan Hill</span>" being in the positions I have assigned
to them.</p>
<p>From daylight to 8 p.m. on the following day (5<i>th May</i>),
the whale-boat of the "<i>Freak</i>" manned by the Second
Officer, four seamen, Jackey-Jackey and his two aboriginal
companions, skirted the coast of <span class="a">Shelburne
Bay</span> and the Pacific from <span class="a">Round
Point</span> to a point nearly opposite <span class="a">Helby
Hill</span>, landing at three places, as detailed in the
Officer's short report:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"I kept close along the beach all day,
<span class="a">landed</span> three times; first near the Creek
where the '<i>Ariel's</i>' boat [first] landed. Saw no
indications there of Europeans. I landed again some distance
further on, where I saw a <span class="a">native camp</span> and
a <span class="a">canoe</span>. In the latter I found a leathern
pistol-holster, marked 34, which Jackey recognised as belonging
to the party. Three <span class="u">natives</span> were seen by
Jackey, who, on perceiving the boat, ran into the bush. At the
third place I landed I saw no indication of men. I was close to
the beach all along, and occasionally fired a
musket."</blockquote>
<p>The holster found in the canoe could only have been one
belonging to the unfortunate <span class="a">Costigan, Dunn and
Luff party</span>, but whether they died a natural death or were
killed by the natives can never be known.</p>
<p>The "<i>Freak</i>" was anchored about a mile from the shore,
at a place from which the <span class="a">Hannibal Islands</span>
bore SE. by E.&frac12;E., when she took the boat's crew on board
at 8 p.m. <span class="a">Risk Point</span> lay S.&frac12;E. Risk
Point is thus shown to be the not very prominent cape north of
Captain Billy's Creek, where my party came down to the beach on
9th March, 1880, near Camp 56. As related elsewhere, we travelled
that day northward along the beach to Camp 57, where the natives
gave us a <i>camisade</i>.</p>
<p>While waiting for the boat, the men on the "<i>Freak</i>" saw
a <span class="a">canoe</span> and five <span class=
"a">natives</span> on the beach. Early next morning (6<i>th
May</i>), the boat, manned as before, started to continue the
exploration of the beach northward, <span class=
"a">landing</span> first where the canoe and natives had been
seen. In the evening, the boat was picked up at <span class=
"a">Tern Island</span>, near the mouth of the <span class=
"a">Escape River</span>, having covered 48 miles, and the Officer
reported:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"I ran along close to the shore all
day. I <span class="a">landed</span> a little to the southward of
<span class="a">Orford Ness</span>. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> We met about thirty <span class=
"a">natives</span> on the beach, who came up to us without
hesitation, and appeared very friendly; they shook hands with all
of us, and brought us water. Jackey at first thought he
recognised the native who escaped from the '<i>Ariel</i>' among
them; he got a little excited and wanted to shoot him; when he
approached nearer he was satisfied he was not the same
individual. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> At another place
where I landed I found part of the lower mast of a vessel about
400 tons, and pieces of <span class="a">wreck</span>; saw no
natives or indication of them on the beach."</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) Near the <span class="a">real "Pudding-Pan
Hill</span>," not the hill so named by Kennedy.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) The <span class="a">native</span> in question was
reported missing while the "<i>Ariel</i>" was at anchor on the
night of 11th January between Cape Bedford and Turtle Reef, near
Cooktown The night was dark and stormy and sharks were seen in
the morning. It is doubtful whether the native ever reached land,
and if he did there were about 400 miles to walk to Orford Ness,
through hostile tribes. Even supposing him to have escaped death
at sea he could hardly have covered the distance on foot in four
months, delayed as he must have been, by the necessity for
procuring food daily.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>Next day (7<i>th May</i>) Captain Simpson boarded the schooner
"<i>Coquette</i>" which was lying at anchor. The
"<i>Coquette</i>" <span class="a">Captain Elliott</span>, we
learn from the <i>Voyage of the "Rattlesnake</i>" had been sent
from Sydney to <span class="a">await</span> the arrival of
<span class="a">Kennedy's Expedition at Port Albany</span>, the
period for which the "<i>Ariel</i>" had been chartered for that
purpose having expired. She was, when the "<i>Freak</i>" came up
with her, trying to recover four anchors lost shortly before by
the ship "<i>Lord Auckland</i>" from Hobarton, when the latter
was aground on "X" Reef. Captain Elliott had heard from the
"<i>Sea Nymph</i>," from Hobart Town, of the fate of Kennedy's
expedition and was about to sail for Sydney. He had seen a
<span class="a">native</span> at Port Albany who had, apparently,
been <span class="a">wounded</span> in the <span class="a">face
with large shot</span>, and as he exactly answered the
description given by Jackey, there is little room for doubt that
he was the individual mentioned in the Statement of the latter as
having been wounded with buck-shot on 1st December, 1848.</p>
<p>Captain Elliott lent two men and himself joined Captain
Simpson's boating party which set out next morning (8th May) at
daylight. With this reinforcement, two boats were "manned, thus
making a most formidable party," says Captain Simpson.</p>
<p>At the mouth of the <span class="a">Escape River</span>, the
little bay west of Sharp Peak was pointed out by Jackey-Jackey as
the place where <span class="a">Kennedy</span> and he first met
<span class="a">hostile natives</span>. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>) The party
<span class="a">landed</span> about 12 miles up the inlet at the
first place where the left bank <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b>
was free of mangroves. This, Jackey-Jackey said, was <span class=
"a">where he advised Kennedy</span> on the day when he was killed
<span class="a">to leave the horses</span>, and swim the river,
here about 30 yards wide. Jackey pointed out the tree where he
<span class="a">tied the horses</span> while they searched
unsuccessfully for oysters, having had <span class="a">nothing to
eat</span> that day.</p>
<blockquote>[3) His right, as the Captain reckoned.]</blockquote>
<p>Three or four miles further up the stream, which had narrowed
considerably and was overhung with mangroves, the fresh water was
reached and a <span class="a">landing</span> was made at a clear
spot on the left or western bank. Near this was "an extensive
<span class="a">plain</span>, with numerous large ant-hills on
it, which <span class="a">jacket</span> knew as the place he had
<span class="a">crossed</span> the day Mr. Kennedy was
killed."</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"We walked," says Captain Simpson,
"some distance across a swamp, still following the course of the
creek. We traced the creek for nearly a mile, looking out for a
crossing place, when <span class="u">Jackey</span> pointed out on
the other side the place where he had <span class="u">secreted
the saddle-bags</span>. At length we came to a tree which had
fallen and formed a kind of bridge, over which we passed with
difficulty, and returned to the place where Jackey said the
saddle-bags were planted. Jackey then showed us the place where
'horse tumble down creek' after being speared. Some horse-dung
was found on the top of the bank close to this place, which
confirmed Jackey's statement. He then took us a few yards into
the scrub to look for the saddle-bags, and told us to look about
for a broken twig growing over a thick bush. The place was found,
but <span class="u">the saddle-bags were gone</span>. On
searching under the bush among the leaves, the horizon glass of a
sextant was found a strong proof that Jackey had hit upon the
right place.<br>
<br>
"Jackey then took us through a dense scrub for some distance,
when we came on open swampy ground about half a mile wide. On the
opposite side there was more scrub, close to which there were
three large ant-hills. Jackey took us up to the centre one, five
yards from which poor <span class="u">Kennedy fell</span>.
Against this ant-hill Jackey placed him when he went after the
saddle-bags. Jackey told us to look about for broken <span class=
"u">spears</span>; some pieces were found. He then took us to a
place about sixty yards from the ant-hill, <span class="u">where
he put Mr. Kennedy</span>, who then told him not to carry him
far. About a quarter of a mile from this place, towards the
creek, Jackey pointed out a clear space of ground, near an angle
of a very small running stream of fresh water, close to three
young pandanus trees, as the place where the unfortunate
gentleman <span class="u">died</span>. Jackey had taken him here
to wash his wounds and stop the blood. It was here, when poor
Kennedy found he was dying, that he gave Jackey instructions
about the <span class="u">papers</span>, when Jackey said, 'Why
do you talk so: You are not going to leave me?'<br>
<br>
"<span class="u">Jackey</span> then led the way to a dense
tree-tea scrub, distant about three or four hundred yards, where
he had <span class="u">carried the body and buried it</span>.
When we came to the edge of the scrub, Jackey was at a loss where
to enter, as he said when he was carrying the corpse he did not
look behind&mdash;all the objects in front being nearly alike he
did not get a good mark. Into the midst of the scrub we went,
divided ourselves and searched in every direction, but
<span class="u">could not find the place</span>. Jackey had not
made the spot too conspicuous; fearing the blacks might find it,
he had only bent down two twigs across each other. The scrub was
not very extensive but exceedingly thick. I placed the party
(eleven in number) five yards asunder and traversed it this way
in all directions, but without success. I then took Jackey to the
plain where the poor gentleman died, and told him to go towards
the scrub in the same manner he did when he was carrying the
corpse, and not to look back, which he did, telling me the manner
in which he carried it and where he shifted it from one shoulder
to another. In this manner he entered the scrub, and I have no
doubt he took us very near the exact place where the body was
buried. We sounded the ground all round with our ramrods, but
without success. After taking another good look we reluctantly
gave up the search, as the night was rapidly approaching, and
returned to the boats."</blockquote>
<p>Near the scrub where Kennedy was buried, the party searched
for, and found, a prismatic <span class="a">compass</span> which
Jackey-Jackey told them he had left there. In another place he
had left a sextant, which was not found. The trough of an
<span class="a">artificial horizon</span> and a bottle of
<span class="a">quicksilver</span> were, however, found near the
spot where the sextant had been left.</p>
<p>Captain Simpson was of opinion that Kennedy's body had not
been exhumed and that the small mound must have been levelled by
rains. As for Jackey-Jackey's idea that the moleskin rag found in
the canoe (see Dr. Vallack's Statement, 25th December, 1848) was
the one he had bound round Kennedy's head, he admitted that the
saddle-bags which the natives certainly carried away, contained
trousers exactly similar to those from which he tore the
rag."</p>
<p>Jackey-Jackey," adds Captain Simpson, "was very quiet, but
felt, and felt deeply, during the day. When pointing out the spot
where Mr. Kennedy died, I saw tears in his eyes, and no one could
be more indefatigable in searching for the remains. His feelings
against the natives were bitter, and had any of them made their
appearance at the time, I could hardly have prevented him from
shooting them."</p>
<p>The party regained the boat, got clear of the intricate
navigation of the inlet before dark and <span class=
"a">camped</span> on the beach near <span class="a">Point
Shadwell</span> at 11 p.m.</p>
<p>At daybreak on 9<i>th May</i>, they rowed to the beach of the
inlet west of <span class="a">Sharp Point</span>, where some
natives had been seen launching a canoe the previous morning.
They found only a <span class="a">canoe</span> and a <span class=
"a">Camp</span> which the natives had abandoned. One of Jackey's
aboriginal comrades got a glimpse of a native disappearing into
the bush. In the camp was a small piece of red <span class=
"a">cloth</span> identified by Jackey as part of Kennedy's cloak,
and a piece of painted <span class="a">canvas</span>. The canoe
was destroyed.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">boats rejoined the ship</span> at 10
<i>a.m</i>. At half-past twelve, the "<i>Freak</i>" and
"<i>Coquette</i>" <span class="a">left the Escape River</span>,
to anchor at night on the north side of <span class="a">Albany
Island</span>.</p>
<p>On 11<i>th May</i>, Jackey-Jackey and his two aboriginal
companions were taken in the whaleboat by Mr. Macnate, Chief
Officer of the "<i>Freak</i>" up <span class="a">Kennedy
Inlet</span> for an estimated distance of 11 miles and landed at
a point where the channel had narrowed to 40 feet. From this
spot, Jackey-Jackey led across country for about 2 miles straight
to the place where he had secreted the <span class=
"a">papers</span> entrusted to him by Kennedy on 5th December,
1848. The papers had been taken out of the hollow log in which
they had been hidden, and had been saturated with water and much
damaged. They consisted of a <span class="a">roll of
charts</span> and some <span class="a">memorandum books</span>,
including one in which Jackey-Jackey had drawn sketches.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) Captain Simpson, on 15th May, 1849, wrote a
letter to Captain Owen Stanley, R.N., Commander of H.M.S.
"Rattlesnake," which was communicated by the latter to the
Secretary of the <i>Royal Geographical Society</i>, and read at a
meeting of the Society on 27th January, 1851:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"A river which runs into the centre of Newcastle Bay was next
examined, and the place found where Jackey had concealed the
<span class="a">small papers</span> in a hollow log, but a rat or
some animal had pulled them out where they had been exposed to
the weather, and were quite saturated with water. They consisted
of a <span class="a">roll of charts, on which his track was laid
down</span>; these, with care, may possibly be deciphered: I am
sure if you had them you could do it. There were some
<span class="a">memorandum books</span>, much defaced, and also a
<span class="a">time book</span>. I have sent everything
carefully packed, to Sydney." It is evident that Captain Simpson
was of opinion that the roll of charts on which Kennedy's
<i>route</i> was laid down was, though damaged, not incapable of
being deciphered if placed in competent hands.]</blockquote>
<p><span class="a">A pair of compasses</span> which Jackey-Jackey
expected to find was missing. The blacks probably carried away
the compasses, which would make excellent barbs for spears, and
left the papers, for which they had no use. Captain Simpson
observed in his report that he feared the papers were "nearly
destroyed," but thought the charts might be deciphered, with
care. This was, apparently, never done, though the charts were
carefully packed and sent to Sydney.</p>
<p>It is evident that the memorandum books and time book referred
to in the letter quoted in the footnote were distinct from the
"big ones," to which Kennedy attached supreme importance, and
which probably contained his full journal.</p>
<p><span class="a">Where are the charts and books</span>? Unless
they can be recovered, we now know all that can ever be known of
the gallant but unfortunate Kennedy.</p>

<h5>(SEE <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>)</h5>
<p>I<small>T</small> now becomes necessary to resume the
consideration of <span class="a">Carron's Narrative</span>, for
his account of the party left under his charge on the 13th
November, 1848, when Kennedy set out on his ill-fated journey to
Cape York to obtain relief.</p>
<p>The party camped near the mouth of the Pascoe consisted of
eight individuals, [<i>viz.</i>], <span class="a">Carron, Wall,
Niblet, Taylor, Carpenter, Goddard, Mitchell</span> and
<span class="a">Douglas</span>. They had been told by Kennedy
that in the most favourable circumstances they might expect
relief in fourteen days, but were instructed to make their
provisions last for six weeks. These <span class=
"a">provisions</span> consisted of 28 lb. of flour, &frac12; lb.
of tea, and two horses, which were to be killed for food as
required.</p>
<p>The men left behind were, as may well be believed, weak and
weary, and settled down in their last camp with "a sort of
sluggish indifference" and without the stimulus of hope.</p>
<p>One horse was killed on the 14th and the other on the 27th
November, and the last of the <span class="a">flour</span> was
<span class="a">finished</span> on the 4th December, and what
little horseflesh remained was almost unfit to eat. A midday
shade temperature of 110&deg; F. prevailed. The <span class=
"a">rains</span> set in on the 27th and continued for three days,
and the heat and humidity, together with the absence of salt,
made it difficult to preserve the meat, some of which was eaten
in a putrid condition. The men were now face to face with
<span class="a">starvation</span>, twenty-one days after they had
settled in camp. The flour had been consumed at the rate of less
than a quarter of a pound per man per day, so that evidently an
economical regimen had been submitted to.</p>
<p><span class="a">Douglas died</span> on the 16th and
<span class="a">Taylor</span> on the 20th November, and they were
buried side by side. <span class="a">Carpenter</span> died on the
26th and was buried in the bed of the creek, the survivors being
too weak to carry the body to the resting-place of his
companions. In all three cases, however, Carron read the burial
service. Carron says that Carpenter "did not suffer very acutely
on the approach of death, but the animal energies were destroyed,
and they withered away one after another, without pain or
struggle."</p>
<p>The stores of the party included a fair amount of ammunition,
but it had to be used with economy in view of the requirements of
defence. There were plenty of fish-hooks, but the eager anglers
never got so much as a bite. A small bag of shell-fish was
brought up from the beach by Carron and Goddard on the 4th
December, and another on the 7th by Carron and Mitchell, but
after the latter date none of the party had sufficient strength
for such work. A few small pigeons, a heron and a small wallaby
fell to the guns, up to the 29th December, but these were far
below the food requirements of the men. The kangaroo dog was
killed on the 21st December and furnished two days' food for the
survivors, then four in number. The sheep-dog was only saved from
the same fate by the arrival of the rescue party.</p>
<p>There was at first a disposition to <span class="a">trust to
the natives for food</span>. The men were afraid to leave the
camp and for the most part were unable to go far from it. Some
natives came to the camp, on the 16th November, bringing "a few
small pieces of fish, old and hardly eatable." Two days later
they returned, this time with women, and "brought some fish, but
it was such as they would not eat themselves; also a kind of
paste, made of different kinds of leaves and roots, mixed with
the inside of the roasted mangrove seeds, all pounded up
together, then heated over a fire in a large shell. Although we
did not much like the taste of the paste, and it was very full of
sand, we ate some of it as a vegetable."</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the visits of the natives under a
pretence of offering food, which was always in such quantities
and of such a quality as to suggest a spirit of mockery, were
prompted by a desire to spy on the camp and ascertain the
defensive capacity of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>On 19<i>th November</i> <span class="a">fifty or sixty armed
men</span> came up and made a <span class="a">hostile
demonstration</span>, but retired on a show of resistance being
made. This being Sunday, prayers were read as usual.</p>
<p>On 21<i>st November</i> (the day after the second death in the
party)</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"about <span class="u">sixty
natives</span>," as Carron relates, "came to the camp, well armed
with spears, and pieces of fish, which they held up to us, to
entice us to come to them. We took no notice, however, of their
invitations, but preparing our firearms, we turned out. They were
now <span class="u">closing round</span> us in all directions,
many of them with their spears in their throwing-sticks, ready
for use&mdash;pointing them to their own necks and sides, and
showing us by their postures how we should writhe with pain when
they struck us. Then they would change their tactics and again
endeavour to persuade us that they meant us no harm, but they
would not lay down their spears. Some of them seemed inclined to
go away, but others appeared determined to attack us. After
keeping us standing for about an hour, <span class="u">eleven
spears</span> were <span class="u">thrown at us</span>. Three of
my party then fired, slightly wounding one of them, when they all
immediately ran away as fast as they could. Some of them,
however, remained hovering in sight for some time after. Three of
the spears that were thrown fell short of us, the rest passing
very close, but fortunately no one was hurt. The three spears
which passed us were barbed with bone, and were very
heavy."</blockquote>
<p>On 26<i>th November</i> (the day of the third man's death),
the <span class="a">natives returned</span>, bringing a few small
fish, and leaving their spears at a distance. Apprehensive of a
trap, however, the besieged refused to accept the fish. It is
noteworthy that the two visits in force occurred each time after
the death of one of the party, of which the hovering natives were
evidently aware.</p>
<p>By the end of November the distress of the survivors reached
such a pitch that they ate the hide of the last horse. The hide
of the horse killed previously had been given to the dogs.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">lowest depths of misery</span> were
sounded by the unhappy men on the 2nd December, the day after
Kennedy's death. H.M.S. "<i>Bramble</i>" had been seen on the
previous day sailing southward, having waited at Cape York till
the limit of time specified in her instructions had been exceeded
and she was relieved by the "<i>Ariel</i>." Still on the look out
for Kennedy's expedition, the "<i>Bramble</i>" actually lowered a
boat the following morning, as if with intent to land a party.
Failing, however, to see the signals made by the men on shore,
the schooner <span class="a">continued on her southward
voyage</span>, and the sufferers were apparently left to their
fate. The events of these two days are best related in Carron's
own tragic words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"1<i>st December</i>. The wind was
blowing strong from the south-east this morning. On going up the
hill in the afternoon, I saw a schooner from the northward
beating to the southward. I supposed her to be the
"<i>Bramble</i>" as it was about the time Mr. Kennedy had given
me expectation of being relieved by water, and I afterwards found
I was right in this supposition.<br>
<br>
"I naturally concluded she had come for us; and full of hope and
joy I immediately hoisted a <span class="u">flag</span> on a
staff we had previously erected on a part of the hill where it
could be seen from any part of the bay. We placed a ball above
the flag to put the crew on their guard against the natives. We
then collected a quantity of wood, and at dusk lighted a
<span class="u">fire</span>, and kept it burning till about
half-past seven or eight o'clock. I then fired off three
<span class="u">rockets</span> one after the other, at intervals
of about twenty minutes. I also took a large <span class=
"u">pistol</span> up the hill, and stood for some time firing it
as quickly as I could load it, thinking they might perhaps see
the flash of that, if they had not seen the rockets.<br>
<br>
"2<i>nd December</i>. Early this morning I was up, straining my
eyes to catch a view of the bay, and at length saw the schooner
standing in to the shore, and during the forenoon a <span class=
"u">boat</span> was <span class="u">lowered</span>. I now made
quite certain they were coming for us, and thinking they might
come up the creek in the boat for some distance, I hastened down
the hill and began to pack up a few things, determined to keep
them waiting for our luggage no longer than I could help. I
looked anxiously for them all the afternoon, wondering much at
their delay in coming, until at last I went up the hill, just in
time to see the <span class="u">schooner passing the bay</span>.
I cannot describe the feeling of despair and desolation which I,
in common with the rest of our party, experienced as we gazed on
the vessel as she fast faded from our view. On the very
<span class="u">brink of starvation and death</span> death in the
lone wilderness, peopled only with the savage denizens of the
forest, who even then were thirsting for our blood <span class=
"u">hope</span>, sure and certain hope, had for one brief moment
gladdened our hearts with the consoling assurance that, after our
many trials and protracted sufferings, we were again about to
find comfort and safety. But the bright expectancy <span class=
"u">faded</span>; and although we strove to persuade ourselves
that the vessel was not the '<i>Bramble</i>' our hearts sunk
within us in deep despondency."</blockquote>
<p>The remainder of the story of the camp cannot be better told
than in Carron's own words, on which it is impossible to improve,
and which I only abridge in a few places where incidents have
already been related.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"9<i>th December</i>. The <span class=
"u">natives</span> visited us this morning and brought with them
a few pieces of turtle's entrails and a few nondas. I gave them
an old shirt and a knife, the latter being highly prized by them.
<span class="u">Goddard</span> had a fit of <span class=
"u">ague</span> to-day, followed by <span class=
"u">fever</span>.<br>
<br>
"10<i>th December</i>. We all of us had fits of <span class=
"u">ague</span> this morning, and none of us could get up till
the afternoon, when, being Sunday, I read prayers.<br>
<br>
"11<i>th December</i>. The <span class="u">natives</span> came
this morning, and brought us a little vegetable paste, and some
pieces of turtle's entrails, with some shark's liver. The latter
was fresh, but one could not eat it, as it all melted into a
yellowish oil when boiled for a few minutes. I gave them a few
fish-hooks, but found it very difficult to get them to leave the
camp.<br>
<br>
"13<i>th December</i>. This morning <span class=
"u">Mitchell</span> was found <span class="u">dead</span> by the
side of the creek, with his feet in the water. He must have gone
down at night to get water, but too much exhausted to perform his
task, had sat down and died there. None of us being strong enough
to dig a grave for him, we sewed the body in a blanket, with a
few stones to sink it, and then put it into the brackish
water.<br>
<br>
"15<i>th December</i>. The thermometer fell this morning and was
broken. It was raining heavily all day, and two bags of my seeds
and several other little things were washed out of the tent by
the water which ran down the hill. We were all very ill and
weak.<br>
<br>
"16<i>th December</i>. It was raining this morning, and we
remained in the tent. Hearing one of our dogs barking, however, I
went out and saw several <span class="u">natives</span> with
pieces of fish and turtle, which I took from them, when they left
us. The natives also brought us some roasted <i>nymph&aelig;a</i>
roots, which they call 'dillii.'<br>
<br>
"During the last few days we shot seven pigeons. Wall and Goddard
used to go into the scrub and sit beneath a tree, to which they
used to come for berries to feed their young, and, watching their
opportunity, shoot them.<br>
<br>
"21<i>st December</i>. Our <span class="u">kangaroo dog</span>
being very weak, and unable to catch anything, we <span class=
"a">killed</span> and lived on him for two days. There was very
little flesh on his bones, but our dried meat was so bad that we
very much enjoyed the remains of our old companion, and drank the
water in which we boiled him.<br>
<br>
"24<i>th December</i>. The <span class="u">natives</span> took a
tin case from Wall whilst he was talking to them, he not being
able to resist them. My legs had swelled very much, and I was
able to walk but a very short distance.<br>
<br>
"26<i>th December</i>. The <span class="u">natives</span> brought
in a few pieces of fish and turtle, but both were almost rotten.
They also gave us a blue-tongued lizard, which I opened, and took
out eleven young ones, which we roasted and ate. There was
nothing but scales on the old one, except in its tail.<br>
<br>
"We always divided whatever we got from the natives, be it what
it might; but they brought us very little that was eatable. I
could easily perceive that their pretended good feeling towards
us was assumed for the sake of fulfilling their own designs upon
us. Although they tried to make us believe they were doing all in
their power to benefit us, <span class="u">their object</span>
was to obtain an opportunity of coming upon us by surprise and
<span class="u">destroying</span> us. They had at many times seen
the fatal effect of our firearms, and I believe that it was only
the dread of these that prevented them from falling upon us at
once and murdering us . . . It would be almost impossible for any
class of men to excel these fellows in the scheming and versatile
<span class="u">cunning</span> with which they strove to
<span class="u">disguise their meditated treachery</span>. In
fine weather I always had our firearms standing out for them to
see, and once or twice every night I fired off a pistol to let
them know we were on the look out by night as well as by day.<br>
<br>
"28<i>th December</i>. <span class="u">Niblet and Wall</span>
both <span class="u">died</span> this morning. Niblet was quite
dead when I got up, and Wall, though alive, was unable to speak.
They were neither of them up the day previous. I had been talking
with them both, endeavouring to encourage them to hope on to the
last; but sickness, privation and fatigue had overcome them, and
they abandoned themselves to a calm and listless despair. We had
got two pigeons the day before, which in the evening were boiled
and divided between us, as well as the water they were boiled in.
Niblet had eaten his pigeon and drank the water, but Wall had
only drunk the water and eaten part of his half pigeon.<br>
<br>
"About eleven o'clock as many as <span class="u">fifty
natives</span>, armed with spears, and some of them painted with
a yellowish earth, made their appearance in the vicinity of our
camp. There were natives of several <span class="u">strange
tribes</span> amongst them. They were well aware that neither
Niblet nor Wall was able to resist them, if they did not know
they were dead. They also knew that we were very weak, although I
always endeavoured as much as possible to keep that fact from
them. This morning, when I made signs to them to lay down their
spears, they paid no attention, with the exception of two, who
had been in the habit of coming very frequently to the camp.
These two came running up quite close to us, without their
spears, and endeavoured to persuade one of us to go across a
small dry creek for a fish which another of the rascals was
holding up to tempt us. They tried various methods to draw our
attention from the rest, who were trailing their spears along the
ground with their feet, closing gradually round us, and running
from tree to tree, to hide their spears behind them. Others lay
on their backs on the long grass, and were working their way
towards us, unnoticed as they supposed. <span class="u">Goddard
and myself</span> stood with our guns in readiness and our
pistols by our sides for about two hours, when I fell from
excessive weakness. When I got up we thought it best to send them
away at once, or stand our chance of being speared in the
attempt, both of us being unable to stand any longer. We
presented our guns at the two by our side, making signs to them
to send the others away, or we would shoot them immediately. This
they did, and they ran off in all directions, without a spear
being thrown or a shot fired.<br>
<br>
"As the evening came on, there came with it the painful task of
removing the bodies of our unfortunate companions who had died in
the morning. We had not strength to make the smallest hole in the
ground as a grave; but after great exertion we succeeded in
removing the bodies to a small patch of phyllanthus scrub, about
four feet high, and eighty yards from the tent. We then laid them
side by side and covered them with a few small branches; and this
was all the burial we were enabled to give them.<br>
<br>
"29<i>th December</i>. Goddard went into the scrub and shot three
pigeons. We ate one at night, and the others we reserved till
next day. Our bowels were greatly relaxed, which was partly
stayed by eating a few nondas, which we got occasionally.<br>
<br>
"The six weeks having expired which Mr. Kennedy had led me to
expect would be the longest period we should have to wait, I now
began to fear the rainy season had set in, and filled the creeks
to the northward, so that his party had been unable to cross
them, or that some untoward accident had happened, which
prevented us being relieved.<br>
<br>
"I did not quite despair, but I knew we <span class="u">could not
live long. our shot was almost consumed</span>, not having more
than eight or ten charges left, and although we had plenty of
ball, we were too weak to attempt to form any plan to make shot.
Our sole remaining companion, the sheep-dog, I intended to kill
in a day or two; but he would not last long, as he was nothing
but skin and bone.<br>
<br>
"30<i>th December</i>. Early this morning we ate the two pigeons
left yesterday and boiled each a quart of tea from the leaves we
had left; but we had not had any fresh tea to put into the pot
for a long time. Goddard then went into the bush, to try to get
another pigeon or two, and if the natives made their appearance I
was to fire a pistol to recall him to the camp. After he had gone
I saw <span class="u">natives</span> coming towards the camp, and
I immediately fired a pistol; but before Goddard could return
they came into the camp and handed me a piece of paper very much
dirtied and torn. I was sure, from the first, by their manner,
that there was <span class="u">a vessel in the bay</span>. The
paper was a <span class="u">note from Captain Dobson</span>, of
the schooner '<i>Ariel</i>,' but it was so dirtied and torn that
I could only read part of it.<br>
<br>
"For a minute or two I was almost senseless with the joy which
the hope of our deliverance inspired. I made the natives a few
presents, and gave them a note to Captain Dobson, which I made
them easily understand I wanted them to take to that gentleman. I
was in hopes they would have gone, but I soon found they had
other intentions. A great many <span class="u">natives</span>
were coming from all quarters well <span class="u">armed with
spears</span>. I had given a shirt to the one who had brought the
note and put it on him; but I saw him throw down the note and
pull off the shirt, and picking up his spear he joined the rest,
who were preparing to attack us. We were expecting every minute
to be attacked and murdered by these savages, our newly awakened
hope already beginning to fail, when we <span class="u">saw
Captain Dobson</span> and <span class="u">Dr. Vallack</span>,
accompanied by <span class="u">Jackey</span> and a man named
<span class="u">Barrett</span> (who had been wounded a few days
before in the arm by a barbed spear), approaching towards us,
across the creek. I and my companion, who was preserved with me,
must ever be grateful for the prompt courage with which these
persons, at the risk of their own lives, came to our assistance,
through the scrub and mangroves, a distance of about three miles,
surrounded as they were all the way by a large number of armed
natives."</blockquote>
<p>The <span class="a">strange conduct of the natives</span> in
first bringing Captain Dobson's letter and then refusing to carry
the answer was probably caused by an imperfect comprehension of
the means of communication. In any case, they, no doubt, thought
the Captain's letter would furnish one more <span class=
"a">pretext for a visit to the camp</span>. Understanding, from
the directions accompanying the reply, that the besieged knew
that relief was coming, they prepared to <span class=
"a">annihilate the survivors</span> before they could be
reinforced by the addition of the new-comers. <span class=
"a">Carron's Narrative</span> approaches the end:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"<span class="u">I was reduced almost
to a skeleton</span>. The elbow bone of my right arm was through
the skin, as also the bone of my right hip. My legs were also
swollen to an enormous size. <span class="u">Goddard walked to
the boat</span>, but <span class="u">I could not do</span> so
without the assistance of Captain Dobson and Dr. Vallack, and I
had to be carried altogether a part of the distance. The others,
Jackey and Barrett, kept a look out for the blacks.<br>
<br>
"We were <span class="u">unable to bring many things</span> from
the camp. The principal were the firearms and one parcel of my
seeds, which I managed to keep dry, containing eighty-seven
species. All my specimens were left behind, which I regretted,
for, though much injured, the collection contained specimens of
very beautiful trees, shrubs, and orchide&aelig;. I could also
only secure an <span class="u">abstract of my journal</span>,
except that portion of it from 13th November to 30th December,
which I have in full. <span class="u">my original journal</span>,
with a botanical work which had been kindly lent me by a friend
in Sydney for the expedition, <span class="u">was left
behind</span>. We got safely on board the '<i>Ariel</i>' and,
after a very long passage, arrived in <span class=
"u">Sydney</span>.<br>
<br>
"I am confident that no man could have done more for the safety
of the party than was done by <span class="u">Mr. Kennedy</span>,
nor could any man have exerted himself more than he in the
distressing circumstances of our perilous journey. He walked by
far the greater part of the distance, giving his one horse for
the use of the weak men and the general use of the expedition. I
never rode but two hours all through the journey, and that was on
two successive days when we were in the vicinity of Cape Sidmouth
and I was suffering from bad feet.<br>
<br>
"The unfortunate <span class="u">death of our</span> brave and
generous <span class="u">leader</span>, deeply and extensively as
I know it to have been lamented, can have no more sincere mourner
than myself.<br>
<br>
"The tale of his sufferings and those of his party has already
been read and sympathised over by hundreds, and it would ill
become me to add anything to the artless narrative of the
faithful and true-hearted <span class="u">Jackey</span>, who
having tended his last moments and closed his eyes, was the
first, and perhaps the most disinterested, bewailer of his
unhappy fate."</blockquote>
<p>It may be remarked that Carron's narrative gives very few
geological notes. Probably if Kennedy's diary had been preserved
it would have added much to our geological knowledge.
<span class="a">Captain Dobson</span> concludes his brief
"Statement" by saying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"We then pursued our way to Weymouth
Bay and <span class="u">rescued Mr. Carron and Goddard</span>. We
brought with us what <span class="u">instruments</span> we could
from the camp&mdash;they were not many, as Mr. Carron was hardly
in a state to tell me what was there. I should have returned to
the camp at Weymouth Bay to save everything, but for the
<span class="u">hostility of the natives</span>, who surrounded
us in great numbers, and, as soon as we had left the camp, rifled
it."</blockquote>
<p>Some further particulars of the closing scene of the tragedy
are given by <span class="a">Dr. Vallack</span>.</p>
<p>On 29<i>th December</i>, 1848, the "<i>Ariel</i>" anchored in
Weymouth Bay. The afternoon was wet and squally, and the day was
too far spent for a landing party to reach Carron's Camp and
return to the schooner. An anxious look out for a flagstaff or
signals, of which nothing was seen, led to a gloomy foreboding
that all had been lost.</p>
<p>At daylight, next morning, the 30th, the "<i>Ariel</i>"
shifted to a distance of about half a mile from the land. No
sooner had she dropped anchor than <span class="a">five
canoes</span> were seen, paddling towards them from among the
mangroves, five to ten natives in each. From the foremost canoe
came shouts of "ferraman" and "white man" and the natives pointed
towards the hill which had already been indicated by Jackey.
Doubts as to the reality of the friendliness of the natives were
allayed by the presence of some women and children in the canoes.
<span class="a">Captain Dobson</span> wrote a <span class=
"a">note to Carron</span>, which was given to one of the natives,
who was instructed by gestures to take it to the camp. A boat
followed the canoes and <span class="a">Captain Dobson, Barrett,
Dr. Vallack</span> and <span class="a">Jackey-Jackey
landed</span> among the mangroves. Having at length cleared the
swamp, the party followed up a creek, for about 2 miles, when
Jackey-Jackey exclaimed, "See, two white fellows sit down and
camp." The <span class="a">natives</span>, who had been
"<span class="a">demonstrating</span>," must have <span class=
"a">withdrawn</span> on the approach of the boat party. "On the
other side of the hill," says Dr. Vallack, "not two hundred yards
from us, were <span class="a">two men</span> sitting down,
looking towards us, the tent and fire immediately behind them;
and on coming up to them, two of the most pitiable creatures
imaginable were sitting down. One had sufficient strength to get
up; the other appeared to be like a man in the very last stage of
consumption. Alas! alas! they were <span class="a">the only two
left</span> of the eight, the remainder having died from
starvation."</p>
<p>Dr. Vallack continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Whilst here we were considering what
was best to be done, when <span class="u">natives</span> in great
numbers were descried watching our movements. Jackey said,
"Doctor," calling me aside, "now I tell you exactly what to do.
You see these black fellows over there" (and in pointing to them
I saw a great number, some 800 yards away, peeping from behind
trees), "you leave him tent, everything, altogether, there, and
get the two white fellows down to the boat quick." Jackey was
exceedingly energetic, and grave as well. "Get away as quick as
possible" was resounded by all, but what was to be done? Two
<span class="u">men almost dead</span> to walk 2 or 3 miles! We
looked over the tent, asked Carron for what important things
there were, and each laid hold of what appeared to be of most
value, the Captain taking two sextants, other parties, firearms,
etc., etc. "Come along," again and again Jackey called out, and
the Captain too, whilst they were half-way down the creek, and
Barrett and I loaded ourselves. I took a case of seeds, some
<span class="u">papers of Carron's</span>, a double gun and
pistols, which, together with my own double gun and brace of
pistols, thermometer <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and my
pockets full of powder and shot, was as much as I could manage.
Seeing <span class="u">Carron could not get along</span>, I told
him to put his hands on my shoulders, and in this way he managed
to walk down, as far or nearly through the mangrove swamp,
towards the water's edge, when he could not in that way get any
further, and <span class="u">Barrett</span>, with his disabled
arm, <span class="u">carried him</span> down to the edge of the
water. <span class="u">Goddard</span>, the other survivor, who
was <span class="u">just able to walk</span> down, spoke and
looked exceedingly feeble. They were brought on board at noon,
and attended to according to my instructions. Carron's legs were
dreadfully swollen, about three times their natural size, from
oedema. In the afternoon both reviving and thanking God for their
deliverance. I was for some time afraid of Carron. At 10 p.m.,
they are both doing well, and I trust will be enabled to tell us
their tale, which will render it unnecessary for me to write it
down here. I told the Captain to proceed direct on to Sydney,
Jackey, Carron and Goddard and the Captain stating it would be
running too great a risk to go to recover anything from the tent.
Moreover, with so small a party as the Captain, Jackey and myself
(<span class="u">Barrett</span> really being <span class=
"u">unfit</span> to go, and the <span class="u">sailors</span>
all <span class="u">refusing</span> to go), I consider the
Captain deserves considerable credit for his action throughout in
exerting himself to rescue the survivors."</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>[1) The broken one.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<p>The "<i>Ariel</i>" accordingly <span class="a">left Weymouth
Bay</span> on the following day, 31<i>st December</i>, 1848, and
reached <span class="a">Sydney</span> on 5<i>th March</i>, 1849.
The tidings of the disastrous conclusion of Kennedy's expedition
having reached Sydney, the brig "<i>Freak</i>" as already stated,
was chartered by the Government of New South Wales to make a
<span class="a">further search</span> for Kennedy's papers and
for traces of the parties left at Kennedy's so-called
"Pudding-Pan Hill" and the Pascoe. An account of the discovery of
a few of <span class="a">Kennedy's papers</span> between the
Escape River, where he died, and Cape <span class=
"a">York</span>, and of the unsuccessful attempt to reach the
scene of the <span class="a">death of the three men at
"Pudding-Pan Hill"</span> has already been given.</p>
<p>The "<i>Freak's</i>" whaleboat, on 3<i>rd May</i>, 1849,
landed in <span class="a">Weymouth Bay</span> a party which
included <span class="a">Captain Simpson</span> of the
"<i>Freak,</i>" <span class="a">Captain Sampson</span> of the
"<i>Harbinger</i>" (who volunteered), <span class=
"a">Jackey-Jackey</span> and two of his aboriginal comrades. The
landing and the overhaul of <span class="a">Carron's camp</span>
were made under very difficult circumstances owing to torrential
rain and the threatening aspect of the natives. At the
landing-place were found part of a <span class=
"a">blanket</span>, part of a <span class="a">tarpaulin</span>, a
piece of <span class="a">canvas</span> and a small <span class=
"a">tin dish</span>. Three outrigger <span class=
"a">canoes</span> were also met with and in these some pieces of
<span class="a">iron</span> were observed. These articles,
Captain Simpson concluded, came from the <span class=
"a">pillage</span> of Carron's last camp. A tree was found with
the carved letters "K. LXXX." This, Jackey-Jackey said, was the
camp of the 11th November, 1848 (the last but one). This would
indicate that it was <span class="a">Kennedy's 80th
camp</span>.</p>
<p>Of the <span class="a">last camp</span>, to which <span class=
"a">Carron's party</span> removed on the 13th November, the day
on which Kennedy left for Cape York, Captain Simpson
writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"This spot was strewed with portions
of <span class="u">books</span>, all of a religious or scientific
character. Found <span class="u">no manuscripts</span>. Parts of
harness, leather belts, pieces of cedar boxes in leather covers,
were also found; one or two tins for carrying water, a camp stool
and part of a table, and piece of a tent-pole; the bones, skull,
and part of the feathers of birds, etc.; <span class=
"a">specimens</span> of natural history, all <span class=
"u">destroyed</span>. I observed the bones of a <span class=
"u">horse</span> and the skull of a <span class="u">dog</span>. A
piece of torn calico with a portion of a <span class=
"u">chart</span> adhering to it was picked up; I thought I could
make out the words "River Mitchell" on it. I found, among the
pieces of books, a portion of Leichhardt's Journey Overland.<br>
<br>
"It was some time before I could find the remains of <span class=
"u">Wall and Niblet</span>, who were the last men that died, and
had not been buried, the survivors being too weak. I placed
myself at the camp and looked about for the likeliest place to
which a corpse would be taken under the circumstances. I went
down into a small gully, about sixty yards from the camp. Under
some small bushes, in about two feet of water, I found
<span class="u">their bones</span>, two skulls and some of the
larger bones, the smaller ones having most probably been washed
away by the flood. The bones were carefully collected and taken
on board. From the position in which these bones were found,
agreeing with the description given me by Mr. Carron, I feel
confident that they are the remains of Wall and
Niblet."</blockquote>
<p>The remains of Wall and Niblet were carried on by the
"<i>Freak</i>" to <span class="a">Albany Island</span>, where, on
the top of the highest hill at the southern end of the island,
they were <span class="a">interred</span> on the 13th May, 1849.
A tombstone was erected on the spot by Captain Owen Stanley, of
H.M.S. "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" who himself died in March, 1850.</p>
<p>There is abundant evidence that <span class="a">Carron's last
camp</span> was pitched, not on Simpson's Hill, at the mouth of
the Pascoe, but on Barrett's Hill, two or three miles to the
west, near the tributary of the Pascoe River, which the
expedition followed down on the 9th, 10th and 11th November,
1848. In this position, the camp, flagstaff and signals cannot
have been sufficiently conspicuous to attract attention from the
sea. Had it been placed on Simpson's Hill it must have been
visible from the "<i>Bramble</i>" when that ship sailed to the
south on the 3rd December, to the heartrending disappointment of
the despairing watchers on the land, and the lives of Mitchell,
Wall and Niblet would probably have been saved. It must not,
however, be forgotten that Carron's party did not know whether
relief was to come by land or sea, and therefore the position of
their last camp may have been the result of a compromise. It is
also impossible to say whether they judged the site chosen to
have strategical advantages for defence against the savages.
Lastly, it is only too likely that the weak and dispirited men
had not energy enough to look for a better site and move the
camp.</p>
<p>The touching narratives of the survivors and rescuers give a
very clear insight into <span class="a">Kennedy's
character</span>. Unquestionably brave, he was always
scrupulously fair and considerate towards his enemies. His plan
of operations had been most carefully thought out, but with its
cumber of carts and sheep it proved absolutely inapplicable to
the country to be traversed; it is not too much to say that the
plan would have been rejected with horror by any man knowing the
country, as I for one came to know it later, and as, of course,
Kennedy could not have conceived it when he set forth full of
confidence in the perfection of his arrangements. Nevertheless, a
more reasonable leader would have realised the impossibility of
the task under the conditions much earlier than Kennedy did, and
would have remodelled his equipment, as he did at last, after men
and horses had had all the heart worked out of them before the
journey could have been said to have begun. He and nine others
paid, in full measure, the penalty of an admirable perseverance
which had degenerated into obstinacy.</p>
<p>The persistence displayed by Kennedy, the inability to bow
before the forces of Nature and admit defeat, were closely allied
to the piety which distinguished him above other explorers. The
heartfelt prayers which ascended from his moving tents every
Sunday morning&mdash;sometimes under circumstances which would
have driven other men to work rather than to pray&mdash;were
persisted in to the very last, although they seem almost
invariably to have been followed by some new disaster. Kennedy
had the spirit which drew from Job in his agony the defiant cry:
"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him, but I will maintain
mine own ways." He was revered and loved by all who shared with
him the hardships of the terrible journey.</p>
<p align="center"><small>REQUIESCAT IN PACE!</small></p>
<p>A sufficient reason why no serious attempt has hitherto been
made to garner the geographical results of Kennedy's expedition
is to be found in the fact that the task was practically
impossible until the progress of settlement had brought with it
the production of land maps on which his course could be
traced.</p>
<p><span class="a">Carron and Wall</span> merit the highest
commendation for the fidelity with which they persisted in their
scientific duties, even when everything pointed to their efforts
being made in vain. Carron has furnished in his (which is the
only) record of the Kennedy expedition, a narrative as thrilling
as that of Daniel Defoe, and with the additional advantage of
being true in every line.</p>
<p>Perhaps, after all, the hero of the tale is the aboriginal
<span class="a">Jackey-Jackey</span>. The laurel wreath due to
the first explorer to reach Cape York by land would have been
justly placed on his black brow. The unavoidable limitations
imposed on him by his ancestry have already been pointed out,
but</p>
<div style="margin-left:25%; font-size:90%">"Though tawny was his
hide,<br>
  He was white, clear white, inside,"</div>
<br>
<p>and in courage, prudence, resourcefulness and loyalty he could
not have been surpassed by the whitest of men.</p>
<p>The "<i>Ariel</i>" arrived in <span class="a">Sydney</span> on
5<i>th March</i>, 1849. A reporter of the <i>Sydney Morning
Herald</i> at once interviewed the survivors of the expedition
and the officers of the schooner. The report gives an abstract of
Jackey-Jackey's narrative, as taken down by Dr. Vallack, and some
further particulars which account for a portion of the time spent
on the forlorn hope between the Pascoe and Cape York. These have
already been embodied in notes appended to Jackey-Jackey's
"Statement."</p>
<p>Jackey-Jackey now said that thirteen days elapsed between
<span class="a">Kennedy's death</span> and his own arrival at
Cape York. On a critical consideration of the statement, read in
the light of other evidence, I conclude that only ten out of the
eighteen days are accounted for. I have no doubt that
Jackey-Jackey crawled along in a dazed condition and was too far
gone to take an accurate account of time. He added that he had
taken three spears out of Kennedy's body. If the guns and powder
had not been damaged by the constant rain, he believed that
Kennedy would have got through.</p>
<p>An <span class="a">official investigation</span>, ordered by
the Attorney-General, was held on 6th March at the Water Police
Court by Captains Innes and Browne.</p>
<p><span class="a">Carron</span> put in his diary of the period
during which he was in charge of the party left at the mouth of
the Pascoe. The subsequently published booklet gives the
substance of the diary put into narrative form, together with the
previous part of the journey from Rockingham Bay to the Pascoe,
which was compiled from an abstract of his private diary.</p>
<p><span class="a">Goddard's</span> examination added nothing to
Carron's narrative, but he gave instances of Kennedy's
consideration for the subordinate members of his party.</p>
<p>Dr. <span class="a">Vallack</span> put in the Statement of
Jackey-Jackey which he had taken on board the "<i>Ariel</i>" and
gave an account of the voyage of the "<i>Ariel</i>" to Shelburne
Bay and Weymouth Bay, and the doings on shore in these
localities, but added practically nothing to the "Statement"
included in the booklet.</p>
<p>The evidence was handed to the Attorney-General, who submitted
it to the Government.</p>
<p>On 9th March, the Colonial Secretary, the Hon. E. Deas
Thomson, officially announced the fate of the expedition in the
Government Gazette. The announcement pays a high tribute to
Kennedy and Carron and generously recognises the devoted services
of Jackey-Jackey. It contains also the statement that "it is
hoped from the documents which have been preserved, a narrative
of the expedition may be compiled for publication at a future
date."</p>
<p>On 25th April, 1849, the Governor, Sir Charles Fitzroy,
transmitted the <span class="a">papers</span> relating to the
expedition to Earl Grey, who replied:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<span class="u">Downing

<p>On 17th July, 1849, on the motion of Mr. Darvall, a sum of
&pound;100 was placed on the Supplementary Estimates for the
erection of a <span class="u">memorial tablet</span> in St.
James' Church, Sydney. The vote was carried on a division by
twenty-one votes to four. In the course of the debate, the
Colonial Secretary (the Hon. E. Deas Thomson) said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"<span class="u">A narrative by one of
the survivors would shortly be published</span>, and advantage
had been taken of the departure of a vessel to Torres Straits to
send down Mr. Kennedy's faithful companion Jackey-Jackey, in the
hope of recovering the Journal of the former. The Journal had not
been found, but <span class="u">a case had been
discovered</span>, somewhat affected by damp, in which were many
<span class="u">valuable maps</span>, delineating the
<i>route</i> pursued by Mr. Kennedy and the general features of
the country through which he passed. <span class="u">These
documents</span>, he was happy to inform the House, <span class=

wanting, and would serve as a material guide to any person
attempting the same route."</blockquote>
<p>The principal objector was <span class="u">Mr. Robert
Lowe</span>, afterwards Lord Sherbrooke. His arguments were: (1),
that "the expedition was a most ill-advised one, and was
commenced by the Government on its own responsibility, without
consulting the Council"; and, (2), that the expense should be
defrayed by private subscription rather than be taken from the
public purse.</p>
<p>The mural tablet in St. James' Church is of white marble. A
bas-relief representing Kennedy lying under a palm tree and
supported by his faithful Squire, with armed savages in the
distance, is followed by the inscription:</p>

<p>A few biographical notes on Carron's career are furnished by
Mr. J.H.Maiden, C.M.G., in his "Records of Australian Botanists"
(<i>Journ. Roy. Soc., N.S. Wales,</i> XLII, 1908). Carron was
born in Norfolk, England, on 18th December, 1823, and arrived in
Sydney in 1843, in charge of plants for one of the Macleays. He
was a Licensed Surveyor when he joined Kennedy's expedition.
After the expedition he was engaged for some time in collecting
plants. [Documents in the Mitchell Library show that he was
appointed Sub-Collector of Customs at Eden, New South Wales, in
1856.&mdash;R.L.J.] He was on the staff of the Botanic Gardens,
Sydney, as a Collector, from 1st September, 1866, to 31st
December, 1875, when he left to take up the position of Forester
on the Clarence River. He died at Grafton on 25th February,
1876.</p>

<h4>&sect;1. FIRST NORTHERN CRUISE</h4>
<p>E<small>ARLY</small> in the year 1845, the Admiralty
determined to replace the "<i>Fly</i>" by the
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>," but his formal instructions were not handed
to the Commander, Captain <span class="a">Owen Stanley</span>,
until the eve of his departure from England, towards the close of
the following year.</p>
<p>It was intended that the "Rattlesnake" (28 guns) should be
accompanied by the "<i>Bramble</i>" under <span class=
"a">Lieutenant C.B. Yule</span>, and the "<i>Castlereagh</i>"
under Lieutenant Aird. A survey, however, proved the
"<i>Castlereagh</i>" to be unfit for the service, and she was
left behind. The complement of the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" when she
commenced her northern work, was 154 officers and men, and that
of the "<i>Bramble</i>" 36. A decked boat, named the "<i>Asp</i>"
followed the expedition, and appears when conducting independent
operations to have usually been in charge of <span class=
"a">Lieutenant Dayman. John MacGillivray</span> was Naturalist
and a younger naturalist was <span class="a">Thomas
Huxley</span>, who was destined to attain world-wide fame as a
biologist. Owing to the illness and death of the Commander of the
expedition, which took place before the work was completed, it is
not to his pen, but to MacGillivray's that we owe the narrative
of the voyage, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and from Huxley's
brush came the spirited drawings which illustrate the text.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Narrative of the Voyage of H.M.S.
"Rattlesnake," commanded by the late Captain Owen Stanley, R.N.,
F.R.S., etc., during the Years 1846-1850</i>. By John
MacGillivray, F.R.G.S., Naturalist to the Expedition. Published
under the Sanction of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.
London, 1852.]</blockquote>
<p>The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" left <span class="a">Plymouth</span>
on 11<i>th December</i>, 1846, and reached <span class=
"a">Sydney</span> on 16th July, 1847. On 11th October, she, with
the "<i>Bramble</i>" set out for Port Curtis and the north,
anchoring in <span class="a">Upstart Bay</span> (between the
sites of Bowen and Townsville, two towns not as yet founded) on
10<i>th December</i>, 1847. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-o">MAP O.</a>) They returned to <span class=
"a">Sydney</span> on 14<i>th January</i>, 1848.</p>
<h4>&sect;2. SECOND NORTHERN CRUISE</h4>
<p>The second northern cruise began at Sydney on 29th April,
1848. Up to that date, with the exception of Leichhardt's brief
appearance on the base of the triangular area of the Cape York
Peninsula, in 1845, the exploration of the Peninsula had
penetrated only in a few places for a few miles from the coast,
and had been entirely the work of maritime pioneers. The time had
now arrived for the opening up of the interior, and Kennedy's
ambitious scheme for an overland journey from Rockingham Bay to
Cape York was about to be carried out. The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>"
and "<i>Bramble</i>," therefore, had the honour of convoying the
barque "<i>Tam O'Shanter</i>," with <span class="a">Kennedy's
Expedition</span> on board, to <span class="a">Rockingham
Bay</span>, the scene of its initial operations. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-k">MAP K.</a>)</p>
<p>On 23<i>rd</i> and 24<i>th May</i>, 1848, the sailors assisted
Kennedy with the debarkation of his men, horses, sheep and
stores, and immediately thereafter began their own labours to
complete the survey of the <span class="a">Inner Passage</span>
to the north. It was arranged that the "<i>Bramble</i>" was to be
in <span class="a">Princess Charlotte Bay</span> during the first
week of August, to wait for Kennedy and to assist him in any way
possible. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP
E.</a>) We have already seen how Kennedy was unable to keep the
appointment, arrived only on 9th October, and did not think it
worth while to force his way through the mangroves and swamps of
the coastal plain to the bay, from which the "<i>Bramble</i>"
must long ago have sailed away. (<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-g">MAP G.</a>)</p>
<p>The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" was in <span class="a">Trinity
Bay</span> (the site of the future town of Cairns) on 26<i>th
July</i>, and shortly afterwards gave to the mountain behind
Cook's Cape Tribulation the name of <span class="a">Peter
Botte</span>, from a fancied resemblance to the mountain of that
name in the Mauritius. A fortnight (31<i>st July</i> to 14<i>th
August</i>) was spent at <span class="a">Lizard Island</span>.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-e">MAP E.</a>)
<span class="a">Cape Melville</span> was reached on 21st August
and the <span class="a">Pipon Islands</span> on the following
day. Here the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" was joined by the
"<i>Bramble</i>" and Yule reported that he had waited ten days in
Princess Charlotte Bay without seeing anything of Kennedy. While
the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" lay off <span class="a">Cape
Melville</span>, a watering party was attacked by <span class=
"a">natives</span> on a small stream "inside of the cape"
(<i>i.e</i>., in <span class="a">Bathurst Bay</span>, to the
west), but no casualties took place. (<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-c">MAP C.</a>)</p>
<p>From the Pipon Islands to <span class="a">Pelican
Island</span> (143&deg; 50' E.; 13&deg; 55' S.), which was
reached on 28<i>th August</i>, the course of the
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>" and "<i>Bramble</i>" was probably across
Bathurst Bay, through Rattlesnake Channel (between Denham Island
and Bathurst Head), across Princess Charlotte Bay, and west of
the Beabey Patches and Stainer Island. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) Named after F. G. Beabey, Boatswain (1899), and
C. E. Stainer, Lieutenant (1898), H.M.S.
"<i>Dart</i>."]</blockquote>
<p>From Pelican Island, the "<i>Bramble</i>" was dispatched to
the south, to fill in details of the survey to the head of
<span class="a">Princess Charlotte Bay</span>. The
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>" anchored at No. 5 <span class="a">Claremont
Island</span> (143&deg; 43' E.; 13&deg; 39' S.), now charted as
<span class="a">Fife Island</span>, on 31<i>st August</i>, and at
<span class="a">Night Island</span> (143&deg; 35' E.; 10&deg; 1'
S.) on 8<i>th September</i>. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-b">MAP B.</a>)</p>
<p>On 29<i>th September</i>, the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" arrived at
Bligh's <span class="a">Sunday Island</span>, where she was
rejoined by the "<i>Bramble</i>." The two ships were at
<span class="a">Cairncross Island</span> on 3<i>rd October</i>,
and at the northern entrance of Port Albany (<span class=
"a">Albany Passage</span>) on 7<i>th October</i>. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>) On the 8<i>th</i>,
they went on to <span class="a">Evans Bay</span>, where they took
in water, after having cleared out the wells dug by the
"<i>Fly</i>."</p>
<p>"While the ship ['<i>Rattlesnake</i>'] remained at Cape York,
the '<i>Bramble,</i>' 'Asp,' pinnace and our second cutter were
engaged in the survey of <span class="a">Endeavour Strait</span>
and the <span class="a">Prince of Wales Channel</span>, which
they finished before they left, thus completing the survey of the
<span class="a">Inner Route</span> between Dunk and Booby
Islands" ("<i>Rattlesnake</i>" I, p. 122). Among the surveys made
by Yule in the "<i>Bramble</i>" was that of <span class=
"a">Albany Passage</span>. Yule named <span class="a">Port
Albany</span> ("<i>Rattlesnake</i>" I, p. 132). The pinnace was
sent to <span class="a">Booby Island</span> and found
letters.</p>
<p>About the same time that the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" arrived at
Cape York, five canoes arrived from Mount Adolphus Island,
temporarily increasing the population of Evans Bay to about 150
men, women and children. They visited the ship and were friendly
and well treated. They only stayed a few days, and then dispersed
along the coast to the south. Stanley considered Cape York a
suitable locality for a military post, such as was then
contemplated, as Port Essington was not answering the purpose for
which it had been founded. In Evans Bay, water was obtainable
only in wells, and he judged a small sandy bay on Albany Island
to be preferable. MacGillivray noted the occurrence of porphyry
in the vicinity of Cape York and of sandstone cliffs, 30 feet
high, on <span class="a">Albany Island</span>.</p>
<p>It had been "arranged" that <span class="a">Kennedy</span>
should be at Cape York by the beginning of October, but such
arrangements are liable to be overruled by unforeseen
circumstances. The schooner "<i>Ariel</i>" Captain Dobson, sent
from Sydney, with Dr. Adoniah Vallack and another man as
reinforcements, and with sheep and other provisions for Kennedy,
arrived at Cape York on 27th October.</p>
<p>The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" or the "<i>Bramble</i>" was
constantly on the look out for the expected arrival of the land
party till 2nd November, when this duty was delegated to the
"<i>Ariel</i>" It was not till 23rd December that Kennedy's
aboriginal "boy" <span class="a">Jackey-Jackey</span>, sole
survivor of the forlorn hope which had attempted a "dash" to Cape
York (Kennedy and his three white companions having perished),
more than half dead, hailed the "<i>Ariel</i>" from the shore. It
has already been related how Captain Dobson took Jackey-Jackey on
board the "<i>Ariel</i>" and sailed promptly to the relief of the
main body of the expedition marooned in <span class="a">Weymouth
Bay</span> and rescued the two survivors, <span class=
"a">Carron</span> and <span class="a">Goddard</span>, on 30th
December.</p>
<p>The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" and "<i>Bramble</i>" left Evans Bay
on 2<i>nd November</i> and reached <span class="a">Booby
Island</span> on the 4<i>th</i>, having passed through
<span class="a">Prince of Wales Channel</span>. The
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>" arrived at <span class="a">Port
Essington</span> on 9<i>th November</i>, 1848, and at
<span class="a">Sydney</span> on 24<i>th January</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>The "<i>Bramble</i>" was left at Booby Island with
instructions to finish some work in Endeavour Strait and the
Inner Passage, and was then to proceed to Sydney. She passed
<span class="a">Weymouth Bay</span> on 1<i>st</i> and 2<i>nd
December</i>, full in sight of the party dying of sickness and
starvation and frantically making signals of distress.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>)
<span class="a">Carron</span> has described with a glowing pen
the elation arising from the certainty of being snatched from the
very jaws of death and the subsequent agony of despair when their
hopes were dashed to the ground.</p>
<p>Granting that one of the possibilities of the situation was
that the exploring party had been lost, and that another was that
they had been compelled to abandon their intention of making for
Cape York, there still remained a third, <i>viz.</i>, that they
had made for the coast in the hope of signalling the ship which
had been ordered to meet them at Cape York on her return voyage,
or of being picked up by some other vessel. Yule had, no doubt,
technically obeyed orders when he waited in Princess Charlotte
Bay and at Cape York for Kennedy, who did not keep his
appointment; but he might have been expected not to have lost
sight of the third possibility, and to have kept a look out as he
passed southward within sight of the coast. He may, indeed, have
done so, and I have already pointed out that Carron's flagstaff
was not planted in the most commanding position. It must also be
admitted that on the afternoon of 1st January the declining sun
in the look out's eyes may have prevented him seeing the signal
flag as he scanned the shore, and that the noise of the pistol
shots might not carry far, as "the wind was blowing strong from
the south-east"; but the fires and rockets might have attracted
attention during the night. At the judicial investigation held in
Sydney on 6th March, 1849 (the day after the arrival of the
"<i>Ariel</i>" with the survivors), Lieutenant Yule was not
called upon to give evidence, as he would almost certainly have
been had he been on the spot. His account of the
"<i>Bramble's</i>" traverse of Weymouth Bay might have been of
material value as a commentary on Carron's narrative. The
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>" was in Sydney from 24th January to 8th May,
1849, and MacGillivray makes no mention of the arrival of the
"<i>Bramble</i>" which probably came no further south than
Moreton Bay, where she was joined by the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" on
17th May.</p>
<h4>&sect;3. THIRD NORTHERN CRUISE</h4>
<p>The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" which left <span class=
"a">Sydney</span> on 8<i>th May</i>, picked up the
"<i>Bramble</i>" in Moreton Bay nine days later. On 26<i>th
May</i>, the two ships sailed for the <span class="a">Louisiade
Archipelago</span> and <span class="a">New Guinea</span>. On
27<i>th September</i>, they left New Guinea for Cape York to meet
a vessel which was to bring them supplies from Sydney. Next day
they anchored off <span class="a">Bramble Cay</span>.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>) By
<span class="a">Stephens</span>' and <span class="a">Campbell's
Islands</span>, they went to <span class="a">Marsden
Island</span>, where they anchored on 29<i>th September</i>. Here
the "<i>Bramble</i>" left the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" to call at the
<span class="a">Booby Island</span> post office. The
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>" sailing <i>via</i> <span class=
"a">Arden</span> and <span class="a">Coconut Islands</span>,
reached <span class="a">Evans Bay</span>, Cape York, on 1st
October, and was rejoined by the "<i>Bramble</i>" Yule reported
that the boats of an American whaler lost on the Alert Reef,
outside the Barrier, had arrived at Booby Island, and their crews
had been saved from starvation by the provisions deposited
there.</p>
<p>During the stay of the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" at Cape York, a
remarkable incident took place. On 16th October, a <span class=
"a">white woman</span> claimed the protection of a boat's crew
who had landed on the beach. She was Barbara Thomson, a native of
Aberdeen, who had immigrated with her parents to New South Wales,
where she had married. Some four and a half years ago, she had
embarked with her husband in the cutter "<i>America</i>" bent on
the salvage of oil from a whaler wrecked on the Bampton Shoal.
The guide, a member of the shipwrecked crew, failed to discover
the wreck, whereupon recrimination and quarrelling ensued. Two
men were accidentally drowned and a third was left on a small
uninhabited island. Then the "<i>America</i>" made for Torres
Strait and was wrecked on "the eastern Prince of Wales Island"
(Entrance Island?). The only two men then on the ship (one of
them Barbara's husband?) were drowned in the attempt to swim
ashore; but the woman was rescued by the natives, one of whom,
named Boroto, took her to wife; and she also enjoyed the
protection of a person of importance in the tribe, who lived in
Muralug (Prince of Wales Island), and who recognised her as the
re-embodied spirit of his deceased daughter, who had been named
Gi'Om, which name was conferred on her.</p>
<p>A year ago, the people of the island had heard of the visit of
"two war canoes"&mdash;no doubt the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" and
"<i>Bramble</i>"&mdash;to Cape York. Recently, when the
smoke-telegraph conveyed the news of the return of the two ships,
Gi'Om had persuaded her hosts, chiefly by hints of great rewards,
to take her to Cape York. Once safely on board the
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>" and in spite of objections and threats on
the part of her black friends (who seemed to have become
genuinely attached to her), she elected to return to Sydney,
where she was ultimately restored to her parents.</p>
<p>Gi'Om had much to tell of a <span class="a">white man</span>,
with a name which sounded like Wini, who had lived with the Badu
(<span class="a">Mulgrave Island</span>) tribe for many years.
This man had once visited Prince of Wales Island in the hope of
inducing Gi'Om to "share his fortunes." From the fact of his not
understanding English and having to converse with her in the
native language, she took him to be a foreigner.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"He had," says MacGillivray, "reached
Mulgrave Island in a boat, after having, by his own account,
killed his companions, some three or four in number. In course of
time, he became the most important person in the tribe, having
gained an ascendancy by procuring the death of his principal
enemies and intimidating others; which led to the establishment
of his fame as a warrior, and he became in consequence the
possessor of several wives and canoes and some property in land,
the cultivation of which last he pays great attention to. Wini's
character appears from the accounts I have heard&mdash;for others
corroborated part of Gi'Om's statement&mdash;to be a compound of
villainy and cunning, in addition to the ferocity and headlong
passions of a thorough savage. It strikes me that he must have
been a runaway convict, probably from Norfolk Island. It is
fortunate that his sphere of mischief is so limited, for a more
dangerous ruffian could not easily be found. As matters stand at
present, it is probable that not only during his life but for
years afterwards, every European who falls into the hands of the
Badu people will meet with certain death."</blockquote>
<p>Lieutenant J. Sweatman, of the "<i>Bramble</i>" connected the
advent of Wini on Mulgrave Island with the murder of a boat's
crew belonging to a Sydney <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> and
tortoise-shell vessel, who, in June, 1846, landed on <span class=
"a">Mulgrave Island</span> to barter, but rowed off to a sandbank
on the appearance of suspicious symptoms among the natives. Four
men were killed on the sandbank, while two others, who were in
the boat, apparently escaped. "In my opinion," observes
MacGillivray, "Wini's arrival on Mulgrave Island probably took
place long before the murder of the boat's crew. More, I think,
than three years and a half must have been required for him to
have acquired the influence, reputation and property referred to
by Gi'Om; and this supposition accords with her phrase of 'many
years.'"</p>
<p>Only two years ago, <i>i.e</i>., before 1849, adds
MacGillivray, two men and a boy, who had reached <span class=
"a">Banks Island</span> in a boat, were murdered by the natives.
MacGillivray remarks that the natives of <span class="a">Darnley
Island</span>, which is more frequently visited by ships than
Banks Island, are safe to deal with, and that the <span class=
"a">Murray Islanders</span> treat distressed strangers with
kindness.</p>
<p>MacGillivray's observations led him to the conclusion that the
<span class="a">Cape York natives</span> were of mixed Australian
and Papuan blood. The <span class="a">Prince of Wales
Islanders</span> look down upon them and are justified in
regarding them as inferiors. Bows and arrows are in use on the
islands, but not on the mainland, where also there is no true
chieftainship. I may point out that observations prior to
MacGillivray's leave it doubtful whether, even in the islands,
there is chieftainship, or anything more than the temporary
ascendancy of individuals showing unusual strength of character.
Nor am I certain that a deliberate preference for wimmeras and
spears to bows and arrows is in itself a proof of mental
inferiority. On the other hand, the superiority of the islanders
in cultivation, in industry and in land and marine architecture,
is beyond question.</p>
<p>During a stay of nine weeks in the neighbourhood of Cape York,
the men of the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" had good opportunities for
observing the natives of the "Land's End" of the Australian
continent, with whom they kept up friendly relations. They were
interested spectators of a <span class="a">fight</span> or
tournament, of fifteen warriors on each side, which resolved
itself into duels with spears between individual combatants. When
shooting parties left the ship, each sportsman was assisted by a
favoured black individual who had been selected as associate, or
<i>hotaiga</i> (younger brother), and there was keen competition
for this honour.</p>
<p>A native <span class="a">dance</span>, of about 150
performers, was got up for the entertainment of the visitors; but
it proved, according to MacGillivray, "a very poor affair," and
broke up in disorder because of the distribution of biscuits
having been entrusted to one of the women.</p>
<p>A fine fresh-water stream was discovered running into Muddy
Bay, and was named the <span class="a">Mew River</span>. As there
was some good land on its banks, MacGillivray considered this a
good site for a <span class="a">settlement</span>, Port Essington
having by this time been abandoned.</p>
<p>On 3<i>rd December</i>, 1849, the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" left
Cape York and anchored at <span class="a">Ernest Island</span>,
27 minutes to the north. The island is composed of syenite, rises
to a height of 751 feet and contains a village of 150
inhabitants.</p>
<p><span class="a">Sue Island</span> (142&deg; 50' E.; 10&deg;
12' S.) is the central of the "<span class="a">Three Sisters"
Group, Poll Island</span> lying to the south and <span class=
"a">Bet Island</span> to the north. The group is about 21 minutes
east of Ernest Island. Sue Island, which is composed of coral
sand, has a village of sixty inhabitants and a coco-nut
plantation. Seven men paddled out to the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" in
a canoe and bartered tortoise-shell for tobacco. The men
"differed in no material respect" from the natives of Prince of
Wales and Darnley Islands. The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" anchored for
the night of the 7th off the west end of the reef which runs east
and west (chiefly east) of <span class="a">Bet Island</span>.</p>
<p>On 8<i>th December</i>, the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" sailed ENE.
between <span class="a">Coco-nut</span> and <span class="a">Dove
Islands</span> and anchored at <span class="a">Arden
Island</span> to the NE. A party landed on 8th December, but
found no natives in residence. She then proceeded to <span class=
"a">Keats Island</span>, where she anchored, having passed
<span class="a">Rennel</span> and <span class="a">Marsden
Islands</span> on the right. The following day she anchored north
of <span class="a">Darnley Island</span>, where, on the 11th,
12th and 13th, the usual bartering took place in the villages. In
addition to coco-nuts, sago palms and mangoes were noted among
the cultivated trees. The <span class="a">mummy</span> of a child
was offered for sale, and over this deal friction arose, which at
one time threatened to develop into serious trouble. Huxley was
allowed to enter a hut and sketch its interior and contents.</p>
<p>On 14<i>th December</i>, the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" proceeded to
<span class="a">Bramble Cay</span>, where some of the party
landed, collecting turtles' and birds' eggs. The booby was
present in great numbers.</p>
<p>On 19<i>th December</i>, the "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" left
<span class="a">Bramble Cay</span> for <span class="a">Cape
Possession</span>, New Guinea (146&deg; 20' E.; 8&deg; 38' S.),
and, two days later, was at anchor in the lee of the Paiwara
Islands, where she lay for a week while Yule, in the
"<i>Bramble</i>," surveyed between <span class="a">Cape
Direction</span> and <span class="a">Redscar Bay</span>, New
Guinea. (<span class="a">Admiralty Chart</span>, No. 2758 A.)
Observations were made (for the second time) to ascertain the
height of <span class="a">Mount Owen Stanley</span> (13,205
feet).</p>
<p>On 6<i>th January</i>, 1850, the <span class="a">Duchateau
Islands</span> (152&deg; 25' E.; 11&deg; 25' S.) were reached,
and the survey of the <span class="a">Louisiade
Archipelago</span> was entered upon.</p>
<p>The "<i>Rattlesnake</i>" left the Duchateau Islands on 8th
January, and reached <span class="a">Sydney</span> on 5<i>th
February</i>, 1850. <span class="a">Captain Owen Stanley
died</span> there on 13th March, while apparently convalescing
from an illness contracted during the last cruise, and Lieutenant
Yule succeeded to the command.</p>
<p>The "<i>Bramble</i>" was left in Sydney when, on 2nd May, the
"<i>Rattlesnake</i>" left for England, with, it may be noted, the
greater number of the marines from the abandoned station of Port
Essington on board. The voyage to England was made by the north
end of New Zealand and round Cape Horn, and ended at <span class=
"a">Chatham</span> on 9<i>th November</i>, 1850.</p>

<p>I<small>N</small> 1854, at the instigation of the Royal
Geographical Society, the British Government, although at the
time much preoccupied with the Crimean war, organised an
expedition designed "to lay open, if favoured with success, more
of the interior of the great Australian Continent than the many
energetic but partial attempts hitherto made have succeeded in
developing." A sum of &pound;5,000 was voted and it was
understood that more would be provided if necessary. The command
was given to Mr. (afterwards Sir) <span class="a">Augustus
Charles Gregory</span>, then Assistant Surveyor, Western
Australia. The full party was thus composed:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left:0.0cm;"><i>Commander:</i> A. C.
Gregory.<br>
<i>Assistant Commander</i>: H. C. Gregory.<br>
<i>Geologist</i>: J. S. Wilson.<br>
<i>Artist and Storekeeper</i>: J. Baines.<br>
<i>Surgeon and Naturalist</i>: J. R. Elsey.</div>
<div style="text-indent:-0.5cm; margin-left:0.5cm;">
<i>Botanist</i>: Ferdinand von' Mueller (afterwards Baron and Sir
Ferdinand).</div>
<div style="margin-left:0.0cm;"><i>Collector and Preserver</i>:

&amp;c.</i>: C. Humphries, R. Bowman, C. Dean, J. Melville, W.
Dawson, W. Shewell, W. Selby, S. Macdonald, H. Richards, J.
Fahey.</div>
<p>The proceedings of the expedition are summarised in a British
Parliamentary Paper, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> while the
Diary is given in a Collection of Mr. Gregory's Journals
published by the Queensland Government. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) Papers relating to an Expedition recently
undertaken for the purpose of Exploring the Western Portion of
Australia. Presented to both Houses of Parliament, London,

<blockquote>[2) Journals of Australian Explorations by Augustus
Charles Gregory, C.M.G., F.R.G.S., etc., and Francis Thomas
Gregory. Brisbane Government Printer, 1884.]</blockquote>
<p>The expedition was conveyed to the scene of its land
operations by the barque "<i>Monarch</i>" and the schooner
"<i>Tom Tough</i>," which left Sydney on 18th July, Brisbane on
12th August and Port Albany on 27th August, 1855. After passing
through <span class="a">Endeavour Strait</span>, <span class=
"a">Port Essington</span> was reached on 1st September. The
horses were landed at <span class="a">Point Pearce</span>. The
"<i>Monarch</i>" went on to Singapore while the "<i>Tom
Tough</i>" was sent up the <span class="a">Victoria River</span>
to establish a <i>dep&ocirc;t</i> at the highest convenient
point.</p>
<p>After preliminary rides, during which the <span class=
"a">McAdam Range</span> was crossed and the <span class=
"a">Fitzmaurice River</span> was reached, the land party left
<span class="a">Point Pearce</span> on 6th October. The
<span class="a">Victoria River</span> was reached on 17th
October, but it was not until the 20th that Elsey and two men
were found camped at a spring, and they told that the schooner
had grounded lower down the river (below Mosquito Flat). With
infinite labour the damaged ship was brought up the river to a
point in 15&deg; 39' 43", near <span class="a">Steep Head</span>,
where a <i>dep&ocirc;t</i> was established. Further
<i>reconnaissances</i> connected the explorer's <i>route</i> with
the points named during the voyage of the "<i>Beagle</i>."</p>
<p>Finally, a party consisting of A. C. and H. C. Gregory,
Baines, Mueller, Flood, Phibbs, Bowman, Dean and Fahey started
out, on 3<i>rd January</i>, 1856, to the south-west to carry out
the main purpose of the expedition in the exploration of new
country, A second <i>dep&ocirc;t</i> was established in 17&deg;
43' S. (approx. longitude 130&deg; 30' E.) and a party of four
(the two Gregorys, Mueller and Dean) continued the journey. A
river, which was named the <span class="a">Sturt</span>, was
followed to the SW. to 20&deg; 16' 22", where it entered a dry
salt lake (6th March). The party then made for the (second)
<span class="a">Dep&ocirc;t Camp</span>, which was reached on
28<i>th March</i>. The party there, in charge of Baines, had been
"somewhat annoyed" by frequent attempts on the party by the
<span class="a">natives</span> to burn them out. The principal
<span class="a">Dep&ocirc;t Camp</span> near Steep Head was
reached on 6<i>th May</i>. Elsey was in charge, Wilson having
gone down the river to where the "<i>Tom Tough</i>" was still
undergoing repairs. One member of the crew had died. All was
quiet at the dep&ocirc;t. The natives had been respectful to the
full party, but isolated units or small parties had at different
times been threatened.</p>
<p>The journey on which Gregory crossed and recrossed the
southern base of the Cape York Peninsula <span class="a">started
from the Dep&ocirc;t Camp</span> on 21<i>st June</i>, 1856, and
the party comprised, besides the leader, H. C. Gregory, Elsey,
Mueller, Bowman, Dean and Melville. They had thirty-four horses
and five months' provisions. The general course followed was E.
by N. as far as Leichhardt's <span class="a">Roper River</span>
(14&deg; 50' 56" S. lat.; approx. E. long. 133&deg; 40'), and
thence south-eastward, parallel to the Limmen
Bight&mdash;Bentinck Islands shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria to
the meridian of 138&deg; E., which three years later was to
become the dividing line between Queensland and the Northern
Territory. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) This meridian line was run in 1885-6 by the South
Australian Surveyors Messrs. Poeppel and
Carruthers.]</blockquote>
<p>In running down what was named <span class="a">Elsey
Creek</span>, a tributary of the Roper, the remains of a hut were
noted. This was taken to be one of Leichhardt's camps on his last
journey. On 19th July <span class="a">natives</span> were
detected in the act of breaking into the camp and had to be
scared away by a charge of shot. Two horses died from poison on
the 21st.</p>
<p>On 4<i>th August</i>, Gregory identified Leichhardt's
<span class="a">McArthur River</span>, although he must have been
still considerably south of Leichhardt's course of 1845.</p>
<p>On 19<i>th August</i>, the expedition struck the waters of the
<span class="a">Nicholson River</span>, which were followed for
more than a week to the east. On the 21st the 138th meridian was
passed and the future territory of Queensland was entered.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-n">MAP N.</a>) On
30<i>th August</i>, the river was found to bend from east to
north and it was left behind, the party continuing to follow an
easterly course, and after crossing a large tributary, now known
as the <span class="a">Gregory River</span>, camped for the night
on the left bank of the <span class="a">Barkly</span> <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> <span class="a">River</span>.</p>
<blockquote>[2) Gregory spells the name "Barclay," but it was
given in honour of Sir Henry Barkly, Governor of
Victoria.]</blockquote>
<p>The Queensland portion of the Nicholson River was surveyed by
Twisden Bedford in 1882. Run-surveys made in 1889 by J. T. Embley
connected the Nicholson River with Lawn Hill Creek. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-m">MAP M.</a>)</p>
<p>Gregory was now in touch with the "<i>Beagle</i>" (1841) and
<span class="a">Leichhardt</span> (1845), for the Barkly had only
to be followed down a short distance when it received
Leichhardt's <span class="a">Beame's Brook</span>, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> shortly below which it widened into what
Stokes called the Hope Reach of the "<i>Beagle's</i>"
<span class="a">Albert River</span>. Beanie's Brook is in reality
one of the channels of the Barkly or Albert River and, as it
happens, the only one which carries running water through all but
the most prolonged droughts. On the banks of the Hope Reach,
certain marks on trees were understood to denote the presence, in
the month of March, 1856, of a boat party sent up the Albert by
Lieutenant Chirnmo, of H.M. steamer "<i>Torch</i>."</p>
<blockquote>[1) Beame's Brook Hotel of modern times is near the
junction.]</blockquote>
<p>It had been arranged that the "<i>Tom Tough</i>" should await
the land party on the Albert River, but she had evidently failed
to make the rendezvous in time, and Gregory left instructions
which it was expected would be found by Baines.</p>
<p>It appeared that, having reached Soerabaya, the "<i>Tom
Tough</i>" was overhauled and pronounced to be in need of
extensive repairs before she would be fit for a voyage to the
Gulf of Carpentaria. She was therefore left behind, while another
schooner, the "<i>Messenger</i>" was chartered for the service.
The latter reached the Albert on 11th November, and found
Gregory's letters. She then sailed for Sydney by the west
coast.</p>
<p>From the right bank of the Albert River below Beame's Brook,
Gregory steered (3<i>rd September</i>) eastward for about 10
miles over box flats and grassy plains to <span class="a">Harris
Creek</span>, which he followed to the NE. for a few miles until
he had satisfied himself that it was one of the heads of the
"<span class="a">Saltwater Arm</span>" of the Albert. (Here he
was 8 miles SE. of the modern township of <span class=
"a">Burketown</span>.) Then turning SSE., he crossed <span class=
"a">Crooky Creek</span>, here running north, and another head of
the Saltwater Arm. On the same course, he camped for the night at
"Millar's Waterhole," on <span class="a">Millar Creek</span>, by
far the longest tributary of the Saltwater Arm. The telegraph
line from Burketown to Normanton, <i>via</i> Floraville, now
crosses Millar Creek at the water-hole. The names Harris, Crooky
and Millar designate the three branches of the SouthWestern Arm
on modern maps, but there is nothing in the diary or report to
indicate that they were bestowed by Gregory.</p>
<p>The following day (4<i>th February</i>) brought the party by a
course still to the SE., to the bank of a large river which
Leichhardt, who had crossed it about 12 miles lower, <i>i.e</i>.,
down stream, had mistaken for the Albert, but which Gregory now
named the <span class="a">Leichhardt</span>. Its course is to the
north and it falls into the Gulf only 2 miles east of the Albert,
the mouths of the rivers being interlaced by the Landsborough
Inlet. Gregory's camp of 4th September must have been at or very
near the modern <span class="a">Floraville Station</span>. It was
visited in the evening by a party of nine armed <span class=
"a">blacks</span>, who seemed at first inclined to be hostile,
but eventually retired. On the following morning, however, they
returned, reinforced to the number of nineteen, and rushed the
party, when it was about to make a start, with poised spears,
"but just as their leader was in the act of throwing a spear,"
says Gregory, "he received a charge of small shot. This checked
them, and we charged them on horseback, and with a few shots from
our revolvers put them to flight, except one man, who climbed a
tree, where we left him."</p>
<p>Without notable incidents, the expedition, travelling
eastward, crossed <span class="a">Punchbowl</span> and
"<span class="a">M" Creeks</span>, heads of <span class=
"a">Morning Inlet, "L"</span> and <span class="a">Armstrong
Creeks</span>, tributaries of the Flinders, and reached the
<span class="a">Flinders</span> on 9<i>th September</i> (18&deg;
8' 41"). Still keeping an easterly course, the camp of the
10<i>th September</i> was on <span class="a">Brown Creek</span>,
a tributary of the Norman River. The <span class="a">Norman
River</span> itself was crossed next day and followed up, on its
right bank, to SSE. to the camp in 18&deg; 18' 5". (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-l">MAP L.</a>)</p>
<p>On the 13<i>th September</i>, they steered ENE., through box
flats for five or six hours, and must have crossed <span class=
"a">Belmore Creek</span>&mdash;probably not
recognisable&mdash;some 50 miles below (west of) the present
<span class="a">Croydon Goldfield</span>. The course was then
altered to the north till a dry creek in a rocky channel was met
with, falling to the west, and this was followed down till 6.15
p.m. when a waterless camp was made. This was, no doubt,
<span class="a">Clarina Creek</span>. Next day water was found
some distance down the creek, in 17&deg; 59' 26", and the camp
was shifted. This was probably about a mile south of the
<span class="a">Hayden</span> Station on the present
Normanton-Croydon Railway.</p>
<p>On 15<i>th September</i>, a course of N. 10&deg; E. (mag.)
brought the party in six hours to "a small water-hole in a sandy
creek, 15 yards wide," in 17&deg; 46' 11". This must have been
the <span class="a">Carron River ( = Creen Creek</span>), some 35
miles below (WNW. of) the "<span class="a">Creen Creek" Telegraph
Office</span> of the "seventies."</p>
<p>On the 16<i>th</i>, on a general NNE. course, the party
travelled to what must have been <span class="a">Wills
Creek</span>, and then followed the creek down to the west in
search of water. The camp had been made in 17&deg; 34' 5", before
water was found in a hole half a mile lower down. A day's halt
was made for the sake of the horses.</p>
<p>On 18<i>th September</i>, a day's march to North 10&deg; East
(mag.) brought them to a fine lagoon on the bank of <span class=
"a">Walker Creek</span>, in 17&deg; 21' 20", about 36 miles below
(west of) where the creek leaks out of the Gilbert River. Walker
Creek is one of the mouths of the Gilbert, and falls into the
Norman River a few miles before the latter reaches the Gulf. Two
days were spent here in refreshing the horses, with the exception
of one unfortunate which was killed for meat, the flesh being
sun-dried. The ration of flour was reduced to three-quarters of a
pound per day.</p>
<p>Three hours, on the 21<i>st</i>, on a NE. course, brought the
explorers to the <span class="a">Smithburn Branch</span>, or
mouth, of Leichhardt's <span class="a">Gilbert River</span>. The
branch was then followed up for some 12 miles and the camp was
pitched on the southern or left bank of the <span class=
"a">Gilbert's</span> main channel, in 17&deg; 18' 5" S., just
above where the "branch" leaks out of it.</p>
<p>The left bank of the Gilbert River was then followed up to
ESE. The camp of 22<i>nd September</i> was above the outfall of
Walker Creek. On the 23<i>rd</i>, east of where <span class=
"a">Miranda Downs</span> Old Station was afterwards built, and
west of the Bobby Towns Lagoon 5 the confluence of the
<span class="a">Einasleigh River</span> with the Gilbert was
passed unobserved, and the left bank of the <span class=
"a">Gilbert</span> was followed on a south-easterly course to a
camp in 17&deg; 36' S.</p>
<p>Gregory and his party crossed to the right bank of the river
next day, and followed its south-easterly course, camping on
27<i>th September</i> in 18&deg; 15' 21", near what is now
<span class="a">Cobb</span> &amp; Co.'s <span class="a">"Tonks"
Stage</span>. The night before, they had camped near the present
<span class="a">Gilbert Telegraph And Post Office</span>.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> A belt of auriferous and
cupriferous country was afterwards discovered to extend eastward
from the Gilbert Telegraph Station, through the Cumberland and
Etheridge.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Not "Gilberton," which is much further up the
river.</blockquote>
<p>Above "Tonks," the Gilbert River first comes from the east for
about 12 miles, and then from the south. The party rounded this
bend and camped on the right, or eastern bank, on 29<i>th
September</i> in 18&deg; 25' 33", about 4 miles above the
junction of <span class="a">Macdonald Creek</span>.</p>
<p>Some distance east of the river, but for the most part keeping
it in sight, the party followed it up to the south on 29<i>th</i>
and 30<i>th September</i> and 1<i>st October</i>, passing through
what was afterwards known as the <span class="a">Green Hills
Goldfield</span>. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-p">MAP P.</a>) On the 1<i>st October</i>, the camp was in
18&deg; 40' 29", on the right bank of a river which Gregory
understood to be still the Gilbert, but he had in reality left
the river about 2 miles back and was on the branch now known as
the <span class="a">Robertson River</span>. After
<i>reconnaissances</i>, an east-south-east course was taken and
the camp on 4<i>th October</i> was in 18&deg; 47' 54" on the
left, or south-eastern bank of the Robertson River west of
<span class="a">Mount Helpman</span>. On the 4th the camp was
moved 3 miles ENE. up the river, and the three following days
were spent in <i>reconnaissances</i>, while a fourth was lost
owing to the straying of horses.</p>
<p>On 10<i>th</i> and 11<i>th October</i>, the course of the
march was to the east. The camp of the 10th appears to have been
between Bowman's Springs and the bend of the Robertson River,
which here runs to the north. On the 11th, the "<span class=
"a">Newcastle Range</span>"&mdash;by which Gregory appears to
have understood the dividing ridge between the Robertson and the
Einasleigh was crossed, and the camp was made in 18&deg; 45' 53"
S., within a two hours' march (say 5 miles) of the Copperfield
River.</p>
<p>On 12<i>th October</i>, after steering E. 30&deg; N. for an
hour and three quarters, a creek coming from the south was
crossed. It had a sandy bed 100 yards wide, but only a few pools
of shallow water. [It must have been the <span class=
"a">Copperfield River</span>, about 12 miles below (north of)
Kidston, the township of the modern <span class="a">Oaks
Goldfield</span>.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] On the
same course, over basaltic country, another water-course was met
with in the afternoon and the camp was pitched in 18&deg; 38' 12"
on a water-hole 70 yards wide. [This must have been the
<span class="a">Einasleigh River</span>.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>Gregory believed the two rivers met with on this day's march
to be tributaries of Leichhardt's <span class="a">Lynd
River</span>. As a matter of fact, they unite some 15 miles north
of Gregory's track at the modern copper-mining township of
Einasleigh, and the united stream, under the name of the
<span class="a">Einasleigh River</span>, falls into the
<span class="a">Gilbert</span> about 170 miles lower. The Lynd
has its source in the range which divides the Gulf and Pacific
waters about 60 miles N.E. of Gregory's camp of 12th October.</p>
<p>This misconception persisted for some time after the
establishment of <span class="a">Carpentaria Downs</span> station
on the Einasleigh, which was believed, even by the owner of the
station, to be the Lynd. The Jardine Brothers first, in 1864,
settled the distinctness of the two rivers.</p>
<p>The progress made by Gregory on 13<i>th</i> and 14<i>th
October</i> was to the east, mainly in basaltic country traversed
by small tributaries of the Einasleigh draining to the SW. The
camp of the 14th was on one of these, in|granite country, in lat.
41&deg; 38' S. and long. 144&deg; 33' 15" E.</p>
<p>On 15<i>th October</i>, the so-called "<span class="a">Great
Dividing Range</span>" was crossed early in the day, and at 1.15
p.m. the camp was pitched, in 18&deg; 49' 13", on a small
tributary of the <span class="a">Dry River</span>, which falls
into the Burdekin River. Following the Dry River to the SE.,
Leichhardt's <span class="a">Burdekin River</span> was reached
early next day, and the camp was made at 2 p.m. on its right, or
western, bank in 18&deg; 57' 48", about 9 miles above the present
<span class="a">Greenvale</span> head station. It must have been
near the site of that station of the future that Gregory, on
17<i>th October</i>, noted trees which had been cut with iron
axes and a bullock-bone, and judged these to be traces of
<span class="a">Leichhardt's Camp</span> of 26th April, 1845.</p>
<p>As Gregory was now retracing Leichhardt's tracks, it is
unnecessary to follow his progress minutely, but a few details
may be noted. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-q">MAP
Q.</a>)</p>
<p>Still following the Burdekin down, Gregory observed, on 21st
October, in 19&deg; 16' 22", that the <span class=
"a">Blacks</span> used throwing-sticks (wimmeras) to propel their
spears. On 27th October, he crossed the <span class="a">Broughton
River</span>, south-east of Charters Towers, and camped at the
mouth of <span class="a">Gladstone Creek</span>.</p>
<p>He followed the Burdekin to the SE., to its junction with the
<span class="a">Suttor River</span>, which comes from the south.
He then followed up the Suttor to the south as far as lat.
21&deg; 22' 43", where he placed his camp of 3<i>rd
November</i>.</p>
<p>Six miles south of this camp, the stream now known as the
Suttor, branches off to the east. Gregory, however, followed
southward on what is undoubtedly the more important watercourse,
the <span class="a">Belyando</span>, which he believed to be the
Suttor. Ten miles above the Suttor, the Belyando is joined by
another creek, which Gregory followed up to E. and SE., still in
the belief that he was on the Suttor. This appears on modern maps
as "<span class="a">Mistake Creek</span>," the name being
apparently a sarcastic reference to Gregory's natural&mdash;and
justifiable&mdash;mistake. A branch of this creek goes off to the
SE. 45 miles above its junction with the Belyando, and is named
<span class="a">Miclere Creek</span>. Gregory camped on Miclere
Creek on 8<i>th November</i>, in lat. 22&deg; 26' 16". Two days
later he camped west of <span class="a">Blair Athol</span>, on
what is now known as <span class="a">Gregory Creek</span>, which
runs WNW. into Mistake Creek.</p>
<p>Leichhardt's <span class="a">Mackenzie River</span> was
reached on 15<i>th November</i>. (<span class="a">Queensland
16-Mile Map</span>.) On the 17<i>th</i>, below the junction of
the <span class="a">Comet</span> and <span class="a">Mackenzie
Rivers</span>, one of <span class="a">Leichhardt's camps</span>
on his second journey was identified. On the 22<i>nd</i>, the
party arrived at Connor and Fitz's Station on the <span class=
"a">Dawson River</span> (23&deg; 51' 15" S.). Thence, <i>via</i>
Rannes (Hay's Station), Rawabelle, Boondooma, Tabinga, Nanango,
Colinton, Kilcoy, Durundur and Caboolture. <span class=
"a">Brisbane</span> was reached on 16<i>th December</i>,
1856.</p>
<p>Gregory did not travel by dead reckoning and rarely gave even
his own estimate of the distance covered. But his carefully taken
latitudes and occasional lunar observations for longitude are
thoroughly reliable, and enable us to lay down the position of
his nightly camps with confidence on modern maps. Kennedy was
also an expert surveyor and may have been no less accurate on his
Cape York Peninsula trip, but his records perished with him.</p>
<p>In addition to the charting of his <i>route</i>, Gregory made
careful petrographical notes on the journey which we have
followed, and these, so far as the Peninsula part is concerned, I
have added to the map along his line of travel.</p>
<p>Gregory's expedition (March-July, 1858) in search of
Leichhardt did not touch the Cape York Peninsula.</p>

<p>S<small>TRICTLY</small> speaking, the famous "Burke and Wills
Expedition" has no place in a history of the Cape York Peninsula.
At its "furthest north" it merely touched one of the angles of
the Peninsula, but its disastrous finish was the signal for the
dispatch of a number of search parties, three of which were
destined to add something to our knowledge of the region under
review. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>

<p>The sixth and seventh decades of the nineteenth century were
"flush" times in the new colony of Victoria, for the output of
the goldfields had flooded it with prosperity. A period of
lavish, extravagant and whimsical private spending suggested that
the Colony should do something worthy of itself in its collective
capacity, and a proposal for a thorough exploration of the
interior of Australia by a strong party equipped as no previous
party had ever been was enthusiastically taken up. A sum of
&pound;12,000 was found in Victoria for the expedition itself,
and it has been calculated that, including the relief
expeditions, at least &pound;50,000 was expended. An ideal leader
seemed to have been found in <span class="a">Robert O'Hara
Burke</span>, a popular Inspector of Police. With him was
associated <span class="a">William John Wills</span>, at first as
astronomical and meteorological observer, but he soon became
second in command. There were in all eighteen men when the
expedition left Melbourne in August, 1860, with at least 20
camels, numerous horses and drays and 21 tons of provisions.</p>
<p>A <i>dep&ocirc;t</i>, <span class="a">Fort Wills</span>, Camp
65, was made on Cooper's Creek on the Queensland side of the
South Australian border line, and here Burke and half the party
waited for some time for the arrival of the other half, with the
greater part of the stores. Burke soon grew tired of waiting and,
having determined to make a dash for the <span class="a">Gulf of
Carpentaria</span>, left Fort Wills on 16<i>th December</i>,
1860, accompanied by Wills, King and Gray, taking two horses, six
camels and three months' provisions. On a course a little east of
north, he struck the <span class="a">Diamantina</span>, which he
named and followed up, and then crossed the almost imperceptible
watershed between that river and the Cloncurry, which latter
river was struck at the site of the future Cloncurry township.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-r">MAP R.</a>)</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Cloncurry</span> (which Burke named after
Lord Cloncurry) was traced down to the north till it fell into
the Flinders, and the <span class="a">Flinders</span> was then
followed down till it debouched on the coastal plain and led the
party of four almost to the sea. (<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-m">MAP M.</a>) By this time it was the middle of
<i>February</i>, 1861, and four of the camels had died and the
stock of provisions had diminished to such an extent that a
single exhausted pack-horse could easily carry it. King and Gray
were therefore left behind on 9th February while Burke and Wills
pushed on through the mangroves. They did not actually see the
blue water of the Gulf, but they saw the salt water rushing
through the tortuous passages in the mangrove swamps with the
rise and fall of the tides. The camp (No. 119, lat. 17&deg; 53',
according to Wills' Diary) where King and Gray were left behind
has been identified by means of marked trees on the right bank of
the Bynoe Arm (or mouth) of the Flinders, about 5 miles below
where it leaks out of the river. Burke and Wills probably reached
(11<i>th February</i>, 1861) a point between the <span class=
"a">Bynoe Mouth of the Flinders</span> and the mouth of the
<span class="a">Norman River</span>. From the time when they
struck the Cloncurry they had entertained the belief that that
river and the Flinders were Stokes' <span class="a">Albert
River</span>. As it happened, the mistake mattered nothing to
them, but it meant a great deal to those who went out in search
of them later on.</p>
<p>Burke and Wills having rejoined King and Gray (12<i>th
February</i>), no time was lost in facing southward towards the
dep&ocirc;t on Cooper's Creek. The party apparently retraced
their steps past the site of the future township of Cloncurry
(where they had first struck the river), and then followed the
river up to the infall of the <span class="a">Malbon
River</span>, after which it would be natural for them to shorten
the way by taking the chord of the arc described on the outward
journey in following up the Diamantina. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-r">MAP R.</a>) Keeping on a
southerly course and crossing the <span class="a">Selwyn
Range</span> by O'Hara's Gap, they struck a river falling to the
south and now known as the <span class="a">Burke River</span>.
Following this river they passed the site of the future
<span class="a">Boulia</span> township (in Sheet 12A).</p>
<p>Three of the party reached the <span class="a">Fort Wills
Dep&ocirc;t</span> late on 21<i>st April</i>, 1861. The fourth,
<span class="a">Charles Gray</span>, had succumbed, on the way,
to fatigue and hunger on the 17th. The day's delay caused by his
obsequies had tragic consequences for the three survivors.</p>
<p>William Brahe and three other men had been left in charge of
the dep&ocirc;t to await (1) the arrival of the second half of
the full expedition (with stores) and (2) the return of Burke and
his companions from their ill-advised dash to the Gulf. Neither
event, although long overdue, having taken place, and his own
stores having been dangerously depleted, he left the camp at noon
on the very day of Burke's arrival, having first buried a note to
that effect, which was found by Burke. He also left some
provisions.</p>
<p>Emaciated and footsore as Burke and his companions now were,
they judged that they could not hope for success in chasing a
party mounted on animals which presumably were fresh and in good
condition. One is inevitably reminded of the agonising moment
when Kennedy's party, left to starve and die at the mouth of the
Pascoe, saw and failed to attract the attention of the rescue
ship.</p>
<p>Burke, Wills and John King spent altogether about a week at
the <i>dep&ocirc;t</i>, while in one false start one of the two
camels died. Another false start was made and each man carried a
bundle, in addition to a pack carried by the last camel; but they
had not gone far when the camel knocked up and they had to return
to the camp. Their plan had been to go down Cooper's Creek for
some distance and strike west for Eyre's Mount Hopeless. The
camel was shot and the meat sun-dried, and for a few days the men
depended for food mainly on the alms given them by a tribe of
friendly natives, who ultimately left them to their own
resources. They then tried to live as the blacks did, but the
time spent in finding and preparing nardoo to support life left
them no time for progress towards their goal. Wills, unable to
travel, was left behind, while Burke and King went back to the
dep&ocirc;t in search of the natives. <span class="a">Burke
died</span> next morning, and King returned to where <span class=
"a">Wills</span> had been left, and found him also <span class=
"a">dead. Brahe's party</span>, all this time, had not been far
away. In fact, had the Gulf party waited at the dep&ocirc;t till
8th May, they would have been found by Brahe and Wright who,
after they had effected a junction, visited the dep&ocirc;t
together on that date. Strange to say, Brahe and Wright observed
no trace of the Gulf party's recent occupation of the camp, and
they themselves left no trace by which King, who returned a few
days later, could gather that they had been on the spot.</p>
<p>Before it was too late, <span class="a">King</span> again fell
in with the blacks, who supported him for nearly three months,
until he was <span class="a">rescued</span> by <span class=
"a">A.W. Howitt's</span> search party on 15<i>th
September</i>.</p>
<p>One of <span class="a">Brahe's party</span>, named Patton,
died at the <i>dep&ocirc;t</i>. <span class="a">Wright's
party</span>, which was to have brought on the bulk of the
provisions to the <i>dep&ocirc;t</i>, but failed to do so, was
delayed by an outbreak of scurvy and the death of three of its
members, Messrs. Stone and Purcell and Dr. Beckler.</p>
<p>In some respects the story of Burke and Wills is strikingly
parallel to that of Kennedy. Both expeditions were marked by the
high courage of their leaders, by their many mistakes in
judgment, by the hamper of over-equipment, by the frequency of
harrowing delays and disappointments, leading to fatal results,
and by sufferings beyond the capacity of the human frame. But
they differed widely as regards the attitude observed by the
aboriginal <span class="a">natives</span>. The northern tribes
dogged Kennedy's footsteps day after day, malignantly watching
for signs of exhaustion which would give them the opportunity to
attack with impunity. On the other hand, the tribe into whose
hands Burke, Wills and King fell, treated their guests with what
was nothing short of philanthropy, considering their own limited
means.</p>
<p>It has already been pointed out, in the case of the survivors
of the "<i>Maria</i>" that even two neighbouring tribes might act
on diametrically opposite principles. In one case there was
barbarous murder, and in the other, help unceasing and
unselfish.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> Brahe and Wright sections of Burke's
expedition, having effected a junction and visited Fort Wills
(8th May, 1861), hastened back to civilisation. Their reports
reached Melbourne in the end of June, and steps were at once
taken to send out various parties in search of the missing men.
The most successful was that led by <span class="a">A.W.
Howitt</span>, which rescued the only survivor, <span class=
"a">King</span> (15th September), and found the bodies of
<span class="a">Wills</span> and <span class="a">Burke</span>.

party, who were to land at the Gulf of Carpentaria, and commence
a search for Burke and his men. Unfortunately the brig was
severely damaged at the Sir Charles Hardy Islands, but she was

<p>The "<i>Victoria</i>" anchored on 1st October, 1861, 28 miles
up the <span class="a">Albert River</span> (20 miles in a
straight line), where the water, although influenced by tides,
was fresh. Landsborough recommended as a site for the proposed

reported that he followed the Albert River to the sea,
Landsborough's first task was to run that river up. He found its
main feeder to be the <span class="a">Gregory River</span>,
which, with its important branch, the <span class=
"a">O'Shanassy</span>, he traced to SSW., almost to the source of
the latter, naturally without seeing any trace of Burke, who had
mistaken a mouth of the Flinders for the Albert. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-n">MAPS N</a> AND <a href=
"#map-r">R.</a>) He then crossed the <span class="a">Barkly
Tableland</span> to the south and followed down the Herbert (now
<span class="a">Georgina</span>) River to 20&deg; 11' 15" S.
(27<i>th December</i>, 1861), <i>i.e</i>., to a few miles south
of the present <span class="a">Camooweal</span> township, where
the threatening attitude of the <span class="a">natives</span>
made it advisable, considering the numerical weakness of his
party, to turn back. He named the <span class="a">Gregory</span>
and <span class="a">O'Shanassy Rivers</span>, and the
<span class="a">Seymour</span> and <span class="a">Thornton
Rivers</span>, tributaries of the latter, the <span class=
"a">Barkly Tableland</span> and the <span class="a">Herbert (now
Georgina) River</span>.</p>
<p>On passing <span class="a">Beame's Brook</span> on his return
journey from this "<span class="a">First Expedition</span>," he
observed (18<i>th January</i>, 1862) the tracks of an exploring
party making for the <i>dep&ocirc;t</i> on the Albert. (These
must have been <span class="a">Walker's tracks</span>.) He
reached the dep&ocirc;t early next day. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-m">MAP M.</a>)</p>
<p>On what is called his "<span class="a">Second
Expedition</span>," Landsborough left the <span class="a">Firefly
Hulk Dep&ocirc;t</span> on 8<i>th February</i>, 1862. Crossing
the <span class="a">Leichhardt River</span> on 14<i>th
February</i>, at a ford formed by a basaltic ledge, just above
the influence of the tide, in latitude 18&deg; 10' 30" S. (where
is now <span class="a">Floraville Telegraph Station</span>), he
struck out to the south-east and passed <span class="a">Donnor's
Hill</span> on the <span class="a">Cloncurry River</span> close
enough to note that it was composed of sandstone and conglomerate
and reached the <span class="a">Flinders River</span> on 19<i>th
February</i>. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-r">MAP
R.</a>) This course would take him up the valley of the
<span class="a">Alexandra River</span>, a tributary of the
Leichhardt, for about 40 miles and up the valley of its
tributary, <span class="a">Collier Creek,</span> for some 16
miles, and then for a few miles across the watershed between the
Alexandra and the Cloncurry Rivers. He then followed up the
Flinders (SSE.) <i>via</i> <span class="a">Fort Bowen, Mount
Brown, Mount Little, Hervey Downs, O'connell Creek</span> (near
the modern township and railway station of <span class=
"a">Richmond), Sloane Creek</span>, <span class="a">Walker
Creek</span> and <span class="a">Jardine Creek</span>, to all of
which places he gave their names. (<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-q">MAP Q.</a>) Between Walker Creek and the Jardine
he passed the site of the modern town of <span class=
"a">Hughenden</span>. On 8<i>th March</i>, on <span class=
"a">O'Connell Creek,</span> he saw <span class="a">cattle
tracks</span>, and on <span class="a">Walker Creek</span> he
discovered <span class="a">tracks</span> which he (no doubt
correctly) believed to be those of <span class="a">Walker's
Party</span>. From the Jardine Valley he crossed the low
<span class="a">Watershed between the Gulf of Carpentaria and the
Great Australian Bight</span> and passed southward to
<span class="a">Coxon Creek</span>, one of the heads of the
Thomson River. Coxon Creek led him to <span class="a">Towerhill
Creek</span>, which he followed southward, apparently to its
junction with Cornish and Landsborough Creeks, which unite with
Towerhill Creek and form the <span class="a">Thomson
River</span>. From the Thomson River he crossed country to the
south-east to the <span class="a">Warrego River</span>, which he
followed down to Williams' station on the <span class=
"a">Darling</span> (21<i>st May</i>, 1862).</p>
<p>As regards the primary object of his travels, the evidence
procured by Landsborough was of a purely negative character, but
perhaps more than any explorer of these regions he had the good
fortune to demonstrate the existence of an enormous extent of
first-rate <span class="a">pastoral country</span>.</p>
<p>The steamer "<i>Victoria</i>" was back in Moreton Bay on 14th
March, 1862.</p>

<br>
<p>A sequel to Landsborough's expedition was the race for the
magnificent pastoral country described by him. One of the first
starters was <span class="a">Ernest Henry</span>, of Mount
McConnell station, near the junction of the Belyando with the
Burdekin River. He had been, as a member of one of George
Elphinstone Dalrymple's expeditions, among the earliest to follow
up Leichhardt's discoveries in that region. In his early youth he
had served as a subaltern officer in the Crimean War. Along with
a companion named Devlin, he pushed through the spinifex country
between the Cape and Flinders Rivers. Descending to the Jardine
Valley, he followed the Flinders down to a point which he
selected as the site for a new station, on which he bestowed the
name of <span class="a">Hughenden</span>, the Tudor manor house
in Buckinghamshire owned by his grandfather, and known to fame in
later days as the residence of Benjamin Disraeli. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> The name in due course passed on to the
town which grew up near the station. Not long after the
foundation of the station, Henry drifted westward and discovered
the mineral riches of <span class="a">Cloncurry</span>. He died
at Epping, near Sydney, on 26<i>th March</i>, 1919.</p>
<blockquote>[1) "Early Carpentaria," by "Pioneer." <i>The World's
News</i>, 5th May, 1906.]</blockquote>
<p>Another of the immediate effects of Landsborough's expedition
was the settlement of the fine "country" on the <span class=
"a">Albert River</span>, or Inlet. First observed by <span class=
"a">Stokes</span> in 1841, the importance of this district was
emphasised by <span class="a">Landsborough</span> in a manner
which ensured attention. The leader in this new enterprise was
<span class="a">John Graham Macdonald</span>, who was already
known in other districts as an enthusiastic explorer. When
Landsborough's report became known, Macdonald started at once for
the "Albert." He was then resident at <span class="a">Carpentaria
Downs</span> station, as Managing Partner of the firm of Towns
and Black, of which Mr. (afterwards Sir) John Robertson was a
member. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> This station had just
been taken up, and was supposed to be on <span class=
"a">Leichhardt's</span> <span class="a">Lynd River</span>, but
shortly afterwards Jardine proved it to be a tributary of the
Gilbert and named it the <span class="a">Einasleigh</span>.
Macdonald's was the "old" station, not the one which now appears
on maps <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> and which I saw in
course of erection by the Brothers Barker in 1886. <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> The "old" station (which was Jardine's
starting-point in 1864) is about 11 miles to the north, down the
Einasleigh.</p>

<blockquote>[3) <i>Geol. Observations in the North of Queensland,

<p>Macdonald gives the position of the old station, from
information supplied to him by A. J. Richardson, the surveyor
attached to Jardine's expedition, as 18&deg; 37' 10" S. and
144&deg; 3' 30" E., and Richardson himself in his Journal
<b style="color:#603000">[4]</b> gives the same figures, with the
addition that the longitude was the mean of seven sets of lunar
observations, and the latitude the mean of several northern and
southern observations. The latitude is correct, according to
modern mapping, but the longitude is about 8 miles too far west.

<blockquote>[4) 30th February. 1864, <i>Journ. Roy. Geogr.
Soc.</i>, London, Vol. XXXVI, p. 21.]</blockquote>
<p>From the "old" station, then, which was at the time the
"furthest north" of settlement, and which he left on 31st August,
1864, Macdonald struck south-west and saw the <span class=
"a">Robertson River</span> (which he named) at the apex of its
V-shaped bend to NW. and NE. Continuing to the south-west, he cut
the <span class="a">Gilbert River</span>, which he followed
northward to the (future) Cumberland Goldfield. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-q">MAPS Q</a> AND <a href=
"#map-l">L.</a>) The names <span class="a">Macdonald Town</span>
and <span class="a">Macdonald Creek</span> are reminiscent of
this trip, although they were bestowed by later comers. From the
Cumberland, Macdonald followed the river on its westward and
north-westward course to about opposite the modern <span class=
"a">Strathmore Station</span>, when, having headed the
<span class="a">Carron</span> (or Charron?) <span class=
"a">River</span>, he turned to the west. After crossing the
Carron River, which falls into the <span class="a">Norman
River</span>, he crossed the latter at <span class=
"a">Glenore</span>, where the modern railway from Normanton to
the Croydon Goldfield now crosses it. (<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-m">MAP M.</a>) After crossing the <span class=
"a">Flinders River</span>, he turned more to the south (almost to
SW.) and, practically on the line now taken by the telegraph
poles, struck the <span class="a">Leichhardt River</span> in
about 18&deg; 14' S. latitude. Thence he went westward to the
<span class="a">Gregory River</span>, which&mdash;under the names
of the Barkly and the Albert&mdash;he followed down northward,
almost, if not quite, to the site of <span class=
"a">Burketown</span> (30<i>th September</i>). Thence he returned
(SE. by E.&frac12;E.) to his former crossing of the Leichhardt,
where he fixed upon the site of a head station, to be called
<span class="a">Floraville</span>, designed to command the
greater part of what Stokes had designated the <span class=
"a">Plains of Promise</span> nearly a quarter of a century
before.</p>
<p>His return track to Carpentaria Downs was almost the same as
his outward track; indeed, he generally camped at his old camps.
On arriving, however, at the <span class="a">Robertson
River</span>, he ran the river up to its head. (Gregory had
already run it up for some distance in 1856, although he had not
given it a name.) Macdonald arrived at <span class=
"a">Carpentaria Downs</span> on 22<i>nd October</i>, 1864.</p>
<p>Very shortly afterwards he took cattle along his tracks to
stock the new Floraville station. In May, 1865, he chartered the
"<i>Jackmel Packet</i>" for the conveyance of supplies to
Burketown.</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonald, who afterwards was a Police Magistrate, died in
Brisbane in 1918.</p>
<h4>II. WALKER, 1861-2</h4>
<p><span class="a">Frederick Walker</span>, an officer of Native
Police, with troopers and a few white men, among whom were
Haughton, Rodney and Macalister, was sent to search for Burke or
his tracks on a traverse from the east coast of Queensland to the
Gulf of Carpentaria. He came north by the "<i>Firefly</i>" which
also carried Landsborough's party, and landed at Rockhampton,
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> from which he travelled westward
to "Mr. Macintosh's station on the Nogoa." The station was left
behind on 15<i>th September</i>, 1861. Passing <span class=
"a">Emerald Downs</span> on the 20th, Walker reached Dismal
Creek, a tributary of the <span class="a">Barcoo River</span>, at
the intersection of the 146th meridian and 24th parallel,
<i>i.e</i>., between the modern townships of <span class=
"a">Blackall</span> and <span class="a">Jericho</span>. On
30<i>th October</i>, after having, apparently, travelled
<i>via</i> Barcaldine, Aramac, Muttaburra, Cameron Downs and
Afton Downs, he reached (at his Camp 30) and named the
<span class="a">Stawell River</span>, which he then followed up
about 12 miles northward to its junction with the <span class=
"a">Woolgar</span>. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-q">MAP Q.</a>) Crossing the river (to which he gave its
name), he struck out north-west, and on 10<i>th November</i>
(Camp 36) cut a river, running north-west, which might be either
the "Bynoe" or the <span class="a">Norman</span>. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-r">MAP R.</a>) Modern charting
proves that it was the latter. He followed this river down for
120 miles and left it, near his Camp 48, on 25<i>th November</i>.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-m">MAP M.</a>) His 45th
Camp (21<i>st November</i>) was opposite the site of the modern
<span class="a">Vena Park Station</span>.</p>

<p>West of Camp 48, he struck the <span class="a">Flinders
River</span> (25<i>th November</i>, Camp 49) about 3 miles north
of Gregory's camp of 9th September, 1856, and 6 miles north of
the modern <span class="a">Milgarra</span> station, but had to
follow up the right bank of the river to the south for a couple
of miles above Milgarra before he found a convenient crossing. On
the bank of the river he found <span class="a">camel and horse
tracks</span>, making down stream, which could only have been
made by <span class="a">Burke's</span> expedition.</p>
<p>Keeping a course of west by north from the Flinders, almost on
Gregory's track, he crossed <span class="a">Armstrong, "L,"
Goat</span> and "<span class="a">M" Creeks</span>, camping on the
latter (28<i>th November</i>, Camp 52) near the <span class=
"a">Geary Hills</span>. He recognised this as very <span class=
"a">good pastoral country</span>.</p>
<p>On 1<i>st December</i>, salt water was met with on
<span class="a">Lagoon Creek</span>, a tributary of the
Leichhardt, and after a considerable southward detour the
<span class="a">Leichhardt River</span> itself was reached. But
it was "salt 'as brine." Followed up to SSE. for 8 miles it was
still salt, but fresh water was found in a small creek (Camp 55,
1<i>st December</i>, 1861). Here the <span class=
"a">natives</span> made a threatening attack. Few details are
given, but it is stated that "their (the blacks') right wing,
which was the strongest, got over the river and were off, but the
centre and left wing suffered a heavy loss." Near the camp, a
camp of the natives was found to contain a sailor's jumper and an
empty brandy bottle.</p>
<p>Steering NNW., Walker's Camp 56 (2<i>nd December</i>) was on
<span class="a">Millar's Creek</span>, close to Gregory's of 3rd
September, 1856. A course of NNW. brought him next day (Camp 57)
to the Albert (Barkly or <span class="a">Gregory</span>) River,
where the water was slightly salt and influenced by the tides.
After the camp had been made snug, the sound of a <span class=
"a">gun</span> was heard down the river.</p>
<p>Near this camp, on the 4th, a tree marked by <span class=
"a">Gregory</span> (1856) was found, and also a buried bottle
containing a letter from <span class="a">Captain Norman</span>,
dated 29th November, stating that the "<i>Victoria's</i>"
dep&ocirc;t was 12 miles down the river (<i>i.e</i>., on the site
of the modern town of <span class="a">Burketown</span>). Walker
crossed the <span class="a">Barkly River</span> and <span class=
"a">Beame's Brook</span>, and on 7<i>th December</i>, 1861,
"shook hands with Captain Norman."</p>
<p>At the dep&ocirc;t, Walker was supplied with the rations and
stores necessary to replenish his equipment, and eagerly
addressed himself to the task of taking up <span class=
"a">Burke's tracks</span> from the point where he had seen them
on the Flinders. He hastened back to the <span class=
"a">Flinders</span>, no doubt, avoiding the difficulties which
had delayed him on his outward course, and succeeded in tracking
Burke to "two or three camps," <i>i.e</i>., probably to his Camp
119, when he had to give it up, owing to the obliteration of the
hoof-marks by rain. His exact course from this point to Port
Denison, which he reached on 5<i>th May</i>, cannot be traced, as
his journal, as printed by the Royal Geographical Society, ends
with his meeting with Captain Norman. Westgarth's map in
"McKinlay's Tracks" sketchily indicates Walker's homeward
<i>route</i>, and if the sketch is correct, Walker's <i>route</i>
must have been partly up the Lynd (and it is difficult to imagine
what could have taken him there) and on, <i>via</i> Bowen, to
Rockhampton. On the other hand, Landsborough saw <span class=
"a">tracks</span> which there was every reason to believe to be
<span class="a">Walker's</span> on what he named <span class=
"a">Walker's Creek</span>, between Richmond and Hughenden, so
that the probability is that Walker ran up the Flinders and
struck eastward for Port Denison, crossing the heads of the
Thomson and Cape Rivers, and the Belyando and Bowen Rivers on his
way to Port Denison.</p>
<p>Walker's correspondence with Captain Norman shows that his
first intention was to make for Adelaide <i>via</i> Eyre Creek on
the conclusion of his task of tracking the hoof-marks of the
camels. Seeing where he left the camel track, he probably argued
that Burke and Wills must have made good their return to Fort
Cooper, and he was probably influenced by considerations of his
own chances of not finding water on Eyre Creek in deciding in
favour of the Port Denison <i>route</i>.</p>

(Sir Fredk. McCoy), 25th April, 1864.]</blockquote>
<p><span class="a">John McKinlay</span> was born at Sandbank, on
the Clyde, in 1819, and settled in Australia when still a young
man. McKinlay's party (officially known as the South Australian
Burke Relief Expedition) was composed of W. O. Hodgkinson (second
in command), afterwards Minister for Mines, Queensland; John
Davis; Robert Poole; Middleton (camel driver); E. Palmer (bullock
driver); Bell and Wylde; and Frank, an aboriginal. It left
<span class="a">Adelaide</span> on 16<i>th August</i>, 1861. The
work of the expedition had already been done by Howitt, although
the news had not yet reached Adelaide. On 20th October, McKinlay
found human remains (27&deg; 15' S.; 140&deg; E.), which must
have been those of Gray, although, misled by cock-and-bull
stories told by the blacks in circumstantial detail, he regarded
them as evidence of the massacre of the whole of Burke's party,
followed by a cannibal orgy. He had a rather serious encounter
with the <span class="a">natives</span> three days later.
Hodgkinson was shortly afterwards sent back on a mission to
Blanche Water Station, in South Australia, and on his return, in
about five weeks, brought the news of Hewitt's rescue of King.
McKinlay next found Hewitt's camp and visited the graves of Wills
and Burke.</p>
<p>Leaving the region which had already yielded up its story,
McKinlay determined to get on the track of Burke further north.
According to his diary he ran up the "Mueller River" (the
<span class="a">Diamantina</span>) to its head (22&deg; 40' S.
lat., 8<i>th April</i>, 1862). It is now understood that he
actually came up the <span class="a">Hamilton River</span>, east
of Boulia, crossed the <span class="a">Selwyn Range</span> by
"<span class="a">McKinlay's Gap</span>," and ran for some
distance northward down the "<span class="a">McKinlay
River</span>." (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-r">MAP
R.</a>) He probably followed the McKinlay (which, lower down, is
called the Gilliat) down to its junction with the <span class=
"a">Cloncurry</span> (30<i>th April</i>), which latter river
here, and here only, runs, as described by him, from west to
east, its general course being from south to north. Twenty-five
miles below the junction, <i>viz.</i>, at Caroline Creek, the
<span class="a">Cloncurry</span> River approaches the
<span class="a">Flinders River</span> (which lies east of it),
and for the next 32 miles of their northerly course the two
rivers are seldom as much as 4 miles apart. In fact, now that the
rivers have deployed on the coastal plains, the usual
"anastomosis" has commenced, and from the Cloncurry eastward,
high floods would connect that river with channels running into
the Flinders, the Saxby and the Norman Rivers.</p>
<p>Keeping the left, or western, bank of the Cloncurry River,
McKinlay crossed and named the <span class="a">Dugald
River</span> (2<i>nd May</i>, 1862). He had been practically on
Burke and Wills' track since he struck the Cloncurry, but
observed no trace of the lost expedition. By the time he crossed
the Dugald, however, he must have been fully convinced that the
river he was following, lead where it might, was not taking him
to the Albert Inlet, although Burke and Wills had believed they
were on the Albert when they reached the sea 72 miles east of
that inlet. He, therefore, steered north-west from the Dugald
River and, on 6<i>th May</i>, struck Gregory's <span class=
"">Leichhardt River</span> in 18&deg; 55' S. lat. (7 miles below
the modern <span class="a">Lorraine</span> cattle station). He
then followed the Gregory down to the north (past the modern
<span class="a">Augustus Downs</span> station) to the sea (Camp
60, 18<i>th</i>-21<i>st May</i>, 1862). (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-m">MAP M.</a>) This camp was
probably between the <span class="a">Albert Inlet</span> and
<span class="a">Landsborough Inlet</span>, the latter of which
connects the Albert with the Leichhardt. In spite of the mistake
which he was now aware Burke must have made, McKinlay had to
visit the Albert Inlet, where he might chance to meet the parties
which were to come by sea and commence the search from the Gulf.
He saw a tree which had marked <span class=
"a">Landsborough's</span> Camp 5 in February, 1862.</p>
<p>He had now proved that the Albert was <i>not</i> the river
which Burke and Wills had followed to the sea: the ship which had
conveyed Landsborough's expedition had already left the inlet.
His provisions were diminishing to danger-point; he knew that the
lost men had been found, and there was no further reason why he
should linger. Therefore, as his rations would not suffice to
carry him back to Adelaide, he made for <span class="a">Port
Denison</span>, then the northmost known harbour on the east
coast.</p>
<p>Retracing his steps up the Leichhardt, he crossed to the right
bank about 6 miles north of the site of the present <span class=
"a">Floraville Telegraph Office</span>. Thence, on an eastward
course, differing little from Gregory's (1856) and Walker's
(December, 1861), he came, on 5<i>th June</i> (Camp 12), to a
large, broad creek, or mass of creeks, or river&mdash;the
Flinders. His 14th Camp (7th-11th June) was on the <span class=
"a">Norman River</span> (which he named), opposite Gregory's camp
of 10th September, 1856, and Walker's camp (No. 48) of 24th
November, 1861. From the Flinders, he travelled, mainly E. by S.,
crossing the range (sandstone on granite) dividing tributaries of
Belmore Creek from tributaries of the Gilbert River.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-l">MAP L.</a>)</p>
<p>[The modern Croydon township is on Belmore Creek, about 10
miles north of McKinlay's track, and is the centre of the
goldfield which was opened in January, 1886, in consequence of
the discovery of payable gold by W. C. Brown, the owner of
Croydon Downs cattle station, and the brothers T. and R.
Aldridge. In 1887, the population was about 6,000. <b style=

<p>The range which McKinlay crossed south-east of Croydon was
named by him the <span class="a">Gregory Range</span>. It has
since proved fairly rich in reef <span class="a">gold</span> and
stream <span class="a">tin</span>. McKinlay was under the
erroneous impression that the waters draining the south-western
side of the range represented the principal head of the Flinders.
Turning to the south-east, he struck the <span class="a">Gilbert
River</span>, which he provisionally called Stuart Creek, being
unaware of the name it already bore. He followed the Gilbert to
the south-east till the <span class="a">Percy River</span> fell
in, and traced the latter north-eastward to its source
(<span class="a">Percyville</span>, now a gold and copper-mining
centre). (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-p">MAP P.</a>)
From the head of the Percy River, McKinlay appears to have kept
the same north-easterly course, crossing the <span class=
"a">Copperfield River</span> near the modern mining township of
<span class="a">Kidston</span>, and the <span class=
"a">Einasleigh River</span> south of the now "old" (but then
nonexistent) <span class="a">Carpentaria Downs</span> station.
Then, crossing the "<span class="a">Great Dividing Range</span>"
(here unimportant) between the Gulf and Pacific Waters, he got on
the head of the <span class="a">Dry River</span>, and followed
it, and the <span class="a">Burdekin River</span>, into which it
flows, down to the junction of the <span class="a">Belyando
River</span>, practically on Gregory's tracks. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-o">MAPS O</a> AND <a href=
"#map-q">Q.</a>) All the way down the Burdekin, dray tracks were
seen, but no settlers were met with. The last of the <span class=
"a">camels</span> was killed for food on 31st July and the horses
were by this time reduced to nineteen. This day he and his party
buried "everything but the clothes they stood in."</p>
<p>On 2<i>nd August</i>, 1862, McKinlay reached civilisation at
<span class="a">Harvey and Somers' Station</span> on the
<span class="a">Bowen River</span> (a tributary of the Burdekin).
Five miles further they reached <span class="a">Strathmore
Station</span>, where Messrs. Sellheim <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> and Toussaint, the owners, entertained
them hospitably for a week. Near the station was a camp of
<span class="a">Native Police</span>, under a white sergeant.
Troopers were sent back for the valuables buried on the
Burdekin.</p>
<blockquote>[1) P. F. Sellheim, afterwards a Police Magistrate
and Goldfield Warden, and Undersecretary for Mines.]</blockquote>
<p>The party embarked at <span class="a">Port Denison</span> on
17<i>th August</i>, 1862, in the "<i>Ben Bolt</i>" (80 tons),
Captain Tom McEwin, for <span class="a">Rockhampton</span>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it may be mentioned that Port Denison was
discovered by the "<i>Burdekin Mouth</i>" party in 1860, and
Bowen was founded in 1861.</p>
<p>Westgarth refers to the discovery of <span class="a">Jimmy
Morrill</span> about six months after McKinlay's arrival at Port
Denison. Morrill was the sole survivor of twenty-one men who left
the wrecked "<i>Peruvian</i>" in 1846 and landed from a raft on
the north side of Cape Cleveland, in which neighbourhood he lived
among the blacks for the next sixteen years. Merrill's
experiences form the subject of a pamphlet written by himself,
and of considerable ethnological value. (<i>James Morrill. A
Sketch of a Residence among 'the Aboriginals of North Queensland
for Seventeen Years</i>. Brisbane, Courier Office, 1863, 8vo, pp.

<p>Q<small>UEENSLAND</small> was separated from New South Wales
in 1859. The Governor of the new colony, <span class="a">Sir
George Bowen</span>, on his return from a voyage to the northern
ports, recommended <span class="a">Somerset</span>, Cape York, as
the site of a settlement, "on account of its geographical
importance, as harbour of refuge, coaling station and
<i>entrep&ocirc;t</i> for the trade of Torres Strait and the
North Pacific." <span class="a">Mr. John Jardine</span>, then
Police Magistrate and Gold Commissioner at Rockhampton, was
placed in charge of the new settlement as "Government Resident"
and a detachment of marines was landed in 1863.</p>
<p>Gradually as it became evident that the prevailing industries
of the new settlement were destined to be chiefly maritime,
<span class="a">Thursday Island</span>, off the mainland of Cape
York, became the chief dep&ocirc;t for the ships engaged in the
search for pearls, pearl-shell and <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> and
the seat of Government was eventually transferred to the
island.</p>
<p>Shortly after his installation, Mr. Jardine foresaw the
necessity for a regular supply of <span class="a">fresh
meat</span> to the new settlement, and proposed to the Government
to send his two sons, Frank (22) and Alick (20) overland with a
herd of cattle to form a station from which it might be supplied.
The proposal was agreed to and the Government instructed a
surveyor to accompany the expedition.</p>
<p>With all the advantages of health and youth, and above all, of
training from their childhood in the bushmanship which Australia
requires and bestows, the two brothers were unusually well
qualified to lead such an expedition as that on which they were
about to embark. For them no glamour of romance shone in the far
north to lure them to adventure. Their object was strictly
business. Their attitude towards the natives was from the first
fair and considerate, but on the other hand they were determined
to "stand no nonsense." The lessons unintentionally taught by
Leichhardt and Kennedy had not been thrown away upon the young
explorers. They chose their line of advance with a view to its
capacity for the support of travelling cattle.</p>
<p>In the sixteen years that had elapsed since Kennedy had set
out from Rockingham Bay, the settlement of northern Queensland
had made rapid strides. Ports had been opened at <span class=
"a">Mackay, Bowen, Cardwell</span> and <span class=
"a">Somerset</span>, and pastoral occupation was approaching the
Gulf of Carpentaria. The whole of the <span class="a">Cape York
Peninsula</span>, however, was still unoccupied except for the
settlement at its extreme northern point, and the <span class=
"a">Brothers Jardine</span> were destined to be the <span class=
"a">first to traverse it</span> from end to end. The ill-starred
<span class="a">Kennedy</span>, as we have already seen, almost
succeeded, but laid down his life within a few miles of the
goal.</p>
<p>The younger brother, <span class="a">Alick</span>, led a party
of ten, with thirty-one horses, overland from Rockhampton (14th
May, 1864) to Bowen (17th June). Six more <span class=
"a">horses</span> were added when the elder brother, <span class=
"a">Frank</span>, joined the party at Bowen on 16th July and five
more belonging to <span class="a">Mr. Richardson</span>, the
Surveyor, brought the total up to forty-two. The <span class=
"a">cattle</span> were collected at Bowen, and, as opportunity
offered, between Bowen and <span class="a">Carpentaria
Downs</span>. The latter station, which had recently been taken
up by <span class="a">J.G. Macdonald</span>, was at that time the
<span class="a">northmost</span> dwelling-place along the
Jardines' <i>route</i>, and they selected it as the spot where
their expedition was to be finally mobilised.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">party</span> which left Carpentaria Downs
included: Frank Lascelles Jardine; Alick Jardine; Archibald J.
Richardson (Surveyor); C. Scrutton; R. N. Binney; A. Cowderoy and
four black boys named Eulah, Peter, Sambo and Barney; ten persons
in all. They carried "provisions estimated to last, with care,
four months." The main item was 1,200 lb. of flour. The "mob" of
cattle numbered about 250 head of bullocks and cows.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Carpentaria Downs Station</span> of these
days was the <span class="a">"Old" Station</span>, now shown in
the 16-mile map in 18&deg; 37' 10" S. lat., while the modern
station, of which I saw the beginnings in 1886, is also shown on
the map in 18&deg; 44'. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-p">MAP P.</a>) It was situated on the right, or eastern,
bank of the <span class="a">Einasleigh River</span> which was
then believed to be Leichhardt's "<span class="a">Lynd</span>." A
station higher up the valley, to the south, still retains the
latter name.</p>
<p>While waiting for his brother at Carpentaria Downs,
<span class="a">Alick Jardine</span> set out on 3<i>rd
September</i> to reconnoitre the <i>route</i> to be followed by
the expedition down the <span class="a">supposed Lynd
River</span>. He was accompanied by <span class="a">Harry
Bode</span> (who was on the look out for cattle country), his own
black boy "Eulah" and Mr. Bode's black boy. It may be mentioned
that I met Mr. Bode in 1879 when he was residing near Bowen.
<span class="a">Alick Jardine</span> traced the river for 180
miles, to north-west and west, and from the fact that it had not
joined Leichhardt's Mitchell River, and other circumstances, he
satisfied himself that it was <span class="a">not the
Lynd</span>, and the name "<span class="a">Einasleigh</span>" was
conferred on it. No adventure marked the outward journey. On the
return two parties of <span class="a">natives</span> were met
with, but they displayed no hostility. The party <span class=
"a">returned</span>, on 21st September, <span class="a">to
Carpentaria Downs</span>, where they remained till the arrival of
Frank Jardine, with the cattle, on 6th October.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Jardine Brothers</span> kept <span class=
"a">diaries</span> which were afterwards <span class=
"a">edited</span> by <span class="a">Frederick J. Byerley</span>,
Staff Surveyor, Rockhampton, a gentleman whom I afterwards knew,
and who was gifted with literary talents which made the task a
congenial one. Byerley's amplification of the diaries, under the
title of <i>Narrative of the Overland Expedition of the Messrs.
Jardine from Rockhampton to Cape Fork, Northern Queensland</i>,
was published in Brisbane by J. W. Buxton in 1867.</p>
<p><span class="a">Richardson</span> also kept a <span class=
"a">diary</span> and charted the <i>route</i> travelled, and a
paper by him, entitled <i>An Overland Expedition from Port
Denison to Cape York under the Command of F. and A. Jardine,
Esqrs.</i>, was read before the Royal Geographical Society of
London on 27th November, 1865. The paper was accompanied by a
<span class="a">map</span> on the scale of 40 miles to an inch
showing the <i>route</i> followed by the main expedition. As he
always accompanied the main caravan, he had no first-hand
information to give regarding the numerous and important
<i>reconnaissances</i> of the brothers.</p>
<p><span class="a">Byerley's</span> publication also includes a
<span class="a">map</span> (on a 38-mile scale), which is
practically Richardson's, with the addition, however, of
<span class="a">Kennedy's</span> <i>route</i> and with the
omission of the Lynd River (of Leichhardt's charting). Regarding
<span class="a">Kennedy's</span> <i>route</i>, as charted by
Byerley, it may be observed that it differs considerably from the
<i>route</i> as I have charted it, by the aid of surveys which
were nonexistent in Byerley's time.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">expedition</span> finally <span class=
"a">left Carpentaria Downs</span> on 11<i>th October</i>. It is
only possible to give a short summary of the incidents and
observations made by the travellers until they come within the
region which is more immediately the subject of this review.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-k">MAP K.</a>)</p>
<p>Between the 11th and 22nd October, the caravan had covered 120
miles <span class="a">down the Einasleigh Valley</span>, the
<span class="a">last camp</span> (No. 13) being near the right
bank of the river about 5 miles above the point where the
Etheridge River, coming from the south, falls into the
Einasleigh. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-l">MAP
L.</a>) In this portion of their course, except for the last day
and a half, the travellers found exceedingly rough country, their
choice of evils often being between barren ridges and a river bed
hemmed in by basaltic cliffs or flowing over high bars of
granite; both horses and cattle suffered severely and the cows
began to calve.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">blacks</span> gave no actual trouble,
although they had to be carefully guarded against. About fifty of
them, "painted and fully armed," dogged the heels of the party on
15th and 16th October from Cawana Swamp to opposite Barney's Nob.
Another "mob" was surprised on the 18th and decamped with their
weapons, which included spears and a large stone axe. On the
following day, near the lower junction of the anabranch named
<span class="a">Parallel Creek, human remains</span> were seen
roasting on a fire. "Whether this was the body of an enemy cooked
for food or of a friend disposed of after the manner of their
last rites must," says Frank, "remain a mystery until the country
and its denizens become better known." On the 21st, two blacks
were seen spearing fish. It was judged advisable that the
<span class="a">cattle and</span> the majority of the
<span class="a">horses</span> should <span class="a">rest and
feed</span> at Camp 13 while the brothers reconnoitred the
proposed course. The valley had now become more open and it was
surmised that a way might be found to the north, whereas the
Einasleigh was now bearing them steadily westward. It is now
known that the <span class="a">Einasleigh</span> falls into the
right bank of the <span class="a">Gilbert River</span> about 50
miles west of the Jardines' Camp 13. To <span class="a">one of
the Mouths of the Gilbert</span>, <span class="a">Accident
Inlet</span>, <span class="a">Jan Carstenszoon</span>, on the
Dutch ship "<i>Pera</i>" gave the name of the <span class=
"a">Staten River</span> on 24th April, 1623.</p>
<p>The following is a brief summary of the <span class=
"a">itinerary</span> of the expedition from Carpentaria Downs
"Old Station" to the mouth of the Etheridge River, as read in the
light of modern maps:&mdash;</p>
<p>11<i>th October</i>, 1864. <span class="a">down Einasleigh
River</span>, NW. Byerley says 20 miles, Richardson 19. Distance
by map, 14 miles. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-p">MAPS P</a> AND <a href="#map-k">K.</a>)</p>
<p>At 5 miles passed <span class="a">Mount Eulah</span> (now
called <span class="a">Mount Harry), Camp</span> No. 1, a mile N.
of junction of <span class="a">Copperfield River</span>, near
<span class="a">Einasleigh Copper Mine</span> and <span class=
"a">Einasleigh Station</span> on the modern <span class=
"a">railway</span> from Chillagoe to the Etheridge. Richardson
gives <span class="a">latitude</span> of camp as 18&deg; 23' 59",
which is 7 miles too far north.</p>
<p>12<i>th October</i>. Shifted to <span class="a">Camp</span> 2,
1&frac12; miles down the <span class="a">Einasleigh</span>.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-k">MAP K.</a>)</p>
<p>13<i>th October</i>. Travelled NNW. down the <span class=
"a">Einasleigh</span>. Passed the <span class="a">Mount Alder
Gold Diggings</span> of the future. Passed lagoon now known as
"<span class="a">Jardine's Lagoon," Camp</span> 3, on a small dry
creek (<span class="a">Lighthouse Creek</span>?). Distance
travelled 11 miles (B.), 10 miles (R.)</p>
<p>14<i>th October</i>. Travelled 11 miles NNW. down the
<span class="a">Einasleigh. Camp 4</span> on junction of
<span class="a">Canal Creek</span> with the river. The creek is
described as "deep, sandy and dry, 80 yards wide, coming from
ENE., its banks steep, and lined with immense Melaleuca trees";
"also," says Byerley, quoting Jardine, "some magnificent
Leichhardt trees." The only creek that would answer to this
description is the one now called <span class="a">Junction
Creek</span>, in which case the distance travelled is understated
by 5 miles, and the camp is on the site of the modern
<span class="a">Amby Cattle Station</span> opposite the
<span class="a">Einasleigh Hot Springs</span>.</p>
<p>15<i>th October</i>. Travelled 8 miles NNW., a mile or two
from the right bank of the Einasleigh. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 5 is among the hills called by the Brothers the
<span class="a">Jorgensen Range</span> and the western edge of a
swamp which they called <span class="a">Cawana Swamp</span>.
Richardson gives the <span class="a">latitude</span> as 18&deg;
2' 7", which may be taken as correct.</p>
<p>16<i>th October</i>. Travelled NW.: 11 miles (R.), 10 miles
(B.): winding through the <span class="a">Jorgensen Range.
Camp</span> 6, at the point where <span class="a">Warroul
Creek</span> falls into <span class="a">Parallel Creek</span>,
which here leaves the <span class="a">Einasleigh River</span> as
an anabranch, to fall in again 22 miles lower. Warroul Creek has
got into the maps as <span class="a">Elizabeth Creek</span>, and
was identified by W. Hann in 1872 as the creek on which
<span class="a">Mount Surprise Cattle Station</span> was
situated. <span class="a">Mount Surprise</span> is now a
<span class="a">station</span> on the Chillagoe-Etheridge
<span class="a">Railway</span>.</p>
<p>17<i>th October</i>. <span class="a">Parallel Creek</span> is
separated from the Einasleigh River by a high ridge of
<span class="a">basalt</span>. Travelled WNW. down Parallel Creek
8 miles (B.), 7&frac12; miles (R.). <span class="a">Camp</span> 8
was in bed of creek (Byerley calls it Camp 8, although really
Camp 7, and his numbering is followed with the object of
facilitating reference to his narrative).</p>
<p>18<i>th October</i>. WNW., down <span class="a">Parallel
Creek</span>, which had now become a gorge. 10&frac12; miles
(R.), 10 miles (B.). <span class="a">Camp</span> 9.</p>
<p>19<i>th October</i>. W. by N. 8 miles. Midway, the lower
confluence of <span class="a">Parallel Creek</span> with the
<span class="a">Einasleigh</span> was passed. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 10 on an alluvial flat on right bank of river.
The <span class="a">latitude</span> given by Richardson (17&deg;
45' 40" S.) is about right. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-l">MAP L.</a>)</p>
<p>20<i>th October</i>. WNW., 11 miles down the <span class=
"a">Einasleigh</span>. At 6 miles crossed the mouth of
<span class="a">Galaa Creek</span> (now on the map as
<span class="a">Martin Creek</span>) and got out of the stony
country. From 7 to 11 miles, low sandstone ridges. <span class=
"a">flood-marks</span> 30 feet above river. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 11.</p>
<p>21<i>st October</i>. WNW., 11 miles down the river. Good
travelling. <span class="a">Desert sandstone</span> tablelands to
north and (according to modern maps) also to south. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 12.</p>
<p>22<i>nd October</i>. W., 10 miles down the river. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 13, on a creek which was named <span class=
"a">Cooroora Creek</span>, but does not appear on modern maps,
was half a mile north of the river and about 5 miles east of the
point where the <span class="a">Etheridge River</span> falls into
the southern, or left, bank of the Einasleigh. Richardson gave
the <span class="a">latitude</span> as 17&deg; 34' 32", which
must be nearly correct, and estimated, after plotting his
<i>route</i>, that the <span class="a">Camp</span> was 18 or 20
miles SSW. of <span class="a">Leichhardt's Lynd River</span>. The
actual distance is about 53 miles, but the inaccuracy of
Leichhardt's charting was mainly responsible for the
miscalculation.</p>
<p>Had the Brothers Jardine followed their <span class=
"a">Einasleigh River</span> a few miles further they would have
seen it <span class="a">joined by the Etheridge</span>. Fifty
miles west of the confluence, the conjoined stream meets the
river which Leichhardt named the <span class="a">Gilbert</span>,
and this name is retained till the river waters discharge into
the Gulf nearly a hundred miles west. The Einasleigh has actually
a longer course than the Gilbert, but historical considerations
have determined that the Gilbert be regarded as the main stream
and the Einasleigh as a tributary. <span class="a">Accident
Inlet</span>, one of the many <span class="a">mouths of the
Gilbert</span> (in 17&deg; 13' S. lat.) was the "furthest south"
of the "<i>Pera</i>" and "<i>Aernem</i>" and was consequently
named the <span class="a">Staten Revier</span> by Carstenszoon in
1623.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> Brothers, according to their diary,
accompanied by Eulah, left Camp 13, on the <span class=
"a">Einasleigh</span>, on 24<i>th October</i>, 1864, and after
majormitchelling <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> to the north,
northeast and north-west, returned on the 27<i>th</i>, having
failed to find the <span class="a">Lynd River</span>.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-l">MAP L.</a>) They had
made about 40 miles of northing and had struck the creek which
they named <span class="a">Byerley Creek</span> (now mapped as
the <span class="a">Red River</span>) and another which they
named <span class="a">Maroon Creek</span>, and which appears in
modern maps as the head of the <span class="a">Staten
River</span>. <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> This <span class=
"a">Staten River</span>, <i>de facto</i>, and which will, no
doubt, be so called for all time, is <i>de jure</i>, the
<span class="a">Nassau</span>, one of its mouths (17&deg; 24' S.
lat.) having been named the <span class="a">Nassau Revier</span>
by Jan Carstenszoon on 26th April, 1623. <span class="a">Byerley
Creek</span>, or Red River, is a tributary of the <span class=
"a">Staten River</span>, <i>de facto</i>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) This expressive verb, indicative of a method of
exploration favoured by Major (afterwards Sir Thomas) Mitchell,
was in common use among Australian bushmen in the "seventies,"
when I first made their acquaintance.&mdash;<span class=
"u">R.L.J.</span>]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) Carstenszoon spelt the name Staten, which
spelling, except in quotations, I retain. In modern Dutch, the
double "a" is correct, but in 1623 spelling was no more fixed in
Holland than it was in England.]</blockquote>
<p>Had the Brothers struck north-east from their 10th or 11th
Camp, on the Einasleigh, they would have reached <span class=
"a">Leichhardt's Lynd River</span> in less than 30 miles. Beyond
Camp 11, the chance was lost, as the courses of the two rivers
diverge, the Einasleigh to the west and the Lynd to
north-north-west. The Staten River, <i>de facto</i>, north of the
Einasleigh, flows mainly west, while the Lynd runs to
north-north-west, and is east of the heads of the Staten, <i>de
facto</i>.</p>
<p>On their way back to Camp 13, the reconnoitring party blazed a
track to guide the party with the cattle to Byerley Creek.</p>
<p>After their return to Camp 13, the Brothers discussed the
situation with Richardson, who contended that the <span class=
"a">Einasleigh River</span>, which they had by this time traced
for 50 miles, could be no other than the <span class=
"a">Lynd</span>. It is unfortunate that a question of this sort
should have been discussed with heat; but so it was. The Brothers
lost confidence in the Surveyor, who, on his part, performed his
duties in a half-hearted and perfunctory manner and, as it were,
under protest, for the remainder of the journey.</p>
<p>On the 29<i>th</i>, the <span class="a">Brothers</span>,
accompanied by <span class="a">Eulah</span>, set out on a further
<i>reconnaissance</i> to the north. Having crossed <span class=
"a">Byerley Creek</span> (the <span class="a">Red River</span> of
modern maps), they gave the name of <span class="a">Maroon
Creek</span> to what is now known to be the head of the
<span class="a">Staten River</span>, <i>de facto</i> (the
<span class="a">Nassau River</span>, <i>de jure</i>). Further
north, they came on a creek running, like their Maroon Creek, to
the north-west, and named it <span class="a">Cockburn
Creek</span>. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-h">MAP
H.</a>) The latter is a tributary, or head, of the Staten, <i>de
facto</i>, as is also Byerley Creek, which, before it falls into
the Staten River, <i>de facto</i>, bears the names of Red River
and Wyaaba Creek in parts of its course.</p>
<p>The reconnoitring party penetrated northward, as far as can be
made out, to about 16&deg; 35' S. lat. (approximate longitude
143&deg; 5' E.), having for some distance been travelling almost
parallel with the long-sought-for <span class="a">Lynd</span>.
They <span class="a">turned back</span> about 15 miles south of
the <span class="a">Mitchell</span>, and on 3rd November reached
the lagoons on <span class="a">Byerley Creek</span> (the Red
River, <i>de facto</i>), to which the body of the expedition had
by this time moved, in two stages, making this their <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 15. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-l">MAP L.</a>) The majority of the men who had been with
the cattle were now suffering from <span class=
"a">ophthalmia</span>. The shade temperature was 90&deg; at
daylight and 103&deg; at noon.</p>
<p>On 4<i>th November</i>, <span class="a">Byerley Creek</span>,
now admitted not to be the Lynd, was crossed within half a mile
north of Camp 15. <span class="a">Camp</span> 16 was about
4&frac12; miles further north, on what was named <span class=
"a">Belle Creek</span>.</p>
<p>On 5<i>th November</i>, the <span class="a">Brothers</span>,
accompanied by <span class="a">Binney, Eulah</span> and
<span class="a">Barney</span>, went ahead with the cattle and
having marked a line of trees for 15 miles to the north, camped
for the night, with the cattle, at <span class="a">Maroon
Creek</span> (head of the <span class="a">Staten River</span>,
<i>de facto</i>), in which there was no water. Some of the horses
had been missing when the cattle left Camp 16. These having at
length been collected, <span class="a">Richardson, Scrutton and
Cowderoy</span> brought them along, but were too late in the day
to overtake the cattle. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-h">MAP H.</a>) While they were unpacking and preparing camp
(a dry camp, No. 17, some distance south of the Staten, <i>de
facto</i>), the <span class="a">grass took fire</span>, with the
result that 420 lb. of flour, almost all the tea, 100 lb. of
rice, jam, apples and currants, a box of cartridges and caps, 2
tents, 1 pack-saddle, 22 pack-bags, 14 surcingles, 12 leather
girths, 30 ring pack-straps, 2 bridles, 2 pairs of blankets,
clothing and needles, awls, twine, etc., were destroyed. The most
heroic exertions were required to save the rest of the stores.
Scrutton is said to have snatched some of the powder canisters
from the fire with the solder melting on the outside.</p>
<p>While waiting at <span class="a">Maroon Creek</span>
(<span class="a">Staten River</span>, <i>de facto</i>) for the
party to whom this misfortune occurred, the <span class=
"a">Brothers</span> and their three companions had an anxious and
trying time. At their camp, only a trifling amount of water had
been obtained by digging, not enough even for their own horses.
They could not go back to look for the men left behind, whose
delay they could not understand. They had to go forward and find
water for the cattle.</p>
<p>On the 6<i>th</i>, the <span class="a">Brothers</span> marked
a line, while their companions drove the cattle to <span class=
"a">Cockburn Creek</span>, where they camped (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 18); and still the men did not arrive with the
horses and packs. They remained the two following days at Camp
18, still awaiting the two parties left behind, and came near
starvation. They succeeded, however, in killing three small
"opossums" on the 7th and in shooting a calf on the 8th. On the
latter day, twenty or thirty of the cattle were found to be
missing, and "Maroon," a stallion designed for stud purposes,
died of <span class="a">poison</span> or <span class=
"a">snake-bite</span>. On the 9<i>th</i>, <span class=
"a">Alick</span> went back and met the rear party.</p>
<p>On 10<i>th</i> and 11<i>th November</i>, the <span class=
"a">Brothers</span> and <span class="a">Eulah</span> followed
<span class="a">Cockburn Creek</span> down for 38 miles <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> to the north-west, instructions having
been left for the rest of the party to follow with the cattle and
pack-horses. On the 12<i>th</i>, about 9 miles further on the
same course, they found two sandy water-courses, which they
supposed to be the heads of the Mitchell, but which must have
been branches of the <span class="a">Staten River</span> ( <i>de
facto</i>). Then, striking out to north by west, they crossed 16
miles of barren inundable country to <span class="a">Maramie
Creek</span>, so named, in the aboriginal language, because of
the abundance of fresh-water crabs.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Modern mapping shows that the distances must have
been over-estimated.]</blockquote>
<p>On the 13<i>th</i>, the Brothers followed <span class=
"a">Maramie Creek</span> down for 25 miles to WSW. Nothing but a
waste of tea tree and spinifex was to be seen, and it was evident
that this was no country for travelling cattle.</p>
<p>On 14<i>th November</i>, the Brothers struck south and came on
"what they supposed to be the Mitchell, which was afterwards
ascertained to be the Staten of the Dutch navigators, or one of
its heads" (<i>Byerley</i>, p. 19). As already mentioned, the
river is the "<span class="a">Staten</span>," <i>de facto</i> and
not <i>de jure</i>.</p>
<p>Here the <span class="a">natives</span> for the first time
evinced a threatening disposition. Running the river up from the
point where they had struck it (8 miles below the junction of
Cockburn Creek), the little party of explorers was followed for 3
miles by a noisy crowd of armed blacks. "Getting tired of this
noisy pursuit, which might at any moment end in a shower of
spears, the Brothers turned on reaching a patch of open ground,
determined that some of their pursuers should not pass it. This
movement caused them to pause, and seeming to think better of
their original intention, they ceased to annoy or follow the
little party, which pursued its way for 5 miles further, when
they camped in the bed of the stream."</p>
<p>The character of the country to which the Jardines had now
penetrated had entirely changed. The littoral of the southern end
and eastern side of the Gulf of Carpentaria is a network of
salt-water inlets, which if nothing were known of their
hinterland, might be supposed to be the delta of a single
gigantic river. The inlets, however, prove to be the <span class=
"a">anastomosing mouths</span> of a great number of rivers which
take their rise in the high ground to the south and east. Any one
of the rivers may be followed down with confidence till it enters
the deltal plain, whereupon it splits up into anabranches, which
sooner or later coalesce with similar anabranches of other
rivers. On the other hand, a traveller who attempted to follow
any inlet of the sea up to its head, would find himself, within
the deltal area, in a maze of anabranches. With no fingerpost to
guide him, he might, for example, turn to the right and find
himself on the Norman, or to the left and find himself on the
Gilbert. Moreover, any two travellers crossing the <span class=
"a">network of deltal anabranches</span>, say from south to
north, on parallel courses a few miles apart, would form quite
different ideas as to what were "main streams" and what were mere
"tributaries." An anabranch might in one place contain a long
deep water-hole, and a few miles distant be only a barely
distinguishable hollow. It may be stated that the mouths of the
Nicholson, Gregory, Albert, Leichhardt, Flinders, Norman,
Gilbert, Staten, <i>de facto</i>, Dunbar, Mitchell, Coleman,
Holroyd and Archer Rivers anastomose.</p>
<p>For this reason, the rivers named by the Jardine Brothers, who
kept as much as possible on the upper edge of the delta out of
consideration for their cattle, are difficult of identification,
even with the aid of modern maps.</p>
<p>On 15<i>th November</i>, the <span class="a">Brothers</span>
and <span class="a">Eulah</span> moved up and found the
<span class="a">main camp</span> (Camp 18) settled on
<span class="a">Cockburn Creek</span> about 25 miles above its
confluence with the Staten, <i>de facto</i>. Richardson gives the
latitude of the camp as 16&deg; 46' 5" S.</p>
<p>On the 16<i>th</i>, the now <span class="a">united
expedition</span> followed <span class="a">Cockburn Creek</span>
down (NW. by W.) for about 11 miles and camped (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 23). <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) The numbers of the camps are as given by the
Brothers. Richardson gives none, except in his map. The
expedition was usually split up into two or three parties which
camped at different places.</blockquote>
<p>On the 17<i>th</i>, a further move of 5 miles was made to
where <span class="a">Cockburn Creek</span> falls into the
<span class="a">Staten River</span> (<i>de facto</i>), which the
Brothers took for the Staten and Richardson for the Lynd.
<span class="a">Camp</span> 24 was 6 miles down the river below
the junction. At this camp <span class="a">Scrutton</span> "was
bitten in two or three places by a <span class=
"a">scorpion</span>, without, however, any very severe effects."
The camp of the 18th, No. 25, was about 8 miles further down the
river. The next camp, No. 26, was made on the 19th, 11 miles
further down.</p>
<p>On the 20th, 9 miles further west, <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> the party having been compelled to camp
early in the afternoon owing to a deluge of rain (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 27), was <span class="a">attacked</span> by about
a score of <span class="a">natives</span> and there were some
narrow escapes, one spear passing between Cowderoy's legs. Two
shots in reply, although they missed their aim, dispersed the
assailants.</p>
<blockquote>[2) Distances obviously much exaggerated, probably
owing to windings of the river and difficulties.</blockquote>
<p>21<i>st November</i>, 1864. The camp was shifted 3 miles to
the west, to a spot where there was some grass and plenty of
water (<span class="a">Camp</span> 28). Thirteen of the horses
were missing in the morning and were not found till the 27th. The
<span class="a">blacks</span> had been among them and had
scattered them all over the country, and they were "wild as hawks
"and had broken their hobbles.</p>
<p>On the 22<i>nd</i>, as <span class="a">Frank Jardine</span>
was riding out alone looking for good travelling for the cattle,
he was <span class="a">attacked</span> by <span class=
"a">natives</span>, who threw half a dozen spears at him. When he
had shot three of the natives, the remainder (about nine) fled,
leaving their weapons behind. The black boy Sambo was assailed by
three natives who, after a boastful harangue, threw spears. The
pinch of starvation now began to threaten and stern restrictions
were imposed: on the consumption of rations. Kites hovered around
the camp in myriads and grew so bold as to snatch the meat
cooking on the fire.</p>
<p>Camp 28, where the party was compelled to stay for seven days,
was a very undesirable residence. Mosquitoes, sandflies and
gadflies tormented the explorers, who had worries enough on their
minds. The final misfortune was the loss, on the night of the
26th November, of fifteen cattle owing to the carelessness of the
man in charge, who slept on his watch. Only seven of the cattle
were recovered.</p>
<p>Finally, when a start was made on the 27th, one of the horses
was missing and had to be left behind. <span class="a">Frank
Jardine</span> rode on, on the north side of the river, ahead of
the party, looking for good travelling and a suitable camp. Nine
miles down the river he passed a number of <span class=
"a">natives</span>, who seemed indifferent to his presence, but 2
miles further on he met seven more and a spear flew past, within
six inches of his face. He shot one of his assailants. Shortly
afterwards, he crossed to the other side of the river and met the
other members of the party, who had also been attacked by the
natives in force. They had killed or wounded several of their
assailants. The distance travelled down the river (westward) was
estimated by Richardson at 8 miles. <span class="a">Camp</span>
29 (infall of Emu Creek from the south).</p>
<p><span class="a">Camp</span> 30 (28<i>th November</i>) was 9
miles further down the river. The poverty of the country
travelled and its obvious liability to be inundated gave rise to
much misgiving, as the wet season was now drawing nigh.</p>
<p>On 29<i>th</i> and 30<i>th November</i>, <span class="a">camps
31 and</span> 32 marked stages of 9 and 11 miles respectively
down the river. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Camp 32 was
within a quarter of a mile of the left bank of <span class=
"a">Maramie Creek</span>, near its junction with the <span class=
"a">Staten River</span> (<i>de facto</i>).</p>
<blockquote>[1) Distances uniformly over-estimated, as proved by
comparison with the total distance between the mouths of Cockburn
and Maramie Creeks.]</blockquote>
<p><span class="a">Camp</span> 33, 10 miles down the river, was
made on 1<i>st December</i>. This day two parties of <span class=
"a">Blacks</span> were seen <span class="a">fishing</span> in the
river with four-pronged spears and also lines and hooks, the
latter made of wood barbed with bone.</p>
<p>On 2<i>nd</i> and 3<i>rd December</i>, the expedition moved on
to <span class="a">Camps 34 and 35</span>, over stages of 10 and
6 miles respectively. At the last-named camp, the river had
become a <span class="a">salt-water estuary</span>, and the hope
that it would turn to the north and lead them in the desired
direction was finally abandoned by the Brothers. On the
4<i>th</i>, the camp was moved 2 miles WNW. to good feed close to
the mangroves. <span class="a">Camp</span> 36 (<span class=
"a">Leichhardt's camp</span> of 5th July, 1845).</p>
<p>The long-drawn dispute between the Brothers Jardine and
Richardson over the identification of the river which they had
followed to the west since Cockburn Creek fell into it, was now
brought to an end. It was admitted by Richardson that its course
lay altogether west of the Lynd and that Leichhardt's Mitchell
River was still to the north. It was, in fact, a new and distinct
river. The Brothers proposed to name it the "Ferguson" after Sir
George Ferguson Bowen, first Governor of Queensland (there was
already a "Bowen" river), although they erroneously believed it
to be identical with the Staten River of the Dutch navigators.
For the last mistake the Jardines were not responsible, as the
Admiralty charts of their day placed the Staten where the mouth
of the "Ferguson" really is, as do the charts still in use. The
name "Ferguson" never was adopted, and officially in the maps of
the Lands Department, the river is still known as the Staaten. It
falls into the Gulf where the <span class="a">Nassau
Revier</span> was placed by the Dutch in 1623. <span class=
"a">The Dutch Staten Revier</span> is <span class="a">Accident
Inlet</span>, one of the mouths of the <span class=
"a">Gilbert</span>. Modern Lands Department maps, following
Flinders' chart, confirmed by King, erroneously place the Dutch
Nassau Revier in 15&deg; 55' S. latitude, the inlet in that
position (on which is the "Nassau Landing" for Lochnagar and
Dunbar cattle stations) being <span class="a">Dunbar
Creek</span>, one of the many mouths of the <span class=
"a">Mitchell River</span>.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> meagre diet of the camps at the mouth of
the Staten River, <i>de facto</i>, was varied by the addition of
shark's flesh, which was jerked (sun-dried), together with the
flesh of a bullock which was killed.</p>
<p>The position of the party was now very serious. The
<span class="a">horses</span> were leg-weary and emaciated, and
both they and the <span class="a">cattle</span> were falling off
owing to the insufficiency of food and were rapidly diminishing
in numbers. Trying to progress to the north the party had been
forced to march further and further to the west till they reached
the mangrove swamps of the Gulf littoral. In the flat country
where they now found themselves, ominous <span class="a">flood
marks</span> on the trees proclaimed that at any moment the water
might rise above the heads of the travellers. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-h">MAP H.</a>) At least one large
river, the <span class="a">Mitchell</span>, was known to cross
their path to the north. And the <span class="a">wet
season</span> might set in to-morrow, if reliance could be placed
upon what was then known of meteorological conditions in Northern
Queensland. The supply of farinaceous <span class="a">food</span>
was already limited and had been seriously diminished by fire.
Finally, the hostility and treachery of the <span class=
"a">aboriginal inhabitants</span> had to be taken into
consideration. The Brothers must have marvelled day by day, as
every explorer of these regions has done, why the blacks did not
compass their death by the simple expedient of killing their
horses when the latter strayed from the camps in search of grass.
Thanks only to the limited intelligence of the natives, this
method of warfare does not appear to have suggested itself.</p>
<p>It is probable enough that the Brothers themselves, their
black boys and some of the white men, might, if the blacks had
let them alone, with their skill in bushmanship, have contrived
to subsist for a time on the natural products of the country even
if they had lost all the cattle and horses, as well as their
rations. But the savages would certainly have waited for the time
when relaxed watchfulness, hunger and fatigue would make them an
easy prey, as in the case of Kennedy.</p>
<p>Everything pointed emphatically to the necessity for an
immediate <span class="a">change of course</span> to the north,
with a leaning to the east, to escape from a country subject to
periodical, and now imminent, <span class=
"a">inundation</span>.</p>
<p>With much rejoicing, the whole expedition turned their backs
on their Camp 36, on the <span class="a">Staten River</span>,
<i>de facto</i>, on 5<i>th December</i>, 1864, and after crossing
sand flats and sandy ridges covered with tea tree, camped in a
dry swamp (<span class="a">Camp</span> 37), say 10 miles
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> from Camp 36. This camp must
have been very near <span class="a">Leichhardt's camp</span> of
4th July, 1845, in 16&deg; 15' 11" S. lat. A little slimy green
water was, however, found about 2&frac12; miles to
north-north-west.</p>
<blockquote>[1) F. Jardine says 13; Richardson 12. Both
continually over-estimate distances made, though perhaps not
distances covered. At Camps 35, 36 and 37, the Jardines must have
been on or near Leichhardt's track of 6th and 7th July,
1845.]</blockquote>
<p>Next morning (6<i>th December</i>), half the <span class=
"a">horses</span> were <span class="a">missing</span>, and the
camp was shifted to the green water (<span class="a">Camp</span>
38). After having been packed for this short journey, a very
useful <span class="a">mule</span> slipped away and got lost,
carrying with him a load of "indispensable" articles. He only got
ten minutes' start, but he travelled faster than a black boy
could track his footprints.</p>
<p>The Brothers found nine of the horses at Camp 35 and camped
there for the night, without food or blankets, and with myriads
of mosquitoes for company. They returned to Camp 38 next day
(7<i>th December</i>), to learn that five of the horses and the
<span class="a">mule</span> were still <span class=
"a">missing</span>, Sambo and Binney having searched for them in
vain. Sambo had been two days without food or water, and was
<span class="a">delirious</span>, but when sufficiently recovered
to speak, he stated that he had followed the mule's tracks to the
back of Camp 35, when he was obliged to return.</p>
<p>On 8<i>th December</i>, <span class="a">Alick Jardine</span>
and <span class="a">Sambo</span> set out in the direction of Camp
35. They found four of the five lost horses, one of them, named
"Lucifer," at Camp 35, quite mad (it was supposed from drinking
salt water.)</p>
<p>On resuming the search next morning (9th December), Alick and
Sambo met Eulah and Barney, who had also seen the <span class=
"a">mad horse</span>. Sambo and Barney were sent after the mule,
and Alick and Eulah came in sight of "Lucifer," but only
succeeded in knocking up their mounts in pursuit of him. They
then returned to Camp 38, with the recovered horses.</p>
<p>In the meantime (8<i>th December</i>), <span class="a">Frank
Jardine</span> had been out 18 miles to the north of Camp 38,
hoping to find water on the desired <i>route</i>, but without
success, and the prospect of driving the cattle over dry country
was disheartening. On 10<i>th December</i>, Frank Jardine and
Eulah rode westward from Camp 38 for 6 miles, when they found
themselves on extensive marine plains and downs. After 19 miles
more, mainly south (and probably over the site of the modern
cattle-station named <span class="a">Mentana</span>) they came on
"Lucifer's" track and found the place where he had been drinking
salt water and lying down. They followed the tracks for fifteen
miles and camped without water.</p>
<p>From daylight on the following day (11<i>th December</i>),
Frank and Eulah followed the tracks, mostly on foot, leading
their horses, and were thus led, at sundown, to Camp 33, on the
<span class="a">Staten</span>, <i>de facto</i>. Here, for the
first time since they left Camp 38, they found water. It was
brackish, but it satisfied a two days' thirst. While they were
trying to catch something to eat, the elusive "Lucifer" was seen,
but he galloped away at once. Frank mounted his horse and,
heading the mad animal, drove him back to Eulah's horse, "but to
no purpose, for he galloped past without taking the least notice
of him, and as it was now dark they had to let him go." "Lucifer"
was again tracked next day (12<i>th</i>) and was found at noon 13
miles off. He was white with perspiration, and it was surmised
that he had galloped the whole distance. He was, besides, still
quite mad, and Frank made up his mind to leave him behind. The
remaining <span class="a">horse</span>, "Deceiver," was found
shortly afterwards&mdash;<span class="a">dead</span>, whereupon
the tired and hungry men made their way back to <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 38.</p>
<p>"<span class="a">Lucifer</span>" and "<span class=
"a">Deceiver</span>," says Byerley, were the two best riding
horses, and the <span class="a">mule</span> the best pack-animal.
His own loss was aggravated by his carrying his pack with him.
This carried most of the odd <span class="a">articles</span> that
were hitherto <span class="a">deemed indispensable</span>, but
which henceforth they had perforce to dispense with. One pack
contained all that remained of the tea, currants and raisins
saved from the fire and two pairs of boots&mdash;the only ones
the Brothers had; and the other was filled with oddments, such as
files, gimlets, ragstone, steel, weighing maching, awls,
tomahawks, American axes, shoeing tools and a number of things
that they could not do without; but perhaps the most important
loss was that of the spade, to which they had many times been
indebted for water. The losses also included the mallet and
chisel with which the successive numbers of the camps had
hitherto been cut on trees.</p>
<p><span class="a">Alick</span> had spent a day (11<i>th
December</i>) in searching for <span class="a">water</span>, and
was rewarded by finding it in a creek 8 miles north-north-west of
Camp 38. One day's march in the right direction was thus
secured.</p>
<p>During the detention at Camp 38, Richardson determined the
variation of the compass to be 4 degrees east (misprinted "40
degrees" in Byerley). Previously he had been allowing 6
degrees.</p>
<p>To the other considerations which so urgently dictated a
forward movement, was now added the <span class=
"a">illness</span> of <span class="a">Scrutton</span> and
<span class="a">Cowderoy</span>, brought on by drinking the
impure water of Camp 38.</p>
<p>The party fared forth on 13<i>th December</i>, and in 8 miles
reached the place where water was known. Alick, however, riding
ahead of the main body, had come on water four miles further on,
in what was probably <span class="a">Leichhardt's "Rocky
Creek</span>," and the cattle were brought on. A disappointment
ensued when the water turned out, although covered with
<i>nymphea</i>, to be salt. Good water was luckily found a mile
up the creek to the east (<span class="a">Camp</span> 39). At
this camp a fine barramundi was caught and six whistling ducks
were shot.</p>
<p>With the intention of striking the Mitchell about the head of
the tide, the course was altered next day (14<i>th December</i>)
to north-east. Water was passed at 5 miles and 9 miles from Camp
39, and <span class="a">Camp</span> 40 was pitched on a
well-watered creek at 14 miles (<span class="a">Dunbar
Creek</span>). Richardson gives the latitude of the camp as
15&deg; 56' 31" S.</p>
<p>The position assigned to Camp 40 is on what is called the
"<span class="a">Nassau River</span>" in the 4-mile map (1910)
and in the "Tenure Map" (December, 1911). As has already been
pointed out, the <span class="a">river so called by
Carstenszoon</span>, in 1623, is that <span class="a">which the
Jardine Brothers followed down from Camp 24 to Camp 36</span>.
Modern maps show that the water-course (15&deg; 53' S. lat.),
erroneously named the Nassau River (the <span class="a">Nassau,
de facto</span>), is <span class="a">one of the mouths of the
Mitchell River</span>, which leaves the main stream at
<span class="a">Burke's Lagoon</span>, near Dunbar cattle
station, and is there known as <span class="a">Dunbar Creek.
Camp</span> 40 may, therefore, be placed with confidence on
<span class="a">Dunbar Creek</span>. Between their 38th and 39th
camps, the Brothers must have crossed the (apparently
insignificant) water-course which, some 10 miles to the west,
becomes the Revier Nassau (16&deg; 10' S. lat.) and which
Carstenszoon, of the" <i>Pera</i>" named on 29th April, 1623. It
is now too late to give effect to the claim of this <span class=
"a">Staten River</span>, <i><span class="a">de jure</span></i>,
for recognition.</p>
<p>On 15<i>th December</i>, a stage of 22 miles was made to the
north-east, over better country than had been met with for some
time, part of it being <span class="a">sandstone ridges</span>
rising above the level of the inundable land. Four or five miles
from Camp 40, a creek was passed falling to the west, which the
Brothers proposed to call Arbour Creek, but which does not appear
on Richardson's map, or on Byerley's. At 19 miles a halt was made
at a dry swamp, which now appears on the maps as the
"<span class="a">Scrutton River</span>," running out of the main
stream of the Mitchell below Dunbar Creek and joining
<span class="a">Dunbar Creek</span> (the Nassau River, <i>de
facto</i>), midway between Camp 40 and the Gulf. Eulah, having
been sent ahead, found a good site for a camp 3 miles further,
and the caravan pushed on to it (<span class="a">Camp</span> 41).
"It was," says Byerley, "well worth the extra fatigue to the
stock. They were rewarded by an excellent camp, plenty of green
<span class="a">grass</span>, open country, and <span class=
"a">water</span>, which was alike acceptable to men and beasts.
The creek received the name of <span class="a">Eulah
Creek</span>, in honour of the discoverer." It was not, however,
so named in Richardson's map or Byerley's, and is called
"<span class="a">Magnificent Creek</span>" in modern maps.</p>
<p>Probably the Jardine Brothers passed through this country in
an unusually bad season, and it was lucky for them. Had they not
been ready to perish from <span class="a">thirst</span> in
crossing the inundable country they would have run a serious risk
of <span class="a">drowning</span>.</p>
<p>Yet it is evident from the subsequent course of occupation
that the country traversed by the interlacing and anastomosing
<span class="a">mouths of the Mitchell River</span> is not
worthless, as it seemed to its first explorers. In good seasons
at least, the coastal plains afford abundant <span class="a">food
for stock</span>, and the Brothers' experience of 15th December
indicates the existence of <span class="a">elevated sandstone
plateaux</span> to which stock may retreat in times of flood.
Moreover, there is almost a certainty that the <span class=
"a">artesian water</span> area of Normanton is prolonged in that
direction, although the coastal alluvium makes it impossible to
see the outcrop of the basal beds of the Lower Cretaceous strata.
The area in question, according to modern maps, now contains
cattle stations at <span class="a">Old</span> and <span class=
"a">New Mentana, Dunbar, Kalka, Lochnagar, Rutland Plains</span>
and <span class="a">Koolata</span>, as well as the <span class=
"a">Mission Station of Trebanaman</span>. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-f">MAP F.</a>)</p>
<p>From Camp 41 to Camp 42, the company travelled about 6 miles
north-eastward on 16<i>th December</i>. The two Brothers, riding
ahead, had barely gone a mile when they were confronted by a
party of <span class="a">natives</span>, who jeered and
brandished spears. A stand was made and eight or nine fell to the
rifle fire, whereupon the remainder retired. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 42 was on an anabranch of the <span class=
"a">Mitchell River</span>, running NNW., "its bed in some parts
densely timbered, the foliage rich and luxuriant: in others there
are fine sheets of excellent water. Leichhardt's melaleuca,
fan-leaved palm and fig trees, some of the latter bearing ripe
fruit, also vines and tropical trees unknown to me" (Richardson,
p. 33).</p>
<p>On 17<i>th December</i>, about 7 miles were travelled to
northwest, among the channels of the <span class=
"a">Mitchell</span>. One of these, about midway, was taken to be
the "<span class="a">main stream</span>." It is described thus by
Richardson: "Bed 500 yards wide, sandy, and two channels, some
water, not running, banks low, and flood marks above them; the
foliage of the trees on both sides is very dense and rich in
various shades of green. The latter part of our journey bore some
resemblance to a deserted garden, which had contained many choice
plants and trees, acacia, bauhinia, Leichhardt, and fan-leaved
palm, the latter numerous, also cedar." Game was plentiful,
including wallabies, native companions, duck, and Torres Strait
pigeons. <span class="a">Camp</span> 43 was on a flooded gum
flat. Here one of the cows died from the effects of some
<span class="a">poisonous plant</span>.</p>
<p>The story of the 18<i>th December</i> is given in Byerley's
words (p. 35), which cannot be abridged or paraphrased:</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"18<i>th December</i>. The river was
followed down to-day for 9 miles through a complete network of
anabranches, gullies, and vine scrubs to another branch, which
may be called the true stream. It was 30 yards wide, deep, and
running strongly. Here the party had to camp for about 3 hours,
whilst the Brothers searched for a good crossing. The cattle and
pack-horses were crossed in safety, but some of the pack-bags got
wetted in the passage. They were travelled another mile over to a
sandstone bar, crossing another deep sheet of water that had been
previously found. This stream had been explored in search of a
ford for 4 miles further up but without success. It continued of
the same width and appeared to do so much further. This day,
Sunday, was marked by the severest conflict the travellers had
yet had with the natives, one which may well be dignified by the
name of the '<span class="a">Battle of the Mitchell</span>.' On
arriving at the running stream before mentioned, whilst the
cattle halted, the Brothers and Eulah, taking axes with them to
clear the scrub, went down to find a safe crossing. At about a
mile and a half they came on to a number of blacks fishing: these
immediately crossed to the other side, but on their return, swam
across again in numbers, armed with large bundles of spears and
some nullahs, and met them. The horsemen, seeing they were in for
another row, now cantered forward towards the camp, determined
this time to give their assailants a severe lesson. This was
interpreted into a flight by the savages, who set up a yell, and
redoubled their pursuit, sending in the spears thick and fast.
These now coming much too close to be pleasant (for some of them
were thrown a hundred yards), the three turned suddenly on their
pursuers, and galloping up to them, poured in a volley, the
report of which brought down their companions from the camp, when
the skirmish became general. The natives at first stood up
courageously, but either by accident or through fear, despair or
stupidity, they got huddled in a heap, in, and at the margin of
the water, when ten carbines poured volley after volley into them
from all directions, killing and wounding with every shot with
very little return, nearly all their spears having been expended
in the pursuit of the horsemen. About thirty being killed, the
leader thought it prudent to hold his hand, and let the rest
escape. Many more must have been wounded and probably drowned,
for fifty-nine rounds were counted as discharged. On the return
of the party to the cattle an incident occurred which nearly cost
one of them his life. One of the routed natives, probably burning
with revengeful and impotent hate, got into the water under the
river bank, and waited for the returning party, and as they
passed threw a spear at Scrutton, before anyone was aware of his
proximity. The audacious savage had much better have left it
alone, for he paid for his temerity with his life. Although the
travellers came off providentially without hurt, there were many
narrow escapes, for which some of them might thank their good
fortune. At the commencement of the fight, as Alexander Jardine
was levelling his carbine, a spear struck the ground between his
feet, causing him to drop his muzzle, and lodge the bullet in the
ground a few yards in front of him. His next shot told more
successfully. There were other equally close shaves, but
providentially not a scratch. This is one of the few instances in
which the savages of Queensland have been known to stand up in
fight with white men, and on this occasion they showed no sign of
surprise or fear at the report and effect of fire-arms, but it is
probable that they will long remember the 'Battle of the
Mitchell' (Camp XLIV). Course NNW. Distance 7
miles."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>The camp was probably on the <span class="a">Alice
River</span>, about 3 miles west of the modern <span class=
"a">Koolatah Station</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">tactics of the aborigines</span> consist
mainly of <span class="a">ambuscades and harassment of the
rear</span> of travelling parties. It is rarely, as Byerley
observes, that they venture to stand up in bodies to fight.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Mitchell River</span> was followed down to
the north-west on 19<i>th</i>, 20<i>th</i> and 21<i>st
December</i>, <span class="a">Camps 45, 46 and 47</span>,
representing stages of 13, 11 and 9&frac12; miles. The head of
the <span class="a">salt water</span> was found between Camps 45
and 46. Heavy <span class="a">rain</span> fell on 20<i>th</i> and
21<i>st</i>.</p>
<p>At sunset on the 21<i>st</i> it was discovered that the
<span class="a">Blacks</span> were "<span class=
"a">stalking</span>" the party at the camp, under cover of
screens of boughs. The Brothers, Scrutton and the four black boys
mounted and <span class="a">pursued the natives</span> for a
couple of miles, driving them at last into the scrub, but using
no fire-arms. At the conclusion of the chase, two dozen abandoned
spears were collected along the line of retreat.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Mitchell River</span> <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> was finally <span class="a">left
behind</span> on 22<i>nd December</i> and the camp was pitched 15
miles to the north (lat. 15&deg; 2' 10" S.) "at a puddle without
a blade of grass" (<span class="a">Camp</span> 48). <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) The river was surveyed for the Department of
Lands by Mr. J. T. Embley, in April, 1887.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) If the latitude is correct, the distance must
have been greatly over-estimated.]</blockquote>
<p>In the locality attributed to Camp 48, the modern map (Sheet
20B) sketches a water-course about to fall into the Gulf, and
obviously suggests that this water-course is the Coleman River.
Mr. Embley informs me that he is not responsible for the sketch
or the suggestion, and that he only traced the Coleman down
(westward) to a point 30 miles east of the coast. He believes, in
fact, that flood waters of the Coleman flow southward into the
Mitchell by courses indistinguishable in normal dry weather.</p>
<p>The following day (23<i>rd December</i>) there was
<span class="a">heavy rain</span>. "Twelve miles of wretched
country were traversed, white sandy undulating ground, clothed
with shrubs and underwood in the place of grass, and the
<span class="a">Camp</span> pitched on a low stringybark ridge,
<span class="a">without water</span>, for in this flat sandy
country the ground absorbs the rain as soon as it falls. The
horses had to be watched again to-night, for there was not a
blade of grass to be got. A small quantity of water was found in
a creek about a mile and a half ahead. Late in the evening the
horses and water-bags were taken to it, and sufficient water
brought back for the use of the camp" (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 49).</p>
<p>On 24<i>th December</i> the journey was continued 7 miles to
the north and Camp 50 was pitched on a ridge timbered with
bloodwood and stringybark. The grass was poor, but it was better
than none (<span class="a">Camp</span> 50). This camp cannot have
been far south of the <span class="a">Edward River</span>
surveyed by Mr. J. T. Embley in 1885. That river runs westward
between the <span class="a">Coleman</span> and <span class=
"a">Holroyd Rivers</span> and very likely is to be connected with
one or other or both.</p>
<p>25<i>th December</i>. The <span class="a">rain</span> which
had set in the night before, continued to fall heavily during the
whole of Christmas Day. In spite of this, 15 miles were gained to
the north. At 7 miles, was a creek in which some swamp mahogany
trees (balourgah) were growing. The creek at 15 miles was named
"<span class="a">Christmas Creek</span>." It ran in a rocky
bottom and was well watered, and blue grass was plentiful on its
banks (<span class="a">Camp</span> 51). In the course of his
traverse in 1885, Mr. Embley sketched Balourgah and Christmas
Creeks as joining&mdash;or rather parting&mdash;a few miles above
(east of) the Brothers' line of march and as being probably
mouths of the Edward River to the south, while Christmas Creek is
joined just above the Brothers' crossing by a water-course which
emanates from the Holroyd River to the north. Thus mouths of the
Edward and Coleman Rivers appear to be confluent.</p>
<p>26<i>th December</i>. The rain still continued but was not
heavy enough to prevent travelling, and a further stage was made
to the north and the night's camp was made on <span class=
"a">Hersey Creek</span>, "a splendid sheet of water in a rocky
creek, 80 yards wide and very long" (<span class="a">Camp</span>
52). According to the Brothers, the distance travelled this day
was 13 miles and according to Richardson 12 miles, whereas their
maps agree in showing the distance between Christmas and Hersey
Creeks to be not more than 5 miles. Perhaps the name Hersey Creek
should be applied to another mouth of the Holroyd River, 9 miles
north of that to which the name is attached on modern maps. The
matter could probably be settled satisfactorily by some one on
the spot who might be able to identify the long water-hole among
the rocks. It is not in any case a matter of great importance,
and the <i>de facto</i> may be accepted as the <i>de
jure</i>.</p>
<p>On 27<i>th December</i>, the party made a northing of 10 miles
to a small creek with water for the men and horses but not enough
for the cattle (<span class="a">Camp</span> 53). This may have
been the other mouth of the <span class="a">Holroyd River</span>
above referred to.</p>
<p>28<i>th December</i>. The cattle satisfied their thirst 5
miles north of Camp 53, at a fine sheet of water in the river
which the Brothers named <span class="a">Holroyd Creek</span>.
The river is described as having a sandstone bed with several
channels. Two miles further north was another similar stream
which was named <span class="a">Dunsmuir Creek</span>. Both
streams are channels of the <span class="a">Holroyd River</span>
which was surveyed in September, 1885, by Mr. Embley. The upper
reaches of this river were named the Lukin River in 1875 by
Mulligan. The river rises far to the east in the Hamilton
Goldfield.</p>
<p>Four miles north of the Holroyd River (inundable box flats),
<span class="a">Thalia Creek</span>, a salt-water inlet, was met
with. On following the creek up to the east for a mile and a
half, <span class="a">Camp</span> 54 was pitched on a lotus
lagoon, where the water was only slightly brackish.</p>
<p>The party had hardly settled down in Camp 54 and were digging
trenches and making such other preparations as they could for an
impending thunderstorm, when the <span class="a">black boy</span>
who had been tailing the cattle, came in with the report that he
had been <span class="a">pursued by natives</span>, who were now
engaged in <span class="a">"running" the horses</span>. The
Brothers and Scrutton rushed out and found the horses flying
about in all directions, while a party of natives waited for the
men. "When the distance had been reduced to 60 yards,
<span class="a">spears</span> began to fly and were answered by
Terry <span class="a">breech-loaders</span>. The blacks (some of
whom were observed to be unusually tall) ultimately retired,
having paid for their gratuitous attack by the loss of some of
their companions" (Byerley, p. 40). "The <span class=
"a">thunderstorm</span> now broke with great violence, and the
frightened <span class="a">cattle stampeded</span> from the camp.
The rain continued to fall heavily until midnight."</p>
<p>There is a very unsatisfactory discrepancy between the
narratives of Frank Jardine and Richardson concerning the
proceedings of 29th, 30th and 31st December. I am inclined to
follow Richardson, as his sole business was to chart the progress
of the main caravan, while the Brothers Jardine went
"majormitchelling" in search of country which would be safe in a
time of floods, and perhaps their notes were not very
intelligible to their editor, Byerley.</p>
<p>From <span class="a">Thalia Creek</span> (Camp 54) it appears
that Richardson and the cattle on 29<i>th December</i> travelled
ENE. for about 4 miles, when a <span class="a">tidal
river</span>, 40 yards wide, was met with. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-d">MAP D.</a>) Frank Jardine, on a
NNE. course, had struck it further west, where he estimated the
width of the stream at 100 yards. The river was followed up by
Richardson, the pack-horses and the cattle for 1&frac12; miles
before it could be forded. In the next 51 miles, on the ENE.
course, the inundable tea-tree flats began to be varied by low
ridges covered with bloodwood. <span class="a">Camp</span> 55 was
pitched beside a tea-tree swamp. Heavy rain fell at night.
<span class="a">Thalia Creek</span> and the "<span class=
"a">tidal river</span>," I take it, must be mouths, perhaps the
most important mouths, of the <span class="a">Kendall
River</span>, <i>de facto</i>, which was run down by Mr. Embley
in February, 1886, as far west as the 142nd meridian of east
longitude. This Kendall River, <i>de facto</i>, according to Mr.
Embley, is the most considerable water-course in the district,
but I am of opinion that he was mistaken in identifying it with
the water-course to which Jardine gave the name of <span class=
"a">Kendall Creek</span>.</p>
<p>Ten head of <span class="a">cattle</span> had been
<span class="a">missing</span> when Frank Jardine left Camp 54,
and as they had not been recovered, he determined on his return
to Camp 55, to wait there while they were searched for. The
search proved fruitless, and "as it would have been madness to
have remained longer in such dangerous country," the cattle were
finally left behind. "The country," says Byerley, "was all alike,
and they were satisfied beyond doubt that it must be <span class=
"a">one sea during the rains</span>." On the night of the
30<i>th</i>, the camp was visited by a rain-and-wind <span class=
"a">storm</span> of unusual severity.</p>
<p>On 31<i>st December</i>, the distance travelled from Camp 55
was estimated at 12 miles on a general course of ENE.&frac12;E.
Two miles from Camp 55, a <span class="a">creek</span> was met
with, 50 yards wide, with steep banks and water 3 feet deep.
(<span class="a">Queensland 4-Mile Map, Sheet 20D.</span>) It was
named <span class="a">Kendall Creek</span>, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> after a friend of Richardson's, although
Frank Jardine seems to have considered it identical with a creek
further to the west which he had seen the day before, and which
he named the <span class="a">Macleod</span>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) In 1879-80 I believed the "Coen" (South Coen) of
the Goldfield to be the head of what Richardson had named Kendall
Creek. In this I was mistaken, as the South Coen has since been
ascertained to be a tributary of the Archer River.]</blockquote>
<p>Richardson's Kendall Creek was followed up for 3 miles to the
east before it could be forded, and the journey could be
continued on the desired course of NNE.&frac12;E.</p>
<p>As plotted from Richardson's narrative, his Kendall Creek
practically coincides with what appears on the modern map as
"<span class="a">Sinclair Creek</span>, G 52-4." This
<span class="a">Sinclair Creek</span>, <i>de facto</i>, has
apparently been named on a mistaken identification with the creek
so named by Jardine (<span class="a">Sinclair Creek</span>, <i>de
jure</i>), which is further north.</p>
<p>The remainder of the journey of 31st December (5 miles
NNE.&frac12;E.) was on bloodwood and stringybark forest country
alternating with tea-tree flats. The latter were now bogs, owing
to the rains. <span class="a">Camp</span> 56 was on the left, or
southern, bank of the <span class="a">Kendall</span>, <i>de
jure</i> (<span class="a">Sinclair</span>, <i>de facto</i>).</p>
<p>What must be called the <span class="a">Kendall River</span>,
<i>de facto</i> (see southeast corner of Sheet 20D and north side
of Sheet 20B of Queensland 4-mile Map), has been surveyed by Mr.
Embley, in 1886, as far down as the western boundaries of
"Dunning" and "Lockton" runs (142&deg; E. long.). From this
point, the supposed seaward course of the river is indicated in
the modern 4-mile map by a dotted line running about 12 miles
towards Cape Keerweer (WNW.). Mr. Embley informs me that this
conjecture is not his. It is more than likely that Jardine's
Thalia Creek, Tidal Inlet, Macleod Creek and Kendall Creek
(Kendall Creek, <i>de jure</i> = Sinclair Creek, <i>de facto</i>)
reach the Gulf between the Holroyd River and <span class="a">Cape
Keerweer</span>, where the "men of the '<i>Duyfken</i>'" turned
back in 1606, and where the "men of the '<i>Pera</i>'" landed on
5th May, 1623, and were attacked by the natives.</p>
<p>1<i>st January</i>, 1865. The <span class="a">Kendall</span>,
<i>de jure</i>, <i>i.e</i>., what the Brothers called Kendall
Creek and the modern map names Sinclair Creek, was crossed a mile
above their Camp 56 and a course of NE.&frac12;N. was pursued
through bloodwood and stringybark forest on ridges of red sand
resulting from the decomposition of sandstone. Twelve miles on
this course took the party to <span class="a">Camp</span> 57, on
the small and canal-like <span class="a">New Year Creek</span>
coming from the NE. and running S. by E. Four miles short of the
camp another water-course was named <span class="a">Sinclair
Creek</span>. It looks as if the two creeks were one and the
same. A heavy rain set in during the afternoon and lasted till
midnight.</p>
<p>Sheet 20D of the 4-mile map shows an isolated east and west
line 5 miles long, marked "<span class="a">Sinclair Creek</span>,
G 52-4," about 7 miles south-west of Camp 56 (which camp the
information to be gleaned from the Jardine and Richardson diaries
places approximately in 14&deg; 1' S. and 142&deg; E.). A creek
in the position indicated in the 4-mile map, although it may be
called the <span class="a">Sinclair, <i>de facto</i></span>,
would, in my opinion, in all probability be what Jardine, or,
rather, Richardson, named "<span class="a">Kendall Creek</span>."
What the Jardine Brothers named "Sinclair Creek" (<span class=
"a">Sinclair Creek, de jure</span>) lies to the north of Camp
56.</p>
<p>On 2<i>nd January</i>, the stage was 15 miles to NNE. over
country described by Frank Jardine as "an extensive plateau,
sloping away to the eastward, terminating abruptly in a
perpendicular wall, overlooking the valley on the head of which
the party camped." [Evidently a sandstone tableland.&mdash;R. L.
J.] He adds that the country covered on this and the previous day
"would make a <span class="a">fine cattle run</span>, being
watered at every 6 or 7 miles by running creeks, besides a large
swamp." <span class="a">Camp</span> 58, in 13&deg; 46' 46", was
pitched near the head of a small creek running NNE.</p>
<p>3<i>rd January</i>. The creek was followed down to NNE. for
3&frac12; miles till it fell into a larger creek, running WSW.,
which was named the "<span class="a">Kinloch</span>," after John
Kinloch, Mathematical Master of Sydney College. At 7 and 12 miles
from Camp 58, small, deep, running creeks were crossed, the first
by an improvised bridge. Four miles beyond the second of these
creeks, <span class="a">Camp</span> 59 was pitched. Its latitude
is given as 13&deg; 35' 54". The country traversed this day
consisted of sandstone ridges, timbered with bloodwood and
stringybark, with occasional ironbarks, zamias, pines and
grasstrees; in fact, the usual features of the <span class=
"a">Desert Sandstone tablelands</span>. The small creeks had a
fringe of banksias with a few "mahogany" trees. The escape of the
party from the inundable coast land must have been a source of
profound satisfaction. There was a heavy storm of rain and
thunder at night.</p>
<p>In consequence of the rain, the country traversed on the
following day (4<i>th January</i>) was boggy. The travellers soon
got on a river and its anabranches. <span class="a">Camp</span>
60 was on one of the anabranches, the total distance covered in
the day being 6 miles. Frank Jardine proposed to call this
water-course "<span class="a">Micketeeboomulgeiai</span>" ("the
place where the lightning struck"). Fortunately the name has not
stuck, to be a terror to future students of the gentle art of
orthography. It is, in fact, the river on which, 90 miles higher
up, is the centre of the <span class="a">Goldfield</span> which
its discoverers called the "<span class="a">Coen</span>." It is
<span class="a">not</span>, however, the <span class="a">Dutch
Coen</span>, but a tributary of the <span class="a">Archer
River</span>. The name "Coen" has been too long in use to be
changed, but the Lands Department has begun to call the river of
the goldfield the "<span class="a">South Coen</span>" to
distinguish it from the Coen proper.</p>
<p>On 5<i>th January</i>, the party travelled, in the rain, 14
miles N. by E., crossing at 5 miles a large river 200 yards wide,
and dry, in spite of the rains, which was named the <span class=
"a">Archer River</span>, and two of its anabranches. The valley
of this river is described by Frank Jardine as "of great richness
and beauty, and the <span class="a">best country for
cattle</span> seen north of Broadsound." "The banks," he
continues, "are fringed by a thick belt of vine scrub, containing
very many Leichhardt trees and other handsome trees and shrubs of
great luxuriance and growth." (Byerley, p. 43).</p>
<p>Of the <span class="a">Archer River</span>, Richardson (p. 38)
says: "I believe this river to be the same as that one
<span class="a">named</span> at its mouth the <span class=
"a">Coen by the Dutch</span>." The discoverers of the goldfield
to the south-east named it, as well as the river on which it
occurred, the <span class="a">Coen</span>, following Richardson's
suggestion; but their river is in reality only a tributary of the
Archer and neither river is the Coen of the Dutch. The inlet
named "<span class="a">Coen Revier</span>" by Jan <span class=
"a">Carstenszoon</span> on 8th May, 1623, is about 17 miles north
of the mouth of the Archer.</p>
<p><span class="a">Camp</span> 61 was pitched on a small
water-hole in a water-course running SSE.</p>
<p>6<i>th January</i> was a toilsome day for the horses, but 16
miles were gained to the north, through undulating country with
open box forest and some ironbark, bloodwood, acacia, sterculia
and pandanus. The ground was "rotten" from the rains, and yet the
<span class="a">water-courses</span> were <span class="a">too
sandy to retain water. a "range"</span> was sighted 5 or 6 miles
to the east&mdash;the escarpment of a fragmentary sandstone
tableland. The day's march was a little to the west of the
<span class="a">divide between</span> the <span class=
"a">Archer</span> and <span class="a">Watson Rivers</span>, and
across the heads of <span class="a">Merkunga and Gumbol
Creeks</span>, tributaries of the Watson. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 62 was on a little clay water-hole with barely
water enough for the men.</p>
<p>On 7<i>th January</i>, the stage was 15 miles, across
"numerous small water-courses similar to those of yesterday." "It
was strange," remarks Frank Jardine, "to see the horses bogging
leg-deep during a thunderstorm and in five minutes after unable
to get a drink of water." The course lay across <span class=
"a">Lagoon Creek</span>, the principal head of the <span class=
"a">Watson River</span> (about 10 miles west of the modern
<span class="a">Merluna Downs</span> cattle station, which has
recently been "nationalised" by the State Government), and
<span class="a">Say Creek</span>, a similar tributary of the
Watson, to the heads of <span class="a">Myall Creek</span>, which
enters <span class="a">Albatross Bay</span> under the name of the
<span class="a">Mission River</span>. <span class="a">Camp</span>
63 was on a small deep creek falling to NNW., but without much
water. Scrub turkeys, wonga wongas and Torres Strait pigeons were
seen.</p>
<p>The next day's journey (8<i>th January</i>) added 18 miles of
northing between <span class="a">Myall and Cox Creeks</span>,
both here running northward, the former to turn to the west and
become the <span class="a">Mission River</span> <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> and the latter to fall into the
<span class="a">Batavia River</span>, which runs to the
north-west and discharges into the Gulf. For the first 15 miles
there was "good undulating forest country, timbered chiefly with
box and apple-gum and a few ironbarks, and intersected with
numerous canal-like creeks running north-west. The last 3 miles
was wretchedly bad, being similar to the tea-tree country of the
Staaten" (<i>de facto</i>). "The whole country between the Archer
and Staaten is without water, save immediately after rain
sufficiently heavy to set the creeks running." <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 64 (lat. 12&deg; 38' 2" S.) was on a small
shallow tea-tree water-pan. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href=
"#map-b">MAP B.</a>) The night was marked by heavy rain and high
wind. Two of the horses were knocked up.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The Mission River was surveyed by Mr. Embley in
1897.]</blockquote>
<p>On 9<i>th January</i>, a distance of 16 miles was accomplished
to the north. A little more than half-way, a large <span class=
"a">river</span> was crossed 20 miles west of the modern
<span class="a">Moreton Telegraph Station</span>. The Brothers
believed this to be the <span class="a">Dutch Coen</span>, but
Richardson identified it correctly as the <span class="a">Batavia
River</span>.</p>
<p>A digression becomes necessary at this point.</p>
<p>It is distinctly stated in Carstenszoon's Diary of the Voyage
of the "<i>Pera</i>" that "the Coen Revier is in 13&deg; 7'
latitude," but a careful reading of the narrative shows that that
was the latitude of the anchorage of 7th May, 1623. A boat party
landed next morning, and followed northward the footprints of men
and dogs, which led them to a "revier" notable only for the fact
that esculent herbs a great prize for scurvy-haunted sailors grew
on its banks. They spent some time in walking, in collecting
herbs and finally in a skirmish with the natives when they
returned to the boat; and they were alongside the "<i>Pera</i>"
at midday. The "Coen," therefore, cannot be many miles north of
the boatlanding. Now it so happens that, in quite recent years,
members of the Mapoon Mission to Aborigines have located a small
<span class="a">inlet in</span> 13&deg; 4' N. <span class=
"a">lat</span>. (between Pera Head and the mouth of the Archer),
and I consider it practically demonstrated that this is
<span class="a">Carstenszoon's Coen Revier</span>. Unfortunately,
Flinders, in 1802, made a bad guess, and suggested that an inlet,
now known as the <span class="a">Pennefather River</span>, in
12&deg; 13' S. lat., was "probably the Coen R. of the old
charts," and the suggestion having been accepted without
question, much confusion has arisen. The subject of the true
location of the Coen is discussed in detail in Chapters VII,
LXXXV, and LXXXIX.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Batavia River</span>, as seen by
Richardson, is described by him as "running NW. by W., 120 yards
broad, sandy bed, 30 feet deep; water very clear and good,
running about 2 feet deep." Crocodiles were seen in it by the
Brothers Jardine. The head of the river is in 13&deg; 11' S. lat.
and 143&deg; 17 E. long. <span class="a">Plutoville</span>, the
centre of the "<span class="a">Batavia Gold Rush</span>," is
about 13 miles west of its source. Below this, the river, to the
north-west, cuts its way through the <span class="a">Desert
Sandstone</span> formation, and for a considerable distance
divides the sandstone shelves named by me in 1880 the
"<span class="a">Sir William Thomson Range</span>" and the
"<span class="a">Geikie Range</span>."</p>
<p>The Jardines' <span class="a">Camp</span> 65 was on a tea-tree
swamp north of the river.</p>
<p>On 10<i>th January</i>, the progress made was only 2&frac12;
miles to NNE. The greater part of the journey was on ridges
timbered with bloodwood and stringybark. The trouble began at a
watercourse running north-west, with the water knee-deep and the
gently sloping banks very boggy. The <span class="a">cattle sank
in the mud</span>. Four refused to face it and had to be let go.
Thirty or forty stuck fast and the greater part of the day was
spent in hauling them out with ropes. Five had to be abandoned
when only their backs and heads were out of the slough. The
horses came through the ordeal better, but their saddles and
loads had to be carried by the men. At <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 66, which was, of course, pitched on the nearest
piece of sound ground, the remainder of the day was spent in
drying the arms and loads and in jerking the beef of one of the
bogged bullocks. <span class="a">Heavy rain</span> fell at
night.</p>
<p>A stage of from 2 to 3 miles was the total result of next
day's toil (11<i>th January</i>).</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"After having travelled with the
greatest difficulty for 2 miles over execrable country, so boggy
as to be barely possible to traverse, their progress," says
Byerley (p. 45), "was stopped by a creek 25 yards wide, flooded
'bank and bank' and running like a mill sluice. This was the
River Batavia [a mistake: it was a tributary of <span class=
"a">Nimrod Creek</span>, which falls into the right bank of the
Batavia.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>]. The usual
formidable fringe of <span class="u">vine scrub</span> covered
the margin and approaches, and had to be cut through before the
cattle could cross. In addition, a large melaleuca which leant
over the stream, was felled across it, by means of which (by
tying a rope above it as a leading-line) they were enabled to
carry over the packs, saddles, stores, etc., on their heads. The
<span class="u">cattle, accustomed to swimming</span>, took the
water in splendid style, <span class="u">one</span>, however,
getting entangled and <span class="u">drowned</span>. With the
<span class="u">horses</span> they were not so fortunate, for
though a headstall was put on each, with a rope attached to the
bit, to haul them across, the rapidity of the current swept away
<span class="u">two</span> of them into a tangle of vines in the
middle of the stream, under which they were carried and
<span class="u">drowned</span>, despite the exertions of four or
five of the party to pull them across by the rope. Their efforts
to save them nearly cost their own lives, and A. <span class=
"u">Jardine</span> chronicles receiving a 'nasty crack' on the
head from a log in attempting to disentangle his own horse,
'Jack,' from the vines. The other, 'Blokus,' was a Government
horse, belonging to Mr. Richardson. Both were useful horses and a
great loss to the party, but only the forerunner of much greater
ones. The creek at last crossed, the party attempted to push
forward on the other side; but after travelling a mile leading
the horses, slushing through bog and swamp, under a heavy rain,
they were obliged to turn back and encamp on some high ground on
the banks of the creek, about half a mile above the crossing,
where there was a little good grass. Several of their horses were
left behind, one more in particular, 'Nell Gwynne,' being too
weak to travel." [<span class="a">Camp</span> 67.]</blockquote>
<br>
<p>This camp (Camp 67) was in the centre of what is now a
"<span class="a">Police Reserve</span>" of about 840 square
miles.</p>
<p>12<i>th January</i>. The <span class="a">horses</span> left
bogged on the previous day were got out, but <span class="a">five
died</span> from eating some <span class="a">poisonous
herb</span>, and one was missing and was supposed to have been
drowned. <span class="a">blindness</span> was one of the effects
of the poison. The remaining horses were confined in an
improvised yard. Owing to the loss of so many transport animals,
only one man, Binny, tailing the cattle, could now be allowed to
ride. Horseshoes and other articles were buried in a
"<i>cache</i>." The day was marked "<span class="a">Black
Thursday</span>" in the Leader's diary, and the entry closed with
the words "<i>Nil desperandum</i>."</p>
<p>The <span class="a">horses</span> were now reduced to
<span class="a">twenty-one</span>, and these the poorest and
worst, another of the malignant peculiarities of the poison being
that it attacks the animals which are in the best
condition&mdash;presumably because they eat more heartily.</p>
<p>"With stout hearts and naked legs," the Brothers Jardine,
Binney, Scrutton and the four black boys set out on 13<i>th
January</i> to face what further trials might be ahead of them,
for by this time their wardrobes had been reduced to shirt and
belt. A stage of 10 miles NE. by N. was made with the utmost
difficulty during the day. The country was composed of ridges of
red soil, divided by boggy black soil flats covered with tea
tree. "The <span class="a">cattle</span> floundered and
<span class="a">bogged</span> at every hundred yards, and even
the spare unladen horses had to be pulled out. The latter were at
length so completely knocked up that it was necessary to leave
some of them at one side of the swamp, the party carrying their
pack and loads about a quarter of a mile on to a dry ridge on the
other. Here they camped, and, tired as they were, they were
obliged to keep a vigilant watch, as, to add to their many
annoyances, the <span class="a">natives</span> had been following
them all day." (<span class="a">Camp</span> 68.)</p>
<p>On the 13<i>th</i> and 14<i>th</i> there had been no rain. By
the morning of the 14<i>th</i>, the swamp behind camp 68 had been
so much dried that the horses were got across without any great
difficulty. During the remainder of that day, however, in
crossing the teatree flats between the red-soil ridges, the
<span class="a">horses</span> again and again <span class=
"a">broke through the crust</span> and the packs had to be
unloaded and carried by the men. Two more <span class="a">horses
died</span> during the day from the effects of the <span class=
"a">poison</span>, leaving only nineteen. The camp was made a
little after midday (<span class="a">Camp</span> 69).
<span class="a">Rain</span>, the heaviest the party had yet
experienced, began shortly afterwards and lasted for three hours.
In the midst of preparations for the protection of the stores
from the deluge, some fifteen or twenty unarmed <span class=
"a">natives</span> came up to the camp and were <span class=
"a">chased away</span>.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"They were soon back again, however,"
says Byerley (p. 48), "with large bundles of <span class=
"">spears</span> barbed with fish-bones, but not before the party
had had time to prepare for them. The rifles were dry and loaded.
Frank Jardine here owns to a feeling of savage delight at the
prospect of having a 'shine' with these wretched savages who,
without provocation, hung on their footsteps, dogging them like
hawks all through the thickest of their troubles, watching, with
cowardly patience, for a favourable moment to attack them at a
disadvantage. Even then, however, he would not be the aggressor,
but allowed them to come within sixty yards and ship their
<span class="a">spears</span> in the <span class=
"a">wimmeras</span> before they were fired upon. The two foremost
men fell to the only two shots that were discharged, and their
companions at once broke and fled; nor was the advantage followed
up, as the travellers were careful to husband their ammunition,
and their caps were running short. This, however, was the
<span class="a">last occasion</span> on which the party was
molested, their sable adversaries having, probably, at last
learned that they were worth letting alone, and never again
showing themselves."</blockquote>
<p>The 15<i>th of January</i>, "being Sunday," was observed as a
day of rest, which was much needed by men and beasts. If the
party did not travel, neither were they guilty of "profaning the
day by idleness." Useful employment was found in <span class=
"a">spreading out the contents of the bags to dry</span>,
everything having become mouldy from the damp, and in
<span class="a">picking out pandanus thorns</span> from one
another's feet and legs. Heavy rain fell during the night and
three inches of water ran through the tents.</p>
<p>Very wisely, <span class="a">Richardson made no attempt to
chart the route between the Batavia River and the head of the
Jardine</span>, <i>i.e</i>., from Camp 67 to Camp 78, and the
reason is obvious. The expedition was boring through scrubs,
unable to see any distance ahead, floundering through bogs or
winding about to avoid them, and, in short, until the Pacific was
sighted and a bearing was taken to Cape Grenville, did not know
where it was. The latitude could not be ascertained, for black
clouds blotted out the stars by night. Moreover, the flooded
state of the country made it impossible to judge of the relative
"values" of water-courses, a "creek of the fourth magnitude"
being indistinguishable from a "river."</p>
<p>In these circumstances, with the aid of the charts now
existing, I am obliged to attempt to <span class="a">harmonise
the narrative</span> of the explorers <span class="a">with the
topography</span> of the district, as the latter is now
understood. I take it for granted that the water-courses laid
down on modern maps actually exist and are in the positions
assigned to them. The survey incidental to the construction of
the Cape York Telegraph line (Cooktown to Cape York) in 1884-7
gives firm <i>data</i> for the intersections of the line by
numerous creeks. The country is now partly taken up in pastoral
"runs" and partly reserved for the aborigines or the police. In
1885-6 and 1895-7, Mr. Embley traversed and surveyed most of the
important creeks and rivers as well as the boundaries of reserves
and pastoral leases within the region now under
consideration.</p>
<p>On the western or Gulf side of the peninsula, between 11&deg;
45' and 12&deg; 5' of south latitude, modern maps, <i>viz.</i>,
the Admiralty Chart, the 4-mile map (Sheet 21A), the 12-mile
"Tenure Map" and the 16-mile map of Queensland, show a
<span class="a">group</span> of <span class="a">rivers</span>
named in their order from north to south, the <span class=
"a">Skardon, Dalhunty</span> and <span class="a">Ducie</span>. A
critical examination of the narratives of the Jardine Expedition
leads to the conclusion that the so-called <span class=
"a">Dalhunty</span> (the Dalhunty River, <i>de facto</i>) is the
river to which the Brothers gave the name of the <span class=
"a">Skardon</span>; that the Jardines' <span class=
"a">Dalhunty</span> is the so-called <span class="a">South Alice
Creek</span>, a tributary of the <span class="a">North
Alice</span>, which falls into the Ducie; and that the so-called
<span class="a">Skardon</span>, with its head east of the
McDonnell station of the Cape York Telegraph line, falls into the
Gulf in 11&deg; 45' south latitude, at the inlet where a boat's
crew from the "<i>Pera</i>" landed on 12th May, 1623, which
Carstenszoon (who obviously followed the "<i>Duyfken's</i>"
chart) then identified as the "<span class="a">Carpentier
Revier</span>," "which the men of the '<i>Duiffken</i>' anno
1606, went up with a boat, and one of them was killed by the
projectiles of the savages" (Heeres, p. 42). It would, however,
be impossible to substitute the original name of the
"Carpentier," bestowed 314 years ago, for the <i>de facto</i>
name of "Skardon," which has been confirmed by thirty-three years
of usage. The <i>de facto</i> name of "Skardon" was unalterably
fixed by the telegraph surveyors in 1887. Mr. Embley informs me
that the river at the McDonnell Telegraph Station has a large
deep channel and carries a large volume of water in flood
times.</p>
<p>The mistake by which the Carpentier River, <i>de jure</i>,
became fixed as the Skardon River, <i>de facto</i>, made it
necessary to find another water-course to bear the Jardines' name
of "Dalhunty," and accordingly the river (falling into Port
Musgrave) which was the Jardines' <span class="a">Skardon, <i>de
jure</i></span>, became the <span class="a">Dalhunty, <i>de
facto</i></span>.</p>
<p>With these observations, we return to the <span class=
"a">narratives of the explorers</span>.</p>
<p>On the 16<i>th of January</i>, 1865, it is stated that the
<span class="a">feet and legs</span> of the men had been
<span class="a">cut in pieces</span> by the thorny vines. [From
my own experience in the same district I can testify that such
<span class="a">wounds</span> are more or less <span class=
"a">poisoned</span> and are difficult to heal.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>] With considerable reluctance, but driven by
necessity, the men packed up and <span class="a">resumed their
journey</span>. It had rained in the morning, but the weather
cleared as the day went on. Five miles from Camp 69, the party
descended gradually into a valley and crossed, "the horses
bogging a little; a smaller stream of excellent water running to
the west. A little further on a deeper creek, but sandy and firm,
water also running knee-deep in the same direction." Richardson,
from whom the above quotation is taken, conjectured that the last
creek mentioned was one of the heads of the Batavia River. It
was, in fact, the "<span class="a">rocky creek</span>" of the
subsequent Telegraph survey, and if he had crossed it twenty-two
years later he might have seen the telegraph wire above his head.
Unhappily no such infallible guide to Cape York cheered the
foot-sore wanderers.</p>
<p>Rocky Creek, according to the Telegraph survey, is one of the
heads of what appears on the modern 4-mile map as the
<span class="a">Ducie River</span>. Five or six miles <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> further, the <span class="a">Palm
Creek</span> of the Telegraph survey was crossed, and at
15&frac12; miles from Camp 69, the party camped (<span class=
"a">Camp</span> 70) on the north, or right, bank of a creek which
the Brothers named the <span class="a">Dalhunty</span>. It is
described as "ten yards wide; water knee-deep and running slowly
to the westward: banks steep." This <span class="a">Dalhunty
River, <i>de jure</i>,</span> has unalterably become the
<span class="a">South Alice Creek, <i>de facto</i></span>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Distances over-estimated, for a reason which it
is easy to understand, <i>viz.</i>, the "difficulty"
equation.]</blockquote>
<p>The <span class="a">Palm Creek</span> of the Telegraph survey,
according to Mr. Embley (in a recent letter to me) where it
crosses the line, "has a big channel and carries a large volume
of flood water."</p>
<p>Shortly after the construction of the telegraph line, in which
Frank Jardine took part, he changed the name of Palm Creek to the
<span class="a">Ducie River</span>, in honour of the Earl of
Ducie. He ran the river down westward for some 20 miles, where he
established <span class="a">Bertie Haugh Station</span> (named
for his own son). He found that 20 miles further west, the river
ran into <span class="a">Port Musgrave</span>, the common estuary
of the <span class="a">Dalhunty</span> ( <i>de facto</i>) and the
<span class="a">Ducie</span> and <span class="a">Batavia
Rivers</span>.</p>
<p>On this day's march (16th January, 1865), Richardson refers
for the first time for many months to something resembling a
range. "They walked," he says, "over some high ridges, or one
might almost say <span class="a">low ranges</span>; there does
not appear to be a distinct range, merely a succession of
gradually ascending ridges, which are not well grassed." They
were now, in fact, getting on to the sandstone shelf which lies
west of my "Sir William Thomson Range" and which forms the divide
between the waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Pacific
Ocean. This divide, or watershed, the Brothers named the
<span class="a">Richardson Range</span>.</p>
<p>One more of the horses died in the course of the day from the
effects of the <span class="a">poison plant</span> eaten at Camp
67.</p>
<p>On 17<i>th January</i>, "the country was similar to that of
yesterday, save that the <span class="a">ridges</span> were
<span class="a">higher and more stony</span>." The ascent
commenced at Camp 70 and the summit was reached in 4&frac12;
miles. <span class="a">Ant-hills</span> of bright red earth were
noted by Richardson as reaching the height of 25 to 30 feet. At 2
and 10 miles from Camp 70, creeks were crossed, running west,
probably to join the <span class="a">North Alice Creek</span>
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> of the Telegraph survey.
<span class="a">Camp</span> 71 was pitched on the right bank of a
creek (with vine scrub and Seaforthia palms) 15&frac12; miles
north of Camp 70, which was named <span class="a">Skardon
Creek</span>. This creek crosses the telegraph line a few miles
further west and discharges into Port Musgrave. It was
erroneously identified by the telegraph surveyors as the
Jardines' "Dalhunty" and the error has been imported into
official maps subsequent to 1887. It must remain the <span class=
"a">Dalhunty, <i>de facto</i>,</span> although it is the
<span class="a">Skardon, <i>de jure</i></span>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Named after Frank Jardine's
daughter.]</blockquote>
<p>The two last of the "good" <span class="a">horses died</span>
at this camp from the <span class="a">poison</span> eaten at Camp
67. The forty-two with which they had set out were now reduced to
fifteen of the "culls."</p>
<p>A general course of N. by E. was kept on 18<i>th January</i>
and 12 miles were believed to have been accomplished. Applying
the "correction for difficulty," the distance works out at about
4 miles of northing.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The march to-day," says Byerley (p.
50), "is described as being through the <span class="u">most
abominable country</span> that can well be imagined, being a
continuation of loose white sandy ridges thickly covered with
<span class="u">low bush</span> from 3 to 8 feet in height,
broom, fern, grasstree, pandanus and 'five-corner' bushes being
thickly matted together with <span class="u">prickly vine</span>.
Not a tree relieved the monotony of this waste, and, what was
worse, <span class="u">not a blade of grass</span> was seen for
miles. Several <span class="u">deep creeks</span> were crossed,
all running strongly with clear pellucid water to W. and NW. The
timber, when it occurred, was bloodwood, stringy- and iron-bark
on the ridges, banksia, grevillia and several kinds of teatrees
in the gullies, which were honeycombed and boggy. Two new kinds
of <span class="u">palm</span> were seen. The bush, which seems
to be what Kennedy alluded to as "<span class="u">heath</span>,"
could only be got through by leading a horse ahead, the others
following slowly behind him, the cattle then following in their
track. A straight course was impossible, as all the boggy creeks
and gullies had to be run up to their heads before they could be
crossed . . . The packs were continually being knocked off the
horses, occasioning great delay . . . Some black perch were
caught in one of the creeks and scrub turkeys were seen. Poor
'Nel Gwynne's' foal knocked up to-day, after having kept up
bravely since the mare's death. Nothing remained therefore but to
kill him. The party being without meat, and it being impossible
to stop in such a country to kill a beast, part of his flesh was
dressed and carried on, which was a grateful addition to the
food, and although two or three at first refused to eat of it,
the craving of hunger soon made them forget their repugnance to
<span class="u">horseflesh</span>. At night the horses had to be
short-hobbled, and a watch kept over them. The weather kept fine,
raising the hopes of the Leader of getting in before the rains."
(<span class="a">Camp</span> 72.)</blockquote>
<br>
<p>A clear night permitted of a star being taken, and the
latitude of the camp is given as 11&deg; 46' 36" S. This I take
to be about 3' 30" too far south.</p>
<p>19<i>th January</i>. In similar "<span class="a">abominable
country</span>," boggy creeks had to be headed, and capsized
horses had to be set on their feet again and again, and only
about 8 miles of northing were gained. <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 73 was on the head of a small creek running to
the east, and the <span class="a">watershed of the
peninsula</span> had been crossed at last. Late in the afternoon,
after the camp had been pitched, the Brothers saw <span class=
"a">Shelburne Bay</span> from trees which they had climbed in
search of the honeycomb of the native bee.</p>
<p>20<i>th January</i>. After having pushed on for 2 miles
northward through brushwood and scrub, the travellers were
confronted with a dense <span class="a">pine-and-vine
scrub</span>. After some delay, a <span class="a">native
track</span> was found and followed through the scrub for 2 miles
further, when it was found that the tangle of scrub and vine
ropes was more than the cattle could face. The native track was
therefore retraced, and half a mile was made to the east, to a
point whence Shelburne Bay was distinctly visible. Thence a stony
spur of the range was followed down and the party camped on a
small creek running east. (<span class="a">Camp</span> 74. ) The
total distance covered was estimated at 9 miles, and the actual
northing at a mile and a half. Quoting from the Leader's diary,
Byerley observes that the tracks of <span class=
"a">natives</span> were very numerous on this day's journey, "and
it was evident by the neat cutting of the marks on the trees that
they were provided with good <span class="a">iron
tomahawks</span>. Many <span class="a">turkeys' nests</span> were
found, but the eggs only benefited the stronger stomachs of the
party, having young ones in them in most cases."</p>
<p>From a point near Camp 74, Richardson got a prismatic compass
bearing of 117&deg; to <span class="a">Cape Grenville</span> and
thus determined the position of the camp with some approach to
accuracy. [My camp 51 (1st March, 1880), must have been
practically on the same spot.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>]</p>
<p>It is a coincidence, although, considering the nature of the
country, by no means a "remarkable" one, that in this region the
<span class="a">three parties</span> which were making for Cape
York, Kennedy's (by this time reduced to himself and a black
boy), the Jardines' and my own, each <span class="a">had to
double back</span> and search for a new opening.</p>
<p>From their 74th almost to their 76th Camps, the track of the
Brothers was east of mine, and west of Kennedy's, mine being on
the western and the Jardines' and Kennedy's on the eastern side
of the watershed. Kennedy's and mine could not have been more
than 2 miles apart.</p>
<p>21<i>st January</i>. The <span class="a">scrub</span> was so
dense that more than seven hours were spent in cutting 8 miles
through it to the NNE. It was described by the Brothers as
"<span class="a">fearfully difficult</span>." "The cattle
occasionally got their horns entangled in the vines and had to be
cut loose. One cow got furious at being thus arrested, and when
extricated galloped straight away and was no more seen . . . A
great variety of <span class="a">palms</span> were seen in the
scrubs, which were covered with fruit and berries, but only the
'<i>Seaforthia</i>,' the most graceful of the family, the
<i>Caryota urens</i>, remarkable for its star-shaped fronds, and
the more common <i>Corypha</i>, of which the Colonial straw hats
are made, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> were known to the
travellers." Four deep and narrow creeks were crossed, running
generally east, says Richardson. The Brothers say, seven creeks,
running westward. There can be no doubt that as regards the
direction of the flow Richardson was in the right, as they were
on the coastward side of the watershed. They must have crossed
<span class="a">Kennedy's track</span>, between his camps of 21st
and 22nd November, 1848. <span class="a">Camp</span> 75 was
probably on, or not far from, my "<span class="a">Captain Billy
Creek</span>." Its latitude is given by Byerley as 11&deg; 37'
46" S., which I take to be 3&frac12; miles too far south. The
fact that Richardson (who made the observations) does not record
the latitude suggests that he himself doubted its accuracy.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The "Cabbage Tree Palm." The hats are woven by
solitary bushmen, and being indestructible and highly valued as a
protection from the sun, command fancy prices, up to
&pound;5.]</blockquote>
<p>22<i>nd January</i>. The same class of country prevailed, with
even a more marked <span class="a">absence of grass</span>. The
distance travelled was estimated at 10 miles, but the actual
northing can hardly have been more than half. Four or five creeks
were crossed, all running east. <span class="a">Camp</span> 76
was among open brushwood near one of them, which was probably
<span class="a">Camisade Creek</span>, at the mouth of which (my
Camp 57) the blacks made a nocturnal attack on my party in 1880.
Heavy <span class="a">rain</span> set in before Camp 76 was
reached and continued till midnight.</p>
<p>23<i>rd January</i>. The rain fell steadily all day long. The
course was altered to NNW., and for some distance was on the
<span class="a">divide</span> between the Pacific (5 miles to the
east) and the Gulf (48 miles to the west). The distance traversed
was estimated at 9&frac12; miles, and was probably about 6.
<span class="a">Camp</span> 77 was on a teatree water-course in
forest country, with <span class="a">grass</span> enough for the
camp. It cannot have been more than 2 miles west of my Camp
52.</p>
<p>24<i>th January</i>. Two miles from Camp 77 a stream was
struck, running north, with a clear bed 30 yards wide. The right
bank was followed for 3&frac12; miles through heath and
brushwood, a track having to be cut for the passage of the horses
and cattle. A heavy thunderstorm then caused the creek to rise
rapidly and bar further progress. <span class="a">Camp</span> 78.
Rain fell at intervals till midnight. This camp cannot have been
more than 2 miles west of <span class="a">my Camp</span> 53, from
which I <span class="a">doubled back</span> to the south, on 4th
March, 1880, <span class="a">to avoid</span> the death of all my
horses from <span class="a">starvation</span>.</p>
<p>The Brothers and Richardson agreed that this stream must be
the <span class="a">Escape River</span> to which reference has so
often been made, and this theory, lightly formed, as it seems to
me, and adhered to with an amazing obstinacy, was destined to
lead to the most serious consequences. It is now known that the
Escape River, which was named by Captain King, R.N., on 24th
July, 1819, and where Kennedy met his death in 1848, "heads" not
more than 13 miles south of the point where it enters the Pacific
16 miles from Somerset, whereas Camp 78 was at least 31 miles
south of the outlet. Acting on the theory they had adopted, the
idea of the Brothers was to get on the left bank of the river to
avoid the swamps which Jackey-Jackey's narrative had shown to
exist near the mouth of the Escape.</p>

<h5>(SEE <a href="#map-b">MAP B.</a>)</h5>
<p>O<small>N</small> 25<i>th January</i>, 1865, the party
<span class="a">crossed the supposed Escape River</span> and
travelled N. 16&deg; W. down its left side for 10 miles, the rain
falling heavily almost all day. The country was "of the usual
character, heath and brushwood." "A delay of a couple of hours
occurred in consequence of a thunderstorm flooding a narrow
gutter that might be hopped over. It was not until this subsided
that the horses and cattle could be made to face it, the poor
brutes having been so frightened with bogs and water that the
horses had to be led over the smallest of them." <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 79 was in "a miserable hole" in the middle of the
brush.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">river</span> which the expedition now
followed down proved to be an <span class="a">entirely
unknown</span> one, to which the name of the <span class=
"a">Jardine</span> was subsequently given. The great mistake was
made of regarding it as King's <span class="a">Escape
River</span> and believing that by keeping on its left bank a
deep crossing and formidable swamps would be avoided.</p>
<p>On 26<i>th January</i>, the river (subsequently named the
<span class="a">Jardine</span>) was traced for 10 miles a little
to the north of west, and the rain fell heavily all day, as well
as during the night following. <span class="a">Camp</span> 80, at
the end of this stage, was pitched on the right bank of a river,
which was named the <span class="a">McHenry</span>, coming from
the south, and of a volume equal to that of the Jardine itself.
This river probably takes its rise near the 74th Camp.</p>
<p>On 27<i>th January</i>, the party crossed to the left bank of
the McHenry. "This was accomplished in safety, <span class=
"a">cattle and horses taking the water like dogs</span>, the
greater difficulty being in getting over the packs, saddles and
stores, which had to be carried on the heads of the swimmers of
the party, and this necessary part of a bushman's education was
not common to all." <span class="a">rain</span> fell steadily the
greater part of the day. The day's journey was estimated at 5
miles; the country slightly improving, with a little grass on the
banks of the Jardine. <span class="a">Camp</span> 81.</p>
<p>28<i>th January</i>. Following the <span class=
"a">Jardine</span>, with its "endlessly recurring water-courses,
each with its eternal fringe of thick vine scrub," was soon found
to be intolerable, and a course was shaped to the west. The
intention was to run the river (supposed to be the Escape) down
to the head of the tide and to leave the cattle to recruit while
the Brothers found a practicable way to Somerset. The westward
excursion proved a failure, and "far from improving the
travelling, made it worse, as they got into a maze of scrub,
heath and swamp, through which they had to thread their course.
They had therefore to make their way back to the river." The
total distance travelled was estimated at 12 miles. I reckon that
it must have been more, and that <span class="a">Camp</span> 82,
on the bank of the river, was about 9 miles NNE. of Camp 81. The
rain poured all day long.</p>
<p>In the last portion of its course, the river seemed to be
making at last as if it would really become the Escape. This
hope, however, was to prove illusory.</p>
<p><span class="a">Camp</span> 82 was established as a
dep&ocirc;t and resting-place for the main body of the party and
the animals, while the Brothers went out to reconnoitre. Packs,
saddles and stores were found to be for the most part completely
rotted from the constant wet. (<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>)</p>
<p>The <span class="a">excursion of the Brothers</span>, who were
accompanied by <span class="a">Eulah</span>, occupied the 30th
and 31st January and the 1st February, and the reconnoitring
party returned to the main camp (82) early in the morning of 2nd
February.</p>
<p>They found that it was <span class="a">impossible to get away
from the river</span>, as they no sooner got out of sight of it
than they became entangled in thick brush and teatree swamps
<span class="a">without</span> a blade of <span class=
"a">grass</span>. Following the windings of the river for a
distance which they estimated at 31 miles, they struck a large
creek which they named the <span class="a">Eliot</span>, coming
from the south. The course of this river has since been
determined by the <span class="a">Cape York Telegraph
Survey</span>. It rises in 11&deg; 30' S. lat. and the telegraph
line now follows its left bank to N. 10&deg; W., and it falls
into the left bank of the Jardine River in 11&deg; 9' S.
According to the modern4-mile map, the junction of the Eliot with
the Jardine is about 16 miles a little north of west of Camp 82.
After wading across the Eliot, their saddles and packs on their
heads, and the water up to their necks, the explorers
<span class="a">followed the Jardine</span> for 14 miles further,
until they were satisfied that the Jardine River must shortly
fall into the Gulf, and could not by any possibility be the
Escape. Rain was falling for the greater part of the three days
they were out.</p>
<p>On their return to <span class="a">Camp</span> 82, the
Brothers found an unaccountable <span class="a">deficiency</span>
of 30 lb. in the now very scanty supply of <span class=
"a">flour</span>. Byerley, who records the incident with hearty
disgust, remarks that similar instances of non-communal meanness
had blotted the records of the followers of Burke and Wills and
of Kennedy.</p>
<p>It was now determined that the Brothers should <span class=
"a">cross the Jardine River</span> and make another attempt to
reach Somerset or the mouth of the real <span class="a">Escape
River</span>. The <span class="a">rain</span> being almost
continuous, the Jardine was still high and the 3rd and 4th
February were consumed in experiments to find a practicable
crossing. All their labour had only resulted in their finding
themselves hopelessly on the <span class="a">wrong side</span> of
a <span class="a">river</span> which was <span class="a">not the
Escape</span>, whatever it was.</p>
<p>A raft was constructed by stretching a hide over a framework
of dead nondah, the only timber light enough for the
purpose&mdash;and it was scarce. On this the saddles, rations,
etc., were floated across the Jardine on 5<i>th February</i>.
Byerley's account of the passage is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The river having sunk considerably
during the night, the crossing was commenced this morning,
despite the downpour of <span class="u">rain</span>, which lasted
all day without a break. The stream was 130 yards wide, the banks
fringed with scrub and the current still running rapidly. It
required, therefore, strong and expert swimmers to get the horses
across, the method being as follows: One of the party went in
first, with a line made fast to the bit of the horse's bridle,
and another followed, holding on by his tail by way of rudder.
Now as a horse can swim faster than a man, and is, of course,
heavier in the water, the leader has no easy task, even if his
horse swim honestly for the opposite bank, but should he turn or
boggle at all, man and line are alike powerless; the use of the
rudder, therefore, will be seen. When the leader reaches the
opposite bank, he has to scramble up nimbly, or he may have the
horse on him, and, arrived there, be in readiness with the line
to assist him should he get entangled in the saplings and vines
which fringe the banks. It will be remembered that in crossing
the Batavia [<span class="u">Nimrod
Creek</span>.&mdash;<span class="u">R.L.J.</span>] on the 11th
January, two horses were drowned, in spite of every care and
precaution. Here, however, they were fortunate enough to cross
their four horses without accident, Mr. Scrutton, old Eulah and
the black boys doing good service, being all excellent swimmers.
The saddles and rations were then floated over in the raft, and
the advance party (<span class="a">the Brothers</span> and
<span class="a">Eulah) camped on the north side</span>, leaving
the remainder of the party and cattle in charge of Mr.
Scrutton."</blockquote>
<p>"Even now," continued Byerley, "<span class="a">Frank
Jardine</span> was uncertain as to what stream they were on, and
still <span class="a">leaned to the belief that it was the
Escape</span>." "The necessity for reaching their journey's end
was becoming urgent, for their tea and sugar were exhausted."</p>
<p>On this, their <span class="a">second excursion</span>
undertaken with the object of finding a way to the north, the
Brothers and Eulah spent four days (6th to 9th February). Leaving
the Jardine opposite Camp 82, they rode NNE. and at 15 miles
found themselves on "a line of high ridges forming a
saddle-range." This was the <span class="a">watershed of the
peninsula</span>, probably a little east of my Camp 64. From this
range they obtained a view of the <span class="a">Pacific
Ocean</span> and could distinguish a few small islands, probably
<span class="a">Arnold</span> and <span class="a">Sinclair</span>
and possibly <span class="a">Milman Islands</span>. They could
not, however, see clearly because of the drizzling rain. Now
turning N. by E, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> they got, at an
estimated distance of 5 miles [say 9.&mdash;<span class=
"a">R.L.J.</span>] from the watershed, on a white hill
[<span class="a">Sharp Peak?&mdash;R.L.J.</span>] from which they
looked on <span class="a">Newcastle Bay</span>, which was about
half a mile off. Then they skirted the coast for 3 miles to the
west, and <span class="a">camped</span>. This westward stretch of
coast was evidently that opposite the south end of <span class=
"a">Turtle Island</span>. Their camp of this night (6<i>th
February</i>) must have been in the immediate vicinity of
<span class="a">Kennedy's first camp on the Escape</span>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) It is doubtful whether the Brothers carried, or
used, a pocket compass. They would trust, like bushmen, to taking
their bearings from the sun, which, in such weather, would be a
poor guide.]</blockquote>
<p>The following morning (7<i>th February</i>) they came on what
they correctly surmised to be the <span class="a">mouth of the
veritable Escape River</span>. It was three-quarters of a mile in
width and running rapidly "from the NW." The flow, as given, is
probably a clerical error in Frank Jardine's notes. The adjoining
<span class="a">country</span> was "<span class=
"a">villainous</span>" with boggy swamps, brushwood and
scrub.</p>
<p>For three days (7<i>th</i>, 8<i>th</i> and 9<i>th
February</i>) the Brothers erred and strayed over the western
side of the little peninsula almost encircled by the Escape River
and the Pacific Ocean. Again and again they tried in vain to
<span class="a">cross the Escape</span>, the mosquitoes and the
bogs and scrubs of the <span class="a">villainous country</span>
combining to reduce the horses to the last stage of debility.</p>
<p>It is impossible to chart these wanderings from the bearings
and distances given. The Brothers met the same difficulties which
had made a pothook of <span class="a">Kennedy's route</span>
seventeen years before. Even eighteen years later, in spite of
having the experiences of my two predecessors to warn me,
<span class="a">I had to "head" the Escape</span>, after trying
to cross it.</p>
<p><span class="a">Frank Jardine had come round again to the
belief</span>, which he had persisted in almost against the
evidences of his senses, <span class="a">that the Jardine River
was only the head of the Escape</span>, his theory being, that if
he had only followed the Jardine down a few miles beyond his
"furthest west" of 1st February, he would have found the river
doubling back to the east coast. He had, he imagined, proved that
there was no way for the cattle across the <span class=
"a">Escape</span>, and made up his mind that the only thing to be
done was to drive them down the (Jardine) river and get them
round its supposed elbow.</p>
<p>It is not for a moment suggested that the Leader of the
expedition was "bushed" during his wanderings in the little
peninsula east of the Escape River. If proof were needed, it
would be found in the fact that, having turned back on the 10th,
he found himself on the 11th on the right bank of the Jardine
River, opposite Camp 82. This, however, was due rather to the
mysterious instinct of locality known as bushmanship than to
steering a course.</p>
<p>By the time they reached the camp their horses were incapable
of a greater pace than a mile and a half an hour with the
assistance of their now dismounted riders. They were left on the
right bank of the river, while the Brothers and Eulah swam across
to the camp. A very heavy thunderstorm had flooded the little
creeks during the last part of the day's journey. It was found
that another of the <span class="a">horses</span> had
<span class="a">died</span> at the camp from exhaustion.</p>
<p><span class="a">Richardson</span> agreed with the Brothers.
His diary of 11th February says: "There is no doubt that the
river near which we are encamped is the <span class=
"a">died</span>, and our best plan is to follow it until it bends
to the eastward." Richardson's sextant had already become an
object of suspicion. On overhauling it at Camp 82 he found that
it had been injured by the rough travelling, and it could not be
corrected for some time, as the sun was invisible (and so
presumably were the stars), "both days and nights being now rainy
not heavy rain, but continuous." He comforted himself with the
thought that after all the error in latitude could not be more
than fifteen miles! By 5<i>th February</i>, however, he had got
the instrument into some sort of adjustment and gave the latitude
as 11&deg; 11' 30".</p>
<p>On 11<i>th February</i>, when the Brothers returned to the
camp, it was found that 11 lb. of <span class="a">flour</span>
was all that remained of the provisions. Henceforth the menu was
restricted to <span class="a">jerked beef and water</span>, with
the addition of as much game as could be caught.</p>
<p>Owing to preparations for the journey, the necessity for rest
to the horses and the temporary loss of some cattle, it was not
till 14<i>th February</i> that a start was made. That day another
<span class="a">horse</span> had to be <span class=
"a">abandoned</span>, leaving the party with only thirteen.
<span class="a">Camp</span> 83 was pitched 11 miles down the
river, perhaps 7 miles NW. More of the luggage was left behind;
all that now remained consisted of jerked meat, ammunition, tents
and personal swags.</p>
<p>Although the expedition followed the footsteps of the Brothers
on their first <i>reconnaissance</i>, it was found that taking
the <span class="a">cattle</span> over the sodden ground was a
very different matter from travelling in light marching order. On
15<i>th February</i>, no less than three hours were consumed in
crossing one of the boggy gullies. The horses had to be unpacked,
and half of them had to be pulled across with ropes. From Camp 83
to <span class="a">Camp</span> 84, 8 miles east of the Eliot
River, the distance was estimated at 11 miles.</p>
<p>16<i>th February</i>. The <span class="a">Eliot River</span>
was crossed; it was 30 yards wide and 5 feet deep, with sandstone
outcrops. The horses had to be relieved of their loads. Two miles
further, <span class="a">Camp</span> 85 was pitched on the river
bank after 10 miles had been accomplished. The camp must have
been where the <span class="a">telegraph line</span> now crosses
the Jardine.</p>
<p>17<i>th February</i>. <span class="a">Camp</span> 86 was on
the right bank of a large creek falling into the Jardine, 8 miles
down the latter from Camp 85, and 2 miles beyond the Brothers'
camp of 1st February.</p>
<p>18<i>th February</i>. The creek at Camp 86 was crossed in the
morning, cattle, horses and men having to <span class=
"a">swim</span>, the men carrying the saddles and loads on their
heads. The course of the Jardine River had now become
<span class="a">northward</span>, and for a short time the
travellers were elated by the conviction that they were about to
round the elusive and mythical "<span class="a">bend to the
east</span>," which had by this time become an article of faith
with them. The 10 miles of this day's march are described as
"poorly grassed stringybark ridges" for the first mile, and then
"the country resumed its old character of swamp, brushwood and
low scrubby banks, flooded for 4 or 5 feet, the overflow filling
swamps running parallel, and about 300 or 400 yards distant from
the river." After <span class="a">Camp</span> 87 had been fixed,
a suspicion arose that the river was within the influences of the
tide, a rise and fall of 6 inches being perceptible, although,
owing to the floods, the water was fresh.</p>
<p>Richardson made the latitude of the camp 10&deg; 56' 14" S.,
which is nearly correct.</p>
<p>A halt was made at this spot earlier than would otherwise have
been the case, because the party had started without breakfast,
having <span class="a">nothing to eat</span>, and it had become
necessary to kill a calf.</p>
<p>The 19<i>th February</i>, "being Sunday," was, according to
Byerley, "chiefly devoted to rest," the slight exception being
the cutting up, jerking and smoking of the meat, a bark hut
having to be erected for the smoking process.</p>
<p>20<i>th February</i>. Heavy <span class="a">rain</span> fell
from 2 a.m. till after the party resumed their journey. It was
found that the <span class="a">Jardine River</span> again took a
<span class="a">westward course</span>, and after following it in
this direction for 6 miles [say 4.&mdash;R. L. J.] the procession
was brought to a standstill by a creek coming from the south,
fringed with mangroves, the banks showing a <span class="a">tidal
rise and fall</span> of 3 feet. The Brothers and Eulah crossed
the creek and <span class="a">Alick</span> and Eulah climbed a
tree, from which they saw the <span class="a">mouth of the
Jardine River</span> some 2 miles distant, and also <span class=
"a">Prince of Wales</span> and <span class="a">Barn
Islands.</span> The rain poured down heavily and <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 88 was pitched on the eastern, or right, bank of
the creek.</p>
<p><span class="a">The problem was solved</span>! And the
solution was a disgusting anti-climax. <span class="a">The river
was not the Escape</span>, and it lay, an apparently
insurmountable barrier, between the explorers and their goal,
where the father anxiously awaited the sons, who were
<span class="a">now less than 30 miles south-west of
Somerset</span>.</p>
<p>Six miles south-west of the mouth of the river an indentation
in the coast-line of the <i>Endeavour</i> Straits maybe the
"waterplaets" (watering-place) marked on the chart by
<span class="a">Jan Carstenszoon</span> on 13th May, 1623, when
he and ten musketeers landed from the "<i>Pera</i>" and found "a
very fine <span class="a">fresh-water river</span>, flowing into
the sea, whence fresh water can easily be obtained by means of
boats or pinnaces." This inlet was named the <span class=
"a">Revier Van Spult</span>, and there can be no doubt that it is
a <span class="a">mouth of the Jardine River</span>. The fresh
water at the landing was probably due to floods. It is strange
that Carstenszoon's diary never once mentions any meteorological
conditions except winds.</p>
<p>On the <span class="a">new river</span>, the Brothers proposed
to bestow the name of the <span class="a">Deception</span>, but
subsequently the Governor of Queensland, Sir George Bowen, gave
orders that it should be charted, and named it the <span class=
"a">Jardine River</span>. No name could have been more
appropriate. The Brothers had indeed made the river their own.
They had discovered it, followed it down from its head to the
salt water during twelve toilsome and costly marches and
investigated its surroundings. In time alone it had cost them a
month, and was yet to cost some weeks more before the remnant of
the cattle was delivered at Somerset.</p>

<p>O<small>N</small> 22<i>nd February</i>, 1865, the whole party
retraced their steps to <span class="a">Camp</span> 87.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>) A day
(23<i>rd February</i>) was spent in killing a calf and drying the
meat and in the construction of a <span class="a">raft</span>
like the one employed at Camp 82. The rain was falling heavily
and the Jardine River was rising fast.</p>
<p>On 24<i>th February</i>, the <span class="a">Brothers and
Eulah</span> started on a <span class="a">third excursion or
reconnaissance in search of Somerset. Heavy rain</span> fell
during the whole of the day and a <span class="a">cold
wind</span> nipped the wet and half-clad travellers more severely
than they had a right to expect midway between the equator and
the Tropic of Capricorn. By this time, however, they had learned
the natives' trick of protecting themselves from the elements and
the mosquitoes by <span class="a">smearing their bodies with
fat</span>.</p>
<p>Opposite <span class="a">Camp</span> 87, the <span class=
"a">Jardine River</span> had to be crossed. The <span class=
"a">horses swam</span> gallantly and the <span class=
"a">raft</span> rode well on the flood, but the transit took the
whole of the day, the party camping on the right bank of the
<span class="a">Jardine</span>.</p>
<p>Next day (25<i>th February</i>) the travellers were arrested
only 2 miles from the river by <span class="a">Cowal
Creek</span>, which was in high flood, at least half a mile wide,
running strongly, and, in short, <span class=
"a">impassable</span>. Three nights (25<i>th</i>, 26<i>th</i> and
27<i>th</i>) were spent on the <span class="a">left bank of the
Cowal</span>, and the days were occupied in trying to find a
crossing and hunting for something to supplement the ration of
dried veal. The only success in the latter direction was the
discovery of the oblate "<span class="a">wild grapes</span>,"
which Alick said were "very good to eat, but they take all the
skin off the tongue and lips." My own experience is that a very
few of these "grapes" may be eaten with impunity when dead
ripe.</p>
<p>On 28<i>th February</i>, the creek had fallen sufficiently to
be crossed. There was a rapid current 15 yards wide which the
<span class="a">men and horses swam across</span>, the saddles,
etc., being transported by a <span class="a">suspension
bridge</span> improvised out of tent ropes. On the right bank of
the river, the travelling improved at once to good sound
stringybark ridges intersected by only a few broad teatree
gullies. The party accomplished 10 miles and <span class=
"a">camped</span>. In the evening, Frank and Eulah climbed trees
and <span class="a">saw Newcastle Bay</span>, "on the south-east
of the bight on which they were now camped." This is puzzling,
but it appears as if the Brothers had steered about 5 degrees
north of east from Cowal Creek, crossing my (then non-existent)
track midway between my Camps 69 and 70, and that their camp on
28th February was on <span class="a">Jackey-Jackey's track</span>
near the head of <span class="a">Kennedy Inlet</span>.</p>
<p>The 1<i>st March</i> was a wet day. The party started early in
the morning, and, probably heading a little to the west of north,
in <span class="a">Jackey-Jackey's footsteps</span>, "over a
great deal of low scrub and brushwood," at 3 o'clock met a party
of <span class="a">natives</span>. It may be assumed that they
were now in the vicinity of my 71st Camp. The <span class=
"a">natives</span> proved to be <span class="a">friendly</span>
and, moreover, were posted up in the names of some of the party,
excitedly shouting "Alico, Franco, Dzocko [Jock], Johnny, Toby,
tobacco and other English words" and pointing in the direction of
<span class="a">Somerset</span>, which they named "Kaieeby." It
may be imagined how lovely seemed the "kindly dark faces" and how
sweetly mellifluous sounded "English words" spoken by black
lips!</p>
<p>Guided by their new friends, the party travelled about 7 miles
(presumably ENE.), skilfully piloted through the scrubs and
between the swamps, and reached "a shallow <span class=
"a">salt-water creek</span> that empties itself into a northern
inlet of Newcastle Bay," where a large body of <span class=
"a">natives</span> was met. These blacks were without arms, but
later in the day they presented the white men in token of
friendship, as was supposed&mdash;with a number of spears and
wimmeras which had been concealed among the mangroves. The party
thus reinforced went on for 2 miles further to their main camp,
where three large "dug-out" <span class="a">canoes</span> lay at
their moorings. Here the whites <span class="a">camped</span> and
watched, still not sufficiently off their guard to feel secure
against treachery, while the natives kept up a noisy corroborree
till the "small hours" of the morning.</p>
<p>On 2<i>nd March</i>, the Brothers were up and away at
daylight, in spite of a downpour of rain, the blacks guiding them
to and along the coast, and they <span class="a">reached
Somerset</span> at noon. Father and sons met at last after five
months of anxiety on one side and heroic effort on the other.</p>
<p><span class="a">John Jardine</span> had realised, before he
had been long resident in Somerset that the intricate nature of
the country must render the approach from the south a matter of
difficulty, especially in a wet season. With the object of
guiding his sons to the settlement, he had, therefore,
<span class="a">marked a line of trees</span>, about 30 miles in
length, south-westward to the head of the Kennedy (Jackey-Jackey
Creek). [That would be about 2 miles south of my Camp
68.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>] From that point, the
line went west for 10 miles to the Gulf coast [which would be on
the parallel of 11&deg; 5' S. lat., crossing the <span class=
"a">Jardine River</span>, and in all probability also the
<span class="a">Van Spult</span>, and passing close to the
Brothers' Camp 86.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>]. The line
was not observed, however, having probably been hidden by a rapid
growth of scrub.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> 2<i>nd</i>, 3<i>rd</i> and 4<i>th
March</i>, 1865, were spent in getting five fresh horses across
the Strait from Albany Island and in selecting a <span class=
"a">site for the cattle station</span>. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>) The spot chosen was
at <span class="a">Vallack Point</span>, 3 miles south of
Somerset.</p>
<p>On 5<i>th March</i>, the two Brothers left Somerset for Camp
87, with black guides to show them the best track. They were also
accompanied by a younger brother, John, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> the "Jock "whose name, as pronounced by
the friendly natives on the 1st March, sounded like "Dzocko." The
guides led for some time by the line of marked trees to the SW.
which was "a fair road for the cattle" and only presented a few
light belts of scrub. The first night was spent where the
Brothers had camped with the tribe on 1st March, which was 17
miles from Somerset by the new track. Next day (6<i>th March</i>)
the Brothers took the lead and in 22 miles reached the
<span class="a">Jardine River</span> nearly opposite <span class=
"a">Camp</span> 87. The river was still high and had been even
higher during their absence. It was too late in the day for the
party to cross, but two of the black guides swam over and
returned with a large supply of beef. This was welcome enough to
the whites, but to the native guides, who had never before seen
cattle or fresh beef, it was nothing less than a revelation. The
feast the blacks indulged in was a <span class="a">gargantuan
meal</span> which filled the Brothers with awe.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Afterwards the owner of Aberfoyle Station, near
Hughenden.]</blockquote>
<p>The whole party swam across to <span class="a">Camp</span> 87
next morning (7<i>th March</i>), and were confronted with the
familiar tale of missing horses and cattle. One of the horses had
died. A beast was killed and with its hide a <span class=
"a">raft</span> was constructed, having a carrying capacity of
400 lb.</p>
<p>Three of the <span class="a">cattle</span> were still missing
and were <span class="a">left behind</span> when the expedition
finally <span class="a">crossed the Jardine</span> on 9<i>th
March</i>. <span class="a">Cowderoy</span>, who was unable to
swim, was taken across holding on by the raft, which was upset,
and he <span class="a">narrowly escaped drowning</span>. The
passage had been completed in safety by four o'clock and the
party camped on the right bank. <span class="a">Camp</span>
89.</p>
<p>10<i>th March</i>. The distance covered to the NE. was
estimated at 11 miles. <span class="a">Cowal Creek</span> had to
be swum early in the day. A <span class="a">horse</span>, too
much exhausted to travel further, had to be <span class="a">left
behind. Camp</span> 90 must have been close to my Camp 71.</p>
<p>It may be remarked here that between Cowal Creek and Camp 90,
the Brothers' line of march is now crossed by the <span class=
"a">telegraph line</span>, which goes nearly due north to
<i>Endeavour</i> Strait, and then follows the beach
north-eastward to Cape York. Probably the beach offers much
better travelling than was found by the Jardine Brothers or
myself.</p>
<p>11<i>th March</i>. The <span class="a">line of trees</span>
marked by Mr. John Jardine, Senior, was followed for 10 miles. A
long detention took place at a scrub on <span class="a">Wimmerah
Creek</span>, and here thirty head of <span class=
"a">cattle</span> were <span class="a">lost. Camp</span> 91 was
pitched on the north side of <span class="a">Chippagynya Lake.
Three horses knocked up</span>.</p>
<p>The following day (12<i>th March</i>) was spent in the
recovery of twenty-five of the thirty cattle lost at Wimmerah
Creek. The camp was not moved.</p>
<p>On 13<i>th March</i>, the whole party arrived at Vallack
Point, <span class="a">Camp</span> 92, in about 8 miles. About
midway they were met at <span class="a">Lake Boronto</span> by
Mr. John Jardine, Senior.</p>
<p>Thus ended the long march of the pioneers. Nearly five months
had elapsed since they left <span class="a">Carpentaria
Downs</span>, the furthest outpost of civilisation, and the main
body had covered about 900 miles, irrespective of several
hundreds of miles traversed by the Brothers, singly or together,
prospecting for "good travelling" for the cattle.</p>
<p>It is very easy and very cheap to speculate on "the might have
been," and yet the temptation to do so is irresistible.</p>
<p>An actual economy of time would probably have been effected by
the Brothers if they had made two separate trips. Had they left
the cattle behind, chosen a suitable season, and travelled in
light marching order, I have no hesitation in saying, knowing the
men as I did, that they could have "romped through," marking a
practicable <i>route</i> for the cattle as they went, in a couple
of months. They could then have led the cattle to their
destination without distress. As it was, the difficulties that
met them at every step, and the consequent delays, were due
almost entirely to the dragging weight of the helpless tail of
cattle; and the cattle had to be knocked about hither and thither
while a way was found for them.</p>
<p>The expedition cannot have been much of a commercial success,
owing to the loss of three-fourths of the horses (including all
that were of value) and at least a fifth of the cattle.</p>
<p>The Brothers have been criticised for their treatment of the
<span class="a">blacks</span>, and their tale shows that about
fifty of the latter fell. Still it must not be forgotten that the
hostility and treachery of the blacks was entirely unprovoked.
These natives dogged the steps of the travellers, and threatened
their lives day by day. There can be no doubt that had the
Brothers betrayed any weakness, they would have shared Kennedy's
fate.</p>
<p>I incline to the belief, founded on personal contact with the
<span class="a">Australian aborigines</span>, that their
<span class="a">murderous propensities</span> have no higher
motive than <span class="a">mere sportsmanship</span>. Their
instinct is to ambush and kill their game, and to a race of
cannibals human strangers are big game, and nothing more.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is just possible that traditions of the
descent of white men or Malays on the shores of the Cape York
Peninsula may have been handed down among the natives for
hundreds of years; at all events since the earliest landing of
the <span class="a">Dutchman</span>, or the perhaps still earlier
landing of <span class="a">Spaniards</span> and <span class=
"a">Portuguese</span>, and that the intrusion of foreigners was
synonymous in their minds with surprise, slaughter and
kidnapping. Even in that case the question of "Who began it?" may
be raised. Unless the savages of three centuries ago were of
milder manners than their descendants of to-day, I believe that
they would have been tempted beyond their strength if ever they
saw strangers at their mercy.</p>
<p>The contribution of the Jardine Brothers to a knowledge of the
<span class="a">geography of the Cape York Peninsula</span> was
of immensely greater value than that of Leichhardt or Kennedy.
The former only touched on a corner of the Peninsula and the
journal of the latter perished with him. We owe to the Brothers
our first real knowledge of the western interior of the
Peninsula. I esteem it a privilege to have traced their steps,
with the aid of modern maps, over a country which in their time
was an uncharted waste.</p>
<p><span class="a">Alick Jardine</span> is now resident in
London. In 1863, the Brothers were awarded the Murchison grant of
the Royal Geographical Society in recognition of their services
of twenty-one years previously. Two interesting <span class=
"a">photographs</span> are reproduced in this volume. The first
is from Byerley's frontispiece, and shows Frank (sitting) and
Alick (standing), and apparently dates from 1867. The second is
from the <i>Queenslander</i> of 10th February, 1917, and is a
recent portrait of <span class="a">Frank</span>. The latter
settled at Somerset on his arrival with the cattle in 1865, and
after the transfer of the government offices to Thursday Island
made the old residency his home, or rather headquarters. After
his father's return to the south, Frank was Acting Resident many
times during the intervals between the periods when his father's
successors held the office. For some years, his pastoral
interests occupied his attention, but in course of time he
directed his activities, with the assistance of his elder son,
chiefly to pearl-shelling among the islands of the Coral Sea. He
<span class="a">died</span> at Somerset on 18th March, 1919,
after a short illness, having retained his vigour almost to the
last. It is said that he kept a <span class="a">diary</span>,
covering the whole of his northern life. It is to be hoped that
this diary will be given to the public. It should be an
historical record such as very few men have had the opportunity
of compiling.</p>
<p><span class="a">Eulah</span>, one of the black boys who came
with the Brothers to Somerset in 1865, settled down there with
Frank. He was a member of a party of white men and friendly
blacks who were surprised and <span class="a">killed</span> by
the <span class="a">natives</span> in a hut at Vallack Point a
few years later. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>

<p>In the first half of the nineteenth century, <span class=
"a">Booby Island</span> was known to seafaring men as a refuge,
house of call, post office and club.</p>
<p>In those days, when two ships met on the ocean, it was the
custom for each to record the date, the latitude and longitude,
and the name, port of origin and destination of the other. On
reaching port, each reported these particulars for the
information of owners and friends. The event was analogous to a
social call in polite society. In certain conventionally agreed
upon localities, such as Booby Island, a letter-box and visitors'
book were kept. In the former, letters were left to be taken up
and "favoured" by the next passing ship, and in the latter, such
particulars were written as the skipper might wish to
communicate. The arrangement was advantageous to all concerned,
inasmuch as ships which had never actually met might be deemed to
have "spoken" one another.</p>
<p>Apart, however, from the advantage derived from the
opportunity afforded a ship of reporting its presence at a
comparatively frequented island on a given date, the necessity
for <span class="a">harbours of refuge</span> grew with the
increasing traffic in dangerous and practically uncharted seas. A
ship in distress could make for such a harbour with a fair chance
of meeting other ships or finding provisions. Hence it became the
custom for ships calling at such harbours to leave what stores
they could spare. It was something like paying a premium of
insurance. A ship might leave her surplus stores at some harbour
marking a stage in a prosperous voyage, while later on the lives
of her own crew might be saved by finding something to eat at
that or another harbour of refuge.</p>
<p><span class="a">Booby Island</span> <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> served its purpose for a time; but at
length the <span class="a">Prince of Wales</span> and other
<span class="a">islanders</span> came to know of the existence of
stores of undefended valuables and got into the habit of making
periodical <span class="a">raids</span>, when they looted what
suited them and destroyed what they had no use for. Contributions
to the stores naturally ceased when it became evident that they
would benefit murderous savages instead of distressed mariners.
There followed a period when <span class="a">castaway
crews</span> were <span class="a">murdered wholesale</span> on
the Peninsula and the Islands. A particularly atrocious case was
the massacre of the entire castaway crew (23 men) of the
"<i>Charles Eaton</i>," wrecked near the Sir Charles Hardy
Islands, off Cape Grenville.</p>
<blockquote>[1) There is now a lighthouse on Booby Island, and
another on Proudfoot Shoal (141&deg; 28' E.; 10&deg; 31'
S.).]</blockquote>
<p>For the remedy of this intolerable state of affairs,
<span class="a">Sir George Bowen</span>, the first Governor of
the new colony of Queensland, <span class="a">proposed</span>, on
his arrival at Brisbane on 23rd October, 1862, from a voyage of
investigation with H.M.S. "<i>Pioneer</i>" (in the course of
which, by the way, he found the stores on Booby Island "in good
condition"), the establishment of a <span class=
"a">settlement</span> (to be named after the Duke of Somerset)
<span class="a">on Albany Island</span>, "on account of its
geographical importance, as harbour of refuge, coaling station
and <i>entrep&ocirc;t</i> for the trade of Torres Straits and the
North Pacific." <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> The approval of
the Imperial and the Queensland Governments was given at once,
and <span class="a">Mr. John Jardine</span>, who was then Police
Magistrate and Gold Commissioner at Rockhampton, was appointed
<span class="a">Government Resident</span> and sent, in 1863, to
establish the new settlement. He decided on a site on the
mainland opposite the island.</p>
<blockquote>[1) At this time, the only habitation in the
neighbourhood was the <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> station belonging
to Captain Edwards, of the "<i>Blue Bell</i>," situated at
Frederick Point (the north western cape of Albany Island). Its
buildings comprised a stone curing-house and a store. (Douglas,
<i>Past and Present of Thursday Island and Torres Strait</i>, p.
9.)]</blockquote>
<p><span class="a">Somerset</span>, besides the uses pointed out
by Sir George Bowen, was also to be a sanatorium "for the people
who were just then rushing to the Gulf country to take up land,"
and in this respect was to supersede the establishment on Sweer's
Island (east of the larger Bentinck Island).</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Queensland Government</span> contributed
&pound;5,000 and the <span class="a">Imperial Government</span>
&pound;7,000, besides sending a detachment of twenty-five
<span class="a">marines</span> under command of <span class=
"a">Lieutenant Pascoe</span>, and accompanied by <span class=
"a">Dr. T.J. Haran</span> as Medical Officer, who landed on 25th
March, 1863.</p>
<p>The official "<span class="a">foundation</span>" of the
settlement took place on 21st August, 1864, when H.M.S.
"<i>Salamander</i>" <span class="a">Captain The Hon. J.
Carnegie</span>, visited it on behalf of the Imperial Government.
For some time, the "<i>Salamander</i>" and afterwards the
"<i>Virago</i>" made three trips per annum from Sydney to
Somerset for the provisioning and protection of the
settlement.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Imperial buildings</span> consisted of
barracks and hospital, which were mainly erected by the marines.
They have long ago disappeared, and their site is covered with
scrub. The <span class="a">Colonial buildings</span> (which
included a custom house) were on the site occupied by Frank
Jardine's residence until his death in March, 1919.</p>
<p>The necessity for the establishment may be gauged from the
record of the year 1866, during which forty men, being the
<span class="a">crews of three wrecked ships</span>, were taken
south by the "<i>Salamander.</i>" Regarding other years, no
records are available, but I have seen frequent references by
travellers (<i>e.g</i>., James Dick) to meetings with shipwrecked
mariners waiting at Somerset for ships to take them off.</p>
<p><span class="a">John Jardine</span>, the first Resident, held
the office till the end of 1865, when he returned to his
magisterial duties at Rockhampton. He was succeeded by</p>
<p><span class="a">Captain Henry G. Simpson</span>, R.N., who was
still in office at the end of 1866. His appointment was for three
years, but before the end of his time he left on sick leave, and
did not return. The office was vacant at the end of 1867.</p>
<p>The appointment was held by <span class="a">Frank
Jardine</span> in 1868 and 1869. In the latter year he discovered
that the <span class="a">crew</span> of the "<i>Sperwer</i>"
seventeen in number, had been <span class="a">murdered</span> by
the natives of Prince of Wales Island, and avenged the
murder.</p>
<p><span class="a">Frank Jardine</span> held the office from 1870
to 1873. He was succeeded by <span class="a">Captain Charles
Beddhame</span>, of the East India Company.</p>
<p>When he left on sick leave (say, 1874), he was replaced by
<span class="a">George Elphinstone Dalrymple</span>. The
conspicuous part played by Dalrymple in 1873 in the exploration
of the eastern rivers and harbours between the Herbert and the
Endeavour and in the opening of Cooktown after the discovery of
the Palmer goldfield is described in another chapter. He also
took up the Valley of Lagoons in the Burdekin valley and
discovered a practicable road from the station to Rockingham Bay.
He did not hold the office of Resident long, having contracted a
fever at Somerset and died on his way south.</p>
<p>His successor was <span class="a">C. D'Oyley H. Aplin</span>,
who had been Government Geologist for Southern Queensland in
1868-9. He had been, in 1849, a guest on the "<i>Freak</i>" brig,
when she searched for relics of the party left at the Pascoe
River by <span class="a">Kennedy</span>. The bones of two of the
party, Wall and Niblet, having been recovered, were interred on
Albany Island, Aplin reading the funeral service. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> He himself died at Somerset, and was
buried beside the lost explorers.</p>

Beckford Simpson," Master of the Brig "<i>Freak</i>," as printed

makes no mention of Aplin, but contains the following passage
(13th May, 1849): "Pulled to the south end of Albany Island, and
. . . dug a grave and interred the remains of the unfortunate
individuals Thomas Wall and Charles Niblet, reading the funeral
service over them." It may be mentioned that the "<i>Freak</i>"
was wrecked on the Barrier Reef early in the
"seventies."]</blockquote>
<p><span class="a">Frank Jardine</span> again temporarily held
the office until the appointment of <span class="a">H.M.
Chester</span>, formerly of the Indian Navy, who was Resident
from about 1876 to 1879, when Somerset was closed on the
<span class="a">opening of a new settlement at Thursday
Island</span>. I Saw him first On 7th July, 1877, when the
"<i>Normanby</i>" the steamer by which I had come from Singapore,
lay off Somerset in quarantine. He and <span class="a">Dr.
Salter</span> came alongside in a boat and arranged for the
burial, on Albany Island, of a lady, Madame de la Forest, who had
died on board. I saw him next at Thursday Island on 5th April,
1880.</p>
<p><span class="a">Hugh Milman</span>, R.N., was the next
Resident at Thursday Island, and was succeeded in 1885 by the
<span class="a">Hon. John Douglas</span>, who had been Premier of
Queensland in 1877.</p>
<p>"I have often thought," says Douglas, "that a good deal was
lost to us when we left Somerset and the mainland. We abandoned
with it the chance of occupying some twenty or thirty thousand
acres of fine <span class="a">rich scrub soil</span> . . . and we
abandoned also the chance of a <span class="a">railway</span>
which might have pushed through the Peninsula and made our
starting-point for the East, for India, China and even the Old
Country. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Past and Present of Thursday Island and Torres
Strait</i>. Outridge, Brisbane, 1900.]</blockquote>
<p>It must be admitted that much of the scrub in the vicinity of
Somerset covers poor soil; but Douglas's estimate of 20,000 to
30,000 acres (say, 31 to 47 square miles) of available good scrub
land is probably a cautious one. The abandonment of the
settlement on the mainland has undoubtedly retarded the
occupation of whatever area of such soil there may be for over a
quarter of a century. A commencement has been made at last by
<span class="a">Mr. John McLaren</span>, who, in partnership with
Mr. J.W. Graham, started <span class="a">Utingu Plantation</span>
(960 acres), near the old Paterson Telegraph Station, in October,
1911, clearing the scrub with the assistance of native labour.
The greater part of the clearing is planted with coco-nuts, but
maize, bananas, pine-apples, sweet potatoes, etc., are very much
at home, and grow practically "without cultivation."</p>
<p>After Utingu was started, Mr. Frank Jardine planted coco-nut
trees on an area at <span class="a">Somerset</span> itself, and
several thousands were also planted on <span class="a">Possession
Island</span>. Shanahan records that on his visit to <span class=
"a">Lockerbie</span> (25th July, 1896), he found corn (maize),
pineapples, bananas and paupaus growing at the station.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">cattle</span> overlanded by Frank and
Alick Jardine were first camped on a station at <span class=
"a">Vallack Point</span>. Writing on 11th August, 1896, Shanahan
asserts that the scrubs between the Jardine River and Somerset
contained several thousands of <span class="a">wild
cattle</span>, descended presumably from stragglers of the
overland mob, as well as many wild <span class="a">pigs. Vallack
Point</span> station was not continuously occupied except during
a few years after 1865, but it was occasionally camped in by
parties mustering cattle. One of these parties, consisting of
white and black <span class="a">stockmen</span> (among whom was
<span class="a">Eulah</span>, who had accompanied the Brothers
Jardine on their overland expedition), was <span class=
"a">annihilated by the natives</span>. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> On a previous occasion (August or
September, 1868), the blacks had rushed the station and carried
away the whole of the stores, arms and ammunition, which,
however, were afterwards recovered. <b style=

<blockquote>[3) <i>Brisbane Courier</i>, September,

<p>Frank Jardine's first out-station was <span class="a">Bertie
Haugh</span>, on the Ducie River. The river and "country" were
discovered by him during the construction of the telegraph line
in 1886-7. The station was named after his son, who, it may be
mentioned, served with distinction in the European War of
1914-18.</p>
<p>An incident of the early days of this station may be abridged
from Shanahan's "Sidelights."</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The manager, Harry Price, a South Sea
Islander, with three others, heard, one morning in 1893, what
seemed to be a murderous <span class="u">fusilade</span>. In
preparing for defence they loaded up the whole of their firearms,
consisting of some fifty <span class="u">rifles and
muskets</span> and a 12-inch <span class="u">swivel gun</span>,
and ranged them inside the <span class="a">loopholed
building</span>. Presently they were approached by twelve native
troopers in a state of nervous blue funk, who had been
responsible for the firing.<br>
<br>
"Two men named <span class="u">Charles Bruce</span> and
<span class="u">Sam Roe</span> had been pearling or
beche-de-mer-ing in Torres Straits, and had been brutally
<span class="u">murdered</span> by their aboriginal crew,
presumably on Orman Reef, the murderers getting away to their own
country on the Ducie River. <span class="u">Senior Constable
Conroy</span>, of Thursday Island, with twelve <span class=
"u">native troopers</span>, and accompanied by <span class="u">R.
Bruce</span>, the murdered man's brother, were sent out to arrest
the murderers. While their boat was going up the <span class=
"u">ducie</span> the <span class="u">blacks threw spears</span>
at them from both banks of the river.<br>
<br>
"The <span class="u">troopers landed</span> at seven o'clock next
morning, the constable and Bruce remaining in charge of the boat.
For two hours the white men listened to the sound of an almost
continuous firing, and concluded that the troopers were engaged
in a serious conflict with the natives&mdash;while, in fact, the
troopers were making their way to the station. As the firing
ceased, and the troopers did not return, the white men came, as
the afternoon wore on, to the conclusion that the troopers had
been overpowered. Then a strong force of natives appeared on the
bank, boastfully asserting that the troopers had been
annihilated, and holding up two "captured" guns in confirmation
of their tale (the guns were afterwards believed to have belonged
to the murdered men Bruce and Roe.) Satisfied that they could do
no good, they set sail for Thursday Island, whence was
telegraphed the false news that a detachment of native police had
been annihilated on the Ducie River."<br>
<br>
"What actually happened," says Shanahan, "was that the troopers
marched straight to the station, without even seeing a native,
but firing almost all their ammunition with the object of keeping
the natives at a distance. One native came up to the station
after the arrival of the troopers, and in this individual the
troopers recognised, they alleged, one of the men 'wanted' for
the murder. The troopers fired twelve shots at the native, who
ran away uninjured, to return shortly with a large crowd armed
with spears. The troopers (by this time, presumably, without
ammunition) retreated to Cape York, 100 miles distant, where they
reported their belief that Conroy and Bruce had been
killed."</blockquote>
<p>The murder of Bruce and Roe, and the events which followed, as
above related, for a time brought the newly established
<span class="a">Mapoon Mission Station</span> into popular
disfavour. In Thursday Island, the mere fact that the murderers,
who belonged to the Ducie tribe, had returned to their haunts was
construed into evidence that the missionaries on the coast were
harbouring and encouraging them in their evil courses.</p>
<p>The story, as told by the missionaries, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> takes quite a different complexion. It
appears that the murder of Bruce and Roe took place at the
Skardon River, <i>de facto</i>. <span class="a">Nicholas
Hey</span>, one of the missionaries, heard of it, and reported to
Thursday Island that it had occurred at the Skardon River.
Charles Bruce had recruited his crew from the neighbourhood of
Bertie Haugh station, having previously told <span class=
"a">James G. Ward</span>, one of the missionaries, that he "had
done with the rascally Batavia River boys," and hinted that these
had not improved under missionary influences. "Within six weeks,"
says the author of <i>The Miracle of Mapoon</i>, "this crew,
uncontaminated by missionary influences, murdered him."</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>The Miracle of Mapoon</i>, p.
140.]</blockquote>
<p>The murderers beached Bruce and Roe's cutter and waited to
consume the provisions on board before going further. Some
Skardon natives, who had been invited to participate in the
feast, then took the cutter, which they professed to have
"found," to Thursday Island in the expectation of obtaining a
reward.</p>
<p>When the news of the murder reached Thursday Island, Mr.
Douglas sent a police party to arrest the murderers, but gave
them orders not to shoot. The party went out and returned,
"without having effected anything."</p>
<p>Next came <span class="a">R. Bruce</span>, the brother of
Charles. He was a Justice of the Peace, and obtained the
assistance of a <span class="a">police constable</span> and the
seven <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Skardon natives, who, on
their arrival at Thursday Island, were "enlisted by the Justice
and the constable." <b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> Having
reached Mapoon Mission Station in a cutter, R. Bruce, professing
the belief that his brother might not be dead, and that he
desired to search for the runaway crew and learn from them if his
brother had been landed on some island, borrowed the mission
whale-boat, into which the constable and troopers were
transferred. The whale-boat was returned some days later, but the
missionaries had already heard of the landing and the firing of
guns. R. Bruce and the constable then returned to Thursday Island
and reported their belief that the landing party had been wiped
out by the natives.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Shanahan says twelve.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[2) <i>The Miracle of Mapoon</i>, p.
146.]</blockquote>
<p><span class="a">Mr. Douglas's official reports</span>, it is
said, exonerated the missionaries from all blame. My own
impression, after a dispassionate consideration of the story, as
told from two different points of view, is that R. Bruce's
expedition was undertaken with a punitive object, which was
frustrated by the cunning of the Skardon natives, who had been
enlisted as troopers for the occasion. Having been landed, with
arms in their hands, and without any white witnesses, they began
to fire their rifles as soon as they were out of sight, partly to
impress the men in the whale-boat (who, of course, heard the
firing) and partly to warn the local inhabitants, with whom they
had no wish to come into collision.</p>
<p>It is certain that an avowed punitive expedition, with a
constable and native troopers, would not have been sanctioned by
Mr. Douglas, and it is at the same time very difficult to believe
that such an expedition could have got away from Thursday Island
without his knowledge. Either the true object of the expedition
was not disclosed or the police acted independently of the
Government Resident&mdash;which latter is most unlikely.</p>
<p>Another murder, that of a man named <span class=
"a">Nicholls</span>, was reported in November of the same year
(1893). He had shipped a crew of nine natives from the mission
station, and they threw him overboard. The report that he was
dead fortunately turned out to be incorrect. Nine natives were
arrested at the mission, one for the Skardon murder and eight for
the Nicholls affair. Four were discharged on a preliminary
examination at Thursday Island and five were sent to
Cooktown.</p>
<p><span class="a">Frank Jardine</span>, who at first located his
cattle at <span class="a">Vallack Point</span> in 1865 and next
took up <span class="a">Bertie Haugh</span> in 1887, afterwards
started two out-stations, <span class="a">Lockerbie</span>, on
Laradunya Creek, and <span class="a">Galloway</span>, on Black
Gin Creek, about 5 miles south-west of Lockerbie and 4 from Red
Island. Shanahan, who visited <span class="a">Lockerbie</span> on
25th July, 1896, records that "within the last three or four
years" (1892-3) the wild blacks and the native police boys
(presumably he means ex-troopers) had been killing the cattle. In
1896, Frank Jardine "spent most of his time there." <span class=
"a">Galloway</span> is used by the Torres Straits Butchering Co.
as a mustering-place for the cattle which come from the Coen
country to be killed and shipped at Red Island Point for the
supply of Thursday Island.</p>
<p>In 1891, <span class="a">J.T. Embley</span> formed
<span class="a">Thornbury Station</span>, on Black Gin Creek,
near the telegraph crossing. The original "Occupation Licence"
was at <span class="a">Red Island Point</span>, where the
bullocks were killed and dressed and shipped to the Thursday
Island <span class="a">refrigerating works</span> of the Torres
Straits Fresh Food and Ice Co. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) Letter from J. T. E., 25th November,
1915.]</blockquote>
<p><span class="a">Lachlan Kennedy</span>, an old Palmer and Coen
digger, found cattle "country" on <span class="a">Myall
Creek</span>, and on this country York Downs station was
established about 1885. Later, J. T. Embley acquired an interest
in the property, which is now a State-owned cattle run. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> Myall Creek is the head of the
<span class="a">Mission River</span>, which discharges into
Albatross Bay (<span class="a">Sheet 21A</span>). About 1895,
Embley discovered a river, which now bears his name, by which he
could bring supplies by boat from the bay to a landing only 9
miles from York Downs. <b style="color:#603000">[3]</b> The
<span class="a">Weipa Mission Station</span> was afterwards
established on the <span class="a">Embley River</span>, which is
navigated by the mission cutter. When the missionaries and Mr.
Embley first met in 1895, the latter had already suffered from
the depredations of the natives among his cattle and had been
forced to take stern measures in self-defence, and he welcomed
the project of a mission settlement. <b style=

<p>Twenty-five miles south-east of York Downs, a cattle station
named <span class="a">Merluna</span> was founded about 1888 by
the <span class="a">Brothers Watson</span>, one of whom (Edwin)
was afterwards <span class="a">killed by the blacks</span>. The
station is on <span class="a">Lagoon Creek</span>, one of the
heads of the <span class="a">Watson River</span> and about 9
miles east of the Jardine Brothers' track of 1865. <span class=
"a">Aurukun Mission Station</span> was established in 1904 near
the mouth of the river.</p>
<p><span class="a">Pine Tree Creek Station</span>, near Mein
Telegraph Station, was opened by <span class="a">Patrick
Fox</span> in 1887, while the telegraph line was under
construction.</p>
<p><span class="a">Rokeby</span> cattle station, on the
<span class="a">South Coen River</span>, was taken up by the
<span class="a">Brothers John and Charles Massy</span> in 1884.
<span class="a">Charles</span> was <span class="a">killed by the
blacks</span> shortly afterwards.</p>
<p><span class="a">Langi</span> cattle station, on the
<span class="a">Archer River</span>, was taken up by <span class=
"a">A.W. Knott</span> in 1883.</p>
<p>The twenty-five <span class="a">marines</span> landed at
Somerset in 1863 were <span class="a">withdrawn</span> in 1866,
from which time till the seat of the Resident was transferred to
Thursday Island, in 1879, a force of Queensland <span class=
"a">police</span>, generally numbering four to seven white men
and four to eight native troopers, was maintained at the
Residency. The <span class="a">early days of Somerset</span> were
far from peaceful. Meston records that five of the <span class=
"a">marines</span> were <span class="a">speared</span>, one of
them, while performing sentry duty, being simultaneously wounded
both before and behind. "<span class="a">James Howard</span> was
<span class="a">speared</span> at Newcastle Bay and brought in to
Somerset with spear-points stuck all over him." <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> The massacre, at Vallack Point, has
already been referred to.</p>
<blockquote>[1) A. Meston, "A Tour in North Queensland."
<i>Queenslander</i>, 16th and 23rd January, 1897.]</blockquote>
<p><i>Willmett's Almanac</i> for 1867 has a note to the effect
that "the <span class="a">London Missionary Society</span> has of
late years made Somerset the point of departure for their
proselytising expeditions to New Guinea." Shanahan mentions the
abandonment of this mission, which he characterises as a
failure.</p>
<p>Professor Semon, of Jena, who visited Torres Strait in 1895,
says: "On the mainland, near Cape York, stands a squatting and
pearl-fishing station, Somerset, belonging to Mr. Jardine, one of
the oldest and most celebrated settlers of North Queensland.
Passing steamers observe the custom of saluting his house with
one gun."</p>
<p>Shanahan asserts that the natives of Cape York <span class=
"a">poison their spears</span> by dipping them into corpses.
<b style="color:#603000">[2]</b> It is more than doubtful if the
custom is indigenous, although this trick of "frightfulness" may
have been learned in recent years from the Papuans.</p>
<blockquote>[2( "Sidelights." <i>Queenslander"</i>, 2nd October,
1897.]</blockquote>
<p>Until the transfer of the Residency to Thursday Island,
<span class="a">Somerset</span> was the base of the
pearl-shelling and <i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> shipping, except for
a short time when Roko, a small island between Possession Island
and the mainland, was the base. In these days there was a
<span class="a">leper station</span> on <span class="a">Dayman
Island</span>, south of Possession Island. <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) Letter from J. McLaren, Utingu, 23rd November,
1915.]</blockquote>
<p>I am tempted to add a few words on the subject of <span class=
"a">native "boys" in the employment of white men</span>. On many
occasions I have been impressively cautioned by miners and others
never to trust police or missionary boys, who not only had the
inborn treacherous instincts of their race, but were dangerous
because they "knew too much." I have had no experience of
ex-missionary boys, but I have had several ex-troopers in my
employment. These I found capable enough, but, as a rule,
unwilling to work their best. My impression is that without the
semi-military discipline of the barracks and the incentive of
competition with their fellows, they are apt to become lazy and
to give themselves airs. There is also the undoubted fact that
they are dangerous from their familiarity with the weak points in
the white man's armour. This danger would probably be even more
marked in the case of boys who had mixed with white ships' crews.
With this class of boys I have not come in contact, unless I did
so in the case of Captain Billy of Camisade Creek. Lastly, I have
observed again and again that senile debility sets in, at least
as regards the intellectual powers, among Australian aborigines
at a very early age.</p>
<p>When the complete tale of Somerset comes to be written, it
must of necessity form one of the most striking chapters in the
history of the founding of the British dominions overseas.
Fortunately, as has been pointed out in the preceding chapter,
the material exists in the diary, covering a period of over half
a century, left by the late Frank Jardine. It is to be hoped that
the diary will be edited and published without delay.</p>

AND <a href="#map-l">L.</a>)</p>
<p>In the three years that followed, he appears to have visited
the Flinders and Gulf country, and probably the Cook district.
But he was such an impersonal writer that it is impossible to
construct a satisfactory itinerary from his description of
localities, and it is equally impossible to distinguish between
his own observations and those made by somebody else. As he was a
geologist of keen insight, his own observations would be worthy
of the highest respect, while the hearsay evidence of an unnamed
"somebody else" might or might not deserve consideration.</p>
<p>On 23rd July, 1867, he wrote from Maryvale to the Rev. W. B.
Clarke, sending his notes with permission to the latter to use
them at his discretion. The result was a paper read by Clarke on
9th September, 1867, on "The Auriferous and Metalliferous
Districts of North Queensland" before the Royal Society of New
South Wales. The paper refers to the discovery of <span class=
"a">copper</span> at <span class="a">Cloncurry</span> by
<span class="a">Ernest Henry</span>, the discovery by
<span class="a">Daintree</span> of <span class="a">copper</span>
at the "<span class="a">Lynd</span>" <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> <span class="a">Mine</span> at the
junction of the Einasleigh and Copperfield Rivers, and of
<span class="a">gold</span> at the head of the <span class=
"a">Gilbert River</span>.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Now known as the "Einasleigh" Copper Mine.
Although Carpentaria Downs station had by this time been
established on the Upper Einasleigh, the river was still believed
to be Leichhardt's Lynd River.]</blockquote>
<p>It may be said here that Daintree "selected" and made a
freehold of the "Lynd" Copper Mine, and, with his partner Hann,
worked it in a desultory fashion for a few years. The low price
of copper and the high cost of everything else, including
carriage to the nearest port, soon brought about the inevitable
consequence, although the ore was exceedingly rich. It was not
till 1898 that the extension of railway facilities enabled the
mine to be reopened under sounder economic conditions&mdash;and
by that time it was not the pioneers who were to reap the
benefit.</p>
<p>In May, 1868, Daintree was appointed Government Geologist for
the Northern Division of Queensland, and C. D'Oyley H. Aplin for
the Southern.</p>
<p>Daintree's first official report was dated October, 1868, and
was descriptive of the <span class="a">Cape River Gold
Diggings</span>, of which geological maps, on the Victorian
model, were given.</p>
<p>In March, 1869, he led a party of prospectors from Mitton's
Oak Park Station on the Copperfield River, and with their
assistance blazed a track to the scene of his gold discoveries in
the Gilbert Ranges. He left the prospectors on payable (alluvial)
gold near the junction of the "Forty-one Mile Creek" with the
Gilbert River, while his own party went on and found further
payable gold in a tributary of the Gilbert to which he gave the
name of the <span class="a">Percy River</span>. His report is
dated 7th April, 1869.</p>
<p>His "Progress Report," dated 20th April, 1869, has a map in
which the locality of the new discoveries is given with relation
to already known places, such as Oak Park and Carpentaria Downs,
and <span class="a">Cave and Agate Creeks</span>, tributaries of
the Robertson River, are named for the first time and are
indicated as gold-bearing. By this time there were 200 diggers on
the ground, and Daintree recommended a site for a township (which
was shortly afterwards established and named <span class=
"a">Gilberton</span>.</p>
<p>From the Gilbert, he went to the new gold diggings on
<span class="a">Delany Creek</span> and the head of the
<span class="a">Etheridge River</span>, <b style=
"color:#603000">[1]</b> and then returned to Maryvale, his home
and headquarters, where he wrote his report, dated 18th June,
1869, "On the Gilbert Ranges Goldfields." The report was
accompanied by a geological map of the district visited.</p>
<blockquote>[1) Named, as I am informed by Mr. Alfred Foot, after
Donald Etheridge, who, in 1864, took cattle from Carpentaria
Downs down the valley of the Etheridge to stock R. Town &amp;
Co.'s newly acquired station, <span class="u">Miranda
Downs</span>, on the Gilbert River (Queensland 4-mile Map, Sheet
18B).]</blockquote>
<p>It must have been something of a surprise for the competent
geologist and altruistic citizen who had just handed over his own
gold discoveries to the public, to find awaiting him on his
return home an official intimation that after the conclusion of
the current financial year (30th June), the estimates would make
no provision for the Geological Survey. The precise political
significance of this action is still a mystery to me, since it is
evident that Daintree had not lost the confidence of the
Government, who employed him for the remainder of his life and
eventually advanced him to practically the highest non-political
position within its gift, the Agent-Generalship of the Colony (he
was the last non-political Agent-General). Aplin retired at once
from the service and took up commercial pursuits (tin-mining and
tin-buying at Stanthorpe).</p>
<p>After completing a geological survey of Peak Downs, Mount
Wheeler, etc., in the south ("Progress Report on a Portion of the
Rockhampton Mining District"), Daintree wrote his "General Report
on the Northern District," dated Maryvale, 2nd February, 1870,
being a sketch of the geological features designed to make up for
the want of the complete geological map which he had hoped to
issue. In this report he claims to have made discoveries of
economic importance as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) "Eighteen months before a digger had prospected the Cape
Range, I had indicated the area of the present Cape diggings as a
future goldfield."</p>
<p>(2) "It is now more than three years since I pointed out that
auriferous tracts would be found to extend from the heads of the
Gilbert, by way of Kirchner's Range, towards the <i>Endeavour</i>
River."</p>
<p>On 29th August, 1870, he wrote "Report by Mr. Richard
Daintree, late Government Geologist, North Queensland, on the
<span class="a">Ravenswood, Mount Wyatt and Cape River
Goldfields</span>, etc." This was the record of a tour embracing
the above-named places, and also the <span class="a">Bowen River
Coalfield</span>, the tour having had for its primary object the
collection of specimens for the <span class="a">London
Exhibition</span>. In 1871, he went to London in charge of the
mineral exhibits. On the close of the Exhibition, he was
appointed <span class="a">Agent-general</span> for the Colony of
Queensland. Early in his incumbency of this office he wrote a
handbook entitled <i>Queensland, Australia: Its Territory,
Climate and Products, Agricultural, Pastoral and Mineral, etc.,
etc.</i> (no date). Besides profuse illustrations, this handbook
contains a "<span class="a">map showing mineral areas</span>,"
and it also shows "Mount Daintree" (named by Hann), and sketches
Hann's "Northern Exploration" <i>route</i>. The latter shows the
date of publication to be about 1873, because during that year
the report of Hann's trip of June-November, 1872, was published.
During his stay in London he received the distinction of
C.M.G.</p>
<p>On 24th April, 1872, Daintree read "<span class="a">Notes on
the Geology of the Colony of Queensland</span>" before the
Geological Society of London. This paper still ranks as a classic
in the geology of Queensland, and it was accompanied by a small
<span class="a">geological map</span> of the Colony, on which the
"work" significantly stops short at the Mitchell River. It is
stated that the <i>data</i> for the paper were "collected while
prosecuting the search for new goldfields on behalf of the
Queensland Government." It is a <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> and
review of his field work, and inasmuch as it gives an analysis of
the Saxby River hot spring "near Gibson's Station," it confirms
the surmise that he had personally travelled in the Lower
Flinders region.</p>
<p>Failing health led to his resignation of the
Agent-Generalship, and in 1876 he was succeeded by the Hon.
Arthur Macalister. He died at Mentone on 20th June, 1878.</p>

<p>H<small>ER</small> Majesty's cruiser "<i>Basilisk</i>,"
commanded by <span class="a">Captain</span> (afterwards Admiral)
<span class="a">John Moresby</span>, R.N., was a paddle-steamer
of 1,031 tons burthen and 400 horse-power and carried five
guns.</p>
<p>The Commander's narrative <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> is
full of interest and brings vividly before the eye of the reader
not only the progress accomplished in the twelve years which had
elapsed since the separation of Queensland from New South Wales,
but also some of the abuses which had followed the scramble for
wealth in a little-known sea far from the seat of government.</p>
<blockquote>[1) <i>Discoveries and Surveys in New Guinea and the

<br>
<i>Two Admirals Admiral of the Fleet Sir Fairfax Moresby

Moresby. London, John Murray, 1909.]</blockquote>
<p>The cruiser left <span class="a">Sydney</span> on 15th and
<span class="a">Brisbane</span> on 28th January, 1871, taking on
board at the latter port horses and stores for Somerset, and
following the "inner <i>route</i>," which had already been
charted by Captains Owen Stanley and Francis Blackwood and
others. (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-o">MAP
O.</a>)</p>
<p>The "<i>Basilisk's</i>" work began at the base of the Cape
York Peninsula. Thirty miles from Cardwell, and therefore about
the <span class="a">Palm Islands</span>, a small fore-and-aft
schooner was met, apparently in a helpless condition, and was
boarded. She proved to be the "<i>Peri</i>" and there was neither
food nor water on board, and no boat. The crew, of Solomon
Islanders, were "living skeletons, creatures dazed with fear and
mortal weakness . . . Some were barely alive, and the sleeping
figures were dead bodies, fast losing the shape of humanity, on a
deck foul with blood." The first thing that had to be done was to
bury six bodies.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"The story of the '<i>Peri</i>' says
Moresby (p. 5), "proved to be this: A noted kidnapping vessel,
the '<i>Nukalow</i>' had brought a cargo of some 180 kidnapped
natives to Rewa River, Fiji, some two months previous to our
falling in with the 'Peri.' At Rewa they were disposed of by
being hired out to planters at the rate of ten to fifteen pounds
a head, paid to the owners of the '<i>Nukalow</i>' and about
eighty of them were transferred to the <i>'Peri'</i> for
conveyance to the various islands of the Fiji group, in charge of
three white men and a Fijian crew. On getting to sea,
insufficient food was served to the natives, who were quite
unsecured, and they clamoured for more, on which some rice was
issued; but one of the white men, angered by the clamour for
food, was heartless enough to throw the rice overboard as the
natives were cooking it, and the maddened creatures rose at once
and threw him over after the rice. The other two whites and the
Fijians followed; and the savages, thus left to themselves, and
wholly unable to manage the ship, drifted helpless and starving
before the southeast trade wind for about five weeks,
accomplishing a distance of nearly 1,800 miles through a sea
infested with coral reefs and full of islands; finally passing
over a submerged part of the Barrier Reef, or through one of its
narrow openings, to the place where the '<i>Basilisk</i>' found
them. Thirteen only were then alive out of the eighty natives who
had sailed from Rewa. We took these survivors to Cardwell, 30
miles distant, which was then, excepting Cape York, the most
northerly point of Queensland, and here, under the humane care of
Mr. Brinsley Sheridan, the Police Magistrate, they recovered
strength in time, and were afterwards taken by us to Sydney,
whence they were carried by one of H.M. ships to their various
islands in the Solomon group."</blockquote>
<p>It will be remembered that in 1848, <span class=
"a">Kennedy</span>, who landed at Tam O'Shanter Point, opposite
Dunk Island, had been unable to get away from the coast until he
had been forced southward to about 2 miles north of the site of
the present town of Cardwell, which by the time of the
"<i>Basilisk's</i>" visit, twenty-three years later, had become
an agricultural centre and the port for the Etheridge
goldfield.</p>
<p>"Various tribes of aborigines," says Moresby, "range about the
vicinity and not unnaturally regard the white men who are rapidly
dispossessing them of their homes as mortal enemies. They show
this feeling by committing murders and outrages, and suffer
terrible retaliation at the hands of our countrymen, who employ
native troopers, commanded by white men, to hunt down and destroy
the offenders."</p>
<p><span class="a">Mr. Sabben</span>, Navigating Lieutenant of
the "<i>Basilisk</i>" was left in charge of the "<i>Peri</i>."
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-k">MAP K.</a>) The
"<i>Basilisk</i>" after leaving Cardwell, took in wood and water
at Fitzroy Island, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> off Cape
Grafton (<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-g">MAP G</a>),
and left for Cape York on 9th February. <span class=
"a">Somerset</span> was reached on the 16th and the steamer lay
there at anchor for six nights. (<span class="a">See</span>
<a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>)</p>
<blockquote>[1) In 1877, the writer was on board the
"<i>Normanby</i>," from Singapore, when 250 Chinese, bound for
the Palmer goldfield, were landed on Fitzroy Island, to be
quarantined because of cholera on board.]</blockquote>
<p>The settlement had been founded in 1866, but had failed to
attract a trading population. Captain Moresby found only
<span class="a">Frank Jardine</span>, the explorer of 1865, now
acting as Police Magistrate, and the five white men of his boat's
crew, with some fifteen or twenty coloured men, some of them
native troopers and the rest pearl-divers. The removal of the
settlement to a better site was already contemplated.</p>
<p>During the detention of the "<i>Basilisk</i>" at Somerset, an
attempt to visit some of the islands in boats, piloted by
<span class="a">Mr. Chester</span>, formerly Police Magistrate at
Somerset, was rendered abortive by stormy weather, which set in
as soon as the Albany Passage had been cleared. Moresby visited a
<span class="a">native camp</span> about 3 miles from the
settlement and was impressed by the low type of humanity
presented by the idle, depressed and shiftless natives, who, in
sharp contrast to those of New Guinea, attempted no cultivation
and built no permanent dwellings.</p>
<p>The "<i>Basilisk</i>" left Somerset on 22nd February, and in a
few days located a reported danger, now known as the <span class=
"a">Moresby Rock</span>, east of Saddle Island (10&deg; 1' S.;
142&deg; 42' E.). Two vessels had already been wrecked on it.
<span class="a">Saddle Island</span> is described as "fertile and
hilly, though uninhabited."</p>
<p>About 30 miles north of Saddle Island lies <span class=
"a">Gabba Island</span>, or The Brothers (9&deg; 45' S.), and
this was visited next. The large reef south of the island,
charted as <span class="a">Mourilyan Reef</span> (after
Lieutenant Mourilyan), was surveyed.</p>
<p>Gabba Island is distinguished by a couple of "twin" hills,
which explains the growing use of the English, in preference to
the native, name, and was, at the time of the visit, one of the
chief centres of the pearl-shelling industry. Moresby made
inquiries into the conditions under which island labour was
recruited to man the pearl-shelling boats, and concluded that in
many instances the divers had only imperfectly understood alleged
verbal agreements with their employers, who detained them for
years, in slavery, by force or fraud; while in still worse cases
there was "nothing more nor less than an organised system of
<span class="a">kidnapping</span>, attended at times with
atrocities that it blanches the cheek and makes the blood run
cold to hear of." At the close of the year, the boats were wont
to sail for Sydney, each with thirty or forty tons of shell,
worth from &pound;150 to &pound;180 per ton. The islanders, thus
taken to Sydney, soon spent their earnings and were glad to ship
for further services. These statements, it must be pointed out,
were not made of Gabba Island in particular, but applied to the
whole industry and region. The existence of abuses of this kind
was corroborated by the Hon. John Douglas and Mr. Chester, P.M.,
and led to legislation under which island labour was regulated
and supervised, the pearlers having to be licensed to recruit and
employ labour and being forced to make proper agreements and to
carry them out.</p>
<p>Although the survey of the Mourilyan Reef was reserved for the
"<i>Basilisk</i>" Gabba Island itself was already well known.
<span class="a">Bligh</span> had passed it in 1792, with the
"<i>Providence</i>" and "<i>Assistance</i>" and Captains
<span class="a">Bampton</span> and <span class="a">Alt</span>, in
the "<i>Hormuzeer</i>" and "<i>Chesterfield</i>" in 1793,
<span class="a">Dumont D'Urville</span>, with the
"<i>Astrolabe</i>" and "<i>Z&egrave;l&eacute;e</i>" in 1840, and
<span class="a">Blackwood</span>, in the "<i>Fly</i>," in
1846.</p>
<p>"Due north of The Brothers, the high peak of <span class=
"a">Cornwallis Island</span> could be seen about 20 miles off,
and occasionally, when raised by the mirage, the low, wooded
outline of <span class="a">Saibai Island</span>, lying about 4
miles from the New Guinea coast, not marked on any chart, and
only recently brought into knowledge by the pearl-shellers" (p.
27). Saibai Island was, in fact, first charted as an island by
Moresby on this occasion (p. 132).</p>
<p>From Gabba, the "<i>Basilisk</i>" went eastward to
<span class="a">Warrior Island</span> (142&deg; 58' E.; 9&deg;
48' S.). It is described as "a vegetated sandbank on a coral reef
and not more than 2 miles in circumference, and yet the home of
one of the most powerful tribes in Torres Strait." It was also,
at the date of the "<i>Basilisk's</i>" visit, the headquarters of
a pearl-shelling station belonging to Mr. Merriman, of Sydney,
"the largest and best-conducted in the Straits," and in charge of
Mr. Bedford, who gave a cordial welcome to the "<i>Basilisk</i>"
The <span class="a">natives</span> evidently impressed Moresby
with their (comparative) advancement. They had war canoes 50 or
60 feet in length, 6-foot bows and poisoned arrows.</p>
<p>Moresby remarks that the name of the island had been given in
commemoration of an attack on a man-of-war "in former years."
This vague reference is to the attack on the "<i>Providence</i>"
and "<i>Assistant</i>" commanded by Bligh and Portlock, in 1792.
He saw a "war dance" of natives.</p>
<p>On the island were two teachers or <span class=
"a">missionaries</span>, natives of the Loyalty group of islands.
They had been brought, with others, some nine months previously,
by the Revs. S. Macfarlane and A. W. Murray, from Cape York and
landed on Cornwallis and Saibai Islands, where they were left
with a small stock of "trade" for the purchase of their
requirements and the propitiation of the native chiefs. When food
and trade were exhausted, the two men came to Warrior Island to
beg for relief for the wives they had left sick and starving at
Cornwallis Island, and were fortunate enough to obtain alms,
first from Mr. Merriman's employees and afterwards from the men
of the "<i>Basilisk</i>"</p>
<p>The "<i>Basilisk</i>" returned to Sydney by the inner passage,
calling at <span class="a">Lizard Island</span> and the
<span class="a">Endeavour River</span>. In all probability the
course was outside of the Dungeness Reef, and, if so, this would
be the first occasion on which she cleared the strait now known
as <span class="a">Basilisk Pass</span>, between Warrior and
Dungeness Reefs. The pass had already been used, though not
named, by Bligh and Portlock, in the "<i>Providence</i>" and
"<i>Assistant</i>," in 1792; and by Bampton and Alt, in the
"<i>Hormuzeer</i>" and "<i>Chesterfield</i>" in 1793; while
Dumond D'Urville, with the "<i>Astrolabe</i>" and
"<i>Z&egrave;l&eacute;e</i>" had the misfortune to discover the
"<span class="a">Mauvais Canal</span>," on the wrong side of
Warrior Island.</p>
<p>Moresby took the "<i>Basilisk</i>" on the 5th March, 1871, to
the spot where <span class="a">Cook</span> had landed in 1770,
and found it just as Cook had left it. Before he had found time
to pen his narrative, the discovery of the <span class="a">Palmer
Goldfield</span> had created on this spot the township of
<span class="a">Cooktown</span>, with "a population of 10,000
people, three banks, a daily newspaper and all the appointments
of a full-grown city."</p>
<p>The "<i>Basilisk</i>" arrived at <span class=
"a">Cardwell</span> on 9th March, 1871, and came in touch with a
tragedy which has become historical.</p>
<p>Sabben, who had been left in charge of the captured
"<i>Peri</i>" reported to Moresby the circumstances attending and
following the <span class="a">wreck of the "Maria</span>," a brig
of 167 tons. Sixty-seven adventurous spirits had clubbed together
in Sydney, contributing &pound;10 each towards the expenses of an
expedition, of which the chief item was the purchase of the leaky
and ill-found old craft in which they eventually sailed with the
intention of prospecting in New Guinea. Four hundred miles short
of their destination, they met the north-westerly monsoon and
just escaped shipwreck. In an almost helpless condition they
drifted southward for a time before they managed to steer
westward through the Barrier Reef. When, at length, they had
begun to believe that their troubles were about to end, the ship
struck (on 26th February, before daylight) on <span class=
"a">Bramble Reef</span>, on the south side of Rockingham Bay.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-k">MAP K.</a>) The
Captain, taking six men, according to the information given to
Sabben, deserted the ship with the best boat (which would have
held twenty) in the early morning, under the pretence of going
for assistance, Cardwell being about 30 miles to the west. This
boat's crew landed at <span class="a">Tam O'Shanter Point</span>,
where the Captain and three of his men met their death at the
hands of the natives. The three survivors (who had only dared to
travel by night) crawled into Cardwell some days afterwards.
Sabben at once took the gig and hurried (4th-5thth March) to Tam
O'Shanter Point, with two of his own men and six volunteers from
Cardwell. They found the <span class="a">Captain's boat</span>
drawn up into the scrub, where preparations had been made to burn
her. The party, who had been without food for twelve hours,
hauled the boat to the water and had begun to cook a meal on
shore, when they were suddenly <span class="a">rushed by 120
natives</span>, who emerged from the mangroves, armed with
spears. The assailants were beaten off, with a loss of eight
killed and eight wounded. The gig then returned to Cardwell, with
the Captain's boat.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously with the departure of the gig from
Cardwell, <span class="a">Mr. Brinsley Sheridan</span>, Police
Magistrate, chartered the small steamer "<i>Tinonee</i>" which
visited the scene of the wreck; but nothing was to be seen of the
"<i>Maria</i>" even her masts having sunk.</p>
<p>The fact that the Captain left the ship secretly and before
daybreak certainly favours the theory of desertion, but as his
death deprived him of an opportunity of explaining his conduct,
it is charitable to surmise that he wished to avoid a panic and
that he hoped to organise a speedy rescue from Cardwell; in
short, that he only added one more to the numerous errors of
judgment which he had already made.</p>
<p>When the absence of the Captain and the boat was discovered,
the mate, who took charge, had two <span class="a">rafts</span>
constructed. These had barely been launched when the ship heeled
over, slipped from the reef, and sunk to her lower yards.
Thirteen men scrambled into the larger raft and twelve into the
smaller, while some clung to the rigging of the ship. At this
critical moment, there were only two boats belonging to the ship,
and one of them was pursuing the other, which had broken adrift.
Both boats then returned to the ship and took as many men as
could be accommodated, leaving nine clinging to the rigging. The
<span class="a">boats</span> then made for the nearest land, 15
miles distant; but it was five days before they reached Cardwell,
a devious course having probably been forced upon them by the
weather; or perhaps the occupants of the boats may have been
unaccustomed to navigation and unprovided with charts and
consequently ignorant of the exact locality of the then infant
settlement. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>
<blockquote>[1) Thomas Tate, who had been a medical student, was
Acting Surgeon on the "Maria" and was generally spoken of as
Doctor Tate. Later in 1872, he joined William Hann's expedition
as Botanist. According to his narrative, "An Old-Time Story"
(<i>Norman Chronicle</i>, 1903, and <i>North Queensland
Register</i>, 13th December, 1915), the mate took charge of one
of the boats, with thirteen men, and Tate of two boats, with
fifteen men. The boats were beached on the seaward side of
Hinchinbrook Island, where the starving men spent five wretched
days, the weather being too rough to permit of their putting to
sea again. Afterwards they coasted the island southward and
entered the Hinchinbrook Passage, between the island and the
mainland and, turning northward, reached Cardwell in two days.
Tate's story leaves little doubt that the Captain (a German)
deliberately deserted the wreck and the men for whom he was
responsible. The mate became temporarily insane from excitement
and exposure, and had to be put under restraint on his arrival at
Cardwell. Tate, as the only other surviving officer of the
"<i>Maria</i>," went with Moresby in the "<i>Basilisk</i>" to the
scene of the wreck.]</blockquote>
<p>Six days later (9th March), on the arrival of the
"<i>Basilisk</i>" Mr. Sheridan claimed the assistance of the
warship in punishing the murderers of the captain of the
"<i>Maria</i>" and his three men, having by this time come to the
conclusion that the existence of the settlement itself was
threatened by the blacks. The request was met by the detail of
fourteen men from the "<i>Basilisk</i>" under Lieutenant Francis
Hayter, who were joined by a detachment of native troopers, led
by Sub-Inspector R. Johnstone, on board the "<i>Peri</i>". "The
tribe was surprised before daylight," and a bloody vengeance was
meted out.</p>
<p>Moresby himself took the "<i>Basilisk</i>" in search of the
rafts, and at <span class="a">Cooper's Point</span> (lat. 17&deg;
25' S.) descried white men on the beach. Eight emaciated and
half-naked wretches were all that remained of the thirteen men
who had left the "<i>Maria</i>" on the 26th February, on the
<span class="a">larger raft</span>, unprovided with food or
water. They had but a single oar; and a tent which was fashioned
into a sail was soon lost. It was not long before two men became
insane and two others were drowned. On the third day, another man
went raving mad and died. At night another went mad, but was
restrained from violence by his companions. In the small hours of
the following morning the raft grounded, and the men scrambled to
the beach, where they slept till daylight, when they found fresh
water and some wild fruits. Shortly afterwards they met a party
of natives, who entertained them with generous hospitality,
lodging them in their own gunyahs and giving them a share of
their own scanty provisions. Both hosts and guests were on the
verge of starvation when the "<i>Basilisk</i>" came to their
rescue.</p>
<p>On the same day (12th March) that the eight men were rescued
from the larger raft, <span class="a">Lieutenant Sydney
Smith</span>, in the "<i>Basilisk's</i>'s" cutter, found the
remains of the <span class="a">smaller raft</span> on the beach,
not more than 6 miles from the point where the larger had
grounded, the two localities being separated by what Moresby
afterwards named the <span class="a">Gladys River</span>.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> Here the bodies of two men were
found. Two days later, the naked body of another castaway was
discovered, and its condition pointed to a violent death, the
skull having been beaten in. "Still further search, afterwards
made by <span class="a">Navigating Lieutenant Gowland</span>, of
the New South Wales Government steamer '<i>Governor
Blackall</i>,' discovered six more bodies further to the south,
which showed that those who had landed from the smaller raft had
endeavoured to reach Cardwell by walking along the beach, but,
meeting hostile natives, had been murdered." Although only nine
of the twelve men on the raft are accounted for, there is no
reason to doubt that three more met a similar fate.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The mouth of this river now bears the name of
Gladys Inlet. In 1873, Dalrymple named the river the Johnstone,
after Sub-Inspector Johnstone, believing him to be the first to
trace it inland, and the name has stuck beyond remedy. As a
matter of fact, Lieutenant Sydney Smith, of the
"<i>Basilisk</i>," had been 10 miles up the river in a boat
during the search for the survivors of the
"<i>Maria</i>."]</blockquote>
<p>The contrast between the conduct of the natives in the case of
the Captain's boat and the smaller raft on the one hand and that
of the larger raft on the other is very remarkable. It is
possible that some difference in the attitude of the castaway
parties may have led to murder in one case and succour in the
other. Or there may have been different tribes of natives,
actuated by different ideas. It is to be hoped that the "tribe"
which received exemplary punishment for the murder of the captain
and his three men had no connection with that which saved the
lives of the occupants of the larger raft.</p>
<p>In the course of the search for the shipwrecked men, Moresby
discovered the admirable little landlocked harbour which he named
after his Navigating Lieutenant, <span class=
"a">Mourilyan</span>, with the <span class="a">Moresby
River</span> (which he named after himself) "flowing into the sea
at its south head." It may be noted that the country behind
Mourilyan Harbour was shortly afterwards surveyed by <span class=
"a">George Elphinstone Dalrymple</span>, who pronounced it fit
for the cultivation of sugar cane, and that it has since become
an important centre of the <span class="a">sugar
industry</span>.</p>
<p>The "<i>Basilisk</i>" returned to <span class=
"a">Cardwell</span> on 15th March, 1871, and sailed for Sydney
two days later, with the "<i>Peri</i>" in tow. The survivors of
the "<i>Maria</i>" were taken on board the "<i>Governor
Blackall</i>" which had been sent to Cardwell for the purpose by
the Government of New South Wales.</p>
<p>In the course of her voyage south, the "<i>Basilisk</i>"
called at the <span class="a">Percy Islands</span> and
<span class="a">Keppel Bay</span>, and the officers had the
pleasure of attending a ball in "the rising town of Rockhampton."
<span class="a">Moreton Bay</span> was reached on 27th March,
1871, and Moresby had an interview with the Governor, Lord
Normanby, and the Premier, the Hon. (afterwards Sir) Arthur
Palmer. <span class="a">Sydney</span> was reached on 6th
April.</p>

<p>A<small>FTER</small> cruising among the islands of Polynesia
from 14th May till 24th September, the "<i>Basilisk</i>" left
<span class="a">Sydney</span> on 8th December, 1872, for Torres
Strait and New Guinea. On calling at <span class=
"a">Brisbane</span>, Moresby again met the Governor, Lord
Normanby, and Mr. Palmer, the Premier, of Queensland, from whom
he learned, among other things, that the Government contemplated
the establishment of a <span class="a">mail service</span> to be
carried on by a line of steamers running between <span class=
"a">Brisbane and Singapore</span>. A survey of such portions of
the mail <i>route</i> as lay in her way, therefore, became a part
of the "<i>Basilisk's</i>" objective, and it was with much
satisfaction that <span class="a">Navigating Lieutenant
Connor</span>, R.N., was added to the surveying staff.</p>
<p>Reaching <span class="a">Cardwell</span> (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-k">MAP K</a>) on 2nd January, 1873,
<span class="a">Moresby</span> went ashore to see <span class=
"a">Mr. Brinsley Sheridan</span>, the Police Magistrate, by whom
he was informed that "the pearl-shellers had received warning
that the new Kidnapping Act, which rendered the employment of
natives illegal, without licence, had come into force, and that
they knew of the '<i>Basilisk's</i>' coming, and were clearing
out of the straits as fast as possible," "on which," says
Moresby, "I determined to make all haste north."</p>
<p>On 5th January, the two schooners, the "<i>Melanie</i>" with
fifty-five, and the "<i>Challenge</i>" with thirty-three South
Sea Islanders on board, were captured and taken to <span class=
"a">Fitzroy Island</span>. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> As
the result of an investigation held there, it appeared that the
islanders, who had been employed as divers in Torres Strait, had,
in many cases, understood that their service was to be of limited
duration, whereas some of them had served for six years, for
nothing more than food, clothing and tobacco. Others stated that
they had shipped voluntarily; some were on the ships' books as
having been legally engaged at Sydney; seven alleged that they
had been "kidnapped"; others, according to their own account, had
been run down in their canoe by a schooner named the "<i>Maria
Renny</i>" and taken on board; while another had been "seized
from a reef." There is nothing to show that the officers of the
schooners were given an opportunity of presenting their side of
the story, beyond the statement that "to secure themselves from
the penalties of the new Act, the pearl-shellers had induced
these natives to sign an agreement to serve them for five months
from August, and had fixed wages for them." "After the
investigation," says Moresby, "we sent the vessels as prizes to
Sydney, where they were condemned; but on a subsequent appeal to
the Privy Council, the highest appeal court for the colonies, the
vessels were restored, on paying all costs connected with the
case, on the grounds that retrospective evidence could not be
entertained and that an intention to procure a licence had been
proved."</p>
<blockquote>[1) Off Cape Grafton. See <a href="#map-g">Map
G.</a>]</blockquote>
<p>While the "<i>Basilisk</i>" lay at anchor off Fitzroy Island,
and the investigation was in progress, the poor "slaves" had a
merry time diving and scrubbing her copper sheathing. As "some
eighty" of them (out of a possible eighty-eight) were engaged at
once in this pastime, it was evidently a very popular
amusement.</p>
<p>On 8th January, the barque "<i>Woodbine</i>" was taken as a
prize. She had on board 20 tons of pearl-shell, gathered by
coloured labour, <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> and three South
Sea Islanders, without licence, and her men were suffering
dreadfully from scurvy.</p>
<blockquote>[1) The presumption is that the shell had been
gathered before the Act came into force: at all events, no
evidence to the contrary is adduced. Moresby, in his zeal, not
only anticipated the attitude of the labour unions of recent days
in treating as "black" any commodity which had been handled by
non-union workmen, but even made his condemnation
retrospective.]</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote class="inline">"I sent this vessel," says Moresby,
"to Brisbane, in charge of Lieutenant S. G. Smith, where she was
eventually released for want of sufficient evidence."<br>
<br>
"On the 14th," continues Moresby, "we boarded the barque
'<i>Crishna</i>,' of Sydney, and found that she had thirty-five
South Sea Islanders on board, whose history was so similar to
that of the '<i>Melanie</i>' natives that I need not relate it.
We sent her to Brisbane, where she was condemned and sold for
&pound;3,900, with her cargo, intelligence of which was very
cheering to the ship's company. This amount has since been
heavily cut, down by law expenses, and the Imperial Government
has claimed half the remainder."</blockquote>
<p>The owners of the "<i>Crishna</i>" do not appear to have
followed the course pursued by the owners of the "<i>Melanie</i>"
in appealing to the Privy Council.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">"Wishing to clear up doubt," says
Moresby, "as to the existence or non-existence of a <span class=
"a">river reported at the bottom of Lloyd's Bay</span>, we stood
in and anchored near Low Island on the evening of the 15th
[January, 1873]. [<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-c">MAP
C.</a>] The chart at this point is marked 'apparent opening of a
large river'; and it will be seen, by a glance at the map of
North Queensland, that a river would be a rich gift of Nature
here, as affording an opening into the country and a highway for
the transit of agricultural produce. Navigating Lieutenant Connor
and I, in the galley, and Mr. Mourilyan, in the gig, came to an
anchor accordingly, off the supposed entrance of the river, at 11
p.m . . . At daybreak we began our search for the river, and
explored one salt-water creek after another; but each was a
failure, and led only to entanglement in the swamp, where clouds
of mosquitoes resented our invasion of their holds. <span class=
"a">There was no river</span>. The drainage of a hill range, 6 or
7 miles inland, had created a swamp of many miles extent, covered
with mangroves and intersected by these salt-water creeks; and
that was all."</blockquote>
<p>But that was not all. The boats had simply got lost, as they
very well might, in the network of channels formed by the outlet
of a large river. Greater persistence, or a stroke of luck, would
have revealed a channel leading up to deep fresh-water reaches.
Seven years later, the writer stood on an eminence from which he
sketched the windings of a river in the bottom of a valley which
fell to the north, parallel to the coast-line, from near its head
to its mouth in Lloyd Bay. The right, or eastern, wall of the
valley was formed by a sierra to which he gave the name of
<span class="a">Macrossan Range</span>. <b style=
"color:#603000">[2]</b> The left was formed by a portion of the
"Great Dividing Range," which parts the waters of the Pacific and
the Gulf of Carpentaria, and which, for the reason that in this
locality it is a distinct geographical entity, he called the
<span class="a">McIlwraith Range</span>. <b style=
"color:#603000">[3]</b> The river itself he named the
<span class="a">Lockhart</span>. <b style="color:#603000">[4]</b>
Shortly afterwards, this river became a waterway for sandalwood
getters and gold prospectors operating in the McIlwraith and
Macrossan Ranges. These pioneers of industry established
<span class="a">Giblet's Landing</span>, at the head of the tidal
reaches. <span class="a">Mr. John Embley</span> afterwards
surveyed the lower reaches of the river and laid out a township.
(<span class="a">See</span> <a href="#map-b">MAPS B</a> AND
<a href="#map-a">A.</a>)</p>
<blockquote>[2) After the Hon. John Macrossan, Minister for
Mines.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[3) After Sir Thomas McIlwraith, Premier of
Queensland.]</blockquote>
<blockquote>[4) After Hugh Lockhart, S.S.C., Edinburgh, a friend
of his boyhood.]</blockquote>
<p>From Lloyd Bay, the "<i>Basilisk</i>" proceeded to
<span class="a">Somerset</span>, where she anchored on 18th
January, 1873. Her officers were welcomed by <span class=
"a">Frank Jardine</span>, the leader of the exploring expedition
of 1865, now acting as Police Magistrate. A service was held on
the ship by the <span class="a">Rev. A.W. Murray</span>, who had
been conducting missionary work in the South Seas for thirty-five
years. The wet season had set in. Here an interesting personage
was met, a naturalist named <span class="a">Cockerill</span>, who
lived, with his son, and a couple of natives, in an 8-ton boat,
and had amassed a magnificent collection of tropical birds.</p>
<p>The "<i>Basilisk</i>" left Somerset on 24th January, 1873, and
anchored at <span class="a">Saddle Island</span>. (<span class=
"a">See</span> <a href="#map-a">MAP A.</a>) Thence a survey was
made to <span class="a">Gabba</span>, or <span class="a">the
Brothers Islands. Jervis Island</span> was next visited, and in
this neighbourhood the "<i>Basilisk</i>" stuck on a shoal, but
got clear on the rise of the tide. Jervis Island, which is said
to be volcanic, rises to 525 feet. It was, at the date of the
"<i>Basilisk's</i>" visit, the headquarters of three pearling
stations. The anchorage was surveyed and named <span class=
"a">Philip Harbour</span>. Moresby remarks that "the space of 36
miles which lies between Jervis Island and the low
mangrove-covered coast of New Guinea is a mass of coral reefs and
contains no passage for ships and scarcely any for boats. Thus
all the passages by which ships can enter Torres Straits lie
between Jervis Island and Cape York, and are now British waters."
He adds: "The natives of Jervis Island are black Papuans, quite
uncivilised and unclothed." (Cf. Douglas on Islands of Torres
Straits, 1866.)</p>
<p><span class="a">Cornwallis Island</span> was next visited
(30th January, 1873). It is described as high and healthy, a
granite mountain rising to an altitude of 790 feet. It had
hitherto been held to be part of the mainland of New Guinea.
<span class="a">Saibai Island</span> was the next anchorage, and
was described as low and probably malarious, with 600
inhabitants, with two-story houses raised on poles, and some
cultivation. It had for the first time been charted as an island
by Moresby, who saw it in 1871 from the neighbourhood of Gabba
Island. <span class="a">Lieutenant Connor, and Mr. Pitt</span>,
Midshipman, with nine seamen, in the pinnace and a whale-boat
lent by Mr. Jardine, were left at <span class="a">Saibai
Island</span> to make a survey, while the "<i>Basilisk</i>"
sailed for the eastern islands of Torres Strait and the
<span class="a">New Guinea coast</span>. On the 4th February, she
touched at <span class="a">Warrior Island</span>, to find that
pearl-shelling had come to a standstill, thirty-two South Sea
Islanders being idle while waiting till their employers had
secured licences. Next day she went through the <span class=
"a">Basilisk Pass</span> to <span class="a">Coco-nut
Island</span>, where a Scotchman had recently established a
pearl-shell fishery and a model village. The population was
estimated at 150. Fresh water had to be brought, in bamboo tubes,
from Sue Island, 15 miles distant.</p>
<p>On 8th February, <span class="a">Darnley Island</span> was
visited. This mountainous island was then the centre of the
<i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i> industry. This dainty, destined for the
Chinese market, was at the time worth from &pound;80 to
&pound;140 per ton. <b style="color:#603000">[1]</b> "This,"
remarks Moresby, "is the only island in Torres Straits in which
<span class="a">sago palms grow</span>."</p>
<blockquote>[1) It rose to &pound;600 per ton in
1920.</blockquote>
<p>The <span class="a">Murray Islands</span> were touched at and
left behind on 11th February, and the "<i>Basilisk</i>" stood
across the Gulf of Papua for <span class="a">Redscar Bay</span>
[9&deg; 10' S.], about 200 miles distant, on the east New Guinea
coast [presumably she went out by Flinders Passage, and north of
Portlock and Lagoon Reefs, and thence E. 12&deg; N. to Redscar
Bay.&mdash;<span class="a">R.L.J.</span>], to visit the
missionary station established there, where the <span class=
"a">missionaries</span> were said to be sick and half-starving,
and to glean <span class="a">kidnapping information</span>. "Some
large rivers," says Moresby, "were reported to exist in this
neighbourhood, and we determined to explore sufficiently to make
sure." This portion of the coast had been partly surveyed by
<span class="a">Captain Owen Stanley</span> in 1849, but it was
reserved for <span class="a">Captain Moresby</span> to discover
and survey <span class="a">Port Moresby</span> (9&deg; 30' S.;
147&deg; 10' E.) and the Inner or <span class="a">Fairfax
Harbour</span>.</p>
<p>On 5th March, the "<i>Basilisk</i>" returned to <span class=
"a">Somerset</span>. On the 7th she was joined by Messrs.
<span class="a">Connor and Pitt</span>, who, with nine men, had
been left at Saibai Island six weeks before. They had made a
survey of <span class="a">Saibai</span> and <span class=
"a">Cornwallis Islands</span> and a part of the adjacent
<span class="a">New Guinea coast</span>.</p>
<p>The barque "<i>Springbok</i>" was lying at Somerset, with
eighty-five disappointed diggers, returning from the goldfields
behind Port Darwin, and was short of provisions and stores.
Moresby acted with promptitude and vigour, convened a naval
court, deposed the skipper, whose incompetence for command was
established, and put the barque in charge of Sub-Lieutenant Allan
Waters, who navigated her to Newcastle, New South Wales.</p>
<p>The <span class="a">Rev. A.W. Murray</span> and his wife, from
Sydney, had recently arrived at Somerset, where they were housed
in quarters provided by Mr. Jardine. From this station, without
even possessing a boat, Murray had essayed the impossible task of
conducting, controlling and protecting the various mission
stations scattered among the islands of Torres Strait and as far
as Redscar Bay. Moresby addressed to him a remonstrance in the
form of a report on the wretched condition of the missionaries
whom he had met with. The result was that the missionary society
provided Murray with a small steamer and some young assistants.
<b style="color:#603000">[1]</b></p>

C.M.G., Government Resident. Thursday Island. Brisbane,

<p>The tender "<i>Restless</i>" was at Somerset, with rations for
the "<i>Basilisk</i>" which had to remain in this neighbourhood
till the beginning of June, when a relieving ship was due. By
this time the air was full of rumours concerning the true object
of various Russian, French, Italian and American <span class=
"a">scientific expeditions</span> to New Guinea.</p>
<p>During the stay of the "<i>Basilisk</i>" at Somerset,
<span class="a">Navigating Lieutenant Connor</span> made a
trigonometrical survey of the harbour. When the "<i>Basilisk</i>"
left, he was left behind, with Mr. Midshipman <span class=
"a">Grant</span> as his second-in-charge, to survey the northern
shores of Torres Strait.</p>
<p>The "<i>Basilisk</i>" left Somerset on 20th March, Moresby
having been requested by Lord Normanby to assist Jardine in
looking for a better site for the settlement than Somerset.
Considerations of safe anchorage and a plentiful water supply led
him to recommend <span class="a">Hammond Island</span>, after a
short visit.</p>
<p>With the object of seeing that all was right on the pearling
stations, the "<i>Basilisk</i>" visited several islands, to find
the industry at a standstill, while the Government licences were
awaited.</p>
<p><span class="a">Cornwallis Island</span> was revisited, and
the "<i>Basilisk</i>" left for <span class="a">Warrior
Island</span> on 26th March. She left again for the east coast of
New Guinea on 28th March. <span class="a">Bramble Cay</span> and
<span class="a">Yule Island</span> were visited and the
<span class="a">Robert Hall Sound</span>, New Guinea (146&deg; 3'
E.), was surveyed, and the eastern limit of New Guinea was for
the first time correctly defined. The survey of a portion of the
north-east coast of New Guinea was then commenced.</p>
<p>On 21st April, 1873, Moresby took the "<i>Basilisk</i>"
through the <span class="a">China Strait</span>, round the
eastern end of New Guinea. The strait and the islands to the
east, <i>viz.</i>, <span class="a">Hayter, Basilisk</span> and
<span class="a">Moresby</span>, were his own discoveries. On the
24th, he <span class="a">took possession</span> of these islands
for Queen Victoria. Shortly afterwards he left the China Strait
for <span class="a">Somerset</span>, which was reached in ten
days. Here <span class="a">Connor and Grant</span> reported
themselves, having spent two laborious months in open boats, and
having surveyed 46 miles of the great <span class="a">Warrior
Reef</span> and 148 miles of the southern coast of <span class=
"a">New Guinea</span> and <span class="a">Islands</span>,
including <span class="a">Saibai</span> and <span class=
"a">Cornwallis</span>.</p>
<p>Once more the "<i>Basilisk</i>" toured the pearling stations,
to find the industry still stagnant, work having been suspended
pending the arrival of licences, and all the Polynesian labourers
sent to their homes. She finally <span class="a">left
Somerset</span> on 24th May, arriving at <span class=
"a">Brisbane</span> on 21st June, and <span class=
"a">Sydney</span> on 22nd July, 1873.</p>
<p>This was practically the last of Moresby's exploring and
surveying voyages so far as they affected the shores of Cape York
Peninsula and the islands of Torres Strait; but a vast amount of
useful work was done by him on the east and north of New Guinea
before the "<i>Basilisk</i>" was finally paid off at Sheerness on
15th December, 1874.</p>
