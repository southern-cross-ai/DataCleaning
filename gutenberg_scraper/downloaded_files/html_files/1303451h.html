  <p class="intro">A small group of qualified Englishmen have long been working
  toward Universal Peace from an angle of their own. Forming the League of Free
  Nations Association they have divided the principal problems among experts,
  for extended study, appraisal and suggestions for solution. These inquiries,
  eventually to be published in book form, will, in the Atlantic&rsquo;s
  belief, form a highly important treatise on World Peace; but, in the
  meantime, the group has united in the compilation of the following article,
  which may well serve as an introduction to all attempts at a League of
  Nations. The composite authorship of the paper is especially interesting, the
  names of the collaborators being&mdash;</p>

  <h3>§ I</h3>

  <p class="first">UNIFICATION of human affairs, to the extent at least of a
  cessation of war and a worldwide rule of international law, is no new idea;
  it can be traced through many centuries of history. It is found as an
  acceptable commonplace in a fragment, De Republica, of Cicero. It has,
  indeed, appeared and passed out of the foreground of thought, and reapeared
  there, again and again.</p>

  <p>Hitherto, however, if only on account of the limitations of geographical
  knowledge, the project has rarely been truly world-wide, though in some
  instances it has comprehended practically all the known world. Almost always
  there has been an excluded fringe of barbarians and races esteemed as less
  than men.</p>

  <p>The Roman Empire realized the idea in a limited sphere and in a
  mechanical, despotic fashion. It was inherent in the propaganda of Islam
  &mdash; excluding the unbeliever. It may be said that the political unity of
  Christendom overriding states and nations was the orthodox and typical
  doctrine of the Middle Ages. The individual states were regarded as being, in
  the nature of things, members of one great body politic, presided over by the
  Pope, or the Emperor, or both. It was the idea of the world supremacy of the
  Empire which inspired Dante&rsquo;s De Monarchia; but, as Lord Bryce has
  remarked, &rsquo;Dante&rsquo;s book was an epilogue instead of a
  prophecy.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>It cannot be claimed that history shows any continuously progressive
  movement of human affairs from a dispersed to a unified condition. Rather it
  tells a story of the oscillating action of separatist and unifying forces.
  And the process of civilization itself, if we use the word in its narrower
  and older sense of the elaboration of citizenship in a political and social
  organization, and exclude mechanical and scientific progress from it, has on
  the whole been rather on the side of fragmentation. It was, for example, much
  easier for loosely organized tribes and village communities scattered over
  wide areas to coalesce into vague and often very extensive
  &lsquo;nations,&rsquo; like the Scythians and Thracians, or to cooperate in
  &lsquo;amplictyonics,&rsquo; or federations, like the small peoples of
  central Greece, than for highly developed city-states or fully organized
  monarchies, possessing a distinctive culture and religion and definite
  frontiers, to sink these things in any larger union. For such higher forms of
  political organization, enlargement occurred mainly through conquest., which
  created unstable empire systems of subject and subordinate peoples under the
  sway &mdash; which might of course be the assimilative sway &mdash; of a
  dominant nation, rather than real unifications.</p>

  <p>The Renaissance presents a phase in history in which a large vague
  unification (Christendom) is seen to be breaking up simultaneously with the
  appearance of a higher grade of national organization. Machiavelli, with his
  aspiration toward a united Italy, involving a distintegration of the Empire,
  opened the phase of the national state in Europe, which reached its fullest
  development in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. Before
  the Renaissance Europe was far more of a unity than it was at the close of
  the reign of Queen Victoria, when it consisted mainly of a group of nations,
  with their national edges sharpened and hardened almost to a maximum, each
  aspiring to empire and each acutely suspicious of and hostile to its
  neighbors. The idea of international organization for peace seemed far more
  Utopian to the normal European intelligence in 1900 than it would have done
  eight hundred years before.</p>

  <p>But while those political and social developments which constitute
  civilization in the narrower sense of the word were tending to make human
  societies, as they became more elaborately organized, more heterogeneous and
  mutually unsympathetic, there were also coming into play throughout the
  eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, for the first time, upon a quite
  unprecedented scale, another series of forces diametrically opposed to human
  separations. They worked, however, mutely, because the world of thought was
  unprepared for them. Unprecedented advances in technical and scientific
  knowledge were occurring, and human cooperation and the reaction of man upon
  man, not only in material but also in mental things, was being made
  enormously more effective than it had ever been before. But the phrases of
  international relationship were not altering to correspond. Phrases usually
  follow after rather than anticipate reality, and so it was that at the
  outbreak of the Great War in August, 1914, Europe and the world awoke out of
  a dream of intensified nationality to a new system of realities which were
  entirely antagonistic to the continuance of national separations.</p>

  <p>It is necessary to state very plainly the nature of these new forces. Upon
  them rests the whole case for the League of Nations as it is here presented.
  It is a new case. It is argued here that these forces give us powers novel in
  history and bring mankind face to face with dangers such as it has never
  confronted before. It is maintained that, on the one hand, they render
  possible such a reasoned coordination of human affairs as has never hitherto
  been conceivable, and that, on the other, they so enlarge and intensify the
  scope and evil of war and of international hostility as to give what was
  formerly a generous aspiration more and more of the aspect of an imperative
  necessity. Under the lurid illumination of the world war, the idea of world-
  unification has passed rapidly from the sphere of the literary idealist into
  that of the methodical, practical man, and the task of an examination of its
  problems and possibilities, upon the scale which the near probability of an
  actual experiment demands, is thrust upon the world.</p>

  <p>All political and social institutions, all matters of human relationship,
  are dependent upon the means by which mind may react upon mind and life upon
  life, that is to say upon the intensity, rapidity, and reach of mental and
  physical communication. In the history of mankind, the great phases seem all
  to be marked by the appearance of some new invention which facilitates trade
  or intercourse, and may be regarded as the operating cause of the new phase.
  The invention of writing, of the wheel and the road, of the ship, of money,
  of printing, of letters of exchange, of joint-stock undertakings and limited
  liability, mark distinct steps in the enlargement of human intercourse and
  cooperation from its original limitation within the verbal and traditional
  range of the family or tribe.</p>

  <p>A large part of the expansion of the Roman Empire, apart from its overseas
  development, may be considered, for example, as a process of road-making and
  bridge-building. Even its trans-Mediterranean development was a matter of
  road-making combined with ship-building. The Roman Empire, like the Chinese,
  expanded on land to an extremity determined by the new method of road-
  communication; and sought to wall itself in at last at the limits of its
  range from its centres of strength. The new chapter of the human story again,
  which began with the entry of America and the Oceanic lands upon the stage of
  history, was the direct outcome of that bold sailing out upon the oceans
  which the mariner&rsquo;s compass, and the supersession of the galley by the
  development of sails and rigging, rendered possible. The art of printing from
  movable types released new powers of suggestion, documentation, and
  criticism, which shattered the old religious organization of Christendom,
  made the systematic investigations and records of modern science possible,
  and created the vast newspaper-reading democracies of to-day. The whole of
  history could, indeed, be written as a drama of human nature reacting to
  invention.</p>

  <p>And we live to-day in a time of accelerated inventiveness and innovation,
  when a decade modifies the material of inter-communication far more
  extensively than did any century before, in range, swiftness, and intensity
  alike. Within the present century, since 1900, there have been far more
  extensive changes in these things than occurred in the ten centuries before
  Christ. Instead of regarding Around the World in Eighty Days as an amazing
  feat of hurry, we can now regard a flight about the globe in fifteen or
  sixteen days as a reasonable and moderate performance. The teaching of
  history compels us to recognize in these new facilities factors which will
  necessarily work out into equally revolutionary social and political
  consequences. It is the most obvious wisdom to set ourselves to anticipate as
  far as we can, so as to mitigate and control, the inevitable collisions and
  repercussions of mankind that are coming upon us. Even if we were to suppose
  that this rush of novel accelerating contrivances would be presently checked,
  &mdash; and there is little justification for any such supposition, &mdash;
  it would still behoove us to work out the influence which the things already
  achieved will have upon our kind.</p>

  <p>And it is not simply an increase of range and swiftness that we have to
  consider here, though these are the aspects that leap immediately to the eye.
  There has also been, for example, a very great increase in the possible
  vividness of mental impact. In education and in the agencies of journalism
  and propaganda, there has been an increase of power at present incalculable,
  owing to vast strides in the printing of pictures, and to the cinematograph,
  the gramaphone, and similar means of intense world-wide information and
  suggestion.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>§ II</h3>

  <p class="first">While all these things, on the one hand, point plainly now
  to such possibilities of human unification and world unanimity as no one
  could have dreamed of a hundred years ago, there has been, on the other hand,
  a change, an intensification, of the destructive processes of war which opens
  up a black alternative to this pacific settlement of human affairs. The case
  as it is commonly stated in the propaganda literature for a League of Nations
  is a choice between, on the one hand, a general agreement on the part of
  mankind to organize a permanent peace, and on the other, a progressive
  development of the preparation for war and the means of conducting war which
  must ultimately eat up human freedom and all human effort, and, as the phrase
  goes, destroy civilization. We shall find as we proceed that these simple
  oppositions do not by any means state all the possibilities of the case; but
  for a moment or so it will be convenient to confine our attention to this
  enhancement of the cost, burden, and destructiveness of belligerence which
  scientific and technical progress has made inevitable.</p>

  <p>What has happened is essentially this, that the natural limitations upon
  warfare which have existed hitherto appear to have broken down. Hitherto
  there has been a certain proportion between the utmost exertion of a nation
  at war and the rest of its activities. The art and methods of war have had a
  measurable relation to the resources of the community as a whole, so that it
  has been possible for nations to be well armed by the standards of the time
  and yet to remain vigorous and healthy communities, and to wage successful
  wars without exhaustion.</p>

  <p>To take a primitive example, it was possible for the Zulu people, under
  King Chaka, to carry warfare as it was then understood in South Africa
  &mdash; a business of spearmen fighting on foot &mdash; to its utmost
  perfection, and to remain prosperous and happy themselves, whatever might be
  the fate they inflicted upon their neighbors. And even the armies of
  Continental Europe, as they existed before the Great War, were manifestly
  bearable burdens, because they were borne. But the outbreak of that struggle
  forced upon the belligerents, in spite of the natural conservatism of all
  professional soldiers, a rapid and logical utilization of the still largely
  neglected resources of mechanical and chemical science; they were compelled
  to take up every device that offered, however costly it might be; they could
  not resist the drive toward scientific war which they had themselves
  released. In warfare the law of the utmost immediate exertion rules; the
  combatant who does not put in all his possible energy is lost. In four brief
  years, therefore, Europe was compelled to develop a warfare monstrously out
  of proportion to any conceivable good which the completest victory could
  possibly achieve for either side.</p>

  <p>We may take as a typical instance of this logical and necessary
  exaggeration which warfare has undergone the case of the &lsquo;tank.&rsquo;
  The idea of a land ironclad was an old and very obvious one, which had been
  disliked and resisted by military people for many years. The substantial
  basis of the European armies of 1914 was still a comparatively inexpensive
  infantry, assisted by machineguns and field-guns and cavalry. By 1918 the
  infantry line is sustained by enormous batteries of guns of every calibre,
  firing away an incredible wealth of ammunition; its structure includes the
  most complicated system of machine-gun nests and strong posts conceivable,
  and every important advance is preceded by lines of aeroplanes and sustained
  by fleets of these new and still developing weapons, the tanks. Every battle
  sees scores of these latter monsters put out of action. Now, even the
  primitive tank of 1917 costs, quite apart from the very high running
  expenses, something between seven and ten thousand pounds. At that stage it
  was still an expedient on trial and in the rough. But its obvious corollary
  in movable big-gun forts with ammunition tenders &mdash; forts which will
  probably be made in parts and built up near to the point of use, however
  costly they may be &mdash; is practically dictated if war is to continue. So
  too is a production of light and swift types of tank that will serve many of
  the purposes of cavalry.</p>

  <p>If war is to continue as a human possibility, this elaboration of the tank
  in scale and species follows inevitably. A mere peace of the old type is
  likely to accelerate rather than check this elaboration. Only a peace that
  will abolish the probability of war from human affairs can release the
  nations from the manifest necessity of cultivating the tank, multiplying the
  tank, and maintaining a great manufacture and store of tanks, over and above
  all the other belligerent plants which they had to keep going before 1914.
  And these tanks will supersede nothing &mdash; unless perhaps, to a certain
  extent, cavalry. The tank, growing greater and greater and more numerous and
  various, is manifestly, therefore, one new burden &mdash; one of many new
  burdens &mdash; which must rest upon the shoulders of mankind henceforth,
  until the prospect of war can be shut off from international affairs. It is
  foolish to ignore these grimly budding possibilities of the tank. There they
  are, and they cannot be avoided if war is to go on.</p>

  <p>But the tank is only one of quite a multitude of developments, which are
  bound to be followed up if the modern war-process continues. There is no help
  for it. In every direction there is the same story to be told &mdash; if war
  is still to be contemplated as a possibility &mdash; of an unavoidable
  elaboration of the means of war beyond the scale of any conceivable war
  end.</p>

  <p>As a second instance, let us take the growth in size, range, and
  destructiveness of the air war. Few people realize fully what a vast thing
  the air-service has become. A big aeroplane of the raider type may cost
  anything up to twenty thousand pounds; the smallest costs not much less than
  a thousand. The pilot and the observer are of the very flower of the youth of
  the country; they have probably cost society many thousands of pounds&rsquo;
  worth of upbringing and education, and they have made little or no productive
  contribution to human resources. And these costs units have been multiplied
  enormously. From a poor hundred or so of aerial planes at the outset of the
  war, Great Britain alone has expanded her air forces until she has an output
  of thousands of new machines a month, aerodromes abound throughout the
  country, and there is scarcely a corner of England where the hum of the
  passing aeroplane is not to be heard. Now all this vast plant of aeroplane
  factories and instruction aerodromes must be kept up, once it has been
  started, war or no war, until war is practically impossible. It may be
  argued, perhaps, that during a peace-spell some portion of this material may
  be applied to civil air-transport; but the manufacturers have made it
  abundantly clear that this project does not strike them as reasonable or
  desirable; their industry has been created as an armament industry and an
  armament industry they wish it to remain. And besides this opposition of the
  interested profiteer, we have to remember that the aeroplane has imported
  into warfare possibilities of surprise hitherto undreamed of. So long as a
  sudden declaration of war, or an attack preceding a declaration of war, is
  possible, it is imperative now, not only that the air force of a country
  should be kept always in striking condition, but that the whole vast
  organization of coastal and frontier anti-aircraft defenses should be equally
  ready. Tens of thousands of men, most of them economically very valuable,
  must keep watch day and night, prepared at any moment to flash into warfare
  again.</p>

  <p>The same story of a tremendous permanent expansion of war-equipment could
  be repeated in a score of parallel instances drawn from the land war and sea
  war. Enormous new organizations of anti-submarine flotillas, of minefield
  material and its production, of poison-gas manufacture and the like, have
  been called into existence, and must now remain as going concerns so long as
  war is likely to be renewed.</p>

  <p>But enough examples have been cited here to establish the reality of this
  present unrestricted, illimitable, disproportionate growth of the war-process
  in comparison with all other human processes. Mars has become the young
  cuckoo in the nest of human possibilities, and it is &mdash; to state the
  extreme alternatives &mdash; a choice before mankind, whether we will drift
  on toward a catastrophe due to that overgrowth, or so organize the world as
  effectually to restrain and reduce warfare.</p>

  <p>It is not impossible to adumbrate the general nature of the catastrophe
  which threatens mankind if war-making goes on. Modern warfare is not
  congenial to the working masses anywhere. No doubt the primitive form of
  warfare, a murderous bickering with adjacent tribes, is natural enough to
  uneducated men; but modern warfare, and still more the preparation for it,
  involves distresses, strains, and a continuity of base and narrow purpose
  quite beyond the patience and interest of the millions of ordinary men who
  find no other profit in it but suffering. The natural man is more apt for
  chaotic local fighting than for large-scale systematic fighting. Hatred
  campaigns and a sustained propaganda are needed to keep up the combatant
  spirit in a large modern state, even during actual hostilities; and in the
  case of Russia we have a striking example of the distaste a whole population
  may develop for the war-strain, even during the war and with the enemy at its
  gates.</p>

  <p>What is likely to happen, then, when the working masses of Central and
  Western Europe, being no longer sustained by the immediate excitement of
  actual war, find themselves still obliged to go on, year after year,
  producing vast masses of war-material, pledged to carry a heavy burden of war
  loan rentiers on their backs, and subjected to an exacerbated conscription?
  Possibly, so far as the rentier burden on the worker goes, a great rise in
  prices and wages will relieve the worker to some extent, but only at the cost
  of acute disappointment and distress at another social level. There is a
  dangerously narrowing limit now to the confidence of the common man in the
  intelligence and good faith of those who direct his affairs; and the
  probability of a cruel confused class-war throughout Europe, roughly parallel
  in its methods to the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, and released by a
  similar loss of faith in leaders and government, appears at the end of the
  vista of waste of directive energy and natural resources, completing that
  waste of energy and resources into which the belligerent systems of Europe,
  the German Empire being the chief and foremost, have led mankind. Systematic
  force, overstrained and exhausted, will then give place to chaotic force, and
  general disorganization will ensue. Thereafter the world may welter in
  confusion for many generations, through such ruinous and impoverished
  centuries as close the Roman imperial story, before it develops the vitality
  for an effective reorganization.</p>

  <p>Such, roughly, is the idea of the phrase &lsquo;downfall of
  civilization&rsquo; as used in discussions like these. It is a vision of the
  world as a social system collapsing chaotically, not under the assault of
  outer barbarians, but beneath the pressure of this inevitable hypertrophy of
  war.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>§ III</h3>

  <p class="first">Let us now look a little more closely between the two
  extremes of possibility we have stated in the preceding section, between a
  world-unanimity for peace, on the one hand, &mdash; Everyman&rsquo;s World
  League of Nations, &mdash; and a world-collapse under the overgrowth of
  war-organization and material, on the other.</p>

  <p>The affairs of the world are now in a posture which enables us to dismiss
  the idea of a world hegemony for Germany, or for any other single power, as a
  fantastic vanity.</p>

  <p>We have to consider, however, the much greater probability of a group of
  the more powerful states, including perhaps a chastened Germany, agreeing
  among themselves to organize and enforce peace in the world for ever. This
  would give us still a third type of league which we may call the League of
  the Senior States. It is perhaps the most probable of all the
  possibilities.</p>

  <p>And, on the other hand, we have assumed, quite crudely, in the first
  section that the forces of popular insurrection are altogether destructive of
  organization, whereas there may be as yet unmeasured constructive and
  organizing power in the popular mind. There is a middle way between a
  superstitious belief in unguided democracy and a frantic hatred of it.
  Concurrently, for example, with the earlier phases of Bolshevik anarchy in
  Petrograd and Moscow, there seems to have been for a time a considerable
  development of cooperative production and distribution throughout European
  and Asiatic Russia. Mingled with much merely destructive and vindictive
  insurrectionism, there may be a popular will to order, reaching out to
  cooperate with all the sound and liberal forces of the old system of things.
  We can only guess as yet at the possibilities of a collective will in these
  peasant and labor masses of Europe which now read and write and have new-born
  ideas of class-action and responsibility. They will be ill-informed, they may
  be emotional, but they may have vast reserves of common sense. Much may
  depend upon the unforeseeable accident of great leaders. Nearly every
  socialist and democratic organization in the world, it is to be noted, now
  demands the League of Nations in some form, and men may arise who will be
  able to give that stir quite vague demand force and creative definition. A
  failure to achieve a world guaranty of peace on the part of the diplomatists
  at a peace conference may lead, indeed, to a type of insurrection and
  revolution not merely destructive but preparatory. It is conceivable. The
  deliberate organization of peace, as distinguished from a mere silly clamor
  for peace, may break out at almost any social level, and in the form either
  of a constructive, an adaptive, or a revolutionary project.</p>

  <p>We have not, therefore, here, a case of a clear cut choice of two ways;
  there is a multitude of roads which may converge upon the permanent
  organization of world peace, and an infinitude of thwarting and delaying
  digressions may occur. Complicating and mitigating circumstances may, and
  probably will, make this antagonism of war and peace a lengthy and tortuous
  drama. There may be many halts and setbacks in the inevitable development of
  war; belligerence may pause and take breath on several occasions before its
  ultimate death flurry.</p>

  <p>Such delays, such backwater phases and secondary aspects, must not confuse
  the issue and hide from us the essential fact of the disappearance of any
  real limitation upon the overgrowth of war in human life. That unlimited
  overgrowth is the probability which is driving more and more men to study and
  advocate this project of a League of Nations, because they are convinced that
  only through counter-organization of the peace-will in mankind can the world
  be saved from a great cycle of disasters, disorder, and retrogression.</p>

  <p>And it does not follow, because the origins and motives of the will for
  such a world-league are various, that they involve a conflict over
  essentials, as to the character of the final result. It is the declared
  belief of many of the promoters of the world-league movement that a careful
  analysis of the main factors of its problems, a scientific examination of
  what is possible, what is impossible, what is necessary, and what is
  dangerous, must lead the mass of reasonable men in the world, whatever their
  class, origins, traditions, and prejudices, to a practical agreement upon the
  main lines of this scheme for the salvation of mankind. It is believed that
  the clear, deliberate, and methodical working out of the broad problems and
  riddles of the world-league idea will beve a sufficient compelling force to
  bring it within the realm of practical possibility.</p>

  <h3>§ IV</h3>

  <p class="first">But at this point it is advisable to take up and dispose of
  a group of suggestions which contradict our fundamental thesis, which is,
  that war is by its nature illimitable. War is, we hold here, a cessation of
  law, and in war therefore, it is impossible to prevent permanently the use of
  every possible device for injury, killing, and compulsion which human
  ingenuity can devise or science produce. Our main argument for a League of
  Nations rests on that. But there are people who do not accept as a fact the
  illimitable nature of war. They fall back upon the theory that the horrors of
  the Great War are due to a sort of accidental relapse into savagery on the
  part of the German people, and that future wars can and will be conducted
  under restrictions imposed by humanity and chivalry. They believe that war
  can become a conventional Ordeal by Battle, in which the nations shall
  deliberately refrain from putting forth their full strength, and shall agree
  to abide by the decision of a struggle between limited armies, operating,
  like the champions in a tournament or a prize-fight, under an accepted code
  of rules.</p>

  <p>This is, we hold, a delusion. Our case is that the nations can agree far
  more easily to abolish war than to restrict war.</p>

  <p>It is true that in the Great War Germany has carried her theories of
  ruthlessness to self-defeating extremes. She has done many deeds which
  recoiled upon herself &mdash; deeds inspired by a sort of ferocious pedantry
  which inflicted very small material damage upon the Allies, but hardened
  their resolution and brought thousands, nay, millions of recruits to their
  ranks. None the less must we face the fact that, individual stupidities
  apart, the German theory of war is the only logical one.</p>

  <p>If it be said that, in past times, nations fought with comparatively small
  armies, and often accepted defeat without having thrown anything like their
  full strength into the struggle &mdash; the objection is met by a twofold
  answer. Firstly, the logic of war, the law &mdash; as we have termed it
  elsewhere &mdash; of the utmost effort, had not yet been thoroughly thought
  out. Primitive peoples in general &mdash; and the same applies to all but the
  most civilized and sophisticated of modern states &mdash; are guided in
  matters of war and peace more by their emotions than by their reason. They
  are lazy, as peoples, and muddle-headed. They fight because they are angry;
  they stop because they are tired; they cease pursuing the enemy because they
  want to attend to the harvest. It is the mark of a highly organized and
  intellectualized government to subordinate national emotions to the
  remorseless logic of the case. And the logic of war was reserved for Napoleon
  to express in practice and Clausewitz to formulate in theory.</p>

  <p>But the second answer goes more to the root of the matter: namely, that
  the strength which a nation can put into the field is limited by many
  conditions both material and psychological, and that, if we examine into
  these conditions, we shall often find that what may seem to us, on the face
  of it, an insignificant effort, was in very truth the greatest of which, at
  the given moment, the nation was capable. It is a quite new social fact, a
  creation of the last fifty years, to have a central government supplied with
  exact information about all its resources in men, money, and material, and
  with means of organization and control which enable it, at the cost of some
  delay and friction, to exploit those resources to the last inch. When Babylon
  was captured by the Medes, we are told, there were parts of the city itself
  which were unaware of the fact for several days; and there must have been
  vast islands of population in the country which, so far as their personal
  experience went, never knew. But that sort of thing has passed.</p>

  <p>If we look into the history of warfare, we find that it has completed a
  cycle and is now returning to its starting-point. A nomadic horde of the
  barbarous ages was &lsquo;a nation in arms&rsquo; in the full sense of the
  word. Having no fixed place of abode, it had no civil &mdash; as distinct
  from military &mdash; population. The whole people &mdash; old men, women,
  and children included &mdash; took part in the toils and perils of war. There
  were no places of security in which the weak and the defenseless could take
  refuge. Everyone&rsquo;s life was forfeit in case of disaster; therefore
  everyone took part in the common defense. Modern warfare, with its air
  fleets, its submarines, and its &lsquo;big Berthas,&rsquo; is more and more
  restricting the area of immunity from military peril and reverting to these
  primitive conditions.</p>

  <p>Agricultural life and city settlements brought with them the distinction
  between combatants and non-combatants; but still, in the normal state, every
  able-bodied citizen was a soldier. The citizen took his place as a matter of
  course in the militia of his country, leaving to old men and women, or to
  slaves and captives, the guardianship of field and vineyard, flock and herd.
  Only when wealth and luxury had reached a certain pitch did the habit of
  employing denationalized mercenaries creep in. Then came the time when the
  mercenaries encountered nomadic or thoroughly mobilized &lsquo;nations in
  arms,&rsquo; and civilization went to the wall.</p>

  <p>In the Middle Ages, the feudal chief, the dominant, soldierly, often
  predatory personality, gathered his vassals around him for purposes of
  offense and defense, while the cultivation of the soil devolved on the
  villains or serfs. Thus war became the special function of a military caste,
  and, as in the Wars of the Roses, campaigns were often carried on with
  comparatively little disturbance to the normal life of the country. When the
  royal power crushed or absorbed that of the barons, the centralized monarchy
  everywhere recruited a standing army, often consisting largely of foreign
  mercenaries, as the bulwark of its security and the instrument of its will.
  It was quite natural that dynastic wars, and wars in which the common people
  of the contending nations had little or no interest, should be fought out on
  a restricted scale by these specialized military machines. Frederick the
  Great employed a mercenary army as the nucleus for a national militia; and so
  lately as the beginning of the last century, this system was celebrated as
  ideal by the noted military authority who was the immediate predecessor of
  Clausewitz.</p>

  <p>With Napoleon came the Nation in Arms; and the military history of the
  intervening years has consisted of the ever completer concentration upon
  warlike purposes of the whole powers and resources of the great European
  peoples.</p>

  <p>If it be asked why this logical evolution of the idea of war has taken so
  many centuries to work itself out, the main reason &mdash; among many others
  &mdash; may be stated in two words: munitions and transport. Before the age
  of machines, it was impossible to arm and clothe immense multitudes of men;
  before the days of McAdam and Stephenson, it was impossible to move such
  multitudes and, still more, to keep them supplied with food and munitions.
  Again we find ourselves insisting upon the vital importance of transit
  methods in this, as in nearly all questions of human interaction. The size of
  armies has steadily grown with the growth of means of communication. The
  German wars of 1863-70 were the first in which railways played any
  considerable part, and the scale of operations in 1870-71 was quite
  unprecedented. See &ldquo;The Idea of a League of Nations, Part II&rdquo;</p>

  <p>What is the chief new factor since the days of St. Privat and Sedan? The
  aeroplane, most people would reply; possibly it may become so, but thus far a
  less picturesque invention has been of even greater influence &mdash; the
  motor-lorry. No one can go anywhere near the Western Front without realizing
  that the gigantic scale of this struggle is almost wholly dependent upon
  motor-traction. Had not the internal-combustion engine been invented, the war
  would probably have been over long ago; and at all events millions of men
  would still be alive and well who now lie dead or crawl mutilated over the
  face of the earth.</p>

  <p>Seen in this light, the invention of the motor may appear to have been due
  to a special interference of Satan in human affairs. But that is an
  unphilosophical view to take. Our race must perfect its power over matter
  before it can wisely select the ends to which it will apply that power. The
  idea of war had to work itself out to the full and demonstrate its own
  immpossibility, before man could find the insight and the energy to put it
  behind him and have done with it. Thanks to Prussian ambition and Prussian
  philosophy, the demonstration has now been completed. The idea of war has
  revealed itself in its full hideousness. All the world has come to look upon
  it as a sort of mythological monster which, if left to itself, will
  periodically reemerge from hell, to devour the whole youth and the whole
  wealth of civilized mankind. It is useless to dream of clipping the wings or
  paring the claws of the dragon. It must be slain outright if it is not to
  plan unthinkable havoc with civilization; and to that end the intelligence
  and the moral enthusiasm of the world are now, as we see, addressing
  themselves.</p>

  <h2><a id="pt2"
     name="pt2">PART TWO</a></h2>

  <h3>§ I</h3>

  <p class="first">ANY people have said to themselves like Jeannette in the
  touching old ballad, &mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">If I were King of France, or, still better, Pope of
  Rome,<br>
  I'd have no fighting men abroad, no weeping maids at home;<br>
  All the world should be at peace, or, if kings must show their might,<br>
  Then let those who make the quarrels be the only men to fight.</p>

  <p>But even Jeannette evidently realized that the idea of making the fate of
  a tribe or a nation depend upon the fortunes of one or two selected champions
  was but a pious aspiration, which not even the King of France or the Pope of
  Rome could translate into practical politics.</p>

  <p>There is one theory, indeed, which, if we accept its initial postulate,
  would make limited warfare logical. If battle be regarded as the trial of a
  cause before the judgment-seat of God, there is no sound reason for pouring
  huge armies into it. It is manifest that God can deliver his verdict in the
  result of a duel of one against one, quite as well as in the result of a war
  between whole nations in arms. On this theory, war would be an extension to
  politics of the 'wager of battle' between individuals &mdash; a method of
  obtaining a supernatural ruling, indistinguishable in principle from the
  drawing of lots or tossing of a coin. But although men have always talked,
  and still talk, of 'appealing to the God of Battles,' they have never shown
  any disposition to accept, save at the last gasp, a judgment which ran
  counter to their passions or their cupidities. Whatever may have been their
  professions, their practical belief has always been that 'God is on the side
  of the big battalions,' or, in other words, that war is a part of the natural
  order of things, the immeasurable network of cause and effect, and no more
  subject to special interventions of Providenec than commerce, or navigation,
  or any other form of human activity. Nor is there any reason to suppose that
  they will ever believe otherwise. If it be difficult to conceive them, in
  their disputes, abiding by the awards of impartial reason, it is a hundred
  times more difficult to conceive them accepting the wholly unreasonable
  awards of artificially and arbitrarily restricted violence.</p>

  <p>These truths are so obvious that it may seem idle to insist upon them.
  Nobody, it may be said, proposes that Paris and Berlin should in future
  settle their disputes, like Rome and Alba Longa, by selecting three champions
  apiece and setting them to cut each others' throats. In this crude and
  elementary form, indeed, the proposal does not appear; but disguised
  applications of the same principle are constantly commended in the writings
  of those who, holding war to be eternally inevitable, seeks refuge from sheer
  despair in the belief that it is possible to subject it to rule and limit,
  and say to it, 'Thus far shalt thou go and no further.' They cannot or will
  not see that any conventional limitation is foreign to its very essence. It
  is perfectly possible, and consonant with human nature that nations should
  agree not to appeal to force, and should hold to that agreement even when one
  or the other believes itself to have suffered injustice. But it is utterly
  impossible and inconsistent with human nature that, having appealed to force,
  they should agree to exercise it only within limits, and accept
  impoverishment, humiliation, servitude, &mdash; in a word, defeat, &mdash;
  rather than transgress the stipulated boundaries.</p>

  <p>It may be objected that codes of law have in fact been devised for the
  partial humanization of war, and that not until the present time has any
  civilized belligerent made a practice of disregarding them. But these
  so-called laws of war have always been conventions of mutual advantage
  &mdash; rules which all parties held it to be, on the whole, to their own
  interest to observe. The German WarBook quite frankly places the chief
  sanction of such trammels upon military action not in humanity, but in the
  fear of reprisals. We do not deny that man is an emotional being, and even in
  the midst of his fiercest fighting there are horrors from which the decent
  man, and even the decent multitude, instinctively recoils. Decent men do not,
  as a rule want to hurt their wounded prisoners, they rather like to pet them;
  and they regard people who do otherwise as blackguards. And no doubt it is
  largely these emotional mercies and generosities which have brought about
  those rules of chivalry or scruples of religion which form the supposed
  'redeeming features' of war. But the necessities of war completely override
  all such weaknesses as soon as these begin to endanger actual military
  interests. And the logic of war tolerates them only as cheap concessions to a
  foolish popular psychology. It must be remembered that undisguised atrocities
  on a stupendous scale &mdash; such, for instance as the massacre in cold
  blood of whole regiments of helpless prisoners would be too strong for the
  stomach of even the most brutalized people, and would tend to bring war into
  discredit with all but its monomaniac votaries. If we look closely enough, we
  shall find that all Geneva Conventions and such palliative ordinances, though
  excellent in intention and good in their immediate effects, make ultimately
  for the persistence of war as an institution. They are sops to humanity,
  devices for rendering war barely tolerable to civilized mankind, and so
  staving off the inevitable rebellion against its abominations.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>§ II</h3>

  <p class="first">Criticisms of thc project of a League of Nations have
  consisted hitherto largely of the statement of difficulties and impediments,
  rather than of reasons for rejection of the project. All such criticisms are
  helpful in so far as they enable us to map out the task before us, but none
  are adequate as conclusive objections. Few of the advocates of an organized
  world-peace fail to recognize the magnitude of the task to which they invite
  men to set themselves. But their main contention is that there is really no
  alternative to the attempt but resignation to long years of human suffering
  and disaster, and therefore that, however difficult the enterprise may be, it
  has to be faced. The recital of the difficulties is, they say, a stimulus to
  thought and exertion rather than a deterrent.</p>

  <p>And there are certain objections to the undertaking as such that must be
  taken up and dealt with in a preliminary discussion.</p>

  <p>There is, first, an objection which it will be convenient to speak of as
  the 'Biological Objection.' It is stated in various forms, and it peeps out
  and manifests itself in the expressed thoughts and activities of quite a
  number of people who do not seem to have formulated it completely. But what
  many of these objectors think and what still more feel may be expressed in
  some such phraseology as this: &mdash;</p>

  <p>Life is conflict and is begotten of conflict. All the good qualities of
  life are the result of the tragic necessities of survival. Life, stripped
  down to its fundamental fact, is the vehement urgency of individuals or
  groups of individuals to survive, and to reproduce and multiply their kind.
  The pressure of individual upon individual and of species upon species
  sharpens the face of life and is the continuing impetus and interest in life.
  The conception of life without war is a collection, therefore, not simply
  utopian but millennial. It is a proposal that every kind and sort and type of
  humanity should expand and increase without limit in a small world of
  restricted resources. It is, in fact, absurd. It is an impossible attempt to
  arrest and stereotype a transient phase of human life. It is inviting
  paralysis as a cure for epilepsy. It is a dream of fatigued minds. Terrible
  as the scope and nature of human warfare have become, it has to be faced. The
  more destructive it is, the more rapid the hardening and evolution of the
  species life and history move cyclically from phase to phase, and perhaps
  such an apparent retrogression as we mean when we talk of the breakdown of
  civilization, may be only part of a great rhythm in the development of the
  species. Let us gather together with our own kind, and discipline and harden
  ourselves, in a heroic resolve to survive in the unavoidable centuries of
  harsh conflict ahead of us.</p>

  <p>Now, here is a system of objection not lightly to be brushed aside. True,
  the element of mutual conflict in life is often grossly overstated and the
  element of mutual help suppressed. But, although overstated, there are valid
  criticisms here of any merely negative league of nations project, any mere
  proposal to end war without replacing it by some other collective process.
  There do seem to be some advocates of the league whose advocacy is little
  more than a cry of terror at the disappearance of established wealth, the
  loss of wasted leisure, and the crumbling of accepted dignities. Those who
  have faith in the possibility of a world league are bound &mdash; just as the
  Socialist is bound &mdash; to produce some assurances of a control over the
  blind pressure of population, that may otherwise swamp the world with
  prolific low grade races. They are bound to show that their schemes are
  compatible with a series of progressive readjustments, and not an attempt to
  restore and stereotype the boundaries, the futile institutions, and the
  manifest injustices of the world of 1914, with only armaments abolished. They
  are bound to show that exceptional ability and energy will have, not merely
  scope, but fuller scope for expression, achievement, and perpetuation, in the
  new world to which they point us, than in the old. In the years to come, as
  in the whole past history of life, individual must compete against
  individual, type against type.</p>

  <p>But having made these admissions, we may then go on to point out two
  fundamental misconceptions which entirely vitiate the biological argument as
  an argument for the continuation of war as a method of human selection. It is
  falsely assumed, first, that modern war is a discriminatory process,
  selecting certain types as against certain other types; whereas it is largely
  a catastrophic and indiscriminate process and secondly, that belligerent
  states are in the nature of biological units super-individuals, which either
  triumph or are destroyed; whereas they are systems of political entanglement
  of the most fluid, confused, and transitory description. They neither
  reproduce their kind nor die; they change indefinitely: the children of the
  defeated state of to-day may become the dominant citizens of its victorious
  competitor in a generation or so. They do not even embody traditions or
  ideas: France, which went into the Revolutionary wars at the end of the
  eighteenth century to establish the Republican idea throughout Europe,
  emerged as an empire; and the defeat of the Russian by the German imperialism
  led to Lenin's 'dictatorship of the proletariat.'</p>

  <p>The essence of success in the biological struggle for existence is
  preferential reproduction; whereas the modern war process takes all the
  sturdier males to kill and be killed haphazard, while it sends all the more
  intelligent and energetic girls into munition factories, substitute work, and
  suchlike sterilizing occupations. If it prefers any type for prosperity and
  multiplication, it is the alert shirker, the able tax-dodger, and the war
  profiteer; if it breeds anything it breeds parasites. The vital statistics of
  Germany, which is certainly the most perfect as a belligerent of all the
  belligerent states engaged, show already tremendous biological injuries.
  Germany in the first four years of the war had lost by the fall in her birth-
  rate alone nearly 2,600,000 lives, approximately 40,000 per million of the
  population; Hungary, in the same period, lost 1,500,000 (about 70,000 per
  million), the United Kingdom 500,000 (or about 10,000 per million). Add to
  this loss of lives the under-nutrition of the millions that were born and
  their impoverished upbringing. These things strike at the victors as well as
  at the vanquished. They are entirely indiscriminate as among good types and
  bad, while on the whole the battlefield destroys rather the good than the
  'unfit for service,' who remain at home to breed.</p>

  <p>The whole process which, on a vaster scale, has brought Europe to its
  present plight may be seen in miniature among the tribes of the Indian
  frontier. Go up the Khyber Pass and stand on the ridge above Ali Masjid. In
  front lies a desolate valley, flanked by barren mountains under a blistering
  sun. On the slopes to right and left, at intervals of about a thousand yards,
  are oblong inclosures each with brown walls and a little loop-holed tower at
  one corner. These inclosures are the villages of the Pathan tribes which
  inhabit the valley, and in the towers are men with rifles, waiting their
  chance to shoot man or boy who may rashly expose himself outside a
  neighboring village. For all or nearly all of them are at feud with each
  other, and though the causes of their warfare are forgotten, it is a point of
  honor and pride with them never to become reconciled. There have been,
  roughly, three stages in the history of these feuds. In the first, men fought
  with knives, daggers, and other primitive weapons, and the result may have
  been, as a German would argue, 'biologically good.' The fittest survived, the
  population was kept from increasing beyond the number which an inhospitable
  soil would support, the arts of peace, such as they were, could be pursued
  without serious interruption.</p>

  <p>The second stage was reached when the flint-lock rifle came on the scene
  and took the place of knife and dagger. With this the vendetta necessarily
  became more of a national industry; but the weapon was short of range and
  irregular in its killing power, and there was still a fair chance of
  survival, and a certain presumption that the better or more skillful man
  would escape. But before the end of the nineteenth century the village
  marksmen had possessed themselves of the Martini-Henry and other long range,
  high-velocity rifles, brought from Europe by the gunrunners of the Persian
  Gulf. At this, the third stage, the biological merits of village warfare
  manifestly began to disappear. The village marksman in his mud-tower now
  makes the whole valley his zone of fire. Cultivation becomes impossible in
  the no-man's land between village and village: only behind the cover of the
  village wall can men sow or plough or reap, tether their cattle, or graze
  their sheep. Every village must be provided with a communication-trench, so
  that its inhabitants may pass under cover to the sanctuary &mdash; guaranteed
  twice in the week &mdash; of the government-protected road which runs down
  the centre of the valley. The question now is, not whether the vendetta is
  biologically good, but whether the tribes can at all survive under it; and
  weary officials, at a loss to solve the vexed problem which they offer to the
  government of India, have been heard to suggest that if a few machine guns
  could be conveyed to the village marksmen and installed in the mudtowers,
  there would soon be no frontier problem at all.</p>

  <p>The question which the cilivized world has how to consider is, whether it
  can survive, or its life be more tolerable than that of these tribesmen under
  a vendetta of high explosives.</p>

  <p>So that when the biological critics says, 'Life is conflict,' we reply,
  without traversing his premises, that war has ceased to be conflict and has
  become indiscriminate catastrophe, and that the selective processes that
  enlarge and enrich life can go on far more freely and effectively in a world
  from which this blundering, disastrous, non-selective, and even possibly
  dysgenic form of wastage is banished. But we have to bear in mind that this
  reply puts upon those who are preparing schemes for a League of Nations the
  onus of providing for progress, competition, and liberty under the restraints
  of such a scheme.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>§ III</h3>

  <p class="first">It may be worth while to take up and consider here a group
  of facts that are sometimes appealed to as a justification of war. It is
  alleged that there has been an extraordinarily rapid development of
  mechanical, chemical, and medical science since 1914, and a vast and valuable
  accumulation of experience in social and industrial organization. There has
  been great mental stimulation everywhere; people have been forced out of
  grooves and idle and dull ways of living into energetic exertion; there has
  been, in particular, a great release and invigoration of feminine spirit and
  effort. The barriers set up by the monopolization of land and material by
  private owners for selfish ends have been broken down in many cases.</p>

  <p>There can be no denying the substantial truth in these allegations.
  Indisputably there has been such a release and stimulation. But this is a
  question of proportion between benefits and losses. And all this stir, we
  argue, has been bought at too great a cost. It is like accelerating the speed
  of a ship by burning its cargo and timbers as fuel. At best, it is the
  feverish and wasteful reaping of a long accumulated harvest.</p>

  <p>We must remember that a process may be evil as a whole, while in part it
  is beneficial. It would be stupid to deny that for countless minds the Great
  War has provided an enlightening excitcment that could have been provided in
  no other way. To deny that, would be to assert the absolute aimlessness and
  incoherence of being. But while this harvest of beneficial by-products of the
  war is undeniable, there is no evidence of any fresh sowing, or, if the
  process of belligerence and warlike preparation is to continue, of any
  possibility of an adequate fresh sowing of further achievements. The root
  from which all the shining triumphs of technical and social science spring,
  we must remember, is the quiet and steadfast pursuit of pure science and
  philosophy and literature by those best endowed for these employments. And if
  the greedy expansion of the war-process is to continue, &mdash; and we have
  shown that without an organized world-peace it must continue, &mdash; there
  is nothing to reassure us of the cotinuance of that supply of free and
  vigorous educated intelligence, in which alone that root can flourish. On the
  contrary, it is one of the most obvious and most alarming aspects of the
  war-process that university education has practically ceased in Europe;
  Europe is now producing only schoolboys, and the very schools are
  understaffed and depleted. The laboratories of the English public schools are
  no longer making the scientific men of the future, they are making munitions.
  It is all very well for the scientific man of fifty to say that at last he
  has got his opportunity; but that is only a momentary triumph for science.
  Where now is the great scientific man for the year 1930? Smashed to pieces in
  an aeroplane, acting as a stretcher-bearer, or digging a trench. And what,
  unless we can secure the peace of the world, will become of the potential
  scientific men of 1950? Suppose it to be possible to carry on this a present
  top-heavy militarist system for so long a period as that, what will have
  happened then to our potential Faradays, Newtons, and Darwins? They will be,
  at best, half educated; they will be highly trained soldiers, robbed of their
  intellectual inheritance and incapable of rendering their gifts to the world.
  The progress of knowledge will be slowing down toward stagnation.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>§ IV</h3>

  <p class="first">A considerable amount of opposition to the League of Nations
  movement may be classified under the heading of Objections from precedent and
  prepossession. The mind is already occupied by the idea of attachment to some
  political sytem which stands in the way of a world-league. These objections
  vary very much in intellectual quality. Nevertheless, even the most
  unintelligent demand some attention, because numerically these antatgonists
  form considerable masses. Collectively, in their unorganized way, they
  produce a general discouragement and hostility far more formidable than any
  soundly reasoned case against an organized world-peace.</p>

  <p>The objection from prepossession is necessarily protean; it takes various
  forms because men's prepossessions are various: but 'There never has been a
  League of Nations, and there never will be,' may be regarded as the
  underlying idea of most of these forms. And the objector relapses upon his
  pre-possession as the only possible thing. A few years ago people were saying
  'Men have never succeeded in flying, and they never will.' And we are told,
  particularly by people who have obviously never given human nature ten
  minutes thought in their lives, that world-unity is 'against human nature.'
  To substantiate these sweeping negatives, the objector will adduce a
  heterogeneous collection of instances to show the confusions and
  contradictions of the human will, and a thousand cases of successful
  mass-cooperations will be ignored: we are moved to doubt at last whether
  human beings did ever suppress piracy, develop a railway system, or teach a
  whole population to read and write. If the individual objector is carefully
  examined, it will be found at times that he is under the sway of some narrow
  and intense mental inhibition, based on personal habits or experiences. Some
  of these inhibitions, if they are traced to their source, will be found to be
  even absurdly narrow. The objector dislikes the idea of a World-League of
  Nations because it is 'international,' or, worse, 'cosmopolitan,' and he has
  got into the habit of associating these words with shady finance or anarchist
  outrages or the white-slave traffic. Or he has had uncomfortable experiences
  in hotels abroad, or he has suffered in his business from foreign
  competition. Many of the objections that phrase themselves in some such
  formulas as 'People will never stand it,' or 'You do not understand the
  intensity of feeling,' are indeed rather cases for Jung and Freud than for
  serious dialectics. But from such levels of unreasoned hostility we can
  ascend to much more reasoned and acceptable forms of prepossessions which
  must be met with a greater respect.</p>

  <p>Most human beings are 'patriotic.' They have a pride, quite passionate in
  quality, in the race or nation to which they belong: an affection identical
  in nature with, and sometimes as intense as, that which they feel for family
  and home, for a certain atmosphere of thought and behavior, for a certain
  familiar landscape and atmosphere, for certain qualities none the less real
  because they are often exquisitely indefinable. And they are jealous for this
  'national' quality of theirs &mdash; at times almost as men are jealous for
  their wives. Now, how far does this group of feelings stand in the way of a
  League of Nations project? A number of vigorous speakers and writers do
  certainly play upon this jealousy. They point out that the League of Nations
  project, as it develops, involves controls, not merely of military, but of
  economic concerns &mdash; controls by councils or committees upon which every
  country will see a majority of 'foreigners,' and they exaggerate and
  intensify to the utmost the suggestion of unlimited interference on the part
  of these same 'foreigners,' with the most intimate and sacred things.</p>

  <p>One eloquent writer, for example (Mr. Belloc), declares that the League of
  Nations would place us all 'at the mercy of a world-police'; and another (Mr.
  I. D. Colvin) declares that the council of a League of Nations would own all
  our property as the British now 'own' the empire; an unfortunate parallel, if
  we consider the amount of ownership exercised by the British Government over
  the life and affairs of a New Zealander or a Hindu.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most effective answer to this sort of thing is to be found in
  current instances. One might imagine from these critics that at present every
  government in the world was a national government; but in spite of such
  instances as Sweden and France, national governments are the exception rather
  than the rule. There are very few nationalities in the world now which are
  embodied in a sovereign government. There is no sovereign state of England,
  for example. The English, the Scotch, and the Welsh, all strongly marked and
  contrasted nationalities, live in an atmosphere of mutual criticism and
  cordial cooperation. (Consider again the numerous nations in the British
  Empire, which act in unison through the Imperial Government, imperfect and
  unrepresentative as it is; consider the dissolving nationalities in the
  American melting-pot; consider the Prussians and Saxons in the German Empire.
  What is there in common between an Australian native, a London freethinker, a
  Bengali villager, a Uganda gentleman, a Rand negro, an Egyptian merchant, and
  a Singapore Chinaman, that they should all be capable of living as they do
  under one rule and one peace, and with a common collective policy, and yet be
  incapable of a slightly larger cooperation with a Frenchman, a New Englander,
  or a Russian? The Welshman is perhaps the best instance of all, to show how
  completely participation in a great political synthesis is compatible with
  intense national peculiarity and self-respect.</p>

  <p>But if one looks closely into the objections of these 'anti-foreign'
  alarmists, it will usually become clear that the real prejudice is not a
  genuine patriotism at all: the objection is not to interference with the
  realities of national life, but to interference with national aggression and
  competition, which is quite a different thing. The 'British' ultra-patriot,
  who begins by warning us against the impossibilitv of having 'foreigners'
  interfering in our national life, is presently warning us against the
  interference of 'foreigners' with 'our ' empire or 'our' predominant
  over-seas trade.</p>

  <p>It is curious to see in how many instances certain conventional ideas
  never properly analyzed, dominate the minds of the critics of the League of
  Nations project. Many publicists, it becomes evident, think of international
  relations in terms of 'Powers,' mysterious entities of a value entirely
  romantic and diplomatic. International politics are for them only thinkable
  as a competition of those powers; they see the lives of states as primarily
  systems of conflict. A 'power' to them means the sort of thing which was
  brought to perfection in Europe in the eighteenth century, in the courts of
  Versailles, Potsdam, St. Petersburg, and at St. James's, and it means nothing
  else in the world to them. It is, in fact, a conspiracy against other and
  competing powers, centering round an aggressive Foreign Office and availing
  itself of nationalist prejudice rather than of national self-respect.
  Patriotism is, indeed, not something that the power represents: it is
  something upon which the power trades. To this power idea the political life
  of the last two centuries has schooled many otherwise highly intelligent men
  and by it their minds are now invincibly circumscribed and fixed. They can
  disregard the fact that the great majority of men in the world live out of
  relation to any such government with astonishing ease. The United States,
  Canada, China, India, Australia, South America, for example, show us masses
  of mankind whose affairs are not incorporated in any 'power,' as the word is
  understood in diplomatic jargon; and quite recently the people of Russia have
  violently broken away from such an idea of the state, and show small
  disposition to revert to it. These objectors are in fact thinking still in
  terms of the seventeenth and eighteenth century in Europe &mdash; a very
  special phase in history. But the fixity of their minds upon this old and
  almost entirely European idea of international politics as an affair of
  competitive foreign offices has its value for those who are convinced of the
  need of a new order of human relationships, because it opens up so clearly
  the incompatibility with the pressing needs of the present time of the
  European conceptions of a foreign office and of diplomacy as a secretive
  chaffering for advantages.</p>

  <p>Upon this point we cannot be too clear: it is not nationality that is
  threatened by the League of Nations, it is this 'power' obsession, which used
  national feeling in an entirely Machiavellian spirit. And this power idea
  carries with it much more mischief than the threat of sudden war and the
  attendant necessities of armament. It is about the nuclei of these European
  power systems that the current conceptions of economic warfare and
  territorial exploitation have grown. It is to them that we owe the conception
  of peace as a phase of military preparation during which there is a
  systematic attempt to put rivals at an economic disadvantage. And it will be
  clear that an abandonment of the idea of the world as a conflict of powers
  involves not merely the abandonment of ideas essentially militarist, but also
  the abandonment of the idea of the world as a conflict of economic
  systems.</p>

  <p>So, as we penetrate these common prepossessions of an age which is now
  drawing to a close, the positive as compared with the negative side of the
  League of Nations proposal opens out. Behind the primarily negative project
  of 'no war upon earth,' appears as a necessary corollary a new economic phase
  in history, in which there will be a collective regard for the common weal of
  mankind. The examination and elaboration of the possibilities of economic
  world-control, already immensely foreshadowed by the gigantic poolings that
  have been forced upon the powers allied against Germany, is one of the most
  rapidly expanding chapters in the study of the League of Nations project.</p>

  <h3>§ V</h3>

  <p class="first">Another considerable body of criticism hostile to the League
  of Nations proposal is grouped about certain moral facts. Before concluding
  these introductory remarks, it is advisable to discuss this, not merely in
  order to answer so much of it as amounts to an argument against the
  world-league project, but also because it opens out before us the real scope
  of the League of Nations proposal. There seems to be a disposition in certain
  quarters to underestimate the scale upon which a League of Nations project
  can be planned. It is dealt with as if it were a little legal scheme detached
  from the main body of human life. It seems to be assumed that some little
  group of 'jurists,' sitting together in a permanent conference at The Hague
  or in New York, will be able to divert the whole process of humanity into new
  channels, to overcome the massive, multitudinous, and tremendous forces that
  make for armed conflict and warfare among men, and to inaugurate a new era of
  peace throughout the world.</p>

  <p>The change we contemplate here is not to be so easily achieved. It is a
  project of world-politics, and there is no modest way of treating such a
  project. It would be better left alone than treated timidly. It is a change
  in which nations and political and educational svstems are the counters, and
  about which we must think, if we are to think effectively, in terms of the
  wealth of nations and millions of men. It is a proposal to change the life
  and mentality of everyone on earth.</p>

  <p>Now the thought of those who direct their attention to the moral
  probabilities of a world-peace turns largely upon the idea of loyalty. They
  apprehend man as a creature of intense essential egotism, who has to be
  taught and trained very painfully and laboriously to unselfishness, and the
  substitution of great and noble ends for base and narrow ones. They argue
  that he was in his origins a not very social creature who has been forced by
  his own inventions into a larger circle of intercourse. He had learned his
  first unselfishness from his mother in the family group; he had been tamed
  into devotion by the tribe and his tribal religion; the greater dangers of a
  solitary life had enforced these subjugations upon him. But he still relapses
  very readily into base self-seeking. His loyalty to his nation may easily
  become a mere extension of his personal vanity; his religious faith a cloak
  for hatred of and base behavior toward unbelievers. In times of peace and
  security, the great forms in which he lives do so tend to degenerate. And the
  great justification of war from this point of view is that it creates a phase
  of national life in which a certain community of sacrifice to a common end, a
  certain common faithfullless and helpfulness, is exacted as a matter of
  course from every citizen. Men are called upon to die, and all are called
  upon to give help and suffer privations. War gives reality to loyalty. It is
  the fire that makes fine the clay of solidarity Thc war-phase has been
  hitherto a binding and confirming phase in the life of communities, while
  peace has been a releasing and relaxing phase. And if we are to contemplate a
  state of the world in which there is to be no warfare, we must be prepared
  also, these critics argue, for a process of moral disintegration.</p>

  <p>The late Professor William James found enough validity in this line of
  thought to discuss it very seriously. In his essay on 'The Moral Equivalent
  of War' he deals very illuminatingly with this question. He agrees that to
  relieve the consciousness of ordinary men from the probability of war without
  substituting any other incentive to devotion, may be a very grave social
  loss. His own suggestion for giving every citizen a sense of obligation and
  ownership in the commonwealth for weaving the ideas of loyalty and service,
  that is, into every life, is to substitute the collective war of mankind
  against ignorance, confusion, and natural hardships, for the war between man
  and man; to teach this, not only theoretically, but by the very practical
  expedient of insisting upon a period of compulsory state service for every
  citizen, male or female. He proposes to solve at the same time this moral
  problem and an equally grave social problem by making the unskilled or
  semi-skilled part of the labor in the (nationalized) mines, in the
  (nationalized) fisheries, in hospitals, in many types of factory, and so
  forth a public service. Personal freedom, he insists, has invariably been
  bought, and must always be bought by responsible participation in the toils
  and cares of that system of law and service which constitutes the framework
  of human liberty. See "The Idea of a League of Nations, Part I"</p>

  <p>It would be idle to deny the substantial truth in this type of criticism
  of peace. To recognize it is to sweep out of one's mind all dreams of a
  world-peace contrived by a few jurists and influential people in some odd
  corner of the world's administrative bureaus. Permanent world-peace must
  necessarily be a great process and state of affairs, greater, indeed, than
  any warprocess, because it must anticipate, comprehend, and prevent any
  warprocess, and demand the understanding, the willing and conscious
  participation of the great majority of human beings. We, who look to it as a
  possible thing, are bound not to blind ourselves to, or conceal from others,
  the gigantic and laborious system of labors, the immense tangle of
  cooperations, which its establishment involves. If political institutions or
  social methods stand in the way of this great good for mankind it is fatuous
  to dream of compromises with them. A world peace organization cannot evade
  universal relationships.</p>

  <p>It is clear that, if a world-league is to be living and enduring, the idea
  of it and the need and righteousness of its service must be taught by every
  educational system in the world. It must either be served by, or be in
  conflict with, every religious organization; it must come into the life of
  everyone, not to release men and women from loyalty, but to demand it for
  itself.</p>

  <p>The answer to this criticism that the world-peace will release men from
  service, is therefore, that the world-peace is itself a service. It calls,
  not as war does, for the deaths, but for that greater gift, the lives, of
  men. The League of Nations cannot be a little thing; it is either to be a
  great thing in the world, an overriding idea of a greater state, or nothing.
  Every state aims ultimately at the production of a sort of man, and it is an
  idle and a wasteful diplomacy, a pandering to timidities and shams, to
  pretend that the World-League of Nations is not ultimately a state aiming at
  that ennobled individual whose city is the world.</p>
