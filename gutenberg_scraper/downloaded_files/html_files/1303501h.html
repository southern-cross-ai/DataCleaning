  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="intro">Written at the height of WW2, <i>Crux Ansata</i> (Latin:
  "The Cross with a handle") is an uncomprimising attack on Roman Catholicism
  and Pope Pius XII. Indeed some will contend that Wells goes too far, but this
  book, it must be remembered was part of the war effort. When it was written,
  Wells had recently retired from the position of Minister of Allied
  Propaganda, but that official retirement did not stop him continuing that
  effort.</p>

  <p class="intro">During those grim days of bombing and terror, many wealthy
  people fled London to the safety of country estates. But H.G. Wells refused
  to leave London. He knew that shared suffering between the economic classes
  was key to the war effort. He would not leave knowing that the poor had no
  choice but to stay and he meant to shame his wealthy fellow-Londoners by his
  resolve. His front door was blown in several times by German bombs, and even
  though he was in his late 70's and ill health, he joined in the regular
  patrols of the war-time streets for fires. It was under this sort of duress
  that he wrote <i>Crux Ansata</i>.</p>

  <p class="intro">In Crux, Wells uses his pulpit of public teacher to add fuel
  to the fire of British morale. He praises the independant spirit of the
  Englishman and denounces the "spreading octopus" of the Church and its
  "Shinto alliance." However, the bulk of this book remains a very readable
  history of Christianity, not unlike the style of his famous Outline of
  History, though it suffers slightly from a forced quality, almost as if he
  were tired of reciting. It has occasional long quotes by other authors, but
  as was necessitated by the difficulties of war time, it is a short book;
  terse and to the point. There are times though when Crux Ansata dwindles into
  vagueness, and one gets a brief passing feeling that H.G.'s mental sharpness
  was begining to errode. Despite this, however, Crux has its share of powerful
  quotes that, in part, save it from being merely a piece of wartime
  propoganda.</p>

  <p class="intro">"Christianity early ceased to be purely prophetic and
  creative. It entangled itself with archaic traditions of human sacrifice,
  with Mithraic blood-cleansing, with priestcraft as ancient as human society,
  and with elaborate doctrines about the structure of the divinity. The gory
  entrail-searching forefinger of the Etruscan <i>pontifex maximus</i>
  presently overshadowed the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth..." (<i>Crux
  Ansata</i>, page 12).</p>

  <p class="intro">"Even in comparison with Fascism and the Nazi adventure,
  Roman Catholicism is a broken and utterly desperate thing, capable only of
  malignant mischief in our awakening world" (<i>ibid</i>, page 79).</p>

  <p class="intro">"Watch a priest in a public conveyance. He is fighting
  against disturbing suggestions. He must not look at women lest he think of
  sex. He must not look about him, for reality, that is to say the devil, waits
  to seduce him on every hand. You see him muttering his protective
  incantations, avoiding your eye. He is suppressing "sinful" thoughts"
  (<i>ibid</i>, page 113).</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I. &mdash; WHY DO WE NOT BOMB ROME?</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I cut the following paragraph from <i>The Times</i> of
  October 27th, 1942.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"The air raids on Italy have created the greatest
  satisfaction in Malta, which has suffered so much at Axis hands. At least the
  Italians now realise what being bombed means and the nature of the suffering
  they have so callously inflicted on little Malta since June 12th, 1940, when
  they showered their first bombs on what was then an almost defenceless
  island.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"As that bombing was intensified, especially since the
  Italians asked Germany's help in their vain attempt to reduce Malta, the
  people's reaction became violent and expressed itself in two words 'Bomb
  Rome', which were written prominently on walls in every locality."</p>

  <p>On June 1st, 1942, the enemy bombed Canterbury and as near as possible got
  the Archbishop of Canterbury. But what is a mere Protestant Archbishop
  against His Holiness the Pope?</p>

  <p>In March 1943 Rome was still unbombed.</p>

  <p>Now consider the following facts.</p>

  <p>We are at war with the Kingdom of Italy, which made a particularly cruel
  and stupid attack upon our allies Greece and France; which is the homeland of
  Fascism; and whose "Duce" Mussolini begged particularly for the privilege of
  assisting in the bombing of London.</p>

  <p>There are also Italian troops fighting against our allies the Russians. A
  thorough bombing (a la Berlin) of the Italian capital seems not simply
  desirable, but necessary. At present a common persuasion that Rome will be
  let off lightly by our bombers is leading to a great congestion of the worst
  elements. of the Fascist order in and around Rome.</p>

  <p>Not only is Rome the source and centre of Fascism, but it has been
  the,seat of a Pope, who, as we shall show, has been an open ally of the Nazi-
  Fascist-Shinto Axis since his enthronement. He has never raised his voice
  against that Axis, he has never denounced the abominable aggressions, murder
  and cruelties they have inflicted upon mankind, and the pleas he is now
  making for peace and forgiveness are manifestly designed to assist the escape
  of these criminals, so that they may presently launch a fresh assault upon
  all that is decent in humanity. The Papacy is admittedly in communication
  with the Japanese, and maintains in the Vatican an active Japanese
  observation post.</p>

  <p>No other capital has been spared the brunt of this war.</p>

  <p>Why do we not bomb. Rome? Why do we allow these open and declared
  antagonists of democratic freedom to entertain their Shinto allies and
  organise a pseudo-Catholic destruction of democratic freedom? Why do
  we&mdash;after all the surprises and treacheries of this war&mdash;allow this
  open preparation of an internal attack upon the rehabilitation of Europe? The
  answer lies in the deliberate blindness of our Foreign Office and opens up a
  very serious indictment of the mischievous social disintegration inherent in
  contemporary Roman Catholic activities.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">II. &mdash; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE IDEA OF CHRISTENDOM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LET us tell as compactly as possible certain salient phases
  in the history of the Christian organisation that led up to the breach
  between the various form of Protestantism and Rome. Like all human
  organisations that have played a part through many generations, the career of
  the Catholic Church has passed through great fluctuations. It had phases of
  vigorous belief in itself and wise leadership; it fell into evil ways and
  seemed no better than a dying carcass; it revived, it split. There is no need
  for us to explore the early development and variations of Christianity before
  it assumed its definite form under the patronage and very definite urgency of
  the Emperor Constantine. The recriminations of the early Fathers, their
  strange ideas and stranger practices need not concern us here. There were
  churches, but there was no single unified Church.</p>

  <p>Catholicism as we know it as a definite and formulated belief came into
  existence with the formulation of the Nicene Creed. Eusebius gives a curious
  account of that strange assemblage at Nicaea, over which the Emperor,
  although he was not yet a baptised Christian, presided. It was not his first
  council of the Church, for he had already (in 314) presided over.a council at
  Arles. He sat in the middle of the Council of Nicaea upon a golden throne,
  and, as he had little Greek, we must suppose he was reduced to watching the
  countenances and gestures of the debaters, and listening to their
  intonations.</p>

  <p>The council was a stormy one. When old Arius rose to speak, one, Nicholas
  of Myra, struck him in the face, and afterwards many ran out, thrusting their
  fingers into their ears in affected horror at the old man's heresies. One is
  tempted to imagine the great emperor, deeply anxious for the solidarity of
  his empire, firmly resolved to end these divisions, bending towards his
  interpreters to ask them the meaning of the uproar.</p>

  <p>The views that prevailed at Nicaea are embodied in the Nicene Creed, a
  strictly Trinitarian statement, and the Emperor sustained the Trinitarian
  position. But afterwards, when Athanasius bore too hardly upon the Arians, he
  had him banished from Alexandria; and when the Church at Alexandria would
  have excommunicated Arius, he obliged it to readmit him to communion.</p>

  <p>A very important thing for us to note is the role played by this emperor
  in the unification and fixation of Christendom. Not only was the Council of
  Nicaea assembled by Constantine the Great, but all the great councils, the
  two at Constantinople (381 and 553), Ephesus (431), and Chalcedon (451), were
  called together by the imperial power. And it is very manifest that in much
  of the history of Christianity at this time the spirit of Constantine the
  Great is as evident as, or more evident than, the spirit of Jesus.</p>

  <p>Constantine was a pure autocrat. Autocracy had ousted the last traces of
  constitutional government in the days of Aurelian and Diocletian. To the best
  of his lights the Emperor was trying to reconstruct the tottering empire
  while there was yet time, and he worked, according to those lights, without
  any councillors, any public opinion, or any sense of the need of such aids
  and checks.</p>

  <p>The idea of stamping out all controversy and division, stamping out all
  independent thought, by imposing one dogmatic creed upon all believers, is an
  altogether autocratic idea, it is the idea of the single-handed man who feels
  that to get anything done at all he must be free from opposition and
  criticism. The story of the Church after he had consolidated it becomes,
  therefore, a history of the violent struggles that were bound to follow upon
  his sudden and rough summons to unanimity. From him the Church acquired that
  disposition to be authoritative and unquestioned, to develop a centralised
  organisation and run parallel with the Roman Empire which still haunts its
  mentality.</p>

  <p>A second great autocrat who presently emphasised the distinctly
  authoritarian character of Catholic Christianity was Theodosius I, Theodosius
  the Great (379-395). He handed all the churches to the Trinitarians, forbade
  the unorthodox to hold meetings, and overthrew the heathen temples throughout
  the empire, and in 390 he caused the great statue of Serapis at Alexandria to
  be destroyed. Henceforth there was to be no rivalry, no qualification to the
  rigid unity of the Church.</p>

  <p>Here we need tell only in the broadest outline of the vast internal
  troubles the Church, its indigestions of heresy; of Arians and Paulicians, of
  Gnostics and Manichaeans.</p>

  <p>The denunciation of heresy came before the creeds in the formative phase
  of Christianity. The Christian congregations hadinterests in common in those
  days; they had a sort of freemasonry of common interests; their general
  theology was Pauline, but they evidently discussed their fundamental
  doctrines and documents widely and sometimes acrimoniously. Christian
  teaching almost from the outset was a matter for vehement disputation. The
  very Gospels are rife with unsettled arguments; the Epistles are
  disputations, and the search for truth intensified divergence. The violence
  and intolerance of the Nicene Council witnesses to the doctrinal stresses
  that had already accumulated in the earlier years, and to the perplexity
  confronting the statesmen who wished to pin these warring theologians down to
  some dominating statement in the face of this theological Babel.</p>

  <p>It is impossible for an intelligent modern student of history not to
  sympathise with the underlying idea of the papal court, with the idea of one
  universal rule of righteousness keeping the peace of the earth, and not to
  recognise the many elements of nobility that entered into the Lateran policy.
  Sooner or later mankind must come to one universal peace, unless our race is
  to be destroyed by the increasing power of its own destructive inventions;
  and that universal peace must needs take the form of a government, that is to
  say, a law-sustaining organisation, in the best sense of the word
  religious&mdash;a government ruling men through the educated co-ordination of
  their minds in a common conception of human history and human destiny.</p>

  <p>The Catholic Church was the first clearly conscious attempt to provide
  such a government in the wor1d. We cannot too earnestly. examine its
  deficiencies and inadequacies, for every lesson we can draw from them is
  necessarily of the greatest value in forming our ideas of our own
  international relationships.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">III. &mdash; THE ESSENTIAL WEAKNESS OF CHRISTENDOM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AND first among the things that confront the student is the
  intermittence of the efforts of the Church to establish the world-City of
  God. The policy of the Church was not whole-heartedly and continuously set
  upon that end. Only now and then some fine personality or some group of fine
  personalities dominated it in that direction. "The fatherhood of God" that
  Jesus of Nazareth preached was overlaid almost from the beginning by the
  doctrines and ceremonial traditions of an earlier age, and of an
  intellectually inferior type. Christianity early ceased to be purely
  prophetic and creative. It entangled itself with archaic traditions of human
  sacrifice, with Mithraic blood-cleansing, with priestcraft as ancient as
  human society, and with elaborate doctrines about the structure of the
  divinity. The gory entrail-searching forefinger of the Etruscan pontifex
  maximus presently overshadowed the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth; the mental
  complexity of the Alexandrian Greek entangled them. In the jangle of these
  incompatibles the Church, trying desperately to get on with its unifying
  task, became dogmatic and resorted to arbitrary authority.</p>

  <p>Its priests and bishops were more and more men moulded to creeds and
  dogmas and set procedures; by the time they became popes they were usually
  oldish men, habituated to a politic struggle for immediate ends and no longer
  capable of worldwide views. They had forgotten about the Fatherhood of God;
  they wanted to see the power of the Church, which was their own power,
  dominating men's lives. It 'was just because many of them probably doubted
  secretly of the entire soundness of their vast and elaborate doctrinal fabric
  that they would brook no discussion of it. They were intolerant of doubts and
  questions, not because they were sure of their faith, but because they were
  not. The unsatisfied hunger of intelligent men for essential truth seemed to
  promise nothing but perpetual divergence.</p>

  <p>As the solidarity and dogmatism of the Church hardened, it sloughed off
  and persecuted heretical bodies and individuals with increasing energy. The
  credulous, naive and worthy Abbot Guibert of Nogent-sous-Coucy, in his
  priceless autobiography, gives us the state of affairs in the eleventh
  century, and reveals how varied and abundant were both the internal and
  external revolts against the hardening authoritarianism that Hildebrand had
  implemented.</p>

  <p>Abbot Guibert himself is an incipient internal rebel with criticisms of
  episcopal and papal corruption that already anticipate the Lollards and
  Luther, and the stories he tells of devils diabolical possession and infidel
  death-beds, witness to the wide prevalence of scoffing in Christendom even at
  that early time.</p>

  <p>Yet Abbot Guibert, albeit a potential Protestant, was as completely tied
  to the Catholic Church as we are all tied by gravitation to the earth. There
  was as yet no means of breaking away. The formulae of separation had still to
  be discovered. Scoffers might scoff, but they came to heel on the death-bed.
  Four long centuries of mental travail had to intervene before these ties were
  broken.</p>

  <p>But by the thirteenth century the Church had become morbidly anxious about
  the gnawing doubts that might presently lay the whole structure of its
  pretensions in ruins. It was hunting everywhere for heretics, as timid old
  ladies are said to look under beds and in cupboards. before retiring for the
  night.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">IV. &mdash; HERESIES ARE EXPERIMENTS IN<br>
  MAN'S UNSATISFIED SEARCH FOR TRUTH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LET us examine some of the broad problems that were
  producing heresies. Chief of the heretical stems was the Manichaean way of
  thinking about the conflicts of life.</p>

  <p>The Persian teacher Mani was crucified and flayed in the year 277. His way
  of representing the struggle between good and evil</p>

  <p>was as a struggle between a power of light and a power of darkness
  inherent in the universe. All these profound mysteries are necessarily
  represented by symbols and poetic expressions, and the ideas of Mani still
  find a response in many intellectual temperaments to-day. One may hear
  Manichaean doctrines from many Christian pulpits. But the orthodox Catholic
  symbol was a different one.</p>

  <p>Manichaean ideas spread very widely in Europe, and particularly in
  Bulgaria and the south of France. In the south of France the people who held
  them were called the Cathars. They arose in Eastern Europe in the ninth
  century among the Bulgarians and spread westward. The Bulgarians had recently
  become Christian and were affected by dualistic eastern thought. They
  insisted upon an excessive sexlessness. They would eat no food that was sex-
  begotten&mdash;eggs, cheese even, were taboo but they ate fish because they
  shared the common belief of the time that fish spawned sexlessly. Their ideas
  jarred so little with the essentials of Christianity, that they believed
  themselves to be devout Christians. As a body they lived lives of
  ostentatious purity in a violent, undisciplined and vicious age. They were
  protected by Pope Gregory VII (Hildebrand), because their views enforced his
  imposition of celibacy upon the clergy (of which we shall tell in Chapter
  VII) in the eleventh century. But later their experiments in the search for
  truth carried them into open conflict with the consolidating Church. They
  resorted to the Bible against the priests. They questioned the doctrinal
  soundness of Rome and the orthodox interpretation of the Bible. They thought
  Jesus was a rebel against the cruelty of the God of the Old Testament, and
  not His harmonious Son, and ultimately they suffered for these divergent
  experiments.</p>

  <p>Closely associated with the Cathars in the history of heresy are the
  Waldenses, the followers of a man called Waldo, who seems to have been
  comparatively orthodox in his theology, and less insistent on the "pure"
  life, but offensive to the solidarity of the Church because he denounced the
  riches and luxury of the higher clergy. Waldo was a rich man who sold all his
  possessions in order to preach and teach in poverty. He attracted devoted
  followers and for a time he was tolerated by the Church. But his followers
  and particularly those in Lombardy, went further. Waldo had translated the
  New Testament, including the Revelation, into Provengal, and presently his
  disciples were denouncing the Roman Church as the Scarlet Woman of the
  Apocalypse. This was enough for the Lateran, and presently we have the
  spectacle of Innocent III, after attempts at argument and persuasion, losing,
  his temper and preaching a Crusade against these troublesome enquirers. The
  story of that crusade is a chapter in history that the Roman Catholic
  historians have done their best to obliterate.</p>

  <p>Every wandering scoundrel at loose ends was enrolled to carry fire and
  sword and rape and every conceivable outrage among the most peaceful subjects
  of the King of France, The accounts of the cruelties and abominations of this
  crusade are far more terrible to read than any account of Christian
  martyrdoms by the pagans, and they have the added horror of being
  indisputably true.</p>

  <p>Yet they did not extirpate the Waldenses. In remote valleys of Savoy a
  remnant survived and lived on, generation after generation, until it was
  incorporated with the general movement of the Refoundation and faced and
  suffered before the reinvigorated "Roman Catholic Church in the full drive of
  the Counter Reformation. Of that we shall tell later.</p>

  <p>The intolerance of the narrowing and concentrating Church was not confined
  to religious matters. The shrewd, pompous irascible, disillusioned and rather
  malignant old men who manifestly constituted the prevailing majority in the
  councils of the Church, resented any knowledge but their own knowledge, and
  distrusted any thought that they did not correct and control. Any mental
  activity but their own struck them as being at least insolent if not
  positively wicked. later on they were to have a great struggle upon the
  question of, the earth's position in space, and whether it moved round the
  sun or not. This was really not the business of the Church at all. She might
  very well have left to reason the things that are reason's, but she seems to
  have been impelled by an inner necessity to estrange the intellectual
  conscience in men.</p>

  <p>Had this intolerance sprung from a real intensity of conviction it would
  have been bad enough, but it was accompanied by an undisguised contempt for
  the mental dignity of the common man that makes it far less acceptable to our
  modern ideas. Quite apart from the troubles in Rome itself there was already
  manifest in the twelfth century a strong feeling that all was not well with
  the spiritual atmosphere. There began movements&mdash;movements that nowadays
  we should call "revivalist" &mdash;within the Church, that implied rather
  than uttered a criticism of the sufficiency of her existing methods and
  organisation. Men sought fresh forms of righteous living outside the
  monasteries and priesthood.</p>

  <p>One outstanding figure is that of St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226). This
  pleasant young gentleman had a sudden conversion in the midst of a life of
  pleasure, and, taking a vow of extreme poverty, gave himself up to an
  imitation of the life of,Christ, and to the service of the sick and wretched,
  and more particularly to the service of the lepers who then abounded in
  Italy.</p>

  <p>He was joined by numbers of disciples, and so the first Friars of the
  Franciscan Order came into existence. An order of women devotees was set up
  beside the original confraternity, and in addition great numbers of men and
  women were brought into less formal association. He preached, unmolested by
  the Moslems be it noted, in Egypt and Palestine, though the Fifth Crusade was
  then in progress. His relations with the Church are still a matter for
  discussion. His work had been sanctioned by Pope Innocent III, but while he
  was in the East there was a reconstitution of his order, intensifying
  discipline and substituting authority for responsive impulse, and as a
  consequence of these changes he resigned its headship. To the end he clung
  passionately to the ideal of poverty, but he was hardly dead before the order
  was holding property through trustees and building a great church and
  monastery to his memory at Assisi. The disciplines of the order that were
  applied after his death to his immediate associates are scarcely to be
  distinguished from a persecution; several of the more conspicuous zealots for
  simplicity were scourged, others were imprisoned, one was killed while
  attempting to escape, and Brother Bernard, the "first disciple", passed a
  year in the woods and hills, hunted like a wild beast.</p>

  <p>This struggle within the Franciscan Orr is interesting, because it
  foreshadowed the great troubles that were coming to Christendom. All through
  the thirteenth century a section of the Franciscans were straining at the
  rule of the Church, and in 1318 four of them were burnt alive at Marseilles
  as incorrigible heretics. There seems to have been little difference between
  the teaching and the spirit of St. Francis and that of Waldo in the twelfth
  century, the founder of the massacred but unconquerable sect of Waldenses.
  Both were passionately, enthusiastic for the spirit of Jesus of Nazareth. But
  while Waldo rebelled against the Church, St. Francis did his best to be a
  good child of the Church, and his comment on the spirit of official
  Christianity was only implicit. But both were instances of an outbreak of
  conscience against authority and the ordinary procedure of the Church. And it
  is plain that in the second instance, as in the first, the Church scented
  rebellion.</p>

  <p>A very different character to St. Francis was the Spaniard St. Dominic
  (1170-1221), who was, above all things, orthodox. For him the Church was not
  orthodox enough. He was a reformer on the Right Wing. He had a passion for
  the argumentative conversion of heretics, and he was commissioned by Pope
  Innocent III to go and preach to the Albigenses. His work went on side by
  side with the fighting and massacres of the crusade. Whom Dominic could not
  convert, Innocent's Crusaders slew. Yet his very activities and the
  recognition and encouragement of his order by the Pope witness to the rising
  tide of discussion and to the persuasion even of the Papacy that force was a
  remedy.</p>

  <p>In several respects the development of the Black Friars or
  Dominicans&mdash;the Franciscans were the Grey Friars&mdash;shows the Roman
  Church at the parting of the ways, committing itself more and more deeply to
  a hopeless conflict with the quickening intelligence and courage of mankind.
  She whose duty it was to teach, chose to compel. The last discourse of St.
  Dominic to the heretics he had sought to convert is preserved to us. It
  betrays the fatal exasperation of a man who has lost his faith in the power
  of truth because his truth has not prevailed.</p>

  <p>"For many years," he said, "I have exhorted you in vain, with gentleness,
  preaching, praying and weeping. But according to th proverb of my.country,
  'Where blessing can accomplish nothing, blows may avail', we shall rouse
  against you princes and prelates, who, alas'! will arm nations and kingdoms
  against this land,... and thus blows will avail where blessings and
  gentleness have been powerless."[1]</p>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">V. &mdash; THE CITY OF GOD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">So the intolerance of the Catholic Church drove steadily
  towards its own disruption. Nevertheless for nearly a thousand years the idea
  of Christendom sustained a conception of human unity more intimate and far
  wider than was ever achieved before.</p>

  <p>As early as the fifth century Christianity had already become greater,
  sturdier and more enduring than any empire had ever been, because it was
  something not merely imposed upon men, but interwoven with their deeper
  instinct for righteousness. It reached out far beyond the utmost limits of
  the empire, into Armenia, Persia, Abyssinia, Ireland, Germany, India and
  Turkestan. It had become something no statesman could ignore.</p>

  <p>This widespread freemasonry, which was particularly strong in the towns
  and seaports of the collapsing Empire, must have had a very strong appeal to
  every political organiser. The Christians were essentially townsmen and
  traders. The countrymen were still pagans (pagani = villagers).</p>

  <p>"Though made up of widely scattered congregations," says the
  <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> in its article on "Church History", "it was
  thought of as one body of Christ, one people of God. This ideal unity found
  expression in many ways. Intercommunication between the various Christian
  communities was very active. Christians upon a journey were always sure of a
  warm welcome from their fellow disciples. Messengers and letters were sent
  freely from one Church to another. Missionaries and evangelists went
  continually from place to place. Documents of various kinds, including
  gospels and apostolic epistles, circulated widely. Thus in various ways the
  feeling of unity found expression,, and the development of widely separated
  parts of Christendom conformed more or less closely to a common type."</p>

  <p>Ideas of worldly rule by this spreading and ramifying Church were indeed
  already prevalent in the fourth century. Christianity was becoming political.
  Saint Augustine, a native of Hippo in North Africa, who wrote between 354 and
  430, gave expression to the political idea of the' Church in his book, The
  City of God. The City of God leads the mind very directly towards the
  possibility of making the world into a theological and organised Kingdom of
  Heaven.. The city, as Augustine puts it, is "a spiritual society of the
  predestined faithful, but the step from that to a political application was
  not a very wide one. The Church was to be the ruler of the world over all
  nations, the divinely-led ruling power over a great league of terrestrial
  states.</p>

  <p>Subsequently these ideas developed into a definite political theory and
  policy. As the barbarian races settled and became Christian, the Pope began
  to claim an overlordship of their Kings. In a few centuries the Pope had
  become in Latin Catholic theory, and to a certain extent in practice, the
  high priest, censor, judge and divine monarch of Christendom; his influence,
  as we have noted, extended far beyond the utmost range of the old empire. For
  more than a thousand years this idea of the unity of Christendom, of
  Christendom as a sort of vast Amphictyony, whose members even in wartime were
  restrained from many extremities by the idea of a common brotherhood and a
  common loyalty to the Church, dominated Europe. The history of Europe from
  the fifth century onward to the fifteenth is very largely the history of the
  failure of this great idea of a divinely ordained and righteous world
  government to realise itself in practice.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">VI. &mdash; THE CHURCH SALVAGES LEARNING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IF the dark disorders of the decline and fall of the Roman
  Empire, the newly organised Catholic Church played an important role in the
  preservation of learning and social ideas. St. Benedict and Cassiodorus in
  particular set themselves to the salvage of books and teaching, and among
  their immediate followers was one of the first great Popes, Gregory the
  Great. In those days the local Christian priest was often too ignorant,to
  understand the Latin phrases he mumbled and muttered at his services.
  Gregory's educational energy corrected that. He restored the priests' Latin.
  So that later the Catholic Church retained its widespread solidarity in spite
  of the most extraordinary happenings in Rome. It would no doubt have
  preferred to keep its Latin language without the Latin classics, but their
  use was unavoidable if the language was to be steadied and sustained.</p>

  <p>St. Benedict was born at Spoleto in Italy, a young man of good family. The
  shadow of the times fell upon him, he conceived a disgust for the evil in
  life, and, like Buddha a thousand years before him, he took to the religious
  life and set no limit to his austerities. Fifty miles from Rome is Subiaco,
  and there at the end of a gorge of the Anio, beneath a jungle growth of weeds
  and bushes, rose a deserted palace built by the Emperor Nero, overlooking an
  artificial lake that had been made in those days of departed prosperity by
  damming back the waters of the river. Here with a hair shirt as his chief
  possession, Benedict took up his quarters in a cave in the high southward-
  looking cliff that overhangs the stream, in so inaccessible a position tat
  his food had to be lowered to him on a cord by a faithful admirer. Three
  years he lived here, and his fame spread as Buddha's did, as a great saint
  and teacher.</p>

  <p>Presently we find him no longer engaged in self-torment, but controlling a
  group of twelve monasteries, the resort of a great number of people. Youths
  are brought to him to be educated, and the whole character of his life has
  ceased to be ascetic.</p>

  <p>From Subiaco he removed to Monte Cassino, half-way between Rome and
  Naples, a. lonely and beautiful mountain in the midst of a great circle of
  majestic heights. Here, it is interesting to note that in the sixth century
  A.D. he found a temple of Apollo and a sacred grove, and the countryside
  still worshipping at this shrine. His first labours had to be missionary
  labours, and with difficulty he persuaded the simple pagans to demolish their
  temple and cut down their grove. The establishment upon Monte Cassino became
  a famous and powerful centre within the lifetime of its founder. Mixed up
  with the imbecile inventions of marvel-loving monks about demons exorcised,
  disciples walking on the water, and dead children restored to life, we can
  still detect something of the real spirit of Benedict. Particularly
  significant are the stories that represent him as discouraging extreme
  mortification. He sent a damping message to a solitary who had invented a new
  degree in saintliness by chaining himself to a rock in a narrow cave. "Break
  thy chain," said Benedict, "for he true servant of God is chained not to
  rocks by iron, but to righteousness by Christ."</p>

  <p>Next to the discouragement of solitary self-torture, Benedict insisted
  upon hard work. Through the legends shine the clear indications of the
  trouble made by his patrician students and disciples who found themselves
  obliged to toil instead of leading lives of leisurely austerity under the
  ministrations of the lowerclass brethren.</p>

  <p>A third remarkable thing about Benedict was his political influence. He
  set himself to reconcile Goths and Italians, and it is clear that Totila, his
  Gothic king, came to him for counsel and was greatly influenced by him. When
  Totila retook Naples from the Greeks, the Goths protected the women from
  insult and treated even the captured soldiers with humanity. Belisarius,
  Justinian's general, had taken the same place ten years previously, and had
  celebrated his triumph by a general massacre.</p>

  <p>Now the monastic organisation of Benedict was a very great beginning in
  the Western world. One of his prominent followers was Pope Gregory the Great
  (540-604), the first monk to become Pope (590); he was one of the most
  capable and energetic of the Popes, sending successful missions to the
  unconverted, and particularly to' the Anglo-Saxons. He rules in Rome like an
  independent king, organising armies, making treaties. To his influence is due
  the imposition of the Benedictine rule upon nearly the whole of Latin
  monasticism.</p>

  <p>Gregory the Great ruled in Rome like an independent king organising
  armies, making treaties. It was he who saw two fair captives from Britain,
  and, having asked whence they came and being told they were Angles, said they
  might be angels&mdash;<i>non Angli sed Angeli</i>&mdash;rather than Angles if
  they had the Faith. He made it his special business to send missionaries to
  England. This is a high water mark in the chequered history of the Roman
  Church. From Gregory I it passes into a phase of decadence not only at Rome
  but throughout its entire sphere of influence.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">VII. &mdash; CHARLEMAGNE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AN interesting amateur in theology who was destined to drive
  a wedge into the solidarity of the Christian system was the Emperor
  Charlemagne, Charles the Great, the friend and ally of King Alfred of Wessex.
  The wedge was unpremeditated. The learned, investing history with the
  undeserved dignity their scholarly minds craved, have endowed Charles with an
  almost inhuman foresight. He was the son of Pepin, who had been Mayor of the
  Palace to the last of the Merovingia Kings, and, on the strength of his being
  <i>de facto</i> King, he appealed to the Pope to transfer the Crown to his
  head. This the Pope did. Everywhere in Europe the ascendant rulers seized
  upon Christianity as a unifying force to cement their conquests. Christianity
  became a banner for aggressive chiefs&mdash;as it did in Uganda in Africa in
  the bloody days before that country was annexed to the British Empire.</p>

  <p>Charlemagne was most simply and enthusiastically Christian, and his
  disposition to sins of the flesh, to a certain domestic laxity&mdash;he is
  accused among other things of incestuous relations with his
  daughters&mdash;merely sharpened his redeeming zeal for the Church. An
  aggressive Church had long since decided that sins of the flesh are venal
  sins when weighed against unorthodoxy, and he was able to offer up vast
  hecatombs of conquered pagans to appease the more and more complaisant
  Catholic Church. He insisted on their becoming Christians, and to refuse
  baptism or to retract after baptism were equally crimes punishable by death.
  After he was crowned Emperor he obliged every male subject over the age of
  twelve to renew his oath of allegiance and undertake to be not simply a good
  subject but a good Christian.</p>

  <p>A new Pope, Leo III, in 795, made Charlemagne Emperor. Hitherto the court
  at Byzantium had possessed a certain Indefinite authority over the Pope.
  Strong emperors like Justinian had bullied the Popes and obliged them to
  visit Constantinople; weak emperors had annoyed them ineffectively. The idea
  of a breach, both secular and religious, with Constantinople had long been
  entertained at the Lateran, and in the Frankish power there seemed to be just
  the support that was necessary if Constantinople was to be defied.</p>

  <p>So upon his accession Leo III sent the keys of the tomb of St. Peter and a
  banner to Charlemagne as the symbols of his sovereignty in Rome as King of
  Italy. Very soon the Pope had to appeal to the protection he had chosen. He
  was unpopular in Rome; he was attacked and ill-treated in the streets during
  a procession, and obliged to fly to Germany (799). Eginhard says his eyes
  were gouged out and his tongue cut off. He seems, however, to have had both
  eyes and tongue again a year later. Charlemagne brought him back to Rome and
  reinstated him (800).</p>

  <p>Then occurred a very important scene. On Christmas Day in the year 800, as
  Charles was rising from prayer in the Church of St. Peter, the Pope, who had
  everything in readiness, clapped a crown upon his head and hailed him Caesar
  and Augustus. There was great popular applause. But Eginhard, the friend and
  biographer of Charlemagne, says that the new Emperor was by no means pleased
  by this coup of Pope Leo's. If he had known this was to happen, he said, "he
  would have not entered the Church, great festival though it was."</p>

  <p>No doubt he had been thinking and talking of making himself Emperor, but
  he had evidently not intended that the Pope should make him Emperor. He had
  had some idea of marrying the Empress Irene, who at that time reigned in
  Constantinople, and so becoming monarch of both Eastern and Western Empires.
  But now he was obliged to accept the title in the manner that Leo had
  adopted, as a gift from the Pope, and in a way that estranged Constantinople
  and secured the separation of Rome from the Byzantine Church.</p>

  <p>At first Byzantium was unwilling to recognise the imperial title of
  Charlemagne. But in 811 a great disaster fell upon the Byzantine Empire. The
  pagan Bulgarians, under their prince Krum, defeated and destroyed the armies
  of the Emperor Nicephorus, whose skull became a drinking cup for Krum. The
  great pat of the Balkan peninsula was conquered by these people. After this
  misfortune Byzantium was in no position to dispute this revival of the empire
  in the West, and in 812 Charlemagne was formally recognised by Byzantine
  envoys as Emperor and Augustus.</p>

  <p>The defunct Western Empire rose again as the "Holy Roman Empire". While
  .its military strength lay north of the Alps, its centre of authority was
  Rome. It was from the beginning a divided thing, a claim and an argument
  rather than a necessary reality. The good German sword was always clattering
  over the Alps into Italy, and missions and legates toiling over in the
  reverse direction. But the Germans never could hold Italy permanently,
  because they could not stand the malaria that the ruined, neglected,
  undrained country fostered. And in Rome, as well as in several other of the
  cities of Italy, there smouldered a more ancient tradition, the tradition of
  the aristocratic republic, hostile to both Emperor and Pope.</p>

  <p>In spite of the fact that we have a.life of him written by his
  contemporary, Eginhard, the character and personality of Charlemagne are
  difficult to visualise. Eginhard was a poor writer; he gives many
  particulars, but not the particulars that make a living figure. Charlemagne,
  he says, was a tall man, with a rather feeble voice; and he had bright eyes
  and a long nose. "The top of his head was round," whatever that may mean, and
  his hair was "white". Possibly that means he was a blond. He had a thick,
  rather short neck, and "his belly too prominent". He wore a tunic with a
  silver border, and gartered hose. He had a blue cloak, and was always girt
  with his sword, hilt and belt being of gold and silver.</p>

  <p>He was a man of great animation and his abundant love affairs did not
  interfere at all with his incessant military and political labours He took
  much exercise was fond of pomp and religious ceremonies, and gave generously.
  He was a man of considerable intellectual enterprise, with a self-confident
  vanity rather after the fashion of William II, the ex-German Emperor, who
  died at Doorn so unimpressively the other day.</p>

  <p>His mental activities are interesting, and they serve as a sample of the
  intellectuality of the time. Probably he could read; at meals he "listened to
  music or reading, but he never acquired the art of writing; "he used," says
  Eginhard, "to keep his writing book and tablets under his pillow, that when
  he had leisure he might practise his hand in forming letters, but he made
  little progress in an art begun too late in life." He certainly displayed a
  hunger for knowledge, and he took pains to attract men of learning to his
  Court.</p>

  <p>These learned men were, of course, clergymen, there being no other learned
  men then in the world and naturally they gave a strongly clerical tinge to
  the information they imparted. At his Court, which was usually at Aix-la-
  Chapelle or Mayence, he whiled away the winter season by a curious
  institution called his "school", in which he and his erudite associates
  affected to lay aside all thoughts of worldly position, assumed names taken
  from the classical writers or from Holy Writ, and discoursed upon learning
  and theology. Charlemagne himself was "David". He developed a considerable
  knowledge of theology, and it is to him that we must ascribe the proposal to
  add the words <i>filioque</i> to the Nicene Creed&mdash;an addition that
  finally split the Latin and Greek Churches asunder. But it is more than
  doubtful whether he had any such separation in mind. He wanted to add a word
  or so to the Creed, just as the Emperor William II wanted to leave his mark
  on the German language and German books, and he took up this <i>filioque</i>
  idea, which was originally a Spanish innovation. Pope Leo discreetly opposed
  it. When it was accepted centuries later, it was probably accepted with the
  deliberate intention of enforcing the widening breach between Latin and
  Byzantine Christendom.</p>

  <p>The filioque point is a subtle one, and a word or so of explanation may
  not seem amiss to those who are uninstructed theologically. Latin Christendom
  believes now that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son; Greek
  and Eastern Christians, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father,
  without any mention of the Son. The latter attitude seems to incline a little
  towards the Arian point of view. The Catholic belief is that the Father and
  the Son have always existed together, world without end; the Greek orthodox
  idea is tainted by a very human disposition to think fathers ought to be at
  least a little senior to their sons. The reader must go to his own religious
  teachers for precise instruction upon this point.</p>

  <p>The disposition of men in positions of supreme educational authority in a
  community, to direct thought into some particular channel by which their
  existence may be made the more memorable, is not uncommon: The Emperor
  William, for instance, helped to make the Germans a people apart, and did
  much for the spectacle-makers of Germany, by using his influence to sustain
  the heavy Teutonic black letter and insisting upon the rejection of alien
  words and roots from the good old German vocabulary. "Telephone" for instance
  was anathema, and "<i>Fernsprecher</i>" was substituted; and wireless became
  "<i>drahtlos</i>". So nationalism in Germany achieved the same end as the
  resistance of English stupidity to orthographic changes, and made the
  language difficult for and repulsive to foreigners.</p>

  <p>The normal speech of Charlemagne was Frankish. He may have understood
  Latin, more particularly if it was used with consideration, but he could have
  had no opportunity of Greek. He made a collection of old German songs and
  tales, but these were destroyed by his son and successor, Louis the Pious,
  because of their paganism.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; BLACK INTERLUDE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR a very long time the hold of the Emperors and the Popes
  upon the City of Rome was a very insecure one. Many of the surviving
  patrician families and also the Roman mob claimed the most conflicting
  privileges in the election and removal of the Popes, the German Emperor
  claimed similar rights, and on the other hand the popes would assert their
  rights to depose and excommunicate emperors. In this confusion popes
  multiplied, even a layman, John XIX, was made pope, and there were
  overlapping popes inconsiderable abundance. In 1045 there were three popes
  struggling in Rome, the notoriously vicious Benedict IX, Sylvester III and
  Gregory VI. Gregory VI bought the Papacy from Benedict, who subsequently went
  back on his bargain.</p>

  <p>Hildebrand became Pope Gregory VII. He succeeded Pope Alexander, who,
  under his inspiration, had been attempting to reform and consolidate the
  Church organisation. He imposed celibacy on the clergy and so cut them off
  from family and social ties. It consolidated the Church but it dehumanised
  the Church. Hildebrand fought a long fight with the Emperor Henry IV. Henry
  deposed him and Gregory deposed and excommunicated the Emperor, who repented
  and did penance at Canossa. Afterwards Henry regretted his humiliation and
  created an Anti-Pope, Clement III. He besieged Gregory who held out in the
  Castle of St. Angelo. Robert Guiscard, a Norman freebooter, whom Pope
  Nicholas n had made "Duke of Apulia and Calabria and future Lord of Sicily by
  the Grace of God and St. Peter", came to the rescue, drove out the Emperor
  and Anti-Pope and incidentally sacked Rome. After which Gregory went off
  under the protection of the Normans and died at Salerno, a hated and unhappy
  man, a good and great-spirited man defeated by the uncontrollable
  complexities of life.</p>

  <p>So the story of schisms and conflicts runs on through the records of the
  Church. Many of the popes fought for power for the vilest ends, but we do
  such men as Gregory VII and Urban II (the Pope of the First Crusade) the
  grossest injustice if we ignore the fact that behind this barbaric struggle
  for power there could be long views and disinterested aims. Conformity to the
  concepts of Christendom or a merely brutal life impulse were the alternative
  guides between which men had to choose in the atmosphere of that period. Men
  "sinned" violently and defiantly and yet were superstitiously
  afraid.Death-beds generally reeked with penitence, abject confessions and
  pious bequests. It is difficult for a modern mind to imagine how much in that
  age of confusion men could believe, and how little dignity, coherence and
  criticism there was in their beliefs.</p>

  <p>How far things could go with the weak, the vicious and the insolent is
  shown by one phase in the history of Rome at this time, an almost
  indescribable phase. The decay of the Empire of Charlemagne had left the Pope
  unsupported, he was threatened by Byzantium and by the Saracens (who had
  taken Sicily), and face to face with the unruly nobles of Rome. Among the
  most powerful of these nobles were two women. Theodora and Marozia, mother
  and daughter,[1] who in succession held that same Castle of St. Angelo, which
  Theophylact, the patrician husband of Theodora, had seized together with most
  of the temporal power of the Pope. These two women were as bold, unscrupulous
  and dissolute as any male prince of the time could have been, and they are
  abused by masculine historians as though they were ten times worse. Marozia
  seized and imprisoned Pope John X (928), who speedily died under her hands.
  Her mother, Theodora, had been his mistress. Marozia subsequently made her
  illegitimate son Pope, under the title of John XI.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[1] Gibbon mentions a second Theodora, the sister of
  Marozia.</p>

  <p>After him her grandson, John XII, filled the chair of St. Peter. Gibbon's
  account of the manners and morals of John XII is suffused with blushes and
  takes refuge at last beneath a veil of Latin footnotes. This Pope, John XII,
  was finally degraded by the German Emperor Otto, scion of a new dynasty that
  had ousted the Carlovingians, who came over the Alps and down into Italy to
  be crowned in 962. Harsh critics of the Church call this phase in its history
  the pornocracy.</p>

  <p>That "pornocracy" sounds much more awful for the Catholic Church than was
  the reality. It has very little controversial weight if our criticism is to
  be just. It was a purely Roman scandal, and the Faithful throughout
  Christendom probably never heard a word about this "pornocratic" phase. They
  went about their simple religious duties as they had been taught. It was not
  an age of easy travel, and practically nobody in the tenth century went to
  Rome or heard what was happening there. That sort of stress was to come
  later.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9a"
     name="ch9a">IXa &mdash; THE LAUNCHING OF THE CRUSADES BY THE
     CHURCH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN this brief history of the complex effort of the human
  mind and will to secure some mastery over its internal and external
  perplexities, the Crusades, and particularly the First Crusade, demand our
  particular attention. The First Crusade displays "Christendom" at its maximum
  effectiveness as a consolidating and justifying idea, and it shows also how
  the essential instability of the Roman leadership and the ideological
  freakishness of Charlemagne combined with the inherent self-seeking and
  confusion in the human .mind at large; to defeat every <i>ostensible
  purpose</i> of this great eastward drive. Every ostensible purpose. But the
  reaction of the mingling of ideas and purposes hat ensued had unforeseen
  consequences in the disintegration of Christendom that was presently to
  ensue.</p>

  <p>The Crusades were the direct work of the Church. It had been consolidating
  itself slowly fro the uncertainties of the earlier Dark Ages. The
  establishment of clerical celibacy in the ninth and tenth centuries was
  isolating it from the social mass, and the retreat from the passionate side
  of life to monasticism dotted the western world with centres of industrious
  husbandry, which availed themselves of the protection of the developing
  feudal organisation and provided retreats from which men of considerably
  riper years emerged as ministers, councillors, educators. Becket was about
  fifty when he was killed, Anselm lived to be seventy-five, Lanfranc's age is
  uncertain, but it was somewhere about eighty. No wonder they carried weight
  in a generally puerile world.</p>

  <p>A man is as old as his arteries, we say nowadays, but the key to a real
  and authoritative old age for these divines of the Dark Ages was probably the
  inherited soundness of their teeth. Those whose teeth decayed ceased to speak
  with dignity and authority. There was no dentistry except extraction..</p>

  <p>"Benefit of clergy", which worked out at last as a convenient mitigation
  of harsh penal laws, arose out of the claim of the consolidating Church to
  take clerics out of the hands of the temporal power and deal with them in its
  own fashion. But the monasteries were only aggressive when they dared; they
  were not immune from local disorders and had to be steered with discretion.
  There was incessant bickering, robbery and warfare, and intermittent local
  famine, and the standard of life rose and fell here and there and from time
  to time.</p>

  <p>In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the civilisation of Western Europe
  probably displayed far less social insecurity and inequality, and far less
  gross brutality, than in the succeeding period. There were regions and phases
  of comparative health and vitality. But such phases meant the accumulation of
  lootable resources, and opened the way to conceptions of conquest upon a
  larger and more lucrative scale. The Norman Conquest of England was a
  considerable achievement for that age. The tradition of the Roman Empire, the
  tradition of great and rich cities to the south-east, still haunted men's
  imaginations and did much to prepare them for the greater adventure of the
  Crusades.</p>

  <p>The older and wiser heads who were consolidating a renascent Latin Church
  in the tenth and eleventh centuries were struggling against the incessant
  bickering warfare of the times. The Church then was something very different
  from Pope Pacelli's Church of to-day. In its reawakened eleventh-century
  form, under the direction of that greatest of papal statesmen, Pope Gregory
  VII (Hildebrand), it was the most civilised and civilising thing in the
  Western world. It was at its best. Not only the Roman Church as we know it,
  but all the Protestant sects, are derived from it. It had tried various
  expedients to put a truce upon local violence, and it seized upon the Turkish
  ill-treatment of pilgrims to the Holy Sepulchre as an incentive. These Turks
  had smashed the Byzantine armies and driven them out of Asia Minor. They sat
  down in Nicaea, opposite Byzantium itself. In this extremity Alexis Comnenus,
  the Byzantine Emperor, appealed to Pope Gregory VII for help, and the
  Latin-speaking West responded promptly and vigorously. Both the Western
  Empire and the Church saw plainly before it the subjugation of the Eastern
  world by the West.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch9b"
     name="ch9b">IXb &mdash; CHRISTENDOM MARCHES EAST</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE incitement to crusade aroused a stupenpdous and varied
  response. It released all the latent unifying forces that had accumulated
  about the idea of Christendom.</p>

  <p>In the beginning of the seventh century we saw Western Europe as a chaos
  of social and political fragments, with no common idea nor hope, a system
  shattered almost to a dust of self-seeking individuals. Now, at the close of
  the eleventh century, we discover a common belief, a linking idea, to which
  men may devote themselves, and by which they can co-operate together in a
  universal enterprise. We realise that, in spite of much weakness and
  intellectual and moral unsoundness, to this extent the Christian Church had
  <i>worked</i>. We are able to measure the evil phases of tenth-century Rome,
  the scandals, the filthiness, the murders and violence, at their proper value
  by the scale of this fact. No doubt, not only in Rome itself, but all over
  Christendom, there had been many lazy, evil and foolish ecclesiastics, but it
  is manifest that in spite of them a task of teaching and co-ordination had
  been accomplished by a great multitude of right-living priests and monks and
  nuns. A new and greater amphictyony, the amphictyony of Christianity, had
  come into the world, and it had been built by thousands of these anonymous
  faithful lives.</p>

  <p>And the response to the appeal of Urban II was not confined only to what
  we should call educated people. It was not simply knights and princes who
  were willing to go crusading. Side by side with the figure of Urban we must
  put that of Peter the Hermit, a type novel to Europe, albeit a little
  reminiscent of the Hebrew prophets. This man appeared preaching the crusade
  to the common people. He told a story&mdash;whether truthful or untruthful
  hardly matters in this connection&mdash;of his pilgrimage to Jerusalem, of
  the wanton destruction at the Holy Sepulchre by the Seljuk Turks, who took it
  somewhen about l075&mdash;the chronology of this period is still very
  vague&mdash;and of the exactions, brutalities and deliberate cruelties now
  practised upon the Christian pilgrims.to the Holy Places. Barefooted, clad in
  a coarse garment, riding on an ass and bearing a huge cross, this man
  travelled about France and Germany, and everywhere harangued vast crowds in
  church or street or market-place.</p>

  <p>Here for the first time we discover the masses of Europe with a common
  idea. Here is a collective response of indignation to the story of a remote
  wrong, a swift realisation of a common cause by rich and poor alike. You
  cannot imagine that happening in the Empire of Augustus Cregar, or, indeed,
  in any previous state in the world's history. Something of the kind might
  perhaps have been possible in the far smaller world of Hellas, or in Arabia
  before Islam. But this movement affected nations, kingdoms, tongues and
  peoples. We are dealing with something new that has come into the world.</p>

  <p>From the first this flaming enthusiasm was mixed with baser elements.
  There was the cold and calculated scheme of the free and ambitious Latin
  Church to subdue and replace the Byzantine Church; there was the freebooting
  instinct of the Normans, now tearing Italy to pieces, which turned readily
  enough to a new and richer world of plunder; and there was something in the
  multitude who now turned their faces east, something deeper than love in the
  human composition, namely, fear-born hate, that the impassioned appeals of
  the propagandists and the exaggeration of the horrors and cruelties of the
  infidel had fanned into flame.</p>

  <p>And still other forces were at work; the intolerant Seljuks and the
  intolerant Fatimites lay now an impassable barrier across the eastward trade
  of Genoa and Venice that had hitherto flowed through Baghdad, Aleppo and
  Egypt. Unless Constantinople and the Black Sea route were to monopolise
  Eastern trade altogether, they must force open these closed channels.
  Moreover, in 1094 and 1095 there had been a pestilence and famine from the
  Scheldt to Bohemia, and there was great social disorganisation.</p>

  <p>"No wonder," wrote Mr. Ernest Barker, "that a stream of emigration set
  towards the East, such as would in modern times flow towards a newly
  discovered goldfield&mdash;a stream carrying in its turbid waters much
  refuse: tramps and bankrupts, camp-followers and hucksters, fugitive monks
  and escaped villeins, and marked by the same motley grouping, the same fever
  of life, the same alternations of affluence and beggary, which mark the rush
  for a goldfield to-day."</p>

  <p>But these were secondary contributory causes. The fact of predominant
  interest to the historian of mankind is this will to crusade suddenly
  revealed as a new mass possibility in human affairs.</p>

  <p>The first forces to move eastward were great crowds of undisciplined
  people rather than armies, and they sought to make their way by the valley of
  the Danube, and thence southward to Constantinople. This has been called the
  "people's crusade". Never before in the whole history of the world had there
  been such a spectacle as these masses of practically leaderless people moved
  by an idea. It was a very crude idea. When they got among foreigners, they
  did not realise they were not already among the infidel. Two great mobs, the
  advance guard of the expedition, committed such excesses in Hungary, where
  the language was incomprehensible to them, that they were massacred. A third
  host began with a great pogrom of the Jews in the Rhineland, and this
  multitude was also destroyed in Hungary. Two other swarms under Peter himself
  reached Constantinople, to the astonishment and dismay of the Emperor
  Alexius. They looted and committed outrages, until he shipped them across the
  Bosphorus, to be massacred rather than defeated by the Seljuks (1096).</p>

  <p>This first unhappy appearance of the "people" as people in modern European
  history was followed in 1097 by the organised forces of the First Crusade.
  They came by diverse routes from France, Normandy, Flanders, England,
  Southern Italy and Sicily and the will and power of them were the Normans.
  They crossed the Bosphorus and captured Nicaea, which Alexius snatched away
  from them before they could loot it.</p>

  <p>Then they went to Antioch, which they took after nearly a year's siege.
  Then they defeated a great relieving army from Mosul.</p>

  <p>A large part of the crusaders remained in Antioch, a smaller force under
  Godfrey of Bouillon went on to Jerusalem. To quote Barker again: "After a
  little more than.a month's siege, the city was finally captured (July 15th,
  1099). The slaughter was terrible; the blood of the conquered ran down the
  streets, until men splashed in blood as they rode. At nightfall, 'sobbing for
  excess of joy', the crusaders came to the Sepulchre from their treading of
  the winepress, and put their blood-stained hands together in prayer. So, on
  that day of triumph, the First Crusade came to an end."</p>

  <p>The authority of the Patriarch of Jerusalem was at once seized upon by the
  Latin clergy with the expedition, and the Orthodox Christians found
  themselves in rather a worse case under Latin rule than under the Turk. There
  were already Latin principalities established at Antioch and Edessa, and
  between these various courts and kings began a struggle for ascendancy. There
  was an unsuccessful attempt to make Jerusalem a property of the Pope. These
  are complications beyond our present scope.</p>

  <p>Let us quote, however, a characteristic passage from Gibbon, to show the
  drift of events:</p>

  <p class="quote">"In a style less grave than that of history, I should
  perhaps compare the Emperor Alexius to the jackal, who is said to follow the
  steps and devour the leavings of the lion. Whatever had been his fears and
  toils in the passage of the First Crusade, they were amply recompensed by the
  subsequent benefits which he derived from the exploits of the Franks. His
  dexterity and vigilance secured their first conquest of Nicaea, and from this
  threatening station the Turks were compelled to evacuate the neighbourhood of
  Constantinople.</p>

  <p class="quote">"While the Crusaders, with blind valour, advanced into the
  midland countries of Asia, the crafty Greek improved the favourable occasion
  when the emirs of the sea coast were recalled to the standard of the Sultan.
  The Turks were driven from the islands of Rhodes and Chios; the cities of
  Ephesus and Smyrna, of Sardes, Philadelphia and Laodicea, were restored to
  the empire, which Alexius enlarged from the Hellespont to the banks of the
  Maeander and the rocky shores of Pamphylia. The churches resumed their
  splendour; the towns were rebuilt and fortified; and the desert country was
  peopled with colonies of Christians, who were gently removed from the more
  distant and dangerous frontier.</p>

  <p class="quote">"In these paternal cares we may forgive Alexius if he forgot
  the deliverance of the holy sepulchre; but by the Lains he was stigmatised
  with the foul reproach of treason and desertion. They had sworn obedience and
  fidelity to his throne; but he had promised to assist their enterprise in
  person, or, at least, with his troops and treasures; his base retreat
  dissolved all their old gains; and the sword, which had been the instrument
  of their victory, was the pledge and title of their just independence. It
  does not appear that the emperor attempted to revive his obsolete claims over
  the kingdom of Jerusalem, but the borders of Cilicia and Syria were more
  recent in his possession and more accessible to his arms. The great army of
  the crusaders was annihilated or dispersed; the principality of Antioch was
  left without a head, by the surprise and captivity of Bohemond; his ransom
  had oppressed him with a heavy debt; and his Norman followers were
  insufficient to repel the hostilities of the Greeks and Turks.</p>

  <p class="quote">"In this distress, Bohemond embraced a magnanimous
  resolution, of leaving the defence of Antioch to his kinsman, the faithful
  Tancred; of arming the West against the Byzantine Empire, and of executing
  the design which he inherited from the lessons and example of his father
  Guiscard. His embarkation was clandestine; and if we may credit a tale of the
  Princess Anna, he passed the hostile sea closely secreted in a coffin. (Anna
  Conpena adds that, to complete the imitation, he was shut up with a dead
  cock; and condescends to wonder how the barbarian could endure the
  confinement and putrefaction. This absurd tale is unknown to the
  Latins.)..."</p>

  <p>So Gibbon, caustic but veracious, detesting Roman and Byzantine with an
  impartial detestation, bears his witness.</p>

  <p>It was in this widening conflict of the Latin and the Greek that that
  theological freak of Charlemagne, the filioque clause, became important
  politically.</p>

  <p>We have traced the growth of this idea of a religious government of
  Christendom&mdash;and through Christendom of mankind&mdash;and we have shown
  how naturally and how necessarily, because of the tradition of world empire,
  it found a centre at Rome. The Pope of Rome was the only Western patriarch;
  he was the religious head of a vast region in which the ruling tongue was
  Latin; the other patriarchs of the Orthodox Church spoke Greek and so were
  inaudible throughout his domains;, and the two words filioque, which had been
  added to the Latin creed, now split off the Byzantine Christians by one of
  those impalpable and elusive doctrinal points upon which there is no
  reconciliation. (The final rupture was in 1054.)</p>

  <p>The broad reality of the Crusades was that all the surplus energy of the
  West, in a passion of greed, piety and virtuous indignation, poured down upon
  the far more sophisticated Levant and returned with a thousand hitherto
  unheard-of things. Most of the rank and file were killed off ("The men were
  splendid"), but the knights and noblemen who returned with their retinues
  came back with silk and velvet, dyes and chain armour, and cravings and
  conceptions of luxury that had been submerged in the minds of western men
  since the collapse of the Roman Empire.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">X. &mdash; A CATHOLIC GENTLEMAN OF 1440</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LET us now sketch the face and quality of human life in
  Europe at that time, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. We must clear
  our minds of the popular persuasion that the people who went to and fro in
  the towns and villages we inherit were very much like the people who walk
  about our streets to-day, except that they wore different costumes. That is a
  complete delusion. There was no such fancy dress ball. These
  fifteenth-century people were, on the average, twenty years younger, they
  were less healthy looking, and they stank quite abominably. The barbarism of
  the period was not primitive. It had arisen out of the decadence of a
  preceding social order. The great public baths of the Roman tradition had
  faded out of the crumbling social edifice. Not only are we misled by the
  natural anthropomorphism, so to speak, that makes us image the crowds in the
  past essentially like the crowds of to-day, but we are also misled by the
  pictures and records which misrepresent the spectacle of the times.</p>

  <p>The printed book had still to dawn upon the world, and whatever record was
  made of the show of things was kept by monkish chroniclers employed by the
  Princes and Potentates of the time. These keepers of the records sat and
  toiled to make their manuscripts as bright and pleasing to their employers as
  possible. So that our vision of that time is magically illuminated by their
  art. A reeking slum of human indignity is lit up by the flattering brightness
  of the subservient chronicler and the blazons of heraldry, and it is only
  when we subject them to a closer scrutiny that we are able to grasp the
  squalid facts of human life during that period.</p>

  <p>Then as no the world had its own loveliness, sunrise and sunset, the
  glorious onset of spring, the golden autumn, the white frost flowers upon the
  branches, but the dyes and fabrics of thirteenth- and fourteenth-century
  clothing in Christendom had none of the gilt and shining pigmentation of the
  illuminator. Clothing must have been still crude in colour and stale and
  dirty in substance. The normal span of life was brief and men were flimsier.
  We find the arm our of our ancestors too small and tight for even puny men
  to-day. But then, one may ask, was it worn by real grown-up men? These people
  were often married at thirteen, they were warriors and leaders in their later
  teens; they became cruel old satyrs at six-and-thirty. In fact they never
  grew up either physically or mentally. They lived in a world of witless
  lordship and puerile melodrama.</p>

  <p>From this disillusioning digression upon the brilliance in the fifteenth
  century, we can turn to one exceptionally "brilliant" young man, Gilles de
  Rais, a type of his time, of whose life we have by various accidents an
  exceptionally full record. He was married to a rich heiress at sixteen after
  two earlier attempts to make a match for him (the earliest at thirteen) had
  fallen through. He was a boy not only of exceptional energy but of
  exceptional gifts. He patronised music. He illuminated and bound books. And
  from the outset he was what people call "unbalanced".</p>

  <p>Some people may be disposed to account for his peculiar aberrations by
  saying he just "went mad". But madness is as pitiless and consistent a
  process as anything else that can happen, the sequence of ideas in those we
  call insane is as inevitable, you can find their origins and their
  associations, and nowadays when we are all out of harmony with our conditions
  of survival, to say merely that he "went mad" does not even put him outside
  the pale of normal experience. Exceptionally wealthy at the outset, his
  mental liveliness made him a spendthrift. Like many youngsters born rich, he
  could not imagine being hard up until he was. He liked to give extravagant
  entertainments, mysteries and moralities. From first to last he was a good
  Catholic, conscientiously and unfeignedly religious. But for that he might
  never have been hung. He dabbled in alchemy and the black arts; there was no
  Monte Carlo for him in those days and no turf&mdash;and he tried to make up
  for his magic by extravagant charity and special masses.</p>

  <p>All this is the behaviour of an uncontrolled upper-form schoolboy with a
  belief in his luck, an uncritical piety of the "Onward Christian Soldiers"
  type, and an unanalysed disposition to torment fags. It must be cited to
  place him definitely in relation to our own minds, but not in any way as a
  condonation of what he did. He was cruel; by all our standards he was
  hideously cruel; he delighted in the tormenting of children; and the points
  best worth discussing about him here are, <i>first,</i> whether he was an
  exceptional sinner, or whether his crimes were the outcome of a mental
  disposition that has always been operative since that wretched congestion of
  mankind which is called civilisation began; and <i>secondly</i>, and more
  important for our present purpose, how far the religious beliefs and
  practices of Catholic Christendom in the fifteenth century really condemned
  his abominations.</p>

  <p>The Christians before the days of Constantine the Great had stood out
  valiantly against the cruelties of the arena and for the practical
  brotherhood of man, but was the Church still doing so when Gilles de Rais was
  a great nobleman? The records tell that he was hung for the torture and
  murder of 140 children to which he confessed, in the year 1440. He had
  committed sacrilege and infringed clerical immunity by entering the Church of
  St. Etienne de Mer Morte just after Mass and dragging out a certain Jean de
  Ferron who was kneeling there in prayer. This precipitated the hostility and
  suspicion that was accumulating against him. As a sequel to this outrage he
  was arrested and cited before the Bishop of Nantes on various charges, of
  which sacrilege and heresy were the chief and these murders a scondary issue,
  A parallel enquiry was made by Pierre de l'Htpital, President of the Breton
  <i>parlement</i>, by whose sentence he was finally condemned. His piety and
  abject confession saved him from torture, of which he probably went in
  profound dread because of the fascination it had for him.</p>

  <p>He was hung, "housell'd, appointed, anel'd", more fortunate than Hamlet's
  father, and his body was saved from being burnt by "four or five dames and
  demoiselles of great estate", who removed his body from the flames of the
  pyre built so that he would fall into it. Manifestly they thought no great
  evil of what he had done. His two associates had no such social standing, and
  their bodies were burnt. This, I understand, will cause them considerable
  trouble at the Resurrection from which the aristocratic Gilles will be
  exempt.</p>

  <p>He began life brilliantly and honourably. He must have seemed a splendid
  young man to the world about him, and by every current standard he was
  splendid. He was a close ally and supporter of Joan of Arc, with whom he
  fought side by side at Orleans and later at Jargeau and Patay. He carried out
  the coronation of Charles VII at Reims, and he was made marichal of France
  upon that important occasion.</p>

  <p>This riddle of condonation of social inequality and cruelty confronts us
  at every stage of the long "Martyrdom of Man". Man is evidently an animal
  which will fight, and on occasion fight desperately, but which prefers to
  fight at an advantage. He has been readier to use moderation and make
  concessions when fighting against his quasi-equals than against those who are
  altogether helpless, and always he has shown little or no regard for his
  inferiors, the rank and file, still less for the feeble folk who get in his
  militant way. When a scorched earth policy had to be undertaken, or if they
  were Jews or infidels, they counted for nothing at all.</p>

  <p><i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, the dullest play perhaps produced by the
  Shakespeare group, exhibits an internal struggle between a liberal-minded and
  a prejudiced element in the group of players which vamped up that
  fundamentally dreary story of hate against hate. The struggle between these
  two elements goes on in every human grouping, not only between one man and
  another, but between what we are apt to call a man's better self and his
  lower nature between his sense of righteousness and his even more deeply
  rooted prejudices. It runs through the entire Christian story, and our case
  against the Catholic Church is that, albeit it originated in a passionate
  assertion of the conception. of brotherly equality, it relapsed steadily from
  the broad nobility of its beginnings and passed over at last almost
  completely to the side of persecution and the pleasures of cruelty.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">XI. &mdash; SOCIAL INEQUALITY IN THE 14TH AND 15TH
     CENTURIES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BY the onset of the fifteenth century, the generally
  youthful population of Christendom had achieved its maximum complex of human
  inequality, and displayed an intricacy of social stratification that only
  caste-ridden India could excel. If one turns over the pictures of those
  admirable compilations, M.A. Racinet's <i>Le Costume Historique</i>, or,
  still better, Adolf Rosenberg's <i>Geschichte des Kostums</i>, one can see
  the whole process of an incoherent barbarism passing visibly into an
  intensely sophisticated social structure, with an ever widening gap between
  class and class, in the course of three centuries. The common people still go
  half naked, or they wear skins and have rude puttees wrapped bout their
  feet.</p>

  <p>So the mass remains; but presently intermediate strata appear. Below the
  strenuous magnificence of the nobility' and gentry appear craftsmen
  subserving the expanding needs of their superiors. Upper servants appear, and
  attendants made passable in their appearances and even wearing liveries.</p>

  <p>Nobody catered for the ordinary man's clothing. He wore old cast-off
  stuff. Even to-day there is still a great market for cast-off clothes. Right
  down to the meddle nineteenth century "Paddy" was wearing inappropriate
  second-hands. His tail coat and deboshed top-hat was part of the fun the
  English made of him. Below the level of gentility nobody thought of catering
  for the lower-class body or the lower-class home. I am now nearly
  seventy-seven and I was brought up in a home in which everything, carpets,
  beds and all, except for a muslin curtain or so, had been bought at sales. It
  was an indignant philanthropist at Plymouth without any thought of gain who
  resolved to make furniture that would meet the needs of the poor home,
  lower-middle-class chiefly. He blundered into a fortune and launched
  Shoolbred's, Maple's, Heal's and all the rest of them on their vast
  prosperous careers. In the period of Gilles de Rais, no "inferior" dared
  enjoy anything until it had done its service at the rich man's table. To
  everyone in the world, this seemed altogether natural. Meanly and dirtily
  dressed, ill-nourished, ill-housed and despised; that was the lot of the
  vulgar. Witness our "myriad-minded" Shakespeare. How some one in that
  "myriad" could despise their "greasy caps" and mock their poor efforts to
  imitate and propitiate their betters!</p>

  <p>Dirt and mutual contempt, smothered resentments and cringing
  acquiescences. Such was social reality in the fifteenth century, in which
  Gilles de Rais lived, insanitary finery above brooding over great squalour.
  Such was the social atmosphere of the supreme disruptive phase in
  Christendom.</p>

  <p>Even when one scrutinises the sort of thing the fourteenth and fifteenth
  centuries esteemed finery, there is a cheapness of invention and a factor of
  animal assertion that jars upon the dignity and reservations of our maturer
  minds. The cod-piece, often formidably enlarged, witnesses to the sexual
  obsessions of these adolescent ancestors of ours, and suggests the
  <i>graffiti</i> of the public urinal which releases the awakening minds of
  contemporary youth.</p>

  <p>Apart from that, aspect of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the
  costume of the middling sort displays a resort to pinking, puffing, slashing,
  legs of different colours and the like feeble devices.</p>

  <p>Somewhen about this time there came a wave of better taste&mdash;I think
  out of Central Asia. It came with playing cards. The pinking and puffing and
  slashing, the silly long-toed shoes ad so forth, presently vanished before
  its influence&mdash; for a time. The court cards of the normal pack
  foreshadow the dress of the seventeenth century. This wave of better taste
  did not come with the returning Crusaders, but by some more northern route,
  about which I am equally curious and ignorant. With its onset a certain
  sobriety imposed itself upon the costume of the intermediate classes. Their
  superiors soon returned to the ruffs and bejewelled embroidery. Their
  inferiors remained squalid. As they are to this day.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">XII. &mdash; THE DAWN OF SOCIAL DISCONTENT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Now it happened that two very considerable stresses in the
  common way of living in Europe occurred in the middle fourteenth century. At
  first they had little to do with each other or with the religious development
  of Christendom. Later they were to revolutionise it altogether. They both
  came from the East. One was the Black Death; the other was the manufacture of
  paper and the obvious possibility it brought with it of printing uniform
  books from movable type. The one made labour dear; the other made books and
  knowledge cheap. The first, as we shall see, launched socialism upon the
  world; the second liberated the critical intelligence of mankind. Hitherto
  the subjugation of the common people had been an easy matter. There were
  plenty of them, and if they would not work for the Lord of the Manor or his
  sub-tenants, they could freeze and starve. Then came deliverance out of the
  East and found a ready soil in the filthy towns and dirty villages of the
  mediaeval countryside, the Great Pestilence.</p>

  <p>Never was there such a pestilence. It came and it returned. It well nigh
  blotted out mankind. More than half of the three or four millions who formed
  the population of England were swept away. There were no hands to till the
  soil; there were none left who could drive the straying cattle out of the
  fields and corn.</p>

  <p>For the first time in the history of Christendom there followed a struggle
  between property and the worker. Property, in accordance with its age-long
  established ideology, could find no better way of dealing with the universal
  distress than to assert that the workers must toil very much harder. The
  propertied classes of the desolation after the Black Death tried to tie such
  workers as there were to their jobs, by forbidding migration, fixing wages
  below starvation level, and so forth, and being very implacable about it
  all.</p>

  <p>The vague indignation of popular common sense found expression in the
  preaching of one whom the courtly Froissart called "a mad priest of Kent",
  John Ball.</p>

  <p>"Good people," cried the preacher, "things will never go well in England
  so long as goods be not in common, and so long as there be villeins and
  gentlemen. By what right are they whom we call lords greater folk than we? On
  what grounds have they deserved it? Why do they hold us in serfage? If we all
  came of the same father and mother, of Adam and Eve, how can they say or
  prove that they are better than we, if it be not that they make us gain for
  them by our toil that they spend in their pride? They are clothed in velvet
  and warm in their furs and their ermines, while we are covered with rags.
  They have wine and spices and fair bread; and we oat-cake and straw, and
  water to drink. They have leisure and fine houses; we have pain and labour,
  the rain and the wind in the fields. And yet it is of us and of our toil that
  these men hold their state."</p>

  <p>And so to the plain challenge of</p>

  <p class="verse">"When Adam delved and Eve span,<br>
  Who was then the gentleman?"</p>

  <p class="first">the French Jacquerie was simultaneous and all of a piece
  with the primordial socialism of John Ball. At that time Kent and the
  south-east of England were far more closely linked with the north-east of
  France in thought and social life than with the lands behind either region.
  There were parallel movements in Flanders, and especially Ghent and Bruges
  and Ypres. The Ghent weavers were the stoutest. "For six years, despite
  amazing vicissitudes, they held their own against the prince, the nobles and
  all 'good folk who had anything to lose'" (Henri Pirenne, <i>A History of

  <p>How Wat Tyler was murdered; how later on John Ball was executed in the
  sight of Richard lI; how that tragic and inglorious king lied and cheated his
  way out of the Peasant Revolt; how the people trusted him and were massacred
  for their touching disposition to accept the word of a gentleman; and how,
  after a phase of alleviation, due to the fact that the more they were
  butchered the rarer they became, they increased and multiplied and were
  economically debased once more; all that is to be found in any history.</p>

  <p>But the spirit of that Kentish revolt did not die; it remained as an
  insubordination that presently, with the translation and presently the
  printing and cheapening of the Bible and the downward extension of literacy
  that ensued, developed into religious recalcitrance, into nonconformity and
  dissent, into radicalism and at last into lucid world socialism, against
  which tradition, the old idea of lord over inferior as the natural structure
  of society, never completely reinstated itself.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch13a"
     name="ch13a">XIIIa. &mdash; THE MENTAL ATMOSPHERE BEFORE THE
     REFORMATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT must be understood that it was from within the body of
  the Catholic Church that the destruction of its own unity came. It was men in
  holy orders striving to be good Christians who began to question the methods
  and disciplines of the Church. The Reformation came out of the heart of the
  Church. It was the subtle and obstinate Wycliffe who denied
  Transubstantiation and split off a living and progressive Protestantism from
  an ever more reactionary Church, who had the Bible translated into the vulgar
  tongue, and, together with his pupil, Jan Huss, begot the Reformation.</p>

  <p>The spirit of Protestantism sprang from men who took their unquestioning
  Catholic faith with such seriousness that they could not but protest against
  the evil things they beheld about them. In the less critical eleventh
  century, in the days when Hildebrand (Pope Gregory VII) was bracing up the
  solidarity of the Church by insisting on priestly celibacy and the complete
  detachment from normal human living that this involved, there had been an
  extraordinary willingness to believe the Catholic priesthood good and wise.
  Relatively it was wiser and better in those days. Great powers beyond her
  spiritual functions had been entrusted to the Church, and very extraordinary
  freedoms. The tragedy of the Church is that she put her spiritual influence
  to evil ends and abused her freedoms without measure.</p>

  <p>The Pope was the supreme lawgiver of Christendom, and his court at Rome
  the final and decisive court of appeal. The Church levied taxes; it had not
  only vast properties and a great income from fees, but it imposed a tax of a
  tenth, the tithe, upon its subjects. It did not call for this as a pious
  benefaction; it demanded it as a right. Steadily more and more of the
  nation's property fell into the dead hand (Mortmain) of the Church and paid
  its tribute to St. Peter. The clergy, on the other hand, claimed exemption
  from lay taxation.</p>

  <p>This attempt to trade upon their peculiar prestige and evade their share
  in fiscal burdens was certainly one considerable factor in the growing
  dissatisfaction with the clergy. Apart from any question of justice, it was
  impolitic. It made taxes seem ten times more burthensome to those who had to
  pay. It made everyone resent the immunities of the Church.</p>

  <p>And a still more extravagant and unwise claim made by the Church was the
  claim to the power of dispensation. It did not interpret right and wrong now;
  it was above right and wrong and it could make wrong right and right wrong.
  The Pope in many instances set aside the laws of the Church in individual
  cases; he allowed cousins to marry, permitted a man to have two wives,
  released men from vows. The Church's crowning folly in the sixteenth century
  was the sale of indulgence whereby the sufferings of the soul in purgatory
  could be commuted for money payment.</p>

  <p>By the dawn of the sixteenth century, the Church, blindly and rashly, had
  come to a final parting of the ways. The force of protest, that is to say of
  Protestantism, was gathering against it, and the alternatives, whether it
  would modernise or whether it would .dogmatise or fight, were before it. It
  chose to fight and tyrannise.</p>

  <p>Before the thirteenth century it had been customary for the Pope to make
  occasional inquests or enquiries into heresy in this region or that, but
  Innocent III found in the Dominicans a powerful instrument of suppression.
  The Inquisition was organised as a standing enquiry under their direction and
  with fire and torture the Church set itself, through this instrument, to
  assail and weaken the human conscience in which its sole hope of world
  dominion resided. Before the thirteenth century the penalty of death had been
  inflicted but rarely upon heretics and unbelievers. Now in a hundred
  market-places in Europe the dignitaries of the Church watched the blackened
  bodies of its antagonist, for the most part poor and insignificant people,
  burn and sink pitifully, and their own great mission to mankind burn and sink
  with them into dust and ashes.</p>

  <p>Chaucer, one of the most typical and commanding figures in English
  literature, in his Canterbury Tales, gives incidentally and inadvertently a
  picture of the state of opinion about the Church on the very eve of the
  impending Reformation. We have a company of pilgrims going to
  Canterbury&mdash;for a pilgrimage was then the only way of taking a holiday
  in comparative security and they are all, like Chaucer himself, nominally
  good Catholics. They are, so to speak, provisionally Catholics, there being
  no alternative. Except the enthusiasm of Lollardry. Yet their critical
  contempt for the methods and exactions of the Church is plain and outspoken,
  and the two most contemptible figures in his vivid album are two clerical
  officials, the summoner and the pardoner.</p>

  <p>It is our misfortune that his contribution to EnglIsh literature is
  practically unreadable in its original form. The language was not yet fixed
  and it underwent profound changes afar his death in 1400. It was fixed by the
  translation of the Bible an the literary activities of the later Tudor
  period, and now the ordinary reader of English can read him comfortably only
  in such I modernisations as that of J.U. Nicolson.</p>

  <p>Chaucer was nearly sixty in 1400 and yet death took him by surprise and
  only a third of the writings he was collecting under the title of the
  Canterbury Tales had been assembled. Yet even so, they witness to his amazing
  versatility and have distinctive English qualities that were afterwards to
  reappear in the humorist in Shakespeare, in Fielding, in Dickens and a host
  of lesser story tellers down to such contemporary writers as Christopher
  Morley, and which are manifest in equal measure in no other literature.</p>

  <p>All of them display that keen interest in individual facts and that
  distaste for dogmatic and enthusiastic final judgments which has
  characterised English thought and literature from its beginning. This
  sceptical mentality, which is so manifest in the English make-up, ranges fro
  a sort of obstinate, stupid and conservative unteachableness to a profound
  and explicit perception of the unreality of appearances, and the
  impossibility of ultimate solutions. There is every type of intermediate
  mentality in the English world, but they possess a family likeness. The
  British oaf and the British genius are born brothers.</p>

  <p>This innate disposition to regard all existence as experimental and to
  distrust and reject the glib profundities of the religious "mystic" is
  incomprehensible to many Indian minds. Their objection finds typical
  expression in Shakespeare through Eastern Eyes by Mr. Ranjee G. Shahani,
  B.A., D.Litt., which has somehow got on to my reading desk. For "Shakespeare"
  we may substitute the Englishman.</p>

  <p>Mr. Ranjee G. Shahani is oblivious to the obvious probability of a mixed
  origin for Shakespeare's plays, and he finds a confession of faith in any
  utterance of any character in any of them, and, regardless of the entirely
  provisional nature of language and of all human symbols, he lets loose at
  this sample Western with a voluminous smoke screen of pretentious gabble.
  This sort of thing:</p>

  <p class="quote">"An Indian would say that Shakespeare had not probed far
  enough into the human soul and the Over-Soul we call God. Now the Oriental
  thinker is profoundly concerned not only in understanding these principles
  but in finding a relation between them. The fundamental thought of the
  Upanishads&mdash;writings containing the most occult and mystical ideas of
  the Hindus&mdash;consists in the recognition of the oneness of the Brahman
  and Atman, of God and the Soul. This is also the quintessential principle of
  the Vedanta system. 'Who could breathe who could exist,' declares the Kena
  Upanishad, 'if there were not the bliss of Brahma within the ether of his
  heart?' Sir Edwin Arnold rightly gauges the Indian spirit when he says that
  though inconceivable to the mind, this all comprehensive Being is still a
  necessity of true thought, and veritable beyond every other conception of
  reality'.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The Hindu dharma declares that man does not live by his
  appetites alone: he must live by his life of spirit also. Moksha is the goal
  indicated. Moksha is freedom from the perpetuity of incarnation. It is in the
  end the union of the finite with the Infinite&mdash;the merging of the
  individual soul with the illimitable ocean. In other words, this is the
  nirvana of the Buddha....</p>

  <p class="quote">"To the Oriental mind, religious mysticism is a sheer joy.
  The entire literature of India is steeped in this element. But when the
  Indian turns to Shakespeare he finds that this mystic quality is utterly
  absent... .</p>

  <p class="quote">"Devotees of East and West declare that no joy transcends
  that which is derived from mystical experience. Roumi, Kabir, Meister
  Eckhart, Swedenborg, St. Theresa, St. John of the Cross, and many others, all
  bear witness to the same effect. Surely, there is nothing finer or higher for
  man than to know what, 'in the last analysis, holds the universe together.'
  This is the question that Faust asks himself, and so does every mystic. For
  Vivekananda, as for Ramakrishna, his master, 'the knowledge of Brahma is the
  ultimate end, the highest destiny of man'...</p>

  <p class="quote">"Mr. Middleton Murry, in harmony with the ancients,
  considers the poet as a <i>vates sacer</i>, bearing a direct message from
  God....</p>

  <p class="quote">"'The poetry of mysticism,' says Miss Evelyn Underhill,
  'might be defined on the one hand as a temperamental reaction to the vision
  of Reality; on the other, as a form of prophecy. As it is the special
  vocation of the mystical consciousness to mediate between two orders, going
  out in loving adoration towards God and coming home to tell. the secrets of
  Eternity to other men; so the artistic self-expression of this consciousness
  has also a double character. It is love-poetry, but love-poetry, which is
  often written with a missionary intention.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"The Indian fails to find anything of this kind in
  Shakespeare. His poetry is not an outburst of ecstasy and exaltation. We
  discover this combination in the Persian mystics, in the Sufi poets, in a few
  Western bards, and in the Christian saints. We also detect this fusion in
  Kabir. Let us listen to one of his poems translated by the united efforts of
  Rabindranath Tagore and Miss Evelyn Underhill:</p>

  <pre style="margin-left:20%; font-family:Georgia; font-style:italic">
Tell me, O Swan, your ancient tale.
From what land do you come, O Swan?
To what shore will you fly?
Where would you take your rest, O Swan,
And what do you seek?

Even this morning, O Swan, awake, arise, follow me!
There is a land where no doubt nor sorrow have rule:
Where the terror of Death is no more.

There the woods of spring are a-bloom,
And the fragrant scent "He is I" is borne on the wind:
There the bee of the heart is deeply immersed,
And desires no other joy.
</pre>

  <p class="footnote"
     style="margin-left:30%">From <i>Songs of Kabir</i>. Translated by
     Rabindranath Tagore, 1916</p><br>

  <p>In the presence of this sort of ecstasy the broad stream of creative
  literature in England from Chaucer to the present day unites in making loud
  rude sceptical noises.</p>

  <p>The first story in the Chaucer portfolio is the Knight's story of Palamon
  and Arcite, a lengthy and dignified story after the Italian, of an exalted
  nobility and chastity. Next to that, as this time it is no translation, and
  as it were a relief from that, the drunken miller tells his obscene story of
  how the carpenter was cuckolded and mocked by Nicholas the clerk and how
  Absalom the parish priest was mocked and disgusted.</p>

  <p>Whereupon the reeve is moved to tell of the outrageous cuckolding of a
  miller, and the cook begins brightly with a spendthrift gentleman who "had a
  wife that kept, for countenance, a shop and whored to gain her sustenance",
  or, to quote the original, "<i>hadde a wyf that heeld for contenance a
  shoppe, and swyved for hir sustenance</i>". But this fragment of life ends
  abruptly. It was never finished.</p>

  <p>The sailor follows and tells the story of a mercenary woman and her
  passion for a monk, of which the moral is, "Invite no more monks to your
  house or inn", and then comes Madame Eglantine, the prioress, who tells a
  horrifying invention about the murder of a boy in a "Jewry" through which
  Christian boys were unwisely allowed to pass, and how, being murdered and
  buried, he still sang on to reveal his fate. That Madame Eglantine, we are
  told in the Prologue,</p>

    <pre style="margin-left:20%; font-family:Georgia; font-style:italic">
  ...was so charitable and piteous
  That she would weep if she but saw a mouse
  Caught in a trap, though it were dead or bled.
  She had some little dogs, too, that she fed
  On roasted flesh, or milk, or fine white bread.
  But sore she'd weep if one of them were dead,
  Or if men smote it with a rod to smart:
  For pity ruled her, and her tender heart."
</pre>

  <p>And this is the piteous way in which she deals with the Jews:</p>

  <pre style="margin-left:20%; font-family:Georgia; font-style:italic">
  With torture and with shameful death each one,
  The provost did these cursed Hebrew serve
  Who of the murder knew, and that anon;
  From justice to the villains he'd not swerve.
  Evil shall have what evil does deserve.
  And therefore, with wild horses; did he draw,
  And after hang, their bodies, all by law."
</pre>

  <p>And how she recalls the alleged "Ritual Murder" of Hugh of Lincoln:</p>

  <pre style="margin-left:20%; font-family:Georgia; font-style:italic">
O you young Hugh of Lincoln, slain also
By cursed Jews, as is well known to all,
Since it was but a little while ago,
Pray you for us, sinful and weak, who call
That, of His Mercy, God will still let fall
Something of grace, and mercy multiply,
For reverence of His Mother dear on high. Amen.
</pre>

  <p>Chaucer himself is then called upon, and produces Sir Thopas, a cheerful
  burlesque of the old-fashioned romantic stories, until the host implores him
  in extremely foul language to discontinue. Whereupon he turns about and tells
  a tale of Melibeus and the wisdom and goodness of forgiving. Here the
  Lollards get a passing word from the sailor, "impatient at their zeal".</p>

  <pre style="margin-left:20%; font-family:Georgia; font-style:italic">
"I smell a Lollard in the wind;" quoth he.
"Ho, good men!" said our host, "no hearken me;
Wait but a bit, for God's high passion do,
For we shall have a sermon ere we're through;
This Lollard here will preach to us somewhat."
"Nay, by my father's soul, that he shall not!"
Replied the sailor. "Here he shall not preach,
Nor comment on the gospels here, nor teach.
We all believe in the great God," said he,
"But he would sow among us difficulty,
Or sprinkle cockles in our good clean corn."
</pre>

  <p>In this promiscuous careless fashion the great portfolio spills its varied
  contents. The Wife of Bath, a companion piece to Mistress Quickly, and almost
  as great a figure of comedy, comes upon the scene....</p>

  <p>So we sample the state of mind of England on the very eve of the
  Reformation. The melange of intense amusement at individual character, with
  parody and gross laughter, is possible only because of the entire absence of
  any urgent positive convictions. And as it was in the beginning, so it is
  with English thought and art to this day.</p>

  <p>Langland, who wrote <i>The Vision of Piers Plowman</i>, was a contemporary
  of Chaucer. His manuscript was recopied with variations and additions and
  passed from hand to hand. It witnesses to the same state of corruption and
  indifference on the part of those who ruled over the Church as does Chaucer,
  but its criticism of abuses is far bitterer. While Chaucer is essentially
  irreligious, Langland is a theologian, and, though he believes himself to be
  an entirely orthodox Christian, his doctrine is substantially a sort of
  Calvinistic Humanitarianism. His "Christ" is Everyman, the common man at your
  elbow. In the fourteenth century, recurrent epidemics, local famines, and
  storms of violence seemed to be in the natural order of things. Everyone was
  at least intermittently ill and most people were by our modern standards
  under-vitalised. News soaked about the world haphazard, was distorted or
  evaporated. The Black Death, the revolt of John Ball and the men of Kent, are
  ignored by both Chaucer and Langland, nor had they the slightest knowledge of
  Roger Bacon's vision of the possibilities of mental release and human
  welfare. Yet, unaware of each other and each after his fashion, such
  Englishmen were feeling their way out of the mental darkness of the mediaeval
  world.</p>

  <p>Not only the moral but the intellectual prestige of Rome was fading in the
  growing light of the times. Wycliffe (1320-1384) was a learned doctor at
  Oxford; for a time he was Master of Balliol; and he held various livings in
  the Church. Quite late in his life he began a series of outspoken criticisms
  of the corruption of the clergy and the unwisdom of the Church.</p>

  <p>Be organised a number of poor priests, the Wycliffites, to spread his
  ideas throughout England; and in order that people should judge between the
  Church and himself, he had the Bible translated into English.</p>

  <p>He was a more learned and far abler man than either St. Francis or St.
  Dominic. He had supporters in high places and a great following among the
  people; and though Rome raged against him and ordered his imprisonment, he
  died a free man, still administering the sacraments as parish priest of
  Lutterworth.</p>

  <p>The black and ancient spirit that was leading the Church to its
  destruction would not let his bones rest in his grave. By a decree of the
  Council of Constance, in 1415, his remains were ordered to be dug up and
  burnt, an order which was carried out, at the command of Pope Martin V, by
  Bishop Fleming in 1428. This desecration was not the act of some isolated
  fanatic; it was the official act of this Church we now indict.</p>

  <p>All through four centuries of dwindling prestige, Rome, with a sort of
  senile obstinacy, persisted in its encroachments upon both the princes and
  peoples of Christendom, and still it was blind to the vulnerability of its
  own position in the face of the forces it was provoking against itself. The
  princes realised more and more clearly the huge proportion of wealth in the
  Mortmain and the ever-growing tribute they paid without compensation to Rome.
  They lose their trust in ecclesiastical. statesmen with a foot in either
  camp; and looked about them for more complaisant ministers. The people mocked
  at the all too frequent scandals in the convents and monasteries and at the
  worldliness of the higher ecclesiastics. Rome remained blind to the
  development of an upper and nether millstone about itself, and still stuck to
  its ever narrower and ever more exacting claims. The smouldering fire blazed
  up at last in open rebellion, the Reformation.</p>

  <p>The Reformation had a threefold aspect. The Princes' Reformation wanted to
  stop the flow of money to Rome, and seize the moral authority, the
  educational power and the material possessions of the Church within their
  dominions; the Reformation, according to the people, sought to make
  Christianity a power against the unrighteousness of the rich and powerul; and
  a movement of Reformation within the Church, of which St. Francis of Assisi
  was the precursor, sought to restore the unifying virtue of the Church, and,
  through its virtue, its power.</p>

  <p>The Princes had no intention of releasing the judgments of their subjects,
  more particularly when it took on the quality, as we should now say, of a
  revolutionary popular socialism.</p>

  <p>They sought merely to oust the papal influence and establish national
  churches dependent upon themselves. As England, Scotland, Sweden, Norway,
  Denmark, North Germany and Bohemia broke away from the Roman communion, the
  princes and their ministers showed the utmost solicitude to keep the movement
  under control. Just as much Reformation as would sever the link with Rome
  they permitted. Anything beyond that, any dangerous break towards the
  primitive teachings of Jesus or the crude direct interpretation of the Bible,
  they resisted. The Established Church of England is one of the most typical
  and successful of the resulting compromises, still sacramental and
  sacerdotal.</p>

  <p>The popular Reformation was very different and its spirit and quality
  varied from country to country. The wide spiritual upheavals of the time were
  at once more honest, more confused, more enduring, and less immediately
  successful than the reforms of the princes. Very few religious-spirited men
  had the daring to break away or the effrontery to confess that they had
  broken away from all authoritative teaching, and that they were now relying
  entirely upon their own minds and consciences. That required a very high
  intellectual courage. The general drift of the common man in this period in
  Europe was to set up his new acquisition, the Bible, as a counter-authority
  to the Church. This was the case with the great leader of German
  Protestantism, Martin Luther (1483-1546).</p>

  <p>All over Germany, and, indeed, all over Western Europe, there were now men
  spelling over the black-letter pages of the newly-translated and printed
  Bible, over the Book of Leviticus and the Song of Solomon and the Revelation
  of St. John the Divine&mdash;strange and perplexing books&mdash;quite as much
  as over the simple and inspiring record of Jesus in the Gospels. Naturally,
  they produced grotesque interpretations. It is surprising that they were not
  stranger and grotesquer. But the bulk of these new Bible students took what
  their consciences approved from the Bible, squared it to their sense of human
  right and dignity, and ignored its riddles and contradictions.</p>

  <p>The strangest of these outbreaks of social and religious revolt occurred
  in Germany. It had a certain parallelism with the social and religious
  outbreak in Western Europe two centuries before. The religious disturbances
  were releasing men's criticism of social inequality, but now, instead of
  being illiterate believers in the established Christian story of the world,
  as they were told it in church, they had a storm of open doctrinal discussion
  about them and the Bible to puzzle over for themselves. The impulse, as ever,
  was to assume the entire corruption of the Roman Church, and to revert to a
  conception of an early Christianity when the faithful had their goods in
  common and the only rule for the true believer was the inner light in his
  conscience under the guidance of God. The Anabaptists (from
  <i>Anabaptismo</i>, which means to re-baptise, because they denied the
  validity of infant baptism) seized upon the town of Munster and set
  themselves to establish there a new Kingdom of God upon earth.</p>

  <p>The inner light and an indigestion of Bible and speculative theology
  produced amazing results. Bockhold, a tailor, better known in history as John
  of Leyden, inspired by dreams and visions, ruled the town. Like Hitler, he
  was mentally unbalanced and he dominated his associates by his frenzied
  vehemence. They did not gainsay him, they followed his example. He changed
  the name of Munster to Zion and declared himself the successor of King David.
  He restored polygamy, which as a matter of fact never has disappeared from
  Christendom so far as those who have had the means to practise it are
  concerned. He himself had four wives, one of whom he beheaded in the
  market-place with his own hand. For no recorded reason. For a year, says my
  authority, Munster was "a scene of unbridled profligacy", which means in
  effect that people did not draw the blinds. Then the town was stormed, and
  outraged social order tortured John and his leading associates with great
  ingenuity, finally executing and exposing their mangled bodies. So this
  German essay in social and religious revolution ended, and the masses were
  brought to heel. They had gone farther and fared worse than the populace of
  any other country.</p>

  <p>All over Europe, a living and very active residuum of Protestants remained
  who declined to have their religion made over for them by their princes. They
  were a medley of sects, having nothing in common but their resistance to
  authoritative religion, whether of the Pope or of the State. In Germany,
  after the Anabaptist collapse, popular nonconformity was or the most part
  stamped out by the princes; in Great Britain dissent remained sober, powerful
  and various. Many of the differences in the behaviour of the German, and the
  British peoples may be traceable to the relative suppression of free judgment
  in Germany at this time.</p>

  <p>Most, but not all, of these Nonconformists and Dissenters held to the
  Bible as a divinely inspired and authoritative guide. This was a strategic
  rather than an abiding position, and the modern drift of Nonconformity has
  been onward away from this original Bibliolatry towards a mitigated and
  sentimentalised recognition of the bare teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.
  Beyond the range of nonconformity, beyond the range of professed Christianity
  at all, there was also now a great and growing mass of equalitarian belief
  and altruistic impulse, which released a smouldering innate sense of justice
  in the human make-up.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch13b"
     name="ch13b">XIIIb. &mdash; HOW HENRY VIII BECAME A PROTESTANT
     PRINCE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE motives of the princes and the feelings of the masses
  fluctuated through the period of the Reformation very widely. Personal
  factors came into play. Henry VIII of England began his reign as a devout
  Roman Catholic. He wrote against heresy and was rewarded by the Pope with the
  title of Defender of the Faith. "<i>Fid. Def.</i>" is still on the obverse of
  many British coins. England seemed saved for Rome. Then his attention strayed
  from his wife Catherine of Aragon to a livelier young woman called Anne
  Boleyn, and, because the Church would not set aside his marriage and leave
  him free to marry this new mistress, he went over (carrying England with him)
  to the Protestant side.</p>

  <p>Yet Rome had been very obliging to Henry in the matter of his marriage.
  Catherine of Aragon was the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, the
  Ferdinand and Isabella of Columbus and the conquest of Granada, and she was
  married to Arthur, the elder brother of Henry, in 1501. Both bride and
  bridegroom were then sixteen years old. They were childless, and Prince
  Arthur died in the following year. But the papal policy, which was then
  hostile to France, dictated a close association between Spain and England,
  and, with a complete disregard of its own teachings, the Holy See granted a
  dispensation to allow her to marry Henry. The dispensation was granted in
  1503, but the young prince showed no great appetite for the lady, and the
  actual union only occurred six years later.</p>

  <p>Catherine was plain to look upon, thick-set and irritatingly pious,
  obstinate and well-educated. During that interval Henry's youthful passions
  had found an outlet elsewhere, and he had an illegitimate son. Henry, whom he
  afterwards made Duke of Richmond. Catherine, poor young woman, had a dull
  time meanwhile. This tepid marriage of policy produced six children all of
  whom died in infancy or were stillborn, except one daughter, Mary, and
  popular opinion attributed this to the divine resentment against incest, with
  which idea Henry was only too disposed to agree, as his weariness with
  Catherine increased. He developed conscientious scruples over that papal
  dispensation and betrayed a disposition to legitimise his bastard the Duke of
  Richmond, to whom he gave precedence not only over all the peers of the realm
  but over Catherine's daughter Mary.</p>

  <p>Here was a problem which evoked all the intricate insincerity of the Roman
  system. It had swallowed that dispensation from its own doctrine. Could it
  now regurgitate?</p>

  <p>The great and ingenious Cardinal Wolsey suggested a quiet little suit
  against the King for incest, to release him from his bonds. There was much
  coming and going of the perplexed learned, of University doctors and papal
  legates. A divorce was out of the question if the dispensation and marriage
  were invalid; then plainly the King was free, and the subsequent negotiations
  turned upon that point. The more fervently the King wanted his Anne Boleyn,
  the more convinced he was that he had been living in mortal sin with
  Catherine. A considerable amount of pride and obstinacy in Catherine's
  make-up frustrated the Church in its efforts to get her to retire to a
  nunnery and cease her resistance to the annulment. The Church veered round to
  her side. Pope Clement issued a brief forbidding the King to make a second
  marriage and commanding him to restore Catherine's connubial rights. And so
  Henry broke with Rome and England came down on the Protestant side.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">XIV. &mdash; THE COUNTER-REFORMATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE Reformation had caught the Church of Rome in a state of
  lax internal discipline, exasperating aggression and intolerance and
  blindness to the drift of worldly events. But her prestige was still very
  great, there were multitudes of the perplexed but still obedient Faithful,
  and the self-seeking princes and influential owners of property felt a deeper
  menace of popular release and criticism beneath the Reformation.</p>

  <p>The Roman Catholic Church, no longer the Catholic Church, woke up to the
  realities of her position, to the threat of complete destruction at no very
  distant date unless she organised herself to resist.</p>

  <p>The Reformation, the expropriation of the monastic properties and the
  revolt against the ascendancy of Rome, lasted for less than a century, and
  then it was overtaken by the Counter Reformation of the alarmed and awakened
  Roman Church. It was a belated awakening, and its history unfolds the same
  record, on an intensified scale of confused motives, levity of purpose,
  obstinate insistence upon freakish doctrinal points, the fear of death that
  arises from belief in an incalculable future life and in a pitilessly
  vindictive deity, amenable only to the magic of orthodox formulae, which
  hitherto had confused and had now split Christendom.</p>

  <p>The Counter Reformation fell back upon the ideal of Christendom as an
  obedient family of nations under the parental guidance of the Pope. In
  France, where the issue was fought out very typically, the Church directed
  the reaction to a revival of the tradition of Joan of Arc, the associate of
  that abominable torturer of children, Gilles de Rais, Marshal of France, and
  adopted as its symbol and banner the double cross of Lorraine&mdash; the
  banner and symbol to-day of Charles de Gaulle, that strange protege of the
  British Foreign Office. The Holy League (La Sainte Ligue) organised the
  Counter-Reformation under that symbol. There was a phase of attempted
  compromise broken by the Roman Catholics, who murdered a number of Huguenots
  assembled for divine worship in a barn at Poissy. A fluctuating civil war
  ensued, Treaties of peace were made when no peace was possible. Coligny,
  outstanding Huguenot leader, was assassinated and matters culminated in the
  massacre of St. Bartholomew's Eve (August 1572).</p>

  <p>The initiative for the crime rests with Catherine de Medici. Disquieted by
  the growing influence of Admiral Coligny, who against her wishes was
  endeavouring to draw Charles IX into a war with Spain, she resolved to have
  him murdered. The first attempt failed, however, and Catherine then
  determined to massacre all the Huguenot leaders. She got Coligny in the
  general bag. The massacre began on August 24, St. Bartholomew's Day, at
  daybreak, and continued in Paris till September 17th. From Pans, it spread to
  the provinces. The Duc de Longueville in Picardy, Chabot-Charny (son of
  Admiral Chabot) at Dijon, the Comte de Matignon (1525-97) in Normandy and
  other provincial governors refused to authorise the massacres. Frangois
  Hotman estimates the number killed in the whole of France at 50,000.
  Catherine de Medici received the congratulations of all the Catholic powers,
  and Pope Gregory XIII commanded bonfires to be lighted and a medal to be
  struck.</p>

  <p>A sturdy remnant of Huguenots remained and was able to hold out against
  the murder policy of the pontiff. He had rejoiced too soon. Sufficient
  Protestants had survived for an effective rally. Many of them, like Conde and
  Henry IV of Navarre, escaped that night of murder by a precipitate and quite
  temporary conversion to Catholicism.</p>

  <p>This Henry IV is an outstanding figure in this history, and one very
  typical of the times. He was of Protestant upbringing and throughout his life
  his soundly Protestant bias was manifest. He was a wit and a rake and he
  suffered from, and was evidently greatly entertained by, the temptations
  natural to an exceptionally "charming" person. When he found the Holy League
  strongly established in Paris against him, he took the wind out of its
  intolerant sails by becoming a Catholic himself. "Paris," he jested, "was
  well worth a Mass." But he saw to it that the Huguenots got something like
  active protection from another St. Bartholomew's Eve by the Edict of Nantes,
  and the protective vigilance of his great minister Sully gave the common
  people roads, canals, industries and a "fowl in the pot" on Sunday for every
  peasant.</p>

  <p>The Edict of Nantes was revoked by King Louis XIV. He was the Most
  Christian King and eldest son of the Church, ruler not only of the bodies of
  his subjects but of their souls. He felt himself called upon to establish the
  unity of the faith and to repel with the hand of orthodoxy all Dissenters,
  Huguenots, Jansenists and Quietists. The Huguenots had long enjoyed freedom
  of worship and had prospered conspicuously in th fields of industry,
  agriculture and commerce. The Compagnie Saint-Sacrament resented these
  immunities, and through its influence between 1661 and 1685 the Huguenots
  were exposed to increasingly heavy penalties and successfully excluded from
  States-General, the diplomatic service, and the municipalities, and deprived
  of their hospitals, colleges, academies and schools. Fines proving
  inadequate, soldiers were quartered upon the recalcitrant by Louvois and
  encouraged to behave with the utmost brutality (the dragonnades) until at
  last Louis revoked the Edict of Nantes altogether (1685), as being out of
  date and no longer necessary in a re-unified France, re-unified largely by
  massacre. There followed on the part of the Huguenots an emigration en masse,
  to the great benefit of the trade and industries of London.</p>

  <p>Still later came the revolt of the Camisards and its savage suppression
  and a civil war in the Cevennes, which held the Royal Armies in check from
  1703 to 1711, at a time when the kingdom was threatened with invasion. So it
  was that the true Church defended itself, reckless even of the safety of the
  state which sustained it.</p>

  <p>In 1665 one of these Roman Catholic massacres of Protestants was in
  progress in Savoy. For a considerable period a remnant of the Waldenses had
  escaped the pious murder storms that were eliminating French Protestantism,
  under the protection of the Duke of Savoy, but he was so ill advised as to
  respond to the solicitations of the Church and join in the fun of massacre.
  He killed a lot, but those who escaped into the mountains sent an appeal to
  England. England was then in a phase of extreme protestantism under the
  protectorate of Oliver Cromwell. A National fast was ordered, #40,000 was
  collected for the immediate relief of the victims, and immediate hostilities
  from the sea were threatened. So high had the Protestant regime raised the
  prestige of the country that the Duke collapsed at once. The occasion was
  made memorable by Milton, whose indignant sonnet is one of the greatest in
  the language. It runs as follows:</p>

  <pre style="margin-left:20%; font-family:Georgia; font-style:italic">
Avenge, O Lord, Thy slaughter'd saints, whose bones
  Lie scatter'd on the Alpine mountains cold;
  Ev'n them who kept Thy truth so pure of old,
  When all our fathers worshipp'd stocks and stones,
Forget not: in Thy book record their groans,
  Who were Thy sheep, and in their ancient fold
  Slain by the bloody Piedmontese that roll'd
  Mother with infant down the rocks. Their moans
The vales redoubled to the hills, and they
  To Heav'n. Their martyr'd blood and ashes sow
  O'er all the Italian fields, where still doth sway
The triple tyrant; there from these may grow
  A hundredfold, who having learn'd Thy way
  Early may fly the Babylonian woe.
</pre>

  <p>Milton is one of the strongest figures English Protestantism has ever
  produced, a combination of colossal learning, religious independence and a
  passion for outspoken truth and rational action, strange to controversialists
  upon whatever side in those days of conflict. He had manifest weaknesses. He
  had so great a regard for his personal appearance that he preferred to go
  blind rather than wear spectacles. But he could anticipate our modern ideas
  by such wisdom as this:</p>

  <p class="quote">"... as good almost kill a man as kill a good book: who
  kills a man kills a reasonable creature, God's image; but he who destroys a
  good book kills reason itself, kills the image of God as it were, in the eye.
  Many a man lives a burden to the earth; but a good. book is the precious
  life-blood of a master- spirit, embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a
  life beyond life. 'Tis true no age can restore a life, whereof perhaps there
  is no great loss; and revolutions of ages do not oft recover the loss of a
  rejected truth, for the want of which whole nations fare the worse. We should
  be wary, therefore, what persecution we raise against the living labours of
  public men, how spill that seasoned life of man, preserved and stored up in
  books; since we see a kind of homicide may thus be committed; sometimes a
  kind of martyrdom; and if it extended to the whole impression, a kind of
  massacre, whereof the execution ends not in the slaying of an elemental life,
  but strikes at that ethereal and soft essence, the breath of reason itself;
  slays an immortality rather than a life....</p>

  <p class="quote">"Wholesome meats to a vitiated stomach differ little or
  nothing from unwholesome; and best books to a naughty mind are not
  unapplicable to occasions of evil. Bad meats will scarce breed good
  nourishment in the healthiest concoction; but herein the difference is of bad
  books, that they to a discreet and judicious reader serve in many respects to
  discover, to confute, to forewarn and to illustrate.... Good and evil, we
  know, in the field of this world, grow up together almost inseparably; and
  the knowledge of good is so involved and interwoven with the knowledge of
  evil, and in so many cunning resmblances hardly to be discerned, that those
  confused seeds which were imposed upon Psyche as an incessant labour to cull
  out and sort asunder, were not more intermixed....</p>

  <p class="quote">"Lords and Commons of England! consider what nation it is
  whereof ye are, and whereof ye are the governors; a nation not slow and dull,
  but of a quick, ingenious and piercing spirit; acute to invent, subtile and
  sinewy to discourse, not beneath the reach of any point that human capacity
  can soar to....</p>

  <p class="quote">"Though all the winds of doctrine were let loose to play
  upon the earth, so Truth be in the field, we do injuriously, by licensing and
  prohibiting, to misdoubt her strength. Let her and falsehood grapple; who
  ever knew Truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter?..."</p>

  <p>That was written nearly three centuries ago. Yet still the obedient Roman
  Catholic wears his blinkers and the Nazis celebrated their accession to power
  ten years ago by a great burning of books.</p>

  <p>About eighty years before Milton was born, a new wave of zealotry, the
  development of the Jesuit organisation, the "Society of Jesus", had occurred
  in Spain and marked a further stage in the moral deterioration of the dying
  yet obstinately aggressive Roman Church.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">XV. &mdash; THE JESUITS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE founder of the Jesuits was a tough and gallant young
  Spaniard named Inigo Lopez de Recalde of Loyola. Loyola was his place of
  origin and there, until his vow of poverty, .he had an estate. He was clever
  and dexterous and inspired by a passion for pluck, hardihood and rather showy
  glory. His love affairs were frequent, free and picturesque. In 1521 the
  French took the town of Pampeluna, in Spain, from the Emperor Charles V, and
  Ignatius was one of the defenders. His legs were smashed by a cannon ball,
  and he ws taken prisoner. One leg was badly set and had to be broken again,
  and these painful and complex operations nearly cost him his life. He
  received the last sacraments. In the night, thereafter, he began to mend, and
  presently he was convalescent but facing the prospect of a life in which he
  would perhaps always be a cripple.</p>

  <p>His thoughts turned to the adventure of religion. Sometimes he would think
  of a certain great lady, and how, in spite of his broken state, he might yet
  win her admiration by some amazing deed; and sometimes he would think of
  being in some especial and personal way the Knight of Christ. In the midst of
  these confusions, one night as he lay awake, he tells us, a new great lady
  claimed his attention; he had a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary carrying
  the Infant Christ in her arms. "lmmediately a loating seized him for the
  former deeds of his life." He resolved to give up all further thoughts of
  earthly women, and to lead a life of absolute chastity and devotion to the
  Mother of God. He projected great pilgrimages and a monastic life.</p>

  <p>His method of taking his vows marks him the countryman of Don Quixote. He
  had regained his strength, and he was riding out into the world rather
  aimlessly, a penniless soldier of fortune with little but his arms and the
  mule on which he rode when he fell in with a Moor. They went on together and
  talked and presently disputed about religion. The Moor was the
  better-educated man; he had the best of the argument, he said offensive
  things about the Virgin Mary that were difficult to answer, and parted
  triumphantly. The young Knight of Our Lady was boiling with shame and
  indignation. He hesitated whether he should go after the Moor and kill him or
  pursue the pilgrimage he had in mind. At a fork in the road he left things to
  his mule, which spared the Moor.</p>

  <p>He came to the Benedictine Abbey of Montserrat near Manresa, and here he
  imitated that peerless hero of medireval romance, Amadis de Gaul, and kept an
  all-night vigil before the Altar of the Blessed Virgin. He presented his mule
  to the abbey, he gave his worldly clothes to a beggar, laid his sword and
  dagger upon the altar, and clothed himself in a rough sackcloth garment and
  hempen shoes. He then took him to a neighbouring hospice and give himself up
  to scourgings and austerities. For a whole week he fasted absolutely. Thence
  he went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.</p>

  <p>For some years he wandered, consumed with the idea of founding a new order
  of religious knighthood, but not knowing how to set about the enterprise. He
  enlisted other enthusiasts, but like himself they were zealous and indignant
  young men. At first they even lacked a priest in the company who could
  officiate for them. Loyola became more and more aware of his own illiteracy,
  and the Inquisition, which was beginning to take an interest in his
  proceedings, forbade him to attempt to teach others until he had spent at
  least four years in study. It seems to have been very doubtful about him.</p>

  <p>His idea was essentially an idea of a fighting company; the Church, he
  realised, was now carrying on a defensive war and needed a fighting force
  which would fight with the unquestioning obedience of disciplined soldiers
  and with an the methods of strategy, surprise and camouflage that
  belligerence involves. Everywhere there was doubt and challenge. A Moor could
  talk openly in Spain. Luther had burnt a papal bull of excommunication a year
  or so before. It never entered into Loyola's head that there might be an
  adequate reason for these denials and repudiation. If such a thought had come
  to him he would have rejected it with horror. The world was in rebellion
  against the Faith, and that rebellion has to be stamped out by every means in
  his power.</p>

  <p>Just as for soldiers of the old type the Army is everything, so in the new
  fighting force the society had to be everything; blind uncritical obedience
  to orders was the Society's first law, it was a complete surrender of
  individual thought and judgment, an entire abandonment of freedom. In a
  letter to his followers at Coimbra he declared that the general of the order
  stands in the place of God, without reference to his personal wisdom, piety
  or discretion; that any obedience which falls short of making the superior's
  will one's own, in inward affection as well as in outward effect, is lax and
  imperfect; that going beyond the letter of command, even in things abstractly
  good and ptaiseworthy, is disobedience, and that the "sacrifice of the
  intellect" is the third and greatest grade of obedience, well pleasing to
  God, when the inferior not only wills what the superior wills, but thinks
  what he thinks, submitting to his judgment, so far as it is possible for the
  will to influence and lead.</p>

  <p>The formula of the final Jesuit vow, after a series of preparatory stages
  extending over years, runs as follows: "I promise to Almighty God, before His
  Virgin Mother and the whole heavenly host, and to all standing by; and to
  thee, Reverend Father General of the Society of Jesus, holding the place of
  God, and to thy successors, Perpetual Poverty, Chastity and Obedience; and
  according to it a peculiar care in the education of boys according to the
  form contained in the Apostolic Letters of the Society of Jesus and in its
  Constitution."</p>

  <p>Ignatius himself laid down thy role that an inferior was bound to make all
  necessary representations to his superior so as to guide him in imposing a
  precept of obedience. When a superior knows the views, of his inferior and
  still commands, it is because he is aware of other sides of the question
  which appear of greater importance than those that the inferior has brought
  forward. The Jesuits were to find their principal work in the world and in
  direct and immediate contact with mankind. To seek spiritual perfection in
  retired life of contemplation and prayer did not seem to Ignatius to be the
  best way of reforming the evils which had brought about the revolt from Rome.
  He with drew his followers from this sort of retirement, except as a mere
  temporary preparation for later activity; he made habitual intercourse with
  the world a prime duty; and to this end he rigidly suppressed all such
  external peculiarities of dress or rule as tended to put obstacles in the way
  of his followers acting freely as emissaries, agents or missionaries in the
  most various places and circumstances. The Jesuit had no home; the whole
  world was his parish. Mobility and cosmopolitanism were of the very essence
  of the Society.</p>

  <p>Their work had to be propaganda; teaching and the insinuation by every
  possible means of the authority and policy of the Church. Their teaching work
  was indisputably good for the times. As the Encyclopaedia Britannica puts it:
  "At a time when primary or even secondary education had in most places become
  a mere effete and pedantic adherence to obsolete methods, they were bold
  enough to innovate, both in system and, material. They not merely taught and
  catechised in a new, fresh and attractive manner, besides establishing free
  schools of good quality, but provided new school books for their pupils which
  were an enormous advance on those they found in use; so that for nearly three
  centuries the Jesuits were accounted the best schoolmasters in Europe, as
  they confessedly were in France until their forcible suppression in 1901.
  Francis Bacon succinctly gives his opinion of the Jesuit teaching in these
  words: 'As for the pedagogical part, the shortest rule would be, Consult the
  schools of the Jesuits; for nothing better has been put in practice.' <i>De
  Aug mentis</i>, vi. 4.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Again, when most of the continental clergy had sunk more or
  less, into the moral and intellectual slough which is pictured for us in the
  writings of Erasmus and the <i>Epistolae obscurorum virorum</i> the Jesuits
  won back respect for the clerical calling by their personal culture and the
  unimpeachable purity of their lives. These qualities they have carefully
  maintained; and probably no large body of men in the world has kept up, on
  the whole, an equally high average of intelligene an conduct... It is in the
  mission field, however, that their achievements have been most remarkable.
  Whether toiling among the teemmg millions in Hindustan and China, labouring
  among the Hurons and Iroquois of North America, governing and civilising the
  natives of Brazil and Paraguay in the missions and 'reductions', or
  ministering, at the hourly risk of his life, to his feIlow Catholics in
  England under Elizabeth and the Stuarts, the Jesuit appears alike devoted,
  indefatigable, cheerful and worthy of hearty admiration and respect."</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for the world the Jesuits have never been able to keep clear
  of politics. It was against their written professions, if these are, to be
  taken seriously, but it was manifestly among their inevitable temptations.
  They had their share, direct or indirect, in embroiling states, concocting
  conspiracies and kindling wars. They had a large share in fanning the flames
  of political hatred against the Huguenots under the last two Valois kings;
  they plotted obstinately against England in thereign of Elizabeth; their
  share in the Thirty Years' War and in the religious miseries of Bohemia is
  indisputable. Their influence in the revocation of the Edict of Nantes and
  the expulsion of the Protestants from France is manifest. The ruin of the
  Stuart cause under James II, and the establishment of the Protestant
  succession was due largely to their clumsy meddling. In a number of cases
  where the evidence against them is defective, it is at least an unfortunate
  coincidence that there is always direct proof of some Jesuit having been in
  communication with the actual agents engaged.</p>

  <p>Gradually the reputation of the Jesuit as a dangerous zealot with an
  inordinate appetite for power increased. In France the Jesuits joined if they
  did not originate the league against Henry of Navarre; absolution was refused
  by them to those who would not join in the Guise rebellion. The assassination
  of Henry III in the interests of the league and the wounding of Henry IV in
  1594 by Chastel, a pupil of theirs, revealed the quality of their
  disposition. In England the political schemings of Parsons were no small
  factors in the odium which fell on the Society at large; and his
  determination to capture the English Catholics as an appanage of the Society
  was an object lesson to the rest of Europe of a restless ambition and lust of
  domination which were to find many imitators. A general congregation of the
  Society in 1594 passed a decree forbidding its members to participate in
  public affairs; a decree there was evidently no disposition to enforce.
  Parsons was allowed to keep on with his work, and other Jesuits in France for
  many years directed affairs of state. In 1605 took place in England the
  Gunpowder Plot, in which Henry Garnet, the supenor of the Society in England,
  was implicated. That the</p>

  <p>Jesuits were the direct instigators of the plot there is no evidence but
  they were in close touch with the conspirators, of whose designs Garnet had a
  general knowledge. There is now no reasonable doubt that he and other Jesuits
  were legally accessories, and that the condemnation of Garnet as a traitor
  was substantially just.</p>

  <p>Their hostility to the Huguenots forced on the Revocation of the Edict of
  Nantes in 1685, and their war against their Jansenist opponents did not cease
  till the very walls of Port Royal were demolished in 1710, even to tbe very
  abbey church itself, and the bodies of the dead taken with every mark of
  insult from their graves and literally flung to the dogs to devour. Their
  Japanese mission vanished in blood in 1651; and though many Jesuits died with
  their converts bravely as martyrs for the Faith, it is impossible to acquit
  them of extreme political provocation.</p>

  <p>We need not expand this, indictment further. Almost every country in
  Europe except England had at one time or another been provoked to expel the
  Jesuits, and, as we shall show presently, their obdurate persistence in evil-
  doing continues to this day. They are to-day the most active front of the
  Roman Catholic residuum.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">XVI. &mdash; THE CONTINUAL SHRINKAGE OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC
     CHURCH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR it is now only a residuum. The number of practising
  Roman Catholics is enormously exaggerated. Steadily throughout this black
  record of its aggressive intolerance, the Roman Catholic Church has exuded
  and persecuted vitality and contracted into the actively malignant and still
  dwindling body it is to-day. Joseph McCabe has made a vigorous examination of
  its numerical claims.</p>

  <p>McCabe is one of the most able and interesting and learned of all anti-
  Catholic writers, and, like all the most thorough-going reformers in the
  past, he sprang from the bosom of the Church. He began life with a soundly
  Roman Catholic up-bringing; he was born in 1867. he was a Franciscan monk at
  sixteen, a priest at twenty-three, Professor of Scholastic Philosophy for
  four years, and then Rector of Buckingham College. His clerical tide, which
  he has ceased to use, is the Very Reverend Father Antony. He broke away from
  the Church in 1896 and he married three years later. One might describe him
  as the ultimate Protestant, that is to say he has no scrap of religious
  belief left in him; he has long since realised that whatever Being may
  sustain this universe it can have nothing in common with the vain and
  vindictive Bogy which priestcraft has elaborated to scare and subjugate
  mankind. He writes with an erudition and an amount of knowledge that put him
  by himself as the most capable critic the papal system has ever had. I shall
  venture to cite his extremely disrespectful account of a Roman Conclave later
  in this chapter. But first I will avail myself of a little tract of his on
  the Black International (Second Series, No. 13), to sustain my statement of
  the shrinkage of the Roman remnant of Christendom.</p>

  <p>The number of Roman Catholics in the world claimed by Catholic
  authorities, he points out, varies astonishingly. A Catholic expert in the
  new Encyclopaedia Americana gives 294,583,000, the (British) Catholic
  Directory gives 398,277,000. "Every priest," says McCabet "makes an annual
  report to his bishops&mdash;I have assisted in this job&mdash;and these
  reports provide national totals which are forwarded to Rome. Two things,
  amongst others, are reported: how many Catholics in the loose
  sense&mdash;i.e. baptised persons&mdash;there are in the parish and,
  particularly, how many of them are real Catholics as testified by attendance
  at Church on Sundays and the number of confessions at Easter. But neither
  local prelates nor the Vatican ever publish these results. The nearest
  approach to an official international annual is Orbis Catholicus, and it
  gives no world-total; though if you add up the statements for each country
  the total runs to about 350,000,000.</p>

  <p>"The sum-total is usually compiled by an entirely dishonest method, but
  even professors of sociology who include the Churches as socially valuable
  agencies never condemn this. Countries which, from geographical or historical
  conditions, never accepted tbe Reformation are still called Catholic
  countries, and the whole population is usually included in the Catholic total
  or only from 1 to 5 per cent. is allowed for Protestants, Jews,
  and&mdash;though they generally form the largest body&mdash;sceptics. These
  countries (France and its colonies, Italy, Spain and its former colonies,
  Portugal and its colonies Spanish America, and generally Austria) with a
  total population of more than 200,000,000 make the bulk of the Catholic
  figure. For other countnes the figures are equally fantastic. The Catholic
  writer in the Encyclopaedia Americana gives 11,000,000 to Russia where no
  Catholic claims more than 3,000,000 and there are now certainly not 300,000;
  39,000,000 to Austria and Hungary, which have had for a quarter of a century
  a total (mixed) population of only 15,000,000: 24,000,000 to Germany where
  the Church is in ruins: 35,000,000 to France; which is at least five times
  too much.</p>

  <p>"In examining these figures we must clearly undersstand the conditions.
  What is a Catholic or a member of the Roman Church? The Canon Law is simple
  and peremptory: everybody who once received Catholic baptism' (McCabe, inter
  alia!). "American Catholic writers are uneasy about this arrogant theory of
  their Church that you cannot secede from it, and they are shifty and evasive
  in defining what they mean when they claim that there are more than
  20,000,000 Catholics in the United States. In a fantastic&mdash;Catholics
  call it a scientific&mdash; work, Has the Immigrant Kept the Faith? (1925),
  Fr. G. Shaugnessy says that by Catholic he means one who has received
  Catholic baptism, marries in the Church and has his children baptised, and at
  death receives the last sacraments. He at once admits that the third
  condition is 'rather theoretical'&mdash;he is perfectly aware that it is not
  taken into account&mdash; and he ought to know, and probably does know, that
  Irish, Italian and other Catholics commonly marry in the Church and allow the
  mothers or relatives to have&mdash; the children baptised though they have
  definitely abandoned it, From questions given in Moore's Will America become
  Catholic? (1931) it appears that in Catholic periodicals Fr. Shaugnessy, a
  professor at a Catholic college, is accustomed to give the usual definition
  of a Catholic: one who was baptised in infancy. This is the strict law of the
  Church, and it is the guiding principle of the priests who compile the
  parochial statistics from which the national and world-totals are
  compiled."</p>

  <p>I will not go on with McCabe's contemptuous analysis. He emerges with a
  possible maximum of 180 million Catholics, including a large proportion of
  children (50 millions) and illiterates, probably 100 millions, in the whole
  world population of 2,000 millions. The Pope, he says, certainly has not more
  than 50 million subjects upon this planet who can write their own names. And
  all over the world where statistics are still available, the number of
  Catholic criminals and prostitutes is out of all proportion to their numbers
  in the general population.</p>

  <p>The Very Reverend Father Antony writes with a ruthless confidence in his
  knowledge that I cannot emulate.</p>

  <p class="quote">"His well-known <i>History of the Popes</i> (Watts &amp;
  Co., 1939) is a classic which every student of religious history must study,
  but when it comes to controversy a certain restraint falls from him, and so,
  since I wish to make this book as unaggressive as possible, I will quote only
  one other of his more controversial (Black International Tracts, Second
  Series, No. 11)."</p>

  <p class="quote">"Three times," says he, "since 1900, the voters have put at
  the head of their Church (a world-wide business with an income of hundreds of
  millions of dollars a year at its central office alone) a man who would have
  failed to run a $3,000 store. I have just read fifteen Catholic
  books&mdash;British, French, Italian and German&mdash;on them and I ought to
  know them....</p>

  <p class="quote">"Let us consider the Papal election (Conclave) in itself...
  . The theory you probably know. Sixty or seventy cardinals elect the Pope.
  They are locked and carpentered in a special part of the Vatican palace,
  where each now has a suite of rooms&mdash;in the old days when they were all
  locked in a chapel day and night for weeks the odour was not one of
  sanctity&mdash;until one of the rival candidates gets two-thirds of the
  votes. There is much praying to the Holy Ghost for guidance, but they still
  have to be locked in and watched lest they also consult profane persons
  outside....</p>

  <p class="quote">"In practice the Conclave is much more human than the
  theory. Ever since the Church of Rome became rich in the fourth century there
  has been a spirited struggle for the control of the treasury. As early as 366
  more than 160 of the supporters of the rival candidates had to be buried, and
  as late as 1492 the 'butcher's bill' was more than 200. The struggle is now
  more refined; though when the Pope says his first Mass he still has nobles at
  hand to take the first sip of the wine and see that it has not been
  poisoned.</p>

  <p class="quote">"A feverish intrigue warms Rome before a Pope's death.
  Broadly there are two schools of cardinals: the 'zealots'&mdash;think of the
  hairy hill-men of Kentucky who roar out the hymn 'Old-Fashioned Religion'-and
  the 'politicals' or practical men. There are generally four or five cardinals
  who fancy their chances and carry the bets of the Romans, and they canvass
  the voters of the rival schools and let it be known that they are grateful to
  supporters. Each party selects one champion, and they enter the Conclave with
  the Holy Ghost on their lips and the name of a candidate in their pockets...
  .</p>

  <p class="quote">"They pray and talk for an hour or two and then take a vote
  (written). The two favourites are bound to have; perhaps, a third of the
  votes each, and the nibbling at each other's parties and the neutrals begins.
  There is still generally a deadlock and they turn to the string of 'also
  ran'. A few colourless outsiders are tried until one gets the two-thirds
  vote. He is generally advanced in age or an invalid, so that the struggle may
  be resumed in a few years. The lucky man who at last gets the required
  majority murmurs 'I am not worthy' and&mdash;because a Pope was once taken
  seriously when he said this&mdash;makes for the pontifical robes, which are
  waiting (in three sizes). Then they take him out on the balcony to show to
  the public. The historical record of these Conclaves by Petrucelli, della
  Gattina beats the history of Tammany for clean fun.</p>

  <p class="quote">"An Italian Catholic priest, G. Berthelet (<i>Storia e
  Rivilazioni sul Conclave</i>, 1904) says of the election of the 'great' Leo
  XIII:</p>

  <p class="quote">"'If Pius IX had foreseen the election of Leo XIII he would
  have excommunicated him, but if Leo XIII had foreseen that at his death the
  cardinals would vote for Giuseppe Sarto, he would have excommunicated the lot
  of them.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"Sarto, Archbishop of Venice, was a good old man of peasant
  origin. His sister kept the village pub. He loved to talk broad Venetian with
  a countryman and shock the more starchy cardinals. But what else could the
  poor voters do? For years Cardinal Rampolla, the ablest of them, a lean
  black- visaged lynx-eyed schemer like the present Pope, had worked for the
  position. The candidate of the zealots was Gatti... As that very sober and
  weighty French newspaper <i>Le Temps</i> said in its account of this
  Conclave: 'The Holy Ghost was clearly making for the French candidate
  (Rampolla) but the Triplice (Triple Alliance) headed him off....'</p>

  <p>Such is the "Catholic atmosphere" in Rome to-day, and such is the present
  phase of the disintegration of the Christendom of our ancestors. Even in
  comparison with Fascism and the Nazi adventure Roman Catholicism is a broken
  and utterly desperate thing, capable only of malignant mischief in our
  awakening world. The Pope is now only the head of about fifty millions of
  semi- literates scattered about the planet, trailing after them a blind
  entirely ignorant multitude of "Faithful"; a following of ignorant men, women
  and children that does not exceed at the outside 120 millions all told.</p>

  <p>With that the Pope sets himself to hold back and frustrate the secular
  modernisation of the world.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">XVII. &mdash; THE STRUGGLE FOR BRITAIN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE scheme of this analysis of Roman Catholicism would be
  incomplete without a few notes to remind the reader of the curious conflict
  that has been waged from the Reformation onward by the Roman Catholic Church
  in order to recover its ascendancy over Britain.</p>

  <p>None of the British mixture of peoples 'can be described as passionately
  religious. None of them indeed seem to be passionate in any respect. They
  have as little liking and sympathy for the <i>crime passionel</i> as they
  have for the wild-eyed devotee in a manifest hair shirt. One can write a sort
  of cento of their pet phrases. Their weakness and their greatest danger at
  the present time is their disposition to be "reasonable' to let bygones be
  bygones, not to cry over spilt milk, to live and let live, and believe that
  all other people in the world have a similarly reasonable equable
  temperament. They will fight for points, "play the game", and they have to be
  smacked good and hard and spat upon and generally insulted before they can be
  induced to fight all out. They are rather pleased to lose every battle but
  the last, "muddle through" and then make a "good humoured" settlement that
  loses the peace. They are bad allies for weaker peoples because of these
  trustful settlements they will make. Leave them alone, don't rouse them, and
  you may steal the keys of the safe. Many Englishmen think it is bad form to
  count their change, and they detest cash registers. But when they realise
  they have been cheated and have got something they didn't bargain for, they
  may explode dangerously.</p>

  <p>Maybe it is the Gulf Stream or something geographical that makes them like
  this, maybe it is the fact that living, so to speak, at the end of Europe, so
  that for centuries, until America came into the world, every sort o.f man
  came to England and nobody wet away, they are o so mixed a strain that they
  believe nothing decidedly. Compromise and lack of emphasis is in their
  nature.</p>

  <p>If I wanted to brag about the English people; if I were briefed for that
  purpose and had no way of evading so uncongenial a task, I should certainly
  associate this disposition to indifference in religious and social dogmas
  with the very exceptional share they have had in the inspiration and early
  organisation of scientific research.</p>

  <p>They are disposed to put a note of interrogation to every positive
  assertion, because they have a profound sense of the present imperfections of
  language and every sort of symbol and statement. They feel that things may be
  so to a certain extent and yet not quite so. They realise that our minds are
  at their best extremely imperfect implements. Continually we seem to be
  approaching truth, but every actuality we conquer opens up fresh questions.
  This approach to truth goes on unendingly, and every generation has its
  achievements and its fresh stimulus to further growth. That is not simply the
  disposition of the scientifically trained Englishman; it corresponds to
  something like an instinct in the common sort of people. They detest all
  precise and binding and conclusive statement; they feel something wrong about
  it, and they despise dogmatic enthusiasm. They invented the word "humbug" and
  they are far less patriotic than the naturalised alien. When they are
  vigorous they are insubordinate and derisive, and when they are devitalised
  they are apathetic and unconvinced.</p>

  <p>Equable. So the British are now and so they have always been. I have noted
  how England became Protestant. Would she have remained Catholic but for Anne
  Boleyn? That is not so certain. Protestantism leaves' them at their ease in
  many ways, but, as we have seen throughout this study, the Papacy has never
  been able to refrain from provocation. It has never let Anglo-Saxons sleep.
  By its very nature it has to encroach until some sort of explosion
  occurs..</p>

  <p>We have given a brief account of heresies in Chapter IV. The British have
  never started an aggressive heresy. But they have resented being pushed
  about. They have jeered at and criticised the pretensions of the Church, they
  have questioned and questioned that, destructively, but they have never begun
  the struggle. The Church made a dogma of Transubstantiation.</p>

  <p>Wycliffe put a query against it that split the Church in twain, but he
  remained in the Church to his death. The majority of the Canterbury Pilgrims,
  as we have noted in Chapter XIIIa, are easy-going mockers. You cannot tell
  whether that composite person, Shakespeare, was a Catholic or a Protestant
  or, like his Macbeth, an out-and-out atheist. All three went to the making of
  him. The official English Reformation ended in that remarkable compromise,
  the Established Church and the Thirty-nine Articles, which was just Catholic
  enough to give the Papacy and the Jesuits hope for quiet reinstatement. Then,
  just as the handcuffs were on again and the gag nearly fixed, came the
  inevitable awakening and explosion.</p>

  <p>The history of England since the Reformation could be written as a
  recurrent and generally combined attack of the Roman Catholic Church and the
  totalitarian state (of which perhaps Hobbes' Leviathan is the completest
  expression and the Divine Right of Kings the political claim) upon the
  common- sense agnosticism and individualism of the English people. Always it
  is the same story of a renewed assault, apparent success and then
  explosion.</p>

  <p>In the phase of Puritanism that followed the passing of the Elizabethans
  we find the English in an unsuspicious phase, leading the lives they were
  disposed to live, and feeling no threat to their way of life. In J. R.
  Green's <i>Short History of the English People</i>, we find a portrait sketch
  of Colonel Hutchinson, one of, the Regicides, which I will quote with a few
  abridgments.</p>

  <p class="quote">"With the close of the Elizabethan age, indeed, the
  intellectual freedom which had marked it faded insensibly away: the bold
  philosophical speculations which Sidney had caught from Bruno, and which had
  brought on Marlowe and Raleigh the charge of atheism, died, like her own
  religious indifference, with the Queen. But the lighter and more elegant
  sides of the Elizabethan culture harmonised well enough with the temper of
  the Puritan gentleman.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The figure of Colonel Hutchinson, one of the Regicides,
  stands out from his wife's canvas with the grace and coding of a portrait by
  Vandyck. She dwells on the personal beauty which distinguished his youth, on
  'his teeth even and white as the purest ivory', 'his hair of brown, very
  thickset in his youth, softer than the finest silk, cuding with great loose
  rings at the ends.' Serious as was his temper in graver matters, the young
  squire of Owthorpe was fond of hawking, and piqued himself on his skill in
  dancing and. fence. His artistic taste showed itself in a critical love of
  painting, sculpture and all liberal arts' as well as in the pleasure he took
  in his gardens, in planting groves and walks and forest trees.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"His life was orderly and methodical, sparing of diet and of
  self- indulgence; he rose early, he never was at any time idle, and hated to
  see anyone else so'. The new sobriety and self-restraint marked itself even
  in his change of dress. The gorgeous colours and Jewels of the Renascence
  disappeared. Colonel Hutchinson 'left off very early the wearing of anything
  that was costly, yet in his plainest negligent habit appeared very much a
  gentleman'.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The loss of colour and variety in life was compensated by
  solid gains. Greatest among these was the new conception of social equality.
  Their common brotherhood in Christ annihilated that overpowering sense of
  social distinctions which characterised the age of Elizabeth. The proudest
  noble recognised a spiritual equality in the poorest 'saint'. It was felt
  even more in the new dignity and self-respect with which the consciousness of
  their 'calling' invested the classes beneath the rank of the gentry....</p>

  <p class="quote">"It is in a Puritan of the middle class that we find the
  fullest and noblest expression of the new influence which was leavening the
  temper of the time. John Milton is not only the highest, but the completest
  type of Puritanism. He was born when it began to exercise a direct power over
  English politics and English religion; he died when its effort to mould them
  into its own shape was over, and it had sunk again into one of the many
  influences to which we owe our English character. His earlier verse, the
  pamphlets of his riper years, the epics of his age, mark with a singular
  precision three great stages in his history. His youth shows that much of the
  gaiety, the poetic ease, the intellectual culture of the Renascence lingered
  in a Puritan home. Scrivener and 'precisian' as his father was, he was a
  skilled musician; and the boy inherited his father's skill on lute and
  organ....</p>

  <p class="quote">"In spite of the war between playwright and precisian, a
  Puritan youth in Milton's days could still avow his love of the stage, 'if
  Jonson's learned sock be on, or sweetest ,Shakespeare, Fancy's child, warble
  his native woodnotes wild'. He could gather from the 'masques and antique
  pageantry' of the courtrevel hints for his own Comus and Arcades. Nor does
  any shadow of the coming struggle against the Church disturb the young
  scholar's reverie, as he wanders beneath 'the high embowed roof, with antique
  pillars massy proof, and storied windows richly dight, casting a dim
  religious light', or as he hears 'the pealing organ blow to the full-voiced
  choir below, in service high and anthem clear'. His enjoyment of the gaiety
  of life stands in bright contrast with the gloom and sternness which strife
  and persecution fostered in the later Puritanism. In spite of what he
  described as 'a certain reservedness of natural disposition' which shrank
  from 'festivities and jests, in which I acknowledge my faculty to be very
  slight the young singer could still enjoy the 'jest and youthful jollity' of
  the world around him, its 'quips and cranks and wanton wiles'; he could look
  pleasantly on 'at the village fair, 'where the jocund rebecks sound to many a
  youth and many a maid, dancing in the chequered shade.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"There was nothing ascetic in his look, in his slender,
  vigorous frame, his face full of a delicate yet serious beauty, the rich
  brown hair which clustered over his brow.... He drank in an ideal chivalry
  from Spenser, but his religion and purity disdained the outer pledge on which
  chivalry built up its fabric of honour. 'Every free and gentle spirit,' said
  Milton, 'without that oath, ought to be a knight'. It was with this temper
  that he passed from his London school, St. Paul's, to Christ's College at
  Cambridge, and it was this temper that he preserved throughout his University
  career."</p>

  <p>But we have already drawn very generously upon Milton in this book. Even
  before the death of Queen Elizabeth Papal aggression was already provoking
  anger in the country.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Single-handed, unsupported by any of the statesmen or
  divines about her, the Queen had forced on the warring religions a sort of
  armed truce. The main principles of the Reformation were accepted, but the
  zeal of the ultra- reformers was held at bay. The Bible was left open,
  private discussion was unrestrained, but the warfare of pulpit against pulpit
  was silenced by the licensing of preachers. Outer conformity, attendance at
  the common prayer, was exacted from all; but the changes in ritual, by which
  the zealots of Geneva gave prominence to the radical features of the
  religious change which was passing over the country, were resisted. While
  England was struggling for existence, this balanced attitude of the Crown
  reflected faithfully enough the balanced attitude of the nation; but with the
  declaration of war by the Papacy in the Bull of Deposition the movement in
  favour of a more pronounced Protestantism gathered a new strength. Unhappily
  the Queen clung obstinately to her system of compromise, weakened and broken
  as it was. With the religious enthusiasm which was growing up around her she
  had no sympathy whatever. Her passion was for moderation, her aim was simply
  civil order; and both order and moderation were threatened by the knot of
  clerical bigots who gathered under the banner of Presbyterianism. Bigotry was
  rousing counter- bigotry. Of these bigots of the left Thomas Cartwright was
  the chief. He had studied at Geneva; he returned with a fanatical faith in
  Calvinism, and in the system of Church government which Calvin had devised;
  and as Margaret Professor of Divinity at Cambridge he used to the full the
  opportunities which his chair gave him of propagating his opinions. No leader
  of a religious party ever deserved less of after sympathy than Cartwright. He
  was unquestionably learned and devout, but his disposition was that of a
  mediaeval inquisitor. The relics of the old ritual, the cross in baptism, the
  surplice, the giving of a ring in marriage, were to him not merely
  distasteful, as they were to the Puritans at large, they were idolatrous and
  the mark of the beast."</p>

  <p>Cartwright cut no ice, as the saying goes, with the English people. The
  spirit of Calvinistic Presbyterianism excluded all toleration of practice or
  belief.</p>

  <p>As Milton, most modern-spirited of Protestants, put it:</p>

  <p class="quote">"New Presbyter is but Old Priest writ large."</p>

  <p class="quote">"To the ordinary English Protestant," says J. R. Green, "no
  innovation in faith or worship was of small account, if it tended in the
  direction of Rome. The peril was too great to admit of tolerance or
  moderation....</p>

  <p class="quote">"We see the Puritan temper already in the Millenary Petition
  (as it was called), which was presented to James the First on his accession
  by some eight hundred clergymen, about one-tenth of the whole number in his
  realm. It asked for no change in the government or organisation of the
  Church, but for a reform of its courts, the removal of superstitious usages
  from the Book of Common Prayer, the disuse of lessons from the apocryphal
  books of Scripture, a more rigorous observance of Sundays, and the provision
  and training of preaching ministers. Even statesmen who had little sympathy
  with the religious spirit about them pleaded for the purchase of religious
  and national union by ecclesiastical reforms. 'Why,' asked Francis Bacon,
  'should the civil state be purged and restored by good and wholesome laws
  made every three years in Parliament assembled, devising remedies as fast as
  time breedeth mischief, and contrariwise the ecclesiastical state still
  continue upon the dregs of time, and receive no alteration these forty-five
  years or more?' A general expectation, in fact, prevailed that, now the
  Queen's opposition was removed, something would be done. Unhappily her
  successor proved equally resolute against all changes in Church matters.</p>

  <p class="quote">"No sovereign could have jarred more utterly against the
  conception of an English ruler which had grown up under Plantagenet or Tudor
  than James the First. His big head, his slobbering tongue, his quilted
  clothes, his rickety legs, stood out in as grotesque a contrast with all that
  men recalled of Henry or Elizabeth as his rhodomontade, as his want of
  personal dignity, his buffoonery, his coarseness of speech, his pedantry and
  cowardice. Underneath this ridiculous exterior, however, lay much natural
  ability, a scholar with a considerable fund of shrewdness, mother-wit and
  ready repartee. His reading, especially in theological matters, was
  extensive; and he was a voluminous author on subjects which ranged from
  predestination to tobacco. But his shrewdness and learning only left him, in
  the phrase of Henry the Fourth, 'the wisest fool in Christendom'. He had the
  temper of a pedant, a pedant's conceit, a pedant's love of theories, and a
  pedant's inability to bring his theories into any relation with actual facts.
  All might have gone well had he confined himself to speculations about
  witchcraft, about predestination, about the noxiousness of smoking.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Unhappily for England and for his successor, he clung yet
  more passionately to theories of government which contained within them the
  seeds of a death-struggle between his people and the Crown. Even before his
  accession to the English throne, he had formulated his theory of rule in a
  work on The True Law of Free Monarchy; and announced that, 'although a good
  King will frame his actions to be according to law, yet he is not bound
  thereto, but of his own will and for example-giving to his subjects'. With
  the Tudor statesmen who used the phrase, 'an absolute King' or 'an absolute
  Monarchy' meant a sovereign or rule complete in themselves, and independent
  of all foreign or Papal interference. James chose to regard the words as
  implying the monarch's freedom from all control by law or from responsibility
  to anything but his own royal will.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The King's theory was soon as the Divine Right of Kings to
  become a doctrine which bishops preached from the pulpit Convocation in its
  book of Canons denounced as a fatal error the assertion that 'all civil
  power, jurisdiction and authority were first derived from the people and
  disordered multitude and either is originally still in them or else is
  deduced by their consent naturally from them; and is not God's ordinance
  originally descending upon Him and depending upon Him'.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Cowell, a civilian followed up the discoveries of
  Convocation by an announcement that 'the King is above the law by his
  absolute power, and that 'notwithstanding his oath he may alter and suspend
  any particular law that seemeth hurtful to the public estate'. The book was
  suppressed on the remonstrance of the House of Commons, but the party of
  passive obedience grew fast. A few years before the death of James; the
  University of Oxford decreed solemnly that 'it was in no case lawful for
  subjects to make use of force against their princes, or to appear offensively
  or defensively in the field against them.' 'As it is atheism and blasphemy to
  dispute what God can do' said James in a speech delivered in the Star
  Chamber, 'so it is presumption and a high contempt in a subject to dispute
  what a King can do, or to say that a King cannot do this or that.'"</p>

  <p>Among the King's most ardent supporters and intellectual associates was
  John Donne the poet who began his career as an amorist of the most brilliant
  type and commemorated it in deathless verse fell deeply in love, eloped and
  became a faithful husband had twelve annual children of whom he buried five
  and when his wife died under the strain devoted himself to ill-health and his
  poetical gift. The King found Donne's erudition greater than his own and his
  belief in Divine Right very sustaining. James persuaded him to take Holy
  Orders which he had hitherto declined, and made him Dean of St. Paul's, the
  first of a long series of distinguished Deans. Whether Donne preferred his
  Majesty to his Maker is by no means clear. Donne killed himself when in the
  worst of health by insisting upon making his personal attendance upon his
  Royal Master and preaching this customary Lenten sermon.</p>

  <p>The peculiar temperamental perversion that handed over Donne's worshipful
  monarch to a series of youthful male "favourites", of which the Duke of
  Buckingham was the chief, and the attempts to marry the Prince of Wales to a
  Spanish Catholic Princess, intensified the general uneasiness. There is no
  need to detail the "romantic" visit of Buckingham and Prince Charles to
  Madrid. That adventure ended in failure. The return of the Prince "was the
  signal for a burst of national joy. All London was alight with bonfires, in
  her joy at the failure of the Spanish match, and of the collapse, humiliating
  as it was, of the policy which had so long trailed English honour at the
  chariotwheels of Spain."</p>

  <p>There followed an understanding with France and the marriage of Charles I
  (who had succeeded to the throne) to Henrietta, the sister of the French
  King.</p>

  <p class="quote">"It was suspected, and suspicion was soon to be changed into
  certainty, that in spite of his pledge to make no religious concessions,
  Charles had promised on his marriage to relax the penal laws against
  Catholics, and that a foreign power had again been given the right of
  intermeddling in the civil affairs of the realm. It was men with Catholic
  leanings whom Charles seemed disposed to favour. Bishop Laud was recognised
  as the centre of that varied opposition to Puritanism, whose members were
  loosely grouped under the name of Arminians; and Laud became the King's
  adviser in ecclesiastical matters. With Laud at its head the new party grew
  in boldness as well as numbers. It naturally sought shelter for its religious
  opinions by exalting the power of the Crown. A court favourite, Montague,
  ventured to slight the Reformed Churches of the continent in favour of the
  Church of Rome, and to advocate as the faith of the Church the very doctrines
  rejected by the Calvinists. The temper of the Commons on religious matters
  was clear to every observer. 'Whatever mention does break forth of the fears
  or dangers in religion, and the increase of Popery,' wrote a member who was
  noting the proceedings of the House, 'their affections are much
  stirred.'"</p>

  <p>Buckingham was murdered in 1628, amidst regrettable rejoicings on the part
  of the London mob, Laud became Bishop of London in the same year, and the
  Puritan emigration which laid the foundation of New England became an
  organised movement. (The <i>Mayflower</i> had sailed from Holland in
  1620.)</p>

  <p>All through the reign of Charles I, the encroachments of monarchical
  absolutism and of both Roman and Anglican Catholicism continued, and at every
  challenge the hostility of the mass of English people to these encroachments
  was manifest. When, after the failure of a reactionary Army Plot Charles I,
  to save his own skin, betrayed his chief supporter, Strafford the whole
  country rejoiced.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Strafford died as he had lived. His friends warned him of
  the vast multitude gathered before the Tower to witness his fall. 'I know how
  to look death in the face, and the people too,' he answered proudly. 'I thank
  God I am no more afraid of death, but as cheerfully put off my doublet at
  this time as ever I did when I went to bed.' As the axe fell, the silence of
  the great multitude was broken by a universal shout of joy. The streets
  blazed with bonfires. The bells clashed out from every steeple. 'Many,' says
  an observer, 'that came to town to see the execution rode in triumph back,
  waving their hats, and with all expressions of joy through every town they
  went, crying "His head is off! His head is off!"'"</p>

  <p>Strafford had prepared an army to support the King in Ireland. Now that
  army was headless.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The disbanded soldiers he had raised spread over the
  country, and stirred the smouldering disaffection into a flame. A conspiracy,
  organised with wonderful power and secrecy, burst forth in Ulster, where the
  confiscation of the Settlement had never been forgiven, and spread like
  wildfire over the centre and west of the island. Dublin was saved by a mere
  chance. In the open country the work of murder went on unchecked. Thousands
  of English people perished, and rumour doubled and trebled the number. Tales
  of horror and outrage came day after day over the Irish Channel. Sworn
  depositions told how husbands were cut to pieces in presence of their wives,
  their children's brains dashed out before their faces, their daughters
  brutally violated and driven out naked to perish frozen in the woods.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Some,' says May, 'were burned on set purpose, others
  drowned for sport or pastime, and if they swam kept from landing with poles,
  or shot, or murdered in the water many were buried quick, and some set into
  the earth breast-high ,and there left to famish.' The revolt was unlike any
  earlier rising in its religious character. No longer was it a struggle, as of
  old, of Celt against Saxon, but of Catholic against Protestant. The Papists
  within the Pale joined hands in it with the wilderness outside the
  Pale...."</p>

  <p>So the story runs on. The Civil War was fought to a finish and Charles
  being a shameless cheat and lIar was finally beheaded for a hitherto
  unheard-of crime, treason to the people. Then came the Restoration and a
  phase of uncertain loyalty until fresh Jesuit activities roused the popular
  distrust again. There was a real plot, but also there was a bogus plot
  invented by a scoundrel, Titus Oates. This "Popish Plot", mingling reality
  and imagination, produced the usual response from the populace. It became
  manifest that James, Duke of York, the King's brother and successor, was
  involved in a projected restoration of the papal rule in England.</p>

  <p>Never had the French alliance seemed so full of danger to English
  irreligion. Europe had long been trembling at the ambition of Louis XIV; it
  was trembling now at his bigotry. He declared war at this moment upon
  religious freedom by revoking the Edict of Nantes, the measure by which Henry
  the Fourth after his abandonment of Protestantism secured toleration and the
  free exercise of their worship for his Protestant subjects. It had been
  respected by Richelieu even in his victory over the Huguenots, and only
  lightly tampered with by Mazarin. But from the beginning of his reign. Louis
  had resolved to set aside its provisions, and his revocation of it in 1685
  was only the natural close of a progressive system of persecution. The
  Revocation was followed by outrages more cruel than even the bloodshed of
  Alva. Dragoons were quartered on Protestant families and given the utmost
  freedom of outrage, women were flung from their sick-beds into the streets,
  children were torn from their mothers' arms to be brought up in Catholicism,
  ministers were sent to the galleys.</p>

  <p>In spite of the royal edicts, which forbade emigration to the victims of
  these horrible atrocities, a hundred thousand Protestants fled over the
  borders, and Holland, Switzerland, the Palatinate, were filled with French
  exiles. Thousands found refuge in England, and their industry founded in the
  fields east of London the silk trade of Spitalfields. But while the English
  people beheld these events with horror, James drew from them new hopes. In
  defiance of the law, he filled fresh regiments with Catholic officers. He met
  the Parliament with a haughty declaration that whether legal or no his grant
  of commissions to Catholics must not be questioned, and with a demand for
  supplies for his new troops. Loyal as was the temper of the Houses, their
  alarm for the Reformed Religion and their dread of a standing army was yet
  stronger than their loyalty. The Commons, by a majority of a single vote,
  deferred the grant of supplies until grievances were redressed, and demanded
  in I their address the recall of the illegal commissions. The Lords took a
  bolder tone; and the protest of the bishops against any infringement of the
  Test Act was backed by the eloquence of Halifax. Both Houses were at once
  prorogued. An ambassador, the Earl of Castlemaine, was sent to implore the
  Pope's blessing on these proceedings.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Catholics were admitted into civil and military offices
  without stint, and four Catholic peers were sworn as members of the Privy
  Council. The laws which forbade the presence of Catholic priests in the
  realm, or the open exercise of Catholic worship, were set at nought. A
  gorgeous chapel was opened in the palace of St. James for the use of the
  King. Carmelites, Benedictines, Franciscans appeared in their religious garb
  in the streets of London, and the Jesuits set up a crowded school in the
  Savoy."</p>

  <p>The manifest popular "discontent at these acts would have startled a wiser
  man into prudence, but James prided himself on an obstinacy which never gave
  way; and a riot which took place on the opening of a fresh Catholic chapel in
  the City was followed by the establishment of a camp of thirteen thousand men
  at Hounslow to overawe the capital.</p>

  <p class="quote">"James clung to the hope of finding a compliant Parliament,
  from which he might win a repeal of the Test Act. In face of the dogged
  opposition of the country the elections had been adjourned; and a renewed
  Declaration of Indulgence was intended as an appeal to the nation at large.
  At its close he promised to summon a Parliament in November, and he called on
  the electors to choose such members as would bring to a successful end the
  policy he had begun. It was in this character of a royal appeal that he
  ordered every clergyman to read the declaration during divine service on two
  successive Sundays. Little time was given for deliberation, but little time
  was needed. The clergy refused almost to a man to be the instruments of their
  own humiliation. The Declaration was read in only four of the London
  churches, and in these the congregation flocked out of church at the first
  words of it. Nearly all of the country clergy refused to obey the royal
  orders. The Bishops went with the rest of the clergy.</p>

  <p class="quote">"A few days before the appointed Sunday Archbishop Sancroft
  called his suffragans together, and the six who were able to appear at
  Lambeth signed a temperate protest to the King, in which they declined to
  publish an illegal DeclaratIon. 'It is a standard of rebellion,' James
  exclaimed as the Primate presented the paper; and the resistance of the
  clergy was no sooner announced to him than he determined to wreak his
  vengeance on the prelates who had signed the protest. He ordered the
  Ecclesiastical Commissioners to deprive them of their sees, but in this
  matter even the Commissioners shrank from obeying him. The Chancellor, Lord
  Jeffreys, advised a prosecution for libel as an easier mode of punishment;
  and the bishops, who refused to give bail, were committed on this charge to
  the Tower. They passed to their prison amidst the shouts of a great
  multitude, the sentinels knelt for their blessing as they entered its gates,
  and the soldiers of the garrison drank their healths. So threatening was the
  temper of the nation that his ministers pressed James to give way. But his
  obstinacy grew with the danger. 'Indulgence,' he said, 'ruined my father';
  and on the 29th of June the bishops appeared as criminals at the bar of the
  King's Bench. The jury had been packed, the judges were mere tools of the
  Crown, but judges and jury were alike overawed by the indignation of the
  people at large. No sooner had the foreman of the jury uttered the words 'Not
  guilty' than a roar of applause burst from the crowd, and horsemen spurred
  along every road to carry over the country the news of the acquittal."</p>

  <p>The last militant act of King James as the skies blackened over him was to
  bring over drafts from the Catholic army Tyrconnell had raised for him. This
  produced among other things one of the best marching tunes in the British
  Army, "Lilliburlero". It was immensely popular. It was sung throughout the
  country. The tune is said to have been based upon an old Irish lullaby, but
  the words seem to have been put together in a pretended Irish brogue by
  Thomas Lord Wharton, and the air was made into what it still is, the most
  savagely thunderous and popular of British marching tunes, by no less a
  composer than Henry Purcell. He published and fathered it as a "New Irish
  Tune" in 1689 in his <i>Music's Handmaid</i>.</p>

  <p>There are endless versions of the words. People improvised and altered as
  it passed like a wind through the country. The general burthen ran very much
  after this fashion:</p>

  <pre style="margin-left:20%; font-family:Georgia: font-style:italic">
"Ho! brother Teague, do you hear the decree?
  Lilliburlero, bullen a-la,
That we are to have a new Deputy,
  Lilliburlero, bullen a-la.
  Lero lero, lilliburlero, lero, lero, bullen a-la.

Ho! by Saint Tyburn, it is the Talbot;
  Lilliburlero, bullen a-la.
And he shall cut the Englishman's throat.
  Lilliburlero, bullen a-la.
  Lero lero, lilliiburlero, lero, lero, bullen a-la.

"Though by my soul the English do prate,
The law's on their side and Christ knows what.

"But if dispensation shall come from the Pope,
We'll hang Magna Carta and them in a rope...

"All in France have taken a swear
That they will have no Protestant heir...
</pre>

  <p>(This easily became "No Protestants there".)</p>

  <pre style="margin-left:20%; font-family:Georgia; font-style:italic">
"There was an old prophecy found in a bog
That we shall be ruled by an ass and a dog."
</pre>

  <p>("Dog" was Wharton's word, but the popular voice speedily changed it to
  "hog".)</p>


  <pre style="margin-left:20%; font-family:Georgia; font-style:italic">
"And now is this prophecy coming to pass,
       (Overwhelming Crescendo.)
For Talbot's the hog and James is the ass."
</pre>

  <p>Fantastically bitter doggerel, put it released the accumulating resentment
  of the country at the threatened return of Roman Catholic domination.</p>

  <p>Thereafter came the "Glorious Revolution", which ultimately established
  the Protestant succession in England, confirmed the exclusion of Roman
  Catholics from the universities and public office, and relaxed the suspicions
  of the general public. The danger was felt to be over. The habitual torpor of
  the English mind in the face of theology supervened.</p>

  <p>So far I have been following Green's <i>Short History of the English
  People</i>. But now I have to resort to other authorities. The name of Lord
  George Gordon and the story of the "No Popery" riots of 1780 came back to me,
  and I searched Green in vain. I turned up my copy of <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>.
  Dickens caricatures the whole affair. To him they are shameful riots,
  "begotten of intolerance and persecution". "However imperfectly," he writes,
  "those disturbances are set forth in the following pages, they are
  impartially painted by one who has no sympathy with the Romish Church, though
  he acknowledges, as most men do, some esteemed friends among the followers of
  its creed."</p>

  <p>Crabbe saw these riots which J. R. Green ignores and describes them in his
  Journal to his beloved "Mira", that is to say Sally Elmy, who later on became
  his wife. The mob, he says, was a mixture of very various elements. "Quiet
  and decent" he describes it at Westminster, but the storming of the keeper's
  house at the Old Bailey and the jail delivery of convicted felons evidently
  frightened him. They released all the debtors also, and Newgate was an open
  house for all to come and go. A formidable contingent of criminals from the
  slums started burning and looting. "About ten or twelve of the mob getting to
  the top of the debtors' prison, whilst it was burning, to halloo, they
  appeared rolled in black smoke mixed with sudden bursts of fire&mdash; like
  Milton's infernals, who were as familiar with flame as with each other. On
  comparing notes with my neighbours, I find I saw but a small part of the
  mischief. They say Lord Mansfield's house is now in flames."</p>

  <p>But J. R. Green has not a word to say about these troubles. Like Dickens,
  he was saturated with the amiable liberalism of the Gladstonian phase in
  English thought. The leopard had changed its spots and everything was
  different.</p>

  <p>Manifestly these excellent liberals thought that Popery had ceased to be a
  danger to the liberties of the English people. I suggest that in this matter
  the instincts of that eighteenth-century London crowd were sounder than his
  uncritical toleration.</p>

  <p>The Oxford Counter Revolution is best dealt with by James Anthony Froude,
  in a study under that title, and in his <i>Nemesis of Faith</i>. His
  <i>History of England from the Fall of Wolsey to the Defeat of the Spanish
  Armada</i> is also, by the by, a frank and vivid piece of history from the
  Protestant point of view. The reader will find only a hostile appreciation of
  him in Mr. Garvin's lamentable <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> manifestly
  written by a Roman Catholic who remains characteristically and discreetly
  anonymous. A timely appreciation by A. L. Rowse in the <i>New Statesman</i>
  of March 20th, 1943, sweeps away these insinuations.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Of all the great Victorians Froude, it seems to me, is the
  writer least estimated at his proper worth and most worth while reviving.
  There is so much in him that should appeal to our age; in many ways he had
  more affinities with the twentieth century than with the nineteenth: the
  strain of scepticism in him for one thing, the historian's relativism that
  made him see all religions as myths and men's philosophies as
  rationalisations of their interests and desires... And what a magnificent
  writer; what a stylist! So infinitely better than Carlyle, to whom he
  deferred, like the rest of the I am not so sure that in addition to writing
  better, he had not more to Carlyle had. Give me Froude every time: a better
  historian, a better writer, a more sceptical, a more subtle,
  intelligence...</p>

  <p class="quote">"He was read. He held people's attention. He had admirers if
  few defenders and no followers. He was a lonely figure, at the same time as
  he was much sought after, and a distinguished person in society....</p>

  <p class="quote">"... his troubles began with his first books, and persisted
  to the last. The Nemesis of Faith is chiefly known for having been publicly
  burnt by the Sub-Rector of his college at Oxford when Froude was a young
  Fellow. It is deserving of attention on more serious grounds and for its own
  sake. Its subject is the ferment of thought about the foundations of faith
  stirred up by the Oxford Movement, the dilemma of belief which was such a
  critical issue to sensitive minds in the mid-nineteenth century and
  especially to those brought up in a clerical environment like Froude, whose
  livelihood and career were involved in it."</p>

  <p>I have been watching the current "effort to subjugate this easy-going,
  profoundly sceptical country to the Roman Catholic Church with a lively
  interest. The process has been systematic and impudent to the point of
  incredibility. I only realise how much has been attempted now that it is past
  its climax. In the same way one did not realise the gravity of the Blitzkrieg
  until the climax was past. There has been a Catholic Blitzkrieg upon Britain
  during the immense stresses of the war. The one remaining vestige of
  Protestant England has been the Protestant Succession. By releasing the Crown
  from that Protestant oathand that might easily have been arranged in the name
  of "freedom of worship"&mdash;that last obstacle would have been removed.</p>

  <p>For four war years Great Britain officially has been behaving like a
  Catholic country determined to emerge from a deplorable past. The Rev.
  So-and-So, S.J., and the Very Venerable So-and-So, S.J., have had a
  disproportionately large share of our broadcasting time. Non-Christian voices
  have been relatively inaudible although the great majority of peoples in the
  British Empire do not profess to be Christians.</p>

  <p>The teaching of the Roman Catholic Church puts the Faith before any other
  social or political consideration, and the Roman Catholics in any country and
  under any form of government constitute an essentially alien body. The over-
  confident liberalism of the early nineteenth century enfranchised this body
  of outlanders, believing it would in some mysterious manner play the game of
  mutual toleration which seemed so natural to the essentially sceptical and
  secular liberal mentality. Nothing of the sort ensued. Steadily,
  persistently, the Catholic Church has worked for the destruction of that very
  liberalism which restored it to political influence. Persecuting relentlessly
  where it was in the ascendant, and canting about individual liberty of
  conscience wherever it was faced by a modern organisation of society, this
  mental cancer has spread itself back to destroy the health and hope of our
  modern world.</p>

  <p>There is something in this Roman Catholic business that sends me back to
  Coleridge's <i>Christabel</i>. The reader may remember how a mysterious
  maiden, Geraldine, came to Christabel and sought her protection, and how
  Christabel sheltered her in spite of a series of creepy intimations that all
  was not right with the visitant.</p>

  <pre style="margin-left:20%; font-family:Georgia; font-style:italic">
"And Geraldine...
Softly gathering up her train,
That o'er her right arm fell again;
And folded her arms across her chest,
And couched her head upon her breast;
And looked askance at Christabel&mdash;
Jesu, Maria, shield her well!

"A snake's dull eye blinks dull and shy;
And the lady's eyes they shrunk in her head,
Each shrunk up to a serpent's eye,
And with something of malice, and more of dread,
At Christabel she looked askance!&mdash;
One moment&mdash;and the sight was fled!
But Christabel in dizzy trance
Stumbling on the unsteady ground..."

"Again she saw that bosom old,
Again she felt that bosom cold..."
</pre>

  <p>As this present world war goes on, and even if there is some sort of
  temporary half peace before it degene1fates into a tangle of minor wars, it
  will become plainer and plainer that it is no longer a geographically
  determined warfare of governments, nations and peoples, but the world-wide
  struggle of our species of release itself from the strangling octopus of
  Catholic Christianity. Everywhere the Church extends its tentacles and fights
  to prolong the Martyrdom of Man. Through St. Cyr and de Gaullism it assails
  the fine liberal tradition of France; it dominates the policy of the British
  War Office and Foreign Office, and through these the B.B.C. and the press; by
  a disciplined Catholic vote, a casting vote in endless elections and a
  sustained organisation of menace and boycott, it silences the frank
  discussion of its influence in America. It works counter both to the old
  nationalisms that broke away from it at the Reformation and to the emergence
  of a scientifically guided world commonweal from the initial experiment of
  Russian communism. Like an octopus it has no creative impulse but only an
  instinct to survive. In Ireland, Spain, Italy, reactionary France, North and
  South America, Japan, and wherever it can stretch a tentacle, it seeks allies
  in every element that is socially base that will help it to continue its
  struggle against the awakening liberalism of the "United Democracies", as "it
  is our hopeful custom to call them.</p>

  <p>Here are extracts from an article by Katharine Hayden Salter, in the
  (American) <i>Churchman</i> of January 15th, 1943.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The October 5th (1942) issue of a Toledo newspaper carried
  the following statement as a news item:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Monsignor Sheen, associate professor of philosophy in
  Catholic University, Washington, D.C., and director of the Catholic Hour
  radio programme, spoke on <i>The Crisis of Christendom</i>, in a meeting
  sponsored by the Mary Manse Alumnae Association. He said:</p>

  <p class="quote">"'<i>We are living at the end of an era, ushered in by the
  Protestant Revolt 400 years ago&mdash;a revolt that denied authority, so that
  as a result we have been living without God, we have tossed Him out of His
  own world.</i>' Monsignor Sheen called the war a judgment on the way man has
  lived, and said that victory will be ours only on condition that we
  repent.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Simon and Schuster have recently brought out a book, <i>The
  Catholic Pattern</i> by Thomas Woodlock. It is built around exactly the same
  thesis&mdash;that the cause of this war is the Reformation, the 'Revolt' the
  'metaphysical heresy' of having left the Catholic Church. 'It is an assault
  on the entire Protestant wor1d; and it insists that the Declaration of
  Independence itself (written by Thomas Jefferson, a deist and 'heretic' if
  ever there was one, so far as Catholic dogma is concerned) was engendered by
  the Catholic Pattern....</p>

  <p class="quote">"In the February 11th, 1928, issue of <i>America</i>, an
  important Jesuit publication, Charles J. Mullaly, S.J., states the case
  fully. Let me quote a bit from it. Father Mullaly describes in detail the
  workings of a Catholic boycott, thought up by his fellow Jesuits of an
  earlier day and carried through, in 1913, in Washington, D.C., when a
  newspaper tried to investigate conditions in a Catholic home for wayward
  girls. He describes the total boycott, dutifully carried through by the laity
  and clergy, without a hitch&mdash; save one object of Catholic scorn&mdash;'a
  weak-kneed Catholic advertiser who declared that he did not believe in mixing
  business and religion!' Then Father Mullaly proudly says: 'The forty per
  cent. loss of circulation now meant also a forty per cent. fall in the rates
  for advertising'.... The 'slogan was sounding through Washington, "Do not buy
  any paper that insults the Catholic religion, and do not buy from any store
  that advertises in such a paper." The lesson was a lasting one.'...</p>

  <p class="quote">"'History often repeats itself. Since some secular magazines
  and newspapers now believe, as this Washington editor believed in 1913, that
  it pays to insult the Catholic Church and to foster religious controversy,
  why cannot Catholics in every city let the history of this counter-attack
  repeat itself for them? They fan follow the example of the Catholics in
  Washington, in 1913....</p>

  <p class="quote">"'The lessons learned in Washington in 1913 may briefly be
  summed up as follows:</p>

  <p class="quote">"'1. Do not attack a magazine or newspaper through its
  editorial departments but act through its business office.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'2. When a magazine or newspaper is attacking your
  religion, write to the business manager and inform him that you will not buy
  the offending periodical again, and mean it....</p>

  <p class="quote">"'If Catholics follow the example of the Catholics in
  Washington in 1913, we shall soon decisively answer the question which the
  editors of some secular periodicals are now asking themselves: DOES IT PAY TO
  INSULT CATHOLICS?'"</p>

  <p>That is the language and technique of this last Catholic offensive. Are
  decent Protestants to emulate this foul fighting, are we to demand of our
  grocer and bookseller whether he is a Catholic and boycott him if he is, or
  would it not be better to restore the alien status of the whole organisation?
  Plainly the moral for us to-day is the moral of Chaucer's sailor six long
  centuries ago. "Invite no more monks to your house or inn."</p>

  <p>To propitiate the Roman Catholic organisation with political office or
  power is like establishing friendly relations with an area sneak by handing
  him the family silver.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; SHINTO CATHOLICISM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">POPE PIUS XII, the open enemy of everything creative and
  reconstructive in the world, was first educated in the Gregorian University
  and Roman Seminary, figured professorially in the Academy of Noble
  Ecclesiastics, was Archbishop of Sardes, 1917, when he tried to persuade the
  Kaiser to make a moderate peace, developed his political ideas as Papal
  Nuncia in Bavaria and Germany, and so forth. Having tied himself irrevocably
  to the Axis, he had to accept, and he accepted all too readily, the
  assimilation for mutual assistance of Shintoism and Catholicism.</p>

  <p>How far that assimilation has gone let this passage from Professor Karl
  Adam's <i>The Spirit of Catholicism</i> bear witness.</p>

  <p class="quote">"We Catholics," says this. authoritative exponent of Roman
  Catholic orthodoxy, "acknowledge readily, without any shame, nay with pride,
  that Catholicism cannot be identified simply and wholly with primitive
  Christianity, nor even with the Gospel of Christ, in the same way that the
  great oak cannot be identified with the tiny acorn. There is no mechanical
  identity, but an organic identity. And we go further and say that thousands
  of years hence Catholicism will probably be even richer, more luxuriant, more
  manifold in dogma, morals, law and worship, than the Catholicism of the
  present day. A religious historian of the fifth millennium A.D. will without
  difficulty discover in Catholicism conceptions and forms and practices which
  will drive from India, China and Japan, and he will have to recognise a far
  more obvious 'complex of opposites'. It is quite true, Catholicism is a union
  of contraries. But 'contraries are not contradictions'... The Gospel of
  Christ would have been no living gospel, and the seed which He scattered no
  living seed, if it had remained ever the tiny seed of A.D. 33, and not struck
  root, and had not assimilated foreign matter, and had not by the help of this
  foreign matter grown up into a tree, so that the birds of the air dwell in
  its branches."</p>

  <p>It is interesting to consider these "conceptions, forms and practices"
  that the Roman Catholic Church, as Professor Karl Adam expounds it, is now
  incorporating.</p>

  <p>Mr. A. Morgan Young has recently published an admirable summary of them
  (<i>The Rise of a Pagan State</i>, 1939). He gives his sources for whatever
  statements he makes, so that the interested reader can get his book and
  verify and expand what is stated here.</p>

  <p>The basis of Shinto is the Kojiki, a compilation of the eighth century
  A.D. It is readable in its entirety only by scholars, its language being far
  more remote from the Japanese of to-day than eighth-century Anglo-Saxon would
  be from current English. For various reasons only portions of it have been
  modernised for general use. It begins with a sort of storm of gods neither
  made nor begotten but passing away. From this tumult emerge two highly sexual
  figures, Izanagi and Izanami, who might be described in Hollywood language as
  male and female "sex appeal". They respond to each other with tremendous
  vigour, begetting gods and islands and at last a Fire God who burns up his
  mother Izanami. But by this time Izanagi is so set on procreation that
  everything about him procreates; he throws off his clothes and they become
  sea gods and land gods. Finally he produces the Sun Goddess from his left
  eye, the Moon God from his right eye and the headlong Susa-no-o by blowing
  his nose. After which he seems to have retired and the Sun Goddess and
  Susa-no-o occupy the stage.</p>

  <p>After various remarkable adventures, no doubt of the greatest spiritual
  significance and full of lessons for the true believer, Susa-no-o meets a
  formidable damsel-devouring dragon with eight heads and other alarming
  accessories, intoxicates the beast with saki, kills it and cuts it up. But
  one of the tails resists and breaks his sword, because a better sword is
  hidden in it. This he presents to his sister the Sun Goddess. It lies to-day,
  thickly swathed in brocade, in the Family Shrine of the Imperial House in
  Tokyo. It is one of the Three Sacred Treasures, the sword, the mirror and the
  jewel, which the Sun Goddess transmitted to the divine Emperors, the living
  Gods of Japan.</p>

  <p>To the Catholic mind, accustomed to a widely different system of myths and
  absurdities, this reads like monstrous nonsense. It is wiser not to say that
  in Japan. For example, Dr. Inoue Tetsujiro, a loyal but liberal-minded
  Shintoist ventured to doubt the, authenticity of the Three Sacred Treasures.
  He was denounced, his publisher penalised, and he was expelled from the
  Imperial University. Later on, while attending the memorial service of a
  friend, he was set upon by a gang of pious ruffians and beaten so that one
  eye was destroyed. No one was punished for this outrage, which indeed is only
  one sample among many of the spirit of renascent Shintoism. It is quite good
  form to jump at a man who uses a phrase or makes a gesture that seems lacking
  in piety, and stab him. It is like those fierce old colonels in England who
  assault people for not standing stiff to "God Save the King". It is the very
  spirit of the Trinitarians at Nicaea.</p>

  <p>The great assimilation prophesied by Professor Karl Adam has already
  begun. The crude early Christians, still in the "acorn" phase, preferred
  martyrdom to burning a pinch of incense to the Roman God-Emperors, but the
  Roman Catholic Church of to-day has already established friendly relations
  with the Shinto faith, and the Japanese Catholic bows in the Shinto temples
  in acquiescence to the local supremacy of the Emperor-Divinity over the
  Vatican.</p>

  <p>There will be no Roman Catholic Church at all in the fifth millennium
  A.D., or it would be amusing to speculate how the successors of Professor
  Karl Adam, long before then, would have plaited into the Trinity that God of
  Male Sex Appeal from whose left eye sprang the Sun Goddess, while he blew
  Susa-no-o, the dragon-slaying Susa-no-o, from his nose.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">XIX. &mdash; ROMAN CATHOLICISM IN AMERICA</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SUCH is Catholicism as it is understood by Pope Pacelli and
  Japan. But the spirit of Roman Catholicism as one finds it in America is very
  different from that. Roman Catholics in America are influential because of
  their solid vote at elections, but for all that the American Roman Catholic
  does not like to hear&mdash;and to the best of his ability will not
  hear&mdash;of the Vatican-Japanese alliance. If he is one of the well-trained
  faithful he just pretends it isn't there. And we may counterbalance some of
  what has gone before by a word or so from a much saner type of Roman
  Catholic, Mr. Joseph Dinneen, who recently wrote, and wrote very ably, an
  account of this Axis pontiff from the standpoint of an American
  journalist.</p>

  <p>His frontispiece is a portrait of Pope Pacelli, under which we read these
  singular words: "Bishop of Rome, Patriarch of the West, Supreme Pontiff of
  the Universal Church." I do not know how far Mr. Dinneen endorses this
  inscription. But in his Preface he tells very disarmingly of how it struck
  him when he learnt that Pius X was an inveterate cigar smoker and he realised
  that "Popes are human". He says:</p>

  <p class="quote">"The doctrine of infallibility always puzzles my Protestant
  friends. The answer to the question on this in the Catholic catechism is:
  'The Church teaches infallibly when it speaks through the Pope and the
  bishops, united in general council, or through the Pope alone when he
  proclaims to the faithful a doctrine of faith or morals.' Like a good many
  other Catholics, I have often been told by smug friends that my intellect is
  necessarily limited and bounded by my obedience to the Pope, and I shrug my
  shoulders and turn away, because I realise no amount of argument can convince
  them that I can be happy in my religion, believe in its tenets and teachings
  implicitly, and still think for myself in matters temporal; that the foreign
  policy of the Secretary of State at the Vatican, for instance, is a temporal
  matter, and I can disagree with the position of the Church in Spain, and
  still be a good Catholic and receive the sacraments."</p>

  <p>That is good, plain American Catholicism. And there is not a word of truth
  in it. It is out of date. It is almost pre-Reformation stuff. It should be
  distinguished as Old Catholicism. It is not. the Catholicism of an ever more
  desperately aggressive Papacy....</p>

  <p>For many men who were once good Catholics, the doctrine of infallibility
  was a turning-point.</p>

  <p>On matters of Church history Dr. G. G. Coulton is a patient, unrelenting,
  trustworthy guide, and no one interested in the fatal concentration of power
  in the hands of the Pope since 1870 should fail to read him: In his book,
  <i>Papal Infallibility</i> (1932), he shows how such historical authorities
  as Lord Acton for example were driven into open opposition by that dogma.
  Acton was himself a Catholic, the one outstanding historian the Church can
  claim in modern times, yet he wrote of this doctrine with sorrowful prophetic
  insight: "Erected originally as an impregnable fortress against advancing
  liberalism it seems more likely now to prove an ineluctable death-trap. ' For
  the moment, indeed, it might have seemed to justify the Roman Church
  completely in all her actions; but now, more and more clearly, we see that
  she needs to summon up all the memories of her past prestige, and all the
  resources of her elaborate bureaucracy, and all her disciplinary severity, in
  order to put a colourable face upon this doctrine, so strange both from the
  historical and from the philosophical point of view."</p>

  <p>Here is a more emphatic statement from the same source. Lord Acton is
  writing to the Catholic historian Lady Blennerhasset:</p>

  <p>"The accomplices of the Old Man of the Mountains (the classic assassins of
  history) picked off individual victims, but the Papacy contrived murder and
  massacre on the largest and also on the most cruel and inhuman scale. They
  were not only wholesale assassins, but they also made the principle of
  assassination a law of the Christian Church and a condition of salvation"
  (Selections from the Correspondence of the First Lord Acton, 1917, Vol. i, p.
  55).</p>

  <p>From 1820 to 1860 at least 300,000 unarmed men, women and even children
  died in massacres, on the scaffold, or in pestilential jails for claiming
  what we now consider human rights.</p>

  <p>"The more Catholic the country, indeed, the more savage were the torture
  and bloodshed. The Kingdom of the Sicilies (Italy and Sicily) witnessed the
  longest and vilest reaction. General Coletta claims that there were 200,000
  victims from 1790 to 1830 and his Neapolitan successor claims 250,000 in the
  next thirty ears; and as late as 1860 the brutality of the oppression shocked
  all Europe. These figures are uncertain, since it is very difficult to
  compile them, and in the case of Italy they include a percentage of armed
  rebels, but after a severe enquiry I find that at least 300,000 men and women
  and children perished in Italy, Spain and Portugal. In the Pope's own
  kingdom, with a population of about 3,000,000, many thousands died by
  execution, in massacres, or in jails of an incredibly cruel character. The
  savagery of the clerical-royalists and the foul character of most of the
  monarchs are described in the <i>Cambridge Modern History</i> and all
  authoritative manuals....</p>

  <p class="quote">"One other point must be made. The social order which was
  protected by this brutality was as inefficient as it was unjust, and it was
  at its worst in the Pope's own States. On this all authorities are agreed.
  Lady Blennerhasset approvingly quotes in the <i>Cambridge Modern History</i>
  (x, 164) the reflection of Father Lamennais, on visiting Rome, that it was
  'the most hideous sewer that ever offended the eye of man'." (<i>A History of
  the Popes</i>, by Joseph McCabe. Watts, London, 1939.)</p>

  <p>Dinneen tells a delightful anecdote of the American Cardinal Gibbons
  returning from the election of Pius XI. He was asked&mdash;manifestly by an
  American&mdash;what he thought of papal infallibility. He reflected. "Well,"
  he said, with a twinkle, "he called me Jibbons."</p>

  <p>Very plainly American Catholicism is bound to inflict some uncomfortable
  gymnastics on our Berlin-Rome-Tokyo Pontiff. We godless people carry on our
  intellectual warfare for converts and subsidies against the Catholicism of
  Dinneen, but I, for one, doubt very greatly whether in his heart Dinneen's
  distrust of Pius XII varies very widely from mine.</p>

  <p>Now in the face of the military alliance and dependence of the "United
  Nations" upon the magnificent morale of the Russian and Chinese peoples, we
  have this Axis Pope clamouring for a bitter conflict against something
  "Unchristian" called "Bolshevisation", which will destroy every decent thing
  in existence, superiors and inferiors, the family&mdash;the Catholics are
  always very great on the family&mdash;and dividends.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">XX. &mdash; THE UNITED CHRISTIAN FRONT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BEFORE me as I write is a very interesting document. It
  opens up the grave question for all who profess themselves Christians, to
  consider exactly what, in the face of that document, they mean by that
  profession. It was published in 1938, and it is headed United Christian
  Front. The chairman of this United</p>

  <p>Christian Front is that Captain Archibald Ramsay who, with Mosley, was
  interned on the outbreak of the war. His Vice-Chairman and Treasurer was the
  late Sir Henry Lunn, a sound Tory, who, like sir Samuel Hoare, believed that
  the adventurer Franco was "a Christian gentleman"..</p>

  <p>Another member of this United Christian Front was&mdash;or is for I do not
  know how far it still exists as an active body&mdash;that steadfast defender
  of his investments against the quite imaginary excessive proliferation of the
  non-investing classes, Dean Inge. I dealt with his peculiarities in a little
  Penguin book, <i>The Commonsense of War and Peace</i>, and Inge has never
  replied to my challenge. But here is Sir Henry Lunn defending the Dean
  against the Bishop of Chelmsford for quoting him as saying: "one-quarter of
  the priests and nuns in Spain have been murdered, some of them after horrid
  torture". The Bishop, it seems, had written that this was not so, and had
  quoted the Vatican <i>Osservatore Romano</i>, which could hardly be regarded
  as an anti-Catholic publication, for claiming only 6,000, out of Dean Inge's
  quarter of 106,743. But that 6,000, says Sir Henry, refers only to secular
  priests, implying rather than asserting that the Dean was telling the awful
  truth. Poor Sir Henry wasted his subtleties. Back comes the Dean with
  this:</p>

  <p class="quote">"The Bishop of Chelmsford misquotes me as saying that one-
  quarter of the nuns in Spain have been murdered. I said nothing of the kind.
  Many have been killed; but the Bishop's proteges were more often content to
  strip them naked and violate them.</p>

  <p class="quote">"It is really rather horrible to find a Bishop championing
  men who, acing on instructions from Moscow to exterminate the middle class,
  have slaughtered, at a low estimate, 200,000 helpless and harmless people,
  and whose avowed object is to extirpate the Christian faith in the country of
  St. Teresa and St. John of the Cross.</p>

  <p class="quote">"There is abundance of well-documented evidence for those
  minority, I fear, who wish to know the truth."</p>

  <p>No documented evidence was adduced, because no documentary evidence can be
  adduced.</p>

  <p>I will not pillory the odd collection of names that rallied about Captain
  Archibald Ramsay in 1938, for some of them may have come to see the error of
  their ways since that year. The point to note is the intense fear of Moscow
  and the frantic disposition to get together with anyone professing to be
  pro-Christian, even with Franco and his Moslem blackamoors against this
  dreaded new thing in the world. Ramsay, Mosley, Mussolini, Dean Inge, the
  King of Italy, de Gaulle, Pitain (not the gallant French aviator but the old
  man of Vichy), and at the apex of the pyramid this Shinto Catholic Pope, Pius
  XII! What a motley crew it is! United only in one thing, and that is fear and
  hatred of a sane scientific equalitarian order in the world. How far are we
  people of the new order going to let such people waste the new-born hope of
  mankind?</p>

  <p>The latest drive to rally "Believers" is an amalgamation of two
  organisations. Its sole objective, so far as I can find an understandable
  objective, is to drive every honest teacher of history or science out of our
  schools. Then our people's minds can be bunged up with mud thoroughly and
  finally. 'The first and most formidable is a Roman Catholic organisation
  called The Sword of the Spirit. The second is called Religion and Life, and
  it seems to be largely under the sway of Mr. T. S. Eliot. Roman Catholicism
  preserves a strong tradition of cannibalism, and I can give a good guess who
  will live longest on this conjoint raft. It will be amusing to watch its
  gyrations.</p>

  <p>The programme is extremely vague about the relations of the Primate of all
  England and the Primate of England and Cardinal Hinsley and the Moderator of
  the Free Church Federal Council, to the raft and each other. Out of
  consideration for His Holiness, there is no arrangement for beating off
  sharks and the Japanese, who are also, as we have seen, deeply religious
  people. What seems to me a serious practical oversight is that there is no
  provision against poaching. You know these gentlemen will poach. There will
  be suspicions and denunciations.</p>

  <p>I can imagine the scene: the whispering silence of these holy men and then
  a sudden outcry. "Here! whose orphan are you stealing? He comes under my
  grant!" Confusion on the raft and a splash. Commotion among the sharks.</p>

  <p>Unanimity is restored only by the appearance of a drifting biological
  experimental station chock-full of dangerous books about reality and truth.
  If it hits against the raft, it may send the whole crazy accumulation to the
  bottom. "All hands to the sweeps!" For a time after this "Crisis for
  Christianity" the United Christian Front is restored.</p>

  <p>I am deriding organised High Church and Catholic Christianity, and I would
  like to make it plain that in doing so I am not disregarding what I might
  call the necessity of many minds, perhaps most young minds, feel for
  something one can express by such phrases as "the fatherhood of God" and "the
  kingdom of heaven within us". That is the need the Roman Catholic Church
  trades upon and betrays.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">XXI. &mdash; THE PRETENSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF POPE PIUS
     XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">To return to that typical Pope, Pope Pius XII. It is
  necessary to insist upon his profound ignorance and mental inferiority. Most
  of us are still living in the old traditions of society, we honour and obey
  those who are put in authority over us, and it shocks us profoundly to hear
  that kings and ministers and particularly the Roman Catholic hierarchy are
  necessarily much more ignorant than a great and increasing multitude of quite
  common men. But let us consider the peculiar limitations to which these
  priests are subjected. They have been set aside from the common sanity of
  mankind from their youth up.</p>

  <p>In the atmosphere in which Pius XII was educated, what chance had he to
  acquire even the most general ideas about modern biology or modern thought?
  Life is too short for knowledge anyhow, but consider how much of his brief
  candle has guttered to waste.</p>

  <p>Deduct, for example, from his natural allowance of years and days the time
  consumed by the services of the Church. Every day there is a round of
  ceremonies he must perform. How many hours they consume I do not know, but
  they must mean a considerable moiety, and, apart from that, there are the
  priestly duties of the confessional, the arrangements of fasts and festivals.
  They do not leave him much time for extraneous reading. A common British or
  American out-of-work living on the dole and reeding the abundant literature
  of an ordinary public library, can, if he has the curiosity, acquire a
  knowledge of modern biology and modern thought and modern ways of life,
  incomparably greater than the equipment of any Pope who has ever lived. The
  out-of-work has the advantage of a considerable and growing mass of digested
  biological thought and fact upon which scientific enquirers have spent a
  succession of lifetimes&mdash;which he can read without restriction. Even if
  the Pope had been free to read modern scientific literature in such scraps of
  time as were available for that purpose, he would still be a relatively
  ignorant man. But a Catholic priest is not free to read what he likes. His
  reading and thinking are elaborately controlled and rationed. The Church is
  so essentially out of harmony with reality and the truth of things, and is so
  aware of it, that it has had to train its priests from the outset to shut
  their eyes, to close their ears.</p>

  <p>Watch a priest in a public conveyance. He is fighting against disturbing
  suggestions. He must not look at women lest he think of sex. He must not look
  about him, for reality, that is to say the devil, waits to seduce him on
  every hand. You see him muttering his protective incantations, avoiding your
  eye. He is suppressing "sinful" thoughts.</p>

  <p>That type is the binding material of the Church. The appeal of sex is as
  natural to a young male as eating. Its suppression is a defiance of
  everything for which a healthy male exists. So that in the priestly mind we
  deal with something frustrated and secretly resentful, something sexually as
  well as intellectually malignant. And this applies, through all the glamour
  of his vestments, incense and so forth, to the Pope, as to any other member
  of the hierarchy. We are dealing with ideas left over from the Dark Ages, in
  the brains of a being at once puerile, perverted and malignant. Pius XII,
  when we strip him down to reality, showed himself as unreal and ignorant as
  Hitler. Possibly more so. Both have been incoherent and headlong men, whom
  chance has made figure-heads for the undisciplined foolishness of this dying
  age. The mere fact that a man by accident and misdirection can trail a vast
  trace of bloodshed and bitter suffering about the world does not make him any
  the greater or wiser. Before mankind gets rid of it, the Papacy may be
  drowning our hopes for the coming generation in a welter of blood&mdash;in an
  attempt to achieve a final world-wide St. Bartholomew's Eve&mdash;and it will
  not add an inch to his stature nor alter the fact that the Pope, any Pope, is
  necessarily an ill-educated and foolish obstacle, a nucleus of base
  resistance, heir to the tradition of Roman Catholicism in its last stage of
  poisonous decay, in the way to a better order in the world.</p><br>
