  <p class="intro">These are two papers written by Mr. H. G. Wells. The first
  was read to the Fabian Society in October, 1906, under the title of
  "Socialism and the Middle Classes." The second appeared first in the
  <i>Independent Review</i>. Together they state pretty completely the attitude
  of Modem Socialism to family life.</p>

    1906</p>

  <br>

  <p class="first">IN this paper I am anxious to define and discuss the
  relationship between three distinct things:</p>

  <p>(1) Socialism, i.e. a large, a slowly elaborating conception of a sane and
  organized state and moral culture to replace our present chaotic way of
  living,</p>

  <p>(2) the Socialist movement, and</p>

  <p>(3) the Middle Classes.</p>

  <p>The first is to me a very great thing indeed, the form and substance of my
  ideal life, and all the religion I possess. Let me make my confession plain
  and clear. I am, by a sort of predestination, a Socialist. I perceive, I
  cannot help talking and writing about Socialism, and shaping and forwarding
  Socialism, I am one of a succession&mdash;one of a growing multitude of
  witnesses, who will continue. It does not&mdash;in the larger
  sense&mdash;matter how many generations of us must toil and testify. It does
  not matter, except as our individual concern, how individually we succeed or
  fail, what blunders we make, what thwartings we encounter, what follies and
  inadequacies darken our private hopes and level our personal imaginations to
  the dust. We have the light. We know what we are for, and that the light that
  now glimmers so dimly through us must in the end prevail. To us Socialism is
  no piece of political strategy, no economic opposition of class to class; it
  is a plan for the reconstruction of human life, for the replacement of a
  disorder by order, for the making of a state in which mankind shall live
  bravely and beautifully beyond our present imagining.</p>

  <p>So, largely, I conceive of Socialism. But Socialism and the Socialist
  movement are two very different things. The Socialist movement is an item in
  an altogether different scale.</p>

  <p>I must confess that the organized Socialist movement, all the Socialist
  societies and leagues and federations and parties together in England, seem
  to me no more than the rustling hem of the garment of advancing Socialism.
  For some years the whole organized Socialist movement seemed to me so
  unimportant, so irrelevant to that progressive development and realization of
  a great system of ideas which is Socialism, that, like very many other
  Socialists, I did not trouble to connect myself with any section of it. I
  don't believe that the Socialist idea is as yet nearly enough thought out and
  elaborated for very much of it to be realized of set intention now. Socialism
  is still essentially education, is study, is a renewal, a profound change in
  the circle of human thought and motive. The institutions which will express
  this changed circle of thought are important indeed, but with a secondary
  importance. Socialism is the still incomplete, the still sketchy and
  sketchily indicative plan of a new life for the world, a new and better way
  of living, a change of spirit and substance from the narrow selfishness and
  immediacy and cowardly formalism, the chaotic life of individual accident
  that is human life to-day, a life that dooms itself and all of us to
  thwartings and misery. Socialism, therefore, is to be served by thought and
  expression, in art, in literature, in scientific statement and life, in
  discussion and the quickening exercise of propaganda; but the Socialist
  movement, as one finds it, is too often no more than a hasty attempt to
  secure a premature realization of some fragmentary suggestion of this great,
  still plastic design, to the neglect of all other of its aspects. As my own
  sense of Socialism has enlarged and intensified, I have become more and more
  impressed by the imperfect Socialism of almost every Socialist movement that
  is going on; by its necessarily partial and limited projection from the
  clotted cants and habituations of things as they are. Some Socialists quarrel
  with the Liberal Party and with the Socialist section of the Liberal Party
  because it does not go far enough, because it does not embody a Socialism
  uncompromising and complete, because it has not definitely cut itself off
  from the old traditions, the discredited formulae, that served before the
  coming of our great idea. They are blind to the fact that there is no
  organized Socialism at present, uncompromising and complete, and the
  Socialists who flatter themselves they represent as much are merely those who
  have either never grasped or who have forgotten the full implications of
  Socialism. They are just a little step further, a very little step further in
  their departure from existing prejudices, in their subservience to existing
  institutions and existing imperatives.</p>

  <p>Take, for example, the Socialism that is popular in New York and Chicago
  and Germany, and that finds its exponents here typically in the inferior
  ranks of the Social Democratic Federation&mdash;the crude Marxite teaching.
  It still awaits permeation by true Socialist conceptions. It is a version of
  life adapted essentially to the imagination of the working wage earner, and
  limited by his limitations. It is the vision of poor souls perennially
  reminded each Monday morning of the shadow and irksomeness of life,
  perpetually recalled each Saturday pay time to a watery gleam of all that
  life might be. One of the numberless relationships of life, the relationship
  of capital or the employer to the employed, is made to overshadow all other
  relations. Get that put right, "expropriate the idle rich," transfer all
  capital to the State, make the State the humane, amenable, universal
  employer&mdash;that, to innumerable Socialist working men, is the horizon.
  The rest he sees in the forms of the life to which he is accustomed. A little
  home, a trifle larger and brighter than his present one, a more abounding
  table, a cheerful missus released from factory work and unhealthy competition
  with men, a bright and healthy family going to and fro to the public free
  schools, free medical attendance, universal State insurance for old age, free
  trams to Burnham Beeches, shorter hours of work and higher wages, no
  dismissals, no hunting for work that eludes one. All the wide world of
  collateral consequences that will follow from the cessation of the system of
  employment under conditions of individualist competition, he does not seem to
  apprehend. Such phrases as the citizenship and economic independence of women
  leave him cold. That Socialism has anything to say about the economic basis
  of the family, about the social aspects of marriage, about the rights of the
  parent, doesn't, I think, at first occur to him at all. Nor does he realize
  for a long time that for Socialism and under Socialist institutions will
  there be needed any system of self-discipline, any rules of conduct further
  than the natural impulses and the native goodness of man. He takes just that
  aspect of Socialism that appeals to him, and that alone, and it is only
  exceptionally at present, and very slowly, as a process of slow habituation
  and enlargement, that he comes to any wider conceptions. And, as a
  consequence, directly we pass to any social type to which weekly or monthly
  wages is not the dominating fact of life, and a simple unthinking faith in
  Yes or No decisions its dominant habit, the phrasings, the formulae, the
  statements and the discreet omissions of the leaders of working-class
  Socialism fail to appeal.</p>

  <p>Socialism commends itself to a considerable proportion of the working
  class simply as a beneficial change in the conditions of work and employment;
  to other sections of the community it presents itself through equally limited
  aspects. Certain ways of living it seems to condemn root and branch. To the
  stockbroker and many other sorts of trader, to the usurer, to the company
  promoter, to the retired butler who has invested his money in "weekly
  property," for example, it stands for the dissolution of all comprehensible
  social order. It simply repudiates the way of living to which they have
  committed themselves. And to great numbers of agreeable in intelligent people
  who live upon rent and interest it is a projected severing of every bond that
  holds man and man, that keeps servants respectful, tradespeople in order,
  railways and hotels available, and the whole procedure of life going. They
  class Socialism and Anarchism together in a way that is as logically unjust
  as it is from their point of view justifiable. Both cults have this in
  common, that they threaten to wipe out the whole world of the villa resident.
  And this sense of a threatened profound disturbance in their way of living
  pervades the attitude of nearly all the comfortable classes towards
  Socialism.</p>

  <p>When we discuss the attitude of the middle classes to Socialism we must
  always bear this keener sense of disconcerting changes in mind. It is a part
  of the queer composition of the human animal that its desire for happenings
  is balanced by an instinctive dread of real changes of condition. People,
  especially fully adult people, are creatures who have grown accustomed to a
  certain method of costume, a certain system of meals, a certain dietary,
  certain apparatus, a certain routine. They know their way about in life as it
  is. They would be lost in Utopia. Quite little alterations "put them out," as
  they say-&mdash;create a distressing feeling of inadequacy, make them "feel
  odd." Whatever little enlargements they may contemplate in reverie, in
  practice they know they want nothing except, perhaps, a little more of all
  the things they like. That's the way with most of us, anyhow. To make a
  fairly complete intimation of the nature of Socialism to an average, decent,
  middle-aged, middle-class person would be to arouse emotions of unspeakable
  terror, if the whole project didn't also naturally clothe itself in a quality
  of incredibility. And you will find, as a matter of fact, that your
  middle-class Socialists belong to two classes: either they are amiable people
  who don't understand a bit what Socialism is&mdash;and some of the most
  ardent and serviceable workers for Socialism are of this type&mdash;or they
  are people so unhappily situated and so unfortunate, or else of such
  exceptional imaginative force or training (which is itself, perhaps, from the
  practical point of view, a misfortune), as to be capable of a discontent with
  life as it is, so passionate as to outweigh instinctive timidities and
  discretions. Rest assured that to make any large section of the comfortable
  upper middle class Socialists, you must either misrepresent, and more
  particularly under-represent Socialism, or you must quicken their
  imaginations far beyond the present state of affairs.</p>

  <p>Some of the most ardent and serviceable of Socialist workers, I have said,
  are of the former type. For the most part they are philanthropic people, or
  women and men of the managing temperament shocked into a sort of Socialism by
  the more glaring and melodramatic cruelties of our universally cruel social
  system. They are the district visitors of Socialism. They do not realize that
  Socialism demands any change in themselves or in their way of living, they
  perceive in it simply a way of hope from the failures of vulgar charity.
  Chiefly they assail the bad conditions of life of the lower classes. They
  don't for a moment envisage a time when there will be no lower
  classes&mdash;that is beyond them altogether. Much less can they conceive of
  a time when there will be no governing class distinctively in possession of
  means. They exact respect from inferiors; no touch of Socialist warmth or
  light qualifies their arrogant manners. Perhaps they, too, broaden their
  conception of Socialism as time goes on, but so it begins with them. Now to
  make Socialists of this type the appeal is a very different one from the talk
  of class war and expropriation, and the abolition of the idle rich, which is
  so serviceable with a roomful of sweated workers. These people are moved
  partly by pity, and the best of them by a hatred for the squalor and waste of
  the present regime. Talk of the expropriated rich simply raises in their
  minds painful and disconcerting images of distressed gentlewomen. But one
  necessary aspect of the Socialist's vision that sends the coldest shiver down
  the spine of the working class Socialist is extraordinarily alluring and
  congenial to them, namely, the official and organized side. They love to
  think of houses and factories open to competent inspection, of municipal
  milk, sealed and certificated for every cottager's baby, of old age pensions
  and a high and rising minimum standard of life. They have an admirable sense
  of sanitation. They are the philanthropic and administrative Socialists as
  distinguished from the economic revolutionaries.</p>

  <p>This class of Socialist passes insensibly into the merely Socialistic
  philanthropist of the wealthy middle class to whom we owe so much helpful
  expenditure upon experiments in housing, in museum, and school construction,
  in educational endowment, and so forth. Their activities are not for one
  moment to be despised; they are a constant demonstration to dull and
  sceptical persons that things may be different, better, prettier, kindlier
  and more orderly. Many people impervious to tracts can be set thinking by a
  model village or a model factory. However petty much of what they achieve may
  be, there it is achieved&mdash;in legislation, in bricks and mortar. Among
  other things, these administrative Socialists serve to correct the very
  perceptible tendency of most working men Socialists to sentimental anarchism
  in regard to questions of control and conduct, a tendency due entirely to
  their social and administrative inexperience.</p>

  <p>For more thorough-going Socialism among the middle classes one must look
  to those strata and sections in which quickened imaginations and unsettling
  influences are to be found. The artist should ^ be extraordinarily attracted
  by Socialism. A mind habitually directed to beauty as an end must necessarily
  be exceptionally awake to the ugly congestions of our contemporary
  civilization, to the prolific futile production of gawky, ill-mannered,
  jostling new things, to the shabby profit-seeking that ousts beauty from life
  and poisons every enterprise of man. And not only artistic work, but the
  better sort of scientific investigation, the better sort of literary work,
  and every occupation that involves the persistent free use of thought, must
  bring the mind more and more towards the definite recognition of our social
  incoherence and waste. But this by no means exhausts the professions that
  ought to have a distinct bias for Socialism. The engineer, the architect, the
  mechanical inventor, the industrial organizer, and every sort of maker must
  be as one in their desire for emancipation from servitude to the promoter,
  the trader, the lawyer, and the forestaller, from the perpetually recurring
  obstruction of the claim of the private proprietor to every large and hopeful
  enterprise, and ready to respond to the immense creative element in the
  Socialist idea. Only it is that creative element which has so far found least
  expression in Socialist literature, which appears neither in the "class war'*
  literature of the working class Socialist nor the litigious, inspecting,
  fining, and regulating tracts and proposals of the administrative Socialist.
  To too many of these men in the constructive professions the substitution of
  a Socialist State for our present economic method carries with it no promise
  of emancipation at all. They think that to work for the public controls which
  an advance towards Socialism would set up, would be worse for them and for
  all that they desire to do than the profit-seeking, expense-cutting,
  mercenary making of the present regime.</p>

  <p>This is, I believe, a temporary and alterable state, contrary to the
  essential and permanent spirit of those engaged in constructive work. It is
  due very largely to the many misrepresentations and partial statements of
  Socialism that have rendered it palatable and assimilable to the working men
  and the administrative Socialist. Socialism has been presented on the one
  hand as a scheme of expropriation to a clamorous popular government of
  working men, far more ignorant and incapable of management than a
  shareholders' meeting, and, on the other, as a scheme for the encouragement
  of stupid little municipal authorities of the contemporary type in impossible
  business undertakings under the guidance of fussy, energetic, legal-minded
  and totally unscientific instigators. Except for the quite recent development
  of Socialist thought that is now being embodied in the New Heptarchy Series
  of the Fabian Society, scarcely anything has been done to dispel these
  reasonable dreads. I should think that from the point of view of Socialist
  propaganda, the time is altogether ripe now for a fresh and more vigorous
  insistence upon the materially creative aspect of the vision of Socialism, an
  aspect which is, after all, much more cardinal and characteristic than any
  aspect that has hitherto been presented systematically to the world. An
  enormous rebuilding, remaking, and expansion is integral in the Socialist
  dream. We want to get the land out of the control of the private owners among
  whom it is cut up, we want to get houses, factories, railways, mines, farms
  out of the dispersed management of then-proprietors, not in order to secure
  their present profits and hinder development, but in order to rearrange these
  things in a saner and finer fashion. An immense work of replanning,
  rebuilding, redistributing lies in the foreground of the Socialist vista. We
  contemplate an enormous clearance of existing things. We want an unfettered
  hand to make beautiful and convenient homes, splendid cities, noiseless great
  highways, beautiful bridges, clean, swift and splendid electric railways; we
  are inspired by a faith in the coming of clean, wide and simple methods of
  agricultural production. But it is only now that Socialism is beginning to be
  put in these terms. So put it, and the engineer and the architect and the
  scientific organizer, agricultural or industrial&mdash;all the best of them,
  anyhow&mdash;will find it correspond extraordinarily to their way of
  thinking.</p>

  <p>Not all of them, of course. A middle-aged architect with a note-book full
  of bits of gothic, and a reputation for suburban churches, or full of bits of
  "Queen Anne" and a connexion among villa builders, or an engineer
  paterfamilias who has tasted blood as an expert witness, aren't to be won by
  these suggestions. They're part of things as they are. But that is only a
  temporary inconvenience to Socialism. The young men do respond, and they are
  the future and what Socialism needs.</p>

  <p>And there's another great constructive profession that should be Socialist
  altogether, and that is the medical profession. Especially does Socialism
  claim the younger men who haven't yet sunken from the hospitals to the
  trading individualism of a practice. And then there are the teachers, the
  schoolmasters and school-mistresses. The idea of a great organized making is
  innate in the quality of their professions; the making of sound bodies and
  healthy conditions, the making of informed and disciplined minds. The methods
  of the profit-seeking schoolmaster, the practice-buying doctor are imposed
  upon them by the necessities of an individualist world. Both these two great
  professions present nowadays, side by side, two types&mdash;the new type,
  highly qualified, official, administrative, scientific, public-spirited; the
  old type, capitalistic, with a pretentious house and equipment, the doctor
  with a brougham, and a dispensary, the schoolmaster or schoolmistress with
  some huge old stucco house converted by jerry-built extensions to meet
  scholastic needs. Who would not rather, one may ask, choose the former way
  who was not already irrevocably committed to the latter? Well, I with my
  Socialist dreams would like to answer "No one," but I'm learning to check my
  buoyant optimism. The imagination and science in a young man may cry out for
  the public position, for the valiant public work, for the hard, honourable,
  creative years. He may sit with his fellow-students and his fellow-workers in
  a nocturnal cloud of tobacco smoke and fine talk, and vow himself to research
  and the creative world state. In the morning he will think he has dreamed; he
  will recall what the world is, what Socialists are, what he has heard wild
  Socialists say about science and his art. He will elect for the real world
  and a practice.</p>

  <p>Something more than a failure to state the constructive and educational
  quality in Socialism on the part of its exponents has to be admitted in
  accounting for the unnatural want of sympathetic co-operation between them
  and the bulk of these noble professions. I cannot disguise from myself
  certain curiously irrelevant strands that have interwoven with the partial
  statements of Socialism current in England, and which it is high time, I
  think, for Socialists to repudiate. Socialism is something more than an empty
  criticism of our contemporary disorder and waste of life; it is a great
  intimation of construction, organization, science and education. But,
  concurrently with its extension and its destructive criticism of the
  capitalistic individualism of to-day, there has been another movement,
  essentially an anarchist movement, hostile to machinery and apparatus,
  hostile to medical science, hostile to order, hostile to education, a
  Rousseauite movement in the direction of a sentimentalized naturalism, a
  Tolstoyan movement in the direction of a non-resisting pietism, which has not
  simply been confused with the Socialist movement, but has really affected and
  interwoven with it. It is not simply that wherever discussion and destructive
  criticism of the present conventional bases of society occur, both ways of
  thinking crop up together; they occur all too often as alternating phases in
  the same individual. Few of us are so clear-headed as to be free from
  profound self-contradictions. So that it is no great marvel, after all, if
  the presentation of Socialism has got mixed up with Return-to-Nature ideas,
  with proposals for living in a state of unregulated primitive virtue in
  purely hand-made houses, upon rain water and uncooked fruit. We Socialists
  have to disentangle it from these things now. We have to disavow, with all
  necessary emphasis, that gibing at science and the medical profession, at
  schools and books and the necessary apparatus for collective thinking, which
  has been one of our little ornamental weaknesses in the past. That has, I
  know, kept a very considerable number of intelligent professional men from
  inquiring further into Socialist theories and teachings. As a consequence
  there are, especially in the medical profession, quite a number of
  unconscious Socialists, men, often with a far clearer grip upon the central
  ideas of Socialism than many of its professed exponents, who have worked out
  these ideas for themselves, and are incredulous to hear them called
  Socialistic.</p>

  <p>So much for the specifically creative and imagination-using professions.
  Throughout the whole range of the more educated middle classes, however,
  there are causes at work that necessarily stimulate thought towards
  Socialism, that engender scepticisms, promote inquiries leading towards what
  is at present the least expounded of all aspects of Socialism&mdash;the
  relation of Socialism to the institution of the Family....</p>

  <p>The Family, and not the individual, is still the unit in contemporary
  civilization, and indeed in nearly all social systems that have ever existed.
  The adult male, the head of the family, has been the citizen, the sole
  representative of the family in the State. About him have been grouped his
  one or more wives, his children, his dependents. His position towards them
  has always been&mdash;is still in many respects to this day&mdash;one of
  ownership. He was owner of them all, and in many of the less sophisticated
  systems of the past his ownership was as complete as over his horse and house
  and land&mdash;more complete than over his land. He could sell his children
  into slavery, barter his wives. There has been a secular mitigation of the
  rights of this sort of private property; the establishment of monogamy, for
  instance, did for the family what President Roosevelt's proposed legislation
  against large accumulations might do for industrial enterprises, but to this
  day in our own community, for all such mitigations and many euphemisms, the
  ownership of the head of the family is still a manifest fact. He votes. He
  keeps and protects. He determines the education and professions of his
  children. He is entitled to monetary consolation for any infringement of his
  rights over wife or daughter.</p>

  <p>Every intelligent woman understands that, as a matter of hard fact,
  beneath all the civilities of to-day, she is actual or potential property,
  and has to treat herself and keep herself as that. She may by force or
  subtlety turn her chains into weapons, she may succeed in exacting a
  reciprocal property in a man, the fact remains fundamental that she is either
  isolated or owned.</p>

  <p>But I need not go on writing facts with which every one is acquainted. My
  concern now is to point out that Socialism repudiates the private ownership
  of the head of the family as completely as it repudiates any other sort of
  private ownership. Socialism involves the responsible citizenship of women,
  their economic independence of men, and all the personal freedom that follows
  that, it intervenes between the children and the parents, claiming to support
  them, protect them and educate them for its own ampler purposes. Socialism,
  in fact, is the State family. The old family of the private individual must
  vanish before it, just as the old water works of private enterprise, or the
  old gas company. They are incompatible with it. Socialism assails the
  triumphant egotism of the family to-day just as Christianity did in its
  earlier and more vital centuries. So far as English Socialism is concerned
  (and the thing is still more the case in America) I must confess that the
  assault has displayed a quite extraordinary instinct for taking cover, but
  that is a question of tactics rather than of essential antagonism.</p>

  <p>It is possible to believe that so far as the middle classes are concerned
  this discretion has been carried altogether too far. Socialists would have
  forwarded their cause better if they had been more outspoken. It has led to
  preposterous misunderstandings; and among others to the charge that Socialism
  implied Free Love. The middle-class family, I am increasingly convinced, is a
  group in a state of tension. I believe that a modest but complete statement
  of the Socialist criticism of the family and the proposed Socialist
  substitute for the conventional relationships might awaken extraordinary
  responses at the present time. The great terror of the eighties and early
  nineties that crushed all reasonable discussion of sexual relationship is, I
  believe, altogether over.</p>

  <p>The whole of the present system is riddled with discontents. One factor is
  the enhanced sense of the child in middle-class life: the old sentiment was
  that the parent owned the child, the new is that the children own the
  parents. There has come an intensified respect for children, an immense
  increase in the trouble, attention and expenditure devoted to them&mdash;and
  a very natural and human accompaniment in the huge fall in the middle-class
  birth-rate. It is felt that to bear and rear children is the most noble and
  splendid and responsible thing in life, and an increasing number of people
  modestly evade it. People see more clearly the social service of parentage,
  and are more and more inclined to demand a recognition from the State for
  this service. The middle-class parent might conceivably be horrified if you
  suggested the State should pay him for his offspring, but he would have no
  objection whatever to being indirectly and partially paid by a differential
  income tax graduated in relation to the size of his family.</p>

  <p>With this increased sense of the virtue and public service of parentage
  there has gone on a great development of the criticism of schools and
  teaching. The more educated middle-class parent has become an amateur
  educationist of considerable virulence. He sees more and more distinctly the
  inadequacy of his own private attempts to educate, the necessary charlatanry
  and insufficiency of the private adventure school. He finds much to envy in
  the elementary schools. If he is ignorant and short-sighted, he joins in the
  bitter cry of the middle classes, and clamours against the pampering of the
  working class, and the rising of the rates which renders his efforts to
  educate his own children more difficult. But a more intelligent type of
  middle-class parent sends his boy in for public scholarships, sets to work to
  get educational endowment for his own class also, and makes another step
  towards Socialism. Moreover, the increasing intelligence of the middle-class
  parent and the steady swallowing up of the smaller capitalist and smaller
  shareholders by the larger enterprises and fortunes, alike bring home to him
  the temporary and uncertain nature of the advantages his private efforts give
  his children over those of the working man. He sees no more than a brief
  respite for them against the economic cataclysms of the coming time. He is
  more and more alive to the presence of secular change in the world.</p>

  <p>He does not feel sure his sons will carry on the old business, continue
  the old practice. He begins to appreciate the concentration of wealth. The
  secular development of the capitalistic system robs him more and more of his
  sense of securities. He is uneasier than he used to be about investments. He
  no longer has that complete faith in private insurance companies that once
  sustained him. His mind broadens out to State insurance as to State
  education. He is far more amenable than he used to be to the idea that the
  only way to provide for one's own posterity is to provide for every one's
  posterity, to merge parentage in citizenship. The family of the middle-class
  man which fights for itself alone, is lost. Socialism comes into the
  middle-class family offering education, offering assurances for the future,
  and only very distantly intimating the price to be paid in weakened
  individual control. But far profounder disintegrations are at work.</p>

  <p>The internal character of the middle-class family is altering
  fundamentally with the general growth of intelligence, with the higher
  education of women, with the comings and goings for this purpose and that,
  the bicycles and games, the enlarged social appetites and opportunities of a
  new time. The more or less conscious Strike against. Parentage is having
  far-reaching effects. The family proper becomes a numerically smaller group.
  Enormous numbers of childless families appear; the middle-class family with
  two, or at most three, children is the rule rather than the exception in
  certain strata. This makes the family a less various and interesting group,
  with a smaller demand for attention, emotion, effort. Quite apart from the
  general mental quickening of the time, it leaves more and more social energy,
  curiosity, enterprise free, either to fret within the narrow family limits or
  to go outside them. The Strike against Parentage " takes among other forms
  the form of a strike against marriage; great numbers of men and women stand
  out from a relationship which every year seems more limiting and (except for
  its temporary passional aspect) purposeless. The number of intelligent and
  healthy women inadequately employed, who either idle as wives in attenuated
  modern families, childless or with an insufficient child or so, or who work
  for an unsatisfying subsistence as unmarried women, increases. To them the
  complete conceptions of Socialism should have an extraordinary appeal.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the feminine mind and soul in the world as something
  distinct and self-conscious, is the appearance of a distinct new engine of
  criticism against the individualist family, against this dwindling property
  of the once-ascendant male&mdash;who no longer effectually rules, no longer,
  in many cases, either protects or sustains, what all too often is so shorn of
  his beams as to be but a vexatious power of jealous restriction and
  interference upon his wife and children. The educated girl resents the
  proposed loss of her freedom in marriage, the educated married woman realizes
  as well as resents the losses of scope and interest marriage entails. If it
  were not for the economic disadvantages that make intelligent women dread a
  solitary old age in bitter poverty, vast numbers of women who are married
  to-day would have remained single independent women. This discontent of women
  is a huge available force for Socialism. The wife of the past was, to put it
  brutally, caught younger&mdash;so young that she had had no time to
  think&mdash;she began forthwith to bear babies, rear babies, and (which she
  did in a quite proportionate profusion) bury babies&mdash;she never had a
  moment to think. Now the wife with double the leisure, double the education
  and half the emotional scope of her worn prolific grandmother, sits at home
  and thinks things over. You find her letting herself loose in clubs, in
  literary enterprises, in schemes for joint households to relieve herself and
  her husband from the continuation of a duologue that has exhausted its
  interest. The husband finds himself divided between his sympathetic sense of
  tedium and the proprietary tradition in which we live.</p>

  <p>For these tensions in the disintegration of the old proprietary family no
  remedy offers itself to-day except the solutions that arise as essential
  portions of the Socialist scheme. The alternative is hypocrisy and
  disorder.</p>

  <p>There is yet another and still more effectual system of strains at work in
  the existing social unit, and that is the strain between parents and
  children. That has always existed. It is one of our most transparent
  sentimental pretences that there is any natural subordination of son to
  father, of daughter to mother. As a matter of fact a good deal of natural
  antagonism appears at the adolescence of " the young. Something very like an
  instinct stirs in them, to rebel, to go out. The old habits of solicitude,
  control and restraint in the parent become more and more hampering, irksome,
  and exasperating to the offspring. The middle-class son gets away in spirit
  and in fact to school, to college, to business&mdash;his sister does all she
  can to follow his excellent example. In a world with vast moral and
  intellectual changes in progress the intelligent young find the struggle for
  independence intensified by a conflict of ideas. The modem tendency to
  cherish and preserve youthfulness; the keener desire for living that prevents
  women getting fat and ugly, and men bald and incompetent by forty-five, is
  another dissolvent factor among these stresses. The daughter is not only
  restrained by her mother's precepts, but inflamed by her example. The son
  finds his father's coevals treating him as a contemporary.</p>

  <p>Well, into these conflicts and disorders comes Socialism, and Socialism
  alone, to explain, to justify, to propose new conventions and new
  interpretations of relationship, to champion the reasonable claims of the
  young, to mitigate the thwarted ownership of the old. Socialism comes,
  constructive amid the wreckage.</p>

  <p>Let me at this point, and before I conclude, put one thing with the utmost
  possible clearness. The Socialist does not propose to destroy something that
  conceivably would otherwise last for ever, when he proposes a new set of
  institutions, and a new system of conduct to replace the old proprietary
  family. He no more regards the institution of marriage as a permanent thing
  than he regards a state of competitive industrialism as a permanent thing. In
  the economic sphere, quite apart from any Socialist ideas or Socialist
  activities, it is manifest that competitive individualism destroys itself.
  This was reasoned out long ago in the <i>Capital</i> of Marx; it is receiving
  its first gigantic practical demonstration in the United States of America.
  Whatever happens, we believe that competitive industrialism will change and
  end&mdash;and we Socialists at least believe that the alternative to some
  form of Socialism is tyranny and social ruin. So, too, in the social sphere,
  whether Socialists succeed altogether or fail altogether, or in whatever
  measure they succeed or fail, it does not alter the fact that the family is
  weakening, dwindling, breaking up, disintegrating. The alternative to a
  planned and organized Socialism is not the maintenance of the present system,
  but its logical development, and that is all too plainly a growing
  complication of pretences as the old imperatives weaken and fade. We already
  live in a world of stupendous hypocrisies, a world wherein rakes and rascals
  champion the sacred institution of the family, and a network of sexual
  secrets, vaguely suspected, disagreeably present, and only half-concealed,
  pervades every social group one enters. Cynicism, a dismal swamp of base
  intrigues, cruel restrictions and habitual insincerities, is the manifest
  destiny of the present regime unless we make some revolutionary turn. It
  cannot work out its own salvation without the profoundest change in its
  determining ideas. And what change in those ideas is offered except by the
  Socialist?</p>

  <p>In relation to all these most intimate aspects of life, Socialism, and
  Socialism alone, supplies the hope and suggestions of clean and practicable
  solutions. So far, Socialists have either been silent or vague, or&mdash;let
  us say&mdash;tactful, in relation to this central tangle of life. To begin to
  speak plainly among the silences and suppressions, the "find out for
  yourself" of the current time, would be, I think, to grip the middle-class
  woman and the middle-class youth of both sexes with an extraordinary new
  interest, to irradiate the dissensions of every bored couple and every
  squabbling family with broad conceptions, and enormously to enlarge and
  stimulate the Socialist movement at the present time.</p>

  <p>I DO not think that the general reader at all appreciates the steady
  development of Socialist thought during the past two decades. Directly one
  comes into close contact with contemporary Socialists one discovers in all
  sorts of ways the evidence of the synthetic work that has been and still is
  in process, the clearing and growth of guiding ideas, the qualification of
  primitive statements, the consideration, the adaptation to meet this or that
  adequate criticism. A quarter of a century ago Socialism was still to a very
  large extent a doctrine of negative, a passionate criticism and denial of the
  theories that sustained and excused the injustices of contemporary life, a
  repudiation of social and economic methods then held to be indispensable and
  in the very nature of things. Its positive proposals were as sketchy as they
  were enthusiastic, sketchy and, it must be confessed, fluctuating. One needs
  to turn back to the files of its every-day publications to realize the
  progress that has been made, the secular emergence of a consistent and
  continually more nearly complete and directive scheme of social
  reconstruction from the chaotic propositions and hopes and denials of the
  earlier time. In no direction is this more evident than in the steady
  clearing of the Socialistic attitude towards marriage and the family; in the
  disentanglement of Socialism from much idealist and irrelevant matter with
  which it was once closely associated and encumbered, in the orderly
  incorporation of conceptions that at one time seemed not only outside of, but
  hostile to. Socialist ways of thinking....</p>

  <p>Nothing could have brought out this more clearly than the comical attempt
  made recently by the <i>Daily Express</i> to suggest that Mr. Keir Hardie and
  the party he leads was mysteriously involved with my unfortunate self in
  teaching Free Love to respectable working men. When my heat and indignation
  had presently a little subsided, I found myself asking how it came about,
  that any one could bring together such discrepant things as the orderly
  proposals of Socialism as they shape themselves in the projects of Mr. Keir
  Hardie, let us say, and the doctrine of sexual go-as-you-please. And so
  inquiring my mind drifted back to the days&mdash;it is a hazy period to
  me&mdash;when Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft were alive, when Shelley
  explained his views to Harriet. These people were in a sort of way
  Socialists; Palaeo-Socialists. They professed also very distinctly that
  uncovenanted freedom of action in sexual matters which is, I suppose. Free
  Love. Indeed, so near are we to these old confusions that there is still, I
  find, one Palaeo-Socialist surviving&mdash;Mr. Belfort Bax. In that large
  undifferentiated past, all sorts of ideas, as yet too ill defined to
  eliminate one another, socialist ideas, communist ideas, anarchist ideas,
  Rousseauism, seethed together and seemed akin. In a sense they were akin in
  that they were the condemnation of the existing order, the outcome of the
  destructive criticism of this of its aspects or that. They were all breccia.
  But in all else, directly they began to find definite statement, they were
  flatly contradictory one with another. Or at least they stood upon different
  levels of assumption and application.</p>

  <p>The formula of Anarchism and Socialism are, no doubt, almost diametrically
  opposed; Anarchism denies government, Socialism would concentrate all
  controls in the State, yet it is after all possible in different relations
  and different aspects to entertain the two. When one comes to dreams, when
  one tries to imagine one's finest sort of people, one must surely imagine
  them too fine for control and prohibitions, doing right by a sort of inner
  impulse, "above the Law." One's dreamland perfection is Anarchy&mdash;just as
  no one would imagine a policeman (or for the matter of that a drain-pipe) in
  Heaven. But come down to earth, to men the descendants of apes, to men
  competing to live, and passionately jealous and energetic, and for the
  highways and market-places of life at any rate, one asks for law and
  convention. In Heaven or any Perfection there will be no Socialism, just as
  there will be no Bimetallism; there is the sphere of communism, anarchism,
  universal love and universal service. It is in the workaday world of limited
  and egotistical souls that Socialism has its place. All men who dream at all
  of noble things are Anarchists in their dreams, and half at least of the
  people who are much in love, I suppose, want to be this much Anarchistic that
  they do not want to feel under a law or compulsion one with another. They may
  want to possess, they may want to be wholly possessed, but they do not want a
  law court or public opinion to protect that possession as a "right."</p>

  <p>But it's still not clearly recognized how distinct are the spheres of
  Anarchism and Socialism. The last instance of this confusion that has
  seriously affected the common idea of the Socialist was as recent as the late
  Mr. Grant Allen. He was not, I think, even in his time a very representative
  Socialist, but certainly he did present, as if it were a counsel of
  perfection for this harsh and grimy world, something very like reckless
  abandonment to the passion or mood of the moment. I doubt if he would have
  found a dozen supporters in the Fabian Society in his own time. I should
  think his teaching would have appealed far more powerfully to extreme
  individualists of the type of Mr. Auberon Herbert. However that may be, I do
  not think there is at present , among English and American Socialists any
  representative figure at all counselling Free Love. The modern tendency is
  all towards an amount of control over the function of reproduction, if
  anything, in excess of that exercised by the State and public usage to-day.
  Let me make a brief comparison of existing conditions with what I believe to
  be the ideals of most of my fellow Socialists in this matter, and the reader
  can then judge for himself between the two systems of intervention.</p>

  <p>And first let me run over the outline of the thing we are most likely to
  forget and have wrong in such a discussion, the thing directly under our
  noses, the thing that is. People have an odd way of assuming in such a
  comparison that we are living under an obligation to conform to the moral
  code of the Christian church at the present time. As a matter of fact we are
  living in an epoch of extraordinary freedom in sexual matters, mitigated only
  by certain economic imperatives. Anti-socialist writers have a way of
  pretending that Socialists want to make Free Love possible, while in reality
  Free Love is open to any solvent person to-day. People who do not want to
  many are as free as air to come together and part again as they choose; there
  is no law to prevent them, the State takes it out of their children with a
  certain mild malignancy-that is all. Married people are equally free, saving
  certain limited proprietary claims upon one another, claims that can always
  be met by the payment of damages. The restraints are purely restraints of
  opinion, that would be as powerful to-morrow if legal marriage was altogether
  abolished. There was a time, no doubt, when there were actual legal
  punishments for unchastity in women, but that time has gone, it might seem,
  for ever. Our State retains only, from an age that held mercantile methods in
  less honour, a certain habit of persecuting women who sell themselves by
  retail for money, but this is done in the name of public order and not on
  account of the act. Such a woman must exact cash payment; she cannot recover
  debts, she is placed at a ridiculous disadvantage towards her landlord (which
  makes accommodating her peculiarly lucrative), and she is exposed to various
  inconveniences of street regulation and status that must ultimately corrupt
  any police force in the world&mdash;for all that she seems to continue in the
  land with a certain air of prosperity. Beyond that our control between man
  and woman is nil. Our society today has in fact no complete system of sexual
  morals at all. It has the remains of a system.</p>

  <p>It has the remains of a monogamic patriarchal system, in which a
  responsible man owned nearly absolutely wife and offspring. All its laws and
  sentiments alike are derived from the reduction and qualification of
  that.</p>

  <p>These are not the pretensions indeed of the present system such as it is,
  but they are the facts. And even the present disorder, one gathers, is
  unstable. One hears on every hand of its further decadence. From Father
  Vaughan to President Roosevelt, and volleying from the whole bench of
  bishops, comes the witness to that. Not only the old breaches grow wider and
  more frequent, but in the very penetralia of the family the decay goes on.
  The birth-rate falls&mdash;and falls. The family fails more and more in its
  essential object. This is a process absolutely independent of any Socialist
  propaganda; it is part of the normal development of the existing social and
  economic system. It makes for sterilization, for furtive wantonness and
  dishonour. The existing system produces no remedies at all. Prominent people
  break out ever and again into vehement scoldings of this phenomenon; the
  newspapers and magazines re-echo "Race Suicide," but there is no sign
  whatever in the statistical curves of the smallest decimal per cent, of
  response to these exhortations.</p>

  <p>Our existing sexual order is a system in decay. What are the alternatives
  to its steady process of collapse? That is the question we have to ask
  ourselves. To heap foul abuse, as many quite honest but terror-stricken
  people seem disposed to do, on any one who attempts to discuss any
  alternative, is simply to accelerate this process. To me it seems there are
  three main directions along which things may go in the future, and between
  which rational men have to choose.</p>

  <p>The first is to regard the present process as inevitable and moving
  towards the elimination of weak and gentle types, to clear one's mind of the
  prejudices of one's time, and to contemplate a disintegration of all the
  realities of the family into an epoch of Free Love, mitigated by mercantile
  necessities and a few transparent hypocrisies. Rich men will be free to live
  lives of irresponsible polygamy; poor men will do what they can; women's life
  will be adventurous, the population will decline in numbers and perhaps in
  quality. (To guard against that mischievous quoter who lies in wait for all
  Socialist writers, let me say at once that this state of affairs is
  anti-Socialist, is, I believe, socially destructive, and does not commend
  itself to me at all.)</p>

  <p>The second direction is towards re-action, an attempt to return to the
  simple old conceptions of our past, to the patriarchal family, that is to
  say, of the middle ages. This I take to be the conception of such a Liberal
  as Mr. G. K. Chesterton, or such a Conservative as Lord Hugh Cecil, and to be
  also as much idea as one can find underlying most tirades against modern
  morals. The rights of the parent will be insisted on and restored, and the
  parent means pretty distinctly the father. Subject to the influence of a
  powerful and well-organized Church, a rejuvenescent Church, he is to resume
  that control over wife and children of which the modem State has partially
  deprived him. The development of secular education is to be arrested,
  particular stress is to be laid upon the wickedness of any intervention with
  natural reproductive processes, the spread of Knowledge in certain directions
  is to be made criminal, and early marriages are to be encouraged....</p>

  <p>I do not by any means regard this as an impossible programme; I believe
  that in many directions it is quite a practicable one; it is in harmony with
  great masses of feeling in the country, and with many natural instincts. It
  would not of course affect the educated wealthy and leisurely upper class in
  the community, who would be able and intelligent' enough to impose their own
  private glosses upon its teaching, but it would "moralize" the general
  population, and reduce them to a state of prolific squalor. Its realization
  would be, I believe, almost inevitably accompanied by a decline in
  sanitation, and a correlated rise in birth-rate and death-rate, for life
  would be cheap, and drainpipes and antiseptics dear, and it is quite
  conceivable that after some stresses, a very nearly stable social equilibrium
  would be attained. After all it is this simple sort of life, without drains
  and without education, with child labour (in the open air for the most part
  until the eighteenth century&mdash;though that is a detail) and a consequent
  straightforward desire for remunerative children that has been the normal
  life of humanity for many thousands of years. We might not succeed in getting
  back to a landed peasantry, we might find large masses of the population
  would hang up obstinately in industrial towns&mdash;towns that in their
  simple naturalness of congestion might come to resemble the Chinese pattern
  pretty closely; but I have no doubt we could move far in that direction with
  very little difficulty indeed.</p>

  <p>The third direction is towards the developing conceptions of Socialism.
  And it must be confessed at once that these, as they emerge steadily and
  methodically from mere generalities and confusions, do present themselves as
  being in many aspects, novel and untried. They are as untested, and in many
  respects as alarming, as steam traction or iron shipping were in 1830. They
  display, clearly and unambiguously, principles already timidly admitted in
  practice and sentiment to-day, but as yet admitted only confusedly and amidst
  a cloud of contradictions. Essentially the Socialist position is a denial of
  property in human beings; not only must land and the means of production be
  liberated from the multitude of little monarchs among whom they are
  distributed, to the general injury and inconvenience, but women and children,
  just as much as men and things, must cease to be owned. Socialism indeed
  proposes to abolish altogether the patriarchal family amidst whose
  disintegrating ruins we live, and to raise women to an equal citizenship with
  men. It proposes to give a man no more property in a woman than a woman has
  in a man. To stupid people who cannot see the difference between a woman and
  a thing, the abolition of the private ownership of women takes the form of
  having "wives in common," and suggests the Corroboree. It is obviously
  nothing of the sort. It is the recognition in theory of what in many classes
  is already the fact,&mdash;the practical equality of men and women in a
  civilized state. It is quite compatible with a marriage contract of far
  greater stringency than that recognized throughout Christendom to-day.</p>

  <p>Now what sort of contract will the Socialist State require for marriage?
  Here again there are perfectly clear and simple principles. Socialism states
  definitely what almost everybody recognizes nowadays with greater or less
  clearness, and that is the concern of the State for children. The children
  people bring into the world can be no more their private concern entirely,
  than the disease germs they disseminate or the noises a man makes in a
  thin-floored flat. Socialism says boldly the State is the Over-Parent, the
  Outer-Parent. People rear children for the State and the future; if they do
  that well, they do the whole world a service, and deserve payment just as
  much as if they built a bridge or raised a crop of wheat; if they do it
  unpropitiously and ill, they have done the world an injury. Socialism denies
  altogether the right of any one to beget children carelessly and
  promiscuously, and for the prevention of disease and evil births alike, the
  Socialist is prepared for an insistence upon intelligence and self-restraint
  quite beyond the current practice. At present we deal with all that sort of
  thing as an infringement of private proprietary rights; the Socialist holds
  it is the world that is injured.</p>

  <p>It follows that motherhood, which we still in a muddle-headed way seem to
  regard as partly self-indulgence and partly a service paid to a man by a
  woman, is regarded by the Socialists as a benefit to society, a public duty
  done. It may be in many cases a duty full of pride and happiness&mdash;that
  is beside the mark. The State will pay for children born legitimately in the
  marriage it will sanction. A woman with healthy and successful offspring will
  draw a wage for each one of them from the State, so long as they go on well.
  It will be her wage. Under the State she will control her child's upbringing.
  How far her husband will share in the power of direction is a matter of
  detail upon which opinion may vary&mdash;and does vary widely among
  Socialists. I suppose for the most part they incline to the conception of a
  joint control. So the monstrous injustice of the present time which makes a
  mother dependent upon the economic accidents of her man, which plunges the
  best of wives and the most admirable of children into abject poverty if he
  happens to die, which visits his sins of waste and carelessness upon them far
  more than upon himself, will disappear. So too the still more monstrous
  absurdity of women discharging their supreme social function, bearing and
  rearing children in their spare time, as it were, while they "earn their
  living'* by contributing some half mechanical element to some trivial
  industrial product, will disappear. That is the gist of the Socialist
  attitude towards marriage; the repudiation of private ownership of women and
  children, and the payment of mothers. Partially but already very extensively,
  socialistic ideas have spread through the whole body of our community; they
  are the saving element in what would otherwise be a moral catastrophe now,
  and the Socialist simply puts with precise definition the conclusions to
  which all but foolish, ignorant, base or careless people are
  moving&mdash;albeit some are moving thither with averted faces. Already we
  have the large, still incomplete edifice of free education, and a great mass
  of legislation against child labour; we have free baths, free playgrounds,
  free libraries,&mdash;more and more people are coming to admit the social
  necessity of saving our children from the private enterprise of the milkman
  who does not sterilize his cans, from the private enterprise of the
  schoolmaster who cannot teach, from the private enterprise of the employer
  who takes them on at small wages at thirteen or fourteen to turn them back on
  our hands as ignorant hooligans and social wastrels at eighteen or twenty....
  But the straightforward payment to the mother still remains to be brought
  within the sphere of practical application. To that we shall come.</p>
