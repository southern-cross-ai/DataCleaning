  <p class="first">IT will lead into my subject most conveniently to contrast
  and separate two divergent types of mind, types which are to be distinguished
  chiefly by their attitude toward time, and more particularly by the relative
  importance they attach and the relative amount of thought they give to the
  future.</p>

  <p>The first of these two types of mind, and it is, I think, the predominant
  type, the type of the majority of living people, is that which seems scarcely
  to think of the future at all, which regards it as a sort of blank
  non-existence upon which the advancing present will presently write events.
  The second type, which is, I think, a more modern and much less abundant type
  of mind, thinks constantly and by preference of things to come, and of
  present things mainly in relation to the results that must arise from them.
  The former type of mind, when one gets it in its purity, is retrospective in
  habit, and it interprets the things of the present, and gives value to this
  and denies it to that, entirely with relation to the past. The latter type of
  mind is constructive in habit, it interprets the things of the present and
  gives value to this or that, entirely in relation to things designed or
  foreseen.</p>

  <p>While from that former point of view our life is simply to reap the
  consequences of the past, from this our life is to prepare the future. The
  former type one might speak of as the legal or submissive type of mind,
  because the business, the practice, and the training of a lawyer dispose him
  toward it; he of all men must constantly refer to the law made, the right
  established, the precedent set, and consistently ignore or condemn the thing
  that is only seeking to establish itself. The latter type of mind I might for
  contrast call the legislative, creative, organizing, or masterful type,
  because it is perpetually attacking and altering the established order of
  things, perpetually falling away from respect for what the past has given us.
  It sees the world as one great workshop, and the present is no more than
  material for the future, for the thing that is yet destined to be. It is in
  the active mood of thought, while the former is in the passive; it is the
  mind of youth, it is the mind more manifest among the western nations, while
  the former is the mind of age, the mind of the oriental.</p>

  <p>Things have been, says the legal mind, and so we are here. The creative
  mind says we are here because things have yet to be.</p>

  <p>Now I do not wish to suggest that the great mass of people belong to
  either of these two types. Indeed, I speak of them as two distinct and
  distinguishable types mainly for convenience and in order to accentuate their
  distinction. There are probably very few people who brood constantly upon the
  past without any thought of the future at all, and there are probably
  scarcely any who live and think consistently in relation to the future. The
  great mass of people occupy an intermediate position between these extremes,
  they pass daily and hourly from the passive mood to the active, they see this
  thing in relation to its associations and that thing in relation to its
  consequences, and they do not even suspect that they are using two distinct
  methods in their minds.</p>

  <p>But for all that they are distinct methods, the method of reference to the
  past and the method of reference to the future, and their mingling in many of
  our minds no more abolishes their difference than the existence of piebald
  horses proves that white is black.</p>

  <p>I believe that it is not sufficiently recognized just how different in
  their consequences these two methods are, and just where their difference and
  where the failure to appreciate their difference takes one. This present time
  is a period of quite extraordinary uncertainty and indecision upon endless
  questions&mdash;moral questions, SBSthetic questions, religious and political
  questions&mdash;upon which we should all of us be happier to feel assured and
  settled; and a very large amount of this floating uncertainty about these
  important matters is due to the fact that with most of us these two
  insufficiently distinguished ways of looking at things are not only present
  together, but in actual conflict in our minds, in unsuspected conflict; we
  pass from one to the other heedlessly without any clear recognition of the
  fundamental difference in conclusions that exists between the two, and we do
  this with disastrous results to our confidence and to our consistency in
  dealing with all sorts of things.</p>

  <p>But before pointing out how divergent these two types or habits of mind
  really are, it is necessary to meet a possible objection to what has been
  said. I may put that objection in this form: Is not this distinction between
  a type of mind that thinks of the past and a type of mind that thinks of the
  future a sort of hair-splitting, almost like distinguishing between people
  who have left hands and people who have right? Everybody believes that the
  present is entirely determined by the past, you say; but then everybody
  believes also that the present determines the future. Are we simply
  separating and contrasting two sides of everybody's opinion? To which one
  replies that we are not discussing what we know and believe about the
  relations of past, present, and future, or of the relation of cause and
  effect to each other in time.</p>

  <p>We all know the present depends for its causes on the past, and the future
  depends for its causes upon the present. But this discussion concerns the way
  in which we approach things upon this common ground of knowledge and belief.
  We may all know there is an east and a west, but if some of us always
  approach and look at things from the west, if some of us always approach and
  look at things from the east, and if others again wander about with a pretty
  disregard of direction, looking at things as chance determines, some of us
  will get to a westward conclusion of this journey, and some of us will get to
  an eastward conclusion, and some of us will get to no definite conclusion at
  all about all sorts of important matters. And yet those who are travelling
  east, and those who are travelling west, and those who are wandering
  haphazard, may be all upon the same ground of belief and statement and amid
  the same assembly of proven facts. Precisely the same thing, divergence of
  result, will happen if you always approach things from the point of view of
  their causes, or if you approach them always with a view to their probable
  effects. And in several very important groups of human affairs it is possible
  to show quite clearly just how widely apart the two methods, pursued each in
  its purity, take those who follow them.</p>

  <p>I suppose that three hundred years ago all people who thought at all about
  moral questions, about questions of Right and Wrong, deduced their rules of
  conduct absolutely and unreservedly from the past, from some dogmatic
  injunction, some finally settled decree. The great mass of people do so
  to-day. It is written, they say. "Thou shalt not steal," for
  example&mdash;that is the sole, complete, sufficient reason why you should
  not steal, and even to-day there is a strong aversion to admit that there is
  any relation between the actual consequences of acts and the imperatives of
  right and wrong. Our lives are to reap the fruits of determinate things, and
  it is still a fundamental presumption of the established morality that one
  must do right though the heavens fall. But there are people coming into this
  world who would refuse to call it Right if it brought the heavens about our
  heads, however authoritative its sources and sanctions, and this new
  disposition is, I believe, a growing one. I suppose in all ages people in a
  timid, hesitating, guilty way have tempered the austerity of a dogmatic moral
  code by small infractions to secure obviously kindly ends, but it was, I am
  told, the Jesuits who first deliberately sought to qualify the moral
  interpretation of acts by a consideration of their results. To-day there are
  few people who have not more or less clearly discovered the future as a more
  or less important factor in moral considerations. To-day there is a certain
  small proportion of people who frankly regard morality as a means to an end,
  as an overriding of immediate and personal considerations out of regard to
  something to be attained in the future, and who break away altogether from
  the idea of a code dogmatically established forever. Most of us are not so
  definite as that, but most of us are deeply tinged with the spirit of
  compromise between the past and the future; we profess an unbounded
  allegiance to the prescriptions of the past, and we practise a general
  observance of its injunctions, but we qualify to a vague, variable extent
  with considerations of expediency. We hold, for example, that we must respect
  our promises. But suppose we find unexpectedly that for one of us to keep a
  promise, which has been sealed and sworn in the most sacred fashion, must
  lead to the great suffering of some other human being, must lead, in fact, to
  practical evil? Would a man do right or wrong if he broke such a promise? The
  practical decision most modern people would make would be to break the
  promise. Most would say that they did evil to avoid a greater evil. But
  suppose it was not such very great suffering we were going to inflict, but
  only some suffering? And suppose it was a rather important promise? With most
  of us it would then come to be a matter of weighing the promise, the thing of
  the past, against this unexpected bad consequence, the thing of the future.
  And the smaller the overplus of evil consequences the more most of us would
  vacillate. But neither of the two types of mind we are contrasting would
  vacillate at all. The legal type of mind would obey the past unhesitatingly,
  the creative would unhesitatingly sacrifice it to the future. The legal mind
  would say, "they who break the law at any point break it altogether," while
  the creative mind would say, "let the dead past bury its dead."</p>

  <p>It is convenient to take my illustration from the sphere of promises, but
  it is in the realm of sexual morality that the two methods are most acutely
  in conflict.</p>

  <p>And I would like to suggest that until you have definitely determined
  either to obey the real or imaginary imperatives of the past, or to set
  yourself toward the demands of some ideal of the future, until you have made
  up your mind to adhere to one or other of these two types of mental action in
  these matters, you are not even within hope of a sustained consistency in the
  thought that underlies your acts, that in every issue of principle that comes
  upon you, you will be entirely at the mercy of the intellectual mood that
  happens to be ascendent at that particular moment in your mind.</p>

  <p>In the sphere of public affairs also these two ways of looking at things
  work out into equally divergent and incompatible consequences. The legal mind
  insists upon treaties, constitutions, legitimacies, and charters; the
  legislative incessantly assails these. Whenever some period of stress sets
  in, some great conflict between institutions and the forces in things, there
  comes a sorting out of these two types of mind. The legal mind becomes
  glorified and transfigured in the form of hopeless loyalty, the creative mind
  inspires revolutions and reconstructions. And particularly is this difference
  of attitude accentuated in the disputes that arise out of wars. In most
  modern wars there is no doubt quite traceable on one side or the other a
  distinct creative idea, a distinct regard for some future consequence; but
  the main dispute even in most modern wars and the sole dispute in most
  mediaeval wars will be found to be a reference, not to the future, but to the
  past; to turn upon a question of fact and right. The wars of Plantagenet and
  Lancastrian England with France, for example, were based entirely upon a
  dummy claim, supported by obscure legal arguments, upon the crown of
  France.</p>

  <p>And the arguments that centered about the late war in South Africa ignored
  any ideal of a great united South African state almost entirely, and quibbled
  this way and that about who began the fighting and what was or was not
  written in some obscure revision of a treaty a score of years ago. Yet
  beneath the legal issues the broad creative idea has been apparent in the
  public mind during this war. It will be found more or less definitely
  formulated beneath almost all the great wars of the past century, and a
  comparison of the wars of the nineteenth century with the wars of the middle
  ages will show, I think, that in this field also there has been a discovery
  of the future, an increasing disposition to shift the reference and values
  from things accomplished to things to come.</p>

  <p>Yet though foresight creeps into our politics and a reference to
  consequence into our morality, it is still the past that dominates our lives.
  But why? Why are we so bound to it? It is into the future we go, to-morrow is
  the eventful thing for us. There lies all that remains to be felt by us and
  our children and all those that are dear to us. Yet we marshal and order men
  into classes entirely with regard to the past; we draw shame and honor out of
  the past; against the rights of property, the vested interests, the
  agreements and establishments of the past the future has no rights.
  Literature is for the most part history or history at one remove, and what is
  culture but a mold of interpretation into which new things are thrust, a
  collection of standards, a sort of bed of King Og, to which all new
  expressions must be lopped or stretched? Our conveniences, like our thoughts,
  are all retrospective. We travel on roads so narrow that they suffocate our
  traffic; we live in uncomfortable, inconvenient, life-wasting houses out of a
  love of familiar shapes and familiar customs and a dread of strangeness; all
  our public affairs are cramped by local boundaries impossibly restricted and
  small. Our clothing, our habits of speech, our spelling, our weights and
  measures, our coinage, our religious and political theories, all witness to
  the binding power of the past upon our minds. Yet we do not serve the past as
  the Chinese have done. There are degrees. We do not worship our ancestors or
  prescribe a rigid local costume; we dare to enlarge our stock of knowledge,
  and we qualify the classics with occasional adventures into original thought.
  Compared with the Chinese we are distinctly aware of the future. But compared
  with what we might be, the past is all our world.</p>

  <p>The reason why the retrospective habit, the legal habit, is so dominant,
  and always has been so predominant, is of course a perfectly obvious one. We
  follow a fundamental human principle and take what we can get. All people
  believe the past is certain, defined, and knowable, and only a few people
  believe that it is possible to know anything about the future. Man has
  acquired the habit of going to the past because it was the line of least
  resistance for his mind. While a certain variable portion of the past is
  serviceable matter for knowledge in the case of everyone, the future is, to a
  mind without an imagination trained in scientific habits of thought, non-
  existent. All our minds are made of memories. In our memories each of us has
  something that without any special training whatever will go back into the
  past and grip firmly and convincingly all sorts of workable facts, sometimes
  more convincingly than firmly. But the imagination, unless it is strengthened
  by a very sound training in the laws of causation, wanders like a lost child
  in the blankness of things to come and returns empty.</p>

  <p>Many people believe, therefore, that there can be no sort of certainty
  about the future. You can know no more about the future, I was recently
  assured by a friend, than you can know which way a kitten will jump next. And
  to all who hold that view, who regard the future as a perpetual source of
  convulsive surprises, as an impenetrable, incurable, perpetual blankness, it
  is right and reasonable to derive such values as it is necessary to attach to
  things from the events that have certainly happened with regard to them. It
  is our ignorance of the future and our persuasion that that ignorance is
  absolutely incurable that alone gives the past its enormous predominance in
  our thoughts. But through the ages, the long unbroken succession of
  fortune-tellers&mdash;and they flourish still&mdash;witnesses to the
  perpetually smoldering feeling that after all there may be a better sort of
  knowledge&mdash;a more serviceable sort of knowledge than that we now
  possess.</p>

  <p>On the whole there is something sympathetic for the dupe of the fortune-
  teller in the spirit of modern science; it is one of the persuasions that
  come into one's mind, as one assimilates the broad conception of science,
  that the adequacy of causation is universal; that in absolute fact&mdash;if
  not in that little bubble of relative fact which constitutes the individual
  life&mdash;in absolute fact the future is just as fixed and determinate, just
  as settled and inevitable, just as possible a matter of knowledge as the
  past. Our personal memory gives us an impression of the superior reality and
  trustworthiness of things in the past, as of things that have finally
  committed themselves and said their say, but the more clearly we master the
  leading conceptions of science the better we understand that this impression
  is one of the results of the peculiar conditions of our lives, and not an
  absolute truth. The man of science comes to believe at last that the events
  of the year A.D. 4000 are as fixed, settled, and unchangeable as the events
  of the year 1600. Only about the latter he has some material for belief and
  about the former practically none.</p>

  <p>And the question arises how far this absolute ignorance of the future is a
  fixed and necessary condition of human life, and how far some application of
  intellectual methods may not attenuate even if it does not absolutely set
  aside the veil between ourselves and things to come. And I am venturing to
  suggest to you that along certain lines and with certain qualifications and
  limitations a working knowledge of things in the future is a possible and
  practicable thing. And in order to support this suggestion I would call your
  attention to certain facts about our knowledge of the past, and more
  particularly I would insist upon this, that about the past our range of
  absolute certainty is very limited indeed. About the past I would suggest we
  are inclined to overestimate our certainty, just as I think we are inclined
  to underestimate the certainties of the future. And such a knowledge of the
  past as we have is not all of the same sort or derived from the same
  sources.</p>

  <p>Let us consider just what an educated man of to-day knows of the past.
  First of all he has the realest of all knowledge&mdash;the knowledge of his
  own personal experiences, his memory. Uneducated people believe their
  memories absolutely, and most educated people believe them with a few
  reservations. Some of us take up a critical attitude even toward our own
  memories; we know that they not only sometimes drop things out, but that
  sometimes a sort of dreaming or a strong suggestion will put things in. But
  for all that, memory remains vivid and real as no other knowledge can be, and
  to have seen and heard and felt is to be nearest to absolute conviction. Yet
  our memory of direct impressions is only the smallest part of what we know.
  Outside that bright area comes knowledge of a different order&mdash;the
  knowledge brought to us by other people. Outside our immediate personal
  memory there comes this wider area of facts or quasi facts told us by more or
  less trustworthy people, told us by word of mouth or by the written word of
  living and of dead writers. This is the past of report, rumor, tradition, and
  history&mdash;the second sort of knowledge of the past. The nearer knowledge
  of this sort is abundant and clear and detailed, remoter it becomes vaguer,
  still more remotely in time and space it dies down to brief, imperfect
  inscriptions and enigmatical traditions, and at last dies away, so far as the
  records and traditions of humanity go, into a doubt and darkness as blank,
  just as blank, as futurity.</p>

  <p>And now let me remind you that this second zone of knowledge outside the
  bright area of what we have felt and witnessed and handled for
  ourselves&mdash;this zone of hearsay and history and
  tradition&mdash;completed the whole knowledge of the past that was accessible
  to Shakespeare, for example. To these limits man's knowledge of the past was
  absolutely confined, save for some inklings and guesses, save for some small,
  almost negligible beginnings, until the nineteenth century began. Besides the
  correct knowledge in this scheme of hearsay and history a man had a certain
  amount of legend and error that rounded off the picture in a very
  satisfactory and misleading way, according to Bishop Ussher, just exactly
  4004 years B.C. And that was man's universal history&mdash;that was his
  all&mdash;until the scientific epoch began. And beyond those limits&mdash;?
  Well, I suppose the educated man of the sixteenth century was as certain of
  the non-existence of anything before the creation of the world as he was, and
  as most of us are still, of the practical non-existence of the future, or at
  any rate he was as satisfied of the impossibility of knowledge in the one
  direction as in the other.</p>

  <p>But modern science, that is to say the relentless systematic criticism of
  phenomena, has in the past hundred years absolutely destroyed the conception
  of a finitely distant beginning of things; has abolished such limits to the
  past as a dated creation set, and added an enormous vista to that limited
  sixteenth century outlook. And what I would insist upon is that this further
  knowledge is a new kind of knowledge, obtained in a new kind of way. We know
  to-day, quite as confidently and in many respects more intimately than we
  know Sargon or Zenobia or Caractacus, the form and the habits of creatures
  that no living being has ever met, that no human eye has ever regarded, and
  the character of scenery that no man has ever seen or can ever possibly see;
  we picture to ourselves the labyrinthodon raising its clumsy head above the
  water of the carboniferous swamps in which he lived, and we figure the
  pterodactyls, those great bird lizards, flapping their way athwart the
  forests of the Mesozoic age with exactly the same certainty as that with
  which we picture the rhinoceros or the vulture. I doubt no more about the
  facts in this farther picture than I do about those in the nearest. I believe
  in the megatherium which I have never seen as confidently as I believe in the
  hippopotamus that has engulfed buns from my hand. A vast amount of detail in
  that farther picture is now fixed and finite for all time. And a countless
  number of investigators are persistently and confidently enlarging,
  amplifying, correcting, and pushing farther and farther back the boundaries
  of this greater past&mdash;this prehuman past&mdash;that the scientific
  criticism of existing phenomena has discovered and restored and brought for
  the first time into the world of human thought. We have become possessed of a
  new and once unsuspected history of the world&mdash;of which all the history
  that was known, for example, to Dr. Johnson is only the brief concluding
  chapter; and even that concluding chapter has been greatly enlarged and
  corrected by the exploring archaeologists working strictly upon the lines of
  the new method&mdash;that is to say, the comparison and criticism of
  suggestive facts.</p>

  <p>I want particularly to insist upon this, that all this outer
  past&mdash;this non-historical past&mdash;is the product of a new and keener
  habit of inquiry, and no sort of revelation. It is simply due to a new and
  more critical way of looking at things. Our knowledge of the geological past,
  clear and definite as it has become, is of a different and lower order than
  the knowledge of our memory, and yet of a quite practicable and trustworthy
  order&mdash;a knowledge good enough to go upon; and if one were to speak of
  the private memory as the personal past, of the next wider area of knowledge
  as the traditional or historical past, then one might call all that great and
  inspiring background of remoter geological time the inductive past.</p>

  <p>And this great discovery of the inductive past was got by the discussion
  and redis-cussion and effective criticism of a number of existing facts,
  odd-shaped lumps of stone, streaks and bandings in quarries and cliffs,
  anatomical and developmental detail that had always been about in the world,
  that had been lying at the feet of mankind so long as mankind had existed,
  but that no one had ever dreamed before could supply any information at all,
  much more reveal such astounding and enlightening vistas. Looked at in a new
  way they became sources of dazzling and penetrating light. The remoter past
  lit up and became a picture. Considered as effects, compared and criticised,
  they yielded a clairvoyant vision of the history of interminable years.</p>

  <p>And now, if it has been possible for men by picking out a number of
  suggestive and significant looking things in the present, by comparing them,
  criticising them, and discussing them, with a perpetual insistence upon
  "Why?" without any guiding tradition, and indeed in the teeth of established
  beliefs, to construct this amazing searchlight of inference into the remoter
  past, is it really, after all, such an extravagant and hopeless thing to
  suggest that, by seeking for operating causes instead of for fossils, and by
  criticising them as persistently and thoroughly as the geological record has
  been criticised, it may be possible to throw a searchlight of inference
  forward instead of backward, and to attain to a knowledge of coming things as
  clear, as universally convincing, and infinitely more important to mankind
  than the clear vision of the past that geology has opened to us during the
  nineteenth century?</p>

  <p>Let us grant that anything to correspond with the memory, anything having
  the same relation to the future that memory has to the past, is out of the
  question. We cannot imagine, of course, that we can ever know any personal
  future to correspond with our personal past, or any traditional future to
  correspond with our traditional past; but the possibility of an inductive
  future to correspond with that great inductive past of geology and
  archaeology is an altogether different thing.</p>

  <p>I must confess that I believe quite firmly that an inductive knowledge of
  a great number of things in the future is becoming a human possibility. I
  believe that the time is drawing near when it will be possible to suggest a
  systematic exploration of the future. And you must not judge the
  practicability of this enterprise by the failures of the past. So far nothing
  has been attempted, so far no first-class mind has ever focused itself upon
  these issues; but suppose the laws of social and political development, for
  example, were given as many brains, were given as much attention, criticism,
  and discussion as we have given to the laws of chemical combination during
  the last fifty years, what might we not expect?</p>

  <p>To the popular mind of to-day there is something very difficult in such a
  suggestion, soberly made. But here, in this institution (the Royal
  Institution of London) which has watched for a whole century over the
  splendid adolescence of science, and where the spirit of science is surely
  understood, you will know that as a matter of fact prophecy has always been
  inseparably associated with the idea of scientific research.</p>

  <p>The popular idea of scientific investigation is a vehement, aimless
  collection of little facts, collected as a bower bird collects shells and
  pebbles, in methodical little rows, and out of this process, in some manner
  unknown to the popular mind, certain conjuring tricks&mdash;the celebrated
  "wonders of science"&mdash;in a sort of accidental way emerge. The popular
  conception of all discovery is accident But you will know that the essential
  thing in the scientific process is not the collection of facts, but the
  analysis of facts. Facts are the raw material and not the substance of
  science. It is analysis that has given us all ordered knowledge, and you know
  that the aim and the test and the justification of the scientific process is
  not a marketable conjuring trick, but prophecy. Until a scientific theory
  yields confident forecasts you know it is unsound and tentative; it is mere
  theorizing, as evanescent as art talk or the phantoms politicians talk about.
  The splendid body of gravitational astronomy, for example, establishes itself
  upon the certain forecast of stellar movements, and you would absolutely
  refuse to believe its amazing assertions if it were not for these same
  unerring forecasts. The whole body of medical science aims, and claims the
  ability, to diagnose. Meteorology constantly and persistently aims at
  prophecy, and it will never stand in a place of honor until it can certainly
  foretell. The chemist forecasts elements before he meets them&mdash;it is
  very properly his boast&mdash;and the splendid manner in which the mind of
  Clerk Maxwell reached in front of all experiments and foretold those things
  that Marconi has materialized is familiar to us all.</p>

  <p>All applied mathematics resolves into computation to foretell things which
  otherwise can only be determined by trial. Even in so unscientific a science
  as economics there have been forecasts. And if I am right in saying that
  science aims at prophecy, and if the specialist in each science is in fact
  doing his best now to prophesy within the limits of his field, what is there
  to stand in the way of our building up this growing body of forecast into an
  ordered picture of the future that will be just as certain, just as strictly
  science, and perhaps just as detailed as the picture that has been built up
  within the last hundred years of the geological past? Well, so far and until
  we bring the prophecy down to the affairs of man and his children, it is just
  as possible to carry induction forward as back; it is just as simple and sure
  to work out the changing orbit of the earth in the future until the tidal
  drag hauls one unchanging face at last toward the sun as it is to work back
  to its blazing and molten past. Until man comes in, the inductive future is
  as real and convincing as the inductive past. But inorganic forces are the
  smaller part and the minor interest in this concern. Directly man becomes a
  factor the nature of the problem changes, and our whole present interest
  centers on the question whether man is, indeed, individually and collectively
  incalculable, a new element which entirely alters the nature of our inquiry
  and stamps it at once as vain and hopeless, or whether his presence
  complicates, but does not alter, the essential nature of the induction. How
  far may we hope to get trustworthy inductions about the future of man?</p>

  <p>Well, I think, on the whole, we are inclined to underrate our chance of
  certainties in the future, just as I think we are inclined to be too
  credulous about the historical past. The vividness of our personal memories,
  which are the very essence of reality to us, throws a glamor of conviction
  over tradition and past inductions. But the personal future must in the very
  nature of things be hidden from us so long as time endures, and this black
  ignorance at our very feet&mdash;this black shadow that corresponds to the
  brightness of our memories behind us&mdash;throws a glamor of uncertainty and
  unreality over all the future. We are continually surprising ourselves by our
  own will or want of will; the individualities about us are continually
  producing the unexpected, and it is very natural to reason that as we can
  never be precisely sure before the time comes what we are going to do and
  feel, and if we can never count with absolute certainty upon the acts and
  happenings even of our most, intimate friends, how much the more impossible
  is it to anticipate the behavior in any direction of states and
  communities.</p>

  <p>In reply to which I would advance the suggestion that an increase in the
  number of human beings considered may positively simplify the case instead of
  complicating it; that as the individuals increase in number they begin to
  average out. Let me illustrate this point by a comparison. Angular pit-sand
  has grains of the most varied shapes. Examined microscopically, you will find
  all sorts of angles and outlines and variations. Before you look you can say
  of no particular grain what its outline will be. And if you shoot a load of
  such sand from a cart you cannot foretell with any certainty where any
  particular grain will be in the heap that you make; but you can
  tell&mdash;you can tell pretty definitely&mdash;the form of the heap as a
  whole. And further, if you pass that sand through a series of shoots and
  finally drop it some distance to the ground, you will be able to foretell
  that grains of a certain sort of form and size will for the most part be
  found in one part of the heap and grains of another sort of form and size
  will be found in another part of the heap. In such a case, you see, the thing
  as a whole may be simpler than its component parts, and this I submit is also
  the case in many human affairs. So that because the individual future eludes
  us completely that is no reason why we should not aspire to, and discover and
  use, safe and serviceable, generalizations upon countless important issues in
  the human destiny.</p>

  <p>But there is a very grave and important-looking difference between a load
  of sand and a multitude of human beings, and this I must face and examine.
  Our thoughts and wills and emotions are contagious. An exceptional sort of
  sand grain, a sand grain that was exceptionally big and heavy, for example,
  exerts no influence worth considering upon any other of the sand grains in
  the load. They will fall and roll and heap themselves just the same whether
  that exceptional grain is with them or not; but an exceptional man comes into
  the world, a Caesar or a Napoleon or a Peter the Hermit, and he appears to
  persuade and convince and compel and take entire possession of the sand
  heap&mdash;I mean the community&mdash;and to twist and alter its destinies to
  an almost unlimited extent. And if this is indeed the case, it reduces our
  project of an inductive knowledge of the future to very small limits. To hope
  to foretell the birth and coming of men of exceptional force and genius is to
  hope incredibly, and if, indeed, such exceptional men do as much as they seem
  to do in warping the path of humanity, our utmost prophetic limit in human
  affairs is a conditional sort of prophecy. If people do so and so, we can
  say, then such and such results will follow, and we must admit that that is
  our limit.</p>

  <p>But everybody does not believe in the importance of the leading man. There
  are those who will say that the whole world is different by reason of
  Napoleon. There are those who will say that the world of to-day would be very
  much as it is now if Napoleon had never been born. Other men would have
  arisen to make Napoleon's conquests and codify the law, redistribute the
  worn-out boundaries of Europe and achieve all those changes which we so
  readily ascribe to Napoleon's will alone. There are those who believe
  entirely in the individual man and those who believe entirely in the forces
  behind the individual man, and for my own part I must confess myself a rather
  extreme case of the latter kind. I must confess I believe that if by some
  juggling with space and time Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Edward IV., William the
  Conqueror, Lord Rosebery, and Robert Burns had all been changed at birth it
  would not have produced any serious dislocation of the course of destiny. I
  believe that these great men of ours are no more than images and symbols and
  instruments taken, as it were, haphazard by the incessant and consistent
  forces behind them; they are the pen-nibs Fate has used for her writing, the
  diamonds upon the drill that pierces through the rock. And the more one
  inclines to this trust in forces the more one will believe in the possibility
  of a reasoned inductive view of the future that will serve us in politics, in
  morals, in social contrivances, and in a thousand spacious ways. And even
  those who take the most extreme and personal and melodramatic view of the
  ways of human destiny, who see life as a tissue of fairy godmother births and
  accidental meetings and promises and jealousies, will, I suppose, admit there
  comes a limit to these things&mdash;that at last personality dies away and
  the greater forces come to their own. The great man, however great he be,
  cannot set back the whole scheme of things; what he does in right and reason
  will remain, and what he does against the greater creative forces will
  perish. We cannot foresee him; let us grant that. His personal difference,
  the splendor of his effect, his dramatic arrangement of events will be his
  own&mdash;in other words, we cannot estimate for accidents and accelerations
  and delays; but if only we throw our web of generalization wide enough, if
  only we spin our rope of induction strong enough, the final result of the
  great man, his ultimate surviving consequences, will come within our net.</p>

  <p>Such, then, is the sort of knowledge of the future that I believe is
  attainable and worth attaining. I believe that the deliberate direction of
  historical study and of economic and social study toward the future and an
  increasing reference, a deliberate and courageous reference, to the future in
  moral and religious discussion, would be enormously stimulating and
  enormously profitable to our intellectual life. I have done my best to
  suggest to you that such an enterprise is now a serious and practicable
  undertaking. But at the risk of repetition I would call your attention to the
  essential difference that must always hold between our attainable knowledge
  of the future and our existing knowledge of the past. The portion of the past
  that is brightest and most real to each of us is the individual
  past&mdash;the personal memory. The portion of the future that must remain
  darkest and least accessible is the individual future. Scientific prophecy
  will not be fortune-telling, whatever else it may be. Those excellent people
  who cast horoscopes, those illegal fashionable palm-reading ladies who abound
  so much today, in whom nobody is so foolish as to believe, and to whom
  everybody is foolish enough to go, need fear no competition from the
  scientific prophets. The knowledge of the future we may hope to gain will be
  general and not individual; it will be no sort of knowledge that will either
  hamper us in the exercise of our individual free will or relieve us of our
  personal responsibility.</p>

  <p>And now, how far is it possible at the present time to speculate on the
  particular outline the future will assume when it is investigated in this
  way?</p>

  <p>It is interesting, before we answer that question, to take into account
  the speculations of a certain sect and culture of people who already, before
  the middle of last century, had set their faces toward the future as the
  justifying explanation of the present. These were the positivists, whose
  position is still most eloquently maintained and displayed by Mr. Frederic
  Harrison, in spite of the great expansion of the human outlook that has
  occurred since Comte. If you read Mr. Harrison, and if you are also, as I
  presume your presence here indicates, saturated with that new wine of more
  spacious knowledge that has been given the world during the last fifty years,
  you will have been greatly impressed by the peculiar limitations of the
  positivist conception of the future. So far as I can gather, Comte was, for
  all practical purposes, totally ignorant of that remoter past outside the
  past that is known to us by history, or if he was not totally ignorant of its
  existence, he was, and conscientiously remained, ignorant of its relevancy to
  the history of humanity. In the narrow and limited past he recognized men had
  always been like the men of to-day; in the future he could not imagine that
  they would be anything more than men like the men of to-day. He perceived, as
  we all perceive, that the old social order was breaking up, and after a
  richly suggestive and incomplete analysis of the forces that were breaking it
  up he set himself to plan a new static social order to replace it. If you
  will read Comte, or, what is much easier and pleasanter, if you will read Mr.
  Frederic Harrison, you will find this conception constantly
  apparent&mdash;that there was once a stable condition of society with
  humanity, so to speak, sitting down in an orderly and respectable manner;
  that humanity has been stirred up and is on the move, and that finally it
  will sit down again on a higher plane, and for good and all, cultured and
  happy, in the reorganized positivist state. And since he could see nothing
  beyond man in the future, there, in that millennial fashion, Comte had to
  end. Since he could imagine nothing higher than man, he had to assert that
  humanity, and particularly the future of humanity, was the highest of all
  conceivable things. All that was perfectly comprehensible in a thinker of the
  first half of the nineteenth century. But we of the early twentieth, and
  particularly that growing majority of us who have been born since the Origin
  of Species was written, have no excuse for any such limited vision. Our
  imaginations have been trained upon a past in which the past that Comte knew
  is scarcely more than the concluding moment. We perceive that man, and all
  the world of men, is no more than the present phase of a development so great
  and splendid that beside this vision epics jingle like nursery rhymes, and
  all the exploits of humanity shrivel to the proportion of castles in the
  sand. We look back through countless millions of years and see the will to
  live struggling out of the intertidal slime, struggling from shape to shape
  and from power to power, crawling and then walking confidently upon the land,
  struggling generation after generation to master the air, creeping down into
  the darkness of the deep; we see it turn upon itself in rage and hunger and
  reshape itself anew; we watch it draw nearer and more akin to us, expanding,
  elaborating itself, pursuing its relentless, inconceivable purpose, until at
  last it reaches us and its being beats through our brains and arteries,
  throbs and thunders in our battleships, roars through our cities, sings in
  our music, and flowers in our art. And when, from that retrospect, we turn
  again toward the future, surely any thought of finality, any millennial
  settlement of cultured persons, has vanished from our minds.</p>

  <p>This fact that man is not final is the great unmanageable, disturbing fact
  that arises upon us in the scientific discovery of the future, and to my
  mind, at any rate, the question what is to come after man is the most
  persistently fascinating and the most insoluble question in the whole
  world.</p>

  <p>Of course we have no answer. Such imaginations as we have refuse to rise
  to the task.</p>

  <p>But for the nearer future, while man is still man, there are a few general
  statements that seem to grow more certain. It seems to be pretty generally
  believed today that our dense populations are in the opening phase of a
  process of diffusion and aeration. It seems pretty inevitable also that at
  least the mass of white population in the world will be forced some way up
  the scale of education and personal efficiency in the next two or three
  decades. It is not difficult to collect reasons for supposing&mdash;and such
  reasons have been collected&mdash;that in the near future, in a couple of
  hundred years, as one rash optimist has written, or in a thousand or so,
  humanity will be definitely and conscientiously organizing itself as a great
  world state&mdash;a great world state that will purge from itself much that
  is mean, much that is bestial, and much that makes for individual dullness
  and dreariness, grayness and wretchedness in the world of to-day; and
  although we know that there is nothing final in that world state, although we
  see it only as something to be reached and passed, although we are sure there
  will be no such sitting down to restore and perfect a culture as the
  positivists foretell, yet few people can persuade themselves to see anything
  beyond that except in the vaguest and most general terms. That world state of
  more vivid, beautiful, and eventful people is, so to speak, on the brow of
  the hill, and we cannot see over, though some of us can imagine great uplands
  beyond and something, something that glitters elusively, taking first one
  form and then another, through the haze. We can see no detail, we can see
  nothing definable, and it is simply, I know, the sanguine necessity of our
  minds that makes us believe those uplands of the future are still more
  gracious and splendid than we can either hope or imagine. But of things that
  can be demonstrated we have none.</p>

  <p>Yet I suppose most of us entertain certain necessary persuasions, without
  which a moral life in this world is neither a reasonable nor a possible
  thing. All this paper is built finally upon certain negative beliefs that are
  incapable of scientific establishment. Our lives and powers are limited, our
  scope in space and time is limited, and it is not unreasonable that for
  fundamental beliefs wc must go outside the sphere of reason and set our feet
  upon faith. Implicit in all such speculations as this is a very definite and
  quite arbitrary belief, and that belief is that neither humanity nor in truth
  any individual human being is living its life in vain. And it is entirely by
  an act of faith that we must rule out of our forecasts certain possibilities,
  certain things that one may consider improbable and against the chances, but
  that no one upon scientific grounds can call impossible.</p>

  <p>One must admit that it is impossible to show why certain things should not
  utterly destroy and end the entire human race and story, why night should not
  presently come down and make all our dreams and efforts vain. It is
  conceivable, for example, that some great unexpected mass of matter should
  presently rush upon us out of space, whirl sun and planets aside like dead
  leaves before the breeze, and collide with and utterly destroy every spark of
  life upon this earth. So far as positive human knowledge goes, this is a
  conceivably possible thing. There is nothing in science to show why such a
  thing should not be. It is conceivable, too, that some pestilence may
  presently appear, some new disease, that will destroy, not lo or 15 or 20 per
  cent, of the earth's inhabitants as pestilences have done in the past, but
  100 per cent; and so end our race. No one, speaking from scientific grounds
  alone, can say, "That cannot be." And no one can dispute that some great
  disease of the atmosphere, some trailing cometary poison, some great
  emanation of vapor from the interior of the earth, such as Mr. Shiel has made
  a brilliant use of in his "Purple Cloud," is consistent with every
  demonstrated fact in the world. There may arise new animals to prey upon us
  by land and sea, and there may come some drug or a wrecking madness into the
  minds of men. And finally, there is the reasonable certainty that this sun of
  ours must radiate itself toward extinction; that, at least, must happen; it
  will grow cooler and cooler, and its planets will rotate ever more sluggishly
  until some day this earth of ours, tideless and slow moving, will be dead and
  frozen, and all that has lived upon it will be frozen out and done with.
  There surely man must end. That of all such nightmares is the most
  insistently convincing.</p>

  <p>And yet one doesn't believe it.</p>

  <p>At least I do not. And I do not believe in these things because I have
  come to believe in certain other things&mdash;in the coherency and purpose in
  the world and in the greatness of human destiny. Worlds may freeze and suns
  may perish, but there stirs something within us now that can never die
  again.</p>

  <p>Do not misunderstand me when I speak of the greatness of human
  destiny.</p>

  <p>If I may speak quite openly to you, I will confess that, considered as a
  final product, I do not think very much of myself or (saving your presence)
  my fellow-creatures. I do not think I could possibly join in the worship of
  humanity with any gravity or sincerity. Think of it! Think of the positive
  facts. There are surely moods for all of us when one can feel Swift's
  amazement that such a being should deal in pride. There are moods when one
  can join in the laughter of Democritus; and they would come oftener were not
  the spectacle of human littleness so abundantly shot with pain. But it is not
  only with pain that the world is shot&mdash;it is shot with promise. Small as
  our vanity and carnality make us, there has been a day of still smaller
  things. It is the long ascent of the past that gives the lie to our despair.
  We know now that all the blood and passion of our life were represented in
  the Carboniferous time by something&mdash;something, perhaps, coldblooded and
  with a clammy skin, that lurked between air and water, and fled before the
  giant amphibia of those days.</p>

  <p>For all the folly, blindness, and pain of our lives, we have come some way
  from that. And the distance we have travelled gives us some earnest of the
  way we have yet to go.</p>

  <p>Why should things cease at man? Why should not this rising curve rise yet
  more steeply and swiftly? There are many things to suggest that we are now in
  a phase of rapid and unprecedented development. The conditions under which
  men live are changing with an ever-increasing rapidity, and, so far as our
  knowledge goes, no sort of creatures have ever lived under changing
  conditions without undergoing the pro-foundest changes themselves. In the
  past century there was more change in the conditions of human life than there
  had been in the previous thousand years. A hundred years ago inventors and
  investigators were rare scattered men, and now invention and inquiry are the
  work of an unorganized army. This century will see changes that will dwarf
  those of the nineteenth century, as those of the nineteenth dwarf those of
  the eighteenth. One can see no sign anywhere that this rush of change will be
  over presently, that the positivist dream of a social reconstruction and of a
  new static culture phase will ever be realized. Human society never has been
  quite static, and it will presently cease to attempt to be static.</p>

  <p>Everything seems pointing to the belief that we are entering upon a
  progress that will go on, with an ever-widening and ever more confident
  stride, forever. The reorganization of society that is going on now beneath
  the traditional appearance of things is a kinetic reorganization. We are
  getting into marching order. We have struck our camp forever and we are out
  upon the roads.</p>

  <p>We are in the beginning of the greatest change that humanity has ever
  undergone. There is no shock, no epoch-making incident&mdash;but then there
  is no shock at a cloudy daybreak. At no point can we say, "Here it commences,
  now; last minute was night and this is morning." But insensibly we are in the
  day. If we care to look, we can foresee growing knowledge, growing order, and
  presently a deliberate improvement of the blood and character of the race.
  And what we can see and imagine gives us a measure and gives us faith for
  what surpasses the imagination.</p>

  <p>It is possible to believe that all the past is but the beginning of a
  beginning, and that all that is and has been is but the twilight of the dawn.
  It is possible to believe that all that the human mind has ever accomplished
  is but the dream before the awakening. We cannot see, there is no need for us
  to see, what this world will be like when the day has fully come. We are
  creatures of the twilight. But it is out of our race and lineage that minds
  will spring, that will reach back to us in our littleness to know us better
  than we know ourselves, and that will reach forward fearlessly to comprehend
  this future that defeats our eyes.</p>

  <p>All this world is heavy with the promise of greater things, and a day will
  come, one day in the unending succession of days, when beings, beings who are
  now latent in our thoughts and hidden in our loins, shall stand upon this
  earth as one stands upon a footstool, and shall laugh and reach out their
  hands amid the stars.</p>
