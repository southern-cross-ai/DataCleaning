  <h3>A RADIO TALK BROADCAST TO AUSTRIALIA ON JANUARY 19, 1939</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">I WOULD like in this article to say something about a type
  of work, Utopian Fiction, often associated with anticipatory tales. It is not
  a very close association. Some Futuristic stories are indeed Utopian, but
  usually they have nothing in common with the Utopian spirit. They profess to
  foretell&mdash;more often than not, with warnings and forebodings. The
  Utopian story imagines a better and a happier world and makes no presence to
  reality. For 24 centuries at least men have been telling Utopian stories, and
  they are all stories arising out of discontent and escaping towards
  dreamland. They all express a certain appetite for life&mdash;"if
  only"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"If only"&mdash;that is the Utopian key-note. There is little prospect of
  any futuristic writings becoming permanent literature. We prophets write for
  our own time and pass almost before we are dead, but some of the Utopias are
  among the most enduring gems in the literary treasure house. They throw down
  no such self-destructive challenge as the futurist writer does, when he says,
  "This is the way things are going&mdash;and this what is coming about." The
  Utopian says merely, "If only," and escapes from time, death and judgment.
  That does not prevent the normal Utopian from assuming a certain exemplary
  attitude. If he does not warn and threaten us, he does not hesitate to
  reprove. At times, "If only" becomes "If only you would." It is just that
  note of moral edification that marks off the Utopian story from a third realm
  of imaginative escape, the fiction of irresponsible fantasy, mere wonder
  tales, like Münchhausen's Adventures, Gulliver's Travels, the voyage of St
  Brendan or the wanderings of Rabelais' Panurge in search of the Holy Bottle.
  There the effect sought is the unadulterated delight of pure astonishment.
  That sort of thing passes by insensible degrees into the inspired absurdity
  of Heath Robinson's Uncle Lubin and his pursuit of the Bag-Bird; that lovely
  book* which is at once as convincing and as incoherent as a preposterous
  dream. The Utopian writer does not want to be impossible. He is not a
  realist, no, but he is serious. His "If only&mdash;if only you would" is
  wistful....</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>The Adventures of Uncle Lubin</i> (1902) by the
  cartoonist and book-illustrator William Heath Robinson (1872-1944). ]</p>

  <p>Another sort of fable which releases us from reality lies closer to the
  Utopias. These are the worlds beyond death, the Heavens and the Paradises of
  simple-minded folk. Most heavens are restful. The Red Indians' Hunting
  Grounds and the Islamic Paradise have a certain flavor of active enjoyment
  about them, but the common atmosphere of Heaven is a glow of evening
  restfulness. There is a very charming and quite Utopian poem by Ford Madox
  Ford, called "On Heaven"&mdash;I don't know if you have read it&mdash;and
  there is a short story by Henry James, "The Great Good Place," both pervaded
  by the same serenity, and both extremely well worth hunting out and
  reading.</p>

  <p>There are two equally sound reasons why I should not attempt to give you a
  comprehensive account of all the Utopias in existence. One is that I haven't
  the necessary time, and the other that I haven't the necessary learning. It
  is altogether a vast literature. There are multitudes of Utopias I have heard
  about and never read, and there must be multitudes I have never heard of. To
  be a complete authority on Utopias would be the work of a lifetime. From the
  very beginnings of writing mankind has been revealing its distresses in these
  dreams. There were Babylonian and Egyptian Utopias. And the book of Isaiah is
  a dark texture of bitterness and foreboding, shot with wistful desire. You
  will remember that familiar passage:</p>

  <p class="quote">Come yee and let us go up the mountaine of the Lord, to the
  house of the God of Iacob, and he will teach us of his wayes, and we will
  walke in his pathes....And tree shall judge among the nations, and shall
  rebuke many people: and they shall beate their swords into plow-shares, and
  their speares into pruning hookes: nation shall not lift up sword against
  nation, neither shall they learne warre any more. 12:3-41</p>

  <p>There speaks a war-weary spirit, and again you will remember:</p>

  <p class="quote">For behold, I create new heavens, and a new earth: and the
  former shal not be remembred, nor come into mind. But bee you glad and
  rejoice for ever in that which I create: for beholde, I create Jerusalem a
  rejoicing, and her people a joy. And I wit rejoyce in Jerusalem, and joy in
  my people, and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the
  voice of crying. There shalbe no more thence an infant of dayes, nor an olde
  man, that bath not filled his dayes.... And they shall builde houses, and
  inhabite them, and they shal plant vineyards, and eate the fruit of them.
  They shal not build, and another inhabit: they shal not plant, and another
  eat:....mine elect shal long enjoy the worke of their hands. They shall not
  labour in vaine, nor bring forth for trouble.... The Wolfe and the lambe
  shall feede together, and the Iyon shall eate straw like the bullocke....
  They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountaine, sayth the LORD.
  Isaiah 65:17-251</p>

  <p>There you have the very quintessence of a Utopia. That millennial dream
  has never yet been realized. You will grasp its poignant quality if you will
  take the Book of Isaiah as one whole and read it through. You will find these
  passages I have quoted are set in a turmoil of violent realities, marching
  hosts, thundering chariots, walls cast down and captives driven into
  exile&mdash; slaughtering and frightfulness and vindictive punishments beyond
  measure....</p>

  <p>You will find the same reflection of a troubled world in the various
  Utopias scattered through the Dialogues of Plato. The Republic is a Utopia.
  It reflects the dissatisfaction of a fine and powerful mind, living in the
  bright light of that small, intelligent, Athenian community, at the failure
  of men to achieve justice, at the success of the demagogue and despot over
  the reasonable men, their betters. This problem of reconciling justice with
  freedom and good government is still one of our troubles, as perplexing among
  the dissensions of our Parties, Parliaments, creeds, classes, movements, and
  nations today, as ever it was in the Athenian democracy, 22 centuries ago.
  Plato found his solution in the Philosopher King, who was to reign from 35 to
  50, and then depart to the Islands of the Blest, receiving honor and exuding
  wisdom for all the rest of his days. Nowadays we have a little improved upon
  Plato, but the Utopias of our time are none the less a reflection of our
  distresses.</p>

  <p>The Critias is an unfinished Platonic Dialogue in which a quasi-Utopian
  story begins and breaks off abruptly, and that is very disappointing, because
  it was to tell how, thousands of years ago, the mighty vanished Empire of
  Atlantis made war upon the Athenian Republic under its Philosopher King, and,
  if the story had been concluded, we should have seen how the Utopian
  democracies fought for their free union and won the war.3 "If
  only&mdash;."</p>

  <p>It would have been pure Utopianism, because in the world of hard reality,
  the bickerings of the Grecian states were clearly preparing for their
  ultimate conquest by the Macedonians.</p>

  <p>Throughout the ages the Utopias reflect the anxieties and discontents
  amidst which they were produced. They are, so to speak, shadows of light
  thrown by darknesses. The more disturbed men's minds are, the more Utopias
  multiply. The Ages of Faith before the Renascence and the Reformation
  produced few fresh Utopias. Partly because they would have been suppressed,
  but mainly because the ideas of the Millennium and Heaven supplied the same
  imaginative need. Saint Augustine's City of God is a Utopian conception of
  human life brought into a unity under the rule of the Church. With the
  stimulation and disturbance of men's minds by the Renascence and the
  discovery of America and the Far East, Utopias sprang up everywhere. There
  were firstly Utopias of freedom and good conduct. Utopias that protest
  against fear. The Thelema of Rabelais was the greatest of these. "If only" we
  behaved without fear, without profiteering, freely and gallantly as ladies
  and gentlemen should&mdash;that was the theme of Thelema. The happy News from
  Nowhere of William Morris is another good example of that "If only&mdash;."
  Everybody was pleased to serve everybody, and nobody wanted to be paid any
  more than a gentleman wants a tip. I myself tried a little excursion of that
  sort, called In the Days of the Comet, but I do not think the Utopian side of
  it very good. The device I used was to wipe the Earth clean with the tail of
  a remarkable comet made of a sort of beneficent benzedrine gas, that cleared
  men's minds and hearts to a wonderful extent.</p>

  <p>But most of these later Utopias from the 17th century onward have been not
  so much of Utopias of conduct as Utopias of Organization. They include
  Campanella's City of the Sun, the first definite Socialism since Plato's
  Republic, and also there was the first of all Utopias to be called frankly
  no-where&mdash;the Utopia of Sir Thomas More.4 That dealt with unemployment.
  His Utopia was a distant island, and in those eventful centuries of voyages
  and discoveries, the 17th and 18th, all Utopias were islands and remote
  lands.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of the 19th century we began to realize that all the
  islands had been found and that the world was becoming one community.
  Blatchford's Merrie Englands came home for Utopia, and in Bellamy's famous
  Looking Backward, Utopia was the world. In 1904, A Modern Utopia, I made a
  sort of summary of Utopian ideas, in which I pointed out this now unavoidable
  universality. But still seeking an escape from material fact, I went, in Men
  Like Gods, right out of our time and space across the dimensions to an
  entirely different Universe.</p>

  <p>Side by side with these recent Socialist Utopias, another field of
  Utopianism was opening out. The wistfulness of the Socialist Utopias lay in
  saying "If only we organized society better," but these other Utopias I am
  coming to said, "If only we put our minds and our knowledge in order&mdash;."
  Knowledge is power. That was the dominant thought of Bacon's Atlantis, the
  greatest of the scientific Utopias.</p>

  <p>That Utopia of Bacon's has produced more in the way of real consequences
  than any other Utopia that was ever written. It carried out the teaching of
  that still greater and earlier Bacon, Roger Bacon, and it confessed that man
  is still an ignorant creature, who has everything to learn. It embodies a new
  conception in human life, the conception of continual organized research. All
  the other Utopias present islands, communities and worlds of happy and
  exemplary completion and self-satisfaction, but the Utopia of Francis Bacon
  is a world of seekers after knowledge, a world growing perpetually in
  knowledge and wisdom and incidentally growing in power. It is a world ruled
  by organized Science. And by Science we do not mean established knowledge,
  but the perpetual criticism, increase and diffusion of more knowledge and
  more. Perhaps a better word would be not Science but philosophy. It
  supplements the Utopia of Plato which would make the philosopher, king.
  Instead of that it tries out the idea of making not the philosopher but
  scientific philosophy, king.</p>

  <p>All scientific workers are Utopians after the school of Francis Bacon.
  That is why I am here in Australia talking to you. I came here to learn what
  I could from the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement
  of Science [,] which has just been meeting at Canberra. All the men and women
  in that Association, I warn you, are Utopians, and they believe their Utopia
  is real. They believe that this world of ours can only be put in order and
  kept in order by the perpetual refreshment of scientific thought. They
  believe as firmly as any human beings have ever believed, that swords can be
  beaten into plough-shares and spears into pruning-hooks, that nation need not
  lift up its hand against nation, nor should they learn war any more.</p>

  <p>But they do not prophesy that will certainly happen. They say, "If only
  you would."</p>
