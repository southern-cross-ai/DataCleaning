  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THESE twenty-nine papers do not profess to be a record or
  description of the Washington Conference. They give merely the impressions
  and fluctuating ideas of one visitor to that conference. They show the
  reaction of that gathering upon a mind keenly set upon the idea of an
  organized world peace; they record phases of enthusiasm, hope, doubt,
  depression and irritation. They have scarcely been touched, except to correct
  a word or a phrase here or there; they are dated; in all essentials they are
  the articles just as they appeared in the <i>New York World</i>, the
  <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, and the other American and European papers which
  first gave them publicity. It is due to the enterprise and driving energy of
  the <i>New York World</i>, be it noted, that they were ever written at all.
  But in spite of the daily change and renewal of mood and attitude, inevitable
  under the circumstances, they do tell a consecutive story; they tell of the
  growth and elaboration of a conviction of how things can be done, and of how
  they need to be done, if our civilization is indeed to be rescued from the
  dangers that encompass it and set again upon the path of progress. They
  record&mdash;and in a very friendly and appreciative spirit&mdash;the birth
  and unfolding of the "Association of Nations'' idea, the Harding idea, of
  world pacification, they note some of the peculiar circumstances of that
  birth, and they study the chief difficulties on its way to realization. It
  is, the writer believes, the most practical and hopeful method of attacking
  this riddle of the Sphinx that has hitherto been proposed.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap01"
     name="chap01">I. &mdash; THE IMMENSITY OF THE ISSUE<br>
  AND THE TRIVIALITY OF MEN</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, Nov 7</h3>

  <p class="first">THE conference nominally for the limitation of armaments
that now gathers
  at Washington may become a cardinal event in the history of mankind. It may
  mark a turning point in human affairs or it may go on record as one of the
  last failures to stave off the disasters and destruction that gather about
  our race.</p>

  <p>In August, 1914, an age of insecure progress and accumulation came to an
  end. When at last, on the most momentous summer night in history, the long
  preparations of militarism burst their bounds and the little Belgian village
  Vis&eacute; went up in flames, men said: "This is a catastrophe." But they
  found it hard to anticipate the nature of the catastrophe. They thought for
  the most part of the wounds and killing and burning of war and imagined that
  when at last the war was over we should count our losses and go on again much
  as we did before 1914.</p>

  <p>As well might a little shopkeeper murder his wife in the night and expect
  to carry on "business as usual" in the morning. "Business as
  usual"&mdash;that was the catchword in Britain in 1914; of all the catchwords
  of the world it carries now the heaviest charge of irony.</p>

  <p>The catastrophe of 1914 is still going on. It does not end; it increases
  and spreads. This winter more people will suffer dreadful things and more
  people will die untimely through the clash of 1914 than suffered and died in
  the first year of the war. It is true that the social collapse of Russia in
  1917 and the exhaustion of food and munitions in Central Europe in 1918
  produced a sort of degradation and enfeeble-ment of the combatant efforts of
  our race and that a futile conference at Versailles settled nothing, with an
  air of settling everything, but that was no more an end to disaster than it
  would be if a man who was standing up and receiving horrible wounds were to
  fall down and writhe and bleed in the dust. It would be merely a new phase of
  disaster. Since 1919 this world has not so much healed its wounds as realized
  its injuries.</p>

  <p>Chief among these injuries is the progressive economic breakdown, the
  magnitude of which we are only beginning to apprehend. The breakdown is a
  real decay that spreads and spreads. In a time of universal shortage there is
  an increasing paralysis in production; and there is a paralysis of production
  because the monetary system of the world, which was sustained by the honest
  co-operation of Governments, is breaking down. The fluctuations in the real
  value of money become greater and greater and they shake and shatter the
  entire fabric of social co-operation.</p>

  <p>Our civilization is, materially, a cash and credit system, dependent on
  men's confidence in the value of money. But now money fails us and cheats us;
  we work for wages and they give us uncertain paper. No one now dare make
  contracts ahead; no one can fix up a stable wages agreement; no one knows
  what one hundred dollars or francs or pounds will mean in two years'
  time.</p>

  <p>What is the good of saving? "What is the good of foresight? Business and
  employment become impossible. Unless money can be steadied and restored, our
  economic and social life will go on disintegrating, and it can be restored
  only by a world effort.</p>

  <p>But such a world effort to restore business and prosperity is only
  possible between govern-ments sincerely at peace, and because of the failure
  of Versailles there is no such sincere peace. Everywhere the Governments, and
  notably Japan and France, arm. Amidst the steady disintegration of the
  present system of things, they prepare for fresh wars, wars that can have
  only one end&mdash;an extension of the famine and social collapse that have
  already engulfed Russia to the rest of the world.</p>

  <p>In Russia, in Austria, in many parts of Germany, this social decay is
  visible in actual ruins, in broken down railways and suchlike machinery
  falling out of use. But even in Western Europe, in France and England, there
  is a shabbiness, there is a decline visible to any one with a keen
  memory.</p>

  <p>The other day my friend Mr. Charlie Chaplin brought his keen observant
  eyes back to London, after an absence of ten years.</p>

  <p>"People are not laughing and careless here as they used to be," he told
  me. "It isn 't the London I remember. They are anxious. Something hangs over
  them."</p>

  <p>Coming as I do from Europe to America, I am amazed at the apparent
  buoyancy and abundance of New York. The place seems to possess an
  inexhaustible vitality. But this towering, thundering, congested city, with
  such a torrent of traffic and such a concourse of people as I have never seen
  before, is, after all, the European door of America; it draws this
  superabundant and astounding life from trade, from a trade whose roots are
  dying.</p>

  <p>When one looks at New York its assurance is amazing; when one reflects we
  realize its tremendous peril. It is going on&mdash;as London is going
  on&mdash;by accumulated inertia. With the possible exception of London, the
  position of New York seems to me the most perilous of that of any city in the
  world. What is to happen to this immense crowd of people if the trade that
  feeds it ebbs? As assuredly it will ebb unless the decline of European money
  and business can be arrested, unless, that is, the world problem of trade and
  credit can be grappled with as a world affair.</p>

  <p>The world's economic life, its civilization, embodied in its great towns,
  is disintegrating and collapsing through the strains of the modern war threat
  and of the disunited control of modern affairs.</p>

  <p>This in general terms is the situation of mankind today; this is the
  situation, the tremendous and crucial situation, that President Harding, the
  head and spokesman of what is now the most powerful and influential state in
  the world, has called representatives from most of the states in the world to
  Washington to discuss.</p>

  <p>Whatever little modifications and limitations the small cunning of
  diplomatists may impose upon the terms of reference of the conference, the
  plain common sense of mankind will insist that its essential inquiry is,
  "What are we to do, if anything can possibly be done, to arrest and reverse
  the slide toward continuing war preparation and war and final social
  collapse?" And you would imagine that this momentous conference would gather
  in a mood of exalted responsibility, with every conceivable help and every
  conceivable preparation to grasp the enormous issues involved.</p>

  <p>Let us dismiss any such delusion from our minds.</p>

  <p>Let us face a reality too often ignored in the dignfied discussion of such
  business as this Washington Conference, and that is this: that the human mind
  takes hold of such very big questions as the common peace of the earth and
  the general security of mankind with very great reluctance and that it leaves
  go with extreme alacrity.</p>

  <p>We are all naturally trivial creatures. We do not live from year to year;
  we live from day to day. Our minds naturally take short views and are
  distracted by little, immediate issues. We forget with astonishing facility.
  And this is as true of the high political persons who will gather at
  Washington as it is of any overworked clerk who will read about the
  conference in a street car or on the way home to supper and bed. These big
  questions affect everybody, and also they are too big for anybody. A great
  intellectual and moral effect is required if they are to be dealt with in any
  effectual manner.</p>

  <p>I find the best illustration of this incurable drift toward triviality in
  myself. In the world of science the microscope helps the telescope and the
  infinitely little illuminates the infinitely great.</p>

  <p>Let me put myself under the lens: Exhibit 1&mdash;If any one has reason to
  focus the whole of his mental being upon this Washington Conference it is I.
  It is my job to attend to it and to think of it and of nothing else. Whatever
  I write about it, wise or foolish, will be conspicuously published in a great
  number of newspapers and will do much to make or mar my reputation.
  Intellectually, I am convinced of the supreme possibilities of the occasion.
  It may make or mar mankind. The smallest and the greatest of motives march
  together; therefore my self-love and my care for mankind. And the occasion
  touches all my future happiness.</p>

  <p>If this downward drift toward disorder and war is not arrested, in a few
  years' time it will certainly catch my sons and probably mutilate or kill
  them; and my wife and I, instead of spending our declining years in comfort,
  will be involved in the general wretchedness and possibly perish in some
  quite miserable fashion, as thousands of just our sort of family have already
  perished in Austria and Russia. This is indeed the outlook for most of us if
  these efforts to secure permanent peace which are now being concentrated at
  Washington fail.</p>

  <p>Here surely are reasons enough, from the most generous to the most
  selfish, for putting my whole being, with the utmost concentration, into this
  business. You might imagine I think nothing but conference, do nothing but
  work upon the conference.</p>

  <p>Well, I find I don't.</p>

  <p>Before such evils as now advance upon hu^ manity, man's imagination seems
  scarcely more adequate than that of the park deer I have seen feeding
  contentedly beside the body of a shot companion.</p>

  <p>I am, when I recall my behavior in the last few weeks, astonished at my
  own levity. I have been immensely interested by the voyage across the
  Atlantic; I have been tremendously amused by the dissertations of a number of
  fellow-travellers upon the little affair of Prohibition; I have been looking
  up old friends and comparing the New York City of to-day with the New York
  City#f fifteen years ago. I spent an afternoon loitering along Fifth Avenue,
  childishly pleased by the shops and the crowd, I find myself tempted to evade
  luncheon where I shall hear a serious discussion of the Pacific question,
  because I want to explore the mysteries of a chop suey without outside
  assistance.</p>

  <p>Yet no one knows better than I do that this very attractive, glitteringly
  attractive, thundering, towering city is in the utmost danger. Within a very
  few years the same chill wind of economic disaster that has wrecked
  Petersburg and brought death to Vienna and Warsaw may be rusting and
  tarnishing all this glistening, bristling vitality. In a little while, within
  my lifetime, New York City may stand even more gaunt, ruinous, empty and
  haunted than that stricken and terrible ruin, Petersburg.</p>

  <p>My mind was inadequate against the confident reality of a warm October
  afternoon, against bright clothes and endless automobiles, against the
  universal suggestion that everything would shine on forever. And my mind is
  something worse than thus inadequate; I find it is deliberately evasive. It
  tries to run away from the task I have set it. I find my mind, at the
  slightest pretext, slipping off from this difficult tangle of problems
  through which the Washington Conference has to make its way.</p>

  <p>For instance, I have got it into my head that I shall owe it to myself to
  take a holiday after the conference, and two beautiful words have taken
  possession of my mind&mdash;Florida and the Everglades. A vision of
  exploration amidst these wonderful sun-soaked swamps haunts me. I consult a
  guide book for information about Washington and the procedure of Congress,
  and I discover myself reading about Miami or Indian River.</p>

  <p>So it is we are made. A good half of those who read this and who have been
  pulling themselves together to think about the hard tasks and heavy dangers
  of international affairs will brighten up at this mention of a holiday in the
  Everglades&mdash;either because they have been there or because they would
  like to go. They will want to offer experiences and suggestions and recommend
  hotels and guides.</p>

  <p>And apart from this triviality of the attention, this pathetic disposition
  to get as directly as possible to the nearest agreeable thoughts which I am
  certain every statesman and politician at the conference shares in some
  measure with the reader and myself, we are also encumbered, every one of us,
  with prejudices and prepossessions.</p>

  <p>There is patriotism&mdash;the passion that makes us see human affairs as a
  competitive game instead of a common interest; a game in which "our side," by
  fair means or foul, has to get the better&mdash;inordinately&mdash;of the
  rest of mankind. For my own part, though I care very little for the British
  Empire, which I think a temporary, patched-up thing, I have a passionate
  pride in being of the breed that produced such men as Shakespeare, Milton,
  Bacon, Cromwell, Newton, Washington, Darwin, Nelson and Lincoln. And I love
  the peculiar humor and kindly temper of an English crowd and the soft beauty
  of an English countryside with a strong, possessive passion.</p>

  <p>I find it hard to think that other peoples matter quite as much as the
  English. I want to serve the English and to justify the English.
  Intellectually I know better, but no man's intelligence is continually
  dominant; fatigue him or surprise him, and habits and emotions take control.
  And not only that I have this bias which will always tend to make me run
  crooked in favor of my own people, but also I come to Washington with deep,
  irrational hostilities.</p>

  <p>For example: Political events have exasperated me with the present Polish
  Government. It is an unhappy thing that Poland should rise from being the
  unwilling slave of German and Russian reaction to become the willing tool of
  French reaction. But that is no reason why one should drift into a dislike of
  Poland and all things Polish, and because Poland is so ill-advised as to grab
  more than she is entitled to, that one should be disposed to give her less
  than she is entitled to. Yet' I do find a drift in that direction.</p>

  <p>And prejudice soon breaks away into downright quarrelsomeness. It is
  amusing or dis-tressing, as you will, to find how easily I, as a professional
  peacemaker, can be tempted into a belligerent attitude. "Of course," I say,
  ruffed by some argument, "if Japan chooses to be unreasonable"&mdash;</p>

  <p>I make no apologies for this autobiographical tone. It is easier and less
  contentious to dissect one's self than to set to work on any one else for
  anatomical ends. This is Exhibit No. 1. We are all like this. There are no
  demigods or supermen in our world superior to such trivialities, limitations,
  prejudices and patriotisms. We have all got them, as we have all got
  livers.</p>

  <p>Every soul that gathers in Washington will have something of that
  disposition to get away to the immediately pleasant, will be disposed to take
  a personal advantage, will have a bias for race and country, will have
  imperfectly suppressed racial and national animosities, will be mentally
  hurried and crowded. That mental hurrying and crowding has to be insisted
  upon.</p>

  <p>This will be a great time for Washington, no doubt, to have a very gay and
  exciting time. It becomes the focus of the worlds affairs. All sorts of
  interesting people are heading for Washington, bright-eyed and expectant.
  There will be lunches, dinners, receptions and such like social occasions in
  great abundance, dramatic, and encounters, flirtations, scandals, jealousies
  and quarrels. Quiet thought, reconsideration&mdash;will Washington afford any
  hole or cover for such things? A most distracting time it will be and it will
  be extraordinarily difficult to keep its real significance in mind.</p>

  <p>So let us repeat here its real significance.</p>

  <p>The great war has struck a blow at the very foundations of our
  civilization; it has shattered the monetary system which is the medium of all
  our economic life. A rotting down of civilization is spreading now very
  rapidly and nothing is being done to arrest it. Production stagnates and
  dwindles. This can only be restored by the frank collective action of the
  chief powers of the world.</p>

  <p>At present the chief powers of the world show no signs of the collective
  action demanded. They are still obsessed by old-fashioned ideas of national
  sovereignty and national competition, and though all verge on bankruptcy,
  they maintain and develop fresh armies and fleets. That is to say, they are
  in the preparatory stage of another war. So long as this divided and
  threatening state of affairs continues there can be no stability, no real
  general recovery; shortages will increase, famine will spread; towns, cities,
  communications will decay; increasing masses of starving unemployed will
  resort to more and more desperate and violent protests, until they assume a
  quasi-revolutionary character. Education will ebb, and social security
  dwindle and fade into anarchy. Civilization as we know it will go under and a
  new Dark Age begin.</p>

  <p>And this fate is not threatening civilization; it is happening to
  civilization before our eyes. The ship of civilization is not going to sink
  in five years 7 time or in fifty years' time. It is sinking now. Russia is
  under the water line; she has ceased to produce, she starves; large areas of
  Eastern Europe and Asia sink toward the same level; the industrial areas of
  Germany face a parallel grim decline; the winter will be the worst on record
  for British labor. The pulse of American business weakens.</p>

  <p>To face which situation in the world's affairs, this crowd of hastily
  compiled representatives, and their associates, dependents and satellites,
  now gathers at Washington. They are all, from President Harding down to the
  rawest stenographer girl, human beings. That is to say, they are all
  inattentive, moody, trivial, selfish, evasive, patriotic, prejudiced
  creatures, unable to be intelligently selfish even, for more than a year or
  so ahead, after the nature of our Exhibit No. 1.</p>

  <p>Every one has some sort of blinding personal interest to distort the
  realities that he has to face. Politicians have to think of their personal
  prestige and their party associations; naval and military experts have to
  think of their careers.</p>

  <p>One may argue it is as good a gathering as our present circumstances
  permit. Probably there is some good will for all mankind in every one who
  comes. Probably not one is altogether blind to the tremendous disaster that
  towers over us, but all are forgetful.</p>

  <p>And yet this Washington Conference may prove to be the nearest approach
  the human will and intelligence has yet made to a resolute grapple against
  fate upon this planet. We cannot make ourselves wiser than we are, but in
  this phase of universal danger we can at least school ourselves to the
  resolve to be</p>

  <p>charitable and frank with one another to the best of our ability, to be
  forgiving debtors, willing to retreat from hasty and impossible assumptions,
  seeking patience in hearing and generosity in action. High aims and personal
  humility may yet save mankind.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap02"
     name="chap02">II. &mdash; ARMAMENTS: THE FUTILITY OF MERE
LIMITATION</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, November 8</h3>

  <p class="first">IT would seem that the peculiar circumstances of its
meeting demand that
  the Washington Conference should begin with a foregone futility, the
  discussion of the limitation of armaments and of the restrictions of warfare
  in certain directions, while nations are still to remain sovereign and free
  to make war and while there exists no final and conclusive court of decision
  for international disputes except warfare.</p>

  <p>A number of people do really seem to believe that we can go on with all
  the various states of the earth still as sovereign and independent of each
  other as wild beasts in a jungle, with no common rule and no common law, and
  yet that</p>

  <p>we can contrive it that they will agree to make war only in a mild and
  mitigated fashion, after due notice and according to an approved set of
  regulations. Such ideas are quite seriously entertained and they are futile
  and dangerous ideas. A committee of the London League of Nations Union, for
  example, has been debating with the utmost gravity whether the use of poison
  gas and the sinking of neutral ships to enforce a blockade should be
  permitted and whether "all modern developments 99 in warfare should not be
  abolished. " The feasibility of preventing secret preparations and the
  advantages of surprise were also considered. 9 ' It is as if warfare was a
  game.</p>

  <p>It is a little difficult to reason respectfully against that sort of
  project. One is moved rather to add helpful suggestions in the same vein. As
  for example, that no hostilities shall be allowed to begin or continue except
  in the presence of a League of Nations referee, who shall be marked plainly
  on the chest and pants with the red cross of Geneva and who&mdash;for the
  convenience of aircraft&mdash;shall carry an open sunshade similarly adorned.
  He shall be furnished with a powerful whistle or hand trumpet audible above
  the noise of modern artillery, and military operations shall be at once
  arrested when this whistle is blown. Contravention of the rules laid down by
  the League of Nations shall be penalized according to the gravity of the
  offense, with penalties ranging from, let us say, an hour's free bombardment
  of the offender's position to the entire forces of the enemy being addressed
  very severely by the referee and ordered off the field.</p>

  <p>In the event of either combatant winning the war, outright by illegitimate
  means, it might further be provided that such combatant should submit to a
  humiliating peace, just as if the war had been lost.</p>

  <p>Unhappily war is not a game but the grimmest of realities, and no power on
  earth exists to prevent a nation which is fighting for existence against
  another nation from resorting to any expedient however unfair, cruel and
  barbarous to enforce victory or avert disaster. Success justifies every
  expedient in warfare, and you</p>

  <p>cannot prevent that being so. A nation, hoping to win and afterward make
  friends with its enemy or solicitous for the approval of some powerful
  neutral, may conceivably refrain from effective but objectionable expedients,
  but that is a voluntary and strategic restraint. The fact remains that war is
  an ultimate and illimitable thing; a war that can be controlled is a war that
  could have been stopped or prevented. If our race can really bar the use of
  poison gas it can bar the use of any kind of weapon. It is indeed easier to
  enforce peace altogether than any lesser limitation of war.</p>

  <p>But it is argued that this much may be true nevertheless, that if the
  nations of the world will agree beforehand not to prepare for particular
  sorts of war or if they will agree to reduce their military and naval
  equipment to a minimum, that this will operate powerfully in preventing
  contraventions and in a phase of popular excitement arresting the rush toward
  war. The only objection to this admirable proposal is that no power which has
  desires or rights that can only be satisfied or defended, so far as it knows,
  by war, will ever enter into such a disarmament agreement in good faith. Of
  course countries contemplating war and having no serious intention of
  disarming effectually will enter quite readily into conferences upon
  disarmament, but they will do so partly because of the excellent propaganda
  value of such a participation and mainly because of the chance it gives them
  of some restriction which will hamper a possible antagonist much more than it
  will hamper themselves. For instance, Japan would probably be very pleased to
  reduce her military expenditure to quite small figures if the United States
  reduced theirs to the same amount, because the cost per head of maintaining
  soldiers under arms is much less in Japan than in America; and she would be
  still more ready to restrict naval armament to ships with a radius of action
  of 2,000 miles or less because that would give her a free hand with China and
  the Philippines. That sort of haggling was going on between Britain and
  Germany at The Hague at intervals before the great war. Neither party
  believed in the peaceful intentions of the other nor regarded these
  negotiations as anything but strategic moves. And as things were in Europe it
  was difficult to regard them in any other way.</p>

  <p>No, the limitation of armaments quite as much as the mitigation of warfare
  is impossble until war has been made impossible, and then the complete
  extinction of armaments follows without discussion; and war can only be made
  impossible when the powers of the world have done what the thirteen original
  States of American Union found they had to do after their independence was
  won, and that is set up a common law and rule over themselves. Such a project
  is a monstrously difficult one no doubt, and it flies in the face of great
  masses of patriotic cant and of natural prejudices and natural suspicion, but
  it is a thing that can be done. It is the only thing that can be done to
  avert the destruction of civilization through war and war preparation.
  Disarmament and the limitation of warfare without such a merging of
  sovereignty look, at the first glance, easier and more modest proposals, but
  they suffer from the fatal defect of absolute impracticability. They are
  things that cannot be made working realities. A world that could effectually
  disarm would be a world already at one, and disarmament would be of no
  importance whatever. Given stable international relations, the world would
  put aside its armaments as naturally as a man takes off his coat in winter on
  entering a warm house.</p>

  <p>And as a previous article has pointed out, wars, preparations for war and
  the threat of war are only the more striking aspect of human disunion at the
  present time. The smashing up of the world's currency system and the
  progressive paralysis of industry that follows on that is a much more
  immediate disaster. That is rushing upon us. This war talk between Japan and
  America may end as abruptly as the snarling of two dogs overtaken by a flood.
  There may not be another great war after all, because both in Japan and
  America social disruption may come first. Upon financial and economic
  questions the powers of the earth must get together very quickly now or
  perish; the signs get more imperative every day; and if they get together
  upon these common issues, then they will have little reason or excuse for not
  taking up the merely international issues at the same time.</p>

  <p>There is a curious exaggeration of respect for patriotism and patriotic
  excesses in all these projects for disarmament and the mitigation of warfare.
  We have to "consider patriotic susceptibilities"; that is the stereotyped
  formula of objection to the plain necessity of overriding the present
  barbaric sovereignty of separate states by a world rule and a world law
  protecting the common interests of the common people of the world. In
  practice these "patriotic susceptibilities" will often be found to resolve
  themselves into nothing more formidable than the conceit and self-importance
  of some foreign office official. In general they are little more than a
  snarling suspiciousness of foreign people. Most people are patriotically
  excitable, it is in our human nature, but that no more excuses this excessive
  deference to patriotism than it would excuse a complete tolerance of boozing
  and of filthy vices and drunken and lustful outrages because we are all more
  or less susceptible to thirst and desire. And while there is all this
  deference for the most ramshackle and impromptu of nationalisms there is a
  complete disregard of the influence and of the respect due to one of the
  greatest and most concentrated interests of our modern world, the finance,
  the science, the experts, the labor, often very specialized and highly
  skilled, of the armament and munitions and associated trades and
  industries.</p>

  <p>So far as I can ascertain, the advocates of what I may call mere
  disarmament propose to scrap this mass of interests more or less completely,
  to put its tremendous array of factories, arsenals, dockyards and so forth
  out of action, to obliterate its wide-reaching net of financial
  relationships, to break up its carefully gathered staffs, and to pour all its
  labor, its trained engineers and sailors and gunners and so forth into the
  great flood of unemployment into which our civilization is already sinking.
  And they do not seem to grasp how subtle, various and effective the
  resistance of this great complex of capable human beings to any such
  treatment is likely to be. In my supply of League of Nations literature I
  find only two intimations of this real obstacle to the world common weal. One
  is a suggestion that there should be no private enterprise in the production
  of war material at all, and the other that armament concerns shall not own
  newspapers. As a Socialist I am charmed by the former proposal, which would
  in effect nationalize, among others, the iron and steel and chemical
  industries, but as a practical man I have to confess that the organization of
  no existing state is yet at the level of efficiency necessary if the transfer
  is to be a hopeful one, and so far as the newspaper restriction goes, it
  would surely pass the wit of man to devise rules that would prevent a great
  banking combination from controlling armament firms on the one hand while it
  financed newspapers on the other.</p>

  <p>Yet the fact remains that this great complex of interests, round and about
  the armaments interest, is the most real of all the oppositions to a world
  federation. It supplies substance, direction and immediate rewards to the
  frothy emotions of patriotism; it rules by dividing us and it realizes that
  its existence in its present form is conditional upon the continuance of our
  suspicions and divisions. It does not positively want or seek war, but it
  wants a continuing expectation of and preparation for war. On the other hand
  its ruling intelligences must be coming to understand that in the end it
  cannot escape sharing in the economic and social smash down to which we are
  all now sliding so rapidly. It is too high a type of organization to be
  altogether blind and obdurate. It will not, of course, be represented
  officially at Washington for what it is, but in the form of pseudo-patriotic,
  naval, military and financial experts it will be better represented than any
  other side of human nature. One of the most interesting things to do at the
  conference will be to watch its activities.</p>

  <p>How much can we common men ask for and hope for from this great power?
  Self extinction is too much&mdash;even if it were desirable.</p>

  <p>But it is reasonable to demand a deflection of its activities to meet the
  urgent needs of our present dangers. We do not want the extinction of this
  great body of business, metallurgical, chemical, engineering and disciplined
  activities, but we do want its rapid diversion from all too easily attained
  destructive ends to creative purposes now. A world peace scheme that does not
  open out an immediate prospect for the release of financial and engineering
  energy upon world-wide undertakings is a hopeless peace scheme. Enterprise
  must out. Were this world one federated state concerned about our common
  welfare there would be no over-whelming difficulty in canalizing all this
  force now spent upon armament in the direction of improved transport and
  communications generally into the making of great bridges, tunnels and the
  like, into the rebuilding of our cities upon better lines, into the
  irrigation and fertilization of the earth's deserts and so forth. The way to
  world peace lies not in fighting and destroying the armament interests but in
  turning them to world service.</p>

  <p>But to do such a thing requires a united financial and economic effort; it
  cannot be done nationally by little groups of patriots all scheming against
  one another. It must be big business for world interests, unencumbered by
  national frontiers, or it is impossible.</p>

  <p>All these considerations you see converge on the conclusion that there is
  no solution of the problem of war, no possibility of a world recovery, no
  possibility of arresting the rapid disintegration of our civilization, except
  a Pax Mundi, a federated world control, sufficiently authoritative to keep
  any single nation in order and sufficiently coherent to express a world idea.
  We need an effective world "Association of Nations," to use President
  Harding's phrase, or we shall perish. And even in this fantastic dream of
  Mere Disarmament, of a world of little independent states, all sovereign, all
  competing against each other and all carrying on a mean financial and
  commercial warfare against each other to the common impoverishment, all
  standing in the way of any large modern-spirited handling of modern needs,
  yet all remaining magically disarmed and never making actual war on each
  other&mdash;even if this dream were possible, it is still utterly
  detestable&mdash;more detestable even than our present dangers and miseries.
  For if there are any things in life worse than pain, fear and destruction,
  they are boredom, pettiness and inanity, and such would be the quality of
  such a world. However much the diplomatists at Washington may seek to ignore
  the fact, may fence their discussion within narrowly phrased agenda, and rule
  this, that and the other vital aspect outside the scope of the conference,
  the fact remains that there is no way out, no way of escape for mankind from
  the monstrous miseries and far more monstrous dangers of the present time
  except an organized international co-operation, based upon a frank and bold
  resolve to turn men's minds from ancient jealousies and animosities to the
  common aims and the common future of our race.</p>

  <p>If the Washington Conference cannot rise to the level of that idea, then
  it were better that the Conference never gathered together.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap03"
     name="chap03">III. &mdash; THE TRAIL OF VERSAILLES:<br>TWO GBEAT POWERS ARE
     SILENT AND ABSENT</small></a></h2>

  <p class="first">WASHINGTON, the guide books say, was planned by Major
Pierre Charles
  L'Enfant in imitation of Versailles. If so, it has broken away from his
  intentions. I know Versailles pretty well, and I have gone about Washington
  looking vainly for anything more than the remotest resemblance. There is
  something European about Washington, I admit, an Italianate largeness, as
  though a Eoman design has been given oxygen and limitless space. It is a
  capital in the expanded Latin style. It has none of the vertical uplift of a
  real American city. But Versailles!</p>

  <p>Versailles was the home and embodiment of the old French Grand Monarchy
  and of a Foreign Policy that sought to dominate, Frenchify and "Versaillize"
  the world. A visit to Versailles is part of one's world education, a visit to
  the rather faded, rather pretentious magnificence of its terraces, to that
  Hall of Mirrors, all plastered over with little oblongs of looking-glass,
  which was once considered so wonderful, to the stuffy, secretive royal
  apartments with their convenient back stairs, to the poor foolishness of the
  Queen's toy village, the Little Trianon. A century and a half ago the people
  of France, wasted and worn by incessant wars of aggression, weary of a
  Government that was an intolerable burden to them and a nuisance to all
  Europe, went to Versailles in a passion and dragged French Policy out of
  Versailles for a time.</p>

  <p>Unhappily it went back there.</p>

  <p>In 1871, when Germany struck down the tawdry imperialism of Napoleon III
  (who was also for setting up Emperors in the New World) the Germans had the
  excessive bad taste to proclaim a New German Empire in the Hall of Mirrors.
  So that Versailles became more than ever the symbol of the age-long, dreary,
  pitiful quarrel of the French and Germans for the inheritance of "the Empire"
  that has gone on ever since the death of Charlemagne. There the glory of
  France had shone; there the glory of France had been eclipsed. I visited
  Versailles one autumnal day in 1912, and it was then a rather mouldy,
  disheartened, empty, picturesque show place, pervaded by memories of
  flounces, furbelows, wigs and red heels and also by the stronger, less
  pleasant flavor of that later Prussian triumph.</p>

  <p>It was surely the least propitious place in the whole world for the making
  of a world peace in 1919. It was inevitable that there the Ehine frontier
  should loom larger than all Asia and that the German people should be kept
  waiting outside to learn what vindictive punishment victorious France
  designed for them.</p>

  <p>The Peace of Versailles was not a settlement of the world, it was the
  crowning of the French revanche. And since Russia had always been below the
  horizon of Versailles it was as inevitable that the Russian people, who had
  saved France from utter defeat in 1914, who had given far more dead to the
  war than France and America put together, and who had collapsed at last,
  utterly exhausted by their stupendous war efforts, should be considered
  merely as the defaulting debtors of France. Their Government had incurred
  vast liabilities chiefly in preparation for this very war which had restored
  France to her former glorious ascendancy over Germany. And now a new,
  ungracious Government in Russia not only declared it could not pay up but
  refused to pretend that it had ever meant to perform this impossible feat.
  There could be no dealing with such a Government. The German people and the
  Russian people alike had no voice at Versailles, and the affairs of the
  world were settled with a majestic disregard of these outcast and fallen
  powers.</p>

  <p>They were settled so magnificently and badly that now the Washington
  Conference, whatever limitations it may propose to set upon itself, has in
  effect to review and, if it can, mend or replace that appalling settlement.
  The Washington conference has practically to revise the verdicts of
  Versailles, in a fresher air and with a wider outlook.</p>

  <p>I do not know how near future historians may come to saying that the
  Washington conference was planned in imitation pf that Versailles conference,
  but it certainly does start out with one most unfortunate resemblance. There
  seems to be the same tacit assumption that it is possible to come to some
  permanent settlement of the world's affairs with no representation of either
  the German or the Russian people at the conference. The Japanese, the
  Italians, the French, the Americans and the British, assisted by modest
  suggestions from such small sections of humanity as China and Spanish
  America, are sitting down to arrangements that will amount practically to a
  settlement of the world's affairs, and they are doing so without consulting
  these two great peoples, and quite without their consent and assistance. This
  surely runs counter to the fundamental principle of both American and British
  political life&mdash;that is to say, the principle of government with the
  consent of the governed&mdash;and it is indeed an altogether deplorable
  intention. In some form these two great peoples will have to be associated
  with any permanent settlement, and it will be much more difficult to secure
  their assent to any arrangement arrived at without even their formal
  co-operation.</p>

  <p>It is necessary to remind ourselves of certain elementary facts about
  Germany and Russia and their position in the world today. They are facts
  within the knowledge of all, and yet they seem to be astonishingly forgotten
  in very much of the discussion of the Washington conference.</p>

  <p>First, let us recall certain points about Germany. The German people
  occupy the most central position in Europe; they exceed in numbers any other
  European people except the Russians; their educational level has been as high
  or higher than any other people in the world; they are, as a people, honest,
  industrious, and intelligent; upon their social and political well-being and
  economic prosperity the prosperity of Britain, Scandinavia, Russia,
  Italy&mdash;and in a lesser degree France&mdash;depends. It is impossible to
  destroy such a people, it is impossible to wipe them off the map, but it is
  possible to ruin them economically and socially. And if Germany is ruined
  most of Europe is ruined.</p>

  <p>Germany has been overthrown in a great war and it will be well to recall
  here certain elementary facts about that war. Under a particularly aggressive
  and offensive imperialism system the Germans were plunged into conflict with
  most of the rest of the civilized world. But it was repeatedly declared by
  the British and by the Americans, if not by others of the combatants, that
  they fought not against the German people but against this German
  imperialism. The British war propaganda in particular did its utmost to
  saturate Germany with that assurance and to hold out the promise of generous
  treatment and a complete restoration of friendship <i>provided there was a
  German renunciation of imperialism and militarism</i>.</p>

  <p>Germany, exhausted and beaten, surrendered in 1918 upon the strength of
  these promises and upon the similar promises implied in President Wilson's
  Fourteen Points. The declared ends of the war had been achieved. The Kaiser
  bolted, and Germany repented of him publicly and unequivocally.</p>

  <p>But the conference at Versailles treated these promises that had been made
  to Germany as mere "scraps of paper." The peace imposed upon the young German
  republic was a punitive peace, exactly as punitive as though there were still
  a Kaiser in Berlin; it was a vindicative reversal of the Franco-German treaty
  of 1871 without a shred of recognition or tolerance for the chastened Germany
  that faced her conquerors. The Germans were dealt with as a race of moral
  monsters, though no one in his senses really believes they are very
  different, man for man, from English, French or American people; every German
  was held to be individually responsible for the war, though every Frenchman,
  Englishman and American knows that when one's country fights one has to
  fight, and it is quite natural to fight for it whether it is in the right or
  not; and a sustained attack of oppressive occupations, dismemberment, and
  impossible demands was begun and still goes on upon the shattered German
  civilization&mdash;which is at least as vitally necessary to the world as the
  French. The British and French nationalist press openly confess that they do
  not intend to give Germany a chance of recovery. The European Allies have now
  been kicking the prostrate body of Germany for three years; in a little while
  they will be kicking a dead body; and since they are linked geographically to
  their victim almost as closely as the Siamese twins were linked together,
  they will share that victim's decay.</p>

  <p>It is high time that this barbaric insanity, this prolongation of the
  combat after surrender, should cease and that the best minds and wills of
  Germany and the very reasonable republican government she has set up for
  herself should be called into consultation. I could wish that Washington
  could so far rise above Versailles as presently to make that invitation.
  Sooner or later it will have to be made if the peace of the world is to be
  secured.</p>

  <p>The absence of Russia from the Washington conference is an even graver
  weakness. People seem to have forgotten altogether how the Russians bore the
  brunt of the opening years of the great war. Their rapid offensive in 1914
  saved Paris and saved the little British Army from a disastrous retreat to
  the sea. The debt of gratitude Britain and France owe to Russia's "Unknown
  Warrior," that poor unhonored hero and martyr, is incalculable. But for
  Russia Germany would probably have won the war outright before the end of
  1916. It was the blood and suffering of the Russian people saved victory for
  the Allies; those incredible soldiers fought often without artillery support,
  without rifle ammunition, without boots or food, under conditions almost
  inconceivable to the well-supplied French and British and Americans of the
  western front. And their tale of killed and wounded exceeds enormously that
  of any other combatant. In 1917 Russia collapsed; she was bled white, and she
  remained collapsed in spite of the sedulous kicking of her allies to rouse
  her to further efforts. The intolerable Rasputin-Czarism went down in the
  disaster. After a phase of extreme disorder, and very largely because of the
  British hesitation to support the Kerensky Government by bold naval action in
  the Baltic, the hard, tyrannous, doctrinaire government of the Bolsheviki
  took control.</p>

  <p>That government is a bad government; its faults are indeed of a different
  order but on the whole, I will admit, it is almost as bad as the former
  Czarist Government it superseded. Yet let us remember certain plain facts
  about it. It has remained in power to this day because it is a
  Russian-speaking government standing for a whole and undivided Russia, and
  the Russian people support it because it has defended Russia against the
  subsidized raiders of France and Britain, against the Poles and against the
  Estonians and against the Japanese and against every sort of outside
  interference with their prostrate country. They prefer fanatics to foreigners
  and Bolsheviks to brigands. Frenchmen or Americans in the same horrible
  position would probably make the same choice. The Entente, the Poles, a
  miscellany of adventurers, have given the Russians no breathing time to deal
  with their own Government in their own fashion. And now, caught by the
  misadventure of an unprecedented drought, millions of Russians in the regions
  disorganized by Kol-chak, Denikene and Wrangel, are starving to
  death&mdash;while Canada and America have wheat and corn to burn. There is
  even food to spare in some parts of Russia, but no adequate means of getting
  it to the starving provinces without outside assistance. And the Western
  World is letting these Russian millions starve because of the argumentative
  obstinacy of the Moscow Government, which hesitated for a time to acknowledge
  debts incurred by Russia&mdash;very largely for the military preparations
  which saved Europe&mdash;debts it is now inconceivable that Russia can ever
  under any circumstances pay, because of the pitiless resentment of the
  creditors of Russia. Yet the suffering of Russia cannot help the western
  money lender; they merely give him his revenge.</p>

  <p>But even if some millions of Russian men, women and children die this
  winter and are added to the count of those who have already perished through
  the war&mdash;the war that saved Paris from Berlin&mdash;it does not follow
  that Russia will die. Peoples are not killed in this fashion. These
  distresses will not alter the fact that the Russians are the most numerous
  people in Europe, and a people of unexampled gifts and tenacity. Their
  magnificent resistance to outside interference since 1914 and their
  toleration of the Bolshevik Government when division would have been as fatal
  to them as it has been in China, is a proof of their solidarity and
  instinctive political wisdom. There are as many Russians as there are people
  in the United States of America, and they occupy an area as great and far
  richer in undeveloped resources. In spite of the monstrous Czarist Government
  which treated elementary education as an offense against the State, the prose
  literature, the drama, the music, the pictorial art&mdash;even the science of
  the Russians during the last hundred years&mdash;all this compares favorably
  with that of the United States. These Russians are indeed one of the very
  greatest of people a;nd they have survived tragic experiences that might well
  have destroyed any other race. And Washington, I gather, proposes to settle
  the peace of Europe, Asia and the Pacific without them.</p>

  <p>There is, I know, a very strong case to excuse Washington from sending an
  invitation to the existing Russian Government. I would be the last person in
  the world to minimize the difficulties the Bolshevik Government puts in the
  way of any fair dealings with the western powers; it is bound by its
  Communist theory not to recognize them fairly and to make gestures of
  preparation for their overthrow. In addition to its general theoretical
  obduracy Moscow is also afflicted with a particularly obdurate, pedantic,
  argumentative and disastrous Foreign Minister, Chicherin. But practical
  necessity knows no theories and the Bolshevik Government, if only it can save
  its face, is now extraordinarily anxious for recognition from and dealings
  with the western Governments.</p>

  <p>I do not see why the western Governments, having regard to the needs of
  Russia, should try to outdo the Bolsheviks in obstinacy, pedantry and
  cruelty, nor why they should not make an honest attempt to get along with the
  de facto government until it develops naturally into something else. For such
  a development only a rough working peace is wanted. Given that, and a release
  from impossible debts, Russia, relieved forever from the black curse of
  Czar-ism, will go right on to become a land of restored cultivation, of
  resuscitated mines and presently of reawakening towns, a democratic land of
  common people more like the free, poor, farming, prospecting and developing
  United States of 1840 than anything else in history.</p>

  <p>So long as Russia suffers the Bolshevik Government I think Washington
  ought to suffer it, but perhaps in that opinion I go beyond the possibilities
  of the case. Then I suggest that at least Washington ought to set up some
  well-informed lawyer, some bureau, to play the part of the Russian advocate
  at the conference. If Russia is not to be allowed a vote in the decision of
  things, let her at least be heard.</p>

  <p>Consider what the future must hold for this great people, and mark the
  amazing folly of the insults and evils we heap upon their land. Look it up in
  an atlas or encyclopaedia. Measure what it is we ignore. In a score of years
  Russia may be a renascent land as vigorous as the United States in 1840. In a
  century she may be as great and powerful and civilized as any state on earth.
  For such powers as France and Britain and Japan to sit in council upon the
  fate of the world without her is as if, in the dark years of 1863 and 1864,
  they had sat in council upon the future of America without the United States.
  Indeed, something of the sort did happen in those dark years; France, I
  recall, sent troops and munitions into Mexico, as recently she has sent them
  into Poland and South Russia. And somewhere in the world there is a grave,
  the grave of a "white hope," a reactionary puppet who was to have restored
  Mexico to the European system&mdash;the friend of the Emperor Napoleon the
  Third, the Emperor Maximilian.</p>

  <p>When I was a small boy learning.the rudiments of geography, the earth was
  presented to me in two hemispheres, the Old World and the new. Not once or
  twice only has America vindicated her right to that title. Will Washington
  confirm that great tradition and open a way of escape now from the tangled
  narrowness of Versailles f Are Germany and Russia to perish amid the
  incurable quarrels of the Old World or find their salvation in the New?</p>

     name="chap04">IV. &mdash; THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER OF THE GREAT WAR</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, November 11</h3>

  <p class="first">BRITAIN, France, Italy and now the people of the United
States, have
  honored and buried the bodies of certain Unknown Soldiers, each according to
  their national traditions and circumstances. Canada, I hear, is to follow
  suit.</p>

  <p>So the world expresses its sense that in the great war the only hero was
  the common man. Poor Hans and poor Ivan lie rotting yet under the soil of a
  hundred battlefields, bones and decay, rags of soiled uniform and fragments
  of accoutrements, still waiting for monuments and speeches. Yet they too were
  mothers' sons, kept step, obeyed orders, went singing into battle, and knew
  the strange intoxication of soldierly fellowship and the sense of devotion to
  something much greater than themselves.</p>

  <p>In Arlington Cemetery soldiers of the Confederate South lie honored
  equally with the Federal dead, the right or wrong of their cause altogether
  forgotten and only their sacrifice remembered. A time will come when we shall
  cease to visit the crimes and blunders and misfortunes of their Governments
  upon the common soldiers and poor folk of Germany and Russia, when our
  bitterness will die out and we shall mourn them as we mourn our own, as souls
  who gave their lives and suffered greatly in one universal misfortune.</p>

  <p>A time will come when these vast personifications of conflict, the Unknown
  British Soldier, the Unknown American Soldier, the Unknown French Soldier,
  etc., will merge into the thought of a still greater personality, the
  embodiment of 20,000,000 separate bodies and of many million broken lives,
  the Unknown Soldier of the great war.</p>

  <p>It would be possible, I suppose, to work out many things concerning him.
  We could probably find out his age and his height and his weight and such
  like particulars very nearly.</p>

  <p>We could average figures and estimates that would fix such matters within
  a very narrow range of uncertainty. In race and complexion, I suppose he
  would be mainly North European; North Russian, German, Frankish, North
  Italian, British and American elements would all have the same trend toward a
  tallish, fairish, possibly blue-eyed type; but also there would be a strong
  Mediterranean streak in him, Indian and Turkish elements, a fraction of
  Mongolian and an infusion of African blood&mdash;brought in not only through
  the American colored troops but by the free use by the French of their
  Senegalese.</p>

  <p>None of these factors would be strong enough to prevent his being mainly
  Northern and much the same mixture altogether as the American citizen of 1950
  is likely to be. He would be a white man with a touch of Asia and a touch of
  color. And he would be young&mdash;I should guess about twenty-one or twenty-
  two&mdash;still boyish, probably unmarried rather than married, with a father
  and mother alive and with the memories and imaginations of the home he was
  born in still fresh and vivid in his mind when he died. We could even, I
  suppose, figure in general terms how he died. He was struck in daylight amid
  the strange noises and confusion of a modern battlefield by something out of
  the unknown &mdash;bullet, shell fragment or the like. At the moment he had
  been just a little scared&mdash;every one is a little scared on a
  battlefield&mdash;but much more excited than scared and trying hard to
  remember his training and do his job properly. When he was hit he was not so
  much hurt at first as astonished. I should guess that the first sensation of
  a man hard hit on a battlefield is not so much pain as an immense
  chagrin.</p>

  <p>I suppose it would be possible to go on and work out how long it was
  before he died after he was hit, how long he suffered and wondered, how long
  he lay before his ghost fell in with that immense still muster in the shades,
  those millions of his kind who had no longer country to serve nor years of
  life before them, who had been cut off as he had been cut off suddenly from
  sights and sounds and hopes and passions. But rather let us think of the
  motives and feelings that had brought him, in so gallant and cheerful a frame
  of mind, to this complete sacrifice.</p>

  <p>What did the Unknown Soldier of the great war think he was doing when he
  died? What did we, we people who got him into the great war and who are still
  in possession of this world of his, what did we persuade him to think he was
  doing and what is the obligation we have incurred to him to atone for his
  death, for the life and sunlight he will know no more?</p>

  <p>He was still too young a man to have his motives very clear. To conceive
  what moved him and what he desired is a difficult and disputable task. M.
  George Nobelmaire at a recent meeting of the League of Nations Assembly
  declared that he had heard French lads whisper'" Vive la France I" and die.
  He suggested that German boys may have died saying, ' i Colonel, say to my
  mother, 'Vive PAllemagne! , Possibly. But the French are trained harder in
  patriotism than any other people. I doubt if it was the common mood. It was
  certainly not the common mood among the British.</p>

  <p>I cannot imagine many English boys using their last breath to say "Rule
  Britannia!" or "King George for Merry England!" Some of our young men swore
  out of vexation and fretted; some, and it was not always the youngest, became
  childish again and cried touchingly for their mothers; many maintained the
  ironical flippancy of our people to the end; many died in the vein of a young
  miner from Durham with whom I talked one morning in the trenches near
  Martinpuich, trenches which had been badly "strafed" overnight. War, he said,
  was a beastly job, "but we've got to clean this up." That is the spirit of
  the lifeboat man or fireman. That is the great spirit. I believe that was far
  nearer to the true mind of the Unknown Soldier than any tinpot Viva-ing of
  any flag, nation or empire whatever.</p>

  <p>I believe that when we generalize the motives that took the youth who died
  in the great war out of the light of life and took them out at precisely the
  age when life is most desirable, we shall find that the dominating purpose
  was certainly no narrow devotion to the "glory" or "expansion" of any
  particular country, but a wide-spirited hostility to wrong and oppression.
  That is clearly shown by the nature of the appeals that were made in every
  country to sustain the spirit of its soldiers.</p>

  <p>If national glory and patriotism had been the ruling motive of these young
  men, then manifestly their propaganda would have concerned themselves mainly
  with national honor and flag idolatry. But they did not do so. Nowadays flags
  fly better on parades and stoop fronts than on battlefields. The war
  propagandas dwelt steadily and insistently upon the wickedness and
  unrighteousness of the enemy, upon the dangers of being overwhelmed by
  foreign tyranny, and particularly upon the fact that the enemy had planned
  and made the war. These boys fought best on that&mdash;everywhere.</p>

  <p>So far as the common men in every belligerent country went, therefore, the
  great war was a war against wrong, against force, against war itself.
  Whatever it was in the thoughts of the diplomatists, it was that in the minds
  of the boys who died. In the minds of these young and generous millions who
  are personified in the Unknown Soldier of the great war, in the minds of the
  Germans and Russians who fought so stoutly, quite as much as the Americans,
  British, French or Italians, the war was a war to end war.</p>

  <p>And that marks our obligation.</p>

  <p>Every speech that is made beside the graves of these Unknown Soldiers who
  lie now in the comradeship of youthful death, every speech which exalts
  patriotism above peace, which hints at reparations and revenges, which cries
  for mean alliances to sustain the traditions of the conflict, which exalts
  national security over the common welfare, which wags the "glorious flag" of
  this nation or that in the face of the universal courage and tragedy of
  mankind, is an insult and an outrage upon the dead youth who lies below. He
  sought justice and law in the world as he conceived these things, and whoever
  approaches his resting place unprepared to serve the establishment of a world
  law and world justice, breathing the vulgar cants and catchwords of a
  patriotism outworn and of conflicts that he died to end, commits a monstrous
  sacrilege and sins against all mankind.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap05"
     name="chap05">V. &mdash; THE PRESIDENT AT ARLINGTON</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, November 11</h3>

  <p class="first">I AM writing this just after my return from the funeral, in
the National
  Cemetery, of the American Unknown Soldier at Arlington, a very stately and
  moving ceremony, under the bright blue sky and the cold, keen air of a
  Virginia November day. The body had been lying in state at the Capitol and it
  was carried through Washington to the cemetery at the head of a great
  procession in which the Supreme Court, the Cabinet, Senators, members of the
  House of Representatives, war veterans and a multitude of societies marched
  on foot, a march of nearly two hours and a half duration. Much of this
  gathering was of the substance of all such processions, but one or two of the
  contingents were rich with association and suggestion.</p>

  <p>There were fifty or sixty, I should guess, very old men, bent, white-
  headed&mdash;one with a conspicuous long, white beard&mdash;veterans of a
  civil war that was fought out to an end before I was born. They came close to
  a contingent of men who had been specially decorated in the great war, erect
  and eager, still on the better side of the prime of life. These older men had
  fought in a great fight against a division, a separation that today, thanks
  to their sacrifice, has become inconceivable. They had fought to seal the
  Federal Union of what were else warring States. The young men who marched
  before them had fought in a war upon the greater stage of the whole world.
  Some day the tale of those abundant heroes will have shrunken to the
  dimensions of that little band of pathetic and glorious old men. Will they
  live to as complete an assurance that their cause also has been won forever,
  the newer veterans of the greater union that has yet to come?</p>

  <p>There were many points of contrast between the ceremony I have just
  witnessed in the graceful marble amphitheatre in the beautiful Virginian open
  country and the burials that have taken place in the very hearts of London,
  Paris and Rome. In the face of a common identity of idea, they mark an
  essential difference in the nature of the occasion.</p>

  <p>Thursday I went to see the people who were filing past the flag-covered
  coffin. It was a crowd fairly representative, I thought, of the Washington
  population as one sees it on the streets; all classes were represented, but
  chiefly it consisted of that well-dressed, healthy looking middle class sort
  of people who predominate in the streets of most American cities. They came
  to honor a national hero, the personification of American courage and
  loyalty. Few, I think, were actual mourners of a dead soldier. The couples
  and groups of people I saw hurrying up the sloping paths to the entrance of
  the Capitol, filing up the steps to the rotunda or dispersing on the other
  side were characterized by a sort of bright eagerness and approval.</p>

  <p>They contrasted very strongly with my memory of the great column of still
  and mournful people under the dark London sky, eight deep, stretching all up
  Whitehall and down Northumberland Avenue and along the Embankment for a great
  distance, a column which moved on slowly, step by step, and which faded away
  at night to be replaced by fresh mourners on the morrow to do honor to the
  Unknown Warrior in London. That crowd, with its wreaths and flowers,
  represented the families, the lovers, the sisters and friends of perhaps a
  quarter of a million of dead men from London and the south and centre of
  England; the massed, mute tragedy of its loss was overwhelming. It reduced
  all the ceremony that had gathered it to comparative unimportance. But the
  remote distances of America forbade any such concentration of sorrow. There
  may have been the relations and friends of perhaps a thousand men upon the
  scene at Arlington. The loss to the District of Columbia itself was less than
  six hundred killed. A group of wounded men in the amphitheatre struck the
  most intimate note. The rest of the gathering at Arlington shared a less
  personal grief. They were sympathizers rather than sufferers.</p>

  <p>Because of this emotional difference, the Arlington ceremony presented
  itself primarily as a ceremony. For most there it was a holiday, a fine and
  noble holiday, but a holiday. By it, America did not so much mourn the
  tragedy of war as seek to arouse itself to that tragedy. Everywhere the Stars
  and Stripes, the most decorative and exhilarating of national flags, waved
  and fluttered, and an irresistible expression of America's private life and
  buoyant well-being mingled in the proceedings. For most of the gathering that
  coffin under the great flag held nothing they had ever touched personally; it
  was not America's lost treasure of youth, but rather a warning of the fate
  that may yet overtake the youth of America if war is not to end. At
  Arlington, throughout the length and breadth of America, when for two minutes
  at mid-day all work and movement stopped and America stood still, an
  innumerable host of fathers and mothers and wives and friends could whisper
  thanks to God in their hearts that their sons and their beloved remained
  alive.</p>

  <p>And I suppose it is largely because America is still so much less war-
  stricken than any of the other belligerents of the great war that so much
  more powerful a sense of will was apparent in all these proceedings. The
  burial of the Unknown Soldier in America was not a thing in itself as it was
  in London, in Paris or Rome; it was a solemn prelude to action, the action of
  the great conference which is to seek peace and enduring peace for all
  mankind. This note was struck even in the Chaplain's opening invocation. He
  said:</p>

  <p>"Facing the events of the morrow, when from the workbench of the world
  there will be taken an unusual task, we ask that Thou wilt accord exceptional
  judgment, foresight and tactfulness of approach to those who seek to bring
  about a better understanding among men and nations to the end that discord,
  which provokes war, may disappear and that there may be world
  tranquillity."</p>

  <p>And the very fine oration of President Harding, following closely upon
  this line.</p>

  <p>I saw the President for the first time at Arlington. He is a very big,
  fine-looking man and his voice is a wonderful instrument. He spoke slowly and
  very distinctly, his gestures admirably controlled. He is&mdash;how can I say
  it?&mdash;more statuesque than any of the American Presidents of recent
  times, but without a trace in his movements or appearance of posturing or
  vanity. Men say he is a sincerely modest man, determined to do the best that
  is in him and at once appalled and inspired by the world situation in which
  he finds himself among the most prominent figures. Not only in its main
  circumstances but in many of its incidents is the position of the President
  of the United States appalling. The President stood in the apse to the right
  of the Unknown Soldier and to the other side of him was a black box upon a
  stand, a box perhaps two feet by one. This was the receiver that was to carry
  his voice, intensely amplified, to still greater gatherings in New York, in
  San Francisco and over the whole United States. Never was human utterance so
  magnified. Every syllable, every slip was recorded. He slipped once at an
  antithesis and was obliged to repeat. From the Atlantic to the Pacific that
  slip was noted.</p>

  <p>I have heard much detraction of the President both before I came to
  America and since I have been here, but here I have found also a growing and
  spreading belief in him. And this address of his, rhetorical though it was in
  a simple and popular American way, was nevertheless a very dignified address
  and one inspired by a spirit that is undeniably great. Here is a fine
  saying:</p>

  <p>"His patriotism was none less if he craved more than triumph of country;
  rather, it was greater if he hoped for a victory for all human kind. Indeed,
  I revere that citizen whose confidence in the righteousness of his country
  inspired belief that its triumph is the victory of humanity.</p>

  <p>"This American soldier went forth to battle with no hatred for any people
  in the world, but hating war and hating the purpose of every war for
  conquest."</p>

  <p>We are to seek "the rule under which reason and righteousness shall
  prevail." There is to be "the commanding voice of a conscious civilization
  against armed warfare," "a new and lasting era of peace on earth." And with a
  fine instinct for effect the President ended his oration with the Lord's
  Prayer, with its appeal for one universal law for mankind: "Thy kingdom come
  on earth...."</p>

  <p>Every other gossip tells you that President Harding comes from Main Street
  and repeats the story of Mrs. Harding saying: "We're just folk." If President
  Harding is a fair sample of Main Street, Sinclair Lewis has not told us the
  full story and Main Street is destined to save the world.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap06"
     name="chap06">VI. &mdash; THE FIRST MEETING</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, November 13</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was difficult at first to imagine the conference as
anything more than
  an admirably well managed social occasion.</p>

  <p>Continental Hall is a quite charming building, not too big for intimacy,
  not too small for a sufficient gathering of people. The chief members of the
  delegations had still to assemble; they were to sit at green baize covered
  tables in the body of the hall. About this central arena sat the massed
  attaches, and under the galleries the press representatives. In the boxes
  clustered the ladies of the diplomatic world. Members of the House of
  Representatives, the Senators, their friends and a sprinkling of privileged
  people occupied the big galleries above.</p>

  <p>There was a great chatter of conversation when I entered. Everybody was
  greeting friends, flitting from group to group. It was one of those
  gatherings where everybody seemed to know everybody. Socially, it was
  extraordinarily like a very smart first night in a prominent London
  theatre.</p>

  <p>"Last time I came to America," I found myself saying, "I brought a silk
  hat and morning coat, and never wore them once. Now everybody seems to be
  wearing a morning coat and a silk hat." It was the sort of occasion one
  dresses for. And that was the tone of the conversation.</p>

  <p>It was difficult to believe that this gathering could be the beginning of
  anything of supreme historical importance.</p>

  <p>Came a slight hush in the conversation. The delegates appeared, all with
  tremendously familiar faces taken out of the illustrated papers. They
  disposed themselves in their seats in leisurely fashion. One seat remained
  vacant for a time&mdash;the seat of the President. Then appeared President
  Harding, and there was a great clappifig of hands. It became more and more
  like a first night. Then a hushing of enthusiasm, and silence, and he
  spoke.</p>

  <p>It was a fine speech, less ornate and more direct than the Arlington
  oration. And the galleries above, behaving more and more like a first night
  audience, interrupted with rounds of applause whenever there were definite
  allusions to disarmament. He finished and declared the conference open and
  departed. Mr. Balfour followed, echoing the President's sentiments in a few
  well chosen words and proposing Secretary Hughes for the Chairman of the
  conference.</p>

  <p>The Hall became aware of a check in the onward flow of the proceedings. An
  interpreter got up and repeated Mr. Balfour's speech in French for the
  benefit of the French delegation. He had made a shorthand note as Mr. Balfour
  spoke. This, we learned, was to be the procedure throughout the conference.
  Every speech, question and interruption was to be dealt with in this
  interlinear manner. Fortunately, it was not necessary to do this in the case
  of the President's address, nor was it necessary in the case of the address
  of Secretary Hughes, which was now impending because these had already been
  printed and distributed and a translation made of them.</p>

  <p>Their linguistic isolation is likely to prove unfortunate for the French.
  The Belgian, the Dutch, the Chinese, Japanese and Portuguese delegations all
  speak in English and listen to the English speeches. Consequently, the French
  are in a position in which they seem to be the most foreign people present.
  This must be disconcerting to them now.</p>

  <p>It will be much more disconcerting if, at a later stage, German delegates
  speaking English should appear upon some extension or side committee of the
  conference. But I do not see how it can be avoided. The French are a little
  out of touch in the conference because of this; they must be much more out of
  touch with the incessant conversation in clubs and at dinner tables and
  everywhere in Washington, which makes the atmosphere in which the conference
  is working.</p>

  <p>This, however, is a note by the way. Secretary Hughes took the chair and
  delivered his address. It was a very carefully arranged surprise and its
  effect was really dramatical. It jumped the conference abruptly from the fine
  generalizations that had hitherto engaged it to immediately practical things.
  Secretary Hughes sketched out what was evidently a carefully worked out
  scheme, a most explicit scheme, for the complete cessation of naval armament
  competition.</p>

  <p>America wanted at the very outset, he said, to convince the world that she
  meant business in the conference, and so she had taken this unexpected step
  of putting immediate practical proposals upon the table. She would scrap
  completely all the ships she had still under construction and all her older
  ships and she would discontinue all naval construction for ten years if
  Britain and Japan would do the same.</p>

  <p>She proposed that the naval strength of the three powers concerned should
  remain for ten years in the ratio of: Britain, 22; America, 18, and Japan,
  10. In other words, she proposed so to fix things that no two of these three
  powers can wage a conclusive naval war against each other, but with America
  and Britain in a position to do so jointly against Japan and with Japan at a
  great disadvantage against America, even if she were to risk an inconclusive
  war with America on the chance of Britain's not coming in. And having
  unfolded this scheme, Secretary Hughes concluded.</p>

  <p>We were a little stunned. We had expected the opening meeting to be
  preliminary, to stick to generalities. After Secretary Hughes had finished,
  there was a feeling that we wanted to go away and think. But.the members of
  the House of Eepresentatives were enjoying an unwonted sense of being in the
  gallery, quite irresponsibly in the gallery, with somebody else upon the
  floor. They burst in upon our statesmanlike thoughts below with loud cries
  for "Briand!"</p>

  <p>The atmosphere of friendly festival was reestablished. M. Briand spoke
  eloquently&mdash;saying nothing whatever about the proposals of Secretary
  Hughes&mdash;and sat down, and his still quite abstract praises of peace were
  translated into English.</p>

  <p>"Japan!" shouted the members of the House of Representatives, a theatre
  gallery now in full cry. Japan spoke in English and its sentiments were
  translated into French for the benefit of the foreigners. Japan expressed
  admirable sentiments and said nothing whatever about the proposals of
  Secretary Hughes.</p>

  <p>Thereafter it would have been discourteous not to call for something from
  Italy, China, Belgium, Holland and Portugal. They all spoke in English, even
  Belgium spoke in English, and what they said was translated into French.
  Nobody said anything whatever about the proposals of Secretary Hughes. The
  gallery applauded each speech heartily and the atmosphere of a first night
  was completely restored. We dispersed to luncheons and tea parties and to
  talk before we wrote about it. And as we tried to get it into focus in our
  minds it became clear that much more than a ceremonial opening of the
  conference had occurred.</p>

  <p>Secretary Hughes has made proposals that challenge the whole situation in
  the Pacific. For if Japan accepts them&mdash;I do not see how they could be
  otherwise than acceptable to the British&mdash;it puts Japan to so definite
  and permanent a disadvantage that it amounts to an abandonment on the part of
  Japan of the idea of fighting a war on the Pacific except as the last
  desperate defensive resort under the pressure of an unavoidable attack, and
  Japan can abandon that idea only if she can see her way clearly without a war
  to all that she believes to be vitally necessary to her.</p>

  <p>It is possible to say that Secretary Hughes has narrowed down the work of
  the conference by this sudden focusing of attention upon naval warfare and
  Japan. But I do not think that is the case. The challenge he has made cannot
  be taken up until a number of associated issues are settled. Certainly his
  proposals have precipitated the work of the conference from the clouds and
  beautiful generalities to the earth and very concrete realities.</p>

  <p>"You accept these proposals," America says in effect. "If not, why
  not?"</p>

  <p>Japan must accept or reply so and so. So from armaments we shall get to
  the aims behind armaments; for no battleship is launched except against a
  specific antagonist and for a specific end. And in the matter of aims also
  the conference will presently have to consider what each power must scrap for
  the common good and what it may be permitted to keep for its own
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Since Secretary Hughes made it clear that the conference is to approach
  the inevitable general discussion of world peace by way of the sea and the
  Pacific, since for a time France and Europe generally will sit somewhat out
  of the limelight, it will be well, perhaps, if in my next article I discuss a
  few elementary considerations about Japan.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap07"
     name="chap07">VII. &mdash; WHAT IS JAPAN?</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, November 15</h3>

  <p class="first">OF ALL the national delegations assembled here in
Washington, the most
  acutely scrutinized, the most discussed and probably the least understood is
  the Japanese. The limelight gravitates toward it, moved, one feels, not so
  much by an extreme respect as by an inordinate curiosity.</p>

  <p>Of only one other people&mdash;I write as a spectator from
  overseas&mdash;does one feel the same sense of the possibility of
  dramatically unexpected things, and that is the Americans. The Japanese, we
  feel, we have not found out, and the Americans, we feel, have not found out
  themselves. Already the Americans have sprung one great surprise upon the
  conference. Britain, France, Italy and the other powers in attendance are
  comparatively calculable&mdash;so far as their representation goes. But Japan
  is different; it is not built upon the same lines, it follows different
  laws.</p>

  <p>I went on Sunday night to the press reception at the Japanese
  headquarters. The Ambassador is a buoyant man of the world, speaking
  excellent English and thoroughly acclimatized to an American press gathering.
  But many of the Japanese faces about him set my imagination busy, putting
  them back into the voluminous robes and the sashes holding the double swords
  with which I had first met them long ago in Japanese prints, and which would
  have become them so much better.</p>

  <p>Admiral Kato spoke in Japanese and Prince Tokugawa in English; they
  welcomed the Hughes proposals with warm generalities and hopes for
  peace&mdash;as we all hope for peace&mdash;with insufficient particulars. I
  got no conversation with any Japanese; they were not talking to us; they did
  not want to talk; it was a reception of hearty politeness and no exchanges. I
  found myself falling back upon an earlier impression.</p>

  <p>Some weeks ago I had a very illuminating talk in my garden at home with
  two Japanese visitors, Mr. Mashiko and Mr. Negushi, who had come to discuss
  various educational ideas with me. And they told me things that seem to me to
  be fundamentally important in this question. "We build up our children," said
  Mr. Mushiko, "upon a diametrically different plan from yours. We turn them
  the other way round. Obedience and devotion are our leading thoughts. All our
  sentiment, all our stories and poetry, the traditions of centuries, teach
  loyalty, blind, unquestioning loyalty, of wife to husband, of man to his
  lord, of every one to the monarch.</p>

  <p>"The loyalty is religious. So far as political and social questions go, it
  is fundamental. But your training cultivates independence, free thought, the
  unsparing criticism of superiors, institutions, relationships. Perhaps it is
  better in the end and more invigorating; but it seems to us wild and
  dangerous. ...We begin to have a sort of public opinion, but it is still
  diffident and timid."</p>

  <p>An American and an Englishman, he said, cared for his country because he
  believed it belonged to him. A Japanese cared for his country because he
  believed he belonged to it. One could not pass from one habit of mind to the
  other, he thought, without grave risks and dangers. It is easier to destroy
  obedience than to create responsibility.</p>

  <p>I was reminded of that conversation the other day by a remark made by a
  fellow journalist on the train to Washington:</p>

  <p>"A Chinese will tell you what he thinks&mdash;like an American&mdash;but a
  Japanese always feels he is an agent, even if he isn't an accredited
  one."</p>

  <p>Now, this is very interesting and probably a very fundamental comparison.
  This difference in spirit will make the Japanese people a very different
  instrument from the American and English or French people. It will make the
  Japanese Government a different thing from the Governments it will be meeting
  in Washington. A people built up on obedience can be held and wielded as no
  modern democratic people can be held and wielded. It is different in
  kind.</p>

  <p>Unless this point is kept in mind, there are certain to be great and
  possibly dangerous misunderstandings in the Washington discussions. There
  have possibly been very dangerous misunderstandings already of the European
  powers by the Japanese. The Japanese are likely to think the Atlantic
  Governments are more free to decide than they really are, and that what they
  say is more conclusive than it really is, and the Atlantic peoples are likely
  to think too much of the appearance of a liberal public opinion in Japan and
  to imagine that a Japanese Government may be thrown out and its policy
  changed much more easily than is the case. But indeed Japan is a Government,
  a military Government, holding its people in its hand like a staff or a
  weapon, while America and France and Britain are people operating the
  Governments, more or less imperfectly. In no relationship is confusion upon
  this point more probable and more dangerous than between Japan and Britain or
  France at the present time, and in no connection is there greater need of
  perfectly plain statement.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Britain is still a monarchy with many aristocratic forms, it
  is fatally easy for a Japanese statesman to fall into the belief that the
  British Government is as completely in control, and its officials as able to
  bind or loose, as the Japanese Government and officials, and because of this
  belief to trust to the private assurance and general attitude of personages
  in high places far more than they are justified in doing. The British
  democracy is very like the American democracy in its inability to keep
  watching what is happening overseas; it is preoccupied by domestic questions
  and things that are near to it. You cannot expect a Wiltshire farmer or a
  Lancashire cotton spinner to keep up, day by day, with the concession-hunting
  game in Persia or South China. But if that game of concession hunting piles
  up to sufficiently serious consequences, these democracies are likely to wake
  up in a manner quite outside the Japanese range of pos-sibilities. And to a
  large extent the same is true of France.</p>

  <p>It is the blessed privilege of an irresponsible</p>

  <p>journalist to say things that no diplomatist could ever say, and upon the
  relations of Japan, America and England there are certain truths that seem to
  need saying very plainly at the present time. But though I am an
  irresponsible journalist, it is also to be noted that I am a very English
  Englishman and that I know the way of thinking of my people.</p>

  <p>The British people have been sleeping happily upon the belief that war
  with America is impossible. And for them it is impossible. In this matter the
  British have a speeial and extraordinary instinct. They will not fight the
  United States of America. I will not go into the peculiar feelings that
  produce this disposition; they are feelings great numbers of Americans do not
  understand and have indeed taken great pains not to understand. But to the
  common British, fighting Americans would have much the same relation to
  fighting other peoples that cannibalism would have to eating meat.</p>

  <p>I hear a certain type of American over here slowly and heavily debating
  the Hughes proposals on the assumption that there may be a war of America
  against Britain and Japan. Such an assumption is&mdash;if I may be permitted
  the word&mdash;idiotic. As a people, the British have not been thinking very
  much about the Pacific question. They have been preoccupied by Ireland and
  their own economic troubles. But if that question presently moves toward a
  level of intensity where war is possible, let there be no mistake about it in
  Japan, the ordinary English will be thinking with the Americans. They will
  read much the same stuff because they have the same language, and think in
  the same way because they have kindred habits of thought.</p>

  <p>It will not matter then what assurances and sentiments the Japanese may
  have had for official personages in Great Britain. For we are dealing here
  not with a matter of agreements but with a kind of moral gravitation. If
  there is a conflict the British masses will want to come in on the American
  side, and if it seems likely to be in the least an inconclusive conflict they
  will certainly come in. If the rulers of the Japanese dream that any other
  combination is possible in the Pacific they are under as dangerous a delusion
  as ever lured a great nation to disaster.</p>

  <p>But there are many signs that if ever the ruling people of Japan
  entertained this delusion they are being disillusionized and that they begin
  to realize that a war with America in the Pacific will mean a war with
  America, Britain, and possibly&mdash;to judge from the recent astonishing
  remark by that able writer "Pertinax"&mdash;France. France may use her
  influence at Washington on behalf of Japan in certain matters, but that is
  all Japan will get from France. The Japanese, I believe, now fully realize
  this, and the trend of recent Japanese utterances is all in the direction of
  discussion and the disavowal of any belligerent dreams.</p>

  <p>Yet, Japan continues to arm, and though she now disavows war as her
  method, she sits very proudly and stiffly in her weapons at the parley. She
  may have limited and restrained her dreams, but there is still some minimum
  in her mind beyond which she will not retreat without a struggle. What is
  that minimum which will satisfy her without war? Will it satisfy her for
  good, will it seem so permanently satisfactory to her that she will be
  willing not only to set aside the thought of and preparation for an immediate
  war, but&mdash;what is of far more importance&mdash;enter into such a binding
  contract for her future international relationships as will enable her to
  beat the swords of her Samurai into ploughshares for good and all?</p>

  <p>Is Japan peculiarly an obstacle to the practical, if informal, federation
  of the world to which we all hope that things are moving?</p>

  <p>When I try to frame a hopeful answer to that question, it occurs to me
  with added force that Japan is not a people trying to express itself through
  a Government as we Atlantic peoples are, but a Government, a small ruling
  class, in effective possession of an obedience-loving people. And I remember
  that that small ruling class has a long tradition of romantic and chivalrous
  swordsmanship. Is that ruling class going to keep its power and is it going
  to preserve its tradition? No one would be more urgent than I for the
  complete disarmament of the entire world, but no one could be more convinced
  of the unwisdom of disarmament by America or any other power while any single
  country in the world maintains a spirit that must lead at last to a
  resumption of warfare.</p>

  <p>TO DISARM IN SUCH A SITUATION IS TO LEAVE THE TROUBLE TO ACCUMULATE UPON
  OUR GRAND-CHILDREN; TO PATCH UP A TEMPORARY PEACE BASED ON THE PERMITTED
  "EXPANSION" OF SUCH A POWER IS SIMPLY TO PREPARE FOR AN EXPANDED WAR IN THE
  FUTURE.</p>

  <p>But is that Japanese ruling class resolved at any cost, ev&sect;n at the
  cost of another World War and at the risk of destroying Japan, to hold onto
  its present power and to adhere rigidly to its tradition? In the last hundred
  years Japan, because of her aristocracy and because of her general obedience,
  has achieved feats of adaptation to new conditions that are unparalleled in
  history. As we have noted, there have recently been indications of further
  changes in the spirit of Japan.</p>

  <p>She is said to be pressing forward with the education of the common people
  and the liberation of thought and discussion. In the long run, what is
  happening in the schools of Japan is of more importance to mankind than what
  is happening in her dockyards. But at present we do not know what is
  happening in the schools of Japan. One hears much of New Japan and Liberal
  Japan, and there is even an unofficial representative of the Japanese
  Opposition in Washington. But, so far as we can judge at this distance, we
  must be guided by the policy and methods of the Japanese Government.</p>

  <p>Before we can judge these we must consider the nature of the field in
  which they seem to clash most with American ideas and with American and
  European interests, namely, China and Eastern Asia generally. In my next
  paper I will ask, "What is China?" and consider the nature of the needs and
  claims of Japan in regard to China and the prohibitions and the renunciations
  the Western powers want to impose upon her. For it is on account of these
  restrictions and prohibitions that Japan has been building her battleships.
  Her fighting fleet is to secure her a free hand in China and Siberia; it can
  have no other purpose. And I shall take up the question whether the
  prohibitions and renunciations we want to force upon Japan are not
  prohibitions and restrictions that we are bound in fairness to impose equally
  upon all powers concerned with China and the Far East. If the other powers
  are not prepared for extreme general retractions and renunciation in China;
  if they want to bar out Japan from aggressive practices and exclusive
  advantages that other powers retain; if we cling to any sort of racial
  distinction in these matters, then I shall submit, we are asking impossible
  things from Japan and we are forcing her toward what must must be indeed a
  very desperate gamble for her, a refusal to enter into this proposed
  disarmament agreement&mdash;and that means war.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap08"
     name="chap08">VIII. &mdash; CHINA IN THE BACKGROUND</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, November 16</h3>

  <p class="first">The Chinese propaganda in America and Western Europe seems
on the whole to
  be conducted more efficiently than the Japanese. And the Chinese student, it
  seems to me, gets into closer touch with the educated American and European
  because his is a democratic and not an aristocratic habit of mind. He has an
  intensely Western sense of public opinion.</p>

  <p>The masses of China may be destitute, ignorant and disordered, but in
  their mental habits they are modern and not mediaeval, in the same sense that
  the Japanese are mediaeval and not modern. The Chinese seem to "get on" with
  their Western social equivalents better than any of the Asiatic people. And
  increasing multitudes of Chinese are learning English to-day; it is the
  second language in China.</p>

  <p>Now, if Japan is the figure in the limelight at Washington to-day, China
  is the giant in the background and scene of the present Pacific drama. We
  have had so much in the papers lately about these two countries, we have been
  treated to such a feast of particulars about them, that most of us have long
  since forgotten very thoroughly the broad facts of the case, and it will be
  refreshing to recall them here and now.</p>

  <p>Let us remind ourselves that China is a country with a population
  amounting at the lowest estimate to between twice and three times the
  population of the United States, or of France and England put together. This
  population has the longest unbroken tradition of peaceful industry in the
  world. It is essentially civilized; it respects learning and civility
  profoundly. A common literature and ancient traditions keep its people
  one.</p>

  <p>In the past China has been divided again and again&mdash;always to
  reunite. But it has become "old-fashioned," dangerously old-fashioned,
  perhaps by reason of its very stability; it has lagged behind most of the
  world in the development of its transport and economic possibilities. In
  mineral deposits and other natural resources and in the industrial capability
  of its sturdy and intelligent population it has more undeveloped wealth than
  any other single people in the world. It is only in the last century or so
  that China has lagged behind.</p>

  <p>Only a few centuries ago China was as civilized as Europe and politically
  more stable. In a century or so she may be again the most civilized and
  intelligent power in the world, flourishing in fellowship and perfect
  understanding with the great states of America and Europe.</p>

  <p>She may be&mdash;if she is not torn to pieces and kept in a state of enf
  eeblement and disorder by the hostile action of external powers.</p>

  <p>But at present China is in a state of political impotence. Her Manchu
  imperialism has proved itself to be hopelessly inefficient and China is now
  struggling to reconstruct upon modern republican lines, obviously suggested
  by the American example. A few decades ago Japan astonished the world by
  Europeanizing herself upon Prussian lines. China now, under far less
  favorable conditions and with a vaster country and a less disciplined people,
  is struggling to Americanize herself.</p>

  <p>But it is no easy task to make over a people at one stride from a
  mediaeval autocracy to a modern democracy. It is far easier to Prussianize
  than to Americanize, for in the one case you have only to train an official
  class and in the other you must educate a whole people. China is torn by
  dissensions; the south jars with the north; she has two or more Governments,
  each claiming to be THE Chinese Government, and whole provinces have fallen
  under the sway of military adventurers. It is a distressing spectacle, but it
  was probably an inevitable phase in the development of New China.</p>

  <p>Before we fall a prey to anti-Chinese propaganda it is well to recall how
  long it has always taken to build up the necessary understandings and habits
  of association upon which a new political system rests.</p>

  <p>France, for example, was a land of revolutions and political instability
  for nearly a century after the Great Eevolution. America wrangled feebly and
  dangerously for several years after the War of Independence, before she
  established her Federal Government; she only cemented her union after a
  colossal struggle; she was not really and securely one until a century had
  elapsed.</p>

  <p>During these long decades of probation foreign observers preached
  endlessly about the fickleness of the French and the political inefficiency
  of the Americans and foretold the certainty of a break-up of the United
  States, just as to-day they sneer at Young China and foretell the political
  disintegration of the Chinese. And we have to bear in mind that the forces of
  reorganization and renewal in China struggle against peculiar difficulties
  and interferences quite outside the happier experiences of France and
  America. In particular, they struggle against an intolerable and paralyzing
  amount of foreign interference.</p>

  <p>The brilliant series of adventures and accidents by which a London trading
  company added the Empire of Great Mogul as a picturesque but incongruously
  big jewel to the British Crown set an extraordinarily bad precedent in
  Asiatic affairs. It obsessed European political thought with the impossible
  dream of carving up all Asia into similar domains. The Mogul's empire was
  itself an empire of conquest in a land saturated by ideas of caste, and this
  gave all these European adventurers the attitude of high caste men
  benevolently consuming inferior races.</p>

  <p>In that spirit, Europe&mdash;with Japan coming in presently as a hopeful
  student of European methods&mdash;had been trying to cook, carve up and fight
  for the portions of China for nearly a century, treating these wonderful
  people as an inferior race. The very worst that can be said about Japan with
  regard to China is that she has been too vigorously European.</p>

  <p>Consider how it would have been with the United States in the years of
  discord that led up to the Civil War if these difficulties had been
  complicated by three such embarrassments as these: First, that most
  foreigners, except now the Germans and Austrians, are outside the reach of
  the native courts, that their disputes with Chinese go before special foreign
  courts, that they are specially favored in regard to property and shipping;
  secondly, that the Chinese Government is restricted from raising revenue by
  any tariff above a flat rate of 5 per cent., and that they are also strictly
  restricted to 2&frac12; per cent, in their interior dues upon foreign (but
  not Chinese) trade, so that they are in fact unable to raise enough revenue
  to maintain an efficient Government; and thirdly, that nearly all the Chinese
  railways&mdash;and as every American knows, transport is the very life of
  modern state&mdash;are in the grip of this foreign country or that.</p>

  <p>These are the open and manifest inconveniences of the situation, but
  behind these more open aspects there is a vast tangle of intervention between
  Chinamen and Chinese affairs&mdash;schemes for further exploitation,
  financial entanglements, vast concession plans and projects for "spheres of
  influence" for this aggressive foreign nation or that. And this foreign
  influence is not the influence of one foreign power pursuing a single and
  consistent policy but a number of competing powers, all pursuing different
  ends and pulling things this way and that. How could any country reconstruct
  itself while it was entangled in such a net of interference? No people on
  earth could do such a thing.</p>

  <p>The plain fact is that if China is to reconstruct herself that net has to
  be cut away. It is not enough to warn Japan out of China or to say " open
  door" for China. The open door is good for the ventilation of that great
  apartment, but what is also needed is a clearing out of the encumbrance
  inside. These encumbrances are not primarily Japanese.</p>

  <p>The five great powers sit at a green table in the form of a horseshoe in
  the conference and the four lesser powers are at a straight table like the
  armature of a horseshoe magnet. At the left hand corner, next the Japanese,
  are the three Chinese representatives. I gather they will be allowed to say
  "Shantung" at the conference in moderation but not Tibet nor Tonkin nor the
  East China&mdash;or indeed any&mdash;railway. I doubt if either Mr. Balfour
  or M. Briand will nerve himself to say these forbidden words. But an
  irresponsible journalist may write them.</p>

  <p>If there is to be a real end to war and disarmament there has to be
  release of China to free Chinese control, and that means a self-denying
  ordinance from ALL the great powers. It will be an easy one for America and
  Italy to accept, but it will be a difficult sacrifice indeed for those two
  hoary leaders in the breakup of China, Great Britain and France. Neither
  country has a bad heart, but long ago in the East they acquired some very bad
  habits. This is a time when bad habits lead very quickly to disaster.</p>

  <p>The real test of the quality of the conference will appear when some issue
  arises which involves an assertion or denial of the principle of "Unhand and
  keep your hands off China." If the Chinese are worth while, the conference
  has to establish that principle. It cannot be gracefully advanced by America
  because America has so little to relinquish. It CAN be established at the
  initiative of either Britain or France.</p>

  <p>It seems plain to me that official America is waiting for some move in
  this direction from either or both of these powers. If that principle of a
  free China is established at the Washington Conference the way will have been
  opened in the not very remote future to a healthy and vigorous United States
  of China, a great modern, pacific and progressive power. And when I write
  "China" I mean what any sensible man means when he writes "China"&mdash;I
  mean all those parts of Asia in which the Chinese people and the Chinese
  culture prevail. I include at least South Manchuria, which is as surely
  Chinese as Texas is American, and which can no more be GIVEN to any other
  power without the consent of China than my overcoat can be given by one
  passerby to another.</p>

  <p>The plain alternative to a released and renascent China is the cutting up
  of China among the aggressive powers to the tune of that popular American air
  "The Open Door," the demoralization and disintegration of the Chinese,
  international elbowing, competition, quarrels among the powers who have
  "shared" China, and, at last, the next great war&mdash;which it will be just
  as easy for America to keep out of as the great war of 1914-1918.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap09"
     name="chap09">IX. &mdash; THE FUTURE OF JAPAN</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, November 18</h3>

  <p class="first">If we adopt as our guiding principle that China is "worth
while," if we
  make up our minds&mdash;and it seems to me that the American public at least
  is making up its mind&mdash;that China is to bring itself up to date and to
  reorganize itself as a great union of states under purely Chinese control,
  and that it is to be protected by mutual agreement among the powers from
  outside interference during the age of reorganization, then it is clear that
  all dreams of empire in China or any fragments of China on the part of any
  other power must cease.</p>

  <p>This building up of a united, peaceful China by the conscious,
  self-denying action of the chief powers of the world is evidently, under
  present conditions, the only sane policy before the powers assembled at
  Washington, but it is, unhappily, quite diametrically opposed to all
  traditions of competitive nationality. And I find a most extraordinary
  conflict going on in men's minds here in Washington between the manifest
  sanities of the world situation and those habits of thought and action in
  which we have all been bred. Competitive nationalism and the long established
  competitive traditions of European diplomacy have gone far toward wrecking
  the world; and they may yet go far toward wrecking the Washington Conference.
  We have all got these traditions strong in us, every one of us. These
  traditions, these ideas of international intercourse as a sort of game to
  beat the other fellow, have as tough a vitality as the appetite of the wasp,
  which will go on eating greedily after its abdomen has been cut off. Indeed,
  some of the representatives of the powers at Washington seem still to be
  clinging to the ambition of finally devouring China, or large parts of
  China&mdash;a feast which they will not have the remotest prospect of
  digesting.</p>

  <p>If that sort of thing goes on, a continuation of war preparation, a
  renewal of war and the consummation of the social smash now in progress is
  inevitable. Yet, on the face of that plain, inevitable consequence, my
  diplomatic friends in Washington go on talking about such insane projects as
  that of ceding Manchuria to Japan right down the Great Wall; of giving Japan
  practical possession of the mines of China; of giving ' l compensation" in
  the matter of Chinese railways to France; of getting this "advantage" or that
  for Great Britain, and so forth and so on. I remain permanently astounded
  before the Foreign Office officials. They have such excellent, brilliant
  minds, but, alas! so highly specialized&mdash;so highly
  specialized&mdash;that at times one doubts whether they have, in the general
  sense of the word, any minds at all.</p>

  <p>In the face of the universal hopefulness for satisfactory results from the
  conference I find myself full of doubts. The naval disarmament proposal of
  Secretary Hughes was obviously meant only as the opening proposition, the
  quite splendid opening proposition, of the conference. The second meeting, I
  felt, would find Mr. Balfour and Admiral Kato and M. Briand in eloquent
  sympathy, saying: "Certainly. All this and more also we can do on the
  understanding that a stable, explicit, exhaustive, permanent Pacific
  agreement can be framed by this conference that will remove all causes of war
  whatever/ ' But the second meeting was disappointing. One nation after
  another agreed, as Mr. Balfour, that "old parliamentary hand," put it, "in
  principle. But"&mdash;</p>

  <p>And now we are all playing four-handed chess with reservations about
  dockyards, naval stations, cruisers, large submarines, and the like. We are
  all trying to put the effective disarmament onto the other fellow. Meanwhile
  the nine powers are sitting in secret session on the Pacific question, and it
  is clear from the rumors that nine-handed chess is in progress there.</p>

  <p>Yet the fact, plain enough to any one who is not lost in the game of
  diplomacy, is that this conference is an occasion for generosity and
  renunciation. There is no way out of the Pacific imbroglio except to
  disentangle China and form a self-denying ordinance of all the powers
  concerned to leave her alone while she reconstructs. I submit that even
  Japan, most intent of all the chess players, will do best to fall in line
  with such a plan.</p>

  <p>Would a world covenant to protect China from aggression and to concede her
  the progressive abolition of extra-territorial privileges and the same
  unlimited rights over her own railways and soil and revenue that are enjoyed
  by the Americans and Japanese over theirs be any serious harm to Japan? Would
  it not release Japan from her imitative career as a pseudo-Britain or a
  pseudo-Germany and enable her to get on with her own proper business, which
  is to be, to the fullest, completest and richest extent, Japan?</p>

  <p>For what, after all, is it that Japan wants? She wants safety, she
  declares&mdash;just as France wants safety. She wants safety to be Japan,
  just as France wants safety to be France and England wants safety to be
  England. And she makes these declarations with considerable justification.
  For 300 years she believed she had that safety, and we must admit she was the
  least dangerous state in the whole world. For 300 years Japan waged no
  foreign wars; she was a peaceful, self-contained hermit. It was American
  enterprise that dragged her out of her seclusion and fear of Europe that
  drove her to the practices of modern imperialism. They are not natural
  Japanese practices. She fought China and grabbed Korea, because otherwise
  Russia would have held it like a pistol at her throat; she fought Russia,
  because otherwise Russia would have held Manchuria and Port Arthur against
  her; she fought in the Great War to oust Germany from Shantung. She is now
  pursuing an entirely "European" policy in China, intriguing to get a free
  hand in Manchuria and Eastern Siberia; scheming for concessions, privileges
  and the creation of obedient puppet governments in a dismembered China;
  planning to divert the natural resources of China to her own use, primarily
  because she fears that otherwise these things will be done by rival powers
  and she will be cut off from trade, from raw materials and all prosperity
  until at last, when she is sufficiently starved and enfeebled, she will be
  attacked and India-ized. These are reasonable, honorable fears. They oblige
  her to keep armed and aggressive; hers is an "offensive defensive." There is
  no other way of allaying her reasonable, just fears except by a permanent
  binding association of world powers to put an end forever to the headlong
  scramble for Asia that began a century and a half ago in India between the
  French and English, to recognize frankly and to put it upon record that that
  phase of history has closed, and to provide some effective means of
  restoration now and the prevention of fresh aggressions in the future.</p>

  <p>No doubt there is a military caste in Japan loving war and not even
  dreading modern war. We have to reckon with that. When we ask Japan to
  release China, we ask for something very much against Japanese habits of
  thought. Her dominant military note is due both to ancient traditions and
  recent experience. Japan had most of the fun and little of the bitterness of
  the Great War and her people may conceivably have a lighter attitude toward
  aggressive war than any European nation. But if the alternatives presented to
  her were on the one hand disarmament and a self-denying ordinance of the
  powers in relation to China, and on the other war against the other chief
  powers of the world, I doubt if the patriotism of even the most war-loving
  Japanese would not outbalance his war lust. And I cannot imagine any other
  permanent settlement of the Pacific situation except a self-denying
  ordinance to which Japan, America and the European powers can ever possibly
  agree.</p>

  <p>Now, Japan, disarmed and pledged and self-restrained by treaties and
  associations against aggression on the mainland of Asia, would nevertheless
  reap enormous benefits from the liberation of China. Given just and
  reasonable treaties, she can do very well without armaments. Her geographical
  position would make her naturally and properly the first merchant and the
  first customer of a renascent China. She would have the first bid for all the
  coal and ore and foodstuffs she needed. American goods and European goods
  would have to come past her over thousands of miles of sea. Chinese goods
  that didn't come to her would go elsewhere up a steep hill of freight
  charges. It is a preposterous imagination that China would refuse to sell to
  her nearest and best customer. Moreover, Japan's artistic and literary
  culture, at once so distinctive and so sympathetic with that of China, would
  receive enormous stimulation, as it has done in the past, by a Chinese
  revival. Japan would be able to keep in the van of nations not by that
  headlong imitation and adoption of European devices into which circumstances
  have forced her hitherto, but by a natural and orderly development of her own
  idiosyticracies in the face of the enhanced power that modern resources
  supply. An association of Japan with other nations to insure uninterrupted
  development to China would insure that to Japan also. It would be a mutual
  assurance of peace and security.</p>

  <p>But there is one set of facts, and one only, that militates against this
  idea of a pacific and progressive Japan, a splendid leader in civilization
  amidst a brotherhood of nations, and that is this, that Japan is already
  overpopu-lated, she has to import not only food but industrial raw material,
  and that her population increases now by the tremendous figure of half a
  million a year. That is the reality that gives substance to the aggressive
  imperialism of Japan. That is why she casts about for such regions for
  expansion as Eastern Siberia&mdash;a region not represented at the
  conference, and so beyond its purview, and that is why she covets some
  preferential control in Chinese metals and minerals and food. Were it not for
  this steady invasion of the world by hungry lives, the principle of Japan for
  the Japanese, China for the Chinese, England for the English, Eastern Siberia
  for its own people, would give us the simplest, most satisfactory principle
  for international peace. But Japan teems. Has any country a right to slop its
  population over and beyond its boundaries or to claim trade and food because
  of its heedless self-congestion? Diplomacy is curiously mealy mouthed about
  many things; I have made a British official here blush at the words of birth
  control, but it is a fact that this aggressive fecundity of peoples is
  something that can be changed and restrained within a country, and that this
  sort of modesty and innocence that leads to a morbid development of
  population and to great wars calls for intelligent discouragement in
  international relations.</p>

  <p>Japan has modernized itself in many respects, but its social organization,
  its family system, is a very ancient and primitive one, involving an extreme
  domestication of women and a maximum of babies. While the sanitation and
  hygiene of Japan were still mediaeval, a sufficient proportion of these
  babies died soon and prevented any overpressure of population, but now that
  Japan has modernized itself in most respects it needs to modernize itself in
  this respect also.</p>

  <p>I submit that the troubles arising from excessive fecundity within a
  country justify not an aggressive imperialism on the part of that country,
  but a sufficient amount of birth control within its proper boundaries.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">X. &mdash; "SECURITY"&mdash; THE NEW AND BEAUTIFUL
     CATCHWORD</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, November 20</h3>

  <p class="first">The new and really quite beautiful catchword that dominates
the Washington
  Conference is "security." The word was produced originally, I believe, in
  France. France wants nothing in the world now but security; she has abandoned
  all dreams of conquest or glory, all aggressive economic intentions; she is
  the white lamb of international affairs, washed and redeemed by the Great
  War. Only&mdash;she must be secure.</p>

  <p>Great Britain, Japan are in complete unison with France on this subject.
  Great Britain asks for nothing but a predominant fleet and naval arsenals in
  perfect going order. Mr. Balfour's eloquent speech at the second session of
  the conference made the necessity of this for security incontrovertible.
  Japan wants East Siberia, the special control of raw material in Manchuria, a
  grip upon China, because she is driven by the same passionate craving for
  peace and rest. We have had this explained to us very clearly here in
  Washington by representative Japanese.</p>

  <p>All these powers will accept every proposal Secretary Hughes makes, or is
  prepared to make, eloquently and sincerely&mdash;"in principle." They then
  proceed to state their minimum requirements for that feeling of security
  which is the goal of all peoples at the present time. When these requirements
  have been stated it becomes plain that these states are not to be so much
  disarmed as stripped for action, with highly efficient instead of unwieldy
  and overwhelmingly expensive equipment. They do not so much propose to give
  up war as to bring it back by a gentlemanly agreement within the restricted
  possibilities of their austere bankruptcy.</p>

  <p>The French conception of security is particularly attractive. France
  stipulates, I gather, for a dominant army upon the Continent of Europe, for a
  Germany retained permanently by agreement among the powers at the extrem-est
  pitch of wretchedness and feebleness, for an outcast Russia, or a series of
  alliances by which such countries as Poland will be militarized in the French
  interest rather than industrialized in their own. And France, in further
  pursuit of the idea of perfect peace (for France), is training great masses
  of barbaric Senegalese for war, with the view of using them to police white
  populations and sustain their millennium in Europe. They can have no other
  use now.</p>

  <p>If they return to Africa, these trained soldiers will accumulate as a new
  and interesting element in African life until some black Napoleon arises to
  demand "security" for Africa.</p>

  <p>At present France displays an astonishing confidence in the British, but
  no doubt, if her amazing peasants and her wonderful soil presently lead to
  partial recuperation, she will realize the need of bringing her now neglected
  fleet up to "security" standards also. And it is axiomatic among the experts
  that no power with a coast line is really secure unless it has a fleet at
  least the double of any other fleet that can possibly operate upon that
  coast.</p>

  <p>These statements are not the facetious inventions of an irresponsible
  writer; they are fair samples of the sort of thing that the various
  deputations have brought with them to Washington. These are the things we
  talk of and are gradually talking out of sight. And if the Washington
  Conference served no other purpose at all in the world, it would have been
  quite worth while in order to get together all these totally incomparable
  conceptions of security and by that approximation to demonstrate their utter
  absurdity. Along the lines of either unregulated or regulated armament there
  can be no security for any race or people.</p>

  <p>The only security for a modern state now is <i>a binding and mutually
  satisfactory</i> alliance with the power or powers that might otherwise
  attack. The only real security for France against a German revenge is a
  generous and complete understanding between the French and German Bepublics
  so that they will have a mutual interest in each other's prosperity. Germany
  is naturally a rather bigger country than France, and nothing on earth can
  alter that. Other powers or all the powers may come into such a treaty as
  guarantors, but the essential thing for peace between France and Germany is
  peace made good and clear between them, a cessation of mutual injuries and
  hostile preparations.</p>

  <p>The only effectual security for the communications of the British Empire
  is the recognition by all mankind that this great system of English-speaking
  states round and about the world is a good thing for all mankind and a
  resolute effort of these states to keep to that level. There is no other real
  security.</p>

  <p>This is not "lofty idealism"; it is common sense; and the idea of
  "security" by armament and by the enfeeblement of possible rivals is not a
  "practical recognition of present limitations," but a feeble surrender to
  entirely vicious tendencies of the human mind.</p>

  <p>I believe that for a little while yet Washington will continue its
  researches into the meaning of armed "security," and that then it will turn
  its attention to the alternative idea, with which the nimble French mind has
  also been playing, and that is security by treaty. The French have been
  disposed in the past to welcome an Anglo-American-French treaty to guarantee
  France against attack. The idea in that form is dead, but the possibility of
  a far more comprehensive agreement, a loose-fitting but effectual association
  of all the nations of the world to keep the peace and arrange their
  differences by conference, is bound to recur again as the impossibility of
  disarmament without settlement becomes increasingly apparent. There drifts
  into my memory here a curious feast of "security" which occurred long ago in
  some Eastern equivalent of Versailles. The great Abbassid family had suffered
  many things from the Ommayyad Caliphs, and at last it rose against them and
  overcame them and secured the leadership of Islam. The remnants of the
  Ommayyad clan were sumoned to witness and celebrate the new peace. But some
  of the Abbassids, inspired by quite modern ideas of "security," had all the
  Ommayyads massacred before the banquet began. A beautiful carpet was spread
  over the dead and dying and the Abbassids feasted thereon. Here was
  "security" to satisfy the most exacting modern European ideals. Yet the
  Abbassids made little of their security. They never rose to the glory of the
  Ommayyads; the drive and strength seemed to have gone out of Arab Islam;
  their history for all this "security" is one of division, decline, decay. It
  takes all men to make a world.</p>

  <p>Let us get through with this futile haggling for national advantages and
  securities and let us get on to the organization of that brotherhood which
  can alone save the world.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">XI. &mdash; FRANCE IN THE LIMELIGHT</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, November 21</h3>

  <p class="first">The first session of the Washington Conference featured, as
the
  cinematograph people say, President Harding and Mr. Secretary Hughes; the
  second day was Mr. Balfour's day; this third, from which I have just come,
  was the session of M. Briand.</p>

  <p>The four personalities contrast very strikingly. President Harding was a
  stately figure making a very noble oration in the best American fashion; Mr.
  Hughes was hard, exact, clear-cut, very earnest and explicit; Mr. Balfour
  slender and stooping, silvery-haired and urbane, made his carefully worded
  impromptu speech with a care that left no ragged end to a sentence and no gap
  for applause. All three are taller and neater men than M. Briand, whose mane
  of hair flows back from his face in leonine style, whose mobile face and
  fluent gestures reinforce the stirring notes of his wonderful voice. His
  eloquence was so great that many Congressmen in the gallery above, quite
  innocent of French, were moved to applause by the sheer grace and music of
  the performance.</p>

  <p>Eloquence could not save the day or the occasion. M. Briand spoke to a
  gathering that was saturated with scepticism for the cause he had to plead. I
  watched the quiet, scrutinizing countenances of the six men he turned about
  to face as he spoke&mdash;Eoot, Lodge and Hughes, as immobile as judges;
  Balfour trying to look like a sympathetic ally in the face of a discourse
  that insultingly ignored Great Britain as a factor of the European situation;
  Lord Lee, obliquely prostrate and judicial; Geddes, with that faintly smiling
  face of his, the mask of an unbeliever.</p>

  <p>The voice of the orator rose and fell, boomed at them, pleaded, sought to
  stir them&mdash;like seas breaking over rocks. Their still implacable faces,
  hardly or politely, retained the effect of listening to a special
  pleader&mdash;a special pleader doing his best, his foamy best, with an
  intolerably bad case.</p>

  <p>M. Briand put before the conference no definite proposals at all. After
  Mr. Hughes, with that magnificent discourse of his, punctuated by "we propose
  to scrap," M. Briand was an anticlimax. France proposed to scrap nothing.
  France does not know how to scrap. She learns nothing and forgets nothing. It
  is her supreme misfortune. He explained the position of France in a melodious
  discourse of apologetics and excuses. The French contribution to the
  Disarmament Conference is that France has not the slightest intention of
  disarming. She is reducing her term of service with the colors from three
  years to two. In a Europe of untrained men this is not disarmament, but
  economy.</p>

  <p>The great feature of M. Briand's discourse was his pretense of the
  absolute unimportance of England in European affairs. France, for whom, as
  Mr. Balfour in a few words of infinite gentleness reminded M. Briand, France,
  for whom the British Empire lost a million dead&mdash;very nearly as many men
  as France herself lost; France, to whose rescue from German attack came
  Britain, Russia and presently Italy and America; France, M. Briand declared,
  was alone in the world, friendless and terribly threatened by Germany and
  Russia. And on the nonsensical assumption of French isolation, M. Briand
  unfolded a case that was either&mdash;I hesitate to consider which&mdash;and
  how shall I put that old alternative?&mdash;deficient in its estimate of
  reality, or else&mdash;just special pleading.</p>

  <p>The plain fact of the case is that France is maintaining a vast army in
  the face of a disarmed world and she is preparing energetically for fresh
  warlike operations in Europe and for war under sea against Great Britain. To
  excuse this line of action M. Briand unfolded a fabulous account of the
  German preparation for a renewal of hostilities; every soldier in the small
  force of troops allowed to Germany is an officer or non-commissioned officer,
  so that practically the German Army can expand at any moment to millions, and
  Germany is not morally disarmed because Ludendorff&mdash;M. Briand quoted him
  at some length&mdash;is still writing and talking militant nonsense.</p>

  <p>Even M. Briand has to admit that the present German Government is honest
  and well meaning, but it is a weak Government. It is not the real thing. The
  real Germany is the Germany necessary for M. Briand's argument. And behind
  Germany is Russia. He conjured up a great phantom of Soviet Russia which
  would have conquered all Europe but for the French Armies and Poland. That
  iniquitous attack of Poland upon Russia last May was, he assured his six
  quiet-eyed auditors and the rest of us, a violent invasion of Western
  civilization by Russia.</p>

  <p>"There were those in Germany," he said in a voice to make our flesh creep,
  "who beckoned them on." The French had saved us from that. The French Army,
  with its gallant Senegalese, was the peacemaker and guardian of all
  Europe.</p>

  <p>One listened incredulous. One waited still incredulous to hear it over
  again from the interpreter. Yes, we were confirmed; he really had said that.
  Poor, exhausted Russia, who saved Paris, desiring nothing but to be left
  alone; bled white, starving, invaded by a score of subsidized adventurers;
  invaded from Es-thonia, from Poland, from Japan, in Murmansk, in the Crimea,
  in the Ukraine, on the Volga, incessantly invaded, it is this Russia which
  has put France on the offensive-defensive!</p>

  <p>One is reminded of the navvy who kicked his wife to death to protect
  himself from her violence.</p>

  <p>(It is interesting to recall here that one of the Kaiser's favorite
  excuses for German armament, when it was Germany and not France which aspired
  to dominate Europe, was his acute dread of the Yellow Peril.)</p>

  <p>When he talked to the journalists in preparation for this display, M.
  Briand excused France for wanting submarines in quantity because, he said,
  she was liable to attack upon three coasts, but maturer reflection omitted
  this aspect of the French case from M. Briand's attention. It was too thick
  even for an American audience. And even Mr. Balfour, with all his charming
  tenderness for a fellow-statesman, could not well have avoided the plain
  question, "From whom does France anticipate a sea attack!"</p>

  <p>France is in about as much danger of an attack upon her three coasts as
  the United States of America is upon her Canadian frontier. Her ships are as
  safe upon the sea as a wayfarer on Fifth Avenue. If she builds submarines
  now, she builds them to attack British commerce and for no other reason
  whatever. All the Ludendorffs and Soviets in the world do not justify a
  single submarine. Every submarine she launches is almost as direct a breach
  of the peace with Britain as though she were to start target practice at
  Dover Harbor across . the straits, and every one in England will understand
  the aim of her action as clearly. As M. Briand, in his discourse to the
  journalists, argued that the empire of France was as far-flung as that of
  Britain, her need to protect her communication was as great. This was in the
  face of Mr. Balfour's reminder that Britain can feed its people only for
  seven weeks if its overseas supplies are cut off. France can feed from her
  own soil all the year round. The argument was not good enough for a boys'
  debating society, and M. Briand, who is prepared to scrap nothing else, was
  at least well advised to scrap that.</p>

  <p>I will confess that I am altogether perplexed by the behavior of France at
  the present time. I do not understand what she believes she is doing in
  Europe and I do not understand her position in this conference. Why could she
  not have co-operated in this conference instead of making it a scene of
  special pleading? I have already said that the French here seem to be more
  foreign than any other people and least in touch with the general feeling of
  the assembly. They seem to have come here as national advocates, as special
  pleaders, without any of that passionate desire to lay the foundations of a
  world settlement that certainly animates nearly every other delegation. They
  do not seem to understand how people here regard either the conference or
  France.</p>

  <p>There is indeed a great and enduring enthusiasm for France in America.
  Marshal Foch has gone about in America as the greatest of heroes and the most
  popular figure. He has been overwhelmed by hospitality and smothered by every
  honor America could heap upon him. The French flag is far more in evidence
  than the British in both New York and Washington. This may easily give French
  visitors the idea that they are exceptional favorites here and that France
  can count upon American backing in any quarrels she chooses to pick with the
  British or the Germans or Russians.</p>

  <p>There could be no greater error. The enthusiasm for Foch is largely
  personal; he was the General of all the Allies. The enthusiasm for France is
  largely traditional and it does not extend to the French nationals or the
  present day. America loves, as all liberal and intelligent men throughout the
  world must love, France the great liberator of men's minds; France of the
  great Revolution; the France of art and light, France, the beautiful and the
  gallant. It is hard to write bitterly of a country that can give the world an
  Anatole France, sane and smiling, or so brave and balanced a gentleman as the
  late Robert d'Humiers. But where is that France today? None of that France
  has come to the Washington Conference, but only an impenitent apologist for
  three years of sins against the peace of the world, an apologist for national
  aggression posturing as fear, and reckless greed disguised as discretion.
  Here in New York and Washington I find just the same steady change of opinion
  about. France that is going on in London. I want to write it down as plainly
  as I can. I want to get it over to my friends in France, because I have loved
  France greatly, and I do not think the French people realize what is going on
  among the English-speaking peoples. People here want to see Europe
  recuperating, and they are beginning to realize that the chief obstacle to a
  recuperating Europe is the obstinate French resolve to dominate the
  Continent, to revive and carry out the antiquated and impossible policy of
  Louis XIV, maintaining an ancient and intolerable quarrel, setting Pole
  against German and brewing mischief everywhere in order to divide and rule,
  instead of entering frankly into a European brotherhood.</p>

  <p>Feeling about Germany and Austria is changing here, even more rapidly than
  in England, to pity and indignation; feeling about Russia is drifting the
  same way. One detects these undercurrents in the minds of the most unlikely
  people. People are recalling the France of Napoleon III., that restless and
  mischievous France, which came so near to a conflict with America in Mexico
  and which kept Europe in a fever for a quarter of a century. It is an
  enormous loss to the Washington Conference, it is a misfortune to all the
  world, that the great qualities of the French people, their clear-headedness,
  their powerful and yet practical imaginations seem at present to be entirely
  subordinated to the merely rhetorical and emotional side of the French
  character.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">XII. &mdash; THUS FAR</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, November 22</h3>

  <p class="first">HOW are we getting on in Washington?</p>

  <p>The general mood is hopefulness tempered by congestion, mental and
  physical, and by sheer fatigue. There is no rest in Washington, no cessation.
  Last winter I was a happy invalid at Amalfi, I sat in the Italian sunshine,
  the hours were vast globes of golden time, my mind and my soul were my own.
  Now I live to the tune of a telephone bell and the little feverish American
  hours slip through my hot, dry hands before I can turn my thoughts around. I
  wish I could attend to everything.</p>

  <p>The conference has evolved two committees, one on disarmament and one on
  Pacific affairs, which meet behind closed doors, so that one has three or
  four divergent reports of what has happened to choose from; delegates at all
  hours and in devious ways call together the press men to make more or less
  epoch-making statements; there are particular conferences with
  representative business men of this country and educationists of that, and so
  forth; one is called upon by a multitude of well informed people insistent
  upon this fact or that point of view, eloquent sidelights from South China,
  Albania, Czecho-Slovakia clamor for attention. And there is a terrible
  multitude of mere pesterers who want to do something&mdash;they know not
  what. The weather here is unusually warm and inclined to be cloudy, a
  brewhouse atmosphere, due entirely, one humorist declares, to the tremendous
  fermentation that is going on.</p>

  <p>The fermenting vat overflows with the press of all the world. All the
  world, we feel, is present in spirit at Washington.</p>

  <p>Three questions stand out as of importance and significance. The naval
  disarmament discussion, as one could have foretold, becomes a haggle for
  advantages. Each power seeks to disarm the other fellow. Great Britain
  detests the big raider submarine and wants none of it; it is America's only
  effective long range weapon. A clamor comes to us from across the ocean from
  the French Senate for unlimited submarines. These will be to attack Great
  Britain; there can be no other possible use for them. Perhaps the French
  Senate does not really want war with Britain, but this is the way to get
  it.</p>

  <p>Japan is asking for a seven to ten instead of a six to ten basis for
  herself. And so on. So long as unsettled differences remain, disarmament
  discussions are bound to degenerate in this fashion. Settlements and sincere
  disarmament are inseparably interwoven. The French, however, have led in an
  important pronouncement, promising evacuations and renunciations in the
  Chinese area on the part of France, provided Britain and Japan follow suit.
  Lord Riddle, on behalf of Britain, has followed suit; Britain is ready to
  relinquish everything, with the justifiable exception of Hongkong, a purely
  British creation. And M. Briand has explained why France must have an awful
  army to over-awe Europe, but that still leaves certain possibilities of
  military restraint open for consideration. We are still discussing whether we
  may not hope to see conscription banished from the&gt; earth.</p>

  <p>When such things swim up through the boiling activities of the Washington
  vat, not merely as passing suggestions and happy ideas but embodied in more
  or less concrete proposals, we cannot fail, however jaded we may feel, from
  also feeling hopeful. The conference has got only to its third session and we
  already seem further from war in the Pacific and nearer security there than
  at any time in the last two years.</p>

  <p>And these intimations of success in this world discussion, of which
  Washington is the controlling nucleus, turn our minds naturally enough to the
  continuation and final outcome of this great initiative of President
  Harding's. The more fruitful the conference seems likely to be in agreements
  and understandings the more evident is the necessity for something permanent
  arising out of it, to hold and maintain, in spirit and in fact, this
  accumulation of agreements and understandings.</p>

  <p>The Washington Conference before it breaks up and disperses must in some
  way lay an egg to reproduce itself. In some fashion it must presently return.
  Because we have had to bear in mind that in the final and conclusive sense of
  the word the conference can decide nothing. It has produced a fine and
  generous atmosphere about it; it will probably arrive at an effectual
  temporary solution of a large group of problems, but the power of final
  decision rests with Governments and Legislatures far away.</p>

  <p>The American proposals are only suggestive and they have no value as a
  treaty, unless they are accepted by the powers and until the American Senate
  has confirmed them by a two-thirds majority. M. Briand may have wished to be
  generous and broadminded here, but in Paris is this French Senate, inspired
  by a mad patriotism that would even now begin to arm France for an
  "inevitable" war with Britain. The French Senate has made a warlike gesture
  directly at England, has set its feet in a path than can end only in a
  supreme disaster for both France and England, and it did so, one guesses, in
  order to remind M. Briand that if he dared to be reasonable, if he dared to
  be pacific, if he acted for Great France and mankind, instead of at the
  dictates of Nationalist France, he did so at his peril. He would have been
  accused of betraying his country. "Conspuez Briand!" they would have cried in
  their pretty way. So M. Briand has played the patriot's role.</p>

  <p>In Tokio and in London it is an open secret that the same conflict goes
  on; the cables are busy with the struggle between reason and fierce
  patriotism. ...Every concession made by every country at Washington will go
  back to the home land to be challenged as "weakness," as "want of
  patriotism," as "treason."</p>

  <p>In America and Britain the ugly side of this business has still to come,
  the outbreak of the patriotic fanatics, of the disappointed politicians who
  wanted to come here, of the wrecker journalists, the dealers in suspicion,
  the evil minds of a thousand types. And the lassitude that follows great
  expectations has also to be reckoned with. What Washington decides will not
  be the ultimate outcome; what the world will get at last in treaties ratified
  and things accomplished will be the mangled and tangled remains of the
  Washington decisions.</p>

  <p>For that reason it is imperative that the Washington Conference should
  meet again. Its work is not done until its decisions are realized. After it
  has sent over its reports to the Goverments and Parliaments it will adjourn,
  but it must not cease. With perhaps rather fuller powers, with perhaps a
  wider or a different representation of the world, it must come again to a
  renewed invitation, to restore once more that atmosphere of international
  good will that has been created here, and to go over the attempts to realize,
  or the failures to realize, the settlement it has already worked out. And
  there will be many questions ripening then for solution that it cannot deal
  with now.</p>

  <p>Much remains to be done by the Washington Conference, most of its work,
  indeed, is still to be done, but enough has been demonstrated already here to
  convince any reasonable man that a new thing, a new instrument, a new organ,
  has come into human affairs and that it is a thing that the world needs and
  cannot do without again. This thing has to recur, has to grow. It has to
  become a recurrent world conference. And this being clear, it is time that
  public discussion, public opinion, direct itself to the problem of the
  renewal of the conference in order that before it disperses we may be assured
  that it will meet again.</p>

  <p>As a temporary, transitory thing, it will presently fade out of men's
  memories and imaginations; but as a thing going on and living, which has
  gone, but which, like the King in circuit, will come again to try the new
  issues that have arisen and to try again the experiments that have fallen
  short of expectation, it may become the symbol and rallying point of all that
  vast amount of sane, humanitarian feeling and all that devotion to mankind as
  a whole, and to peace and justice, that has hitherto been formless and
  ineffectual in the world, for the need of such a banner.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">XIII. &mdash; THE LARGER QUESTION BEHIND THE
CONFERENCE</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, November 23</h3>

  <p class="first">The Washington Conference, after its tremendous opening,
seems now to be
  running into slack water. It has had its three great days, in which Secretary
  Hughes and Mr. Balfour and M. Briand have respectively played the leading
  parts. The broad lines of a possible naval reduction and of a possible
  Chinese and Pacific settlement are shaping themselves in men's minds.</p>

  <p>M. Briand has spoken and now departs. France will not disarm until she has
  a binding treaty which her former allies are not yet prepared to give her.
  She ignores the assurances of her proved allies and the experiences of the
  Great War. She goes in fear of desolate Russia and bankrupt Germany and she
  is "assailable on three coasts." So she retains her great armies, and
  especially her "colonial" army. M. Briand's departure has something of the
  effect of France shaking the dust from her feet and departing from the
  conference.</p>

  <p>But France cannot step out of her share in the leadership of peace in this
  fashion. France has not finished with the conference yet. She will speak now
  at Washington with a voice perhaps less romantically impressive but more
  practically helpful. She has explained the terrors of her position and the
  assembled delegates have said "There! There!" to her as politely and
  soothingly as possible. But nobody really believes in the terrors of her
  position. Mr. Hughes is a man of great tenacity of purpose, and his chief
  reply to M. Briand's speech is to keep military disarmament upon the agenda.
  A third committee of five powers has been added to the two already is
  existence to deal with land disarmament. It is doubtful if it can get very
  far unless it can bring in German and Russian representatives to reply to the
  alarmist charges of M. Briand.</p>

  <p>With the formation of this third committee the Washington Conference would
  seem to have got as much before it as it is likely to handle. The Hughes
  impetus has done its work and done its work well. The conference has followed
  his rigorous lead almost too rigorously. It has cut off a manageable part of
  the vast problem of world peace and seems well on the way to manage it. That
  is exemplary&mdash;if limited. To manage a sample is to go some way toward
  demonstrating that the whole is manageable. A war on the Pacific has been
  averted, I think, at least for some years. But the more general problem of
  world peace as one whole, the problem of ending war for good, still remains
  untouched, and it is well to bear in mind that that is so.</p>

  <p>It is impossible not to contrast this phase in the life of the Washington
  Conference with the great propositions of the opening days, when President
  Harding was speaking at Arlington and in the Continental Building of making
  an end to offensive&mdash;and with that of defensive&mdash;war forever in the
  world. It is impossible to ignore this shrinkage of aim and to refrain from
  measuring the vast omissions. That prelude, one perceives, was the prelude to
  something greater than this present conference, and more than this conference
  must ensue from it. The haggling and adjustment that is now going on in the
  committee of five powers on naval limitation and in the committee of nine
  powers on the Pacific settlement I will not attempt to follow. It is a matter
  for the experts and diplomatists; the public is concerned not with the
  methods of the wrangle but with the general purport and practical
  outcome.</p>

  <p>We of the general public are incapable of judging upon the merits of
  battle cruisers and the possible limits to the size of submarines. Our
  concern is to see such things grow rarer and rarer until they disappear. I
  will not apologize, therefore, for going outside the conference chamber for
  the matter of my next few papers. I will go back from Mr. Secretary Hughes
  and his proposals and their consequences to President Harding and to the
  great expectations with which the conference assembled.</p>

  <p>These expectations looked not merely to an arrest of international
  competition on the Pacific, and to giving threatened China a breathing time
  to bring itself up to modern conditions j they looked frankly toward the
  establishment of a world peace. But so far as Europe goes, where as M.
  Briand's speech reminded us, the nations are locked together in a state of
  extreme danger, the conference has as yet done nothing. It is quite possible
  to believe that it. will do very little. It is doubtful if the peace of
  Europe can ever be dealt with effectually in Washington. The troubles of the
  European Continent are an old, intricate story, and I believe the attitude
  ascribed here to the American Centre and West, the attitude of "let Europe
  solve her own international problems and not bother us with them," is a
  thoroughly sound and wise one. America has neither the time and attention to
  spare nor the particular understandings needed to grasp the tangled
  difficulties of Europe. Such initiatives as those of President Wilson about
  Danzig and Fiume settle nothing and leave rankling sores. It is up to Europe
  to clear up and simplify itself before it comes into the world arena with
  America.</p>

  <p>It is just within the range of possibility, therefore, that some sort of
  European conference may arise out of the Washington gathering. Such a
  conference is becoming necessary. The divergence in spirit and aim of France
  and Britain that Washington has brought out is not a divergence to be
  smoothed over. Better it should flare now than smoulder later. I have done my
  own small best to exacerbate it, because I believe that a brisk quarrel and
  some plain speaking may clear the air for a better understanding. Europe
  needs ventilation. When France, Britain, Italy and Germany meet together to
  discuss their common interests, cut through their impossible entanglements
  and get rid of their mutual suspicions and precautions with the frankness of
  this Washington gathering, with as open and free a discussion and as ample a
  public participation, European affairs will be on the mend.</p>

  <p>But there is another issue which America cannot keep out of as she can
  keep out of the Franco-German-British situation, and upon this second issue
  the world looks to her for some sort of leadership. So far the Washington
  Conference has excluded any consideration of the economic and financial
  disorder of the world. But that consideration cannot be indefinitely delayed;
  it is becoming pressingly necessary. All the while we are debating here about
  Japanese autocracy and ambitions, and what we really mean by the "open door,"
  and whether we shall have 40,000 or 90,000 tons of submarines, and so on, the
  economic dissolution of the world goes on.</p>

  <p>The immediate effect of partial disarmament, indeed, both in Britain and
  Japan, may be even to increase the economic difficulties of these countries
  by throwing considerable masses of skilled labor out of work. I propose in my
  next paper to discuss this process of economic and social dissolution which
  is now going on throughout the world, beneath the surface of our formal
  international relations. It is the larger reality of the present world
  situation which the brighter, more dramatic incidents of the earlier sessions
  at Washington have for a time thrust out of our attention.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">XIV. &mdash; THE REAL THREAT TO CIVILIZATION</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, November 25</h3>

  <p class="first">In the opening paper of this series I said that Western
civilization was
  undergoing a very rapid process of disorganization, a process that was
  already nearly complete in Russia and that was spreading out to the whole
  world. It is a huge secular process demanding unprecedented collective action
  among the nations if it is to be arrested and I welcome the Washington
  Conference as the most hopeful beginning of such concerted action.</p>

  <p>Now that the Washington Conference has defined its scope and limitations
  and got down to a definite scheme of work it will be well to return to this
  ampler question of the decline in the world's affairs.</p>

  <p>Now there are great numbers of people, more particularly in America, who
  still refuse to recognize this intermittent and variable process, which
  resumes and goes on again and rests steady for a time and then hurries, which
  is taking all that we know as civilization in Europe toward a final
  destruction. The mere statement that this is going on they call "pessimism,"
  and with a sort of genial hostility they oppose any attempt to consider the
  possibility of any action to turn back the evil process.</p>

  <p>I suppose they would call the note of a fire alarm or the toot of a motor
  horn "pessimism"&mdash;until the thing hit them good and hard. It would have
  the same effect of a disagreeable warning and interruption to the even tenor
  of their ways. They argue that this alleged decadence is not going on, or,
  what is from a soundly practical point of view the same thing, that it is
  never going to reach them or anything that they really care for.</p>

  <p>The starvation of Russia down to an empty shell, the break up of China,
  the retrogression of Southeastern Europe to barbarism, the sinking of
  Constantinople to the level of a drunken brothel, the steadily approaching
  collapse of Germany, is nothing to these "optimists." America is all right,
  anyhow, and am I my brother's keeper? It is just a phase of misfortune "over
  there" and the people must get out of it as they can.</p>

  <p>Wait for the swing of the pendulum, the turn of the tide. Things will come
  right again&mdash;over the heaps of dead. There have been such slumps before
  in those countries away over there, notoriously less favored by God, as they
  are, than America.</p>

  <p>It may be well therefore to go over this matter a little more fully and to
  give my grounds for supposing that there is a rot, a coming undone, going on
  in our system, that will not necessarily recover&mdash;that the movement
  isn't the swing of a pendulum, nor this ebb an ebb that will turn again. And
  further, that this rotting process is bound to affect not merely Europe and
  Asia, but ultimately America.</p>

  <p>Now let us recapitulate in the most general terms what has happened and is
  happening at the present time to impoverish and disorganize the world. First,
  there has been a very great destruction of life through the war, especially
  in Europe. Mostly this has been the killing of young men who would otherwise
  have been the flower of the working mass of these countries at the present
  time. This in itself is a great loss of energy, but it is a recoverable loss.
  A new generation is already growing up to replace these millions of dead and
  to efface the economic loss of this tragic and sorrowful destruction.</p>

  <p>Nor is the extraordinary waste of property, of energy and raw material
  spent in mere destruction, an irreplaceable loss. Given toil, given courage,
  devastated areas can be restored, fresh energies found to replenish the
  countless millions and millions of foot pounds of work wasted upon
  explosives. Many beautiful things, buildings, works of art and the like have
  gone, never to be gotten again, but their place may conceivably be taken by
  new efforts of creative, artistic energy, given toil, given confidence and
  hope.</p>

  <p>Far more serious, from the point of view of the future, than the
  destruction of either things or lives, are certain subtler destructions,
  because they strike at that toil, that courage and hope and confidence which
  are essential to any sort of recuperation.</p>

  <p>And foremost is the fact of debt, everywhere, but particularly in the
  European countries. All the billions worth of material that was smashed up
  and blown to pieces on the front had to be bought from its owners and to
  secure it every belligerent Government had to incur debts. Lives cost little,
  but material much. The European combatants are overwhelmed with debts, every
  European worker and toiler, every European business man, is a debtor; every
  European enterprise goes on under a crushing burden of taxation because of
  these debts. An attempt has been made to shift this unendurable burden from
  the victors to the vanquished, but the vanquished already had as much as they
  could carry.</p>

  <p>Now when first mankind began to experiment with money and credit the lot
  of the debtor was an intolerable one. He might become the slave of his
  creditor, he might be subjected to imprisonment and frightful punishments.
  But it was early discovered that it was not to the general advantage, it was
  not even to the advantage of the creditor, to drive the debtor to despair.
  Processes of bankruptcy were devised to clear him up, get what was possible
  from him and then release him to a fresh start and hope.</p>

  <p>But we have not yet extended the same leniency to national bankruptcy
  because national insolvencies have been rare. And so we have whole nations in
  Europe so loaded with debts and punitive charges that every worker, every
  business man, will be under his share in this burden from the cradle to the
  grave. He will be a debt serf to the domestic or foreign creditor and all his
  enterprises will be weighed and discouraged by this obligation. Debt is one
  immense and universal discouragement now throughout all Europe.</p>

  <p>But even that might not prevent the recovery of Europe. There is yet
  another and pro-founder evil in operation to prevent people "getting to work"
  to reconstruct their shattered economic life. That is the increasing failure
  of money to do its work. Europe cannot get to work, cannot get things going
  again, because over a large part of the world the medium of exchange has
  become untrustworthy and unusable. That is the immediate thing that is
  destroying civilization in the Old World.</p>

  <p>We have to remember that our whole economic order is based on money. We do
  not know any way of working a big business, a manufactory, a large farm, a
  mine, except by money payments. Payment in kind, barter and the like are
  ancient and clumsy expedients; you cannot imagine a great city like New York
  getting along with its industrial and business life on any such clumsy basis.
  Every modern city, London, Paris, Berlin, is built on a money basis and will
  collapse into utter ruin, as Petersburg has already collapsed, if money
  fails. But over large and increasing areas of Europe money is now of such
  fluctuating value, its purchasing power is so uncertain, that men will
  neither work for it, nor attempt to save it, nor make any monetary bargains
  ahead.</p>

  <p>Such a thing has never occurred to anything like the same extent in all
  history, and it is killing business enterprise altogether and throwing whole
  masses of working people out of employment.</p>

  <p>Europe without trustworthy money is as paralyzed as a brain without
  wholesome blood. She cannot act, she cannot move. Employment becomes
  impossible and production dies away. The towns move steadily toward the
  starvation that has overtaken Petersburg and the peasants and cultivators
  cease to grow anything except to satisfy their own needs. To go to market
  with produce, except to barter, is a mockery. The schools are not working,
  the hospitals, the public services; the teachers and doctors and officials
  cannot live upon their pay, they starve or go away.</p>

  <p>This state of affairs has been brought about by the reckless manufacture
  of paper money by nearly every European Government; we can measure their
  recklessness roughly by comparing their pre-war and post-war exchanges. It is
  only now that we are beginning to realize the enormity of the disaster which
  this demoralization of money is bringing upon the world.</p>

  <p>We have weakened the link of cash payments, which has hitherto held
  civilization together, to the breaking point. As the link breaks, the machine
  stops. The modern city will become a formless mob of unemployed men and the
  countryside will become a wilderness of food-hoarding peasants&mdash;and
  since the urban masses will have no food and no means of commanding it, we
  may expect the most violent perturbations before they are persuaded to accept
  their fate in a philosophical spirit.</p>

  <p>Eevolutionary social outbreaks are not the results of plots; they are
  symptoms of social disease. They are not causes but effects. This is what I
  mean when I write of a breakdown of civilization. I mean the death of town
  life, which cannot go on without money and the cessation of organized
  communications. I mean a breakdown of the organizations for keeping the
  peace. I mean an end to organized education.</p>

  <p>I mean the smashing of this social order in which we live, through the
  smashing of money, which has already occurred to a large extent in Kussia,
  which is going on in many parts of Eastern Europe, which seems likely to
  occur within a few months in Germany, which may spread into Italy and France,
  and so to Britain, and even to the American continent, and which can only be
  arrested by the most vigorous collection action to restore validity to
  money.</p>

  <p>Of which vigorous collective action there is in Washington at the present
  moment no sign.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">XV. &mdash; THE POSSIBLE BREAKDOWN OF CIVILIZATION</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, November 26</h3>

  <p class="first">In a previous paper I have set out the plain facts of the
condition of
  Central and Eastern Europe. It is a break-up of the modern civilization
  system, due to the smashing up of money, without which organized town life,
  factory production, education and systematic communications are unworkable.
  If it goes on unchecked to its natural conclusion, Central and Eastern Europe
  will follow Russia to a condition in which the towns will be dying or dead,
  empty and ruinous, the railroads passing out of use, and in which few people
  will be left alive except uneducated and degenerating peasants and farmers,
  growing their own food and keeping a rough order among themselves in their
  own fashion. We are faced, indeed with a return to barbarism over all these
  areas. They are going back to the conditions of rural Asia Minor or the
  Balkans.</p>

  <p>How far is this degeneration going to spread?</p>

  <p>Let us recognize at once that it need spread no further. It is not an
  inevitable process. It could be arrested, it could be turned back and a rapid
  restoration of our shattered civilization could be set going right away if
  the leading powers of the world, sinking their political ambitions for a
  time, could meet frankly to work out a bankruptcy arrangement that would
  release the impoverished nations from debt and give them again a valid money,
  a stable money with a trustworthy exchange value, that could be accepted with
  confidence and saved without deterioration. Upon that things could be set
  going again quite hopefully. Education has not so degenerated as yet, habits
  of work and trading and intercourse are still strong enough to make such a
  recovery possible.</p>

  <p>Except perhaps in Russia. Russia, for all we know, may have sunken very
  deep.</p>

  <p>But if there is no vigorous world effort made soon the trading class, the
  foreman class, the technically educated class, the professional class, the
  teachers, and so forth, will have been broken up and dispersed. These classes
  are comparatively easy to destroy, extremely hard to reconstruct. Modern
  civilization will really have been destroyed, if not for good, for a long
  period, over great areas if these classes go.</p>

  <p>And the process is at present still spreading rapidly. If it gets
  Germany&mdash;and it seems to be getting Germany&mdash;then Italy may follow.
  Italy is linked very closely to Germany economically and financially. The
  death of Germany will chill the economic blood of Italy. Italy is
  passionately anxious to disarm on land and sea. But Italy cannot disarm while
  France maintains a great army and makes great naval preparations. France's
  refusal to disarm pre-vents Italy from disarming. The lira sways and sinks;
  its value fluctuates not perhaps so widely as do marks and kronen but much
  too widely for healthy industrial life and social security. And Italy is
  troubled by its restless nationalists, a whooping flag-waving crew of
  posturing adventurers without foresight or any-genuine love of country. If
  nothing is done, I think I would give Germany about six months and North
  Italy two years before a revolutionary collapse occurs.</p>

  <p>And France?</p>

  <p>This new rhetorical France which remains heavily armed while no man
  threatens, which builds new ships to fight non-existent German armies and
  guards itself against the threats of long dead German Generals&mdash;one of
  M. Briand's hair-raising quotations is to be found in the Encyclopaedia
  Britannica and must be nearly twenty years stale&mdash;the renascent France
  which jostles against Italy and England and believes that it can humbug
  America for good and all while it does these things, will it pull through
  amid the general disaster of Europe! Will it achieve its manifest ambition
  and remain dominant in Europe, the dominance of the last survivor, the cock
  upon the dunghill of a general decay? I doubt it.</p>

  <p>Watch the franc upon the exchange as the true meaning of the French search
  for "security" dawns upon the world. Watch the subscription to the next
  French loan to pay for more submarines and more Senegalese. It may prove to
  be too difficult a feat, after all, for France to wreck the rest of Europe,
  to destroy her commerce by destroying her customers, and yet to save herself.
  When France begins to break, she may break very quickly. Under the surface of
  this exuberant French patriotism runs a deep tide of Communism, raw and red
  and insanely logical.</p>

  <p>We talk of the saner, graver France, the substantial France, that is
  masked by the rhetoric of M. Briand and the flag-waving French nationalists,
  of a France generous enough to help a fallen foe and great enough to think of
  the welfare of mankind. I wish we could hear more of that saner France. And
  soon. I can see nothing but a warlike orator, empty and mischievous, leading
  France and all Europe to destruction. I do not see that it is possible for a
  France of armaments and adventures to dance along the edge of the abyss
  without falling in.</p>

  <p>When we pass out of the Continental to the Atlantic system and consider
  the case of Britain we find a country with a stabler exchange and a tradition
  of social give and take stronger and deeper than that of any other country in
  Europe. But she is not a self-maintaining country. Her millions live very
  largely on overseas trade. She is helplessly dependent upon the prosperity of
  other countries, and particularly of Europe; the ebb of prosperity abroad
  means ebb for her at home. No other country feels so acutely the economic
  prostration of Germany; no other country suffers so greatly from the restless
  activities of France. She is struggling along now with unprecedented masses
  of unemployed workers, and the state of affairs abroad offers no hope of any
  diminution of this burden. The housing of her great population has
  degenerated greatly since the war began; she cannot continue to feed, clothe
  nor educate her people as she used to do unless the decay of Continental
  Europe is arrested.</p>

  <p>I do not know what political form of expression a great distress in
  Britain might take. The tendency toward revolutionary violence is not very
  evident in the British temperament, but people who are slow to move are often
  slow to stop. The slow violence of the English might not find expression in
  revolution and might not expend itself internally. They might get resentful
  about France&mdash;and perhaps G-ermany might be feeling resentful about
  France too. But I will confess that I cannot yet imagine what an acutely
  distressed Britain might or might not do. Yet it is plain to me that the
  shadow that lies so dark over. Petrograd stretches as far as London.</p>

  <p>Such, compactly, is the condition of Europe today. I submit to the reader
  that it is a fair statement of facts in common knowledge. This is not the
  Europe of the diplomatists and publicists; it is the Europe of reality and
  the common man. It is a process of decline and fall going on under our eyes,
  swifter and more extensive than the decline and fall of the Boman Empire in
  the fourth and fifth centuries. Its immediate cause is the destruction of the
  monetary system under the burden of war expenditure and war debts. And the
  only possible hope that it may be arrested lies in a prompt and vigorous
  world conference to put an end to war expenditures, including even these
  French war expenditures that M. Briand's admirers find so justifiable; to
  extinguish debts and reinstate stable and trustworthy money in the world.</p>

  <p>There is no evidence yet that the Washington Conference will take up this
  task or will even contemplate this task. I find myself in the trough of the
  waves today and less confident of the outcome, even the limited outcome, of
  things here. I am increasingly doubtful whether the conference will get as
  far in the direction of a stabilized Pacific as I hoped a few days ago.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16">XVI. &mdash; WHAT OF AMERICA?</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, November 28</h3>

  <p class="first">In my next article I will report progress of the Washington
Conference; in
  this I will go on with my account in general terms of what is happening in
  the world.</p>

  <p>I have written of a progressive rapid dissolution of our civilized
  organization as the dominant fact of the present time. It is very hard indeed
  to keep it in one's mind here in this city of plenty and lavish light that
  anything of the sort is going on. It is amazing how they splash light about
  here; the Capitol shines all night like a full moon, an endless stream of
  light pours down the Washington Obelisk, light blinks and glitters and spins
  about and spills all over the city.</p>

  <p>I find it hard to realize the reality of the collapse here myself, and yet
  I have seen the streets of one great European city in full daylight as dead
  and empty as a skull. I have sought my destination in the chief thoroughfare
  of another European capital at night by means of a pocket electric torch. I
  at least ought to keep these memories of desolation clear before me.</p>

  <p>I do not see how Americans who have never seen anything of the wrecked
  state of Eastern Europe and the shabbiness and privation of the Centre can be
  expected to feel and see the vision I find it so hard to keep vivid in my
  thoughts. Here is a country where money is still good; the $10 notes in my
  pocket assure me I can go down to the Treasury here and get gold for them
  whenever I think fit. (I believe them so thoroughly that I do not even think
  fit.) My intimations of the progressive dissolution over there must read like
  a gloomy fiction. And it is the hardest, most important fact in the
  world.</p>

  <p>Everywhere here there is festival. I go to splendid balls, to glittering
  receptions; I am whirled off to a most hilarious barbecue, an ox in chains,
  roasts and drips over a wood fire&mdash;think of that in Russia! Thanksgiving
  Day-was an inordinate feast. The portions of food they give you in hotels,
  clubs and restaurants are enormous, by present European standards; one seems
  always to be eating little bits and throwing the rest away.</p>

  <p>Neither New York nor Washington shows a trace yet, that I can see, of the
  European shadow. There is much unemployment, but not enough yet to alarm
  people. Nothing of it has struck upon my perceptions either here or in New
  York. In the midst of this gay prosperity comes a letter from my wife
  describing how the police had to censor the bitter inscriptions upon the
  wreaths that were laid upon the London cenotaph on Armistice Day and how the
  veterans of the Great War who marched in the unemployed processions in London
  wore pawn tickets in the place of their medals.</p>

  <p>I am forced by these contrasts to the question: "Suppose America patches
  up a fairly stable peace with Japan; lets Japan accumulate in Manchuria,
  Siberia, and finally China; cuts her naval expenditure to nothing, and allows
  the rest of the world, including the old English-speaking home, to slide and
  go over into the abyss&mdash;apart from the moral loss, will she suffer very
  greatly!"</p>

  <p>That is a very interesting speculation.</p>

  <p>I think she may adjust herself to a self-contained system and, in a sense,
  pull through. It may involve some very severe stresses. At present she grows
  more food than she can eat or waste; she exports foodstuffs. The American
  farmer sells so much of his produce for export, not a very great percentage,
  but enough to form an important item in his affairs. Given a Europe and Asia
  too impoverished and broken up to import food stuffs, that trade goes. The
  American farmer will have to sell to a shrunken demand; he will have either
  to shrink himself or undersell his fellow farmer. This will mean bad times
  for the American farmer as Europe sinks; farmers will be unable to buy as
  freely as usual; many agriculturists will be going out of business.</p>

  <p>Firms like Ford will be ambarrassed by overproduction. American
  manufacturers are also, to a very marked but not overwhelming extent,
  exporters and much of their internal trade is to the farmers&mdash;whose
  purchasing power will be diminishing. Bad times for the industrial regions
  also will follow the European disaster, perhaps even very bad times. New York
  and the Eastern cities, so far as the overseas traffic goes, may suffer
  exceptionally. For them there may be less power of recovery, for with the
  fall of Europe into barbarism, the centre of American interests will shift to
  the interior. But after a series of crises, a lot of business failures and so
  on, I do not see why the United States&mdash;if there is no war with
  Japan&mdash;very little reduced from the large splendor of its present
  habits, should not still be getting along in a fashion. America is not tied
  up to the European system, to live and die with it, as France or Britain is
  tied.</p>

  <p>And there is a limit also to the areas of the Old World affected by the
  collapse of the cash and credit system in Europe. Outside the European
  seacoast towns, Asia Minor is not likely to go much lower than it is at
  present, though most of Europe sink to the level of the Balkans and Asia
  Minor. The dissolution of Asia Minor resulted from the great wars of the
  Eastern Empire and Persia; all that land was ruined country before the days
  of Islam. It has never recovered and Europe may never recover.</p>

  <p>Given an enfeebled Britain, there will probably be a collapse into
  conflict and discord throughout most of India; and China, unhelped, may
  continue in a state of confusion which is steadily destroying her ancient
  educated class and her ancient traditions without replacing them by any
  modernized educational organization. But here again upon the Western Pacific
  there may be regions which need not go the whole way down to citylessness,
  illiteracy and the peasant life.</p>

  <p>Japan is still solvent and energetic, the war has probably strained her
  very little more than it has strained America, and her participation in the
  world credit system is still so recent that, like America, she may be able to
  draw herself together and maintain herself and expand her rule and culture,
  unimpeded, over the whole of Eastern Asia. She will be the more able to do
  this if a phase of disarmament gives her time to rest and consolidate before
  her expansion is resumed. A war between Japan and America would be a long and
  costly affair and it would no doubt topple both powers into the same process
  of dissolution in which Europe now welters, but I am assuming that America
  takes no risk of such a war for the sake of China or suchlike remote cause
  and that Japan is not eager for California. An America indifferent to the
  fall of Europe would probably not trouble itself seriously if presently
  Australia came under Japanese domination. It would not trouble&mdash;until
  the Monroe Doctrine was invaded. And it would get along very comfortably and
  happily.</p>

  <p>So far as material considerations go, therefore, there is not much force
  in an appeal to the ordinary plain man in America to interest himself, much
  less to exert himself, in the tangled troubles of Europe and Asia now. He can
  remain as proudly "isolated" as his fathers; he can refuse help, he can
  "avoid entangling alliances," and rely on his own strength; he can weather
  the smash, insist on pressing any sparks of recovery out of the European
  debtor, and so far as he and his children, and possibly even his children's
  children, are concerned, America can expect to go on living an extremely
  tolerable life. There will still be plenty of Fords, plenty of food, movies
  and other amusing inventions; seed time, harvest and thanksgiving; no
  armament and very light taxation and as high a percentage of moral,
  well-regulated lives as any community has ever shown upon this planet. Until
  that long-distant time when the great Asiatic Empire of Japan turns its
  attention seriously to expansion in the New World. So far as present material
  considerations go....</p>

  <p>But I belong to one of the races that have populated America. I know the
  imagination of my own people and something of most of the peoples who have
  sent their best to this land, I have watched the people here, and listened to
  them and read about them; there has been no degeneration here but progress
  and invigor-ation, and I will not believe that the American spirit, distilled
  from all the best of Europe, will tolerate this surrender of the future, this
  quite hoggish abandonment of the leadership of mankind that continuing
  isolation implies.</p>

  <p>The American people has grown great unawares; it still does not realize
  its immense predominance now in wealth, in strength, in hope, happiness and
  unbroken courage among the children of men. The cream of all the white races
  did not come to this continent to reap and sow and eat and waste, smoke in
  its shirtsleeves in a rocking-chair, and let the great world from which its
  fathers came go hang. It did not come here for sluggish ease. It came here
  for liberty and to make the new beginning of a greater civilization upon our
  globe. The years of America's growth and training are coming to an end, the
  phase of world action has begun. All America is too small a world for the
  American people; the world of their interest now is the whole round
  world.</p>

  <p>I have no doubt of the heart and enterprise of America&mdash;if America
  understands.</p>

  <p>But does America understand the scale and urgency of the present
  situation? Is she prepared to act now? This decadence of Europe is
  urgent&mdash;urgent. So far, this Washington Conference has not touched more
  than the outer threads of the writhing international tangle that has to be
  dealt with if European civilization is to be saved.</p>

  <p>So far, these economic and financial troubles which are already at a
  crisis of disaster in Europe have been treated as though they did not exist.
  But they are the very heart of the trouble across the Atlantic, and with
  America, the rich creditor of all Europe and the holder of most of the gold
  in the world, lie enormous possibilities of salvation. The political
  situation becomes more and more subordinated to the economic.</p>

  <p>If America is willing, America is able to reinstate Europe and turn back
  the decline, and she is in so strong a position that she can make the
  effectual permanent disarmament of Europe a primary condition of her
  assistance. If she have the clearness of mind to set aside the eloquent
  apologetics of that one power that is still militant, adventurous and
  malignant among the ruins, she can oblige the remnant of Europe to get
  together and settle outstanding differences by the sheer strength of her
  financial controls. She can demand a "League to Enforce Peace" and she can
  enforce it.</p>

  <p>Will she do that now, or will she let this occasion pass from
  her&mdash;never to return?</p>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17">XVII. &mdash; EBB TIDE AT WASHINGTON</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, November 28</h3>

  <p class="first">The League of Nations was the first American initiative
toward an
  organized world peace. Its beginning, the world-wide enthusiasm evoked by its
  early promise, its struggle to exist, its abandonment by America, its
  blunders and omissions and the useful, incomplete body that now represents it
  at Geneva, are the material of an immense conflicting literature. For a time
  at least the League is in the background. It has not kept hold of the popular
  imagination of the world.</p>

  <p>I will not touch here upon the mistakes and disputes, the possible
  arrogance, the possible jealousies, the inadvisable compromises, the
  unnecessary concessions that made the League a lesser thing than it promised
  to be. I will not discuss why so entirely American a project, into which many
  nations came mainly to please America, failed to retain the official support
  of the American Government. Of such things the historian or the novelist may
  write but not the journalist. The fact remains that the project was a project
  noble and hopeful in its beginnings, a very great thing indeed in human
  history, a dawn in the darkness of international conflict and competition, an
  adventure which threw a halo of greatness about the Nation that produced it
  and about that splendid and yet so humanly limited man who has been chiefly
  identified with its promise and its partial failure.</p>

  <p>It was, I insist, very largely an American idea, and only America, because
  of her freedom from the complex and bitter-spirited traditions of the
  European Foreign Offices, could have brought such a proposal into the arena
  of practical politics. The American Nation is exceptionally free from ancient
  traditions of empire, ascendancy, expansion, glory and the like. It is
  haunted by a dream, an obstinate recurrent dream, of a whole world organized
  for peace. It comes back to that with a notable persistence.</p>

  <p>The League of Nations stands now, as it were, on the shelf, an experiment
  not wholly satisfactory, not wholly a failure, destined for searching
  reconsideration at no distant date. Meanwhile, the American mind, with much
  freshness and boldness, has produced this second experiment, in a widely
  different direction, the First Washington Conference for the Limitation of
  Armaments. The League of Nations was too definite and cramped in its
  constitution, too wide in its powers. It was a premature superstate. One
  standard objection, and a very reasonable one, was that America might be
  outvoted by quite minor powers and be obliged to undertake responsibilities
  for which it had no taste. The second experiment, therefore, has been tried,
  very properly, with the loosest of constitutions, and the most severely
  defined and limited of aims. We are beginning to see that it too is an
  experiment, likely to be successful within its limits but again not wholly
  satisfactory. Instead of a world constitution we have had a world
  conversation.</p>

  <p>That conversation has passed from the open sessions of the conference to
  the two commit^ tees of five upon the limitation of land and sea armaments
  and the Pacific Committee of nine. In all these committees there are wide
  fluctuations of thought and temper. There are daily communications to the
  press from this committee or that, from this delegation or that, from a score
  of propagandas. It is really not worth the while of the ordinary citizen to
  follow these squabbles and flights and recriminations and excitements.
  Certain broad principles have been established. The ordinary citizen will be
  advised to hold firmly to these and see that he gets them carried
  through.</p>

  <p>And now there has been a decided ebb in the high spirit of the conference.
  These disputes about details have produced a considerable amount of fatigue,
  attention is fatigued and the exploit of M. Briand has for a time shattered
  and confused the general mentality. The American public was in a state of
  pure and simple enthusiasm for peace and disarmament and quite unprepared for
  the exploit of M. Briand. Like all serious shocks, it did not at first
  produce its full result.</p>

  <p>The mood was so amiable here, so eager for cheering and emotional human
  brotherhood, that when France, in the person of M. Briand, snapped her
  fingers at the mere idea of disarmament and quoted a twenty-year-old passage
  from a dead German Field Marshal to justify a vast army and an aggressive
  naval programme in the face of an exhausted Europe, there was a touching
  disposition on the part of a considerable section of the American press to
  greet this display as in some way conducive to our millennial efforts. Only a
  few of us called a spade a spade right away and declined to pretend that the
  irony and restrained indignation of Mr. Balfour and Signor Schanzer were
  "indorsements" of M. Briand's stupendous claim that France with her
  submarines and Senegalese might do as she pleased in Europe.</p>

  <p>The facts that the caustic and restrained utterances of these gentlemen
  could be so construed, and that the London <i>Daily Mail</i> should attempt
  to break and mutilate my comments on the French attitude, demonstrate beyond
  doubt the need there was for the utmost outspokenness in this matter. But the
  situation is now better realized. The air is already clearer for the
  outburst. France, we realize, has to stop bullying Germany and threatening
  Italy; Europe can only be saved by the honest and unreserved co-operation of
  Italy, France and Britain for mutual aid and reassurance.</p>

  <p>The repercussion of the Franco-British clash was immediately evident upon
  the other issues of the conference. The practical refusal of France to join
  in the generous renunciations of America and Britain, the feeling of
  insecurity created in Western Europe weakened Britain in her ability to work
  with America on the Pacific for a secure China and for restraint upon the
  possible imperialism of Japan. Britain, cannot do that with a hostile
  neighbor behind her and an uncertain America at her side, and the prospects
  of a free China and for an effective limitation of the Japanese naval
  strength were greatly imperilled. Japanese demands stiffened. "Ten to six,"
  said America, "Ten to seven," answered Japan.</p>

  <p>The effect upon what I might call the Washington state of mind throughout
  the world was depressing. The easy onrush of the opening days was checked.
  Here was hard work ahead, complications, the traditions and mental habits of
  two great European peoples were in conflict and had somewhat to be adjusted
  if we were to get on. The Anglo-French Entente, we discovered, was in a very
  unsatisfactory state; it had suddenly to be sent to the wash and the washing
  had to be done in public, and this happened at a phase of lassitude. In the
  ebb of the great enthusiasm all sorts of buried rocks and shoals became
  apparent again. Party politics reappeared&mdash;and remained showing.</p>

  <p>I am an innocent child in American politics; I know that I make my artless
  remarks upon these things at considerable peril. But I gather from the self-
  betrayals of one or two influential people that things are somewhat in this
  frame. The Democrats feel that so far they have been almost supernaturally
  "good" about the conference. They haven't said a word by way of criticism;
  they have hailed and helped and smiled and cheered. Still If things should so
  turn out that a kind of insufficiency should appear, and if people's minds
  should revert thereupon toward the Democratic League of Nations idea, so much
  under a cloud at present, it would be rather more than human not to feel a
  faint gleam of pleasure and perhaps even to give the gentlest of pushes to
  the process of disillusionment.</p>

  <p>And on the other hand, there betrays itself now and then a slight nervous
  eagerness on the part of loyal rather than good Eepublicans to call anything
  that happens a success and to become indignant when, as in the case of the
  Briand oration, a spade is called a spade. And that childish, undignified
  and dwindling tendency of certain American types to regard all foreign powers
  in general, and Britain in particular, as forever engaged in diabolical
  machinations against the peace and purity of American life is also
  incresingly evident. There is an open, if incoherent, press campaign against
  disarmament, against the British, against foreigners generally,
  against&mdash;any troublesome thing you like.</p>

  <p>These are ebb tide phenomena. These are the limitations of our poor
  humanity under fatigue. None the less, matters have to be thrashed out and
  will be thrashed out. As I said in the beginning, it is hard to keep
  hold.</p>

  <p>And so it was high time that the President, who embodies so much of the
  simplicity and strength of that real America, in which I am a profound and
  obstinate believer, should come back into the limelight from which he receded
  after delivering his great speech and leaving the chair on the opening day of
  the conference. In the indirect way customary with Presidents here he has
  been making some very important pronouncements.</p>

  <p>My friend Mr. Michelson some days ago published a sketch of very important
  proposals that had already received wide support in the informal discussions
  that pervade Washington&mdash;for partial rescinding of the Allied debts,
  subject to disarmament conditions, to be considered by a second conference to
  be presently assembled. Following on this news the President has been talking
  for publication of a third experiment in the form of a second Washington
  Conference to take up these issues. And he has also been talking of a third
  conference to confirm and go on with the disarmament arrangements, a
  conference at which Germany and the Spanish-speaking powers, if not Russia,
  are apparently to have a voice. Such a periodic repetition of the conference
  would presently organize itself for a continuing life and so develop
  gradually and naturally into that Association of Nations we are all
  seeking.</p>

  <p>These are refreshing promises in these days of ebb; they show that the
  impulse that began so splendidly two weeks ago is not dead, that the tide
  rises toward world discussion and world organized peace will flow again
  presently, wider and stronger than its previous flow. And meanwhile these
  frank discussions of attitude and detail must go on; they cannot be ignored,
  but at the same time they must not be magnified into incurable quarrels and
  insurmountable difficulties. They are unavoidable and necessary things, but
  not the big things, the main things. While the tide is out our main projects,
  stranded in this estuary that leads perhaps to the ocean of peace, must needs
  keel over and look askew; we must scrape our keels, calk leaks and wait for
  the great waters to return.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; AMERICA AND ENTANGLING ALLIANCES</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, November 30</h3>

  <p class="first">The power of the American impulse toward a world peace is
undeniable. It
  has produced in succession the great dream of a League of Nations and now
  this second great dream of a gradually developing Association of Nations
  arising out of a series of such conferences as this one. No other nation
  could have raised such hopes and no other political system has the freedom of
  action needed to give these projects the substance and dignity which the
  initiative of the head of the state involves.</p>

  <p>But if these projects are to carry through into the world of accomplished
  realities, if in a lifetime or so this glorious dream of a world
  peace&mdash;going on, as a world at peace must now inevitably do, from
  achievement to achievement&mdash;if that dream is to be realized, certain
  peculiarities of the American people and the American situation have at no
  very distant date to be faced.</p>

  <p>All such gatherings and conferences as this are haunted by a peculiar
  foggy ghost called "Tact," which is constantly seeking to cover up and
  conceal and obliterate some vitally important but rather troublesome reality
  in the matter. "Tact" is apparently a modern survival of the ancient "Tabu."
  For example, a pleasant Indian gentleman sits among the British delegates at
  the conference; "Tact" demands that no one shall ever ask him or of him,
  "What do you conceive will be the place of India in that great World
  Association half a century ahead? Will it still be a British appendix?" And
  "Tact" becomes hysterical at the slightest whisper of the word "Senegalese,"
  or any inquiry about the possible uses of the French submarine. And a third
  question, hitherto veiled by "Tact" under the very thickest wrappings of fog,
  to which, greatly daring, I propose to address myself now, is: "How far is
  America really prepared to fix and adhere to any wide schemes for the
  permanent adjustment of the worlds affairs that may be arrived at by this
  conference or its successors?"</p>

  <p>The other day a friend of mine in New York made a profoundly wise remark
  to me. "I have found," she said, "that one can have nothing and do nothing
  without paying for it. If you do well or if you do ill, just the same you
  have to pay for it. If a mother wants to do her best by her children, she
  must pay for it, in giving up personal ambitions, dreams of writing or art,
  throughout the best years of life. If a man wants to do his best in business
  or politics, he must sacrifice dreams of travel and adventure." And whatever
  America does with herself in the next few years, she too must be prepared to
  pay.</p>

  <p>If she desires isolation, moral exaltation, irresponsibility and self-
  sufficiency, "America for the Americans and never mind the consequences," she
  must be prepared to witness the decline and fall of the white civilization in
  Europe and the consolidation of a profoundly alien system across the Pacific.
  If, on the other hand, she now takes up this task for which she seems so
  inclined, as the leader and helper of white civilization, the task of
  organizing the permanent peace of the world upon the lines of the system of
  civilization to which she belongs, then for that nobler role also there is a
  price to be paid. She has to assume not only the dignity but the
  responsibilities of leadership. She has not merely to express noble
  sentiments, but to lay hold upon the difficulties and intricacies of the
  problem before her. She has not merely to criticise but to consider and
  sympathize and help, and she has to make decisions and abide by them.</p>

  <p>When America really makes decisions, she abides by them&mdash;vigorously.
  The Monroe Doctrine was such a decision. It has saved South America for South
  Americans; it has saved Europe from a ruinous scramble for the Spanish
  inheritance. It was the first great feat of Americanism in world politics.
  The exponents of "Tact" will, I know, be outraged by the reminder that for a
  long time tacit approval of Britain and the existence of the British fleet
  provided a support and shield to the Monroe Doctrine, and also by the further
  reminder that the one serious attack upon it was made by Napoleon III. during
  the American Civil War&mdash;at which time, I admit, the attitude of Great
  Britain to the disunited States was also far from impeccable. But helped or
  assailed, the Monroe Doctrine held good.</p>

  <p>The Washington Conference has developed a position with regard to the
  Pacific that calls for an American decision of equal vigor. It is as plain as
  daylight that Japanese liberal tendencies can be supported and the aggressive
  ambitions of Japanese imperialism can be restrained, that China can be saved
  for the Chinese and Eastern Siberia from foreign conquest, provided America
  places herself unequivocally side by side with Great Britain and France in
  framing and sustaining a definite system of guarantees and prohibitions in
  Eastern Asia. The Anglo-Japanese agreement could be ended in favor of such a
  new peace-pact and an enormous step forward toward world peace be made. It
  would mark an epoch in world statecraft.</p>

  <p>But this means an agreement of the nature of a treaty; a mere Presidential
  declaration, which means some later President might set aside or some newly
  elected Senate reverse, is not enough. If the reader will study the position
  of Australia and of the British commitments in Eastern Asia, he will see why
  it is not enough. Britain is not strong enough to risk being left alone as
  the chivalrous protector of a weak, if renascent, China. She has her own
  people in Australia to consider. And besides, Britain alone&mdash;as the
  protector of China&mdash; after all that has happened in the past.... It is
  moral as well as material help in sustaining the new understanding that the
  British will require.</p>

  <p>The plain fact of the Pacific situation is that there are only three
  courses before the world&mdash;either unchallenged Japanese domination in
  Eastern Asia from now on, or a war to prevent it soon, or an alliance of
  America, Britain and Japan, with whatever government China may develop, and
  with the other powers concerned, though perhaps less urgently
  concerned&mdash;an alliance of all these, for mutual restraint and mutual
  protection. And it is an equally plain fact, though "Tact" cries "Hush!" at
  the words, that the tradition of America for a hundred years, a tradition
  which was sustained in her refusal to come into the League of Nations, has
  been against any such alliance.</p>

  <p>George Washington's advice to his countrymen to avoid "permanent
  alliances" for the balance of power and suchlike ends, and Jefferson^
  reiterated council to his countrymen to avoid "entangling alliances" have
  been interpreted too long as injunctions to avoid any alliances whatever,
  entangling or disentangling. The habit of avoiding association in
  balance-of-power schemes and the like has broadened out into a general habit
  of non-association. But alliances which are not aimed at a common enemy but
  only at a common end were not, I submit, within the intention of George
  Washington.</p>

  <p>At any rate, I do not see how the disarmament proposals of Mr. Secretary
  Hughes can possibly be accepted without a Pacific settlement, nor how that
  settlement can be sustained except by some sort of alliance, meeting
  periodically in conference to apply or adapt the settlement to such
  particular issues as may arise. If America is not prepared to go as far as
  that, then I do not understand the enthusiasm of America for the Washington
  Conference. I do not understand the mentality that can contemplate world
  disarmament without at least that much provision for the prevention of future
  conflicts.</p>

  <p>And similarly, I do not see how any effectual disarmament is possible in
  Europe or how any dealing with the economic and financial situation there can
  be possible unless America is prepared to bind itself in an alliance of
  mutual protection and accommodation with at least France, Germany, Britain
  and Italy to sustain a similar series of conferences and adjustments. At the
  back of the French refusal to disarm there is a suppressed demand for a
  protective alliance. That is an entirely reasonable demand. The form of this
  alliance that the French have demanded hitherto is an entangling alliance, an
  alliance of America and Britain and France against, at least, Germany and
  Russia. The necessary alliance to which France and Britain will presently
  assent, and which America will come to recognize as the only way to its
  peacemaking aims, will be against no one; it is an alliance of an entirely
  beneficial character, an alliance not to entangle but to release.</p>

  <p>The disposition of the European delegations and of the British and foreign
  writers at Washington to treat the idea of America making treaties of
  alliance as outside the range of possibility, as indeed an idea tabu, seems
  to me a profoundly mistaken one. It is "Tact" in its extremest form. I have
  heard talk of the " immense inertia" of political dogmas held for a hundred
  years. For "immense inertia" I would rather write "expiring impulse." The
  policy of non-interference in affairs outside America was an excellent thing,
  no doubt, for a young Republic in the self-protective state; it is a policy
  entirely unworthy of a Republic which has now become the predominant state in
  the world.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19">XIX. &mdash; AN ASSOCIATION OF NATIONS</a></h2>

  <p>The futility of the idea of a limitation of armaments or any limitation of
  warfare as a possible remedy for the present distresses of mankind, without
  some sort of permanent settlement of the conflicts of interest and ambition
  which lie at the root of warfare, has grown clearer and clearer with each
  day's work of the "Washington Conference. And the conviction that no
  permanent settlement is conceivable without a binding alliance to sustain it
  also grows stronger each day. For security and peace in the Pacific an
  alliance of at least America, Britain and Japan is imperative, and Britain
  cannot play her part therein unless Europe is safe also, through a binding
  alliance of at least France, Germany, Britain and America. To arrest the
  economic decadence of the world a still wider bond is needed.</p>

  <p>So the inflexible logic of the situation brings ns back to the problem of
  a world alliance and a world guarantee, the problem of which the League of
  Nations was the first attempted solution. The conference is being forced
  toward that ampler problem again, in spite of the severe restrictions of its
  agenda. After President Wilson's "League" comes President Harding's
  "Association." Senator Borah, in alarm, emerges from the silence he has
  hitherto kept during the conference to declare that this "Association" is
  only another name for the "League." On that we may differ from him.
  Association and League are alike in seeking to organize the peace of the
  world but in every other respect they are different schemes, differing in
  aims, scope and spirit.</p>

  <p>The primary difference is that, while the League was a very clearly
  defined thing, planned complete from the outset, a thing as precise and
  inalterable as the United States Constitution, the Harding project is a
  tentative, experimental thing, capable of great adaptations by trial and
  corrected error, a flexible and living thing that is intended to grow and
  change in response to the needs of our perplexing and incalculable world.</p>

  <p>The Harding idea, as it is growing up in peopled minds in Washington,
  seems to be something after this fashion: That this present conference shall
  be followed by others having a sort of genetic relationship to it, varying in
  their scope, in their terms of reference, in the number of states invited to
  participate. A successor to the present one seems to be already imminent in
  the form of a conference on the economic and financial disorder of the world.
  Such a conference would probably include German and Spanish, and possibly
  Russian, representatives, and it might take on in addition to its economic
  discussion any issues that this present conference may leave outstanding.</p>

  <p>These Washington Conferences, it is hoped, will become a sort of
  international habit, will grow into a world institution in which experience
  will determine usages and usage harden into a customary rule. They will
  become by insensible degrees a World Parliament, with an authority that will
  grow or decline with the success or failure of the recommendations.</p>

  <p>One advantage of having experiments made, will occur at once to those who
  have been present at the plenary sittings of the present conference. The
  method of trial and error will afford an opportunity of working out the grave
  inconveniences of the language difficulty. It is plain that, with only three
  languages going, French, Japanese and English, proceedings may easily become
  very tedious; there is no true debate, no possibility of interpolating a
  question or a comment, no real and vivid discussion. The real debating goes
  on in notes and counter notes, in prearranged speeches, communications to the
  press representatives, and so forth.</p>

  <p>The plenary sessions exist only to announce or confirm. They are
  essentially ceremonial. In any polyglot gathering it seems inevitable that
  this should be so. The framers of the League of Nations constitution, with
  its Council and Assembly, seem to have been far too much influenced by the
  analogy of single language governing bodies in which spontaneous discussion
  is frequent and free. World conferences are much more likely to do their work
  by translated correspondence and by private sessions of preparatory
  committees, and to use the general meeting only for announcement, indorsement
  and confirmation.</p>

  <p>But the preparatory committees are only the first organs developed by the
  conference. Certain other organs are also likely to arise out of it as
  necessary to its complete function. Whatever agreements are arrived at here
  about either the limitation of armaments or the permanent regulation of the
  affairs of China and the Pacific, it is clear that they will speedily become
  seed beds of troublesome misunderstanding and divergent interpretation unless
  some sort of permanent body is created in each case, with very wide powers
  intrusted to it by the treaty making authorities of all the countries
  concerned to interpret, defend and apply the provisions of the agreement.
  Such permanent commissions seem to me to be dictated by the practical logic
  of the situation. Quite apart from the later conferences that President
  Harding has promised, a standing Naval Armament Commission and a Pacific
  Commission, with very considerable powers to fix things, seems to be a
  necessary outcome of the First Washington Conference.</p>

  <p>But these two commissions will not cover all the ground involved. This
  conference cannot leave European disarmament and the European situation with
  its present ragged and raw ends. Nothing has been more remarkable, nothing
  deserves closer study by the thoughtful Americans, than the fluctuations of
  the British delegation at this conference with regard to a Pacific
  settlement. I see that able writer upon Chinese affairs, Dr. John Dewey,
  comments upon these changes of front and hints at some profound
  disingenuousness on the part of the British. But the reasons for these
  fluctuations lie on the surface of things. They are to be found in the
  European situation.</p>

  <p>Britain, secure in Europe, unthreatened on her Mediterranean routes, can
  play the part of a strong supporter of American ideals in China. She seems,
  indeed, willing and anxious to do so&mdash;in spite of her past. But
  threatened in Europe, she can do nothing of the sort. She cannot extend an
  arm to help shield China while a knife is held at her throat. So the Pacific
  is entangled with the Mediterranean and the coasts of France, and it becomes
  plain that a Peace Commission for Europe is a third necessary consequence of
  this conference, if this conference is to count as a success.</p>

  <p>Suppose now that this present conference produces the first two
  commissions I have sketched and gives way to a second conference, with an
  ampler representation of the European powers, which will direct its attention
  mainly to the reassurance and disarmament of France and Germany and Britain,
  a second conference whose findings may be finally embodied in this third
  commission I have suggested; and suppose, further, that an International Debt
  and Currency Conference presently gets to effective work, surely we may claim
  that the promised Association of Nations is well on its way towards
  crystallization.</p>

  <p>Simply and naturally, step by step, the President of the United States
  will have become the official summoner of a rudimentary World Parliament. By
  the time that stage is reached a series of important questions of detailed
  organization will have arisen. Each executive commission, as the successive
  conference brings these commissions into being, will require in its several
  spheres agents, officials, a secretariat, a home for its archives, a budget.
  These conferences cannot go on meeting without the development of such a
  living and continuing body of world administration through the commissions
  they must needs create. Presumably that body of commissions will grow up
  mainly in and about Washington. If it does, it will be the most amazing
  addition to Congress conceivable; it will be the voluntary and gradual
  aggregation of a sort of loose World Empire round the monument of George
  Washington.</p>

  <p>But I do not see that all these commissions and Parliaments need sit in
  Washington or that it is desirable that they should. A world commission for
  land disarmament might function in Paris or Borne, a world commission for
  finance in New York or London. And meanwhile, at Geneva or in Vienna, to
  which place there is some project of removal, the League of Nations, that
  first concrete realization of the American spirit, will be going on in its
  own rather cramped, rather too strictly defined lines.</p>

  <p>It also will have thrown out world organizations in connection with
  health, with such world interests as the white slave traffic, and so forth.
  It will be conducting European arbitrations and it will be providing boundary
  commissions and the like. And somewhere there will also be a sort of World
  Supreme Court getting to work upon judicial international differences.</p>

  <p>Now this, I submit, is the way that world unity is likely to arise out of
  our dreams into reality, and this partial, dispersed, experimenting way of
  growth is perhaps the only way in which it can come about. It is not so
  splendid and impressive a vision as that of some World Parliament, some
  perfected League, suddenly flashing into being and assuming the leadership of
  the world. It will not be set up like a pavilion but it will grow like a
  tree. But it is a reality and it comes. The Association of Nations grows
  before our eyes.</p>

  <p>And meanwhile there is an immense task before teachers and writers, before
  parents and talkers and all who instruct and make and change opinion, and
  that is the task of building up a new spirit in the hearts of men and a new
  dream in their minds, the spirit of fellowship to all men, the dream of a
  great world released forever from the obsession of warfare and international
  struggle; a great world of steadily developing unity in which all races and
  all kinds of men will be free to make their distintive contributions to the
  gathering achievements of the race.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap20"
     name="chap20">XX. &mdash; FRANCE AND ENGLAND&mdash;<br>
     THE PLAIN FACTS OF THE CASE</a></h2>

  <p>If we are to have any fundamental improvements in the present relations of
  nations, if we are to achieve that change of heart which is needed as the
  fundamental thing for the establishment of a world peace, then we must look
  the facts of international friction squarely in the face. It is no good
  pretending there is. no jar when there is a jar. This business of the world
  peace effort, of which the Washington Conference is now the centre, is not to
  smooth over international difficulties; it is to expose, examine, diagnose
  and cure them.</p>

  <p>Now here is this Franco-British clash, a plain quarrel and one very
  disturbing to the American audience. The Americans generally don't like this
  quarrel. They are torn between a very strong traditional affection for the
  French and a kind of liking for at least one or two congenial things abont
  the British. They would like to hear no more of it, therefore. They just
  simply want peace. But there the quarrel is. Was it an avoidable quarrel? Or
  was it inevitable? Perhaps it is something very fundamental to the European
  situation. Perhaps if we analyze it and probe right down to the final causes
  of it we may learn something worth while for the aims and ends of the
  Washington Conference.</p>

  <p>Now, let us get a firm hold upon one very important fact, indeed. This
  clash is a clash between the present French Government and the present
  British Government, but it is not a clash between all the French and all the
  British. It is not an outbreak of national antipathy or any horrible,
  irreconcilable thing of that sort. There are elements in France strongly
  opposed to the French Government upon the issues raised in this dispute.
  There is a section of the English press fantastically on the "French" side
  and bitterly opposed even to the public criticism of the public speeches of
  the French Premier in English. The party politics of both France and Britain
  and, what is worse, those bitter animosities that centre upon political
  personalities have got into this dispute.</p>

  <p>It may help to clear the issue if we disregard the attitude of the two
  Governments in naming the sides to the dispute, and if instead of speaking of
  the "French" or the "British" sides we speak of the " Keep-Germany-down " and
  the" Give-Germany-a-chance" sides, or better, if we call them the "
  Insisters," who insist upon the uttermost farthing of repayment and penitence
  from Germany, and the "Believers," who don't. For it is upon Germany that the
  whole dispute turns.</p>

  <p>There is a very powerful "Insister" party in Great Britain; there is a
  growing "Believer" party in France. And while France has been steadily
  "Insister" since the armistice, Britain and the British Government have
  changed round from "Insister" to "Believer" in the last year or so. This
  change has produced extraordinary strains and recriminations between French
  and British political groups and individuals, as such changes of front must
  always do. Such disputes often make far more noise than deep and vital
  national misunderstandings, and it is well that the intelligent observer, and
  particularly the American observer, should distinguish the note of the
  disconcerted party man in a rage from the note of genuine patriotic
  anger.</p>

  <p>The beginnings of the present trouble are to be found in the Versailles
  Conference. There the only "Believers" seem to have been the American
  representatives. Those were the days of the British Khaki election, when
  "Hang the Kaiser!" and "Make the Germans Pay!" were the slogans that carried
  Mr. Lloyd George to power. For about four months the dispute went on between
  moderation and overwhelming demands. America stood alone for moderation. The
  British insisted upon the uttermost farthing, at least as strenously as the
  French, and it was Gen. Smuts, of all people, who added the last straw to the
  intolerable burden of indebtedness that was then piled upon vanquished and
  ruined Germany. And both America and Britain were parties to the arrangements
  that give France the power, the Shylock right, of carving into Germany and
  disintegrating her more and more if Germany fail to keep up with the
  impossible payments that were then fixed upon her.</p>

  <p>The position of the French Government in this business is therefore a
  perfectly legal and logical one. France can adhere, as M. Briand says she
  will, to the Treaty of Versailles, she can flout and disregard any
  disposition of the Washington Conference to qualify or revise that treaty,
  and the British Government, in a hopelessly embarrassed and illogical
  position, can appeal only to the hard logic of reality.</p>

  <p>Britain is much more dependent upon her overseas trade than France, and so
  the British have earlier realized the enormous injury that the social and
  economic breakdown of Russia has done and the still more enormous injury that
  the breaking up of Central European civilization will do.</p>

  <p>"You are quite within your rights," these newly converted "Relievers" say
  to the obdurate "Insisters," "but you will wreck all Europe."</p>

  <p>That idea that the possible destruction of civilization has not yet
  entered so many minds in France as it has in Britain. Germany is nearer to
  France than to Britain, and the fear of a renascent and vindictive Germany is
  greater in France than in Britain. In the French mind, the possibility of a
  German invasion for revenge twenty years hence still overshadows the
  possibility of an economic breakdown in a year or two years* time. The
  British are nearer the breakdown and further from the Germans. That is the
  reality of this Franco-British clash.</p>

  <p>Upon that reality bad temper, party feeling, personal spites, irrational
  prejudices, are building up a great mass of nasty, quarrelsome matter. And
  the French Government and the French nationalist majority are pressing on to
  naval and military preparations that distinctly threaten Britain. It is no
  good pretending that they do not do so when they do. The French submarines
  are aimed at Britain.</p>

  <p>Empty civilities between France and Britain are of no value in a case of
  this sort. Both countries are being worried by their infernal politicians and
  both are in a state of financial distress and raw nerves. It is not a time
  when deliberation and clear reasoning are easy. But when we get down to the
  fundamentals of the case we find that the antagonism comes out to these two
  propositions that are not necessarily arreconciliable:</p>

  <p>(I) That Germany, for the good of the whole world, must not be destroyed
  further, but, instead, assisted to keep upon her feet ("Relievers"), and</p>

  <p>(II) That Germany must nevermore become a danger to France {"Insisters").
  And these two propositions are completely reconciliable, and this particular
  clash can be entirely cured and ended by one thing and by one thing only, a
  binding alliance, watched and sustained by a standing commission of France,
  Germany, Britain, America, and possibly Italy and Spain, to guarantee France
  and Germany from further invasions and internal interference, if France
  follows the dictates of her better nature and the advice of her wiser
  citizens, foregoes her impossible claims and lets up on Germany from now
  on.</p>

  <p>And from no country can the initiative of such an alliance come more
  effectively them from the United States of America, the universal creditor,
  who can bring home to France, as no other power can, the beauty and
  desirability of financial mercifulness.</p>

  <p>I submit that these are the broad lines, the elements, the A B C of the
  present situation and that there is nothing whatever between France and
  Britain that is not entirely secondary and subordinate to this issue between
  Insistence and Relief.</p>

  <p>And moreover the issue between France in general and Britain in general is
  an issue that is going on in parallel forms all over the world. Old Japan
  insists upon the Versailles treaty; young Japan would relieve
  China,&mdash;how much is not yet clear. The American scene is a conflict
  between those who insist fiercely upon the British debt and those who would
  devise relieving conditions. It is nowhere a struggle between peoples and
  races, it is everywhere a struggle between logic and reason, between the
  stipulated thing, the traditional thing and the humane and helpful thing,
  between old ways of thinking and new, between the letter and the spirit. Old
  Shylock was the supreme in-sister, and since Portia was the triumphant
  reliever, we may reasonably look to the woman voter and the women's
  organizations of Britain and America for a particular impetus towards relief.
  And the sooner relief comes the better, for once Shylock's knife has cut down
  sufficiently to the living flesh, the cause of the reliever and of
  civilization will have been lost forever.</p>

     name="chap21">XXI. &mdash; A BEMINDER ABOUT WAR</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, December 5</h3>

  <p class="first">An examination of the situation. that has arisen in Europe
between France,
  England and Germany brings us out to exactly the same conclusion as an
  examination of the Pacific situation. There is no other alternative than
  this: Either to fight it out and establish the definite ascendancy of some
  one power or to form an alliance based on an explicit settlement, an
  alliance, indeed, sustaining a common executive commission to watch and
  maintain the observance of that settlement. There is no way out of war but an
  organized peace. Washington illuminates that point. We must be prepared to
  see an Association of Nations in conference growing into an organic system of
  world controls for world affairs and the keeping of the world's peace, or we
  must be prepared for&mdash;a continuation of war. So it is worth considering
  what that continuation of war will be like. If you will not organize pea^e
  through some such association, then organize for war, for certainly war will
  come again to you, or to your children.</p>

  <p>And for reasons set out in my earlier papers, reasons amply confirmed by
  the experiences of the Washington gathering, a mere limitation of armaments
  can be little more than a strategic truce., It may indeed even cut out
  expensive items and so cheapen and facilitate war.</p>

  <p>Let me note here in passing that the case for some Association of Nations
  to discuss and control the common interests of mankind rests on a wider basis
  than the mere prevention of war; the economic and social divisions and
  discords of mankind provide, perhaps, in the long run, a stronger and more
  conclusive argument for human unitv than the mere war evil, but in this paper
  I will narrow the issue down to war, simply, and ask the reader to consider
  the probable nature of war in the future if the development of warfare is not
  checked by deliberate human effort.</p>

  <p>And I will not deal with the ill-equipped cutthroat war that has been
  going on, and, thanks to the divisions and rivalries of France and Britain,
  is likely still to go on in Eastern Europe for some time to come; the wars of
  the little, self-determined nations that the Treaty of Versailles set loose
  upon each other; the raids of Poland into Ukrainia, and of Bou-mania into
  Hungary; and of Serbia into Albania; the old-fashioned game enlivened by rape
  and robbery that was brought to its highest perfection long ago in the Thirty
  Years' War. These are not so much wars as spasms of energy, phases of
  accelerated destruction, in the rotting body of East European
  civilization.</p>

  <p>But I mean the sort of war that will come if presently France attacks
  England, or if America and Japan start in for a good, long, mutually
  destructive struggle. You may say that war between France and England is
  unthinkable, but so far from that being the case, certain worthy souls in
  France have been thinking about it hard. Hard but not intelligently. They do
  not understand the moral impossibility of Britain fighting America, they have
  never heard of Canada, they have never examined the text of the
  Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and so they dream of a wonderful time when America
  will be fighting England and Japan, and when France, with magnificent
  gestures and with submarines and Senegalese at last gloriously justified,
  will " come to her aid." So France will divide and rule and clamber to dizzy
  destinies. Blushing and embarrassed American statesmen have already had to
  listen, I guess, to some insidious whispers. Even among our distresses there
  is something amusing in the thought of this hot breath of Old World diplomacy
  on the fresh American cheek. I do not say that these are the thoughts and
  acts of France, or of any great section of the French people, but they are
  certainly the thoughts and proceedings of a noisy Nationalist minority in
  France which is at present in a position of dangerous ascendancy there.</p>

  <p>Still, apart from the fact that the British will always refuse to fight
  America, there does seem to be no real reason why, in the absence of a
  developing peace alliance to prevent it, either of the other two matches I
  have cited should not be played. In the long run, you cannot avoid fighting
  if you avoid comprehensive alliances and standing arrangements for the
  settlement of differences with the people you may otherwise fight.</p>

  <p>So let us try and imagine a war between a pair of these four powers, five
  or ten years ahead. They have avoided any entangling alliances, or
  agreements, or settlements, kept their freedom of action and are
  thoroughly&mdash;<i>prepared</i>.</p>

  <p>Let us not fall into the trap of supposing that these wars will follow the
  lines of the Great War of 1914-18 and that we shall have a rapid line-up of
  great entrenched armies, with massed parks of artillery behind them, tank
  attacks and all the rest of it. That sort of war is already out of fashion,
  and the fact that these wars that we are considering will be overseas wars
  puts any possibility of such a dead-lock of land armies out of the case. The
  combatants will have to set about getting at each other in quite other
  fashions.</p>

  <p>Let us recall the maxim that the object of all fighting is to produce a
  state of mind in the adversary, a state of mind conducive to a discontinuance
  of the struggle and to submission and acquiescence to the will of the victor.
  Old-time wars aimed simply at the small antagonist army and at the antagonist
  Govenment, but in these democatic days the will for peace or war has
  descended among the people and diffused itself among them, and it is the
  state of mind of the whole enemy population that has become the objective in
  war. The old idea of an invading army marching on a capital, gives place,
  therefore, to a new conception of an attack through propaganda, through
  operations designed to produce acute economic distress, and through the air,
  upon the enemy population.</p>

  <p>I will take the latter branch first. Few people have any clear ideas at
  present of the possibilities of air warfare. The closing years of the Great
  War gave the world only a very slight experience of what aerial offensives
  can be. Always, air operations were subsidiary to the vast surface
  engagements of the European belligerents; they were scouting, irritating,
  raiding operations; there were neither the funds nor the energy available to
  work them out thoroughly. In these possible overseas wars we are considering,
  the land armies and the big guns will not be the main factors and the air and
  sea forces will. The powers we have considered will therefore push their air
  equipment on a quite different scale; they will be bound to deliver their
  chief blows with it; we may certainly reckon on the biggest long-range
  airplanes possible, on the largest bombs and the deadliest contents for them.
  We may certainly reckon that, within three or four hours of a declaration of
  war between France and England, huge bombs of high explosive, or poison gas,
  or incendiary stuff, will have got through the always ineffectual barrage and
  be livening up the streets of Paris and London. Because it is the peculiarity
  of air warfare that there are no fronts and no effectual perries. You bomb
  the other fellow almost anywhere, and similarly he bombs you.</p>

  <p>Many people seem to think that America and Japan are too far from each
  other for this sort of thing, but I believe there is nothing insurmountable
  in these distances for an air offensive. It will be a question of days
  instead of hours, that is all, before the babies of Tokio or San Francisco
  get their whiffs of the last thing in gas. The job will be a little more
  elaborate; it will involve getting the air material to a convenient distance
  from the desired objective by means of a submersible cruiser; that is all the
  difference.</p>

  <p>All the fleets in the world could not prevent a properly prepared Japan
  from pouncing upon some unprotected point of the California or Mexican coast,
  setting up a temporary air base there, and getting to work over a radius of a
  thousand miles. She might even keep an air base at sea. And it would be
  equally easy for America to do likewise to Japan. The citizen of Los Angeles,
  as he blew to pieces, or coughed up his lungs and choked to death or was
  crushed under the falling, burning buildings, could at least console himself
  by the thought that America was so thoroughly prepared that his fellow man in
  Tokio was certainly getting it worse, and that he blew to pieces on the
  soundest American lines unentangled by any alliances with decadent Old World
  powers. And an air war between America and Japan need not be confined to the
  Pacific Slope. I do not see anything to prevent Japan, if she wanted to do
  so, with the aid of a venial neutral or so, getting around into the Atlantic
  to New York and testing the stability of the great buildings downtown with a
  few five-ton bombs. The submarine would certainly be able to prevent any
  armies landing on either side of the Pacific to stop the preparation and
  launching of such expeditions.</p>

  <p>I do not know how American populations! would stand repeated bombing. In
  the late war there was not a single intrusion of air warfare into American
  home life. The hum of the Gotha and the long crescendo of the barrage as the
  thing gets near were not in the list of familiar American war sounds. Some of
  the European populations subjected to that kind of thing got very badly
  "rattled." And yet, as I have noted, the whole force of the combatants was
  not in the air operations in Europe. One result in nearly every country was
  an outbreak of spy mania; everybody with a foreign name or a foreign look in
  England, for example, was suspected of "signalling." There was much mental
  trouble; London possesses now a considerable number of air raid lunatics and
  air raid defective children, and these are only the extreme instances of a
  widespread overstrain. As the war went on, air stress interwoven with the
  acute stresses produced in public life by the development of propaganda.
  Public life in France, Germany and England got more and more crazy about
  propaganda; there was a fear of insidious whispering mischief afoot, more
  like the fear of witchcraft than anything else; until at last it became
  dangerous and ineffective to make any utterance at all except the most
  ferocious threats and accusations against the enemy. And a kind of paralysis
  of suspicion even affected the adoption of inventions. All this mental and
  moral confusion and deterioration is bound to happen in any highly organized
  community that goes into a well prepared war again. The only difference will
  be that it will all be larger, and intenser, and bitterer, and worse. And I
  will not even attempt to elaborate the consequences of the economic attack by
  submarines, upon shipping, and by raids of airplane fleets, assisted possibly
  by spies and traitors, upon the bridges, factories, depots, grain stores,
  ports and so forth, of the combatant countries.</p>

  <p>If such things are not practicable across the Pacific now they will be
  practicable in ten years' time.</p>

  <p>But my subject at Washington is peace, and not war. I think it was
  Nevinson's recent account of the new things in poison gas that set my
  imagination wandering into these possibilities of the Great Alternative to
  entangling treaties and difficult settlements. I will return to certain
  neglected problems of the Peace Conference in my next article.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap22"
     name="chap22">XXII. &mdash; SOME STIFLED VOICES</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, December 6</h3>

  <p class="first">I do not think my outline sketch of the Washington
Conference will be
  complete if I do not give an account of certain figures and groups in this
  simmering Washington gathering who have no official standing whatever and who
  are here in the unpopular role of qualifications and complications of the
  simpler conception of the Washington issues. They are not conspicuous
  absentees as are Germany and Russia. They come upon the scene but they come
  rather like that young woman with the baby who stands reproachfully at the
  church door watching the wedding in the melodramatic picture. They are full
  of reproaches&mdash;and intimations of troubles yet in store.</p>

  <p>The other evening, for example, I found myself dining with a comfortably
  housed Korean delegation and listening to the tale of a nation
  overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>Korea is as much of a nation as&mdash;Ireland. She had so recent an
  independence that she has treaties with the United States recognizing and
  promising to respect her independence. Yet she is now gripped, held down and
  treated as Posen was in the days of Prussian possession. She is being
  "assimilated" by Japan. "What is to be done about us?" my hosts asked.</p>

  <p>One fellow guest thought nothing could be done because the Korean vote in
  the United States is not strong enough to affect an election.</p>

  <p>Amid the tumult of voices here one hears ever and again an appeal for
  something to be done for Korea. Such appeals are addressed chiefly to
  American public opinion, but it is also felt to be worth while to let Britain
  know, at least to the extent of letting me in on this occasion. I was
  introduced to an editor of a Korean paper which had recently been suppressed,
  and I listened to an account, an amazing account, of the freedom of the press
  as it is understood in Korea under Japanese rule.</p>

  <p>Yet it sounded very familiar to me. Indeed, I had listened to much the
  same story of suppressions, rather worse suppressions, the night before. Then
  I had been the host of two friends of mine, Mr. Houssain and Mr. Sapre, who
  have had extensive experiences of suppression in India. They are both here in
  much the same spirit as the Koreans.</p>

  <p>Whenever I talk to Mr. Houssain we alwavs get to a sort of polite quarrel
  in which he treats me more and more like the Indian Government in its
  defense, and I become more and more like the British ascendancy. I adopt,
  almost inadvertently, as much as is adoptable of the manner and tone of the
  late Lord Cromer and say: "Yes, yes. But are you ripe for self -government?"
  These gentlemen say frankly that the British rule in India has displayed so
  much stupidity in such cases as the Amritsar massacre, and the recent
  suffocation of the Moplah prisoners, and that its complete suppression of any
  frank public discussion of Indian affairs in India is so intolerable, that it
  is becoming unendurable.</p>

  <p>Everybody is talking of insurrection in India now; nobody talked of it
  three years ago. These have been three years of stupid "firmness." Now that
  that dinner party is past and gone, I can confess that I think Mr. Houssain's
  argument that under British rule India has no chance of getting politically
  educated, because she is prevented from airing her ideas, and that if her
  discontent is incoherent and disorderly it is because of the complete
  suppression, completer now than ever before, of discussion, is a very strong
  argument indeed.</p>

  <p>India and Britain cannot talk together about their common future if India
  remains gagged and without ever a chance of learning to talk. If a break
  comes in India it is likely to be a bad and hopeless one, because of her lack
  of worked-out political conceptions, due to her long mental restraint, while
  all the rest of the world from Korea to Peru has been trying over political
  self-expression.</p>

  <p>But it is interesting and perhaps not quite so pathetically hopeless as it
  seems at the first glance to find these two men in this city, side by side
  with the Koreans, trying to get "something done about it " at the Washington
  assembly. And a day or so ago I had a call from another unofficial delegate,
  a Syrian Moslem who wanted to talk over the education of his people, also
  fretting beneath the wide surfaces of the Treaty of Versailles, with the
  ambition to manage the affairs of Syria for themselves.</p>

  <p>And as another case of the stifled voice here are the representatives of
  the Cantonese Chinese Government, who made a scene the other day when the
  Peking representatives went into secret session with the Japanese. There was
  an assembly of hostile Chinese shouting "Traitor!" and
  things&mdash;apparently very disagreeable things&mdash;in Chinese. Here again
  there is a clamor for attention that gets short drift from the official
  conference.</p>

  <p>And, lest these stifled outcries should fill the American reader with
  self-righteousness, I will note in passing that the entrance to the second
  plenary conference was besieged by an array of banners reminding us that that
  evidently most gentle and worthy man, Mr. Debs, is still in prison for saying
  his honest thought about conscription, and also that I have received, I
  suppose, over twenty letters about an unfortunate young Englishman, a minor
  poet named Mr. Charles Ashleigh, who seems to have come into America looking
  like a person of advanced views, to have done some publicity work for the
  I.W.W., and to have been caught in a gale of indiscriminate suppression and
  given a sentence of ten years for nothing at all. The offense of Mr. Debs and
  the alleged offense of Mr. Ashleigh, I may note further, were a premature
  craving for universal peace which might have weakened the will for war.</p>

  <p>All these suppressions of opinion strike me as black sins against
  civilization, which can only maintain itself and grow and flourish through
  the free expression and discussion of ideas. The temptation to ride off from
  the main business of the conference upon some Quixotic championship of Korea
  or India or Mr. Ashleigh is therefore very considerable. But when we consider
  that all these particular injustices are incidents in that general disorder
  which permits the aggression of nation upon nation and which blinds justice
  with cruel passion and urgent necessities of war, these cases appear in a
  different light.</p>

  <p>Korea and the suppressed and imprisoned Indian Liberals and Mr. Ashleigh
  are like people hit casually in a great combat, and the immediate work of the
  ordinary combatant is surely not to specialize upon these special cases but
  to go on with the general fight for world peace which will render the
  atmosphere that created these particular wrongs impossible. Japan is
  attempting to crush and assimilate Korea because Japan wants to be bigger and
  stronger, and she wants to be bigger and stronger because of the fear of war
  and humiliation. Britain holds down India and is reluctant to loose her hold
  on Ireland for the same cause; if she relax, some one else may seize and use.
  America also crushes out the anti-con-scriptionist because otherwise he may
  embarrass the conduct of the next war.</p>

  <p>In the present conference the liberal forces of the world may be able to
  establish a precedent that will at once reflect upon the position of both
  Korea and India, and to open stich a prospect of peace as will make the
  release of Messrs. Debs and Ashleigh inevitable. But that can only be if we
  stick to the main business of the conference and do not fuss thing3 up at
  present with too much focusing upon Korea or India or the case of Mr.
  Debs.</p>

  <p>The precedent that may be established through the conference is the
  liberation of China, when China is militarily impotent and politically
  disordered, not only from fresh foreign aggression but from existing foreign
  domination. The establishment of such a precedent is a thing of supreme
  importance to all men. If the conference does not get so far as that&mdash;so
  far as to establish the principle that an Asiatic people has a right to
  control its own destinies and to protection while it adjusts these destinies,
  in spite of the fact that it cannot as an efficient power defend that
  right&mdash;it will have made a very wide step indeed not only toward world
  peace but toward a general liberation of Asiatic peoples held in
  tutelage.</p>

  <p>It is so important to mankind that that step should be made that I grudge
  any diversion of energy to minor injustices, however glaring, or any
  complication of the issue whatever. So far as the conference goes, I am
  convinced that "Stick to the freedom of China" is the watchword for all
  liberal thinkers. By the extent to which China is liberated and secured the
  conference will have to be judged. Even the vast problem of India cannot
  overshadow that issue.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap23"
     name="chap23">XXIII. &mdash; INDIA, THE BRITISH EMPIRE<br>
  AND THE ASSOCIATION OF NATIONS</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, December 7</h3>

  <p class="first">It is difficult to think of any subject more completely out
of the agenda
  of the Washington Conference than the future of India. But none demands our
  attention more urgently, if we are to build up anything like a working
  conception of an Association of Nations.</p>

  <p>Some days ago Senator Johnson declared he had received assurances from
  President Harding that no further steps toward a definite organization of an
  Association of Nations were to be taken for the present; but these assurances
  will not hinder the drift of thoughts and events toward such a developing
  system of understandings as must at last, in fact if not in name, constitute
  a World Association. Indeed, the less we try to fix such a thing at present,
  and the more we think it out, the more probable and safe is its coming.</p>

  <p>Let the President go on, therefore, taking no steps directly toward his
  Association btit proceeding, as he must do very soon, with some sort of
  international conference upon the economic disorders of the world, and also
  with the creation of some arrangement, permanent understanding or whatever
  other name may be given to that commission which is inevitable if the peace
  of the Pacific is to be made secure. Let us who are dealers in the flimsier
  preparatory stuff of ideas and public opinion get on with our discussion of
  the wider stabilizing understanding that looms behind.</p>

  <p>I have already said that from every country world peace and universal
  prosperity will demand a price. The price America will need to pay if she is
  to impose her conception of a universal peace upon the world is a great
  intellectual effort&mdash;an effort of sympathy, an abandonment of some
  venerated traditions. And in addition she must nerve herself to what may seem
  at first very great financial generosities.</p>

  <p>France must pay by laying aside an ancient and cherished quarrel, her
  glorious and tragic militarism and the last vestige of her imperial ambition.
  The thought of predominance and the thought of revenge must be the German
  sacrifice. And Britain also must pay in an altered attitude to those wide
  "possessions" of hers inhabited by alien peoples that have hitherto
  constituted the bulk of her empire.</p>

  <p>The destiny of all the English speaking democracies that have risen now
  from being British colonies to semi-independent states seems fairly clear.
  They will go on to nationhood; their links to Great Britain, continually less
  formal and legal and more and more strongly sympathetic, will be supplemented
  by their attraction toward America, due to affinity and a common character.
  All the mischief makers in the world cannot, I think, prevent the
  Dutch-English of South Africa, the English-French of Canada, the
  English-French of Australia, the English-Scotch of New Zealand, the
  Americans, this new emancipated Ireland and Britain, being drawn together at
  last by all their common habits of thought and speech, and even by the
  mellowed memories of their past conflicts, into a conscious brotherhood of
  independent but cooperative nations.</p>

  <p>The day has come for the Irish to recognize that the future is of more
  value than the past. Even without any other states, this girdle of English
  speaking states about the globe could be of a great predominant association.
  Within this English speaking circle of peoples a whole series of experiments
  in separation, independent action, readjustment, co-operation and federation
  have been made in the last century and a half, and are still going on, of the
  utmost significance in the problem of human association.</p>

  <p>No other series of communities have had such experiences. No other
  communities have so much to give mankind in these matters. The German
  coalescences have been marred by old methods of force, methods which have
  usually failed in the English cases. Spain and Latin America are at least
  half a century behind the English speaking world in the arts and experience
  of political co-operation.</p>

  <p>But when we turn to India we tnrn to something absolutely outside the
  English speaking world girdle.</p>

  <p>One of the many manifest faults of thati most premature project the League
  of Nations was the fiction that brought in India as a self-governing nation,
  as if she were the same sort of thing as these self-governing Western states.
  It was indeed a most amazing assumption. India is not a nation, or anything
  like a nation. India is a confused variety of states, languages and races,
  and so far from being self-governing, her peoples are under an amount of
  political repression which is now perhaps greater there than anywhere else in
  the world.</p>

  <p>Politically she is a profound mystery. We do not know what the political
  thoughts of these peoples are, nor indeed whether they have in the mass any
  political concepts at all parallel to those of the Western civilizations. The
  Indian representative at the Washington Conference, Mr. Srinivastra Sastri,
  is obviously a British nominee; he is not so much a representative as a
  specimen Indian gentleman. We do not know what national forces there are
  behind him, or indeed if there is any collective will behind him at all. But
  it would be hard to substitute for him anything very much more
  representative.</p>

  <p>What constituency is there, what Electoral College, to send any one? India
  is not in fact so constituted as to send a real representative to a
  conference or an Association of Nations at the present time. She is a thing
  of a different kind, a different sort of human accumulation* She belongs to a
  different order of creature from the English speaking and European states and
  from Japan. She is as little fitted to deal on equal terms with them as a
  jungle deer, let us say, is to join a conference of the larger Cetacea in the
  North Polar seas.</p>

  <p>India is far less able to play an effective and genuine part as a member
  of an Association of Nations even than China. She has no real democratic
  institutions and she may never develop them in forms familiar to European and
  American minds. We American and English are too apt to suppose that our own
  democratic methods, our voting and elections and debates and press campaigns
  and parliamentary methods, which have grown up through long ages to suit our
  peculiar idiosyncrasies, are necessarily adaptable to all the world. In India
  they may prove altogether misfitting.</p>

  <p>India, were she given freedom of self-government, under the stimulus of
  modern appliances and modern thought, would probably induce an entirely
  different series of institutions from those of Europe, institutions perhaps
  equally conducive to freedom and development but different in kind. And China
  also, with untrammelled initiatives, may invent methods of freedom and
  co-operation at once dissimilar and parallel to Western institutions.</p>

  <p>But the mention of China brings us back to the possibility of applying the
  precedent of China to India. The discussions and perplexities of the last two
  or three years which have culminated in the Washington Conference have slowly
  worked out and made clear the possibility of a new method in Asia. This is
  the method of concerted abstinence and withdrawal, the idea of a binding
  agreement of all the nations interested in China and tempted to make
  aggressions upon China to come out of and to keep out of that country while
  it consolidated itself and develops upon its own lines.</p>

  <p>This new method, which has had its first trial at the Washington
  Conference, is a complete reversal of the method of dealing with politically
  confused or impotent countries and regions adopted at Versailles. It is an
  altogether more civilized and more hopeful method.</p>

  <p>Versailles and the League of Nations were ridden by the idea of mandates.
  All over the world where disorder or weakness reigned a single mandatory
  power was to go in, making vague promises of good behavior, to rule and
  exploit that country. It was the thinnest, cheapest camouflage for
  annexation; it was a hopeless attempt to continue the worst territory-seizing
  traditions of the nineteenth century while seeming to abandon them. It was
  Pecksniff imperialism. So we had the snatching of Syria, of Mesopotamia, and
  so forth.</p>

  <p>But any soundly constituted League or Association of Nations should render
  that sort of thing unnecessary and inexcusable.</p>

  <p>The reason lying at the base of the British occupation of India, of the
  Japanese occupation of Korea, of the French in Indo-China, and so forth, is a
  perfectly sound reason so long as there is no Association of Nations, and it
  is an entirely worthless one when there is such an association&mdash;it is
  that some other power may otherwise come into the occupied and dominated
  country and use it for purposes of offense. The case of the British in India,
  that they have kept an imperial peace for all the peoples of that land, that
  they warded off the Afghan raiders who devastated India in the early
  eighteenth century and afterward the long arm of Russia, is a very good one
  indeed. The British have little cause to be ashamed of their past in India
  and many things to be proud of. But they have very good cause, indeed, for
  being ashamed of their disregard of any Indian future. They have sat tight
  and turned peace into paralysis. They have not educated enough or released
  enough. Always the excuse for suppression has been that fear of the
  rival.</p>

  <p>Well, the whole purpose of an Association of Nations is to eliminate that
  fear of a rival and all that that fear entails in war possibilities.</p>

  <p>The Asiatic "empires" over alien peoples, these "possessions" of other
  people's lands and lives, have played their part in the world's development.
  They have become tyrannies and exasperations and tawdry grounds for rivalry.
  A real Association of Nations can have no place for "possessions," "mandates"
  or "subject peoples" within its scheme.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap24"
     name="chap24">XXIV. &mdash; THE OTHER END OF PENNSYLVANIA<br>
  AVENUE&mdash;THE SIEVE FOR GOOD INTENTIONS</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, December 9</h3>

  <p class="first">I went to hear the President address Congress on its
reassembling on
  Tuesday. He spoke to a joint session of the Senate and House of
  Representatives held, as is customary, in the chamber of Representatives
  because it is the larger of the two chambers.</p>

  <p>Hitherto my observations have centred upon the Continental Building and
  the Pan-American Building, up by the White House, and they have concerned the
  good intentions and great projects that glow and expand like great iridescent
  bubbles about the conference that is going on in this region.</p>

  <p>But the conference, whatever freedom it has to think and discuss, has no
  power to act. Until the Senate by a two-thirds majority has indorsed the
  recommendations of the President, the United States cannot be committed to
  any engagement with the outside world. This Is a fact that needs to be
  written in large letters as a perpetual reminder in the editorial rooms and
  diplomatic offices of all those Europeans who write about or deal with the
  foreign relations of the United States. For the Constitution of the United
  States is as carelessly read over there as the Anglo-Japanese alliance has
  been read here, and it is as dangerously misconceived. Through that first
  disastrous year of the peace Europe imagined that the President was the owner
  rather than the leader of the United States.</p>

  <p>It was with great interest and curiosity, therefore, that I went down to
  this assembly at the Capitol to see the President dealing with his
  Legislature. Here was the place not of suggestions but of decisions. What
  goes through here is accomplished and done&mdash;subject only to one thing,
  the recognition by the Supreme Court, if it is challenged, that the thing is
  constitutional.</p>

  <p>I went down with&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;some prejudiced
  expectations. The Americans resemble the English very closely in one
  particular&mdash;they abuse their own institutions continually. Prohibition
  and the police&mdash;but these are outside my scope! I have heard scarcely a
  good word for Congress since I landed here, and the Senate, by the unanimous
  testimony of the conversationalists of the United States, combines the
  ignoble with the diabolical in a peculiarly revolting mixture. Even
  individual Senators have admitted as much&mdash;with a sinister pride.</p>

  <p>It is exactly how we talk about Parliament in London&mdash;though with
  more justice. But this sort of talk soaks into the innocent from abroad, and,
  though one takes none of it seriously, the whole of it produces an effect. I
  had the feeling that I was going to see a gathering of wreckers, a barrier,
  perhaps an insurmountable barrier, in the way to the realization of any dream
  of America taking her place as the leading power in the world, as the first
  embodiment of the New Thing in international affairs.</p>

  <p>It puts all this sort of feeling right to see these two bodies in their
  proper home and to talk to these creatures of legend, the Bepresen-tatives
  and the Senators. One perceives they are not a malignant sub-species of
  mankind; one discovers a concourse of men very interested about and
  unexpectedly open-minded upon foreign policy. They are critical but not
  hostile to the new projects and ideas. One realizes that Congress is not a
  blank barrier but a sieve, and probably a very necessary sieve, for the new
  international impulse in America.</p>

  <p>The ceremonial of the gathering was simple and with the dignity of
  simplicity. The big galleries for visitors, which always impress the British
  observer by their size, were full of visitors after their kind, ladies
  predominating, and particularly full was the press gallery, which overhangs
  the Speaker and the Presidential chair. Some faint vestige of a sound
  religious upbringing had reminded me that the first are sometimes last and
  the last first; I had fallen into the tail of the procession of my fellow
  newspaper men from their special room to the House of Representatives, and so
  I found myself with the overflow of the journalists, not with everything
  under my chin but very conveniently seated on the floor of the House behind
  the Representatives, and feeling much more like a Congressman than I could
  otherwise have done.</p>

  <p>Away to the right were the members of the Cabinet&mdash;the British
  visitor always has to remind himself that they cannot be either
  Representatives or Senators. Presently the ninety-odd Senators came in by the
  central door, two by two, and were distributed upon the seats in front of
  their hosts, the Representatives.</p>

  <p>There was applause, and I saw Sir Auckland Geddes, with that large, bare
  smile of his, and the rest of the British delegation entering from behind the
  Chair, for the delegations had also been invited to come down from the
  unrealities of the conference and had been assigned the front row of seats.
  Other delegations followed and seated themselves. At last came a hush and the
  clapping of hands, and the President entered and went to his place, looking
  extremely like a headmaster coming in to address the school assembly at the
  beginning of the term. He is more like George Washington in appearance, I
  perceive, than any intervening President.</p>

  <p>He read his address in that effective voice of his which seems to get
  everywhere without an effort. I listened attentively to every sentence of it,
  although I knew that upstairs there would be a printed copy of it for me as
  soon as the delivery was over. Yet, although I was listening closely, I also
  found I was thinking a great deal about this most potent gathering, for
  potent it is, which has been raised up now to a position of quite cardinal
  importance in human affairs.</p>

  <p>President Harding is on what are nowadays for a President exceptionally
  good terms with Congress. He means to keep so. In his address he reiterated
  his point that even the full constitutional powers of the President are too
  great and that he has no intention to use them, much less to strain them.
  Nevertheless, or even in consequence of that, he is very manifestly the
  leader of his Legislature. The atmosphere was non-contentious. He was not
  like a party leader speaking to his supporters and the opposition. He was
  much more like America soliloquizing. His address was a statement of
  intentions.</p>

  <p>I think the President feels that officially he is not so much the elect of
  America as the voice of America, and instead of wanting to make that voice
  say characteristic and epoch-making things, he tries to get as close as he
  can to the national thought and will. What President Harding says today
  America will do tomorrow. One human and amusing thing he did&mdash;he was
  careful to drag in that much-disputed word of his, "normalcy," which he has
  resolved, apparently, shall oust out "normality" from current English.</p>

  <p>And from the point of view of those who are concerned about the dark
  troubles of the world outside America it was, I think, a very hopeful
  address. It reinforced the impression I had already received of President
  Harding as of a man feeling his way carefully but steadily towards great
  ends. America's growing recognition of her "inescapable relationship to world
  finance and trade" came early and his little lecture on the need to give and
  take in foreign trade was a lecture that is being repeated in every main
  street in America.</p>

  <p>He spoke of Russia and returned to that topic. "We do not forget the
  tradition of Russian friendship" was a good sentence that some countries in
  Europe may well mark. The growing belief in America of the possibility of
  going into Russia through the agency of the American Relief Administration
  and of getting to dealing with the revived co-operative organizations of
  Russia is very notable. And though there was no mention of the Association of
  Nations as such, there were allusions to the "world hope centered upon this
  capital city" and to the universal desire for permanent peace.</p>

  <p>And while I listened I was also thinking of all these men immediately
  before me, between four and five hundred men, including the ninety-six
  Senators, with whom rested the power of decision upon the role America will
  play in the world. I have met and talked now with a number of them, and
  particularly with quite a fair sample of the Senatorial body. And I think now
  that it is going to be a much better body for international purposes than my
  reading about it before I came to Washington has led me to suppose.</p>

  <p>We hear too much in Europe of the rule of "jobs" and "interests" in
  Washington. No doubt that sort of thing goes on here, as in every
  Legislature, but it has to be borne in mind that it has very little bearing
  upon the international situation. It is not a matter affecting the world
  generally. I doubt if there is t nearly as much business and financial
  intrigue in the lobbies of Washington as in the lobbies of Westminster; but,
  anyhow, what there is here is essentially a domestic question. Both
  Eepresentatives and Senators approach international questions as
  comparatively free&mdash;if rather inexperienced&mdash;men.</p>

  <p>Probably the only strong permanent force hitherto in international affairs
  here has been the anti-British vote, based on the Irish hate of Britain. If
  the Irish settlement weakens or abolishes that, Congress will deal with the
  world's affairs without any perceptible bias at all. The average Senator is a
  prosperous, intelligent, American-thinking man, elected to the Senate upon
  political grounds that have no bearing whatever upon international affairs.
  He is an amateur in matters international.</p>

  <p>A bitter political issue at home may make him do any old thing with
  international affairs, and that was the situation during the last years of
  President Wilson. Poor, war-battered Europe became a pawn in a constitutional
  struggle. But the Harding regime is to be one of co-operation with the
  Senate, and the dignity of the Senate is restored. This very various assembly
  of vigorous-minded Americans, for that and other reasons, is getting to grips
  now with international questions with all the freshness and vigor of good
  amateurs, with a detached disinterestedness, a growing sense of
  responsibility and the old peace-enforcing traditions of America strong in
  it.</p>

  <p>If only it does not delay things too long; I doubt if those who desire to
  see the peace of the world organized and secure are likely to have any
  quarrel with the Senate of the United States. The worst evil I fear from the
  American Senate, now that I have seen something of it individually and
  collectively, is the impartial leisureliness of the detached in its dealings
  with international affairs.</p>

  <p>The President finished his discourse and the stir of dispersal began. I
  had assisted at America reviewing her position in the world. I thought the
  occasion simple and fine and dignified. I found myself leaving the Capitol in
  a mood of quite unanticipated respect.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap25"
     name="chap25">XXV.&mdash;  AFRICA AND THE ASSOCIATION OF NATIONS</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, December 9</h3>

  <p class="first">IN a previous paper I wrote of certain "stifled voices" at
Washington.
  There is yet another stifled voice here that I have heard, and to speak of it
  opens up another great group of questions that stand in the way to any
  effectual organization of world peace through an Association of Nations.
  Until we get some provisional decision about this set of issues the
  Association of Nations remains a project in the air.</p>

  <p>This stifled voice of which I am now writing is the voice of the colored
  people. As a novelist&mdash;a novelist in my spare time&mdash;and as a man
  very curious by nature, about human reactions, the peculiar situations
  created by "color" in America have always appealed to me. I do not understand
  why American fiction does not treat of them more frequently. It is the
  educated, highly intelligent colored people who get my interest and sympathy.
  I cannot get up any race feeling about them.</p>

  <p>I am particularly proud to have known Booker T. Washington and to know Mr.
  Dubois, and this time, in spite of a great pressure of engagements, I was
  able to spend two hours last Sunday 1 listening to the proceedings of the
  Washington Correspondence Club, an organization which battles by letter and
  interview and appeal against the harsh exclusions from theatres, schools,
  meetings, restaurants, libraries and the like, that prevail here.</p>

  <p>I will not discuss here the rights and wrongs of a bar that cuts off most
  of the intellectual necessities and conveniences of life from many people who
  would pass as refined and cultivated whites in any European country. I
  mention this gathering merely to note a very interesting topic upon which I
  was called to account thereat.</p>

  <p>Once or twice in these papers&mdash;I do not know if the reader has noted
  it&mdash;I have mentioned the French training of Senegalese troops and the
  objection felt by other European peoples to their extensive employment in
  Europe. I was asked at the Correspondence Club whether the objections I had
  made to this were not "fostering race prejudice," and some interesting
  exchanges followed.</p>

  <p>I was inclined to argue that the importation of African negroes into
  Europe for military purposes was as objectionable as their importation to
  America for economic services, but some of my hosts, some of the younger men,
  did not see it in that light. They are warmed toward the French by the
  notable absence of racial ex-clusiveness in France, and they see the ideals
  of that epoch-making book, "La France Negre," from an entirely different
  angle. Why not a black France as big or bigger than white France and a new
  people who have learned military discipline, military service and united
  action from Europe?</p>

  <p>"Why not an African Napoleon presently?" said the young man, a little
  wanting, I thought, in that abject meekness which is the American ideal of
  colored behavior.</p>

  <p>He was imagining, I suppose, something happening in Africa rather after
  the fashion of the emancipation of Haiti and of great African armies pushing
  their former rulers back to the sea. But Col. Taylor has recently suggested
  another possibility, namely, that of France finding herself in the grip of a
  black Pretorian Guard. It is a just, conceivable fancy&mdash;a Pretorian
  Guard, French-speaking and ultra-patriotic, keeping French Socialists and
  pacifists and Bolsheviks in their proper place.</p>

  <p>I do not believe veiy much in either of these possibilities nor even in
  the third possibility of European powers fighting each other with black
  armies in Africa, but I do perceive that dreams of a world peace will remain
  very insubstantial dreams, indeed, until we can work out a scheme or at least
  general principles of action for the treatment of Africa between the Sahara
  and the Zambesi River, a scheme that will give some sort of a quietus to the
  jealousies and hostilities evoked by the economic and political exploitations
  of annexed and mandatory territories upon nationalist and competitive lines
  in this region of the earth.</p>

  <p>For it seems to be the fact that tropical and sub-tropical Africa has
  another function in the world than to be the home of the great family of
  negro peoples. Africa is economically necessary to European civilization as
  the chief source of vegetable oils and fats and various other products of no
  great value to the native population. European civilization can scarcely get
  along without these natural resources of Africa.</p>

  <p>Now here we are up against a problem entirely different from the problem
  that arises in the case of India, Indo-China and China, which is the problem
  of a politically powerless but essentially civilized population which can be
  trusted to modernize itself and come into line with the existing efficient
  powers if only it is protected from, oppressive and disintegrating forces
  while it adjusts itself.</p>

  <p>Africa is quite incapable of anything of the sort. Negro Africa is mainly
  still in a state of tribal barbarism; in the latter half of the nineteenth
  century its peoples were in a condition of deepening disorder and misery due
  to the spread of European diseases and to the raiding of the Arab and native
  adventurers who had obtained possession of modern firearms. The small village
  communities of tropical Africa were quite unable to stand up against the
  brigand enterprises of mere bands of ruffians armed with rifles.</p>

  <p>The scramble for Africa on the part of the European great powers toward
  the close of the nineteenth century&mdash;a scramble largely dictated by
  economic appetites&mdash;did a little to mitigate the miseries and
  destruction in progress by establishing a sort of order through large areas
  of Africa, a sort of order that in some regions was scarcely less cruel than
  the disorders it replaced. But if continuing access to the resources of
  Africa is to be maintained, and if a return to the Arab raider and general
  chaos and massacres is to be avoided, it is clear that in some form the
  control of the central parts of Africa by the modern civilized world must
  continue.</p>

  <p>But we must be clear upon one point. If that control is to be maintained,
  as at present it is maintained by various European powers acting
  independently of one another and competing against one another, in the not
  very remote future Central Africa is bound to become a cause of war. Central
  Africa was one of the great prizes before the German imagination in 1914, and
  it is now held in a state of unstable equilibrium by the chief European
  victors in the Great War.</p>

  <p>As they recuperate the African danger will increase. Africa, next after
  Eastern Europe and the Near East, is likely to become in the course of a
  dozen years or so the chief danger region of the world.</p>

  <p>It behooves all those who are dreaming of an organized world peace through
  an Association of Nations to keep this African rock ahead in mind and to
  think out the possible method of linking this great region with the rest of
  the world in a universal peace scheme.</p>

  <p>I submit that it is not premature for those who are concerned with the
  future of our race to consider the necessity of three chief things:</p>

  <p>(1) The complete abandonment and prohibition now of the enlistment and
  military use of the African native population.</p>

  <p>(2) The application of the principle of the "open door" and equal trading
  opportunities for all comers in the regions between the Sahara and the
  Zambesi.</p>

  <p>(3) A more organized care of the native African population by a tightening
  up of the existing restrictions upon the arms and drink trades and the
  development of some sort of elementary education throughout Africa that will
  give these very various and largely still untried peoples a chance of showing
  what latent abilities they have for self-government and participation in the
  general human common weal.</p>

  <p>For my own part, it seems to me that any real "League of Nations," any
  effective "Association of Nations," must necessarily supersede the existing
  "empires" and imperial systems and take over their alien "possessions"</p>

  <p>and that one commission embodying the collective will of all the efficient
  civilized nations of the world is the only practicable form of security for
  all those parts of Africa incapable or not yet capable of
  self-government.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap26"
     name="chap26">XXVI. &mdash; THE FOURTH PLENARY SESSION</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, December 12</h3>

  <p class="first">The reader will have seen verbatim reports of the speeches
at the fourth
  plenary session of the Washington Conference and he will know already what
  decisions were handed out to us from the more or less secret session that
  prepared them for us.</p>

  <p>There has been a good deal of discussion here about the secret sessions
  and a certain indignation at their secrecy that I do not share. It is a
  matter of decency rather than concealment that men speaking various
  languages, representing complicated interests and feeling their way toward
  understandings, should not be exposed to embarrassing observation and comment
  until they have properly hammered out what they have to say. It is far better
  to digest conclusions under cover and to present the agreed-upon conclusion.
  This is no offense against democracy, no conspiracy against publicity. The
  mischief of secrecy lies in secret treaties and secret understandings and not
  in protected interchanges. There is no sound objection to secret bargaining
  in committee provided that finally the public is informed of the agreement
  arrived at and <i>of all the considerations in the bargain</i>.</p>

  <p>The conclusions announced are important enough in themselves; but to all
  who care for the peace of the world they are far more important in the vista
  of possibilities they open up. Certain notable precedents are established.
  The four Root resolutions do put very clearly those ideals of withdrawal and
  abstinence which must become the universal rule of conduct between efficient
  and politically confused or enfeebled states if the peace of the world is to
  be preserved. That is the new way in international politics. <i>It is the
  beginning of the end of all Asiatic imperialisms</i>.</p>

  <p>And, following upon its assent to those resolutions, the conference voted
  upon certain special applications of them. The abolitions of the extra
  territorial grievance, the right of China as a neutral power to escape the
  fate of Belgium and the right of China to be informed on the article of any
  treaty affecting her were established as far as a resolution of the
  conference could establish them.</p>

  <p>And then came Senator Lodge. For the fourth plenary session "featured"
  Senator Lodge just as previous ones had "featured" Secretary Hughes, Mr.
  Balfour and M. Briand. Fifteen years ago I came to Washington and Senator
  Lodge showed me a collection of prehistoric objects from Central America and
  talked very delightfully about them. Fifteen years have changed Washington
  very greatly but they have not changed Senator Lodge.</p>

  <p>He seems perhaps just a little slenderer and neater than before, but that
  may be a change in my own standards, and it was entirely in character with my
  former impressions of him that in putting the four-power treaty before the
  conference he should indulge himself and his hearers in a vision of the
  realities of the Pacific, the multitudinous interests of its innumerable
  islands, its infinite variety of races, customs, climates and
  atmospheres.</p>

  <p>It was a most curious and attractive phase of the always-interesting
  conference to have this gray-headed, cultivated gentleman breaking through
  all the abstract jargon of diplomacy and militarism, all the talk of powers,
  radii of action, fortifications, spheres of influence, and so forth, in his
  attempt to make us realize the physical loveliness and intellectual charm of
  this enormous area of the world's surface that the four-power treaty may
  perhaps save now and forevermore from the fear and horrors of war.</p>

  <p>The proposed four-power treaty which thus starts upon its uncertain but
  hopeful journey toward ratification by the Senates, Legislatures and
  Governments of the world is essentially a departure from the normal tradition
  of the treaties of the nineteenth century. It is the first attempt to
  realize&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;the American way or the new way in
  international affairs. Its distinctive feature is the participation of two
  possible antagonists, America and Japan. Instead of a war they make a treaty
  and call in Britain and France to assist. It is a treaty for peace and not
  against an antagonist.</p>

  <p>I think that the difference between "treaties for" and "treaties against"
  is one that needs to be stressed. The Anglo-Japanese treaty was a "treaty
  against," a treaty against first Russia, then Germany and then against some
  vaguely conceived assailant. It is a great thing to have Japan and England
  cordially immolating that treaty now that this four-power treaty of the new
  spirit may be born.</p>

  <p>After Senator Lodge came M. Viviani with a very fine, if guarded, speech.
  M. Viviani is a great speaker but he is not merely eloquent, and I find
  people here saying little about his wonderful voice or his overtones and
  undertones or his romantic charm but much about the subtle things he said. In
  a gathering that is tense with attention one is apt, perhaps, to transfer
  one's own thoughts and expectations to the gathering as a whole, but it seems
  to me that when M. Viviani rose to welcome this great beginning on the
  Pacific, we were all thinking: "And how much further and to what other
  regions of the world are yon prepared to extend this spirit and method of
  this Pacific bond! There is another rather threadbare 'treaty against' or at
  least an 'understanding against,' known as the Anglo-French entente. Is the
  time due yet for the merger of that also in another and greater bond of
  peace?"</p>

  <p>I do not know how far the question that was in his mind was in the mind of
  the meeting, but I think that M. Viviani made it very plain that it was in
  the background of his own mind. His speech was designed to bring the
  simplicity, the easiness of the Pacific problem into sharp contrast with the
  tortured complexity of the Atlantic&mdash;the Afro-European problem. He spoke
  of the freedom of the Pacific from long established hate traditions. He
  reminded us of the twenty centuries of war and trampled frontiers and
  outrages and counter-outrages that had left Europe and North Africa scarred
  and festering.</p>

  <p>He conjured up no bogies; he had nothing to say about those 7,000,000
  phantom Germans ready to extract their hidden rifles from 7,000,-000
  mattresses and haylofts and rush upon France; but he reminded the conference,
  gravely and wisely, of the relative complexity of the European problem, of
  the new untried nationalities that had been liberated, of the vast heritage
  of tradition and suspicion that had to be overcome. He addressed not only the
  conference but the impatient liberal aspirations of the world. "I ask yon for
  forbearance," he said, and repeated that&mdash;"I ask for forbearance."</p>

  <p>Now that was a great speech, and M. Viviani is manifestly the sort of
  Frenchman with whom the new spirit can deal. "Forbearance" might well serve
  now as the watchword of Europe. And I wish that Mr. Balfour could have shown
  a fuller recognition of what M. Viviani had said. Mr. Balfour had been so
  fine on several occasions at this conference that I felt it is a little
  ungracious to him to confess, as I must do, that twice in this day of the
  fourth plenary session, once in the conference and also in the evening when
  he replied for the Allies at the Gridiron Club, he seemed to be missing an
  opportunity&mdash;the opportunity of holding out a hand of friendship to
  liberal France.</p>

  <p>For the reactionary France, for the France of submarines and Senegalese
  and inflated army and navy estimates, neither Britain nor America nor any
  other part of the world has any use, and the more often we say that and the
  more distinctly we say it the better for every one; but toward a France that
  can teach and practice forbearance and come into great associations for the
  common welfare of mankind we ought to hold out both hands. Most of the
  bitterness that has been directed towards France of late is not the
  bitterness of any natural hatred; it is the bitterness of acute
  disappointment that France, the generous leader of freedom upon both the
  American and European Continents, no longer leads, seems to care no longer
  for either freedom or generosity. And twice I have seen opportunities lost
  for an appropriate gesture of reconciliation.</p>

  <p>Sooner or later France and England have to say to each other: "We have
  been sore and sick and exasperated and suspicious and narrow. Let us take a
  lesson from this American plan and set about discussing an Atlantic treaty,
  an Afro-European treaty, worthy to put beside this Pacific treaty."</p>

  <p>And since this has to be said, it was a pity that Mr. Balfour could not
  take up M. Viviani's half lead and begin to say it at the fourth plenary
  session of the Washington Conference.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap27"
     name="chap27">XXVII. &mdash; ABOUT THE WAR DEBTS</a></h2>

  <h3>Washington, December 13</h3>

  <p class="first">In the official proceedings of the Washington Conference
the war debts are
  never mentioned. It is an improper subject.</p>

  <p>In the talks and discussions and the journalistic writings round and about
  the Washington Conference the war debts are perpetually debated. The nature
  of the discussion is so curious and interesting, it throws so strong a light
  upon the difficulties that impede our path to any settlement of the world 's
  affairs upon the sound democratic basis of a world-wide will, that some brief
  analysis of it is necessary if this outline of the peace situation is to be
  complete.</p>

  <p>In private talk almost universally, in the weekly and monthly publications
  that are here called "highbrow," I find a very general agreement that the
  bulk of these war debts and war preparation debts as between Russia and
  France, and between the European allies and Britain, and between Britain and
  America, and the bulk of the indemnity and reparation debt of Germany to the
  Allies, cannot be paid and ought not to be paid, and that the sooner that
  this legend of indebtedness is swept out of men's imaginations the sooner we
  shall get on to the work of world reconstruction.</p>

  <p>Only one of these debts is even remotely payable and that is the British
  debt to America. But with regard to that debt the situation rises to a high
  level of absurdity. The British authorities&mdash;it is an open
  secret&mdash;have been offering to begin the liquidation of their debt now.
  They cannot pay in gold, because most of the gold in the world is already
  sleeping uselessly in American vaults; but they offer what gold they have
  and, in addition, they are willing to get their factories to work and supply
  manufactured goods to the American creditor&mdash; clothes, boots,
  automobiles, ships, agricultural and other machinery, crockery, and so on,
  and so on.</p>

  <p>Nothing could be fairer. Britain is full of unemployed&mdash;they must be
  fed anyhow&mdash;and if America insists upon her industries being buried
  under a pyramid of gold and manufactured articles, the British bankers and
  manufacturers believe they can, with an effort, manage the job and pull
  through. The exchange may take some strange flights and dives in the process,
  the British system may collapse even as the German system seems to be
  collapsing, but it is a strained situation anyhow. The British think the
  effort worth trying and the risk worth taking. And so behind the scenes it is
  Washington rather than London that wants at present to hold up the payment of
  the British debt.</p>

  <p>Only one other of the outstanding debts looks at all payable at the
  present time, and that is so much of the reparation debts of Germany to
  France as can be paid in kind, in building material and manufactured goods
  not produced in France. The idea of any other European debt payments in full
  is just nonsense. The gold is not there and the stuff is not there, and there
  is no ability to produce anything like sufficient stuff under present
  conditions.</p>

  <p>Now the interesting thing about the situation here is that the
  understanding people in America do not seem to be explaining this very simple
  situation as frankly as they might do to the mass of American people or at
  least that this explanation has not got through to the American people. There
  is a widespread conviction, which is sedulously sustained by the less
  intelligent or less scrupulous organs of the American press, that the wicked
  old European countries, and particularly Britain, that arch deceiver, are
  trying very meanly and cunningly to evade the payment of a righteous
  obligation.</p>

  <p>Every effort to present the financial and economic disorder of the world
  as a world task in which the prosperous and fortunate American people may
  reasonably play a leading, intelligent and helpful part is misrepresented in
  this fashion. There is a vast vague clamor for repayment&mdash;aimed at
  Britain. Dealers in the old Irish hate business and the German hate business,
  now a little out of their original stock of grievances, join with shrill but
  syndicated Hindus in warning the simple citizen against counsels of financial
  sanity as though they were insidious propaganda. Until at last an Englishman
  is sorely tempted to an exasperated, "Well, take your debt!"&mdash;which does
  no justice to the patience and intelligence of either England or America.</p>

  <p>Let us be clear upon one point. So far as the British debt goes, the
  Americans can have it if they prefer to take that line. The British here in
  Washington and the British writers herie are here because the Americans
  invited them to come to discuss the world situation and the possibilities of
  world peace. They are not here to beg. The time is not likely to arrive when
  one English speaking community will beg from another. It certainly has not
  arrived now.</p>

  <p>However, I am an obstinate believer in the common sense and good will of
  the American people, and I do not believe that a press campaign, designed to
  make a great people behave after the fashion of some hysterical back-street
  Oriental usurer who has struck a bad debt, is likely to do anything but
  recoil severely on the heads of those who have set it going. And I am not a
  believer in that sort of "tact" which would avoid reminding the American
  public of the circumstances under which these war debts were incurred.</p>

  <p>The Russian debt to France was spent largely upon war and war preparations
  while Russia was the ally and helper of France; the war debts of the European
  Allies to Britain and America and the British debt to America were spent upon
  war material All these debts are for efforts spent upon a common cause. Each
  country spent according to its resources, as good allies should. Russia gave
  life and blood&mdash;and blood. She gave 4,000,000 men; she smashed up her
  own social fabric. France and Britain gave the lives of men beyond the
  million mark. Also they gave much material, an enormous industrial effort. So
  also did Italy, according to her power.</p>

  <p>The British developed a vast production of munitions as the war went on,
  using great supplies of material from America, for which they paid high
  prices and on which great profits were made in America. At last America
  joined the war, with her enormous reserves and strength, and gave not only
  great stores of material but the lives of between 50,000 and 75,000 men. And
  so, altogether, America and the Allied Powers, giving their lives and
  substance as they could, saved civilization from imperialism.</p>

  <p>The British do not grudge the contribution they have made and all that
  they have still to contribute for their share in that colossal victory, but
  some of us English here are growing a little irritated at being dunned as
  defaulters when we are not going to default, and at having our attempts to
  work in co-operation with the Americans for the rehabilitation of a strained
  and collapsing civilization explained as the interested approaches of a
  cadging poor relation.</p>

  <p>I wish that Americans would think of the Europeans more frequently as
  people like themselves. The boys who came to Europe saw the European armies
  in ranks like their own, good stuff and kindred stuff. They were their
  comrades in arms; they fought and died beside them. They saw countries and a
  common life very like the American country life; they discovered that the
  French and British and Italians were also "just folk."</p>

  <p>But these American papers of the hostile sort write of France or Britain
  as if they were wicked old spiders. They write of Britain as a monster with a
  crown and an eyeglass and such like concomitants loathsome to all sound
  democratic instincts. They write of the "designs" of France and Italy and
  Britain as if these horrid monsters were all playing a fearsome game with
  each other for the soul and body of America. It is easy enough then to clamor
  for repayments of war debts. It is easy then to excite people by a clamor for
  a war bonus for the veterans of the Great War to be saddled upon the European
  debtor.</p>

  <p>But let me remind the American soldier that the real European debtor, the
  fellow on whom it will fall, the fellow who will have to toil and pay and
  want, if you can realize that dream of pitiless exaction, is no legendary
  monster France or Britain; it is that other fellow over there you fought
  beside, it is the wounded man in blue or khaki you passed by as you went into
  action, it is the man who smiled his courage at you as you blundered against
  him in the din and confusion of battle.</p>

  <p>If you listen to these stay-at-home patriots and these exotic advisers of
  yours, it is he who will pay, he and his wife and his child; they will all
  pay in toil and privation and worry and stunted lives. It is they who will
  pay-but you will not receive. You too will pay in disorganized business, in
  restricted production, in underemployment. You will get nothing else out of
  it except whatever satisfaction you may feel in having made those other
  fellows over there in Europe pay&mdash;and pay bitterly.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap28"
     name="chap28">XVIII. &mdash; THE FOUNDATION STONE AND THE BUILDING</a></h2>

  <p>Washington, December 14.</p>

  <p>Beginning with the fourth plenary session of the Washington Conference,
  the registration of " results' * in the Pacific, in disarmament, in China,
  has begun. They are good results, assembled on a basis of broad principles,
  that may sustain at last an organized permanent peace for the whole world. If
  there is one thing to be noted more than another about the work that has led
  up to this settlement it is the adaptability, the intelligent and sympathetic
  understanding shown by Japan in these transactions. The Japanese seem to be
  the most flexible minded of peoples. They win my respect more and more.</p>

  <p>In the days of imperialistic competition they stiffened to a conscientious
  selfishness and a splendid fighting energy. Now that a new spirit of
  discussion, compromise and the desire for brotherhood spreads about the
  world, they catch the new note and they sound it with obvious sincerity and
  good will. No people has been under such keen and suspicious observation here
  as the Japanese. The idea of them as of a people insanely patriotic,
  patriotically subtle and treacherous, mysterious and mentally inaccessible
  has been largely dispelled. I myself have tried that view over in my mind and
  dismissed it, and multitudes of the commonplace men have gone through the
  same experience here. Our Western world, I am convinced, can work with the
  Japanese and understand and trust them.</p>

  <p>It will be for other and abler pens to record the detailed working out of
  the results of this great conference, this new experiment in human
  reasonableness, as far as it affects Shantung and Tap and Hongkong and Port
  Arthur and so forth. My time in Washington is drawing to an end, and I will
  confine myself now rather to that broader and vaguer question in which I am
  more interested&mdash;the question of what lies behind and beyond this most
  successful and hopeful beginning in open international co-operation.</p>

  <p>Great and important as the conference is, the growth of a real and
  understandable project for the steady, systematic development of an effective
  international world peace, which has been going on in men's minds here and in
  the world generally in the last two months is a much greater thing. It is a
  quite amazing mental growth; something very quiet and simple and yet
  astonishing, like a clear crystallization out of a turbid solution. Before
  the conference gathered, civilized people throughout the world were, I think,
  quite confused about how the peace of the world could ever be organized and
  rather hopeless about its being done.</p>

  <p>Now I think there is a widespread and spreading unanimity that there is a
  way, a practicable way and a hopeful way, by successive conferences, by
  widening peace agreements, by the establishment of permanent joint
  commissions, by systematic education and the sedulous cultivation of
  confidence, along which humanity may struggle and will struggle out of its
  present miseries and dangers toward the dawn of a new life.</p>

  <p>The next conferences that are indicated will gather in a mood of
  hopefulness and experience that will be the most precious legacy of the
  present conference. One that must follow very soon must deal with the
  economic rehabilitation of Europe. Here, it seems to me, America, Britain,
  France, Germany, Italy and Russia at least must meet. And soon. In the
  Christmas mood, in the phase of relief that radiates from Washington and
  Ireland now, we must not let our elation blind us to the fact that, for all
  the light that breaks in upon us, we are not yet out of the woods. Millions
  are starving today, great masses of men degenerate physically and morally in
  unemployment, European industrialism crawls and staggers still.</p>

  <p>We have laid the foundations of a new era, but the building has scarcely
  begun. And in addition to the world economic conference there is also need of
  another conference to face the still more difficult task of military
  disarmament and the re-examination of the factors of conflict in the
  Afro-European area. Personally, I want to see America in that conference
  also, because I do recognize that the freshness of mind, the deliberate
  diplomatic inexperience of America, is a factor of priceless value in these
  discussions. I would like to see tttat conference also held in an American
  atmosphere and before an American audience&mdash;if only for the sake of
  Europe. And if America can be interested in Kwangtung, I don't see why
  America should not also be interested in Silesia, or Cilicia, or Senegal, or
  the Congo, which are all very much nearer.</p>

  <p>The appetite for conferences, the belief in conferences, will grow with
  what it feeds upon. One sees these gatherings, with their accessory
  commissions, permanent secretariats and increasing world services, becoming a
  customary and necessary peace control of the earth.</p>

  <p>And the peace control, growing in this natural fashion, will consist
  always and solely of the efficient and willing nations of the world.</p>

  <p>There will be no forced conclusions and no premature admission of
  incompetent and feeble peoples. The pedantry that would give every sovereign
  power, however little or rotten, a vote, a nice, saleable vote, in the
  management of the world's affairs will play no part in this evolution.</p>

  <p>The Association of Nations will be a growing brotherhood of strong and
  healthy and understanding peoples, bound only by a bond of self-denial and
  mutual restraint toward the weaker folk of the earth. The co-operation of the
  English speaking peoples, and particularly the American will for peace, must
  needs play a very conspicuous part in the crystallization of this
  Association, and so it is inevitable that a certain sort of international
  "expert" will be screaming that the world is threatened by an Anglo-American
  imperialism. It may be worth while to say a word or so to dispel this
  idea.</p>

  <p>Let us bear in mind that the Washington Conference, whose results may be
  the cornerstone of the organized peace of the world, is a conference of
  withdrawal and abstinence, self-restraint and mutual restraint, with regard
  to China and the Pacific; its key idea is the cessation of aggressions upon
  weaker or less advantageously circumstanced people. If America and her
  kindred nations are most active in pressing for such results, it is not that
  they are moved by any thoughts of world predominance but by liberal ideas
  that are the monopoly of no race and people. It is their fortunate lot to
  have been most accessible to such ideas and to be able now to play the
  leading, most powerful part in establishing them in the world. But these
  ideas have a broader basis and claim a wider allegiance than merely that of
  the English speaking peoples.</p>

  <p>Liberalism, the idea of great nations of free citizens held together by
  bonds of mutual confidence, roots very wide and deep in humanity. It derives
  from the great traditions of the Greek and Eoman Eepublics and from the
  traditions of freedom of the Scandinavian and Teutonic peoples. The America
  of today did not grow from American seed. Let America bear that in mind. The
  American idea is the embodiment particularly of the liberal thought of
  England and France in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. France cannot
  destroy the greatness of her past or the greatness of her future by a phase
  of momentary folly with her submarines and Senegalese, her Polish ally and
  all the rest of it.</p>

  <p>All peoples have such lapses. A few years ago Britain was disgusting with
  her jingoistic imperialism. Let us forget our lapses and get back to our more
  enduring selves. Latin America, quite as much as English speaking America,
  belongs to that great tradition of Franco-British liberalism. Liberal Germany
  in 1848 and again today struggles to take its fitting place among the
  emancipated peoples, as Italy did half a century ago. These are the peoples
  who can best understand now and help now. They are all in our system of
  ideas; they can be brought together into one purpose.</p>

  <p>It is natural and necessary that the peoples most saturated in that great
  tradition of European liberalism should be the first full members of the
  coming Association and should be prepared to lead the rest of the world
  toward the new order. All peoples are not equally prepared. It is not a
  question of ascendancy; it is a question of those who are able doing the task
  that they alone are prepared to perform.</p>

  <p>When I think of an Association of Nations I think, therefore, of a sort of
  club or brotherhood, not of every state in the world but of the peoples who
  speak English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Japanese, as the big
  brotherhood of the world, with such states as Holland and Norway and Bohemia,
  and so forth, great in quality if not great in power and entirely sympathetic
  by training and tradition, associated with them in a great bond for two ends;
  for peace among themselves and for restraint and patience toward the rest of
  mankind. I think of such a brotherhood as the brain and backbone of the
  organized peace of the world, and I cannot see how it is possible to take in
  the other peoples of the world as helpers until they respond to the same
  ideals.</p>

  <p>I think first of a recovered Russia and then of a unified and educated
  China and a freed and reconstructed India and of many other states which can
  claim to be of a civilized quality, such as Egypt, gradually winning their
  way from a non-participating to a participating level. The relationship of
  China to Japan in a developing Association of Nations will be something
  rather analogous to the relationship of a Territory to a State in the
  Constitution of the United States of America.</p>

  <p>Unless there is a strong, well organized collective mentality in a nation
  or state, I do not see how there can be anything but a sham representation of
  it upon an Association of Nations, nor how it can be anything but a
  responsibility and weakness to such an Association.</p>

  <p>And outside the system of participating states, and non-participating
  states, there are great regions of the earth&mdash;tropical Africa is the
  most typical case&mdash;which must necessarily have a sort of order imposed
  upon them from without and for which a joint control by interested associated
  nations is probably the best method of government at the present time.</p>

  <p>That, I think, is the vision of the political future of mankind that is
  opening out before us; a great system of associated states, locked and
  interlocked together by fourfold and sixfold and tenfold treaties, open
  treaties, of peace and co-operation, ruling jointly the still barbaric
  regions of the earth and pledged to respect and to keep and at last to
  welcome to their own ranks the now politically enfeebled regions of old
  civilization. Such an Association must necessarily supersede the "empires" of
  the nineteenth century and put an end forever to the imperialistic idea. Of
  such an Association the fourfold treaty may be the foundation stone. And
  within the security of such an edifice of peace mankind will be able to go on
  to achievements such as we at present can scarcely imagine.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap29"
     name="chap29">XXIX. &mdash; WHAT A STABLY ORGANIZED<br>
  WORLD PEACE MEANS FOR MANKIND</a></h2>

  <p>I have now come to the last paper I shall write about the Washington
  Conference. I have tried to give the reader some idea of the nature of that
  gathering and a broad view of the issues involved. I have tried to prevent
  the sharp discussions of the foreground, the dramatic moments and eloquent
  passages, from blinding us to the dark and darkening background of Old World
  affairs. I have tried to show that even the horrors of war are not the whole
  or the main disaster which results from human disunion and disorder in the
  presence of increasing mechanical power. I have stressed the theme of
  economic and social dissolution. Necessarily, I have had to write much of
  dangers impending and miseries which gather and increase, and of hates,
  suspicions and failures to comprehend. And on the other hand, when one has
  turiied to the possibilities and methods of escape from the present conflicts
  and apprehensions, necessarily one has been very largely in the thin and
  unattractive atmosphere of unrealized projects. I have written of the defects
  of the League of Nations scheme, its premature explicitness, its thinly
  theoretical and imitative forms, its frequent mere camouflage, as in the
  mandatory system, of existing wrongs, and I have brought into contrast with
  it this newer and I think more natural and hopeful project of successive
  Conferences, throwing off Committees, embodying their results in treaties and
  Standing Commissions, and growing at last not so much into a World
  Parliament, which I perceive more and more clearly is an improbable dream, as
  into a living, growing, organic network of World Government.</p>

  <p>But now in conclusion I will ask the reader to turn his mind from this
  necessary discussion of political devices and administrative contrivances,
  these bleak inventions that may form the ladder of escape from the divisions
  and bitterness of the present time, and to join in an attempt to realize what
  the world may become if men do struggle through these tiresome and perplexing
  problems to a working solution, if our race really does get from these
  wearisome yet hopeful wranglings and dealings to an organized world peace, to
  a disarmed world, to a steady reduction of racial and national antipathies
  and distrusts, to a growing confidence in the permanence of peace and the
  prevalence of good will throughout our planet, to a comprehensive system of
  world controls of the common interests of mankind. Suppose that after these
  present darknesses of famine and almost universal insecurity, these confused
  and often conflicting efforts we are making; suppose that in ten, or twenty,
  or thirty years we shall begin to realize that the thing is, after all,
  getting done, that we are indeed pushing through, moving towards the light,
  that human affairs are on the up-grade again and on new and greater and
  safer lines; let us suppose that and then let us ask what sort of world it
  will be for our kind that we shall be moving towards!</p>

  <p>Let us go back to one fundamental fact in the present break-up in human
  affairs. That break-up is not a result of debility; <i>it is a result of ill-
  regulated power</i>. It is important to bear that in mind. Disproportionate
  development of energy and overstrain are the immediate causes of our present
  troubles; the scale of modern economic enterprise has outgrown the little
  boundaries of the European States; science and invention have made war so
  monstrously destructive and disintegrative that victory is swallowed up in
  disaster; we are in a world of little nations wielding world-wide powers to
  the general destruction. And it follows that if, after all, we do struggle
  out of our old-fashioned and now altogether disastrous rivalries and hatreds
  before they destroy us, we shall still have all this science and power, which
  are things that seem now to increase by a sort of inner necessity, on our
  hands. So that getting through to an organized world peace does not mean
  simply avoiding death and destruction and getting back to "as you were." It
  means getting hold of power by the right end instead of the wrong end and
  going right ahead. We are not struggling simply to escape, we are struggling
  for the opportunity to achieve.</p>

  <p>Personally, I do not think I would have bothered to come to Washington or
  to interest myself in this peace business, and to work and blunder and feel
  incompetent and be worried and distressed here, if it meant working for just
  peace, flat, empty, simple peace. I do not see why the killing of a few score
  millions of human beings a few years before they would naturally and
  ingloriously die, or the smashing up of a lot of ordinary, rather ugly,
  rather uncomfortable towns, or, if it comes to that sort of thing, the
  complete depopulation of the earth, or the prospect of being killed myself
  presently by a bomb or a shot or a pestilence, should move me to any great
  exertions. Why bother to exchange suffering for flatness? The worst, least
  endurable of miseries is boredom. One must die somewhere; few deaths are as
  painful as a first-class toothache or as depressing as a severe fit of
  indigestion; yon can suffer more on a comfortable death bed than on a
  battlefield; and meanwhile, there is a very good chance of sunshine and
  snatched happiness here or there. But what does stir me is my invincible
  belief that the life I lead and the human life about me are not anything like
  the good thing that could be and might be. I am not so much frightened and
  distressed by these wars and national clashes and all the rest of this silly
  flag-wagging, bragging, shoving busi-ness as bored and irritated by these
  things. I have had some vision of what science and education can do for life
  and I am haunted by the fine uses that might be made of men and of our
  splendid possibilities. I do not think of war as a tragic necessity but as a
  blood-stained mess. When I think of my Europe now, I do not feel like a
  weakling whose world has been invaded by stupendous and cruel powers; I feel
  like a man whose promising garden has been invaded by hogs. There is the
  pacificism of love, the pacificism of pity, the pacificism of commercialism,
  but also there is the pacificism of utter contempt. This is not a doomed
  world we live in or anything so tragically dignified; it is a world
  idiotically spoilt.</p>

  <p>Do any of us fully realize the promise of that garden, the promise that
  can still be rescued from the trampling dullness of old animosities and
  rivalries~which is wrecking it?. Given unity of purpose throughout the world,
  given a surcease of mutual thwarting and destruction, do we realize what
  science has made possible now and here for mankind?</p>

  <p>I shall not indulge in any imaginative anticipations of things still
  undiscovered in the scientific realm, I will only suppose that things already
  known and tested are systematically used all over the world, that the good
  knowledge we have already stored in our laboratories and libraries is really
  applied with some thoroughness and with some community of purpose to the
  needs and enlargement of life.</p>

  <p>And first let us deal with the commoner material aspects of life in which
  there have been great changes and improvements in recent times and in which,
  therefore, it is easiest to imagine still further betterment, given only an
  assuagement of strife and blind struggle and a spreading out of generosity
  and the feeling of community from international to social affairs.</p>

  <p>Take transport, that very fundamental social concern. It is ripe for great
  advances. There is all the labor needed in the world, all the skill and
  knowledge needed, and all the material needed, for these advances. There is
  everything needed but peace and the recognition of a common purpose. At
  present, there are railways only over a part of the inhabited world; there
  are vast areas of Asia and Africa and South America with no railway nor road
  communication at all and with enormous natural resources scarcely tapped, in
  consequence. Roads are as yet not nearly so widespread as railways, abundant
  good roads are founded indeed only in Western Europe and the better developed
  regions of the United States; there are a few good main roads in such
  countries as India, South Africa, and so forth. And in many parts of Europe
  now, and especially in Russia roads and railways are going out of use. Large
  parts of the world are still only to be reached by a specially equipped
  expedition; they are as inaccessible to ordinary travelling people as the
  other side of the moon. And if you will probe into the reasons why road and
  rail transport fails to develop and is even over wide areas undergoing
  degradation, you will come in nearly every case upon a political bar, a
  national or an imperial rivalry. These are the things that close half our
  world to us and may presently close most of the world to us. And consider
  even the railroads and roads we have; even those of America or Britain, how
  poor and uncomfortable they are in comparison with what we know they might
  be.</p>

  <p>And then take housing. I have been motoring about a little in Maryland and
  Virginia and I am astounded at the many miserable wood houses I see, hovels
  rather than houses, the abodes very often of white men. I am astounded at the
  wretched fences about the ill-kept patches of cultivation and by the extreme
  illiteracy of many of the poorer folk, white as well as colored, with whom I
  have had a chance of talking. I have to remind myself that I am in what is
  now the greatest, richest, most powerful country in the world. But with this
  country now as with every country, army, navy, contentious service, war debt
  charges and the rest of the legacy of past wars consume the national revenue.
  America is not spending a tithe of what she ought to be spending upon
  schools, upon the maintenance of a housing standard and upon roads and
  transport. She improves in all these things, but at no great pace, because of
  the disunion of the world and the threat of war. England and France, which
  were once far ahead of her in these respects of housing, transport and
  popular education, are now on the whole declining, through the excessive
  fiscal burthens they are under to pay for the late war and prepare for fresh
  ones. But I ask you to think what would happen to a world from which that
  burthen of preparedness was lifted. The first result of that relief would be
  a diversion of the huge maintenance allowance of the war-God to just these
  starved and neglected things.</p>

  <p>Stanch that waste throughout the earth, and the saved wealth and energy
  will begin at once to flow in the direction of better houses, towards a
  steady increase in the order and gra-ciousness of our unkempt and slovenly
  countrysides, to making better roads throughout the globe, until the globe is
  accessible, and to a huge enrichment and invigoration of education.</p>

  <p>How fair and lovely such countries as France and Germany and Italy might
  be today if the dark threat of war that keeps them so gaunt and
  poverty-struck could be lifted from them. Think of the abundant and various
  loveliness of France and the wit and charm of its varied peoples, now turned
  sour by the toil and trouble, the fears and bitter suspicions the threat of
  further war holds over them. Think of France, fearless and at last showing
  the world what France can do and be. And Italy at last Italy, and Japan,
  Japan. Think of the green hills of Virginia, covered with stately homes and
  cheerful houses. Think of a world in which travel is once more free and in
  which every country in absolute security has been able to resume its own
  peace-time development of its architecture, its music and all its arts in its
  own atmosphere upon the foundations of its own past. Because world unity does
  not mean uniformity; it means security to be different. It is war that forces
  all men into the same khaki and iron-clad moulds.</p>

  <p>But all this recovery of the visible idiosyncracies of nations, all this
  confident activity and progressive enrichment which will inevitably ensue
  upon the diversion of human attention from war and death and conflict and
  mutual thwarting to peace and development, will be but the outer indication
  of much profounder changes. Believed of our war burthens, it will be possible
  to take hold of education as educationists have been longing to do for many
  years.</p>

  <p>They tell us now that every one could be educated up to sixteen or
  seventeen and that most people may be kept learning and growing mentally all
  their lives, that no country in world has enough schools, or properly
  equipped schools, nor enough properly educated teachers in the schools we
  have. The supply of university resources is still more meager. There is
  hardly anyone alive who has not a sense of things that he could know but
  cannot attain and of powers he can never develop. The number of fully
  educated and properly nurtured people in the world, people who can be said to
  have come reasonably near to realizing their full birth possibilities, is
  almost infinitesimal. The rest of mankind are either physically or mentally
  stunted, or both. This insolvent, slovenly old world has begotten them, and
  starved them. Our lives, in strength, in realized capacity, in achievement
  and happiness are perhaps 20% or 30% of what they ought to be. But if only we
  could sweep aside these everlast ing contentions, these hates and disputes
  that waste our earth, and get to work upon this educational proposition as a
  big business man gets to work upon a mineral deposit or the develop ment of
  an invention, instead of a 20% result we might clamber to an 80% or a 90% in
  educated efficiency. I ask you to go through the crowded streets of a town
  and note the many under-grown and ill-grown, the under sized, the
  ill-behaved; to note the appeals to childish, prejudiced and misshapen minds
  in the shop windows, in the advertisements, in the newspaper headlines at the
  street corners, and then to try and think of what might be there even now in
  the place of that street and that crowd.</p>

  <p>The wealth and energy were there to make schools and give physical and
  mental training to all these people, and they have gone to burst shells and
  smash up the work of men, the or ganizing power has been wasted upon barren
  disputes ; the science was there and it has been cramped and misused; even
  the will was there, but it was not organized to effective application. And
  scarcely a man in the crowd who begets a child, or a woman who bears one, but
  will dream of its growing to something better than the twarted hope it will
  become.</p>

  <p>Have you ever examined an aeroplane or a submarine,, and realized the
  thousand beautiful adjustments and devices that have produced its wonderful
  perfection? Have you ever looked at a street corner loafer and thought of the
  ten thousand opportunities that have been cast away of saving him from what
  he has become?</p>

  <p>When we follow this line of thought, it becomes clear that our first
  vision of a world-wide net of fine roads, great steady trains on renewed and
  broader tracks, long distance aeroplane flights of the securest sort,
  splendid and beautiful towns, a parklike countryside, studded with delightful
  homes, was merely the scene and frame for a population of well-grown,
  well-trained, fully adult human begins. All the world will be accessible to
  them, mountains to climb, deserts to be alone in, tropics to explore in
  wonder, beautiful places for rest And they will be healthy, and happy in the
  way that only health makes possible. For surely it is no news to any one that
  a score of horrible tints and diseases that weaken and cripple us, a number
  of infections, a multitude of ill-nourished and un-dernourished states of
  body, can be completely controlled and banished from life, they and all the
  misery they entail given only a common effort, given only human co-operation
  instead of discussion. The largest visible material harvest of peace is the
  least harvest of peace. The great harvest will be health and human vigor.</p>

  <p>And happiness! Think of the mornings that will some day come, when men
  will wake to read in the papers of something better than the great 5-5-3
  wrangle, of the starvation and disorder of half the world, of the stupid
  sexual crimes and greedy dishonesties committed by the adults with the
  undeveloped intelligence of vicious children, of suggestions of horrible
  plots and designs against our threadbare security, of the dreary necessity
  for "preparedness." Think of a morning when the newspaper has mainly
  <i>good</i> news, of things discovered, of fine things done; think of the
  common day of a common citizen in a world where debt is no longer a universal
  burthen, where there is constant progress and no retrogression, where it is
  the normal thing to walk out of a beautiful house into a clean and splendid
  street, to pass and meet happy and interesting adults instead of aged
  children obsessed by neglected spites and jealousies and mean anxieties, to
  go to some honorable occupation that helps the world forward to a still
  greater and finer life. You may say that a world may be prosperous and men
  and women healthy and free and yet there will still be spites and jealousies
  and all the bitterness of disputation, but that is no more true than that
  there will still be toothache. A mind educated and cared for, quite as well
  as a body, can be healed and kept clean and sweet and free from these
  maddening humiliations and suppressions that now fester in so many souls.
  There is no real necessity about either physical or mental miserableness in
  human life. Given, that is, a sufficient release of human energy to bring a
  proper care within the reach of all. And consider the quality of interest in
  such a world. Think of the mental quality of a world in which each day the
  thought and research of a great host of intelligences turns more and more the
  opaque and confused riddles of yesteryear into transparent lucidity. Think of
  the forces of personal and national idiosyncracy, of patriotic and racial
  assertion, seeking and finding their expression not in vile mutual thwarting
  and a brutish destructiveness, but in the distinctive architecture of cities,
  in the cultivated and intensified beauty of the country-side, in a hundred
  forms of art, in costume and custom. Think of the freedom, the abundance, the
  harmonious differences of such a world!</p>

  <p>This is not idle prophecy, this is no dream. Such a world is ours today if
  we could but turn the minds of men to realize that it is here for the having.
  These things can be done, this finer world is within reach. I can write that
  as confidently today as I wrote in 1900 that men could fly. But whether we
  are to stop this foolery of international struggle, this moral and mental
  childishness of patriotic aggressions, this continual bloodshed and squalor,
  and start out for a world of adult sanity in ten years, or in twenty years,
  or a hundred years, or never, is more than I can say. In Washington, I have
  met and seen hopes that seemed invincible, and stupidities and habits and
  prejudices that seemed insurmountable; I have lived for six weeks in a
  tangled conflict of great phrases, mean ends, inspiration, illogicality,
  forgetfulness, f lashes of greatness and flashes of grossness. I am no moral
  accountant to cast a balance and estimate a date. My moods have fluctuated
  between hope and despair.</p>

  <p>But I know that I believe so firmly in this great World at Peace that lies
  so close to our own, ready to come into being as our wills turn towards it,
  that I must needs go about this present world of disorder and darkness like
  an exile doing such feeble things as I can towards the world of my desire,
  now hopefully, now bitterly, as the moods may happen, until I die.</p>
