<h2><a id="swords1" name="swords1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">KIRBY O'DONNELL opened his chamber door
and gazed out, his long keen-bladed <i>kindhjal</i> in his hand.
Somewhere a cresset glowed fitfully, dimly lighting the broad
hallway, flanked by thick columns. The spaces between these columns
were black arched wells of darkness, where anything might be
lurking.</p>

<p>Nothing moved within his range of vision. The great hall seemed
deserted. But he knew that he had not merely dreamed that he heard
the stealthy pad of bare feet outside his door, the stealthy sound
of unseen hands trying the portal.</p>

<p>O'Donnell felt the peril that crawled unseen about him, the
first white man ever to set foot in forgotten Shahrazar, the
forbidden, age-old city brooding high among the Afghan mountains.
He believed his disguise was perfect; as Ali el Ghazi, a wandering
Kurd, he had entered Shahrazar, and as such he was a guest in the
palace of its prince. But the furtive footfalls that had awakened
him were a sinister portent.</p>

<p>He stepped out into the hall cautiously, closing the door behind
him. A single step he took&mdash;it was the swish of a garment that
warned him. He whirled, quick as a cat, and saw, all in a split
second, a great black body hurtling at him from the shadows, the
gleam of a plunging knife. And simultaneously he himself moved in a
blinding blur of speed. A shift of his whole body avoided the
stroke, and as the blade licked past, splitting only thin air, his
<i>kindhjal</i>, driven with desperate energy, sank its full length
in the black torso.</p>

<p>An agonized groan was choked by a rush of blood in the dusky
throat. The Negro's knife rang on the marble floor, and the great
black figure, checked in its headlong rush, swayed drunkenly and
pitched forward. O'Donnell watched with his eyes as hard as flint
as the would-be murderer shuddered convulsively and then lay still
in a widening crimson pool.</p>

<p>He recognized the man, and as he stood staring down at his
victim, a train of associations passed swiftly through his mind,
recollections of past events crowding on a realization of his
present situation.</p>

<p>Lure of treasure had brought O'Donnell in his disguise to
forbidden Shahrazar. Since the days of Genghis Khan, Shahrazar had
sheltered the treasure of the long-dead shahs of Khuwarezm. Many an
adventurer had sought that fabled hoard, and many had died. But
O'Donnell had found it&mdash;only to lose it.</p>

<p>Hardly had he arrived in Shahrazar when a band of marauding
Turkomans, under their chief, Orkhan Bahadur, had stormed the city
and captured it, slaying its prince, the Uzbek Shaibar Khan. And
while the battle raged in the streets, O'Donnell had found the
hidden treasure in a secret chamber, and his brain had reeled at
its splendor. But he had been unable to bear it away, and he dared
not leave it for Orkhan. The emissary of an intriguing European
power was in Shahrazar, plotting to use that treasure to conquer
India. O'Donnell had done away with it forever. The victorious
Turkomans had searched for it in vain.</p>

<p>O'Donnell, as Ali el Ghazi, had once saved Orkhan Bahadur's
life, and the prince made the supposed Kurd welcome in the palace.
None dreamed of his connection with the disappearance of the hoard,
unless&mdash;O'Donnell stared somberly down at the figure on the
marble floor.</p>

<p>That man was Baber, a Soudani servant of Suleiman Pasha, the
emissary.</p>

<p>O'Donnell lifted his head and swept his gaze over the black
arches, the shadowy columns. Had he only imagined that he heard
movement back in the darkness? Bending over quickly, he grasped the
limp body and heaved it on his shoulder&mdash;an act impossible for
a man with less steely thews&mdash;and started down the hall. A
corpse found before his door meant questions, and the fewer
questions O'Donnell had to answer the better.</p>

<p>He went down the broad, silent hall and descended a wide marble
stair into swallowing gloom, like an oriental demon carrying a
corpse to hell; groped through a tapestried door and down a short,
black corridor to a blank marble wall.</p>

<p>When he thrust against this with his foot, a section swung
inward, working on a pivot, and he entered a circular, domed
chamber with a marble floor and walls hung with heavy gilt-worked
tapestries, between which showed broad golden frieze-work. A bronze
lamp cast a soft light, making the dome seem lofty and full of
shadows, while the tapestries were clinging squares of velvet
darkness.</p>

<p>This had been the treasure vault of Shaibar Khan, and why it was
empty now, only Kirby O'Donnell could tell.</p>

<p>Lowering the black body with a gasp of relief, for the burden
had taxed even his wiry thews to the utmost, he deposited it
exactly on the great disk that formed the center of the marble
floor. Then he crossed the chamber, seized a gold bar that seemed
merely part of the ornamentation, and jerked it strongly. Instantly
the great central disk revolved silently, revealing a glimpse of a
black opening, into which the corpse tumbled. The sound of rushing
water welled up from the darkness, and then the slab, swinging on
its pivot, completed its revolution and the floor showed again a
smooth unbroken surface.</p>

<p>But O'Donnell wheeled suddenly. The lamp burned low, filling the
chamber with a lurid unreal light. In that light he saw the door
open silently and a slim dark figure glide in.</p>

<p>It was a slender man with long nervous hands and an ivory oval
of a face, pointed with a short black beard. His eyes were long and
oblique, his garments dark, even his turban. In his hand a blue,
snub-nosed revolver glinted dully.</p>

<p>"Suleiman Pasha!" muttered O'Donnell tensely.</p>

<p>He had never been able to decide whether this man was the
Oriental he seemed, or a European in masquerade. Had the man
penetrated his own disguise? The emissary's first words assured him
that such was not the case.</p>

<p>"Ali el Ghazi," said Suleiman, "you have lost me a valuable
servant, but you have told me a secret. None other knows the secret
of that revolving slab. I did not, until I followed you, after you
killed Baber, and watched you through the door, though I have
suspected that this chamber was the treasure vault.</p>

<p>"I have suspected you&mdash;now I am certain. I know why the
treasure has never been found. You disposed of it as you have
disposed of Baber. You are cup-companion to Prince Orkhan Bahadur.
But if I told him you cast away the treasure forever, do you
suppose his friendship would prevail over his wrath?</p>

<p>"Keep back!" he warned. "I did not say that I would tell Orkhan.
Why you threw away the treasure I cannot guess, unless it was
because of fanatical loyalty to Shaibar Kahn."</p>

<p>He looked him over closely. "Face like a hawk, body of coiled
steel springs," he murmured. "I can use you, my Kurdish
swaggerer."</p>

<p>"How use me?" demanded O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"You can help me in the game I play with Orkhan Bahadur. The
treasure is gone, but I can still use him, I and the
<i>Feringis</i> who employ me. I will make him amir of Afghanistan
and, after that, sultan of India."</p>

<p>"And the puppet of the <i>Feringis,"</i> grunted O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"What is that to thee?" Suleiman laughed. "Thine is not to
think. I will do the thinking; see thou to the enacting of my
commands."</p>

<p>"I have not said that I would serve you," growled O'Donnell
doggedly.</p>

<p>"You have no other choice," answered Suleiman calmly. "If you
refuse, I will reveal to Orkhan that which I learned tonight, and
he will have you flayed alive."</p>

<p>O'Donnell bent his head moodily. He was caught in a vise of
circumstances. It had not been loyalty to Shaibar Khan, as Suleiman
thought, which had caused him to dump an emperor's ransom in gold
and jewels into the subterranean river. He knew Suleiman plotted
the overthrow of British rule in India and the massacre of the
helpless millions. He knew that Orkhan Bahadur, a ruthless
adventurer despite his friendship for the false Kurd, was a pliant
tool in the emissary's hands. The treasure had been too potent a
weapon to leave within their reach.</p>

<p>Suleiman was either a Russian or the Oriental tool of the
Russians. Perhaps he, too, had secret ambitions. The Khuwarezm
treasure had been a pawn in his game but, even without it, a tool
of the emissary's sitting on the throne of Shahrazar, was a living
menace to the peace of India. So O'Donnell had remained in the
city, seeking in every way to thwart Suleiman's efforts to dominate
Orkhan Bahadur. And now he himself was trapped.</p>

<p>He lifted his head and stared murderously at the slim Oriental.
"What do you wish me to do?" he muttered.</p>

<p>"I have a task for you," answered Suleiman. "An hour ago word
came to me, by one of my secret agents, that the tribesmen of
Khuruk have found an Englishman dying in the hills, with valuable
papers upon him. I must have those papers. I sent the man on to
Orkhan, while I dealt with you.</p>

<p>"But I have changed my plans in regard to you; you are more
valuable to me alive than dead, since there is no danger of your
opposing me in the future. Orkhan will desire those papers that the
Englishman carried, for the man was undoubtedly a secret-service
agent, and I will persuade the prince to send you with a troop of
horsemen to secure them. And remember you are taking your real
orders from me, not from Orkhan."</p>

<p>He stepped aside and motioned O'Donnell to precede him.</p>

<p>They traversed the short corridor, an electric torch in
Suleiman's left hand playing its beam on his sullen, watchful
companion, climbed the stair and went through the wide hall, thence
along a winding corridor and into a chamber where Orkhan Bahadur
stood near a gold-barred window which opened onto an arcaded court,
which was just being whitened by dawn. The prince of Shahrazar was
resplendent in satin and pearl-sewn velvet which did not mask the
hard lines of his lean body.</p>

<p>His thin dark features lighted at the sight of his
cup-companion, but O'Donnell reflected on the wolf that lurked ever
below the surface of this barbaric chieftain, and how suddenly it
could be unmasked, snarling and flame-eyed.</p>

<p>"Welcome, friends!" said the Turkoman, pacing the chamber
restlessly. "I have heard a tale! Three days' ride to the southwest
are the villages of Ahmed Shah, in the valley of Khuruk. Four days
ago his men came upon a man dying in the mountains. He wore the
garments of an Afghan, but in his delirium he revealed himself as
an Englishman. When he was dead they searched him for loot and
found certain papers which none of the dogs could read.</p>

<p>"But in his ravings he spoke of having been to Bokhara. It is in
my mind that this <i>Feringi</i> was an English spy, returning to
India with papers valuable to the <i>sirkar</i>. Perhaps the
British would pay well for these papers, if they knew of them. It
is my wish to possess them. Yet I dare not ride forth myself, nor
send many men. Suppose the treasure was found in my absence? My own
men would bar the gates against me."</p>

<p>"This is a matter for diplomacy rather than force," put in
Suleiman Pasha smoothly. "Ali el Ghazi is crafty as well as bold.
Send him with fifty men."</p>

<p>"Can thou do it, brother?" demanded Orkhan eagerly.</p>

<p>Suleiman's gaze burned into O'Donnell's soul. There was but one
answer, if he wished to escape flaying steel and searing fire.</p>

<p>"Only in Allah is power," he muttered. "Yet I can attempt the
thing."</p>

<p><i>"Mashallah!"</i> exclaimed Orkhan. "Be ready to start within
the hour. There is a Khurukzai in the <i>suk</i>, one Dost Shah,
who is of Ahmed's clan, and will guide you. There is friendship
between me and the men of Khuruk. Approach Ahmed Shah in peace and
offer him gold for the papers, but not too much, lest his cupidity
be roused. But I leave it to your own judgment. With fifty men
there is no fear of the smaller clans between Shahrazar and Khuruk.
I go now to choose the men to ride with you."</p>

<p>As soon as Orkhan left the chamber, Suleiman bent close to
O'Donnell and whispered: "Secure the papers, but do not bring them
to Orkhan! Pretend that you have lost them in the
hills&mdash;anything&mdash;but bring them to <i>me.</i>"</p>

<p>"Orkhan will be angry and suspicious," objected O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"Not half as angry as he would be if he knew what became of the
Khuwarezm treasure," retorted Suleiman. "Your only chance is to
obey me. If your men return without you, saying you have fled away,
be sure a hundred men will quickly be upon your trail&mdash;nor can
you hope to win alone through these hostile, devil-haunted hills,
anyway. Do not dare to return without the papers, if you do not
wish to be denounced to Orkhan. Your life depends on your playing
my game, Kurd!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="swords2" name="swords2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">PLAYING SULEIMAN'S "GAME" seemed to be the
only thing to do, even three days later as O'Donnell, in his guise
of the Kurdish swashbuckler, Ali el Ghazi, was riding along a trail
that followed a ledgelike fold of rock ribbing a mile-wide
cliff.</p>

<p>Just ahead of him on a bony crow-bait rode the Khurukzai guide,
a hairy savage with a dirty white turban, and behind him strung out
in single file fifty of Orkhan Bahadur's picked warriors. O'Donnell
felt the pride of a good leader of fighting men as he glanced back
at them. These were no stunted peasants, but tall, sinewy men with
the pride and temper of hawks; nomads and sons of nomads, born to
the saddle. They rode horses that were distinctive in that land of
horsemen, and their rifles were modern repeaters.</p>

<p>"Listen!" It was the Khurukzai who halted suddenly, lifting a
hand in warning.</p>

<p>O'Donnell leaned forward, rising in the wide silver stirrups,
turning his head slightly sidewise. A gust of wind whipped along
the ledge, bearing with it the echoes of a series of sputtering
reports.</p>

<p>The men behind O'Donnell heard it, too, and there was a creaking
of saddles as they instinctively unslung rifles and hitched
yataghan hilts forward.</p>

<p>"Rifles!" exclaimed Dost Shah. "Men are fighting in the
hills."</p>

<p>"How far are we from Khuruk?" asked O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"An hour's ride," answered the Khurukzai, glancing at the
mid-afternoon sun. "Beyond the corner of the cliff we can see the
Pass of Akbar, which is the boundary of Ahmed Shah's territory.
Khuruk is some miles beyond."</p>

<p>"Push on, then," said O'Donnell.</p>

<p>They moved on around the crag which jutted out like the prow of
a ship, shutting off all view to the south. The path narrowed and
sloped there, so the men dismounted and edged their way, leading
the animals which grew half frantic with fear.</p>

<p>Ahead of them the trail broadened and sloped up to a fan-shaped
plateau, flanked by rugged ridges. This plateau narrowed to a pass
in a solid wall of rock hundreds of feet high; the pass was a
triangular gash, and a stone tower in its mouth commanded the
approach. There were men in the tower, and they were firing at
other men who lay out on the plateau in a wide ragged crescent,
concealed behind boulders and rocky ledges. But these were not all
firing at the tower, as it presently became apparent.</p>

<p>Off to the left of the pass, skirting the foot of the cliffs, a
ravine meandered. Men were hiding in this ravine, and O'Donnell
quickly saw that they were trapped there. The men out on the
plateau had cast a cordon around it and were working their way
closer, shooting as they came. The men in the ravine fired back,
and a few corpses were strewn among the rocks. But from the sound
of the firing, there were only a few men in the gully, and the men
in the tower could not come to their aid. It would have been
suicide to try to cross that bullet-swept open space between the
ravine and the pass mouth.</p>

<p>O'Donnell had halted his men at an angle of the cliff where the
trail wound up toward the plateau, and had advanced with the
Khurukzai guide part way up the incline.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>Dost Shah shook his head like one puzzled. "That is the Pass of
Akbar," he said. "That tower is Ahmed Shah's. Sometimes the tribes
come to fight us, and we shoot them from the tower. It can only be
Ahmed's riflemen in the tower and in the ravine. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>He shook his head again, and having tied his horse to a
straggling tamarisk, he went up the slope, craning his neck and
hugging his rifle, while he muttered in his beard as if in
uncertainty.</p>

<p>O'Donnell followed him to the crest where the trail bent over
the rim of the plateau, but with more caution than the Khurukzai
was showing. They were now within rifle range of the combatants,
and bullets were whistling like hornets across the plateau.</p>

<p>O'Donnell could plainly make out the forms of the besiegers
lying among the rocks that littered the narrow plain. Evidently
they had not noticed him and the guide, and he did not believe they
saw his men where he had stationed them in the shade of an
overhanging crag. All their attention was fixed on the ravine, and
they yelled with fierce exultation as a turban thrust above its rim
fell back splashed with crimson. The men in the tower yelled with
helpless fury.</p>

<p>"Keep your head down, you fool!" O'Donnell swore at Dost Shah,
who was carelessly craning his long neck above a cluster of
rocks.</p>

<p>"The men in the tower <i>must</i> be Ahmed's men," muttered Dost
Shah uneasily. "Yes; it could not be otherwise, yet&mdash;Allah!"
The last was an explosive yelp, and he sprang up like a madman, as
if forgetting all caution in some other overwhelming emotion.</p>

<p>O'Donnell cursed and grabbed at him to pull him down, but he
stood brandishing his rifle, his tattered garments whipping in the
wind like a demon of the hills.</p>

<p>"What devil's work is this?" he yelled. "That is not&mdash;those
are not&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice changed to a gasp as a bullet drilled him through the
temple. He tumbled back to the ground and lay without motion.</p>

<p>"Now what was he going to say?" muttered O'Donnell, peering out
over the rocks. "Was that a stray slug, or did somebody see
him?"</p>

<p>He could not tell whether the shot came from the boulders or the
tower. It was typical of hill warfare, the yells and shooting
keeping up an incessant devil's din. One thing was certain: the
cordon was gradually closing about the men trapped in the ravine.
They were well hidden from the bullets, but the attackers were
working so close that presently they could finish the job with a
short swift rush and knife work at close quarters.</p>

<p>O'Donnell fell back down the incline, and coming to the eager
Turkomans, spoke hurriedly: "Dost Shah is dead, but he has brought
us to the borders of Ahmed Shah's territory. Those in the tower are
Khurukzai, and these men attacking them have cut off some
chief&mdash;probably Ahmed Shah himself&mdash;in that ravine. I
judge that from the noise both sides are making. Then, they'd
scarcely be taking such chances to slaughter a few common warriors.
If we rescue him we shall have a claim on his friendship, and our
task will be made easy, as Allah makes all things for brave
men.</p>

<p>"The men attacking seem to me not to number more than a hundred
men&mdash;twice our number, true, but there are circumstances in
our favor, surprise, and the fact that the men in the pass will
undoubtedly sally out if we create a diversion in the enemy's rear.
At present the Khurukzai are bottled in the pass. They cannot
emerge, any more than the raiders can enter in the teeth of their
bullets."</p>

<p>"We await orders," the men answered.</p>

<p>Turkomans have no love for Kurds, but the horsemen knew that Ali
el Ghazi was cup-companion to their prince.</p>

<p>"Ten men to hold the horses!" he snapped. "The rest follow
me."</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were crawling after him up the short
slope. He lined them along the crest, seeing that each man was
sheltered among the boulders.</p>

<p>This took but a few minutes, but in that interim the men
crawling toward the ravine sprang to their feet and tore madly
across the intervening space, yelling like blood-crazed wolves,
their curved blades glittering in the sun. Rifles spat from the
gully and three of the attackers dropped, and the men in the tower
sent up an awful howl and turned their guns desperately on the
charging mob. But the range at that angle was too great.</p>

<p>Then O'Donnell snapped an order, and a withering line of flame
ran along the crest of the ridge. His men were picked marksmen and
understood the value of volleys. Some thirty men were in the open,
charging the ravine. A full half of them went down struck from
behind, as if by some giant invisible fist. The others halted,
realizing that something was wrong; they cringed dazedly, turning
here and there, grasping their long knives, while the bullets of
the Turkomans took further toll.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, realizing that they were being attacked from the
rear, they dived screaming for cover. The men in the tower, sensing
reinforcements, sent up a wild shout and redoubled their fire.</p>

<p>The Turkomans, veterans of a hundred wild battles, hugged their
boulders and kept aiming and firing without the slightest
confusion. The men on the plateau were kicking up the devil's own
din. They were caught in the jaws of the vise, with bullets coming
from both ways, and no way of knowing the exact numbers of their
new assailants.</p>

<p>The break came with hurricane suddenness, as is nearly always
the case in hill fighting. The men on the plain broke and fled
westward, a disorderly mob, scrambling over boulders and leaping
gullies, their tattered garments flapping in the wind.</p>

<p>The Turkomans sent a last volley into their backs, toppling over
distant figures like tenpins, and the men in the tower gave tongue
and began scrambling down into the pass.</p>

<p>O'Donnell cast a practiced eye at the fleeing marauders, knew
that the rout was final, and called for the ten men below him to
bring up the horses swiftly. He had an eye for dramatics, and he
knew the effect they would make filing over the ridge and out
across the boulder-strewn plain on their Turkish steeds.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he enjoyed that effect and the surprised
yells of the men they had aided as they saw the Astrakhan
<i>kalpaks</i> of the riders top the ridge. The pass was crowded
with men in ragged garments, grasping rifles, and in evident doubt
as to the status of the newcomers.</p>

<p>O'Donnell headed straight for the ravine, which was nearer the
ridge than it was to the pass, believing the Khurukzai chief was
among those trapped there.</p>

<p>His rifle was slung on his back, and his open right hand raised
as a sign of peace; seeing which the men in the pass dubiously
lowered their rifles and came streaming across the plateau toward
him, instead of pursuing the vanquished, who were already
disappearing among the distant crags and gullies.</p>

<p>A dozen steps from the ridge of the ravine O'Donnell drew rein,
glimpsing turbans among the rocks, and called out a greeting in
<i>Pashtu</i>. A deep bellowing voice answered him, and a vast
figure heaved up into full view, followed by half a dozen lesser
shapes.</p>

<p>"Allah be with thee!" roared the first man.</p>

<p>He was tall, broad, and powerful; his beard was stained with
henna, and his eyes blazed like fires burning under gray ice. One
massive fist gripped a rifle, the thumb of the other was hooked
into the broad silken girdle which banded his capacious belly, as
he tilted back on his heels and thrust his beard out truculently.
That girdle likewise supported a broad tulwar and three or four
knives.</p>

<p><i>"Mashallah!"</i> roared this individual. "I had thought it
was my own men who had taken the dogs in the rear, until I saw
those fur caps. Ye are Turks from Shahrazar, no doubt?"</p>

<p>"Aye; I am Ali el Ghazi, a Kurd, brother-in-arms to Orkhan
Bahadur. You are Ahmed Shah, lord of Khuruk?"</p>

<p>There was a hyenalike cackle of laughter from the lean,
evil-eyed men who had followed the big man out of the gully.</p>

<p>"Ahmed Shah has been in hell these four days," rumbled the
giant. "I am Afzal Khan, whom men name the Butcher."</p>

<p>O'Donnell sensed rather than heard a slight stir among the men
behind him. Most of them understood <i>Pashtu</i>, and the deeds of
Afzal Khan had found echo in the <i>serais</i> of Turkestan. The
man was an outlaw, even in that lawless land, a savage plunderer
whose wild road was lurid with the smoke and blood of
slaughter.</p>

<p>"But that pass is the gateway to Khuruk," said O'Donnell,
slightly bewildered.</p>

<p>"Aye!" agreed Afzal Khan affably. "Four days ago I came down
into the valley from the east and drove out the Khurukzai dogs.
Ahmed Shah I slew with my own hands&mdash;so!"</p>

<p>A flicker of red akin to madness flamed up momentarily in his
eyes as he smashed the butt of his rifle down on a dead tamarisk
branch, shattering it from the trunk. It was as if the mere mention
of murder roused the sleeping devil in him. Then his beard bristled
in a fierce grin.</p>

<p>"The villages of Khuruk I burned," he said calmly. "My men need
no roofs between them and the sky. The village dogs&mdash;such as
still lived&mdash;fled into the hills. This day I was hunting some
from among the rocks, not deeming them wise enough to plant an
ambush, when they cut me off from the pass, and the rest you know.
I took refuge in the ravine. When I heard your firing I thought it
was my own men."</p>

<p>O'Donnell did not at once answer, but sat his horse, gazing
inscrutably at the fierce, scarred countenance of the Afghan. A
sidelong glance showed him the men from the tower straggling
up&mdash;some seventy of them, a wild, dissolute band, ragged and
hairy, with wolfish countenances and rifles in their hands. These
rifles were, in most cases, inferior to those carried by his own
men.</p>

<p>In a battle begun then and there, the advantage was still with
the mounted Turkomans. Then another glance showed him more men
swarming out of the pass&mdash;a hundred at least.</p>

<p>"The dogs come at last!" grunted Afzal Khan. "They have been
gorging back in the valley. I would have been vulture bait if I had
been forced to await their coming. Brother!" He strode forward to
lay his hand on O'Donnell's stirrup strap, while envy of and
admiration for the magnificent Turkish stallion burned in his
fierce eyes. "Brother, come with me to Khuruk! You have saved my
life this day, and I would reward you fittingly."</p>

<p>O'Donnell did not look at his Turkomans. He knew they were
waiting for his orders and would obey him. He could draw his pistol
and shoot Afzal Khan dead, and they could cut their way back across
the plateau in the teeth of the volleys that were sure to rake
their line of flight. Many would escape. But why escape? Afzal Khan
had every reason to show them the face of a friend, and, besides,
if he had killed Ahmed Shah, it was logical to suppose that he had
the papers without which O'Donnell dared not return to
Shahrazar.</p>

<p>"We will ride with you to Khuruk, Afzal Khan," decided
O'Donnell.</p>

<p>The Afghan combed his crimson beard with his fingers and boomed
his gratification.</p>

<p>The ragged ruffians closed in about them as they rode toward the
pass, a swarm of sheepskin coats and soiled turbans that hemmed in
the clean-cut riders in their fur caps and girdled
<i>kaftans</i>.</p>

<p>O'Donnell did not miss the envy in the glances cast at the
rifles and cartridge belts and horses of the Turkomans. Orkhan
Bahadur was generous with his men to the point of extravagance; he
had sent them out with enough ammunition to fight a small war.</p>

<p>Afzal Khan strode by O'Donnell's stirrup, booming his comments
and apparently oblivious to everything except the sound of his own
voice.</p>

<p>O'Donnell glanced from him to his followers. Afzal Khan was a
Yusufzai, a pure-bred Afghan, but his men were a motley
mob&mdash;Pathans, mostly, Orakzai, Ummer Khels, Sudozai, Afridis,
Ghilzai&mdash;outcasts and nameless men from many tribes.</p>

<p>They went through the pass&mdash;a knife-cut gash between sheer
rock walls, forty feet wide and three hundred yards long&mdash;and
beyond the tower were a score of gaunt horses which Afzal Khan and
some of his favored henchmen mounted. Then the chief gave pungent
orders to his men; fifty of them climbed into the tower and resumed
the ceaseless vigilance that is the price of life in the hills, and
the rest followed him and his guests out of the pass and along the
knife-edge trail that wound amid savage crags and jutting
spurs.</p>

<p>Afzal Khan fell silent, and indeed there was scant opportunity
for conversation, each man being occupied in keeping his horse or
his own feet on the wavering path. The surrounding crags were so
rugged and lofty that the strategic importance of the Pass of Akbar
impressed itself still more strongly on O'Donnell.</p>

<p>Only through that pass could any body of men make their way
safely. He felt uncomfortably like a man who sees a door shut
behind him, blocking his escape, and he glanced furtively at Afzal
Khan, riding with stirrups so short that he squatted like a huge
toad in his saddle. The chief seemed preoccupied; he gnawed a wisp
of his red beard and there was a blank stare in his eyes.</p>

<p>The sun was swinging low when they came to a second pass. This
was not exactly a pass at all, in the usual sense. It was an
opening in a cluster of rocky spurs that rose like fangs along the
lip of a rim beyond which the land fell away in a long gradual
sweep. Threading among these stony teeth, O'Donnell looked down
into the valley of Khuruk.</p>

<p>It was not a deep valley, but it was flanked by cliffs that
looked unscalable. It ran east and west, roughly, and they were
entering it at the eastern end. At the western end it seemed to be
blocked by a mass of crags.</p>

<p>There were no cultivated patches, or houses to be seen in the
valley&mdash;only stretches of charred ground. Evidently the
destruction of the Khurukzai villages had been thorough. In the
midst of the valley stood a square stone inclosure, with a tower at
one corner, such as are common in the hills, and serve as forts in
times of strife.</p>

<p>Divining his thought, Afzal Khan pointed to this and said: "I
struck like a thunderbolt. They had not time to take refuge in the
<i>sangar</i>. Their watchmen on the heights were careless. We
stole upon them and knifed them; then in the dawn we swept down on
the villages. Nay, some escaped. We could not slay them all. They
will keep coming back to harass me&mdash;as they have done this
day&mdash;until I hunt them down and wipe them all out."</p>

<p>O'Donnell had not mentioned the papers; to have done so would
have been foolish; he could think of no way to question Afzal Khan
without waking the Afghan's suspicions; he must await his
opportunity.</p>

<p>That opportunity came unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"Can you read <i>Urdu</i>?" asked Afzal Khan abruptly.</p>

<p>"Aye!" O'Donnell made no further comment but waited with
concealed tenseness.</p>

<p>"I cannot; nor <i>Pashtu</i>, either, for that matter," rumbled
the Afghan. "There were papers on Ahmed Shah's body, which I
believe are written in <i>Urdu</i>."</p>

<p>"I might be able to read them for you."</p>

<p>O'Donnell tried to speak casually, but perhaps he was not able
to keep his eagerness altogether out of his voice. Afzal Khan
tugged his beard, glanced at him sidewise, and changed the subject.
He spoke no more of the papers and made no move to show them to his
guest. O'Donnell silently cursed his own impatience; but at least
he had learned that the documents he sought were in the bandit's
possession, and that Afzal Khan was ignorant of their
nature&mdash;if he was not lying.</p>

<p>At a growled order all but sixty of the chief's men halted among
the spurs overlooking the valley. The rest trailed after him.</p>

<p>"They watch for the Khurukzai dogs," he explained. "There are
trails by which a few men might get through the hills, avoiding the
Pass of Akbar, and reach the head of the valley."</p>

<p>"Is this the only entrance to Khuruk?"</p>

<p>"The only one that horses can travel. There are footpaths
leading through the crags from the north and the south, but I have
men posted there as well. One rifleman can hold any one of them
forever. My forces are scattered about the valley. I am not to be
taken by surprise as I took Ahmed Shah."</p>

<p>The sun was sinking behind the western hills as they rode down
the valley, tailed by the men on foot. All were strangely silent,
as if oppressed by the silence of the plundered valley. Their
destination evidently was the inclosure, which stood perhaps a mile
from the head of the valley. The valley floor was unusually free of
boulders and stones, except a broken ledge like a reef that ran
across the valley several hundred yards east of the fortalice.
Halfway between these rocks and the inclosure, Afzal Khan
halted.</p>

<p>"Camp here!" he said abruptly, with a tone more of command than
invitation. "My men and I occupy the <i>sangar</i>, and it is well
to keep our wolves somewhat apart. There is a place where your
horses can be stabled, where there is plenty of fodder stored." He
pointed out a stone-walled pen of considerable dimensions a few
hundred yards away, near the southern cliffs. "Hungry wolves come
down from the gorges and attack the horses."</p>

<p>"We will camp beside the pen," said O'Donnell, preferring to be
closer to their mounts.</p>

<p>Afzal Khan showed a flash of irritation. "Do you wish to be shot
in the dark for an enemy?" he growled. "Pitch your tents where I
bid you. I have told my men at the pass where you will camp, and if
any of them come down the valley in the dark, and hear men where no
men are supposed to be, they will shoot first and investigate
later. Beside, the Khurukzai dogs, if they creep upon the crags and
see men sleeping beneath them, will roll down boulders and crush
you like insects."</p>

<p>This seemed reasonable enough, and O'Donnell had no wish to
antagonize Afzal Khan. The Afghan's attitude seemed a mixture of
his natural domineering arrogance and an effort at geniality. This
was what might be expected, considering both the man's nature and
his present obligation. O'Donnell believed that Afzal Khan
begrudged the obligation, but recognized it.</p>

<p>"We have no tents," answered the American. "We need none. We
sleep in our cloaks." And he ordered his men to dismount at the
spot designated by the chief. They at once unsaddled and led their
horses to the pen, where, as the Afghan had declared, there was an
abundance of fodder.</p>

<p>O'Donnell told off five men to guard them. Not, he hastened to
explain to the frowning chief, that they feared human thieves, but
there were the wolves to be considered. Afzal Khan grunted and
turned his own sorry steeds into the pen, growling in his beard at
the contrast they made alongside the Turkish horses.</p>

<p>His men showed no disposition to fraternize with the Turkomans;
they entered the inclosure and presently the smoke of cooking fires
arose. O'Donnell's own men set about preparing their scanty meal,
and Afzal Khan came and stood over them, combing his crimson beard
that the firelight turned to blood. The jeweled hilts of his knives
gleamed in the glow, and his eyes burned red like the eyes of a
hawk.</p>

<p>"Our fare is poor," he said abruptly. "Those Khurukzai dogs
burned their own huts and food stores when they fled before us. We
are half starved. I can offer you no food, though you are my
guests. But there is a well in the <i>sangar</i>, and I have sent
some of my men to fetch some steers we have in a pen outside the
valley. Tomorrow we shall all feast full, <i>inshallah</i>!"</p>

<p>O'Donnell murmured a polite response, but he was conscious of a
vague uneasiness. Afzal Khan was acting in a most curious manner,
even for a bandit who trampled all laws and customs of conventional
conduct. He gave them orders one instant and almost apologized for
them in the next.</p>

<p>The matter of designating the camp site sounded almost as if
they were prisoners, yet he had made no attempt to disarm them. His
men were sullen and silent, even for bandits. But he had no reason
to be hostile toward his guests, and, even if he had, why had he
brought them to Khuruk when he could have wiped them out up in the
hills just as easily?</p>

<p>"Ali el Ghazi," Afzal Khan suddenly repeated the name.
"Wherefore Ghazi? What infidel didst thou slay to earn the
name?"</p>

<p>"The Russian, Colonel Ivan Kurovitch." O'Donnell spoke no lie
there. As Ali el Ghazi, a Kurd, he was known as the slayer of
Kurovitch; the duel had occurred in one of the myriad nameless
skirmishes along the border.</p>

<p>Afzal Khan meditated this matter for a few minutes. The
firelight cast part of his features in shadow, making his
expression seem even more sinister than usual. He loomed in the
firelit shadows like a somber monster weighing the doom of men.
Then with a grunt he turned and strode away toward the
<i>sangar</i>.</p>

<h2><a id="swords3" name="swords3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">NIGHT HAD FALLEN. Wind moaned among the
crags. Cloud masses moved across the dark vault of the night,
obscuring the stars which blinked here and there, were blotted out
and then reappeared, like chill points of frosty silver. The
Turkomans squatted silently about their tiny fires, casting furtive
glances over their shoulders.</p>

<p>Men of the deserts, the brooding grimness of the dark mountains
daunted them; the night pressing down in the bowl of the valley
dwarfed them in its immensity. They shivered at the wailing of the
wind, and peered fearfully into the darkness, where, according to
their superstitions, the ghosts of murdered men roamed ghoulishly.
They stared bleakly at O'Donnell, in the grip of fear and
paralyzing fatalism.</p>

<p>The grimness and desolation of the night had its effect on the
American. A foreboding of disaster oppressed him. There was
something about Afzal Khan he could not fathom&mdash;something
unpredictable.</p>

<p>The man had lived too long outside the bounds of ordinary
humanity to be judged by the standards of common men. In his
present state of mind the bandit chief assumed monstrous
proportions, like an ogre out of a fable.</p>

<p>O'Donnell shook himself angrily. Afzal Khan was only a man, who
would die if bitten by lead or steel, like any other man. As for
treachery, what would be the motive? Yet the foreboding
remained.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow we will feast," he told his men. "Afzal Khan has said
it."</p>

<p>They stared at him somberly, with the instincts of the black
forests and the haunted steppes in their eyes which gleamed
wolfishly in the firelight.</p>

<p>"The dead feast not," muttered one of them.</p>

<p>"What talk is this?" rebuked O'Donnell. "We are living men, not
dead."</p>

<p>"We have not eaten salt with Afzal Khan," replied the Turkoman.
"We camp here in the open, hemmed in by his slayers on either hand.
Aie, we are already dead men. We are sheep led to the butcher."</p>

<p>O'Donnell stared hard at his men, startled at their voicing the
vague fears that troubled him. There was no accusation of his
leadership in their voices. They merely spoke their beliefs in a
detached way that belied the fear in their eyes. They believed they
were to die, and he was beginning to believe they were right. The
fires were dying down, and there was no more fuel to build them up.
Some of the men wrapped themselves in their cloaks and lay down on
the hard ground. Others remained sitting cross-legged on their
saddle cloths, their heads bent on their breasts.</p>

<p>O'Donnell rose and walked toward the first outcropping of the
rocks, where he turned and stared back at the inclosure. The fires
had died down there to a glow. No sound came from the sullen walls.
A mental picture formed itself in his mind, resultant from his
visit to the redoubt for water.</p>

<p>It was a bare wall inclosing a square space. At the northwest
corner rose a tower. At the southwest corner there was a well. Once
a tower had protected the well, but now it was fallen into ruins,
so that only a hint of it remained. There was nothing else in the
inclosure except a small stone hut with a thatched roof. What was
in the hut he had no way of knowing. Afzal Khan had remarked that
he slept alone in the tower. The chief did not trust his own men
too far.</p>

<p>What was Afzal Khan's game? He was not dealing straight with
O'Donnell; that was obvious. Some of his evasions and pretenses
were transparent; the man was not as clever as one might suppose;
he was more like a bull that wins by ferocious charges.</p>

<p>But why should he practice deception? What had he to gain?
O'Donnell had smelled meat cooking in the fortalice. There was food
in the valley, then, but for some reason the Afghan had denied it.
The Turkomans knew that; to them it logically suggested but one
thing&mdash;he would not share the salt with men he intended to
murder. But again, why?</p>

<p>"<i>Ohai</i>, Ali el Ghazi!"</p>

<p>At that hiss out of the darkness, O'Donnell wheeled, his big
pistol jumping into his hand, his skin prickling. He strained his
eyes, but saw nothing; heard only the muttering of the night
wind.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he demanded guardedly. "Who calls?"</p>

<p>"A friend! Hold your fire!"</p>

<p>O'Donnell saw a more solid shadow detach itself from the rocks
and move toward him. With his thumb pressing back the fanged hammer
of his pistol, he shoved the muzzle against the man's belly and
leaned forward to glare into the hairy face in the dim, uncertain
starlight. Even so the darkness was so thick the fellow's features
were only a blur.</p>

<p>"Do you not know me?" whispered the man, and by his accent
O'Donnell knew him for a Waziri. "I am Yar Muhammad!"</p>

<p>"Yar Muhammad!" Instantly the gun went out of sight and
O'Donnell's hand fell on the other's bull-like shoulder. "What do
you in this den of thieves?"</p>

<p>The man's teeth glimmered in the tangle of his beard as he
grinned. <i>"Mashallah</i>! Am I not a thief, El Shirkuh?" he
asked, giving O'Donnell the name by which the American, in his
rightful person, was known to the Moslems. "Hast thou forgotten the
old days? Even now the British would hang me, if they could catch
me. But no matter. I was one of those who watch the paths in the
hills.</p>

<p>"An hour ago I was relieved, and when I returned to the
<i>sangar</i> I heard men talking of the Turkomans who camped in
the valley outside, and it was said their chief was the Kurd who
slew the infidel Kurovitch. So I knew it was El Shirkuh playing
with doom again. Art thou mad, sahib? Death spreads his wings above
thee and all thy men. Afzal Khan plots that thou seest no other
sunrise."</p>

<p>"I was suspicious of him," muttered the American. "In the matter
of food&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The hut in the inclosure is full of food. Why waste beef and
bread on dead men? Food is scarce enough in these hills&mdash;and
at dawn you die."</p>

<p>"But why? We saved Afzal Khan's life, and there is no
feud&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Jhelum will flow backward when Afzal Khan spares a man
because of gratitude," muttered Yar Muhammad.</p>

<p>"But for what reason?"</p>

<p>"By Allah, sahib, are you blind? Reason? Are not fifty Turkish
steeds reason enough? Are not fifty rifles with cartridges reason
enough? In these hills firearms and cartridges are worth their
weight in silver, and a man will murder his brother for a
matchlock. Afzal Khan is a robber, and he covets what you
possess.</p>

<p>"These weapons and these horses would lend him great strength.
He is ambitious. He would draw to him many more men, make himself
strong enough at last to dispute the rule of these hills with
Orkhan Bahadur. Nay, he plots some day to take Shahrazar from the
Turkoman as he in his turn took it from the Uzbeks. What is the
goal of every bandit in these hills, rich or poor?
<i>Mashallah!</i> The treasure of Khuwarezm!"</p>

<p>O'Donnell was silent, visualizing that accursed hoard as a
monstrous loadstone drawing all the evil passions of men from near
lands and far. Now it was but an empty shadow men coveted, but they
could not know it, and its evil power was as great as ever. He felt
an insane desire to laugh.</p>

<p>The wind moaned in the dark, and Yar Muhammad's muttering voice
merged eerily with it, unintelligible a yard away.</p>

<p>"Afzal Khan feels no obligation toward you, because you thought
it was Ahmed Shah you were aiding. He did not attack you at the
Pass because he knew you would slay many of his men, and he feared
lest the horses take harm in the battle. Now he has you in a trap
as he planned. Sixty men inside the <i>sangar;</i> a hundred more
at the head of the valley. A short time before moonrise, the men
among the spurs will creep down the valley and take position among
these rocks. Then when the moon is well risen, so that a man may
aim, they will rake you with rifle fire.</p>

<p>"Most of the Turkomans will die in their sleep, and such as live
and seek to flee in the other direction will be shot by the men in
the inclosure. These sleep now, but sentries keep watch. I slipped
out over the western side and have been lying here wondering how to
approach your camp without being shot for a prowler.</p>

<p>"Afzal Khan has plotted well. He has you in the perfect trap,
with the horses well out of the range of the bullets that will slay
their riders."</p>

<p>"So," murmured O'Donnell. "And what is your plan?"</p>

<p>"Plan? Allah, when did I ever have a plan? Nay, that is for you!
I know these hills, and I can shoot straight and strike a good
blow." His yard-long Khyber knife thrummed as he swung it through
the air. "But I only follow where wiser men lead. I heard the men
talk, and I came to warn you, because once you turned an Afridi
blade from my breast, and again you broke the lock on the Peshawar
jail where I lay moaning for the hills!"</p>

<p>O'Donnell did not express his gratitude; that was not necessary.
But he was conscious of a warm glow toward the hairy ruffian. Man's
treachery is balanced by man's loyalty, at least in the barbaric
hills where civilized sophistry has not crept in with its cult of
time-serving.</p>

<p>"Can you guide us through the mountains?" asked O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"Nay, sahib; the horses cannot follow these paths; and these
booted Turks would die on foot."</p>

<p>"It is nearly two hours yet until moonrise," O'Donnell muttered.
"To saddle horses now would be to betray us. Some of us might get
away in the darkness, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was thinking of the papers that were the price of his life;
but it was not altogether that. Flight in the darkness would mean
scattered forces, even though they cut their way out of the valley.
Without his guidance the Turkomans would be hopelessly lost; such
as were separated from the main command would perish miserably.</p>

<p>"Come with me," he said at last, and hurried back to the men who
lay about the charring embers.</p>

<p>At his whisper they rose like ghouls out of the blackness and
clustered about him, muttering like suspicious dogs at the Waziri.
O'Donnell could scarcely make out the hawklike faces that pressed
close about him. All the stars were hidden by dank clouds. The
fortalice was but a shapeless bulk in the darkness, and the
flanking mountains were masses of solid blackness. The whining wind
drowned voices a few yards away.</p>

<p>"Hearken and speak not," O'Donnell ordered. "This is Yar
Muhammad, a friend and a true man. We are betrayed. Afzal Khan is a
dog, who will slay us for our horses. Nay, listen! In the
<i>sangar</i> there is a thatched hut. I am going into the
inclosure and fire that thatch. When you see the blaze, and hear my
pistol speak, rush the wall. Some of you will die, but the surprise
will be on our side. We must take the <i>sangar</i> and hold it
against the men who will come down the valley at moonrise. It is a
desperate plan, but the best that offers itself."</p>

<p><i>"Bismillah!"</i> they murmured softly, and he heard the rasp
of blades clearing their scabbards.</p>

<p>"This is work indeed for cold steel," he said. "You must rush
the wall and swarm it while the Pathans are dazed with surprise.
Send one man for the warriors at the horse pen. Be of good heart;
the rest is on Allah's lap."</p>

<p>As he crept away in the darkness, with Yar Muhammad following
him like a bent shadow, O'Donnell was aware that the attitude of
the Turkomans had changed; they had wakened out of their fatalistic
lethargy into fierce tension.</p>

<p>"If I fall," O'Donnell murmured, "will you guide these men back
to Shahrazar? Orkhan Bahadur will reward you."</p>

<p>"Shaitan eat Orkhan Bahadur," answered Yar Muhammad. "What care
I for these <i>Turki</i> dogs? It is you, not they, for whom I risk
my skin."</p>

<p>O'Donnell had given the Waziri his rifle. They swung around the
south side of the inclosure, almost crawling on their bellies. No
sound came from the breastwork, no light showed. O'Donnell knew
that they were invisible to whatever eyes were straining into the
darkness along the wall. Circling wide, they approached the
unguarded western wall.</p>

<p>"Afzal Khan sleeps in the tower," muttered Yar Muhammad, his
lips close to O'Donnell's ear. "Sleeps or pretends to sleep. The
men slumber beneath the eastern wall. All the sentries lurk on that
side, trying to watch the Turkomans. They have allowed the fires to
die, to lull suspicion."</p>

<p>"Over the wall, then," whispered O'Donnell, rising and gripping
the coping. He glided over with no more noise than the wind in the
dry tamarisk, and Yar Muhammad followed him as silently. He stood
in the thicker shadow of the wall, placing everything in his mind
before he moved.</p>

<p>The hut was before him, a blob of blackness. It looked eastward
and was closer to the west wall than to the other. Near it a
cluster of dying coals glowed redly. There was no light in the
tower, in the northwest angle of the wall.</p>

<p>Bidding Yar Muhammad remain near the wall, O'Donnell stole
toward the embers. When he reached them he could make out the forms
of the men sleeping between the hut and the east wall. It was like
these hardened killers to sleep at such a time. Why not? At the
word of their master they would rise and slay. Until the time came
it was good to sleep. O'Donnell himself had slept, and eaten, too,
among the corpses of a battlefield.</p>

<p>Dim figures along the wall were sentinels. They did not turn;
motionless as statues they leaned on the wall staring into the
darkness out of which, in the hills, anything might come.</p>

<p>There was a half-burned fagot lying in the embers, one end a
charring stump which glowed redly. O'Donnell reached out and
secured it. Yar Muhammad, watching from the wall, shivered though
he knew what it was. It was as if a detached hand had appeared for
an instant in the dim glow and then disappeared, and then a red
point moved toward him.</p>

<p>"Allah!" swore the Waziri. "This blackness is that of
Jehannum!"</p>

<p>"Softly!" O'Donnell whispered at him from the pit darkness. "Be
ready; now is the beginning of happenings."</p>

<p>The ember glowed and smoked as he blew cautiously upon it. A
tiny tongue of flame grew, licking at the wood.</p>

<p>"Commend thyself to Allah!" said O'Donnell, and whirling the
brand in a flaming wheel about his head, he cast it into the thatch
of the hut.</p>

<p>There was a tense instant in which a tongue of flame flickered
and crackled, and then in one hungry combustion the dry stuff
leaped ablaze, and the figures of men started out of blank
blackness with startling clarity. The guards wheeled, their stupid
astonishment etched in the glare, and men sat up in their cloaks on
the ground, gaping bewilderedly.</p>

<p>And O'Donnell yelled like a hungry wolf and began jerking the
trigger of his pistol.</p>

<p>A sentinel spun on his heel and crumpled, discharging his rifle
wildly in the air. Others were howling and staggering like drunken
men, reeling and falling in the lurid glare. Yar Muhammad was
blazing away with O'Donnell's rifle, shooting down his former
companions as cheerfully as if they were ancient enemies.</p>

<p>A matter of seconds elapsed between the time the blaze sprang up
and the time when the men were scurrying about wildly, etched in
the merciless light and unable to see the two men who crouched in
the shadow of the far wall, raining them with lead. But in that
scant instant there came another sound&mdash;a swift thudding of
feet, the daunting sound of men rushing through the darkness in
desperate haste and desperate silence.</p>

<p>Some of the Pathans heard it and turned to glare into the night.
The fire behind them rendered the outer darkness more impenetrable.
They could not see the death that was racing fleetly toward them,
until the charge reached the wall.</p>

<p>Then a yell of terror went up as the men along the wall caught a
glimpse of glittering eyes and flickering steel rushing out of the
blackness. They fired one wild, ragged volley, and then the
Turkomans surged up over the wall in an irresistible wave and were
slashing and hacking like madmen among the defenders.</p>

<p>Scarcely wakened, demoralized by the surprise, and by the
bullets that cut them down from behind, the Pathans were beaten
almost before the fight began. Some of them fled over the wall
without any attempt at defense, but some fought, snarling and
stabbing like wolves. The blazing thatch etched the scene in a
lurid glare. <i>Kalpaks</i> mingled with turbans, and steel
flickered over the seething mob. Yataghans grated against tulwars,
and blood spurted.</p>

<p>His pistol empty, O'Donnell ran toward the tower. He had
momentarily expected Afzal Khan to appear. But in such moments it
is impossible to retain a proper estimate of time. A minute may
seem like an hour, an hour like a minute. In reality, the Afghan
chief came storming out of the tower just as the Turkomans came
surging over the wall. Perhaps he had really been asleep, or
perhaps caution kept him from rushing out sooner. Gunfire might
mean rebellion against his authority.</p>

<p>At any rate he came roaring like a wounded bull, a rifle in his
hands. O'Donnell rushed toward him, but the Afghan glared beyond
him to where his swordsmen were falling like wheat under the blades
of the maddened Turkomans. He saw the fight was already lost, as
far as the men in the inclosure were concerned, and he sprang for
the nearest wall.</p>

<p>O'Donnell raced to pull him down, but Afzal Khan, wheeling,
fired from the hip. The American felt a heavy blow in his belly,
and then he was down on the ground, with all the breath gone from
him. Afzal Khan yelled in triumph, brandished his rifle, and was
gone over the wall, heedless of the vengeful bullet Yar Muhammad
sped after him.</p>

<p>The Waziri had followed O'Donnell across the inclosure and now
he knelt beside him, yammering as he fumbled to find the American's
wound.</p>

<p>"Aie!" he bawled. "He is slain! My friend and brother! Where
will his like be found again? Slain by the bullet of a hillman!
Aie! Aie! Aie!"</p>

<p>"Cease thy bellowing, thou great ox," gasped O'Donnell, sitting
up and shaking off the frantic hands. "I am unhurt."</p>

<p>Yar Muhammad yelled with surprise and relief. "But the bullet,
brother? He fired at point-blank range!"</p>

<p>"It hit my belt buckle," grunted O'Donnell, feeling the heavy
gold buckle, which was bent and dented. "By Allah, the slug drove
it into my belly. It was like being hit with a sledge hammer. Where
is Afzal Khan?"</p>

<p>"Fled away in the darkness."</p>

<p>O'Donnell rose and turned his attention to the fighting. It was
practically over. The remnants of the Pathans were fleeing over the
wall, harried by the triumphant Turkomans, who in victory were no
more merciful than the average Oriental. The <i>sangar</i> looked
like a shambles.</p>

<p>The hut still blazed brightly, and O'Donnell knew that the
contents had been ignited. What had been an advantage was now a
danger, for the men at the head of the valley would be coming at
full run, and in the light of the fire they could pick off the
Turkomans from the darkness. He ran forward shouting orders, and
setting an example of action.</p>

<p>Men began filling vessels&mdash;cooking pots, gourds, even
<i>kalpaks</i> from the well and casting the water on the fire.
O'Donnell burst in the door and began to drag out the contents of
the huts, foods mostly, some of it brightly ablaze, to be
doused.</p>

<p>Working as only men in danger of death can work, they
extinguished the flame and darkness fell again over the fortress.
But over the eastern crags a faint glow announced the rising of the
moon through the breaking clouds.</p>

<p>Then followed a tense period of waiting, in which the Turkomans
hugged their rifles and crouched along the wall, staring into the
darkness as the Pathans had done only a short time before. Seven of
them had been killed in the fighting and lay with the wounded
beside the well. The bodies of the slain Pathans had been
unceremoniously heaved over the wall.</p>

<p>The men at the valley head could not have been on their way down
the valley when the fighting broke out, and they must have
hesitated before starting, uncertain as to what the racket meant.
But they were on their way at last, and Afzal Khan was trying to
establish a contact with them.</p>

<p>The wind brought snatches of shouts down the valley, and a
rattle of shots that hinted at hysteria. These were followed by a
furious bellowing which indicated that Afzal Khan's demoralized
warriors had nearly shot their chief in the dark. The moon broke
through the clouds and disclosed a straggling mob of men
gesticulating wildly this side of the rocks to the east.</p>

<p>O'Donnell even made out Afzal Khan's bulk and, snatching a rifle
from a warrior's hand, tried a long shot. He missed in the
uncertain light, but his warriors poured a blast of lead into the
thick of their enemies which accounted for a man or so and sent the
others leaping for cover. From the reeflike rocks they began firing
at the wall, knocking off chips of stone but otherwise doing no
damage.</p>

<p>With his enemies definitely located, O'Donnell felt more at
ease. Taking a torch he went to the tower, with Yar Muhammad
hanging at his heels like a faithful ghoul. In the tower were
heaped odds and ends of plunder&mdash;saddles, bridles, garments,
blankets, food, weapons&mdash;but O'Donnell did not find what he
sought, though he tore the place to pieces. Yar Muhammad squatted
in the doorway, with his rifle across his knees, and watched him,
it never occurring to the Waziri to inquire what his friend was
searching for.</p>

<p>At length O'Donnell paused, sweating from the vigor of his
efforts&mdash;for he had concentrated much exertion in a few
minutes&mdash;and swore.</p>

<p>"Where <i>does</i> the dog keep those papers?"</p>

<p>"The papers he took from Ahmed Shah?" inquired Yar Muhammad.
"Those he always carries in his girdle. He cannot read them, but he
believes they are valuable. Men say Ahmed Shah had them from a
<i>Feringi</i> who died."</p>

<h2><a id="swords4" name="swords4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">DAWN WAS LIFTING over the valley of
Khuruk. The sun that was not yet visible above the rim of the hills
turned the white peaks to pulsing fire. But down in the valley
there was none who found time to wonder at the changeless miracle
of the mountain dawn. The cliffs rang with the flat echoes of rifle
shots, and wisps of smoke drifted bluely into the air. Lead spanged
on stone and whined venomously off into space, or thudded
sickeningly into quivering flesh. Men howled blasphemously and
fouled the morning with their frantic curses.</p>

<p>O'Donnell crouched at a loophole, staring at the rocks whence
came puffs of white smoke and singing harbingers of death. His
rifle barrel was hot to his hand, and a dozen yards from the wall
lay a huddle of white-clad figures.</p>

<p>Since the first hint of light the wolves of Afzal Khan had
poured lead into the fortalice from the reeflike ledge that broke
the valley floor. Three times they had broken cover and charged,
only to fall back beneath the merciless fire that raked them.
Hopelessly outnumbered, the advantage of weapons and position
counted heavily for the Turkomans.</p>

<p>O'Donnell had stationed five of the best marksmen in the tower
and the rest held the walls. To reach the inclosure meant charging
across several hundred yards of open space, devoid of cover. All
the outlaws were still among the rocks east of the <i>sangar</i>,
where, indeed, the broken ledge offered the only cover within rifle
range of the redoubt.</p>

<p>The Pathans had suffered savagely in the charges, and they had
had the worst of the long-range exchanges, both their marksmanship
and their weapons being inferior to the Turkomans'. But some of
their bullets did find their way through the loopholes. A few yards
from O'Donnell a <i>kaftaned</i> rider lay in a grotesque huddle,
his feet turned so the growing light glinted on his silver boot
heels, his head a smear of blood and brains.</p>

<p>Another lay sprawled near the charred hut, his ghastly face
frozen in a grin of agony as he chewed spasmodically on a bullet.
He had been shot in the belly and was taking a long time in dying,
but not a whimper escaped his livid lips.</p>

<p>A fellow with a bullet hole in his forearm was making more
racket; his curses, as a comrade probed for the slug with a dagger
point, would have curdled the blood of a devil.</p>

<p>O'Donnell glanced up at the tower, whence wisps of smoke
drifting told him that his five snipers were alert. Their range was
greater than that of the men at the wall, and they did more damage
proportionately and were better protected. Again and again they had
broken up attempts to get at the horses in the stone pen. This pen
was nearer the inclosure than it was to the rocks, and crumpled
shapes on the ground showed of vain attempts to reach it.</p>

<p>But O'Donnell shook his head. They had salvaged a large quantity
of food from the burning hut; there was a well of good water; they
had better weapons and more ammunition than the men outside. But a
long siege meant annihilation.</p>

<p>One of the men wounded in the night fighting had died. There
remained alive forty-one men of the fifty with which he had left
Shahrazar. One of these was dying, and half a dozen were
wounded&mdash;one probably fatally. There were at least a hundred
and fifty men outside.</p>

<p>Afzal Khan could not storm the walls yet. But under the constant
toll of the bullets, the small force of the defenders would melt
away. If any of them lived and escaped, O'Donnell knew it could be
only by a swift, bold stroke. But he had no plan at all.</p>

<p>The firing from the valley ceased suddenly, and a white turban
cloth was waved above the rock on a rifle muzzle.</p>

<p>"<i>Ohai</i>, Ali el Ghazi!" came a hail in a bull's roar that
could only have issued from Afzal Khan.</p>

<p>Yar Muhammad, squatting beside O'Donnell, sneered. "A trick!
Keep thy head below the parapet, sahib. Trust Afzal Khan when
wolves knock out their own teeth."</p>

<p>"Hold your fire, Ali el Ghazi!" boomed the distant voice. "I
would parley with you!"</p>

<p>"Show yourself!" O'Donnell yelled back.</p>

<p>And without hesitation a huge bulk loomed up among the rocks.
Whatever his own perfidy, Afzal Khan trusted the honor of the man
he thought a Kurd. He lifted his hands to show they were empty.</p>

<p>"Advance, alone!" yelled O'Donnell, straining to make himself
heard.</p>

<p>Someone thrust the butt of a rifle into a crevice of the rocks
so it stood muzzle upward, with the white cloth blowing out in the
morning breeze, and Afzal Khan came striding over the stones with
the arrogance of a sultan. Behind him turbans were poked up above
the boulders.</p>

<p>O'Donnell halted him within good earshot, and instantly he was
covered by a score of rifles. Afzal Khan did not seem to be
disturbed by that, or by the blood lust in the dark hawklike faces
glaring along the barrels. Then O'Donnell rose into view, and the
two leaders faced one another in the full dawn.</p>

<p>O'Donnell expected accusations of treachery&mdash;for, after
all, he had struck the first blow&mdash;but Afzal Khan was too
brutally candid for such hypocrisy.</p>

<p>"I have you in a vise, Ali el Ghazi," he announced without
preamble. "But for that Waziri dog who crouches behind you, I would
have cut your throat at moonrise last night. You are all dead men,
but this siege work grows tiresome, and I am willing to forgo half
my advantage. I am generous. As reward of victory I demand either
your guns or your horses. Your horses I have already, but you shall
have them back, if you wish. Throw down your weapons and you may
ride out of Khuruk. Or, if you wish, I will keep the horses, and
you may march out on foot with your rifles. What is your
answer?"</p>

<p>O'Donnell spat toward him with a typically Kurdish gesture. "Are
we fools, to be hoodwinked by a dog with scarlet whiskers?" he
snarled. "When Afzal Khan keeps his sworn word, the Indus will flow
backward. Shall we ride out, unarmed, for you to cut us down in the
passes, or shall we march forth on foot, for you to shoot us from
ambush in the hills?</p>

<p>"You lie when you say you have our horses. Ten of your men have
died trying to take them for you. You lie when you say you have us
in the vise. It is <i>you</i> who are in the vise! You have neither
food nor water; there is no other well in the valley but this. You
have few cartridges, because most of your ammunition is stored in
the tower, and <i>we</i> hold that."</p>

<p>The fury in Afzal Khan's countenance told O'Donnell that he had
scored with that shot.</p>

<p>"If you had us helpless you would not be offering terms,"
O'Donnell sneered. "You would be cutting our throats, instead of
trying to gull us into the open."</p>

<p>"Sons of sixty dogs!" swore Afzal Khan, plucking at his beard.
"I will flay you all alive! I will keep you hemmed here until you
die!"</p>

<p>"If we cannot leave the fortress, you cannot enter it,"
O'Donnell retorted. "Moreover you have drawn all your men but a
handful from the passes, and the Khurukzai will steal upon you and
cut off your heads. They are waiting, up in the hills."</p>

<p>Afzal Khan's involuntarily wry face told O'Donnell that the
Afghan's plight was more desperate than he had hoped.</p>

<p>"It is a deadlock, Afzal Khan," said O'Donnell suddenly.</p>

<p>"There is but one way to break it." He lifted his voice, seeing
that the Pathans under the protection of the truce were leaving
their coverts and drawing within earshot. "Meet me there in the
open space, man to man, and decide the feud between us two, with
cold steel. If I win, we ride out of Khuruk unmolested. If you win,
my warriors are at your mercy."</p>

<p>"The mercy of a wolf!" muttered Yar Muhammad.</p>

<p>O'Donnell did not reply. It was a desperate chance, but the only
one. Afzal Khan hesitated and cast a searching glance at his men;
that scowling hairy horde was muttering among itself. The warriors
seemed ill-content, and they stared meaningly at their leader.</p>

<p>The inference was plain; they were weary of the fighting at
which they were at a disadvantage, and they wished Afzal Khan to
accept O'Donnell's challenge. They feared a return of the Khurukzai
might catch them in the open with empty cartridge pouches. After
all, if their chief lost to the Kurd, they would only lose the loot
they had expected to win. Afzal Khan understood this attitude, and
his beard bristled to the upsurging of his ready passion.</p>

<p>"Agreed!" he roared, tearing out his tulwar and throwing away
the scabbard. He made the bright broad steel thrum about his head.
"Come over the wall and die, thou slayer of infidels!"</p>

<p>"Hold your men where they are!" O'Donnell ordered and vaulted
the parapet.</p>

<p>At a bellowed order the Pathans had halted, and the wall was
lined with <i>kalpaks</i> as the Turkomans watched tensely, muzzles
turned upward but fingers still crooked on the triggers. Yar
Muhammad followed O'Donnell over the wall, but did not advance from
it; he crouched against it like a bearded ghoul, fingering his
knife.</p>

<p>O'Donnell wasted no time. Scimitar in one hand and
<i>kindhjal</i> in the other, he ran lightly toward the burly
figure advancing to meet him. O'Donnell was slightly above medium
height, but Afzal Khan towered half a head above him. The Afghan's
bull-like shoulders and muscular bulk contrasted with the rangy
figure of the false Kurd; but O'Donnell's sinews were like steel
wires. His Arab scimitar, though neither so broad nor so heavy as
the tulwar, was fully as long, and the blade was of unbreakable
Damascus steel.</p>

<p>The men seemed scarcely within arm's reach when the fight opened
with a dazzling crackle and flash of steel. Blow followed blow so
swiftly that the men watching, trained to arms since birth, could
scarcely follow the strokes. Afzal Khan roared, his eyes blazing,
his beard bristling, and wielding the heavy tulwar as one might
wield a camel wand, he flailed away in a frenzy.</p>

<p>But always the scimitar flickered before him, turning the
furious blows, or the slim figure of the false Kurd avoided death
by the slightest margins, with supple twists and swayings. The
scimitar bent beneath the weight of the tulwar, but it did not
break; like a serpent's tongue it always snapped straight again,
and like a serpent's tongue it flickered at Afzal Khan's breast,
his throat, his groin, a constant threat of death that reddened the
Afghan's eyes with a tinge akin to madness.</p>

<p>Afzal Khan was a famed swordsman, and his sheer brute strength
was more than a man's. But O'Donnell's balance and economy of
motion was a marvel to witness. He never set a foot wrong or made a
false motion; he was always poised, always a threat, even in
retreat, beaten backward by the bull-like rushes of the Afghan.
Blood trickled down his face where a furious stroke, beating down
his blade, had bitten through his silk turban and into the scalp,
but the flame in his blue eyes never altered.</p>

<p>Afzal Khan was bleeding, too. O'Donnell's point, barely missing
his jugular, had plowed through his beard and along his jaw. Blood
dripping from his beard made his aspect more fearsome than ever. He
roared and flailed, until it seemed that the fury of his onslaught
would overbalance O'Donnell's perfect mastery of himself and his
blade.</p>

<p>Few noticed, however, that O'Donnell had been working his way in
closer and closer under the sweep of the tulwar. Now he caught a
furious swipe near the hilt and the <i>kindhjal</i> in his left
hand licked in and out. Afzal Khan's bellow caught in a gasp. There
was but that fleeting instant of contact, so brief it was like a
blur of movement, and then O'Donnell, at arm's length again, was
slashing and parrying, but now there was a thread of crimson on the
narrow <i>kindhjal</i> blade, and blood was seeping in a steady
stream through Afzal Khan's broad girdle.</p>

<p>There was the pain and desperation of the damned in the Afghan's
eyes, in his roaring voice. He began to weave drunkenly, but he
attacked more madly than ever, like a man fighting against
time.</p>

<p>His strokes ribboned the air with bright steel and thrummed past
O'Donnell's ears like a wind of death, until the tulwar rang full
against the scimitar's guard with hurricane force and O'Donnell
went to his knee under the impact. "Kurdish dog!" It was a gasp of
frenzied triumph. Up flashed the tulwar and the watching hordes
gave tongue. But again the <i>kindhjal</i> licked out like a
serpent's tongue&mdash;outward and upward.</p>

<p>The stroke was meant for the Afghan's groin, but a shift of his
legs at the instant caused the keen blade to plow through his thigh
instead, slicing veins and tendons. He lurched sidewise, throwing
out his arm to balance himself. And even before men knew whether he
would fall or not, O'Donnell was on his feet and slashed with the
scimitar at his head.</p>

<p>Afzal Khan fell as a tree falls, blood gushing from his head.
Even so, the terrible vitality of the man clung to life and hate.
The tulwar fell from his hand, but, catching himself on his knees,
he plucked a knife from his girdle; his hand went back for the
throw&mdash;then the knife slipped from his nerveless fingers and
he crumpled to the earth and lay still.</p>

<p>There was silence, broken by a strident yell from the Turkomans.
O'Donnell sheathed his scimitar, sprang swiftly to the fallen giant
and thrust a hand into his blood-soaked girdle. His fingers closed
on what he had hoped to find, and he drew forth an oilskin-bound
packet of papers. A low cry of satisfaction escaped his lips.</p>

<p>In the tense excitement of the fight, neither he nor the
Turkomans had noticed that the Pathans had drawn nearer and nearer,
until they stood in a ragged semicircle only a few yards away. Now,
as O'Donnell stood staring at the packet, a hairy ruffian ran at
his back, knife lifted.</p>

<p>A frantic yell from Yar Muhammad warned O'Donnell. There was no
time to turn; sensing rather than seeing his assailant, the
American ducked deeply and the knife flashed past his ear, the
muscular forearm falling on his shoulder with such force that again
he was knocked to his knees.</p>

<p>Before the man could strike again Yar Muhammad's yard-long knife
was driven into his breast with such fury that the point sprang out
between his shoulder blades. Wrenching his blade free as the wretch
fell, the Waziri grabbed a handful of O'Donnell's garments and
began to drag him toward the wall, yelling like a madman.</p>

<p>It had all happened in a dizzying instant, the charge of the
Pathan, Yar Muhammad's leap and retreat. The other Pathans rushed
in, howling like wolves, and the Waziri's blade made a fan of steel
about him and O'Donnell. Blades were flashing on all sides;
O'Donnell was cursing like a madman as he strove to halt Yar
Muhammad's headlong progress long enough to get to his feet, which
was impossible at the rate he was being yanked along.</p>

<p>All he could see was hairy legs, and all he could hear was a
devil's din of yells and clanging knives. He hewed sidewise at the
legs and men howled, and then there was a deafening reverberation,
and a blast of lead at close range smote the attackers and mowed
them down like wheat. The Turkomans had woken up and gone into
action.</p>

<p>Yar Muhammad was berserk. With his knife dripping red and his
eyes blazing madly he swarmed over the wall and down on the other
side, all asprawl, lugging O'Donnell like a sack of grain, and
still unaware that his friend was not fatally wounded.</p>

<p>The Pathans were at his heels, not to be halted so easily this
time. The Turkomans fired point-blank into their faces, but they
came on, snarling, snatching at the rifle barrels poked over the
wall, stabbing upward.</p>

<p>Yar Muhammad, heedless of the battle raging along the wall, was
crouching over O'Donnell, mouthing, so crazy with blood lust and
fighting frenzy that he was hardly aware of what he was doing,
tearing at O'Donnell's clothing in his efforts to discover the
wound he was convinced his friend had received.</p>

<p>He could hardly be convinced otherwise by O'Donnell's lurid
blasphemy, and then he nearly strangled the American in a frantic
embrace of relief and joy. O'Donnell threw him off and leaped to
the wall, where the situation was getting desperate for the
Turkomans. The Pathans, fighting without leadership, were massed in
the middle of the east wall, and the men in the tower were pouring
a devastating fire into them, but the havoc was being wreaked in
the rear of the horde. The men in the tower feared to shoot at the
attackers along the wall for fear of hitting their own
comrades.</p>

<p>As O'Donnell reached the wall, the Turkoman nearest him thrust
his muzzle into a snarling, bearded face and pulled the trigger,
blasting the hillman's head into a red ruin. Then before he could
fire again a knife licked over the wall and disemboweled him.
O'Donnell caught the rifle as it fell, smashed the butt down on the
head of a hillman climbing over the parapet, and left him hanging
dead across the wall.</p>

<p>It was all confusion and smoke and spurting blood and insanity.
No time to look right or left to see if the Turkomans still held
the wall on either hand. He had his hands full with the snarling
bestial faces which rose like a wave before him. Crouching on the
firing step, he drove the blood-clotted butt into these wolfish
faces until a rabid-eyed giant grappled him and bore him back and
over.</p>

<p>They struck the ground on the inside, and O'Donnell's head hit a
fallen gun stock with a stunning crack. In the moment that his
brain swam dizzily the Pathan heaved him underneath, yelled
stridently and lifted a knife&mdash;then the straining body went
suddenly limp, and O'Donnell's face was spattered with blood and
brains, as Yar Muhammad split the man's head to the teeth with his
Khyber knife.</p>

<p>The Waziri pulled the corpse off and O'Donnell staggered up,
slightly sick, and presenting a ghastly spectacle with his
red-dabbled face, hands, and garments. The firing, which had lulled
while the fighting locked along the wall, now began again. The
disorganized Pathans were falling back, were slinking away,
breaking and fleeing toward the rocks.</p>

<p>The Turkomans had held the wall, but O'Donnell swore sickly as
he saw the gaps in their ranks. One lay dead in a huddle of dead
Pathans outside the wall, and five more hung motionless across the
wall, or were sprawled on the ground inside. With these latter were
the corpses of four Pathans, to show how desperate the brief fight
had been. The number of the dead outside was appalling.</p>

<p>O'Donnell shook his dizzy head, shuddering slightly at the
thought of how close to destruction his band had been; if the
hillmen had had a leader, had kept their wits about them enough to
have divided forces and attacked in several places at
once&mdash;but it takes a keen mind to think in the madness of such
a battle. It had been blind, bloody, and furious, and the
random-cast dice of fate had decided for the smaller horde.</p>

<p>The Pathans had taken to the rocks again and were firing in a
half-hearted manner. Sounds of loud argument drifted down the wind.
He set about dressing the wounded as best he could, and while he
was so employed, the Pathans tried to get at the horses again. But
the effort was without enthusiasm, and a fusillade from the tower
drove them back.</p>

<p>As quickly as he could, O'Donnell retired to a corner of the
wall and investigated the oilskin-wrapped packet he had taken from
Afzal Khan. It was a letter, several sheets of high-grade paper
covered with a fine scrawl. The writing was Russ, not <i>Urdu</i>,
and there were English margin notes in a different hand. These
notes made clear points suggested in the letter, and O'Donnell's
face grew grim as he read.</p>

<p>How the unknown English secret-service man who had added those
notes had got possession of the letter there was no way of knowing;
but it had been intended for the man called Suleiman Pasha, and it
revealed what O'Donnell had suspected&mdash;a plot within a plot; a
red and sinister conspiracy concealing itself in a guise of
international policy.</p>

<p>Suleiman Pasha was not only a foreign spy; he was a traitor to
the men he served. And the tentacles of the plot which revolved
about him stretched incredibly southward into high places.
O'Donnell swore softly as he read there the names of men trusted by
the government they pretended to serve. And slowly a realization
crystallized&mdash;this letter must never reach Suleiman Pasha.
Somehow, in some way, he, Kirby O'Donnell, must carry on the work
of that unknown Englishman who had died with his task uncompleted.
That letter must go southward, to lay bare black treachery spawning
under the heedless feet of government. He hastily concealed the
packet as the Waziri approached.</p>

<p>Yar Muhammad grinned. He had lost a tooth, and his black beard
was streaked and clotted with blood which did not make him look any
less savage.</p>

<p>"The dogs wrangle with one another," he said. "It is always
thus; only the hand of Afzal Khan kept them together. Now men who
followed him will refuse to follow one of their own number. They
fear the Khurukzai. We also have reason to beware of them. They
will be waiting in the hills beyond the Pass of Akbar."</p>

<p>O'Donnell realized the truth of this statement. He believed a
handful of Pathans yet held the tower in the pass, but there was no
reason to suppose they would not desert their post now that Afzal
Khan was dead. Men trooping down out of the hills told him that the
footpaths were no longer guarded. At any time Khurukzai scouts
might venture back, learn what was going on, and launch an attack
in force.</p>

<p>The day wore on, hot, and full of suffering for the wounded in
the inclosure. Only a desultory firing came from the rocks, where
continual squabbling seemed to be going on. No further attack was
made, and presently Yar Muhammad grunted with gratification.</p>

<p>From the movement among the rocks and beyond them, it was
evident that the leaderless outlaw band was breaking up. Men slunk
away up the valley, singly or in small bands. Others fought over
horses, and one group turned and fired a volley at their former
companions before they disappeared among the spurs at the head of
the valley. Without a chieftain they trusted, demoralized by
losses, short of water and food and ammunition, and in fear of
reprisals, the outlaw band melted away, and within an hour from the
time the first bolted, the valley of Khuruk was empty except for
O'Donnell's men.</p>

<p>To make sure the retreat was real, O'Donnell secured his horse
from the pen and, with Yar Muhammad, rode cautiously to the valley
head. The spurs were empty. From the tracks the American believed
that the bandits had headed southward, preferring to make their way
through the pathless hills rather than fight their way through the
vengeful Khurukzai who in all probability still lurked among the
crags beyond the Pass of Akbar.</p>

<p>He had to consider these men himself, and he grinned wryly at
the twist of fate which had made enemies of the very men he had
sought in friendship. But life ran that way in the hills.</p>

<p>"Go back to the Turkomans," he requested Yar Muhammad. "Bid them
saddle their horses. Tie the wounded into the saddles, and load the
spare horses with food and skins of water. We have plenty of spare
horses now, because of the men who were slain. It is dusk now, and
time we were on our way.</p>

<p>"We shall take our chance on the trails in the dark, for now
that the hill paths are unguarded, assuredly the Khurukzai will be
stealing back, and I expect an attack on the valley by moonrise, at
the latest. Let them find it empty. Perhaps we can make our way
through the Pass and be gone while they are stealing through the
hills to the attack. At least we will make the attempt and leave
the rest to Allah."</p>

<p>Yar Muhammad grinned widely&mdash;the prospect of any sort of
action seemed to gratify him immensely&mdash;and reined his horse
down the valley, evidencing all the pride that becomes a man who
rides a blooded Turkish steed. O'Donnell knew he could leave the
preparations for the journey with him and the Turkomans.</p>

<p>The American dismounted, tied his horse and strode through the
rocky spurs to the point where the trail wound out of them and
along a boulder-littered narrow level between two slopes. Dusk was
gathering, but he could see any body of men that tried to come
along that trail.</p>

<p>But he was not expecting attack by that route. Not knowing just
what had taken place in the valley, the Khurukzai, even if the men
in the tower had deserted it, would be too suspicious to follow the
obvious road. And it was not attack of any sort that was worrying
him.</p>

<p>He took the packet of papers from his girdle and stared at it.
He was torn by indecision. There were documents that needed
desperately to get to the British outposts. It was almost sheer
suicide for one man to start through the hills, but two men, with
food and water, might make it.</p>

<p>He could take Yar Muhammad, load an extra horse or two with
provisions, and slip away southward. Then let Suleiman Pasha do his
worst with Orkhan Bahadur. Long before the emissary could learn of
his flight, he and the Waziri would be far out of the vengeful
Turkoman's reach. But, then, what of the warriors back there in the
<i>sangar</i>, making ready for their homeward flight, with
implicit trust in Ali el Ghazi?</p>

<p>They had followed him blindly, obeyed his every order,
demonstrated their courage and faithfulness beyond question. If he
deserted them now, they were doomed. They could never make their
way back through the hills without him. Such as were not lost to
die of starvation would be slaughtered by the vengeful Khurukzai
who would not forget their defeat by these dark-skinned riders.</p>

<p>Sweat started out on O'Donnell's skin in the agony of his mental
struggle. Not even for the peace of all India could he desert these
men who trusted him. He was their leader. His first duty was to
them.</p>

<p>But, then, what of that damning letter? It supplied the key to
Suleiman Pasha's plot. It told of hell brewing in the Khyber Hills,
of revolt seething on the Hindu plains, of a plot which might be
nipped in the bud were the British officials to learn of it in
time. But if he returned to Shahrazar with the Turkomans, he must
give the letter to Suleiman Pasha or be denounced to
Orkhan&mdash;and that meant torture and death. He was in the fangs
of the vise; he must either sacrifice himself, his men, or the
helpless people of India.</p>

<p>"<i>Ohai</i>, Ali el Ghazi!" It was a soft hiss behind him, from
the shadow of a jutting rock. Even as he started about, a pistol
muzzle was pressed against his back.</p>

<p>"Nay, do not move. I do not trust you yet."</p>

<p>Twisting his head about, O'Donnell stared into the dark features
of Suleiman Pasha.</p>

<p>"You! How in Shaitan's name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No matter. Give me the papers which you hold in your hand. Give
them to me, or, by Allah, I will send you to hell, Kurd!"</p>

<p>With the pistol boring into his back, there was nothing else
O'Donnell could do, his heart almost bursting with rage.</p>

<p>Suleiman Pasha stepped back and tucked the papers into his
girdle. He allowed O'Donnell to turn and face him, but still kept
him covered with the pistol.</p>

<p>"After you had departed," he said, "secret word came to me from
the North that the papers for which I sent you were more important
then I had dreamed. I dared not wait in Shahrazar for your return,
lest something go awry. I rode for Khuruk with some Ghilzais who
knew the road. Beyond the Pass of Akbar we were ambushed by the
very people we sought. They slew my men, but they spared me, for I
was known to one of their headmen. They told me they had been
driven forth by Afzal Khan, and I guessed what else had occurred.
They said there had been fighting beyond the Pass, for they had
heard the sound of firing, but they did not know its nature. There
are no men in the tower in the Pass, but the Khurukzai fear a trap.
They do not know the outlaws have fled from the valley.</p>

<p>"I wished to get word with you as soon as possible, so I
volunteered to go spying for them alone, so they showed me the
footpaths. I reached the valley head in time to see the last of the
Pathans depart, and I have been hiding here awaiting a chance to
catch you alone. Listen! The Turkomans are doomed. The Khurukzai
mean to kill them all. But I can save you. We shall dress you in
the clothing of a dead Pathan, and I shall say you are a servant of
mine who has escaped from the Turkomans.</p>

<p>"I shall not return to Shahrazar. I have business in the Khyber
region. I can use a man like you. We shall return to the Khurukzai
and show them how to attack and destroy the Turkomans. Then they
will lend us an escort southward. Will you come with me and serve
me, Kurd?"</p>

<p>"No, you damned swine!" In the stress of the moment O'Donnell
spat his fury in English. Suleiman Pasha's jaw dropped, in the
staggering unexpectedness of English words from a man he thought to
be a Kurd. And in the instant his wits were disrupted by the
discovery, O'Donnell, nerved to desperate quickness, was at his
throat like a striking cobra.</p>

<p>The pistol exploded once and then was wrenched from the numbed
fingers. Suleiman Pasha was fighting in frenzied silence, and he
was all steel strings and catlike thews. But O'Donnell's
<i>kindhjal</i> was out and ripping murderously into him again and
again. They went to the earth together in the shadow of the big
rock, O'Donnell stabbing in a berserk frenzy; and then he realized
that he was driving his blade into a dead man.</p>

<p>He shook himself free and rose, staggering like a drunken man
with the red maze of his murder lust. The oilskin packet was in his
left hand, torn from his enemy's garments during the struggle. Dusk
had given way to blue, star-flecked darkness. To O'Donnell's ears
came the clink of hoofs on stone, the creak of leather. His
warriors were approaching, still hidden by the towering ledges. He
heard a low laugh that identified Yar Muhammad.</p>

<p>O'Donnell breathed deeply in vast content. Now he could guide
his men back through the passes to Shahrazar without fear of Orkhan
Bahadur, who would never know his secret. He could persuade the
Turkoman chief that it would be to his advantage to send this
letter on to the British border. He, as Ali el Ghazi, could remain
in Shahrazar safely, to oppose subtly what other conspirators came
plotting to the forbidden city.</p>

<p>He smiled as he wiped the blood from his <i>kindhjal</i> and
sheathed it. There still remained the Khurukzai, waiting with
murderous patience beyond the Pass of Akbar, but his soul was at
rest, and the prospect of fighting his way back through the
mountains troubled him not at all. He was as confident of the
outcome as if he already sat in the palace at Shahrazar.</p>

<h2><a id="swords5" name="swords5"></a>FRAGMENT: ORIGINAL OPENING
OF STORY</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">"FEEL THE EDGE, DOG, and move not!" The
hissing voice was no less menacing than the razor-edged blade that
was pressed just beneath Kirby O'Donnell's chin. The American lay
still, staring up into the dim ring of bearded faces, vague as
phantoms in the dull glow of a waning electric torch. He had
fancied himself safe in the guarded palace of his friend Orkhan
Bahadur but anything, he reflected, could happen in Shahrazar the
Forbidden. Had these men who came so silently by night discovered
the real identity of the man who called himself Ali el Ghazi, a
Kurdish wanderer? Their next words set his mind at rest on that
score.</p>

<p>"Rise from your couch, Ali el Ghazi," muttered the leader of the
men. "Rise slowly and place your hands behind you. This dagger has
sent a Kurd to Hell before now."</p>

<p>O'Donnell slowly obeyed the order, raging inwardly, but
outwardly imperturbable. His keen edged scimitar and
<i>kindhjal</i> lay almost within his grasp, but he knew that a
move toward them would send four curved blades plunging into his
heart, wielded by desperately taut nerves.</p>

<p>As he came to a sitting position, his wrists were gripped
fiercely, and bound behind him. The edge still trembled against his
throat. A single yell might bring aid, but he would never live to
complete it. He thought he knew the leader of the gang&mdash;one
Baber Khan, a renegade Ghilzai who followed Orkhan Bahadur as a
jackal follows a tiger.</p>

<p>"Not a word;" whispered the deadly voice. "Come with us."</p>

<p>The American was hauled roughly to his feet and moved across the
chamber among the close clump of his captors. A knife point bored
into his ribs. The bare feet made no sound as they left the chamber
and emerged into a broad hallway, flanked by thick columns.
Somewhere a cresset glowed, lighting the place fitfully and dimly.
Baber Khan had extinguished his electric torch. But in the light of
the cresset O'Donnell saw the black mute Orkhan Bahadur had given
him as a body guard&mdash;more a royal gesture than anything else,
for Orkhan did not suppose that Ali el Ghazi had enemies in
Shahrazar. The black man must have been dozing when the killers
crept upon him, for he had had no chance to use his wide-tipped
tulwar. His white eye-balls were rolled up, glimmering whitely in
the torch-light. His black throat was cut from ear to ear.</p>

<p>The eldritch group saw no one as they stole down the weirdly
lurid hallway. They might have been ghosts of some of the many men
whose blood had stained that pillared hall since the days of
Timur-il-leng, and the Tatar sultans. Silence lay over the palace,
the silence of death-like slumber. They came to a stair which led
downward, and down this they went, into swallowing gloom. On a
lower landing they halted, and O'Donnell felt himself forced to his
haunches. He could see nothing, but he felt hairy silk-clad bodies
pressing him close. A voice whispered so close to his ear that the
hot breath burned him.</p>

<p>"None comes down this stair by night, Kurd; speak quickly!"</p>

<p>"Of what shall I speak?" demanded O'Donnell guardedly, for the
knife was still at his neck. It was an eery experience, ringed by
bodies and knives he could not see, with menacing voices whispering
out of the gloom like disembodied spirits.</p>

<p>"I will refresh thy memory," muttered the voice of Baber Khan.
"A week ago we rode down the valley, with the riders of the
Turkomans, behind Orkhan Bahadur, to take this city of Shahrazar
from Shaibar Khan and his Uzbeks. Orkhan greatly desired this city,
because somewhere in it he knew there was a great
treasure&mdash;the treasure gathered long ago by Muhammad Shah,
king of Khuwarezm. When the Mongols of Genghis Khan hunted the
<i>Shah-im-shah</i> to his death across the world, his <i>emirs</i>
bore to forgotten Shahrazar his great store of gold, silver and
jewels. Here it remained hidden until Shaibar Khan discovered its
hiding place. Then came we, with Orkhan Bahadur, and slew all the
Uzbeks and took the city and set up Orkhan Bahadur as prince of
Shahrazar."</p>

<p>"All this is well known to me," impatiently answered
O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"Aye, for thou wert Shaibar Khan's slave!"</p>

<p>"A lie!" exclaimed O'Donnell, starting with amazement. "The Khan
was my enemy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Soho!" hissed the voice venomously. "Be still, thou!" The
wire-edge just touched the skin of his throat, and a tiny trickle
of blood started. "In a chamber below the palace we found Shaibar
Khan dead, and with him Yar Akbar the Afridi, likewise dead. But
nowhere was the treasure to be found. Nor has Orkhan Bahadur found
it, though he is lord of Shahrazar.</p>

<p>"Now it was known that certain men had the care of the treasure
in their hands, to guard it and protect it with their lives. They
were twelve in number, and were called the <i>emirs</i> of the
Inner Chamber. Eleven of these men we found dead, and we knew them
by reason of a gold emblem each wore on a gold chain about his
neck&mdash;an oval of gold, with a Khuwarezm
inscription&mdash;so!"</p>

<p>A glow dazzled O'Donnell; in it a great hairy hand snaked out of
the dark and tore at the garments over his breast&mdash;wrenched
out something that glimmered in the dull light. Breath hissed from
between teeth in the dark about him. In the gnarled hand lay an
oval of beaten gold, carved with a single cryptic character.</p>

<p>"You are the twelfth man!" accused Baber Khan. "You were an
<i>emir</i> of the Inner Chamber! It was you who hid the
treasure!"</p>

<p>"I am no Uzbek!" snarled O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"Nay, but Shaibar Khan had men of many races among his ranks.
You were found in the palace when we took the city, the only living
fighting man in the palace. I have watched you closely, and today I
spied the symbol among your garments."</p>

<p>O'Donnell cursed mentally for not having disposed of the damning
emblem.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of the treasure," he said angrily. "This gaud I
took from the neck of a man I slew in a dark alley." And that last
was the truth.</p>

<p>"Thou art stubborn," muttered Baber Khan; "but the steel shall
teach thee. Grip him!"</p>

<p>Fierce hands clamped over the American's mouth, and others held
him hard, stretching him out. O'Donnell's body was a knot of wiry
thews, but with his hands bound, and three hairy giants grasping
him, he was helpless. He felt Baber Khan's fingers clutching at his
ankle, lifting his foot; then the sharp agony of a knife point
driving under the nail of his great toe. He set his teeth against
the hurt, then it was withdrawn, and he felt blood trickling over
his foot. The hand released his jaws.</p>

<p>"Where is the treasure?" hissed the savage voice out of the
darkness.</p>

<p>"Let me up," mumbled O'Donnell. "I'll lead you to it."</p>

<p>A gusty sigh of satisfaction answered him. He was hauled to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Lead on," Baber Khan directed. He did not promise O'Donnell his
life in return for the secret of the treasure; the American knew
that the treacherous Ghilzai had no intention of letting him live,
in any event.</p>

<p>"We will go to the chamber in which was found the bodies of
Shaibar Khan and Yar Akbar," said he, and with a satisfied grunt,
they allowed him to lead the way, grasping his arms, with their
knives at his ribs.</p>

<p>They went on down the stair, through a tapestried door and down
a short corridor. This corridor, lighted by Baber's wavering torch,
seemed to terminate against a blank marble wall. But all the palace
knew its secret, since the invasion of the Turkomans, and the
Ghilzai thrust against the wall with a burly shoulder. A section
swung in, working on a pivot....</p>
