<p class="first">THE thunder of my old-fashioned door-knocker,
reverberating eerily through the house, roused me from a restless
and nightmare-haunted sleep. I looked out the window. In the last
light of the sinking moon, the white face of my friend John
Conrad looked up at me.</p>

<p>"May I come up, Kirowan?" His voice was shaky and
strained.</p>

<p>"Certainly!" I sprang out of bed and pulled on a bath-robe as
I heard him enter the front door and ascend the stairs.</p>

<p>A moment later he stood before me, and in the light which I
had turned on I saw his hands tremble and noticed the unnatural
pallor of his face.</p>

<p>"Old John Grimlan died an hour ago," he said abruptly.</p>

<p>"Indeed? I had not known that he was ill."</p>

<p>"It was a sudden, virulent attack of peculiar nature, a sort
of seizure somewhat akin to epilepsy. He has been subject to such
spells of late years, you know."</p>

<p>I nodded. I knew something of the old hermit-like man who had
lived in his great dark house on the hill; indeed, I had once
witnessed one of his strange seizures, and I had been appalled at
the writhings, howlings and yammerings of the wretch, who had
groveled on the earth like a wounded snake, gibbering terrible
curses and black blasphemies until his voice broke in a wordless
screaming which spattered his lips with foam. Seeing this, I
understood why people in old times looked on such victims as men
possessed by demons.</p>

<p>"&mdash;some hereditary taint," Conrad was saying. "Old John
doubtless fell heir to some ingrown weakness brought on by some
loathsome disease, which was his heritage from perhaps a remote
ancestor&mdash;such things occasionally happen. Or
else&mdash;well, you know old John himself pried about in the
mysterious parts of the earth, and wandered all over the East in
his younger days. It is quite possible that he was infected with
some obscure malady in his wanderings. There are still many
unclassified diseases in Africa and the Orient."</p>

<p>"But," said I, "you have not told me the reason for this
sudden visit at this unearthly hour&mdash;for I notice that it is
past midnight."</p>

<p>My friend seemed rather confused.</p>

<p>"Well, the fact is that John Grimlan died alone, except for
myself. He refused to receive any medical aid of any sort, and in
the last few moments when it was evident that he was dying, and I
was prepared to go for some sort of help in spite of him, he set
up such a howling and screaming that I could not refuse his
passionate pleas&mdash;which were that he should not be left to
die alone.</p>

<p>"I have seen men die," added Conrad, wiping the perspiration
from his pale brow, "but the death of John Grimlan was the most
fearful I have ever seen."</p>

<p>"He suffered a great deal?"</p>

<p>"He appeared to be in much physical agony, but this was mostly
submerged by some monstrous mental or psychic suffering. The fear
in his distended eyes and his screams transcended any conceivable
earthly terror. I tell you, Kirowan, Grimlan's fright was greater
and deeper than the ordinary fear of the Beyond shown by a man of
ordinarily evil life."</p>

<p>I shifted restlessly. The dark implications of this statement
sent a chill of nameless apprehension trickling down my
spine.</p>

<p>"I know the country people always claimed that in his youth he
sold his soul to the Devil, and that his sudden epileptic attacks
were merely a visible sign of the Fiend's power over him; but
such talk is foolish, of course, and belongs in the Dark Ages. We
all know that John Grimlan's life was a peculiarly evil and
vicious one, even toward his last days. With good reason he was
universally detested and feared, for I never heard of his doing a
single good act. You were his only friend."</p>

<p>"And that was a strange friendship," said Conrad. "I was
attracted to him by his unusual powers, for despite his bestial
nature, John Grimlan was a highly educated man, a deeply cultured
man. He had dipped deep into occult studies, and I first met him
in this manner; for as you know, I have always been strongly
interested in these lines of research myself.</p>

<p>"But, in this as in all other things, Grimlan was evil and
perverse. He had ignored the white side of the occult and delved
into the darker, grimmer phases of it&mdash;into devil-worship,
and voodoo and Shintoism. His knowledge of these foul arts and
sciences was immense and unholy. And to hear him tell of his
researches and experiments was to know such horror and repulsion
as a venomous reptile might inspire. For there had been no depths
to which he had not sunk, and some things he only hinted at, even
to me. I tell you, Kirowan, it is easy to laugh at tales of the
black world of the unknown, when one is in pleasant company under
the bright sunlight, but had you sat at ungodly hours in the
silent bizarre library of John Grimlan and looked on the ancient
musty volumes and listened to his grisly talk as I did, your
tongue would have cloven to your palate with sheer horror as mine
did, and the supernatural would have seemed very real and near to
you&mdash;as it seemed to me!"</p>

<p>"But in God's name, man!" I cried, for the tension was growing
unbearable; "come to the point and tell me what you want of
me."</p>

<p>"I want you to come with me to John Grimlan's house and help
carry out his outlandish instructions in regard to his body."</p>

<p>I had no liking for the adventure, but I dressed hurriedly, an
occasional shudder of premonition shaking me. Once fully clad, I
followed Conrad out of the house and up the silent road which led
to the house of John Grimlan. The road wound uphill, and all the
way, looking upward and forward, I could see that great grim
house perched like a bird of evil on the crest of the hill,
bulking black and stark against the stars. In the west pulsed a
single dull red smear where the young moon had just sunk from
view behind the low black hills. The whole night seemed full of
brooding evil, and the persistent swishing of a bat's wings
somewhere overhead caused my taut nerves to jerk and thrum. To
drown the quick pounding of my own heart, I said:</p>

<p>"Do you share the belief so many hold, that John Grimlan was
mad?"</p>

<p>We strode on several paces before Conrad answered, seemingly
with a strange reluctance, "But for one incident, I would say no
man was ever saner. But one night in his study, he seemed
suddenly to break all bonds of reason.</p>

<p>"He had discoursed for hours on his favorite
subject&mdash;black magic&mdash;when suddenly he cried, as his
face lit with a weird unholy glow: 'Why should I sit here
babbling such child's prattle to you? These voodoo
rituals&mdash;these Shinto sacrifices&mdash;feathered
snakes&mdash;goats without horns&mdash;black leopard
cults&mdash;bah! Filth and dust that the wind blows away! Dregs
of the real Unknown&mdash;the deep mysteries! Mere echoes from
the Abyss!</p>

<p>"'I could tell you things that would shatter your paltry
brain! I could breathe into your ear names that would wither you
like a burnt weed! What do you know of Yog-Sothoth, of Kathulos
and the sunken cities? None of these names is even included in
your mythologies. Not even in your dreams have you glimpsed the
black cyclopean walls of Koth, or shriveled before the noxious
winds that blow from Yuggoth!</p>

<p>"'But I will not blast you lifeless with my black wisdom! I
cannot expect your infantile brain to bear what mine holds. Were
you as old as I&mdash;had you seen, as I have seen, kingdoms
crumble and generations pass away&mdash;had you gathered as ripe
grain the dark secrets of the centuries&mdash;'</p>

<p>"He was raving away, his wildly lit face scarcely human in
appearance, and suddenly, noting my evident bewilderment, he
burst into a horrible cackling laugh.</p>

<p>"'Gad!' he cried in a voice and accent strange to me,
'methinks I've frighted ye, and certes, it is not to be marveled
at, sith ye be but a naked savage in the arts of life, after
all. Ye think I be old, eh? Why, ye gaping lout, ye'd drop dead
were I to divulge the generations of men I've known&mdash;'</p>

<p>"But at this point such horror overcame me that I fled from
him as from an adder, and his high-pitched, diabolical laughter
followed me out of the shadowy house. Some days later I received
a letter apologizing for his manner and ascribing it
candidly&mdash;too candidly&mdash;to drugs. I did not believe it,
but I renewed our relations, after some hesitation."</p>

<p>"It sounds like utter madness," I muttered.</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Conrad, hesitantly. "But&mdash;Kirowan, have
you ever seen anyone who knew John Grimlan in his youth?"</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"I have been at pains to inquire about him discreetly," said
Conrad. "He has lived here&mdash;with the exception of mysterious
absences often for months at a time&mdash;for twenty years. The
older villagers remember distinctly when he first came and took
over that old house on the hill, and they all say that in the
intervening years he seems not to have aged perceptibly. When he
came here he looked just as he does now&mdash;or did, up to the
moment of his death&mdash;of the appearance of a man about
fifty.</p>

<p>"I met old Von Boehnk in Vienna, who said he knew Grimlan when
a very young man studying in Berlin, fifty years ago, and he
expressed astonishment that the old man was still living; for he
said at that time Grimlan seemed to be about fifty years of
age."</p>

<p>I gave an incredulous exclamation, seeing the implication
toward which the conversation was trending.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Professor Von Boehnk is past eighty himself, and
liable to the errors of extreme age. He confused this man with
another." Yet as I spoke, my flesh crawled unpleasantly and the
hairs on my neck prickled.</p>

<p>"Well," shrugged Conrad, "here we are at the house."</p>

<p>The huge pile reared up menacingly before us, and as we
reached the front door a vagrant wind moaned through the near-by
trees and I started foolishly as I again heard the ghostly beat
of the bat's wings. Conrad turned a large key in the antique
lock, and as we entered, a cold draft swept across us like a
breath from the grave&mdash;moldy and cold. I shuddered.</p>

<p>We groped our way through a black hallway and into a study,
and here Conrad lighted a candle, for no gas lights or electric
lights were to be found in the house. I looked about me, dreading
what the light might disclose, but the room, heavily tapestried
and bizarrely furnished, was empty save for us two.</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;where is&mdash;<i>it</i>?" I asked in a husky
whisper, from a throat gone dry.</p>

<p>"Upstairs," answered Conrad in a low voice, showing that the
silence and mystery of the house had laid a spell on him also.
"Upstairs, in the library where he died."</p>

<p>I glanced up involuntarily. Somewhere above our head, the lone
master of this grim house was stretched out in his last
sleep&mdash;silent, his white face set in a grinning mask of
death. Panic swept over me and I fought for control. After all,
it was merely the corpse of a wicked old man, who was past
harming anyone&mdash;this argument rang hollowly in my brain like
the words of a frightened child who is trying to reassure
himself.</p>

<p>I turned to Conrad. He had taken a time-yellowed envelope from
an inside pocket.</p>

<p>"This," he said, removing from the envelope several pages of
closely written, time-yellowed parchment, "is, in effect, the
last word of John Grimlan, though God alone knows how many years
ago it was written. He gave it to me ten years ago, immediately
after his return from Mongolia. It was shortly after this that he
had his first seizure.</p>

<p>"This envelope he gave me, sealed, and he made me swear that I
would hide it carefully, and that I would not open it until he
was dead, when I was to read the contents and follow their
directions exactly. More, he made me swear that no matter what he
said or did after giving me the envelope, I would go ahead as
first directed. 'For,' he said with a fearful smile, 'the flesh
is weak but I am a man of my word, and though I might, in a
moment of weakness, wish to retract, it is far, far too late now.
You may never understand the matter, but you are to do as I have
said.'"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well," again Conrad wiped his brow, "tonight as he lay
writhing in his death-agonies, his wordless howls were mingled
with frantic admonitions to me to bring him the envelope and
destroy it before his eyes! As he yammered this, he forced
himself up on his elbows and with eyes staring and hair standing
straight up on his head, he screamed at me in a manner to chill
the blood. And he was shrieking for me to destroy the envelope,
not to open it; and once he howled in his delirium for me to hew
his body into pieces and scatter the bits to the four winds of
heaven!"</p>

<p>An uncontrollable exclamation of horror escaped my dry
lips.</p>

<p>"At last," went on Conrad, "I gave in. Remembering his
commands ten years ago, I at first stood firm, but at last, as
his screeches grew unbearably desperate, I turned to go for the
envelope, even though that meant leaving him alone. But as I
turned, with one last fearful convulsion in which blood-flecked
foam flew from his writhing lips, the life went from his twisted
body in a single great wrench."</p>

<p>He fumbled at the parchment.</p>

<p>"I am going to carry out my promise. The directions herein
seem fantastic and may be the whims of a disordered mind, but I
gave my word. They are, briefly, that I place his corpse on the
great black ebony table in his library, with seven black candles
burning about him. The doors and windows are to be firmly closed
and fastened. Then, in the darkness which precedes dawn, I am to
read the formula, charm or spell which is contained in a smaller,
sealed envelope inside the first, and which I have not yet
opened."</p>

<p>"But is that all?" I cried. "No provisions as to the
disposition of his fortune, his estate&mdash;or his corpse?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. In his will, which I have seen elsewhere, he leaves
estate and fortune to a certain Oriental gentleman named in the
document as&mdash;Malik Tous!"</p>

<p>"What!" I cried, shaken to my soul. "Conrad, this is madness
heaped on madness! Malik Tous&mdash;good God! No mortal man was
ever so named! That is the title of the foul god worshipped by
the mysterious Yezidees&mdash;they of Mount Alamout the
Accursed&mdash;whose Eight Brazen Towers rise in the mysterious
wastes of deep Asia. His idolatrous symbol is the brazen peacock.
And the Muhammadans, who hate his demon-worshipping devotees, say
he is the essence of the evil of all the universes&mdash;the
Prince of Darkness&mdash;Ahriman&mdash;the old Serpent&mdash;the
veritable Satan! And you say Grimlan names this mythical demon in
his will?"</p>

<p>"It is the truth," Conrad's throat was dry. "And look&mdash;he
has scribbled a strange line at the corner of this parchment:
'Dig me no grave; I shall not need one.'"</p>

<p>Again a chill wandered down my spine.</p>

<p>"In God's name," I cried in a kind of frenzy, "let us get this
incredible business over with!"</p>

<p>"I think a drink might help," answered Conrad, moistening his
lips. "It seems to me I've seen Grimlan go into this cabinet for
wine&mdash;" He bent to the door of an ornately carved mahogany
cabinet, and after some difficulty opened it.</p>

<p>"No wine here," he said disappointedly, "and if ever I felt
the need of stimulants&mdash;what's this?"</p>

<p>He drew out a roll of parchment, dusty, yellowed and half
covered with spiderwebs. Everything in that grim house seemed, to
my nervously excited senses, fraught with mysterious meaning and
import, and I leaned over his shoulder as he unrolled it.</p>

<p>"It's a record of peerage," he said, "such a chronicle of
births, deaths and so forth, as the old families used to keep, in
the Sixteenth Century and earlier."</p>

<p>"What's the name?" I asked.</p>

<p>He scowled over the dim scrawls, striving to master the faded,
archaic script.</p>

<p>"G-r-y-m&mdash;I've got it&mdash;Grymlann, of course. It's the
records of old John's family&mdash;the Grymlanns of Toad's-heath
Manor, Suffolk&mdash;what an outlandish name for an estate! Look
at the last entry."</p>

<p>Together we read, "John Grymlann, borne, March 10, 1630." And
then we both cried out. Under this entry was freshly written, in
a strange scrawling hand, "Died, March 10, 1930." Below this
there was a seal of black wax, stamped with a strange design,
something like a peacock with a spreading tail.</p>

<p>Conrad stared at me speechless, all the color ebbed from his
face. I shook myself with the rage engendered by fear.</p>

<p>"It's the hoax of a madman!" I shouted. "The stage has been
set with such great care that the actors have overstepped
themselves. Whoever they are, they have heaped up so many
incredible effects as to nullify them. It's all a very stupid,
very dull drama of illusion."</p>

<p>And even as I spoke, icy sweat stood out on my body and I
shook as with an ague. With a wordless motion Conrad turned
toward the stairs, taking up a large candle from a mahogany
table.</p>

<p>"It was understood, I suppose," he whispered, "that I should
go through with this ghastly matter alone; but I had not the
moral courage, and now I'm glad I had not."</p>

<p>A still horror brooded over the silent house as we went up the
stairs. A faint breeze stole in from somewhere and set the heavy
velvet hangings rustling, and I visualized stealthy taloned
fingers drawing aside the tapestries, to fix red gloating eyes
upon us. Once I thought I heard the indistinct clumping of
monstrous feet somewhere above us, but it must have been the
heavy pounding of my own heart.</p>

<p>The stairs debouched into a wide dark corridor, in which our
feeble candle cast a faint gleam which but illuminated our pale
faces and made the shadows seem darker by comparison. We stopped
at a heavy door, and I heard Conrad's breath draw in sharply as a
man's will when he braces himself physically or mentally. I
involuntarily clenched my fists until the nails bit into the
palms; then Conrad thrust the door open.</p>

<p>A sharp cry escaped his lips. The candle dropped from his
nerveless fingers and went out. The library of John Grimlan was
ablaze with light, though the whole house had been in darkness
when we entered it.</p>

<p>This light came from seven black candles placed at regular
intervals about the great ebony table. On this table, between the
candles&mdash;I had braced myself against the sight. Now in the
face of the mysterious illumination and the sight of the thing on
the table, my resolution nearly gave way. John Grimlan had been
unlovely in life; in death he was hideous. Yes, he was hideous
even though his face was mercifully covered with the same curious
silken robe, which, worked in fantastic bird-like designs,
covered his whole body except the crooked claw-like hands and the
bare withered feet.</p>

<p>A strangling sound came from Conrad. "My God!" he whispered;
"what is this? I laid his body out on the table and placed the
candles about it, but I did not light them, nor did I place that
robe over the body! And there were bedroom slippers on his feet
when I left&mdash;"</p>

<p>He halted suddenly. We were not alone in the death-room.</p>

<p>At first we had not seen him, as he sat in the great armchair
in a farther nook of a corner, so still that he seemed a part of
the shadows cast by the heavy tapestries. As my eyes fell upon
him, a violent shuddering shook me and a feeling akin to nausea
racked the pit of my stomach. My first impression was of vivid,
oblique yellow eyes which gazed unwinkingly at us. Then the man
rose and made a deep salaam, and we saw that he was an Oriental.
Now when I strive to etch him clearly in my mind, I can resurrect
no plain image of him. I only remember those piercing eyes and
the yellow, fantastic robe he wore.</p>

<p>We returned his salute mechanically and he spoke in a low,
refined voice, "Gentlemen, I crave your pardon! I have made so
free as to light the candles&mdash;shall we not proceed with the
business pertaining to our mutual friend."</p>

<p>He made a slight gesture toward the silent bulk on the table.
Conrad nodded, evidently unable to speak. The thought flashed
through our minds at the same time, that this man had also been
given a sealed envelope&mdash;but how had he come to the Grimlan
house so quickly? John Grimlan had been dead scarcely two hours
and to the best of our knowledge no one knew of his demise but
ourselves. And how had he got into the locked and bolted
house?</p>

<p>The whole affair was grotesque and unreal in the extreme. We
did not even introduce ourselves or ask the stranger his name. He
took charge in a matter-of-fact way, and so under the spell of
horror and illusion were we that we moved dazedly, involuntarily
obeying his suggestions, given us in a low, respectful tone.</p>

<p>I found myself standing on the left side of the table, looking
across its grisly burden at Conrad. The Oriental stood with arms
folded and head bowed at the head of the table, nor did it then
strike me as being strange that he should stand there, instead of
Conrad who was to read what Grimlan had written. I found my gaze
drawn to the figure worked on the breast of the stranger's robe,
in black silk&mdash;a curious figure, somewhat resembling a
peacock and somewhat resembling a bat, or a flying dragon. I
noted with a start that the same design was worked on the robe
covering the corpse.</p>

<p>The doors had been locked, the windows fastened down. Conrad,
with a shaky hand, opened the inner envelope and fluttered open
the parchment sheets contained therein. These sheets seemed much
older than those containing the instructions to Conrad, in the
larger envelope. Conrad began to read in a monotonous drone which
had the effect of hypnosis on the hearer; so at times the candles
grew dim in my gaze and the room and its occupants swam strange
and monstrous, veiled and distorted like an hallucination. Most
of what he read was gibberish; it meant nothing; yet the sound of
it and the archaic style of it filled me with an intolerable
horror.</p>

<p>"To ye contract elsewhere recorded, I, John Grymlann, herebye
sweare by ye Name of ye Nameless One to keep goode faithe.
Wherefore do I now write in blood these wordes spoken to me in
thys grim &amp; silent chamber in ye dedde citie of Koth, whereto
no mortal manne hath attained but mee. These same wordes now writ
down by mee to be rede over my bodie at ye appointed tyme to
fulfill my parte of ye bargain which I entered intoe of mine own
free will &amp; knowledge beinge of rite mynd &amp; fiftie years
of age this yeare of 1680, A. D. Here begynneth ye
incantation:</p>

<p>"Before manne was, ye Elder ones were, &amp; even yet their
lord dwelleth amonge ye shadows to which if a manne sette his
foote he maye not turn vpon his track."</p>

<p>The words merged into a barbaric gibberish as Conrad stumbled
through an unfamiliar language&mdash;a language faintly
suggesting the Phoenician, but shuddery with the touch of a
hideous antiquity beyond any remembered earthly tongue. One of
the candles flickered and went out. I made a move to relight it,
but a motion from the silent Oriental stayed me. His eyes burned
into mine, then shifted back to the still form on the table.</p>

<p>The manuscript had shifted back into its archaic English.</p>

<p>"&mdash;And ye mortal which gaineth to ye black citadels of
Koth &amp; speaks with ye Darke Lord whose face is hidden, for a
price maye he gain hys heartes desire, ryches &amp; knowledge
beyond countinge &amp; lyffe beyond mortal span even two hundred
and fiftie yeares."</p>

<p>Again Conrad's voice trailed off into unfamiliar gutturals.
Another candle went out.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Let not ye mortal flynche as ye tyme draweth nigh for
payement &amp; ye fires of Hell laye hold vpon ye vytals as the
sign of reckoninge. For ye Prince of Darkness taketh hys due in
ye endde &amp; he is not to bee cozened. What ye have promised,
that shall ye deliver. <i>Augantha ne shuba</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>At the first sound of those barbaric accents, a cold hand of
terror locked about my throat. My frantic eyes shot to the
candles and I was not surprised to see another flicker out. Yet
there was no hint of any draft to stir the heavy black hangings.
Conrad's voice wavered; he drew his hand across his throat,
gagging momentarily. The eyes of the Oriental never altered.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Amonge ye sonnes of men glide strange shadows for
ever. Men see ye tracks of ye talones but not ye feete that make
them. Over ye souls of men spread great black wingges. There is
but one Black Master though men calle hym Sathanas &amp;
Beelzebub &amp; Apolleon &amp; Ahriman &amp; Malik
Tous&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mists of horror engulfed me. I was dimly aware of Conrad's
voice droning on and on, both in English and in that other
fearsome tongue whose horrific import I scarcely dared try to
guess. And with stark fear clutching at my heart, I saw the
candles go out, one by one. And with each flicker, as the
gathering gloom darkened about us, my horror mounted. I could not
speak, I could not move; my distended eyes were fixed with
agonized intensity on the remaining candle. The silent Oriental
at the head of that ghastly table was included in my fear. He had
not moved nor spoken, but under his drooping lids, his eyes
burned with devilish triumph; I knew that beneath his inscrutable
exterior he was gloating fiendishly&mdash;but why&mdash;<i>why?</i></p>

<p>But I knew that the moment the extinguishing of the last
candle plunged the room into utter darkness, some nameless,
abominable thing would take place. Conrad was approaching the
end. His voice rose to the climax in gathering crescendo.</p>

<p>"Approacheth now ye moment of payement. Ye ravens are flying.
Ye bats winge against ye skye. There are skulls in ye starres. Ye
soul &amp; ye bodie are promised and shall bee delivered uppe.
Not to ye dust agayne nor ye elements from which springe
lyfe&mdash;"</p>

<p>The candle flickered slightly. I tried to scream, but my mouth
gaped to a soundless yammering. I tried to flee, but I stood
frozen, unable even to close my eyes.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Ye abysse yawns &amp; ye debt is to paye. Ye light
fayles, ye shadows gather. There is no god but evil; no lite but
darkness; no hope but doom&mdash;"</p>

<p>A hollow groan resounded through the room. <i>It seemed to come
from the robe-covered thing on the table!</i> That robe twitched
fitfully.</p>

<p>"Oh winges in ye black darke!"</p>

<p>I started violently; a faint swish sounded in the gathering
shadows. The stir of the dark hangings? It sounded like the
rustle of gigantic wings.</p>

<p>"Oh redde eyes in ye shadows! What is promised, what is writ
in bloode is fulfilled! Ye lite is gulfed in blackness!
Ya&mdash;Koth!"</p>

<p>The last candle went out suddenly and a ghastly unhuman cry
that came not from my lips or from Conrad's burst unbearably
forth. Horror swept over me like a black icy wave; in the blind
dark I heard myself screaming terribly. Then with a swirl and a
great rush of wind something swept the room, flinging the
hangings aloft and dashing chairs and tables crashing to the
floor. For an instant an intolerable odor burned our nostrils, a
low hideous tittering mocked us in the blackness; then silence
fell like a shroud.</p>

<p>Somehow, Conrad found a candle and lighted it. The faint glow
showed us the room in fearful disarray&mdash;showed us each
other's ghastly faces&mdash;and showed us the black ebony
table&mdash;empty! The doors and windows were locked as they had
been, but the Oriental was gone&mdash;and so was the corpse of
John Grimlan.</p>

<p>Shrieking like damned men we broke down the door and fled
frenziedly down the well-like staircase where the darkness seemed
to clutch at us with clammy black fingers. As we tumbled down
into the lower hallway, a lurid glow cut the darkness and the
scent of burning wood filled our nostrils.</p>

<p>The outer doorway held momentarily against our frantic
assault, then gave way and we hurtled into the outer starlight.
Behind us the flames leaped up with a crackling roar as we fled
down the hill. Conrad, glancing over his shoulder, halted
suddenly, wheeled and flung up his arms like a madman, and
screamed:</p>

<p>"Soul and body he sold to Malik Tous, who is Satan, two
hundred and fifty years ago! This was the night of
payment&mdash;and my God&mdash;look! <i>Look!</i> The Fiend has claimed
his own!"</p>

<p>I looked, frozen with horror. Flames had enveloped the whole
house with appalling swiftness, and now the great mass was etched
against the shadowed sky, a crimson inferno. And above the
holocaust hovered a gigantic black shadow like a monstrous bat,
and from its dark clutch dangled a small white thing, like the
body of a man, dangling limply. Then, even as we cried out in
horror, it was gone and our dazed gaze met only the shuddering
walls and blazing roof which crumpled into the flames with an
earth-shaking roar.</p>
