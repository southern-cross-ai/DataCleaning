<span class="a">Sir</span>,<br>
<br>
<p>The documents now submitted to you may fairly be called the
First Annals of this colony. They are important as being official
records, and they set at rest some points which have hitherto
been in dispute or doubt regarding the settlement attempted by
Governor Collins at Port Phillip Heads three quarters of a
century ago.</p>
<p>As you have thought these early historical MSS. worthy of
national publication, I have compressed in the form of a
Prefatory Note a few facts necessary to the illustration of their
character and value, and showing how they were brought to
light.</p>
<p>I take leave to add that when future writers of Australian
history come to tell the story of that marvellous national career
which in less than fifty years has transformed a coast
whaling-station and a few turf huts on the banks of an unnamed
river into the noble Province of Victoria, they will not fail to
recognize the public spirit which has induced you to preserve
these memorials of an earlier attempt at its colonization, which,
happily for us all, came to nought.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">I have the honour to be,<br>

<h3><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>PREFATORY NOTE BY THE
EDITOR.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<br>
<p><span class="a">To</span> get a clear idea of the space of
time in which the great English colonies have grown up in
Australasia, as well as to mark the period to which the following
historical records refer, an illustration, at once simple and
striking, may be given in a few words.</p>
<p>At a little village a few miles from Hobart Town there still
walks about a hale hearty man, who was born at Port Phillip Heads
on the 25th November 1803. His parents had landed there with the
rest of the intended colony about six weeks before.</p>
<p>On the following Christmas Day, under the gum trees
overlooking what is now called "Sorrento," after the chaplain's
sermon to the assembled civil and military officers, the settlers
and the convicts,* Lieutenant-Governor Collins handed the little
son of the sergeant of marines to the Rev. Mr. Knopwood, and
stood godfather to <i>William James "Hobart" Thorne</i>, the
first-born of the settlement. In another month godfather and
godson, officers, emigrants, and outlaws had got on board their
ships again, had hove up their anchors and sailed away for
Tasmania, where Hobart Thorne and Hobart Town grew up
together.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The First Sermon Preached in Port Phillip, on
the 13th November 1803, by the Revd. Mr. Knopwood, has been
printed in the Melbourne "Church of England Messenger," 14th
February 1878.]</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Governor Collins was born in 1756. At the age of
nineteen he was with his father's regiment at "Bunker's Hill," in
the American Revolutionary War, and at thirty-two he went out, in
1788, as Judge-Advocate with Governor Phillip in the
"<span class="a">First Fleet</span>", and so helped to found
<span class="a">Sydney</span>.</p>
<p>When we reflect that at that time there was not a white man
resident on any part of the vast island-continent of Australia,
or in New Zealand, Tasmania, or any of the islands washed by
Australasian seas, we may form some idea of what has been done in
the span of these two lives.</p>
<p>The journals of the early discoverers and explorers, which led
to Collins being sent out by the British Government to establish
a penal colony at Port Phillip, together with the records of the
settlement itself, have hitherto been very imperfectly known. The
disappearance of some has been a bar to accurate historical
narrative and the cause of many perplexities. Very recently,
however, the archives of the Public Record Office of England have
been successfully ransacked by the son of an early Victorian
colonist, who has lately published the result of his five years'
painstaking research.** To Mr. Labilliere belongs the credit of
having gathered from the vast collection of State Papers
preserved in the Colonial and Admiralty offices in London most of
the missing records; and, for the first time, we read in his
volumes the true story of the first discovery and subsequent
exploration of this province, given in the exact words of the men
who did the work.</p>
<p class="foot">[** "The Early History of Victoria: From its
Discovery to its Establishment as a Self-governing Province of
the British Empire." By F.P. Labilliere, Barrister-at-Law.
London: Sampson Low and Co. May 1878.]</p>
<p>But for some of these missing documents Mr. Labilliere sought
in vain; and the Journals of <span class="a">Grimes</span> and
<span class="a">Knopwood</span>, now published, are of that
number.</p>
<p>These fill up gaps in his collection, and their value will be
best seen when read in connection with his full and clear
narrative, which at the same time has rendered it unnecessary in
this place to do more than sketch-in a few outlines left by Mr.
Labilliere untouched.</p>
<p>The fears of Governor King at the beginning of the century
that France had a design to establish herself somewhere in
Australia&mdash;to convert Western Port perhaps into a second
Pondicherry&mdash;lent weight to the concurrent testimony of
Bass, Grant, Murray, and Flinders, as to the suitability of the
south coast as a place for settlement; and the expedition of
Lieutenant-Colonel Collins was the prompt result determined on by
the British Government. But meantime Governor King saw fit to
have a more particular survey made of Port Phillip. For this
purpose the colonial schooner <i>Cumberland</i>, of 29 tons (the
same in which Flinders, exactly twelve months afterwards, was
made prisoner in the Isle of France), was equipped in Sydney, and
placed in charge of Lieutenant <span class="a">Charles
Robbins</span> of H.M.S. <i>Buffalo</i>. Robbins carried
despatches to the French Commodore <span class="a">Baudin</span>,
then known to be on the coast, in case he should fall in with
him. Besides the crew, the party consisted of <span class=
"a">Charles Grimes</span>, the Acting Surveyor-General of New
South Wales; Dr. <span class="a">McCallum</span>, surgeon;
<span class="a">James Meehan</span>, a surveyor; and <span class=
"a">James Flemming</span>, a man in whom the Governor had great
confidence, who was to observe the nature of the country
explored. Their orders were to "walk round" Port Phillip.</p>
<p>The journal of the expedition, herein related, was kept by
Flemming, and the chart attached is a <i>fac-simile</i> of the
survey made by Grimes.</p>
<p>The <i>Cumberland</i> sailed from Sydney on the 23rd November
1802, and on the 8th December fell in with Baudin at Sea Elephant
Bay, on the east coast of King Island. Peron, the naturalist of
the French Expedition tells us what followed:* He
says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* Voyage de D&eacute;couvertes aux Terres
Australes, sur les corvettes <i>le G&eacute;ographe, le
Naturaliste</i>, et la go&euml;lette <i>le Casuarina</i> pendant
les ann&eacute;es 1800-4. Par F. Peron et L. Freycinet. Paris,
1807-16. 2 vols. 4to; cartes, royal 4to.]</p>
<p>"Just as we had made these arrangements for the safety of our
ship<br>
"we saw the little schooner the <i>Cumberland</i> appear. She had
come<br>
"from Port Jackson and had on board Mr. Grimes, Engineer-in-Chief
of<br>
"the English establishment, who came by order of the Government
to<br>
"make a declaration to us which was as singular in form as
remarkable<br>
in its object. 'It being reported,' wrote Mr. King to our<br>
"commander, 'that you propose to leave some men either in
Diemen's<br>
"'Land or on the western coast of New South Wales in order to
form<br>
"'there a French colony, I think it my duty to declare to you, M.
le<br>
"'Commandant, that, in virtue of the Act of 1788 for taking
possession,<br>
"'solemnly proclaimed by England, all these countries form an<br>
"'integral part of the British Empire; and that you cannot
occupy<br>
"'any part of them without breaking the bonds of friendship
which<br>
"'have been so recently re-established between the two nations.
I<br>
"'shall not even attempt to dissemble, for such is the nature of
my<br>
"'special instructions with regard thereto, that I must oppose by
all<br>
"'means in my power the execution of the project you are
suspected<br>
"'of being about to execute. In consequence of which H.M.S.<br>
"'<i>Cumberland</i> has received orders not to leave you until
the officer who<br>
"'commands her is satisfied that your operations are foreign to
any kind<br>
"'of invasion of British territory in these parts.'" [pp. 5,
6.]</p>
<p>Having delivered their message, and made the exploration of
King-Island noted in the Journal, the <i>Cumberland</i> sailed on
her mission to Port Phillip, which they entered on the 20th
January 1803. The Journal and chart show how faithfully Grimes
carried out his instructions. He was undoubtedly on this occasion
the discoverer of the river on which Melbourne now stands; but,
excepting the notice of his survey by the generous Flinders, his
meritorious services to Australia have met with almost total
neglect.</p>
<p>Grimes's report of the nature of the country seen round Port
Phillip was considered unfavorable, and was sent home to England
by the <i>Glatton</i>. Before the information reached the
Government, however, Collins had been despatched&mdash;27th April
1803&mdash;to form a penal settlement at the place which had been
described by Murray as resembling the scenery of Arthur's Seat
and Greenwich Park.</p>
<p>The expedition was embarked on board the 50-gun ship
<i>Calcutta</i>, Captain Daniel Woodriff, and the chartered
transport <i>Ocean</i>, John Mertho, master. Mr. Labilliere gives
a full and interesting narrative of the objects and instructions
of the British Government, and of the reasons given by Collins
for the abandonment of the place. It would, therefore, be
superfluous to speak of them here. The prompt and energetic
action of the first Australian Governor&mdash;Phillip&mdash;in
searching for a more suitable spot than Botany Bay, to which he
had been despatched by the British Government, had saved the
eastern sea-board of Australia to Great Britain. But the bright
example was lost on Collins. King sent him the report and survey
of Grimes, which it will be seen (p. 24) mentions the Yarra.
Indeed, Collins knew that the king's ship which had brought him
hither lay at her anchors in Hobson's Bay for ten days, and
filled up her water-casks with 50 tons of fresh water obtained
from the river; and also that one of her lieutenants (MacCullogh)
had actually walked from Sandridge to the camp near Arthur's
Seat, a distance of 50 miles (Knopwood, p. 96). But, without
attributing to him unworthy motives involving pecuniary gain,
there can be no doubt of His Honor's having had from the outset a
personal preference for Tasmania. The letters from Sir Joseph
Banks to Governor King, which Mr. Rusden found in the papers of
the latter, clearly show that Governor Collins before he left
London intended to go to Van Diemen's Land.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** Discovery, Survey, and Settlement of Port
Phillip: by G.W. Rusden. Melbourne; Robertson. 1871.]</p>
<p>During the stay of Collins at Port Phillip Heads he issued
from time to time a number of Orders. These were <i>printed</i>
at a small hand-press set up under a gum tree on the beach, and a
printed set has been preserved in London. The copy appended was
made from the original MSS. now treasured in the Parliament
Library of Tasmania. The date of the first of these printed
Orders is given as the 16th October 1803, and it is curious to
reflect that only eight months previously George Howe had issued
in Sydney the first number of the first journal published in
Australia, which contained the latest news from England, then
eleven months old.</p>
<p>The third document published is the Diary of the Reverend
Robert Knopwood, who was chaplain to the settlement. It commences
with the departure from England, and day by day carries the
narrative of events to the final settlement of Collins at Hobart
Town. Hitherto, and until the publication of Mr. Labilliere's
work, the only record of the voyage was to be found in the
account published by the First Lieutenant of the
<i>Calcutta</i>.* Its author was a man of merit, sensibility, and
taste, and, despite his amusing prediction of the future of Port
Phillip, his book&mdash;which is now rare&mdash;deserves a
reprint. Some extracts from Knopwood's diary were given in a
so-called life of William Buckley, "the wild white man",** but
that portion which is of historical value is now made public for
the first time.</p>
<p class="foot">[* An Account of a Voyage to establish a Colony
at Port Phillip: by J.H. Tuckey. 1 vol. Longman and Co.
1805.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** The Life and Adventures of William Buckley,
thirty-two years a wanderer amongst the Aborigines of the then
unexplored country round Port Phillip: by John Morgan. 1 vol.
Hobart Town, 1852.]</p>
<p>Many matters of curious interest respecting the inner life of
the two settlements will be found in Mr. Knopwood's diary.
Consequences we know are inexorable; but comment on these doings,
and on the personal conduct of those who have long since passed
away, may be properly left to other hands and to other pages.</p>
<p>Governor Collins died suddenly at Hobart Town on the 24th
March 1810. It has been stated that immediately after the
Governor's death two officers of the Government placed soldiers
at the door of the apartment, and busied themselves in burning
all his papers.*** A kindly notice of his character and a
description of his funeral were written in the "Derwent Star,"
published on the 3rd of April 1810, by Mr. George Prideaux
Harris, the Deputy Surveyor. Three copies only of this paper are
known to be in existence, but it has been reproduced as a
literary curiosity at the "Hobart Town Mercury" office.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Curious Facts of Old Colonial Days: by James
Bonwick, F.R.G.S. Sampson Low. London, 1870.]</p>
<p>The Reverend Mr. Knopwood was one of the chaplains to the
fleet, and a clergyman of the old school. He was born 2nd June
1761, died 18th September 1838, and was buried in the cemetery of
a little Tasmanian village named Rokeby.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Grimes, Deputy Surveyor-General of New South
Wales, came to that colony in H.M.S. <i>Gorgon</i> in September
1791. He succeeded Mr. Alfred Alt, the first Surveyor-General,
who was invalided, and was himself succeeded by Lieutenant John
Oxley, R.N., previously First Lieutenant of the <i>Porpoise</i>.
In 1808 Mr. Grimes acted as the Judge-Advocate at the trial of
Mr. Mc Arthur, subsequent to the deposition of Governor
Bligh.</p>
<p>Some particulars of the career of others of the early settlers
will be found in the "Van Diemen's Land Anniversary and Hobart
Town Almanac" for the year 1831, and Mr. Calder has contributed
much information on this subject to the Tasmanian Press.</p>
<p>Captain Woodriff in November 1805 made a heroic defence of the
<i>Calcutta</i> against a powerful French squadron, but was
captured and long remained a prisoner at Verdun. The
<i>Calcutta</i> was subsequently blown up in the affair of Basque
Roads. On Woodriff's release he was made a C.B. In 1839 he was
appointed to Greenwich Hospital, where he died in 1842.</p>
<p>Captain James Kingston Tuckey, the First Lieutenant of the
<i>Calcutta</i>, an officer of merit and varied services, who
wrote in a French prison and subsequently published several works
connected with geography and navigation, fell a victim to African
fever and anxiety in the conduct of an expedition to explore the
Congo. Only a few months since Stanley accomplished what was
attempted by Tuckey in 1816.</p>
<p>It remains to add a few particulars as to the discovery of
these documents.</p>
<p>"The Grimes Survey and Journal" were eventually found by me
last year in the archives of the Colonial Secretary's office at
Sydney, after a protracted and persistent search, involving I
will not say how much patience, and causing I am afraid to say
how much trouble.</p>
<p>"The General and Garrison Order Book" of Lieutenant-Governor
Collins comes from the Parliament Library of Tasmania, and was
carefully copied by Mr. G.E. Collett, the sub-librarian.</p>
<p>"The Knopwood Diary" is in the possession of Mr. V.W. Hookey,
solicitor, of Hobart Town, a family connection of one of Mr.
Knopwood's executors. By Mr. Hockey's consent, a copy of it was
made and presented to the Government of Victoria by Mr. J.E.
Calder, formerly Surveyor-General of Tasmania, whose ardour as a
collector of such matters is well and widely known, and whose
name is a sufficient guarantee for the scrupulous accuracy of the
transcript. All the foot-notes appended by that gentleman are
marked "C."</p>
<p>The portrait of Collins is from a miniature, engraved for his
own "Account of New South Wales." That of Captain Woodriff is
taken from the painting in the possession of his family at
Sydney, and for that of the Reverend Mr. Knopwood I am indebted
to the Very Reverend Canon Bromby, of Hobart Town. It is copied
from the original sketch by the late Hon. Thomas George Gregson,
of Risdon, the first ground broken in Tasmania.</p>
<p>In the search for these early historical records of Port
Phillip, the thanks of this colony are also due to Sir John
Robertson, K.C.M.G., the late Colonial Secretary, and Mr. Henry
Halloran, C.B., the late principal Under-Secretary of New South
Wales; as also to Mr. R. Adams, the Surveyor-General of that
province. I am besides much indebted to Mr. G.D. Hirst, acting
for Mrs. Woodriff, of Sydney, as well as to Mr. Alfred Kingston,
of the Public Record Office in London.</p>
<p>Of those who took part in the attempted colonization of Port
Phillip three quarters of a century ago, but three persons are
now alive, namely, the son of the Marine Sergeant Thorne above
referred to, Mr. Frank Pitt of Hobart Town, and Mr. James Hobbs
of Melbourne, whose portrait is given in this collection. At the
age of eighty-six this gentleman lives to recall the incidents of
life in the tents of Collins's Camp at the Heads, and
subsequently in the turf-built huts of Hobart Town. The son of a
Naval officer who was killed at the taking of Egypt, his mother,
on the advice of Lord Hobart, emigrated with Collins. Mr. Hobbs,
who had previously been in the Navy, joined as midshipman the
King's ship then stationed at Sydney, and his recollections of
facts connected with the conduct of Governor Bligh on board the
<i>Porpoise</i> have become historical.* As a colonist, Mr. Hobbs
had his share of the hardships of the early days. He did good
service as an explorer, and his feats against the bushrangers lie
buried in old Van Diemen's Land newspapers. He has lived to see
the country pronounced by Collins <i>uninhabitable</i> become the
most remarkable of England's colonies; and a handful of his
countrymen, on the sea-board of a continent, spread and grow into
seven great centres of civilization. In the space of the life of
a man now moving in our midst, the thing has been done, and the
predictions of poets, philosophers, and statesmen verified in the
Australasia of to-day.</p>

<p align="center">1802.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 23<i>rd November</i>.&mdash;Sailed from Sydney
Cove on board the <i>Cumberland</i>; a fine wind after we cleared
the Heads; nothing remarkable except the jolly boat drifting at
night off the Five Islands.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;Sailed along a high
shore; at night off Cape Dromedary.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Saw Cape Howe, between
which and Ram's Head there appears several spots of clear
ground.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;A gale of contrary wind;
drifting all day.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;A calm; drifting all
day.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;High wind; drifting all
day.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 29<i>th</i>.&mdash;A fine day; opposite the
same shore as on the 26th.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Got past Ram's Head.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, December</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;Went but a few
miles.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 2nd.&mdash;Calm.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Stood for Kent's Group.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Anchored in Kent's Group;
in the morning went on shore, collected some specimens and seeds,
killed some ducks and a kangaroo. One dog was bit by a snake and
died. Saw many seals and sea lions. The islands are covered with
a thick brush and oak.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Went on shore to another
island; barren; caught a kangaroo. The rock is granite. Sailed
from Kent's Group; a fine wind.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;High wind and heavy rain;
laying-to till morning.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Little wind: half knot an
hour.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Saw smoke on Elephant
Island (east coast of King Island); we did not think we were so
near land. At five p.m. saw two ships at anchor, the
<i>G&eacute;ographe and Naturaliste</i>, dropped anchor near
them. Capt. Robbins and Grimes went on board; the
<i>Naturaliste</i> sailed the same night.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Early in the morning the
captain and Mr. Grimes went to the Commodore's ship and on their
return heard that two vessels were last off the "Sisters." A
party of us went on shore; a fine sandy beach; we walked to what
is called the Great River; there is a bar at its entrance into
the sea. It is salt for a mile up when it begins to be fresh
water: we did not go far up. If the trees were cleared away boats
might go up it even at low tide. In our walk met with eight
prisoners the French Commodore had turned out of his ship. He
gave them 10lbs. of bread each; they told me that there were
there more on board. It being a rough sea it was 11 o'clock
before we got on board. Elephant Island is covered with seals and
mutton birds.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Weighed anchor and came a
few miles nearer land. The captain and Mr. Grimes dined with the
commodore; in the afternoon the boat went for an anchor stock.
McCallum, the surgeon, and self went on shore, stayed all night
at some huts belonging to the ship <i>Margaret's</i> gang.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Went a little way into the
country; being in expectation of the boats coming on shore, went
along the beach to the French tents. It is a fine sandy beach
with several runs of fresh water; the north-east part rocky. Went
on board p.m.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;High wind; a great swell; no
one on shore.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 13<i>th</i>.&mdash;The captain and Grimes dined
at the French tents. McCallum and self went on shore in the
afternoon: joined the captain and went to the huts we were at
before.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;The captain went on board;
McCallum and self examined the country a little way towards the
sea; it is high and sandy about half a mile in deep black
vegetable mould, mixed with sand; the timber small. There are the
remains of some very large gum trees, but they are all rotten;
the low ground is a little swampy. Mr. Grimes joined us in the
evening and was informed that the captain [Robbins] hoisted His
Majesty's colors behind the French tents.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;The party (seven) set off
in the morning; at three miles crossed the Great River about
three feet deep at low water travelled along a sandy beach. About
six o'clock came to a spring of water and stopped the night; high
hills and thick brush. Caught a kangaroo and three
porcupines.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Went inland; at one mile
found a fresh water lagoon; about 20 acres between it and the
shore: the ground is high and sandy. Ascended a hill where I
could see some miles. The tops of the trees appear dead and a
thick brush; all the ground is sand with black vegetable mould. I
went several times to the top of the hills; a white sand appears
on them as far as the eye could reach; there appears to be a
chain of lagoons about two miles from the sea. Came to
Coomber's[?] Bay where we stopped the night.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;A wet morning. Started about
twelve; travelled along a rocky shore; the rain and hail annoyed
us much, there being no shelter. Walked till about six o'clock
and finding no fresh water came back about a mile to a spring;
erected some bushes to protect us; stopped the night. Caught some
kangaroo; rain and hail all night. The country barren; the shore
high rocks, many of them projecting far into the sea.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Continued our course on
the rocky shore till we came to a spring, and being told by our
guide that there was no fresh water for some miles, halted. Mr.
Grimes and self went to the top of a high hill where we could see
ten miles. The land appeared barren, a scrubby brush, and but
little grass; in bottoms are many rushes.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;A wet morning. At noon
continued our march, rain and high wind. The beach sandy: came to
a salt lagoon opposite New Year's Island. Stopped the night;
caught some emus and ducks.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Mr. Grimes and men went back
to continue his survey and I went along the salt lagoon till I
came to a fresh-water river; traced it about two miles; came to a
large lagoon. At the entrance are two small islands; it appears
to be three-quarters of a mile long and three or four hundred
yards wide; it is covered with bullrushes; a hill on one side,
level on the other. Returned through the bush which is about half
a mile from the sea. There is some tolerable grass where the
brush is thin. Saw some fine trees by the river side but in every
place I have seen the large trees are decaying and fresh ones
springing up.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 21<i>st</i>.&mdash;The weather still wet. Made
a signal for the <i>George's</i> boat to come on shore as we had
no bread for some days. We moved our camp two miles further to
where the boats usually land. Mr. Grimes went on board and
procured us some biscuit until our vessel arrived.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;The wet continuing sent a
party to hunt while the others made the huts more secure. In our
journey saw many sea elephants, but few seals. The elephants are
in the greatest plenty at the mouths of fresh-water streams. The
country round this place is hill and dale, sands and vegetable
mould very light. The hunting party returned with three emus,
three porcupines, and two kangaroos.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Being a fine day went to
shew Grimes and McCallum the fresh-water lagoon, and the wind
being shifted began to expect our vessel which we did about 3
p.m. Not having seen her for eleven days we began to have serious
apprehensions of her safety.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;The <i>Cumberland</i>
anchored off New Year's Island. In the morning the boat came on
shore, I went on board; was informed she had been drifted to
Kent's Group and lay there till the wind shifted,</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Went on the islands. Their
shore is rocky, covered with seals. I came on shore with a
washing party, the captain intending to follow in the morning, to
proceed into the interior. On examining the specimens gathered at
Kent's Group found them all damaged with wet.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;The captain, and Mr. Grimes,
and the doctor came on shore in the morning; remained at marquee
all day.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Set out at six o'clock, back
the same coast we had been before. Met a hunting party sent out
the day before with four kangaroos and four badgers; stopped at
about seven miles for Mr. Grimes to continue his survey; on his
return dined. Afterwards went to a lagoon about three miles from
the sea. The road to it is through a thick brush and sandy hills.
There are some clear spots covered with rushes and appears at
times to be flooded. Dug a spot of ground and sowed some seeds.
The soil is a light black sand about 8 inches deep on the hills,
and from eighteen inches to two feet in the valleys, at bottom
white sand. At the end of the lagoon, next the sea, there are
some forest land with large gum trees; the soil sandy, and in the
marshy grounds are large fern trees with deep black soil.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Went along the side of the
lagoon a little way, it is of considerable extent. Afterwards
divided into two parties, Mr. Grimes, the doctor, and two others
to examine the lagoon; the captain, self, and two others to look
into the country. The ground is alternately forest and swampy;
the soil is shallow on the hills, and deep black earth in the
bottoms. The wood is principally blue-gum, from two to three feet
in diameter and about twenty on an acre. A little way from the
beach was taken ill by drinking some bad water. Stopped some time
behind the party. I soon recovered and arrived at headquarters
before sunset, where I found all the others arrived about two
hours before.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i> 29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Made a signal in the
morning for the boat to come on shore. Sowed some seeds, and the
boat not coming, we set off after dinner, twelve in number,
having been joined by one Smith, belonging to Cable's gang, and
two natives from Sydney. Travelled about three miles, and being
informed that we should not find water for a long way, stopped
for the night. The shore is rocky, projecting a considerable way
into the sea in many places. On our departure each man took
thirty-two biscuits with him, as we expected plenty of game. In
the evening caught three young emus, twenty-three seal, and eight
kangaroos.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i> 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;One man went back to the
tent with the emus, and we proceeded along the shore. Crossed a
fine stream of water and several springs. I am of opinion that
the springs issuing from the hills come all from lagoons in the
interior. We were joined in the afternoon by the man sent back in
the morning. This day caught four emus, three badgers, three
porcupines, and a kangaroo. The shore appears the same as on the
preceding day.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i> 31<i>st</i>.&mdash;Set out at six o'clock. At
about three miles parted, the captain, self, and three others
into the country; Mr. Grimes, the doctor, and the other five
proceeded to survey the coast. At about a mile from the sea found
a small spot of grey loam. Proceeded up a run of water the ground
swampy; came to the head of it at about half-a-mile, the ground
rising a little. Travelled about three miles over a level
country, the timber being chiefly gum and tea-tree; the soil
sandy. There have been very large trees, most of which have
fallen. The standing timber is from 60 to 100 feet high, and from
one to three feet in diameter. Returned to the beach nearly the
same road we went, and, after dinner, went to the stream of water
seen on the 30th ult. Went up it a little way, and stopped the
night.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">1803.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 1<i>st</i> (<i>Saturday</i>).&mdash;Started
early in the morning to examine another stream seen as above. The
brush was so thick that we could not proceed. It goes up between
hills, as far as we could discern, three or four miles. There is
a little waterfall near the beach. Returned back, and stopped the
night.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i> 2<i>nd</i>&mdash;Set off at eight o'clock up
another stream. There is a considerable current for about a mile,
when it became dry at bottom, soon afterwards water, at about
three miles swampy, about 18 inches deep of water, and very thick
of trees; the water began to extend a considerable width, and,
being so very thick of brush, left the swamp and went over some
dry ground for about a mile and came to a lagoon. Came up with it
at the west end. It appeared to turn to the right and left at the
east end and three-quarters of a mile long, but could not
distinctly see its form. From thence to the sea, about four
miles, is a very thick brush, with many fallen trees, which make
travelling nearly impossible. The land dry and sandy, and many
large gum trees. At five o'clock came to the place we set out
from, and stopped the night.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i> 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Started at six o'clock, and
made straight for headquarters, where we arrived between nine and
ten o'clock a.m. Made a signal for the boat to come on shore,
which soon arrived. Went on board for some necessaries, and came
back to the tent in the afternoon.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;A party of the crews of the
<i>Cumberland</i> and <i>George</i> were coming on shore for
blubber. The surf being very strong, two of the men belonging to
the latter were drowned; six more were in the water, but got safe
out. The men who perished were Cato, late gardener to Mr. Palmer,
and Emmanuel, late gunner on board the <i>Anne</i>. The day was
spent in finding them and sending them to the New Year's Island
to be buried.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i> 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Went with the captain and
two others to the lagoon seen on the 20th ult.; traced it from
end to end. At top there is a small run of water comes into it
down a sandy hollow. Went on the top of a hill and ascended a
tree; the appearance&mdash;dead-topped gum trees, sandy hills,
and thick brush. It is with the greatest difficulty that one can
pass through it. Returned in the afternoon, and found Mr. Grimes
and party returned. From what I was informed they had not been so
far as they intended to have gone when they set off.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Made a signal early in the
morning for the boat to come on shore, as we wanted some
necessaries previous to our setting off into the country. The
boat not coming, remained at marquee all the day.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Continued the signal in the
morning, and, it not coming, the captain went on board in the
<i>George's</i> boat in the evening, which came on shore for some
men that had come from Elephant Bay. They informed me that the
French commodore had sailed about eight days before, and that he
had lost two anchors and a launch. Rain and thunder p.m., with
high wind most of the night.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;The captain arrived early in
the morning, and, it being a showery day, remained at the marquee
all day.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i> 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;At nine o'clock the captain,
self, Harry, and a seaman set off with an intention to cross the
island. We went along the shore to the stream of water we were at
on the 2nd inst. Went to the lagoon we had been at before; we
came to it at another place than we had previously been at. It
appeared much larger, and fuller of tufty grass, the brush being
very thick round it, and the water only knee deep. We ventured
through it. It was nearly the same depth all the way over, which
we supposed to be about two miles. It is full of tufty grass and
bull-rushes, of a circular form. We afterwards kept an easterly
course through a level country, sometimes dry, at others swampy.
Trees small and very high, except some very large gum trees. It
rained most of the day, which made it very disagreeable
travelling. Marched till sunset, and it was with difficulty we
could make a fire.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i> 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at four o'clock in
the morning. Met with some fine land, the soil more strong and of
a loamy nature. Went over some miles of it&mdash;some of a
reddish, other of a grey cast. The trees are very high. I
measured a gum tree that appeared lately fallen; 100 yards clear
stem, and between five and six feet diameter. As near as I could
judge there are about 20 per acre. The others small and straight.
The poles are only two or three feet apart, very high and
straight, from six to eighteen inches in diameter, of various
sorts; high fern and sword-grass; a fine deep black soil. Passed
a spot of moory ground, where we saw some badgers and
kangaroos.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at six; continued
our course. The country nearly as on the preceding day. At about
two or three o'clock came to a swamp, with some very high fern
trees. A little further came to a small stream of water. Traced
it a little way, but finding it did not run directly in our
course, the captain left for about a mile, when we fell in with
it again. It was considerably larger, and I supposed it to be the
head of the Great River, which runs into Elephant Bay. We traced
it by crossing several times, there being many trees fallen
across it. At about two or three miles from the place we first
discovered it the water became salt, where the river is wider and
fit for a boat to pass, between which and the beach are several
small islands; on each side a tract of clear marsh, one side
green, the other dead rushes; the side of the marsh next the sea
hilly, the other level forest land. Saw many swans and ducks, and
at six o'clock arrived at the mouth of the river in Elephant Bay.
I suppose it may be about five miles from the place we first fell
in with it to the bay. The same night we went to Cooper's, and
stopped the night, being very tired and hungry.</p>
<p>I was informed that the French commodore took on board four of
the prisoners which he landed on our arrival and one Lyons, an
Irishman.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Set out at six o'clock,
along the shore. Walked till four o'clock, when we shot a
kangaroo. Sat down to broil it, but, the brush taking fire around
us, was obliged to move a little further, where we made another
fire; and it was our intention to have stopped the night, but,
the wind being high and the smoke troublesome, about eleven
o'clock the captain set fire to the bush, and we marched on
towards the marquee, where we arrived at four o'clock in the
morning.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i> 13<i>th</i>.&mdash;Remained at head-quarters
all the day. A party went out foraging, and returned with live
emus, two young live do., and a kangaroo.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;The boat came on shore in the
morning, and Dr. McCallum went on board, and I went into the
country with two men to get specimens of wood.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i> 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Looking over specimens and
seeds; the captain taking observations.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;The boat came on shore in the
morning, but, the wind being high and much surf, we did not go on
board.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;In the morning two men went
after some game; the boat went to the vessel with part of the
luggage, and in the afternoon returned with the <i>George's</i>
long boat, when we all went on board.</p>
<hr>
<br>
<p>As far as I went round the island the hills are high and sandy
for 2 or 3 three miles in, the brush very thick, and little
grass. The interior is level, and in many cases swampy, with
large lagoons. There is some good land in the middle of the
island, but the timber is so thick and lofty that I could form no
idea of its extent. The timber in general is gum-tree, mimosas of
sorts, some ash, cotton bark, Banksia and Rhamnus; saw no cedar.
The best place for a settlement is either in Elephant Bay or
opposite New Year's Island; but as we saw but little of the
interior there are perhaps better places. The shore is in every
place difficult of access for vessels. Elephant oil and spars are
the only articles of commerce the island produces; on the
adjacent islands there are plenty of seals.</p>
<hr>
<br>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;All hands up at daylight;
the Captain went sounding whilst the others were weighing anchor.
At half-past nine o'clock sailed from New Year's Island, and at
two saw land; supposed it to be Cape Albany (<i>Albany
Otway</i>). Our company consisted of eighteen, the captain having
taken on board Smith and Jones, who had been with us since our
arrival on the island. This day had my provision served out by
myself.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Out of sight of land; a
calm. At five p.m. saw land; at nine came to anchor.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;In the morning off high
land; the hills high and verdant. The trees inward appeared
large. There appeared an opening like a small river to the
eastward; at noon a valley with gentle rising ground, behind
which the timber appeared large. At eight o'clock anchored in
Port Phillip; hot winds most of the day.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 21<i>st</i>.&mdash;Weighed anchor early in the
morning, and came further into the bay; dropped
anchor.<sup>[1]</sup> The Captain, Mr. Grimes, doctor, and myself
went on shore, and walked across a neck of land to the
sea,<sup>[2]</sup> whilst the carpenter repaired the boat. The
land is a light, black-sand pasture, thin of timber, consisting
of gum,<sup>[3]</sup> oak, Banksia and thorn. Saw the scaites of
some lagoons, all dry except one salt one; the land is about a
mile and a half over; came on board in the afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Saturday</i>, 22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;All hands up at daylight.
The captain went sounding; on his return Mr. Grimes, doctor and
self, two marines and two assistants to the surveyor went on
shore; as we went on met with two huts, apparently built by
Europeans; a little farther met with fresh water in a swamp
<sup>[4]</sup> about fifty yards from the beach; farther on a
small run of water. The country level; timber as the preceding
day. Saw three natives at a distance; they made off as we
approached them.</p>
<p class="foot">[[4] Wannaeue (Boneo) Swamp.]</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Early in the morning the
same party as yesterday, with the addition of the captain, went
on shore; we ascended a high hill;<sup>[1]</sup> the land good
until we got near the top, where it is stony. On the north and
south sides of the hill there are from 2,000 to 3,000 acres of
good land, a specimen of which is taken. Mr. Robbins and self
went to the top of a hill;<sup>[1]</sup> it appeared fine land at
a distance, but only stones and short brush as we approached it;
saw Western Port distinctly from the top of it; we supposed it to
be about five miles from the beach. Returned through an extensive
swamp.<sup>[2]</sup> On the side of the hill met with two dingles
with some fresh water in deep holes. Mr. Grimes and the others
took another way at the bottom of the first hill; we found them
on board at our return. The country all newly burnt. Caught
plenty of fish; a shark took a mariner's jacket out of the
boat.</p>
<p class="foot">[[1] "Arthur's Seat".&mdash;[2] Wannaeue

<p><i>Monday</i>, 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;At seven o'clock the same
party as on the 22nd went to continue the survey. At three miles
a swamp, several runs of water, only one good, and all blocked up
at the beach. The rest of this day's journey hills, rocky
land,<sup>[3]</sup> light black sand, fine grass, and the trees
low and scrubby. Several dingles on the side of the hills; found
a little water in two holes.</p>
<p class="foot">[[3] Western slopes of "Arthur's Seat"

<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Having a sore foot stopped
on board. Mr. Grimes and party went on shore at the usual time,
and continued the survey till about two o'clock. From what the
doctor informed me the land as on the preceding day; looked over
seeds and specimens, &amp;c.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;The Captain, Grimes,
doctor, self, and three seamen set off for Western Port; at two
miles a swamp <sup>[4]</sup> without trees, and fine grass; over
a swell another of the same sort. Found no water till we came
near the Port; saw some ducks, which was a sign of water; made to
the place; it was salt, but I went a little further up and found
it fresh. I stopped there with one man, and the Captain, Mr.
Grimes, and another went on to the Port;<sup>[5]</sup> they got
into a swamp and did not reach the beach in two hours; they
returned, and after dinner we returned back the course we came.
Previous to our reaching the water the doctor was so fatigued for
want of water that he could not go on; he was left with a man,
gun and compass, to make the best of his way back to the vessel.
He sent the man off to the vessel for water with the gun and
compass, and he moved from the place where we left him. On our
arrival found the man but not the Doctor, and it being dark
nothing could be done till morning.</p>
<p class="foot">[[4] "The Big Swamp."&mdash; [5] Between Sandy
Point and Hastings.]</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;When four men set off to
the place where he was left, they found his fire but he was gone.
After searching all the day they arrived in the evening without
him.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;In the morning two parties
went different ways in search of the Doctor; in an hour after
they were gone saw the Doctor walking on the beach, when a boat
was sent to bring him on board. Immediately three muskatoons were
fired to bring the parties back, but they did not hear them, and
they returned in the afternoon. Thunder, high wind, some drops of
rain, and excessively hot for two days past.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 29<i>th</i>.&mdash;At eight o'clock Mr.
Grimes, self, and four others went on shore to continue the
survey from the 25th. There is a small river <sup>[1]</sup> where
we began; a little further some fresh water; crossed several
dingles, all dry. At about two o'clock came to fresh water; it
appears to be a considerable stream <sup>[2]</sup> in wet
seasons. I went but a little way in the country being alone. The
land is a light, black sandy soil, timber small and low, the
shore rocky, iron-colored stone,<sup>[3]</sup> but sand when
broken.</p>

<p><i>Sunday</i>, 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;The same party as yesterday
went on shore at eight o'clock. About a mile from the fresh water
there is a deep gully;<sup>[4]</sup> I crossed it about half a
mile from the beach; it appears to run a great way into the
country. I ascended a hill <sup>[5]</sup> where I could see eight
or ten miles, hills without trees, narrow valleys with scrubby
brush. The soil black, g[r]avelly sand; at a mile-and-a-half from
the beach a run of fresh water to a lagoon. Came to a river
<sup>[6]</sup> it Was salt; traced it to the beach; crossed it up
to the knees about a mile farther; went in about a quarter of a
mile found a fine fresh water river about 30 feet wide, and deep
enough for a boat; Mr. Grimes took the bearings of it; traced it
six or eight miles; <sup>[7]</sup> it runs in a parallel line
with the sea. Fell in with a body of natives, fourteen men,
besides women and children; they pointed to us to follow the
ship; I gave them some biscuit; some of the men gave them some
old hats and a handkerchief; they followed us a considerable way,
seemingly asking for more. There are some huts on the side of the
river. The land <sup>[8]</sup> sandy, with shell bottom; wood
small. At five o'clock got on board.</p>

<p><i>Monday</i>, 31<i>st</i>.&mdash;It looked like a wet
morning; we did not go out early. At ten o'clock the Captain,
Grimes, self, and two mariners, went on shore; crossed a neck of
land about half a mile over; went along the beach a little way
and ascended a hill; the country appearing very barren. Returned
to the vessel about one o'clock.<sup>[9]</sup></p>
<p class="foot">[[9] The Long Beach and Carrum Carrum Swamp.]</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, February</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;The same party as
before went on shore about seven o'clock to continue the survey
from 30th. There is a slip of trees from four to six chains from
the beach within which is poor sandy land with short brush, and
no trees inwards for several miles. In the afternoon the country
more woody and land something better. The day very hot, and found
no water. Saw two large emus.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;At the usual time the same
party as yesterday, with the addition of the doctor, went on
shore; for about a mile the land dry, a light sandy soil;
afterwards a large swamp, <sup>[1]</sup> with three lagoons in
it, all dry. The land appears to be covered with water in wet
seasons. Came to a salt lagoon about a mile long and a quarter of
a mile wide; had not entrance to the sea. Soon afterwards came to
a large river;<sup>[2]</sup> went up it about a mile when we
turned back and waited for the boat to take us on board. The
ground is a swamp on one side and high on the
other.<sup>[3]</sup> Saw many swans, pelicans, and ducks. Were
obliged to go up to our middle to get to the boat, and got on
board between five and six o'clock. Rain and thunder in the
night.</p>

<p><i>Thursday</i>, 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;At six o'clock the captain,
Mr. Grimes, self, and five seamen went in the boat up the Great
River; at between two and three miles it divided into
two;<sup>[4]</sup> we took the left hand stream at half-past
eight o'clock. The land became high, where we landed and went on
a hill. The soil a reddish loam from ten to fifteen inches deep.
Saw a large lagoon at a distance. Went over the hill to a large
swamp.<sup>[5]</sup> Soil black, eighteen inches, with blue clay
at bottom. No trees for many miles. Came to the boat and
proceeded on; passed two dingles; no water; came to a third where
we found some water, tvhere we dined and proceeded on. Opposite
this the land is stony soil, stiff blue clay, and no trees only
some straggling oaks by the side of the river. We went up the
river till we came to rocks;<sup>[6]</sup> could not get the boat
over; crossed it at a place the natives had made for catching
fish. It was still salt though a great fall; went about two miles
on the hills which are level at top and full of stones, the land
very bad, and very few trees, and appeared so to the mountains,
which appeared clothed with timber. On our return back came to
the river a little higher up and found it excellent fresh water,
where it divided and appeared deep enough for a boat. Just as we
got to the boat it began to thunder and rain. Stopped a little
time and came back till we could procure wood to make a fire, and
it being sunset stopped the night.</p>
<p class="foot">[[4] The Saltwater and Yarra Rivers.&mdash;[5]

<p><i>Friday</i>, 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at six and came to
the branch we passed before, at the entrance the land swampy; a
few miles up found it excellent water, where we saw a little hill
<sup>[7]</sup> and landed. The time dinner was getting ready
Messrs. Robbins, Grimes, and self went on the hill, where we saw
the lagoon <sup>[8]</sup> seen from the hill where we first
landed. It is in a large swamp between the two rivers; fine
grass, fit to mow; not a bush in it. The soil is black rich earth
about six to ten inches deep, when it is very hard and stiff. It
is better farther back. About two miles further went on shore
again; the land much better and timber larger. Soil black, ten to
fifteen inches deep; bottom sand or gravel. I went to the other
side where the ground was the same; went in about two miles; it
began to rain. I returned to the boat and after dinner we all got
on board and arrived on board the vessel at dusk. Saw a canoe and
two native huts.</p>

<p><i>Saturday</i>, 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Early in the morning the
captain went with some casks for water to the place we were at
the preceding day; they returned in the evening. Mr. Grimes and
the doctor were on shore but returned in about an hour.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;The captain, Mr. Grimes, and
self went up the river opposite to the place that the survey was
left off on the 2nd.<sup>[1]</sup> The Captain sounded the mouth
of the river; the other party along the shore. I went up a creek
<sup>[2]</sup> about a mile and a half; it was salt, and ended in
a swamp; a run from the plains comes into it in wet weather.
There is a few trees by the sea side; behind, a level plain to
the mountains. Soil six inches deep of stiff black earth, white
clay at bottom, and many large stones. The country appears the
same for fifteen or twenty miles.</p>
<p class="foot">[[1] Footscray.&mdash;[2] Stony Creek.]</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Early in the morning the
party that went up the river before with the doctor went up to
the little hill <sup>[3]</sup> we had been at on the 4th, when we
stopped to breakfast; proceeded on to a creek,<sup>[4]</sup>
where we dined. Saw some natives. The land in general is a fine
black soil, ten to eighteen inches deep. Timber; gum, Banksia,
oak, and mimosa of sorts, but not large except the gum. The river
appears to rise to the height of eight or ten feet at times by
wreck on the trees. Went alternately into the land on both sides
the river; it continued nearly of the same quality. The greatest
part of the land is above the floods. Proceeded on till sunset;
stopped the night.</p>
<p class="foot">[[3] Batman's Hill.&mdash;[4] Gardiner's

<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Sowed some seeds by the
natives' hut, where we slept. Continued our course up the river;
the land high; rocks by side of the river; it is a freestone, the
strata on edge. Came to a fall,<sup>[5]</sup> where we could not
get the boat over. We went inland a little way. It is stony,
about six inches black stiff soil, white clay at bottom. Mr.
Robbins got up a tree; saw it to be gently rising hills, clothed
with trees, for ten or fifteen miles. A little above the fall
there is a small island, and the river divides in two. The timber
in general is gum, oak, and Banksia; the two latter are small;
the gum two to four feet diameter, and from ten to thirty feet
high; on some of the low ground they are something larger. We
were not more than half a mile from the river. Returned back, and
crossed a neck of land 330 paces over <sup>[6]</sup> whilst the
boat went round. Came to our old station at the large lagoon. I
went about two miles inland and fell in with seven natives. I saw
Messrs. Robbins, Grimes, and McCallum, at the lagoon. From the
hill saw the vessel; returned to the river, and after dinner set
out for the vessel, where we arrived about seven o'clock; the
land at two miles inland is of a better quality than the
specimen.</p>
<p class="foot">[[5] Dight's Falls.&mdash;[6] Studley Park.]</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Continued the survey from
the mouth of the river.<sup>[7]</sup> The land for two or three
miles is a gentle rise from the beach, which is muddy, with large
stones; the land stiff clay, the stone appearing at top; a little
further, near the beach, a swamp light black sand, white shells
at bottom. There is a slip of trees about half a mile from the
beach, then a clear level plain to the mountains, which I suppose
to be fifteen or twenty miles. Passed two inlets of salt water.
Got on board at two.</p>
<p class="foot">[[7] Williamstown.]</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;At six o'clock the same
party went on shore. The slip of trees by the beach continued
about a mile, when the shore became more high, about eight or ten
feet above high water mark; we proceeded on for four or five
miles, and the wind being contrary we observed the vessel "bring
to", and we walked back and got on board about three o'clock.
Several nautilus shells picked up.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;At eight o'clock the
captain, doctor, self, and carpenter, went on shore. We observed
a hill at a distance and made to it; we crossed the two runs seen
<sup>[1]</sup> on the 9th; one ends in a swamp, the other salt
water where we crossed it, the country very level, some plains,
stony, and much water to lodge in it in wet weather. Went to the
top of the hill; it is stony; could see about ten miles around us
a level plain <sup>[2]</sup> with a few straggling bushes. The
face of the ground is one-third grass, one-do. stone, and one-do.
earth, mostly newly burnt. Returned back nearly the same course,
and found some brackish water in one of the runs we crossed
before. Got on board about three o'clock.</p>
<p class="foot">[[1] Koroit and Skeleton Creeks.&mdash;[2]

<p><i>Saturday</i>, 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Anchor up at sunrise;
proceeded up the bay opposite to the place where the survey was
left off on the 10th,<sup>[3]</sup> the vessel being about the
middle of the bay. We crossed over in the boat to the other
shore. The party consisted of the captain, Mr. Grimes, the
doctor, self, and seven seamen and marines&mdash;in all eleven,
with four days' provisions; got on shore at five o'clock. I went
on the top of a hill, where the land is good and fine pasture
from ten to eighteen inches deep, fine black earth with white
sandy clay or gravel bottom. The timber small and the same as
before-mentioned. Came up with the doctor, and we went about two
miles in, the country appearing the same.</p>
<p class="foot">[[3] Point Cook.]</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 13<i>th</i>.&mdash;Set out at six o'clock, the
captain and three men in the boat, the rest on shore. The land
and timber is of the same quality for several miles, and there
are five dingles, which are runs of water in wet seasons, but all
dry. The shore became swampy. Crossed the mud up to the knees; it
continued low and muddy a considerable way. We stopped and dined
opposite to a salt lagoon; started soon after, having but little
water. The swamp continued for some miles farther, when I saw a
high point of land, which I crossed, and it being near sunset
stopped the night. We dug for water, but it was salt; we had not
half a pint per man.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Continued our course as soon
as it was light. A large swamp two or three thousand acres, a
brush of saltwort. Crossed two places up to the middle. Came to a
fine green hill, very fine land, eighteen inches deep of rich
black soil. The captain went on before in search of water, but
found none. I crossed over the hill to the beach, and found an
acid spring. Hailed the boat, and the surveyor came up about ten
o'clock, when we breakfasted, and filled the cask and proceeded
on. The land behind the hill high and woody. Came round to a
river;<sup>[1]</sup> went up it about a mile in company with the
doctor. At the end of the salt water found a hole made by
natives; drank of it and returned back to the beach where the
boat had "brought up". I went back to the hole and dug it larger,
and brought some of the water. The land is not of so good a
quality after I crossed the river; timber small and crooked,
mostly oak and Banksia.</p>
<p class="foot">[[1] The Werribee.]</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;In the morning two men went
for some water; set out about eight o'clock. I went over a plain
and met with a river;<sup>[2]</sup> went up about a mile and a
half; it continued salt and wide. Returned to the beach, where
the party was waiting for the boat to take them over; it being
low water the boat could not get up; crossed it up to the middle
and a little further, dined. Proceeded on round a
point,<sup>[3]</sup> the land stony and no wood; came to a swamp
and another river.<sup>[4]</sup> I did not go up it as it was
near night. Had much difficulty to find wood.</p>
<p class="foot">[[2] The Little River.&mdash;[3] Point
Wilson.&mdash;[4] Duck Ponds.]</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Breakfasted before
daylight. The captain and crew went back to the native hole for
water, whilst the others proceeded on the land. Swamps, with
gentle rising stony ground; some scaites of lagoons and small
runs, all dry. About two o'clock the boat came up with us; our
provision was all out. We had got four geese; stopped and dressed
them and walked on till sunset; a bad fire this night. Five
pounds of bread per week. Passed three islands, one large and two
small;<sup>[5]</sup> some mangroves on the large island, only a
few scattered trees on the plain. Many swans, ducks, and
luggs.</p>
<p class="foot">[[5] Bird Rock.]</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;A. bad fire and swampy
beach this night. Had about 1 lb. of flour; boiled it for our
breakfast for all hands. Mr. Grimes would not go any farther
without provision; the captain went off to the vessel for some,
and inadvertently took what water we had left with him. Mr.
Grimes called him back, got the water in a camp kettle, and
proceeded on about a mile. Came to a river <sup>[6]</sup> went up
it about two miles in company with the doctor, where we found
excellent fresh water. There is no run above the fresh water,
only some pools; it appeared to be a considerable run in wet
seasons. Crossed over to the other side, and came opposite to Mr.
Grimes and party, and they went round. The land was a little
better by the river side, but swampy near the sea. Proceeded on
to another river; it ended in a swamp about a mile up. Soon after
the boat returned from the ship, when we sat down to dinner.
Afterwards continued our march to another large
river.<sup>[7]</sup> The boat being at hand, it took over Mr.
Grimes and his party; he proceeded to the place where he left off
on the 10th, and I went up the river a little way in the boat. It
is the second in size we have met with. The captain did not think
fit to go further, and we returned and were soon joined by the
surveyor, &amp;c. Got on board about seven o'clock.</p>
<p class="foot">[[6] Duck Ponds.&mdash;[7] Cowie's Creek.]</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Anchor up at sunrise; came
opposite the place we slept on the 12th inst. As we went out of
the boat eleven natives met us; they were very civil. I gave one
of them a biscuit; he looked at it; I took it again, eat of it,
when he did the same; whatever we said they said it after us.
There was one who appeared to be their chief. They handed us
their spears to look at; one of them was barbed and one with two
prongs. They followed us as we went on, and Mr. Grimes seemed
much frightened and hailed the boat to follow us; when the boat
came up we went on board. I made signs for them to come into the
boat, but they would not venture. <i>Two of them appeared to be
marked with the smallpox</i>. After dinner we went on shore with
an additional guard; they all met us again. Gave them some fish,
a tomahawk, and an old hat; they put our hands to their breast,
and looked into my haversack. The boat loitered behind us, and
the sailors said that they took the lead-line and a hoe out of
the boat, and some fish; got the line again but not the hoe. The
land is a light sand from the point of the hill, and in some
places swampy; the timber something larger, consisting of gum,
oak, Banksia, and mimosa, some small pine, one half of it dead by
the country being lately burnt. Got on board at dusk.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Weighed anchor at
daylight; came opposite to the place we left last night. Dropped
anchor and breakfasted. Got on shore about nine o'clock. The
beach muddy; the land a swamp, timber as before. Came opposite to
an island.<sup>[1]</sup> The vessel "brought to," and we went on
board about one o'clock. Soon after our arrival on shore two of
the natives we had seen on the preceding day came to us. They
looked much at my buttons; I cut two off and gave each of them
one, and some biscuit. They went with us upwards of a mile and
returned. After dinner Mr. Grimes went to take some bearings, and
the captain to sound.</p>
<p class="foot">[[1] Swan Island.]</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;All hands on board till
after dinner. The captain went to sound, and arrived at dusk.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 21<i>st</i>.&mdash;Anchor up at daylight;
dropped ditto at about seven. The captain, Mr. Grimes, and a
party of seamen and marines, went on shore; we were now in sight
of the entrance of the port. Mr. Robbins told me not to go on
shore; it began to blow and rain, and they all came on board at
two o'clock.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Weighed anchor at sunrise,
and came to the opposite shore. Mr. Grimes and assistants went to
finish the survey on the south-east point of the entrance; the
captain to sound. They returned on board about four p.m.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Weighed anchor about
seven o'clock, and came opposite to the watering place. The
wooding and watering parties went on shore. I went to examine the
run of water; it was dry, except a small pond near the beach.
Traced the run about a quarter of a mile; it ends in a lagoon,
which was dry.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;All hands wooding,
watering, and washing. I sowed a variety of seeds by the watering
place; the land is light and sandy. I went towards the bottom of
Arthur's Seat, and met with lagoon with fresh water. The captain
and Mr. Grimes came on shore in the evening, and all hands got on
board at dusk.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;About nine o'clock the
captain. Grimes, and doctor went to examine a shoal and take some
bearings; they came on board about two, and in the afternoon some
of the crew went on shore to finish their washing. About ten at
night the man on watch observed the small boat gone; the
whaleboat was immediately sent in search of her.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;About four o'clock in the
morning the party that went in search of the boat returned
without her, when another party was sent at daylight. The captain
saw the boat at a small distance from the vessel; weighed anchor
and took her in tow, and made a signal for the whaleboat to come
alongside. Dropped anchor, and after breakfast the captain and
Mr. Grimes went on shore; they returned about one, and in the
afternoon weighed anchor and dropped down to the Heads and took
in the whaleboat.</p>

<br>
<p>The most eligible place for a settlement that I have seen is
on the <span class="a">Freshwater River</span> [<i>Yarra</i>]. In
several places there are small tracts of good land, but they are
without wood and water. I have every reason to think that there
is not often so great a scarcity of water as at present from the
appearance of the herbage. The country in general is excellent
pasture and thin of timber, which is mostly low and crooked. In
most places there is fine clay for bricks, and abundance of
stone. I am of opinion that the timber is better both in quality
and size further up the country, as I saw some what is called ash
on the banks of the Freshwater River, and the hills appear to be
clothed with wood. As to the quantity of good land at the
different places, I shall be better able to describe when I am
favored with a sight of a chart, as I have not been permitted to
see one since I came out. There is great plenty of fish in
<span class="a">Port King</span>. The country in general is newly
burnt.</p>
<hr>
<br>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Anchor up at sunrise;
cleared the Heads between seven and eight o'clock; about one off
Western Port; a fine breeze in the afternoon.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;The breeze continued all
night. This morning saw Wilson's Promontory, Rock Dunder
(<i>Rodondo</i>), Curtis's Island, with several small islands. A
fine breeze all the day; at night out of sight of land.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, March</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;A calm in the morning;
about noon saw land from the mast-head, supposed to be Point
Hicks. Contrary wind all day.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;In the morning saw Ram's
Head. The shore from Point Hicks to Ram's Head is sand hills,
further inland high hills covered with timber. The wind continued
at north-east, and soon after twelve lay to, there being a wind
and sea; out of sight of land at dusk.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;The wind abated in the
night. At sunrise opposite to the shore we were at when the
vessel lay to; a calm hazy day; could see little of the
shore.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;About eight o'clock the wind
shifted to the south; in the afternoon a fine breeze from
south-west. Day hazy. This day Mr. Robbins called me down to the
cabin to acquaint Mr. Grimes with the quality of the land and
timber in Port King. I looked over the chart and had a glance of
the chart of King's Island.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;A fine southerly breeze at
daylight; going four and a half knots, increased to five and a

<p>The Commissary is directed to issue, until further orders, the
following ration weekly:&mdash;To civil, military, and free
settlers&mdash;beef, 7 lbs.; or pork, 4 lbs.; biscuit, 7 lbs.;
flour, 1 lb.; sugar, 6 ozs. To women, two-thirds; children, above

<p>A copper will be immediately erected for the convenience of
cooking, and persons appointed to dress the provisions, which are
to be ready every day at twelve o'clock.</p>
<p>Half a pint of spirits is allowed to the military daily.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><i>Garrison Orders.</i></p>
<p>A guard, consisting of 1 sergt., 1 corp., and 12 privates,
will mount daily in front of the marine encampment. Officers for
the duty this day, 1st Lt. Johnson; to-morrow, 2nd Lt. Lord.</p>
<p>The centinels at the different posts will be at all times
vigilant and careful to preserve peace and good order. After the
beating of the taptoo, they are not to allow any (the night watch
which will be appointed excepted) to pass without the
countersign. All prisoners taken during the night are to be sent
to the quarter guard. The centinels at the landing place will not
suffer any spirituous liquors to be landed at, or near their
post, without a written permit signed by the Lieut.-Governor, and
they are not to prevent any military or civil officer, or free
settler, from going into a boat, or on board of ships at anchor
in the harbour, but other persons, if employed by an officer, are
to produce a pass, signed by the officer, which is to be given to
the centinel, and by him to be delivered to the sergt. of the
guard. The greatest attention to be paid to this order. The
morning parade will beat at nine o'clock, the evening at sunset.
Taptoo will be beat at nine o'clock. The orderly drum every day

<p align="center"><i>General Orders.</i><br>
Parole&mdash;Calcutta.    C. Sign&mdash;Woodriff.</p>
<p>The following working hours are established until further
orders:&mdash;From sunrise in the morning (at which time the drum
will beat) until noon (excepting half an hour at eight), and from
one o'clock until sunset, at which time the people, wherever
employed, will bring in their tools, and deposit them under the
inspection of the superintendents and overseers, in such places
as they shall point out.</p>
<p align="center"><i>Garrison Orders.</i></p>
<p>The officer of the day will occasionally visit the working
parties, and report what he may there observe to the Governor.
The centinel at the store tents is, upon no account whatever, to
permit anyone but the Commissary, and the persons immediately
employed under him, to enter therein (the Lieut.-Governor
excepted). This is to be a standing-order which is never to be
disobeyed. The centinels at the landing place are at all times to
preserve regularity while the stores are delivering. They are not
to allow any stragglers near their post, and only such as may be
under the direction of an overseer. The Commanding Officer is
pleased to appoint 1st Lt. Sladden to do the duty of Adjutant,
and 1st Lt. Johnson that of Quarter-master to the detachment,
until further orders. Officers for duty this day, 2nd Lt. Lord;
for to-morrow, 1st Lt. Johnson.</p>

<p align="center"><i>General Orders.</i><br>
Parole&mdash;Port Jackson.    C. Sign&mdash;King.</p>
<p>The settlers and prisoners are not to make fires near the
encampment, but in such places as will be pointed out to them by
Lt. Johnson; the tents being all pitched, an accident happening
unto one, it could not be replaced. The centinels have orders to
stop all prisoners found out of their tents after 9 o'clock at
night, and bring them to the quarter guard. Mr. John Ingle is
appointed inspector of public mechanics and artificers, until
further orders.</p>
<p align="center"><i>Garrison Orders.</i></p>
<p>The Lt.-Colonel on taking command of the detachment of Royal
Marines, landed at Port Phillip, entertains a hope that they will
all feel a just sense of the honorable situation in which they
are placed. They have been selected by their Sovereign to compose
the garrison for the protection of this infant settlement. He
trusts this will stimulate them to use their best exertions, and
enable the Lt.-Colonel to report to the Secretary of State that
such a trust has not been unworthily placed in them. He hopes
they all know that obedience to orders, sobriety, and
cleanliness, form the essential points in the character of a good
soldier. While he observes that these are attended to, he shall
feel a pride in having them under his command, and shall hold it
his duty, by every means in his power, to render their situation
comfortable. He is unwilling to mention the word punishment, but
it is necessary they should know his firm determination to have
the strictest obedience paid to such orders as he may think
proper to give from time to time for their regulation, and trusts
that when at a future period this shall be joined by other
detachments of their brave comrades, he shall be able with
pleasure to hold up this small band as an example worthy their
imitation. The officer of the day will have the charge of the
guards, and once during the night will go the visiting rounds. A
patrol of a corpl. and two privates will occasionally, between
the relief of the centinels, go round the encampment and take up
all persons that they may find after the taptoo has beat, and
bring them to the quarter guard. The detachment off duty will
parade for drill at seven o'clock every morning at seven o'clock
(Sundays excepted), if the weather will admit. The civil and
military officers wanting the countersign may have it on
application to Lt. Sladden. The quarter guard to be augmented by
three privates to-morrow; the additional centinel is for the
preservation of two water casks at the watering place, which are
appropriated solely to the use of the civil and military
establishment.</p>

offered by the prisoner, he was recommended by the court to the
clemency of the Commanding Officer, which recommendation he was
pleased to confirm, and the prisoner was restored to his former

<p>The presence of the officer of the clay being at all times
indispensably requisite in the camp, he is not, on any pretence,
to quit it without the knowledge of the Commanding Officer. The
comfort and appearance of the military depending much upon their
cleanliness, The Eight Honourable the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty were pleased to admit a certain number of women to
accompany their husbands on the present expedition, for the
purpose of contributing to that end, by washing for the
detachment. The Commanding Officer therefore directs and appoints
the following women to be so employed, and in the following
manner, namely:&mdash;The wife of William Bean, pte., to wash for
fifteen persons; the wife of George Carley, pte., to wash for
fifteen persons; the wife of James Spooner, to wash for fourteen
persons; and as an ample supply of necessaries has been sent out
with the detachment, he will not admit of any excuse for their
appearing in a dirty, unsoldierlike manner, discreditable to
themselves and to the corps to which they belong. The different
packages and cases in which the marine stores and clothing are
contained, are not, on any account, when emptied, to be destroyed
or converted to any other use without the approbation of the
Commanding Officer. The detail for duty.</p>

<p>As it is evident that the care and propagation of live stock
is of the greatest importance in an infant settlement, the
Lieut.-Governor hopes he need not suggest to anyone the necessity
of preserving what has been landed, but that there may be
acquired as speedily as circumstances will allow a stock
competent in itself to supply the settlement with animal food, he
is under the necessity of directing that no part of the live
stock belonging to individuals&mdash;sheep, swine, goats or
poultry&mdash;be slaughtered or exported from the settlement
until further orders, without his knowledge and approbation. A
return of live stock in the possession of individuals of every
description, to be delivered to the Commissary immediately.</p>

<p>The Commissary will issue the undermentioned clothing to each
male convict to-morrow morning, at nine o'clock, for which
purpose they will all attend at the provision stores at that

<p>The Lieut.-Governor thinks it necessary to inform the people
that the clothing which was issued to them this morning is to
serve them for the ensuing six months (the article of shoes
excepted), and that until the expiration of that time no more
will be issued to them on any account. It therefore becomes the
duty of every man that regards his own comforts to take the
utmost care of his clothing, and the Lt.-Governor expects that
they will be at all times ready to produce them when he shall
call upon them for that purpose. He has remarked that several of
the tents are much dirtied and blackened at the entrance; as
others are clean; this must proceed from the dirtiness of the
persons themselves who live in them. He therefore gives this
notice, that the next tent which he finds in that state will be
instantly taken away and sent to the public stores. The overseers
will attend to this order, and see that no dirt or rubbish is
left in the streets of the encampment.</p>

superintendents, overseers, and others, in whom a trust is
placed, to use their utmost endeavors to detect the practice of
gambling, which, he understands, exists among the convicts, a
crime, so big in itself with their certain ruin, it is his duty
to prevent by every means in his power; and if his positively
forbidding them to gamble is not sufficient, he will most
certainly punish every man that has been guilty of it in
opposition to his order.</p>

quartermaster is not to issue the allowance of spirits to

<p>The Lieut.-Governor is concerned to learn that six men have
been so blind to their own welfare, as to absent themselves from
the settlement, and proceed in the desperate undertaking of
travelling round to Port Jackson. If such is actually the motive
of their absenting themselves, they must inevitably be lost in
the attempt, and nothing more will ever be heard of them, for,
independent of the risk they run of being killed by the natives,
it is impossible for them with any quantity of provisions they
could carry, to endure the fatigue of penetrating a thousand
miles through the woods of this country, for such would be the
distance, which by rounding the heads of the different harbours
that present themselves in their route, they would have to
travel. Although caution to them is now useless, yet it may not
prove so to those who remain. He therefore takes this occasion of
informing them, that while admitting the probability of their

<p>The Lieut.-Governor having received such information from the
commander of His Majesty's ship <i>Calcutta</i> as leads him to
suppose that a large body of natives is at no very great distance
from the settlement; and as it is very doubtful for what may be
their motive for coming on this side of Arthur's Seat, he thinks
it necessary to caution the convicts and other persons against
going in that direction any distance along the beach in search of
fish in their leisure hours. He hopes that the punishment
inflicted on Thursday last on the five delinquents who had
absconded will have its weight with all those who witnessed it.
If any should still intend to quit the settlement in the same
manner, he will call to their observation the wretched appearance
of Hangan and his two associates, who returned to their duty on
Friday night, by whose account they will find that when engaged
in a perilous undertaking of that nature they cannot trust even
one another, these people all declaring that while they were sent
to procure water for the whole party those who remained took that
opportunity of absconding with the provisions which they had left
in their care, perfectly indifferent as to what might prove their
fate. Such treachery must excite the honest indignation of every
well-disposed mind, and the Lieut.-Governor thinks that that
alone should be sufficient to deter others from associating in so
rash and hazardous an enterprize. If they imagine that the
masters of ships in quitting this port will receive any persons
on board without the Lieut.-Governor's licence, let them be
undeceived by his assurance that the owners and masters of ships
sent out to this country are bound by their charter parties to
Government in such heavy penalties, if known to take away one
individual without a certificate that he has permission to do so,
that it cannot be their interest to incur the forfeiture of them.
He therefore hopes that he shall not hear any more of absconding
from the settlement.</p>

<p>It having been mentioned to the Lt.-Governor, that many of the
people not adverting to the consequences, are daily bringing
birds' nests into the encampment, containing either eggs, or
young unfledged birds. He thinks it necessary to prohibit a
practice at once so cruel and destructive; any person found
offending against this order will be punished. It appearing by
the proceedings of a Court-martial, held yesterday, that two of
the convicts, and one of their wives had purchased articles from
a soldier belonging to the detachment of Royal Marines, the
Lieutenant-Governor informs them that they are not to have any
dealings or transactions whatsoever, with the military, who have
not anything of their own to dispose of, and assures them that he
shall always consider the purchasers of such articles as greater

irregularities which must ensue, if once such an evil is

place than the one opposite the eastern angle of the battery in
Sullivan Bay for boats belonging to ships, or vessels of any
description, except when on business of particular emergency, it
should be absolutely necessary for there to have communication
with the settlement, and which could not be effected at the
established landing, they may in such case be permitted to go
round to the adjoining bay, where the sentinel will suffer them
to land. The sentinel at the battery will, on perceiving a boat
proceeding round the eastern point of the bay, immediately
acquaint the officer of the guard therewith, who will communicate
the same to the Lieut.-Governor. And no boat is to come to or go
from the landing place after the taptoo has beat upon any account
without his knowledge, or in case of his absence the knowledge of
the officer second in command. This is to be considered a

<p>The Commissary will immediately make a return to the
Lieut.-Governor of the numbers of all descriptions of people in
the colony, distinguishing them as civil, military, free
settlers, free women, and prisoners, in order to enable him to
make a distribution of them for the first embarkation in the
<i>Ocean</i> transport for Van Dieman's Land.</p>
<p>The master of that ship having having informed the
Lieut.-Governor that he shall be ready to receive the cargo on
Friday morning, Mr. Clark, the superintendent, will select two
able gangs of fifteen men each, under the overseers Joseph Meyers
and John Whitehead, who are to attend every day at the store and
the jetty, and assist in removing the provisions, &amp;c., to the
boats. The Commissary will make such, preparations at the store
as will prevent any delay occurring in the removal of the various
articles under his charge. Mr. Ingle will attend at the beach,
and take the utmost care that none of the bale goods, dry
provisions, or cases of tools and ironmongery receive any damage
by the water. The superintendant, Patterson, will attend at the
stores and direct the gang placed there. The Lieut.-Governor
expects to see the same regularity and order preserved in these
gangs that he noticed while the ships were unloading. All tools
that are in the possession of individuals are to be forthwith
sent to the public store, in order to their being packed up. The
Commissary will issue to each person in the settlement (women and
children excepted, to whom he will serve only the usual
proportion), one pound of raisins on the provision day next
before Christmas, on which day Divine service will be performed
in the forenoon, if the weather permits.</p>
<p align="center"><i>Garrison Orders.</i></p>
<p>The quartermaster will take the necessary measures for having

order to their possessing the same again wherever they may be
landed. Detail for duty.</p>

<p>A daring robbery having been committed on Sunday morning in
the Commissary's tent, and the sick having been at the same time
meanly plundered of their provisions in their tents by some
person or persons at present unknown, the Lieut.-Governor calls
upon all the well-disposed persons in the settlement to aid and
assist in bringing the offender or offenders to justice; and he
is hereby pleased to promise to procure from His Excellency the
Governor-in-Chief a conditional pardon for any prisoner who shall
bring forward and prosecute to conviction any person or persons
who have been guilty of these outrages. The Lieut.-Governor, in
the most positive manner, forbids the prisoners from going to the
sea shore after crayfish between sunset and sunrise; and as they
will in future be regularly mustered during the night, any person
found absent from his tent will be severely punished, unless he
can satisfactorily account for such offence. The following
persons are established as a night watch and patrol until further
orders. They will apprehend and lodge in the quarter-guard all
such suspicious persons whom they may meet between the
above-mentioned hours; the principal of the watch reporting in
the morning his proceedings during the night to the Revd. Mr.
Knopwood:&mdash;Wm. Thomas Stocker, Principal; John Sculler,
Patk. McCarty, James Taylor, John Flinders. It is recommended to
the prisoners to be careful in securing their provisions from
depredation during the night, as no loss so occasioned can in
future be made good from the stores. The surgeon will furnish a
return of the expenditure of medicines and hospital stores and of
the actual number of persons who have been under medical
treatment from the day of our landing to the 31st instant, both
inclusive. The Commissary will also make a return of the quantity
of provisions and clothing issued by him within the above
period.</p>
<p align="center"><i>Garrison Orders.</i></p>
<p>The persons of those who are appointed as a watch during night
by the General Orders of this day being well known to the
sentinels they will, on challenging them and being answered
"Night watch," not demand the countersign, but let them pass on,
being satisfied that they are the persons so appointed, and the
sentinel and guard will at all times give them such assistance as
they may require for the apprehension of offenders. The sentence
of the Court Martial held this day will be put in execution
to-morrow morning at six o'clock.</p>

<p>The indulgence which was granted to certain convicts of
erecting and residing in huts without the encampment having been
abused, the Lieut.-Governor is under the necessity of directing
their being pulled down, and the owners thereof immediately
classed to tents. The Commissary will issue the provisions to the
prisoners (such persons only excepted as the Lieut.-Governor may
point out) daily until further orders; the serving hour to be at
seven o'clock in the evening, when the people leave off work.
This measure is adopted to prevent their being robbed at any time

loss.</p>

<p>The quartermaster will give in a return the 31st of this mouth

the detachment; the return will specify the expenditure, receipt,
and remains. A Garrison Court Martial will assemble to-morrow, at
eleven in the forenoon, at the mess room for the trial of such
prisoners as may be brought before it:&mdash;1st-Lieut. Sladden,
president; 1st-Lieut. Johnson, 2nd-Lieut. Lord, members. The

The commanding officer is concerned to observe the shameful
conduct of several of the soldiers of the detachment. Drunkenness
is a crime that he never will pass over, and to prevent as far as
in him lies their disgracing themselves, and the royal and
honorable corps to which they belong, by incurring the censure of
Courts Martial, he directs that in future their allowance of
watered spirits shall not be taken to their tents, but drank at
the place where it is mixed, in the presence of the officer of
the day. If this regulation shall be found insufficient he
assures them that the first man who is found guilty of
drunkenness by a Court Martial shall never again receive the
allowance of spirits.<br>

<p>The Lieut.-Governor is under the necessity of directing that
the business of loading the <i>Ocean</i> be not suspended until
that is completed.</p>
<p>The people will therefore work the remainder of this day and
Sunday. It has never been his wish to make that day any other
than a day of devotion and rest, but circumstances compel him to
employ it in labor. In this the whole are concerned, since the
sooner we are enabled to leave this unpromising and unproductive
country the sooner shall we be able to reap the advantages and
enjoy the comforts of a more fertile spot, and, as the winter
season will soon not be far distant, there will not be too much
time before us wherein to erect more comfortable dwellings for
every one than the thin canvass coverings which we are now under,
and which are every day growing worse. Several people applying to
him daily for shoes, he informs them that on the arrival of the
whole at the new settlement shoes shall be served out to all
those who have not lately been supplied with new ones, and
advises them to take care of those they have now got, not wearing
them until they are past mending, which some of them have done.
He cannot but pity the delusion which some of the prisoners
labour under, in thinking that they can exist when deprived of
the assistance of Government. Their madness will be manifest to
themselves when they shall feel, too late, that they have wrought
their own ruin. After those who have absconded he shall make no
further search, certain that they must soon return or perish by
famine.</p>

<p>The arms belonging to the detachment being frequently in want
of repair, which can alone proceed from the carelessness of the
men, the Commanding Officer forbids their being taken to pieces
for the purpose of cleaning but by the consent of the officer
under whose inspection they are placed, and in the presence of a
non-commissioned officer, who will take care that no part of the
arms is unnecessarily removed. These are to be kept at all times
ready for service, and he is certain that if this order is
strictly attended to the arms will not be in such frequent want
of repair; and he shall in future direct stoppages to be made for
the repair of such arms as shall appear to him to have been
damaged by carelessness; nor are they on any account to be taken
out or used but on duty. He is concerned to observe that some of
the non-commissioned officers are so extremely inattentive to
their duty as to bring the men to the parade in a slovenly and
unsoldierlike state. It is their peculiar duty to inspect the men
on the beating of the quarter-drum and to report them to the
officer of the company when they find their appearance to be
unmilitary. He should feel much regret at bringing a
non-commissioned officer to a court-martial, but as the service
cannot be carried on without they attend to their duty, so shall
he feel it his to have only good and attentive men in that very
useful class of soldiers. It is again ordered that none of the

<p>The Lieut.-Governor hopes the return of Danl. McAllenon will
have convinced the prisoners of the misery that must ever attend
those who are mad enough to abscond from the settlement. To warn
them from making an attempt of a similar nature they are informed
that, although this man left his companions on the fifth day
after their departure hence, they all began to feel the effects
of their imprudence, and more of them would have returned had
they not dreaded the punishment which they were conscious they
deserved. Their provisions were nearly expended, and they had no
resources. They lived in constant dread of the natives, by whose
hands it is more than probable they have by this time perished,
or if this should not have happened, how is it possible that
strong hardy men who were always able to consume even more than
the liberal allowance of provisions which is issued to them, can
exist in a country which nowhere affords a supply to the
traveller. The Lieut.-Governor can by no means account for this
strange desertion of the people; were they ill-treated, scantily
fed, badly clothed, or wrought beyond their ability, he should
attribute it to these causes, but as the reverse is the case, he
is at a loss to discover the motive. He thinks it necessary to
advise them not to harbour or supply with their provisions any
people who may quit the settlement, as it is his fixed
determination to punish them with greater severity than he would
the infatuated wretches themselves. He is concerned that the
several prisoners who are now absent must be left to perish, as
by McAllenon's account they are beyond the reach of every effort
he might make to recall them to their duty. Divine service will
be performed on Sunday next if the weather permits.</p>

on the prisoners James Read and Robert Andrews will deter them
from such unsoldierlike conduct in future, is pleased to remit
the remainder of the punishment which they were sentenced to
receive, and directs them to be released and return to their
duty. He trusts that this lenity will be accepted by them as it

<p>The whole number of prisoners embarked in the <i>Ocean</i>
(the officers' servants excepted) will be distributed into three
divisions, one of which will be upon deck at a time in the same
manner as seamen are divided into watches, and for the same
period of time. The several overseers who are with the people
will see that the watches are regularly relieved; and the watch
or division upon deck, during either day or night, must not upon
any account go below until relieved. They will at all times give
such assistance towards carrying on the duty of the ship as may
be required of them by Captain Mertho, or any of his officers.
The division which is upon deck during the morning watch will
wash and clean themselves upon the forecastle, and as these
several regulations are calculated for their health and
convenience the Governor expects a due observance of them. The
three men who were on board, late belonging to the 25th Foot,
will be classed one to each watch, and will perform the same duty
which they were entrusted with at Sullivan Bay.</p>

<p align="center">H.M. Ship <i>Calcutta</i>, at anchor, Santa
Cruz Roads, Teneriffe, May 1803.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 16. At 3 the <i>Ocean</i> came to an anchor. At
5 Capt. Woodriff, Col. Collins and self went on shore to Mr.
Armstrong's, the British Agent, &amp;c., &amp;c. He lives as you
enter the town on the right, opposite the Mall. The landing place
was commodious being formed by a stone pier, with steps,
alongside of which two boats at a time may lay with ease and take
in their fresh water, which comes down by a tank from the town.
We <i>landed on the very place where Lord Nelson lost his
arm</i>, it appeared to have fallen nearly into a state of ruin.
There were several peices of connon laid by the side; but none
mounted. They were repairing it before we came away. From the
pier you enter the town by a gate at which stands a guard; to the
left is a large battery, Fort St. Phillip, which leads round to
the High street. At the tower end was observed a light
well-finished monument of white marble, commemorating the
marvellous appearance of the image or bust of Our Lady at
Candelaria to the Guanches, the Aborigines of the country, who
were thereby converted to Xtianity, 104 years before the
preaching of the Gospel. The four sides of the monument bore long
inscriptions to this effect; and it was erected at the expense of
Don Bartholomi de Montagnes, perpetual Captain of the Royal
Marine Castle, at Candelaria:&mdash;</p>
<p>In the centre of this street were a stone bason and fountain.
(<i>Here it was that the British Seamen and Marines were repulsed
when they attached Santa Cruz with Lord Nelson</i>), from which
the inhabitants were supplied with very good water, conveyed from
the neighbouring hills by wooden throughs, supported on slight
posts and reaching quite to the town. At the head of the street,
near the Government House or Requisition, stood a large Cross;
and at a small distance the Governor's House and the Church of
St. Francis; annexed was a monastery of Franciscans. At this
church we see a grand funeral of one of the Franciscans, the
corpse was carried on a bier, the face and feet exposed, they
were a long time performing burial service; and when they
deposited the body in the grave, which is first prepared with a
coffin to receive it, is let down by fillets, and a paul coverd
over, to prevent your seeing a quantity of lime thrown on the
face and body. We were informed that the body remained there only
a few days, then taken up, and put into a charnal-house adjoining
to the church. The hills on the N.E. part of this island is
surrounded by inaccessible mountains. There were not any
fortifications upon the commanding ground above the town; but at
each end of the bay stood a fort between which were erected 3 or
4 circular redoubts, connecting with each other by a low parapet
wall, wearing the appearance of a line of communication between
the forts; but few cannon in the works. There is a very curious
cave called Beggers, on the S.W. side about a mile and a-half
from the town, likewise an aqueduct. The road there is bad, being
loose stones that bore all the appearance of cinders. The new
roads that they are making to Bonavista is broad and good. They
were cutting the barley and Indian wheat, both of which were good
crops. The sea breezes generally sets in about 10 from the N.E.
side of the island and blows to 5 or 6 in the eve. Frequently
there is a tremendous surge at the pier, when the wind is at
east, that it is not possible to land. The land breeze sets in
from the W. which continue till 7 or 8 in the morn. The altitude
of the Peak itself we were informed, was 15,396 feet, only 148
yards short of 3 miles.</p>
<p>The Peak of Teneriffe, which the Dutch make their first
meridian is said to be three miles high, in the form of a sugar
loaf, and is situated on an island of the same name near the
coast.&mdash;Vide Guthrie. Geog., page 659.</p>

appeard very bad land. They cut the corn with a sickle, than
place it upon a large round of stones, where it lays some days,
than take it to the store houses in the town. The Governor's
daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong and family, with the
harbour-captain, drank tea with Capt. Woodriff; they were very
much pleasd with the ship. At 6 they went on shore.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 19. <span class=
"a">a.m.</span>&mdash;Moderate breezes, <span class=
"a">p.m.</span>&mdash;Prepared for sailing. This being the great
Festival of Assencion, the Spanish flags were hoisted on all the
forts and the ships in the bay. At 10 I went on shore with Capt.
Woodriff, Mr. Tuckey, and some officers, to see High Mass
performd, first at the Church at St. Francis. They than went to
the Great Church, Nostra Seniora de Consion, where the High Mass
was perform'd, and all the principal inhabitants attended at the
alter, which was highly decorated; in this church were two small
British flags, which were taken when Ld. Nelson attacked Santa
Cruz in 1799. The man who shew: the church was particular in
telling us of the bravery of their troops, and of the colours
being taken. One of our officers observd to him that they were
very right in taking such great care of them, for that Lord
Nelson very likely would <i>call for them again
soon</i>.&mdash;Mr. Wright, Massiter(?).</p>

<p>St. Jago is inhabited by the Portuguese, the largest, most
populous, and most fertile of the Cape de Verd Islands in Africa.
It lies 13 miles west of Mayo, and abounds with high craggy
mountains, particularly on the left of the town. Here are stock
birds, and fruit of all kinds, and very cheap. The Flagstaff and
Governor's House are situated on the S.E. side of the harbour,
which has a long train of battery by the side of the hill. The
houses are very small. We observd a large convent from the town.

place. He studied in England. The English surgeons are held in
high reputation. The town of Rio de Janeiro was said to contain
not less than 100,000 souls, of which 40,000 are slaves brought
from the Coast of Ginnea. With these people of both sexes the
streets are constantly filld, scarcely any other people being
seen in the day. Ladies and gentlemen were never seen on foot in
the streets during the day, those whose business led them out
being carried in close chairs, the pole of which came from the
head of the vehicle and rested on the shoulders of the chairmen.
The language spoken here by the white people was Portuguese. The
eclesiastics in general could converse in Latin&mdash;they
pronounce it very differently to the English pronunciation. The
Negro slaves spoke a corrupt mixture of their own and Portuguese
language. The town was well supplied with water, which was
conveyed into it from a great distance by means of an aqueduct
(or carioca) which, having to cross a road or public way, was
raised upon a double row of lofty arches; from this aqueduct the
water was received into stone fountains, constructed with
capacious basins; here the inhabitants have their linen washed by
their slaves, near the Convent of the Antonian monks. We also
observed several large and rich convents in the town. The chief
of these were the Benedictine and the Carmelite; one dedicated to
St. Antony, another to our Lady of Assistance, and another to Sta
Theresa; the two last were for the reception of nuns. The Convent
D. Ajuda, or of Assistance, received as pensioners, or boarders,
the young ladies having lost their parents, who were allowed to
remain, conforming to the rules of the convent, until married, or
otherwise provided for by their friends. The whole of the
churches are under a bishop, whose palace was in the town, a
short distance from one of the principal convents (Benedictine).
To a stranger nothing could appear more remarkable than the
innumerable religious processions which were to be seen at all
hours in this town. At the close of every day an image of the
Virgin was borne in procession through the principal streets, the
attendants arrayed in white surplices, and bearing in their hands
lighted tapers, chanting at the same time praises to her in
Latin; to this, as well as to all other religious processions,
the guards turned out, grounded their arms, kneeled, and shewed
the most submissive marks of respect, and the bells of each
church or convent in the vicinity of their progress sounded a
peal while they were passing, and people assembled at their
windows. Every church, chapel, or convent being under the
auspicies of some tutelary saint, particular days were set apart
as the festival of each, which were opened with public prayers,
and concluded with processions, music, and <i>fireworks</i>.
During several hours after dark, on these solemn festivals, the
inhabitants are seen walking to and from the church, dressed in
their best habiliments, accompanied by their children, and
attended by their slaves and carriages. We were informed that
they never permitted any base metals near their alters, all their
vessels, &amp;c., being of the purest gold or silver. At the
corner of almost every street in the town was observed a small
alter, dedicated generally to the Virgin, and decorated with
curtains and lamps, before these alters, at the close of every
evening, the Negroes assembled to chant their vespers, kneeling
together in long rows in the street. The tradespeople of the town
have adopted a regulation which must prove of infinite
convenience to strangers as well as the inhabitants; we found the
people of one profession or trade dwelling together in one, two,
or as many streets as were necessary for their numbers to occupy.
Houses here were built, after the fashion of Santa Cruz, with a
small wooden balcony over the enterance; to the eye accustomed to
the cheerful appearance of glass windows a certain gloom seemed
to pervade even their best and widest streets, the light being
conveyed through window frames of close lattice-work. The women
of Rio De Janeiro, being within the tropics, do not possess the
best complexions, but their features were expressive; the eye
dark and lively; the hair was dark, this they mostly wore with
powder, strained to a high point before and tied in several folds
behind. The mines, the greatest source of revenue to the Crown of
Portugal and in the government of this place, the great cause of
jealousy both of strangers and the inhabitants, were situated
more than a week's journey hence, except some which had been
lately discovered in the mountains (the Organ Hills) near the
town. Sufficient employment was found for the Mint, at which was
struck all the coin that was current here besides what was sent
to Europe. The dimond trade had been for some time taken into the
hands and under the inspection of Government, but the jewellers'
shops abound with topazes, chrysolites, and other precious
stones. The barracks for the troops appeard to be commodious and
to be kept in good order. A small number of cavalry were always
on duty, employed in the antichamber of the palace, or in
attending the Viceroy either on days of parade or in his
excursions into the country. A captain's guard of infantry with a
standard mounted every day at the palace. The present Governor's
name is Don Joseph Ferdanez du Portugal&mdash;he had been Viceroy
at Rio de Janeiro two years and a half. An officer from each
regiment attended every evening at the palace to take orders for
the following day, which were delivered to him by the Adjutant of
Orders, who himself received them directly from the Viceroy. At
the palace every transaction in the town was known, and so strict
was the search for deserters from the ships, when reported to the
guard at the palace, they were almost certain of getting the men
by the next morn. In addition to the centinels, every regiment
and every guard sent parties through the streets patroling the
whole night for the preservation of peace and good order. During
our stay the wifes of the convicts were allowed to take clothes
to wash with them on the Island of Enchados, a small island with
an old monastary on it to the W.N.W. of the town. The ladies and
gentlemen we observed were continually walking of an evening
quite late, especially when any of their festivals were. Both
males and females were early taught to dress as men and women. We
see a hoop on a little donna of four years old, and a bag and a
sword on a sesnor of six. This appearance we observd as much as
that of the saints and virgins in their churches being decorated
with powdered perraques, swords, laced clothes, and full dressed
suits. The Convent of Sta Theresa we were informed was the
strictest of any; there were eighteen young people there which
had taken the veil and they were not allowd to see any one but
their nearest relations. The priests were not permitted to see
them. The chapel was very neat, it stood upon the hill near the
aqueduct. The Convent De Adjuda.&mdash;This I frequently visted,
where I conversed with a very beautiful young lady named Antonia
Januaria. Her polite attention I shall not easily forget, having
received great friendship from her, and should I ever return
there again shall be happy to see her. [<i>The next page is left

naturally for us to indulge at this moment a melancholy
reflection which obtruded itself upon the minds of those, who,

which we had so liberally partaken at the Cape and Simons Bay
were to be exchanged for coarse fare and hard labour at Pt.
Philip, and we may truly say all communication with families and
friends now cut off, we were leaving the world behind us to enter
on a state unknown.</p>

Sounded in 40 fathms&mdash;coarse brown sand. At 5, saw the land
about Port Phillip to the N. b. E. The land near the entrance of
the harbour appeared low land, and at a distance very
beautiful.<sup>[1]</sup> Seal Island, S.E. &frac12; E., and
Whales Point, W. b. S. (named so by Capt. Woodriff, the head
being very much like one): it is on the larboard side as you
enter the harbour. At 15 past 10 we anchord with the best bower
in 6 fathms; found laying here the <i>Ocean</i> transport, which
arrived on Friday the 7 of Oct. When moord ship we had the
following bearings:&mdash;The east side of the enterance West,
and the east end of the long island N.E. &frac12; E. off the
south shore, 1&frac12; mile. A very fine country to appearance,
but no water but salt lakes&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[[1] "The face of the country bordering on the
port is beautifully picturesque, swelling into gentle elevations
of the brightest verdure, and dotted with trees as if planted by
the hand of taste, while the ground is covered with a profusion
of flowers of every colour; in short, the external appearance of
the country flattered us into the most delusive dreams of
fruitfulness and plenty.<br>
<br>
"The soil (except in a few places where marl is found mixed with
vegetable mould) is invariably sandy, and its blackness proceeds
from the ashes of the burnt grass, which has everywhere been set
fire to by the natives. The proportion of sand varies, and in
some spots the soil may be sufficiently strong [to produce
vegetables, and perhaps Indian corn; but it may safely be
asserted that (<i>excepting a few acres at the head of the
port</i>) no spot within five miles of the water will produce
wheat or any other grain that requires either much moisture or
good soil. On some of the highest elevations an arid sea-sand is
found, giving nourishment to no other vegetable than heath and
fern. The basis of the hills consist of very coarse granite,
which is here found in every stage of formation, from grains
scarcely adhering, and crumbling into sand between the fingers,
to the perfect stone which almost defies the
chissel."&mdash;[<i>Tuckey</i>, p. 157.]]</p>

Employed clearing away the booms, &amp;c. Out launch at 4. Moord
ship with the small bower to the westward. Capt. Woodriff and
Lieut. Governor Collins went on shore on the south side of the
island. At C they returned. Could not find any fresh water. They
reported the soil to be very bad, and the trees small, unfit for
the use of H.M. Navy. The Bay is very large, more so than any I
ever see, but the enterance does not exceed a mile and a half,
though from the camp, S.W. to the N.E. of the Bay, it is not less
than 60 miles to the fresh water lake. At 10 it blew a very hard
gale of wind. It was very fortunate for us that we arrived at our
destination in the morn. 12, do. wr., with very hard squalls.</p>

self, went on the south side of the Bay, opposite the ship, and
many miles in and round the opposite shore, but could not find
any water but what was very brackish that we could not drink. The
land was very bad, light soil, and a great many of the trees
blown up by the roots, which appeared to have taken very little
root. Not any of the natives did we see, but many hutts, in which
were cockle shells and muscle. We see a few birds, parrots and a
couple of quails; not the least vestige of any quadrupedes or
fish. Along the shore we returnd by no means satisfied with the
country. The Capt. and Governor went on shore and found no water
that was good, but a small run near Arthers Seat, the east side
of the Bay.<sup>[1]</sup> When we arrived here it was in the
spring, the month of April <sup>[2]</sup> 1803.</p>

the island in the middle of the Bay, now called Signet [Mud]
Island, where we see a great number of black swans. I was the
first that killd one on the island. We kill 3, and caught many
alive, and caught many pelicans, and some sea birds. Capt. W. and
the Gov., with Mr. Tuckey, went on the west side of the Bay to
procure water. Could not find any. Three of the natives were
friendly with them, and gave Mr. T. a spear. The information that
the Governor, &amp;c., gave was by no means favourable, for want
of soil, water, and trees. The difference of time with us and
England is nine hours forty three minutes: we are so much
forwarder than they are.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 12. Wind westly. <span class=

shore cutting grass, and another watering. At 7, the Capt. and
Col. Collins, and 1 Lieut., Mr. Tuckey, went to the northern part
of the Bay to procure water, and see the same three natives. The
Colony Surgeons report the water procured by sinking tubs as
wells to be good and fit for use. The Capt. gave one of the
natives a blanket. They attended them some time. At 15. past 11.
the Captain and officers returnd, but found no water fit for use.
Sent the carpenter and some men to look for wood on shore.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 13. Wind S.W. <span class=

launch for water. The same party of officers went to survey the
S.E. part of the Bay and watering place. The carpenter returnd
from on shore, where he had been to search for wood to secure the
head and knees of the ship. Had not seen any fit for that
purpose. At 15. past 1. confind Lieut. Donovan to his cabin pr
order of Capt. Woodriff, for his being absent from the ship
whilst he was on shore.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

2 of the planks in the counter started. Caulkers caulking the
poop waterways. At 7 in the morn Mr. White and self went on shore
on the south side of the Bay, and walked far into the country. We
see the kangaroos and some parretts, but could not kill any. We
walkd to the watering place. The water through the casks was
good, and the information from the 4 men that were there that it
agreed with them. At 5 returnd on board.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 15. Wind E.S.E. <span class=

Gammon, of the colony, and a 6 oard cutter, victuald for 8 days,
to survey the Bay from the camp northward, if possible to
assertain a more eligable situation for forming a settlement. At
9, employd landing the convicts with their baggage. At 11, the

hospital stores. At 10 I went to the camp to see about my
marquee, and gave orders for its being completed for me. At 4
<span class="a">p.m.</span> the Capt. and Colonel went on shore;
the Colonel slept there for the first time. At &frac12;-past 4
the Master returnd from surveying, and found a good channel in
the E.N.E. direction. I remaind on board as a visitor.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 18. <span class="a">a.m.</span>&mdash;I
remaind on board till 10, then went on shore to the camp to order
about my marque; returnd on board to dine.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 19. <span class="a">a.m.</span>&mdash;At 9
went on shore and sent all my things to the camp. Waited upon the

Sarjent for drunkenness and m conduct.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 20. <span class="a">a.m.</span>&mdash;At 9
Lieut. Menzies, of the Royal Marines, came to the camp to set at
the court martial on the prisoner Sarjeant Sargant. At 11 the
court commenced. At 2 <span class="a">p.m.</span> it finishd, and
the report carried to the Governor. I dind at the mess with the
officers. At 6 the officer of the E. Marines, Lieut. Sladden, red
the sentence of the court martial, which was that Sarjeant
Sarjant be broke and put into the line as a private; but, on
account of his prior good conduct, that he be recommended to the
Governor, who reproved him and reinstated him.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 21. <span class="a">a.m.</span>&mdash;At 50
past 7 the launch and cutter returnd from surveying the harbour,
having last night arrived in the N.W. point of the bay, where
they have discoverd a straigh, an apparent passage towards the
sea, which the first Lieut., Mr. Tuckey, intended to have
explored, but was driven to the southward during the night by a
tide or current from the apparant straigh; and at daylight,
finding himself near the ship, returned on board. At 11 Capt.
Woodriff and Lieut. Tuckey came to the camp, who produced to the
Governor a chart, the survey about 90 miles round the bay from
Arthers Seat (the highest hill on the east of the bay); and had
landed in several places to observe the soil, trees, and to
obtain water. The report was&mdash;the soil bad, trees very
small, and but little water; nor could they get any fish. Lieut.
Houston and Midshipman Mr. Vernon (son of the Bishop of
Carlisle), dind with me. In the eve I went on board H.M. Ship
<i>Calcutta</i> to tea and sleep.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 22. <span class="a">a.m.</span>&mdash;At 7
Mr. Tuckey, the first Lieut., and two boats went to survey from
the N.W. point of the bay. In the eve I return to the camp.
Lieut. MacCullough, of the Royal Marines, slept at my marquee.
Mr. Tuckey, Mr. Gammon, Mid. Mr. Collins, Mr. Harris&mdash;the
two last gentlemen belong-to the colony&mdash;they found a fresh
water river on the N.E. poind of the bay, where they pitched
their tent for the night.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<p class="foot">[[1] "On the eastern side of the port,
twenty-eight miles from the entrance, a stream of fresh water
empties itself into the port [<i>Cannanook</i>?]. This stream
runs through an extensive swamp, and appears to be a branch from
a large river at the northern extremity of the port, which the
shortness of time and badness of the weather prevented our
examining [in the boats]. The bed of this stream is covered with
foliaceous mica, which our people at first conceived to be gold
dust, and thence expected they had discovered an
<i>Elsatedorado</i>."&mdash;[Tuckey, p. 160.]]<br></p>
<p align="center">A Private Remark given me from Mr. Harris and
Lieut. Tuckey of H.M. ship <i>Calcutta</i>.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 23. <span class="a">a.m.</span>&mdash;At 8 they
observd three of the natives, who approach them. Mr. Tuckey gave
them fish, bread, and many preseants; they were much pleasd and
friendly. At 10 Mr. T. and Mr. Collins went across the bay, about
5 or 6 miles, with a boats crew, leaving Mr. Harris and Mr.
Gammon &amp; 2 men to take care of the tent, and make
observations on shore. The three men, seeing Mr. T. go away in
the boat, they likewis went away. Early in the afternoon they
returnd with a great many of them; and at 2 <span class=
"a">p.m.</span> they in the boat coming back observd 70 in a
party. Mr. Tuckey called to them, at which they hastened to the
place where the tent was. On Mr. T. coming up he found Mr. Gammon
surrounded; and the chief at that time seized Mr. G., who calld
out to Mr. T. to fire on them. Mr. Harris was surrounded at the
tent; and the blacks were taking what they could from the boat.
Mr. T. fird over them; they ran away a small distance, but soon
approachd again with the king (who wore a very elegant
turban-crown),<sup>[2]</sup> and was always carried upon the
shoulders of the men. Whenever he desired them to halt, or to
approach, they did it immediately. Mr. T. fird over them a second
time, at which they removed to a very small distance. Those about
the king, to the number of 50 or 60 were all armed. The blacks
finding that none were wounded, and that the number were
approaching, and the second in command was going to throw his
spier at Mr. Tuckey, gave orders to shoot him, as an example;
they fird, and Innis killed him, and another wounded; they all
fled. The number of savages were not less than one hundred and
fifty. Had not Mr. Tuckey fortunately came up with the boat, no
doubt but they would have killd Mr. Gammon and Mr. Harris and the
2 men, and have eat them. We have great reason to think they are
canibals.</p>

that Robert Cannady, servant to Mr. Humphreys, had promised
Buckly, the Governor's servant, a waistcoat for a pair of shoes,
which he had taken and worn, and would not return the waistcoat;
but after hearing them on both sides I had the waistcoat given to

<p align="center"><i>By His Honor David Collins, Esq.,
Lieutenant-Governor of a Settlement or Settlements to be formed
in Bass's Straits, New South Wales.</i></p>
<p>A plan of an association of the civil officers of the
settlement having been submitted by them to the Lieut.-Governor,
he is pleased to approve thereof, and to authorise them, which he
hereby does, to carry the same into effect.</p>
<p>The most probable means of this association rendering a
service to the settlement is principally by forming a night
watch, to patrole from the beating of the taptoo to that of the
reveillie, during which time they will search such places as may
be deemed necessary for the discovery of any felony, trespass, or
misdemeanour; and for the apprehension and securing for
examination any person or persons who may appear to them
concerned therein, either by entrance into any hut or dwelling,
or by such other means as circumstances may render expedient.</p>
<p>Cognizance is to be taken during the day, as well as by night,
of such convicts as may sell or barter their clothing or
provisions, as well as of such as gamble for either of the above
articles or money; and, upon detection, instantly place them in
confinement.</p>
<p>Upon receiving any information of a robbery having been
committed during the night, they will use the most effectual
means to trace out the offender or offenders, so that they may be
brought to justice.</p>
<p>One of the members of the association will, at the morning
parade, report the occurrences of the night to the
Lieut.-Governor, to whom they may have access at all hours.</p>
<p>When challenged by a sentinel, the officer on duty will give
the countersign, which shall be sent to the Revd. Mr. Knopwood
for that purpose at sunset.</p>
<p>The persons who are joined with them in this duty will, when
challenged, answer "Night watch," and advancing to the sentinel
make themselves known as such. To prevent mistakes, their names
will be left with the guard. As the military are to give every
assistance they may require, so they will be cautious not to
interfere with them in the discharge of their duty.</p>
<p>Two of the undermentioned gentlemen will meet each night,
taking with them four of the persons named hereafter; and they
will patrol at such hours as may be best calculated not to
interfere with the military rounds or patroles.</p>
<p>A tent will be pitched for their accommodation in the rear of
the guard tent; and the front of the tent is to be considered as
their alarm post, where all the members of this association will
assemble and wait for orders when the drum shall beat to
arms.</p>
<p>The gentlemen will each be provided with a brace of pistols,
and suitable ammunition. The other persons will each be furnished
with a short staff.</p>
<p>This association is to take place on <i>Monday</i> the 2d of
January 1804.</p>

<p class="foot">[[1] "Nothing could offer a more imposing picture
of reposing solitude than the wilds of Port Phillip on our first
arrival. Here Contemplation, with her musing sister Melancholy,
might find an undisturbed retreat. Often at the calm hour of
evening I have wandered through the woods&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">"'Where the rude axe with heaved stroke,<br>
   Was never heard the nymphs to daunt,<br>
   Or fright them from their hallowed haunts.'</p>
<p class="foot">"The last hymn of the feathered choristers to the
setting sun, and the soft murmurs of the breeze, faintly broke
the death-like silence that reigned around; while the lightly
trodden path of the solitary savage, or the dead ashes of his
fire, alone pointed out the existence of human beings. In the
course of a very few weeks the scene was greatly altered; lanes
were cut in the woods for the passage of the timber carriages;
the huts of the woodmen were erected beneath the sheltering
branches of the lofty trees; the "busy hum" of their voices, and
the sound of their axes, reverberating through the woods, denoted
the exertions of social industry, and the labours of
civilization. At other times, sitting on the carriage of a gun,
in front of the Camp, I have contemplated with succeeding
emotions of pity, laughter, and astonishment, the scene before
me. When I viewed so many of my fellow men sunk, some of them
from a rank in life equal or superior to my own, and by their
crimes degraded to a level with the basest of mankind; when I saw
them naked, wading to their shoulders in water to unlade the
boats, while a burning sun struck its meridian rays upon their
uncovered heads, or yoked to and sweating under a timber
carriage, the wheels of which were sunk up to the axle in sand, I
only considered their hapless lot, and the remembrance of their
vices was for a moment absorbed in the greatness of their
punishment."&mdash;[<i>Tuckey</i>, ii. 185.]]</p>

3 wore ship. At 4 Cape Bassalter S.W., being then one with the
south point of the island. At 7 Cape Bassalter bore west, and the
island, south point, N. 85&deg; west. Cape Bassalter is one of
the capes that you pass on the starbord side as you enter the
bay; it is the most remarkable of any that you see. This morn at
9 o'clock we were coming up the mouth of the river with a very
fine breeze, but was obliged to put back the wind was so much
agst. us.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 10. S.b.W. <span class="a">a.m.</span>&mdash;At
8 more moderate and cloudy; 8, light variable airs, inclining to
a calm. At noon Cape Bassalter bore S. 85 W.; sprung up a
northward favourable light breeze from the northward. Latt. obsd.

<p align="center">Ship <i>Ocean</i>, at anchor, in Frederick
Henry Bay, Van Diemens Land, Feb. 1804.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 12. W.N.W. <span class=
"a">a.m.</span>&mdash;Fresh breezes and cloudy, with squalls at
times. At 10 Capt. Merthew, Mr. Bowden, Mr. Collins, and self
went on shore; we went armd. Capt. M. and self left them; we
landed on the shore W.b.N., lagoon of salt W.N.W., fresh lagoon
N.W.b.W. At the back of the high hill we see a great number of
wild fowl and one emew, quails, bronswin, pigeons, and parrotts.
At 4 we returnd to the party we left, and got a great quantity of
oysters. It appeard to me that the natives were much better
supplied with fish and birds than those at Port Phillip. The
trees are very large and good, and a great deal of underwood.
Near the fresh lagoon, which was large&mdash;more than 12 or 14
miles round&mdash;was a great quantity of flax and very fine
      ; besides ducks and teal were snipes, and I think a
woodcock was flushd. At &frac12;-past 6 we returnd in a very
heavy gale of wind, with hard rain.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 13. W.N.W. <span class=
"a">a.m.</span>&mdash;Strong breezes, with heavy squalls of wind
and rain. At 10 a party were sent on shore to get oysters, but
the tide did not suit the lagoon. 17 of the natives were seen by
the party; they reported the natives to be men well made,
entirely naked, and some of them had war wepons; they had a small
boy with them about 7 years old, and did not appear to flee from
them. <span class="a">p.m.</span>&mdash;At 3 Capt. Merthew and
Mr. Collins went on shore to get oysters.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 14. W.N.W. <span class=
"a">a.m.</span>&mdash;Fresh breezes and hazy wr. Unable to sail,
the wind against us. 4 <span class="a">p.m.</span> Capt. Merthew
went on shore a short time.</p>
<p><i>Wed</i>. 15. Calm, N.W. <span class=
"a">a.m.</span>&mdash;First part light variable winds, in dining
to a calm; at 4 sprung up a breeze from the N.W.; weighd and made
all sail. At 10 calm, light airs; &frac12;-past light airs from
the S.E. The centre of Betseys Island S.W.b.S. At noon tkd ship
to the eastward. <span class="a">p.m.</span>&mdash;&frac12;-past
1 tkd. ship; at 3 round Betseys Island, and bore up for the
enterance of the harbour. At &frac12;-past 3 saw a boat a-head,
which came alongside with Mr. Simonds, commander of H.M. Brig
<em>Lady Nelson</em>, and went with us up the River Derwent. At
&frac12;-past 6 anchord in Risdon Cove,<sup>[1]</sup> in 4 fthms.
Latter part light breezes and hazy.</p>
<p class="foot">[[1] Risdon Cove, improperly called "Restdown,"
was named by Lieut. Bowen after the 2nd officer of the <em>Lady
Nelson</em>, which vessel carried Bowen and his party from Sydney
to form the settlement in June 1803.&mdash; <i>Ed</i>.]<br></p>
<p align="center">Remarks, Risdon Cove, Van Diemens Land, Feb.
1804.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 16. <span class="a">a.m.</span>&mdash;The
morn very fine. At 10 the Lieut. Govvernor, self, and Lieut.
Lord, of the Royal Marines, went on shore to see the settlemen
form'd by Lieut. Bowen, of the Royal Navy. As we left the ship.
Cap. Mertho, of the <i>Ocean</i> Transport, saluted Lieut. Coll.
Coll., the new Governor, with 11 guns. When landed we were
received by Lieut. More, the commandant of the New South Wales
Corps, Mr. Mongarrett, the surgeon, and Mr. Wilson, the
storekeeper; the camp consisted of 16 privates, 1 sarjant, 1 drum
and fife. After examining the camp, gardens, water, &amp;c., it
was the general opinion to be not calculated for a town. At 2 the
Lieut. Gov. returnd on board. I dind with Mr. Mongarret at his
house, on the N.-East side of the river. The watering place is by
no means good. Capt. Bowen returnd to Port Jackson with an
intention of going to England.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 17. <span class="a">a.m.</span>&mdash;At 10 the
Lieut. Governor, Mr. Collins, and self went to examine a plain
<sup>[2]</sup> on the S.W. side of the river; the plain
extensive, and a continuel run of water, which is very excellent;
it comes from the lofty montain, much resembling the Table
Montain at the Cape of Good Hope. The land is good, and the trees
very excellent. The plain is well calculated in every degree for
a settlement. At 5 we returnd and dind with the Gov., much
delighted with the excursion. The new settlement is 6 miles lower
down the river than the present one, which is a great advantage,
besides the landing of the stores so much better.</p>
<p class="foot">[[2] It is difficult to determine in what sense
Mr. Knopwood uses the word plain here and elsewhere, all the
surface about Hobart Town being undulatory, and, at the time he
writes of, much wooded. The following is the description of the
place as it was in 1804, written by the chief officer of the
<i>Lady Nelson</i> [<i>Jorgen Jorgensen</i>] (and published in
Hobart Town, 1835), who assisted to establish both Risdon and
Hobart Town:&mdash;"During our absence," that is at Port Phillip,
to remove the second draft of Collins' people to the
Derwent&mdash;" the station at Risdon was found ineligible, and
the present scite of Hobart Town was ultimately determined on. We
landed at Sullivan's Cove, and having pitched our tents, spades,
hoes, saws, and axes were put into the hands of prisoners, and we
commenced clearing away as fast as we could. As I walk up and
down the streets of this now crowded and large town, I cannot
always divest myself of the remembrance of what it was at that
time&mdash;32 years ago. The spot where the Bank of Van Diemen's
Land, the Hope and Anchor, and the late Mrs. Kearney's habitation
now are was then an impervious grove of the thickest brushwood,
surmounted with some of the largest gum trees that this island
can "produce, and all along the rivulet, as far up as where the
Old or Upper mill now is, was impassable from the denseness of
the shrubs and underwood, and the huge collection of prostrate
trees and dead timber which had been washed down by the stream,
and were strewed all around. These had in parts blocked up the
channel, and many places which are now dry and built upon, or
cultivated in fruitful gardens, were covered with rushes and
water." Jorgenson says the <i>Lady Nelson</i> was a small brig,
of 65 tons; and of the <i>Ocean</i>, that "she sailed so badly
that we were obliged to assist her coming up the river," Knopwood
says nothing about her entry into the harbour in this undignified
manner.&mdash;[C.]]<br></p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 18. <span class="a">a.m.</span>&mdash;At 11
the Gov., Mr. Harris, Capt. Mertho, and self went and examined a
part of the river to see a plain for the settlers, but the Gov.
did not approve of it. The ground appeared to be much injured by
the torrents of rain. The trees are very large and good. At 5
<span class="a">p.m.</span> the Gov. went on shore to the
settlement on the N.E. side of the river, and ordered the tents
to be struck and sent on board the <em>Lady Nelson</em>. At 6 a
little rain; they have not had a good shower of rain for 4
months.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 19. <span class="a">a.m.</span>&mdash;Strong
breezes and small rain. At 6 weighd anchor and dropd down the
river towards Sullivan Bay, but the wind coming on to blow hard,
came to anchor at 12. At 3 weighd and anchord in Sullivan Bay,
near the small island;<sup>[1]</sup> Capt. Mertho, Mr. Collins,
and self went on shore, see some very fine trees.</p>

<p>From the account given by Acting-Lieut't Murray and Captain
Flinders, the goodness of the soil and natural advantages of Port
Phillip, in Basses Straits, I beg leave to suggest the propriety
of a settlement being made at that place, as much for the purpose
of separating the numbers that will be sent here when peace is
made, as to make an establishment in a place so connected with
this settlement; nor can there be a doubt, from the accounts I
have received from those officers, of its being a much more
eligible climate for raising wheat than this. This measure I
should immediately adopt, but unfortunately I have no person
under me that can be spared or entrusted with such a command; but
when more officers come out, perhaps I may be able to select out
one that would answer for that situation, which will require a
person of some abilities and perseverance. Unless I find it
absolutely necessary, I shall not take this step without your
Grace's approbation, and if approved of, I respectfully beg leave
to submit the establishment proposed in a former letter to your
Grace's consideration, which I have the honor to enclose with a
marginal reference. I am more solicitous respecting forming this
settlement, from the probability of the French having it in
contemplation to make a settlement on the N.W. coast (of
straits), which I cannot help thinking is a principal object of
their researches.</p>

<div align="right">22nd November, 1802.   </div>
<p><span class="a">You</span> are hereby required and directed to
embark on board His Majesty's Colonial vessel Cumberland, whose
master has my orders to receive you and follow your directions on
the service you are about to perform.</p>
<p>In the same vessel will be embarked the Surveyor-General of
this territory and the people as p'r margin. **</p>
<p class="foot">[** Mr. Chas. Grimes, Acting Surveyor-General, a
surgeon, a gardener, and three marines belonging to His Majesty's
ship Buffalo&mdash;in all, seventeen persons including the
crew.]</p>
<p>You will proceed without loss of time to Kings Island, at the
west entrance of Basses Straits. The east side from Point
Farewell to Seal Bay having been surveyed by the Lady Nelson, you
need not loose time in surveying that part unless any material
error should appear, which you will note. The depth of water and
entrance into the lagoon that has been seen on the east side is
an object to ascertain how far a small vessel might go in and lye
in safety. Should the wind prevail at west, you will find
Elephant Bay a good roadstead from whence you may make such
excursions into the island as will not prevent you from rejoining
the vessel again in case of the appearance of a change of wind.
As New Year's Harbour is the safest anchorage for the vessel in
all winds, that place is to be preferred for her to lye in, while
you, with the surveyor, surgeon, and gardner, proceed to explore
the interior and coasts of King's Island. In executing that
service you will pay particular attention to the face of the
country, wherever it is hilly, plain, or swampy; the nature and
depth of the soil, noting such parts, and the apparent quantities
of ground which are capable of cultivation or grazing to
advantage; also fresh water in streams, springs, ponds, or
lagoons; the quantity, quality, and size of the timber growing on
the island; and what part of the coasts appear accessible to
boats. You will also observe the best situation for settlements,
in which you will have a view to the commercial advantages,
access of vessels, obtaining fresh water, and its defence. You
will also observe where settlers can be advantageously placed,
and finally make such general daily observations as may guide my
judgement in the most proper places to establish settlements,
committing all your observations to writing, and noting the above
objects on the charts you are provided with.</p>
<p>You will, with the assistance of the surgeon and gardner,
collect and bring small samples of all stones, timber, plants,
&amp;c., you may find on different parts of the island. With this
object you will proceed to Port Phillip (Captn. Flinders's and
Lieut. Murray's surveys of which you are provided with), and
proceed to the most minute investigation of that spacious
harbour, the unsurveyed part of which you will determine as well
as possible, noticing the depth of water and shoals throughout,
particularly all the parts that have not been sounded or surveyed
by the above officers, making every remark and observation on the
land and interior as pointed out in the preceeding part of these
orders respecting King's Island. Should a continuance of foul
winds oblige you to put into Western Port, you will make similar
observations on the land about that harbour.</p>
<p>On leaving Port Phillip you will endeavour to take advantage
of the wind and weather to examine the unsurveyed part between
that port and Cape Albany Otway, ascertaining the exact latitude,
and, if circumstances should allow, to determine the longitude as
near as possible of that promontory.</p>
<p>As circumstances may occur to prevent your executing those
orders to their full extent and meaning, you will in that, as
well as in most other cases, consult with the Surveyor-General,*
Mr. Rush with, and Mr. McCallum, at the same time using your own
discretion; and as you will act in conjunction with the
Surveyor-General, you will cause every assistance to be given him
for executing the instructions he is furnished with, and of which
you are provided with a copy.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mr. Charles Grimes]</p>
<p>In the execution of these instructions you will observe the
directions contained in my separate order of this date. Having
performed this service in as complete a manner as possible, you
will return here without loss of time, where I shall expect you
the beginning of March.</p>
<p>You will keep a minute and correct daily journal of your
proceedings, and on your arrival you will exact from every person
on board the vessel the journal and observations, charts,
&amp;c., they have made on the voyage, as well as all objects of
natural history which they may have collected, taking care that
their journals and observations are sealed up when delivered by
them to you, all which you will deliver to me for the information
of His Majesty's Ministers. For all which this shall be your
authority.</p>

<h4>C.&mdash;LORD HOBART TO THE ADMIRALTY.</h4>
<p class="foot">[<span class="u">Historical Records of New South

<div align="right">Downing-street, 15th January, 1803.   </div>
<p>My Lords,<br>
The King having been pleased to signify his Royal commands that a
certain number of the convicts now in this kingdom .  .  .  .  .
under sentence of transportation should be sent to Port Phillip,
on the southern coast of New South Wales, to the northward of
Bass's Streights, at which place it is intended that the said
convicts should form a settlement, I am to acquaint your
Lordships that His Majesty has been pleased to select
Lieutenant-Colonel Collins, of the Royal Marines, to be
Lieutenant-Governor thereof. The Lords of the Treasury have been
authorized to provide a sufficient proportion of provisions and
other supplies for their subsistence, as well as tools to enable
them to erect habitations, and also implements for agriculture;
and it being His Majesty's pleasure that the Calcutta, before
intended to proceed to Port Jackson, should be employed upon this
service, your Lordships are to instruct her commander to take
under his protection a vessel * which has been provided by the
Transport Board for the service and to proceed to Port Phillip as
aforesaid.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The <i>Ocean</i>, Captain Mertho.]</p>
<p>From the length of the voyage to Port Phillip, the commander
** will, of course, find it necessary to put into port on his way
thither for the purpose of recruiting the stock of water. Your
Lordships will, therefore, give instructions accordingly, only
taking care that one of the places to be fixed upon for a
rendezvous may be the Rio Janeiro, from whence it is intended
that as many supplies as possible for the new settlement shall be
procured.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Captain Woodriff, commander of the
Calcutta.]</p>
<p>As it has been thought adviseable that some military
establishment shall be made at the new intended settlement, not
only to enforce due subordination and obedience, but for the
defence of the settlement against the incursions of the natives;
and as, from the nature of the service to be performed, it is
highly expedient that it should be composed of men accustomed to
and under proper discipline, His Majesty has been pleased to
direct that 100 private marines, with a suitable number of
officers and non-commissioned officers, shall proceed in the
Calcutta to the new settlement, where it is intended they shall
be disembarked for the purposes before-mentioned. They will be
properly victualled by a Commissary immediately after their
landing, and provision has also been made for supplying them with
such tools, implements, and utensils as they may have occasion
for, to render their situation comfortable at the new intended
settlement until such time as they shall be relieved.</p>

<h4>D.&mdash;ACTING LIEUTENANT ROBBINS TO GOVERNOR KING.</h4>
<p class="foot">[<span class="u">Historical Records of New South

<p align="center">H.M. Armed Colonial Vessel Cumberland,</p>
<div align="right">New Year's Harbour, 18th January, 1803.
</div>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>I have the honor to inform you that I anchored with H.M.
Colonial vessel Cumberland, in Elephant Bay, on the 9th December,
1802,* and found the French ships G&eacute;ographe and
Naturaliste at anchor there, the latter of which sail'd that
evening for Europe, but not before I complied with your orders in
respect to Mr. Thompson, whose lres [? letters] I forward with
this.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See King's Instructions to Robbins,
[<span class="u">HIST. RECS. NSW</span>] vol. iv, p. 908; King to
Banks, 9th May, 1803, post, p. 133; and King to Bowen, 1st May,
1803, post, p. 100.]</p>
<p>During our stay in Elephant Bay we had the misfortune to lose
an anchor. The cable having got foul of a rock, it parted in
attempting to weigh it. The buoy ropes getting foul of the cable,
together with the series of bad weather during our stay in the
bay, rendered all attempts of getting it again fruitless. I
sail'd on the 15th for New Year's Island, where I did not arrive
until the 23rd. A gale of wind from the westward, and which
lasted six days, drove us back to Kent's Group.</p>
<p>I left Mr. Grimes and a party at Elephant Bay, who proceeded
and surveyed the coast as far as New Year's Island by the time I
arrived. We have since surveyed the coast within a few miles of
Seal Bay. Some high and perpendicular rocks, over which it is
impossible to walk, prevented the chain from being run any
further. Those rocks or mountains are called by the people on the
island the Saltpetre Mountains. I have with a party crossed the
island from this place into Elephant Bay, and several excursions
has been made on this side of the island. I am sorry that but a
small portion of the island, in my opinion, is fit for
cultivation. Not the smallest quantity of pasture land has been
seen, nor a spring of fresh water, on any part of the island. All
the streams of water, and which are very plentiful on the west
side of the island, come from swamps and lagoons, and with which
the island seems to abound. I saw some pretty good vegetable
mould of a good depth near the centre of the island; but it is
impossible to determine what quantity there may be of it from the
immense thick brush and underwood. In the centre of the island
some large gum-trees were seen; but on the hills, where it is
exposed to the sea air, all the large timber is dead. Some small
spots where the badgers resort is clear of wood, but covered with
heath, and the soil very poor. The centre of the island is level,
and toward the sea coast hilly.</p>
<p>Elephant Bay is a very bad roadstead as it is evidently a bed
of rocks covered with sand. A small vessel may lie pretty well in
New Year's Harbour, but there it is rocks underneath the sand.
One of our cables has got much rubbed by working down on one of
those rocks.</p>
<p>There were eight prisoners found stowed away in the two French
ships, all of which were landed on the island the morning after
our arrival in Elephant Bay, four of which have since made their
escape in the G&eacute;ographe, and a man by the name of Lyons,
one of Mr. Palmer's sealing gang; the remaining four are now on
the island. The G&eacute;ographe sailed from Elephant Bay on the
24th Dec'r, 1802, from where I believe she proceeds to Kangaroo
Island. I shall now proceed for Port Phillip with all possible
dispatch.** By the mean of several sets of obs's I determine the
lat'e of the place where the marque was pitched abreast of New
Year's Islands to be 39&deg; 43' 06" S. and long. 144&deg; 29'
12" E., from which I deduce the lat. of the Elephant's Rock to be
39&deg; 47' 06" S., and long. 144&deg; 52' 12" E.</p>
<p>High water at New Year's Harbour full and change.</p>

under weigh immediately.&mdash;8th, a.m.</p>
