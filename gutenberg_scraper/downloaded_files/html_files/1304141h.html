  <h2>PART ONE</h2>

  <p class="first">"THEY are not to be spoken of; they dwell in darkness!"</p>

  <p>Laura answered swiftly:</p>

  <p>"They dwell in this house!"</p>

  <p>Her brother looked at her with gloomy rebuke.</p>

  <p>"Why must you go over these old stories? I told you before you came here
  that such things were not to be discussed."</p>

  <p>"Remember," retorted the girl, rising nervously and with rebellion in her
  narrowed eyes, "that I did not wish to come here at all. I told you that. I
  wrote down my protests in a letter. Mrs. Sylk knows&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her brother interrupted:</p>

  <p>"There is no need to call witnesses or to make a scene, my dear Laura. I
  know quite well the objections you made to coming to Leppard Hall, and I
  recall with equal clarity my answer. Pray let us have no more of this
  discussion. As to the portraits, it is my wish that they should remain."</p>

  <p>Laura hesitated. She moved from her brother and looked out from the tall
  window across the landscape that she found so distasteful. At the bottom of
  the gentle slope on which the house stood the grey waters of the Avon,
  gleaming from between the dull leaves of the willows, flowed smoothly by
  with, to her, an air of sad monotony.</p>

  <p>She tried to control herself, for the young brother to whom she had spoken
  was her master and might easily be, she knew, her tyrant. She had to play the
  game that women have learned during the ages to be so skilful at, to watch
  her opportunity, to cajole; if need be, to deceive. She was not yet very
  clever at any of these slavish arts and she had to bite her lip now and to
  clench her hands in her palms before she had sufficient control to reply in
  the soft tone she wished to assume.</p>

  <p>Before she spoke she looked over her shoulder at Theodosius. He had
  returned to his manuscripts with an air of absorption as if he had forgotten
  her presence or was contemptuous of it. His fine, pale profile was clearly
  outlined against the dark panelling of the room. His dress, correct and
  severe, was too old for his years, which were not above five and twenty.
  Everything about him was grave and stately, and to Laura disagreeable and
  pedantic; but she bent her pride, and turning towards the desk humiliated
  herself to thrust her problems upon her brother's attention.</p>

  <p>"Theo, pray listen to me. You never give me a chance of talking to you,
  you know."</p>

  <p>"There are the evenings, my dear girl," he replied, raising his tired,
  dark eyes with a cold and impatient glance. "I have my work now. Pray excuse
  me, I am much occupied."</p>

  <p>Laura longed to reply that this absorption in his translations from the
  Encheiridion Epictète of Arrian was not work but a pastime, and a sickly,
  unwholesome pastime at that, for a young man. But she smiled and said:</p>

  <p>"In the evenings you are closeted here, or you expect me to go and sit
  with Mrs. Sylk in my own apartment; or you are going over the accounts with
  Lucius."</p>

  <p>"My dear sister," said Sir Theo firmly, with a slight sigh of resignation
  as he leant back in his chair, "all this is wasting my time and yours. I can
  guess what you want to say to me. You wish to put in a plea for leaving
  Leppard Hall. You want to spend the money that I can ill afford in going
  abroad. You want to enjoy the season, as they term it, in some gay
  capital&mdash;London or Paris, or even Rome."</p>

  <p>"I have no such absurd ideas," put in Laura quickly. "I am quite content
  to live modestly, as long as it be in a town, with some company of my own
  age."</p>

  <p>"My dear child," replied Theo, with exasperating calm, "you are nineteen
  years of age only. It will be time enough for you to go out into the world
  when you have learnt in my home some of the feminine arts that you seem at
  present to lack. You have much wasted, I fear, the two years that you have
  been at Leppard Hall."</p>

  <p>"All that I have wasted here has been myself," replied Laura in a low
  tone, glancing down at the shining floor.</p>

  <p>"You have wasted the opportunity of learning how to run a fairly large
  establishment," remarked her brother severely. "You have not made yourself
  familiar either with my servants, my tenants, or with the neighbours. There
  are a hundred and one things that you should have learnt but have taken no
  notice of."</p>

  <p>"I was bred in the town," protested Laura with a convulsive sigh. "I do
  not like rustic surroundings. Pray, Theo, give me my portion and let me
  go."</p>

  <p>She made the request so suddenly that it seemed crude and violent, like a
  blow interrupting polite conversation.</p>

  <p>Sir Theo raised his heavy eyebrows, which were like slender black
  wings.</p>

  <p>"You speak as if you were out of your senses," he replied sternly. "Our
  parents being dead and we having no relations, where would you go from my
  house?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," replied Laura hurriedly. She felt that she had startled
  him and therefore gained some small advantage and she was anxious to follow
  this up. "Mrs. Sylk and I could go somewhere; I suppose we could take rooms
  or hire a house with servants. I have a few friends in London&mdash;Aunt
  Mary's friends," she added anxiously; "something could be contrived."</p>

  <p>"And why, pray, should there be all this contrivance?" asked Sir Theo with
  rising anger.</p>

  <p>She had often complained and protested before, but never put the matter so
  plainly, and his authority rose to meet her rebellion. His personality was
  impressive and forceful far beyond his years and Laura had an ado to stand
  her ground. The contempt in his voice brought the colour to her face, but she
  did not dare to allow this opportunity to slip. She had at least got him
  roused, interested, if in a hostile manner, in what she was saying; that was
  better than the long cold silences, the dull self-absorption that she could
  never penetrate.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I want a few companions of my own age," she hastened on; "I
  should like a few entertainments, an opportunity of going to the opera, to
  concerts and theatres, of get ting books, of seeing pictures, of giving
  parties of my own."</p>

  <p>"And the end of this, I suppose," he interrupted sarcastically, "is to be
  your marriage to some adventurer whom I shall be supposed to pension for
  life."</p>

  <p>"I have no thought of marriage with an adventurer," said Laura. The colour
  came again to her face and faded. "But I suppose that some day you will
  permit me to marry?"</p>

  <p>"Only when I approve your choice, some long years hence. I do not consider
  you fit for marriage," he replied impatiently. "You want a good deal of
  schooling and training first."</p>

  <p>"Well," said she desperately, "maybe I could obtain that out in the world.
  In London! I tell you I am used to London. I knew Aunt Mary and I lived in
  Hampstead only very modestly, but we did see people. We went about. I have
  lost the few friends I had there, for you never would allow them to come and
  stay here, or me to visit them."</p>

  <p>"You lead the life that is fitting to your station and disposition,"
  replied Sir Theo, rising at last and speaking with a weight uncommon in one
  of his youth; cold and formidable, he stared her down. "I never agreed with
  the designs of your staying with your Aunt Mary Tolls. She was a frivolous
  woman, I dislike the fashion in which she brought you up. I always intended
  to exert my authority as soon as I came of age to take you from under her
  charge. Remember that you were always reported as wild and wilful, even when
  you were at school."</p>

  <p>Laura drew a short breath, then said in a whisper:</p>

  <p>"Our parents did not disapprove of me, at least they did not say so. It is
  only you, Theo, who are always so censorious."</p>

  <p>"Call me censorious if you will, I am acting for your own good," replied
  the young man dryly. "I do not intend to allow you to go to town, I do not
  intend to allow you to have the friends you made when you were under Aunt
  Mary Tollis's charge down at Hampstead, and I have no sympathy with your
  petulant impatience with the life you lead here. There are neighbours whom
  you can visit."</p>

  <p>"They are all elderly people and they live miles away," broke out Laura.
  "I tell you I detest this place! I always did from the moment I came into it.
  I can't understand&mdash;it certainly seems unreasonable, I know..."</p>

  <p>"Your feelings are running away with you, Laura," replied Theo with a
  contemptuous air of finality.</p>

  <p>She was glad that he had stopped her, much as she hated him for his
  continued exercise of authority. She knew that she had said too much, had
  tried to express the intangible. Not to him, so unfriendly, so hostile, could
  she unfold these fearful and delicate feelings.</p>

  <p>"Well, then," she said, "that is my fate. I must stay at Leppard Hall. One
  other thing, while you are listening to me, Theo, even in so cruel a
  spirit&mdash;if I were to come to you and say I wished to be married, that I
  wanted to escape that way, what would you do?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her keenly, suspecting that she was fooling him, trying to
  entrap him into some admission that she might twist to her own use, for he
  was perfectly sure that she had not the acquaintance of any man whom she
  could desire to marry.</p>

  <p>"Your husband," he replied immediately, "would have to meet with my
  complete approval. Remember the terms of our father's will. I think at the
  end he was alarmed himself about your frivolous disposition. He left your
  future entirely in my hands. If you marry without my consent, I need not pay
  a penny of dowry."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Laura, still holding her head high, "I might find a man who
  had enough money to keep me."</p>

  <p>"Such talk is unbecoming," replied the baronet. He began to show signs of
  impatience; the interview had been long and exhausting. He really disliked
  his sister, who in everything was different from himself. He intended to do
  his duty by her, and that exasperated his ill-feeling towards her. For she
  was a burden, a responsibility, a constant vexation.</p>

  <p>"Pray," said he, "let us have no more of this. I am not to be moved."</p>

  <p>She believed him, and being too well-bred and too proud to break out into
  reproaches, she merely said:</p>

  <p>"Can I once more ask you to have the two portraits moved?"</p>

  <p>"I shall refuse," he replied. He in his turn was flushed, his well-shaped
  lips quivered slightly; he had not much reserve of physical strength, and
  these disputes with Laura, in whom he sensed a hidden spirit as strong as his
  own, always in the end slightly unnerved him. "If I begin to give way to your
  follies, I should strip the Hall from attic to cellar and still not please
  you. The portraits remain where they are."</p>

  <p>Laura turned away. From the door she said in a low voice, looking over her
  shoulder:</p>

  <p>"I wish you would strip the whole place, I wish it would be burnt down. It
  ought to have been destroyed years ago."</p>

  <p>He gave her a startled look at that, but controlled himself quickly and
  turned again to his thick piles of papers.</p>

  <p>Laura closed the door and stood in the dark corridor, agitated and
  desperately angry, surprised too. Why had she said those last words? She knew
  no good reason why Leppard Hall should have been destroyed. It was a fine
  building that had been in the possession of the Sarelles for many hundreds of
  years. No legend of horror, no ghostly fable attached to it so far as she
  knew. She had spoken, she supposed, out of mere spite because she disliked
  the place so much, because she had been so unhappy there for two
  years&mdash;two long, dragging years of her youth that should have been so
  bright and happy.</p>

  <p>Not only did she detest Leppard Hall and the park, the gloomy mill and the
  stone farmhouse, the winding river with the Georgian bridge; she detested
  also the flat, dull pastoral landscape with the alders and the willows and
  the continually browsing black cattle, the thorn-trees and the water meadows.
  She disliked the church, which half a mile or so along the river rose clear
  grey into the grey skies, with the clustered lichened graves rising above the
  sloping banks where the black, ragged cedar cast a shade into the water.
  Gloomy to her was the small grey village and the small, dark inn, the
  <i>Sarelle Arms</i>; dull and stupid seemed the rustic inhabitants; fiercely
  she regretted the day that her parents had come into an inheritance that had
  meant to her a life so melancholy and, as she thought, unnatural.</p>

  <p>She and her brother had both been born in Jamaica, where her father had
  owned considerable property. As his elder brother was childless he had long
  known that he was likely to come into the English castle-estate, and for that
  reason Theo had been sent as a child to England and educated at Eton and
  Magdalen College, Oxford, while her mother's sister, Mrs. Mary Tollis, had
  taken her, when she had left the boarding-school for gentlewomen at Clapham,
  and brought her up as her own daughter at Hampstead, when Laura's mother had
  died of the fever at Kingston.</p>

  <p>Her husband had not long survived Elizabeth Sarelle, and Theo had been
  educated well, as became the heir-presumptive, but with a sparing hand, by
  his uncle, a quiet, eccentric man fond of travelling, who had not often
  resided himself at Leppard Hall.</p>

  <p>The estate, however, had been well maintained by a succession of
  well-chosen stewards, and on the death of Sir John Sarelle, when Theo was
  nineteen years of age, the estate and the fortune had been administered with
  scrupulous efficiency and honesty by the two guardians whom he had appointed
  for his young nephew.</p>

  <p>At first this change of fortune had made no difference to Laura. Her life
  with good-natured and charming Mary Tollis was as pleasant as that of a
  nervous, introspective and sensitive girl, bereaved of both her parents and
  without a home of her own, could be.</p>

  <p>When Sir Theo had attained his majority he had decided to take up his
  residence at Leppard Hall, and, Mary Tollis being then recently dead, he had
  brought his sister to live with him, after some delays, when he was
  twenty-three and she seventeen years of age.</p>

  <p>They had now no near relations, but a distant cousin of Mary Tollis, a
  Mrs. Hetty Sylk, the childless widow of an Army officer, 'who had left her in
  "straitened circumstances', as the genteel phrase went, was engaged as
  companion for Laura.</p>

  <p>This was her life, all that had happened to her in her nine teen years. An
  early childhood in Jamaica that she could remember merely as a flash of
  brilliant, strange colour, the quiet, unsatisfying, but tolerable life in the
  boarding-school at Clapham, the pleasant days with Mrs. Tolls in the
  flat-fronted brick house at Hampstead, and the two hateful years at Leppard
  Hall.</p>

  <p>The girl could not have told why she disliked her ancestral home. She
  supposed it was merely because it was lonely and she was cut off from her
  usual friends and interests. There was no railway station nearer than Rugby
  and no carriage ever at her disposal to drive her so far, even if she had
  been able to obtain her brother's consent to a visit to London.</p>

  <p>It was true that a few miles farther along the river there was a handsome
  Palladian mansion inhabited by a noble family that was disposed to be
  friendly. But they were usually in town or abroad, and there was none of them
  of the age of Laura.</p>

  <p>When she had first taken up her residence at Leppard Hall, people had
  called, leaving their visiting-cards. And she, setting out in the brougham
  with the Sarelle arms on the panels, had returned these calls in the
  respectable company of Mrs. Sylk. But no friendships, no acquaintances, no
  intimacies had grown out of these formalities. Laura believed that Sir Theo
  had let it be plainly understood that he did not wish to have the routine
  that he had laid down for himself disturbed by any social activities.
  Besides, the neighbours all lived far away and seemed entirely absorbed in
  their own interests and only too ready to respect Sir Theo's wishes for
  solitude. He did not hunt now or join in any of the local activities of
  Sarelle.</p>

  <p>The Vicar was a dull man with a sickly wife who seemed, to Laura's young
  vitality, scarcely alive. Dr. Selby came from Warwick and made his rounds in
  a smart gig twice a week. There was no other company whatsoever of her own
  station or class, and Laura, who had the timid reserve of the townswoman, was
  never able to get on friendly terms either with the servants, some of whom
  had been in the service of Sir John Sarelle, her uncle, or with the
  tenantry.</p>

  <p>The people at the stone mill and the home farm had no more character and
  individuality of their own in the eyes of the lonely girl than had the sheep
  and cattle that browsed on the lush water-meadows. They were to Laura merely
  part of the landscape.</p>

  <p>Her brother's reproach that she had taken no interest in the running of
  his large and precise establishment had been just. Trained in a small though
  genteel household, she had no taste for the management of a large mansion.
  Besides, it was all done very efficiently without her interference. There was
  a housekeeper, there was a cook, there were maids, there were other servants,
  gardeners and stablemen, a household of twenty-five and sometimes thirty
  people.</p>

  <p>Proud and shy about her own intimate affairs, she had refused a personal
  maid, but Mrs. Sylk, who had advanced as far in her friendship as anyone had
  been able to do, contrived to wait on her while preserving the relationship
  of a friend.</p>

  <p>Once during one of the scenes in which she had tried to force her brother
  to allow her to alter her way of life, Laura had extracted from him the
  promise that when she was twenty-one years old she should be allowed a season
  in town and that he would then use his influence to procure her introductions
  to people who might present her at Court, allow her some reasonable pleasure,
  and finally choose for her a husband suitable to her pretensions.</p>

  <p>But Laura was only nineteen years of age, and to be told to endure two
  more years of this life at Leppard Hall seemed to her like a death
  sentence.</p>

  <p>Besides, she had already settled for ever, as she knew, the question of
  where she should dispose her heart, and, when opportunity arose, her person
  and her fortune.</p>

  <p>She went slowly up the stairs to the apartments that she occupied with
  Mrs. Sylk. She had chosen them carefully because she believed that they were
  the least gloomy in the house. Yet she had never liked them, the more
  especially as she had not been allowed to alter the furnishings. Even the
  very curtains of the bed and at the windows were those that came out of the
  closet at Leppard Hall. They were well-preserved, beautiful in texture and
  design, but had to Laura an old-fashioned air that was, she could not tell
  why, repellent.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk was by the window, employed in the eternal occupation of
  well-bred, idle women: she was embroidering on a tambour frame a bell-rope of
  lilac silk, quickly working a lily with chalk-white leaves.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mrs. Sylk," said Laura in a flat voice, "I had no success again. He
  will not listen to me. He will not even have the two portraits removed."</p>

  <p>"Sir Theodosius is certainly a very determined young man," remarked Mrs.
  Sylk.</p>

  <p>She put down her frame with a little sigh of boredom, quickly restrained
  and turned into a smile; she never allowed herself to forget that she was in
  a dependent position. She, too, found Leppard Hall galling in its gloom and
  loneliness, but she was a woman who had known what it was to be very
  uncomfortable, in every sense of the word, through poverty, who had often
  been humiliated and frightened by sheer lack of money. She had had a glimpse,
  though a glimpse only, of what the world might look like to a useless
  gentlewoman. At Leppard Hall she was at least comfortable and respected. She
  had, even, a slight sense of importance, of power. Laura was fond of her and
  she believed she had a certain influence over the girl. Perhaps one day Laura
  Sarelle would make a good, even a splendid, marriage, and she, Mrs. Sylk,
  might enjoy a more exciting kind of life. But for the moment she might have
  been very much worse off, therefore she was careful never to complain and
  always to make herself as pleasant as possible to her young employer, though
  behind his back sometimes, cautiously, she encouraged Laura in rebellion.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't concern myself so much about the portraits, dear," she said
  mildly. "That is really very fanciful on your part. You know your Aunt Mary
  Tollis was always concerned over that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Over my fancies?" said Laura quickly. "But I never told her any of
  them."</p>

  <p>"Didn't you?" queried Mrs. Sylk, still very quietly. "But she used to talk
  to me about them sometimes; I think perhaps you revealed more than you knew,
  Laura."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked the girl. "Did she say that I used to talk in my
  sleep, or have fits, or something of that kind?"</p>

  <p>"Why, no, dear, of course not. But I suppose your aunt was very fond of
  you and studied you very carefully. And&mdash;well, really, Laura, I don't
  know what we're talking about."</p>

  <p>She broke off, smiled, and began to pick up the small chalk-white beads
  one by one and-thread them on to her fine needle.</p>

  <p>"We're talking about those two portraits in the dining-room," persisted
  Laura. "Let everything else go. I suppose it's hopeless to try to get away
  from here. I can't even make out a good case for myself, but he might remove
  the portraits, since he knows how much I dislike them."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk mentally agreed, but tried to compromise by pointing out that
  the paintings were quite pleasing and that no sinister kind of tale was
  attached to them.</p>

  <p>"But there is," cried Laura, "to one at least&mdash;that of my namesake.
  Theo himself said just now, 'They dwell in darkness'. And what did I answer?
  I answered, 'They dwell in this house!'"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that old tale," smiled Mrs. Sylk comfortably. "I should not take any
  notice of it, probably it's not even true."</p>

  <p>"But I'm quite sure it's true," cried Laura impatiently. "Theo doesn't
  even deny it. She had my name, you know; it makes it so strange&mdash;Laura
  Sarelle."</p>

  <p>"But she was hardly a relation, you know," said Mrs. Sylk. "She died
  unmarried and the estate went to a distant cousin. You might say that with
  her that line of the Sarelles ended. Yours was another branch, it came from
  Yorkshire, I think."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Laura sullenly; "I've never seen the family tree or
  any papers. You see, I was very young when I left Jamaica and nobody talked
  to me about these things. Theo's always most reserved, and seems so angry
  when I want to know. Not that I do much," she added idly; "what does it
  matter? It's only our having the same name&mdash;that dead woman and
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's usual in families. People are often very proud of those
  things. It's always been Laura and Theodosius and John, I think, and Anne,
  with the Sarelles."</p>

  <p>"She was very unhappy. She died young, and I don't care to have her
  portrait hanging on the wall."</p>

  <p>"My dear child," said Mrs. Sylk, "in those days so many people died young.
  They didn't know how to look after themselves and the science of medicine
  wasn't even in existence then."</p>

  <p>"But you know there was a scandal. Someone in the house, either someone
  who was staying there, or the cousin&mdash;I don't know, I can't get the
  story straight&mdash;died of an overdose of a sleeping-draught and there was
  an inquest. And even"&mdash;Laura lowered her voice&mdash;"some suspicion
  that she, this girl, had given it to him&mdash;by carelessness. I don't know
  the reason or the motive&mdash;whatever you would call it."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk stopped her at once.</p>

  <p>"It's all nonsense, just some foolish gossip, as there always is in a
  place like this. I heard the same tale. I can assure you there's nothing in
  it. Of course there was an inquest. I tell you in those days they knew so
  little&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Laura interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Those days! You know when it was, then&mdash;the date?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's on the picture, isn't it?" said Mrs. Sylk with a touch of
  impatience.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is. It was painted in 1780, and that's the date of the inquest,
  and I suppose with the least trouble in the world one could find out all
  about it. But you know Theo keeps his books locked up, and as for his
  papers&mdash;one may never have a glimpse of them."</p>

  <p>"My dear Laura, you're allowing your imagination to run away with you. You
  really should be a writer of fiction, you want to make a story out of
  everything. I tell you that Sir Theo himself doesn't know any more than I do.
  Seventeen-eighty, and this is the year eighteen-forty. Why, you must admit
  that it's a good long while ago."</p>

  <p>"Only sixty years," said Laura. "She might have been alive now, and not
  such a very old woman either."</p>

  <p>"But she isn't alive," urged Mrs. Sylk. "She died young, of a consumption
  in the lungs, as I suppose, and she's buried in the church and there's no
  need for anyone to, think any more about her. And as for the stupid story of
  the young man who died of the sleeping-draught, by accident, I think it's all
  quite commonplace. Such things happened very often, as I told you, when so
  little was known about medicine."</p>

  <p>"Do you think the other portrait is the young man?"</p>

  <p>"Why, no, I shouldn't suppose so."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk was trying to change the subject but did not know how to do it.
  She wished that Sir Theo would not be so inconsiderate; why not move the two
  pictures that exasperated his fanciful sister?</p>

  <p>"No one knows who it is, do they? I suppose from the costume it's about
  the same period," she added nervously.'</p>

  <p>"Well, it's not so long ago, only sixty years," repeated Laura
  impatiently, "and it's strange the name should have been lost. And I don't
  know who placed the picture there." She then went on to say hurriedly that
  the servants who had been with Sir John had told her that they had not
  noticed it during his lifetime. They thought that one of the stewards must
  have found it there, because it was such a fine piece of work.</p>

  <p>"And a very splendid painting it is," said Mrs. Sylk critically, "and if I
  were you, my dear Laura, I shouldn't think any more of it. I believe that
  Laura Sarelle had a brother who died young."</p>

  <p>"Died!" said Laura, on a rising note. "You see, they all died. No one at
  Leppard Hall seems to have lived very long."</p>

  <p>"What perfect foolishness!" exclaimed Mrs. Sylk with upraised hands. "Why,
  Sir John was a good age."</p>

  <p>"He didn't live here," Laura put in quickly. "Nor did his father. They
  were always abroad or in London. Yes, that's strange when you come to think
  of it. My father, my uncle and my grandfather hardly lived at Leppard Hall at
  all. Perhaps that's why I think it has such a melancholy air. It's never been
  lived in since Laura Sarelle died here sixty years ago."</p>

  <p>"The stewards lived here, I suppose," countered. Mrs. Sylk suddenly, weary
  of the whole argument but aware that it was her duty and her interest to
  humour her charge.</p>

  <p>"No, they didn't, they lived at the Dower House."</p>

  <p>Laura moved to the window and looked across the flat water-meadows over
  which dusk was falling.</p>

  <p>"Well, the place was very well kept up, anyhow," said Mrs. Sylk feebly.
  "But, Laura, my child, pray don't talk of it any more, you only exasperate
  yourself. You will work yourself into one of your difficult fits and have a
  fever, or bad dreams, or something. Now pray, my dear girl," she added
  earnestly, "be sensible. The portraits are the most ordinary things in the
  world, and if you affect to regard them so they will cease to irritate
  you."</p>

  <p>"The portraits&mdash;oh, well, I suppose they are nothing. But when I said
  'they dwell in darkness' Theo did not contradict me. There was some ugly
  story there. The young man died, and the young woman was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk interrupted:</p>

  <p>"Was questioned at the inquest as to the sleeping-draught he had taken.
  Now, my dear Laura, forget all about it. Don't you see, my dear child, it
  would be very wise of you to try to please your brother, then perhaps he
  might be induced to take a more reasonable view of your situation?"</p>

  <p>"Then you admit," cried Laura, "that he is not reasonable?"</p>

  <p>"I think," said Mrs. Sylk, with a non-committal air, "he is rather a
  remarkable young man. He is a great scholar, you know, and that is very
  uncommon in one of his age. Then he takes his duties as squire very
  seriously. He looks after the estate in an excellent manner."</p>

  <p>"No," said Laura with a queer look, "it's Lucius who does that."</p>

  <p>"Well, Sir Theodosius directs him. I don't think Mr. Delaunay could do
  anything himself. It is a large estate, you know, and then there is the
  property in Warwick and in Rugby as well."</p>

  <p>She glanced at the young girl's charming face and thought she saw a softer
  expression on the lovely features. So she hastily took the opportunity of
  saying:</p>

  <p>"You know, you are a remarkable young woman, too, Laura. If your brother
  is not very reasonable, neither are you. It is not so very extraordinary for
  him to expect you to live here and learn to be the mistress of a great
  establishment. No doubt he hopes for a fine match for you and wishes to see
  you well trained. Why not be more patient and take the trouble to cultivate
  acquaintanceship of some of the neighbouring gentry? You know that when
  people have called you have very often been abrupt and aloof. You might
  mingle, too, more with the tenantry, hold a little singing class or sewing
  class for the children."</p>

  <p>Laura did not listen as Mrs. Sylk rambled on, stitching her white beads on
  to her strip of stiff lilac silk. She startled the good lady by breaking
  suddenly into her pious discourse by saying:</p>

  <p>"Why do you think I so dislike this place? You know, I have the sensation
  that I have been here before and under most evil circumstances."</p>

  <p>"That is very common," replied Mrs. Sylk, slightly nettled at the
  interruption which showed that all her good counsel had been wasted. "Nobody
  knows quite what it means," she added vaguely. "Then, as I told you just now,
  Laura, you were always very fanciful and even fantastic."</p>

  <p>"The moment I saw the place I hated it," mused Laura, with her chin in her
  hands and her elbow on her knees as she sat in the cushioned window-seat
  gazing out on the meadows and the river, now drowsing into grey mist. "When I
  saw the gates at the bottom of the park I said to myself: 'So I have to come
  back here again after all these years.' I didn't want to come, Mrs. Sylk, I
  detested the place. You know, I always resisted visiting it when Theo used to
  come on those rare occasions when Uncle John invited him. And I managed to
  get out of that because they said there was no suitable accommodation for a
  lady&mdash;" She paused sharply. "I wonder why I'm talking like this! I'm not
  usually so foolish, am I, Mrs. Sylk? But that interview with Theo upset me. I
  feel like a prisoner."</p>

  <p>"You should conquer these feelings," said Mrs. Sylk. "And as for the
  place, it is a very fine mansion and very well kept, and you lack for
  nothing. And I cannot think," she added untruthfully, "that it is
  particularly gloomy, or particularly isolated."</p>

  <p>Laura laughed in her face.</p>

  <p>"It is the most melancholy, most solitary house in the world," she
  replied.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk murmured a protest, but privately she held that opinion also.
  There was no good reason why Leppard Hall should be more dreary than any
  other country house set in its own grounds, and Hetty Sylk had never tried to
  argue out with herself why this particular building gave an impression of
  gloom.</p>

  <p>She did not know the age of it, but it had certainly been re-fronted in
  the eighteenth century, for the facade was of grey stone in a severe
  Palladian style with a porch and pillars. At the back was a gabled wing and
  the irregular buildings of the stables, which were furnished with a cupola
  and a clock-tower. Not far away was the stone mill on the quay river with a
  huge waterwheel and the date 1605 over the door. The door was also of
  dun-coloured stone and even older than the mill. The parkland stretched to
  the river's edge with a fringe of willows, alders and waterfiags at one side
  and to the village, the other. A broad treeless avenue led across this
  parkland to the front of the Hall.</p>

  <p>What was there, Mrs. Sylk wondered, in all this to impart that sensation
  of intense melancholy even on a fine summer day? She certainly had felt it
  herself from the first moment that she had come to stay at Leppard Hall, and
  she could not wonder that Laura, quick, sensitive, and, as she had said
  herself, fanciful and even fantastical, was much oppressed by the atmosphere
  of her home.</p>

  <p>She herself was not imaginative and often could shake off the gloomy
  impression given her by her surroundings; both by training and by necessity
  she was a practical woman.</p>

  <p>"Laura, love," she said, "don't sit there brooding in the window. It is
  time to change for dinner. I shall ring to have some candles brought up and
  then perhaps you might, when the curtains are drawn, tell me how my
  embroidery looks by artificial light."</p>

  <p>But Laura said sullenly:</p>

  <p>"I'm not going down to dinner to-night. I have a headache, I feel
  sick."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>That evening at dinner Mrs. Sylk scrutinized with a heightened interest
  the two portraits that Laura so much disliked. She had, of course, observed
  the pictures before, but never keenly, even though she had heard the girl
  frequently exclaim against them. But there had been a vehemence and a
  persistence in Laura's talk to-night that had pierced Mrs. Sylk's commonplace
  mind. She had been impressed, too, with the fact that the girl really did
  seem ill and that her refusal to come down to dinner was not a mere formal
  excuse.</p>

  <p>At the same time the discreet woman had no wish to offend her employer, so
  it was only now and then, and furtively, that she glanced at the two
  pictures.</p>

  <p>They hung side by side at the end of the long dining-room, each fitting
  exactly into one of the large polished panels. The picture that represented,
  without doubt, Laura Sarelle (the name was written in the top left-hand
  corner of the canvas) was not, Mrs. Sylk thought, of any particular artistic
  merit. Indeed, the painting was rather flat and drab, as if it had been
  varnished and then cleaned.</p>

  <p>It showed a young woman, primly dressed in a long tight-waisted gown of
  the palest primrose colour with a bow of pale-blue-and-cream-striped ribbon
  tucked into her narrow bosom. Her hair was either very pale or powdered and
  gathered straight off her face. Her features were scarcely to be discerned,
  so lightly had the painter indicated them, but they appeared to be regular;
  the eyes, which had been put in with a firmer touch, were large and of a
  clean, clear brown colour. A fleeting harmony was given to this indifferent
  painting by the fact that the background was formed of a dark-green curtain
  looped away from a landscape bathed in a faint hazy light and that the lady
  held in her hand a branch of laurel. These dark-green hues, harmoniously
  chosen, set off pleasantly the pale hues of rose, primrose and blue that
  composed the lady's dress and complexion.</p>

  <p>Nothing, Mrs. Sylk thought, could have been more inoffensive than this
  portrait, and she was really puzzled to know why Laura should regard it, as
  she undoubtedly did, with feelings of aversion and even horror.</p>

  <p>'Really,' she thought, 'the child is extraordinarily fanciful, sometimes
  almost unbalanced.'</p>

  <p>The portrait of Laura Sarelle was handsomely framed in carved oak, touched
  here and there with gold leaf, and the design of this frame was also of
  laurel leaves, boldly interlacing one another, making, therefore, a setting
  more fitting for the portrait of a warrior than of a gentle lady.</p>

  <p>The other portrait was a very superior performance, and Mrs. Sylk, who
  affected to be something of a connoisseur, had always admired it. It was
  believed to be, she knew, by Thomas Gainsborough, and she was surprised that
  a picture by so famous an artist had neither a history nor a name.</p>

  <p>It represented a young man in a blue coat, also against a background of
  green, this time thickly interlaced with trees, who had his hand on his hip
  lifting the skirts of his coat so that the light shone on the thick glossy
  azure satin and looking directly at the spectator. His hair was slightly
  powdered and negligently dressed; small ringlets broke loose from the ribbon
  and hung down either side his alert, handsome and impressive face. The
  portrait, which was most vital and arresting both in pose and impression, was
  lightly put in with a few masterly strokes and appeared to be unfinished.
  Mrs. Sylk was not so fortunate as to be able to conceal her curious interest
  in the pictures. Sir Theodosius suddenly remarked with more than his
  accustomed dryness:</p>

  <p>"I see, Mrs. Sylk, that you are infected by poor Laura's passion for those
  two pictures. Do you also object to them and wish them removed?"</p>

  <p>This remark was made in so dry and cutting a manner that a faint flush
  came into the cheeks of the poor dependant. She was a gentlewoman, and as an
  officer's wife had been used to some authority in her time. She knew how she
  would have answered such a remark had she been at her own table. She risked a
  slight coldness in her reply, allowing her pride for once to override her
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, Sir Theodosius, Laura seemed very upset tonight. I think that's
  the reason of the headache that she made the excuse for not coming down."</p>

  <p>Sir Theodosius interrupted:</p>

  <p>"Ill-temper is always behind Laura's headaches."</p>

  <p>"I believe," persisted Mrs. Sylk with a courage that surprised herself,
  "that it's not quite ill-temper to-night, sir. She was really distressed. I
  think that if you could oblige her by removing the portraits she would be
  much more at ease."</p>

  <p>Theodosius smiled unpleasantly and leant back in the high chair with arms,
  the master's chair that he always occupied at the head of the table.</p>

  <p>"I told Laura this afternoon, Mrs. Sylk, that she was talking a great deal
  of nonsense, and if I were to begin to remove the pictures in this house at
  her wish I should soon have nothing else to do. Surely you, madam, with your
  experience, must know how foolish it would be to give in to the whim of an
  undisciplined girl."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk felt rebuked. She pressed her lips together and sat silent. The
  meal was always slightly disagreeable; she never could feel entirely
  comfortable in the presence of Theodosius, though the room was so handsome,
  the food so expensive and well-served, the service so efficient.</p>

  <p>She looked with a glance of unconscious appeal at the third person
  present, and he good-naturedly came to the rescue with:</p>

  <p>"Yes, I heard Laura speak about the portraits. What's the matter with
  them? They look ordinary enough to me, though one's a fine piece of
  work&mdash;by Thomas Gainsborough, is it not? Do you know whom it represents,
  Theo?"</p>

  <p>"No one knows," replied the master of the house, shortly. "Mr. Hewett, the
  steward before your time, Lucius, told me it had been found in the garret;
  there's no name or date on it and it's not a signed canvas. But it was shown
  to several <i>cognoscenti</i> in London and they thought it was a Thomas
  Gainsborough. So it was hung here, and very fine it looks. It happened to be
  the same size as the portrait of the former Laura Sarelle, and so it was
  placed there. They make, I think, a fine pair and a handsome ornament to the
  dining-room."</p>

  <p>"Yes, except that one picture," said Mr. Delaunay good-humouredly, "is so
  superior to the other that the eyes are rather vexed in making the
  comparison. Why not take them down, Theo, and put them somewhere else, or
  even put them away altogether if they vex Laura? After all," he added
  lightly, "some people might object to seeing a portrait of a namesake who
  died years ago. And wasn't there some story about her&mdash;something rather
  questionable or unpleasant?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk was very grateful that Lucius Delaunay had thus come to her help
  and given the conversation both a lighter and more pleasant turn. But she was
  dismayed by the effect of these remarks on Sir Theodosius Sarelle.</p>

  <p>They had come to the end of the elaborate dinner, always too long and too
  elaborate, Hetty Sylk thought, for people who lived so quietly in such a
  solitary mansion, and the young baronet was leaning back in the high chair
  that rose above his head in foliated scrolls. Hothouse fruit, peaches,
  grapes, and nectarines had been placed on the table in a high epergne of
  silver-gilt, the candles in their massive silver sticks had just been snuffed
  by the footman. In front of Sir Theodosius was his plate of fine china
  painted with plums, the tall rosy golden Venetian wine-glass, which he had
  not used, for he was very abstemious, and the agate-handled dessert knife and
  fork.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk wondered why she noticed these details. There come moments, even
  in the lives of the most ordinary people, when they see their surroundings
  with a sudden clarity as if they were presented before them like a picture,
  something that has nothing to do with their lives, something that they are
  permitted to view as a disinterested spectator.</p>

  <p>Such a moment had come to Mrs. Sylk. She sat erect in her chair, one hand
  raised to the bosom of her grey silk dress. No one spoke or moved for a
  moment and the illusion to her was perfect&mdash;that she had returned from
  another world and was looking in on this scene, wondering at it.</p>

  <p>A scene that was commonplace enough, in which there was nothing to be
  amazed at, yet Mrs. Sylk knew that she was mere than amazed, she was filled
  with a certain inner horror.</p>

  <p>The room had been for two years most familiar to her, for there, save on
  the rare occasions when Sir Theodosius had been in town and the ladies had
  dined or lunched alone, she had taken all her meals. She knew it so well, the
  long handsome apartment with the windows curtained in maroon velvet, which
  gave on to the sloping parkland stretched in gentle undulations to the river,
  the panelled walls, the wide hearth with the handsome overmantel, the ceiling
  older than the façade of the house with its plaster design of Jacobean
  workmanship, the two winged chairs of needlework that flanked the gleaming
  andirons, the other chairs placed along the straight carved dining-table,
  each with its embroidered cushions and polished leather seat, the sconces of
  deep silver on the walls not often used, for Theodosius preferred a
  table-light.</p>

  <p>Yes, there was that thrice-familiar background and those two familiar
  figures seated at the table with the wine and the fruit, the sweets, the
  napkins, the silver and agate service before them; there was Theodosius in
  his black evening clothes, his black silk stock high up under his chin, the
  white point of his collar showing either side his pale face, one hand to his
  breast just as she held her own, the other on the arm of his chair, his
  attitude indolent but his expression alert.</p>

  <p>And facing her, to the left of the young baronet, was the Irish steward,
  Lucius Delaunay, a man who frequently partook of these stately meals.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk did not know him very well, since his province never impinged on
  hers. All she saw of him was on formal occasions, or an odd glimpse when she
  might meet him riding across the park or the home fields, or staying his
  horse to talk to the miller or the man at the home farm. All she knew of him
  was that he had met Sir Theodosius at Oxford and that they shared a common
  love for ancient languages. And that Lucius Delaunay was 'the penniless cadet
  of a noble house', as the phrase shaped in her conventional mind, and she
  supposed that he had little or no fortune and had been glad to accept the
  post that his friend had offered him when he had come into his estate. Mrs.
  Sylk supposed, too, that Mr. Delaunay had friends and interests of his own,
  for not infrequently he left Leppard Hall for visits to Warwick, Rugby, or
  London; once he had gone to Ireland. But on the whole he seemed content to
  share the lonely and solitary life of the young baronet.</p>

  <p>He must be, Mrs. Sylk imagined, a good scholar, since he spent a great
  deal of his leisure in the cabinet where Sir Theodosius kept his learned
  books piled. But he was not of the same type as the man who employed him, but
  an athlete, a Rood horseman, genial, serene, liked by all who knew him, and
  loved by any towards whom he unbent.</p>

  <p>In her ordinary way, for she was usually far too preoccupied with her own
  affairs to give much attention to those of other people, Mrs. Sylk had
  wondered at Lucius Delaunay. He was extremely good-looking and had a quality
  of magnificence and splendour, yet these graces and gifts he seemed to keep
  concealed, as if he were purposely keeping himself down and might be in
  everything more emphatic than he was. She supposed, vaguely, knowing how it
  felt to be in a subservient position, that this was because, though of as
  good birth as Sir Theodosius himself, he was yet in the position of a paid
  servant.</p>

  <p>She was conscious, though not very sensitive, of great reserves in the
  young man, though his manners were always easy and genial. She found him very
  pleasant to look at, not only because of his handsome features but because of
  his vital air and spirited glance.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk, whose own hair and eyes were of no particular colour at all,
  but hazel, also faintly disliked dark people, and both Sir Theodosius and
  Laura were very dark, with what Mrs. Sylk called vaguely to herself 'a
  foreign blackness' in hair and eyes. But Lucius Delaunay was blond, with a
  bright reddish lustre in his strongly growing hair that contrasted pleasantly
  with eyes of a greenish-blue, flecked, Mrs. Sylk thought in her sentimental
  mood, with gold.</p>

  <p>She had often wondered, 'Why does Lucius Delaunay remain at Leppard Hall?
  I should have thought a young man like that could have done better for
  himself&mdash;the Army, for instance.' And then she remembered what her own
  husband's life had been in the Army without any money, and she checked the
  vague and wandering surmisings. No doubt a young man of a noble house, with
  expensive tastes and no money, could hardly do better for himself than Lucius
  Delaunay was doing, any more than she, Mrs. Sylk, could do better for
  herself.</p>

  <p>Now she looked at him across the table, and from him to Sir Theodosius,
  who remained motionless, and the scene was imprinted with an odd grimness on
  her mind, and she thought, like somebody beginning to go into a hypnotic
  trance: 'Why <i>am</i> I here, what are we all doing? And who are these two
  people?'</p>

  <p>The fair young man and the dark young man looking at each other without
  speaking and changing, or so she thought, while she looked at them. Not in
  their faces so much as in their costumes, which seemed to slip and blur into
  the fashion of another day, into the fashion of the man in the portrait at
  the end of the room. The candlelight was playing tricks, she was beginning to
  be infected with poor Laura's fancies. She moved abruptly and the scene
  seemed to shift into reality again, and Sir Theodosius said coldly:</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything about any unpleasant story, Lucius. My father and
  my uncle were both set against all superstitions. I thought I told you that I
  inherited my admiration of the stoics."</p>

  <p>'What's he talking about?' thought Mrs. Sylk. Then she remembered the
  former conversation. Of course, it must have been only a minute, perhaps, a
  second, ago that Lucius Delaunay had made his casual and pleasant remark, but
  it seemed to her as if a long time had passed.</p>

  <p>She tried to regain her composure and cried at random and
  tactlessly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Oh, but there was something, wasn't there, Sir Theodosius? Some trouble
  with an inquest and that. Laura Sarelle was supposed to have given an
  overdose of a sleeping-draught?"</p>

  <p>Sir Theodosius' dark eyes were turned on her in angry amazement and the
  wretched woman wondered how she could have been so rash and foolish, she who
  had been so careful and knew that her very bread depended upon her
  prudence.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't know what I'm saying," she stammered, with an apology
  that emphasized her mistake; "it's only gossip. Of course, there are stories
  like these in all old families."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, there are, madam," agreed the young baronet dryly. "This is
  nothing at all, I assure you. I think, also, I told you, when you first came
  into my employment, that I was entirely against the repetition of any
  nonsensical stories of this kind. This Laura Sarelle"&mdash;he glanced down
  the long room at the faint portrait in its pale harmonies against the dark
  background&mdash;"was, I believe, a very foolish young woman, ill-educated
  and eccentric as so many people were in those days."</p>

  <p>They were all looking at the portrait now, and Mrs. Sylk thought that the
  thin smile on the narrow painted lips had an air of mockery, as if that Laura
  knew that she was being discussed and despised them for their ill
  manners.</p>

  <p>"Was she foolish?" asked Lucius Delaunay frankly. "I think she looks
  charming. What did she do? I suppose I, too, am forbidden to pry into your
  family secrets, Theo?"</p>

  <p>He spoke lightly and pleasantly, and the other young man made an effort to
  reply in the same tone, but there was a sombre undercurrent to his voice as
  he said:</p>

  <p>"I can't think how Laura got hold of the tale. It was my father's and my
  uncle's wish that it should be kept from her. You see, that woman, that Laura
  Sarelle, was the last of the main line of the family. My grandfather was the
  first of the cadet branch from Yorkshire, she was the sole heiress of all the
  property, she died young. There certainly was"&mdash;he spoke with what
  seemed a doubt, a hesitation&mdash;"some stupid story, an inquest, yes, some
  mistake with a sleeping-draught&mdash;I suppose you've heard it, Mrs.
  Sylk?"</p>

  <p>The question was like a challenge and the poor dependant was glad that she
  could reply truthfully:</p>

  <p>"Indeed, no, I've heard nothing. Laura said something, but it was quite
  vague."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose my Aunt Mary Tollis may have told her. She wouldn't know
  much either. It's all a long time ago and, as I had hoped, forgotten."</p>

  <p>"But surely it's the most trifling incident," remarked Lucius Delaunay.
  "An inquest! And who was it died from the overdose of the
  sleeping-draught?"</p>

  <p>He interrupted himself to ask this abruptly, and again that silence of a
  second fell and again Mrs. Sylk had the impression that everyone in the room
  was fixed, immobile, with blurred outlines as if they were wavering into
  other personalities. Yes, even Jeffries, the servant, who had entered the
  room with fresh candles, seemed to take on another look, another habit.</p>

  <p>"It was a cousin who was staying in the house at the time. He was
  extremely sickly, like Laura Sarelle herself," said the young baronet
  deliberately. "They did not know much about medicine in those days. I think
  they sent into Rugby to get some mixture of jalap for his cough. He either
  had the wrong mixture or took an overdose and died. This unfortunate girl had
  been the one who had administered it to him. She was questioned, I believe,
  rather sharply at the inquest. She was not strong herself, and the whole
  affair probably so impressed her that it hastened her own death. That is all
  the story."</p>

  <p>"A piteous one," said Lucius Delaunay. "I can understand that it would
  irritate and sadden Laura, who bears the same name. I think,
  Theo&mdash;forgive me&mdash;but it is a curious thing, to name her Laura
  also. Your parents must have known that one day she, too, would come to
  Leppard Hall."</p>

  <p>"I have told you, I think, Lucius, that my grandfather, my father, uncle
  and myself have set our faces against all superstitions. We have very little
  connection with the main branch of the family." He paused and said, as if
  angry with himself, "I really don't know why I'm giving these explanations or
  why we're talking on this subject. It's all Laura's nonsense. The name was
  given her," he added, and it seemed to Mrs. Sylk as though he were trying to
  justify himself, "merely because we don't believe in any foolish ideas or
  ill-omens, or family curses, or any nonsense of that kind."</p>

  <p>"Why, no, of course not. And as you say, you have no very intimate
  connection with this other Laura Sarelle. But at the same time, one can
  understand on a sensitive girl&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sensitive girl!" interrupted the baronet. "Say rather an idle and
  capricious one. There have been other Laura Sarelles, you will see their
  names in the mausoleum."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know that that's very encouraging," smiled Lucius Delaunay,
  "for they must have all died young or unwed or they would have changed their
  names. Who," he added abruptly, "is the other portrait? It is a very fine
  picture. Not, I suppose, the sickly cousin who took the overdraught," he
  added with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Not that, certainly," replied Sir Theodosius. "We don't know. I think it
  has no connection with the family at all, for it has no likeness to any of
  the other portraits. It is probably that of some friend of the family,
  presented to them years ago."</p>

  <p>"It is strange that there should be no record of the name, no label on the
  frame."</p>

  <p>"Something has been written behind," replied the other young man, "but
  blacked out. It is impossible to decipher what is behind the frame." He
  shrugged his shoulders. "What does it matter?&mdash;it is a very fine
  painting, and I consider that it suits the room. Pray let us talk of
  something else."</p>

  <p>But the conversation was not so easily changed. Mrs. Sylk felt still a
  heavy mood, almost like an enchantment, over her. She wanted to leave the
  table, she wanted to go upstairs and see how Laura was, she felt uneasy about
  the girl, she wanted to stand between her and her brother, try to make him
  realize how dull life was for the young creature at Leppard Hall. She did not
  know how to set about this task. She hardly, indeed, seemed able to command
  her wits. She heard the two men talking and knew it was time for her to rise
  and leave them to their port; yet somehow she did not, as usual, go, but
  remained sitting at a table playing with a peach on her plate, stupid, at a
  loss for once, all her pretty social manners gone.</p>

  <p>It was Sir Theodosius who left the room first. He asked his steward to
  come to his cabinet and help him with his translation, over which he was
  taking pedantic care. Mr. Delaunay replied that he had more commercial
  labours to attend to. The accountant was coming over from Rugby on the morrow
  and the steward had to get his books in order. He excused himself pleasantly
  enough and Mrs. Sylk knew that the two men were very good friends and that
  the elder (Mr. Delaunay was that by two years) had some domination over the
  younger. But she thought that Sir Theodosius seemed ruffled, even angry, as
  he left the room.</p>

  <p>To her surprise, Mr. Delaunay rose and came and stood beside her chair,
  which was placed near the hearth. A wood fire was burning, though it was late
  in May, the evenings were chilly in the great hall. She was glad of the young
  man's company, glad to have him standing near her; there was something gay,
  gallant and pleasant about his presence. If she had had a son she would have
  wished him to be like Lucius Delaunay.</p>

  <p>She looked rather wistfully up at his face that combined the firm lines of
  manhood with the bloom of youth. He said, suddenly and, as she thought,
  wistfully:</p>

  <p>"I wish I could get those pictures moved for Laura, Mrs. Sylk. I'll try
  again, but you know what Sir Theo is, obstinate, and in so many small things
  that do not really matter."</p>

  <p>The spell was broken. Mrs. Sylk spoke more naturally than she had spoken
  for months.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Delaunay, do you really like Leppard Hall? Do you care about the life
  here? Isn't it in some way unnatural?"</p>

  <p>"I think it is unnatural for Laura," he replied, without looking at her.
  "I can quite see her point of view. She's a sensitive, high-mettled creature,
  and the place must be dull and melancholy. As for me, of course I've my work
  to do. I go abroad the countryside a good deal."</p>

  <p>"You're evading me," said Mrs. Sylk. She suddenly rose, her grey dress
  suddenly took on colour in the folds from the flames, for it was shot with
  blue and pink. "I mean, do you like the house? Laura, you know, detests it,
  so passionately, and speaks of it so openly that I am beginning to be
  affected too."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied quietly, still not looking at her but down at the
  flames, the glow of which flushed his face with gold, "one can be infected by
  other people's likes and terrors."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk seized upon the last word.</p>

  <p>"Terrors! Yes, that's it! Laura's terrified. You know these caprices and
  fancies that people will have, but these are not, what Sir Theo thinks,
  ordinary girlish nonsense. She's convinced that she's been here before, not
  in body but in spirit. And, of course, it is, from her point of view, an
  unpleasant coincidence that there should be that portrait of a woman of the
  same name who died young and so long ago, and, as I understand, in some
  trouble or scandal."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I can't understand that. They're hard people, the Sarelles. They
  shouldn't have used that name again. I don't know the story myself. One
  doesn't care either to question Sir Theo or to try to find out things behind
  his back. But perhaps it's a little worse than we realize."</p>

  <p>He lifted his vivid eyes and his handsome face was grave.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's all over and done with," said Mrs. Sylk nervously, "and
  shouldn't be remembered. But it's of the effect on Laura that I'm thinking.
  And why should she dislike the other portrait?&mdash;it's that of a very fine
  young man. He appears amiable too."</p>

  <p>"Does he?" Mr. Delaunay looked through the shadows at the portrait over
  which the candlelight flickered faintly. "I don't know. One can imagine
  almost anything into a portrait. The eyes will seem to follow one, the lips
  change, the expression, too. It's a matter of light and shade. One ought to
  be able to find out who he is, it's not so long ago."</p>

  <p>"Who he was, you mean," corrected Mrs. Sylk hastily. "Pray don't speak of
  him in the present tense."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're not afraid of ghosts, are you? I never heard of any hauntings
  in Leppard Hall."</p>

  <p>"Well, you've said quite a good deal to me," insisted Hetty Sylk, "but
  you've not answered my question. Do you like the place? Do you find life
  here, as Laura does, unpleasant, sinister?"</p>

  <p>"Do you?" asked Mr. Delaunay.</p>

  <p>They had spoken in lowered voices out of deference to the fact that they
  were in their employer's house. They would not be found, even discreetly,
  discussing him should he chance to return or should a servant suddenly
  enter.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Mrs. Sylk, "I'm too busy&mdash;well, I dare say you
  think I lead an idle life, but there's a great deal to do keeping that poor
  girl company."</p>

  <p>"Poor girl, you say! Is she really unhappy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, she's unhappy, Mr. Delaunay. She dislikes the place. You said the
  Sarelles are a hard race; well, Sir Theo's hard. He's the most extraordinary
  young man."</p>

  <p>"He considers himself," said Mr. Delaunay with a smile, "a stoic
  philosopher. He is very much concerned to despise all manner of superstition,
  as you heard him say just now. But he has many excellent qualities. I owe him
  a good deal, I admire him, but I have told him, as I tell you now, Mrs. Sylk,
  that I do not think he's a fit guardian for his sister."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mrs. Sylk rather wearily, "try to persuade him, if you have
  any influence over him at all, Mr. Delaunay, to allow us at least to go to
  London, or to Rugby or Warwick for a day or so now and then. We are never
  allowed the brougham, we are never permitted to take a railway journey.
  People have given up calling and it is, indeed, dull for the child."</p>

  <p>"When is she supposed to have her liberty&mdash;some measure of it at
  least?" asked the steward in a low tone.</p>

  <p>"When she is twenty-one, Sir Theo says, but that's two years more. She's
  been here two years already as it is, but to her it's like two centuries.
  Think what it means to look forward to another measure of time so long, so
  hideous."</p>

  <p>"I certainly wondered," said the steward, lifting his head again and
  looking round the room with narrowed eyes, "why she dislikes the place. And,
  for that matter, why you dislike it, and why I do."</p>

  <p>This was frank speech, and Mrs. Sylk acquiesced in it by her silence. She
  wished that Mr. Delaunay had not expressed the feeling she dared not voice
  herself. It was true, but a truth she would rather have kept hidden. How
  dreadful to have it admitted that they all disliked Leppard Hall!</p>

  <p>"Laura said this afternoon," she whispered with a little shudder, "it
  ought to have been all pulled down, destroyed years ago."</p>

  <p>"And so it should," said Mr. Delaunay, "and so it should. And the strange
  part of it is that I can't tell you why. It's no gloomier or more solitary
  than many another old house. My own home in Ireland, for instance, is far
  more isolated, and I suppose more sombre and melancholy too, but no one feels
  sad there. The landscape here, what could be more charming?&mdash;the
  pastures, the water-meadows. I don't know." He put his hand over his
  forehead. "Sometimes I think I must be a very fanciful fellow, yet I do
  practical work all day and sleep soundly at night and was never given, I
  think, to dreaming."</p>

  <p>"Why do you stay, Mr. Delaunay?" asked Mrs. Sylk cautiously and curiously.
  "Is it out of friendship for Sir Theo?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is," answered the steward slowly. "It's to my own interest,
  of course; I mustn't minimize that part of it. But I'm fairly experienced now
  and I dare say there's work I could get elsewhere if the same kind. I might
  get financial help from my relatives, though I've always been independent.
  But Theo in a way looks to me, leans on me. Such a solitary fellow, one is
  sorry for him."</p>

  <p>"It's a pity," said Mrs. Sylk, "that they have no relatives, none. That's
  what is unfortunate."</p>

  <p>"There is only yourself, and you are a very distant connection, I believe,
  Mrs. Sylk."</p>

  <p>"Very distant," said that lady. "She was happy with her aunt, Mary Tollis,
  you know, at Hampstead. They lived a very modest though genteel kind of life.
  I used to go and see them sometimes and Laura was like a bird, always moving
  and gay, in the company of some friend or doing some useful work in the
  neighbourhood. Why, you know, sir, that here she will not stir a step, yet in
  London she was always going abroad among her children and her old people,
  taking her singing lessons and trips up the river&mdash;why, anything that
  comes the way of a well-educated young girl." Mrs. Sylk finished rather
  lamely with a prim sentence as if she felt that she had been too loquacious
  to this young man to whom she had never spoken so freely before.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Delaunay seemed to understand perfectly. He would not answer, but
  said:</p>

  <p>"Theo wants me to come and live here, but I'm quite comfortable in the
  Dower House with the Pettigrews to look after me. I've got my own possessions
  there and I prefer the place."</p>

  <p>"I wish you <i>would</i> come here," urged Mrs. Sylk. "I think Laura would
  feel easier. You know that now I have to share her room at night, she'll not
  sleep alone."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing she need be afraid of," replied Delaunay, with a quick
  emphasis that was almost like a subdued violence. "There are at least ten
  menservants in the house and the place is well guarded by the dogs."</p>

  <p>"Why, who would think of anything of the kind," protested Mrs. Sylk in
  genuine astonishment; "I mean, about anyone breaking in, or burglars? Of
  course it's perfectly safe, and she in the middle of her own lands and her
  own tenantry. It's not that, it's just her dislike of the place. Don't you
  see, it's almost crystallizing into something tangible, as if she could put
  out her hand, as she says herself, and touch it."</p>

  <p>"A ghost, you mean?" asked the steward slowly.</p>

  <p>"It's not a ghost, just her own fancy. I'm stupid at expressing
  myself."</p>

  <p>"I understand. I don't see very much of Laura, but I think I understand
  her, too. I'll do what I can with Sir Theo to let her go to London."</p>

  <p>"And now I must go upstairs," said Mrs. Sylk, "I've left her alone too
  long." She was embarrassed, she had lost a little of her usual poise, she had
  dropped her usual smooth, meaningless, rather hypocritical manners and so
  became confused and wished to escape.</p>

  <p>The young man looked at her steadily and earnestly, and, she thought, with
  understanding and pity.</p>

  <p>"I'll do what I can," he said, "rely on me for that. My position is
  difficult, too."</p>

  <p>She murmured some agreement and left him standing by the hearth and
  looking up at the two portraits.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk found Laura Sarelle in bed but not asleep. Indeed, she had made
  Patty, the chambermaid, who had brought up her supper, keep her company.' The
  maid, pleased at this concession, was chattering about the doings, gossipings
  and customs of the servants' hall folk when Mrs. Sylk entered the room.
  Blushing and curtsying, the girl made her escape and Mrs. Sylk began to
  rebuke Laura.</p>

  <p>"That is what you must never do here. You should not encourage the
  servants to come up and talk to you. You always do it when I am away from
  you. You make me feel that I must be on duty night and day."</p>

  <p>To this Laura, tossing on her pillows, replied sullenly;</p>

  <p>"You were away a long time and I had to have somebody to talk to. I tell
  you I won't be left alone in this house, not for one single moment."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>It was a chilly month of damp winds, of low-flying loose clouds, of misty
  evenings and slowly opening flowers; even the white thorn blossoms came
  tardily that year and a deeper cloud of melancholy even than was usual seemed
  to settle over Leppard Hall.</p>

  <p>After a few days of acquiescence in her fate, Laura, who had been most
  dutiful and quiet, asked her brother in the presence of the steward and Mrs.
  Sylk if she might go for a day to town. She declared meekly that her wardrobe
  needed much replenishing, and Mrs. Sylk, although she had not been warned
  before of the news, ably seconded her, saying that the girl needed indeed,
  say, a visit to her dressmaker and to order some more materials for her
  summer gowns, adding quickly that there was nothing to be had in either Rugby
  or Warwick that was fit for Miss Laura Sarelle.</p>

  <p>With his usual reserve and yet exquisite good humour, Lucius Delaunay put
  in that he might escort the two ladies to town and look at the first editions
  offered at Messrs. Dawkins that Sir Theodosius desired him to value.</p>

  <p>The young baronet was, for him, in an amiable mood. He admitted that it
  was reasonable that Laura should now and then go to town, especially when so
  well escorted and chaperoned, and he was further inclined to agree with the
  request when Laura said quietly that Mrs. Spryce had asked her to spend the
  night at her quiet Highgate home.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk was slightly surprised that Laura should seem not only willing
  but even keen to accept this dull invitation. Mrs. Spryce was the wife of
  Nathaniel Spryce, the lawyer and trustee of Laura's father; the man, too, who
  had handled the very small fortune that poor Mary Tolls left behind, most of
  which had gone to Laura, but that was, after all, only a pittance.</p>

  <p>To so unexceptional a programme Sir Theodosius could offer no objection.
  He arranged that the little party should leave Rugby by a train early in the
  morning of the Monday and return on the Tuesday evening. He took occasion to
  tell Mrs. Sylk that he did not wish his sister to attend any conversaziones,
  parties, or concerts, considering her too young for such diversions.</p>

  <p>But Mrs. Sylk, with some hidden sarcasm, replied that there would be no
  fear of any such temptations in the house of Mrs. Spryce, she being a
  childless lady who led a most austere life.</p>

  <p>It was with an almost unaccountable rise in her spirits that Laura Sarelle
  left Leppard Hall for this short period of escape. She looked out of the
  brougham window back at the flat facade of the grey stone mansion, she looked
  at the sloping parkland, the grey willows, the grey-green alders and the
  slowly moving river.</p>

  <p>"How good to go away, even for so short a time!" she said, and she pressed
  Mrs. Sylk's hand nervously.</p>

  <p>Mr. Delaunay shared the carriage. He was in town attire and he looked
  quickly and curiously at the girl who had spoken with such deep and sincere
  passion. He made no comment on this, but pressed his lips together and then
  remarked lightly how strange it seemed to be travelling in a carriage after
  being for two years and more so constantly on horseback.</p>

  <p>With such commonplaces they passed the time until they arrived at Rugby
  station.</p>

  <p>There Laura Sarelle seemed to turn faint and had to lean on Mrs. Sylk's
  arm. She looked round eagerly, however, at the faces of the strangers about
  her, people bustling to and fro on their business. Even the darkness and the
  grime, the ugliness of the station, were to her refreshing and grateful after
  being shut so long in the place she detested.</p>

  <p>Mr. Delaunay found a first-class carriage and escorted the ladies into it.
  It was lined with red plush finished with yellow fringe and only slightly
  soiled by the constant smoke of the engine.</p>

  <p>Laura Sarelle sank at once into a corner, spreading her skirts about her.
  Despite her complaints as to the state of her wardrobe, she was handsomely
  dressed in a dark-and-light-blue-striped taffeta and a little velvet jacket
  of prune colour with a fringe of the same hue, and a hat with many ribbons
  floating at the back poised sideways on her smooth brow; her black curls,
  carefully arranged by the skilled fingers of Mrs. Sylk, hung down her back,
  her gloves and her reticule were on her knees. All these feminine
  appointments were rich and dainty. Her slender feet were crossed one over the
  other. She was a picture of luxury and idleness, but she sat there, still
  with a look of exhaustion, as if she were slightly faint, and her eyes were
  closed, her long lashes made dark semicircles on her cheeks.</p>

  <p>She was pale and had a frail air; she reminded Mrs. Sylk of a
  lily-of-the-valley; there was something graceful, refined&mdash;what, Mrs.
  Sylk thought rather foolishly, is sometimes termed "hothouse"&mdash;about
  her. Yet her air of vitality was impressive and astonishing.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk herself was well dressed, looking forward with pathetic and
  childish expectancy to the two days of relief from the monotony of Leppard
  Hall.</p>

  <p>Mr. Delaunay had brought a dispatch-case of papers with him and sat in his
  far corner appearing to be occupied with them, though very different thoughts
  from those that might have been inspired by the dry figures he contemplated
  were passing through his mind.</p>

  <p>Laura Sarelle was regarding him from beneath that handsome fringe of dark
  lashes. She loved him deeply with, she firmly believed, an enduring passion.
  It was the great object of her life to keep this concealed. Not only did she
  know that it would meet with the sternest, most horrified opposition from her
  brother, she believed that Mrs. Sylk would be shocked, and Lucius himself
  would be probably surprised and alarmed into leaving his employment at
  Leppard Hall. Therefore she employed all her native feminine duplicity in
  concealing the passion that was the mainspring of her life, for with it was
  bound her desire to escape from Leppard Hall, from all the plans of living
  that her brother had woven round her. It was her scarcely formulated design
  to escape from Leppard Hall and begin a new life somewhere else, in a
  different part of the world, as far away as possible from Warwickshire, with
  Lucius Delaunay.</p>

  <p>But she knew that to gain this end she would have to wait and be patient,
  subtle and strong. She hoped that she could call all these qualities to her
  aid; she did not yet understand the depths of her own character, but she
  believed she had considerable resources. Subterfuge came naturally to her,
  and young love can be most sharp and shrewd. She was quite sure that she had
  concealed from everyone that she had the least liking for Lucius
  Delaunay.</p>

  <p>She was better able to keep her secret as the steward was regarded by her
  brother, friend and equal by birth as he might be, as a dependant, part of
  the furniture and trappings of his household. The narrow pride of Sir
  Theodosius' cold nature did not allow him to suppose for a moment that Laura,
  for whom a brilliant match had been intended since she was in her cradle,
  would take any notice of the steward, who was so quiet, too, and reserved,
  and seemed so absorbed in his duties or in the classical studies that he
  shared with his employer.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk had not suspected it either. She had once or twice thought:
  'Well, there's a handsome young man and a pretty young girl. And the only
  handsome young man and only pretty young girl for miles around, as far as I
  can see, and as good as living under one roof.' Then she had decided that
  this very fact barred any romantic feeling between the two. Since she was
  seventeen Laura had been used to Lucius as if he had been a brother or a
  cousin with whom she had been brought up, and this familiarity, Mrs. Sylk
  supposed, had destroyed the possibility of any attachment between them. She
  knew that it was often so and that those who were in constant contact would
  take one another for granted, whereas any moment some chance meeting would
  set Laura's heart beating and send her head over heels in love.</p>

  <p>Laura contrived a perfectly natural manner towards Lucius, whom, on
  account of his long friendship with her brother&mdash;a college friendship at
  that&mdash;she addressed by his christian name, sometimes foolishly but
  prettily terming him Luce. She was able to refer to him without embarrassment
  or hesitation before the servants and before Mrs. Sylk. She was clever enough
  to despise him lightly before her brother, not overdoing this attitude but
  treating him as a rather ordinary, poor-spirited fellow who might have done
  better for himself than plod along at Leppard Hall.</p>

  <p>Now that she was shut up in the railway carriage with him and they were
  moving through space separated from the rest of the world she allowed her
  thoughts to flow out towards him with such intensity that it surprised her he
  did not raise his eyes and look at her. But no, he was intent upon his dull
  papers.</p>

  <p>She marked every detail of his person, his attire, his stock, his linen,
  the links at his wrist, the well-shaped hands, the curl of his hair over his
  ears, the outline of his features, the bloom of youth and health upon his
  cheeks, the deeply indented upper lip, the full line of the lower.</p>

  <p>She was able to assure herself with a certain tranquillity that she loved
  this man, and always would, and that somehow or other she would win him.</p>

  <p>'He does not love me now,' she thought, 'and if he were to suspect what I
  feel for him he would be alarmed and perhaps disgusted. I must never speak
  first, but somehow I shall bring him to care for me as much as I care for
  him, and we shall go away together and be happy.'</p>

  <p>Laura had tested her brother rather crudely the other day when she asked
  what he would say if she came to him with the suggestion of a marriage. Of
  course, he had rebuked her as she might have expected. He intended that she
  should marry to please him. She remembered that she had been trained for
  that, both when she had been at the boarding-school and when she had lived
  with Mary Tollis; that had always been the suggestion in the air, that she
  must lack no accomplishment, no grace, for as a Sarelle of Leppard Hall she
  would surely be able to command this brilliant marriage.</p>

  <p>What did people mean by a brilliant marriage?&mdash;wealth, a title? These
  material benefits did attract Laura, she was not indifferent to worldly
  glitter. She would have liked the money and position to take her away from
  her odious life. She would have liked to marry a nobleman who would take her
  to Court, the great cities of the world, and give her every luxury. Yet, even
  to her who so valued these things, they were as nothing beside the
  possibility of a union with Lucius Delaunay.</p>

  <p>"You still look faint, my dear," condoled Mrs. Sylk. "It is the motion and
  smell of this hideous train. How it rocks! And though we keep the window
  closed I swear one can hardly breathe for the stench and the soot."</p>

  <p>She offered a handkerchief drenched in eau-de-Cologne to Laura, who took
  it, smiling softly to herself. How little any of them understood her! It was
  true that she was faint, giddy&mdash;but it was with the pleasure of being
  shut up in the railway carriage with Lucius Delaunay.</p>

  <p>All kinds of daydreams and schemes went through her mind, that was both
  busy and fantastical, both fanciful and practical, as a woman's thoughts so
  often are. She could almost at the same time make some concrete and even
  sordid schemes and indulge in gold-tipped visions.</p>

  <p>She faced facts coolly. Sir Theodosius would never give his consent to her
  marriage with Lucius. Even to suggest such a union would mean that the young
  man, stung in his pride and for all she knew still indifferent to her, would
  throw up his position and go away, perhaps, to farm in Ireland, where she
  would never see him again. Therefore she must move carefully, slowly,
  cautiously.</p>

  <p>Laura believed that the best thing for her to do would be to move away
  from Leppard Hall herself and outside the influence of that place make her
  plans to catch Lucius. For she saw very little of him; often for days
  together he did not come to the Hall, or only came at hours when she could
  not see him. And in her walks abroad it was only by chance that she would
  meet him on his sorrel horse, "Pilgrim", going his rounds of the estate.</p>

  <p>No, her instinct told her to get away from her brother, from his
  household, and somehow push out into the world for herself, see what it was
  composed of&mdash;she had so little experience&mdash;and what chance there
  might be for herself and for Lucius.</p>

  <p>'It seems to me,' she thought, 'as if he were bewitched. Why should he
  stay there so long? He is a man, with everything before him.'</p>

  <p>And then her heart began to ache dreadfully with yearning. Why did he not
  feel for her what she felt for him? She wished she might tell him of these
  feelings so that they might plan and scheme together to outwit her odious
  brother.</p>

  <p>Mr. Delaunay suddenly raised his brilliant eyes and looked at her across
  the carriage.</p>

  <p>"Do you really feel the motion of the train, Miss Sarelle? You are sitting
  with your back to the engine, you know. Perhaps if you were to change places
  with me..."</p>

  <p>"I am very well," said Laura, smiling happily. "Indeed, I am so glad to be
  away from Leppard Hall that nothing would inconvenience me. And why," she
  asked, "do you call me Miss Sarelle? It's been Laura for a long time."</p>

  <p>She convinced herself that she spoke naturally, but a look that she could
  not quite interpret, but that she thought meant she had said something
  imprudent, crossed the young man's face as he replied lightly:</p>

  <p>"Oh, I thought it was a formal occasion. There is something about a
  railway journey that puts one on one's most ceremonious manners."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>When they arrived at the large, dreary, dirty London terminus Mr. Delaunay
  found and hired a hansom carriage for them and then took leave of them. Laura
  Sarelle's pleasure had been short after all. But he was to come to Highgate
  on the morrow and take them back to Leppard Hall.</p>

  <p>She did not say anything as she sat in the corner of the hired hackney in
  reply to Mrs. Sylk's comment that the Spryces might have sent a chaise for
  them, the hired vehicle was so dirty and jolted so much, almost as badly as
  the train.</p>

  <p>"I rather wonder, Laura," she added, "that you chose to accept this
  invitation. Surely there are other friends in London? Why, I thought of one
  or two myself who would have been glad to entertain you and for a longer time
  than one night."</p>

  <p>"Theo would not have allowed me to stay away longer than a night," replied
  Laura. "Besides, I wanted to see Mr. Spryce."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The lawyer lived in a handsome but gloomy house at Highgate that was well
  run by elderly servants. Mrs. Sylk found the atmosphere almost as depressing
  as Leppard Hall, and she was disappointed when the formal luncheon was over
  that the girl was not eager to go to town and begin to make her purchases.
  They had, indeed, an appointment with the dressmaker for early that
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>But Laura said surprisingly that Mrs. Sylk must go alone and choose the
  patterns and the materials.</p>

  <p>"It is a matter of indifference to me," she added, looking across at her
  host. "I want to speak to Mr. Spryce, now I have the occasion."</p>

  <p>And the lawyer, a stout affable man, but dull, and having the air of being
  out of touch with the world, had returned, too, to his mansion for luncheon
  on purpose to do honour to Laura Sarelle. He seemed astonished, and a little
  flattered, Mrs. Sylk thought, to hear Laura's request and asked her at once
  to step into his study, which was on the ground floor.</p>

  <p>"Business, my dear?" said Mrs. Spryce, a placid and insignificant person
  who seemed to take no interest in anything beyond the confines of her own
  well-run home.</p>

  <p>And Laura, holding her delicate head high with a sly little mile,
  said:</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think it is business. You know Mr. Spryce has some affairs of mine
  in hand."</p>

  <p>The library was even gloomier than the other apartments in the sombre
  house. It was in a way a replica of Mr. Spryce's office in Lincoln's Inn
  Fields. The walls were lined with dispatch-cases and books on dark shelves, a
  heavy desk stood in the window-place against a background of dark-red
  curtains.</p>

  <p>In London the spring had been chilly also and it was cold on these
  heights, therefore a coal-fire burnt in the polished steel grate.</p>

  <p>Laura seated herself near to this, shivering a little: the fire had not
  been long lit and the air of the room was musty.</p>

  <p>The old lawyer looked at her with a certain quickening of interest. How
  pretty, dainty and bright she was! He had always thought of her until now as
  a child, but there she was, a young woman, with her destiny before her, and
  perhaps her troubles too. Strange that she should want to speak to him on
  business and preferred an interview with a lawyer to a visit to a dressmaker.
  Strange that she should allow Mrs. Sylk to depart alone on what, surely,
  after a country life must be an exciting expedition.</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear," said he, taking what he believed to be the most correct
  as well as the most kindly tone, "I was the friend of your uncle and your
  father&mdash;I hope you'll regard me as your friend also."</p>

  <p>"I do, indeed, Mr. Spryce," returned Laura in her swift, eager way. "I
  want to ask you a few things about myself, about the estate."</p>

  <p>Mr. Spryce's manner almost imperceptibly hardened, became slightly legal
  as he answered cautiously:</p>

  <p>"Has not your brother, Sir Theodosius, told you all you wish to know about
  these matters?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Laura quickly. "He tells me nothing. He and I are not on the
  best of terms, Mr. Spryce. You may as well know it now as later. You know I
  don't wish to live at Leppard Hall. I don't like the place, I can't tell you
  why..."</p>

  <p>She checked herself, instinctively knowing that to go into anything
  fanciful in the presence of this man would be a mere waste of time. Besides,
  it was for practical purposes that she had asked for this interview.</p>

  <p>"I want to know," she said directly, "how my uncle's and my father's wills
  go."</p>

  <p>"If you mean which is the most important of the wills, it is your uncle's,
  who outlived your father by several years," said Mr. Spryce gravely. "Your
  father's property was in Jamaica, and sold, you may remember. The capital
  thus acquired went to swell the Sarelle fortune, all of which was left to Sir
  Theodosius."</p>

  <p>"All of it," said Laura swiftly. "Yes, I know. Nothing for me."</p>

  <p>Mr. Spryce raised and let fall a fat, pale hand.</p>

  <p>"There's no fear for you, my dear young lady," he replied with a certain
  professional pomposity. "Sir Theodosius is bound to maintain you according to
  your station so long as you remain unmarried, and to allow you&mdash;as I
  believe he does allow you&mdash;two hundred and fifty pounds a year for pin-
  or pocket-money, as the saying goes. And on your marriage he is to give you a
  dowry of a hundred thousand pounds. While, in the unlikely event of his death
  without heirs, you are to be the sole beneficiary of his estate."</p>

  <p>"A hundred thousand pounds," repeated Laura eagerly, as if this were the
  only point of the information that impressed her. "I did not know we had so
  much money."</p>

  <p>"There is a good deal of money in the Sarelle family," replied Mr. Spryce,
  smiling, "more perhaps than you would guess from the fashion in which your
  brother lives, though that is very handsome. I think he rather exaggerates
  the loss at which your father sold the Jamaica estate. Your mother was a
  well-dowered lady, too."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it usual for a woman's dowry to go to her daughter?" asked Laura.
  "Mrs. Sylk told me so, so did my aunt, Mary Tollis."</p>

  <p>"It may be usual, but it is not inevitable," said Mr. Spryce, "and in this
  case your mother, predeceasing your father, left him all her fortune, and
  that too goes to swell your brother's estate. Most of this money is safely
  invested in Consols. There are some plumbago mines in the north and the coal
  mines at Newcastle. You will recall that your branch the family came from
  Yorkshire. They were prudent people who made good investments."</p>

  <p>"Why, then, with all this money," exclaimed Laura patiently, "must we live
  at Leppard Hall?"</p>

  <p>"You must ask your brother that, my dear young lady. Everything is in his
  hands."</p>

  <p>"It is not fair," said Laura with sudden vehemence. "He is not much older
  than I, only six years, and is he thus to be entirely my master!" Then
  without pausing for breath she hurried on: "What happens if I marry without
  his consent?"</p>

  <p>"In that case he has the right to withhold your dowry, to cease to give
  you the maintenance that he is obliged to do while you remain single, and may
  content himself by paying you the two hundred and fifty pounds a year
  pin-money. But surely, Miss Sarelle, you knew all this before?"</p>

  <p>"Theodosius has told me something of the kind, but I wanted to know it
  from you, I wanted to be quite sure about it. You see, Theo thinks I'm a
  fool, or pretends to think so. He never discusses the matter with me. He puts
  it off; he says, 'When you're twenty-one it's time enough.'"</p>

  <p>"And so. I should think it would be," said Mr. Spryce in leisurely
  fashion. He could not understand and did not altogether approve of the girl's
  manifest impatience, which rather, to him, confirmed what he had heard of her
  during her childhood. Therefore as Laura still complained that her brother
  had thus been left guardian over her he added shrewdly:</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear Miss Laura, you see you had the reputation as a child and a
  girl of being wilful. You did not have your mother's care when you were very
  young, I think the school you were sent to was rather lax&mdash;the reports
  from it were not altogether satisfactory&mdash;while Mrs. Tollis tended to
  pamper you. Your father was what we call a long-headed, rather stern man.
  There, there, my dear, don't look at me with those big, frightened eyes. I'm
  not saying anything dreadful. I can see for myself that you're a very
  charming, modest, and docile young lady. I'm merely trying to explain to you
  why Sir Theo, who was always precocious, was given this charge."</p>

  <p>Laura paled during this long speech and sat staring at Mr. Spryce. Then
  she bit her lower lip and turned her head sideways, staring into the flames
  as if afraid what the lawyer might read in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing unusual in it, I assure you," said Mr. Spryce, leaning
  forward and patting her slender shoulder. "You really must not quarrel with
  your brother or think ill of him. He is a young man about whom nothing but
  good has been said, a really remarkable person, you know, my dear girl, who
  will probably be famous one of these days. He is a most extraordinary
  scholar&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What do I care about that?" interrupted Laura. "I'm not interested in his
  books, Greek and Latin, or in his studies in Persian and Hebrew. I'm not
  interested in Leppard Hall or the estate, I never wanted to live there."</p>

  <p>She checked herself again. She knew that it was useless to talk to Mr.
  Spryce in this strain.</p>

  <p>"I want to be free, I want to have my share of the money to do what I like
  with it."</p>

  <p>"My dear lady, it's quite impossible, it could not be even discussed until
  you were twenty-one years of age. Besides, what's the need?" added the good
  lawyer easily. "There's no reason to suppose that Sir Theodosius will object
  to any reasonable match that you wish to make."</p>

  <p>"I wish to make!" said Laura. "He will find a husband for me, and it will
  be that and none other that I must choose. How am I to endure it! Supposing I
  wish to marry a poor man?"</p>

  <p>"It would be very unfortunate," said Mr. Spryce. "I do not think that Sir
  Theodosius would agree. Family pride is very strong in him. No doubt it is in
  yourself."</p>

  <p>Laura controlled the hot speech that rose to her lips. 'There's no use,'
  she thought, 'of making an enemy of this man, who might yet be of some
  service to me.'</p>

  <p>With a self-control that he admired and that showed him the sister shared
  something of the notable qualities of the brother, she replied after a brief
  pause:</p>

  <p>"Very well, we will speak of it again in two years' time when I am
  twenty-one. Perhaps I shall be different then, perhaps Theo will have
  softened towards me."</p>

  <p>"Softened towards you, Miss Laura! You have, I hope, nothing to complain
  of, no harshness, no severity?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, none, none at all!" said Laura with a smile, rising swiftly and
  resting her elbow on the mantelpiece. "Why, indeed, I have everything, every
  luxury, a maid, a companion, horses, a carriage, a life of idleness..."</p>

  <p>She paused a moment, while the lawyer looked at her out of narrowed eyes,
  and then added:</p>

  <p>"But I cannot get as much as two portraits removed from the dining-room
  wall if I wish."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," said Mr. Spryce, a little coldly. "It is a great
  pity that you quarrel with your brother. There are only the two of you left
  in the world, you are the last of the cadet branch of the Sarelle
  family."</p>

  <p>"And to whom will all this money go after we are dead?" asked Laura.</p>

  <p>"That is your brother's affair, to leave it to whom he wishes. But why
  suppose that the Sarelle family will be extinct with you? No doubt Sir
  Theodosius will marry."</p>

  <p>"I don't think it's likely. I don't believe you do yourself, Mr.
  Spryce."</p>

  <p>"Well, it may be that he is the type of the scholarly recluse, prefers a
  bachelor existence," replied the lawyer easily. "In that case you will be a
  very fortunate lady, Miss Laura, for to you and your husband and children
  will devolve all the Sarelle estates in due course. Now why," he added with a
  heavy attempt at humour, "confuse your pretty head about these dull affairs?
  Why not go and enjoy yourself choosing dresses and laces and fal-lals? You
  say that life is gloomy at Leppard Hall; well, here is a chance for a
  diversion. You might even go to a concert."</p>

  <p>"I want no diversions of any kind," replied Laura, looking full at the
  lawyer. "I want to know what my life means, how I stand. I realize now that I
  am entirely in my brother's power. There is only that two hundred and fifty
  pounds a year that he can never take from me. Well, I suppose there is no
  means of altering this will, no appeal from it? Sir Thomas Wakeley could do
  nothing?" She mentioned the man who had been her guardian until her brother
  came of age.</p>

  <p>The lawyer assured her that Sir Thomas had now nothing whatever to do with
  the matter, for since Sir Theodosius attained his majority he was his own
  master.</p>

  <p>"And mine," added Laura.</p>

  <p>She stood silent for a moment, trembling. The lawyer looked at her with a
  sharp curiosity under his natural placidity and professional dryness.</p>

  <p>He remembered his late client, the Jamaican merchant, and the elder
  brother, Sir John of Leppard Hall, how they had spoken of the girl whom they
  had watched, tenderly and keenly, though she never knew much of that, both
  when she was at school and when she had lived with Mary Tolls. They had been
  rather afraid of her character, that was full, they declared, of vagaries,
  fancies, and sudden caprices and staunch and constant passions. In everything
  she had been a contrast to that model of self-control and rectitude, Sir
  Theodosius, who had passed through school and college amid a chorus of
  commendation, winning scholarships and prizes as easily as other youths
  picked apples off trees.</p>

  <p>Laura Sarelle is wild, Laura Sarelle is difficult, Laura Sarelle requires
  watching! Mr. Spryce remembered all these warnings and he was glad that the
  girl's fortune was carefully tied up.</p>

  <p>'She's the type,' he thought, looking at her beauty, which even to his
  dull, unappreciative eyes was fresh as a rose-leaf blown into his dreary
  room, 'to fall into the hands of some adventurer, romantic, impulsive. It's a
  good thing that Sir Theodosius has got such a level head and his hands on the
  money.'</p>

  <p>He was rather afraid that Laura might make some kind of a scene, pleading
  with him to use his influence with her brother to enable her to escape from
  Leppard Hall. Instead, she changed the subject entirely with bewildering
  swiftness and asked him:</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me something of the history of my ancestors? I want
  particularly to know about Laura Sarelle. It was her portrait I wished to
  have moved. It hangs in the dining-room; she's holding a bough of
  laurel."</p>

  <p>The lawyer's face remained impassive. Laura thought that it had a locked
  look, but perhaps that was her fancy.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the laurel! Why, that would be a play upon her name. They were fond
  of those conceits, were they not, in those days? You know, of course, my
  dear, what your name means&mdash;the breeze in the bushes, L'aura," he
  continued fatuously, "a pun used by Petrarch in his sonnet to his Laura."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," replied the girl indifferently. "The sound of the wind in
  the bushes makes my name&mdash;the laurel bushes. There is a large one
  beneath my window."</p>

  <p>"Well, she was a very pretty young woman, I believe," continued the lawyer
  with, forced geniality. "I don't know very much about her, do you?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Laura, frowning. "She died young. I've seen a tablet to her in
  the church, of course. She's buried in the church, not in the mausoleum with
  the others. There's only her name and the date, and two sprigs of laurel.
  That's unusual, isn't it? Not even a line of Scripture, no epitaph. In those
  days they had such long Latin epitaphs."</p>

  <p>The lawyer sat silent, she sensed that he was watchful, on the alert, and
  could not understand why. Was something being concealed from her?</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything else about her?" she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady, you must remember I have the affairs of a great many
  families besides yours to attend to, and I can't remember all the details of
  all their histories."</p>

  <p>"But our business must be very important," remarked Laura shrewdly. "As
  you say yourself, Mr. Spryce, a great deal of money was handled by your firm
  for us, and it was rather unusual that the main branch should die out with a
  young unmarried woman and for the cadet branch from another county to
  inherit. All these things, I should have thought, would have fixed the
  details in someone's mind, yet no one seems to remember. I have seen," she
  added irrelevantly, "her funeral hatchment in the church, lozenge-shaped, you
  know." Then, seeing that he was not to be drawn, she put her own cards on the
  table. "There was some question of an overdose of a sleeping-draught, an
  inquest, some scandal."</p>

  <p>"I believe there was," said Mr. Spryce smoothly. "It was nothing of any
  consequence. Laura Sarelle died suddenly."</p>

  <p>"How?" asked the girl. "She was very young. Not more, I think, than two-
  or three-and-twenty."</p>

  <p>"I think from a fever, a low fever. They were prevalent then, you know, in
  the marshes."</p>

  <p>Laura said quickly:</p>

  <p>"My brother said from a consumption in the lungs."</p>

  <p>"Well," agreed Mr. Spryce, "so it was, a consumption in the lungs, I had
  forgotten."</p>

  <p>"Do you know who it was died of the overdose?" asked the girl again, still
  keenly.</p>

  <p>"My dear child, I'm afraid I don't. As I told you, all these are family
  details. A friend, I think, staying in the house."</p>

  <p>"Do you know who was the original of that other portrait? You remember it,
  you must have seen it when you've come to Leppard Hall, hanging there in the
  dining-room."</p>

  <p>"I don't recall it. I have no knowledge of art."</p>

  <p>Laura turned on him impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, sir, you are trying to deceive and confuse me. You must recall
  it, it is a very handsome painting. It is supposed to be by the great
  Gainsborough. A young man in a blue coat that he holds up on his hip, thus,"
  she thrust her own small hand in her waist and let the folds of her velvet
  jacket fall over it.</p>

  <p>Mr. Spryce's professional calm was a little ruffled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed, I recall it now," he allowed himself to be forced into
  saying. "No, I don't know who it is. A handsome and a pleasant face, as I
  thought. I suppose," and Laura thought he had the air of a man feeling his
  way, "it would be some distant relation, or perhaps merely a friend."</p>

  <p>"Then why is it hanging there, nameless, menacing, staring down at me when
  I have my meals? And why won't Sir Theodosius move it?"</p>

  <p>"My dear girl, you shouldn't allow these fancies to run away with you. Sir
  Theodosius is quite right in refusing to give in to your whims."</p>

  <p>Checked by this, Laura withdrew into her usual reserve. Nothing more was
  to be gained from this man on this subject. She tried another, though with a
  more indifferent air.</p>

  <p>"You think I am fanciful. Is it my fancy that we are rather avoided in the
  neighbourhood? I know the house is very isolated, but there are people living
  not so far away who might call. They did, as a matter of duty, once or twice,
  but they don't come again. And when I go among them there seems an air of
  reserve. And yet you say yourself I'm a great heiress, greater than I knew.
  I'm not ill-looking, not boorish, I have had a town education."</p>

  <p>"My dear girl, you must certainly not allow these ideas to get into your
  head," said the lawyer with feeling. "Of course you are not avoided. If
  people do not come often to Leppard Hall it's because Sir Theodosius does not
  encourage them. I can see that that, perhaps, is wrong. You should have more
  company of your own age. I shall speak to Sir Theodosius and see if it cannot
  be arranged for you to come to London to stay with a friend, or he might even
  take a town house for you."</p>

  <p>"You don't know him!" Laura laughed shortly. "He would not permit anything
  of the kind. But that's not the point that I'm trying to bring before you
  now, sir. I'm saying that we seem isolated there, as if people avoided us, as
  if the house wasn't liked. Do you like the house yourself?" she asked
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>"It always seemed to me a very handsome mansion," replied the lawyer.</p>

  <p>But Laura laughed in his face.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you're so very clever after all, Mr. Spryce. I don't mean
  that discourteously. But you can't conceal from me that you <i>do</i> hate
  the place, that you <i>do</i> think there's something strange about it. I
  ought never to have been taken there."</p>

  <p>Mr. Spryce was silent for a moment&mdash;seemed, she thought, moved,
  disturbed, perhaps to a considerable degree, though he tried hard to preserve
  his usual equanimity. It was quite a while before he seemed to have made up
  his mind what to say, and the girl waited patiently. When Mr. Spryce spoke it
  was in impressive accents.</p>

  <p>"I warmly recommend you, Miss Laura, to pay no attention to stories,
  gossip, or superstition. You were given the name you bear by your father
  because it is a name that has always been honoured in your family. You will
  see it on many of the tablets in the mausoleum."</p>

  <p>"Yes, on graves," said Laura quickly, "in the mausoleum, women of my
  family who died unmarried."</p>

  <p>Mr. Spryce waved this aside.</p>

  <p>"If you ever do hear any tales or gossip, and there's no old family
  without them, you must disregard them all. You must understand it was your
  father's wish that you and your brother should live at Leppard Hall and live
  down, as it were, and disperse any"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"any rumours or
  unpleasant tales, shall we say, that may have gathered round the mansion that
  has stood empty so long."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you're talking about. I never said anything about
  unpleasant tales or rumours. I haven't heard anything about a ghost. I asked
  you about a portrait, about my namesake, and why it was that the neighbours
  seemed to stay away willingly from Leppard Hall."</p>

  <p>But she could get nothing more out of Mr. Spryce except:</p>

  <p>"It is really all fancy, my dear young lady. I think this lonely country
  life is not good for your nervousness. I shall write to Sir Theodosius about
  it."</p>

  <p>"It will do no good," said Laura, with a curling of the lip.</p>

  <p>She had no more to say, she was suddenly silent as she had suddenly been
  talkative. She went to the grim bedroom that Mrs. Spryce had prepared for
  her, where everything was heavy, clean and old-fashioned.</p>

  <p>And when Mrs. Sylk returned, flushed with the pleasure of her expedition
  among the shops, Laura was lying on the bed, her head pressed into the
  pillow, her hands clasped behind her dark curls.</p>

  <p>As Mrs. Sylk entered, the girl said, with an air of triumph and in a low
  voice:</p>

  <p>"They are concealing something from me, Mrs. Sylk. We must find out what
  it is, you and I."</p>

  <p>She said no more on this subject, but her words alarmed Mrs. Sylk
  considerably. She took it upon herself to give the girl a sleeping-draught
  that she always carried with her in case of necessity. These tablets had been
  prescribed for Laura some months ago when she had had a sharp attack of
  illness at Leppard Hall followed by insomnia. Dr. Selby of Warwick had given
  these pills in charge of Mrs. Sylk, telling her not to use them until they
  were absolutely needed.</p>

  <p>She gave them to Laura now in a glass of milk, but did not say she had
  mixed them with the drink because a sleeping-draught was one of the
  ingredients of Laura's fanciful tale, the overdose of a sleeping-draught
  given by her namesake to some young cousin.</p>

  <p>'Dear me, sixty or seventy years ago, what does it matter now,' thought
  poor Mrs. Sylk, whose little pleasure had been spoiled by Laura's difficult
  mood.</p>

  <p>She went to her own room when the girl was finally in her unnatural sleep,
  much depressed, dreading the return to Leppard Hall, and wishing she could
  find another employment.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>On the return journey to Rugby Laura was very talkative in a fashion that
  startled and rather shocked Mrs. Sylk. The girl seemed anxious to tell her
  own affairs to Mr. Delaunay, who, Mrs. Sylk considered, was hardly, although
  an old friend of the family, a fit recipient for the girl's confidence.
  Indeed, the anxious lady pondered, was Lucius Delaunay an old friend of the
  family? Nay, he was but a college friend of Sir Theodosius, and though she
  thought it was quite proper that Laura should be friendly and even familiar
  with him, she did not understand why the girl was leaning forward in this
  excited way from her corner in the carriage reciting her conversation with
  Mr. Spryce.</p>

  <p>But Laura had been strange during the whole of the London visit; even when
  Mrs. Sylk had at last succeeded in getting her to the dressmaker's and the
  large shops where she had chosen patterns and materials and been fitted with
  muslins and silk gowns for summer wear she had seemed indifferent to her
  surroundings, she who was usually so attracted by all manner of finery, and
  had talked vaguely of the future, and yet with what Mrs. Sylk called to
  herself a hectic look and accent, as if she were slightly touched with
  fever.</p>

  <p>Was it possible, Mrs. Sylk wondered anxiously, that the girl was going to
  have one of her difficult fits or attacks and that when she reached Leppard
  Hall she would at once have to be put to bed while Dr. Selby would have to be
  fetched from Warwick?</p>

  <p>But now Laura seemed in good enough health. It was her mind and her spirit
  only that were affected. She told Lucius Delaunay, in what affected to be a
  light tone, how she had been rebuked by Mr. Spryce.</p>

  <p>"There is no hope for me, Lucius, none at all. I am to remain at Leppard
  Hall until I am one-and-twenty. And even then&mdash;why, I am entirely in the
  power of Theodosius. Did you know that?"</p>

  <p>Forced to answer this abrupt and almost imperative question, the young man
  replied, with his usual serene good-nature:</p>

  <p>"Miss Laura, I have never discussed your affairs with Theo. Why should I?
  I suppose it is quite a natural thing for him to be your guardian."</p>

  <p>"Do you think it natural, Lucius? I am entirely in his power. If I disobey
  him, if, for instance, I marry somebody of whom he does not approve, I am to
  have but the two hundred and fifty a year that is now my pocket-money."</p>

  <p>Mr. Delaunay evaded a direct answer to this complaint. He remarked that
  two hundred and fifty pounds a year was handsome pocket money for any young
  lady.</p>

  <p>"But I don't get it," said Laura, frankly. "Theodosius keeps it to pay for
  my clothes. That will make you think," she added quickly, "that I must be
  very well dressed, too well dressed for Leppard Hall. But there are other
  expenses that are taken out of it also," she added, with sudden reticence,
  for she did not, in front of Mrs. Sylk, want to say that her chaperon's
  salary was paid out of her allowance.</p>

  <p>What she did say was:</p>

  <p>"My brother is extremely mean, Lucius; have you noticed that? He lives
  magnificently, but is very close with every halfpenny that is spent."</p>

  <p>"That is more good management than meanness," parried Mr. Delaunay.</p>

  <p>He looked out of the window at the landscape that was streaming past in
  lines of grey, green and blue, slightly fretted by this feminine, querulous
  complaint.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk felt uneasy, she did not know how to turn the conversation or
  how to check Laura. She felt that the whole thing was very improper. So she
  put in, rather feebly:</p>

  <p>"I don't think Sir Theodosius will be pleased that you spoke so intimately
  to Mr. Spryce. He probably intended to tell you all these matters when you
  were twenty-one years of age, my dear."</p>

  <p>"I had every right to know," replied Laura in a brooding tone, "and I am
  glad I do know. But think, Lucius, two more years of imprisonment!"</p>

  <p>"I think you talk extravagantly, Miss Laura," said the young man with an
  effort, turning in his place; "you can hardly call a residence in your
  brother's Hall imprisonment."</p>

  <p>"It is to me. My spirit's imprisoned. Don't you understand, or do you,
  too, think that I am fanciful, perhaps half-witted? But I'm sure you don't,
  Lucius. I am sure you understand really but you won't commit yourself." Then
  going off again at random, as was her custom when excited, she asked: "Could
  you ask Theodosius about those portraits? Perhaps for you he will have them
  moved."</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I have no influence with Theo, Laura," replied Mr. Delaunay with
  a faint smile. "Though I am fond of him, of course, and I think he's fond of
  me."</p>

  <p>"He values your services," remarked Laura shrewdly. "He knows that he
  wouldn't get anyone else very easily to undertake your double duties of
  secretary and steward. But you are a man and you have, I suppose, some sort
  of character. Can't you persuade him to take those two pictures away?"</p>

  <p>"I'll ask him, Miss Laura."</p>

  <p>"Well, pray do, for my sake. And there's another thing that you might do
  for me. You might find out the history of that woman, Laura Sarelle."</p>

  <p>This direct appeal was too much for Mrs. Sylk's sense of decorum. She put
  her grey-gloved hand on Laura's arm and said:</p>

  <p>"My dear, you should not make those direct appeals. You put a gentleman in
  a most embarrassing position when a lady thus openly asks a favour."</p>

  <p>Laura laughed. She, too, looked out of the window, turning away from
  Lucius Delaunay. How foolish they all were, even her beloved; he was stupid,
  or reserved, to a maddening degree. How was it possible they could not read
  her, that they could not understand she wanted her freedom and her money that
  she might go away with him far from this hateful countryside, far from the
  loathsome house? She changed her tactics once again after a pause, during
  which all three sat in uncomfortable silence, and looking around said:</p>

  <p>"No doubt you think I am very indiscreet. You feel it is the duty of women
  to suffer in silence. That is what we are bred and trained for, is it not,
  Mrs. Sylk? But I thought I had a right at least to know about my destiny. It
  is strange to think, is it not, how one's parents can dispose of one, of
  one's whole life, just by writing directions down on a scroll of paper? You
  see, I have discovered Theo is richer than we thought he was. There was a
  good deal of money made from the sale of that Jamaica estate, though Theo
  always told me that we had heavy losses there.</p>

  <p>"There was my mother's dowry, too, that should have been reserved for me.
  But no, I am to have nothing. And all because while I was a schoolgirl I was
  supposed to be wild and fanciful."</p>

  <p>At the end of this long speech she moved with the rustle of her stiff
  puce-coloured silk skirt and seated herself opposite Mr. Delaunay in the
  further corner of the carriage.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think it's unfair? I appeal direct to you, whether Mrs. Sylk
  thinks it decorous or not."</p>

  <p>He looked at her with a smile both in his eyes and on his lips. She was
  very finely dressed for her position. It was a strange caprice of the
  otherwise stern and straightforward Sir Theodosius that he liked to surround
  himself with so much splendour, and that Laura, who was denied even the most
  common diversions of her age, was always expected to go most richly dressed.
  She wore now a hat with dark purple feathers and a little jacket of dark
  green velvet laced with golden ribbons, a dress that was not only magnificent
  but had its touch of fantasy even as the girl who wore it. Indeed, Laura
  Sarelle could not put anything on without twisting or turning it to suit her
  own individuality.</p>

  <p>"I'll speak to Theo, Laura," was all he said, but in his mind he was
  revolving several problems, coming abruptly to a decision about the future
  that he had long debated with himself.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Being a young man of tolerable determination and having that strength
  which those of a solitary and reserved character often possess in secret,
  Lucius Delaunay put this resolve into practice soon after the journey from
  London, and coming upon Sir Theodosius one evening in his library, where the
  baronet had called him to help him with a difficult passage in his Greek
  translation, he said:</p>

  <p>"Theo, I am resolved to leave Leppard Hall. Not so soon as to
  inconvenience you, but as soon as may be."</p>

  <p>He spoke pleasantly, almost affectionately, and put his fine hand on the
  thin shoulder of the friend whom he addressed. But Sir Theodosius turned on
  him a look that was not only startled but full of anger and even, the other
  young man thought, of hatred.</p>

  <p>"You would leave me! But you have never hinted at such a thing! Lucius, it
  is impossible!"</p>

  <p>The words were harshly and even tyrannically spoken, but the other
  answered mildly:</p>

  <p>"We never had more than a business agreement, did we, Theo? I am of no
  more use to you here than any other would be. Indeed, the work should be
  divided, you should have a secretary and a steward."</p>

  <p>"I am quite satisfied," replied Sir Theodosius, with a touch of violence.
  "I have arranged my time very pleasantly to myself. You look after the estate
  excellently, with my supervision," he added haughtily. "I have the kind of
  life that I most desire. Such time as you can give to our studies here is
  sufficient for me."</p>

  <p>"I don't think that I shall be able to give so much time in future,"
  replied the other, still gently but firmly and with his clear bright eyes
  slightly narrowed as he gazed at his friend. "When we were at college
  together I was able to be of some help to you. We had the same tastes and I
  suppose that made us friends, but there is a good deal that we have not got
  in common, Theo."</p>

  <p>"Why are you bringing all this up now?" replied the baronet, who seemed
  much moved.</p>

  <p>He rose from the smoothly padded leather chair after making an angry
  gesture with his hands, which pushed the manuscripts on his desk aside.</p>

  <p>"You know that I am deeply engaged in this work. It will be another year
  before I've finished it. Cannot you," he added eagerly and impulsively,
  "remain until then?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think I can, Theo. A relative of mine has offered me work in
  Ireland. Not so well paid as this, nor, I dare say, so interesting, but I
  think I should go."</p>

  <p>"Why?" demanded Sir Theodosius. "I never thought that you were a
  capricious man, Lucius. I insist on a good reason for this sudden, this
  unaccountable resolution."</p>

  <p>"It is not sudden. I have been debating it for some time. The days slip by
  very easily in a place like this. I have been here as long as you
  have&mdash;two years. During that time I have accomplished nothing&mdash;in
  the forwarding of my own life, I mean. You are too inclined to be solitary;
  this is rather an unnatural sort of existence."</p>

  <p>"You mean it's dull?" asked the baronet; then answered himself
  immediately: "It will be more dull in Ireland."</p>

  <p>"I don't know. My relative's estate is near Dublin. I have many friends
  there. I might not stay there long, either. I told you, if you remember,
  Theodosius, when I came first to Leppard Hall that I accepted the appointment
  only while I was considering what the future would be. You see," he added
  with a pleasant smile, "our positions were much the same, save that you had
  inherited a large fortune. We were both cadets of noble houses, we were both
  orphans. I felt drawn to you, and you, I think, to me."</p>

  <p>"Well, what has come between us?" demanded Sir Theodosius. "Have I ever
  expressed displeasure? Do you wish your salary raised? I thought it was
  sufficient for your expenses. You live here more as my friend than my
  steward."</p>

  <p>A faint colour touched the other young man's face:</p>

  <p>"I have complained about nothing," he said. "What I do is on my own
  initiative. I shall leave in a month's time, I think. Nothing you say or do,
  Theo, will alter my resolution. I believe that I have been here too
  long."</p>

  <p>Theodosius paced up and down the room; he was obviously exasperated,
  baffled and angry. Lucius Delaunay was sorry for him, but not moved to alter
  his determination. At last Sir Theodosius said:</p>

  <p>"You've not been infected by any of this nonsense that Laura talks, about
  disliking the place? The girl's hysterical; what she says is enough to
  unnerve anyone. I think Mrs. Sylk encourages her too. I have spoken most
  sternly to the servants. This kind of feminine excitement spreads like
  wildfire."</p>

  <p>"I have seen very little of either Miss Laura or Mrs. Sylk," replied the
  young steward with a tranquil look, "nor are they likely to affect me. But
  since you have brought up your sister's name, I shall venture to give you
  some advice, though I am quite sure it will be taken ill."</p>

  <p>"Then why give it?" demanded the baronet sternly.</p>

  <p>"Because sometimes even though advice is resented it lingers in the mind.
  Sometimes even the most obstinate will be impressed, and I want to impress
  you with the fact that it is not fair to keep Laura here. You may call her
  hysterical, excitable, fantastic, what you will, but remember that this girl
  is entirely in your power and that it may have a very ill effect on her to
  remain in a place she detests."</p>

  <p>"She would detest any place," replied Sir Theodosius grimly, "where she
  was not allowed to have her own will. She is incurably frivolous, she wishes
  for nothing but excitement and pleasure."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's natural enough," put in Lucius Delaunay. "Give her a little
  of it and she will cease to yearn so much after it. Let her stay in London;
  you must have friends, even connections, there."</p>

  <p>"I think it's presumptuous in you to give me this advice," interrupted the
  baronet, "especially after you have told me in such an unkind manner that you
  are leaving me. I know how to deal with Laura."</p>

  <p>"I do not think you do," replied Lucius coolly. "I think that you are
  laying up trouble for yourself there. As I told you, I have seen very little
  of the girl, and I am certainly not in her confidence, but I'm older than
  you, Theo, and have had more experience, and I do warn you that you should
  get other advice than mine about her. Whenever Dr. Selby comes to see you he
  advises you that she should have a change."</p>

  <p>"And I say," replied Sir Theodosius violently, pausing by the handsome
  desk, "that she shall remain here, in my house, the house of my fathers, in
  her rightful place."</p>

  <p>"Close to the graves of the other women who bear her name," said Lucius,
  his eyes still further narrowed, "constantly near that portrait which she so
  much dislikes? There's one thing I should like to ask you also, Theo: there's
  some mystery about that other Laura Sarelle. You make it worse by trying to
  keep it secret."</p>

  <p>"Have you been trying to find out about it?" demanded the baronet, whose
  face now had an ugly, livid tinge.</p>

  <p>"You know me better than that. Your intention is to insult, provoke me,
  not to discover the truth," replied Lucius Delaunay, still coolly. "I have
  made no inquiries about your family or the history of Leppard Hall in the
  neighbourhood. I think, too, Theo, that you hold your tenants down with so
  stern a hand that they would all be dumb if anyone did question them. But I
  think there was, or is, some mystery about that girl, and I think it's cruel
  to bring Laura, her namesake, here, to live, as it were, in the shadow of it.
  And though you cannot accuse me of being a fanciful, sick-tempered girl, I
  too think that the Hall is&mdash;well, gloomy. And sometimes, when I hear
  Miss Laura say that it ought to be destroyed, I am inclined to echo her
  opinion."</p>

  <p>Sir Theodosius seemed violently struck by these words. He sat down in the
  chair, put his elbow on the table and dropped his face in his hands. But
  there was no sign of relenting in his pose or his face. He mumbled to himself
  and the words seemed vindictive.</p>

  <p>The steward was somewhat surprised at this emotion on the part of his
  employer. He knew that what he had said himself was reasonable, and Sir
  Theodosius had always been towards him, if neither affectionate nor kind, at
  least equable and just. He therefore approached him and said with a note of
  regret:</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to have vexed you, indeed I am. You'll easily find someone
  else to take my place. If you don't like my advice about Laura, well, forget
  it. It will be given you before long by someone else. It is true that the
  girl may grow out of her fancies&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The sentence was broken off, for the door was opened abruptly and for a
  second both men, for Sir Theodosius had raised his head quickly at the
  interruption, thought that they beheld a ghost. For a tall, pale young woman
  stood in the doorway dressed in a gown of rubbed primrose silk with the
  palest of blue ribbons at the bosom, her hair powdered, her dark eyes shining
  with excitement and in her hand a spray of dark laurel.</p>

  <p>She was the exact likeness of the portrait in the dining-room, save that
  the faint tint of the oil-painting here glowed with life in the warm though
  pale colourings of the girl, and the costume was bright and real in the stiff
  sparkle of the silk, in the glint of the bows of cracked ribbon.</p>

  <p>"Laura!" cried Sir Theodosius at length. He set his lips and seemed unable
  to rise from the chair.</p>

  <p>Lucius Delaunay had been startled too; though not a superstitious man, he
  had for more than a second believed that he saw a supernatural vision.</p>

  <p>"Why, Laura, dressed up like the portrait! What a strange masquerade!" he
  remarked slowly, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I found the dress in the attic," smiled Laura, coming softly into the
  room and closing the door. "It fits me to perfection. She must have been like
  me after all. You see, I have powdered my hair, that is what she has on in
  the picture&mdash;powder&mdash;her hair, I expect, was as dark as mine, don't
  you see? It took me a long time to put it on. Mrs. Sylk found some old
  pomade, and then some fine sifted flour."</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't have done this," exclaimed Sir Theodosius violently,
  rising. "What prank will you be up to next, Laura! You pretend to dislike the
  portrait, and then you dress yourself up in a likeness of it. Where did you
  find those clothes?"</p>

  <p>"I told you, in the great bedchamber." Laura moved across the study floor,
  and the full dress that was arranged on hoops billowed about her. "There are
  several others there, too. And old writings, but they're so faded and cramped
  I can't decipher them. All manner of things in a haircord trunk."</p>

  <p>"You had no business to be in that room," cried Sir Theodosius. "Who gave
  you the key?"</p>

  <p>"I shan't tell you. I suppose I am the mistress of the house if there is
  one, and I shall get the keys if I wish. What harm is there in it? See, I
  picked this spray of laurel. That symbolizes my name and hers, doesn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>Seeing that Theodosius was still not master of himself, Lucius Delaunay
  easily took the situation in hand.</p>

  <p>"Well, Laura," he said, "now that you have found that charming gown and
  made yourself such a beautiful replica of the picture you will cease,
  perhaps, to dislike it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think I shall," smiled the girl. "I think I'm glad that, after
  all, I didn't have it taken away. There are other things of hers up there
  too, and I dare say that after a while I shall feel that I am in the past
  again and that I am the other Laura Sarelle. But I hope that I shan't die
  when she did, for that means that I should have no more than five years or so
  to live."</p>

  <p>Theodosius, who seemed to have gathered his strength and courage but with
  difficulty, as if he had received a great shock, now rose and addressed his
  sister in the sternest tones:</p>

  <p>"Laura, you will go upstairs immediately and you will take off all that
  mummery. You will bid one of the maids take it upstairs and lock it away in
  the trunks. You will return the keys, if they are still in your possession,
  to the housekeeper. You will never go in for this kind of masquerade again,
  you will never indulge your foolishness so wantonly again. It is the present
  and the future that you have to live in, not the past."</p>

  <p>Laura seemed intimidated by her brother's harshness. She shrank away with
  a movement that brought her nearer to the side of Lucius Delaunay.</p>

  <p>"You never will allow that anything I do is right, will you!" she
  protested, in a low tone. "I'm not to have any diversion at all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"This is an old subject," answered Sir Theodosius nervously, controlling
  himself with difficulty. "You know that there are manifold diversions to your
  hand if you would but use them. You are ill-educated, you have not many
  accomplishments&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am out of the schoolroom," retorted Laura, "and don't intend to pore
  over schoolbooks."</p>

  <p>Sir Theodosius made a gesture with his hand as if he gave up the subject
  as hopeless.</p>

  <p>"There was an invitation from the Frobishers in Warwick the other day to a
  ball. You refused it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They're stiff, rustical people. I don't like them," said Laura. She
  twirled the sprig of half-opened laurel leaves in her hand. "I gave you a
  shock when I came in just now, didn't I!" she added maliciously. "You really
  thought I was a ghost. And you, too, Lucius."</p>

  <p>"Why, for a moment," he agreed good-naturedly, "so I did. I think you look
  charming in the costume, Miss Laura. Theo, do not be angry with her, it is
  but a natural play for a young lady to think of."</p>

  <p>"For an idle girl to think of!" replied Theodosius vehemently. "It vexes
  me to the heart, Laura, that you should go in for these tricks when, as I
  say, there is so much that you could do. There are the villagers, and there
  are small children and the aged who would be glad of your help. The vicar's
  wife, too&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Laura interrupted him with a wave of her hand.</p>

  <p>"This is very dull for Lucius and I am sure he doesn't wish to hear us
  disputing. I don't intend to take the frock off," she added mischievously. "I
  feel that I am the other Laura Sarelle. I shall close my eyes and imagine
  what she was like and what she did. Perhaps her whole history will come back
  to me in a kind of trance, or dream."</p>

  <p>Theodosius seized her wrist sternly, drew her close to him with a force
  that surprised both the girl and Lucius Delaunay, who stood alert with lips
  close together, as if ready to protect the sister from the brother. Sir
  Theodosius spoke quietly, though with intense force.</p>

  <p>"You heard what I said just now, Laura! Go upstairs at once, take off all
  that mummery and try to live a sane and sober life. If you do not do so I
  shall have you confined to your room."</p>

  <p>Lucius, considering this painful scene, saw that the girl was overawed but
  not frightened. Physically she submitted, spiritually she defied her master.
  Her eyes, that looked unnaturally dark beneath the powdered hair, flashed
  with a secret fury.</p>

  <p>She said, with a thin smile:</p>

  <p>"Very well, very well. I will do as you tell me, dear Theo, of course. You
  shall not be plagued with my nonsense again."</p>

  <p>With that he let go of her wrist, and glanced down at the marks his
  fingers had made on her pale flesh. She looked lovely in the costume of the
  last century, no question about that. Her slender figure was well suited by
  the long-pointed tight bodice, by the low corsage that showed more of her
  delicate bosom than Lucius Delaunay had ever beheld before; the dressing of
  the hair away from the face was becoming too and set off in all their strong
  purity her fine features. She had put some rouge on her cheeks and lips that
  accentuated her naturally brilliant complexion, that had the colour and
  purity of a blush rose. The billowing skirts were charming too, so were the
  little bands of velvet she had fastened at her wrists...</p>

  <p>Lucius thought that he had never seen her look so fair. He wondered if
  Theo recognized that his sister was beautiful and that in her youth was an
  appeal and a power that men would do well to recognize. Yet, looking at the
  girl, who seemed indeed so much the disputed portrait come to life, Mr.
  Delaunay felt a certain spiritual nausea, a sickness that after a while
  became almost physical. Something was wrong, he did not know what, in that
  exquisite and frail femininity, holding the laurel bough; he seemed to see
  the symbol of something that was doomed and evil. He had an impression that
  this was really the other Laura Sarelle, that she had returned to earth
  either to accomplish some desperate purpose or to avenge some desperate
  wrong.</p>

  <p>He was angry with himself for allowing such fancies to touch him, but the
  likeness was very strong and the costume was actually the dress worn by the
  original of the picture; he broke up the ugly interview by taking Laura's
  hand and drawing her to the door that he opened for her and leading her into
  the corridor.</p>

  <p>Then he returned to Theo and said firmly:</p>

  <p>"This confirms my decision. I leave your employment at once. Frankly, I do
  not care for your treatment of Laura. She may be foolish, but you are unduly
  harsh."</p>

  <p>Somewhat to his surprise, for he, had expected a violent defiance,
  Theodosius, who had again sunk into the chair and was passing his
  handkerchief over his forehead, damp with sweat, replied in low tones:</p>

  <p>"You would not say that if you knew the whole story. You don't understand
  with what I am confronted."</p>

  <p>"Then why not tell me?" asked Lucius eagerly. "I might be able to help
  you. As somebody who is outside all this, surely I could offer some
  assistance? What is it, some family legend, haunting, ghosts?"</p>

  <p>"Do you think," replied Sir Theodosius, stern again, "that I should be
  affected by nonsense of that kind?"</p>

  <p>"No, but perhaps Laura is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She doesn't know anything about it," replied the baronet, still ghastly
  livid.</p>

  <p>"No, maybe she doesn't know anything about it, but, she may sense or feel
  something. It might be in the atmosphere of the house, you know she's always
  loathed it&mdash;can't you tell me if anything did take place here? If that
  other Laura Sarelle was connected with anything that was horrible?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you use the word 'horrible'? You know that old story. It's been
  repeated again and again, you must be weary of it."</p>

  <p>"I don't know why I did use the word," replied Lucius Delaunay
  thoughtfully. "It came to me just now, when I saw Laura. She looked so
  charming, yet I just had that impression of something horrible."</p>

  <p>"Then you certainly are becoming foolish too," replied the baronet
  sternly. "All these foolish, girlish, sick fancies. Perhaps it would be as
  well if you went, Lucius. I see that we are not likely to be able to work
  together."</p>

  <p>"Not unless you alter your attitude towards Laura, Theo. It is
  disagreeable to stand by and see what one disapproves of and to be in the
  position of the paid servant to a man whose actions you dislike."</p>

  <p>"So you presume to judge me!" exclaimed Theodosius, who was in an
  increased state of violent agitation. "But I tell you nothing can move me.
  Laura stays at Leppard Hall, and so do I. I was brought up with this one
  object&mdash;that I should rule here and Laura should stay with me until she
  made a suitable marriage."</p>

  <p>"What," interrupted Lucius Delaunay, "do you consider, Theo, a suitable
  marriage for Laura? Don't you think that a man who could love her and
  understand her and take care of her would be a suitable husband?"</p>

  <p>"You speak very romantically," sneered the baronet. "I consider a suitable
  marriage one that would increase the prestige of our family, that would give
  her an establishment equal to mine."</p>

  <p>"And yet," replied Lucius curiously, "you have enough money, Theo, to set
  your sister up handsomely, to give her a fine dowry."</p>

  <p>"It is the provision of my father's will that I dower her," said the
  baronet. "I might add to it, I am a wealthy man. No doubt you know that,
  Lucius?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know, but it's never concerned me much. So Laura is to remain here
  until someone comes along sufficiently rich and noble to please you, to raise
  the prestige of the Sarelle family?"</p>

  <p>"You're sneering at me, Lucius, I know."</p>

  <p>"I never sneer, Theo, I hope. Perhaps there was some irony in my words. I
  think that you're going to sacrifice that girl for your own ambitions. And
  they're such strange ambitions, too. You live the life of a recluse here. Why
  don't you go abroad into the world and find a wife for yourself and found
  your own family?&mdash;and take Laura with you and let her meet people of her
  own station?"</p>

  <p>"When Laura is twenty-one, steps will be taken to present her to London
  Society. And then no doubt there will be sufficient pretenders to her
  hand."</p>

  <p>"No doubt, when the amount of her dowry is made known. But will she find
  among those pretenders someone whom she can really trust and love?"</p>

  <p>Sir Theodosius returned to his papers, which he now put into order with
  quick, neat, nervous movements.</p>

  <p>"So you wish to leave Leppard Hall at the end of the month?" he said
  coldly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Theo. I've given you my reasons as best I can. All my papers and
  accounts are in order. As for the translations&mdash;as I said before, you
  pass me in scholarship. I can't help you much there."</p>

  <p>And as if he wished to say no more, the young man, with a brief
  salutation, left the room. He was at once relieved and disappointed, at
  having put his resolution into action. He would be very glad to be away from
  Leppard Hall and even from Theo, whose company he had found for several
  months now a burden. He had first felt affection towards the sickly lad whose
  tastes were so much like his own, whose position was also like his own, in so
  far that he was orphaned and solitary. But these warm springs of feeling had
  been dried up by the constant coldness of the baronet, who was certainly as
  affable towards him as his nature allowed, but who had never admitted him to
  a close intimacy and who had made use of him in every direction without
  offering any return.</p>

  <p>Lucius Delaunay was too generous-hearted to resent this behaviour on his
  own account, but he much disliked Theodosius' attitude towards his tenants
  and most of all towards his sister.</p>

  <p>Why, then, did he slightly regret his resolution to leave Leppard Hall? He
  hardly knew himself; it was probably because of the fact that the girl must
  be left behind to the cold tyranny in this unnatural life.</p>

  <p>He walked through the park; a fine rain was falling and all the landscape
  was blurred in a pale, azure mist. He turned towards the river, since he had
  a brief leisure, to take the path that was bordered by wild mint, thyme,
  cresses and flags, and he was startled to see Laura ahead of him. And again
  he had the second's chilly feeling that it was a ghost he saw, for she still
  wore the fantastic, hooped yellow dress, but she was moving with a hurrying
  step towards the distant spire and the blot of grey that was the church and
  the graves that, huddled and leaning, overhung the sedgy banks of the
  Avon.</p>

  <p>He hastened after her, and she looked at him with a glad surprise that he
  was relieved to see, as it proved her humanity.</p>

  <p>"Why, Miss Laura, you must not come abroad like this! That ancient gown is
  very thin, I'll swear. You should have a cloak, it's raining."</p>

  <p>"Yes, see how the drops stay on my powdered curls." She pulled one of
  these over her shoulder. "You see the pomade will not allow them to penetrate
  my hair. I don't know when I shall ever be able to brush this stuff out, but
  I like it. Don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Miss Laura. As I told you, I think you look lovely indeed."</p>

  <p>"More lovely than the portrait?" she questioned him. "I shall have to find
  out about her now, shan't I?" She put her hand in his and laughed. "You see
  what courage this disguise gives me. I can say things now that I could not
  have said in the ordinary way. Oh, Lucius, you protected me, didn't you, just
  now when Theodosius was so unkind?"</p>

  <p>"I hope I didn't need to protect you, Laura."</p>

  <p>"But you were on my side. You were there. If he'd threatened me, or struck
  me, you would have interfered."</p>

  <p>"Theo would never have done that," replied Lucius, frowning. "You mustn't
  think such things, Laura." But in his own heart he was not too sure. There
  had been a dark violence under the young baronet's usually cold demeanour
  that had surprised and shocked him at the time. "But you'd best not play
  tricks. You'd best run home and take those clothes off and try to please your
  brother. The two years will soon pass and then&mdash;he's promised, you
  know&mdash;you are to go to London and have as much liberty as any young
  lady."</p>

  <p>"Now you're treating me as a child," she said. She made a movement as if
  she brushed his words aside. "And you don't mean what you say. How strange
  that we should be walking together like this! You, in your riding-clothes,
  might be from the eighteenth century too. You should have powdered hair, or
  your hair long and tied in a ribbon. Like the other portrait. But you don't
  resemble that, I think."</p>

  <p>She looked at him so anxiously that he became uneasy.</p>

  <p>"Laura, you must not give so much importance to these fancies. I think
  those clothes, and everything else you found in the trunk, should be burnt or
  put aside. You mustn't think so much of this other girl. After all, she was
  no near connection of yours, the whole thing is a mere accident."</p>

  <p>"A mere accident that I've come here, bearing her name! Well, I suppose
  so. I don't care!" She sighed. "Look! The clouds are passing!"</p>

  <p>He glanced upwards where the faint wreaths of mist were sailing away over
  a sky of the most delicate blue.</p>

  <p>"How lush the meadows are! When I come along to the river I don't dislike
  the place so much. Can you smell the thyme and mint as we walk along and
  crush it beneath our feet? I should like to have a boat here, then we might
  go together."</p>

  <p>"Laura," he checked her suddenly, "we shall not go together anywhere much
  longer. I'm going away."</p>

  <p>He felt the shock go through her, for she was still holding his hand. Then
  it seemed as if she were about to fall, and his arm went round her shoulders'
  to steady her.</p>

  <p>"Laura! Dear child! Don't mind! I know that you can't afford to miss
  friends, but indeed I must go away. And there will be other people, I'll
  speak to other people. They must come and take you out&mdash;from that house
  you dislike."</p>

  <p>Again she brushed aside his words, raising her hand and letting it
  fall.</p>

  <p>"Lucius! You can't go away! You must remain! Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>He took his arm from her shoulder and they stood side by side on the bank
  of the river. The flags with their gold-and-purple-striped flowers were in
  front of them and the river was moving with a slow sullen speed under the
  short alders and willows that dipped and trailed their long grey leaves in
  the sluggish water.</p>

  <p>"You can't go away," she said, as if she stated a fact. "You can't go
  away, Lucius."</p>

  <p>"My dear, I must. If I stayed I might become too fond of you."</p>

  <p>"But I am too fond of you already. I tried very hard to conceal that, yet
  somehow I always hoped that you knew it. Now my plans are awry I must tell
  you."</p>

  <p>"I mustn't listen to that, Laura," he interrupted with great tenderness,
  taking her hands, "nor consider it seriously. You are so young and
  inexperienced, dear, just a fanciful child. And I am the only person anywhere
  near your own age or station about here. Your liking is sure to have fallen
  on me. It doesn't mean what you suppose, Laura. You mustn't think of it
  again."</p>

  <p>"You are being cruel, and even wicked," she responded, and there was a
  hint of her brother's sternness in her manner, "to put me aside so, when you
  know what I say is true. When you know that I&mdash;I'm not going to say it
  here...And this is not perhaps the place and the time. But you can't go away,
  Lucius."</p>

  <p>"I must. Now, more than ever, I must. Say no more, but come back with me
  towards the house. Remember that the whole world is before you, and a wide
  choice of suitors, and that I am but a penniless man."</p>

  <p>Laura laughed wildly.</p>

  <p>"Go back to the house by yourself!" she cried, and ran from him along the
  flag-bordered river path.</p>

  <p>Lucius felt obliged to follow the hurrying figure in the fading primrose
  silk, although it inspired him with a faint, almost supernatural horror so
  that he would, could he have followed his own, as he felt, cowardly
  instincts, have turned and left her in the mist to which she seemed to
  belong.</p>

  <p>It was not long before he overtook Laura, who had paused, panting, where
  the bank was slightly steeper and was leaning against one of the bent
  willows. They had come much further than he had first supposed and were now
  not far from the churchyard.</p>

  <p>She looked at him in the strangest way, her expression, he thought, was
  one of surprise and reproach touched still by wildness.</p>

  <p>"I hope that you will not remember anything I said, Lucius. I speak, as
  you know, in a capricious fashion."</p>

  <p>"I shall never remember anything of you but what is full of respect," he
  replied. He was not usually at a loss for words, but now he scarcely knew
  what to say or even how to be sure of his own emotions.</p>

  <p>She gathered her breath and walked on ahead of him; she seemed resolute to
  reach the tall church and lichen-covered gravestones.</p>

  <p>"Laura," he said, keeping beside her with difficulty, for she had broken
  into a run again and he did not wish to have an appearance of undue haste,
  lest they should be observed and he should be supposed to be pursuing her.
  And strange she looked, as he well realized, in her gown of the last century
  and her long powdered hair. "Laura, nothing of this has anything to do with
  you. Why are you hurrying towards those graves?"</p>

  <p>"The mausoleum," she replied, "is even more melancholy, but let us not
  talk of that. You may leave me, Lucius, I do not desire your escort. I think
  I shall do what Theodosius so often bids me do&mdash;pay a duty call on the
  vicar's wife and ask her if there are any sick or poor in the parish whom I
  may visit with my basket of jellies and fruits."</p>

  <p>He knew that she spoke in mockery, but she seemed to him to have quite
  regained her control, and that he was even inclined, though with a flat sense
  of disappointment, to believe her when she said she had meant nothing of what
  she had said in the earlier part of their conversation.</p>

  <p>So he raised his beaver hat and turned and left her abruptly, admitting
  that both the girl and the moment had defeated him.</p>

  <p>He had work to do, work for Theodosius, and for the first time since he
  had been in the young baronet's employment that thought galled. Repairs were
  needed to the wheel of the old stone mill, which always seemed, even to
  sunny-tempered Lucius Delaunay, a gloomy place. But Theodosius did not easily
  pay for his repairs to his property, and it was the business of the steward
  to see that all expenditure was well laid out. The thought of this task that
  he had to do for the brother hung strangely in his mind as he turned and
  watched the primrose-clad figure of the sister stealing towards the
  churchyard.</p>

  <p>Well, no doubt he had spoken more truly than he had thought at the time
  when he had said that she was but an undisciplined girl and her fancies
  should be taken no notice of. She led an idle and perhaps a pampered life. He
  must harden himself against her, must not allow himself to feel too
  sympathetic and sensitive towards one who, after all, had so little to
  complain of. Her dislike of Leppard Hall must be but a petulant whim and what
  she had said to him but a whim too. Why, she was too young to know her own
  mind. The whole world was before her and in a year or two she would have
  changed entirely.</p>

  <p>So he made his way to the mill that stood on a bend of the river about
  half a mile from the Hall in the opposite direction from the church. It was
  an ancient building, and he noted again the date 1605 cut above the doorway.
  The sound of the mill wheel was both soothing and melancholy in the ears of
  Lucius Delaunay. He watched it for a moment as it went round and round, the
  long weeds dangling dark and wet from the slats, the water racing and curling
  in brown foam in the mill-pool.</p>

  <p>Then he looked up and down the river. So impressive had been his last
  interview with Laura Sarelle that he believed he would never be able to see
  the banks of the Avon without seeing, too, her figure in the pale silk gown
  hastening along the sedgy path.</p>

  <p>What she had said about the landscape was true enough; it was melancholy,
  so flat, so faint in hues, so desolate. There was not a human being in sight
  and the constant mist from the river and the water-meadows seemed to enclose
  the landscape more surely than mountains.</p>

  <p>Leppard Hall, too, the mill, the mausoleum, the church and the home farm,
  it was true that they were all grey and sombre in outline and in hue.</p>

  <p>He tried to dismiss these thoughts, foolish as they seemed to him, from
  his mind; he tried to persuade himself that it was not because of the general
  isolation and melancholy of the place that he was leaving it. He felt like a
  man who was making an effort to throw off a spell, to get to his own kind,
  his own kin and friends in a country where there would be more company, more
  active work for him to do. He had been as if drugged by this long routine, a
  certain sloth had fallen upon him. It was true that he had plenty to do, both
  on the estate and in the study of Theodosius, yet the days Were so
  monotonous, each so like the other, that he felt that his faculties were
  becoming numbed.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>After his business talk with Mr. Tampion, the miller, it occurred to
  Lucius Delaunay to ask him about the history of the Sarelles, a thing that he
  had never done since he had been in the employment of Sir
  Theodosius&mdash;first, out of indifference, then, during the last few
  months, out of delicacy; for since Laura had begun to protest about the
  portrait hanging in the dining-room of Leppard Hall and to make her nervous
  inquiries about the history of the original, since he had seen the dislike of
  Theodosius to touch upon this subject, the steward had felt that it was
  merely good manners to refrain from endeavouring to satisfy any curiosity he
  might himself have on this matter.</p>

  <p>But so powerful had been the impression made on him that afternoon by his
  talk with Laura Sarelle, so shaken was he still inwardly by the emotion she
  had roused in him, that he put such fine considerations aside and asked the
  man bluntly (for he knew that his family had been long at the mill, since the
  days of Elizabeth, he believed) what was the story of the last heiress of the
  main branch of the family.</p>

  <p>"There's something, I believe, and it's not easy to come at," he
  added.</p>

  <p>The miller looked straight at him and made a surprising answer:</p>

  <p>"We all hold our leases, sir, on condition we don't speak about that."</p>

  <p>"Surely you have nothing so fantastic in writing?" demanded Lucius
  Delaunay.</p>

  <p>"No, sir." The man seemed uneasy yet prepared to stand his ground stoutly.
  "But it was well understood in the time of Sir John. My father had his lease
  renewed by him, sir, but we were not to make any remarks or cause any gossip
  or scandal about what had happened at Leppard Hall. For it's a long time ago,
  sir, and nobody's concern now."</p>

  <p>"No, and certainly not mine. If you're rebuking me, you're certainly in
  the right," said Mr. Delaunay. "But I'll tell you what made me ask you. Miss
  Laura is a very sensitive and nervous young lady, she's taken a great dislike
  to the Hall. I'm not telling you a secret, for I know she informs everyone of
  it. You must have heard it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, she speaks freely in front of the servants, sir," agreed Mr. Tampion
  rather shortly, "and I've heard of it. She came down here herself one day and
  went all over the old mill and asked me a number of questions."</p>

  <p>"And you answered her, I suppose, as cautiously as you're answering me
  now. Well, I'll not press the matter. But I thought perhaps that if I knew
  something I might be able to help her. She is, in a way, haunted," he added.
  "And if one knew the truth one might help to lay the ghost."</p>

  <p>"To know the truth wouldn't help you in that task, sir," replied the
  miller grimly. "I can assure you that it's a story best forgotten. It's a
  long time ago," he repeated, "and it's such a dark business and one that no
  one knows the truth about, even now."</p>

  <p>"There was an inquest, wasn't there?" said Mr. Delaunay, who was by no
  means prepared to relinquish this opportunity of finding out something about
  the dead Laura Sarelle. "This young woman&mdash;the heiress to the whole
  estate, wasn't she?&mdash;died soon after?"</p>

  <p>"You may leave it at that, sir."</p>

  <p>Lucius was inclined to laugh at this deep reserve.</p>

  <p>"I understand the bottom of the whole business," he smiled. "Sir John, as
  I've learnt from Sir Theodosius, and his younger brother were both determined
  to be very stoic and philosophical. They were sceptics in all religious
  matters and resolved to allow no touch of superstition to weaken them in
  their beliefs. I think that's why they determined that Sir Theodosius and his
  sister should live at Leppard Hall. Although they must have known," he added,
  drawing a shot at random, "that it was a sinister place."</p>

  <p>Richard Tampion looked sharply at the steward.</p>

  <p>"They didn't live there themselves, sir, you'll notice. Both the old
  baronet and his brother were always away on one excuse or another. The
  younger had his estate in Jamaica, the elder was fond of travelling. And I
  heard say that that was why he never married. He said the Hall wasn't a fit
  place to bring a woman to."</p>

  <p>"Now we seem to be coming to the heart of the matter," said Lucius
  Delaunay. "Why wasn't it a fit place to bring a woman to? You know, I'm
  inclined to agree with him. That's why I'm sorry for Miss Laura, and even for
  her companion, Mrs. Sylk."</p>

  <p>"The maids don't like staying at the place, though some of them are not
  aware of what took place there," admitted the miller confidentially. "You
  notice, sir, that the girls are always changing, and then they'll get fresh
  ones from Warwick or Rugby who don't know anything about it. And then
  there'll be a whisper, or a look, or a noise heard at night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are you telling me the place is haunted?" interrupted Lucius Delaunay.
  "You'd better tell me the whole tale and have done with it."</p>

  <p>But the miller seemed to think that he had already gone too far. Either
  from fear or honesty or from some ingrained taciturnity, for it seemed to
  have been impressed on both him and his father that they should be silent on
  this matter, he refused to say any more, and Lucius Delaunay had to turn away
  from the old mill unsatisfied.</p>

  <p>'I am becoming infected by this place,' he thought, 'making something
  monstrous out of nothing at all. What have I learned from that good man?
  Merely that there is a lot of gossip and talk about something that happened
  in one's grandparents' time.'</p>

  <p>He tried to reconstruct what possible stories of the dead Laura Sarelle
  there might have been. No doubt she was a nervous and sickly girl like the
  present bearer of the name. Sickly, that was, in her imagination, for he
  could not think of Laura Sarelle as suffering from any bodily malady; she
  seemed, indeed, to give out a radiant vitality.</p>

  <p>Well, then, Miss Laura Sarelle in the year 1780 would be living in Leppard
  Hall. It must have been the same then as it was now, the façade would almost
  be new, for it had been put on by the sixth baronet in the middle years of
  the eighteenth century.</p>

  <p>Would she have been living there alone? Delaunay puzzled over that. Sole
  heiress and mistress of the servants and the estate? It was not likely. She
  must, at least, even if she had been orphaned, and he did not know if that
  was so, have had a companion, a Mrs. Sylk. He smiled to himself, thinking of
  the two ladies in their eighteenth-century dresses in the house where
  Theodosius and Laura now lived. The furniture would be the same, and on the
  wall no doubt would hang the picture that Laura so disliked. It must have
  been painted when that Laura Sarelle was very young.</p>

  <p>Had she gone to London for the sitting or had some journeyman
  painter&mdash;that was what the quality of the work seemed to
  indicate&mdash;come to Leppard Hall?</p>

  <p>Then this cousin, who was he? Or was it even a man? Delaunay was not sure
  that he had heard the sex of the victim named. Indeed, it was only lately
  that he had begun to take an interest in the affair. Why had this cousin,
  male or female, taken the sleeping-draught? What was the malady that the drug
  was supposed to soothe, and how came it that the girl and not the victim
  himself or a servant had administered it?</p>

  <p>And then an inquest&mdash;a rare thing in those days. Doctors, as Mr.
  Delaunay knew, were both ignorant and careless in the eighteenth century, and
  there must have been something glaring to arouse the suspicions of the local
  physician. And what had happened at the inquest?&mdash;something unpleasant,
  some prying into the privacy of the heiress of Leppard Hall, some hint, that
  she had, perhaps, been not only indiscreet but malicious?</p>

  <p>And, when all was over, had she returned feeling blasted, tainted, to that
  lonely sombre house and died? Of what? 'Like the ermine, from the first stain
  upon her snowy fleece,' thought Lucius, indulging his fancy. 'Or, in more
  practical common sense, as I have heard, from a consumption of the lungs,
  speeded, perhaps, by the damp of the water-meadows?'</p>

  <p>And so she was the last of her line, and they laid her in the
  churchyard&mdash;now, why the churchyard and not the mausoleum? And why no
  kind of epitaph or text upon her grave? That, for the period, was certainly
  unusual. Still, she had died and been carried out to her grave and a distant
  cousin had inherited the Hall and the grounds, and all the estates and the
  plumbago and the coal mines as well.</p>

  <p>And he had married in due course and had his two sons&mdash;the younger
  had taken on the Jamaica estate that had been for so long in the family, and
  the elder, Sir John, had inherited, also in due course, Leppard Hall. But
  neither he nor his father had lived there, nor had his younger brother. Yet
  there had been this charge upon these two young people to do so.</p>

  <p>'This is, no doubt,' thought Mr. Delaunay, 'a fantastic family.'</p>

  <p>And he worked it out in his mind that the three men who had evaded living,
  save for the briefest space, on the Warwickshire estate had, as it were,
  soothed their consciences by laying a charge upon the present generation to
  do so.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they think that whatever happened has been dispersed by now, as
  an evil vapour slowly disperses by the action of time. Perhaps they think
  that anything melancholy or sombre about the place will have worn off through
  the passage of the years. Of course, there would be a great pride in the
  place that had been in their hands for so long, they would want to keep up
  the continuity of the family. I believe there was a stern injunction on Sir
  Theodosius from his father, though I doubt if he'll carry it out. The whole
  tale leads one into some curious corners of the human mind and I shall be
  glad to be away from it all."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The steward performed his other duties, routine and monotonous, and in the
  evening, instead of going as was his custom up to Leppard Hall for dinner, he
  went to his own house&mdash;the Dower House, that was on the opposite side of
  the Avon and reached by a small Georgian bridge. This house was far too large
  for Mr. Delaunay's use and he occupied but three rooms on the ground floor,
  the rest being shut up but kept aired and spotlessly clean by his good
  housekeeper, Mrs. Pettigrew.</p>

  <p>In the apartments that he occupied he had put a good many of his own
  possessions. He came of as good a family as the Sarelles and had many
  relatives who were interested in him; therefore he did not lack for personal
  possessions of a certain value and richness, and the three rooms had been
  transformed into something far more pleasing, and in a way splendid, than the
  handsomely appointed rooms of Leppard Hall. Pictures, mirrors and carpets the
  steward had, with a lavish hand, arranged about the place, something to the
  resentment and even the sneers of Sir Theodosius. But that had been one of
  the understandings on which Mr. Delaunay had, rather reluctantly, taken up
  this post with his college friend&mdash;he must have his own possessions
  about him and, to a certain extent, lead his own life.</p>

  <p>'And I was a fool,' he thought now, looking round the room that he had
  himself made pleasant, 'to undertake this work. I thought I was a solitary
  and I'm not. I thought I was a keen classical scholar, and I'm not. I thought
  that I was fond of Theo, and I'm not. And I thought I was going to be quite
  indifferent to his sister, and I am not.'</p>

  <p>He looked round at his books, the bright and agreeable portraits of his
  father and mother, the bowls of early flowers, brightly coloured tulips,
  daisies and roses that his housekeeper had arranged on the highly polished
  furniture.</p>

  <p>He realized&mdash;how was it that all of a sudden he had come to all these
  sharp realizations?&mdash;that life at Leppard Hall had only been endurable
  because he had had this retreat to come to, that he had just put through and
  made tolerable his visits to Leppard Hall by the thought of this retreat,
  where often he had the acquaintances he had made in Rugby and Warwick to
  visit him, and where the neighbouring gentry called far more frequently than
  they did at Leppard Hall, where the pedantic young master discouraged all
  visitors.</p>

  <p>He had been there two years. There would be a certain amount of trouble in
  packing his possessions and taking them on the rail and ship to Ireland. But
  it would have to be done and he would be glad when it was over.</p>

  <p>To give himself a sense of support he took from his desk the letters that
  his uncle had recently written to him, urging him to leave what seemed to be
  a paltry post and to rejoin his family and friends in Ireland. Though he had
  but little fortune he was not a pauper, his poverty was merely comparative to
  his rank.</p>

  <p>His uncle urged marriage upon him, too, and mentioned the name of a lady
  whom he, Lucius, had once regarded with great admiration but whom he had
  never dared to approach owing to his lack of fortune. Now, reading her name,
  the young man felt cold towards her, she was but a pleasant memory, the
  perfume of a last year's flower.</p>

  <p>When his housekeeper, Mrs. Pettigrew, came in to set the cloth for his
  elegantly served meal the steward asked her suddenly, as he had asked Mr.
  Tampion, the miller, if she knew anything of the former history of the
  Sarelles, and particularly of that of the last Laura Sarelle. And he
  outlined, as the woman stood attentive before him, all his reasons for
  putting these queries.</p>

  <p>Her reply, given placidly enough, was that she knew nothing. She was a
  Londoner, and though she had been on the estate for some years she had only
  come there on her marriage. She had, it was true, questioned her husband on
  these very subjects herself&mdash;"but his mouth shut like a trap, sir, if
  you'll believe me. It seems that everyone here is under some bond or pledge
  not to talk about the past. I think something very scandalous or disgraceful
  happened." She lowered her voice discreetly. "The young lady, as I suppose,
  tried to run away with one who was much inferior to her in birth. She died of
  a broken heart when she was prevented."</p>

  <p>This commonplace episode was not in the least what Lucius Delaunay had
  expected. His curiosity was sharpened. He asked Mrs. Pettigrew if she could
  tell him of anybody likely to give him any information about the Sarelle
  family. It seemed ill-bred to pry into the secrets of Sir Theodosius behind
  his back, but he thought of Laura, her loneliness, her fear, her distress.
  Only by some knowledge of the past could he help her, then he checked that
  excuse.</p>

  <p>'Who am I, to be thinking of helping Laura Sarelle when I am leaving the
  place, and leaving so soon?'</p>

  <p>Indeed the suddenness of his departure seemed to him almost like a flight,
  yet he meant to help Laura, even from a distance. He would write to
  Theodosius, he would see if she had friends and relatives in London; he could
  wait on them and tell them of the girl's plight. And how much easier it would
  be to present his case if he knew the grounds for her fear and distress! Yet
  there again there was confusion, because Laura herself did not know what was
  alarming and agitating her so profoundly.</p>

  <p>'But I,' thought the young man, 'will find out'</p>

  <p>The housekeeper, pressed, suggested that the Reverend Nathaniel Mist, the
  vicar of the Church of St. Nicholas, which was the family church of the
  Sarelles and also of the neighbouring village, might be able to tell him
  something...</p>

  <p>'Of course,' reflected Lucius Delaunay, 'there will be records in the
  church, but nothing else. And I dare say the old man Will be as tight as an
  oyster. It will be more difficult to deal with someone of education than with
  these country people. The Reverend Nathaniel Mist would know how to evade me.
  I wonder how long he has had the living...He is an elderly man and seems
  retired to the point of moroseness.'</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The following morning Lucius Delaunay, who had no particular business on
  hand, avoided the Hall and set out instead for the church. He went towards
  the path where his remembrance of his last meeting with Laura Sarelle was so
  clear that he could see her pale yellow-clad figure in front of him, and he
  met one of the men from Leppard Hall, who seemed to be returning from the
  village, making across the open parkland. This fellow stopped, and touching
  his hat respectfully asked the steward if he had heard of the illness of Miss
  Laura Sarelle.</p>

  <p>"Sir Theodosius has been asking for you, sir, and I was coming up to the
  Dower House to see if you were there. He would like to see you as soon as you
  can get up to the Hall."</p>

  <p>A curious sense of shock held Lucius Delaunay immobile. It was as if a
  long-expected calamity suddenly confronted him, but his breeding enabled him
  to pass the moment over with no more than a decorous show of alarm and
  sympathy.</p>

  <p>He asked for details of Miss Laura's illness, but the man knew nothing
  save that Dr. Selby from Warwick had been sent for. He thought that the young
  lady had got chilled walking out late yesterday in the water-meadows.</p>

  <p>"She had thin shoes and some kind of a fancy dress on, sir. Mrs. Sylk said
  that she got her feet damp. She's supposed to be better this morning. They do
  say as she was light-headed last night."</p>

  <p>Lucius Delaunay considered rapidly: 'If I go to Leppard Hall I shall not
  be able to see her. Theodosius will be agitated, even angry. Better to let
  some little time go by.'</p>

  <p>So he said, "You may tell Sir Theodosius that I shall wait on him this
  afternoon," and continued his way to the vicarage.</p>

  <p>This was a low, grey stone house close to the churchyard, and the sombre
  melancholy of its outline was concealed by climbing roses, ivy and jasmine,
  and the garden was pleasant with the May flowers.</p>

  <p>Martha Mist, the vicar's wife, a dreary woman who seemed to have no direct
  contact with life and in whom no one was interested, was not yet out of bed.
  She suffered from some kind of unnamed complaint that kept her, in the
  genteel phrase, "confined to her chamber." But Agnes, the comely maidservant,
  a little startled at seeing the handsome young steward in the doorway, as if
  she was not used to anything so vital and vivid in the drab house, said that
  her master would soon attend to Mr. Delaunay in the library.</p>

  <p>In this shabby room the steward waited. He had seen the vicar only on
  formal occasions and knew little of him, though it had been necessary to go
  to church on Sundays and sometimes on other days as well; it had been
  necessary to endure the dull man's tedious sermons, and his slow and lagging
  administration of the Anglican ritual.</p>

  <p>There was something about the old house that was full of this same flat
  personality. In the room everything was worn and cheerless, the books on the
  shelves were all of the most commonplace nature; but Mr. Delaunay, kept
  waiting some while, had nothing better to do than to look at these volumes,
  mostly ecclesiastical works, sermons and dreary diatribes on obsolete points
  of theological doctrines.</p>

  <p>But as he glanced round the shelves he saw a few calf-bound books and some
  old pamphlets loosely stitched together on the history of Warwickshire and
  Northampton. Thinking there might be some reference to the Serene family in
  these, he took one down at random and turned the pages. He found nothing to
  hold his attention save a rudely executed print of a handsome man whose face
  seemed to him faintly familiar. He studied this for some time, trying to fix
  the resemblance in his mind, but could not do so. His curiosity, however, was
  sufficiently quickened for him to glance at the opposite page of browning
  yellow print.</p>

  <p>This contained an account of the execution of a certain Captain Avershaw
  in the county town of Warwick. The unfortunate man was spoken of as "an
  elegant gentleman entirely dressed in black, who had a flower in his mouth
  and bore himself with the greatest punctilio on the scaffold."</p>

  <p>Glancing higher up the page, Lucius Delaunay read that the criminal had
  contrived to get hold of a basket of black cherries while in prison and had
  made several drawings on the wall of his cell that were allowed to possess
  considerable artistic merits.</p>

  <p>The steward had got thus far in his reading when he heard the shuffling
  steps of the vicar, and not wishing to be caught, as it might seem to be,
  prying, he shut the book up and returned it to its place. The image of the
  man in the cheap engraving still, however, hung in his mind as if it were a
  bad copy of some face that he knew. Although there was no name on the plate
  he believed it to be a portrait of the unlucky Captain Avershaw, and it at
  once excited and repelled him because it was so unlike the face that one
  would suppose a murderer to possess; for his hasty glance had told him that
  Edward Avershaw had been hanged for murder. The features were gay and even
  noble, and the curled powdered hair, the nicely knotted cravat and brocade
  coat were the height of luxury, though they had the melancholy of an old
  fashion.</p>

  <p>The Reverend Nathaniel greeted his visitor with an embarrassed attempt at
  cordiality that barely concealed his surprise at this visit.</p>

  <p>"I hope, sir," he asked uneasily, "you've not come on behalf of Miss
  Laura&mdash;to summon me to the Hall I mean?"</p>

  <p>Lucius Delaunay understood that the clergyman thought the girl was
  seriously ill, perhaps dying. He quickly, and with a touch of horror,
  disclaimed any such errand.</p>

  <p>"I know very little about the illness of Miss Laura. It was sudden and
  not, I think, severe."</p>

  <p>"You haven't been up to the Hall, then, to-day?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I'm going this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Why, I should have thought, Mr. Delaunay, with this news, you would have
  been up there this morning to see what help you could be."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, it's a large household."</p>

  <p>"But Sir Theodosius lacks friends. I was going there myself." The vicar
  glanced down at his slippered feet as if annoyed with his own inertia. "My
  wife, as you know, takes a good deal of my attendance and my care, but I was
  certainly going up to the Hall myself. It's an isolated place," he added,
  scratching his chin, "and there are few neighbours."</p>

  <p>"But Miss Laura's not seriously ill."</p>

  <p>Lucius Delaunay, feeling that he had been rather remiss&mdash;but how
  could he possibly explain to the vicar the cause of his
  remissness?&mdash;repeated what the servant he had met on the banks of the
  river had told him, that Miss Laura was in no danger. "She's liable to these
  attacks, you know. She was out yesterday in thin shoes, in a fanciful dress,
  that of an ancestress, which she found in a chest."</p>

  <p>The vicar gave him a sly look out of his dull eyes, took off his
  spectacles, polished and replaced them. Then he said, in a dry mumbling
  voice:</p>

  <p>"Miss Laura was found in the river, close to the church. My gardener and
  the sexton pulled her out. It's no use making a secret of it, the whole
  village knows."</p>

  <p>Lucius Delaunay had enough self-control to remain silent, but the words
  that flashed through his mind were: 'So she threw herself into the river a
  short time after I left her...'</p>

  <p>The vicar, looking away from the young man, continued in his slow, stupid
  voice:</p>

  <p>"It was an accident, of course. The river bank is very slippery just
  there. As you say, she had those thin shoes on, the soles were coated with
  sticky mud. She's a capricious young lady. It was raining at the time&mdash;a
  foolish thing to be out in those light clothes."</p>

  <p>"A dangerous accident," agreed Mr. Delaunay quietly. "I had no
  suspicion&mdash;from what Halston said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, she might have died. I suppose the weeds and rubbish would have
  held her up for a while; it's very thick there, you know, with undergrowth
  just underneath the churchyard. But the sexton was passing and he called my
  gardener's boy and they had her out in a trice. She swooned, but only from
  shock, I think. We did what we could for her here and sent up to the Hall,
  and Mrs. Sylk, the housekeeper, and her brother came and took her back. I
  don't wonder she's ill. If I were you, Mr. Delaunay, I should go and see Sir
  Theodosius."</p>

  <p>Then he added suddenly: "But I forgot! Of course you came to ask me
  something. What is it? What can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>Lucius Delaunay found his resolve quickened, not slackened, by the
  shocking news he had just heard. He put his case quickly, with well-chosen
  abrupt words, before the vicar, both in view of the state of Laura Sarelle's
  health and his desire to know what was the history that consciously or
  unconsciously tormented her uneasy mind.</p>

  <p>The vicar did not dismiss the matter as easily as had the miller and the
  housekeeper. He said very gravely:</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid, Mr. Delaunay, I'm not at liberty to answer your question.
  It's an old and it's an ugly story, and all of us round here who are in any
  way connected with Leppard Hall are pledged not to repeat it. The idea of Sir
  John and of his brother, the father of Sir Theodosius, was always that the
  tale should be forgotten."</p>

  <p>"But you can't, you know!" exclaimed Lucius with vehemence. "It comes up,
  like burying a strong thing alive in a shallow grave&mdash;it will start up
  again. It's like trying to ignore a ghost, it must be laid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, that sounds very superstitious sort of talk," returned the vicar
  with a sickly smile. "I don't know anything about hauntings or ghosts, there
  has never been anything so far as I know. And I'm inclined to believe that
  these old tragedies are best ignored. It's true that none of the three first
  heirs of the cadet branch of the Sarelles lived at Leppard Hall; no doubt
  they had their reasons. But I think it was the idea of both Sir John and his
  brother that the tragedy, whatever it was, is worked out now and that the
  family ought to take up residence here in the old place again."</p>

  <p>"But they're dead, all of them," interrupted Lucius, "and I'm not
  concerned with them, sir, under your pardon."</p>

  <p>"Whom are you concerned with?" asked the vicar slowly. "With Miss Laura
  Sarelle?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, with the girl, and in a sense with her brother, too. Oh, I am not
  emotionally involved," smiled Mr. Delaunay. "In fact, I am leaving Sarelle. I
  think my life here is too easy and slothful. I have a more active turn than I
  thought I had. My relatives in Ireland want me also. They can find more
  energetic work for me. I might even go abroad. I'm not a man to stay in one
  place long."</p>

  <p>"You make a great ado to excuse yourself, sir," replied the Reverend
  Nathaniel Mist. "I always wondered why a young man of your temperament
  remained at Leppard Hall. Well, though you're going away, you want to do
  something for Miss Laura? But I don't see that you can. And even if I were to
  tell you all the story I don't see how it could help you. Mind you, she knows
  nothing about it, so it can't be that that's making her melancholy or
  uneasy."</p>

  <p>"But she senses it. Don't you understand? It's about the Hall, something
  quite intangible, like a haunting, or a dream. I don't care for the place
  myself. Of course, I've a great deal else to think about and work to do, and
  I absorb myself in my spare time in the Greek studies of Sir Theodosius, but
  I have felt it. And to an idle girl, shut up there all day, one can't doubt
  when one listens to her, sir, of her sincere desire to escape. I think she
  ought to be helped."</p>

  <p>The vicar stretched out his chin and stroked it</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he said in a hesitating manner, "this illness will be an
  excuse. You should see Dr. Selby, or rather&mdash;what am I saying, you've
  not an authority. It would make mischief for you to interfere. I'll see him
  myself. I'll suggest that he urge Miss Laura is taken away. I suppose they've
  relatives somewhere?"</p>

  <p>"Distant connections, I believe. Anyhow, friends could be found who would
  take the lady."</p>

  <p>"It's a strange affair," sighed the vicar, "a very strange affair indeed.
  If I were to tell you the whole tale you would realize how strange it
  is."</p>

  <p>"I've come here to urge you to tell me the whole tale, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well, you're going away and I don't see why you should concern yourself
  with it," returned the vicar obstinately. "You won't be able to help Miss
  Sarelle any better if I tell you the story of her ancestress. And it isn't
  really her ancestress either; that other Laura Sarelle ended the first branch
  of the house. They are distant connections from Yorkshire, as I suppose you
  know."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know all that," replied Lucius Delaunay impatiently. "But I want
  to know what's at the bottom of the business. Why the whole house, the mill,
  the home farm, even the fields, seem hateful, haunted. The girl feels it, I
  know, in every nerve. You wouldn't want her to stay here until she was
  desperate and did herself a mischief, would you?" he asked direct.</p>

  <p>He could see that the old man knew what he meant. Both of them were
  thinking of yesterday and the fantastically dressed figure that had slid
  through the alder and willow bushes into the turgid waters of the River
  Avon.</p>

  <p>"No, it would be a shameful wrong," agreed the vicar reluctantly. "Her
  brother's a very strange young man, very learned and precocious no doubt, and
  I sometimes wonder&mdash;" he added with a shrewdness that was unusual in
  him. "Of course there are matters one must not talk of or even hint at, but
  the family has always been eccentric."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Lucius Delaunay, exasperated, "I suppose I can ride into
  Warwick or Rugby and buy some local history, some antiquarian pamphlet on the
  place and find out the story of that Laura Sarelle. And this mysterious
  cousin&mdash;was it a man or a woman?&mdash;who took an overdose of a
  sleeping-draught?"</p>

  <p>"You may buy histories, but you'll never get an account of that tale. The
  whole affair was too carefully hushed up, the family was far too powerful.
  It's known only to a few people. There was an account of it published and
  I've a copy here"&mdash;he nodded towards the bookcase&mdash;"but there was
  only a small number of examples issued from the press and they were
  withdrawn."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, will you lend me yours?" asked Lucius Delaunay eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I should not think of doing so, my dear sir. And even if I were to it
  would not make any difference. You would not, as the saying goes, be able to
  put two and two together."</p>

  <p>"Can you, at least, tell me," asked Lucius, "the identity of the person
  upon whom the inquest was held? Was the cousin male or female?"</p>

  <p>"It was not a cousin at all," replied the vicar, turning his fingers
  inward and looking down reflectively at his nails. "It was not that girl's
  cousin&mdash;but her brother."</p>

  <p>"Her brother!" cried Lucius Delaunay, startled. "I did not know that there
  was a male heir at that time."</p>

  <p>"Yes, they were twins," said the clergyman. He looked out through the
  rather dingy cotton curtains of the vicarage into the garden, full of striped
  pinks and rose bushes beginning to show small glossy leaves. "I know there is
  a confusion in the minds of most people. They believe that he died several
  years before. As I tell you, that part of the Sarelle history is kept
  purposely obscure."</p>

  <p>"I want to understand why," insisted Lucius Delaunay.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear sir, it is really no matter of yours," said the clergyman.
  He looked up, and his pale face, which was slightly freckled, reminded the
  young man of the placid, sad, ugly countenance of a toad. "And I can't say I
  know a good deal of it myself. I have never, you understand, gone into
  details. I consider that it would be disloyal to do so. But perhaps what I
  have told you will induce you not to pursue your investigations. There were
  twins&mdash;brother and sister, Laura and Theodosius&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Theodosius, too?" interrupted Lucius Delaunay. "The same name?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, a very sickly young man, not destined, I think, in any case, to live
  long."</p>

  <p>"And he died through the overdose of a sleeping-draught?"</p>

  <p>"He died through taking the wrong medicine," said Mr. Nathaniel Mist,
  still gazing out of the window. "His sister was a very nervous creature and
  did not long survive the shock. I think we could leave the matter at that,
  Mr. Delaunay. I believe I can congratulate you on leaving Leppard Hall."</p>

  <p>"You do not, sir, care for the place yourself?" asked the young man
  sharply, with narrowed eyes.</p>

  <p>"I believe no one does. I don't know why I've endured it so long. At
  least, I do know, but I don't care to admit the reason even to myself." The
  shabby clergyman gave him a sideways look. "I'm an old man, and I mustn't
  pick and choose where I spend my last years. I'm not much of a scholar and
  nothing of a preacher. I do my routine work, that's all, and look after my
  poor sick wife. My children are scattered, you know, one in India, one in
  America. Well, well, one mustn't complain."</p>

  <p>Lucius Delaunay 'thought that the old man was rambling in his speech and
  wished to make his escape. But while he was considering how he could do so
  courteously Nathaniel Mist came straight back to the point.</p>

  <p>"I have rather an odd little library collected during my leisure moments.
  I've been interested in strange happenings, queer subjects like necromancy,
  and phantoms and hauntings. I don't wish to talk about that now, but I might
  put one or two points before you, sir, that would perhaps help you to
  consider this case." He suddenly pointed a fat, pale finger at the young man.
  "Have you ever thought of this&mdash;the dreams of the dead?"</p>

  <p>"Nay," replied Lucius, shaking his head. "It sounds horrible. Impossible,
  too," he added impatiently.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Wasn't it our great poet, our Swan of Avon himself, who
  said 'in that sleep, what dreams come'? I sometimes think that this whole
  place is infected with the dreams of the dead, that they can project them
  into very powerful forms, phantoms perhaps&mdash;whispers&mdash;suggestions.
  My wife," he added, "insists that she has seen these spectres, though I bid
  her be very cautious how she speaks of them."</p>

  <p>'A sick woman's fancy,' thought Lucius, and he turned away towards the
  door, saying civilly:</p>

  <p>"I suppose, sir, there are few old houses, or churches, or villages in the
  country that do not have their ghosts or phantoms. I confess I have no
  opinions on this point. I would be neither rashly sceptical nor blindly
  credulous. I came to you for some knowledge of the history of the
  Sarelles."</p>

  <p>"Don't inquire any further," warned the clergyman. "I have given you one
  or two hints. I think that Miss Laura should be taken away from Leppard
  Hall."</p>

  <p>"I have no power to persuade Sir Theodosius," said Mr. Delaunay
  heavily.</p>

  <p>"But you are his best friend. You help him not only to manage his estate
  but in his pastime, his classical studies that we all hear are so abstruse.
  Arrian, eh? A Stoic!"</p>

  <p>"Still, I am not close in his intimacy. He is a strange young man, but my
  friend, therefore I must not discuss him. But I can tell you, sir, strange
  for his years."</p>

  <p>Lucius Delaunay left the conversation at that, for the clergyman, though
  willing to ramble on about topics that interested him, for he was a lonely
  man and, given as solitaries are to inconsequent speech, was obviously not
  inclined to impart the information that Mr. Delaunay had come to gather.</p>

  <p>As the steward passed into the passage, closing the door on his host, who
  did not accompany him, he saw the little maidservant, Agnes, a rustic girl
  hardly yet broken into the decorum of genteel service, standing by the
  newel-post and looking at him with shy intensity. As, he closed the study
  door she came forward and, dropping a curtsy, whispered:</p>

  <p>"Please, sir, the mistress would like to see you. She can't leave her
  room, but she begs that you'll come up."</p>

  <p>In a voice that was full of curiosity and awe the girl, who was little
  more than a child, added in a hoarse whisper:</p>

  <p>"She saw you, sir, come up the path. We don't often get a visitor. Will
  you please to come up?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Delaunay was very doubtful about the tact, or even the propriety, of
  accepting this invitation. He had but seldom seen the clergyman's wife, and
  then always with a sensation of distaste. Besides, this visit, that seemed to
  have a clandestine air, might displease the vicar. But it was not in his
  good-natured heart to refuse the importunity of the child, who looked a
  rather forlorn figure with her flat bosom, her dark kerchief and her mob cap
  that was too large for her small head.</p>

  <p>"Very well, I will wait on your mistress with pleasure," he said, and
  followed the little maid up the winding and none too clean stairs, for his
  trained eye observed the dust on the wood that should have been clean and
  polished, the cobwebs that hung high up on the plastered walls.</p>

  <p>Martha Mist had prepared herself for this visitor. She was wrapped in a
  large white shawl of intricate design and had drawn over her untidy hair a
  large erection of old Malines lace and black watered ribbon. Her hands, which
  seemed to tremble with a perpetual ague, were encased in coarsely knitted
  mittens and her feet were raised on a beaded stool.</p>

  <p>As soon as the young man entered she motioned him, with a nervous gesture,
  to a rush-bottomed chair that stood near, sent the girl out of the room with
  a quick look and began without preamble:</p>

  <p>"Did you come here today to see my husband about Laura Sarelle?"</p>

  <p>"No, ma'am," replied Mr. Delaunay, wondering how she should have guessed
  at least something of the nature of his errand, but resolved to put no
  material in the hands of a woman who was probably loose-tongued and
  gossiping.</p>

  <p>"I'm disappointed at your lack of candour," returned Martha Mist shortly.
  "I'm quite sure that you did come because of that. Is she very ill, is my
  husband wanted up at Leppard Hall? is he to attend her?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, ma'am," replied the young man warmly, "nothing of the kind. I
  came to see your husband on a matter of my own, a little curiosity I had
  about some local history."</p>

  <p>"Well," replied the sick woman with a peevish look, "if you come to ask
  about the history of the Sarelles he won't satisfy you. Nathaniel will never
  tell you anything, nor will anyone in this place. It took me years to find
  out the little I know. When I first came here," she added regretfully, "I was
  able to get about. Before I had the paralysis. Of course, I found everyone as
  if their lips had been locked. And all the records destroyed too; even at
  Rugby and Warwick you couldn't find out anything."</p>

  <p>"What made you think," interrupted Lucius Delaunay, who was revolted at
  the prospect that his curiosity might be satisfied in this vulgar manner,
  "that there was anything to find out, madam?"</p>

  <p>"The tombs," said Madam Mist promptly. "The stone in the church. I said to
  myself the moment I saw it, it's the queerest thing in the world for there
  not to be any text or any inscription. You know," and she laughed
  unpleasantly, "the usual list of Christian virtues, the hope of the
  Resurrection and all the rest of it. But nothing&mdash;nothing at all. And
  then I went to the mausoleum, and I saw all the tombs of the Sarelles there
  and I wondered why she wasn't with them. And I found out that Sir Theodosius,
  who was buried there, was her twin. They were twenty-four years of age and
  she survived him six months only. You know the mausoleum? Too near the house
  I think."</p>

  <p>"It's an old story," said Lucius Delaunay, with an effort, "and I'm
  concerned, ma'am, with the living, not the dead."</p>

  <p>"Ah," replied Martha Mist shrewdly, "but the dead affect us, don't they?
  We can't forget them, we can't get away from them. What is the good of
  despising the past? Doesn't it colour everything we do in the present? You
  know it does, sir."</p>

  <p>"One's own past, perhaps," he admitted, thinking of many things that he
  would have wished undone, and many things that he rejoiced at in his own
  life.</p>

  <p>"The past of other people, too," persisted the old woman. "Those Sarelles,
  now, they can't come and live at Leppard Hall and try to ignore everything
  that happened before. Why did the father, the uncle and the grandfather stay
  away? Two wouldn't bring their wives here and the other had no wife to bring.
  I think Laura Sarelle's the first woman to live there since her namesake was
  carried out feet first, sixty years or so ago."</p>

  <p>"That's an unpleasant thought, ma'am," said the young man warmly. "Miss
  Laura doesn't realize that, I'm sure. She shouldn't be reminded of it."</p>

  <p>"She realizes something," insisted the clergyman's wife with spite and
  malice; "she was pulled out of the river, close by here, at the bottom of our
  garden where it abuts on the churchyard, yesterday."</p>

  <p>"I know. She was wearing thin, fancy shoes&mdash;she slipped and fell."
  Lucius Delaunay was angry with himself, angry with the woman; he felt he had
  been trapped into a disloyalty to the Sarelles, and in particular to
  Laura.</p>

  <p>But Nathaniel Mist's wife laughed on a harsh note.</p>

  <p>"She threw herself in, of course, poor fool! She's haunted. She came to
  see me once or twice. She explained her pains and tribulations. Of course, my
  mouth was closed, I wasn't going to be the one to start spreading anything.
  Let her, I thought, find out for herself."</p>

  <p>The woman went on talking in a loose, vindictive style, her head and her
  hands slightly shaking with the palsy that afflicted her. Lucius Delaunay was
  thinking hotly: 'So everyone will believe, and I suppose it is the truth.
  After she parted from me the poor girl did throw herself into the river. She
  ought to be taken away, and there's no one to rescue her but myself.'</p>

  <p>"I could tell you a few things about the Sarelles," the thin, acid voice
  of the vicar's wife penetrated his heated, hurrying thoughts; "perhaps you
  could make sense of them. I'm bedridden now, but if I could get about a bit I
  think I could find out some things."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing I wish to know, ma'am," said Mr. Delaunay. "I am
  delighted to find you in such excellent health. I will not intrude my company
  upon you any longer."</p>

  <p>And he was gone swiftly through the garden with the pinks, the budding
  roses, the stocks and wallflowers, while the little maid ran to the door and
  gaped after him, and Nathaniel Mist came heavily on his lumbering, gouty feet
  to the study window and stared after him, and the clergyman's wife dragged
  her wheeled chair along also to the window and drew aside the dimity curtains
  and gazed down as if he were an object of fearful curiosity.</p>

  <p>The steward skirted the churchyard, with its huddled, crowded
  lichen-covered graves where the humble folk lay neglected, grey and gold
  mosses obliterating their names and dates, and looked at the trodden weeds
  and trash on the slippery mud of the river bank where last night the sexton
  and the vicar's gardener had pulled Laura Sarelle in her draggled finery from
  the slow river.</p>

  <p>He was aware that the Mists were staring after him, from the quay
  parsonage, but he did not intend to be intimidated by what he felt to be
  their malicious curiosity.</p>

  <p>The dreams of the dead! He wished the vicar had not spoken those words,
  they had an ugly sound.</p>

  <p>He turned across the humped churchyard instead of going direct back to
  Leppard Hall and walked between the pollarded limes that formed an avenue
  from the river to the church. He had often glanced casually and with but a
  faint interest at the white marble mural tablet which the vicar's wife had
  called "the tombstone" of Laura Sarelle.</p>

  <p>Now Lucius Delaunay wanted to look at it again, with some distracted idea
  that it might afford some clue to the identity of the person whom it
  commemorated. There was a certain potency in the thought that her grave was
  so near the house where she had lived, it was but a short walk from the room
  where her portrait hung to the church where this tablet bore her name, the
  date of her birth and death and nothing more.</p>

  <p>Why had she not been buried in the mausoleum beside her twin brother?
  Perhaps by her own desire she lay in the cool, remote shadows of the church,
  not in that grey lonely charnel-house by the river bend.</p>

  <p>It was a small church, the atmosphere damp and musty, badly kept, too:
  there was dust on the faded cushions in the pews, the brass lectern was dim
  for lack of polish, the altar furnishings were shabby, cobwebs darkened the
  dirty glass of the cracked windows. Sir Theodosius, who attended the services
  as seldom as possible and would not have attended them at all had not decorum
  obliged him to do so, was not generous in his contributions towards its
  support, and the living was poor, while the people of Leppard village shared
  their pastor's slothful indifference towards religion as typified by the
  Anglican Church.</p>

  <p>Lucius Delaunay paused before the mural tablet. It was of fine white
  Italian marble and therefore had a ghastly whiteness in the dim greenish
  shadows and was for that reason livid and ugly. The name "Laura Sarelle", and
  the dates were well cut in graceful lettering and Lucius Delaunay observed
  what he had never noticed before: that underneath in low bas-relief were two
  boughs of laurel, the stems crossing, the leaves and berries pointing upwards
  around the name and date. Had Laura spoken of this and he forgotten?</p>

  <p>He supposed that this design was in the nature of a rebus, as was the
  branch of laurel that the lady held in her hand in the portrait, but the date
  was late for this mediaeval practice and did not seem to him to be, somehow,
  in the best of taste; why, he could not have told. But it seemed to him that
  they who were buried in Christian churches should have some Christian text to
  grace and sanctify their memorial, and this might well have been a heathen
  decoration.</p>

  <p>Lucius walked round the shabby, dim-lit church, trying to compose his
  thoughts and to strengthen his resolution, that had been taken while Madam
  Mist had been speaking to him. He was not a man to do anything hastily or
  impulsively. At twenty-eight years of age his character was formed and he had
  made up his mind on all the important questions that were likely to come his
  way. But neither was he a man to go back on something that had been decided
  in a moment of impulsive generosity, of ardent feeling, for his nature was
  both magnanimous and romantic.</p>

  <p>He glanced up at the funeral escutcheons of the Sarelles that hung above
  the short, thick Norman pillars. The elaborate coats-of-arms repeated in the
  various black-and-white lozenges, white on the right hand if it was a husband
  who lamented a wife, white on the left hand if it was a wife who lamented her
  husband. That of Laura Sarelle was all white and that of Theodosius, her
  brother, all black&mdash;unmarried, then, both of them. Beneath were the
  mottoes, written in heavy letters, and coming, as he thought, mockingly, in
  that place&mdash;"We live in one another."</p>

  <p>Like most of these old mottoes, it was so mutilated that it had no
  meaning, yet he knew that the Sarelles had borne it for generations with some
  pride and had even got a certain satisfaction out of the fact that it was in
  English, not, as usual, Latin.</p>

  <p>The Sarelle arms most familiar to Lucius, though not ostentatiously
  displayed at the Hall, appeared again and again in these hatchments quartered
  with those of heiresses whom the Sarelles had married, and that they had for
  a generation at a time used.</p>

  <p>These arms were unusual, and seemed now to the young man who studied them
  to have a melancholy significance: <i>qu. a fesse or, between three goshawks
  displayed, az. guttée du larmes.</i></p>

  <p>The knight's belt on the red shield, the three birds of prey, keen and
  cruel, and the azure tears dropping down.</p>

  <p>Lucius walked again round the church, so dusty and neglected; Sir Theo,
  for all his pride of family, had not even concerned himself to attend to the
  ancient Sarelle chantry, or the tombs of his armoured ancestors, with their
  pointed mail-clad feet resting on the stiff backs of the three goshawks, and
  the tears cut on the shields placed round the stone bases of the tombs.</p>

  <p>Grey with dust was the tilting helm, hung high over one of these tombs;
  all the Sarelles had been buried here until the early years of the eighteenth
  century, when a Sir Theodosius Sarelle, returning from Italy, had built on a
  classic model the grey mausoleum that had seemed so elegant and modish at the
  time, but which now seemed so gloomy and dreary.</p>

  <p>Lucius paused again before the funeral hatchment of Laura Sarelle where
  the quarterings showed dimly on the dingy white of the lozenge, and his
  anxious yet preoccupied glance traced the motto.</p>

  <p>"We live in one another." Idly, as men will when their thoughts are deeply
  troubled, he repeated the words; then the meaning came to him with a dismal
  shock. They might be interpreted as meaning that one generation would live on
  in another...yet how fantastic was the supposition that the dead Laura
  Sarelle might be haunting the living bearer of her name!...</p>

  <p>Lucius Delaunay quickly left the church. There were now no prying eyes at
  the vicarage, the curtains hung limp at the black windows, in the neglected
  garden the river wind was blowing the pinks, the stocks, the wallflowers.</p>

  <p>He averted his eyes from the trampled earth that showed where Laura had
  slipped into the river and been dragged out last night and hastened along the
  path set with lush thyme, parsley, and mint, where he had followed her in her
  pale-yellow gown, and went directly to Leppard Hall, and directly to the rich
  library where he hoped to find Sir Theodosius; and the young baronet was
  there in his usual chair. Dr. Selby had just left him, he was in an angry
  mood and he greeted his steward curtly, not rising.</p>

  <p>"I hope," he began at once, "you have reconsidered your decision, but you
  understand that now, in my present trouble, I cannot possibly dispense with
  your&mdash;" he seemed about to finish the phrase in a conventional way and
  say "services", but changed his mind ungraciously and added,
  "friendship."</p>

  <p>"I hope you will not have to dispense with my friendship, Theo," replied
  Lucius quietly. "But I have not changed my mind about leaving Leppard Hall.
  First, how is Laura's health?"</p>

  <p>"Laura is much restored; it was nothing but the prank of a foolish girl. I
  suppose she wanted to attract attention to herself, to become a melodramatic
  or romantical figure." Lucius Delaunay interrupted sternly.</p>

  <p>"You do not think, do you, Theo, that she threw herself in the river?"</p>

  <p>"Threw herself in! No, of course not! I think that she wetted her feet and
  her skirts and then set up an outcry to attract attention. Of course, you may
  be sure that before she put herself in the least danger she was quite aware
  that the sexton was in the graveyard and the gardener outside the
  vicarage."</p>

  <p>"I do not think she was," replied Lucius quietly. "I do not think she knew
  of anything that was about her. Besides, the dusk was falling, it would not
  have been very easy for her to see them, though they, on the height above,
  could easily have observed her. No, you can imagine the two men, grey like
  the tombstones and trees in their drab clothes, would not have been very
  noticeable, but she, in that extravagant pale dress&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about?" interrupted the baronet angrily. "It seems
  to me, Lucius, as if you, too, were infected by Laura's nonsense. Dr. Selby
  tells me that I'm liable to have a deal of trouble with her. She needs very
  firm handling. Of course, those clothes have been taken away from her. I've
  given orders to have all the things that were found in the great bedchamber
  destroyed. None of them was of any value, except a small miniature," he
  added, "which I shall send to London to be appraised."</p>

  <p>"You will not do much good by destroying those things, whether they were
  of value or not; the past has too strong a grip on Laura for you so easily to
  absolve her from its spell."</p>

  <p>"You're talking in a strange and, as I think, ridiculous manner, Lucius."
  Sir Theo sat in an exhausted attitude in his great chair, resting his elbow
  on his handsome desk, his thin face in his thin hands. "What have we to do
  with the past?"</p>

  <p>Lucius recalled the words of the vicar's wife; she was a foolish woman,
  but she had spoken the truth there, he knew.</p>

  <p>"You cannot get away from it, Theo, especially in an old place like
  Leppard Hall. You're living in those dead people's house, using their
  furniture, sleeping in their beds, with their portraits hanging on your
  walls. Everything you spend or have was theirs, or earned by them, or left by
  them. Their graves are only a few yards away, and there is some story about
  them that you very carefully conceal. That's a mistake, you know, Theodosius,
  you should bring it up into the daylight."</p>

  <p>"There's no story!" declared the baronet angrily, glancing up. "I've told
  you again and again, it is a small nucleus of unhappy facts only on which all
  this gossip is founded."</p>

  <p>"You never told me," returned Lucius swiftly, "that it was not a cousin of
  that first Laura Sarelle on whose body the inquest was held, but a
  brother."</p>

  <p>The young baronet rose at once; his face was blotched, his dry lips drawn
  back from his teeth. Lucius Delaunay was startled by the ugly transformation
  to raw passion so seldom seen on a human face.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, Theodosius!" he exclaimed, and the force of the
  exclamation caused the baronet to compose himself. He drew out his
  handkerchief and wiped his forehead. Then he got out, with a painfully
  obvious effort at control, these accusing words:</p>

  <p>"You have been spying. You've been going round among my people trying to
  find out things. I thought it was understood that nothing of this kind was to
  be done."</p>

  <p>"You seem to have made it fairly well understood," replied Lucius hotly.
  "Nobody will talk. That's what makes what is probably quite an ordinary story
  into something monstrous&mdash;the very silence of your tenantry, of the
  vicar and his wife, everyone whom one meets, gives this place a haunted air
  and ill repute. Why? If there was nothing to conceal everyone would be
  open."</p>

  <p>"When you came into my employment," said Sir Theodosius, with an ugly
  stress on the last word, "I think I warned you, Lucius, that I would have no
  talk about my family."</p>

  <p>"If you did, I forgot, I took the matter casually. I did not know then how
  it was going to affect me, or Laura."</p>

  <p>"You had better, sir, leave my sister Laura out of the conversation. You
  are taking, it seems to me, too deep an interest in her and her
  whimsies."</p>

  <p>"You'll understand my interest," replied Lucius Delaunay in a steadier
  tone, "when I tell you that I have come to ask you for her hand in
  marriage."</p>

  <p>If Sir Theodosius had looked livid before, he now turned a countenance
  that expressed nothing but evil on the young man who spoke, and Lucius,
  seeing and almost shrinking from that dark and ugly look, exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Don't speak, Theo, till you have thought a little! Don't say anything
  that I must resent."</p>

  <p>Sir Theodosius put his thin white hand over his eyes and Lucius saw the
  finger-tips press into the flesh of the cheeks. He wondered even at that
  moment why the young man was so deeply moved at what perhaps was a most
  unexpected and even an unwelcome proposal, but that could not, surely, be the
  cause of so much anger and discomfiture.</p>

  <p>He began, more to gain time and allow them both to control themselves than
  in the hope that his words would have any effect, to explain himself. His
  family was good, he was not a pauper, he had relations who would help him and
  many offers of employment; he did not believe that Laura cared much for
  luxury. He wished to marry her immediately and take her away from Leppard
  Hall, to Ireland, where his relatives&mdash;and there were many pleasant
  women among them&mdash;would cherish her and give her all that brightness and
  pleasure in her life that she had lacked.</p>

  <p>When he had finished it was plain that Sir Theodosius had again complete
  command of himself. He took his hand down from his eyes and said in a hard
  voice:</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know how much dowry she has?"</p>

  <p>"I do not, and I do not expect more than a reasonable sum that shall be
  settled on her, and her only, and spent on her, and her only, as a marriage
  portion. I'm well able to support my wife&mdash;yes, and my children
  also&mdash;in an honourable position."</p>

  <p>"You're talking great nonsense, Lucius. I am following out my father's
  plan with regard to Laura. She is to make a marriage that will increase the
  prestige of the family. I thought I had made that clear to you before. And
  she is not to marry at the age of nineteen years. I will not even think of
  such a thing until she is of age. You know that she is unable to contract a
  marriage without my consent, and I absolutely refuse it."</p>

  <p>"You are very sharp. I should have thought you knew me too well,
  Theodosius, to speak to me thus abruptly. Why should you use your sister so
  cruelly?"</p>

  <p>"And why should you dare, so suddenly and unexpectedly, to ask for her
  hand? How I have been deceived!" And again Sir Theodosius' passion almost
  escaped his control. "I've allowed you to see her without supervision, you
  have come freely into this house, and all the time behind my back you&mdash;a
  man many years older than she is&mdash;were insinuating yourself into her
  good graces, turning her romantical head."</p>

  <p>"No love passages whatever have passed between me and Laura," interrupted
  Lucius Delaunay firmly. "It is only lately that I have come to understand the
  deep regard in which I hold her."</p>

  <p>"Have you told her of that same regard?" sneered the baronet. "Have you
  persuaded her on some moonlit night to pledge some foolish schoolgirl vows to
  you?"</p>

  <p>Lucius Delaunay kept his temper. He had expected the interview to be an
  unpleasant one, though he had not been prepared for quite such insolence and
  violence on the part of Theodosius. He said quietly:</p>

  <p>"I tell you nothing has passed between me and Laura. She is, as you have
  reminded me, very young. I think she may come to care for me, I think I can
  make her happy. Better leave it at that. I have made my offer as you are her
  guardian, as again you have reminded me. You cannot control her heart or her
  feelings, and if you refuse her to me I would warn you that you keep her here
  at your peril."</p>

  <p>"My peril?" Theodosius repeated softly, and with a look, Delaunay thought,
  of fear.</p>

  <p>"I mean peril to your own conscience, for I think that she may become a
  very sick woman, perhaps a half-crazed woman, if you subject her to these
  influences that are at work here."</p>

  <p>"You are talking like someone who is crazed yourself," retorted the
  baronet hotly. "What influences? Are you going to pretend that you have seen
  spectres or phantoms, that you have heard ghosts shrieking?"</p>

  <p>"It is you who are talking nonsense," replied Lucius, with an air of
  contempt. "I thought that your mind was finer than that, Theo, your spirit
  more alert. What do you think is going on in this old house? You affect to
  despise the past, but what of those?"&mdash;he pointed to the books piled up
  on the floor and desk. "Do you not bury yourself in the past when you read
  your stoics? You will not tell me the story of your family, of your ancestor,
  you will not tell Laura. But she will find out, and then perhaps it will be
  the worse for both of you."</p>

  <p>"So you threaten me! You will leave the Hall, Lucius, never to enter it
  again. You will remove your property from the Dower House as quickly as you
  can, and while it is being removed you will take lodgings in Warwick or
  Rugby&mdash;or in Hell for all I care. You have proved a traitor to me;
  because I thought you sober and steadfast, because I thought you spent your
  leisure in learning instead of with drink or women, or games, or racing, I
  allowed you here. I picked you very carefully for this post, Lucius. I was
  not unmindful of the fact that I had a young and romantic sister."</p>

  <p>He rose and moved with a threatening step towards Lucius, and that young
  man, standing his ground, thought curiously: 'It is not so many years ago we
  should have fought a duel on this, and one, or perhaps both of us, would have
  been slain.'</p>

  <p>He tried to reason with the angry man.</p>

  <p>"Is there any need for this violence, Theodosius? I think I have served
  you well."</p>

  <p>"What monies I owe you," said the young baronet, "will be sent to your
  bankers. I wish to have no communication with you. And if I see you in the
  grounds of Leppard Hall my keepers will turn you off as if you were a
  vagabond."</p>

  <p>Lucius Delaunay smiled sadly.</p>

  <p>"You talk of Laura being romantical. You are ranting like a play-actor.
  Doing it, I think, to hide an uneasy conscience, Theodosius. Well, there is
  nothing for me to do but go. When Laura is of age and her own mistress
  perhaps I shall seek her acquaintance again."</p>

  <p>"I should have thought, sir, that if you had a sparkle of pride you would
  have been gone by now."</p>

  <p>"I have not so much pride but that I ask that I may say good-bye to Laura,
  and in your presence if you will. But I should beg that it might be in that
  of Mrs. Sylk only."</p>

  <p>"In the presence of no one! The girl is ill and I do not doubt that it is
  your insinuating tongue that has put all these childish notions into her
  head. You shall not see her! All her letters will be intercepted; if you try
  to write your epistles will fall into my hands."</p>

  <p>"All this," said Lucius Delaunay at the door, very pale, his lips pressed
  together between his speech and his eyes narrowed, "seems to me almost
  incredible. I never liked you very much, Theodosius, though I tried to
  persuade myself into the attitude of your friend. I tried to think of you
  even as a benefactor, but I did not realize, what is revealed now, the kind
  of man you are."</p>

  <p>The young baronet still standing by the desk gave him a glance of bitter
  hatred and contempt, and Lucius Delaunay left the room, closing the door
  softly behind him.</p>

  <p>For a moment he stood in the corridor, trying to control himself in order
  that he might behave both with dignity and prudence. He scarcely felt
  humiliated by the insults of one who was, in everything, his inferior, save
  in the detail of wealth, but he was bewildered, stung, as a man might be who
  has been struck suddenly by one whom he thought, if not his friend, at least
  just and honourable.</p>

  <p>Lucius had not hoped for much success from the interview, but he had
  supposed that Sir Theodosius might give some grudging consent to a continued
  friendship with Laura, that he might allow that, if no better suitor came
  along, she might one day marry Lucius Delaunay...Theo had never asked, that
  hard, narrow boy, how Laura's heart was set.</p>

  <p>'And how is it?' thought the young man, looking up the wide, shallow,
  silent staircase that led to the girl's room. Was it but the dewy vision of
  youth, but the fancy of her opening years, that made her turn to me
  yesterday? I hope it was no more, and yet indeed I have long felt, I belive
  now, as secretly towards her as perhaps she has long been drawn towards
  me.'</p>

  <p>Lucius raised his hand and let it fall. 'Alas! Dream or reality, it is
  over.'</p>

  <p>He was quite powerless. Sir Theodosius had the authority to turn him, as
  he had turned him, out of his house and estate like a dog. 'There'll be some
  talk, some scandal, especially coming on top of poor Laura's accident. I can
  best serve her by going quietly and with a casual air.'</p>

  <p>And he thought as he left the Hall that he would make up some tale of his
  relative in Ireland and a sudden call home, while some excuse must be given
  for his instant vacation of the Dower House and his residence in Warwick.</p>

  <p>When he reached the middle of the drive he looked back at Leppard Hall.
  The grey straight façade of the house seemed to him monstrous, as if it
  blotted out all the peace of the sky, all the tranquil beauty of the
  landscape. And yet, on a second look, there was neither beauty nor peace in
  either sky or landscape, all was veiled by a sullen and sinister mist; all
  was silent, yet, to the young man's excited imagination, full of expectancy,
  as if the stage were set for some ghastly drama.</p>

  <p>The past was indeed impinging upon the present, and across those parkland
  slopes he seemed to see moving forward the figures that had once played some
  dismal tragedy in this melancholy scene.</p>

  <p>What were they like&mdash;those twin brother and sister, that other
  Theodosius and Laura? Was the unknown portrait that had excited Laura
  Sarelle's intense dislike that of the former Sir Theodosius? Lucius Delaunay
  did not think so; there was no family likeness to his companion in that alert
  and vivid face. Besides, it was that of a man of at least thirty years of age
  and one who was robust, whereas that Theodosius Sarelle had died young and
  was of a sickly habit.</p>

  <p>Lucius Delaunay returned to the Dower House. He was perplexed and vexed;
  he was sorry that he had no better knowledge of human nature than to approach
  Sir Theodosius with a straightforward proposal for his sister's hand. It
  would have been better to have been a little crafty, to have waited, to have
  sounded the girl's mind and heart a little further, to have induced her
  brother to allow her to come to London and then to have an opportunity for
  her better acquaintance, and so to have won her over...He paused at this part
  of his reflections; there was no need to win her over. Had she not offered
  herself with sweet, half-unconscious surrender but yesterday? And he had put
  her by and allowed her to run from him, and in her despair and her melancholy
  loneliness she had cast herself into the river beneath the churchyard. It was
  because he had been aware of that that he had gone to her brother with his
  request.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for his honourable and open nature to have taken
  advantage of what was perhaps a passing, girlish caprice and to have married
  the heiress without her brother's consent. Besides, and here again he pulled
  himself up, he could not have married Laura without Theodosius' consent,
  since her brother was her legal guardian until she was twenty-one years of
  age.</p>

  <p>It would have been better, however, to have been cautious and prudent and
  to have waited, and begged Laura to wait too, since he was above the mean
  fear of being considered a fortune-hunter; he was quite prepared&mdash;and
  believed that Laura would be also&mdash;as he had assured the young baronet,
  to give up her dowry, save a small portion that for her own safety should be
  settled on herself. Yes, they should have waited, got to know each other
  better, consolidated, as it were, their affections, which, he believed, on
  his part would have bloomed into a deep love.</p>

  <p>Now his precipitate action had destroyed all those hopes, and he must
  either endeavour to beguile the girl into leaving her guardian and her home
  or abandon her to whatever dreary fate was in store.</p>

  <p>Lucius tried, as he put his few necessities together in his valise and
  told his manservant to saddle the horses, for they were riding into Warwick
  at once, to persuade himself that Laura would forget him. He knew how often
  young love vanished, quickly as the golden bloom on a butterfly's wing when
  June is past.</p>

  <p>'In two years' time,' he tried to console himself, 'when she has her
  freedom she will have forgotten me. And then, I suppose, perhaps this young
  fool will relent and allow her to go to London, or even Paris or Vienna. And
  there she'll meet suitors enough.'</p>

  <p>He wondered quite how much money she had, for he had never troubled to
  inquire. She had said something in the train that day they had come back from
  London&mdash;a hundred thousand pounds, he believed. He did not know if she
  had spoken the truth. Anyhow, it was clear that she was the heiress to a very
  considerable fortune and therefore would not lack pretenders to her hand. And
  she was lovely, in a strange and sad fashion&mdash;lovely.</p>

  <p>He wondered if Sir Theodosius himself would marry. It seemed unlikely. The
  black-browed young man was a born celibate. Who would he get now to help him
  with his books and estates? There would be candidates enough for both
  offices.</p>

  <p>In the twilight of that day Lucius Delaunay and his servant rode into
  Warwick and put up at the hostelry near the Castle&mdash;<i>the Bear and
  Ragged Staff</i>.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>That evening he waited on Dr. Selby, chancing by luck to find the
  physician at home, and without telling him any of his own circumstances asked
  him directly of the condition of Miss Laura Sarelle. The other looked at him
  queerly as if questioning his right to question him. He had no doubt, Lucius
  thought, heard something of the tale already. But he was a good-natured,
  just-minded man and did not seem disposed to be unduly loyal to the young
  baronet. He said that he thought the young lady had received some severe
  shock. She had, he thought, barely escaped a brain-fever. Oh, she was now out
  of danger; he had just returned from Leppard Hall. She had been given a
  strong sedative...</p>

  <p>Lucius interrupted: "Brain-fever?"</p>

  <p>"Well, she was raving last night. She had strong fits of delirium. She
  declared that a young girl, in every way like herself, was by her side,
  encouraging her to something dreadful&mdash;self-destruction, I suppose. She
  should, of course, be taken away from that old house. Why, I don't believe,"
  added Dr. Selby with emphasis, "they've changed a single piece of furniture
  since my grandfather's day. He was the physician who attended that other
  Laura Sarelle. But there is a story there, as I dare say you know, that's not
  to be told."</p>

  <p>"I'm going away," replied Lucius Delaunay heavily. "Perhaps it's better
  that I should know nothing. But if you think fit, tell me. If I can
  help&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Laura Sarelle?" interrupted the doctor shrewdly. "Is that, sir, what you
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But while she is under her brother's guardianship I feel
  powerless."</p>

  <p>"Is it impossible for you to remain in your employment?"</p>

  <p>"Quite impossible. Pray ask no more on that point."</p>

  <p>"Then, sir, if you must go away, I see no reason in telling you what I
  might chance to know of an old story."</p>

  <p>"I hope to renew my acquaintance with Miss Sarelle when she is
  free&mdash;of age."</p>

  <p>"Two years is a long time."</p>

  <p>"So I have thought," answered Lucius, raising his bright glance frankly.
  "Therefore I was inclined to leave&mdash;even without a question or a
  demur&mdash;yet I was anxious, too, and so could not forbear coming to
  you."</p>

  <p>Dr. Selby seemed gratified by this candour, but remained cautious; his
  family had had a long connection with Leppard Hall, but Miss Laura he had
  known for two years only, and he could scarcely undertake to pronounce upon
  his case. He thought that she enjoyed bodily health and had shown but little
  signs of nervous disturbances until she came to Leppard Hall, though he had
  heard that she had always been what her guardians termed wilful and
  passionate.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, like most young ladies, she had her fill of novels and
  romantic tales, and so was keen to know the story of that old house,
  especially as she soon discovered both the grave and the portrait of her
  namesake. Then," added the physician, labouring carefully at his explanation,
  "there was the atmosphere of the house, nothing changed for two generations
  or more, save in the smallest details; the great chamber, as they call the
  marriage-room on the first floor, locked up, with that chest of clothes
  within&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She should never have been exposed to this," said Lucius Delaunay
  sternly.</p>

  <p>"Yet you must allow, sir, that she made a good deal about very little. The
  principal bedchambers, as you well know, of these fine mansions are never
  used save on the marriage of the master, and it is common enough to preserve
  old portraits and old costumes."</p>

  <p>Yes, so it seemed now to Lucius Delaunay when he looked round the
  comfortable room of the country doctor, with the beaupots of tulips and
  daisies, the shining furniture, the well-swept hearth, the prints of English
  worthies on the panelled walls&mdash;common enough&mdash;yet there was
  something behind that was not so common.</p>

  <p>"Why should all this have so wrought on Miss Sarelle?" he asked
  gravely.</p>

  <p>Dr. Selby glanced at him quizzically and did not remind him that he had
  agreed, obliquely at least, to leave Warwickshire with the story of the
  Sarelles untold.</p>

  <p>"She was lonely, Mr. Delaunay, melancholy at being in the country, she
  began to dream&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To dream&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;when she first came here. Mrs. Sylk consulted me about that.
  One can understand how her state of mind came about&mdash;until some
  shock"&mdash;he paused deliberately&mdash;"sent her headlong on an attempt to
  escape, from I scarcely know what, some destiny that she fears. Of course it
  is all fanciful and this illness may be the end of it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>While Dr. Selby was speaking, Lucius Delaunay was considering, most
  earnestly, if Laura had indeed made the attempt on her life for this reason
  or because she believed that he had repulsed the passionate affection she had
  been surprised into offering him&mdash;surprised by the news of his
  departure. Or was Sir Theodosius correct&mdash;that Laura had but made the
  petulant gesture of a romantic girl, chagrined and disappointed, intending to
  do no more than "wet her feet"?</p>

  <p>Dr. Selby had been closely absorbing the young man's handsome, clouded
  face.</p>

  <p>"I don't deny," he added, "that they are odd people&mdash;Sir Theodosius
  will become very eccentric if he don't change his way of life, and Miss Laura
  will always be excitable."</p>

  <p>'Is he trying to tell me,' thought Lucius, 'that there is insanity in the
  family? The last baronet was a recluse and little is known of him&mdash;or of
  this Yorkshire branch.'</p>

  <p>Aloud he said:</p>

  <p>"I can do nothing. Try to persuade Sir Theo to let his sister go away. As
  for this old story&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't make too much of that," advised Dr. Selby. "It is very obscure and
  should not be given much importance. Once Miss Laura leaves the place she
  will forget all about it, I do not doubt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>'And forget me also, I suppose,' thought Lucius Delaunay. 'I'm infected by
  her fanciful follies to think otherwise.'</p>

  <p>He left, with many compliments, the courteous physician and returned to
  the <i>Bear and Ragged Staff</i>. As he went into the parlour to speak to his
  manservant he noticed, what he had noticed before on his visits to the old
  inn, a heavy gold-handled riding-crop in a glass case over the long
  mantelpiece. It had always been as indifferent to him as were the stuffed
  birds and fishes that cumbered the walls; he had vaguely supposed that the
  trophy had belonged to some notable Nimrod, now he glanced at it with a
  sudden heightened, almost sharp interest. But quickly, like one conscious of
  a folly, he put it out of his mind, and addressed himself to the business in
  hand, that of his removal from the Dower House and the neighbourhood of Laura
  Sarelle.</p>

  <h2>PART TWO</h2>

  <p class="first">SIR THEODOSIUS SARELLE, with the air of a reserved man who
  tries to be fluent upon an important matter, explained the situation to Mr.
  Spryce.</p>

  <p>The lawyer listened with some diffidence. He was aware that there was an
  attempt on the young baronet's part to persuade him to conclusions of which
  he did not, and could not, altogether approve. At the same time he knew that
  he was powerless to offer anything but advice, and also aware that this same
  advice was likely to be very ill received.</p>

  <p>So he sat silent in his dingy, drab Lincoln's Inn office, his fat hands
  spread out upon his fat knees and his dim spectacled eyes fixed firmly upon
  the pale square of the window.</p>

  <p>It was a windy day in October, and Mr. Spryce seemed to be counting
  mechanically the bright gold and tarnished brown of the motionless leaves of
  the trees in the Square, that appeared to be painted on a pale-blue sky.</p>

  <p>"I intend," the baronet was saying, "to accept the offer." And as if weary
  of his own long and pedantic discourse in which he had striven to make his
  position and his difficulties clear to the lawyer and to satisfy his own
  conscience, he added impatiently: "Laura has been an intolerable burden for
  the last eighteen months. I must, somehow, make a settlement for her."</p>

  <p>"It will not be so very long," the lawyer suggested, "before she is of age
  and may take her affairs into her own hands."</p>

  <p>Sir Theodosius made a gesture of contempt.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that another six months is going to make any difference to
  Laura's character? She will be exactly the same&mdash;moody, whimsical,
  impossible. Pray do not suppose," he continued, in quick self-defence, "that
  I have been in any way unreasonable. When Selby suggested that she should
  have a change of air, that she should leave Leppard Hall&mdash;well, I
  allowed her to do so. She and Mrs. Sylk went to London and to Cheltenham. I
  looked up such friends and relatives as we had and begged them to entertain
  her. But nothing was of any use. In confidence, you know what it is that ails
  her&mdash;a lovesick fancy for that Irish adventurer."</p>

  <p>"So you told me before, Sir Theodosius," replied the lawyer dryly, not
  altogether caring for this description of Lucius Delaunay, whom he had highly
  regarded, and he added: "They have not seen each other, I suppose? Mr.
  Delaunay is still in Ireland?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Sir Theodosius, with a violence unusual to his quiet
  self-control; "and may he stay there, and rot there."</p>

  <p>"I thought, sir, he was once a friend of yours?"</p>

  <p>"He played the traitor in my establishment. He is to blame for Laura's
  state of mind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Spryce interrupted.</p>

  <p>"That may or may not be so, Sir Theodosius. You remember that before she
  met Mr. Delaunay, when she was a schoolgirl, there were these same complaints
  about her wilful disposition. Well, you were informing me that you had
  accepted Mr. Harry Mostyn's proposal for her hand and that she is agreeable,
  and the wedding is to be fixed for an early date."</p>

  <p>"That is what I came to tell you." A touch of uneasiness was noticeable,
  the lawyer observed, in the baronet's manner. He seemed not altogether
  pleased with his own decision, but rather as if it were one into which he had
  been forced against his will. "I like Mostyn, there's nothing against him,
  and a good deal for him."</p>

  <p>"What, precisely, are his merits? Since you ask my advice, I must have all
  the details of the situation before I can give it." Mr. Spryce smiled in an
  attempt at geniality. He did not like Sir Theodosius, but he wished to keep
  on good terms with him; the lawyer was, deep under his professional
  callousness, fond of Laura Sarelle and sorry for her, and his wife,
  unimaginative and dull little woman as she was, had often pointed out to him
  with some warmth the unenviable situation in which the orphan girl stood with
  so grim and precocious a brother as a guardian.</p>

  <p>"Mostyn's advantages," replied the baronet, who seemed glad to relate them
  for his own sake as well as for that of his hearer, "are, as I think I
  mentioned, that he's a connection of mine&mdash;a second cousin of my
  mother's. And he is willing, when he marries Laura, to take the name and arms
  by royal licence."</p>

  <p>"Surely it is rather impulsive of you to rule out all question of a
  marriage for yourself, Sir Theodosius?"</p>

  <p>"If I do marry, and it is not likely, then of course Mostyn can retain his
  own name if he wishes. But I have consulted several physicians lately, whose
  names would be well known to you," added the baronet with acid grimness, "and
  my health is not good. Neither does family life appeal to me. I have, I
  suppose, the temperament of a scholar and a recluse. All I ask for is what I
  have not yet been able to obtain&mdash;tranquillity."</p>

  <p>"And you think, sir, you will obtain it by this marriage of your sister
  Laura with Harry Mostyn?"</p>

  <p>"I think so. She seems very amenable, she's agreed to everything. As I
  say, he will assume the name, and he will take over Leppard Hall and the
  estates. He will undertake not to change anything."</p>

  <p>"The family of Mostyn is known in Jamaica?" asked Mr. Spryce
  cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they had a large estate there, the neighbouring penn to my father's.
  That is how the families became acquainted. It is a well-known name
  there&mdash;a Mostyn was a governor about sixty years ago. And they made a
  big fortune out of sugar."</p>

  <p>"Invested wisely, I hope?" commented the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, Mostyn puts up a good appearance. He's hired a handsome house
  near Hyde Park. I think he'll sell out in Jamaica now, as we did, and settle
  down over here."</p>

  <p>"Won't he buy an estate of his own, or does he intend to absorb himself
  entirely in that of Miss Laura?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, the last, entirely! And that's what pleases me."</p>

  <p>The lawyer was silent, considering this, to him, peculiar exhibition of
  family pride.</p>

  <p>"Well, you area young man, Sir Theodosius, and this question of Laura's
  inheriting your estate and of her intended future husband's taking your name
  must be a question of the far-distant future."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," interrupted the baronet with great irritability. "I've told
  you my life is not a good one, my lungs are not strong."</p>

  <p>"Then surely you should not live in that waterlogged house close to the
  river, infected as it is with mists."</p>

  <p>Mr. Spryce spoke with some feeling. He had never enjoyed his visits to
  Leppard Hall, which seemed even to his prosaic eye a gloomy and haunted
  place. He detested the flat landscape with the water-meadows and frequent
  vapours.</p>

  <p>Sir Theodosius waved this protest aside with the impatient gesture common
  to him, a quick lift of his thin hand.</p>

  <p>"The Sarelles are bound up with Leppard Hall. That's part of my
  heritage&mdash;to live there. Besides, the country there suits me well
  enough."</p>

  <p>"Miss Laura won't return there immediately, I suppose?" suggested Mr.
  Spryce. "No doubt," he added, making a bold stroke for the sake of the girl,
  "Mr. Mostyn will take her to Jamaica? It will be a good change for her, she'd
  enjoy the light, the sunshine. Childhood memories would come back, no doubt.
  She was born there, after all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nothing is decided," said the baronet with considerable irritation, "and
  of course the marriage won't take place until she's twenty-one years of age.
  And, God knows, she won't be fit for matrimony then, wild and wilful as she
  is But Mostyn will keep a firm hand on her, I think, and at least the burden
  of it will be off my mind. Yes, he may take her to Jamaica, I don't
  know."</p>

  <p>"You'll be glad, perhaps, to have Leppard Hall to yourself, but you must
  give the girl an establishment. Mostyn, you say, sir, has only a hired house
  in London?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I could buy her a town mansion, or a property somewhere else, what
  does it matter? Leppard Hall will be her home eventually. How many times must
  I tell you, Spryce, that I don't look to make a long life?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer hunched his thick shoulders in the ill-fitting black coat.</p>

  <p>"I think you've got something, Sir Theodosius, of your sister's
  wilfulness." And he thought very cautiously, for even in his mind he was
  prudent: 'I wonder&mdash;I wonder if there's a touch of insanity in the
  family?' Then aloud he said: "I suppose this young man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not so young," interrupted the baronet. "Mostyn is thirty-eight."</p>

  <p>Mr. Spryce expressed no surprise. No doubt a staid husband would be very
  suitable for a young lady of Miss Laura's volatile temperament. Perhaps, too,
  she was very fond of the fellow. Mr. Spryce had not seen him, but had heard
  him described by common acquaintances as polished and charming.</p>

  <p>"He was married, you know," continued the baronet. "His wife, a Dorothy
  Weston, died of yellow fever in Jamaica, together with two of their children.
  The shock made a wanderer of him for years. I'd really almost forgotten about
  him, but, searching in my mind for someone to divert Laura after that serious
  illness she had eighteen months ago, I remembered him. I wrote to his bankers
  and found he was in London and begged him to call on Laura and Mrs. Sylk. And
  so it's come about that he's made me the offer."</p>

  <p>"And Miss Laura's pleased, you say? Well, it all seems a very agreeable
  sort of arrangement."</p>

  <p>"She's as pleased as she ever is about anything. There is no satisfying
  the girl. When she is at Leppard Hall she is gloomy and, like one distraught.
  When she is in London she is sullen and refuses to go anywhere."</p>

  <p>"That girlish caprice of hers, as you call it, that early affection,"
  suggested the lawyer cautiously, "perhaps goes deeper than you suppose, sir.
  I thought Mr. Delaunay a very amiable and accomplished young gentleman, I
  hardly understood your strong objections to that match. It seems to me he
  might have suited you as well as this Mr. Mostyn; in age at least he is more
  suitable to Miss Laura."</p>

  <p>"Delaunay, I tell you," replied the young man with a distorted look on his
  regular features, "played the traitor. No man could forgive that. He made
  suit to my sister behind my back while pretending to be my friend. He is much
  older than she&mdash;although nearer her age than Mostyn, as you
  say&mdash;and far more experienced, and it was quite easy for him to turn her
  head. I believe all those foolish notions she had about Leppard Hall..." he
  seemed to change what he was about to say, and, after a pause, added
  abruptly, "came from him."</p>

  <p>"I do not think it's likely," declared Mr. Spryce, defending the young
  man. "I saw a good deal of him, you know, sir. He used to come to town about
  your business. I thought him very capable and conscientious."</p>

  <p>"He was that," the baronet admitted, with a shade of regret clouding his
  pale face. "My present man, Erskine, is able enough, but not so efficient as
  Delaunay, I admit that. I have given him notice to leave. I shall try to
  manage the estate myself with the help of an accountant who will come in from
  Warwick once a week."</p>

  <p>"And you have no secretary either, Sir Theodosius. It must be more lonely
  than ever before at Leppard Hall."</p>

  <p>"No, I do not mind seclusion, and when I am in a difficulty with my
  translation I come up to London and consult some of my learned friends."</p>

  <p>The baronet rose impatiently and coughed as if the least movement shook
  him. Mr. Spryce, in view of what he had just said about his health, regarded
  him quickly and observed that he did look lean and hollow-chested. His cheeks
  seemed to have fallen in and his eyes were feverishly bright. 'He leads such
  an unhealthy life,' thought the lawyer, 'always poring over those books in
  that damp house. Why does he do it, especially when he knows he's delicate?
  It's as if he wished to commit suicide.'</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he asked aloud, rising also, "Mr. Delaunay has not tried to
  write to Miss Laura or to see her? If he had, that might account for her
  moods."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," said Mr. Theodosius, with a vindictive look. "I have
  her most carefully watched. I can now rely upon Mrs. Sylk. At first she tried
  to play the traitress too, as these foolish women do. She actually went over
  to Warwick to try and find Delaunay before he left under the excuse of a
  visit to a shop or the dentist or some such stupid lie. But he had gone, and
  one of the maids told me what Mrs. Sylk was trying to do. I spoke to her
  sternly and threatened her with dismissal. I think I gave her a fright, she
  has not tried any tricks since."</p>

  <p>'You are a born tyrant,' thought Mr. Spryce judiciously, 'that is what you
  are, young man&mdash;a born tyrant!' He said aloud: "Well, Delaunay's still
  in Ireland, I know. He's in employment on his uncle's estate in Antrim.
  Anyhow, he's not our concern. But this Mostyn&mdash;do you wish me to make
  any inquiries about him? I might find out more, perhaps, than he's told
  you."</p>

  <p>This suggestion seemed to anger the baronet. He replied haughtily that he
  could take Harry Mostyn's word on all points concerning himself. It would be
  insulting to have a gentleman of his position investigated as if he were a
  servant applying for a place. His family was well known, if not in London, at
  least in Jamaica. "He is," and this seemed to the baronet quite sufficient in
  the way of credentials, "a connection of my own."</p>

  <p>There was no more for Mr. Spryce to say on this point.</p>

  <p>"Well," said he, "tell me when I am to draw up the marriage settlement. I
  shall be ready. Do you wish to add to the hundred thousand pounds that is to
  be Miss Laura's dowry under the provisions of your father's will?"</p>

  <p>Sir Theodosius replied shortly that as his sister would have everything on
  his death, and he added grimly that he was heavily insured as well as being a
  very wealthy man, there was no need for her to have more than the stipulated
  sum when she married.</p>

  <p>"It is more a home she needs than money," remarked the lawyer, and he
  thought that it was an odd combination of circumstances that the girl who had
  neither father nor mother nor any guardian but this brother, nor any home but
  that at Leppard Hall, so isolated and dull, should be marrying a man who
  seemed also as solitary, whose home and relations were far away, and had few,
  if any connections in London. He wished for Miss Laura's sake that he knew
  more about Harry Mostyn; how the man had spent his years as a widower, what
  was his reputation in the cities he had frequented, for Sir Theodosius had
  said that he had travelled in France and Italy.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," Mr. Spryce added sharply, "that Mr. Mostyn will make
  settlements on his side?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, with everything he possesses," the baronet replied. He
  frowned, coughed again, and seemed troubled.</p>

  <p>There was one more point, a delicate one, to be broached. Mr. Spryce
  thought that perhaps it was this subject that was troubling Sir Theodosius,
  therefore he, in his professional capacity, took the onus on his own capable
  shoulders and asked coolly:</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Mostyn to be told anything of the family history?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever," replied the young man, with barely suppressed
  violence. "Why should he be? What has our history to do with him? Besides, I
  scarcely know to what you refer."</p>

  <p>"You've driven it so far to the back of your own mind that you believe
  you've forgotten it, I suppose, Sir Theodosius. But it's there, you know, and
  I believe it does affect your sister."</p>

  <p>"My God, Spryce, I should have thought you were the last man in the world
  to be fanciful!"</p>

  <p>"It's not fancy. Dr. Selby must have told you as much, you must have
  believed as much yourself, Sir Theodosius, or you would never have allowed
  her to leave Leppard Hall. I remember how resolute you were that she should
  stay there and learn all the duties of a country châtelaine."</p>

  <p>"We'll not argue the point. The past is the past, it does not concern us
  now."</p>

  <p>"Never was anything more foolish said." Mr. Spryce repeated almost the
  words that Sir Theodosius remembered Lucius Delaunay had spoken to him
  eighteen months ago in the study at Leppard Hall. "The past colours, lightens
  or darkens everything we do or are, everything we say and have. I should
  think that that ugly episode of sixty years ago had better be brought out in
  daylight now, Sir Theodosius."</p>

  <p>"Don't you realize that it might be the means of breaking off my sister's
  marriage?"</p>

  <p>"Ah! You think that!" said Mr. Spryce. He had never heard Sir Theodosius
  give so much importance to the secret history of the Sarelles before. "Well,
  then, in that case, what will his feelings be if he discovers it after he
  marries her?"</p>

  <p>"Then he will be a member of the family," replied Sir Theodosius, "and
  have as much concern as I in keeping silent about old and foolish
  stories."</p>

  <p>With that he took up his hat with a quick gesture before the lawyer had
  time to say anything else, and left the room, proceeding at once through the
  dry, airless streets, for the sea, son was unusually hot, to the tall brick
  house in Queen Street where Mrs. Sylk and a well-selected establishment of
  domestics kept watch over Laura Sarelle.</p>

  <p>The girl was in the drawing-room, sitting listlessly in front of a
  pianoforte. On the music-screen was propped a pale water-colour drawing that
  she was touching up with a languid hand.</p>

  <p>When Sir Theodosius entered the room his glance went at once to this
  picture. He saw that it was an attempted likeness of the portrait that hung
  at Leppard Hall, that of her namesake in the primrose-coloured dress, holding
  the sprig of laurel leaves. The sight filled him with anger and distaste, but
  he judged it prudent to make no comment on this subject.</p>

  <p>But he began to tell the sullen girl, who took little notice of what he
  said, of his interview with Mr. Spryce, and he gave a false impression of the
  lawyer's acquiescence in the marriage scheme by saying:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Spryce thoroughly approves of Mr. Mostyn and of the suggested
  alliance. He thinks it in every way suitable, Laura. I value his approval
  since he is one of the few people left who were our father's friends, who
  knew his wishes. He thinks that this match would in every way have pleased
  him."</p>

  <p>"What does any of that matter?" asked Laura. She swung round on the
  revolving music-stool. "When am I going to Jamaica?"</p>

  <p>"You talk like a fool!" cried Sir Theodosius, losing his temper at this
  stupid remark. "You cannot go to Jamaica until you are married, and I do not
  intend you shall be married until you're twenty-one. Besides, I do not know
  what Mostyn's plans are. I think he wants to settle in England."</p>

  <p>"I dislike England," sighed Laura, narrowing her eyes. "Still, if we are
  to live here we must have a house."</p>

  <p>"Why, so Spryce said," declared Sir Theodosius, further irritated. "A
  house will be found for you. The means are not lacking. But what is more
  important, my dear girl, is that you should decide on a settled way of life
  and leave this idleness, this sickly mooning. What are you doing now, for
  instance? You sit down there as if you were going to play on the pianoforte,
  and then you start scribbling a ridiculous picture. You are lucky," he added,
  the words struck out of him because of the intense vexation he had felt at
  seeing the portrait, "that you have found so good a husband, for I assure
  you, Laura, that you are not the kind of woman that most men would choose for
  a wife."</p>

  <p>"Harry is marrying me for my fortune," sneered Laura. "Don't you know
  that? He is something of an adventurer. I think he's in difficulties, too,
  debts&mdash;I believe the estate in Jamaica's encumbered. Have not you
  troubled to find out? But what does it matter, he seems to have a great
  influence over you. He flatters you. Strange, that he can do anything he
  likes with you and you couldn't even be civil to&mdash;" She would not speak
  that name in his presence, but turned away again and with a brush dipped in
  green paint outlined more darkly the laurel leaves in her sketch.</p>

  <p>Theodosius controlled himself with difficulty.</p>

  <p>Laura was capable of exasperating him into a scene that had a very ill
  effect upon his health, and his physicians had warned him that he should
  remain, at all costs, cool. He could endure the girl's insolence only by
  reminding himself that she would soon be off his hands. He had put up with a
  great deal from her since the illness that had followed her accident when she
  had fallen into the Avon by the churchyard, endured her moods, her whims, her
  sullenness, her refusal to be entertained, to take any interest in such
  society as he allowed her to frequent. Her constant plea, her one urgency,
  had seemed to her to be allowed to get away from Leppard Hall, and after a
  struggle of several months he had allowed that, even hired a house for her in
  Cheltenham, and then this establishment in London.</p>

  <p>But she had seemed just as dissatisfied, just as capricious. Had she not
  proved such a torment her brother would not so easily have allowed her to
  engage herself to Harry Mostyn; Sir Theodosius had had far larger ideas for
  his sister, a title, a big estate, a man in a fine position. When he had
  spoken to Mr. Spryce he had made the very most of Harry Mostyn's
  qualifications in order to justify his own consent to the match, but of
  course, when Laura spoke of the man as an adventurer, and said he only wanted
  her money, she was talking at random, as usual. Sir Theodosius had assured
  himself of the sound position in which his sister's suitor stood. And he was
  gratified by Mostyn's instant agreement to take the name of Sarelle and to
  carry on the estates at Leppard Hall. The entail would end with himself and
  it would be in the power of Laura's husband to sell the place and allow it to
  pass into other hands, and this, to the intense family pride of Theodosius
  that he had fed through many morose, solitary hours of introspection, was
  intolerable, so Mostyn's promise to bind himself to carry on the name and to
  keep the place was most important to him.</p>

  <p>But he could not bring himself to say the kind or soothing words that
  might have touched or pleased his sister, or to explain to her his reasons
  for wanting this match. Instead, he replied curtly:</p>

  <p>"Your behaviour is altogether repulsive, Laura. You agreed quite readily
  to marry Harry Mostyn. How, then, dare you speak of him as an
  adventurer?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, there are worse things in the world than being an adventurer," smiled
  Laura. "I like him well enough. He is kind, and agreeable, and he is going to
  take me away. That is the great attraction, is it not?"</p>

  <p>"He and I and Mr. Spryce will arrange your future," said the baronet,
  coughing and sinking into the armchair by the fire, where a few logs were
  burning into ashes. The autumn day was clear and warm, but Sir Theodosius was
  always chilly, and a fire had been lit, not for the first time that year, to
  please him. "You know that my lease of this house ends with this month. In
  November you must come to Leppard Hall. I shall ask Harry, too. Erskine is
  leaving, and Harry can take his place for a while&mdash;he's agreed to
  this&mdash;and learn something about the estate."</p>

  <p>Laura sprang from the music-stool, swept to the centre of the room and
  stood there with her hands clasped tightly behind her back.</p>

  <p>"I will not go!" she cried. "I will not return to Leppard Hall!"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, my dear girl!" Sir Theodosius pressed his handkerchief to his
  lips and tried to speak coolly. "You've been in London since the spring,
  right through the summer, that agreeable weather when you should have been in
  the country, on one excuse or another&mdash;now you are returning."</p>

  <p>"Returning in the winter when the days are short and there is always
  mist&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't, pray, be romantic and poetical," interrupted Sir Theodosius. "The
  Hall is extremely comfortable and well-run. You may go, when you please, into
  Warwick or Rugby. You may even come up to town again for Christmas. But I
  don't intend to go on paying the expense of this house, this establishment,
  for you to sit idling on a music-stool, scribbling. Oh, I have a full report
  from Mrs. Sylk of your behaviour. How you lie abed and refuse to see company,
  and when you escape from the house you take long walks by yourself."</p>

  <p>"Does Mrs. Sylk betray me like that?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, Mrs. Sylk is your very staunch ally, but she can't refuse to answer
  yes or no when I put questions to her. And I've a very shrewd idea, my dear
  sister, how you employ your time. I know that you often refuse to see Mostyn
  when he calls to take you to a concert or the theatre or the opera. You're
  going to marry him and spend the rest of your life with him, therefore you
  must get to know him better. At Leppard Hall you won't be able to escape his
  company."</p>

  <p>Sir Theodosius spoke harshly, and the girl gazed with malice, with eyes
  expressing fury. He saw that expression and winced, as one human being will
  wince from hatred in the eyes of another; it is as rare a passion as love,
  and as powerful.</p>

  <p>He turned away sharply, more moved than he liked to show, and gazed into
  the glowing embers that were becoming quenched into grey ashes, while Laura
  remained erect in the centre of the correct room furnished coldly according
  to the taste of the upholsterer.</p>

  <p>Her one interest and extravagance since her brother had allowed her this
  amount of liberty had been clothes. She wore now a charming gown of a lilac
  silk with a sarsanet jacket laced with green ribbon, and looked even to her
  brother's prejudiced eyes a lovely woman. She was so slender and finely
  formed and her hair had such a rich bloom on it, though her face was of an
  unhealthy pallor, and without the artificial red on lips and cheeks she might
  have appeared ghastly. Her eyes were very luminous and a little blurred as if
  she had been weeping. The hands that she twisted nervously behind her back
  were of extreme delicacy; so was the arched foot that she tapped on the thick
  carpet.</p>

  <p>A pretty creature! A splendid creature! A girl who had an air of breed and
  nobility, a sister that he should have been proud of, yet a plague and a
  vexation, and, horrible to realize, a creature who hated him Sir Theodosius
  did not believe that he had given her any just cause for that hatred. She had
  always been a burden to him, even as a child, when she had been at school in
  London and he a youth at Oxford who had been obliged to come up to the
  capital now and then at his father's or his guardian's request, to visit her,
  to take her out, to supervise her education.</p>

  <p>She was so different from himself that she reminded him of that page in
  the family history which he most wished to forget. It had been unfortunate,
  he thought, that she had ever been born. Yet if she had never been born he
  would have been forced to marry in the hope of begetting an heir for fear the
  name of Sarelle should become extinct. For after these two there were none of
  that name in the whole world, and it would be an end of that family. How
  useless, then, would seem all the money that he and his father had hoarded up
  if it was not used to extend the grandeur of the Sarelle family!</p>

  <p>Sir Theodosius, looking at his sister as she stood there, softened a
  little towards her, realizing that she had her uses. He might enjoy the kind
  of life he wished, as a scholarly recluse, a celibate, and she would marry
  and bear the children who would carry on the name, and who would in time
  inherit all his treasure. And if Laura had no children&mdash;his mind darted
  ahead into the future&mdash;why, then to whom should he leave all his wealth?
  To his old college at Oxford, he thought, and only the bare bones of the
  estate for the next-of-kin, some distant cousins of his father's by the name
  of Conway whom he had only met rarely on the most formal occasions, in his
  boyhood, and who were now in India. Since the estate was not entailed he
  would probably decide that it should all go to the hammer and nothing be left
  at all to those distant relatives, who cared nothing for the name of
  Sarelle.</p>

  <p>The young man drew himself up with a start, realizing how, as he gazed at
  the immobile figure of Laura Sarelle, his mind had wandered from the point at
  issue. What need was there to concern himself about these things? She would
  marry and have children and their name would be continued.</p>

  <p>He rose abruptly, for he did not lodge in this house that he had hired for
  her, but in a suite in the Golden Lion, a hotel off the Strand, and told her
  to make all her preparations, for by the end of the month she should be in
  Leppard Hall.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for lighting the fire for me, Laura&mdash;I fear the room is
  oppressive now."</p>

  <p>He tried to leave her on this courteous note, but she lifted her lip
  daintily at him in silence.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Laura Sarelle glided into Mrs. Sylk's room that night, when that good
  woman had put out her candle and drawn her bed-curtains, making her start as
  if a ghost had suddenly entered, for the girl had bare feet, a light wrap
  thrown over her shoulders, and Hetty Sylk had left the shutters of the window
  apart so that a beam of moonlight fell through, which revealed the girl's
  figure.</p>

  <p>"How easily you are frightened!" said Laura contemptuously. She found the
  matches and lit the candle in the silver stick, then closing the shutter,
  added, "It is cold, but I want to talk to you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Laura, you're wild and wilful as usual. You have no slippers on and
  that cashmere shawl is not warm enough."</p>

  <p>"What does it matter? I want to tell you something. Theo was here to-day,
  as you know, but later than we expected him. We are to return to Leppard
  Hall."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk rose out of bed and put on her own dressing-gown. She was very
  willing to humour the girl. She wished that it were possible for her to light
  a fire, but there were no sticks or coal in the grate, so she drew the blue
  woollen coverlet off the bed and threw it round the girl's shoulders and the
  two of them sat down together in the great tapestry chair with arms.</p>

  <p>"Well, dear, you knew that you'd have to go back some day, and I suppose
  it won't be for long. You'll be married in another six months."</p>

  <p>Hetty Sylk spoke with great uneasiness, she had no faith nor hope in any
  of these schemes. She hurried on:</p>

  <p>"And I think Sir Theo has striven to humour you. He has allowed you to
  have this house and go to Cheltenham."</p>

  <p>"Humour me! He broke my heart! Don't you know that, Mrs. Sylk?" and the
  girl turned her large blurred eyes towards the older woman. "When he sent
  Lucius away, that broke my heart!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's a phrase merely, dear," replied Mrs. Sylk with still greater
  uneasiness. She tried to speak in a caressing tone. "People don't get their
  hearts broken, though they think they do&mdash;women especially. But you'll
  grow out of it."</p>

  <p>"I know all that you're going to tell me, the same as Theo said, and what
  you told me when I was ill&mdash;that it was just a fancy, my love; that
  girls felt like that for any young man who was well in his person and
  happened to be about them. But it is not like that with Lucius and me, you
  know it is not. Why did he separate us? What is there Harry has that Lucius
  has not?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't tell you, dear. I suppose they quarrelled. And men, when they
  take a spite against one another, are cold and unbending. I think Mr.
  Delaunay made a mistake in speaking to your brother."</p>

  <p>"Speaking to him?" cried Laura, starting up. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," said Mrs. Sylk unhappily.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that he asked Theodosius for my hand?"</p>

  <p>"Well, dear, I should think it's quite likely, or otherwise why did he
  leave so suddenly, not even going to sleep another night at the Dower House,
  but riding straight to Warwick, as you know."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was Patty, the little servant, who told me that. And then I
  induced you to go into Warwick, but it was several days afterwards and he was
  gone."</p>

  <p>"Don't go over all that, dear. Try and forget about it. Whether he asked
  for your hand, or whether they quarrelled over something else, he went
  away."</p>

  <p>"And he didn't come back!" said Laura. "And what was the use, after that,
  of letting me come to London, or to any of these other places!"</p>

  <p>"Well, dear, you always wanted to meet people, have entertainments and
  fine clothes."</p>

  <p>"But with him, with him, Mrs. Sylk. I wanted us to go together to all
  those places. But I hated Leppard Hall. I hate it still, and I've got to go
  back there. And Lucius won't be there. And it'll be the winter-time."</p>

  <p>"Well, there's your marriage to look forward to," urged Mrs. Sylk,
  shivering a little. "Mr. Mostyn's a fine gentleman and will make you a good
  husband, I've no doubt. He's kind and amiable."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's very different from Theo. He flatters me, even spoils me a
  little. But you know he doesn't love me. He admires me, thinks I'm pretty,
  but he doesn't love me, Mrs. Sylk. I think he loved his wife. I never thought
  I'd marry a widower. He had a wife and two children, and he's nearly twenty
  years older than I am."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't look it," protested Mrs. Sylk feebly, "he's a handsome
  gentleman."</p>

  <p>"Do you think so? I might have thought so if I hadn't seen Lucius."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't keep talking of Mr. Delaunay, dear. That way lies trouble,
  and perhaps tragedy. It's but a fancy that's become fixed in your mind. It
  was unfortunate it all happened together&mdash;your accident and his going
  away."</p>

  <p>"My accident?" said Laura with a sly smile "You know that I tried to drown
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" Mrs. Sylk put her hand over the girl's hot mouth. "Don't breathe
  it, it's not true!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I should know whether it is true or not."</p>

  <p>"No, you wouldn't, Laura darling, you wouldn't know. It was that old
  trailing dress you wore, and those thin, slippery shoes," continued the
  distracted woman, hardly knowing what she said.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't they let me go down to the river? I saw her then, you know.
  She came out of the church where she's buried."</p>

  <p>"You must not say those terrible things, Laura!" Mrs. Sylk began to weep.
  "You take all my strength away, you really do. I don't know how to answer
  you. I shan't be able to stay with you if you say things like that. You
  wouldn't like me to leave you, would you?"</p>

  <p>"No." Laura was silent, as if communing with herself, then she said
  abruptly: "But I've been good, haven't I? I haven't even spoken about Lucius.
  You'd think he would write, wouldn't you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think it would be much good if he did. Sir Theo would see you
  didn't get the letters."</p>

  <p>"But there would be a chance of his seeing me if he came to London now.
  Why does he stay in Ireland?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, my darling girl! You must get used to the fact that he's gone
  out of your life. He'll marry another woman, you know. You'll have to get
  used to that idea, too. He's away in another country."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Laura. "But I'm bound to him, you know, for ever. He's just
  part of myself. Why do people think that because one's young one doesn't
  understand these things? I knew, and he knew! Ever since I first saw him, I
  suppose. And yet it's all believed to be a fancy and a caprice. What shall I
  do when I get back to Leppard Hall?"</p>

  <p>The older woman looked forward indeed to this return to the country with
  heavy foreboding. She could not see how that combination of Sir Theo and his
  sister, and the bad feeling there was between them, and the prospective
  husband (whom Hetty Sylk in her heart thought to be something of an
  adventurer and whom she did not believe was really in love with the girl but
  only with her tempting fortune), would fit in against the background of that
  sombre, melancholy mansion, the flat winter landscape, the steady routine of
  little regular duties that made up the dull days. And then Laura's terrible
  fancies!...If only she could think of something to banish those!</p>

  <p>It certainly was, as the girl had just said, some while since she had
  spoken of them, but Mrs. Sylk knew that they were always in her mind. That
  drawing, for instance&mdash;she would bring it out at intervals and touch it
  up. She kept it hidden cunningly; Mrs. Sylk had tried in vain to find
  it&mdash;often enough.</p>

  <p>"Well, I've disturbed you for nothing," said Laura, with a curious smile.
  "I can't help my fate, can I? I mean, I shall have to go back to Leppard Hall
  whatever I say or do."</p>

  <p>"But Harry will be there, and he's cheerful company."</p>

  <p>"What's the use of cheerful company? Whenever I go abroad I shall think of
  Lucius, whenever I see a horseman I shall hope that it is he. You can't think
  what it was like in the spring when I was there. I was looking for him
  everywhere. And when I went those long walks I always pretended I was going
  to meet him, and when I sit in a concert I like to have an empty seat beside
  me, and imagine he has gone out for a little and will return to keep me
  company."</p>

  <p>"You must not speak like that, Laura. You must distract yourself by some
  other thoughts. Don't you realize that you do a wrong thing to marry one man
  when you have another so much in your mind and heart?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm being selfish. I'm marrying Harry because he's going to take me
  away. We shall return to Jamaica; I can just remember it, you know. There was
  light and colour, and people laughing, great flowers with strange blooms such
  as we have never seen in England, and a blue sea, and trees wreathed with
  light creepers. Then we might travel, he might take me to Italy. We might
  even have an apartment in Paris. That's why I'm marrying Harry. I told him
  so, and he didn't seem to care, just kissed my fingers and laughed."</p>

  <p>"You didn't tell him, I hope," said Mrs. Sylk in a faltering voice,
  drawing the girl closer to her in the shadows&mdash;she thought that the
  solitary candle shed a dreary light over them&mdash;"about&mdash;about Mr.
  Delaunay?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't think that fair to Lucius. I don't want him to quarrel with
  Harry."</p>

  <p>The two sat silent in the chill, interlacing shadows; a draught between
  the shutters of the window set the candle-flame flickering.</p>

  <p>"I think," said Laura at last, in a low voice, "that if I was to ask Harry
  to find out about that other Laura Sarelle, he would. Don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't do that, dear," replied Mrs. Sylk, with great uneasiness. "I
  don't think it would be fair to your brother. You know, you're making
  something out of nothing. The story is quite plain and straightforward."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so." Laura sighed. "They burnt all those clothes, everything
  that belonged to her, didn't they, because I meddled with them? Do you know
  what I found, Mrs. Sylk, just before we left Leppard Hall last May? I went
  into that great room where those things were kept&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you did!" exclaimed Mrs. Sylk in dismay. "I told the housekeeper
  never to give you the keys."</p>

  <p>"Well, I stole them one day when she left them on the kitchen table. I
  unlocked the room and there was an inner closet. That was locked, but I got
  in. And what do you think it was? A distillery! There was a still there, and
  all the apparatus for making essences."</p>

  <p>"Well, why not?" said Mrs. Sylk, greatly relieved. "People often had that
  as a pastime, especially in the old days. You might learn yourself, Laura. It
  is very amusing to make perfumes. We could learn to distil roses, for
  instance."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I thought of that," said Laura. "That's one thing why I don't mind
  going back to Leppard Hall," she added, to the elder woman's great surprise.
  "I want to use that little room. I'm going to ask Theo to give it to me as my
  own, and I want to learn to distil&mdash;oh, all kinds of things, to make
  perfumes, essences, and ointments too. I shall get a book of instructions
  while I am in London. Yes, Mrs. Sylk, the thought of that still is quite
  engaging."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk was as pleased as she was surprised by this remark. It certainly
  would be a good thing if Laura found some means of employing her idle time
  and might send many foolish, dangerous fancies out of her mind.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn made a great point of waiting on Mr. Spryce and behaving with
  great amiability towards the lawyer. He had, of course, his own attorney, who
  had undertaken all the legal arrangements of the marriage settlement, but he
  wished, he declared, to make the personal acquaintance of the old family
  friend of the Sarelles.</p>

  <p>He was genial, appeared candid, but, as the lawyer quickly noticed,
  committed himself to nothing. Mr. Spryce had made some cautious inquiries
  about Mr. Harry Mostyn and was not altogether satisfied with the result. The
  gentleman was well-known on the Newmarket and other racecourses, and at the
  card-tables of several fashionable London clubs. He had been, for a short
  time, in the Diplomatic Service, and he had left, suddenly, for no good
  reason that Mr. Spryce could discover, save possibly a quarrel with his
  superiors. Yet he did not seem a man to provoke hostility or easily to enter
  into arguments or debates, and Mr. Spryce, looking at him now, thought that
  perhaps he had given up his diplomatic career either for some more serious
  reason than a difference of opinion with someone in a higher position than
  his own, or out of mere idleness.</p>

  <p>Still, there was nothing against the gentleman; from many points of view
  he was no doubt quite a good match, but not, Mr. Spryce thought, for a girl
  in the position of Laura Sarelle, with her hundred-thousand-pounds dowry and
  her extremely good prospects.</p>

  <p>This, as a matter of fact, was the opinion of Mr. Harry Mostyn himself. He
  considered that the meeting of his distant connection had been the most
  extraordinary stroke of good luck for himself, and when Laura in her wild way
  had called him an adventurer she had not been far wrong, though of course she
  had spoken only out of a mingled shrewdness and fantasy that happened to hit
  the mark. Her surmises had been based on her conviction that Harry Mostyn did
  not love her and on some chance remarks she had heard among her acquaintances
  in. London.</p>

  <p>The truth was that Mr. Mostyn's affairs were far more embarrassed than he
  cared to own. He still had a substantial fortune, but it was a good deal
  damaged. He had some heavy debts and some pressing creditors, and as he did
  not wish to retrench his style of living it would be highly convenient for
  him to announce his betrothal to a great heiress. It was not his purpose to
  have the marriage settlement drawn up at once. He wished first (and he
  arranged this in his mind with an unconscious duplicity, not with any set
  scheme, but only as a matter of mere self-interest) to consolidate his
  influence over the young baronet and to make, if possible, his future bride
  far more infatuated with his own person than she was at present. Then, when
  he had the brother and sister safely bound to him by ties of affection, and,
  he hoped, love, he would be able to broach gradually, and by degrees, the
  fact that he was by no means the wealthy man they had thought him.</p>

  <p>His visit to the lawyer was part of this plan. He wished to ingratiate
  himself with everyone connected with the Sarelle family and to impress on Mr.
  Spryce the considerable concessions he was making in consenting to adopt the
  name of Sarelle and to squire it in Leppard Hall if the brother should
  predecease the sister.</p>

  <p>"For you know, Mr. Spryce," he remarked with an agreeable smile, "I'm a
  cosmopolitan, a man of the city, and I don't know that it would come very
  easily to me to live in that remote country place. Yet for Laura's sake I'm
  quite willing to come to this agreement."</p>

  <p>"It's a very handsome estate," said Mr. Spryce dryly. "Miss Sarelle would
  find no difficulty in getting someone who would agree to her terms, or
  rather, I suppose I should say, her brother's terms."</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Mostyn went on talking agreeably about nothing in particular,
  although the theme of his conversation seemed to be willingness and readiness
  to do all that was required of him. But when Mr. Spryce came down to detail
  in the matter of settlement he put that off, saying that the marriage would
  not be for a year at least, until Laura was of age.</p>

  <p>Mr. Spryce did not like him, and summed him up as a pleasant,
  florid-looking man whose thick, reddish, curling hair, exquisitely dressed,
  was beginning to turn grey on the temples, who was very self-possessed and
  had an air of good humour. He was nearly ten years too old for Laura Sarelle
  and was quite obviously marrying the fortune and the estate, not the
  girl.</p>

  <p>Mr. Spryce blamed the baronet, a young, bookish, sickly and peevish man he
  termed him, who was thus sacrificing his sister to the first-comer, as he
  bitterly put it to himself.</p>

  <p>And in an oblique attempt to save the girl, he checked the suitor's easy
  conversation by remarking suddenly:</p>

  <p>"You don't think Sir Theo's for a long life, do you? There's consumption
  of the lungs in the family, you know. Both his father and uncle had it,
  though they lived to over a fair age, over sixty-two. And all of them were
  eccentric."</p>

  <p>This was said so abruptly and yet with such tacit meaning that Mr. Mostyn
  was brought up short. He stopped and looked at the lawyer quizzically and a
  shrewd expression came into his grey eyes, which were generally gay and
  careless enough.</p>

  <p>"What are you trying to suggest, my dear sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, merely that there's not much attraction except the money in marrying
  into the Sarelle family," replied Mr. Spryce.</p>

  <p>"Their history doesn't interest me," replied the suitor, quickly
  recovering from his slight discomfiture. "My dear sir, you take an entirely
  dry, professional point of view. You forget my feelings for Miss Laura. She's
  a very charming and beautiful young lady."</p>

  <p>"And a very wild and wilful one, too, and scarcely out of the schoolroom.
  And not, in my opinion, fitted for marriage," said the lawyer. "There, I
  spoke freely as an old family friend. You said you came here for
  frankness."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" replied Mr. Mostyn easily. "Laura's no more capricious than
  most young ladies of her age who've had every luxury and indulgence."</p>

  <p>"She may have had the first, but she's never had the last," replied Mr.
  Spryce. "In my opinion, her brother deals with her very harshly. Has she ever
  told you what her feelings are about Leppard Hall?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn replied truthfully: "No."</p>

  <p>"Well, she dislikes the place. She will do almost anything to get away
  from it. She's counting very much on your taking her away&mdash;to Jamaica,
  she hopes."</p>

  <p>"I don't intend to live in Jamaica," replied Mr. Mostyn softly. "But that
  is for future discussion. You know, it's part of my agreement that I should
  reside at Leppard Hall."</p>

  <p>"Yes, if Sir Theodosius dies. But there's no reason why he should. I know
  his health is not very good, but he may live for years yet. And meanwhile,
  you can take Laura abroad." He thought: 'That's the least you can do for her,
  if you don't care for her and are marrying her for her money. This is a
  bargain she'll get nothing out of unless you do give her those few years of
  freedom.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn replied in agreeable and conventional terms that of course if
  Miss Laura wished she could travel abroad, have an apartment in Paris or a
  house in Florence.</p>

  <p>"Believe me," he added with sincerity, "I don't care much for Leppard Hall
  myself. I've been there several times, you know, since I renewed acquaintance
  with Theo. If it ever came into my possession I should be tempted to rebuild
  it."</p>

  <p>'If it ever comes into your possession,' thought Mr. Spryce, 'I doubt if
  you'll ever live there at all.' He looked with disapproval at the
  well-appointed figure of the handsome gentleman with the easy town air and
  his almost mechanical smiles, gestures and courtesies.</p>

  <p>"I'm going down there now. The Sarelles have already left London, you
  know," added Mr. Mostyn, with a touch of regret. "I can't say I look forward
  to the visit. This isn't the time of year for the country. Still, it will be
  a chance to examine the estate. The steward is leaving; Sir Theo wants me to
  look over things with him."</p>

  <p>"Sir Theo is always changing his stewards and his servants. You don't find
  the same people there six months together," said Mr. Spryce. "It is a pity,
  in my mind, that he quarrelled with Lucius Delaunay. He was his friend, you
  know, who was both his steward and his secretary."</p>

  <p>"I never heard of him," replied Mr. Mostyn. "Why do you think it's a pity
  he left? And why did he? I suppose Sir Theo's quarrelsome, peevish, difficult
  to get on with."</p>

  <p>"I've told you," said Mr. Spryce, with a steely look, "that the whole
  family's eccentric."</p>

  <p>"You emphasize that word so much, my dear sir, that you make me believe
  you want me to think they're slightly insane."</p>

  <p>Mr. Spryce did not reply, and Harry Mostyn, fearing he had said too much,
  laughed to cover any offence that his words might have given.</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything of their history?" asked the lawyer, after he had
  again in vain pressed Mr. Mostyn about the settlement and been told casually
  that that would be gone into in good time.</p>

  <p>"Oh, vaguely, yes. They were great people in Jamaica."</p>

  <p>"No, I mean the elder branch&mdash;the Sarelles of Leppard Hall. They've
  been there since the days of the Plantagenets&mdash;it's a French name, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose I shall have to look it all up, genealogy and everything
  else," said Mr. Mostyn good-humouredly, "considering it is to be my name when
  I marry Miss Laura. But all that's for the future; there's a good deal to be
  discussed and a good deal to be found out first."</p>

  <p>He took his leave, amiable and debonair, and the lawyer, returning to his
  desk, sat thoughtfully tapping his teeth with his nails. He looked up at the
  neat boxes that lined the room; it was the hour of dusk, candles would soon
  be brought in. How short the winter days were! The night would darken down at
  Leppard Hall by the middle of the afternoon. He thought of Laura already
  there and was glad that Mrs. Sylk accompanied her. It was a crazy scheme,
  that marriage, though he could understand the motive that had induced both
  brother and sister to accept Mr. Mostyn's offer.</p>

  <p>Sir Theo wanted to be rid, at any cost, of Laura, so long as he could be
  rid of her in some way that at least had an honourable gloss over it. He was
  flattered, too, of course, by the elder man's offer to accept his name and
  the charge of his estate. 'Though I shouldn't be surprised,' thought the
  lawyer, 'if the boy doesn't marry himself one of these days and have a large
  family and throw all their plans out. Still, I didn't like the look of him
  the other day. He seemed sickly, but he will live in that damp, God-forsaken,
  fog-ridden country.'</p>

  <p>But Laura's motive&mdash;well, just the caprice of a wilful girl who
  wanted to escape from tutelage, wanted to go out into the world, wanted to be
  her own mistress and wanted to have the prestige and freedom, as she hoped,
  of a married woman.</p>

  <p>Mr. Spryce did not know the reason why Lucius Delaunay had left Leppard
  Hall, though sometimes he came near to guessing it. He thought that it must
  have been a very powerful and personal motive that caused the young man to
  dismiss one towards whom he had seemed so affectionately disposed and who had
  been of such assistance to him.</p>

  <p>'Well, if it was that,' thought the lawyer, still staring at the
  deed-boxes on which various names were written in large white letters, 'he
  has made a mistake. Better Lucius Delaunay with his pittance than Harry
  Mostyn with whatever fortune he may still have&mdash;and I don't think it'll
  be much when he has discharged his debts and his other obligations. Yet,'
  thought the old man, 'no doubt after all it would be better for Laura to
  marry Harry Mostyn than to remain at Leppard Hall.'</p>

  <p>If she had had a schoolgirl fancy for Lucius Delaunay she had probably got
  over it by now. It must be a year and a half since she had seen him, and
  perhaps she would be very happy with her amiable husband, who would not, Mr.
  Spryce thought, take her very often or keep her very long at Leppard
  Hall.</p>

  <p>Then he thought about the secret of the Sarelles. It was known only to
  himself and a few other people, and he wondered, with a touch of malice,
  whether Mr. Harry Mostyn was so very lucky, after all, in marrying Laura
  Sarelle and undertaking so cheerfully, almost so eagerly, to merge himself
  into her family and to become the squire of Leppard Hall.</p>

  <p>One of the boxes at which Mr. Spryce stared was labelled with that
  name&mdash;"Sarelle"&mdash;and among the documents that it contained was a
  sheet of notepaper, now much yellowed, on which was written in fading ink the
  will of Laura Sarelle, dated 1780. It contained only a few words. Mr. Spryce
  had read them a long time ago when his father had put the affairs of the
  Sarelle family into his hands at the request of Sir John Sarelle, who had
  wished the young lawyer to wait on him at Leppard Hall.</p>

  <p>The will was of no importance, but it had impressed Mr. Spryce, never a
  man of much imagination, both as a pathetic and as an impressive document. He
  remembered every word:</p>

  <p class="letter">This is my last Will and Testament: I have been given over
  by the physicians and expect nothing but a speedy dissolution of body and
  soul. I die a wealthy woman, but I am ignorant how much of my money I may
  dispose of, the estate being entailed and my distant Yorkshire cousin coming,
  as I believe, into all my property. I am, however, moved to make these, my
  last, requests. They are that my body be buried in the church, not in the
  mausoleum beside that of my brother, Theodosius. That my name, and the date
  of my birth and death be set there plainly, with no other adornment than a
  design of laurel leaves, which the curious may interpret as they will. It is
  also my earnest command to my heirs that they destroy Leppard Hall and
  everything that is within it, burning all the furniture, pictures, and
  ornaments of every description and razing the building to the ground. I do
  not know if I have the power to enforce this wish. But if it is not complied
  with, I think that my successors may find themselves, accursed.&mdash;Laura
  Sarelle.</p>

  <p>Well, the will had not been respected save in so far as the poor woman had
  been buried in the church and the local mason had been allowed to sculpture a
  design of laurel leaves round her name on the plain slab of Italian marble
  that bore her name.</p>

  <p>Nobody even knew of the will except her heir, and he, that distant cousin
  from Yorkshire, had never for a moment considered that it would be reasonable
  to destroy the fine mansion that had been so lately added to and improved and
  that was so handsomely furnished and full of so many beautiful and curious
  objects.</p>

  <p>He knew there was a good reason for Laura Sarelle's request and that it
  was one that many people would have carried out. But he was not a
  superstitious man, but rather one who prided himself on his cool head and
  logical mind. He intended to live down the old tragedy, not to emphasize it
  by razing Leppard Hall to the ground.</p>

  <p>And Mr. Spryce, staring at the deed-boxes as the manservant came in with
  the candles, decided that, of course, Sir Richard Sarelle had been right. It
  would have been a very foolish thing to destroy Leppard Hall. People who flew
  in the face of superstition were to be commended for their courage.</p>

  <p>It had, of course, been an act of moral bravery to defy the opinion of the
  entire county and leave the Hall standing and all the furnishings untouched,
  even that room, even that closet, exactly the same as Laura Sarelle and her
  brother had left them.</p>

  <p>But neither Sir Richard, nor his son, Sir John, had been quite brave
  enough to live at the condemned house, although they had made a great
  flourish at keeping it in good order, well stocked with a constant changing
  of servants.</p>

  <p>"It's a wonder," said the lawyer, with a sigh, rising and turning to his
  tall hat and drab coat that hung against the smoke-stained wall and preparing
  for his journey home, "that someone has not seen a ghost there."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>When Mr. Mostyn, after delaying as long as he could in London, arrived at
  Leppard Hall, it was the twilight of a day in December and the snow was
  falling in fast flakes.</p>

  <p>He looked out of the carriage window as the vehicle turned into the drive
  between the piers with the stone supporters, and stared with a good deal of
  curiosity at the estate that was to be his wife's dowry, for he felt quite
  certain of that in his own mind, though for decency's sake he would never say
  so, for he did not believe that Sir Theodosius would marry, or that he was,
  indeed, likely to enjoy a long life.</p>

  <p>The aspect of the grey-fronted mansion against the grey sky, which seemed
  every second to grow darker, was so disagreeable that Mr. Mostyn had a little
  shock of surprise.</p>

  <p>'It's a confoundedly dreary place, mote gloomy than I remembered,' he
  thought, 'and certainly, if I ever have the chance of doing so, I shall
  rebuild it. That last-century façade, if that was taken off and it was
  touched up in the Gothic style...' He leaned back in the carriage, trying to
  distract himself with plans for the future, for he did not expect much
  pleasure from this visit.</p>

  <p>It was, of course, wholly unreasonable for Sir Theodosius to wish him to
  come to this country place at this season of the year when they might have
  all lived so cheerfully in London, or even in Cheltenham, or some other
  genteel neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn groaned a little to himself when he wondered what he would do
  with his days, deprived of all his usual diversions, friends and
  acquaintances. But the prize was worth a few disagreeables. Why, Sir
  Theodosius, had he known it, could have got, by snapping his fingers, half a
  dozen titles to compete for Laura's hand, but he had never, so to speak, put
  her in the market. Hardly anyone knew of her existence or of her great
  fortune.</p>

  <p>The fellow's damnably secretive,' thought Harry Mostyn. 'What a stroke of
  luck that I was related to him! I should never have heard of him else.'</p>

  <p>As he sat there in his warm fur coat in the well-padded carnage he
  recalled what Mr. Spryce had said about the family history, how he had talked
  about their ill-health, their eccentricity, hinted even some doubt of their
  sanity.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn was prepared to risk that. Laura was a charming creature; he
  could even persuade himself he was a little in love with her, though she was
  young enough in mind, if not in years, to be his daughter. She had a bloom, a
  freshness and a vitality that was very attractive, and though she might be
  capricious and wilful&mdash;well, he dared say that he could tame that...A
  few airs and graces were not unbecoming in so pretty a woman.</p>

  <p>As for the brother, Mr. Mostyn candidly hoped that he would not live very
  long, or that if he did he would keep to Leppard Hall and his 'books and
  allow Mr. Mostyn and his bride to depart on their travels. A hundred thousand
  pounds would go a long way even in a luxurious life.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn was good-natured, though not very scrupulous. He did not intend
  either to ill-treat Laura or to stint her in any of her desires, but he did
  intend to get a hold on brother and sister so as to confuse them as to his
  desirability as a husband for the great heiress.</p>

  <p>He travelled with his own servant and carriage and horses and put up as
  good a show as possible, preferring to go, deeper into debt than to admit
  that his resources were in any way strained.</p>

  <p>When he stepped out of the carriage in front of the Hall he looked up at
  it again, and again was most unpleasantly impressed by its dark and gloomy
  appearance. The windows were already shuttered or unlit, the whole place was
  blank. Mr. Mostyn did not wonder that Sir Theodosius frequently changed his
  stewards and his servants, and that very few guests ever came to Leppard
  Hall.</p>

  <p>The door was soon opened and Mr. Mostyn was received with due ceremony,
  being offered, as he had to admit himself, a very handsome suite of rooms on
  the first floor, consisting of a bed-chamber, a parlour, and a closet,
  arranged in the eighteenth-century style for powdering.</p>

  <p>He remembered that Sir Theodosius had told him he took pride in leaving
  the Hall exactly as it had been when he had inherited it. Neither Sir Richard
  nor Sir John had touched the furnishings, even the very positions of the
  pieces were the same as they had been when Laura Sarelle had died in
  1780.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn's rooms were, he noticed at once, decidedly old-fashioned. The
  pieces of furniture were well polished, the floor and walls glowed in amber
  colour in the old panelling, the pictures, rich landscapes and fruit pieces,
  were well preserved and well framed, but all had an antique air not
  altogether pleasing to the man whose own taste was very much of his own day
  and even of his own moment. And again he made a secret decision that if ever
  he was master of the place he would alter the interior as well as the
  exterior.</p>

  <p>Sir Theodosius received him gloomily in the large withdrawing-room or
  salon that opened into the opposite side of the wide corridor to the
  dining-room, and the elder man saw that he would have to make a considerable
  effort to retain his hold over this difficult and peevish youth, for Sir
  Theodosius seemed little more, although he was nearly in his twenty-fifth
  year.</p>

  <p>He coughed a good deal and, complained about his health and the weather,
  said that he had been confined to the house for several days by the snow and
  the cold, that a case of books he had been expecting from London had not
  arrived, and seemed to regard Harry Mostyn with such languid interest that
  that gentleman wondered if he had cooled in his attitude towards the proposed
  marriage.</p>

  <p>The guest therefore exerted his not inconsiderable charm, was gay,
  solicitous and amiable, and had the pleasure, in half an hour or so, of
  seeing the young man considerably more cheerful. He listened to Harry
  Mostyn's anecdotes with some appearance of appreciation and even smiled in
  response to some of his quips and tales of London life.</p>

  <p>'I shall have to amuse him,' Mr. Mostyn was thinking. 'I shall have to
  keep him interested in life. Why, he's half dead already. This won't do, not
  until things are a little more forward. The guardian sickly and eccentric,
  and the girl not knowing her own mind, why, everything might be broken off
  yet!' And he thought with an unpleasant wince of the money that he had
  already spent in order to keep up appearances while he had been engaged to
  Laura Sarelle.</p>

  <p>The suitor did not see the lady until the elaborate and formal dinner was
  served. Then she appeared in a gown of a dark-green silk with a necklace of
  turquoises round her slender, long neck. He thought that she looked extremely
  beautiful, and his spirits rose at the prospect of possessing this delicious
  creature and her golden fortune.</p>

  <p>He was gay, amusing, and seemed to please not only the baronet and Mrs.
  Sylk, who was also at the richly appointed table, but Laura herself. He spoke
  of plans for the future, of visits to Italy, to Venice, Rome and Florence,
  Paris, of concerts and balls that they must attend in London. He suggested
  that they should leave Leppard Hall in a short while.</p>

  <p>"Your brother's health doesn't seem too satisfactory down here in the
  winter."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he always has that cough now," said Laura indifferently.</p>

  <p>And the baronet declared with sudden peevishness that he disliked any
  reference to his health, and that he was far better at Leppard Hall than he
  was in London.</p>

  <p>Mostyn drank a good deal of Sir Theodosius' excellent wine in order to
  keep up his spirits, for his task was not too easy: He felt the atmosphere of
  the house oppressing him, and he really disliked Sir Theodosius, who was in
  every way antipathetic to him&mdash;a scholar, a dry, reserved, precocious
  young man, who had not a single taste in common with him, Harry Mostyn.</p>

  <p>But he did not drink too much, he was careful there, only enough to make
  him a cheerful, flattering companion.</p>

  <p>When the two women had left the room and the men were alone with their
  host, he redoubled his attentions to the young man, who sat in a drooping
  attitude in the big chair by the fire, having left his place at the table,
  with the filigree silver bowl of hothouse fruit and the glass of wine that he
  had scarcely touched at his place.</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn tried to think of some subject that might be pleasing to his
  young host. It was hopeless for him to talk of the classics, of Greek, or
  Latin, or Hebrew. He had had the usual education of a gentleman, but was
  nothing of a scholar, and not remotely interested in such subjects. And it
  was no good for him to try to talk to Sir Theodosius of his own pastimes,
  sports, companions and diversions.</p>

  <p>Therefore he decided to talk about the one subject that they both had in
  common&mdash;the Sarelle family and Leppard Hall. He handsomely praised the
  place, the costly antique furnishing, the rich tapestry, the well-polished
  panelled walls, of linenfold Tudor design, and he asked, to make
  conversation, who were the originals of the two graceful portraits that hung
  at the end of the room facing down the table, as if they too were guests who
  had their place at the board.</p>

  <p>"One is Laura Sarelle, who was the last heiress of the main line," replied
  Sir Theodosius petulantly. "We don't know who the other is. It's a very fine
  piece, by Gainsborough, it is supposed. It was found in the attic. Laura has
  an intense dislike for both those pictures, that's the reason I leave them
  there. She mustn't be indulged, you know."</p>

  <p>"Laura Sarelle!" said Mr. Mostyn, with a quizzical look. "It isn't like
  her namesake, is it? Yet, I don't know&mdash;perhaps if she had the same
  powdered hair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pray don't speak about it," broke in Sir Theodosius. "Sire found that
  very dress once in the attic, and put it on. There was an accident. She
  tripped in the long skirt and got her feet wet in the river. She was ill for
  quite a while, they thought she'd have brain-fever."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn was rather startled by these laconic sentences. He saw that he
  had for once, and all unknowingly, been tactless. It occurred to him that it
  would have been only kind on the part of Sir Theodosius to remove these
  pictures if Laura disliked them, especially now, as she must have such
  unpleasant associations with them.</p>

  <p>And he asked why the original of the portrait had not been married. And
  Sir Theodosius replied curtly that she had died very young of a consumption
  in the lungs.</p>

  <p>"It's an hereditary disease with us, you know, but Laura seems free. My
  father died of this, as did my mother, in Jamaica, but my uncle lived to a
  good age."</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't, talk in so melancholy a fashion," urged Mr. Mostyn warmly.
  "And, Theo, I do think you should get away from Leppard Hall. It really is
  damp here&mdash;and melancholy," he could not refrain from adding.</p>

  <p>Yes, it seemed damp and melancholy even in that comfortable room with the
  great wood-fire and the shutters closed over the snow and cold. Yes, a
  clinging, chilly, unhealthy atmosphere seemed to fill the splendid chamber.
  And Harry Mostyn, looking at the table with the filigree service and the rich
  appointments of silver, porcelain and glass, had a sudden impression that he
  looked at a banquet that had been set for the dead, as if the table had been
  arranged thus for years, as if the wine and fruit had been kept intact, the
  china shining, the glass gleaming by some enchantment. He felt as if he
  peered through a window at another world.</p>

  <p>The heavy, florid man shook his shoulders, straightened himself and rose.
  With an excuse that lacked something of his usual grace he took his leave of
  the sullen young man in the chair by the fireside and crossed the passage to
  the withdrawing-room.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk was in the window-place, reading; she had tactfully withdrawn
  herself, knowing that the suitor was likely to follow the beloved. And Mr.
  Mostyn took the hint and crossed to the hearth where Laura, in her green
  gown, sat on a low divan of dark-yellow silk.</p>

  <p>The room was as "old-fashioned"&mdash;that was the term Mr. Mostyn used in
  his mind&mdash;as the rest of the house. Heavy pieces of furniture, inlaid
  and finely finished, dark pictures of the last century (no portraits here,
  but fruit pieces and landscapes again such as he had in his own room), a rich
  marble chimney-piece, great blue vases of Rockingham china, painted with
  bunches of roses and carnations, chairs covered with that rich dark-yellow
  satin. The room gave a great impression of wealth and dignity, but it was not
  an apartment that Mr. Mostyn cared for in the least.</p>

  <p>He found the exertion of making himself agreeable more and more difficult,
  yet he was a man to whom it came very easily to charm and ingratiate himself
  with people, and Laura smiled at him in amiable fashion, as if she were glad
  to have his company. She made no pretence of needlework or of turning over
  the pages of a book, her hands lay idle in her lap. She lifted up a corner of
  her dark-green skirt and asked him if he liked the colour of the
  material.</p>

  <p>"The colour of laurel leaves; you know&mdash;Laura," she smiled, and he
  made some conventional remark about the poetical association with her
  charming name.</p>

  <p>He then asked her, in a tender tone that could not possibly give offence,
  why she disliked the portrait in the dining-room.</p>

  <p>"I think it very unreasonable of Theo to keep it there if you don't care
  for it. I'll get it removed for you, dear Laura."</p>

  <p>"Will you?" She seemed surprised and grateful, touched at anyone taking
  such interest in her. Her eyes turned on him with an intensity of expression,
  an expression he could not quite understand, but that almost embarrassed him,
  easy man of the world as he was. What was the matter with the child?</p>

  <p>"Why, of course I will! It's only a little thing. Your brother's difficult
  sometimes, isn't he, Laura, but I dare say I can manage him for you."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I dare say you could, Harry. You seem to me the sort of man who
  could manage most things. But it's no use having the portraits moved." She
  was silent a moment, then she added: "For I. think it is too late."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;too late, dear Laura? Do you mean that you'll
  always remember the portrait even when it's moved?"</p>

  <p>"You're quick, and I'm not used to having quick people about me, not since
  Lucius went."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk looked up from her book at hearing this name. How could Laura
  speak this name in such a casual fashion in front of this man who was to be
  her husband! But Laura seemed to have forgotten that anybody else was there;
  she rose and rested her elbow on the marble mantelshelf close to the gleaming
  splendour of the dark-blue Rockingham vase, the firelight glowing all over
  her beauty and her silk.</p>

  <p>"This Lucius was a friend of yours, was he not?" asked Mr. Mostyn
  gently.</p>

  <p>"Yes, a friend. A friend of Theo's too. It's no use speaking of him. And I
  don't think it's any use your having the portrait moved. You might find out
  who the original of the other portrait is&mdash;the man, you know."</p>

  <p>"It's a fine piece of work, I dare say it would sell for a round sum.
  Perhaps as it's not a member of the family, we could induce Theo to part with
  it, eh, Laura?"</p>

  <p>"You're kind," she complimented him again, looking at him with a smile.
  "It's quite a fair bargain between us, isn't it? You will be kind to me and
  take me away, and then you can have all my money. I believe you want it,
  don't you?"</p>

  <p>"You're a most precocious girl, as precocious as your brother. Why do you
  keep telling me that I want your money?" He was able to be quite easy, though
  she in her childish candour had come so near the truth. "Everyone's glad to
  have large sums of money to handle, Laura. Yours will be wisely invested and
  wisely spent. You shall have as much of it as you wish for yourself."</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything about it," she said indifferently. "If it's any
  good to you, I'm glad. I shall be so grateful to you for taking me away."</p>

  <p>"It's pretty dull here in the winter, what do you do all day?" he agreed.
  "I must try to think of something to amuse you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but I have an amusement! I do distilling. I found the still upstairs
  in the little closet. You know, that one near the great chamber where the
  dress was." She paused, looked at him doubtfully, then continued: "I found
  the yellow dress that the woman in the picture, the other Laura, is
  wearing."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn affected a surprise that masked curiosity.</p>

  <p>"And then I was rather ill. And they took it away and destroyed it. And
  there were some other clothes too, some trinkets and odd things, I believe
  some letters. I wish I could have read them." Her face puckered up like a
  child's who is about to cry. "They left the furniture. It's a fine room, the
  best in the Hall, I must show it to you. And there's a closet off it, and
  it's arranged as a distillery. And I've got Mrs. Marston, the housekeeper, to
  show me how to distil, and when I was in London I bought several books. When
  the roses and carnations come I shall make the perfumes and essences."</p>

  <p>"That's a pretty art," said he, glad that she had found something to
  please her, for he good-naturedly liked to think that the girl was happy in
  this wretched place, for so, for all its splendour, he thought Leppard Hall.
  "To-morrow you must show me; I know nothing of such things. But you have no
  flowers to distil just now."</p>

  <p>"I experiment with evergreen and what I can get from the hothouse," smiled
  Laura. "How strange to see you at Leppard Hall," she added inconsequently.
  "You don't seem to belong here at all. And yet you are to be a Sarelle also.
  Do you know anything about us?"</p>

  <p>"Is there much to know?" he parried. "You have a long and honourable
  history. Your brother is very proud of it, I think."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that there's anything to be proud of," said Laura. "Do you
  like Leppard Hall? I think it is horrible, so ugly and gloomy. It always
  seems cold, too, as if the fires were of elmwood."</p>

  <p>"Why, doesn't elmwood give out heat?" he asked easily. "Don't you know?
  It's the wood they make coffins of, the very flames are cold."</p>

  <p>"You have a curious fancy, my dear Laura&mdash;a little morbid, don't you
  think, and unwholesome? Do you go riding? Shall we, if the snow holds off
  sufficiently, go riding to-morrow, say to Rugby or Warwick? You have friends
  in the neighbourhood?"</p>

  <p>He probed eagerly into the girl's pastimes, habits, and diversions.</p>

  <p>But Laura shook her head; a sudden languor like that which had attacked
  her brother seemed to come over her. She rose, made a quick curtsy, and left
  the room, saying she was tired and on the morrow would show him her
  still.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn endured the life of Leppard Hall for a few days, and then,
  under the excuse of looking for some books that Sir Theodosius was expecting
  by rail, rode into Warwick. The day was fairly fine and he tried to persuade
  Laura to accompany him, but she refused to leave the house. She was a good
  horsewoman but not fond of that exercise and preferred to walk along the
  banks of the river, leaning on the arm of Mrs. Sylk, or by herself, sometimes
  very slowly with a heavy dragging step, sometimes with great rapidity,
  almost, Mrs. Sylk thought with terror, an unnatural swiftness.</p>

  <p>It took all the glitter of the Sarelle fortune to reconcile Mr. Mostyn to
  the match. After two days at Leppard Hall his dislike of Sir Theodosius was
  intensified and he found that he was not as much in love with the charming
  Miss Laura as he had hoped he was.</p>

  <p>The girl was unaccountable, her thoughts always seemed far away. He
  wondered if she was in love with another man. He had made some shrewd
  inquiries about Lucius Delaunay, who had been so popular in Leppard and who
  had left his place so suddenly. Not that that was uncommon; Mr. Erskine, the
  present steward, was about to leave after remaining only eighteen months. He
  was an austere Scot and not much was to be got out of him, though Mr. Mostyn
  had tried his genial good-humour upon him in a series of questions, some more
  or less flattering, about the estate and his management of it.</p>

  <p>'I feel like an interloper here,' Harry Mostyn thought as he rode into
  Warwick. 'I don't like the place, and I can swear that it doesn't like me.
  That reflection shows I am getting as superstitious as they are. It's all
  old-fashioned, out of date, behind the times, that's what it is. It isn't
  wholesome not to change a place for nearly a hundred years.'</p>

  <p>The books had not arrived at Warwick station, and Mr. Mostyn, who knew no
  one in the town, refreshed himself, at the inn, the <i>Bear and Ragged
  Staff</i>, and as he drank in the parlour noticed a very handsome whip in a
  glass case over the mantelpiece. Surprised at seeing such an object so
  carefully preserved in such a position, he asked the landlord, who was
  serving him, the meaning of it.</p>

  <p>"Why, that," replied the man, with an air of relish, "belonged to Captain
  Avershaw."</p>

  <p>"And who might Captain Avershaw be?" asked Mr. Mostyn good-humouredly.
  "I'm a stranger here, I don't know your local celebrities."</p>

  <p>"He's a gentleman who was hanged here, something like sixty years ago."
  The landlord still seemed to enjoy the dark mystery, as Mr. Mostyn supposed
  it to be.</p>

  <p>"Ah, well, in those days they hanged people for very little. What was
  this&mdash;highway robbery?"</p>

  <p>"No, it was murder." And the landlord refused to say another word on the
  subject. "We won't talk of it. It's one of those tales that are supposed to
  be hushed up, as the saying goes."</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn was not much interested in this relic of a murderer or in the
  hint of a tale the landlord mouthed over with slow pleasure in a local
  celebrity; Mostyn had, in the course of many travels, come across
  extraordinary mementoes of the past from emblazoned monuments to such
  personal trifles as this. And as he looked with indifference on the glass
  case that contained the handsome riding-whip, he wondered to himself why he
  did not leave the man to his dull gossip. But there was a heaviness, not
  customary with his usual volatile spirit, on Mr. Mostyn. The scene about him
  seemed to recede and to become like a painted drop-cloth. He had a sensation
  almost as if he had been partially stunned or by some means had lapsed into a
  sudden half-consciousness. He saw the parlour in every detail, from the sand
  on the floor to the whip in its case and the fire burning clearly behind the
  brightly polished bars of the steel grate; he saw the landlord with his
  veinous nose and mottled dewlaps of flesh, and he heard his voice saying:</p>

  <p>"Yes, Captain Avershaw was a grand gentleman. He used to come here in my
  grandfather's time, and he sent him that whip from the prison&mdash;the
  castle, you know&mdash;for they let him keep some of his
  possessions&mdash;the day before he went to the cart and the rope. He was a
  merry gentleman to the last and a good painter, too. My father used to say
  that he painted a sign for this inn instead of paying the bill once. He did
  it in a couple of hours, but where it's gone to I don't know."</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn heard these words and they seemed to him as if they were
  recited by an actor on the stage. He felt disgusted, almost alarmed by the
  lethargy that had crept over him, he believed, when he had first entered the
  town of Warwick, and insensitive as he was to the overtones and undercurrents
  of life, he began to feel susceptible to a certain peril of the mind.</p>

  <p>Putting his glass down, he said half stupidly, and it was not his usual
  manner to be stupid, for he was a man who was alert and keen to both the
  business and the pleasures of life:</p>

  <p>"For what was this. Captain Avershaw hanged?"</p>

  <p>"For the murder of his brother-in-law," said the landlord, with relish.
  "He had great connections, too, came of a noble family, as you might say. But
  there was no sparing him, though he had a London surgeon and a London lawyer
  down, who made a great fight for him at the Assizes."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's an old story now," said Mr. Mostyn, still making that effort
  as if against the misting of his senses and a weight upon his tongue and
  eyes, "and has nothing to do with me. It's a queer thing for you to keep that
  whip there; it must be valuable, too. The handle seems of gold."</p>

  <p>"Gold-plated," remarked the landlord with pride. "Can I get you another
  drink, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing more. I suppose," Mr. Mostyn added, and he could not understand
  why he asked the question, for it did not sound like his own voice speaking,
  "he hasn't left a ghost behind, this gentlemanly murderer of yours?"</p>

  <p>"I never heard of it," answered the other, with an ugly, sly look. "You
  can still see up at the Castle prison some drawings he made on the
  wall&mdash;with the juice of black cherries some friends sent him, I believe,
  for it was the summer season when he suffered. They say his lady walks, but
  that would be at Leppard, where she's buried, not here."</p>

  <p>"Buried at Leppard, eh!" repeated Mr. Mostyn, lazily paying the reckoning.
  "Ay, I think that place is haunted enough."</p>

  <p>He spoke entirely from his own impression of the Hall and the surrounding
  country, for he had heard no sinister tale connected with either, but the
  landlord took him up as if he understood perfectly what he had meant, and
  with an odious chuckle said:</p>

  <p>"Ay, sir, I'll wager that's haunted&mdash;every corner of it. And as for
  trying to live an old scandal down, why, it's nothing but foolishness and
  tempting of the Devil."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn went away quickly, forcing his own sloth. He would have liked
  to stay by the fire, for the weather was grey and chill, and he was reluctant
  to return to Leppard Hall. But he also had a strong dislike to remain in that
  parlour and hear the landlord talking of the hanging of Captain Avershaw.</p>

  <p>'So Madam Avershaw lies in Leppard Church or the churchyard,' he mused.
  'Well, it always seemed to me a place to be avoided. I suppose I'll have to
  go there on Sundays. I'll look out for her grave.'</p>

  <p>Then he checked himself for his thoughts, so suddenly that he pulled at
  his horse's bridle and made the animal prance. Again he was aware of that
  peril to the mind, that supernatural terror that seemed enveloping him as the
  mist enveloped the water-meadows.</p>

  <p>'What's any of it to me?' he considered. 'I've never dwelt on such matters
  before. Am I one to be frightened at ghosts or bogeys?'</p>

  <p>But he rode back in a gloomy and sober mood, as if he had left all his
  wits, as he thought bitterly, and all his gaiety in London.</p>

  <p>Leppard certainly was a melancholy place. And he had never liked the
  country save for hunting, and Sir Theodosius was no sportsman; why, he never
  left the house, it seemed, and had no visitors.</p>

  <p>For a moment a curious temptation came to Harry Mostyn, a wish to indulge
  his own cowardice, his own fear, to escape from this countryside and return
  to his usual life and his usual embarrassments. He did not love Laura
  Sarelle; he did not, he thought now in this cold moment of self-examination
  and detachment from the situation, even like her. He had nothing whatever in
  common with Sir Theodosius; the sickly, pedantic boy often exasperated him
  extremely.</p>

  <p>Better to leave the whole "damned crew", as he named them in his mind. He
  detested that Mrs. Sylk, too, with her nervous, frightened air and her prying
  looks, and Parson Mist seemed half-witted to the elegant townsman, while his
  wife was a crippled imbecile. And the steward, a sullen man, under dismissal
  for no fault of his own...fine company, indeed...</p>

  <p>But as Harry Mostyn rode back along the high road from Warwick to Leppard
  he conquered this mood and despised himself for having even for a second
  indulged it. He was not a young man or one with very much to offer beyond
  specious manners, a knowledge of the world, and good looks rapidly becoming
  over-florid. Nor were girls with a fortune of a hundred thousand pounds to be
  picked up any day, even by those younger and better endowed than himself.</p>

  <p>Besides, his financial difficulties were somewhat worse than he liked to
  admit even to himself. He had known for some time that he would have to go
  heiress-hunting, and this prize had dropped into his lap, and he would be
  something more than a fool to give it up because of the gloom of the
  countryside during a hard winter. "It is only," he told himself, "that I'm
  not used to this kind of life. Of course, I could put it through even if it
  were worse than this for the sake of the money."</p>

  <p>His shrewd common sense asserted itself. Not only would he have to put it
  through, he would have to go carefully. Theodosius must be conciliated, he
  must be flattered. His big bait, of course, was the offer to change his name.
  Laura must be won over, flattered too, but in a different way. Even Mrs. Sylk
  must be placated. Tedious, a wearisome task, and there would be no one to
  help him. He was single-handed in the establishment, save for his
  bodyservant. And he would certainly have to force his inclinations to show
  any interest in Sir Theodosius' bookish concerns. The only part of the
  business in which he was likely to take any pleasure was looking over the
  estate and getting hold of the accounts if he could.</p>

  <p>Yes, he must concentrate on that. Laura's fortune, a hundred thousand
  pounds that he would be able to handle as soon as he married her, and that
  larger fortune that she would come into when her brother died, certainly at
  least double that amount.</p>

  <p>Two other considerations were turned over in the florid gentleman's
  calculating mind as he rode towards Leppard Hall. The first was: 'I don't
  really know sufficient about these people. I thought that old lawyer was
  fencing with me. I tried to search my mind for what I could remember about
  them in Jamaica, but it's not much. Everyone around here seems dumb or
  stupid, or sullen.'</p>

  <p>The second consideration was: 'When I'm master of the place I'll have the
  Hall down. I shan't very often be even in whatever I decide to raise in its
  place.' A Gothic mansion, he decided, with mock turrets, and a lodge like a
  hunting-box, that would be better than this drab grey Palladian building,
  which had a horrid air of looming larger and larger as you gazed at it till
  it filled the whole landscape.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn's bodyservant, Flasket, was a man admirably suited to such a
  master. He had been with him for many years and was well paid and well fee'd
  for his services and his discretion. Mr. Mostyn never had any luck on the
  racecourse or the gaming-tables of which Flasket did not have his part. There
  were many little transactions that others might have considered discreditable
  that had been shared between them.</p>

  <p>It was to Flasket, a quiet-mannered, excellently trained man with a
  porridge-coloured face pitted with smallpox, that Harry Mostyn now entrusted
  the task of finding out something about the Sarelles. He knew that would not
  be very easy; the servants had been changed frequently during the three and a
  half years that brother and sister had lived at Leppard Hall, but some had
  been there for nearly all that time, and some of the tenants could remember
  the days of Sir John and Sir Richard.</p>

  <p>"Don't go prying, openly sticking your nose into affairs, I needn't warn
  you of that," said Mr. Mostyn, who had already conveyed in delicate fashion
  to the manservant how much depended on his marriage to this heiress, "but
  just see what you can pick up." And as an afterthought, and really against
  his own volition, he added: "I'd like to know something about a Madam
  Avershaw who is buried in the church."</p>

  <p>Having thus set his faithful spy at work, Mr. Mostyn rallied all the
  patience he possessed to put a difficult business through successfully and
  gracefully. He devoted himself principally to Theodosius, with whom he soon
  (and readily) increased his influence. The young baronet seemed lonely,
  unhappy and baffled. He liked a companion who endured his moods, his
  ill-tempers, his complaints, his absorption in his classical labours. One who
  allowed him to boast, in his genteel fashion, about the family and the
  estates, support him, indeed, in every whim and every prejudice.</p>

  <p>And Mr. Mostyn found the young man's moods and tempers easier to bear, as
  he mentally noted for himself the extent of the property and how extremely
  well-kept it was&mdash;the farms, the mill, the meadows, the parkland, the
  fine timber, cattle and sheep, horses and carriages in the stables. Yes, all
  was well noted by Mr. Harry Mostyn, down to the pictures and the furniture,
  the gold and silver plate used with unnecessary ostentation at the evening
  meal, the fine Persian carpets, the valuable hangings, the closets and
  cupboards stacked with all manner of furnishing.</p>

  <p>With Laura the affair was more difficult. There was, after all, nothing
  much to complain of in the girl, who entirely occupied herself, as Mr. Mostyn
  noticed with complacent self-satisfaction, in household duties. She had
  become, of a sudden, domesticated, and she spent most of her time in the
  little room upstairs fitted up with still and retort that she had turned into
  her own special apartment and where she was employed, sometimes under the
  supervision of the housekeeper, Mrs. Marston, and sometimes alone, distilling
  perfumes and essences and making pomades and lotions.</p>

  <p>When she gave her betrothed her company she was pleasant enough, though
  too shrewd for his liking. She did not hesitate to address him to his face,
  with a kind of sneering lightness, as a fortune-hunter, and though he was
  accomplished enough to pass off such talk as mere pleasantry, he did not much
  relish it as it was too near the truth.</p>

  <p>Nor could he make much headway with Hetty Sylk. She seemed to mistrust
  him, never to let him into her confidence, as he would have much liked to be
  let into it, for he felt that she held the key to the characters and careers
  of both brother and sister. But she always kept him at arm's length and he
  could not make her yield to his subtle and discreet flatteries. He decided
  that, when he had married Laura, Mrs. Sylk should leave&mdash;quite
  handsomely, of course, with a pension, but definitely leave&mdash;his
  establishment.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>It was nearly the Christmas season before Timothy Flasket made his report
  to his master; Mr. Mostyn had not questioned the servant, knowing that it
  would be a slow and perhaps 'difficult business for him to collect his facts
  and impressions, and that when he was ready he would speak.</p>

  <p>But this evening, while he was dressing his master's still handsome and
  abundant hair and side-whiskers, a bronze colour becomingly flecked with
  grey, Flasket began, quietly and decorously, to repeat what he had learned
  since he had come to Leppard Hall.</p>

  <p>It was not very much. The man was disappointed to have to relate, and the
  master disappointed to have to hear, a report that consisted of very vague
  impressions and very few facts. The only important thing that Flasket had
  been able to discover through the servants, and they had been not at all easy
  to deal with, was the curious little episode when Miss Laura had fallen into
  the river while wearing an antique gown that she had discovered in the great
  bedchamber attached to the little room where she now worked at the still:
  empty apartments opposite her own, and directly above those given to Harry
  Mostyn, that faced those of Sir Theodosius.</p>

  <p>Flasket related the episode, in every detail as he had learned it, to his
  master. He ventured to think that it was important, because it coincided with
  the sudden departure of Mr. Lucius Delaunay, who had been considered the
  closest possible friend of Sir Theodosius. Everyone on the estate and in the
  house had been immensely surprised by the young man's departure, and as it
  came so close on the accident to Miss Laura it had been believed that Mr.
  Delaunay had made an unexpected offer for her hand, been repulsed, and had
  gone on the instant, not even sleeping another night in the Dower House, but
  leaving for Warwick with his luggage all unpacked to be sent on after
  him.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said Mr. Mostyn slowly, looking at himself in the glass. "Do
  you mean they were in love with each other?"</p>

  <p>The question, though addressed by a master to a servant whom he employed
  as a spy, was spoken in a respectable tone. Harry Mostyn knew how to give a
  gloss of decency to these affairs.</p>

  <p>"Everyone's very tight-lipped, sir," said Flasket&mdash;"very tight-lipped
  indeed. I've only put these together from hints. There's an old man works at
  the stables who knows a bit More than they think he does. And there's one of
  the maids here now who heard it from another maid. The girls were only
  together in the house a couple of days, but this Patty, the one who left, she
  evidently was full of it."</p>

  <p>"It sounds quite likely. Who was this Mr. Delaunay?"</p>

  <p>Flasket had found out, and related the story to his master.</p>

  <p>"So he's gone to Ireland. No danger there, I suppose. Probably by now
  she's forgotten him. A strange thing for Sir Theodosius to allow a personable
  young man to be shut up with his young sister..."</p>

  <p>"He was well liked, this Mr. Delaunay, everyone respected him. He was a
  good steward, too; they say he left the place in excellent condition. He used
  to help Sir Theodosius with his books."</p>

  <p>"A paragon," remarked Mr. Mostyn lightly.</p>

  <p>"But penniless, sir," said Flasket. "He had very little but the money he
  got here."</p>

  <p>"That would be the trouble, of course. The young lady being an heiress and
  not going out into society. And why was she dressed up in this antique style?
  The gown you say that she found upstairs?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and then she had an illness. It was nearly brain-fever, so I hear.
  And this old stableman, Peach, says there was a great bonfire made, he had to
  go with a rake and help one of the gardeners burn the things. Clothes they
  were, and books, packets of letters, drawings, all taken out of the room, the
  great bedchamber they call it, upstairs."</p>

  <p>"To whom did they belong?" asked Mr. Mostyn. He rose, patting the smooth
  waves of his thick hair. What Flasket had found out might be useful after
  all...</p>

  <p>"Oh, they belonged to the other Miss Laura Sarelle, the lady who was the
  last of the main branch of the family, sir."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've heard of her," Mostyn said thoughtfully. "She died young,
  didn't she?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I can't get to her story. But there's something there, everyone's
  very quiet. She's buried in the church, while the others are in the
  mausoleum. She was only four-and-twenty. There was some trouble."</p>

  <p>"A scandal?"</p>

  <p>"I think so, sir, pretty considerable. An inquest. Someone staying at the
  house and she careless with a sleeping-draught."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn knew something of the characters of the two last owners of
  Leppard Hall, hard-headed men who prided themselves on their logic and their
  worldly common sense. He supposed that this was why they had tucked away, or
  rather refused to take any notice of, an old gossiping tale that other
  families might have found hard to endure. That was why they had altered
  nothing at Leppard Hall, why the last of them had allowed his daughter to be
  christened Laura.</p>

  <p>Continuing these thoughts aloud, Mr. Mostyn said:</p>

  <p>"You'll notice, Flasket, that these are the first two Sarelles to live
  here since Miss Laura Sarelle died. I wonder what room she died in, and of
  what?"</p>

  <p>"A consumption of the lungs, sir, I think. Not a strong family." The
  servant added with meaning, "Nor in the head, sir, if you understand what I
  mean. They're very eccentric and wild."</p>

  <p>"You've heard that! About these two?&mdash;Sir Theo and his sister?"</p>

  <p>"They're supposed to be strange, sir," continued Flasket, picking his
  words very carefully. "Mrs. Sylk came down one night for a cordial for Miss
  Laura, she was much agitated. She let the housekeeper, Mrs. Marston then,
  know that Miss Laura used to have fits at a time when she was a
  child&mdash;nightmares, and sleepwalking and that kind of thing, as if she
  was always afraid. And that was in the days when she was happy, living with
  her aunt, Mrs. Tollis, at Hampstead."</p>

  <p>"When she was happy!" Mr. Mostyn caught those words. "Hasn't she been
  supposed to be happy while she's been at Leppard Hall?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all, sir. Everyone says that. The young lady's always wanted to
  get away. She's hated the place."</p>

  <p>"She's never made any mystery of that. That's why she's marrying me, and
  she told me so flatly. You don't think it's more than a girl's whims or
  fancy?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir. It's so very difficult to find out. You know the young
  lady better than I do." Flasket stared downwards decorously. "She's thought
  wild."</p>

  <p>"I don't care what you say, Flasket, it's important for me to know."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Some of them think she's a little unsettled in her wits,
  unbalanced in her mind, especially since her illness. She was always
  different, I take it, when she was in the company of this Mr. Delaunay. They
  used to ride together, visit the estate. And when he was working with her
  brother, and that kind of thing, sharpening the pens, acting as a secretary,
  as you might say, sir. Then, from what I can hear, she seemed happy."</p>

  <p>"Well, she seems happy enough now," said Mr. Mostyn, seating himself again
  in front of the dressing-table while the bodyservant brought out the long
  fine linen cravat and began to wind it round his throat.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. But if you'll pardon me, sir, that's thought to be but a
  passing craze, this distilling and all this housewifery. She never had any
  interest in it before. And the room, sir, in which she's working adjoins that
  in which she found the clothes, all the things that old Toby Peach saw
  burned."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose there's anything in any of it," mused Mr. Mostyn with a
  frown on the brow that was usually so smooth, "nothing to upset any plans of
  mine. But I must confess that I think the 'place is melancholy and it is the
  prospect of a swingeing fortune that's kept me here."</p>

  <p>"I don't like it myself, sir," agreed the servant, "I shall be glad when
  we return to town."</p>

  <p>"That won't be yet, my poor fellow, I can assure you. Things can't be
  hurried. I shall go and see Miss Laura in her room and try to find out what's
  in her mind. Perhaps she's heard some old story and is brooding on it. She's
  a rather strange creature, very high-spirited and shrewd, you know, Flasket,
  but with moods. Yes, I can understand that she had fits of melancholy when
  she was a child..."</p>

  <p>He turned this prospect over in his mind.</p>

  <p>Eccentricities, Flasket had said. Perhaps the man did not like to repeat
  that he had been told there was insanity in the Sarelle family. Would it
  matter? He, Harry Mostyn, would have to take the name, the estate and Laura
  as a wife. Well, it would be worth it. A fortune like that would go far to
  solace a man, even for a wife who was unsettled in her wits. And if they had
  children&mdash;well, a hundred to one the children would take after him, not
  after their mother. These fancies were no concern of his, save in so far as
  they balked his immediate designs.</p>

  <p>He stood up, a fine, handsome figure in his correct evening attire, the
  black coat with the well-cut tails, frills on the broad bosom of the shirt,
  cravat, pointed collar, well-trimmed glossy hair and whiskers, tight
  trousers, elegantly cut and strapped under the feet. He surveyed himself with
  a certain satisfaction; he had always found a naive pleasure in his own good
  looks.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he added as an afterthought, "do you hear anything of this Mrs.
  Avershaw? I don't know why the name sticks in my mind. I think I'm getting
  infected with the place, too. It's a thing I shouldn't have thought of twice
  in London, that story I heard in Warwick."</p>

  <p>"No, sir, you are mistaken there. There is no Madam Avershaw buried either
  in the church or in the churchyard. No one knows the name here at
  Leppard."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, I suppose that fool at Warwick was telling me lies. What does
  it matter?&mdash;it's of no moment."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>When Mr. Mostyn went down to dinner that evening he felt in a better mood,
  for he was possessed of a certain power. The knowledge that he had gained
  from Flasket was like a secret weapon. He did know these people far better as
  a result of the servant's prying. He had heard many little anecdotes of the
  behaviour of Sir Theodosius and of Laura Sarelle; he knew, even, what had
  been gathered of the doctor's report on the young baronet's health. And then
  his knowledge of this possible love story&mdash;all that was very useful.</p>

  <p>He leaned back in his chair, covered with the gleaming brocade, and looked
  across the branch of wax candles at Laura, who was sitting near the
  fireplace. She was, after her usual habit, far too richly dressed for a
  family party in a country house. Her gown of opal-coloured silk reflected the
  flames in long shimmers of reddish light. Thick lace in the design of cobwebs
  and roses was over her bosom, her dark hair was caught with little combs of
  corral. She looked very pretty, too, the calculating lover thought, quite
  enchanting with her precise features, her dark sparkling eyes, and the
  flush&mdash;not unlike the flush of fever&mdash;in her cheeks.</p>

  <p>He had not been able, greatly to his chagrin, to oblige her in the matter
  of the portraits. Sir Theodosius had proved unexpectedly obstinate on that
  point. On no account would he have the two pictures moved, his principal
  reason being, so far as Mr. Mostyn could discover, that Laura had asked for
  them to be taken away. He had emphasized that the girl was wilful and must
  not be humoured.</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn, good-natured, tolerant, and tactful, had been irritated by
  this obstinacy, and especially as he had wished to go to Laura and tell her
  that he had been able to secure her a favour.</p>

  <p>But nothing had been said for some weeks now about the portraits and he
  hoped she had forgotten them. He noticed she never glanced towards them. For
  himself, he was rather uncomfortably conscious of them; placed as they were
  at the end of the room, facing down the table, they sometimes seemed to him
  as if they were two people seated at that part of the board, which was always
  empty. The candlelight would catch the carnation, especially in the portrait
  of the man, which was beautifully painted, and seemed to give it the glow of
  living flesh, and the dark eyes would appear in the flicker of the flame to
  move and question, the ruddy lips part with a sneering smile, while the more
  poorly painted picture of the girl in her primrose silk would be also
  affected by the light and shade and appear to turn into a pale and wavering
  apparition standing there in a bewildered way at the head of the board as if
  looking for her place.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn, who had never before been affected by any kind of
  superstitious fears, found himself reflecting uncomfortably that this house
  was exactly at it had been when those pictures were painted and their
  originals were moving about. It was all very handsome, of course, and in the
  best style. But, for himself, he would have it all altered when he was master
  here.</p>

  <p>For the first time the thought came into his mind: 'I wonder how soon I
  shall be master?'</p>

  <p>He looked away from Laura, with her bewitching prettiness&mdash;she was
  gay to-night and laughing a good deal at the foolish talk passing between her
  and Hetty Sylk&mdash;to the head of the table where the young baronet sat in
  the great chair of purple velvet padding with arms scrolled up in the back
  into the carved arms of the Sarelles with their motto beneath, and the
  goshawks above.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn had entered on this match out of entirely self-interested
  motives, but he had never before admitted to himself that he had been
  directly calculating on a speedy accession to the Sarelle states. No, such a
  thing had never occurred to him His future brother-in-law was a young man,
  and he put all that into the distance&mdash;why, of course, when one thought
  of it, it was absurd. He was a man of nearly forty years of age, the baronet
  was but twenty-four. Yet it had come to him, as now, as if someone had
  whispered the words in his ear: 'When shall I be master here?' And he found
  himself gazing intently at the young man, marking his thin, almost hollow
  cheeks, the shadows under his eyes, the narrow chest, the thin hands that
  rested on the table.</p>

  <p>Surely the man was seriously ill, doomed to die young. A surge of
  triumphant pleasure shook Mr. Mostyn.</p>

  <p>Afraid that his feelings might show in his eyes, he turned them hastily
  away and found them held, as it were, by the gaze of the young man in the
  portrait. It seemed to him as if that bright and earnest face was looking at
  him, trying to speak, trying to impress some emotion on him, to convey
  something to him. The impression was as forcible as if somebody had suddenly
  gripped him by the shoulder or the wrist.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn lowered his glance to his plate. To steady himself he remarked
  of how exquisite a porcelain it was made and how delicately ringed with
  painted fruit. A sudden revulsion of feeling sickened him. Never before had
  he realized that his plan to marry Laura Sarelle was essentially base. After
  all, it was a usual arrangement for a man, who had himself something to offer
  in the way of position, to marry a woman much younger than himself with a
  large fortune and use that to relieve his own embarrassment.</p>

  <p>'I'm going to take the damned name,' he said to himself. 'That seems to
  mean a lot to the young man.'</p>

  <p>But he was uneasy, baffled, confused, caught out in a secret villainy, as
  it seemed to him, and urged on by the contemplation of a yet greater
  villainy. The hundred thousand pounds that would come to him with Laura now
  seemed as nothing. It was the house he wanted, the estate. He, who had
  hitherto been a wanderer, who had largely lived in hotels and furnished
  houses and never cared anything for the property in Jamaica from which he had
  derived his money, now felt a lust for the possession of the buildings, the
  soil on which they stood, parkland, acres, even the old mill, the
  mausoleum&mdash;he wanted to own them.</p>

  <p>He looked at the motto cut about the chair-back, that twisted in a dark
  line above the dark bent head of Sir Theodosius: "One like another." It was
  doggerel, it had no meaning.</p>

  <p>He put his hand to his forehead and leaned back in his own chair. Sir
  Theodosius said something to him, but Harry Mostyn did not hear, it. He
  murmured some non-committal reply.</p>

  <p>The light chatter of the women went on. Laura seemed excited underneath
  her foolish gaiety. Hetty Sylk, Mr. Mostyn thought as he looked at her
  furtively, appeared uneasy, embarrassed. Only social tact enabled her to keep
  the conversation going.</p>

  <p>Sir Theodosius rose. He said that he would not go into the
  withdrawing-room that night but would return to his library, where he had
  some work to finish.</p>

  <p>"You should employ a secretary," said Mr. Mostyn, with an effort after his
  usual courteous address, "for these musty labours."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said the young man with great irritation. "I have had several
  applications. I must go to London to interview the applicants. My papers are
  in a bad confusion, but I would rather labour alone than with someone whom I
  do not trust."</p>

  <p>"Your former secretary, who was the steward too, a wonder of a fellow I
  should think. Mr. Delaunay? A pity you lost him."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn was not quite sure that this challenge was wise, or even
  discreet. He had a little lost his self-control and did not know why, the
  words seemed forced out of him. 'After all,' he said to himself
  uncomfortably, 'it will test whether what Flasket said was true.'</p>

  <p>Yes, it was true. Laura stopped talking. She was looking at him across the
  table with narrow eyes of enmity, while Sir Theodosius said with an
  exasperation that he did not try to gloss over:</p>

  <p>"Delaunay was an obliging fellow, an old friend of mine, but he played me
  false. He was quite untrue to his charge. I don't wish him spoken of in this
  house, Harry. Pray understand that for the future."</p>

  <p>The elder man had to endure this rebuke, that seemed to him an
  impertinence. Well, he had found out what he wanted to know. He had seen Mrs.
  Sylk pressing her lips together and looking frightened. None of them was
  clever at concealing a secret.</p>

  <p>He did not like the expression on Laura's face. Not only did it seem to
  him to confirm Flasket's story, that she had once been willing to accept
  Lucius Delaunay as suitor, it seemed to mean that she still had far too great
  an interest in him.</p>

  <p>'I must find out something about him,' thought Harry Mostyn. 'He seems
  kept at arm's length.' Aloud, in an attempt to cover the situation, that was
  more painful than any that had yet arisen since he had been at Leppard Hall,
  he asked the girl if she would show him her distillery.</p>

  <p>"At this hour of night?" said Laura flippantly. "I don't suppose there's a
  fire in the room, it will be cold. Besides, you're not interested in such
  things, are you, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I'm interested in everything you do, Laura. You spend a great deal of
  your time up there. You give me very little of your company. If I joined you
  in your pursuit I might see a little more of you."</p>

  <p>He bent towards the girl with the flattering air that he knew so well how
  to assume and that seldom failed in its effect on women. She seemed to scorn
  this attractive lure and lifted her lip in a way that irritated him
  greatly.</p>

  <p>"Very well, you may come upstairs. Mrs. Sylk, won't you come too? But
  first we will go into the withdrawing-room for a little while. They must
  light a fire, you know."</p>

  <p>"I wish you were something of a scholar, Mostyn," complained Theodosius in
  a heavy tone; "you might come into the library and help me."</p>

  <p>"What little Latin I ever knew I've forgotten, and I never was any good at
  Greek," smiled Mr. Mostyn. He was sorry himself that he did not possess these
  accomplishments that would have enabled him to get even more firm a hold over
  the young baronet "But you know I will do anything in my power to help you,"
  he added earnestly and with a real sincerity. "I'll go up to London if you
  like and find someone. There must be plenty of starving scholars about only
  too thankful for such a post."</p>

  <p>"I'll think of it," replied Sir Theodosius more graciously. He seldom
  failed to respond to the flattering advances made by Harry Mostyn. "You've
  been a great help with the estate. That makes me lazy; I must find another
  steward, too. Nothing's been done with the estate, save what you've done,
  since Erskine went."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's only a matter of a week or two. You've been having an
  accountant in often enough from Warwick. The place almost runs itself."</p>

  <p>This, Harry Mostyn afterwards felt, was the wrong thing to have said,
  because Laura put in with a cool, baffling air:</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's because of the two years of good work that Lucius Delaunay
  put into it. He was an excellent steward. Theo will never find one like him
  again, to help both in the library and on the estate."</p>

  <p>With that she left the room with a burst of laughter, hanging on to the
  arm of Mrs. Sylk, whose fright seemed intensified.</p>

  <p>"Who was this Mr. Delaunay, this Lucius?" asked Harry Mostyn easily.</p>

  <p>The baronet rose from the table and came to the fire, standing there
  rubbing his hands together as if his blood was chilled, although the flames
  were giving out a strong and steady heat.</p>

  <p>"My dear Harry," replied the young man, "it was only a few moments ago I
  said the name was not to be mentioned in this house again."</p>

  <p>"Forgive, me! I'm curious. I shouldn't have thought you were a man to
  harbour petty resentment. What could the fellow have done that so offended
  you, an old friend too?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you he betrayed me. I dare say you think that sounds like the
  playhouse or an old tragedy, but it happens in real life, you know. One does
  get betrayed. One trusts, and is deceived."</p>

  <p>"He wasn't honest?" Harry Mostyn, though he knew it might be to his own
  disadvantage, could not forbear from probing the matter. "The accounts
  perhaps? Stewards have strong temptations."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of that kind," replied Sir Theo with sudden heat. "Leave the
  matter, Harry. I never want to see Delaunay again, and I don't suppose I
  shall. He's in Ireland with his relatives."</p>

  <p>"And he's never been back here since?"</p>

  <p>"Why, no, he left at a few hours' notice."</p>

  <p>"You haven't met him in London either?"</p>

  <p>"Why, no again. Yet, why are you questioning me?"</p>

  <p>"Only because I am to marry your sister, take the name, manage your place,
  Theo. I've a deep interest in all that concerns you."</p>

  <p>This was said with befitting dignity, and Sir Theo seemed satisfied.</p>

  <p>After the shortest possible delay Harry Mostyn joined the ladies in the
  great withdrawing-room that looked very pleasant with lustrous brocade and
  satin and its light charming pictures in crayon and water-colours.</p>

  <p>And very charming too looked Laura Sarelle. She had a violet jacket with a
  big collar of white fur, which she had put over her opal-coloured silk dress,
  and seemed now quite excited at the prospect of showing her new toys, as she
  thought of them, to her future husband.</p>

  <p>As she was kinder to him than she had been for some time, his spirits
  rose. Perhaps after all she was going to be more malleable than he had
  expected. Perhaps also he was going to like her a little better than he had
  expected. He tried to dwell upon her pleasing features and forget her shrewd
  spirit, her eccentric ways, her occasionally wild laughter, tried to forget
  what was to him, after all, her most objectionable habit&mdash;her reminding
  him now and then of the fact that she knew he was after her fortune and not
  her person.</p>

  <p>How she had picked up such worldly knowledge he could not guess. Someone
  must have been indiscreet in her presence. Perhaps that Mrs. Hetty Sylk, whom
  he much distrusted.</p>

  <p>When they supposed that the fire had burned up sufficiently to warm the
  room they went up the beautiful shallow staircase of gleaming amber-coloured
  wood and reached, on the second floor, the rooms that Laura Sarelle had
  lately made her own.</p>

  <p>These consisted of a large chamber looking on the front of the house, with
  a smaller closet attached. Remembering Flasket's story, Harry Mostyn entered
  this room with some curiosity. He thought that he might find it completely
  stripped, but no, evidently it was the smaller articles only that had fed the
  bonfire that old Toby Peach had helped to turn over with his pitchfork.</p>

  <p>The candles, as well as the fire, had been lit and the room was, in
  outward seeming, a handsome and a pleasant apartment. The shutters were
  closed over the window and in front of them hung curtains of a plain green
  serge. The walls were panelled from floor to ceiling, which itself had a
  handsome design in plaster. This panelling and the oak boards of the floor
  had lately been cleaned and polished. The fire burned on an open hearth and
  there was a chimney-piece of white marble fairly carved with cypress
  leaves.</p>

  <p>The fireplace directly faced the door, the window was at the left, and to
  the right was a single bed with a four-posted tester without any furniture or
  draperies. A small cabinet of inlaid wood stood beside this, in the
  window-place was an elegant bureau with a green baize top, and at the foot of
  the bed was a large chair with arms. There was no other furniture in the
  room.</p>

  <p>Laura crossed it immediately to a door that was directly opposite the one
  that opened on to the stairway. In her shimmering silk and with her bright
  air she seemed to catch and give forth again all the light that was in the
  room.</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn followed her through the inner door and found himself in what
  she termed the closet, but was really a fair-sized room, which had been
  fitted up as a distillery. There was the still and all the paraphernalia,
  including a small oven. It looked, Mr. Mostyn thought, like one of the old
  prints of an alchemist's cell. But, of course, it had a different and modern
  air owing to the shape of the room, the panelled walls, the straight window
  in which hung a long green serge curtain similar to that in the bedchamber.
  And, oddly enough, there was in this room a small bed also, but without a
  tester and completely unfurnished, merely the wooden frame.</p>

  <p>The rest of the furniture consisted but of a chair and a table, some
  shelves on which stood various chemist's pots of Delft and Italian
  majolica.</p>

  <p>Although Laura Sarelle had of late spent so many of her hours there, the
  place had an amateur and a neglected look, as if somebody had begun to
  experiment and tired of it; pots and glasses were dirty, books were piled in
  disorder.</p>

  <p>In fact, Mr. Mostyn found it all inexpressibly dreary, and it was in vain
  that he tried to give a light air to the occasion by gaily questioning Laura
  about her work.</p>

  <p>She showed him one or two phials and jars that she had filled with liquids
  and ointments and old volumes of recipes that she was experimenting with.
  Mrs. Sylk joined them and the three talked together in the conventional way
  about the interest of Laura's new pastime.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Mostyn felt uneasy. Something was deadly wrong with the place.
  Both the large and small rooms were to him full of something intangibly
  gloomy, sad and evil. If there was a ghost in Leppard Hall this surely was
  its most secret haunt. But what was he thinking about? He put his hand to his
  mouth in a bewildered way. There had never been any talk of a ghost, only
  that fool of an innkeeper at Warwick who said that Madam Avershaw haunted the
  churchyard, and Flasket, who was shrewd enough in his questioning, had found
  that no such person was buried there.</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn tried to make an effort over himself. He knew that Laura
  ought to be taken away from this place. The sooner he married her and took
  her away the better. He wished that it might be next week, to-morrow, that he
  could secure both the girl and the money and be rid of this infernal Leppard
  Hall&mdash;yes, the word that came into his mind was "infernal".</p>

  <p>But he must be careful. The shrewd, prudent part of him soon had his
  wilder impulses in check. If he tried to hurry on the marriage, force
  matters, take the girl away before she was twenty-one years of age, there
  would be questioning, trouble, suspicions on the part of the brother. There
  were his own embarrassed affairs to think of. When it came to the matter of
  the settlement he would have to disclose those, and he did not want to do
  that until it was impossible for Sir Theodosius to draw back.</p>

  <p>All this was passing through his mind as he examined Laura's jars, smelt
  her perfumes, essences, and looked at the little still in the distillery.</p>

  <p>"Who," he asked, with a great effort at ease and pleasantry, "had this
  place fixed up? A strange thing, it seems to have been a bedroom."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I don't know, I can't find out. Someone slept in the other room, and
  someone else in here, I think. Or else the bed was put up for a watcher,
  somebody who sat over the retort all night. I don't know." Laura's face
  looked puzzled. Her eyes had an intent expression, and she frowned. "That's
  something I'm trying to find out. That's why I come here so often. Sometimes
  it seems as if I am about to be told the whole story, as if it were really
  being whispered in my ear. And then it goes again."</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn looked at her sharply. He remembered his own unpleasant
  experience of a few hours before when, seated at the dinner-table, the
  thought had come into his mind exactly as Laura now said, as if somebody had
  whispered in his ear: 'When will you be master here?'</p>

  <p>He gave a smile that he knew was sickly, and taking the girl by the elbow
  tried to turn her away from the still, that stood there with the bed of lime
  at the bottom.</p>

  <p>"How long has the room been like this? Let's go, I think it has a musty
  air."</p>

  <p>"Oh no," said Laura, "I have the windows open in the daytime and fires
  burning at night. This closet is rather cold, there is no fireplace, but the
  warmth comes in from the outer chamber. A pity the hangings are gone. When I
  first came here they were all in their places, on the tester and at the
  windows. Fine embroideries at that. There were coverlets and mattresses,
  folded up in that box under the bed. They took everything away, and the chest
  of clothes&mdash;that was burnt too. It was there I found my yellow dress,
  you know, the dress worn by the girl in the portrait&mdash;the other Laura
  Sarelle. Perhaps she slept in this room, do you think so? Perhaps she died
  here, do you think that?"</p>

  <p>She turned with a sudden movement that had, he thought, something
  unpleasantly snakelike about it, and peered into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you could easily find out," he said, with a deepening of his
  smile, yet keeping a strong grip on himself in order not to say something
  that would either exasperate or alarm her; he knew that Mrs. Sylk was looking
  at them both with a frightened air. He thought: 'My God, I'll find out what's
  the matter with this place! I'll take this woman away, or give her up!'</p>

  <p>"There were a great many papers here, too," continued Laura. She drooped
  her lids now and was speaking in a musing tone&mdash;almost, he thought, like
  someone in a trance. He had seen some hypnotic, or animal, magnetism in
  experiments once in Brussels, and he remembered that the people under the
  influence of the mesmerist had spoken much as Laura was speaking now. "Yes,"
  she said, "there were some papers, packets of them, but I was so excited at
  finding the dress that I did not stop to look. And afterwards, after my
  illness, when I came back up here again, everything was gone. Theo had them
  taken away. I wonder why?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose it was nothing but rubbish," put in Mrs. Sylk nervously. "You
  know if there had been anything important Sir Theo would have kept it."</p>

  <p>"Would he? I don't think he even had them looked at. We couldn't find out
  much about it, could we, Mrs. Sylk? You see, most of the servants had been
  changed when I was ill, and those who were still here wouldn't talk."</p>

  <p>"There was nothing in it at all," said Mrs. Sylk hurriedly, glancing
  sideways at Harry Mostyn. "Indeed, I assure you, sir, there was nothing in
  it, naught but a lot of old rubbish, some dresses falling to pieces, and
  trinkets, and some old shoes and a parasol. And a little picture Sir Theo
  sold in London."</p>

  <p>"And a man's hat," added Laura. "Something like the hat the man wears in
  the portrait downstairs. Black, gallooned with gold, turned up with a
  cockade, and the name inside was Avershaw."</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn had a sense of shock; odd, he thought, on so trifling a
  matter; he tried to persuade himself that Laura was not speaking the truth
  and that she had either read his mind or been making inquiries about a man of
  this name. He said, with as much steadiness as he could muster:</p>

  <p>"Are you sure of that, Laura? That name has never been associated with
  this house."</p>

  <p>Her answer confirmed his suspicions.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure of nothing," she said, in a heavy, drugged tone. "I thought that
  was the name."</p>

  <p>"I don't think there was a hat," said Mrs. Sylk hastily. "It was all
  feminine attire. This was a woman's room, and I don't think the other
  Sarelles lived here. I don't know, but it's the great bedroom, is it not? And
  no one but the ruling Sarelle and his wife would have it. That which you
  have," she added, speaking incoherently, "is much pleasanter. Come, dear, you
  know, your room and mine, and the charming parlour that goes with
  them&mdash;perhaps those are the principal bedrooms on the first floor. Laura
  Sarelle was the mistress of the house as you are, she wouldn't have slept up
  here. I expect those boxes of clothes were just put up here out of the
  way."</p>

  <p>"Avershaw," repeated Laura. "Edward Avershaw! No, perhaps I'm wrong.
  Perhaps it was an old book I saw it in. I don't know either. Perhaps I'm
  dreaming. One does dream when one's alone. I never can be sure of my
  dreams."</p>

  <p>"Day-dreams," said Mr. Mostyn, with a smile of relief. Of course, that was
  where the girl, fanciful and half bewitched as she seemed to be, had seen the
  name...in some old book, some account of the trial. There must be those
  about, although the landlord at Warwick had said the tale had been "hushed
  up". Mr. Mostyn thought that he would himself make a few inquiries in the
  neighbourhood. It was not so long ago, and there might even be people living
  who remembered the affair.</p>

  <p>'But why trouble?' something in his mind said to him. 'Why concern
  yourself? Marry the girl and get the money and go away. This old, heavy,
  weary tale is nothing to do with you.'</p>

  <p>But he felt that it was something to do with him, that it was creeping
  over him, hedging him in, hemming him about, and again he had that impression
  of some grave peril of the mind.</p>

  <p>"It's cold in here," he said; "it's a dreary place in which to spend your
  time."</p>

  <p>He spoke in sincere sympathy, for he felt sorry for the girl and wanted to
  take her away from Leppard Hall, not altogether for his own sake and because
  of her money.</p>

  <p>"Can't you persuade Theo to take you to London? He is not well here,
  either. Too many mists, it's no better than a marsh, and so near the
  river."</p>

  <p>"You can see the river," said Laura eagerly, "in the daytime. I wonder why
  they hung those ugly green curtains? There were handsome ones that I saw here
  first. If you look out of the room you can see the river, and the churchyard.
  If anybody was moving about among the graves you could see them from here; if
  a ghost was there at night, a spectre, you could see it from here on a
  moonlit night."</p>

  <p>And she gave a laugh and, turning from the man, took Mrs. Sylk's arm. That
  affrighted woman began to upbraid her clumsily:</p>

  <p>"Really, Laura, you talk like a child, as if you had been bemused with
  fairy-tales and fables. Let us go out of this room. I think you spend too
  much time here. You know there is a distillery near the kitchen where you
  could make your simples if you wish."</p>

  <p>"But I like this place," said Laura. "It's where I must come. Don't you
  understand? I've got to come here."</p>

  <p>She broke off and turned to the man.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to see the view from this window, Harry?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I suppose, my dear Laura," he replied, "it's the same as all the
  views from all the windows at the front of Leppard Hall."</p>

  <p>"It always seems to be different from these two windows," insisted
  Laura.</p>

  <p>And nothing would quiet her but that he must unfasten the shutters, after
  having drawn the loose curtains, and look out into the winter night.</p>

  <p>The moon was rising behind the church, which was outlined dark, blurred as
  to detail, beyond the water-meadows. The river sparkled cold and the whole
  landscape had a lifeless look. The trees made the faintest tracery against a
  sky that was lightly clouded; all was chill, melancholy, sombre.</p>

  <p>But Laura leaned out, regardless of the bitter night air, and gazed with
  what seemed an intense eagerness and even pleasure at this desolate prospect.
  It took the persuasions of both Mr. Mostyn and Hetty Sylk to draw her away
  from the window, to allow them to close it and to lead her from the room
  after having pulled the bellrope to summon the servants to extinguish the
  candles and the fire.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>In her own room, Laura, greatly to Mrs. Sylk's relief, did not talk of the
  two chambers she had just left, which seemed lately to have filled her
  imagination, but of Harry Mostyn.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't care for me, Mrs. Sylk," she said, with something of a sigh.
  "You think so, too. You are sure it's only my money he's after."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't put it like that, I think that sounds rather vulgar," said
  Mrs. Sylk, raising her hands to her head as if trying to smooth the
  frightened lines from her forehead. "He's very amiable, he's made himself
  greatly liked here. Of course, he's too old for you. But we women don't know
  about men's vices or even much about their faults until we marry them. And
  perhaps not much then. I think he'll make you a good husband."</p>

  <p>"He wants the money, I can understand that. Mr. Spryce nearly told me so;
  he almost warned me against him."</p>

  <p>'Ah, that's where you got that idea!' thought Mrs. Sylk. She had wondered
  how Laura had been shrewd and worldly enough to suspect Harry Mostyn of being
  a fortune-hunter. "Well, dear Laura, I'm sure he's fond of you and admires
  you. How could it be otherwise? You're sweet and lovely and charming."</p>

  <p>"Oh no! I'm often wild and wilful and difficult."</p>

  <p>"But he's very tender with you. He puts up even with your worst moods,
  dear."</p>

  <p>"He does now, but do you think he always will? Will he give me my way?
  Will he take me from Leppard Hall, soon?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure he will. He doesn't like the place himself, one can see
  that."</p>

  <p>"No, that's what makes me think he's after the money. He doesn't like the
  place, as you say, but he's going to take our name, keep it on, all to please
  Theo. Why is that?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I suppose it's because of his love for you, Laura darling. Why not?
  We may as well give the affair a romantic turn!"</p>

  <p>Laura did not answer. Suddenly she threw off the purple jacket with the
  white fur collar.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could understand more about him Did he come along to be my
  saviour? Do I like him or hate him? Sometimes I detest him, Mrs. Sylk. At
  other times he seems the only person round here I can endure. Everything's
  gone wrong so far, do you think it will ever go right?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk could not answer this question. She was herself troubled and
  bewildered. She had given much thought to this question of the proposed
  marriage between Harry Mostyn and Laura Sarelle, and on the whole she thought
  it would be a good thing for the girl, though no doubt there were many
  disadvantages. But then she had not led the normal life of girls of her age
  and station and fortune. She had not been taken about and given a chance for
  people to see her, perhaps a chance of making her own choice. She had been
  kept away in this unnatural life. Yes, all things considered, it was as well
  that Harry Mostyn had come along. Mrs. Sylk did not know the worst of him,
  his debts and difficulties, for he kept up a good show. She did not know some
  of the unpleasant stories that were whispered about him in the clubs and on
  the racecourses, nor of the women of poor repute with whom his name had been
  associated. And so, anxious and rather simple creature as she was, and only
  fumbling her way, as it were, at the edges of her story, she thought that it
  would be a fortunate thing for Laura to marry Harry Mostyn.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>When the Christmas festivities, which were celebrated without much gaiety
  at Leppard Hall, were over, Harry Mostyn took an early opportunity of waiting
  on the vicar at the old parsonage beside the church.</p>

  <p>He went with much the same purpose in his mind as Lucius Delaunay had gone
  to the same place about eighteen months before; now the garden was
  winter-bitten and a sparse fire of oak logs burnt in the humble grate.</p>

  <p>Like Lucius, he had to wait for the parson a while in the shabbily
  furnished library, and, like him, he turned at once to that part of the shelf
  that bore books containing histories and pamphlets on local archaeology and
  folklore. But, unlike Lucius, he was not lucky, his hand did not light on the
  small volume that contained the history of the life and trial of Captain
  Edward Avershaw.</p>

  <p>So his curiosity was totally unsatisfied when the Reverend Nathaniel Mist
  at length received him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn was at his most genial. He had met the parson before at the
  parsonage, because he wished to be friends with everyone on the estate, even
  though he had at once made up his mind that when he was master there the
  living should go to a younger, more alert man&mdash;at least, if he, Mr.
  Harry Mostyn, was to come there but even for the hunting season.</p>

  <p>Now he led the conversation round by easy stages to what he wanted to
  know. The first pertinent question he posed was:</p>

  <p>"Is anyone by the name of Madam Avershaw&mdash;I don't know the Christian
  name&mdash;buried in your church?"</p>

  <p>The vicar adjusted his spectacles, that were square and had silver rims.
  He gave his visitor a quizzical look as if he was used to this kind of
  curiosity and knew how to deal with it.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," he said, "anyone of any importance who is buried in the
  church or the churchyard has a tablet there. I suppose you've seen
  those?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've looked for the mural inscription, but there's none of that
  name."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, there's none of that name buried in the church or the
  churchyard. The nameless ones are poor peasants, labourers&mdash;I suppose
  it's not about them you make inquiry?"</p>

  <p>"No, it's the wife of a certain Captain Edward Avershaw, who, as I
  understand, was hanged in Warwick about sixty years ago."</p>

  <p>"Why, if I may ask, should such an ugly story concern you? Your visit,
  surely, is of the most agreeable nature? I understand you are betrothed to
  Miss Laura Sarelle."</p>

  <p>"That is so," replied the florid gentleman easily, "and I really couldn't
  tell you why this local tale made any impression on me at all. I suppose it's
  because there's nothing to do here, life is so monotonous, one day so like
  another, the least thing stays in the mind. It is also, my dear sir, I must
  confess, a most melancholy place."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps that is because you are used to London, and its clubs, or
  Newmarket and its racecourses. You yourself told me that these are your usual
  haunts," smiled the vicar, polishing his glasses again.</p>

  <p>"I've been trying to persuade Sir Theo to let me take him and Laura back
  to town. You must confess, although I suppose you are enamoured of the
  neighbourhood, that it is gloomy enough in the winter."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so&mdash;the river overflows in here&mdash;up to the graves
  sometimes&mdash;but I'm used to what you might call the rhythm of the place.
  I feel the pulse of Nature, her breath, you know, sir, going in and out, even
  in the winter. It's not dead to me."</p>

  <p>"It's not exactly dead to me," said Mr. Mostyn dryly. "It's rather too
  much alive. I feel it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Haunted?" put in the Reverend Nathaniel Mist, with a wide, loose smile
  that showed his broken teeth. "Well, I suppose there are ghosts in every part
  of this old land of ours. Where will you find a single name that didn't boast
  a spectre?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, I never went into the matter before. I don't believe in
  these children's tales, I don't say I do now. The only ghost I've heard of is
  this Madam Avershaw. Some fool in Warwick said she walked&mdash;that's an
  ordinary expression, isn't it&mdash;walked? But used of the dead it's
  gruesome enough."</p>

  <p>"In the churchyard, I suppose?" said the vicar, with what seemed a sneer.
  "Well, it's easy to imagine one sees a ghost walking in the churchyard when
  the moon is shining. Is that all you came to see me about?"</p>

  <p>"I came to enjoy your company," replied Mr. Mostyn with great affability.
  "There's not much society round here, and unfortunately I'm not like my
  predecessor, Mr. Delaunay&mdash;I'm not able to help Sir Theo with his
  books." He added graciously, yet abruptly and emphatically: "Were you a
  friend of his, this Mr. Delaunay, my predecessor?"</p>

  <p>"Your predecessor?" questioned the vicar.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm acting as Sir Theo's steward. Everything is in excellent
  condition, there's not much to do. Well, Erskine's only been gone a few
  weeks. He was a good man, too."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think Lucius Delaunay did very well indeed. He had no pastimes or
  distractions, save helping Sir Theo with his books. They were college
  friends, you know. Why are you curious about him?"</p>

  <p>"My dear sir!" Harry Mostyn made a deprecating gesture. "I'm not curious.
  I must talk about something. I'm cut off from all my usual interests. I heard
  the man mentioned. It seems there was some trouble and drama about his
  leaving, it was very sudden. Strange, too, for old friends to break off like
  that. The fellow must have been very useful to Sir Theo."</p>

  <p>"I don't know why he went," said the vicar mildly. "There was some
  disagreement, perhaps some quarrel. Sir Theo's not an easy man to live
  with."</p>

  <p>"Was Mr. Delaunay?" questioned Mr. Mostyn.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, yes, I think so. Irish, you know, romantic perhaps, but not hasty
  at all, or violent, not boastful or arrogant. A quiet man, and," added the
  vicar with what seemed a touch of malice, "handsome in his person. About
  twenty-seven years of age."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Mr. Mostyn smiled thoughtfully. "And he's not been here since, or
  had any communication with the Sarelles?"</p>

  <p>"He has not returned to Leppard, sir, certainly. I'm in a central position
  in the village, I should have, known if he had come to the Hall, but how
  should I know if he has communicated with Sir Theo or with any member of his
  household? It doesn't concern me, sir, I assure you. And I should not have
  thought that it would concern you either. Eighteen months ago, a year and a
  half&mdash;and that's a long time in a young girl's life."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say," asked Harry Mostyn softly, "a young girl's life, sir? We
  haven't been discussing any ladies."</p>

  <p>"No, but I've said that Mr. Delaunay was romantic, and I was thinking of
  the stories there were about the place. That he had an affection for a lady
  here, and, because of that, offered for her hand, was refused, and so left.
  That's all."</p>

  <p>"He offered for Miss Sarelle, I suppose?' said Mr. Mostyn coolly.</p>

  <p>"If you have heard that you must have been listening to gossip, sir,"
  replied the vicar slyly.</p>

  <p>"One can't help hearing gossip," retorted the town gentleman, "in a place
  like this. What does it matter, it was an absurd proposal."</p>

  <p>"Not so absurd, in my opinion. Mr. Delaunay was very well born, of Lord
  Belmont's family. I think he might have given her what she needs, a true and
  strong affection."</p>

  <p>"I hope to give her that, as you know, sir," smiled Mr. Mostyn, who
  refused to be ruffled. He believed that he could obtain no further
  information from the old man, who seemed sometimes intelligent and sometimes
  stupid but probably always crafty and playing a part.</p>

  <p>So the florid gentleman made some excuse and took his leave, turning up
  the collar of his greatcoat as he went into the wintry garden, where the air,
  that seemed thickened by the cold, blew in bitter eddies from the river.</p>

  <p>An impulse that he did not greatly like indulging, but that was not to be
  resisted, made him turn up the avenue of stumpy trees, now leafless, that
  edged the path through the graveyard to the church door. The graves, wet with
  the winter rains and snow, were of the colour of the ground from which they
  rose, and the church too was dun-hued, like old moss or lichen. Inside the
  neglected building it was very cold; Mr. Mostyn had entered it on Sundays
  only when the stoves were lit, but now he shivered.</p>

  <p>He walked round looking at the mural tablets, thinking perhaps he had
  overlooked one with the name of Avershaw...Why, in the name of sanity, did he
  concern himself with all this childish nonsense? But he went on, and paused
  before the garish marble dedicated to the memory of Laura Sarelle, with the
  two laurel boughs in low bas-relief, one either side her name. He looked up,
  too, at the funeral hatchment, the complicated quarterings with the arms of
  the Sarelles, and with, as it seemed to him, their foolish motto, "One like
  another".</p>

  <p>No, there was no Madam Avershaw buried there. But this concern with a
  local fable showed what the country did to a man's wits if he concerned
  himself with rustic chatter.</p>

  <p>Leaving the humped churchyard on the slight slope, he took the path round
  the river and glanced down through the tangle of broken weeds, sodden flags,
  leafless alders and other trash to the edge of the grey water. According to
  Flasket's story, it was somewhere here that Laura had slipped in those thin
  shoes. The sexton and another man&mdash;the vicar's gardener, was it
  not?&mdash;had taken her out...Poor child, with her mad fits...Everything she
  did was unusual, almost unnatural. When he had first heard that she was
  working at distilling, making her essences and pomades, it had seemed in him
  a fitting occupation for a young gentlewoman, but when he had seen the room
  in which she spent her time the whole affair had become blurred and crooked
  in his mind, distasteful and unpleasant.</p>

  <p>He thought: 'I ought to be master of this situation&mdash;that peevish
  young scholar; that wild girl; Mrs. Sylk, a paid dependant; the rest,
  servants; this old parson; that doctor, a most mediocre man, in Warwick. Who
  is there round here whom I can't deal with?'</p>

  <p>As he walked home across the sodden fields he had to confess he could not
  deal with Sir Theo. He could not persuade the young man to leave Leppard Hall
  and come to London. That would be the first step&mdash;to get him away from
  the place.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn paused in the midst of the parkland and looked up at the Hall.
  It seemed always so much larger than it really was, as if it loomed and
  blotted out the winter sky. A cloud of rooks rose in the winter air behind it
  and disappeared with a harsh cawing sound into the bare woods at the edge of
  the parkland, the woods where the mausoleum stood.</p>

  <p>As he entered the house the servant who went down to the village every day
  to fetch the post-bag was bringing this into the hall.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn waited. Sir Theo had the key and always unlocked the bag
  himself as befitted the master of Leppard, and Mr. Mostyn wished to get his
  correspondence as soon as possible; he knew that a good many of the letters
  he received would be bills, or worse than bills; some of them would be
  peremptory demands for money. And he did not wish to pay away any more money
  than he could help at present. He needed all of his income that he could
  command to keep up an appearance.</p>

  <p>So he went into the library, where the servant took the bag. Sir Theo was
  there and unlocked it, and laid the letters out upon the table. Before he had
  had time to sort or look at them, Hensloe, the accountant from Warwick,
  entered the room punctual to his appointment and Sir Theo turned to him. He
  had asked the man to wait on him that morning, as he wished, in a sudden
  access of business exactitude, to examine the accounts himself. It was,
  indeed, Mr. Mostyn who had urged him to do this; he was by no means unwilling
  to see in exact figures the revenue of the estate.</p>

  <p>While these two were talking Mr. Mostyn was turning over his letters.
  There were three for Laura Sarelle, and he glanced at them with the frank
  intention of discovering if any was written from Ireland. But no, all had the
  London postmark. So, as he never missed an opportunity of doing a little
  service for the girl or of putting himself in a pleasant attitude towards
  her, he took up the three letters with his own and went to the
  withdrawing-room, where he believed she would be, in order to give them to
  her personally.</p>

  <p>He found her there, sitting in the window-place with an open book on her
  knees, in a musing mood. He was rather vexed with her constant idleness, for
  she never seemed to have an occupation save when she was busy in her
  distillery. But he reminded himself what could a girl do in the country, save
  run round the cottages with baskets of fruit or bowls of soup? And it was
  quite unnecessary for her in a village where everyone seemed to be
  comfortably off to spend her time in ostentatious acts of charity.</p>

  <p>He gave her the letters and she took them, glancing at them with impassive
  eyes, then she leaned back in the chair and clasped her hands behind her
  head.</p>

  <p>"They are nothing," she said readily; "two from a mantuamaker and the
  third from a friend I had nearly forgotten. Are we going to ride this
  afternoon? The mist has cleared a little."</p>

  <p>"If you please," he agreed at once, willing to be of service, and glad,
  too, to leave the house.</p>

  <p>"And have you been able to persuade Theo to leave Leppard Hall?"</p>

  <p>"I am not able to persuade Theo to anything. You must do something now,
  Laura. He is an obstinate fellow, your brother. You must tell him that we
  want to be married soon. You'd like to see Venice, wouldn't you? Why, there's
  no winter, hardly at all, in Italy. In the middle of January, the flowers are
  now coming out, the cyclamen and the violets."</p>

  <p>"Your cyclamen and violets and your Italian sun 'don't tempt me as they
  once might have done," said Laura with a slow smile. Her lids had drooped
  over her eyes and there was such a gleam in them that the man, inexperienced
  as he was, felt startled. He remembered Flasket's hint of lunacy in the
  family. He turned very uneasily to the fireplace.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll see what I can do with your brother. He's got the accountant,
  Hensloe, in the library. I think he wants my help&mdash;I'm acting as
  steward, you know."</p>

  <p>"You'll be glad to see how much money we have," said\ Laura, rising to her
  feet. "That's not a genteel thing to say, but it's true."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said he, with a grave air of not understanding her, but with
  inner vexation, "I shall be glad to know what money you have, dear Laura. It
  will be my duty to look after your fortune. A hundred thousand pounds is a
  great deal of money, but the rest is no concern of mine," he added prudently.
  "Your brother is a very young man and may marry. It is not likely that I
  shall outlive him. But you, as a widow, will be well provided for."</p>

  <p>With this speech, that was precise and not according to his nature, Mr.
  Mostyn left Laura. Although he was hardly conscious of it himself, he did not
  linger long in her company.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>As soon as Laura was alone she allowed two of the letters to slip to the
  floor and clutched the third to her breast. She had known the handwriting at
  once; it was from Lucius Delaunay. What a chance, what an extraordinary
  chance, as if indeed there had been some good angel looking after her! Harry
  Mostyn, of course, did not know the writing, but it was very familiar to
  her...how often had she seen it on those manuscripts that she used to handle
  when she was allowed into the library to help the two men at their work!
  Those had been the happiest hours of her life. Yes, if Sir Theo had seen that
  graceful hand she never would have had her letter.</p>

  <p>He had written, after so long! Years it seemed, but only a year and a
  half...yet another six months would have to pass before the second summer
  since his departure would arrive.</p>

  <p>She rose, not able now the moment had come to break the seal. But at last
  she did this and read the few hurried lines. He called her his dearest, his
  dear heart! He said that he had written to her several times but did not
  suppose that she had received his letters.</p>

  <p>He seemed to write with great agitation and excitement of spirit. He said
  that there had been the cholera in Antrim and that his uncle and two cousins
  had died of it and he had himself been ill, almost to the death, but he had
  recovered and come into the estate. He was now Belmont. The title was poor,
  there was not much to offer her, but such as it was, would she have it, and
  him? He could at least take her away from Leppard Hall.</p>

  <p>He would come in person to ask her brother again. He would confront
  anything, any insult, and peril of quarrel or distress, if she would give him
  the encouragement. He wrote from London&mdash;an hotel.</p>

  <p>Laura did not pause a moment. All her natural duplicity, her hardly
  acquired craft and guile, left her; she acted on pure impulse as she thrust
  the letter into the bosom of her dark, prune-coloured silk dress and ran from
  the drawing-room into the library, closing the door impetuously as she paused
  to face her brother.</p>

  <p>The three men turned, startled, at her sudden entrance. "Theo, I must
  speak to you, at once, and alone."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn made a protest. Whatever had happened&mdash;and he at once
  thought of those three letters&mdash;perhaps one after all was from the
  damned Irishman, Delaunay&mdash;he had the right to be present at her
  interview with her brother.</p>

  <p>But Laura was insistent, and Theo, alarmed and angry, at last gave way.
  And when brother and sister were alone she poured out her tale, at first
  incoherent, so that he had to beg her to repeat it.</p>

  <p>"Theo! I tell you! He has the title now! He's the Earl&mdash;Lord Belmont,
  you understand!"</p>

  <p>"It's an extraordinary chance," muttered Theo.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but it has happened. The cholera. They died, those two young men and
  his uncle. You know there was always a chance he would have the title. Theo,
  he always loved me. I suppose he has written so many times?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's written to you, and to me, too. And I've destroyed the
  letters."</p>

  <p>"You kept them back? You should have let me have my letters." Laura paused
  for a moment, struggling for control. "It does not matter now! He's coming
  for me, or I'm going to him."</p>

  <p>"Laura! You are talking nonsense. I'd like to use a stronger word, but in
  speaking to you one must employ childish terms. What does it matter to me if
  Lucius Delaunay has got a beggarly Irish title or not? Your marriage is
  arranged. You are promised to Harry Mostyn."</p>

  <p>"In what way is he to be preferred to Lucius, who is of a better family
  and now in a better position?"</p>

  <p>"An Irish title is nothing to me. Harry Mostyn is willing to take the name
  of Sarelle."</p>

  <p>Laura was drawn up short. She pulled her hands sharply to her heart. She
  had never thought of that. Of course, that was what weighed with Theo, that
  was the prize. Harry would take the name, carry on the accursed estate, the
  accursed Hall.</p>

  <p>"I cannot marry Harry Mostyn. Lucius always loved me. You have got to
  understand that."</p>

  <p>"I understand this&mdash;it will be another six months before you're
  twenty-one. If you marry before then without my consent you'll not have a
  penny."</p>

  <p>"Lucius would not care."</p>

  <p>"Nor you either, I suppose? You wild, unmannerly creature! But I tell
  you," cried the young baronet, "that I'll refuse my consent! There won't be a
  parson in the country who would dare to marry you!"</p>

  <p>"Then I'll wait until I am twenty-one."</p>

  <p>"And even then I'll cut you off without a penny! But I have been talking
  foolishly and at random. The matter is not even in discussion between us. You
  are promised to Harry Mostyn. I like him, I respect him, in every way he is
  suited to my plans. I'll hear of nothing else, and neither will he. Your
  engagement has been publicly announced, you will be disgraced and degraded if
  it is broken off, if this old foolish love story is brought up again. Lucius
  is behaving in a most contemptible way in writing to you."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose he knows about Harry." The words that her brother used,
  "degraded", "disgraced", stunned her...Was she bound to Harry Mostyn? With
  the reaction from her intense, fierce emotion, a cloud of depression, almost
  of lethargy, fell over her mind.</p>

  <p>She sank into a chair, staring down at the pattern on the carpet and even
  allowed her brother to pull the crumpled letter out of her hand, for she had
  drawn it from her breast and was holding it slackly.</p>

  <p>He read it and cast it back into her lap with a gesture of contempt.</p>

  <p>"A man of straw," he said. "Did you think it would mean anything to me?
  Why, it puts him further away! Are the Sarelles to be sunk in the Belmonts,
  this estate sold to bolster his fortune? Most of it you might
  sell&mdash;there is not much of it entailed after all&mdash;to help to
  improve some starved acres in Ireland. Do not let Harry Mostyn hear of this,
  Laura, do not speak of it again. By what unfortunate chance did you get hold
  of that letter?"</p>

  <p>"Does it matter? I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I spoke cm an impulse."</p>

  <p>She would not explain herself further, but left the room and went with a
  dragging step upstairs to the chamber where Mrs. Sylk sat over the fire
  embroidering a bell-pull in a design of cherries.</p>

  <p>Laura went to her, sank on the stool at her feet and stammered out her
  story. She had to repeat it two or three times before Mrs. Sylk understood.
  Then the girl vehemently, and clasping and unclasping her hands, demanded the
  elder woman's advice.</p>

  <p>"Could I go to him, Mrs. Sylk? I wouldn't care what I took with me! I'd
  leave everything!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk was horrified, and showed as much.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't, my darling! It's a wild fancy. He should not have written
  to you. But then, I suppose, as you say, with three sudden deaths in the
  family and the horror of the plague and himself ill, he did not know."</p>

  <p>"He may come to me, he may want to take me away."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk gathered her forces and recovered from the shock that this news
  had given her. She gave it as her opinion that Laura was completely pledged
  to Harry Mostyn and that Lord Belmont's offer had come a great deal too
  late.</p>

  <p>"That was Theo's fault, Theo kept the letters back&mdash;destroyed them.
  He stood between us before, when I had that illness. I don't rightly remember
  what happened then, but Lucius went away."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't try to remember," said Mrs. Sylk hastily. "It is all over.
  You might not even like him if you saw him again. Girls have these fancies,
  they come and go. You must not think of it. I suppose it has become a fixed
  thing in your mind. I tell you that Mr. Mostyn is a very amiable and pleasant
  gentleman. He will make a better husband for you. He'll take you abroad, into
  London life. I don't think that Lord Belmont will have much money, it's a
  poor Irish estate, he said so himself."</p>

  <p>"Where's my letter!" exclaimed Laura suddenly. Then her face grew strained
  and pallid. She remembered that it was in her lap. "I'm stupid sometimes, as
  if I didn't know what I was doing, as if I had a kind of fit. Do you really
  think I should be disgraced and degraded if I broke off with Harry and went
  to Lucius?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do. And I think if Lord Belmont knew of your engagement he would
  not come forward himself. He would withdraw his offer, he would wish you to
  honour your pledge. Laura, you must use some common sense. It's no good being
  so romantic and high-flown. You can't be sure that you love this young man.
  It's quite a while ago."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk preached on, very much against her own heart and instincts,
  giving the conventional, the well-bred, advice.</p>

  <p>And the girl's thoughts went quickly round and round in her mind,
  revolving a means of escape, a way out.</p>

  <p>She saw, first of all, the point that Mrs. Sylk had made, that when Lucius
  Delaunay heard of her pledge he would withdraw his offer. She knew that it
  was considered degrading for a girl to break an engagement of marriage, she
  knew what she would have to face both from Harry Mostyn and her brother if
  she tried to go back on her pledge. She could see no friend, no support, and
  her lover was across the sea.</p>

  <p>A sense of despair fell over her, almost withering her youth and bloom. As
  Mrs. Sylk anxiously looked at her she saw that her face looked peaked, small
  and deadlike, making even her hands seem shrivelled as she raised them to
  press against her cheeks, making her shoulders hunched as she drew them
  together.</p>

  <p>'God help me!' thought the poor woman. 'Am I doing right or wrong? Maybe I
  should encourage her to elope with this lover of hers. But surely no good
  ever came from a woman's doing a wild, stupid thing, obeying her heart
  instead of her head. Besides,' thought Mrs. Sylk dismally, 'these two men
  will never let her go. They have arranged everything between them, the taking
  of the name and money and all. And then there was that wretched quarrel. If
  Lucius Delaunay was to offer to take her without a halfpenny, Theo wouldn't
  let her go now, because of hatred.'</p>

  <p>"I must answer that letter," said Laura suddenly, "and you must contrive
  to get it posted, take it into Warwick, or have it sent somehow."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'll do that for you," agreed Mrs. Sylk, "if you'll let me see the
  letter first."</p>

  <p>But the poor plans of the women were as nothing, for in the library Sir
  Theodosius and Harry Mostyn were composing a letter to Lord Belmont, in which
  his proposal was refused in almost insulting terms and he was forbidden to
  hold any communication whatever with Miss Laura Sarelle, now happily
  betrothed and soon to be happily married to Harry Mostyn.</p>

  <p>The young baronet considered himself a man of scrupulous honour, but he
  did not hesitate to put in his letter:</p>

  <p class="letter">I write in my sister's name. She has received all your
  letters, but did not reply to them because she disdained their contents. The
  change in your position, my lord, has made no difference to her feelings or
  mine. She implores you not to molest her with your attentions.</p>

  <p>That evening, in a stern interview, Sir Theodosius told Mrs. Sylk of this
  letter; the intimidated woman believed that she was acting in the girl's
  interest, and turned traitress too, and tore up and threw into the sluggish
  river at twilight, with tears of shame, that other letter to Lord Belmont
  which Laura had entrusted to her to post in Warwick.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>So the winter days went on and no other letter came from Lord Belmont,
  though Sir Theodosius made a point now of unlocking the postbag in front of
  Laura and spreading the correspondence out on the long shining dining-room
  table. No letter from Lord Belmont either in reply to Sir Theodosius or for
  Laura Sarelle.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Lucius Delaunay, Lord Belmont, did not altogether believe in the epistle
  he had received from Leppard Hall, and was shrewd enough to see that it had
  been composed by the two men, very likely without the girl's knowledge. But
  he could not quite credit that if she had wished to send him some message of
  loyalty or affection or appeal for help she could not have found some means
  of doing so. He remembered that she was allowed to go into Warwick, he
  remembered that Mrs. Sylk was very friendlily disposed towards her. He
  thought that there must be some maid or servant who would convey a letter to
  the post in some secret fashion. He knew that Laura was a girl of spirit and
  it was quite possible, he thought, for her to get up to London herself on
  some excuse or another and arrange a meeting with him. He had given her the
  address of the furnished house he had hired in Golden Square, as well as that
  of the Covent Garden hotel from which he had written.</p>

  <p>But as nothing came at all he did begin to believe, much as he distrusted
  that letter from Sir Theodosius, that the girl was really engaged to Harry
  Mostyn of her own free choice. The news of her betrothal had come to him as
  an unpleasant shock. He had counted on Laura's loyalty, although no reply had
  ever come to his letters, but they had been such as contained no definite
  proposals and perhaps required no definite answers. He had told her, always,
  that his fortune was not such that he could for the moment offer her
  anything. He could only hope that she would wait until the prospect was
  clearer.</p>

  <p>Now there had come this tragedy that had opened a far brighter prospect
  for them. He had hastened to inform her of it and still was met by this
  silence.</p>

  <p>Soon after he had sent her the letter, which had been written impulsively
  and from a generous and magnanimous heart, he had heard of her engagement to
  a wealthy, well-considered man-about-town who was a distant relative of hers.
  The match seemed suitable and Lord Belmont's inquiries found out nothing
  positively to the discredit of Mr. Harry Mostyn. But the man was a widower,
  nearly twenty years her senior, and it had seemed to Lord Belmont in every
  wig a strange choice, until he heard, after a visit to Mr. Spryce, of the new
  suitor's willingness to adopt the name of Sarelle. He remembered the stern
  family pride of Sir Theodosius, the fact that he considered himself a born
  celibate, that he wished his sister to inherit the Hall and estates.</p>

  <p>'Is she, then, never to be free of that gloomy place?' thought the young
  man. He was bitterly struck; he believed that he loved the girl with a
  romantic passion, a delicate devotion that a long separation had only
  heightened. He knew that when he was with her, even when he was thinking of
  her, life went to a different and richer measure.</p>

  <p>He believed that if he could have won her for his life-long companion
  everything would have been pleasant for him, even troubles and misfortunes
  would be gilded by their mutual love.</p>

  <p>He had cherished this as a dream and waited from post to post and day to
  day for letters from her. Even when none had come he had not been much
  discouraged, remembering always that peevish brother. He had felt more
  scornful than offended when he received no answer from the letters he had
  sent Sir Theo himself. It was an ugly thing to discover in one whom he had
  cherished as a friend, though he had never much liked him, a great deal that
  was petty and even malignant.</p>

  <p>He had thought that the change in his position, his accession to an old
  and and honourable title, even though the estates were small and poor, would
  change Sir Theo's views towards him. He had not reckoned with the bribe the
  other man could offer, the willingness to accept the name that Sir Theo
  regarded with an almost fanatic admiration and devotion.</p>

  <p>'There is no struggling with obsession,' thought the young man wearily.
  'Theo cares for nothing but the Hall, the estate and the name. I suppose
  he'll live and die at Leppard. And Laura, she has been sacrificed, or has she
  forgotten me?'</p>

  <p>After all, it had been nothing much of a love affair. There had been no
  amorous passages between them, only that one conversation when they had
  walked by the bank of the river between the clumps of thyme and wild parsley,
  cresses, and the flags.</p>

  <p>His sudden proposal for her hand had been because of the emotion he had
  felt when he had heard that she, in her yellow dress, had been drawn out of
  that same river. He had thought then she was likely to die because of it, but
  perhaps all had been a folly, the kind of folly that he should have grown out
  of. He was a man nearly thirty years of age and had had some experiences.
  With her, romantic passion was natural enough, she was little more than a
  child and knew nothing save dreams.</p>

  <p>So this particular dream Lucius Delaunay put behind him and returned to
  Ireland, after he had waited some weeks in London, resolved never to think
  again of Laura Sarelle. She, though only a few miles away, was as if in a
  prison, so shut apart was she from him and all news of him. And very firmly
  did those two jailers, her betrothed lover and brother, hold her in
  bondage.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>After that first outbreak Laura betrayed nothing of her feeling, even to
  Hetty Sylk, and devoted herself to her old pastime of distilling. But all her
  thoughts and her dreams were turned inwards. She became very silent and
  laughed very little and no longer importuned her brother to take her to
  London, though it had been agreed, more or less casually between them, that
  by February they should all go to the capital, returning to Leppard Hall in
  the summer.</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn was ill-pleased at the turn events had taken; he did not like
  the episode of the letter or the quarrel that had followed between brother
  and sister, or even Laura's submission, which seemed to him unnatural.</p>

  <p>He mistrusted, too, the silence into which Mrs. Sylk had retreated, and
  the increased gloom over the household. The situation was, indeed, for a man
  of his temperament and habits almost intolerable. He had to remind himself
  again and again of the advantages to be gained by patience and prudence in
  order to enable him to endure a prolonged residence in Leppard Hall under
  such circumstances.</p>

  <p>It was true that he had persuaded Sir Theodosius to remove himself and his
  sister eventually to town, but Mr. Mostyn had little hope that his plan, so
  urgently desired by himself, would be put into practice. He tried to break
  the spell, as he termed it to himself, of the accursed place, for that also
  was his name in his private thoughts for Leppard Hall, by calling on the
  various gentry in the neighbourhood round Warwick and Rugby and by suggesting
  to Sir Theodosius that he invite friends to stay with them.</p>

  <p>He tried with all the tact and arts in his power, and he was gifted in
  these directions, to induce Laura to fall into his schemes, representing to
  her how much more agreeable her life would be if she had other young people
  staying at Leppard Hall and how she could show herself off in the
  neighbouring houses, attending such festivities as might be offered in the
  county town and in Rugby.</p>

  <p>But he found all these efforts were largely vain. He could not induce Sir
  Theodosius to go with him on the visits to such people as he discovered were
  in riding or driving distance from Leppard Hall; Laura seemed both sullen and
  indifferent towards his suggestion, only saying when pressed: "Too late now,
  too late for that"!</p>

  <p>And even Mrs. Sylk, when he tried to enlist her services, replied in some
  confusion: "Neither brother nor sister cares for society. It is useless to
  try to force their inclinations."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn then, like a wary general who is repulsed in one direction,
  began to consider how he might achieve his ends by other means.</p>

  <p>He went himself up to town and consulted his attorneys, to whom he gave a
  very frank explanation of the situation, discussed with them his financial
  affairs, which were in a slightly worse state than he had thought, and was
  bound to agree to their advice, to marry the heiress as soon as might be
  before the fanciful girl or her uncertain tempered brother changed their
  minds for good.</p>

  <p>After an absence of about a week he returned to Leppard Hall determined to
  put up with whatever discomforts or inconveniences he might have to undergo
  rather than run the risk of losing the hand of Laura Sarelle.</p>

  <p>While in London he made inquiries about Lord Belmont, who had been in the
  capital for a short while but who had recently returned to his estate in
  Ireland. As he could discover nothing to the discredit of that gentleman he
  felt his uneasiness increase. He knew perfectly well, and he was conscious of
  the baseness of his own action in abetting Sir Theodosius, that the girl had
  been, by foul means, separated from her lover. He knew that a false message
  had been sent to Lord Belmont and that his letters to Laura had been
  suppressed.</p>

  <p>It was a common enough sort of business, but one that Mr. Mostyn did not
  greatly relish.</p>

  <p>And he had this further grievance, as it were, against Leppard Hall and
  its atmosphere: that since he had been there he had been drawn into more
  disreputable behaviour than he had ever countenanced in himself before. It
  was true that he had been from the first moment that he had seen Laura
  Sarelle a fortune-hunter determined to better his own damaged affairs by
  marriage with an heiress, that he had done all in his power to win both
  brother and sister without in the least caring for either, but ever since he
  had gone to Leppard Hall he had been conscious of the meanness and trickery
  of his own behaviour. He had always more or less felt that he was a man of
  honour. But since his last visit to Warwickshire he felt he could no longer
  do so. He was conscious that he was acting, in a way, a villain's part. This
  was one reason for his intention to marry Laura. He thought that once she was
  his wife he could, in a way, make up to her for the trick that he had played
  on her. It surely would not be difficult, once they were married, for a man
  of his experience to induce a girl of her age and cloistered life to fall in
  love with what he could offer, even if she did not with his person.</p>

  <p>Laura in Paris, Vienna, Venice; Laura indulged in her taste for clothes
  and a fine equipage, with a smart Parisian chambermaid; Laura taken to the
  Opera, to the theatre, balls and concerts, would surely blossom into a
  different kind of girl, and one who would turn to him as the means of
  obtaining all these pleasures with gratitude.</p>

  <p>It was in this mood that Harry Mostyn returned to Leppard Hall. It was
  then the end of February and there were but few signs of springtime in the
  water-meadows, the woods, the parklands, the river and the church, which had
  by now become to him too familiar, though it was not many months ago since he
  had seen them for the first time.</p>

  <p>He brought with him Flasket&mdash;who, indeed, never left him&mdash;but no
  other servant. He was forced to economize, though he would have liked to have
  a considerable train of his own to impress Sir Theodosius and his
  household.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Mostyn was determined to keep up his spirits, though these were
  quenched as he once again turned into the drive between the stone piers of
  the gate crowned by the formal goshawks carved in stone holding the familiar
  shields with the escutcheons of the Sarelles on them, and looked with
  reluctant curiosity at the flat facade of Leppard Hall.</p>

  <p>But the melancholy caused by the sight of the bleak, gloomy mansion was
  soon dissipated by the welcome given him by Sir Theodosius. The young man
  seemed very glad to see him, to turn with almost piteous pleasure towards the
  company and support the elder man offered him.</p>

  <p>'Why the devil doesn't he,' thought Harry Mostyn, 'leave this place? He
  seems glad enough for a little human companionship, for some other interest
  besides those musty books.'</p>

  <p>And he tried once more to persuade the young man to leave the country and
  take a house in town. But when this turn was given to the conversation the
  young baronet became again impatient. He seemed to consider that his entire
  life was bound up in Leppard Hall. As for the gloom or sombreness of the
  place, he refused to see it; and, aware that he had struck a wrong note,
  Harry Mostyn quickly turned the conversation and began to urge an early
  marriage for himself and Laura.</p>

  <p>Sir Theodosius seemed to consider this proposal not unfavourably, and Mr.
  Mostyn, with his insinuating tact, soon discovered the reason. Sir Theodosius
  was anxious to get rid of his sister, put the responsibility of her
  well-being into what he hoped were more capable hands.</p>

  <p>The girl, it seemed, was being more than difficult, and Sir Theodosius was
  now anxious that she go abroad and see some company. He had himself
  instructed Mrs. Sylk to write cards of invitation to neighbouring ladies to
  call and amuse his sister.</p>

  <p>But Laura, when one or two of these neighbouring gentlefolk had driven up
  in their carriages and pairs, had refused to see them, and of course there
  had been no second visit.</p>

  <p>"I fear," said the young baronet with a sour smile, "that we have already
  a reputation for eccentricity. That was inevitable. I am a scholar, something
  of a student. Neither my father nor my grandfather lived here much, and the
  Hall was long shut up. And the gentlefolk of the county got out of the way of
  paying social visits."</p>

  <p>He went on rapidly, excusing himself, and Mr. Mostyn observed him with
  close scrutiny. His health was certainly not improved. There was a hectic
  flush in his cheeks, which were unnaturally hollowed under the bones. His
  eyes were very brilliant and he had taken to wearing glasses. And the thick
  dark hair that he wore brushed back from his forehead was damp with sweat at
  the roots. He coughed in a choking manner and continuously had his
  handkerchief pressed to his lips. He seemed alternately chilled and flushed
  with fever.</p>

  <p>While he was in London Mr. Mostyn had given no thought to the future
  beyond the date of his wedding day. He had considered nothing save putting
  his hands on the hundred thousand pounds that would relieve him of all his
  difficulties and free him of all immediate anxieties. But now, in this dark
  gloom of Leppard Hall, where the lamps and candles had just been lit and the
  grey February twilight still lay in pools of shadow in the library, the
  thought came into his mind, sharply and unbidden, as it had come when he sat
  at dinner that evening staring up at the two portraits, 'How soon shall I be
  master here? Of all of it?'</p>

  <p>A tempting prize. He moistened his lower lip. He had seen the rent rolls,
  and had had a shrewd guess, although Sir Theodosius was always reticent about
  his affairs, of the capital, the result of the economies of the lifetime of
  two wealthy men and the sale of this Jamaica estate.</p>

  <p>He exerted himself to throw off these reflections and said aloud, on a
  note of forced gaiety:</p>

  <p>"Let me take Laura off your hands, I dare say I can manage her. I'm not a
  bookish man like you. I shall have plenty of time."</p>

  <p>"And more experience, too," said the young baronet, still with his thin,
  sour smile, leaning back wearily in the heavy padded chair. "She wants to get
  away from Leppard Hall."</p>

  <p>"You've heard nothing more of Lord Belmont, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever. I suppose that was only a girlish caprice on her part,
  and a damned impertinence on his."</p>

  <p>"It was not an impertinent offer, you know," said Mr. Mostyn quietly. "I
  made some inquiries about him in London."</p>

  <p>"A beggarly Irish estate, a beggarly Irish title." Sir Theodosius repeated
  the two taunts that he had used against his former friend ever since he had
  sent that letter to Laura. "Besides, that would be the end of the Sarelles,
  would it not? All swallowed up in Belmont."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn kept his face impassive. Thus was clearly revealed his real
  hold over the man: his offer to take the name. He was not so eager as he had
  once been to fulfil this promise. At one time it seemed to matter nothing at
  all what his name was; he had no great family pride, he had no estates or
  traditions to keep up. Sarelle was a famous old name, one of the oldest
  Norman names in the kingdom, but now&mdash;there came before his mind those
  funeral escutcheons in the church, the flat white marble that bore the name
  of that other Laura Sarelle. He remembered for the first time that his wife
  would never change her name, she would always be Laura Sarelle, and he Harry
  Sarelle, that there would be an end, of course, to the baronetcy.</p>

  <p>'This place certainly confuses my wits,' he thought. 'Why, in London the
  change of names seemed a bagatelle, but here it seems important.'</p>

  <p>And he had to argue with himself that the taking of this name would not
  mean that the place would absorb him, engulf him, keep him...No, he would get
  away. And to steady himself he said again, aloud, looking across the lights
  and shadows, for the lamp had been set on the far corner of the desk and Sir
  Theodosius sat in obscurity:</p>

  <p>"I want to take Laura away. I think that would be good for her health. I
  promised her Paris and Venice, you know."</p>

  <p>"But you'll come back, of course?" urged Theodosius, peering at him.
  "You'll live here? That's part of the marriage contract. She's to be the
  mistress of Leppard Hall. We're to begin the family again, you know. You will
  be&mdash;when I'm gone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk like that," said Harry Mostyn quickly. "You're a far younger
  man than I am. Why, I was almost going to say I was old enough to be your
  father. Laura and I will live here, of course."</p>

  <p>Could he endure to live with a wife like Laura and brother-in-law like
  Theo at Leppard Hall? He would have to, for a while, at least, until he could
  get his hands on as much money as possible. Then, if he couldn't get the girl
  away he would have to go himself, on the quiet long visits&mdash;this was
  more a devil of a business than he had ever thought it would be.</p>

  <p>Sir Theodosius was looking at him with bright eyes.</p>

  <p>"My health's rather better than I expected," he said. "Dr. Selby seems to
  think I'm improving. It's mere nonsense to say that this low-lying country is
  affecting my lungs. Besides, I mean to stay here."</p>

  <p>'It is an obsession,' thought the older man. 'I suppose he was brought up
  with that one idea in his mind, that one day he would be master here. Now the
  place has got him.'</p>

  <p>He made some polite inquiries about the young man's work and learnt that
  he had tried a secretary, who had come in from Rugby, but who had been but a
  poor success and who had left again.</p>

  <p>"I do very well alone," added Sir Theo quickly. "And as for Laura, you
  must not think that she's been difficult. Indeed, she is very quiet, and Mrs.
  Sylk seems to think that that's unnatural in her age. For myself, I have no
  experience."</p>

  <p>"She has a perverse dislike for Society," said Mr. Mostyn, "that's why I
  want to marry her. Everything will be easier when she is my wife. I have
  friends of my own in every large city in Europe. She will be admired,
  feted."</p>

  <p>"Not too much of that," said Sir Theodosius, "or she will not want to come
  back. As I said before, her home is here, and there is nothing that anyone
  could find fault with in Leppard Hall, is there, Mostyn?"</p>

  <p>Feeling his way cautiously, Mr. Mostyn agreed that the mansion was
  splendid, the estate well kept. Then he suggested in a casual,
  self-deprecating way:</p>

  <p>"You would not consider, I suppose, modernizing some of the rooms,
  throwing out wings or pavilions, something perhaps in the Gothic style?"</p>

  <p>The look on the young man's face showed him at once his mistake.
  Theodosius exclaimed vehemently that he would not have the Hall touched, and
  he added&mdash;at random, the other man thought:</p>

  <p>"I have always considered myself above the superstitions of mankind, I am
  not going to give in to them now."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Laura's first interview with her betrothed passed off pleasantly enough.
  The girl seemed confused but amiable. She was still interested in the little
  room with the still and told Mr. Mostyn that she was waiting for the flowers
  to bloom as she had a recipe for making an essence of roses, but meanwhile
  she was practising on evergreens.</p>

  <p>"Do they," he asked, trying to cover his indifference to the dullness of
  the topic, "make any kind of perfume or unguent that is of the least
  use?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Laura, with rather a stupid look. "I'm merely
  experimenting. I told you before, when I took you up to the little closet,
  that I was trying to find something. I have not yet, but sometimes I feel
  very close."</p>

  <p>She put her hand on his arm and took him into the music-room, which was
  seldom used now, and, though kept spotlessly clean, everything shining and
  polished and dusted, had a very sombre air. A fire had not been lit, the
  atmosphere was chilly. The spinet and the harp had linen covers drawn over
  them and a bag of muslin concealed the chandelier hanging from the painted
  ceiling.</p>

  <p>Laura was not dressed with her usual care, her gown of a dull green colour
  was carelessly knotted with cherry-coloured ribbons on her breast, and over
  all she wore a little cashmere shawl. She shivered as if very cold.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn tried to induce her to go into one of the other rooms where a
  fire burnt.</p>

  <p>"It seems like the spring in London, but mid-winter down here," he said,
  and found it difficult to conceal his impatience with these obstinate,
  difficult people. But he had to remember that it was the role of lover and
  suitor that he must play. Before she had time to chatter any more of her
  nonsense about her foolish pastimes or to speak to him in the rambling way to
  which he had grown accustomed and that he always disliked, he asked her when
  she would marry him.</p>

  <p>"Don't you want to come away from all this, Laura? I think May, we might
  be married in May, and then we could go to Paris and Italy. If we wait any
  longer the weather will be too hot, the capitals will be empty, and so will
  the big towns."</p>

  <p>He was talking at random and not with his customary ease, for he was
  wondering whether it would be possible for him by May to have got his affairs
  into some such order as to pass the eager, zealous scrutiny of Mr. Spryce.
  How unfortunate it would be if he rushed his fences and found that the lawyer
  at the last minute advised Sir Theodosius against the match! But no, he
  believed he had his firm hold on both brother and sister.</p>

  <p>Laura seemed at first pleased and excited, or so he thought. Some strong
  emotion certainly flushed her face and made her eyes sparkle, and she smiled,
  lifting her lips back from her teeth in an unpleasant way she had, making
  her, he thought, look rather like a little vixen.</p>

  <p>"May? Will it be as soon as that? And I suppose whatever I say won't make
  any difference? But you know, whatever it is I'm looking for, I'd like to
  find it first."</p>

  <p>He found it difficult to restrain himself from rebuking the girl. If she
  talked like that in front of other people they would think her half-witted.
  He wished he dared speak to Mrs. Sylk and tell her to school the girl in more
  genteel ways. He controlled himself and patted her hand and asked if she
  would not set about buying her trousseau and ordering her marriage dress. And
  he thought: 'My God! What sort of a wedding will it be? And who is to arrange
  it? I suppose it will have to be here, a hole-and-corner business.'</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn was surprised at his own distaste at the thought of being
  married in that church, by the Reverend Nathaniel Mist, with the funeral
  escutcheons of the Sarelles fixed upon the walls, and the mechanical
  endearments that he gave Laura were uttered in a stammering tongue and his
  eye was vacant, his accent vague.</p>

  <p>Laura endured his speech with a dull look that seemed to give assent to
  all he said, at least by her silence. She broke from him as soon as she could
  with decency and ran upstairs to her own chamber, where Mrs. Sylk was waiting
  for her, for the poor woman knew that this would be a difficult time when
  Harry Mostyn returned from London. The girl seemed so reserved, shut up in
  herself, but surely when her so-called lover returned she would make some
  sign of emotion. Nor was Mrs. Sylk proved wrong, for the girl ran into the
  room and threw herself into the arms of her one friend, whispering as she
  pressed her close:</p>

  <p>"I'm to be married in May! Whatever I'm looking for I must find before
  then. Who can tell me? Who can show me the way? Mrs. Sylk, I hate both of
  them! I hate them! Do you understand? I read somewhere that hate consumes,
  like love. Don't you think that's true?"</p>

  <p>"I think you have a good many foolish and wicked fancies for so young a
  girl," said Mrs. Sylk, almost reduced to tears of desperation. She had tried
  to talk to Sir Theodosius in her kind, stumbling, humble way about "the state
  of Laura's heart", and the young baronet had harshly silenced her. But now
  she did not know what to do. Soothing the girl as best she could, she drew
  her to her favourite place, the large chair by the fire, and made her sit on
  the stool at her feet. And after a while Laura, who had been talking
  incoherently, was silent, and rested her head on her friend's lap.</p>

  <p>"My dear lamb, my poor darling! I'd do what I could for you, but I'm
  helpless. I have no money, I have nothing at all, only a few savings. And
  now, if, as you so often beg me, I was to take you away from Leppard Hall, if
  we were to go together, what could we do? There's no place in the world for
  two gentlewomen who've run away from their home and their shelter. Don't you
  understand that, Laura?"</p>

  <p>"There must," whispered the girl passionately, "be somewhere. Why doesn't
  Lucius come? You remember, I used to call him Luce&mdash;why doesn't he
  come?"</p>

  <p>Again Mrs. Sylk explained to the girl the worldly part of the affair, the
  position that Lord Belmont was in.</p>

  <p>"It is possible, too, my dear, that he never got your letter."</p>

  <p>"That's what I think. And I think that perhaps he's written again and I
  didn't get those letters either. It was only by chance, Mr. Mostyn himself
  bringing me that letter which I lost. Wasn't it a strange chance that I
  should have got that one letter of all that were sent!"</p>

  <p>The girl thrust her fingers through her hair, disarranging the curls that
  Mrs. Sylk had arranged with loving tenderness, and sat staring into the fire
  while the poor woman brought out her little hoard of worldly maxims. After
  all, she believed she was doing the girl the best turn that love and
  friendship could do her by advising her to marry Mr. Mostyn and thus escape
  from Leppard Hall.</p>

  <p>The other match, the romantic love match, was obviously hopeless. Besides,
  even if Laura liked to wait until she was twenty-one, it was doubtful if the
  young man would take her against her brother's wish and at the cost of her
  losing all her rights&mdash;one of the finest fortunes in England.</p>

  <p>Laura listened in what seemed a dutiful silence, only to say again:</p>

  <p>"There must be some way out."</p>

  <p>She seemed so restless and agitated that Mrs. Sylk feared an attack of
  fever and went downstairs to the housekeeper's room to ask if Mrs. Marston
  had one of Sir Theodosius' sleeping-draughts. Dr. Selby had ordered these,
  for the young baronet had not been able to sleep lately because of his cough,
  and the medicine had been given to the housekeeper; she had been told' to
  send it upstairs to Sir Theo's room every evening with the carafe and
  glass.</p>

  <p>She at once gave Mrs. Sylk a little of the powder in a small box. She was
  a good-humoured woman and would willingly have championed Miss Laura, but
  Mrs. Sylk always kept her at arm's length. She was not quite sure she was a
  gentlewoman, and all poor Hetty Sylk's instinct revolted against having
  Laura's affairs talked over in the servants' hall.</p>

  <p>So she thanked Mrs. Marston and took the draught upstairs and offered it
  to Laura, who was then lying down, fully clothed, upon her bed. It was
  useless, Mrs. Sylk knew, when the girl was in this mood to ask her to undress
  herself, so she mixed the medicine and offered it to her. Laura took it with
  a listless hand, asking what it was.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's just a sleeping-draught, dear. Quite a harmless powder. You
  know you had some when you were sick before."</p>

  <p>The poor woman stumbled over her words, afraid that she might remind Laura
  of the accident, as it was termed, when she had been drawn out of the Avon in
  the fading yellow dress.</p>

  <p>"And now Dr. Selby has ordered these powders for Sir Theo. They're kept in
  the housekeeper's room."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll drink it, if it makes me sleep!"</p>

  <p>"Think of pleasant things, my child." Hetty Sylk sat down in the brocade
  chair by the bed and drew back the long curtains of pale silk. The room was
  very handsomely furnished, everything in this chamber had been very well
  kept. All the embroidered hangings, bed furniture, curtains, carpets were of
  considerable antiquity, yet had a perfect bloom and freshness.</p>

  <p>Laura had often asked who had used this room in the old days, but no one
  could tell her. Someone suggested that it had been her namesake who, as the
  lady of the house, would surely have had this, the finest set of apartments
  after those across the landing, the great chamber and closet, but Laura had
  always thought that it was not that woman but another who had lived here.</p>

  <p>Now Mrs. Sylk tried to make her think of pleasant subjects, tried to extol
  the good qualities, amiability, and kindness of Mr. Mostyn.</p>

  <p>"And you'll have to consider your wedding, dear. There is not a young girl
  born that wasn't interested in her wedding-gown and all the new clothes she
  has&mdash;you've always liked the fashions, haven't you, Laura? We shall have
  to go up to London and buy&mdash;I know not how many things. And May, why
  that's far too soon! You won't be ready till August."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," said Laura, "May or August. They've got their
  excuses. Theo wants to be rid of me, and Harry wants the money, I suppose. He
  quite as good as told me that, you know&mdash;that he was after my
  money."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't think such things, dear."</p>

  <p>But Mrs. Sylk's futile protests were unheard by Laura. She put the glass
  to her lips and drank the draught. Mrs. Sylk watched her as she fell into a
  drugged sleep.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>In the morning Laura Sarelle went down to the vicarage, the third person
  to go on the same quest to this place.</p>

  <p>She gave a curious glance at the path with the broken flags, the weeds,
  thyme and mint now growing up freshly for another year. She could remember
  very little of that night when she had broken from Lucius Delaunay, only a
  coldness, and the dark. She looked up the avenue set with flagstones that led
  to the church porch and across the vicarage garden where the snowdrops were
  showing above the newly turned soil, and where faint small tufts of green
  showed on the currant and gooseberry bushes.</p>

  <p>The little maid Agnes received her with a deep if sly reverence, but the
  parson was abroad...He had been summoned to an old man who was dying in the
  village.</p>

  <p>Laura was turning away with a deep sensation of disappointment when there
  was a tapping, violent and excited, on the window above the porch, and
  looking up she saw the pallid face of Madam Mist.</p>

  <p>"She wants to speak to you," said the little servant-girl, doubtfully,
  coming out on to the stone flagged path and looking up. She was familiar with
  her mistress' methods of signalling. "Will you go up, my lady?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I'll go up." Laura thought: 'Perhaps she can tell me better than
  her husband could. He's always slow and difficult.'</p>

  <p>And it was with a light and almost eager step that she went up the shallow
  stairs to the old woman's sick-room.</p>

  <p>Madam Mist was neat and tidy in her grey linsey-woolsey gown and white
  shawl and her mob cap of clear starched muslin. In her personal habits she
  was inclined to be slovenly, but she had lately had a visitor in the shape of
  a niece, who had taken a pleasure in setting the old lady off prettily and
  daintily. But the more pleasing surroundings did not much move the parson's
  wife; she was interested in other matters, in human beings, in queer stories
  and wild doings. She liked to collect what she could in the way of both human
  and superhuman material, and when she could get no other audience she would
  entertain the servant girl Agnes or any villager who came round for a pie or
  a bowl of soup with some ghost story or fable of the neighbourhood. Of late
  her illness had increased and she did not believe that she had long to
  live.</p>

  <p>The invalid now looked with great gratification at Laura, trim and slender
  in her dark pelisse and a bonnet without a veil tied under her chin, and put
  a good many quick questions about her approaching marriage, and where it was
  to be, and who were to be the bridesmaids, and such-like details. Madam Mist
  thought it a very strange thing that these matters had not been plainly
  arranged and openly published long before. She thought that the people at the
  Hall were strange, eccentric folk and she wondered that Mr. Mostyn had not
  some friends and relatives to come down and settle matters for him. Laura put
  all this by with such indifference, as if indeed it had nothing to do with
  herself, that Madam Mist after a while had to give up her quest for
  information. And then Laura put her questions.</p>

  <p>"I came here to ask your husband something. I don't know why I never
  thought of it before. Something about the past. Do you suppose he knows?"</p>

  <p>"We've been here forty years," grinned Madam Mist. "He knows a great
  deal."</p>

  <p>"He collects stories about the neighbourhood, Mam, doesn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that!" The parson's wife drew her pale lips together with a grin of
  satisfaction. Her hands, knotted and flaccid from age and disease, grasped
  the arms of her chair and she stared into the fire. Her husband had told her
  that Lucius Delaunay, the steward, who had left in such scandalous haste, and
  Mr. Mostyn himself, Laura Sarelle's promised husband, had both come to him,
  nosing round, as he put it, about that old scandal. And now here was the girl
  herself. That was what they got for making a mystery...</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to know?" she said. She knew that she was bound both by
  interest and by honour to say nothing of the secret that she was one of the
  few people to possess, but she was finding it very hard to resist being the
  first to enlighten Laura Sarelle as to that tragic incident in her own family
  history. What did prudence matter now, after all? She was old and in a few
  weeks might be dead.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," mused Laura, as if pondering to herself over the reasons
  why she had not come here before to learn what it was she wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"You've been here three and a half years, haven't you?" probed the vicar's
  wife. "You've been visiting me often enough like the kind young lady you are,
  but you've never said anything about this..."</p>

  <p>"Theo didn't want me to ask questions about the past. And then there's the
  matter of the portraits. I can't tell you. Do you believe in the dreams of
  the dead?"</p>

  <p>"The dreams of the dead?" repeated the old woman faintly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I mean the theory that when people die they go on dreaming and their
  dreams come abroad as spectres and apparitions, seize hold of the living and
  even enter into them."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't like to say what I do believe, but those are strange fancies
  for a young girl. And what are the portraits you were talking of, Miss
  Laura?"</p>

  <p>The girl described them.</p>

  <p>"It's twenty years," answered the parson's wife, "since I got further than
  the garden, ten years that I've been up in this room. I'm paralysed, you
  know. But I can remember going to the Hall&mdash;oh, yes, often enough. Sir
  John was seldom there, but when he came we used to wait on him. And I
  remember the portraits. One is your namesake, Laura Sarelle, who is buried in
  the church."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know, it was her dress I found, the day that I fell into the
  river."</p>

  <p>"The day that you fell into the Avon, yes," said Madam Mist. "Why don't
  you leave Leppard Hall? Won't he let you, your brother? It's all a very queer
  story. If you ask me, I don't think it was fair to give you both the same
  name."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that other Laura had a brother named Theodosius?"</p>

  <p>"I wonder if I've got her room?" Laura described her apartments opposite
  those that had been locked until she began to use them for her domestic
  arts.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think so. You see, it would be Lady Sarelle who would have
  that. That would be the mother."</p>

  <p>"Lady Sarelle!" Laura repeated the name. This was a new character in the
  imaginary drama that she was acting in; she was excited, and leaned towards
  the sick woman.</p>

  <p>"You never thought of a mother. She is buried in the mausoleum," said
  Madam Mist, peering at her visitor closely, "along with her son. She went
  away from the place after they were both dead, and died abroad&mdash;in
  Florence, I think&mdash;but they brought her back here. She would not live
  with her daughter after what had happened."</p>

  <p>"An inquest, wasn't there?" whispered Laura. "Can you tell me anything
  about it?"</p>

  <p>Madam Mist made an effort over her own evil inclination. She tried, as
  Mrs. Sylk had so often tried, to give the girl some conventionally good
  advice such as looking to the future and leaving the past alone, and being
  happy in a good marriage that had been arranged for her, and so forth.</p>

  <p>But after she had talked for several minutes, which had been ticked off by
  the clock with the wreaths of flowers painted on it that hung by the window,
  she saw that the girl was not listening at all.</p>

  <p>Then the sick woman leaned forward, obeying a sudden and, as she
  afterwards felt, devilish impulse and rang the bell, and when the little maid
  Agnes came asked her to bring the small brown book with yellow mottled insets
  on the cover that stood on the shelf in the library, and she very precisely
  indicated the place where it might be found.</p>

  <p>Laura, as if she had not heard a word the elder woman had said, now began
  to talk about the second portrait.</p>

  <p>"It was as if he were sitting at the table and as master of us all, the
  portrait hanging at the end of the room, you know. I'd like to know who it
  is. It's not a Sarelle, they say."</p>

  <p>"No, it's not a Sarelle," broke in Madam Mist, "that you can be sure
  of..."</p>

  <p>"Who is it, some friend?"</p>

  <p>"Some enemy, rather."</p>

  <p>The girl came in with the book and the parson's wife took it as the maid
  lingered curiously.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you shouldn't know. Making all this mystery! Why, the
  affair's over and done with generations ago. If you don't hear about it by
  word of mouth, why, you'll get to know of it in other ways. It is all printed
  here. Pray leave us, Agnes. I always thought the Hall should have been
  destroyed, as they say she wished it to be."</p>

  <p>"She wished it?" said Laura quickly, leaning forward.</p>

  <p>"Who did?"</p>

  <p>Madam Mist waited until the servant-girl had gone before she replied:</p>

  <p>"Laura Sarelle. The last of the main line, you know. She wanted the Hall
  razed to the ground. I know that, I heard. Sir John tell my husband so when I
  was quite a young woman and we first went there. My husband was saying what a
  large place it was and what a deal it needed to keep up, and wouldn't it be
  better perhaps to have it modernized...And then Sir John said he
  was&mdash;what did he call it?&mdash;a stoic philosopher, and that he was not
  intending to listen to any superstitions, and that just because a stupid
  hysterical woman had ordered the Hall to be razed to the ground he was going
  to keep it as it was, even to every detail of furniture. And that," said the
  old woman, sighing with exhaustion after this long speech, "was, in my
  opinion, a stupid thing to do."</p>

  <p>She was turning over the old book with shaking fingers; the pages stuck
  together, but at last she found what she wanted and held up before Laura, in
  ill-executed copperplate, the portrait of a man at which Lucius Delaunay had
  looked and which to him had seemed faintly familiar on the day he had visited
  the vicarage.</p>

  <p>"Is that the man? Is that your portrait?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is he. Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"That's Captain Edward Avershaw."</p>

  <p>"I knew! I knew! It was the name I found inside the gold laced hat. Who
  was he?"</p>

  <p>"He was the husband of Laura Sarelle, but she took her own name again, and
  his was never to be mentioned. And how is it that they've got his portrait
  hanging up there? I don't think Sir Theodosius can know who it is."</p>

  <p>"Laura Sarelle was <i>married</i>, then." The girl's face was puzzled,
  startled, tense in its interest, all her features sharp, her lips pale, her
  nostrils flared.</p>

  <p>Madam Mist was now lost to everything but relish in the old drama that she
  had so often turned over in her idle mind.</p>

  <p>"I've kept quiet about this for a long lifetime. I don't see why you
  shouldn't know. It will be a shock, but it will be like a thunderstorm
  clearing the air. You've every right to know. These men, they don't
  understand. The dead do walk."</p>

  <p>"I've seen her," said Laura simply. "But no matter about that. There are
  things that frighten me more&mdash;what is happening to myself? If I am part
  of her dream&mdash;" she checked herself. "Tell me why she would not keep her
  husband's name. And she so young, and he so handsome."</p>

  <p>Madam Mist lowered her voice and leant forward in her well-padded but
  shabby invalid's chair.</p>

  <p>"Captain Avershaw was hanged at Warwick for murdering Sir Theodosius, his
  brother-in-law. That's why she would not keep his name."</p>

  <p>The parson's wife was alarmed at the effect of this sentence on Laura
  Sarelle. She had expected some display of violent emotion, perhaps hysterics,
  but the girl remained still in terrifying tranquillity. Only a slow smile
  disturbed her upper lip and drew it back from her small white teeth.</p>

  <p>"Tell me the story," she commanded.</p>

  <p>"It is here in this book," muttered the old woman quickly, looking over
  her shoulder at the door. "I don't know what my husband would say if he knew
  I had told you. He will keep this book. He says nobody ever thinks of looking
  there in his old library. All the other copies were called in, I believe. You
  must remember how powerful the Sarelles were&mdash;they wanted to hush it up,
  to live it down."</p>

  <p>"Why did he do it? The murder?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's the old story. He met the girl at Bath. She was with her
  mother, and was a great fool, as I think. He married her. Theodosius was even
  then a sickly boy, vicious too. They all lived together at Leppard Hall and
  there was quarrelling all the time&mdash;the two women, the mother and the
  daughter, the boy and the son-in-law. Avershaw was an adventurer, he married
  her for her money. He had been turned out of the Army&mdash;cashiered, don't
  they call it?&mdash;a gambler and a spendthrift; he wanted to be master here.
  It was a big fortune even then, though nothing like what it is now. He took
  the boy about with him to cock-fights, boxing-matches, encouraging him in his
  bad, evil ways. He tried to murder him that way."</p>

  <p>"But he wouldn't die? The boy wouldn't die?" questioned Laura with great
  eagerness.</p>

  <p>"No, instead his constitution strengthened. They didn't understand things
  in those days. The boy had been lolling on a sofa, and when he was taken
  about in the fresh-air life, why, it improved him. And then Captain Avershaw
  thought he would have to do something else. He was taking sleeping-draughts,
  the doctor used to come in from Rugby to see him. There was nothing much the
  matter with him."</p>

  <p>"Theo's taking sleeping-draughts now..."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's common enough," said the parson's wife. "Let me finish my
  story, we may be interrupted. I should have asked you to swear I hadn't told
  it you."</p>

  <p>"I promise that. Tell me everything, all you know."</p>

  <p>"There's a closet in Leppard Hall with a still, isn't there?" said the
  parson's wife. "It's fitted up as a little distillery?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, that was Captain Avershaw's room, next the big chamber he shared
  with his wife. He took a liking for chemistry and used to make essences,
  essence of roses. His servant used to prepare everything for him and then he
  would go in and work there. The room next to it was where his wife slept. The
  big room above, the one I suppose you have now, was where Lady Sarelle slept.
  Sir Theo had the rooms below."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, that's where Theo sleeps now, and Harry opposite."</p>

  <p>"Well, it was an easy matter, or so Edward Avershaw thought. He just
  changed the medicine in the bottle, and one night when Theo took his
  sleeping-draught he took the poison. He was dead within a few minutes. Then
  Avershaw tried to put it down to a chill. He said the baronet was imprudent,
  got his feet wet fishing. That passed too. Of course, they were great people
  and no one liked to say anything. And Theo was buried. And then one of the
  servants began to talk and the doctor was alarmed.</p>

  <p>"There was a Sir Martin Ford, who was the boy's guardian. It was on his
  twentieth birthday he died, and Sir Martin was guardian until he was
  twenty-one. He didn't like the story. You see, the penniless adventurer, the
  sudden death, and the heir&mdash;she, that Laura&mdash;she had everything,
  and of course it all came to her husband.</p>

  <p>"Well, the long and short of it was that Avershaw was arrested and put on
  his trial. There was a big doctor came down from London, Theo's body was
  exhumed. They tried to make out that he died in a fit, but they brought it in
  as murder and Avershaw was hanged that day. He went off gaily, as the book
  says, with a flower in his mouth, and his hair curled. And he was hanged and
  buried in the graveyard of the jail, the Castle, you know, at Warwick. She
  went home, and she died the next winter. I've seen her will. Of course there
  wasn't much she had in her power to do."</p>

  <p>"She went back to Leppard Hall after that!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, nothing could get her away. Her mother went to Italy, as I say, and
  left her there alone, she was that obstinate. But she would not have his
  name. She said that she was Laura Sarelle and nothing else. She was not to be
  buried in the mausoleum with her brother, but in the church. And I think it
  was by her wish that those boughs of laurel were put there."</p>

  <p>"And Edward Avershaw," whispered Laura, "did he confess?"</p>

  <p>"No, he always said he wasn't guilty. They put another prisoner in the
  cell with him, the way they had in those days and in order that they should
  talk freely. He swore to this man that he hadn't done it, and tried to put it
  on to his mother-in-law. It was an unlikely story and no one believed him.
  The mother gave evidence against him, she caught him rinsing out the
  glass."</p>

  <p>"And the sister&mdash;what was her part?"</p>

  <p>"No one knew." Madam Mist stretched out a cold hand and took hold of
  Laura's slim cold wrist. "You see, people thought she had a hand in it, she'd
  at least stood by, known of her husband's intentions. That was the story that
  went round, but she was so proud she came back here to live it down."</p>

  <p>"She loved her husband," whispered Laura, as if trying to puzzle out
  something familiar yet difficult. "But no, it wasn't that. It wasn't that,
  Madam Mist, was it?"</p>

  <p>"What made you say that?" asked the parson's wife with a chuckle. "No, it
  wasn't that. He ill-treated her, he wasn't faithful to her. She knew he
  married her just for her money. No, she fell in love with someone else and
  she wanted both of them out of the way&mdash;the brother so that she could
  get the money, the husband so that she would be free to marry again. That's
  why she edged him on to poison her brother, and that's why she whispered
  about it among the servants and started suspicions, as they say she did. And
  that's why she bore evidence against him. Yes, along with her mother she bore
  evidence against him. It isn't law, you know, for a wife to do that against
  her husband. But she was witness on some other excuse, and then turned round,
  said she believed he'd done it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Agnes entered clumsily, pushing the door open with her foot, and carrying
  a tea service on a lacquer tray; Madam Mist paused abruptly while the little
  maid placed the tray on the table near the two ladies, then sharply ordered
  her out of the room; neither the vicar's wife nor Laura took any notice of
  the interruption, the tea and the cakes were untouched, and the girl leaned
  forward as the door closed and asked eagerly the question that she had held
  suspended:</p>

  <p>"Why didn't she marry the other man?"</p>

  <p>"No one knows. The story breaks off there. I think he was abroad, in
  France or somewhere. It was a sickly family and Laura seemed to have a
  consumption of the lungs the same as her brother. She may have been waiting
  for him to come home. He may have disliked the scandal."</p>

  <p>"She was weak, she was foolish. Imagine risking all that, bringing two men
  to their end and then not having the reward of it. Was not she a fool, Madam
  Mist?"</p>

  <p>"Who is to judge, who is to say? It's an old story now." There was a trace
  of uneasiness on the pallid face of the vicar's wife. "Perhaps I should not
  have told it to you. Most people would blame me, I suppose. But I don't see
  why you shouldn't know, it's a long while ago. But she thought the Hall ought
  to be razed to the ground. Yes, I can understand that."</p>

  <p>"That's what one hears now, the whispers in the corners, the echoes of
  those old quarrels, mother and son, husband and wife, all quarrelling, in
  that place. And after he was dead&mdash;the boy, I mean&mdash;the three of
  them living there. Can you imagine it, Madam Mist? How they would have looked
  at one another, and how she cast suspicion on him. The servants probably had
  their doubts already, she confirmed them with a word here and a word there.
  The mother, too, spiteful..."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't think of it like that," said Madam Mist rather uneasily.
  "That's not what I meant. I wanted you to get it out of your mind by telling
  you. I say it is all over. And she didn't," said the parson's wife, feeling
  that a moral ought to be drawn, "get the reward of her infamous conduct. She
  never married her lover. Oh no, she had to live there alone for those last
  awful months. They must have been as bad as the weeks that Captain Avershaw
  spent in Warwick Jail. Everybody knowing what had happened, believing she was
  guilty too, and riding to her brother's grave in the park&mdash;she looked on
  his face when they unscrewed his coffin. It says there in that book he was so
  horrible to look on that the physicians felt sick. But she gazed at him
  unmoved."</p>

  <p>"What was the use of all that courage if she didn't get her heart's
  desire? I'm sorry for her, Madam Mist, she was trapped, was she not, by those
  two men? The man who married her for her money, and the brother, I suppose,
  who had no thought for her. And the mother, I can't see her clearly at all. I
  suppose she was selfish and foolish. And so she came back here too to lie in
  the mausoleum. Will you give me the book?"</p>

  <p>But the parson's wife slipped it behind her back.</p>

  <p>"No! I've said enough! There's nothing else there, just the evidence, and
  it's dully put down. I don't see why you should read it," she said defiantly,
  "but I don't want you to be seen leaving the house with it. Perhaps another
  time. But now you go away and forget it. You know all this story that they
  make such a monstrous secret about, and maybe when you do become the mistress
  of Leppard Hall you can have it pulled down. I think it would be a good thing
  to do. I never liked it, though I used to be there only for a few half-hours
  at a time."</p>

  <p>"I found his hat in that room," said Laura. "There was 'Avershaw' in
  gold-lettering inside the rim, a little faded yet scarcely soiled. Does my
  brother know all this?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course Sir Theodosius knows the story. My husband knows it and I know
  it, and one or two old people in the village know it. But there was a great
  to-do to keep it quiet. They kept changing the servants at the Hall&mdash;ay,
  and the tenants if they could, though Tampion, the miller, knows it well
  enough. Maybe Paul Tomkins, your brother's man, knows a little."</p>

  <p>The old woman rambled on with some satisfaction in relating the number of
  people who were in possession of the Sarelle secret.</p>

  <p>"Of course, in Warwick it is well known enough, but anyone who hoped for
  patronage or custom from the Sarelles, or help in any way&mdash;and they're a
  big people in the neighbourhood&mdash;kept it quiet. Then when Miss Laura
  died&mdash;Miss Laura, I find myself calling her, but she was Mrs. Avershaw,
  of course&mdash;it went to your distant branch that came from Jamaica. And
  they, as I say, were these hard-headed men who weren't going to have this
  nonsense about this superstition and were going to keep on the Hall and all
  that was in it. And so they did, but neither of them lived here very much.
  Your brother must have been told when he was quite a lad, but of course he
  kept silent about it too. It was a queer defiance to give you two the same
  name. But now, my pretty young miss," continued the old invalid, "the mystery
  is solved and you should not worry your head about it."</p>

  <p>Laura's face became blank under the old woman's anxious gaze; it was as if
  all expression had been wiped off it. She drew her handkerchief out of her
  reticule and pressed it to her brow and her lips. Then she said in a flat,
  controlled voice:</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm glad to know this old story. As you said, it's a long time ago
  and it doesn't affect any of us now. It's stupid to make a mystery about such
  a thing. It should have been openly talked about and then it would have been
  forgotten. It was kind of you and not betray you, though really the matter's
  of no consequence."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you take it like that, my dear," said Madam Mist, much relieved.
  "I'm old, and I'm here alone, and I've a liking for all ancient fables,
  tales&mdash;ay, and I suppose bits of scandal and gossip too. Sometimes when
  it's a moonlit night I make them take me to the window and I look out. I can,
  you know, by putting my head out of the casement, see the churchyard, and
  sometimes I fancy I can see Laura Sarelle walking along the path by the
  river."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, she walks," nodded Laura slyly, then she quickly caught herself
  up. "I mean, that is the story. Do not let us talk of it any more. I must
  think of the future, as you say, Madam Mist. I must think of my wedding, it
  is to be here, in your husband's church. There is a good deal to be
  done."</p>

  <p>Laura paused, and then made further inquiries about Paul Tomlin, who had
  been mentioned just now by Madam Mist as possibly in possession of this old
  story; he was, she said, an efficient servant, but a dull and effaced
  personality, and he had only just returned to Leppard Hall, after being
  absent because of a long illness.</p>

  <p>"I wondered why Theo had him again, and why he seems to hold him in
  regard&mdash;is it because he knows something, do you suppose?"</p>

  <p>The vicar's wife was rather uneasy because Laura had returned to this
  subject, after saying "Do not let us talk of it any more," and she replied
  that she believed that Tomkins had been in the service of Sir John, and with
  him on his travels, but she was not quite sure, but that if this was so, he
  was the only servant of the late baronet now at Leppard Hall, and that, very
  likely, he knew very little.</p>

  <p>Laura seemed impatient with this rambling talk, she remarked how odd it
  was that one who had seemed to her so stupid, just part of the furniture,
  might after all prove to be quite important; then, without giving Madam Mist
  time to reply, she went on talking smoothly and easily of village matters,
  and the parson's wife was considerably pleased at her taking the old tale so
  lightly: she had been led, almost against her own will, to relate it, and she
  had felt that in doing so she was acting treacherously, almost monstrously,
  betraying to the young heiress of the Sarelles the secret they too jealously
  kept. But after all she had made too great fuss about it. Modern young ladies
  were not likely to lose their heads over tragedies of sixty years before.
  Perhaps, indeed, the vicar's wife comforted herself that she had been the
  means of laying an ancient ghost. She had always understood that Laura
  Sarelle was a moody, difficult girl who brooded much over the past, and
  perhaps in a way she had, as it were, lanced an abscess and let the poison
  escape.</p>

  <p>And so she 'tried to console herself, though before her visitor took her
  leave she pressed her hand in her own bony fingers and eagerly besought her
  never to let anyone, especially Sir Theodosius, know that she had explained
  the story of Edward Avershaw to her, his wife's namesake.</p>

  <p>"You can be sure of that," smiled Laura. At the door she paused, and with
  an indifferent air added:</p>

  <p>"What poison did he use?"</p>

  <p>Madam Mist had hoped the story forgotten, but could not resist satisfying
  what seemed a harmless curiosity.</p>

  <p>"It was laurel-water, my dear."</p>

  <p>"Ah, laurel!" She smiled secretly. "I never thought of that. It's just
  what I was looking for&mdash;the laurel beneath my window&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What you were looking for?"</p>

  <p>"I mean&mdash;when you told the story," said Laura smoothly. "I was
  wondering&mdash;I mean looking for what it was&mdash;but he used, you said, a
  distillery."</p>

  <p>"Well, it was laurel-water he distilled. He found it used in the stables
  as a horse-drench, and he learnt from the stableman that it was poison. So he
  thought he would distil some himself on the pretence of making essence of
  roses."</p>

  <p>"Queer it should be laurel when her name was Laura."</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose that's how it came about. The mother was a foolish kind
  of woman, and she had some of the Italian laurel&mdash;that's very poisonous,
  you know, with beautiful berries&mdash;planted underneath the window of
  Laura's bedroom."</p>

  <p>"The bushes are there still. I've noticed them."</p>

  <p>"I believe there is some Italian poetry written on laurel bushes and the
  name Laura," said the vicar's wife. "So it all came together and brought it
  into his mind. And those who considered she was a guilty woman thought that
  she suggested it to him. But he was loyal to her; at least, he never brought
  her into it, though he tried to fix the matter on his mother-in-law."</p>

  <p>"Well, I shan't think of it again," smiled Laura. "It's an old tale, as I
  said before, and you said, Madam Mist. And now I must return home, they'll be
  wondering where I have been so long. There's no need to inform your husband
  that I waited on him. I've nothing to see him about now."</p>

  <p>"No, dear, you came to pay me a visit."</p>

  <p>The two women exchanged a look of feminine understanding.</p>

  <p>"Why should there be any questions asked, or any curiosity aroused?"
  smiled the old woman.</p>

  <p>"One thing more," asked Laura, still standing erect by the door. "Do you
  suppose Sir Theo knows who the portrait is?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't for a moment, my dear. I expect it was taken down at once and
  put up in the attic somewhere and then brought out because it was a fine
  piece, as far as I can remember. It's not very like the engraving," she said
  dubiously.</p>

  <p>"No, it is not. I dare say some people would not recognize it. I did at
  once."</p>

  <p>"Avershaw was a painter himself, you know. He did that for a pastime. They
  say he did some quite fine drawings on his cell with some black cherries sent
  him. That other picture is by him. It looks amateurish compared with his own
  portrait, but that's one he painted of his wife soon after they were married.
  She is wearing the yellow dress, you know, dear. Sir John told us."</p>

  <p>Madam Mist felt this reference was cruel, but could not resist it. Laura
  seemed so cool, so calm, so controlled, that she found it quite easy to talk
  to her of these things in an unembarrassed way. This reference to what had
  undoubtedly been an attempted suicide was received with the greatest
  indifference. Laura began to talk of other things, some gifts she said she
  would send Madam Mist from the Hall.</p>

  <p>"You send me too much," said the vicar's wife. "It is your company I like,
  talks like this." She put her hand behind the cushion supporting her back and
  touched the book. "Tell Agnes to come up, this must go back in its place
  before it's missed. Another time you may, if you will, read it."</p>

  <p>"I think I know enough. Let us forget that you ever told me."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Laura returned to the Hall so absorbed in thought that she noticed nothing
  of what was about her, and a woodman who passed her on the way stared after
  her; so vacant and fixed was her look that it attracted even his dull
  attention.</p>

  <p>When she reached her own room she wrote two letters which she bade Mrs.
  Sylk give immediately to her brother and Mr. Mostyn. These begged the two
  gentlemen to wait on her that afternoon in the music-room and were couched in
  peremptory terms, and Mrs. Sylk, whom she had asked to read them, thought
  that the cool summons would not be obeyed.</p>

  <p>But when, soon after the clock struck four, Laura Sarelle went to the
  music-room, both Sir Theodosius and Mr. Mostyn were there. The elder man,
  under his usual affability, was considerably ill at ease, expecting some
  startling move on the part of the wilful girl. Sir Theodosius looked sickly
  and irritated. He was by the fire that Laura had ordered to be lit, and
  glanced round with distaste at the room, with the covers over the spinet and
  harp, the muslin bag over the chandelier.</p>

  <p>"Why this apartment of all others, my dear Laura?" he demanded. "You
  become more tiresome every day. What important business do you wish to see me
  on?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's an old matter," said Laura, "and one very quickly decided." She
  glanced from one man to the other; she was standing in the centre of the room
  on the space of empty greenish carpet, a long dark-red dress with dark-blue
  fringed shawl showing sombrely against the pale colours of the room with the
  elegant furniture, the French style of decorations.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn was at the window-place; the rain was slashing down, pouring in
  rivulets against the glass so that the prospect of the water-meadows, the
  river and the trees lightly hazed with the first green, were all blurred and
  grey. Such a sombre melancholy invaded his soul that he found it difficult to
  preserve his usual air of worldly gaiety.</p>

  <p>"I want to ask you both if you will release me from my engagement?" said
  Laura. She spoke without any feeling or emotion. First she addressed her
  brother: "I do not think it is a great deal to you, Theo, whom I marry. You
  can have no objection against Lucius save that you quarrelled with him. I
  have those feelings for him that I do not wish to name here. Only women, I
  believe, understand. I want you to let me leave this house. I feel as if I
  were in great danger. I want you to let me and Hetty Sylk go to London and
  live anywhere&mdash;in a hotel, in a hired apartment, what you will, while
  Lucius comes from Ireland for me. And I want you to allow us to be married
  immediately. I shall not ask a penny from you, either now or ever; whatever
  Lucius has is sufficient for me. Please, pray, do not answer." She held up
  her hand as her brother began to rise from the chair, violent words trembling
  on his lips. She turned to Harry Mostyn.</p>

  <p>"I ask you to release me from my engagement, to make it as easy for me as
  possible, so that there is not any of what Mrs. Sylk calls disgrace and
  degradation. I do not want Lucius to be ashamed of me. I believe you only
  wanted to marry me because of my fortune. You cannot possibly care for me, we
  are different in everything and you are so much older and more experienced.
  If I were mistress of my own fortune I would give it to you, the hundred
  thousand that is supposed to be my dowry&mdash;I would give it to you for my
  release. But I am not mistress of it, and I suppose, being a gentleman, you
  would not take it if I had it. Now, please, will you answer me? You speak
  first, Theo."</p>

  <p>"I utterly and completely refuse," said Theodosius viciously. "We have
  been over this ground again and again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please, Theo," interrupted his sister, "say what you have to say in a few
  words, make it short and clear as I did."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, I refuse."</p>

  <p>"Your reasons?" asked Laura.</p>

  <p>"I've given them to you before, I'll give them to you again; I will make
  it, as you say, short and clear. Lucius betrayed me. When he was here in my
  employment he made love to you behind my back."</p>

  <p>"His behaviour to me was absolutely honourable," said Laura quietly, "and
  you know it, Theo."</p>

  <p>"Honourable perhaps in a worldly sense," sneered the brother, "but he
  seduced your mind and spirit, made you what you are now&mdash;rebellious,
  vindictive. He had the impertinence to come to me with a proposal for your
  hand, and he in my employment&mdash;he knew what designs I had for you, what
  hopes for the future. I tell you, I consider it a betrayal. It was
  impertinent, too. It is true he has now an Irish title and a small estate,
  both once forfeited and still beggared, but that in one way of speaking puts
  the proposal even more out of court. How many more times am I to tell you,
  Laura, that you are to marry a man who is willing to take the name of
  Sarelle? Belmont couldn't do that even if he wished. Besides, I dislike the
  fellow. I feel he deceived me, laughed in his sleeve at me, made a fool of
  me. Why, I thought you were like brother and sister together. I trusted him
  with you, and all the while there was this romantic trash going on."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is useless to tell you," said Laura wearily, "that nothing
  was passing between us. It was I who spoke to him. Never mind. That is your
  answer, Theo&mdash;you won't consider it? I tell you, I am in peril."</p>

  <p>"What peril?" he asked shortly. "You talk like an imbecile, Laura. No girl
  could be more carefully guarded and protected than you are."</p>

  <p>"It's not a peril you'd understand," said Laura. She turned to the other
  man. "What is your answer?"</p>

  <p>"My dear girl! My dear child! What a position you put me in! Something has
  upset you, surely. This is not your natural self, Laura."</p>

  <p>She tapped with her foot impatiently, checking his shocked
  protestations.</p>

  <p>"That's what you do, Mr. Mostyn, you make words and escape under the cloud
  of them, like that creature we read of, the cuttlefish. I want a plain
  answer&mdash;will you release me? If you refuse to marry me, my brother
  cannot force us together."</p>

  <p>But Harry Mostyn continued to make words. The diversion was for his sake
  more than for her own. Behind this his mind was darting to and fro quickly.
  Should he seize this opportunity of being rid of both of them, of leaving
  Leppard Hall for ever, of facing his own difficulties in some other way? One
  part of him wanted to do this, the direct, the honourable, the manly thing;
  but the other part of him thought: 'Why should I take notice of a foolish
  girl's hysterics? I think she is a little disordered in her intellect. This
  will make the brother more pleased than ever to get rid of her. I'll seize
  the chance and press for an immediate marriage?</p>

  <p>Laura broke in impatiently on his excuses, and demanded once again that he
  should answer plainly and tell her the truth.</p>

  <p>"Yes, tell her the truth, Mostyn," cried Sir Theo. "Tell her that she's a
  little fool and we'll have no more of this nonsense."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't put it as harshly as that, Theo," protested Mr. Mostyn,
  flushed and uneasy, "but, darling Laura, you cannot expect me to resign you
  as easily as this. Belmont is out of the question. Don't you see, my dear, he
  doesn't even come forward."</p>

  <p>"He wrote to me," said Laura. She glanced towards her brother. "You took
  the letter out of my hand that day in the library. I wrote to him. I gave the
  letter to Hetty Sylk, who promised to post it in Warwick."</p>

  <p>"And of course she <i>did</i> post it," said Mr. Mostyn, soothingly. "But
  your brother wrote pointing out to Lord Belmont how impossible the match was,
  that you were already betrothed to me. He didn't know that when he wrote to
  you. Can't you understand, my dear child, the position you put him in?
  Naturally, when he discovered that you were betrothed, that it had already
  been announced in the London news-sheets, he would withdraw."</p>

  <p>"I wonder, I wonder. I'm like a prisoner here, I can't be sure of getting
  my letters. Many times before they've been kept back. Theo said so. But now
  I'm doing what I accused you of doing&mdash;using words. So you won't let me
  go, Harry?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, for your own sake&mdash;I'm very fond of you. I know I'm much
  older&mdash;I know, perhaps, that you don't care for me&mdash;but I do think
  for your own sake, Laura, that you should marry me and let me take you away
  from Leppard Hall"&mdash;he approached her as he spoke and his voice and his
  look were lover-like&mdash;"to the places that I promised you, Laura."</p>

  <p>She raised her hand and let it fall.</p>

  <p>"Don't try to bribe me. That's all I wanted to know, Harry. Very well,
  then, I've no more to say, now, on this subject."</p>

  <p>She left the room, her head drooping. Mr. Mostyn had feared some emotional
  outburst, and her quiet did not altogether reassure him. He was alarmed to
  see a slight smile upon her lips.</p>

  <p>When he closed behind her the door that he had opened for her, he stood
  dubiously where she had stood in the centre of the green carpet fingering his
  chin. Even now he was tempted to give up the whole business.</p>

  <p>But Sir Theo rose and with great impatience exclaimed: "Take her away,
  Mostyn, for God's sake! Marry Laura and take her away. Perhaps when she comes
  back as a married woman she will be sane. A most spoilt and petulant
  creature, bringing us here for this! That man Delaunay must have bewitched
  her..."</p>

  <p>At this opening all Harry Mostyn's instincts of self-interest rose and he
  said quickly:</p>

  <p>"This thing can't be done helter-skelter style. There's the settlement to
  make, I want it all fair and square. You don't know all of my
  affairs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Theo waved his hand impatiently:</p>

  <p>"What's it matter about your affairs? I've money enough for both of us.
  It's the family and the name I'm thinking of. Can't you take the girl away
  and train her, make her more like an ordinary gentlewoman? Her moods, her
  sulks, her sullenness and her temper, and then her imperious manners, sending
  for us here. My God, if it had been fifty years ago Delaunay and I would have
  crossed swords."</p>

  <p>"I'm willing to agree to anything that you suggest, Theo," said Harry
  Mostyn. "I don't like the present situation. I'd rather Laura was my wife.
  Perhaps I could manage her better. I've not failed with women. Yet, you
  mustn't attach too much importance to these moods of a young, unbroken girl.
  Why, she knows nothing, she's been nowhere. Let her get distracted with a
  little society, a little pleasure, a few friends of her own age."</p>

  <p>"I'll write to Spryce to-night," said Theo. "I'll have everything
  arranged."</p>

  <p>"Had we not better go to town?" Mr. Mostyn saw a chance of making another
  point. He would have given a good deal at that moment to be away from Leppard
  Hall. He kept his back to the window, he could scarcely endure to look at the
  rain-swept casement, the blurred view of river and church, trees and fields
  and park.</p>

  <p>But on this point Sir Theo became obstinate. He was correcting the proofs
  of his book and did not wish to move his papers till that labour was
  finished. Laura might go up and begin to choose her dresses with Mrs. Sylk
  whenever she wished, but he desired that Harry would stay with him, he must
  have some company.</p>

  <p>The florid gentleman almost groaned aloud at this prospect, but finally
  wrung out of the baronet permission to go up to town himself for a few days
  in order to see his own lawyers. He would be busy, there would be a great
  deal to be done. He would have somehow to put a decent appearance on his
  affairs, even at the cost of a little dishonesty. A hundred thousand pounds
  in a few months' time&mdash;he must think of that. He made himself as amiable
  and ingratiating and interesting as possible.</p>

  <p>Before the two men left the music-room the date of Laura's marriage was
  fixed for the middle of June.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>But Mr. Mostyn's nice plans were entirely upset twenty-four hours later by
  a message brought by Mrs. Sylk saying that Laura wished to see him, not in
  the music-room this time but in her own apartment.</p>

  <p>Fearful of another appeal to his better feelings, the unhappy gentleman
  steeled himself for the interview, and his heart sank when he saw Mrs. Sylk
  discreetly leaving him and Laura Sarelle together. He was summoning up all
  his worldly wits and social acumen to meet this embarrassing situation, when
  Laura completely surprised him by turning on him a smiling face and
  saying:</p>

  <p>"My request yesterday was only to test you, Harry. I should have despised
  you if you had given me up. Of course, I've forgotten Lucius Delaunay a long
  while ago. That letter from him the other day only amused me. I'm rather
  sorry for him, he's an amiable fellow. But you are the man I've chosen for my
  husband. Oh, I don't say," she hurried on, as he coloured with pleasure and
  moved closer towards her, "that I'm in love with you or anything like that,
  but I want to get away from Leppard Hall, and you promised me that, didn't
  you? I think Theo's tyrannical. I want to get away from him. You understand,
  don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, my dear girl, I understand perfectly. I think it's a most
  unnatural life for a young lady to live. You know what I propose," and he
  began to run over the usual baits&mdash;Paris, Italy. She hushed him and said
  with a brilliant smile:</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't we run away and be married secretly? You can go to town and
  I have permission too. It can all be arranged with perfect discretion."</p>

  <p>"Laura! I am most deeply flattered. But your reason? Allow me to collect
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my reasons!" She gave them to him.</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn had an alert mind, was used to dealing with a crisis, and was
  very much alive to his own interests. He therefore contrived enough control
  to murmur flattering commonplaces to Laura while deciding what his course
  should be.</p>

  <p>Her proposal at first had seemed to him so startling as to support his
  suspicion that she might be touched by insanity, but when he came to turn it
  over he saw that it was consistent both with the circumstances and her late
  behaviour. Of course, all along, what she had wanted to do was to escape from
  Leppard Hall, so melancholy and uncongenial, and the tyranny of her peevish,
  ailing brother. It was because of this she had betrothed herself to him,
  Harry Mostyn; because of that, no doubt, she had been eager to accept the
  proposal of Lord Belmont that offered, she thought, an instant escape from
  her surroundings and her master. Finding that attempt had come to nothing,
  she was turning again to him, reaffirming her wish to have him as her
  husband, but urging him to take her away immediately and secretly.</p>

  <p>The proposal was not so crazy; indeed, it had some points in its favour.
  While he was murmuring protestations of being entirely at her service and
  only wishing to act for her own good, Mr. Mostyn was coming to the conclusion
  that her suggestion would be very convenient for himself. He would secure
  immediately, without any question or disclosure of his own damaged resources,
  a fortune of a hundred thousand pounds. This Sir Theodosius would have to pay
  on his marriage, whether he was exasperated by the duplicity or not. He could
  not, as Mr. Mostyn quickly calculated, say that the marriage had taken place
  without his knowledge, for the announcement of it had already been put in the
  Press. It was known to all their friends and acquaintances.</p>

  <p>Of course it might be a little difficult and might even be a little
  scandalous to explain why he and Laura had married so suddenly and without
  any ceremony, but he thought that it was a thing that might be glossed over.
  People could be told that the girl was shy, retiring, and disliked ceremony
  and wished to disappoint expectations of the gossips who had hoped to see the
  great heiress make a pompous display at her marriage; friends could be told,
  too, in the most discreet manner possible, something of the truth: Laura had
  been anxious to escape from the tutelage of her brother and the dreary
  surroundings of Leppard Hall.</p>

  <p>There were, of course, his future relationships with Sir Theodosius to be
  thought of. Would the baronet, outraged by the elopement and secret marriage,
  cut his sister and brother-in-law off from the estate, leave them nothing in
  his will? Mr. Mostyn did not think so, because there was the great bribe of
  the name-change. If Sir Theodosius refused to make his sister his
  heiress&mdash;and Mr. Mostyn was not quite sure that he had the power to do
  so, he believed that Laura must inevitably succeed to the Leppard Hall
  estate&mdash;but if by any trick or twist of the law he did try to cut her
  out, then Harry Mostyn would be able to wound the young baronet on his
  tenderest point by refusing to adopt the name and arms of Sarelle.</p>

  <p>At this point in his calculations that accompanied his running murmur of
  soothing conversation with Laura he was pulled up short again by realizing
  that he had assumed that he was likely to be the heir of a man young enough
  to be his son, or at any rate considerably younger than himself.</p>

  <p>He tried to steady these rather wild speculations by repeating to himself
  that, for all his appearance of delicacy, Sir Theodosius was probably in
  extremely good health and might marry and have a family of his own.</p>

  <p>At any rate there would be the hundred thousand pounds, and there would be
  other pickings also, for Sir Theodosius might make him a sufficient allowance
  if he expected him to live at Leppard Hall and keep up the establishment.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn was caught up in the middle of his reflections by Laura saying
  clearly:</p>

  <p>"Do you agree, or do you not, Harry?"</p>

  <p>She leaned forward and put her hand over his, and looked straight into his
  eyes. He had tried to think at first, as a man will whenever a woman says
  anything original or startling, that she was hysterical, or half crazy, but
  he had to admit now that she appeared very cool and reasonable. She had
  argued out her position very clearly before she had put it into words.
  Begging him to hush his compliments, to which she paid little attention, she
  further explained herself, and in her explanation she confirmed much of what
  he had already thought out for himself.</p>

  <p>Her main desire was to escape from Leppard Hall and the life she led
  there, and the constant supervision of her brother. And she argued that Sir
  Theodosius was capricious and whimsical and likely to delay her marriage from
  month to month, and that the only way to bring him to a point would be for
  the two of them to go away and get married secretly, then to return and face
  him with the accomplished fact.</p>

  <p>"He may rage and be angry," she said with a cool smile, "but he'll have to
  accept it, won't he? And he can't, as I understand from Mr. Spryce, withhold
  my dowry. That must be mine unless he has actually forbidden the marriage.
  And, of course, he has given his consent publicly and privately, everyone
  knows that."</p>

  <p>These were Harry Mostyn's own thoughts as he murmured acquiescence in her
  plans, but for appearance' sake he thought it would be better to speak with
  Sir Theodosius once again, try to persuade him to agree to an early marriage,
  say in a month or six weeks, when his sister could be properly provided.</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn said this to flatter her feminine vanity, but Laura lifted
  her thin shoulders and declared that she had enough clothes to last her for a
  twelvemonth. It seemed to him out of character, as he knew her to be vain and
  very fond of finery.</p>

  <p>She spoke again with the same tranquil easiness and told him that she had
  arranged everything. Theodosius was perfectly willing that she should go to
  town, on some of these mantua-maker visits, she said, and had even arranged
  rooms for her with Mrs. Sylk and some servants in Queen Street, that was off
  Holborn. And she could slip away one day&mdash;"There is such a thing as
  special licence, is there not?" she said. "Or if the banns must be put up,
  well, we can wait a few weeks. Do you agree, Harry? I ask you once
  again."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to do anything hole-and-corner," he replied, "or to annoy
  your brother by anything that seems disrespectful to you. You know, for the
  rest, my dear, I'm entirely at your service."</p>

  <p>To this Laura replied suddenly:</p>

  <p>"Marry me as soon as may be and say nothing of it to Theo until I give you
  the word. Come," she added, raising her head and looking at him sideways,
  "this suits your plans, does it not? You have not to disclose your affairs,
  there need be no formal visits to lawyers, no drawing-up of deeds or
  contracts. I have been to Mr. Spryce and know how my affairs stand. You will
  automatically come into possession of my dowry."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn, accomplished man of the world as he was, was taken aback,
  startled, and almost embarrassed by her clear reading of his mind. 'She is an
  extraordinary woman,' he thought; 'at one minute a wild, wilful girl, at the
  other moment shrewd and experienced.'</p>

  <p>"Meet me half-way," she urged. "If you don't please me in this, Harry, I
  swear you'll lose all. I'll go to Theo and, whatever the disgrace, I'll
  declare I won't marry you."</p>

  <p>He believed she was capable of that, and he saw that she was in no mood to
  be played with, so he agreed, though with some inner dismay, to her
  extraordinary proposal that in many ways was distasteful to him. He was not
  of a romantic temperament or of a romantic age, he did not wish to make a
  fool of himself by a clandestine marriage. On the other hand, there were more
  serious matters to consider than the possibility of his being made to look a
  fool.</p>

  <p>Laura was right when she said that Theo was eccentric and difficult to the
  point of being impossible to deal with. He might easily, under one excuse or
  another, as the caprice took him, put off the marriage from month to month.
  He might also, when he saw the account of Harry Mostyn's affairs, refuse
  altogether to consent to it. No, it would be better to do the audacious
  thing, even perhaps the rash thing, and marry Laura. If he was her husband,
  Harry Mostyn felt that he would be in a much stronger position, able to
  dictate terms to her brother if he played his cards properly.</p>

  <p>He believed, too, that he could marry Laura privately without offending
  Theo. He could always tell him that the girl had been so difficult, whimsical
  and fanciful that that was the only way to obtain a mastery over her...</p>

  <p>But there was something base about his part in the whole affair that irked
  him. He never could stay for more than a few hours in Leppard Hall without
  having this sense of his own ill-behaviour, almost his own villainy, come
  over him. He did not care to deceive a man who was his host, he did not care
  to be made the tool of a girl's caprice, or whatever it was that was
  influencing Laura.</p>

  <p>But self-interest overruled all these other considerations. Harry Mostyn
  made up his mind to take Laura and her large dowry while he could get her. He
  kept his own counsel and made his own plans.</p>

  <p>Before he left Leppard Hall the next day he had assured Laura, in a
  private interview snatched in the music-room, that he agreed to the secret
  marriage and would make all preparations.</p>

  <p>Laura came down to the pilastered porch to see him depart. It was a clear,
  cool day, for spring was late and chilly. Laura wore a little quilted jacket
  of dark velvet, a purple so dense in shade as almost to be black, that set
  off very becomingly, Mr. Mostyn thought, the delicate fairness of her skin,
  the lustre of her dark curls.</p>

  <p>Before he and Flasket stepped into the carriage she begged him to pick for
  her a spray of the laurel that grew in front of the house against the lower
  window to the left. It was that graceful variety of the shrub known as the
  "Poet's Laurel", with long, fine-pointed leaves. Laura told him that it had
  been placed there by her namesake many years ago, and indeed the trunk of the
  tree was thick and gnarled.</p>

  <p>"The stems are very tough," she added. "I have great difficulty in
  plucking them myself."</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn pulled down two of the smaller and more easily reached
  sprays, the small leaves showing against the darker, and gave them to her.
  This was one of her whims, of course, this play upon her name and the laurel
  bush...He remembered that sprig held by the girl in the yellow dress in the
  portrait, the two sculptured boughs in the church, and the association was
  not very pleasant to him, though he did not quite know why...Laura smiled at
  him innocently.</p>

  <p>"I think it is a charming plant. It looks well with those hothouse flowers
  I have in my room."</p>

  <p>She then held up her face for his kiss, and he thought that after all she
  was a seductive and charming creature and that once these difficulties and
  embarrassments were over he might be quite content with her as his wife, and
  that apart from her golden dowry.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk was standing in the porch, shivering in the cold air. Laura had
  asked her to come down; Mr. Mostyn wondered why; the elder lady had arrived
  only in time to see the carriage drive down the long avenue and to meet Laura
  returning with the laurel sprays.</p>

  <p>"Why, you are determined to look like the portrait," said she uneasily,
  for she did not care to see anything that might remind both Laura and herself
  of the unhappy day when the girl had worn the yellow silk dress that had
  belonged to the other Laura Sarelle.</p>

  <p>"Oh no!" Laura shook her head. "It was not my idea at all. Why, we've been
  here nearly three years now, and I never thought to pick the laurel before.
  No, Harry Mostyn told me he would like me"&mdash;she paused and looked down
  at the glossy, pointed leaves with the hard, small white flowers in her
  hand&mdash;"to distil these leaves for him. He said they made a potent
  essence, a perfume that he was very fond of. But I wasn't to tell anybody,
  that it was to be a secret."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk paid very little attention to these words; she thought that Mr.
  Mostyn was humouring some whim of the girl, who seemed always to have some
  fanciful desire to associate herself with laurels and her dead namesake. She
  was glad to see the two betrothed people on such apparently good terms and to
  feel that the episode with Lucius Delaunay had been forgotten by Laura
  already and therefore could never have been of much importance.</p>

  <p>So she said vaguely:</p>

  <p>"Essence of laurel leaves? I never heard of it..."</p>

  <p>"Well, Harry has. But pray don't tell anybody I told you, Mrs. Sylk, will
  you? Especially Theo. It is to be a secret. It is supposed to be a most
  wonderful essence for both colour and scent."</p>

  <p>"Indeed no, I shall not mention it to your brother. Why should I?" smiled
  Mrs. Sylk. "He never asks about your pastimes, Laura. I don't think he even
  knows that you work in the distillery. It is just sufficient, if he ever does
  ask after you, to say that you are engaged on household tasks. He is
  perfectly satisfied, so long as you live at Leppard Hall and make no trouble
  for him, my dear."</p>

  <p>"So this is my little secret and Harry's," smiled Laura. "Once more,
  <i>pray don't</i> mention it to anyone. I'm curious myself to see what this
  experiment results in. If you don't see much of me for the next few days you
  will know what I am doing&mdash;distilling the essence for my beloved."</p>

  <p>"Your beloved!" repeated Mrs. Sylk lightly, as the two women went up the
  wide, shallow, graceful stairs. "I'm pleased to hear you call him
  that..."</p>

  <p>"Anyone would be my beloved who would take me away from Leppard Hall,"
  smiled Laura, "and he has promised to do that quite soon."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>That evening Laura left Leppard Hall as the dusk was falling for her now
  customary walk along the banks of the Avon; she usually stopped short at the
  churchyard and turned back across the fields and the parkland. Sometimes Mrs.
  Sylk accompanied her on this excursion, sometimes one of the maids, but
  to-night she was alone. She had been in such good spirits of late that Mrs.
  Sylk had ceased to watch her so anxiously as she had done in the past; still,
  it was not very easy for her to slip away unobserved, and she hastened lest
  she might be followed and brought back before she had accomplished what she
  had set out to do.</p>

  <p>She had undertaken something that might have proved difficult, tiresome,
  or impossible, but by sheer chance was extremely easy. Passing the
  churchyard, and never glancing at the graves or the spire, but keeping her
  eyes on the footpath by the river, she turned in at the little wooden gate of
  the parsonage, passed through the garden, where the air was now heavy with
  the scent of pinks and night stocks, and opened the door, cautiously raising
  the latch. She had no fear of meeting the Reverend Nathaniel Mist because she
  knew that he was in Warwick, where he had gone to visit a relative and
  consult Dr. Selby about his swollen legs.</p>

  <p>She had to be very careful about the sharp ears of Madam Mist; Agnes, the
  maid, too, might come out into the passage at any moment. Of course it would
  not matter very much, she would be able to give quite a good excuse for her
  intrusion, but it would cause a little comment if she had been seen coming
  thus unceremoniously into the parsonage. It might be remembered
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>She paused in the hall; here it was quite dark, for no lamps or candles
  had been lit. She had noted the faint light in Madam Mist's room; no doubt
  the little servant was up with the invalid woman settling her bed, or reading
  the Bible, or coaxing her to drink her posset.</p>

  <p>Laura opened the little door on the right, slipped into the parson's
  library, where everything was neat and tidy, the desk locked, the worn
  armchair in place.</p>

  <p>There was still sufficient light for her to discern the bookcase, for a
  pearly glow of late evening fell through the wide window, the curtains not
  yet having been drawn.</p>

  <p>She found the book she wanted, that which contained the account of the
  trial of Captain Edward Avershaw, placed it in the folds of her shawl and
  glided again out of the room, down the passage, out of the gate, and along
  the garden path.</p>

  <p>At the gate she paused, looking up at the window from which came the faint
  blur of light. She felt elated with her own silence and cleverness. No one
  had heard her, it was clear, or Madam Mist would have sent the girl to go
  rapping at the window and ask her business and to beg her to come up for a
  gossip.</p>

  <p>The parson's lady had been most uneasy in her mind since she had given her
  dreadful confidences to Laura, and had sent her up one or two little notes
  that contained only formal wording, but were, Laura knew, the result of
  desperation, begging the girl to come and see her. Laura knew that she wanted
  to beseech her again and again to preserve complete secrecy. But she did not
  intend to expose herself to the entreaties of the sick woman, whom she
  heartily disliked. She had, therefore, replied politely to these letters in
  terms that anybody might read but that she hoped would assuage some of the
  anxiety of Madam Mist, and prevent her from sending some letter or message
  that might fall into the hands of her brother.</p>

  <p>She had heard that the vicar's lady's illness had taken on a more serious
  turn and that it was partly on her account that the Reverend Nathaniel had
  gone to Warwick.</p>

  <p>'Distress of mind,' thought Laura. 'She had her enjoyment. She greatly
  relished telling me that tale, now she must pay for it.'</p>

  <p>The girl smiled to herself to think how successful she had been. Really,
  it was quite easy to do what seemed an outrageous or a difficult action if
  you only had the courage and deftness. She hastened back to the Hall, anxious
  to use the last light, and met Mrs. Sylk in the avenue, searching for her
  with some concern. Laura laughed quite loudly and tucked her hand in the
  crook of the elder woman's arm.</p>

  <p>Lying readily, she said she had been down to the Mill, where Tampion's
  little daughter was ill, "but recovering, and I have promised to-morrow to
  take her some books&mdash;some of those old picture-books that I had, you
  know, when I was a child."</p>

  <p>Laura laughed again, pressed the thin volume tightly in her shawl.</p>

  <p>"Your picture-books?" said Mrs. Sylk, slightly frowning.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I forgot, I have not got them any longer. My childish things were
  destroyed, weren't they, when I came here, when Aunt Tollis died. No, I've
  nothing at all, have I&mdash;nothing of those pleasant days?"</p>

  <p>Laura still seemed in high spirits; she was indeed pretty well satisfied
  with her own achievements, which she brought to a successful conclusion
  before she went to bed by hiding the book under a pile of thick silken skirts
  in a tall chest of tulipwood, locking it, and placing the key in the little
  reticule of black velvet embroidered with beads which she was now careful
  never to leave out of her sight.</p>

  <h2>PART THREE</h2>

  <p class="first">LORD BELMONT, after all, could not accept without a struggle
  the dismissal given him in the letter written by Sir Theodosius. He much
  suspected that Laura's hand had not been in this, nor in her announced
  marriage to Harry Mostyn, and his suspicions were confirmed when he had come
  to London, being unable to remain in Ireland, and had had a short
  conversation with Mr. Spryce, who showed himself friendly and even warm
  towards the young peer.</p>

  <p>The lawyer was half inclined to confide in Lord Belmont, tell him the
  whole history of the Sarelles, the ugly story and scandal that had ended the
  main line, and even the direction in the other Laura Sarelle's will, that
  Leppard Hall should be razed to the ground. But natural prudence prevailed
  and he decided not to give away a secret that was not his. He did, however,
  try to convey to Lord Belmont that he thought Sir Theodosius was exceedingly
  eccentric, that it was not wise for Laura to remain at Leppard Hall, and that
  he, Lord Belmont, her first suitor, was far more suitable as her husband than
  Mr. Mostyn, of whom, though he had no definite charge against him, Mr. Spryce
  had no very good opinion.</p>

  <p>Having learnt from the lawyer some details of his rival&mdash;that Mr.
  Mostyn was much older than Laura, a widower, known for his extravagant habits
  and as a frequenter of gambling-hells and racecourses&mdash;hearing, too,
  from Mr. Spryce that the great bribe had been the offer of the change of
  name, Lord Belmont decided to make an effort to see Laura herself before, as
  he put it, "it is too late for both of us".</p>

  <p>He had been told that she was in town and had been given her address by
  Mr. Spryce, and now he waited before the neat, plain brick house without any
  pretensions where the two women, Mrs. Sylk and Laura, lodged. It was off Bond
  Street in a select and genteel neighbourhood, but it had no ostentation about
  it. Indeed, it seemed to Lord Belmont to have a slightly clandestine air;
  everything that the Sarelles did was out of the way; all the trouble had
  started from the austere kind of life they lived at Leppard Hall...He
  remembered that now, frowning, as he pulled the bell. How had he endured it
  for two years? He had had, certainly, the rhythm of his own duties, his own
  activities, his own pleasures, yet he looked back on it as a fixed, dreadful
  scene in his mind&mdash;the water-meadows, the twisting river that raced at
  the mill, the dark and sombre&mdash;nay, awful&mdash;façade of Leppard
  Hall.</p>

  <p>He recalled Laura; her picture was often in his mind: Laura in the antique
  yellow dress standing on the path beside the river speaking to him so
  earnestly, and what had followed, and his own expulsion from Leppard Hall.
  Surely she had been sincere?</p>

  <p>He could not believe that in so short a time she had given her affections
  to another man, but rather that she was being wrought upon by her eccentric,
  cruel brother, and an adventurer, greedy for her fortune. Lord Belmont had
  scarcely hoped that he would be able to see her without difficulty, but the
  maidservant showed him without demur into a coldly furnished parlour,
  comfortable but conventional, before he had time to give his name.</p>

  <p>And there was Laura, standing in a rigid attitude by a small round table
  as if she were alert and expectant.</p>

  <p>Lord Belmont saw immediately that he had been mistaken for somebody else.
  No doubt it was Harry Mostyn for whom she had been waiting. She gave him,
  indeed, a dreadful look, not what he had expected, not surprise only, but
  terror. She put her fingers to her lips as if to hush a scream.</p>

  <p>"Laura! I have startled you! I did not mean to do so. There was hardly
  time for me to write to you, and our letters, I fear, have been tampered
  with."</p>

  <p>"Never fear," she said; she still looked at him more as if she spoke to a
  spectre than to a living man, "we shall come together. I have arranged
  everything."</p>

  <p>"Laura! Tell me your affairs, don't look so wild, dear girl. What has
  happened since I left you last? Could you have found no means of
  communicating with me?"</p>

  <p>"I have been like a prisoner, you know that. You must not stay here now.
  Oh, why did you ever go away!" she suddenly exclaimed, with a warmer note in
  her voice. "It was not fair&mdash;nay, it was cruel&mdash;to leave me alone
  in that place. Now I've planned everything."</p>

  <p>"Laura, you must explain yourself. As you said just now, we may have very
  little time together. I am willing to do anything you wish. Do you desire me
  to wait on your brother again, to try to persuade him? I was his friend once,
  surely he will listen to reason?"</p>

  <p>"No, Lucius, he won't. I'm to marry Harry Mostyn because he will take the
  name of Sarelle."</p>

  <p>"Who is this man? I don't wish to say anything against one whom you have
  accepted as your future husband, Laura."</p>

  <p>"Don't say anything!" Again she made that curious, half-sly gesture of her
  finger to her lips. "How strange that you should come to London to-day!"</p>

  <p>"I've been in London a day or two, Laura, but I waited on Mr. Spryce. I
  didn't even know that you were in town. I was prepared to go to Leppard
  Hall."</p>

  <p>"You must never go there! That is a place that we must never visit!"</p>

  <p>He was bewildered by her manner and by her look, her gesture, that finger
  on the lips. Coming close to her, he asked earnestly:</p>

  <p>"Laura, have you any regard for me still? We have been separated so long,
  perhaps I'm a fool to think that you still care."</p>

  <p>"It is you, and no one else," she said in a hurried whisper, as if giving
  a confidence; "it is you and no one else, always, Lucius. But now is not the
  time. And if you were found here it might spoil everything."</p>

  <p>"You cannot go on with this marriage&mdash;this other man must be told. Do
  you not see how foolish, how wrong, it is, Laura? I do not want your money;
  I'll forgo any claim on the Sarelle estate. If the taking of the name is the
  bribe your brother wants, perhaps something can be done about that."</p>

  <p>Laura shook her head, murmuring vehemently:</p>

  <p>"No! No!"</p>

  <p>Then the door was hastily opened and Mrs. Sylk entered the room. She was
  in such a state of violent, barely controlled agitation that Lord Belmont
  felt his heart chill as if he had stepped into the midst of some ugly
  tragedy. What was the matter with these two women?</p>

  <p>He said, almost against his own volition, for he was prudent and usually
  controlled himself:</p>

  <p>"Laura, let me take you away from this house, from all thought of Leppard
  Hall and your brother."</p>

  <p>She moved across the room, touched Mrs. Sylk on the arm and murmured,
  "Remember, this is secret!" and left the two together.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake," said the young man, not in any violence but with deep
  meaning, "tell me what has happened."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think I'd better tell you," sighed Mrs. Sylk, looking at him
  fixedly. He thought that she had been weeping, her eyes were blurred, the
  lids wrinkled. "Because you must go away. Who would have thought that to-day,
  of all days, you would have come here! Sometimes I do think Fate dogs this
  wretched family. And now I'm talking like a silly old gossiping wife."</p>

  <p>Lord Belmont took the distracted woman, so she seemed to him, by the arm,
  and led her to the chair in the window-place.</p>

  <p>"I have been away too long, I'm afraid," he said quietly, "but tell me as
  calmly as you can what has happened I think it is simple enough&mdash;Laura
  was overruled by her brother to marry this man, who was a connection, and he
  is to take the name. Is not that it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's part of it." Mrs. Sylk dabbed her face, already damp with
  tears, with a handkerchief that she pulled out of the pocket of her girdle.
  "And another part of it is that he, though I'm saying nothing against him,
  though he's too old for her, is anxious for her fortune and is willing to put
  up with her whims, as no doubt he calls them. Yes, that's another of it, too,
  sir," said Mrs. Sylk. "I know it all, I've been beside them all the time. Sir
  Theodosius becomes more eccentric every week. They're both, I believe, a
  little unsettled in their wits."</p>

  <p>"I should have seen it before," said Lord Belmont bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I blame myself for letting it happen. It was as if I were under an
  enchantment, but she was very young, and I was in her brother's employment.
  But now you must help me to take her away; she tells me you have been her
  true friend&mdash;this marriage is absurd."</p>

  <p>"If only you had come a day or two ago!" whimpered Mrs.</p>

  <p>Sylk, beginning to sob out loud. "Something might have been done! But now
  it's too late! And I can't endure any more, I can't really!"</p>

  <p>"But, Mrs. Sylk," insisted the young man earnestly, "she cares for me, she
  told me so just now. They have been tampering with our letters, everything
  possible has been put between us. I've had my misfortunes too, the cholera,
  mourning for my relatives, an illness of my own&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush," implored Mrs. Sylk. She rose and crossed the room and glanced
  between the straight muslin curtains. "He'll be here any moment&mdash;Mr.
  Mostyn, I mean. I suppose that's how you were shown in. They knew we were
  expecting him and thought you were he. Oh, the confusion of it all! But I'm
  not supposed to tell you. It's a secret, and I was sworn to keep it."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Lord Belmont gently, "don't tell me anything that you've
  sworn to keep secret, Mrs. Sylk. I shall go down to Leppard Hall to-day or
  to-morrow, as it's too late now. Or perhaps first I'll wait on Mr.
  Mostyn."</p>

  <p>"No, that you mustn't do!" cried the distracted woman. She turned round
  again with a look of stark terror. "I shall have to tell you, or maybe
  there'll be murder. Laura married Harry Mostyn this morning."</p>

  <p>As she spoke she turned away so that she might not see her hearer's face,
  and hurried on:</p>

  <p>"It was done secretly. I don't know at whose instance, whether he pressed
  her or she wished it. I can't get anything coherent out of her. She went
  willingly, and seemed eager too. She confided in me. I was there at the
  church. They had the banns called secretly. No one is to know anything about
  it."</p>

  <p>Lord Belmont walked up and down the room; Mrs. Sylk was still keeping her
  anxious watch at the window. When he spoke it was in a very quiet, colourless
  tone:</p>

  <p>"This marriage might be annulled if she has been forced into it."</p>

  <p>"But I tell you she seemed willing, even eager."</p>

  <p>"But what's the excuse for it, a secret marriage when they are
  betrothed?"</p>

  <p>"The excuse is that Sir Theo kept making delays, he doesn't want to leave
  Leppard Hall. He puts off the arrangements. He can't be bothered or concerned
  with any society or ceremony. And she's half mad to get away from the place,
  and Mr. Mostyn, I suppose, wants her money, and so they have contrived it
  between them."</p>

  <p>"She's not to live with him as his wife?"</p>

  <p>"No. I don't think she knows anything of what that means even. She's to
  live in the same way with me, calling herself Laura Sarelle. Still, what they
  think, or she or he thinks, I don't know. I tell you I have not the right of
  it even now&mdash;I don't know when she'll consider it the moment to tell
  Theo, and I suppose it will be on the first quarrel," hurried on Mrs. Sylk.
  "She will be able to turn round and say, 'I'm a married woman. I'm going off
  with Mr. Mostyn,' and he wouldn't be able to withhold the dowry since he has
  given public consent to the marriage. And now you can see why you can go,
  sir."</p>

  <p>"She could never have cared for me after all, then," mused the young man,
  speaking as if to himself and as if he had forgotten anyone else was present,
  "and yet I can scarcely believe it. There's something behind all this. Theo
  must be, after all, a fool, at least in worldly matters, and this other man
  is a scoundrel."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. He's amiable and affable and seems kind to her. Perhaps
  she truly likes him, even loves him, sir, I don't know. What was her manner
  to you just now?"</p>

  <p>"Strange, I couldn't take her meaning. She seemed anxious for me to go.
  Laura married! It's hardly credible! I always thought she'd wait for me till
  she was her own mistress."</p>

  <p>Then, in the midst of his own distress and bewilderment, Lord Belmont
  remembered the agitation he was causing this unfortunate distracted woman,
  who was, he knew, a true friend to Laura, so he pressed her hand and said: "I
  certainly will go. I can do no good here. If I stay it might provoke a
  quarrel. I believe I could scarcely contain myself either if I saw this man
  or Sir Theo. Well, she's another man's wife now. Mrs. Sylk, be her friend and
  do what you can for her. You know where I am; if any trouble or difficulty
  arises, send for me immediately."</p>

  <p>He could say no more, his fine face was haggard and his beautiful voice
  harsh with emotion. Mrs. Sylk gave him a piteous look as if she could
  scarcely bear to let him go, although she was anxious to avoid his meeting
  Harry Mostyn. She shook her head from side to side, saying stupidly:</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to make of it! I don't know what to make of it!"</p>

  <p>"Be as kind to her as you can," urged Lord Belmont. "Say that I uttered
  nothing in the way of reproaches, that I was not even offended. Give her
  nothing but kindness."</p>

  <p>He was gone, not able to say anything more. And Mrs. Sylk thought: 'He
  fears, as I do, that her intellect is disordered.' She hurried again to the
  window and watched him hastening, like a man bemused, up the narrow street.
  She remembered then with a pang that she had omitted to exact a promise of
  secrecy from him, but she was soon satisfied. He would never betray Laura,
  she believed that he was 'a true lover as well as an honourable man'; those
  were the simple words her simple mind employed.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>From an upper window Laura Sarelle also watched Lord Belmont hastening
  down the street. Her face took on a tender expression, and her lips, which
  lately had been firmly compressed, became soft and smiling She did not look
  regretful or remorseful, but rather pleased and triumphant.</p>

  <p>"He loves me," she murmured to herself, "he loves me! And they shall not
  separate us for long."</p>

  <p>She heard the bell ring again after she had stood there for a while. No
  doubt that was Mr. Mostyn, her husband; she was Laura Mostyn now. The two men
  must have passed in the street. Well, he could wait a while.</p>

  <p>She sat down at the small table with the muslin flounces where her papers
  were spread out and pulled out of the bosom of the grey gown that was her
  wedding-dress the gold ring that he had put on her hand, and she stared at
  it, and a sly smile touched her lips. It seemed to stretch and widen until
  from a band of gold it had turned into a collar of hemp.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Harry Mostyn accompanied the two ladies on their return to Leppard Hall
  with mingled feelings of satisfaction, almost amounting to triumph, and
  uneasiness almost amounting to humiliation. On the one hand, he had secured
  the Sarelle heiress and her hundred thousand pounds, together with the
  reversion of her very considerable estate; on the other hand, he had
  certainly been the subject of what seemed a rather meaningless caprice on the
  part of a spoilt girl. He would have to reverse their relies when they were
  married, he thought. And then he remembered that they were married already.
  When they lived together as man and wife, he corrected himself.</p>

  <p>So far she had proved wild and shy, refusing even a kiss, and he himself
  was so little attracted towards her that he found this rather a relief than a
  deprivation. He was willing to put off as long as possible the day when he
  would have to play the lover to Laura Sarelle.</p>

  <p>He had felt discomfited, almost shamed, when he made the arrangements for
  the secret marriage, and humbled in the presence of Mrs. Sylk, who had been
  in the confidence of the whole intrigue. Nor was he pleased to be about to
  enter Leppard Hall, that odious residence, again, and have to face Sir
  Theodosius, a man whom, however one might try to gloss it over, he had
  tricked and deceived.</p>

  <p>He had tried, before they left London, to get, if he could, some sense out
  of Laura. How long did she want this comedy to be played? When was the
  marriage to be announced? She had put him off, saying that she would let him
  know her wishes soon enough.</p>

  <p>The mortified bridegroom's only consolation was that poor Mrs. Sylk
  commended him for his very gallant, affable and considerate behaviour to "the
  poor, wild girl", as she put it in her agitated asides.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn's uneasiness increased because he rather feared some
  melodramatic scene when they reached Leppard Hall. He thought that Laura
  might place her wedding-ring on her finger, rush to her brother's library and
  announce her wedding, declaring that she meant at once to leave the house
  that she had always found hateful. For Mr. Mostyn could see no other possible
  reason for this wish for the clandestine marriage but an excuse to leave
  Leppard Hall at once.</p>

  <p>To his surprise she did nothing of the kind, but settled into her own
  routine in the household as if she were not even a wife in name. She was very
  agreeable to him and encouraged him to come and help her in the distillery.
  He disliked this bare, cell-like room, as it seemed to him, in which she
  worked, but in order to humour her, and because there was not much else to
  do, he would sit there sometimes for an hour together as she moved about
  cleverly and prettily among her pots and jars.</p>

  <p>More than once she sent him to pick laurel leaves from the large tree that
  grew in front of the house, but always in a secret kind of way, early in the
  morning or when the light was fading in the evening. She said she was
  preparing some essence that was to be a surprise for Theodosius.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn gave in to this woman's foolery, as he called it, and took the
  opportunity in these solitary conversations with Laura of endeavouring to
  induce her to give him some enlightenment about their future.</p>

  <p>But she always put him off, saying they 'were very well as they were'. She
  hoped that in a few days, perhaps in a week or so, their affairs would come
  to a crisis.</p>

  <p>"And then there will be a pretty scene with your brother, my dear Laura,"
  he said. "I can't see that we've done ourselves much good. I hope you and
  Mrs. Sylk will both do me the justice to say that I was not the originator of
  this scheme and I only gave in to it to please you."</p>

  <p>When he said this Laura gave him a queer, sidelong look.</p>

  <p>"Oh, everything will be explained to Theo," she smiled. "No need to
  concern yourself about that, Harry. And, of course, he must be told very
  soon. I don't intend to stay in Leppard Hall," she added with a touch of
  wildness, "an hour longer than I can help. Do you like that gold-flecked
  Venetian glass I gave you for your chamber? I think that it is very
  handsome."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>A short while after this return of Laura, Mrs. Sylk, and Harry Mostyn to
  Leppard Hall, Madam Mist, the parson's wife, died suddenly&mdash;of a stroke,
  Dr. Selby said&mdash;and when news was brought to the Hall Laura showed such
  signs of excitement and even pleasure that Mrs. Sylk was further alarmed for
  her state of mind.</p>

  <p>'Surely,' thought the anxious woman, 'her wits are deranged. What had
  Madam Mist ever done to her? Why, they can't have met for weeks, months. When
  was it she last called at the parsonage?&mdash;I know she was always
  reluctant to go there and cared nothing, I thought, for the old dame, yet one
  would think her worst enemy had been taken off the earth.'</p>

  <p>But Laura soon recovered the calm and tranquil spirits that she had shown
  since the last London visit. She gave no one any difficulty. She never
  complained any more of the two portraits. Indeed, Mrs. Sylk had noticed her
  glancing at them when they sat at their meals, the four of them, as if she
  approved of them and regarded them with secret satisfaction.
  Sometimes&mdash;or was Mrs. Sylk imagining this?&mdash;the girl seemed to
  raise her glass and touch her lips to it at the same time as she glanced at
  the portrait of Laura Sarelle and the unknown man. Sometimes, too, she smiled
  in a secretive way and her lips seemed to move as if she was whispering a
  conversation with those two painted figures.</p>

  <p>Neither Sir Theo nor Mr. Mostyn noticed these I delicate, almost
  imperceptible movements and glances on the part of Laura, and Mrs. Sylk told
  herself that she was becoming fanciful and imagining all kinds of nonsense
  herself.</p>

  <p>The good lady had many excuses for her own secret agitation. The situation
  was so strange, the Hall even on these early summer days so gloomy, Sir
  Theo's health gave rise to such continued anxiety, he often had to leave the
  table shaken by a fit of coughing or prostrated by an attack of faintness.
  Then there was always the fear, on Mrs. Sylk's part, that the secret marriage
  might come out in some undesirable way, that they might have been spied on,
  might have been betrayed, that Lord Belmont might lose patience and arrive at
  Leppard Hall and demand an explanation from Sir Theo, or from Laura
  herself.</p>

  <p>But none of these things had happened. The days had slipped by in the
  monotonous routine of country-life days, and Laura took her walks, sewed her
  embroidery, and worked at what Sir Theo sneeringly called her "housewifely
  arts", and Mr. Mostyn rode and went into Rugby and Warwick and picked up what
  friends he could in the neighbouring houses, and mustered what patience he
  could, and now and then, with all the affable tact at his command, tried to
  bring the subject of his marriage up with the young baronet.</p>

  <p>And it was just as Laura had said it would be: Sir Theo put the date off.
  They must wait until his health recovered; better to let the summer go by and
  they could be married in the autumn. Perhaps he would go abroad and spend the
  winter and spring in a milder climate.</p>

  <p>Laura nodded at Harry Mostyn and said: "You see how it is; now we hold the
  winning card. We can trump his hand whenever we will."</p>

  <p>'It's got to be soon, my dear,' thought Mr. Mostyn, considering his own
  debts. He did not dare tell his creditors that he was already the husband of
  Laura Sarelle, but he longed to put his hands on her dowry. The farce, as he
  termed it, could not be kept up much longer. If the girl did not see some
  kind of reason soon, he would go up to London and beg Mr. Spryce himself to
  get the lawyer to tell Sir Theo of his sister's marriage.</p>

  <p>He tried to persuade Laura and Mrs. Sylk also to come up to town again, to
  pay a visit to some friends, anything to break the monotony of these gloomy
  days&mdash;for gloomy they seemed to him, though the sun shone brightly and
  sparkled in the river, clouds curdled in the sky and flowers bloomed.</p>

  <p>But Laura said she had changed her opinion about the country and about
  Leppard Hall and that she was very happy there and she did not wish to go to
  London again. Nor was she to be tempted by any suggestions that she should
  buy clothes or finery for her trousseau. She seemed indifferent to everything
  but her small daily duties, as she termed her distilling, her music-playing
  and her embroidery, and her small daily pleasures, as she termed her walks
  and her rides and her saunterings in the garden.</p>

  <p>Together with her brother, Mr. Mostyn, Mrs. Sylk and other members of the
  large household at Leppard Hall, she attended the funeral of Madam Mist, and
  as she walked away with Hetty Sylk across the fields, that lady could not
  forbear from asking why she smiled so beneath her mourning-veil.</p>

  <p>"I know she was no friend of yours, Laura, but it is most unbecoming to
  seem to rejoice at a death. The funeral seemed to me so melancholic, I don't
  know why," the poor woman hurried on, "but it was as if a pall had fallen
  over the whole church. I suppose it's thunder coming up over there, from the
  left. But, Laura, tell me why you smiled."</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't I smile?" said Laura, pulling her veil close under her
  chin. "It is beginning to rain, large drops are falling, and I hear the
  thunder rumbling, as you said, towards the left. The parsonage is very close
  to the churchyard, is it not? I wonder if Madam Mist died because a ghost
  came out of its grave at night and climbed in at her window and strangled
  her?"</p>

  <p>"Laura! What a dreadful thought! And why should anyone want to strangle
  poor Madam Mist?"</p>

  <p>"She might have known something. It might have been the best way of making
  her keep a secret." Laura laughed in a low tone and slipped her arm through
  the crook of Mrs. Sylk's elbow. "Let us hasten, or we shall be drenched.
  Besides, I want to finish my essence of roses to-night before the light goes.
  I am so skilful now, you know."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were still trying to make up laurel essence?" asked Mrs.
  Sylk, glad to change the subject, but shuddering instinctively as she glanced
  at the black clouds piling up behind the wood. The green of the trees looked
  livid against this stormy background.</p>

  <p>"The laurel essence?" said Laura. She threw back her veil and looked
  fixedly at Mrs. Sylk. "Oh, I've never 'done anything with that. That was
  Harry Mostyn's idea from the first. He comes up and works at that; he has his
  own still and retort and everything else. You see, there's very little for
  him to do down here, I suppose, and he's become quite interested. I'm making
  nothing but rose essence."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Mrs. Sylk vaguely. She thought that distilling it was a
  strange pastime for a hearty, florid, accomplished gentleman like Mr. Harry
  Mostyn to go in for, but no doubt he wanted as much time alone as possible
  with this strange girl who was his secret wife, for Mrs. Sylk did not think
  he had advanced very far in his intimacy with Laura Sarelle. She was rather
  sorry for him in a way, he had always seemed very agreeable to her. She
  wished the false situation would end, the nervous tension was becoming
  unbearable...A pall over the church, a storm over Leppard Hall&mdash;that was
  it, better thunder and lightning, however alarming, than this air of horrible
  expectancy.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The storm broke with great violence the night of Madam Mist's funeral, but
  passed away in the direction of Warwick after an hour or so, leaving the sky
  bright and clear and the atmosphere cool.</p>

  <p>Sir Theodosius had felt himself very unwell; thunderstorms always affected
  him badly. He had been unable to work in his library or to see the accountant
  who had ridden over from the county town that morning. It had been an effort
  for him to attend the funeral, which seemed to depress him unduly.</p>

  <p>He did not appear at the dinner-table that evening, but kept his chamber,
  and Mr. Mostyn suggested that it might be as well to send one of the servants
  over to Warwick for Dr. Selby. But Laura said no. She did not think Theo was
  worse than he often was, and that he hated having "a fuss" made over him.
  After dinner she asked Mr. Mostyn to go up to her laboratory, as she called
  it. They were closeted in there for half an hour or so, Mrs. Sylk moving
  about in the outer room, for Laura had said she wanted it refurnished, she
  had thought of making it her bedchamber, therefore Hetty Sylk, somewhat
  against her will, for she found the task rather distasteful, was taking
  measurements of curtains and bedposts, for fenders and for carpets.</p>

  <p>She heard a low, droning conversation, both man and woman sounding dull
  and bored, coming from behind the door of the laboratory. Laura had shut the
  door because she said their work was causing fumes which might inconvenience
  Mrs. Sylk, and when she did at length come out&mdash;she had not been there
  more than half an hour or so&mdash;Hetty Sylk had to admit that some very
  acrid odour followed her into the fusty atmosphere of the disused
  bedroom.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn remained behind in the laboratory and Hetty Sylk had a glimpse
  of him through the half-open door, standing in the circle of lamplight,
  pouring some essence out of a small greenish jar into a phial of pale
  glass.</p>

  <p>"He is more interested in it now than I am," whispered Laura. "I am
  getting tired of the whole business, but he insists that I come up there with
  him. He wanted to insist on another thing, too," said Laura, with an
  apprehensive glance over her shoulder and lowering her voice still
  more&mdash;"that Dr. Selby should be sent for. Do you think Theo is so ill
  tonight?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't think him at all well, but I know he's annoyed if you have the
  doctor sent for. It would be best to wait until he tells you to do so
  himself, Laura. Well, I've taken all the measurements for this room and you
  can send the orders to the upholsterers and you can choose from your
  pattern-book as soon as you wish. Though I must say, I think it a dreary
  place for anyone to sleep in."</p>

  <p>A darkening fell over Laura's lovely face, as if all her features were
  tightened and wizened, but all she said was:</p>

  <p>"Yes, perhaps it is dreary. I dare say I shall not come here after all.
  I'm certainly tired of this distilling and my little laboratory."</p>

  <p>"Well, you are a strange girl. I wish you didn't have so many whims,"
  sighed Mrs. Sylk.</p>

  <p>"Let us come upstairs and leave Harry to his work." Laura clutched Mrs.
  Sylk's arm and led her from the chamber.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The household at Leppard Hall retired to bed early that night. The ladies
  had made an effort at playing cribbage, then Laura had performed on the harp
  for a short time, but it seemed as if the heaviness induced by the
  thunderstorm and the illness of Theodosius weighed upon them all, and even
  Harry Mostyn was glad to retire to his apartment at an hour at which, in
  London, he was used to beginning his evening's entertainment.</p>

  <p>Yet he could not sleep, or even rest. He dismissed Flasket, who slept in
  the adjoining closet, and walked up and down his handsome room by the light
  of the candles on the dressing-table, turning over in his mind the peculiar
  and, as he thought, harassing situation, trying to come to some resolve as to
  the future. It was quite impossible to go on living in this fashion, at the
  mercy of a girl's caprices.</p>

  <p>His senses, as is common with one who is both tired and thoughtful, were
  very alert, and as he walked to and fro he noted that there was an additional
  book among the few volumes on his bedside table. He seldom read, save works
  on sports and games, but a few of these, and a prayer-book, were always
  piously arranged on the cabinet beside the bed. To-night there was another
  among them.</p>

  <p>Who had been concerning himself about his reading? Was it a volume of
  love-stories from the fair Laura? he thought ironically.</p>

  <p>In another mood and at another hour he would have taken no notice of this,
  but the night was heavy about him, his mind was restless and his spirit
  unquiet, so he picked the book up and found it an old shabby tome of no
  particular interest. Local history, he supposed. Flasket, perhaps, had
  borrowed it from one of the servants, had been reading it and left it there.
  An impertinence, the fellow must be told about it; at the same time he
  observed that Laura's one gift to him, the Venetian glass flecked with gold
  that she had brought up from the china-closet herself, was missing.</p>

  <p>Who could have come into his room? So far as he knew, Sir Theo had never
  entered his guest's apartments since he had come to Leppard Hall; a careless
  maid, an impudence on the part of Flasket?&mdash;yet both seemed
  unlikely.</p>

  <p>He put the book back without opening it and, going to the closet, called
  his servant; the man woke at once and opened his door with a taper in his
  hand; at the same moment there was a quick rap at the outer door. Mr. Mostyn,
  always on the alert for anything alarming or suspicious in this house, went
  at once to the door and opened it quickly.</p>

  <p>Laura Sarelle crouched without in a long dark chamber-robe and a white cap
  tied under her chin. She held her candle, in an elaborate heavy silver stick
  with a small shade that turned it into a kind of lamp, with one hand, and in
  the other the tall gold-flecked glass that Mr. Mostyn had just missed.</p>

  <p>She had put the candle on the floor while she knocked and was just
  stooping to pick it up when Mr. Mostyn opened the door, so that her attitude
  was odd and huddled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, pray come at once, Harry! Theo is very ill! Will you send someone for
  a doctor? I've been down to the housekeeper's room for this
  sleeping-draught."</p>

  <p>"Why, is there no one else to do such work? How can I help you, Laura?
  Come, don't be so alarmed. I expect it is just one of his usual attacks."</p>

  <p>Yet he felt, as he spoke, a strange and horrible sensation pass over him
  as if he had been struck by some diabolical power, and unbidden came the
  words into his mind: 'How soon shall I be master here? How soon?'</p>

  <p>"This is his sleeping-draught. Pray take it, my hand is shaking so much I
  shall spill some. I said that before, didn't I, the sleeping-draught that I
  got from the housekeeper's room."</p>

  <p>"Well, Mrs. Marston might have come up and given it. And where's his
  bodyservant? That fellow Tomkins?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know. But Theo doesn't like anyone but me to come near him.
  Or Mrs. Sylk; call her. But first let us go and give him this draught."</p>

  <p>"But whom have you sent for the doctor if you haven't roused anyone?"
  asked Mr. Mostyn. "Shall I dress? Or will you excuse this disorder?"</p>

  <p>"Did I say I'd sent anyone for the doctor? I don't know." Laura put her
  now free hand to her brow and pushed back the dark curls that hung disordered
  inside the muslin cap. "I asked you to do it, Harry. Don't stay to put on
  your clothes&mdash;. pray send for Dr. Selby."</p>

  <p>"Why, certainly I'll do it." He stepped back into the room and pulled the
  embroidered bell-rope, calling at the same time for Flasket, who had remained
  at the door of the inner closet.</p>

  <p>The man obeyed at once. His master told him to put on his clothes, go down
  to the stables and see if there was a groom who could ride at once into
  Warwick for Dr. Selby.</p>

  <p>"Sir Theodosius has been taken very ill," he said. "Now, Laura, what do
  you want me to do? Why have you my glass?"</p>

  <p>"Come with me into Theo's room, I have to give him this draught. Your
  glass? Why, I don't know. I suppose one of the maids took it downstairs by
  mistake. Pray take it from me, so that I can have a hand free."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn's apartments were exactly opposite those of Theodosius, only
  the wide landing lit by a tall window divided them; the stairs, up and down,
  were lit only by the hooded light. He took from her the lovely glass that had
  been her odd gift to him.</p>

  <p>"You weren't abed," whispered Laura slyly, as she opened her brother's
  door with a firm, cautious hand.</p>

  <p>"No, I was restless. The storm, I think, and anxiety for our future,
  Laura."</p>

  <p>He lowered his voice as she turned the handle; she beckoned and he
  followed across the threshold.</p>

  <p>To Mr. Mostyn's surprise the large chamber that matched his own was in
  darkness save for a broad beam of moonlight that fell from the unshuttered
  window. As Theo had difficulty with his breathing and liked light and air
  even at night, the top part of the window was open and the cool breeze that
  had risen after the storm flowed into the handsome room.</p>

  <p>"Why did you leave him like this, without a light? He doesn't seem as if
  he's been disturbed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn hastened to the bedside, and dragged further apart the silk
  curtains of the tester.</p>

  <p>Sir Theo was lying in what seemed an uneasy sleep, his dark hair escaping
  from his nightcap, his forehead damp with sweat, his lips looked dry and
  parched, his chest was heaving unnaturally; but he did not seem to Mr. Mostyn
  to be a very sick man, only one in a fevered sleep; he was propped up on a
  pile of cushions.</p>

  <p>The man who gazed down at the sleeper was puzzled by the sequence of
  events that Laura had related.</p>

  <p>"Did he call you, Laura? But he's asleep, as if we had but just now half
  roused him."</p>

  <p>"Oh no," said the girl, setting her candle on the bright table, "he pulled
  his bell. There's one that rings in my room, you know. And I came down at
  once. And he told me that he was in great pain and that he must have the
  doctor and his sleeping-draught. Be careful&mdash;you will spill
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wonder he doesn't keep it near him, by his bedside, so he could take it
  himself," whispered Mr. Mostyn, who still held the gold-flecked glass in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"He does sometimes, but he thought he was making too much of a habit of
  it, and so gave it up."</p>

  <p>She bent suddenly over her brother and shook him by the thin shoulder.</p>

  <p>"He has fallen asleep. I hope he is not in a fit, or dead&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course not, dear child. Why, he looks to me to be slumbering quite
  naturally, not in the least to be in need of a sleeping-draught. Better not
  give it to him."</p>

  <p>Laura said vehemently:</p>

  <p>"No! No! He must have it! Don't you understand? It is all arranged! This
  is the time! The very night, the very hour!"</p>

  <p>"Laura, you do speak wildly! I don't understand what you mean. We're not
  acting a play scene." Mr. Mostyn spoke with sharp impatience.</p>

  <p>The young baronet had now waked and sat up in bed, leaning against his
  high-piled pillows, staring at them with eyes that appeared unseeing.</p>

  <p>"Theo," said Laura in a coaxing voice, "Harry's brought you the
  sleeping-draught you were asking for."</p>

  <p>"Was I?" he muttered. "A sleeping-draught! Am I to have one to-night?
  Well, give it me, then."</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn waited a second until the half-wakened man had a little more
  command of his senses and then asked:</p>

  <p>"But you fell asleep naturally since Laura left you. Perhaps you don't
  require it."</p>

  <p>"Since Laura left me!" repeated the young man stupidly. "What are you
  doing here? What's happened?"</p>

  <p>"Give him the draught," whispered Laura. "He'll be in one of his fits. You
  don't know what it's like, and they exhaust him so. He might spit blood as he
  did the other time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Thus urged, Harry Mostyn offered the gold-flecked glass to Sir Theo, who,
  like one used to receiving medicine, took it in his thin hands and drank down
  the contents immediately.</p>

  <p>Laura at once ran out to the landing and called up the stairs:</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Sylk! Mrs. Sylk! Mrs. Sylk! Pray come down at once, my brother is
  taken very ill!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn followed her and caught her by the arm.</p>

  <p>"There is no cause for such alarm, Laura; you may, indeed, go quietly back
  to your bed. The draught will surely keep Theo sleeping till the
  morning."</p>

  <p>"Till the morning!" whispered Laura, with a wild glance. "Till the
  morning! Don't you see that he is mortally ill?"</p>

  <p>Flasket now came out on to the landing. He had dressed himself hurriedly
  and looked sharply from his master to the young lady; he carried a small
  lamp.</p>

  <p>"You'd better go for the doctor at once, Flasket," said Laura; she began
  to laugh, clinging to Harry Mostyn's arm.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk appeared through the shadows at the turn of the stairs in a
  hastily-caught-up bedgown.</p>

  <p>"Theo is ill! Desperately ill! I don't think he's going to live!" cried
  Laura. "Flasket! Make haste, can't you? Rouse the servants, bring up
  everybody! I doubt if there'll be time to fetch the doctor! Ask Mrs. Marston
  to come, she knows something of medicine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What's all this alarm?" asked Mr. Mostyn, bewildered. To Mrs. Sylk he
  said: "Madam, pray don't disturb yourself. I have just given Theo a
  sleeping-draught, he will do very well." Then, turning to Flasket: "Get Dr.
  Selby, as I ordered you. I'll take you upstairs, Laura, you look as if you
  were going to fall. Someone must go into Sir Theo's room. We left the
  candle."</p>

  <p>"Why, what makes you so alarmed, Laura dear!" cried Mrs. Sylk, seizing the
  girl's arm as she swayed towards her.</p>

  <p>"But you should have seen his face, the way he looked when he took the
  drink that Harry gave him, the way he fell back upon the bed!"</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn stared at her in amazement, not understanding what she
  said...Surely the girl was half out of her wits, babbling at random. Her
  whole tale had been strange, he could have sworn that that was the first
  time, when they entered the room together, that Sir Theo had been disturbed
  that night...Nor had he noticed anything curious, though certainly the
  candlelight had been uncertain and fluctuating, about the manner in which
  Theo had taken the draught. He had turned back on his pillows quite naturally
  and laid himself down with a sigh, after replacing the glass by the
  candle.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Marston should be fetched&mdash;everyone!" cried Laura. "Oh, and the
  doctor is so far away!" She twisted her fingers together and hung back as if
  she did not wish to pass over the threshold of her brother's chamber.</p>

  <p>"This is extraordinary behaviour," said Mr. Mostyn. He glanced at Mrs.
  Sylk. "I really think Laura is distracted tonight. Perhaps the thunder
  affected her nerves, too."</p>

  <p>The three of them, Mr. Mostyn now carrying the lamp he had taken from his
  servant, entered the young baronet's bedroom. For a moment or two they saw
  nothing but shadows just broken by the light of the flame of the candle Laura
  had left by the bed, which had bent sideways and made a channel down the wax
  in the gust that blew from the open window; the hooded shade was towards the
  bed, so that the sleeper was in darkness.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Sylk shivered. To her the scene had all the qualities of a
  phantasmagoria; she had been roused suddenly from a sleep of fatigue, and to
  her distorted vision Laura's peaked and lovely features with the long
  disordered black curls falling over the dark pink gown, Mr. Mostyn's face,
  thus seen suddenly at night, looking heavy, fleshy, and middle-aged,
  Flasket's countenance sharp and inquisitive, and all the shadows that had run
  up the walls of the stairway and down the well of it, and this bedroom with
  the dark bed rising in the middle in a pool of shade&mdash;all confused the
  woman until she felt as if another step would cast her into a pit where she
  would fall headlong.</p>

  <p>Then she heard Mr. Mostyn and Laura speaking together in tones of alarm
  and horror. She tried to put her evil fancies from her and came round the
  great bed, holding on to the post and then to the curtain. She looked up at
  Harry Mostyn's face and saw it tense in an expression of anguished terror.
  Mrs. Sylk glanced at Laura, who was shrieking and pulling at the bell-rope
  that hung by the bedside. Then she looked down at the bed. The baronet was
  stretched on his back, his lips drawn back from his teeth, a froth showing at
  the corners of his mouth, and his tongue curled out and upwards towards his
  nostrils, while his eyes were turned in his head. Mrs. Sylk covered her sight
  from this spectacle, while in answer to the frantic ringing of the bell Mrs.
  Marston, the menservants, the maids, came hurrying, stumbling up the stairs
  with snatched-up candles, tapers, and lanterns.</p>

  <p>"He died in a fit," said Mr. Mostyn stupidly. "Is it possible in so short
  a time?"</p>

  <p>"A fit!" said Laura. "Indeed, it was not possible! He was in good health
  until you gave him that draught, Harry." She pointed to the Venetian glass
  that stood by the bedside.</p>

  <p>"There's some of the stuff in it still&mdash;let someone take it and keep
  it."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" cried Mr. Mostyn, staring at her with a glance of
  complete bewilderment. "I think the girl is raving. Mrs. Sylk, take her
  away."</p>

  <p>"The glass," insisted Laura, with her hand over it, "someone should take
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You mean," said Mrs. Marston, coming through the crowd, and more
  self-possessed than any of them, "that there may have been a mistake,
  madam?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Laura, "there might have been a mistake. Look at my
  brother&mdash;dead."</p>

  <p>They stared, holding the curtain back with a horrid curiosity, gazing. Mr.
  Mostyn made an effort at control, to take command of the situation. He felt
  the young man's pulse and brow, and he asked for a mirror to put before his
  lips, a feather. He knew, while he spoke, that all this was useless.
  Theodosius Sarelle was dead.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" asked Mrs. Sylk. She began to babble in a stupid way, but
  Mrs. Marston put her aside and, taking the young lady kindly by the arm,
  said, as if she had been her mother:</p>

  <p>"Tell us, my dear. This is a horrible thing and a terrible fright for you.
  How was it that Sir Theo came to die like this? Or you, sir?" She turned
  respectfully to Mr. Mostyn. "Perhaps you can tell us. But no one knows what
  to say or do, someone's got to take the lead." And she took the glass and
  handed it to Paul Tomkins.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn, for once in his life, was at a complete loss to find words. He
  was as bewildered as if the house had been turned upside down round him. But
  Laura spoke, and readily.</p>

  <p>"I could not sleep to-night. You see, Mr. Mostyn and my brother had a
  quarrel in the library when we came back from our walk. I can't tell you what
  it was about, but it frightened me and I couldn't sleep for thinking of it.
  Then I heard them talking here and I thought they were going to quarrel
  again. So I came downstairs and listened, and their voices were angry. Then
  they hushed a little and I knocked on the door, thinking I might stay them
  from coming perhaps to some mischief.</p>

  <p>"Having got no answer, I opened it, and Mr. Mostyn was giving my brother a
  drink out of that Venetian glass. He said to me over his shoulder, 'It is a
  sleeping-draught.' And as I came up I saw Theo fall back and Mr. Mostyn took
  the glass and was going to throw it into the fireplace. He said the stuff
  smelt strong. But I took it from him quickly and set it down on the side
  table. And that's all I know."</p>

  <p>"She's raving," said Mr. Mostyn firmly, but with a ghastly pallor and a
  heavy sweat wetting his forehead, for now he began to perceive something of
  the trap that had been set for him. "It was not so at all. She knocked on my
  door with the glass in her hand and bade me give it to her brother. She said
  she had fetched it from the housekeeper's room."</p>

  <p>"That she did not, sir," declared Mrs. Marston. "No one has been into my
  room. There are no glasses of that kind down there."</p>

  <p>"Where in the house are there such glasses?" demanded Laura. "I gave
  that&mdash;we have one only&mdash;to Mr. Mostyn. Have we any others, Mrs.
  Marston?"</p>

  <p>The housekeeper shook her head.</p>

  <p>"There are none downstairs. There are four something like them, of a fine
  Venetian glass. But there is only one with gold flecks, it has lately been
  kept in Mr. Mostyn's room."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mr. Mostyn, striving for coolness, "I've had it as a gift. I
  don't know whether that is the same or not, I never thought. Perhaps there
  are several in the house. I missed mine to-night. But what are we talking
  about? It is as if I were defending myself. I can tell you all," he raised
  his voice and looked round the household, "I gave Sir Theodosius nothing but
  the draught that his sister put into my hand. I believed it was his
  sleeping-potion. What else could I think? I suppose," he added, gathering
  some strength from the sound of his own voice, which he contrived to keep
  tranquil, "that the unfortunate young man was far more sick than he knew and
  has died in a fit. The doctor will soon tell us. I sent my man Flasket for
  him."</p>

  <p>"Why did you do that?" asked Laura. "If you thought there was nothing much
  amiss with my brother, why send for the doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Because you asked me to. I tell you"&mdash;he turned to Hetty Sylk, "the
  girl's out of her mind, out of her senses, and has been this many a week..."
  He checked himself.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose I am out of my senses," retorted Laura wildly. "I ought to
  have stopped you when you were quarrelling with Theo in the library to-night.
  He was well enough then."</p>

  <p>"No ill words passed between me and Sir Theodosius tonight or any other
  night. I have never spoken to him harshly since I have been here, you know
  that, Laura."</p>

  <p>"I know you were quarrelling," she insisted bitterly.</p>

  <p>"What should they be quarrelling about?" said Mrs. Sylk incredulously.
  "The gentlemen have always been on the best of terms. I think, Laura, you
  hardly know what you are saying. You'd best come out of the room. We can't do
  anything here till the doctor's been."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Marston drew the curtains round the bed where the distorted body lay,
  and with her quiet air of authority motioned to the other servants to leave
  the room.</p>

  <p>Tomkins kept firmly in his possession the gold-flecked glass, at the
  bottom of which was a small quantity of liquid.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" said Laura, seeing that the servants, though with backward,
  curious and dreadful glances, were creeping from the chamber. "Stop!"</p>

  <p>They paused, already engulfed in the shadows by the door, for the one
  candle with the glass hood had remained guttering on the table by the bed,
  and Flasket had gone with the lamp.</p>

  <p>"You may as well know&mdash;the secret cannot be kept any longer. My
  brother and this gentleman were quarrelling because he is my husband. He
  persuaded me to marry him clandestinely in London when we were last there. He
  overawed me, he frightened me. I'm his wife. He's your master now, I suppose,
  and mine."</p>

  <p>A broken murmur like so many hisses rose from the servants, who stood
  dumbfounded, still respectful.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn leant against the heavy bedpost gazing at the curtains that hid
  the body of Theodosius Sarelle.</p>

  <p>"You damned vixen!" he sobbed under his breath. "What are you trying to do
  with me? What are you trying to do?" Then, rallying himself, he declared,
  turning on them all: "Well, if I'm master here I'd better play the part. I'll
  wait for Dr. Selby, I'll see that the mystery is cleared up. It is true that
  I was privately married to Laura Sarelle. But that's my business and hers,
  and not to be questioned by servants and dependants. Go, each of you, now, to
  your places, but stay up lest you be required before the morning."</p>

  <p>"Won't you go to your own room, sir, and leave one of us on watch?" said
  Mrs. Marston.</p>

  <p>He looked at the Venetian glass Tomkins still held. "I'll stay here. I'm
  not frightened of hobgoblins." He turned to Tomkins. "Why are you keeping
  that glass so carefully; as if you think it might contain poison?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir. Miss Laura seemed to make a point of it. I beg your
  pardon&mdash;Mrs. Mostyn, I should say. It's confusing news, sir, heard at
  such a moment. You'll pardon us."</p>

  <p>They crept away, severally.</p>

  <p>Again the words passed through Harry Mostyn's mind: 'When shall I be
  master here? When?'</p>

  <p>The moment had surely come...Laura was his wife, he had not only the
  dowry, but all the estates to which she was indubitably entitled now. But the
  knowledge brought him no pleasure, merely a shudder of terror and foreboding
  that he could scarcely control.</p>

  <p>They had left him sitting by the curtained bed with the one guttering
  candle. He remained so a while turning over in his numbed mind the behaviour
  of Laura Sarelle. Then he rose and tried the door. He had a suspicion that
  they might have locked him in. But no, he was quite free.</p>

  <p>He looked across the landing towards his own room. That door was half open
  and there was a light within. Two people were moving about, he heard voices,
  two of the menservants. Were they searching his possessions at Laura's
  command? The girl was obviously out of her mind.</p>

  <p>What was she trying to do? There was some motive, but he could not fathom
  it. He returned to his vigil, hoping that she at least would not disturb him
  again. He felt physically sick as he stared with an air of nauseated loathing
  at the dark crimson damask curtains. He had never in his easy life been so
  shaken as he had been by the sudden death of this young man. Could a fit or a
  chill kill so suddenly? What, after all, had been in the Venetian glass that
  Laura had put into his hand?</p>

  <p>He tried to keep his mind from such thoughts; native common sense and
  courage kept him resolute against the intangible peril that he felt was
  encompassing him; he snuffed the hooded candle and returned to the chair with
  arms that he had drawn close to the great curtained bed. Laura's behaviour he
  put aside from his speculations; either he had not got the key to it or she
  was mad.</p>

  <p>In any case she was his wife; she had publicly avowed that herself, and he
  was lord of all her fortune. The voice that had seemed to breathe into his
  ear&mdash;'How soon will you be master here?'&mdash;was answered now.</p>

  <p>There would no longer be, for Harry Mostyn, any financial difficulties; to
  keep his mind from the present he tried to think of the future; there would
  be a few unpleasant days to pass through&mdash;then, by God, he would leave
  Leppard Hall for ever, and Laura would be taken away&mdash;or shut away.</p>

  <p>This was a long night for Harry Mostyn; occasionally he shivered in his
  silk bedgown, and his feet were chilled in his slippers, but some fascination
  held him in that room; he would not return to his own chamber to procure his
  clothes...How long it seemed to take Flasket to get the doctor from
  Warwick!...The man must have gone himself, or surely he would have come to
  see if his master required any service...it was natural for the others to
  keep away...</p>

  <p>He rose once to extinguish the candle, flaring to a finish, after lighting
  another that he found on the mantelshelf from that flaring flame. The
  moonlight had long since left the room and the darkness seemed to form a pit
  round Harry Mostyn's chair.</p>

  <p>He wished that he could get Laura out of his mind&mdash;Laura as he had
  found her crouching at his door, picking up her light, carefully holding the
  yellow glass steadily with her other, raised, rigid hand, her hair draggled,
  her shoulders drawn up; he found now that he could hardly recall what she had
  said, her rapid, almost incoherent denunciations&mdash;of what?</p>

  <p>And the trick with the Venetian glass, if trick it was? A drugged
  drowsiness invaded the anxious sentences of Harry Mostyn; yes, that was it,
  he felt drugged, by this fearful house, this dreadful event. He gave a long,
  reluctant look at the heavy bed-curtains and half put out his hand to draw
  them, but restrained himself in time&mdash;yes, in time, for he believed that
  if he were to come face to face with the dead man he would lose his control.
  He looked round the room to steady himself; books were everywhere, even in
  this bedchamber, on shelves, tables, and piled in the window-place&mdash;what
  had Theodosius Sarelle ever got out of his reading? Perhaps from this antique
  and musty folio had come all the gloomy miasma that had made the house so
  intolerable.</p>

  <p>The first grey glow of dawn, without light or colour, and a chill wind
  invaded the chamber from the open window; the second candle blew out. Harry
  Mostyn could endure no more; he rose stiffly, crossed the room, opened the
  door and gazed down the dark pit of the silent staircase.</p>

  <p>Then he glanced up, and listened keenly, for he thought that he heard a
  low moan of laughter coming from the floor above where Laura would be with
  Mrs. Sylk, as he supposed, though the sound seemed rather to come from the
  great bedchamber opposite&mdash;the empty room with the closet that Laura
  used as her distillery; but he assured himself that it was no human utterance
  he had heard, but some rustle of drapery, caught in an open window by the
  breeze that ran before the dawn&mdash;or any of those soft noises that come
  in an old house in the silence of the night, and that need not be peered and
  pried into...</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn felt shrivelled, as if he had been touched by a flame; he
  could not return to the dead man's room, yet he still had the resolution to
  keep his vigil and remained at the door until he heard steps and voices
  below, and at last Dr. Selby, muffled from the night air, with tired eyes,
  came up the stairway, followed by Flasket and Tomkins, who must have been
  keeping vigil below; and another had been watching also, for, gliding softly
  on sandalled feet, Laura came down the stairs, still in her bedgown.</p>

  <p>'The house was full of waiting people,' thought Harry Mostyn, 'and I felt
  so alone&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He tried to speak in a normal way to the doctor, but his explanations came
  first whispered, then too loud; he tried to put Laura back, but she slipped
  past him, into the death-chamber, and he had to follow, endeavouring to speak
  in a cool, rational way before the physician, the two servants, this crazed
  girl, through whom, he must remind himself, he held a fortune.</p>

  <p>Mingled voices disturbed the quiet of the great room, now lit by the
  dreary light of dawn. Dr. Selby tried to hush them; all the details of the
  scene were impressed on Harry Mostyn's mind, as if he had seen them in a
  flash of lightning; then there was Mrs. Marston, with the gold-flecked glass
  in her hand; so they all had been waiting...for what?</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn contrived to say:</p>

  <p>"What has brought all these people here, Dr. Selby&mdash;sheer curiosity?
  This is exceedingly painful for me&mdash;I might beg some privacy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The physician, his hand on the bed-curtains, glanced at him gravely, and
  Laura, close to Tomkins, who held the lamp, red in that grey light,
  exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"No, no, I have something to say&mdash;let everyone hear it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn turned towards the fresher air by the window; he could not
  endure to see these curtains drawn; the sound of the rings running on the
  pole seemed to sear his mind.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Dr. Selby's examination was short; he turned round and said he could not
  tell what had caused the death of Sir Theodosius; he had died suddenly, "as
  through a stroke from heaven", added the physician gravely. He closed the
  curtains, and Laura, who, gliding like a shadow, had pressed in close behind
  him, began to speak, hushing the others with raised hand and voice, and
  gazing direct at Harry Mostyn in the window-place. That weary and bewildered
  man listened fascinated as the girl repeated, with great art and exactitude,
  the tale he had already heard her relate earlier in the evening; it was
  useless for him to contradict her here and make a railing scene, he thought.
  'Selby will understand me when I tell him quietly what really occurred. I
  suppose she will have to be put away. Well, I shall be able to afford a mad
  wife now.'</p>

  <p>Dr. Selby stood gravely silent while Laura spoke quietly and with a heavy
  reluctance, glancing continually at the man who she admitted was her husband,
  now and then clutching at Mrs. Sylk's arm.</p>

  <p>"I'll see what was in the glass&mdash;with the sleeping-draught," said the
  doctor at length.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Marston, who had it in readiness, brought it on a sign from Laura and
  gave it to the physician.</p>

  <p>'She can do this with her brother lying there,' thought Harry Mostyn. 'She
  no more considers him than if he had been dead for a hundred years.'</p>

  <p>He stared at the girl; she had told her story like someone who had learned
  a lesson...He was so absorbed, almost spellbound, by her behaviour that he
  hardly thought any longer of himself or of his own possible peril. He saw the
  doctor cautiously smell the small amount of liquid that remained at the
  bottom of the glass, dip his finger in it, raise the wet finger and smell
  that.</p>

  <p>"This is laurel-water," he said. "We use it as a horse-drench. It is very
  much valued in diluted quantities. This is an essence of it, it kills
  instantly. If your brother drank this, Miss Laura, there's no need to look
  further for the cause of his death."</p>

  <p>Then, as if apparently realizing what he said, he turned round and
  exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"The second time? Is it possible?"</p>

  <p>"There's been some mistake," stammered Laura heavily. "Don't listen to
  what I said just now, there's been some mistake. I don't know anything. This
  man is my husband indeed, I mustn't say anything more."</p>

  <p>"Quiet, my dear young lady. Quiet, you poor, distracted creature,"
  commanded Dr. Selby. "Mr. Mostyn, sir, can you give any explanation of any of
  this?"</p>

  <p>"I?" said the unfortunate man, in a confused way. "Yes, I've an
  explanation. But I can't give it here before these women&mdash;the servants."
  He looked at Laura, Mrs. Marston and Mrs. Sylk, all staring at him, the two
  men behind. "I don't know that I ought to, either." He was thinking of the
  danger in which Laura might stand. Was she a criminal or a lunatic? One or
  the other, that was certain. He did not wish to make any accusation against
  her that it might be impossible afterwards to retract. "What did you mean,
  sir," he asked, with a desperate attempt to gain a diversion, "by saying 'the
  second time'?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Dr. Selby, having now regained his composure, "the affair
  has been hushed up for a good number of years, though I always thought that
  rather foolish. But I suppose you all know that another Sir Theodosius
  Sarelle died from a drink of laurel poison?"</p>

  <p>"It's the first I've heard of it," declared Mr. Mostyn, his trembling hand
  to his damp forehead.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Harry!" cried Laura, throwing herself into Mrs. Sylk's arms. "Oh,
  would that were true!"</p>

  <p>"Of course it's true, Laura. What do you think I know of your family
  history? Certainly when I first came down here I tried to find out something,
  but everyone was silent. But what did I care, after all?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you didn't," she flashed viciously from the other woman's
  shoulder, "you were thinking of the money."</p>

  <p>"Whatever I was thinking of, it was not of some old tragedy of a hundred
  years ago or whatever it is. I never knew there had been a murder in this
  family. I suppose that's what's the matter with this house. I might have
  guessed. Did Theodosius know?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he knew," said Dr. Selby grimly. "He and Spryce, the lawyer, and
  myself, and Tampion, the miller&mdash;oh, quite a number of us. But of course
  it was hushed up. His father and his grandfather, they wanted to live it
  down, you know. Stoic philosophy, and all the rest of it. And this is what it
  ends in. Somebody's acted the ugly old drama over again. I wonder who?"</p>

  <p>"I never knew of it," sobbed Laura, "I never knew! How could I?"</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose you did, Miss Laura; I don't suppose you did," soothed
  Dr. Selby. "I know that your brother was most anxious to keep it from you. At
  times even he, poor fellow, with all his rationalism and hard-headedness, was
  affected by it&mdash;even he sometimes thought it wasn't wise to give you
  that name."</p>

  <p>"I never knew," repeated Laura, sinking her head on Mrs. Sylk's shoulder.
  "Why didn't someone tell me? I never knew!"</p>

  <p>"I did not know either," said Mr. Mostyn. "It seems like some diabolical
  contrivance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here Mrs. Marston raised her eyebrows, pursed her lips, and turned to the
  doctor.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I don't know about Mr. Mostyn&mdash;begging your
  pardon&mdash;not knowing, but Miss Laura thought we should search his room.
  Tomkins, that's Sir Theo's bodyservant, went in and looked. And there were
  some bottles of essence in the pocket of his coat. He'd been distilling
  laurel leaves, you know."</p>

  <p>"Distilling laurel leaves!" interrupted Dr. Selby.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was you," stammered Laura, raising her head. "No, I mustn't say
  it." She put her fingers to her lips.</p>

  <p>"You must say it, my love," cried Mrs. Sylk hastily, "of course she must
  say it. She doesn't want to defame one who's her husband&mdash;yes, he's her
  husband, Dr. Selby&mdash;it's true. And I can see, the poor child, how she's
  torn by rage over her brother's death, ay, rage and grief, and desire to
  shield this scoundrel here. And I've seen him picking the laurel leaves. And
  I know he was distilling them, though it's all been secret and hushed up. And
  now one can understand why."</p>

  <p>"Hush, hush!" said Dr. Selby imperiously. "This is a serious matter; it
  will all have to be gone through gravely. Were you distilling laurel leaves,
  Mr. Mostyn?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"There is a laurel bush that grows in front of the house; I suppose you
  know? Well, it's an ill-fated tree, I should have thought you might have
  known that. Did you know that laurel essence, laurel-water, is a deadly
  poison?"</p>

  <p>"No, I have knowledge of poisons whatever."</p>

  <p>"Why were you concerned to make this particular essence?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn was silent...How to speak without incriminating Laura? She was
  looking at him, gazing sideways as she leaned on the other woman's breast,
  while he hesitated. Mrs. Sylk spoke in a noisy defence of her charge,
  repeating again that she had seen Mr. Mostyn pick the leaves, she knew he was
  distilling the laurel, but all was to be kept secret, that poor Miss Laura
  never distilled anything but roses&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Why did Miss Laura suggest that his room should be searched?" asked the
  doctor, who had taken charge of the situation.</p>

  <p>"Ah, why?" said Mr. Mostyn. "Why did you do that, Laura?"</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me," she said obstinately.</p>

  <p>"Of course she can't say, poor child. She's had her suspicions of him,"
  said Mrs. Sylk. "And what do you think Tomkins found there besides the
  bottles of essence?&mdash;why, an old book with an account of that other
  affair in it. Mrs. Marston has it&mdash;she took it downstairs, the butler
  saw it too. The leaves are turned down at the account of the old murder of
  Sir Theodosius Sarelle in 1780. It was hidden under his other books, but
  Tomkins found it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I never saw any such book in my life," said Harry Mostyn. "Who was this
  murderer of this other Theodosius Sarelle?"</p>

  <p>"Edward Avershaw," replied the doctor quietly. "He married Laura, the
  baronet's sister. He wanted the Sarelle money."</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn tried to speak, but his utterance began to thicken. Flasket
  stepped up to him.</p>

  <p>"Give him some brandy," added Dr. Selby to the servant; "take him to his
  room."</p>

  <p>"I am quite unprepared," stammered Harry Mostyn, leaning on his man's arm;
  he glanced round the group of people, all of them seemed to be looking at him
  with eyes of pricked steel; Laura, staring from the shoulder of Mrs. Sylk,
  who was weeping foolishly, lifted her lip at him...an ugly trick...he had
  always detested it; but what she said was:</p>

  <p>"I shan't betray you, Harry, I shan't say another word."</p>

        id="ch-04"></a>

  <h2>PART FOUR</h2>

  <p class="first">"IT is some frightful error," said Dr. Selby. "Let us not
  raise an alarm until the matter is sifted to the bottom. That's why I sent
  for you, my dear sir, there is no one to undertake the responsibility of this
  dreadful house."</p>

  <p>Mr. Spryce, glanced about him at the handsome library. Strange words for a
  practical man like the physician to use, "this dreadful house".</p>

  <p>"You're quite sure, Dr. Selby, that it was not a natural death?"</p>

  <p>"My colleagues, Andrews from Rugby, and Morton from Warwick, came to open
  the body with me, you know. They say there is no doubt that he died from a
  large dose of that poison which we found in the bottom of the yellow glass,
  but it may have got there in error&mdash;nay, we feel sure that it got there
  in error."</p>

  <p>"The case against Mr. Mostyn is, to my thinking, remarkably strong," said
  the lawyer definitely.</p>

  <p>Dr. Selby looked down at the Persian carpet with an empty stare; both the
  men were sitting, perhaps unconsciously, so that they could not see the desk
  piled with books and manuscripts that Sir Theodosius had used to study so
  deeply; the blinds were drawn in all the front rooms of Leppard Hall, but the
  library was situated at the back, and the July sunshine streamed in through
  the unshuttered window, picking out the classic bust in crimson purple marble
  that stood between the bookcases.</p>

  <p>The handsome chamber had already an unlived-in air and seemed gloomy and
  dismal. A bee buzzed on the windowpane.</p>

  <p>"The case is pretty remarkable," commented the doctor, still with that
  vacant look at the carpet; "there is no one to take charge, and I have no
  right here at all, you know. I am staying in the house under the excuse of
  looking after Miss Laura&mdash;Ah, I can't help keep calling her
  that&mdash;Mrs. Mostyn, I should say."</p>

  <p>"There's no possible denial of the marriage, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"None. They both admit it. Mrs. Sylk was a witness, too."</p>

  <p>"Mostyn? And how has he been behaving himself? No attempt to escape. He's
  really the master here. It is, as you say, an extraordinary position."</p>

  <p>"No, he has not made the least attempt to escape. He said he would welcome
  a complete investigation."</p>

  <p>"But who is to investigate? I don't wish to call in the police, there's
  talk enough as it is. I've spoken to one or two of the servants, the
  housekeeper and Tomkins, who are to be trusted. Mrs. Sylk has opened her
  heart to me. Of course, she thinks&mdash;well, to put it plainly," the lawyer
  concluded the sentence, "Mrs. Sylk thinks, I suppose, that Harry Mostyn
  murdered Sir Theodosius."</p>

  <p>"She does. She thinks that he has been using Laura's absorption in her
  pastime of distillery to make an essence of laurel leaves, that he gave it to
  Sir Theodosius instead of the sleeping-draught. She swears that Laura was
  coerced into that secret marriage, that her heart was entirely given to
  Lucius Delaunay&mdash;Lord Belmont that is. Laura's confided to her that he
  frightened her&mdash;Mostyn, I mean&mdash;by threatening to have her shut up
  as a madwoman if she didn't agree."</p>

  <p>"Do you know why he wished for this secret marriage?" urged the physician,
  suddenly raising tired eyes.</p>

  <p>"I think I do, sir. He is much embarrassed in his affairs. He carried it
  off with a high hand with me, but he never made a full statement. It is quite
  likely that Sir Theodosius was holding off, perhaps cooling off even, and
  this man wanted to secure the girl and the money while he could."</p>

  <p>"She," said the doctor wearily, "practically accused him of murder before
  the whole household. And now she will not say anything, says she lost her
  head, did not know what she was saying. There's the glass, you know, the
  gold-flecked glass of Venetian ware that was in his room only&mdash;her
  present&mdash;and there is the book they found in his room which shows he did
  know about the other 'laurel-water tragedy', as they call it."</p>

  <p>"Where did he get the book?"</p>

  <p>"He says he does not know, he never had it before in his possession,
  someone must have put it in his room; but he saw it at the parsonage one day
  he went up there. He opened it, but saw nothing to arouse his curiosity, and
  shut it again because the reverend gentleman came in on him. Then he did see
  it that night, on his bed-table, but did not recognize it, though he does so
  now."</p>

  <p>"Well, of course, he pocketed it then, when at the parsonage," said Mr.
  Spryce. "But why leave it about where people could see it? Who knew the
  significance of the book? Why were they searching his room?"</p>

  <p>"Because Laura asked them to. She particularly asked Tomkins, who was her
  brother's bodyservant and a fit person to choose, to search Mr. Mostyn's
  room. She would not say why at the time, but afterwards she told Mrs. Sylk,
  who informed me, that she was afraid there was a weapon there. She said that
  he, that is Harry Mostyn, had been threatening her with a pistol. A pistol
  was found afterwards among his possessions. Tomkins found the old book.
  Tomkins does know something, but not all, of the story. He knew that when he
  first came to Leppard Hall his master, Sir Theodosius, had a copy of that
  book and locked it away. He found the keys and looked in the case over
  there"&mdash;he nodded towards the corner&mdash;"and found that that copy was
  still there."</p>

  <p>"So this is another copy, corrected, of course," said the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"He has been seen, too, picking the laurel leaves, and he has been shut up
  a good deal in the distillery. He made a great secret and mystery over it;
  why, I don't know. Laura said she was tired long since of the whole
  business."</p>

  <p>"Well, he had the motive and the opportunity. He wanted the girl's money,
  he did not want any questions asked about his own fortune, and there was this
  old story putting the scheme into his hands. But at the same time the details
  were exceedingly clumsy&mdash;using a glass that was conspicuous, leaving the
  book lying about in his room."</p>

  <p>"But you must remember that Miss Laura&mdash;I can't call her anything
  else&mdash;disturbed him. She thought she heard sounds of quarrelling, she
  was in an excited and agitated state. He would have disposed of the glass, I
  have, no doubt, have hidden or destroyed the book had he had time, but she
  was upon him, raising the household. She took the glass from him and set it
  aside. She said at the time that he had made an effort to throw it into the
  grate. She had already sent for me, fearing some violence from Mostyn."</p>

  <p>"So she made a formal accusation of murder against him," remarked the
  lawyer thoughtfully, fingering his loose chin.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, you could not call it formal&mdash;the girl was wild,
  hysterical. But now she will not say anything, she tries even to defend
  him."</p>

  <p>"Has the parson, this man Mist, been up here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he came on a formal visit of condolence. He seemed much shocked, he
  had just lost his own wife. We did not know that the book had been his then,
  so we could not question him."</p>

  <p>"I shall go and wait on him presently, find out if his copy is still in
  his possession. How is Miss Laura's health?"</p>

  <p>"She seems well enough, cool in a way, I cannot make her out. She sits in
  her room with Mrs. Sylk, who is hotly, of course, in her favour. She says
  that her charge has been imposed on, first by her brother and then by Harry
  Mostyn, that it is a wonder she has still got her wits. Laura's foremost idea
  was always to get away from the Hall."</p>

  <p>"Well, she will be able to now," said Mr. Spryce, with a dull smile, "she
  must be mistress of a very considerable fortune."</p>

  <p>"You forget, sir, that she is Harry Mostyn's wife."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I believe I had forgotten that. The man is, of course, an
  adventurer, a base scoundrel. He may be a murderer, why not? The plan doesn't
  sound clever, but then, it may have gone wrong. Laura heard them quarrelling.
  I expect Theodosius intended to withdraw his consent to the marriage, and
  then Mostyn told him that he was married already. That probably upset the
  young man, he was certainly ill that evening, everyone was witness to
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My God, Spryce! What are we going to do?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir. There seem to be no relations, none whom we can get
  hold of in a hurry. If there is an inquest there'll be a pretty ugly story
  coming out&mdash;talk and scandal that will tear the skins off both of them.
  What does Mostyn say himself?"</p>

  <p>"Why, very little now. At first he was quite vehement, but now seems to
  have withdrawn himself; to begin with, he said that such accusations were
  absurd, but he could not deny, of course, the clandestine marriage, nor, if
  put to it, that he is only a fortune-hunter. What, sir, are we going to do?"
  added the doctor, with an uncertain look.</p>

  <p>"Sir, I do not know. It's a case for a guardian or a relative. There seems
  to be none. I don't know if Mostyn intends to keep his promise and take the
  name. He seems scarcely likely to now&mdash;tell me, what is his version of
  what actually took place the night itself? What was he doing in Sir Theo's
  room with the glass and the sleeping-draught? I cannot get the matter
  clear."</p>

  <p>"Mostyn has no explanation of that now at all. He merely says that Sir
  Theo was taken suddenly ill, the whole household was roused, he doesn't quite
  know by whom, that servants had been sent for the doctor, and he and his man
  Flasket came out on to the stairhead and someone, he doesn't know who, put
  the glass into his hand. Sir Theo was calling out for help and that he gave
  him the drink. He said he had nothing to do with mixing it, and that he knows
  nothing of the essence of laurel-water that was found in his pocket, that he
  did not even know the stuff was poisonous. That he knew nothing whatever of
  the old tale. He adds that if he had, he wouldn't have been such a fool as to
  try the same thing twice."</p>

  <p>"There's sound sense in that," conceded Mr. Spryce with a grim smile. "But
  it can't all have been an accident&mdash;this distilling, the glass, the
  book, the quarrel, the secret marriage. But he may have thought that the idea
  of the same thing happening twice in one family was so preposterous that
  nobody would accuse him of it&mdash;it may have been a stroke like that. And
  if he had not been actually discovered in the sick man's room with the glass
  in his hand&mdash;why, who could have brought it home to him? You would never
  have suspected poison, would you, Dr. Selby?"</p>

  <p>"No, I certainly should not. I should have supposed that Sir Theo died in
  a fit, perhaps. He had convulsions occasionally and was in a poor state of
  health. I had not liked the look of him for some time."</p>

  <p>"Well, then," sighed Mr. Spryce, "it may have been the bold endeavour of a
  desperate man." He added, rising, "This is a sad way for Miss Laura to find
  out the history of her family. I suppose she knew nothing whatever about it
  before?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Everyone around here was silent, I'm sure of that. A great
  number of them don't know. In the house there is only Tomkins, with perhaps a
  garbled version in his mind. He knew that his master had locked the book up.
  And an old fellow, Peach, who helps in the stable. Then there's Tampion, the
  miller, who got it from his grandfather; and the Mists knew, I suppose,
  through having that book. Or at least, he did&mdash;I doubt if the old lady
  troubled her head with such affairs or was allowed to."</p>

  <p>Dr. Selby rose also and began to pace up and down the rich room that smelt
  of dust and death.</p>

  <p>"A pity," remarked the lawyer, with a sour look on his square, plain face
  as he glanced at the table at which Sir Theodosius would never sit again,
  "that the will of Laura Sarelle, the first of that name, I mean, was not
  carried out, and the Hall razed to the ground. It has been nothing but a
  curse for everyone who lived in it since."</p>

  <p>"Eh! What's that?" exclaimed the doctor, pausing. "I did not know. This
  house was to have been razed to the ground?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but the will was looked upon as the whim of a half-crazed woman and
  no one took any notice. It was a well-built house, and a great deal of it new
  then. You know," he added abruptly, "young Belmont is in the village. Let us
  talk sanely of sane things."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw Belmont this morning. He came here and wanted to see Miss
  Laura. She sent down a message by Mrs. Sylk that 'he had come too soon and
  that he was to return later'. He told me frankly that though he had no right
  here he could not stay away&mdash;he saw the account of Sir Theo's sudden
  death in the London papers. She ought to have married him," added the doctor;
  "everything has gone wrong."</p>

  <p>The heavy carved door opened and, with a slow step that he tried to make
  firm, Mr. Harry Mostyn entered, and stopped in a constrained position on the
  threshold.</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen, have you discussed the case and the situation?" he
  asked, not without dignity.</p>

  <p>The other two men glanced at him, embarrassed, hostile, and yet a little
  ashamed of their own sense of shock at his sudden appearance.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn looked ill, more than his age. But he was neatly dressed and
  held himself erect as he advanced slowly; Dr. Selby turned away, muttering
  something about an error, but the lawyer faced the issue squarely.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, Dr. Selby and I, the family lawyer and the family physician,
  you know, since no other friends or relatives are near, <i>have</i> been
  discussing, the case, sir. It's a very strange affair. Dr. Selby and his
  colleagues are under no doubt whatever that Sir Theodosius died from a potent
  concoction of laurel-water."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn moved to the window-place and stood there in the bright
  sunshine, pulled out his handkerchief, pressed it to his lips, then said with
  the air of a man carefully choosing his words and also making a great effort
  to retain complete self-control:</p>

  <p>"I knew nothing whatever of the properties of laurel-water. I've seen them
  used in the little distillery that Laura, my wife, had&mdash;I thought it was
  all a toy, a woman's pastime. I had heard that it was used for horses,
  nothing else."</p>

  <p>"It is possible," conceded Mr. Spryce, "that a townsman would have no more
  knowledge than that, but it is difficult to believe, sir, that you have lived
  here, as you have lived for several months, on and off, as lover, and, as it
  appears, as husband of the heiress of Leppard Hall, and never knew about this
  laurel-water tragedy, as they call it."</p>

  <p>"I knew nothing," replied Mr. Mostyn, still with his handkerchief pressed
  to his face and looking down at the floor. "I had some curiosity when I first
  came here and made some inquiries. I certainly heard something about an
  overdose of a sleeping-draught&mdash;some young man, a cousin, I believe,
  died here. Why should I concern myself about it? It was a long time ago, and
  I had my own matters to think of. I felt it was something best not disturbed.
  I was conscious of some&mdash;warning&mdash;a peril of the mind."</p>

  <p>"The coincidence is, to say the least of it, curious," remarked the
  lawyer. "You must admit that, sir."</p>

  <p>"I cannot prove what I say, of course," returned Mr. Mostyn harshly. "I
  cannot prove that I had never seen that book in my room before that night,
  save for a few moments in the parlour at the parsonage; I cannot prove that I
  never put those phials of essence into my pocket. You will have to take my
  word for it all, gentlemen, or blow the case open."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," remarked Mr. Spryce slowly, "we shall have to do
  that&mdash;there will have to be an inquest, and the case will have to be
  blown open."</p>

  <p>"Unless, sir," put in Dr. Selby anxiously, "you can give us a more
  coherent account of what happened on the night of Sir Theo's death, who it
  was that actually put that glass into your hand when you came out of your own
  chamber&mdash;why you were taking a sleeping-draught to the young man."</p>

  <p>"I can tell you no more than I've told you already, sir," replied Mr.
  Mostyn, still in that hoarse, strained voice. "I do not think I really have
  the courage to go over it again. There was a great deal of confusion, a
  question of a sudden illness, lights, people running to and fro, the women,
  the housekeeper, Laura's companion&mdash;I was the only man there except the
  servants, and I suppose they looked to me to take charge."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why they should look to you, sir," remarked the doctor
  sharply, "to administer a sleeping-draught. Who mixed it?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know. You must do as you please, I've no more to say."</p>

  <p>"Is your wife," asked Mr. Spryce, with a cold emphasis on the words, "in a
  fit state for me to interview her, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I could not tell you that," replied Harry Mostyn, looking at him
  straight. "I've not seen her since the day her brother died. Sir, there's a
  friend of hers staying in the village, the gentleman who used to be the
  steward here. He seems greatly attached to her and came to see her when he
  heard of her trouble. But she would not receive him."</p>

  <p>"I suppose, for the time being," admitted Mr. Spryce, still with a cold,
  almost hostile air, "I must regard you, sir, as the master of the house. Have
  I permission to go upstairs and see if Mrs. Mostyn will receive me?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, if she's in a fit state. I understood from Mrs. Sylk and her
  maid that she has been very ill."</p>

  <p>"Any young lady would be ill under such circumstances," the doctor said.
  "I consider that Mrs. Mostyn preserves her health very well. She should, of
  course, be taken away as soon as possible. But it will not be possible until
  after the funeral. Perhaps it will not be possible until after the
  inquest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn came out of the stream of sunlight full of dust-motes and said
  firmly, his face ravaged, but his glance straight:</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt that both you gentlemen consider me a scoundrel because
  I've married an heiress in a clandestine manner&mdash;probably you consider
  my affairs are more embarrassed than they really are. Appearances are
  considerably against me, I have not behaved in a way that I am proud of, but
  I'm not a murderer. I hadn't the least thought in my mind of destroying
  Theodosius. There is much I cannot explain."</p>

  <p>They stood, awkwardly silent, considering the man. Mr. Mostyn sensed their
  doubts, perhaps their incredulity, and he added on a stronger note and in
  emphatic words:</p>

  <p>"My God, gentlemen, do you think I should have been such a fool, if I'd
  wanted to murder that boy, as to copy an old crime of nearly a hundred years
  ago? Why, it is absurd, ghastly, that I should be asked to answer such
  charges!"</p>

  <p>"We've made none, sir," said Mr. Spryce, looking at him keenly. "The
  situation is baffling. For your own sake, you will not try to leave the
  Hall?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Mr. Mostyn, "I'm here to answer anything that may be said.</p>

  <p>"I'm willing to allow young Belmont here if you wish. Though I know
  something of that story."</p>

  <p>"Sir, I shall go upstairs and see if I can talk to Miss Laura. Come, Dr.
  Selby, you must be with me."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The two men went slowly up the wide, shallow stairs, neither caring to
  speak to the other lest they might be overheard. Dr. Selby knocked at the
  door of Laura's apartment and Mrs. Sylk admitted them both instantly. Laura,
  to the surprise of both the men, was sitting at the window shrouded by the
  linen blind and seemed calm, almost placid.</p>

  <p>"She's much better, dear child," whispered Mrs. Sylk, "and keeping up her
  spirits wonderfully."</p>

  <p>Laura Sarelle welcomed Mr. Spryce warmly and bade him be seated on the
  little chair opposite her. She answered Dr. Selby's inquiries after her
  health with a docile air. In her heavy bombazine mourning, her little black
  lace cap, she looked delicate as a lily of the valley; she glanced down
  herself at her heavy weeds, which were like those of a widow, and said:</p>

  <p>"This is a gown that I wore for my Aunt Tollis. I didn't think I should be
  wearing it again so soon, and for poor Theo."</p>

  <p>"You know," said Dr. Selby, taking her hand kindly, "that Lord Belmont is
  in the village? He wished to see you, and I think you were wise, Laura, to
  send him away. If I were you I should write a note telling him you have no
  need of his services, though you thank him very, very warmly for his
  offer."</p>

  <p>"You think it might compromise him?" asked Laura quickly. "You think
  people here might know that he wanted to marry me once? Yes, he had better
  go. It's too soon. I told him that. I said, 'It's too soon, but come again
  later.'"</p>

  <p>"Come again later, Laura?" said Mr. Spryce. "I beg your pardon&mdash;I
  should say Mrs. Mostyn. Come again later? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean," said Laura, "when they've taken Mr. Mostyn away and when I'm
  quite free."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, child, what are you saying? When they take him away?"
  asked the doctor.</p>

  <p>Laura glanced aside and smiled slyly, then looked up and whispered:</p>

  <p>"I ought not to speak like that. Horrible, isn't it? But of course he's my
  husband, and I won't say a word against him, not a word."</p>

  <p>"Then why do you talk like that&mdash;'take him away'? Who is to take him
  away? He is your husband and the master here," urged Dr. Selby, with his old
  face lined and anxious as he bent towards the girl, still firmly holding her
  little wrist.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I don't know what I am saying. Of course Lucius must never come
  here again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Laura," put in Mr. Spryce, "you seem quite well and strong, you have
  borne this tragedy very bravely. Your brother did not suffer, you know, it
  was a quick and easy death, and he was not so enamoured of life&mdash;perhaps
  he would have much regretted to go like that, so it all must be taken in a
  stoic way. He prided himself on being a philosopher. But there are living
  people to think of. Can you tell us something of what happened that night? It
  is really important. Now, tell us quietly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Laura looked sly and frightened.</p>

  <p>"No, I can't. I've said all I can remember."</p>

  <p>"But you said some wild and terrible things, Laura...Everyone heard them,
  all the servants&mdash;about Mr. Mostyn," urged the doctor.</p>

  <p>"I did not know what I was saying. I must not talk against him, must I?
  He's my husband. And I could not give evidence against him, could I?"</p>

  <p>"No, Laura," said Mr. Spryce. "But you could help us now in getting at the
  truth of this disaster. You do not know anything about the book that Tomkins
  found in Mr. Mostyn's room?"</p>

  <p>"The book, no!"</p>

  <p>"You do not know how it was that that yellow glass that belonged to Mr.
  Mostyn's bedroom furniture was the one used for the draught? You do not know
  anything about the essences in his pocket?"</p>

  <p>"How should I know? I tell you I came downstairs and I heard them
  quarrelling, then when I opened the door I could see him standing there with
  the gold glass I gave him in his hand. That is all I know. I won't say
  another word, my lips are locked. I sent for Dr. Selby because I was
  frightened&mdash;Theo seemed so ill&mdash;and Harry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do not press her," put in the doctor, "it may bring on a nervous
  attack."</p>

  <p>"She won't speak," said Mrs. Sylk, suddenly breaking into the
  conversation, "she's too loyal, poor child. And Mr. Mostyn has ruined
  her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush, Mrs. Sylk, we won't have any of that talk, if you please. We'll
  leave you now, my dear, you're well looked after here. Keep yourself quiet
  until after the funeral and then we will try and make arrangements for you to
  go away. Afterwards, you must try to tell us all you know."</p>

  <p>"But what's going to happen," asked Laura, rising, "to&mdash;to my
  husband? Don't the words sound strange&mdash;'my husband'?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you, dear," said Mr. Spryce kindly. "I'll send for my wife,
  if you like, to keep you company. We don't know what's going to happen in
  this house within the next few hours...Remember to write that note to Lord
  Belmont. The case is bad enough as it is, we don't want more
  complications."</p>

  <p>He obeyed a warning look from the doctor and moved towards the door; he
  could see now that Laura, who had seemed so serene when they entered the
  room, was much excited; she was even smiling to herself in the muted light
  (the sun being at the back of the house) that fell through the holland blind
  and gave her mourning garments a dingy, musty look. She appeared to be
  secretly listening, and the two men suddenly noticed that the air of the room
  seemed stagnant, as if it had been shut up all night, and, dry and cautious
  as they were, into the minds of both crept a warning&mdash;of what they did
  not know.</p>

  <p>The doctor pulled at Mrs. Sylk's sleeve and whispered some words of
  advice; his mumbling tones irritated the lawyer, who went, with a clumsy
  slowness that was like a flight, out of the chamber.</p>

  <p>Laura Sarelle's eyes darkened through the sudden dilation of her pupils;
  she rose with a stiff rustle of her bombazine gown and moved towards the
  closet; as the little door closed behind her she looked at her writing-desk
  and said, her finger to her lips: "I must write to Lucius and tell him not to
  come here until Harry is hanged."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The two men&mdash;the ugly, taciturn lawyer in his precise town clothes,
  and the stooping, elderly doctor in his country frieze&mdash;returned to the
  library, avoiding each other's look.</p>

  <p>And there in the window-place, full in the sunlight, that had taken on the
  warm tint of evening, sat Harry Mostyn, with his face twisted, talking
  rapidly, thickly, spreading out his hands as he spoke.</p>

  <p>His companion was Lord Belmont, the man who to the two gentlemen now
  entering was still the steward of Leppard Hall.</p>

  <p>Holding his hat and cane, he stood by the case where he had so often
  worked with Sir Theo; his bright good looks, which moved all who looked at
  him in his favour, were clouded; he seemed to muse as he listened, and yet to
  be keenly conscious of every accent, every word used by the other man, as if
  he were endeavouring to follow the workings of the other man's mind. Harry
  Mostyn paused as the door was opened and stopped short with a great sigh.</p>

  <p>Regarding him gravely, the other man spoke, as doctor and lawyer moved
  slowly into the room that even that last sunlight of the summer day did not
  seem able to warm, or even to brighten.</p>

  <p>"You think this an intrusion, sirs, and so it is, but I cannot stay away.
  I was an intimate in this house for two years, and though there was a breach,
  I will not say quarrel, between Theo and myself, we had been friends at
  college&mdash;Mr. Mostyn is a stranger to me, but he has accepted my
  services."</p>

  <p>"Your services, sir?" repeated Mr. Spryce sharply.</p>

  <p>"I am a stranger here," said Harry Mostyn slowly; "I'm glad of any offer,
  even of companionship. I feel my situation to be very disagreeable. You may,
  if you will, gentlemen, ask my lord to help you in any way that he will be
  good enough to offer to do so."</p>

  <p>"Sir, I do not see any way in which he can help us," said Dr. Selby. "But
  it was good of you, my lord, to come, and under the circumstances."</p>

  <p>"I know how he can help me," said Mr. Mostyn, "for I tell you I'm damned
  glad of a friendly face&mdash;I thought that Lord Belmont, when he came in
  just now, did look as if he was likely to understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And so, sir, you have been telling him the tale?" asked Mr. Spryce of
  Harry Mostyn, who replied, "Yes."</p>

  <p>"I waited on the vicar this morning," put in the young earl. "I heard a
  good deal from him&mdash;the servants, you will understand&mdash;well, the
  village talks of nothing else&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mostyn rose.</p>

  <p>"I think my lord to be just&mdash;I have to trust someone, and I hope that
  he'll act fairly for Laura's sake as well as for common humanity. I have told
  him&mdash;all I can tell anyone. I have asked him to come on an errand with
  me now. You'll excuse us?"</p>

  <p>"Why, sir," asked Mr. Spryce, "should you confide in Lord Belmont, rather
  than in us?&mdash;his lordship is a stranger!"</p>

  <p>"My reason hardly matters. This is not a matter for professional men. Your
  place, sir, is rather here&mdash;with Laura, with my wife. Oh," he added
  quickly, "I'll not try to escape. Pray credit me with not being a fool."</p>

  <p>"Sir, I shall answer for you. Mr. Spryce, I beg you to remain at Leppard
  Hall until we return."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>As soon as the two men were in the avenue Mr. Mostyn broke out:</p>

  <p>"I want you to come with me to the vicarage; I don't think that the parson
  has been questioned yet about the book. And I want to be the first to do
  so."</p>

  <p>"Some such volume I had once in my own hands&mdash;out of curiosity. I saw
  a print of Edward Avershaw's face, and made nothing of it, not recognizing
  the likeness to that damnable portrait."</p>

  <p>"I was warned," said Mr. Mostyn&mdash;"that day in Warwick&mdash;some
  peril of the mind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are holding something from me, of course&mdash;if it is to Laura's
  interest&mdash;very well. But I could help you better if I knew all&mdash;I
  fear that it is an infernal business&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I think, too, that the Devil had a hand in it," groaned Mr. Mostyn. "I
  thank you for your confidence in me, sir, but I cannot give my entire
  confidence to you&mdash;the story, as I fear it, goes beyond words&mdash;I
  dare not even say to myself what I begin to dread."</p>

  <p>"One of the servants perhaps? How do we know the stories of all the people
  in that house, all the possible spites and malice? Theo was a difficult man
  and could be unjust and ill-tempered. If we could find who put that book in
  your room, who chose that Venetian glass to put the poison in&mdash;who
  thrust it into your hand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn broke out:</p>

  <p>"Why do you believe in me? I've played a scoundrel's part. I took her away
  from you and married her secretly. And it was all for the money; I never even
  liked Laura Sarelle."</p>

  <p>"Believe in you? I do not know why I do&mdash;to that extent. Common
  sense, I suppose. I do not think you are a murderer, and I think you are
  sane. And this affair is insane."</p>

  <p>They glanced at each other as they turned aside from the avenue across the
  parkland; the sunlight was rippling red in the river and edging the flowering
  rushes with light; a few fleecy clouds were dissolving into rosy vapour
  behind the grey church; the younger man felt as if he were in the presence of
  a dream, and of a dream that menaced sanity.</p>

  <p>The little riverside path was empty to the physical eye only; Lucius
  Delaunay could clearly see the figure in the pale dress, hastening away from
  him towards the churchyard.</p>

  <p>The evening light was very clear, he could mark the details of all the
  tiny flowers at his feet; everything was odd, changed, out of focus. "Well,"
  he said, as if to himself, "the only thing that will help is the truth. We
  must have the truth&mdash;the facts."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Harry Mostyn harshly, "and not to save myself, mind you. I owe
  it to <i>her</i>&mdash;if it is as I think it is&mdash;to keep silence. I've
  spoken to Flasket. A scoundrel, but faithful&mdash;" Mr. Mostyn paused, as if
  taken suddenly ill, and put his hand to his side. "I deserved this," he
  muttered, then, lowering his voice still further: "How is <i>this</i> story
  to be hushed up?"</p>

  <p>Then, save for a slight trembling of his lower lip, he recovered himself
  and walked firmly beside the younger man towards the vicarage.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The Reverend Nathaniel Mist received the two gentlemen instantly; he was
  much shaken both by the unexpected death of his wife, who had been dying for
  so long that he had begun to think of her as immortal, and by the tragedy at
  Leppard Hall, and looked old, shabby and dispirited.</p>

  <p>Questioned by Lord Belmont about the book, he looked on his shelf, found
  his copy gone, and remarked that he had last seen it in Mr. Mostyn's
  hands.</p>

  <p>"You were putting it back in the case, sir, as I was entering the room. I
  hoped that you hadn't indulged your curiosity too far. I was supposed to keep
  that book locked up, but I'm careless about such things, I forgot it again. I
  never missed it. I've been preoccupied&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I replaced it," said Harry Mostyn, speaking with difficulty. "Who would
  have&mdash;borrowed&mdash;stolen it?"</p>

  <p>"Why, sir, anyone. My door is left on the latch&mdash;I keep no close
  guard on my poor collection, and of late&mdash;since my wife&mdash;a lonely
  old man, sir." He turned his face, raddled with age, from one to the other;
  the room was full of shadow and a tendril of creeper tapped on the murky
  glass.</p>

  <p>"Agnes, your little maid, might know something&mdash;perhaps she admitted
  someone in your absence," suggested Lord Belmont.</p>

  <p>The vicar looked sadly at the two men who had come to invade his solitude,
  but pulled the bell-rope. Agnes appeared very quickly, her eyes sharp with
  curiosity, while her master questioned her about the missing book, showing
  her with shaking fingers the place on the shelf where it had stood for so
  long.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Madam Mist sent me down for that book one day when Miss Laura was
  here. The ladies were looking at it together. When Miss Laura left, Madam put
  it down behind the cushion in her chair and told me to take it back secretly.
  I wasn't supposed to tell you, sir, but I don't suppose it matters now Madam
  is dead."</p>

  <p>"No," said the parson vaguely, "no, it doesn't matter at all, my good
  girl. That will do. I dare say the book is somewhere about the house. I must
  look."</p>

  <p>"Why, sir, you do look ill! Can I get you a glass of wine?" she exclaimed,
  staring at Lord Belmont, who had come forward.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not ill, Agnes. Can you tell me what the two ladies were talking
  about when you took the book up?"</p>

  <p>"Don't ask her," said Harry Mostyn, pulling his sleeve, but the younger
  man replied: "We must know&mdash;pray, child, of what did they talk?"</p>

  <p>The girl stared from one to the other, then slyly at her master, as she
  answered with a sly relish:</p>

  <p>"Why, sir, about some old story, about another Laura Sarelle. They were
  very close about it, talking eagerly with their heads together. But it was
  all to be a secret. I was sent away. Oh, sir! Have I done wrong in speaking?
  I heard some more when I brought the tea service in."</p>

  <p>"No, no! You must tell me. What were the ladies saying as you went into
  the room with the book?" asked the young earl.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I've always remembered it, sir. Madam had a strange way of speaking,
  so that you did remember what she said. The words were so queer, too. She was
  saying, 'The gossips tried to put it on to Laura Sarelle, because they
  thought that she was trying to make away with both of them, the brother and
  the husband, too, so that she could get the one she cared for'&mdash;or
  something like that, sir."</p>

  <p>"It's an old tale, and best forgotten," said the vicar in a quavering
  voice, looking from one to the other with frightened eyes, his loose lower
  lip trembling.</p>

  <p>"Come, Mr. Mostyn, sir, let us return to the Hall. There is no time to be
  lost."</p>

  <p>"I've nothing to say," said the other with soft violence, "nothing
  whatever."</p>

  <p>"Pray, gentlemen&mdash;can I be of any further service," asked the vicar,
  but without answering him they left the small, cramped and dark house.</p>

  <p>The light still held; the landscape looked tranquil and remote; both men
  gazed ahead so as not to see either the churchyard or the river, and turned
  as quickly as they could across the parkland.</p>

  <p>"I'll keep silence," said Harry Mostyn suddenly, harshly. "The evidence of
  the girl could be set aside. I might say I took it afterwards&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A flight of heavy blackbirds winged overhead, and passed behind Leppard
  Hall, in the direction of the wood where the mausoleum that would be opened
  so soon to admit the body of the last male Sarelle stood.</p>

  <p>"When is the inquest?" he added. "I suppose they have made up their minds
  to that? Or is there to be an arrest for murder at once? He is lying embalmed
  at Warwick, is he not? Well, I am ready and I deserve it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Maybe," replied the young man sternly, "but that is not how&mdash;the
  end&mdash;can be evaded."</p>

  <p>"What can we do? I feel hemmed in."</p>

  <p>"<i>She</i> must be taken away. At once."</p>

  <p>The evening was very quiet about them, as they turned into the avenue.
  Leppard Hall, blotted out by mist, seemed, by that ugly trick that both men
  had noticed before, to blot out the entire landscape.</p>

  <p>"Here she is." Harry Mostyn clutched his companion's arm as a pale figure
  slipped out of the trees of the avenue and came towards them. "Laura!" he
  cried aloud.</p>

  <p>"Hush," whispered the other, and they stood still as the girl approached;
  she was wearing a clumsily made yellow dress.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lucius&mdash;oh, Harry! I put off the mourning and chose this&mdash;I
  made it secretly, when Mrs. Sylk was not looking&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Laura," said Harry Mostyn, "how did you come here? Come with us&mdash;at
  once&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She turned from him.</p>

  <p>"Lucius? Why don't you speak? I have run away. I shall hide for a while.
  They are telling lies about me. Harry's man went to Dr. Selby and said he had
  seen me come to Harry's room with the gold-flecked glass."</p>

  <p>"I forbade him&mdash;but how do you know this?"</p>

  <p>"I listened at the door&mdash;Mrs. Sylk is asleep. She cried so much! I
  was coming down to show my dress when I heard them talking."</p>

  <p>"Where will you go now, Laura?" interrupted Lucius in a voice that
  startled her.</p>

  <p>She shrank back and said:</p>

  <p>"You should not be here. I was going to write to you&mdash;but I forgot.
  You should not be here until Harry is hanged. Then I shall be rich and
  free."</p>

  <p>"Laura&mdash;you know what to do&mdash;" whispered Lucius. "We have heard
  what Madam Mist told you&mdash;we know who put that stuff in the
  glass&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shrieked and, turning as if about to fall, ran from them.</p>

  <p>"The river," whispered Harry Mostyn, turning also.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Lucius, detaining him. "Why did they not see, how she has
  been&mdash;this long while?"</p>

  <p>Harry Mostyn shook him off and ran through the thickening light towards
  the pale figure that like a petal before the breeze hastened towards the grey
  river hidden behind the sedgy banks. Lucius leaned against one of the trees
  and put his hand before his eyes that he might not see Leppard Hall&mdash;of
  all his thoughts one only was coherent: "<i>Now</i> they will raze it to the
  ground."</p>

  <p>The panting breath of the older man, his heavy dragging step, made Lucius
  look through his fingers. Harry Mostyn came stumbling through the dusk.</p>
