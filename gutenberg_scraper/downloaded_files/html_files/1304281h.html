<p><span class="a">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the honour to submit,
for your examination and approval, and for the information of His
Excellency the Governor, the following Report, briefly explaining
the operations of the Expedition to Shark Bay; and adverting to
the geological structure, natural productions, water-parting, and
general character of the interior of this colony to the N. and E.
of the settled districts, and towards the Gascoigne River,
described in the accompanying maps and journals, and explored by
the party under my command, in pursuance of instructions
received, by direction of His Excellency, from the Honourable the
Colonial Secretary, dated 14th June, 1854, detailing the objects
the Government had in view in despatching the Expedition,
pointing out the course proposed for their attainment, and
leaving me at liberty to pursue a different route, if I saw a
corresponding advantage likely to accrue from any deviation
therefrom; provided I formed my plan subject to reaching the
mouth of the Gascoigne, if possible, to meet the ship there at
the appointed time.</p>

<h4><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>[July, 1854]</h4>
<p>The exploring party, under my command, consisted of ten men
with twenty-seven horses, with one hundred and twenty days'
provisions, accompanied by Mr. Woodward, who placed himself, with
Mr. Chidlow's team, escorted by two men, for whom he brought
forty days' rations, under my orders, to proceed to Cow-cowing,
and convey my report of that country to head-quarters. We left
Mombekine, 14 m. N.E. by N. from Northam, on the 10th July, and
proceeded by way of Youlanging, where we crossed the Salt River;
travelling on a course N. 60° E., through gum-forests and
sand-plains 15 m., to Goomalling, a spring and streamlet, at the
S. end of a belt of granite country about 5 m. long and 3 m.
wide, trending N., containing eight thousand acres of second-rate
land, suitable for a horse run, watered by several streams
flowing into the tributary plains of the Mortlock, or Salt River,
and surrounded by scrubby sand-plains.</p>
<p>Travelling thence, on a course N. 3° E., over this land, and
across a belt of elevated sandstone conglomerate, forming a
scrubby forest, we entered extensive casuarina (swamp oak)
plains, dry and hard, and strewed with trees uprooted, and
water-marked 3 ft. high, indicating occasional heavy floods,
flowing S. The country maintained this swampy character for 3 m.,
when we ascended a ravine called Walyurmuring, 911 ft. above the
level of the sea; a grassy spot, watered by pools in a granite
rock, forming a barrier across the ravine which connects the
plain we had traversed with another of a similar description to
the northward, which it drains.</p>
<p>Halting here for a day, in S. lat. 31° 11' 30", E. long. 117°
2', in consequence of three of the Daren men (natives of
Cow-cowing) and Gerip, a native of the country around the Wangan
Hills, having joined us this morning; when Gerip corroborated the
accounts I had before heard of a good tract of grassy land
extending from Kalguddering towards Gnyngarning, about 80 m. E.
of Bebano, and I sent Messrs. Whitfield, Brown, and Woodward to
visit and report upon this place, and the lead off to the
northward, while I, through an interpreter, interrogated the
Daren men, from whom I received a favourable description of their
country around, and to the N.E. of Cow-cowing, and who expressed
their intention of accompanying us through the thickets. Mr.
Whitfield returned in the evening, reporting that Kalguddering,
whence the Wangan Hills were visible, apparently 15 m. off,
bearing N.N.W., in line with the southern group, was a patch of
granite country, 14 m. N.N.W. from camp, affording 2000 acres of
second-rate grazing land, watered by two springs, and surrounded
by scrubby gum-forests and sand-plains; while the intervening
country, after leaving the casuarina plains around Walyurmuring,
presented gum-forests and sand-plains, stretching far to the N.,
and swarming with kangaroo. Had this report been more favourable,
I intended to have visited Gnyngarning, and travelled through
this country on my return. Resuming our journey on the 14th, in
company with three of the Toodyay natives, Gerip, and the Daren
men, on a course N. 76° E., we travelled over undulating
sand-plains 6 m., to a spring on the N. side of a salt lake,
called Koombekine, 1025 ft. above the level of the sea, and found
the country beyond this place so densely wooded that it was
necessary to leave the cart here, in charge of the Toodyay
natives, and make a detour on a course N. 94° E., along the
sand-hills, on the N. side of some marshy thickets trending to
the southward. After travelling 4 m. over these scrubby hills, we
descended into a dense thicket of eucalyptus-wattles, growing on
red and white sandy soil, extending 6 m., in which, with the
exception of several knowow's, or native pheasant's
nests&mdash;rings of sand and gravel, 10 feet in diameter, with a
deep hole in the centre filled with narrow acacia-leaves, placed
there by these birds to ferment, and form a bed sufficiently warm
to hatch their eggs artificially&mdash;we saw no traces of birds
or animals. It is singular that this thicket is below the level
of the lakes to the eastward and westward of it. Emerging from
it, we passed about a mile along the foot of a sand-hill, and
bivouacked at a spring on the N. side called Hejanding. Steering
thence N. 93° E., along the smooth gravelly shore of a small salt
lake, surrounded by gum-forests, after travelling 4 m., we struck
the S.W. shore of the great salt lake called Cow-cowing; and, as
it was skirted with dense eucalyptus and acacia thickets, while
the bed was dry, I held my course over the S. end of the lake,
forming two indents, or bays, 6 m. across, presenting a yellow,
saline sediment, covered with minute univalve shells and
extensive patches of samphire, with round shallow holes, and
separated by a narrow neck of land, from the summit of which the
Binjemaring Hills bore S. about 10 m. off. The natives report
permanent water and a patch of grassy country there, surrounded
by sand-plains, in which kangaroos are numerous, though we have
not seen any tracks of those animals since we entered the
thickets. Notwithstanding the lake was dry we found it very heavy
travelling for both men and horses, and I halted for the night on
the eastern shore, at a well on the N. side of a sand-hill called
Nalging, in S. lat. 31° 7' 54", E. long. 117° 28', from the
summit of which the natives view the extensive sheet of water on
the N.W. side of the lake; superstition and fear, based on the
supposed existence of a large snake, that swallowed several black
fellows whole some years ago, probably originating in these men
having sunk in the soft bottom while travelling over the
treacherous crust, deterring them from a closer inspection of
that famous part of the lake; hence the conflicting and erroneous
reports that have emanated from them relative to this place.</p>
<p>The well was drawn dry for the horses during the night, and in
the morning I found that the sandy basin in which it was sunk was
thoroughly drained. I crossed the lake, searching in vain for
fresh water. Returning to camp I observed a sand hummock in the
lake, and while I made arrangements to leave with Mr. Whitfield,
Narryer, and Wooddang, to make further search if requisite, I
sent three men to dig there. I found them 5 ft. down, picking at
a hard cemented sandy floor similar to the bottom of a well,
which Capt. Elliot, with a detachment of the 99th regiment and
myself, sunk and found salt water in, while crossing Perron's
peninsula at Shark Bay, in the summer of 1850, and knowing
further efforts there were useless, I sent the men into camp, and
pushed on through the thicket on the S.E. shore, to a place
called "Twattergnuyding," 7 m. N.E., where we found feed and
water, and I encamped the party the following day. Here the lake
presented three large arms stretching N.E., N.W., and S.W.,
falling from the N.E. and N.W. towards the S.W.; while on the
N.W. side a large body of water was so little below the level of
this place, which is 996 ft. above the level of the sea, that the
water flowed back here during the prevalence of a N.W. gale. I
observed the bed of the lake was cut up in every direction by emu
tracks, converging to the rain-water splashes around
Twattergnuyding, on which several mountain ducks and painted teal
were shot.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;I left Mr. Whitfield in charge
of the camp and proceeded, accompanied by Mr. Woodward, Narryer,
and Wambinning, to examine the Cow-cowing Lake and surrounding
country, steering N.N.W. We had some difficulty in crossing the
lake now the water was blown over. The bottom in many places was
like quicksand, and we had to pursue a circuitous route of many
miles along the crooked belts of samphire and salsolaceous
plants, to reach the opposite shore, where we entered a thicket
of eucalyptus and acacia, morrell, gnalerack or cable gum, and
thorny scrub, on hard bare red loam, studded with small salt
lakes, extending about 12 m. on our course, and terminating in a
dense eucalyptus wattle thicket, along the shore of the lake, at
the foot of a patch of undulating granite country, where we
bivouacked. Perceiving that we should be involved in thickets and
salt marshes by holding our course to the northward, I determined
to steer to the eastward and examine the country said to exist
there favourable for sheep. Striking into the forest on a due E.
course, travelling 7 m. through dense scrub and gum-trees on bare
red loamy soil without a vestige of any grass, though the country
has not been burnt for several years, we struck a dry arm of the
lake flowing from the N.E., and crossed over 4 m. of samphire
flats, forming its bed, to the opposite shore, where we entered
another scrubby forest extending 6 m. on our course, and reached
the shore of another lake trending S.W., with shallow pools of
salt water and samphire beds. Our course led about 6 m. along the
N. side of this lake, and then 12 m. beyond, through gum forest
and scrub, to a group of granite hills called Wadduring, on the
N.E. side of which the native led us to a fine running streamlet
taking its rise at the base of the most prominent bare hill, and
flowing through a small grassy flat, to the N.W.: while between
this bare hill and a wooded range to the westward there was a
fine grassy valley containing 50 acres of rich black loam and two
permanent springs. Turning our horses loose here, I ascended the
hill and obtained an extensive view, embracing all the places the
Daren men had described, which, as Wambinning pointed them out,
one by one, proved to be isolated granite rocks, affording only
feed and water, at certain seasons, sufficient for a few horses
<i>en route</i> to better country, and surrounded by dense
scrubs. This was the country the settlers of the eastern
districts had been so long anxious to avail themselves of,
relying on the favourable interpretation that resulted from
inquiries among its hardy and cheerful inhabitants, who form a
high opinion and give most glowing descriptions of any place that
will generally afford them a rat and a draught of water.
Returning to camp on the 24th I found all well, and moved the
party to Wadduring, where we arrived on the 26th, and I halted a
day to reconnoitre and give the horses an opportunity to fill
themselves in this grassy spot. By observations of the sun and
stars I found the highest summit of Wadduring (bare) hill in S.
lat. 31° 00' 13" E., and long. 117° 59' 30' by chart; apparent
elevation above the surrounding plain 250 ft.; while the camp at
its base was 1236 ft. above the level of the sea by observations
taken simultaneously by you at your house in Perth, and by myself
at this place with Dent's aneroid barometers, and 6½ m. S.S.W.
from Gylburngobbing (Mount Marshall) on your track from the
eastward in 1836, and about 20 m. N.W. from Lake Brown.</p>
<p>I found, and on reference to the chart it will be seen at a
glance, there was no inducement for me to push farther E. from
this place, as Mr. Gregory had traversed to and from a point 90
m. to the N.E. of it; so I determined to make northing by
traversing the unexplored country between his outward and return
track, and push vigorously to the north-eastward after I had
cleared his work. In pursuance of this plan, we left Wadduring on
the 27th July, and forced our way from granite rock to rock for
water and feed, through gum forests and dense scrubs, to the high
bare granite hill on Mr. Gregory's return track, in S. lat. 29°
53' 12", E. long. 118°; working between this parallel and 118°
12' of long., over ground rising from the lakes (1026 ft. above
the level of the sea) on the N. side of Mount Marshall, to 1636
ft. in lat. 30° 26', shedding its waters to the S.W. between lat.
31° 13" [sic] and lat. 31° 34', and to the N.E. between the
latter meridian and the high bare granite hill, to the base of
which, 1205 ft. above the level of the sea, the country falls
from lat. 30° 26'. Between the points last named there are no
water-courses, and the scrubs are almost impenetrable. Along this
track no springs or permanent water-holes could be found, nor do
I think any exist, and we depended upon the precarious supply of
rain-water accumulated in the hollows of the rocks, which are
coarse amorphous breccia composed of felspar, quartz, and green
stone. Fragments of these rocks cover the ground, and mixed with
débris of red sandstone, the prevailing rock of the surrounding
plains, form brown and red gravelly soils, strewed with small
angular fragments of highly crystalline quartz, densely wooded
with eucalyptus and acacia (woorruck and jam wattles), where the
soil is red and loamy and the granite predominates, while
melaleuca (tea-tree), wattles, and cypress-trees present
formidable thickets, where the quartz and red sandstone rocks
afford a yellowish brown light sandy loam, with small angular
fragments of quartz. In the thickets of young acacia, on the
better land, tufts of soft silk-like grass and slender rushes,
such as the natives in the settled districts sew their cloaks and
a bushman clears his pipestem with, grow luxuriantly; and a
jointed grass, resembling couch, that the horses were very fond
of, climbed and covered high bushes in the most shady spots. We
arrived at the high bare granite hill on the 4th of August, where
I halted the party five days to recruit my horses and make
arrangements for sending Mr. Woodward with his team and escort to
head-quarters, with a letter to you, reporting all well, the
country traversed, and my determination to push into the interior
and proceed thence to Shark Bay, to meet the ship at the mouth of
the Gascoigne on the 17th October next.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 238}</u></p>
<h4><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>[August, 1854]</h4>
<p><i>August</i> 11.&mdash;This morning I issued ten days'
provisions, ten rounds of ammunition, three pack-saddles, and two
double-barrelled guns to Mr. Woodward for himself and party, and
instructed him to return on our tracks and proceed to
head-quarters with my report, taking with him Mr. Chidlow's two
horses and a horse named Polly belonging to Mr. Phillips, to be
delivered to their owners. At noon we were all in readiness to
start, and Mr. Woodward and his party left us, with our hearty
thanks for his kind and valuable services. Giving him a cheer as
he entered the scrubs, we recommenced our journey, steering N.
25° E. to a low granite hill 2 m. distant, at the N.E. extremity
of this group of rocks, from which we steered N. 34° E. through
an opening in the salt marshes that stretched to the N.W. and
southward. Travelling on this course 6 m. through scrubby plains,
thickets, and salt marshes falling to the westward, we entered
plains of red loam covered with quartz stones, wooded with
acacia, eucalyptus, and casuarina, and extending 10 m. on our
course to the foot of an elevated patch of rocky country,
presenting conical quartz hills, resting on granite breccia and
cliffs about 50 ft. high, the lower portion of which presented a
glistening white rock composed of felspar and quartz grit, capped
by red sandstone, forming a table-land covered with scrub. Our
route here led through a thicket of acacia, casuarina, and
gum-trees, on red loamy soil, covered with quartz stones, for
half a mile, when we encountered another cliff of a similar
description, facing to the S., and passed through a stony defile,
densely wooded, bounded by these precipitous rocks. The natives
had broken down the bushes, and formed a rude fence about 3 feet
high on each side of this defile, about half a mile in length,
converging towards the eastern entrance, where there was a square
hole 18 inches wide, with stout pegs driven in at the sides, to
which they attach a net made of wattle-bark string, into which
they drive the small animals that are very numerous in these
thickets. Travelling over about 4 miles of tolerably level stony
country beyond this place, we passed several new fences in the
thickets, and saw fresh tracks of the natives who were
constructing them, as well as a small bark cup they had left at a
water-hole. At sunset we reached the hill for which we had been
steering the last two days, and found it a rocky table-land,
falling gently to the westward, covered with scrub and bare
patches of honeycombed sandstone, and terminating abruptly to the
eastward in a perpendicular escarpment 140 ft. high, presenting
the same section and appearance as the cliffs we had passed. Some
of the indents or deep bays were nearly circular, and had the
appearance of vast amphitheatres, to which the varied colours of
the red and white rocks, furrowed by water that had deposited the
denuded felspar in a broad sheet of white pipeclay at the base,
forming a glistening pavement, gave a lively and beautiful
effect. Our dog brought a porcupine (<i>echidna hystrix</i>) to
bay at the foot of these cliffs, where Mr. Guerin found this
singular animal endeavouring to bury itself, while poor Turpin
was barking and furious at pricking himself every time he tried
to lay hold of it. Finding plenty of water here in the hollows of
the rocks, we searched in vain for feed in the vicinity till
dark, when we encamped for the night, and tied up the horses on
the summit of the cliff, as the water was in places inaccessible
to them, and there was great risk serious accidents would result
from their being allowed to rove here, where the ground was
intersected by deep ravines, covered with bushes. The ensuing
morning, observing some broken country, with granite rocks
cropping out round the red sandstone cliffs, 2 m. E.N.E., we
proceeded there, expecting to find feed for our horses, but as
this, the most promising place, was as scrubby, stony, and
destitute of grass as the country we had travelled over, I halted
the party while I ascended the hill to make a reconnaissance
before proceeding farther. It was then raining so hard that the
country around was enveloped in thick mist. However, after
waiting a short period, I could see that the country was more
open and favourable to the N.N.E., and moved off with the party
in that direction to some salt marshes 4 m. distant, where I
found some coarse salt feed, and turned the horses out to graze.
It rained heavily all day and night, and we had great difficulty
to prevent the horses straying back on the track. These salt
marshes, in S. lat. 28° 29' 30", E. long. 118° 15', were 1104 ft.
above the sea, and, falling to the westward, stretched to the
verge of the horizon E. by S. and W. by S. The coarse feed, cold,
and wet combined, gave several of the horses the gripes the
following morning, when we proceeded on the same course, N.N.E.
12 m., over undulating, stony, scrubby country, and Mr. Kenneth
Brown, who was in advance with me, caught a glimpse, through a
vista in the thicket, of an elevated range of table-shaped and
peaked hills, similar in appearance and contour to the Champion
Bay country. This was a welcome discovery. Looking through the
telescope, I thought it promised well, and determined to proceed
there. I found its bearing N. 10° E., and apparent distance 30 m.
By this time the whole of the party joined us, and, as soon as
the good news was communicated, they pushed on in high spirits.
We named the highest table-land Mount Kenneth, after my young
friend who discovered it. Travelling through dense thickets, we
entered a descending country, destitute of water, in which all
the bushes were dead or dying, and fell crashing before us,
staking several of the horses, and the grass was dry and dusty
from two or three years' drought at least. Had it not been for
the promising country ahead, it is probable we should have been
dispirited on this occasion, and I felt thankful for this gleam
of hope and its cheering influence on my weary companions, though
my own conviction was, judging from the gradual inclination of
the incumbent rocks dipping to the S. and W., that the upheaving
primary rocks cropped out far to the northward and eastward of
the place we were steering for, which, at best, could only be a
transition country, forming second-rate land, which, though a
vast improvement on the sandstone formation we had been
traversing, would only be of use to the colony by affording
valuable mineral deposits or pasture for stock en route to a
better country beyond.</p>
<p>We saw no more of Mount Kenneth till the following night, when
we emerged from the scrubs and entered an open plain, and found
water and feed in a rocky gully 12 m. S. of it, where we halted,
and then pushed on over stony plains, rising as we advanced,
crossing some rugged scrubby greenstone hills midway, to the foot
of the mount, where we found it and the surrounding table-hills
of sandstone formation, capped by ironstone, and covered with
scrub. Observing a grassy stream-bed, with small pools of water
in it, E. by N., about a mile from Mount Kenneth, I moved the
party on and encamped them. Here I halted the party two days to
recruit them and the horses, inspect our stores, and make
necessary alterations and repairs. By meridian altitude of the
sun during the day and a Lyræ in the evening, I found the
latitude of the mount was 28° 57' 11" S., and long. 118° 20' E.,
and obtained a commanding view from the summit. Far as the eye
could range to the N. and E., sandstone flat-topped ridges,
trending N.E., and presenting facades of a white hue, capped by
overhanging rocks of a red colour, clothed with acacia scrub,
strewed the extensive stony plains in that direction, through
which, here and there, peaked white hills of stratified quartz
rocks, inclining to the westward and resting on greenstone,
jutted out in association with several amorphous masses of
breccia composed of sienitic granite and felspar. From N.W. to
W., on a radius of 30 m., low rounded hills of trap formation,
apparently greenstone, covered with scrub, gave the country in
that direction an undulating, scrubby character; while to the
southward, the country we had traversed presented scrubby waves,
rolling to the verge of the horizon. The summit of this hill was
180 ft. above the level of the surrounding plain, which was 1401
feet above the level of the sea, and intersected by several
watercourses trending S.E., all now dry, and presenting rocky
beds, though not deep channels, as the rocks arc close to the
surface. The main stream was 50 ft. wide, and evidently shed the
waters of this country into the lakes we crossed in S. lat. 29°
29' 30".</p>
<p>The following specimens of natural history were procured here
by Mr. Brown, and preserved, viz.;&mdash;Two white owls, with
small brown spots on the back of the neck and wings (<i>strix
delicatula</i>), two cinnamon-coloured ground thrushes
(<i>cinnamoneus cinclosoma</i>), three small brown parrots with
slate-coloured breasts (<i>Euphemia Bourkii</i>), a very small
scarlet bird (<i>epithianura auriforis</i>), and a small rat
(<i>apalotis Mitchelli?</i>), I saw a small tree among these
hills, in form and size resembling a fig-tree, with pear-shaped
seed-pods hanging point down, and radiating from a common process
at the base of the leaf-stalks. Subsequently I saw large
quantities of these seed-pods at the fireplaces of the natives,
and I believe they eat the seeds.</p>

<p><em>August</em> 19.&mdash;We resumed our journey, steering
N.E., as I now considered the change in the formation of the
country favoured my pushing boldly in that direction towards the
outcrop of the primary ridge, which appears to have suddenly
elevated this portion of the continent, and disturbed the level
of the primeval ocean in which it was submerged, that rolled from
E. to W., sweeping away the torn country and loosened hills in
its course, and thus denuded the vast area we had traversed of
the superincumbent rocks, many hundreds of feet in thickness. Our
course, for 6 m., lay through broken country, presenting
sandstone cliffs, quartz, round scrubby hummocks of black shining
iron ore, and stony plains, wooded with acacia and sandal-wood
trees, and drained by a stream 30 yards wide, trending S.E., the
bed of which was dry and shallow, like an arm of a lake, and
presented a white, glistening bottom, composed of felspar.
Travelling thence, through acacia and cypress thickets, on
undulating, stony, and red loamy soil, we struck extensive salt
marshes, trending N. and S., 3 m. across, perfectly dry, and
presenting a sound, but soft and heavy bottom for our horses.</p>
<p>Here I observed the country was less densely wooded in a line
with a white patch of rocks bearing N. 70° E., and steered
towards them. Crossing this marsh was heavy work for the horses:
they sank up to the knees, every step, in the soft, yellow,
saline sediment, and had to step quick, or they would have been
up to their girths in it, though it was dry and dusty; however,
they struggled through with great courage, and maintained this
trying pace bravely, till they reached the opposite shore, when
they were fairly blown. Breathing them a few minutes there, we
pushed on again, in hopes of finding grass and water for the poor
animals; but the thicket became more dense and unpromising as we
advanced, and, when night approached, I halted in the scrub, and
tied them up for the night without either. Having had so much
rain recently, I depended upon finding plenty of water everywhere
for several days, and was surprised when I found that the parched
land had absorbed it so rapidly.</p>
<p>The next morning we steered E.N.E., through an almost
impenetrable thicket, to the right and left of which still denser
cypress scrubs presented hard, wall-like fronts. The horses were
so jaded that our pace did not exceed a mile an hour. At this
pace, hour after hour, we plodded wearily through this wretched
country. At length the soil changed from stiff red loam to red
sandy loam, and we reached a more open country, covered with low
acacia scrub, after travelling about 3 m., when the cypress
thickets trended round to the southward, sending out a few spurs
only in the direction we were travelling. Wishing to avoid even
these, if possible, I ascended a bush to reconnoitre, and sighted
a patch of granite rocks, 3 m. off, bearing N., for which we
steered at once, and arrived there at 11h. 40m. <span class=
"a">a.m.</span> We found water and feed, and bivouacked for the
day to rest the horses. While the horses were unloaded here, I
obtained a meridian altitude of the sun, and found our position
in S. lat. 28° 43' 23", long. 118° 38' E.</p>
<p>From the rising ground behind the camp Mount Kenneth was
visible, and the summit of an elevated group of round-topped
hills loomed blue in the distance, bearing N. I E., about 15 m.
off. I determined to proceed to these hills the next day. To the
eastward, the country was gently undulating and very scrubby.
There were three patches of bare, rounded, red granite rocks
here, and a small spring at the base of the most southern group,
close to the bivouac. Abundance of silky grass grew in tufts in
the acacia thickets around, and very coarse grass was growing in
the clefts of the rocks, the roots of which, when pulled up,
emitted a pungent odour, something like ammonia.</p>
<p>The following morning two of the horses strayed away.
Expecting they would be speedily tracked up and brought in, we
saddled, and had the horses standing between the loads, ready to
have them put on directly the ramblers arrived. It was noon,
however, before they were brought in. Narryer, who had brought in
one horse, reported he had broken one of his hobble-straps,and
gone off 9 m. to the westward. Souper found the other horse in a
patch of grass in a rocky gully 3 m. N.W. As it was now too late
to push on to the hills 15 m. N., and the horses had been saddled
up all the morning, I determined to leave their loads here, and
take the horses to the place Souper had found, so that they might
start the next morning in good heart. Accordingly, at 1h.
<span class="a">p.m.</span>, I started, with Messrs. Whitfield,
Brown, Guerin, Buck, Farmer, and Souper, with the horses only,
leaving the other men, with Mr. Fraser, in charge of the camp. We
had not proceeded far, when Mr. John Hardey's horse reared and
fell, kicking violently, among the rocks. In an instant, four
other horses were spinning in the air, and fell, plunging
violently when they were down. By the time the other horses that
required to be tied up were secured, their prostrate companions
were quiet, and, seeing it was poison they were suffering from,
we bled them freely, which seemed to afford immediate relief,
though they were unable to rise again for three or four hours.
Scarcely had the fleams been wiped, when my own two horses were
reeling and stupified, and obliged to be bled also, and left with
the others in charge of Mr. Guerin. As it was not safe to turn
the horses loose in this vicinity, I sent Mr. Whitfield on with
the other horses to Souper's Flat, instructing him to bleed any
of them that staggered, and tie them all up till I joined him. I
then returned to the camp for the tether-ropes and some
medicines, and proceeded with them, in company with Mr. Fraser,
to the flats, where I found Mr. Whitfield, who reported having
bled two other horses before my arrival. The grass here was of
the same description as that described growing on the rocks near
the camp, and the poison-bushes were growing along with it
everywhere, so that we had to cut them up with our hatchets to
clear two tethers for each horse. This poison-plant is a species
of <i>gastrolobium</i>, with a small, bright, orange-coloured
pea-blossom, like birds' eyes. The leaves are opposite and
spreading, 2 inches long, wedge-shaped, with a triangular apex,
at each angle of which, and at the base of the leaf, are small
thorns, and the breadth at the base of the apex is half an inch.
The average height of the bushes is 3 ft., though many are much
larger. This is the first instance I know of horses having been
seriously affected by this plant. Some years ago, Dr. Harris gave
a large quantity of it to a pony without injuring the animal. I
am, therefore, disposed to think my horses were so seriously
affected in consequence of their stomachs being empty and
weak.</p>
<p>The other horses were too much weakened to carry their loads,
and, as there was no chance of their improving in condition where
they were, I determined to move them to a better place as soon as
possible, and leaving eleven horses that could not travel in
charge of Messrs. Whitfield, Buck, Farmer, Narryer, and Edwards,
whom I also left in charge of the camp and stores, with
instructions to procure grass from the thicket at hand, wash the
roots, and feed the horses on them, if they were hungry, or on a
little flour-gruel, till they gained strength, I pushed off with
the rest of the party and ten days' rations, leading the rest of
the animals, sixteen in number, steering N. ½ E. towards the
hills seen in that direction. Travelling 9 m. on this course
through stony undulating country, wooded with acacia, we entered
a sandy plain, covered with dry, soft grass in tufts under acacia
bushes, affording better feed than we had seen for several days,
though it was very indifferent. Here I halted, and turned the
horses out to feed. Soon afterwards I found it necessary to have
four more horses bled, as their heads were swollen, and they were
just going to spin. There now remained only eleven horses
unaffected, and these, unfortunately, were the weakest. During
the afternoon and nigh t the rain poured down in torrents. The
wind was from the N.W. The next morning the horses were tucked up
like racers, having been standing up all night during the storm
without feeding. I therefore allowed them to graze till 10
<span class="a">a.m.</span>, when we resumed our march through
dense scrubs to the stony plains around the foot of the hill,
where we saw old tracks of red kangaroos, in well-beaten paths 18
inches wide, and put up several gnows. After watering the horses
<i>en route</i>, I observed they scoured very much, and several
were griped. Under these circumstances I kept them moving very
briskly. Arriving at the hills, I found their elevation less
considerable than their appearance from a distance led me to
expect, their great apparent height being attributable to the
gradual rise of the country in the direction we were travelling.
Ascending them, I found they were of foliated greenstone
formation, about 200 ft. above the plain, very scrubby and rocky,
and that there was not a blade of grass on them. A range, of a
similar description, lay 2 m. to the W.N.W., and a group of
ironstone hills 2 m. E.S.E., nearly of the same elevation, and
covered with dense scrub. To the northward, open acacia plains
extended to the foot of a range of hills 12 m. off, the summit of
which bore N.N.E. As the most favourable country intervened, I
determined to steer towards these hills, and halt at the first
suitable place I could find <i>en route</i>. Descending from the
hill at 2 <span class="a">p.m.</span>, we found the plain
composed of good, light, red loam, very stony in many places, and
covered, in most, with dry perished grass, presenting an
appearance that induces me to believe this is the first heavy
rain that has fallen here for two or three years. There were
several burrows like boudy holes, inhabited by animals whose
tracks resembled those of the dalgite, in these plains, the earth
around and thrown out from which was perfectly white, and
presented the appearance of lime, though it was really decomposed
foliated greenstone, which assumes this colour when exposed to
the atmosphere, giving the hills composed of it the loom of
quartz hills, when viewed from a distance, as it is only when
fractured that the brilliant green lustre of the rock is
developed. The prevailing rocks on the plain were quartz and
ironstone; but the soil beneath was rich and deep, and in a
favourable climate would most probably have been very fertile.
Not a trace of natives having recently visited this country, or
even the smoke of a distant fire, could be seen here, nor have we
seen anything of the kind since Mr. Woodward left us; and I am,
therefore, induced to think that the great scarcity of water has
obliged them to abandon this desert country. At 5 <span class=
"a">p.m.</span> we passed a rocky hill, presenting slopes of
dislocated granite, blended with greenstone. This laid on our
left, our course leading between it and a huge pile of large
granite rocks, heaped in a cone 90 ft. high. Soon afterwards we
struck a small samphire and salt bush flat, half a mile from the
base of the hills we were steering for, and, finding water and
grass, bivouacked there for the night, having marched 21 m. I
then pushed to the summit of the hill, to obtain a view of the
country beyond. The surrounding hills prevented my obtaining such
an extensive view as I had anticipated. A more rugged hill than
the one I ascended can scarcely be conceived. Had it not been for
my gun-sling, I must have ascended unarmed. Large square blocks
of granite and greenstone were piled confusedly together to a
height of 250 ft., in masses so perpendicularly and awkwardly
placed, that it was only by climbing the bushes and springing
from them on to the rocks I managed to accomplish the ascent.
From W.N.W. to E., over an area of 4 m., detached groups of hills
of a similar formation formed rocky, undulating country, wooded
with acacia, with only one break affording a view of the country
beyond, through which I caught a glimpse of a high range of
hills, bearing N. 6° W., apparently 20 m. distant, to which I
proceeded the following day.</p>
<p>Travelling through the 4 miles of broken country above
mentioned, and the scrubby plains 3 miles beyond, we entered
level, open plains, covered with salt weeds and coarse grass, and
a tolerable supply of water, owing to the recent heavy rains. If
the water would last, I saw I could recruit my horses here, but
as they were tolerably full and fresh now, and the range ahead
promised something better, I pushed on, over black iron ore and
sharp gravel, through a dense thicket, that stretched from the
northern side of these plains, that I subsequently called the
Recruit Flats, 13 m. to the foot of the range, which we reached
at 5 h. 30 m. <span class="a">p.m.</span>, and bivouacked on a
small patch of dry grass, in a thicket at the base of the eastern
side, abreast of the highest summit, formed by the shed of a
rocky gully that flowed down the side of the hill, and, spreading
over, fertilised this spot; but the bed of this streamlet was
dry, and the grass sapless and dusty, apparently very old, and it
was only on the salt bush and acacia spray that the horses fed.
The base of this hill was 1569 ft. above the sea, and the
elevation of the summit 400 ft. above the plain. The range, in
which it formed the prominent feature, presented several conical
summits of less elevation, grouped 5 or 6 m. on each side in the
form of a crescent, facing N.E. The lower portion of the range
was composed of compact, variegated, crystalline rocks, hard,
heavy, and evidently of trap formation; presenting red, white,
and black seams, alternating. Above this rock there rested,
forming the summit of the hills, a mass of flat, dislocated,
stratified rocks, highly crystalline, but of more sombre hue; the
lower beds of which seemed horizontal, while the upper were rent
and piled disorderly. Upon a closer inspection of this rock I
found it presented a laminated structure, composed of thin seams
of puce or chocolate coloured rock, of a clayey character,
separated by delicate layers of a crystalline substance
resembling quartz, and that while the laminae were horizontal,
the fracture was vertical, and at an angle of 45° with the
surface. I found this rock caused great local magnetic
attraction, and that each piece of the stone had two poles, like
the loadstone, powerfully attracting and repelling the same point
of the magnetic needle. I therefore called this hill Mount
Magnet, and fixed its position, by observation, in S. lat. 27°
58', E. long. 118° 37', whence I obtained a view of the country
30 m. around. There was an appearance of wooded hills, with large
trees, surrounded by extensive plains, N. by W. about 25 m., and
a white quartz hill cropped out on the intervening plain, bearing
N.N.W. 7 m. off. To the eastward red, scrubby hills, backed by a
distant range of low red cliffs, presented an unpromising
prospect as far as the eye could reach. I therefore determined to
get all my party and horses to the Recruit Flats, crossed
yesterday, in S. lat. 28° 15', as quick as possible, and retraced
my steps to the camp 50 m. off, where we arrived on the 28th at
noon.</p>
<p>I found seven of my strongest horses dead. The other horses
that I had left were in a very precarious state. As it was
necessary to leave a considerable portion of our equipment
behind, under these circumstances, I lightened up about 4 hundred
weight, by leaving the pack-saddles, spare bags, painted
load-covers and tents, horse-shoes, and such personal comforts as
could be dispensed with, without injuring the health of the
party, and, loading up immediately, moved the whole of the party
and horses, except one which I abandoned in a dying state, to a
place I had found 6 m. off <i>en route</i> to the Recruit Flats.
I found the horses were too weak to carry their loads far, and
that I must sacrifice nearly the whole of them if I determined to
push on, without resting, to the Recruit Flats, 40 m. distant. I
therefore sent out three light parties, on a radius of 15 m.,
ranging from N.W. to E., in search of grass.</p>
<p>In the evening Charles Farmer and Narryer returned, reporting
green grass and water in a thicket 10 m. to the eastward, and the
following morning (the 30th Aug.) I sent Mr. Whitfield and six of
the party there, with the whole of the horses, excepting two
which were left behind without a chance of recovery.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 245}</u></p>
<h4><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>[September, 1854]</h4>
<p>On the 1st September Mr. Whitfield returned to camp, reporting
that the horses were in a good place and doing well. I left him
with Mr. Fraser and Buck in charge of the camp, and joined the
party with the horses, accompanied by two men carrying rations
for them. The following morning I left Messrs. Brown, Guerin,
Edwards, and Cant in charge of the horses, sent C. Farmer and
Souper to the N., and went with Narryer to the E.N.E.
reconnoitering. I travelled about 10 m. on this course, over 4 m.
of stony plains, covered with scrub, and 6 m. of hilly country,
presenting ironstone and trap rocks densely wooded with acacia.
Ascending a hill I saw about 20 m. into the interior, over acacia
thickets, studded with low scrubby hills, similar to those seen
to the northward, and the loom of salt marshes rose under a range
of low scrubby hills that bounded the horizon. I then steered
W.S.W. to some promising looking hills that seemed to have been
burnt, about 11 m. off, travelling over stony plains, densely
wooded, to them. Crossing these plains I saw a new species of
parrot&mdash;a small green bird with a yellow bar across its
breast&mdash;and shot two worrungs, a diminutive species of
kangaroo, about the size of an opossum. We reached the foot of
the hills at 2 h. 30 m. <span class="a">p.m.</span> and saw the
track of a native that had just gone to the summit we were
steering for. Travelling along his tracks a few yards we found a
scoop, or drinking cup, and two clubs, that probably belonged to
him. Narryer picked these up and ascended the hill with me.
Half-way up the ascent we struck a quartz vein, which I stopped
to examine. While stooping, breaking the stones, J heard a
native's voice, and, motioning to Narryer to follow, sprung over
the wall of quartz and confronted a native, stealthily
approaching us about 50 yards higher up the hill, who halted when
he was observed, and foiled in his murderous intentions. Narryer
spoke to him in the Irwin-River language, telling him we were
friendly-disposed and looking for water. He replied in a
desperate rage, uttering a few loud words, and shaking his spear
at us&mdash;but he spoke a language neither of us could
understand, though his hostile intentions were sufficiently
apparent; and, looking back towards the crest of the hill, he
gave the unmistakeable double shout twice, as though he thought,
since we were so peaceable, it would be quite easy to butcher us:
he rushed at Narryer with his spear shipped, to whom I gave the
order to fire, just as it quivered, in the act of being thrown.
Startled and disconcerted by my voice, and quelled by Narryer's
determined bearing, lie turned to fly, and received the charge in
his back that was aimed at his breast, with the singularly
fortunate distinction for him, that it was No. 4 shot instead of
a ball, in consequence of Narryer thinking I said "shot" when I
shouted "stop", as he turned, and giving him the lefthand barrel
then instead of the right. He uttered a loud yell when he was
struck, and bounded over the hill like a stag. Calling Narryer
back, who was running after him, and directing him to load with
ball and follow me to the top of the hill, when we reached the
summit we found the tracks of two other men and a woman, where
they had been crouched up in ambush.</p>
<p>As this man had been so bold, I was apprehensive they had
attacked and gained an advantage over some of my party, and
marched to the bivouac where the horses were, about 7 m. off, at
a rapid pace, cautiously guarding against surprise. Fortunately
all had been and was going on well there, and Farmer arrived soon
after me, reporting that he had found a spring 10 m. N., around
which the natives had built a number of huts last summer, and
that the bones of three wild dogs and many small animals were
scattered about their fireplaces.</p>
<p>At dawn the following morning I mounted Souper on the best
horse, and sent him to Mr. Whitfield, to ascertain how they were
at the camp, and directed Mr. Whitfield, by letter, to be
vigilant, prepare three days' rations for the road, and send
Souper back immediately with a day's rations for my party. I then
had the horses looked up, and finding Jailor in a hopeless state
from fatigue and poison, left him to his fate, and moved over
with them and my party to our bivouac of the 22nd ultimo, 11 m.
W.N.W., where we found Souper waiting for us with the rations and
Mr. Whitfield's report, stating all was well at the camp. The
country traversed to-day was densely scrubby, with patches of dry
perished grass, and stony thickets. Three of the horses were very
weak, and obliged me to travel very slow, so that it was dark
before we reached our destination.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;This morning I travelled
with my party and the horses to the camp to breakfast and load
up. I had now 13 horses, 3 of which were unable to carry more
than their saddles, but we had so reduced the weight and compass
of our baggage, that the 10 available for burthen were enabled to
carry all our provisions, ammunition, and stores requisite to
efficiently equip us for the march to the Gascoigne River, and 20
days' flour in addition, with which the party could fall back on
the Geraldine Mines, in the event of any accident occurring to
the vessel that was to await our arrival there with supplies. I
therefore announced my intention of proceeding to that point in
Shark Bay as speedily as possible, and called the attention of
the party to the fact of our being in as good a position as ever
we were for the attainment of the important results we had
pledged ourselves, under Providence, to achieve, with the
exception of having to walk, which we were well able to do, would
redound to our credit at the close of the march, and be
remembered by those whose good opinion we valued, long after the
fatigue was forgotten; that duty and prudence urged us
forward&mdash;while to retreat, under present circumstances,
would involve fatigues and privations no less trying, and a
spirit-breaking reception from our friends, whom such
faint-hearted conduct would estrange for ever.</p>
<p>As I had made all the necessary arrangements for the
distribution of the loads before I joined the horse-party, the
horses were loaded up in a few minutes after our arrival, and we
resumed our journey, steering N. ½ E. to the Recruit Flats, 40 m.
off, where we arrived on the evening of the 5th. Here I halted
the party to recruit the horses, and Messrs. Fraser, Brown,
Narryer, and Souper accompanied me to make a reconnoissance to
the W.N.W., with a view to finding a favourable route to the
promising-looking country I had seen from Mount Magnet, 50 m.
N.N.W. from our present position, as the country in a direct line
was impracticable. Our course led 3 m. through the open plains
around the camp, bounded by hilly, rocky country of granite,
trap, ironstone, and quartz formation, covered with loose stones
and dense acacia scrub, in which we were entangled two hours
while advancing 3 m. farther on, to an open scrubby plain,
intersected by salt marshes trending S.W., taking their rise on
the N.W. side of Mount Magnet, and about 1500 ft. above the sea.
Twelve miles on our course I halted on these plains, and left
Messrs. Eraser and Brown to rest, while I proceeded with the
natives to search for feed and water, as this was about the
distance my horses could travel in a day, the weakest necessarily
regulating the pace and journey. We found feed 3 m. N., but could
not find any water near it. The promising place in sight was a
rocky hill 6 m. S.W. I therefore returned to my companions and
informed them of the feed&mdash;the probability of there being
water at the hill I pointed out 6 m. W., to which I was about to
proceed with the natives to ascertain the fact&mdash;that in the
event of our being successful, I would send back Souper with
instructions for Mr. Whitfield to move the party to the grass the
first night, and the water the following morning; and wishing
them a safe return, I sent them back to the camp, where they
arrived late at night. I was much pleased with an incident that
occurred on their march, which, though short, was a trying one.
Mr. Fraser was wearing a new pair of strong nailed boots, that in
travelling over the rocks so galled his feet, that, doing his
very best, he fell to the rear. When I halted for him, annoyed at
the circumstance, though I felt sorry for him, I saw Mr. Brown
taking off his boots, and, apprehensive there was something wrong
with him too, I inquired the cause, and he said that "he thought
he could walk very well in Fraser's boots; at any rate he would
lend him his <i>and try</i>." Accordingly the exchange was made,
but the new boots soon served Kenneth the same, and I had to halt
again while they compromised the matter by each wearing one of
the old boots, and wrapping part of their clothes round the other
foot. In this way these young men marched 25 m. through country
covered with sharp rocks and high scrub for 16 hours, on the
first hot day we experienced, without a drink of water, and, what
is far more to their credit, without a murmur.</p>
<p>Sending the two natives out half a mile on each side of me,
with orders to march steadily towards the hill to the westward,
when I had fired my gun and they had answered it, we crossed the
plain searching for water, and found it on the S.W. side of the
hill, where we met and bivouacked. The next morning Narryer shot
the first specimen of the red kangaroo (<i>osphanter rufus</i>),
and I carefully preserved it. It was a male, and rather larger
than the common kangaroo. Its length, from the root of the tail
to the poll of the head, was 5 ft. 3 in., and weight about 140
lbs. Subsequently I saw many much larger. The doe is a very
compact, beautiful animal. In addition to the red colour and
larger size there are other peculiarities appertaining to this
animal which distinguish it from the common species. To a bushman
the most important distinctions are its being more fat and better
eating. But the zoologist, though doubtless in more appropriate
terms, would observe that it was more bullet-headed, and had a
Roman nose&mdash;that this nose was white, with black spots, in
the form of what is called a double smut, and that his ears were
as large as a young calf's, while the lower joint of the hind
leg, from the hock to the toe, is much shorter, the foot or toe
very short&mdash;about 4 in. long in a full-grown animal, and the
jump is 18 ft., with the hind legs bowed and the feet so close
together that the track resembles the spur of a divided hoof.
These animals are not all of them red, some are of a blue or
slate colour, with white throats and breasts, and tan marks on
each side of the face. I have seen them, both bucks and does,
varying thus in colour, herding and feeding together on the
leaves of the nut or native peach-tree that are very numerous
where these kangaroos are found; and two does, differing in
colour, as above described, were killed lying in the shade of the
same bush, each with a young male animal in the pouch, similar in
size, attached to the mamma, which had yellow silky hair, 3 in.
long, growing round them, apparently to keep the young one's nose
warm. My two natives, who had never seen one of these animals
before, were pleased with their success and the praise I gave
them for obtaining this valuable specimen&mdash;success, the
pleasure of which was enhanced by the prospect of making a hearty
breakfast off it, and they assisted me in separating the skin,
head, and feet, from the rest of the carcase, but, unfortunately,
all the peculiarities that I admired, and have noticed, and which
were observed by them on this occasion, induced them to form such
an unfavourable opinion of the animal, that they were afraid to
eat the meat, though they were very hungry, and this was the
first opportunity any of us had had for making a hearty meal for
many weeks. When I expostulated with them, pointing out the
absurdity of neglecting to strengthen themselves with this meat,
Narryer became very excited, and begged me not to propose such a
thing to him, "for," said he, "look at his head&mdash;truly it is
that of a dog with the ears of a cow. Saw you ever kangaroo so
fat, or with meat that smelt so strange? No, sir, this creature
is not natural, and it must be a <i>bwolyer</i> (magician or evil
spirit). Glad am I to be the first of my tribe that has killed
one of this odious race! But my father and mother never eat one,
neither will I. Let the Northern women cat it if they like, but I
must become a great fool before I put any of this strange devil
down my throat to give me the stomach-ache."</p>
<p>There was a high red cliff, about 10 m. N. of our bivouac,
that promised water on the summit, and salt feed on the plains at
its base. I pointed this out to Souper, telling him I was going
there, and Mr. Whitfield was to meet me with the party at that
place. I then wrote a letter to Mr. Whitfield, directing him to
proceed next day to the grassy flat I pointed out to Mr. Fraser,
come here and water the horses the following morning, and push on
to meet me at the cliff I have just mentioned, and sent Souper
with it, and a piece of the kangaroo, to the camp, where he
arrived that night.</p>
<p>Taking Narryer with me, I pushed on over stony plains, covered
with scrub, on which red kangaroos were numerous and very
wild&mdash;so much so that they were startled by a twig breaking
a quarter of a mile from them, and started immediately,
travelling a mile or so without stopping, jumping very low, and
bending more forward than the common species, which their fat
heavy tail enables and obliges them to do. Five miles on our
course we struck the dry bed of a brook trending to the eastward,
and shedding into the marshes at the base of Mount Magnet,
flowing to the S.W. As it was late when we started I bivouacked
here, and found feed and water in the bed of the stream, where I
shot and preserved a parrot, with brilliant green, scarlet, and
orange plumage, smaller than the <i>icterotis</i>, which Mr.
Sanford&mdash;to whom I am greatly indebted for his kindness in
classifying and preserving my specimens, and affording me an
opportunity of referring to his valuable works on Natural
History&mdash;has called <i>platycereus</i>. Travelling over
plains of red loam, wooded with acacia, and covered with quartz
stones in many places, for about 4 m., we reached the salt-bush
plain at the foot of the cliff, and proceeding to the cliff I
ascended the summit, and found several small water-holes in the
rocks, but not containing sufficient water for the horses that
were to be moved here, so I pushed on immediately to another
cliff 5 m. N.W. by W., unfortunately with the same result, and
halted there. These cliffs were composed of felspar and
quartz-grit, capped by stratified quartz and red sandstone,
clothed with acacia, while the surrounding plains were scrubby
and stony.</p>
<p>The next morning I pushed back to intercept the party, but
they had muffled the horse-bells to get near the kangaroos, so I
passed them in the thicket and struck the track behind them.
Following them up till dark, and renewing the chase when the moon
rose, we came up with them at two o'clock the following morning
at the cliff, where they had encamped and the horses found more
water, so that there was sufficient for them. All hands were on
the alert, and welcomed our arrival with a hearty cheer. When we
had breakfasted the day was dawning, and, directing Mr. Whitfield
and Edwards to accompany me with two days' rations, I led them to
the summit of a cliff 3 m. N., whence the rocky summit of a great
wave in the country bore N. by E., apparently 13 m. off, to which
I sent them to reconnoitre for water and feed, with instructions
to signalize by smoky fires, to show their position, at 4 h. 30
m. <span class="a">p.m.</span> that day, and at 8 <span class=
"a">a.m.</span> the following morning. I then returned to camp,
and posted Mr. Guerin on the cliff to look out. Narryer, though
very stanch, was quite knocked up. We had been two days without
any other food than half a rat each, being one that he had killed
while we were separated hunting for water&mdash;devouring his
portion immediately, and saving me the largest share, though I
had the advantage of him in starting on a good meal of kangaroo.
I found the position of this camp S. lat. 28° 00' 45"; E. long.
118° 20'; and 1582 ft. above the level of the sea. In the
afternoon I went with my telescope to watch for Mr. Whitfield's
signals, but saw none.</p>
<p>The following morning (the 12th), while the horses were
collected to start, I sent Mr. Guerin on to the cliff to watch
for the signal fires at the appointed time; he saw none, and
returned to camp at 10 h. <span class="a">a.m.</span>, reporting
to that effect. Three of the horses strayed away, and were not
brought in till after noon. This, and the uncertainty of feed and
water ahead, coupled with the water-holes at the camp being dry,
compelled me to send Messrs. Fraser and Brown, with two men and
the horses, to the stream-bed six miles back, with orders to turn
them out there and bring them back early in the morning. In
pursuance of this plan the horses were all in and loaded up early
next morning, when we started, steering N. about 5 m. to clear
the cliffs and rugged stony ground beyond, and then directing our
steps on a course N.N.E. to strike the point to which I had sent
Mr. Whitfield, travelling through densely wooded country, on red
loam and brown gravelly soil, stony in places, with fragments, 6
inch, cube, of rounded, yellow quartzose rock, with a conchoidal
fracture; while the elevated land to which I had sent Mr.
Whitfield was of ironstone-gravel formation, and less densely
wooded. I halted there, and made casts with the natives to the
right and left, firing guns, without seeing or hearing anything
of him, and then pushed on about 4 m. further, when we halted,
without feed or water, as I did not like going on further without
these men, for whom guns were firing during the night. The horses
strayed back on the track 4 m., and two of them were reported to
have gone right off without hobbles.</p>
<p>While they were tracking up and getting the horses together, I
took Farmer and Narryer with me, and proceeded to some cliffs 8
m. to the north of the camp, thinking it probable Mr. Whitfield
had gone there and made signals, where they could not be seen,
especially as it was the only place that promised water in sight.
We saw traces of natives, and several small water-holes, but saw
no traces of the men. I then steered for a sheet of water or an
extensive salt lake, the shore of which was 5 m. E.S.E. from us,
trending N.W., and apparently falling to the westward, that might
have attracted them, and where we should certainly find their
tracks if they had visited the place. On reaching the lake I saw
no signs of my men or the water either, as the latter was the
delusive effect of refraction on the dry bed of the lake,
quaintly termed by Narryer "walk-away and tell-lie water", since
it kept receding and still deceitfully luring us on.</p>
<p>I then returned to camp, and, crossing our outward track,
observed the natives had been along it with dogs. When we reached
the camp Mr. Whitfield and Edwards were just coming in, having
been stopping at a water-hole 5 m. E.S.E. Mr. Whitfield reported
having only lighted one fire, on the second morning, as a signal,
when the smoke spread before it rose above the bushes; this
probably caused it to be unobserved; and that he had waited at
the water-hole till his provisions were exhausted, when he
proceeded to strike the track, picked up Turpin, one of the stray
horses, and followed us up. I determined to proceed to the water
he had found, with the horses, at once, as there was a patch of
grass close to it, and, leaving Buck, Edwards, Cant, and Narryer
in charge of the camp, we started over with them. After roaming
about in the scrubs four or five hours in the dark without Mr.
Whitfield having found the place, I halted the party till dawn
next morning, when he knew nothing of his whereabouts, and, as it
was becoming serious, I questioned him closely, and was thus
enabled to lead him on to the place, when he recognised it, and I
found it 3½ m. to the eastward of his course. It was most
providential that we did not reach the place in the night, as it
was full of poison, and he had not noticed it. Famished as our
horses then were, they would have eaten it eagerly, and I should
have lost them all. Here I halted two days to rest the horses,
herding them during the day, and posting a watch on the poison
during the night. Here Mr. Guerin, who was very frank, spoke to
me privately of the harassing duty and hard work caused by the
horses being too much for him, that he feared he should not be
able to hold out much longer, and that he thought we should be
better off if we had no horses, and each man carried his own
provisions. I have said that he was frank; his quiet statement
saved the lives of the party, for when I was thus enlightened, I
saw that several other men were under the same fatal delusion,
based upon a faint heart and lazy disposition, and I was
consequently most watchful and strict to prevent accidents, till
they were in a more healthy frame of mind.</p>
<p>I was anxious to recover the other horse that had strayed
away, and on the 16th sent Farmer, Narryer, and Souper, with six
days' rations, after him, instructing them to persevere three
days on his track if necessary, but no longer, and then return,
with or without him, as speedily as possible, striking across to
a high hill 15 m. N.W., on the north side of which I determined
to pass, and halt at the first suitable place near it.</p>
<p>The following day we resumed our journey towards the hill, and
travelled 12 m. <i>en route</i>, over tolerably level, stony
country, wooded like the country before described, halting at
some granite rocks, where we found feed but not sufficient water
for the horses. Next morning, after traversing 3 m. of level,
open acacia plains on red sandy soil, we struck the S.W. extreme
of an arm of the great salt lake, over which we passed to the
base of the hill to which we had been steering. Here I halted the
party, among quartz veins and trap rocks, forming rugged and
terrible country for horses, while I ascended the hill to make a
reconnoissance. Scrambling over walls of quartz and hornblende
schist at the bottom, and over brown mica slate, forming the hill
itself, I reached the summit. Here I obtained a commanding view
of the great salt lake, extending N. and E. to the verge of the
horizon, falling to the N.W. and dry, though there was the same
appearance of water that had before misled us. To the S.W. an
extensive high range of trap hills, similar to Mount Magnet, rose
from the plains, covered with scrub and stones around it, 15 m.
off, to which, for distinction, I gave the name of West Mount
Magnet. Midway on the plain, and a little more to the southward,
red hills and cliffs formed rugged scrubby country, fronted by
red sand downs, tolerably open; while 10 m. N., two rounded
hills, apparently of the same formation (mica slate) as the hill
on which I stood, were connected by a lofty ridge, forming a
promontory on the western shore of the lake. Mica slate and
trap-hills, blended with quartz veins and hornblende schist,
extended 5 m. from the base of this hill towards the N. and W.,
presenting rugged, scrubby, undulating country, with valleys
strewed with the fragments of those rocks. The most promising
places for water were some ravines N.N.W. 3 m., and some cliffs 4
m. to the westward. I therefore rejoined the party and proceeded
with them to the N.W., winding through the rugged country in
search of water without success, and debouching upon a level
plain of hard, red loam, lightly wooded with acacia, I saw a hill
to the westward, for which we steered; and, travelling 7 m. on
this course, about 2 m. from the hill we struck the dry bed of a
large brook-course, trending to the N.E., and shedding into the
great lake.</p>
<p>As several of the horses were knocked up, and some of the
loads left a mile back, I halted hereto send two of the strongest
horses for the loads, while the stragglers were collected, and,
sending Messrs. Whitfield, Cant, and Brown down the brook in
search of water and feed, I ascended it alone for the same
purpose The brook-bed was deep, on a red sandstone bottom,
through which trap and granite cropped in many places. About 2 m.
up, another rocky dry bed of a stream, coming from the westward,
joined, and there was a grassy flat at the junction surrounded by
acacia thickets, covered with large quartz stones. Having found
feed, I then struck over the hills to the N. hunting for water.
These hills were very rugged, presenting purple, micaceous
schist, rising in a dislocated red conglomerate, resting on
felspar grit cliffs, in which there were large caves roofed by
the red conglomerate that had been recently inhabited by the
natives. While examining one of these caves I saw a fly come out
of a hole in the side, that the natives had placed a stone over,
containing about a quart of water, and this was all I could
find.</p>
<p>Returning to the camp, I passed over quartz and iron stones
that strewed the plain round these hills, and observed a new
shrub or bush about 6 ft. high, with a beautiful flower,
consisting of a purple, bell drooping from a red and white
star-shaped calyx. My friend Mr. Drummond has kindly promised to
classify this and other botanical specimens worthy of notice that
I have procured.</p>
<p>Mr. Whitfield reported that he had followed the brook down
about 2 m., when it spread over a plain with some perished grass
on it, and that he had not found any water. Fortunately we had
carried some, and I issued a pint to each man for supper,
bivouacked there, and led the horses up the brook to the patch of
grass I had found. The next morning the horses were scattered and
roaming in every direction, searching for water&mdash;two of
them, which were nearly dying, being the only horses on the flat,
and we had great work to get them together; but in doing so,
Messrs. Eraser and Cant, whom I took with me to a promising cliff
6 m. S.W., found a spring of water and a beautiful patch of
grass. I never saw a man more pleased than Mr. Eraser was on that
occasion; he was quite beside himself with joy, and heavily
loaded signal guns immediately communicated the cheering
intelligence to Messrs. Whitfield and Brown, who had been most
indefatigable in tracking up and collecting the horses in this
difficult, stony, and scrubby country. Leaving these gentlemen in
charge there of the horses they had found, I took Mr. Fraser and
Cant over the plain for those we had collected, with instructions
to untie two of them and bring them into camp to be loaded with
the water-bottles and kegs for a supply of water for the men in
charge of the baggage, while I pushed on to them as fast as
possible to make the necessary arrangements to prevent delay, as
two or three of the horses were dying from weakness and thirst.
In passing rapidly through the flat I found one horse down, and
another dead; and, hastening to the camp, I procured what we
wanted, left Mr. Guerin and Edwards in charge there, and pushed
over with the horses to the spring, where we turned them out to
feed. I then filled the water-bottles, and loading Postmaster
with them, took a supply of water to the men at the camp, and
returned to the spring in the evening. This spring was in the
sandy bed of a cave, under a felspar and quartz grit cliff, and
on the north side of this cave there were perfect representations
of seven left hands of natives of the ordinary size, with one
large right hand above and to the left of them; five couples of
red kangaroos' feet, and three emus' feet of the natural
size&mdash;having the appearance of impressions made by these
hands and feet previously dipped in some acid fluid that had
corroded and discoloured the rock; and several rude imitations of
the emus' and kangaroos' feet had been recently carved beneath
them, by chipping the rock with a piece of hard stone, probably
quartz, as I found a sharp fragment of that rock suited for the
purpose in the cave. I called this place the Carved Cave Spring,
and found by observations it was in S. lat. 27° 43' 13", E. long.
118°.</p>
<p>The following morning, soon after dawn, a native woman and
child were seen about a hundred yards from the spring, coming
towards it from the southward, and they fled when they saw us
there. The child's foot was very small, and they ran off in a
S.W. direction. Shortly after this occurrence I moved over with
the men and horses to fetch the loads from the camp, and have all
together at the spring. I was hurrying on in advance of the
party, and near the camp, when one double shot after another
announced there was something wrong there; and, in a few minutes
after I had answered these signals, Mr. Guerin came running
towards me and reported that Charles Farmer had shot himself. I
found the poor lad stretched between the loads under the shade of
a horse-rug; the horse I had sent him after stood by his side,
and the natives, silent and sorrowful, were sitting at his feet.
It was a saddening sight, they looked so wan and altered.
Farmer's right arm was shattered by a gun-shot wound received
above the wrist, and extending along the muscles towards the
elbow, where the charge of No. 4 shot had lodged, and apparently
injured the joint under the following circumstances, as narrated
by himself to me:&mdash;</p>
<p>While they were returning with the horse, Narryer, on the
19th, shot a red kangaroo, and Farmer laid his gun down in a bush
while he skinned and fastened the hind-quarters on the horse;
this done, he laid hold of his gun by the muzzle to throw it over
his shoulder, when the hammer caught in a branch, and discharged
the contents of the left-hand barrel in his right arm. They had
been travelling two days since this occurrence without any other
water than the small quantity they were fortunately carrying at
the time, which the natives had given him the whole of, though
they themselves had been reduced to the utmost extremity by
thirst, and the poor horse had been three days without water.</p>
<p>His arm was much swollen, so I washed it with tepid water and
put on a large poultice of linseed and oil to reduce the
swelling. After I had dressed his arm the poor fellow was very
cheerful, said he expected it would soon be well again, and
marched quite strong to the spring, where, with great difficulty,
I succeeded in getting all the men, horses, and equipment in the
evening; but the horses would not feed after they had eaten what
little green grass there was on the soakage of the spring, as the
dry, dusty grass and salt feed was then distasteful to them, and
several of them were so determined in their efforts to get at the
green poison-bushes that grew among the rocks, that I was
compelled to post a man there to keep them off during the
night.</p>
<p>The following morning we resumed our march on a W.N.W. course
towards the S. end of a distant high range, extending 10 m. in a
N.N.E. direction, with a view to making northing along its
water-shed. Travelling 13 m. over stony plains and acacia
thickets on red and brown loam, we halted at dark on a patch of
dry grass, though there was no water there, in consequence of
Farmer's wound rendering it impossible to push through such a
densely wooded country during the night; and two of the horses
having sunk under their loads two miles back, I sent Mr. Brown
with a horse to bring on their loads, while I pushed ahead three
miles, reconnoitring for feed and water.</p>
<p>I saw a promising cliff about 5 m. beyond, on our course,
which was cheering for the morrow, but too far off to move my
jaded horses that night; so I kept them tied up till dawn, when
we pushed on, leaving two behind in a dying state; but our march
was slow and harassing, from four more horses beginning to fail
when we started, and finally falling with their loads after
travelling about 3 m.; and while I halted the party to unload and
get these horses up again, the rest of the horses lay down. I
then took the loads off the weak horses, and left them and poor
Farmer in charge of Messrs. Whitfield and Guerin, having
anticipated and carried bread and water for such an emergency,
and pushed on with the horses and the rest of the men, still
travelling very slow, to the cliff 3 m. off, which we reached in
two hours, and turned the horses out to feed on the salt bush
flat at its base, while all but two men, whom I left in charge of
the loads, ascended the cliff to search for water. The instant we
reached the summit I found a basin containing several gallons on
an overhanging rock, and called all the men up to drink before
they separated, with strict orders to meet them again in two
hours. When we mustered Cant reported having found a hole
containing about eight gallons of water on the top of the cliff a
mile N.; while I had found a native well about 2 m. S., that I
hoped we should obtain water from by opening it, as the ground
was moist to the depth of my ramrod. As the horses were feeding I
now determined to remain here till sunset, and if in the mean
time we could not find feed and water, to push on during the
night to the hill, and send Cant to reinforce Mr. Whitfield's
party, and inform them of the water-hole he had found. However,
that no chance might be lost, especially as I knew that no one
was so capable of cheering and getting Farmer round as myself,
though Mr. Guerin was very kind and attentive to him, I sent the
natives out to examine carefully some broken country I had seen
to the southward, and taking Mr. Brown and Edwards with me,
opened the well, but as we got down the bottom became more dry,
presenting gravel and pipe-clay resting on granite breccia, and
indications like many other places visited, where I should have
washed for gold had water been procurable, the want of which
induced me to consider how much more precious that element was
than the metal it thus assists us to discover. Here Mr. Brown
shot a fine specimen, the first I had seen, of the crested pigeon
of the marshes described by Captain Sturt, and a beautiful ground
parrot (<i>pezoporus formosus</i>), both of which I
preserved.</p>
<p>At 7 <span class="a">p.m.</span> Narryer and Souper returned,
reporting they had found plenty of water in, and a spring among,
some granite rocks 4 m. S., that were surrounded by belts of
green grass with poison growing in it, and that they had seen two
natives on the way constructing a fence in a ravine at the base
of a cliff about 2 m. to the westward, to whom they had shouted
and made friendly signs to induce them to point out water, but
who ran away immediately, and when they were pursued, separated;
so that Narryer ran after one and Son per the other. Narryer said
he pressed his man so close that he jumped into a thicket and
climbed a bush; that while he was there he endeavoured by signs
and words to assure him of his friendly disposition and want of
water; but the man was so enraged he could not pacify him, and
that he threw some filth in his (Narryer's) face and jumped out
to attack him, when he (Narryer) fired and the man fell,
apparently lifeless. I deeply regretted, and still regret, this
occurrence&mdash;an occurrence, if blameable, the blame of which
attaches to myself for sending these men away; but we were
necessarily separated and struggling for our lives; and had blood
been shed, or even death ensued on this occasion, instead of the
man having, as I have every reason to believe, fallen from the
fear of death, since no traces of blood could be found, nor other
trace of the man than his firm track leading at a running pace
from the spot, I should have found consolation, as I do now, in
the reflection that it was unavoidable and fair fighting. Though,
to prevent a recurrence of anything of this kind, I severely
censured my men for pursuing these natives, and thus provoking
hostilities under circumstances that would have rendered a white
man highly culpable; but not without making due allowance for
their weaker judgment, and the fact of their having reported the
occurrence to me under a firm conviction that they had done their
duty.</p>
<p>As it was not safe to travel during the night after this
affair, I set the watch an hour a man, and waited till dawn, when
I moved with the party to the place Narryer had found, and was
very glad to reach such an excellent spot to recruit my horses,
which I turned out a short time to feed; and, selecting the
strongest, loaded him with water, directing Mr. Brown to proceed,
in company with Narryer and Souper, to convey this supply to Mr.
Whitfield, to whom I wrote, directing him to send Farmer over
with Narryer, Souper, and the horse, and keep Mr. Brown and
Guerin there till the morrow, when I would send for them all and
the loads. I then had the horses herded on the plains while we
cleared the poison off the grass round the rocks and burnt it. In
the evening Farmer arrived with the natives, and his arm was
looking much better now the swelling was reduced, and suppuration
had commenced discharging the shot, eighteen of which were now
out I dressed his arm as before, and gave him a dose of castor
oil. We tethered all the horses on the grass we had cleared for
them, but several broke away in the night, and fed among, without
touching the poison; so, as these horses were more full and doing
better than the rest, I turned the others loose and watched them,
with the intention of tying them up again if they attempted to
eat the poison. Fortunately they ate the grass only; and I
subsequently found they never would touch the poison-plant if it
were surrounded by other green herbage.</p>
<p>In the morning as arranged, I sent Edwards, with three of the
strongest horses, accompanied by Narryer and Souper leading one,
loaded with two large water-bottles, instructing them to proceed
together to Mr. Whitfield's party.</p>
<p>The following day, I examined all the horses, made good their
shoes, and dressed the backs of several&mdash;chiefly the
withers, which our saddles began to press, now the poor animals
were thin. After this, all hands were busily employed repairing
boots, except Narryer and Souper, whom I sent out to shoot a mess
for Farmer, who at 8 <span class="a">a.m.</span> (26th Sept.)
complained of sore-throat, difficulty in swallowing, and pain
across his stomach. His arm, however, looked much better, and
several more shot came out. I gave him a dose of castor oil at 9
<span class="a">a.m.</span> At noon, stiffness in the jaw alarmed
the poor boy, and made him apprehensive that lock-jaw was coming
on. This unfortunately was the case; but I told him perhaps he
had caught cold, and rubbed his throat with liniment. Towards
evening, he could scarcely open his mouth wide enough to admit
the point of a spoon. I then bled him, taking a pint of very
black blood from his left arm, and gave him ten grains of
calomel. During the night he was in great agony, caused by
violent pains in his stomach, that made him draw up his limbs, in
convulsive fits, on several occasions so hard that he carried
away the tent that was over him. I put a large horse blister on
his stomach, but in his struggles it was rubbed off before it
took effect; so, to give him immediate relief, I applied
flannels, dipped in hot water; that he said eased him a little;
but, at dawn, I saw there were no hopes of his recovery, and
spoke soothingly to him of his approaching dissolution; when he
spoke calmly and sensibly to me about his affairs, and added his
sufferings were so great, that he was glad to hear that his death
was, thank God, about to release him from them. Leaving him to
the particular care of Mr. Guerin and Buck, though all the party
were anxious and ready during the night to do anything they could
to alleviate his sufferings, I directed Mr. Whitfield, in company
with Cant and Souper, to proceed with a day and a half's rations,
and explore the high hills 10 m. N.W., for our next bivouac, and
return the following afternoon; and sent Mr. Brown, with Narryer,
to find feed in the neighbourhood, if possible, better than the
horses were in, as I feared, now this place was eaten off, they
would soon Commence eating the poison. When I returned to
Farmer's side, he told me he had four horses and some
money&mdash;that he wished his "brother Thomas to have the
horses, and the money to be divided equally between his other
brothers and sisters. I wrote a paper to this effect, and read
each sentence to him as I wrote it, in the presence of the men,
and he approved of what I had written. But, while I was writing
the concluding lines, "in witness thereof I have signed my hand,"
&amp;c., he was seized with violent pains, and became insensible,
or rather delirious, calling out for his brother Thomas, till he
fainted away. He then lay apparently dead for a few minutes, then
rallied&mdash;still delirious, and in great agony&mdash;for about
twenty minutes, when he fainted again, and died at twenty-five
minutes past two o'clock on the afternoon of the 27th Sept. As
the poor boy could not sign his will, I obtained the signatures
of those men to it who were present when he made and approved of
it. We then selected a nice spot for his grave on the summit of
the hill, close to the camp, shaded by a beautiful drooping
wattle-tree, but we reached the solid rock at 2 ft. down, and
were obliged to dig it lower down the hill, 20 yards from the
left bank of the brook, 80 yards from the spring, and 1896 ft.
above the level of the sea, being the highest plain visited, in
S. lat. 27° 41' 18", E. long, 117° 42'; where we buried him at
sunset, sewn up in his blanket, with his saddle for a pillow, on
to which we lowered him gently in a horse-rug. I read the
beautiful service of our Church for the burial of the dead over
him, after which we fired our guns, and retired in silence. I
never saw men so strangely affected; not a tear was shed, but
every man's voice was low and tremulous, and sounded hollow and
unearthly all that night.</p>
<p>The following morning Mr. Fraser was attacked with dysentery,
and I attributed his illness to anxiety and the desponding frame
of mind unfortunately common to all the party, excepting Mr.
Brown and Edwards, about this time. I therefore pushed off with
the horses and all the men, but Mr. Fraser and Buck, whom I left
in charge, with plenty of light work to keep their minds
employed, and bivouacked on a nice patch of feed with water, that
Mr. Brown found yesterday, 5 m. to the southward, around another
patch of granite rocks, the intervening country being very
scrubby and stony. In the afternoon Mr. Whitfield and his party
returned to camp; where I arrived the next morning with Mr.
Guerin, whom I sent back to the horse-party with a day's rations,
and orders for them to bring the horses into camp next morning.
Mr. Whitfield reported that he had found water and grass 15 m.
N.N.W., on the W. side of the high hills to which I had sent him,
and that I subsequently called Mount Farmer. After breakfast we
carried some stones from the adjacent granite rocks, and placed
them round and over poor Farmer's grave, with a slab at his head,
on which, with a chisel and tomahawk, I carved "C. Farmer,
1854."</p>
<p>I then examined our stores and weighed all the provisions,
namely, 568 lbs. of flour, 24 lbs. of pork, 12½ lbs. of sugar,
20¼ lbs. of tea, and 16 lbs. of tobacco; equal to 50 days'
rations of flour, 5 of pork, 44 of tea, 5 of sugar, and 85 of
tobacco, after issuing to the 1st October inclusive. Joker, a
fine young horse, died from fatigue that morning, and Sinbad, Mr.
Whitfield's horse, was so weak as to be unable to carry a load.
Having only 11 other horses, several of which were very weak, it
was necessary to dispense with all we possibly could to reduce
our baggage, and consequently I set aside the spare saddlery, the
boxes in which specimens were stowed, all the geological
specimens that I could correctly describe, and 20 lbs. of
powder&mdash;burying the latter at the foot of Farmer's grave,
and stowing all the specimens in the apparatus for evaporating
salt water. We then arranged the loads in proportion to the
relative strength of the horses, and towards evening we had
everything in readiness to put on their backs. Soon after dawn
the next morning (30th), the horses were brought in, and we
resumed our journey from Farmer's grave towards the hills I had
named after him, steering N.N.W., through acacia thickets, on
yellow sandy land, covered with ironstone gravel, to a granite
hill 10 m. distant, situated between the southern range, Mount
Charles, and the more elevated northern hills of Mount Farmer. I
ascended this granite hill, which was dislocated and wooded, and
as the party wound round the N. side, halted them, and called up
Mr. Whitfield and Souper, to point out the place they had found,
that I might get the bearing and distance, to prevent the spot
being missed, in the event of our being benighted. Marching
thence on the same course, over plains covered with ironstone,
densely wooded, and intersected by several dry streamlet beds
trending towards the W., from the W. side of the Mount, after
travelling 2 m., we struck a patch of granite rocks, with more
than sufficient water on them for our horses, whence, while
watering, Souper saw the place we were steering for, about 4 m.
off. As the horses, after this timely refreshment, were able to
reach the feed before dark, and I was particularly anxious to
obtain a round of angles from the summit of Mount Farmer, I sent
Mr. Whitfield on with the party, instructing him to tie up the
horses till I joined him, and then pushed off to the top of the
hill, where I arrived a few minutes only before sunset, and
obtained a view of the surrounding country that amply compensated
for the hard run Narryer and myself had to reach it in time for
my work. From E., round by N., to S.W. on a radius of 20 m., the
country presented stony plains, covered with scrub, studded with
trap hills to the westward, and granite rocks from E. to N.W.,
like the bold hills on the Dale River, and bounded on the N.E. by
the western shore of the great salt lake, in which a distant blue
peak loomed like a granite hill, apparently 40 m. distant,
bearing N.N.E. or in a line with the Mount Farmer range,
extending about 3 m. in that direction, from the summit, which is
about the centre of this group of hills, and 380 ft. high. Here I
observed great local magnetic attraction in the trap rock of
which these hills are composed, which is a close-grained green
and white rock&mdash;green predominating, like clink stone, with
a conchoidal fracture. The country that intervened between Mount
Farmer and the camp, 5 m. W.N.W., presented a rocky thicket,
covered with sharp quartz and ironstone round the foot of the
hills, changing to brown gravelly and sandy soil, wooded with
acacia, extending to the granite rocks, where I found my party
bivouacked at 8 <span class="a">p.m.</span> on a nice patch of
grass, 1726 ft. above the sea.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 256}</u></p>
<h4><a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>[October, 1854]</h4>
<p><em>October</em> 1<em>st</em>.&mdash;The next morning we
steered W.N.W., and marched 5 m. over stony plains, wooded with
acacia and studded with small granite rocks,when we encountered a
patch of densely wooded ironstone country, from the summit of
which I saw a large bare granite hill, bearing N.W. by W.
apparently 12 m. off, to which, as the intervening country was
more favourable, I proceeded, over red loamy land, affording
better travelling than I anticipated, and presenting acacia and
salt bush plains drained by watercourses, then dry, trending
S.W., and that had cut down to the red sandstone rock which
formed the substratum of these plains. The base of the granite
hill was very rugged and stony, but we found a patch of grass and
a fine water-hole on the S.E. side, where we encamped for the
night. Among the huge blocks of granite on the eastern side, the
"mourarungs" or rock kangaroos were very numerous, and several of
these animals were shot. On the plains to the westward, many red
kangaroos were seen, but they were very wild, and we could not
get near enough to them for a sure shot, though several were
badly wounded. Here also we shot several "budgeragar" or shell
parrots (<i>melopsittacus undulatus</i>), and four small finches
resembling, but smaller than Java sparrows. After this date, the
latter birds were always found at the water-holes, and frequently
by their chirping attracted us to water, that but for them would
have been passed unnoticed when the men and horses were suffering
from thirst. From the summit of this hill I observed a peaked
hill apparently 35 m. off, looming blue and smoky like granite,
and the country <i>en route</i> N.W. ½ N. looked more promising,
as bare granite rocks jutted out on the intervening plains, and
the sandstones had been swept off a vast area, over which not a
cliff could be seen in that direction.</p>
<p>Travelling towards this peak next day, to a granite rock 10 m.
<i>en route</i>, we passed through 4 m. of rugged country,
presenting conical hills of quartz and ironstone, rising to the
height of 200 ft. from plains strewed with mica, hornblende, and
quartz schist, and wooded with acacia, whence we emerged on open
acacia and salt bush plains, extending to our bivouac in S. Tat.
27° 15' 23", E. long. 117° 10'. Here I was rather anxious about
my two natives whom I had sent to shoot kangaroos, as we were
getting short of meat, with instructions to work till the close
of the day if they were unsuccessful, and then join us in the
evening, and who were absent all night, in consequence of my
speaking very positively to them under the impression that a
superstitious feeling had deterred them from killing these
animals since poor Farmer's accident.</p>
<p>We made a short journey of 7 m. the next day to a group of
bare granite hills to the westward, travelling over 3 m. of
undulating rocky country and then entering a plain intersected by
two dry brook courses, on which some natives had recently
bivouacked, and the bed of a river, 110 yards wide, trending to
the northward, with a sharp gravelly bottom in the channels and
sand hummocks between them, on which clumps of black wattles were
growing luxuriantly. Narryer and Souper joined us in the
afternoon, reporting that the river we had just crossed flowed
into another 8 m. N., that came from the N.E. and was trending
S.W.; and that they had found a spring 2 m. N. of our last
bivouac, where the natives had constructed an ambush so as to lay
hold of the emus' and kangaroos' legs when they were watering.
They also mentioned a curious mark on a bare granite rock,
consisting of four large stones laid in the form of a cross
around the base of a vertical stone like a boundary mark. The
following morning (4th Oct.) we resumed our march, steering N. by
W. towards the distant peak. The country for 4 m. presented
granite hills and rocky valleys wooded with acacia, and affording
a little green grass round the rocks. We then entered a level,
open country covered with angular quartz stones, extending 2 m.
on our course, and terminating in a belt of sandy loam stretching
along the left bank of the river Narryer had described, and that
we struck after travelling about 8 m. and crossing three dry
brook courses falling into it. This river bed was dry, 70 yards
wide from bank to bank, with small sharp quartz and granite
gravel in channels, 30 ft. deep, trending S.W. and apparently
falling into the Murchison, as a belt of casuarina trees fringed
its tortuous course on the plains towards that river. A small and
beautiful painted quail rose from the stony plain, and several
crested pigeons were flushed in the acacia scrub on the sandy
land; while from the many tracks of emus and kangaroos, these
animals must have been very numerous. Crossing this river and
travelling on the same course over granite country, wooded with
acacia and presenting undulating brown gravelly land for about 8
m., we struck another dry bed of a river trending W.S.W., the
same breadth and 21 ft. deep, cut through the red sandstone to
the granite rocks that formed a waterfall with three springs at
the base where we struck it, and encamped in S. lat. 27° 2' 43",
E. long. 116° 58', 1584 ft. above the sea.</p>
<p>We found the traces of a large body of natives having
bivouacked here about three months before us, and feasted on
kangaroos. Their fires were ranged in a circle, about a bundle of
grass like a wheat-sheaf, that they had left behind. The springs
were bushed round, and pits sunk within the enclosures, in which
they had secreted themselves to spear animals when they drank at
the springs. This was the first place at which I had seen any
indications of a large number of natives having been collected
during the last three years, and I thought it encouraging,
especially as the country ahead was improving. I named this river
the "Sanford", after, and in compliment to W. H. Sanford, Esq.,
our respected Colonial Secretary, and pushed on to the peak next
morning, over 6 m. of undulating granite country.</p>
<p>Halting the party at the base of the peak, I selected Mr.
Guerin to accompany me and ascended to the summit of this bare
granite rock 240 ft. above the plain, whence I could see many
miles&mdash;at least 40&mdash;in every direction. I named this
hill Mount Luke, after my friend Mr. Luke Leake, of Perth. It was
surrounded apparently by a vast wooded plain, studded with bare
granite hills and bounded on the N.W. by a high range about 50 m.
distant, the summit of which bore N.W. by N.; but when I
descended and advanced with the party towards this high range, I
found the intervening country for many miles very rocky and
uneven, and intersected by several brooks, trending to the
westward, with grassy banks and beds. The country was so much
better than we had been traversing before, though still very
indifferent, that we obtained grass and water every night, and 25
m. on our course, in S. lat. 26° 38', E. long. 116° 40, 1199 ft.
above the sea, we crossed three large and deep river-beds,
"perfectly dry, trending S.W., and spreading over plains
tributary to the Murchison. There were white gum-trees growing
along the banks of these rivers, the first we had seen since
leaving Toodyay, and many of them of a large size.</p>
<p>On the 8th we encamped on the W. side of the high range for
which we had been steering, in S. lat. 26° 24' 58", E. long. 116°
28', in the plain intervening between the base of the range and
the Murchison River. We halted here a day, and called the highest
summit of the range Mount Murchison, which is about 400 ft. above
the plain, and of greenstone trap formation, with a conchoidal
fracture, while granite rocks crop out round the base of the
range, and the sides of the hills are strewed with quartz stones.
Resuming our march on the 10th, and travelling 3 m. on a N.W. ½
N. course, over a plain 1069 ft. above the sea, we struck the
Murchison River, trending W.S.W., the bed of which was dry, 64
yards wide from bank to bank, with a main channel 36 yards wide,
cut down 33 ft. through the red sandstone rock, with coarse
yellow sand in the bed, on which several patches of samphire and
rushes were growing. White gum-trees of a large size, looking
very healthy, grew along the margin of the river, and stunted
trees of the same description were growing for half a mile on
each side, on clayey flats subject to flood, and covered with
small nodules of limestone.</p>
<p>Five miles beyond the river, we entered a patch of rocky
country, presenting red sandstone cliffs, and conical hills of
greenstone trap, through which we passed on to a white plain,
covered with quartz stones, and studded with red and white hills,
presenting small peaks of felspar and red sandstone. From the
highest of these peaks I obtained an extensive view. To the
eastward the country presented red sandstone cliffs and scrub for
at least 30 m.; and on each side of a group of trap hills, 10 m.
to the N.E., which I called Mount Narryer, the country was very
rugged, much dislocated, and very densely wooded. I therefore
held my course over undulating, broken country, strewn with
ironstone, quartz, and gneiss stones, and wooded with acacia, for
about 10 m. further, when I saw a white cliff, that promised
well, bearing N.W. by W., apparently 20 m. distant, for which I
steered, travelling over densely wooded, stony country, rising
towards it, and where we arrived at 10h. <span class=
"a">a.m.</span> on the 12th of October, in lat. 26° 7', long.
115° 58'.</p>
<p>The cliff we struck was the highest, and composed of white
sandstone with quartz pebbles imbedded, surrounded by a broad
belt of gneiss stones, along the eastern edge of which, a
watershed without a channel, wooded with white gum-trees, and
strewed with nodules of limestone, trended to the southward.
Another long cliff extending to the S.W., composed of white rock
like chalk, with quartz pebbles imbedded, was surrounded by
gneiss and quartz stones, on undulating scrubby country. A little
in advance, and trending N.E., a range of gneiss hills, much
dislocated, presented rocky scrubby country, destitute of water,
and intersected by two ridges of pale greenish white rock, the
one having angular pieces of quartz about 1½ in. cube imbedded,
and the other round pebbles about the same size, both seams
having the appearance of congealed concrete. There was no water
here, and this was the third day my horses had been without
water. The country to the N., N.W., and W., was gently
undulating, scrubby, and most unpromising. The only place in
sight that promised even a chance of water was a group of table
hills 25 m. S.; but my horses were too jaded to push on over the
rocky country that intervened; however, there was no time to
lose, so I determined to retreat to a native well 12 m. back,
where the water came in at the rate of three gallons an hour,
draw that well steadily, and open another. Accordingly we
returned to the well, and were up all night watering the horses.
At dawn we commenced sinking another well, but struck rock
everywhere at about seven feet; so, seeing there was no chance of
obtaining more water, I determined to draw the old well steadily
till midnight, and then travel during the night towards the table
cliffs 25 m. S.W. from here. At noon I sent Mr. Whitfield and
Souper on in advance, with instructions to explore around the
cliff for water, and to be prepared to lead us to it when we
arrived there with the horses, and thus save time, as I knew the
horses would be greatly distressed.</p>
<p>About 2 <span class="a">a.m.</span> on the 14th we resumed our
march, and the horses travelled very well till dawn, when we
entered a dense thicket of acacia and eucalypti, on loose, yellow
sand&mdash;the worst piece of country we had yet encountered,
extending 12 m. on our course. The sun shone out with peculiar
brightness and intense heat&mdash;the glare was intolerable; one
horse fell to the rear, and I directed Cant, who was leading him,
to let the old horse take his time, and sent Narryer back to keep
him company. About noon we struck a patch of broken, undulating
land, covered with quartz and gneiss rocks, and much more open,
about half-way; whence a large smoke, that Mr. Whitfield had made
in advance, could be seen. In about two hours I was near the
smoke, and fired a signal gun, which was answered by Mr.
Whitfield; and the party pushed on with revived spirits. As we
approached the smoke could be distinctly seen, rising from
beneath a large green tree, so healthy-looking, that we fully
expected to find a fine spring there; but, to my great surprise,
Mr. Whitfield reported there was no water, and that he had been
waiting under this tree since nine o'clock in the morning, as it
was so hot that he was afraid to push on to the cliff and execute
his orders. I was annoyed, but said nothing to show it; and told
Mr. Whitfield, as it was now cool, he could resume his march, and
that it was of the utmost importance his orders relative to the
cliff should be executed. There was only one man in advance when
I came up with Mr. Whitfield, and seeing the effect the
disappointment had on him, I determined to push on, if possible,
without its being communicated to the rest of the party.</p>
<p>After travelling about 3 m. through a rocky thicket, I saw the
fresh track of a native. I knew on such a day he would not travel
far without water. The country was so stony it was some time
before I found another footprint&mdash;night was coming
on&mdash;four more horses were down, and when I halted the rest
to prevent their running over the track, several rocked to and
fro, and sunk under their loads. I had the loads taken off those
horses; and, having taken the direction the native's tracks led,
we pushed on again, and, just as the sun went down, I struck a
path which, providentially, led me to a beautiful well of water,
in a bare ironstone plain, that no one would ever have expected
to find water on. Had we missed this well, not a horse would have
been saved. Mr. Whitfield came in a few minutes afterwards,
without having visited the cliff, apparently perfectly ignorant
of the importance of the duty I had intrusted to him, and
prostrated by anxiety.</p>
<p>Although we had every reason to rejoice and be thankful for
this timely supply of water, I felt anxious about the two men
that were absent with the four horses that had been left behind
between three and six miles. These horses belonged to Messrs.
Guerin and Fraser; so I selected those gentlemen to accompany me
at dawn next morning, carrying some bread and water for the men,
and to endeavour to save the horses. About 2 m. from the camp we
met Cant and Narryer coming in, driving one. They were more cut
up than I expected to find them, especially Cant, who had taken
fright at seeing the loads scattered about on the track, and who
reported that one horse was down 8 m. back, and that the other
horses that we were going after had strayed from the camp. I sent
Cant into camp with one, and gave him great credit for getting
the old horse on so far. Narryer volunteered, after he had eaten
a small piece of dry bread and drunk about a quart of water, to
accompany me after the horses. We spent the whole of the day
tracking them up, and driving them towards the camp, but they all
fell about 2 m. from it, and died there, after all our
trouble.</p>
<p>The next day I sent Messrs. Brown and Whitfield, with Edwards
and Cant, to feed the horses at the flat, with orders to return
with them the next afternoon. I then started with Narryer and
Souper, searching for feed and water round the cliff to the S.W.
I found the cliff was of gneiss formation, of great extent,
forming a rocky table-land, and surrounded by dislocated red and
yellow hard sandstones, in fine slabs. Among these rocks Souper
and myself fired at, and missed, two moderate-sized black
kangaroos. We saw several fresh tracks of natives, but could not
find either feed or water anywhere about these rocks.</p>
<p>At dawn the following morning I took Messrs. Fraser and
Guerin, and Narryer and Souper, out with me towards the S.E., and
found a patch of feed about 5 m. from the camp, in that
direction, and sent Messrs. Fraser and Guerin back with
instructions for Mr. Whitfield to move the party and horses on
there, after they were brought back in the afternoon. I then
pushed off to some granite rocks to the eastward, where I found a
spring and a small patch of good feed about 8 m. from the last
place I had instructed Mr. Whitfield to move to, and I now sent
Souper with a note to him, directing him to bring the party here
next day, and await further orders. There were many traces of the
natives having recently visited this place. At one fireplace I
found a large broken univalve shell, and on the flat top of a
large granite rock there were some rude carvings representing
either a boat or a fish and a harpoon. For distinction, I called
this place the Broken Shell Spring. The following morning,
Narryer accompanied me towards a high, bare granite hill, 23 m.
S.E. Before the sun rose we had shot two red kangaroos, and left
them with our water-bottle in the fork of a bush, to which we
intended to return to supper.</p>
<p>After travelling 10 m. over tolerably open country, covered
with quartz stones in many places, we struck the Murchison River,
trending W., and 115 yards wide, at its junction with another dry
stream-bed coming from the N.W. The river here was very bold, in
one channel 30 ft. deep, with a bare gravelly and coarse sharp
sandy bottom, cut through the red sandstone that underlaid the
stony table-land on both sides, which, like the banks higher up,
appeared to be subject to occasional rushing floods. Descending
the river in search of fresh water, we found several large
shallow pools of brine, surrounded by a sheet of salt several
inches in thickness in many places, though in most it was about
an inch thick. We traced a native into and along the bed of the
river about a mile, when he struck off towards some broken
country about 5 m. to the southward. We spent several hours in an
unsuccessful search for fresh water. Though we dug in the most
promising places we invariably obtained salt water about 4 ft.
down. We saw the tracks of red kangaroos and emus where they had
been drinking or bathing in a pool as salt as brine, and
subsequently saw some brilliant parrots water there. There were
two of these birds, male and female I imagine, as one was
brilliant scarlet on the breast and neck, and dark green on the
back and wings; while the other was a beautiful rose colour on
the breast and neck, and pale green on the wings; and they came
and went in company. Thinking it probable that the man whose
tracks we had seen was travelling to some watering-place, I
struck off towards the rocks, 5 m. S., and reached there late at
night. The following morning we explored every place likely to
afford water, but could not find any. Another roasting day was
before us, and we had not tasted water or food since we left the
Broken-Shell Spring. But the feed certainly and possibly the
water also was exhausted there by this time, while there was
every probability of there being both feed and water at the
granite hill, which now bore E. 10 m. distant. To it therefore we
went over undulating scrubby country and through open salt-bush
plains, tributary to the Murchison, and arrived there an hour
after noon. Here we found water and grass, and shot a rock
kangaroo for breakfast. While we were resting a fine emu came to
the water-hole, but saw us and ran off before we could get a shot
at him. Tired as Narryer was, he bounded after this bird in an
instant, bow in hand, and was stealthily approaching almost
within shot, when another bird, that he had not observed, caught
sight of him and gave the alarm to its mate, with whom it fled
into the scrubs.</p>
<p>I saw with pleasure that my horses would gain strength at this
place, and called the hill "Mount Welcome". Knowing they were
starving, we started back at sunset, and reached the Broken-Shell
Spring at dawn next morning, after marching hard all night. I
found Mr. Whitfield with the party there all correct, cheered
them with the news of the good place we had found, and sent them
off there immediately, detaining Mr. Guerin to guard Narryer and
myself while we slept, and accompany us to join the party during
the night. But myriads of small black flies rendered sleep
impossible. I determined to lie quiet and get used to them;
however, I could not stand them; and when at last I opened my
mouth to denounce them, a cloud of the little wretches charged
down my throat and nearly choked me. Fortunately they retired at
sunset, when we slept a few hours, and thus refreshed, pushed on
early the next morning to join the party at Mount Welcome, where
I found all well, at 2 <span class="a">p.m.</span> on the 21st
October, in S. lat. 26° 44' 23", E. long. 116° 24'. I halted here
till the 25th, and sent Mr. Whitfield out with a party to explore
the broken country through which, under any circumstances, I
determined to push to the westward, to facilitate our progress.
While we were encamped here the weather was hot and sultry, with
light airs from the N.W., very cloudy, threatening a thunderstorm
every day, till towards night, when the wind veered to the
westward and the sky became clear till about 2 <span class=
"a">a.m.</span>, when a heavy bank came up from the N.W. and soon
spread in dense cumulus above us, but so low that the granite
hills that studded the plains attracted fleecy clouds from the
mass that produced a beautiful effect at sunset. My barometer was
unfortunately injured by the horse falling over a cliff with it
in his load, on the 14th, when it received a severe shake, and
the observations taken with it here are only of value as showing
a rise of .03 every evening when the cloudy canopy was
dissipated.</p>
<p>The mean temperature for this period was&mdash;8 <span class=
"a">a.m.</span>, 89°; 10 <span class="a">a.m.</span>, 104°; noon,
109°; 2 <span class="a">p.m.</span>, 110°; 6 <span class=
"a">p.m.</span>, 103°; 8 <span class="a">p.m.</span>, 91°, in the
shade of a blanket under a shady bush. The direct heat was, of
course, more intense, probably 120° at noon.</p>
<p>At 4 <span class="a">p.m.</span> on the 22nd Smuggler fell
backwards into the well, and so injured himself that he died on
the 24th. On the 23rd I examined and weighed all our provisions,
and issued rations for all hands up to the 28th inclusive. There
was a balance of 222 lbs. flour only, so I reduced the ration
from 1 lb. 2 oz. to 1 lb. per day, which, for the ten of us, gave
22 days' supply&mdash;or up to 19th November&mdash;there being a
loss or excess of consumption on unavoidable occasions of 30 lbs.
since we left Mount Farmer.</p>
<p>On the 24th, Messrs. Fraser and Brown, accompanied by Souper,
whom I had sent out the previous day with Mr. Whitfield, returned
to camp, reporting that they had found water 14 m. W. by N., and
a patch of good feed 4 m. south of it, and that Mr. Whitfield
would meet me at the water on the evening of the 25th, as
directed. The following morning (25th) we resumed our march
towards the Gascoigne, and travelled over open plains, shedding
the waters of the rivers we had crossed to the eastward into the
Murchison, for about 10 m., when we entered the rugged country of
sandstone, gneiss, and other schistose rocks, mingled with quartz
and ironstone, and densely wooded, round my bivouac of the 18th,
through which we pushed to the granite rock that afforded the
water-hole they had found. Here we halted, and after the horses
were watered and the men had dined, I sent them to the feed 4 m.
south, with orders to return here and pick up their loads early
in the morning. Mr. Whitfield, with Edwards and Narryer, returned
the next morning, reporting that the country he had traversed for
about 12 m. to the westward was rugged and destitute of water and
feed, and that he had not seen any place that would sustain our
horses for a night, while the Murchison River, where he crossed
it, 7 m. to the westward, presented a bold bed, saturated with
salt water, for a mile or two to the right and left of his
track.</p>
<p>Soon after Messrs. K. Brown, Guerin, Cant, and Souper came in
with the horses, looking well, and an old native they had found
near the Grass Mount, and who had pointed out a fine spring about
half a mile south of the feed. The old man was very thin, and
eagerly devoured what food we gave him. Unfortunately, we were
very hard up, and could not spare much. As Mr. Whitfield and his
party were very tired and had suffered a great deal from thirst,
so much so that Edwards gave up and Narryer had to carry water 10
m. for him, and Mr. Whitfield, who stayed with him, before they
had the courage to travel, I determined to move the party down to
Grass Mount, and water at the hole the native had pointed out,
and which, on our arrival, we called the Captive Spring, in
compliment to the poor old fellow whom I detained when he wished
to leave.</p>
<p>The next day (27th) we resumed our journey, taking the old man
with us, and steering N.W. by W. for the south end of the cliffs,
and the scrubby undulating country that crippled us on the 12th.
For 8 m. our course led over tolerably open acacia plains, on
which Narryer shot a fine red kangaroo. We then crossed the bed
of the Murchison, trending south, and divided into two large
channels, half a mile apart, in a salt-bush flat 3 m. wide,
covered with nodules of limestone, and apparently flooded at
times, while the margins of the channels were fringed with
she-oak and white gum-trees, similar to those before described.
Beyond the river the country became very stony, with gneiss and
quartz, in angular blocks, about 5 inches square, and densely
wooded with acacia.</p>
<p>Travelling about 9 m. over this wretched country, we succeeded
in reaching a water-hole, under a cliff, with a small patch of
grass near it, that was surrounded by a dense thicket, which we
should never have thought of penetrating but for the old man who
led us through it.* Here, in S. lat. 26° 40' 13", E. long. 115°
50', I was obliged to watch the old man very narrowly to prevent
his escape, as I took charge of him till after Aldebaran came on
the meridian, and the old fellow was very troublesome. I assured
him we were only going a few days' journey to the westward, and
that we would bring him back to his own country again and set him
at liberty. But as the language of each was unintelligible to the
other, I did this by signs; and, at two o'clock next morning,
called Mr. Guerin to watch him till dawn, when we started again,
steering N.W. through undulating yellow sand-hills, covered with
dense acacia scrub, separated by rocky, ironstone, and gneiss
plains, tolerably open, but still terribly hard for both men and
horses, as the stones were so loose and large we could not obtain
a firm footing.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Three specimens of a small rose-coloured
cockatoo, with slate-coloured body, about the size of a pigeon,
were shot and preserved here.]</p>
<p>After travelling about 12 m. over this kind of country, we
struck a samphire flat, at the foot of some rugged hills that
stretched across our course. As it was an awkward place to face
with weak and jaded horses, I halted a few minutes to breathe
them, and questioned the old man about the water ahead. He
pointed to the south-west, and gave me to understand there was
plenty of water and grass in that direction, but none on the
course I was steering, and that the natives never travelled
through the country I wanted to traverse, but always went either
to the south of it, or the north, where there was a great river
and plenty to eat and drink. His great wish appeared to be to
lead us back towards the Champion Bay country. He was becoming
sulky when I questioned him further, so I determined to hold my
course and trust in Providence, keeping a sharp look-out for
water. The country was the worst we had travelled for loose
stones and rugged hills, but we nevertheless accomplished 13
miles more, and reached a ravine of brown micaceous, primary
slate presenting huge flights of steps and extensive platforms,
exceedingly difficult for the horses to descend. I had to grope
my way through this frightful place in the dark, as it was so
confined and difficult, that the night closed over us before we
could extricate ourselves. Repeatedly the horses took leaps and
passed places that the party deemed impracticable. I was pledged
for the performance, and it was a most exciting scene. Not a
horse was hurt, and we reached a patch of feed at the bottom,
where the brook, that occasionally dashes over these rocks and
must then present a fine sight, had formed a fine flat. Here we
encamped, and spent a great part of the night searching for
water, but without success. The old man depended upon finding
water in the ravine, and was greatly disappointed when we failed
to procure a supply there.</p>
<p>29th October.&mdash;At dawn next morning we recommenced our
march on the same course, and travelled through a narrow valley,
bounded by mica slate-hills on the right, and quartz grit and
felspar cliffs on our left, for about 3 m.&mdash;the horses
forming the centre of the party, which was distributed over the
country for 3 m. in search of water, and advancing towards a
promising cliff, <i>en route</i> at the head of the valley. We
all met again there, where we could not find water, and every man
reported he had been equally unsuccessful. There was a long range
of high cliffs in sight, bearing W.N.W., apparently 12 m.
distant, that presented a deep indentation, likely to afford
water and feed, so I determined to proceed there, and, descending
from the cliff, we crossed a plain 3 m. wide, covered with
samphire and salt bush, and shedding S.W.; after which we entered
a dense thicket of acacia, covered with quartz and ironstones,
like a newly metalled road, over which we marched about 10 m. to
the gorge in the cliffs, where we arrived at 10 <span class=
"a">a.m.</span>, and I halted the party to reconnoitre.</p>
<p>The day was very hot, and the men and horses looked very
jaded. The old man scratched a hole under a bush and lay down
like a dog, overpowered by heat and thirst. When I roused him, to
ascertain if he knew where there was water in these cliffs, he
laid hold of my arm and pointed up the gorge, but seemed
doubtful. However, I pushed off in that direction immediately,
with Souper and Buck, and explored every nook to the head of the
valley. We found several large water-holes, perfectly dry, and
one with some moist sand on the top, near to which some natives
had recently bivouacked. We opened the latter without any
benefit; but I found it was taking too much out of me working
without water under a broiling sun, and, at 3 <span class=
"a">p.m.</span>, returned to the party, whom I found buried, like
the old native, in holes they had scratched in the sand under
bushes that they had thrown the horse-rugs and blankets over. The
horses, too, were so thirsty they would not feed, and were
standing alongside the men, with their heads under the blankets.
The thermometer was then 111.30° in the shade.</p>
<p>The old man looked up anxiously when I arrived, and wept
bitterly when I told him that the water-holes were dry. He
evidently despaired of his life, and his apprehensions were
speedily communicated to many of the party, as I saw by their
anxious faces. Every man's eyes were fixed inquiringly on mine,
and it was evident they knew the importance of the next move. I
had formed my plan, but I was so oppressed by a perception of the
consequences, that, though anxious to relieve my companions from
suspense, several minutes were passed in silence before I could
tell them that we were beat, and that I intended to retreat to
our last watering-place, 40 m. S.E., subsequently called the
Retreat Well, and to start at sunset.</p>
<p>We were now in S. lat. 26° 15', E. long. 115° 16', or about 50
m. from Shark Bay, and 100 m. from the mouth of the Gascoigne
River; and the country for 30 m. towards either was densely
wooded, and falling to the westward, without a trace of any
water-shed. I assured them that, under Providence, there was
every probability of our reaching the Geraldine Mines in safety,
even though every horse were lost; that fortunately I saw my way
very clearly, and felt satisfied that every man, who steadily
obeyed my orders, would see his friends again; but that, at the
same time, we must be prepared to endure great privations, which
every horse we could save would diminish. All were very cheerful
after this, though their sufferings were great, and drove them to
extreme measures to allay their thirst. When the sun went down we
took off our shirts, loaded the horses, and marched through the
night stripped to our boots and trowsers, to get the benefit of
the dew. I sent Narryer and Souper on ahead, with instructions to
keep the track, make haste to the well, and return along the
track to meet us with a keg of water. Near our bivouac of the
28th I made a détour to the northward, to avoid the rocky ravine,
and at dawn I found we were entangled in gneiss and mica
slate-hills, nearly as bad as the country I was avoiding. Soon
after this our course was arrested by the rocky table-land we
were traversing terminating in a perpendicular cliff, 90 ft.
high, extending as far as I could see to the right and left, and
facing our old track, 3 m. south of it. I saw no loaded horse
could pass this place, and determined to unload, leave the
baggage here, mount the men on the horses, and push on to the
well, to save the lives of both. When I halted them, both men and
horses rocked as they stood, and I was afraid we should have some
accidents in descending the cliff. I ordered each man to unload
the horse he led, mount him, and come on with his arms and
ammunition. Messrs. Whitfield and Guerin had each lost their
horses this morning, and consequently had to walk. I gave Chainer
Cant, who rode my horse, a bag of flour to take charge of, and
Buck half a bag. Then, as the old man had been hanging on me all
night, and said he knew of no water nearer than that we were
steering for, I gave him a blue shirt, shook hands with him, and
intimated that he was free either to follow us and share what we
had, or leave us. The effect of this intelligence was wonderful.
The crouching feeble creature, whom I had supported all night,
believing that, if we passed near water, he would be obliged to
discover it, was up in an instant, standing erect and proudly on
the edge of the cliff, where, with laughing devilry flashing in
his eyes, and his right arm extended towards the west, he blew
like a grampus in the direction of our track. I found a better
place than I expected to descend to the plain, but we had not
proceeded far when I saw that Cant was giving up and we should
lose his horse, so I took the flour away from him and gave it to
Edwards. Mr. Whitfield then lay down under a small bush and said
he could not go any further. I tried to rouse him, but failed in
my endeavours; and then directing the party to follow in one
track, so that we might be easily followed, I pushed on to the
track, and placed some bushes across it to mark the spot for
night-work.</p>
<p>About an hour after we struck the track, I found Narryer and
Souper buried under a bush, and the empty keg lying in the pad.
They said they were very sorry that they had not done what I told
them, and that they would follow up in the afternoon. I told them
not to fear, and to come on at once if they were able. Narryer
then crawled out and pushed on about 6 m. farther, when he gave
up again. The horses began to fail when the sun got power, and
fell to the rear one by one, till, at the close of the day, when
I reached ihe well, I was only within hail of Mr. Brown; bat, as
I had brought the keg on with me, I then felt that I was in a
position to save them all.</p>
<p>At 8 <span class="a">p.m.</span> they were all safe, excepting
Messrs. Whitfield, Cant, and Guerin, after whom I started at dawn
next morning, with Edwards and two horses. Just as we started I
heard a gun, apparently about 2 m. off on the track, and, as the
horses travelled very slow, I called out Mr. Fraser, and sent him
on fast with some water. In a few minutes we came up with poor
Guerin, sadly altered and nearly gone, supported by Mr. Fraser.
He had no gun, and I therefore knew that one of the other men was
near, so, directing Fraser to get Guerin in as soon as possible,
I pushed on, firing signal guns in answer to those ahead, about 5
in., when I found Mr. Whitfield and Cant sitting on the track,
under the shade of a small bush, and nearly done. We stayed about
two hours with them, and freshened them up with flour and water
till they were sufficiently recovered to travel, when we mounted
them on the horses, and I gave Mr. Whitfield instructions to
proceed to camp and send Messrs. Fraser and Brown to meet me here
next day with some water. I then went on to the loads,
accompanied by Edwards, to hide the flour and procure a few
things that would place us in a better position, and diminish our
risk in the event of anything occurring to prevent our recovering
the baggage. Unfortunately the sleeve full of water that we
intended to carry had been left with Mr. Guerin, and we were thus
left without water for two days, marching back with a load.
Edwards behaved remarkably well on this occasion. We reached the
cliff at night, and went over the loads at dawn next morning,
procured what we wanted, found three horses dead, and returned to
camp that night, escorted over the last 6 m. by the gentlemen I
directed to meet us with some bread and water.</p>
<p>When I arrived, Mr. Whitfield reported that the water-hole was
nearly dry. I inspected it, and saw we had not a moment to lose.
I sent Mr. Whitfield, Buck, Narryer, and Souper off immediately
with the horses for the loads, and, at dawn next morning, sent
Messrs. Fraser, Brown, Guerin, and Cant to the Captive Well, with
orders to halt there and await further orders if there was water;
and, in the event of its being dry, to push on to Mount Welcome
and wait there till I joined them, taking care to screen all the
water-holes from the sun. I directed Mr. Fraser to kill a horse,
if he failed, near the river, and salt him down, as he was on his
last legs and could not be of further use.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 265}</u></p>
<h4><a name="ch06" id="ch06"></a>[November, 1854]</h4>
<p>November 2nd.&mdash;This day Edwards and myself were resting
at the Retreat Well, while the rest of the party were moving as I
have described. We examined the country along the S.W. side of
the great gneiss cliffs, and found several water-holes dry that
had been visited by a large body of natives that were encamped
there about three months before us. There were an immense number
of their fire-places, with acacia-pods around them, and the stony
slopes were full of holes made by them in digging up some root
they eat, and that must be very plentiful and a favourite food,
as the surrounding thicket is intersected by numerous well-beaten
paths. At midnight the horses arrived with their loads all
correct, but as I had only a gallon of water for each of them, I
turned them out three hours to feed till dawn, when I gave them
the water, and we pushed on towards Mount Welcome. Leaving them
to proceed along the track, I struck off with Souper, and found a
fine water-hole in another patch of ironstone table-land. Signal
guns were fired immediately, as agreed upon, and, in a couple of
hours, the horses had as much water as they could drink, and were
grazing in a tolerable patch of feed about half a mile south of
the well, which was half-way between the Retreat Well and the
Murchison, and 2 m. south of the track. I sent Souper off
immediately to place a mark on the track where we turned off, for
Mr. Whitfield's guidance, who was behind with Narryer and did not
come in till the afternoon, in consequence of having to go back 2
m. beyond the loads, to fetch my haversack with the watches and
some valuable memoranda that I had given him to take care of, and
that he laid down and left behind when the horse fell. I then
sent Souper with a day's rations for Mr. Fraser's party, and
orders for them to join me immediately, in pursuance of which
they came in the following morning.</p>
<p>Mr. Fraser reported that the horse died on the 3rd, at Grass
Mount, and that the meat was too inflamed for food. Here we
halted a clear day to refresh the horses, and I deemed it
advisable to reduce the ration to ¾ lb. of bread per day.</p>
<p>On the 5th November we resumed our march, and proceeded all
together towards the Captive Spring, for about 3 m., when I sent
Mr. Whitfield on there with the party, and taking Narryer and two
days' rations, steered S.S.E., over tolerably open stony country,
and struck the Murchison about 15 m. lower down, where it
presented a bold bed, and we could not find either fresh water or
feed, though we worked at every likely place for 6 m. down the
river till noon the next day, when Narryer was nearly done, and I
thought I should lose my faithful and generous companion.
However, he rallied after I washed him with brine; and marched
quite strong to the Captive's Well, where we joined the party,
after midnight, and found all correct.</p>
<p>The next day we all proceeded to Mount Welcome, and bivouacked
a night and day there. Just as we were about to start again, the
well failed before all the horses were watered, and had we not
most fortunately filled the water-bottles and kegs in the
morning, we should have been in a most critical position. But
fortune never deserted us. We had been striving hard to win our
way through a most formidable country, and Providence so ordered
the course of events, that we were repeatedly extricated from
perilous positions by means, in semblance trifling, though really
miraculous.</p>
<p>On the 8th I examined and weighed the provisions, and finding
we had only 81 lbs. of flour and 2½ lbs. of tea, while we had 160
m. to march before we could reach the Geraldine Mines, and 90 m.
to strike Mr. Gregory's last watering-place on the Murchison,
through a country so densely wooded and destitute of water, that
he had been deterred from penetrating it, I determined to reduce
the ration to &#8541; lb. per day, so as to make it last for
twelve days, or till the 20th of November, when I expected to
arrive at the mines. I then buried 9 lbs. of powder, the shoeing
tools, and four tomahawks, under a bush 18 yds. E. from the base
of a deep indent on the S.E. side of the mount. At midnight we
left Mount Welcome with water for three days, steering S.W.
towards Mr. Gregory's last on the Murchison, where, with great
difficulty, by long night and day marches, we arrived on the
12th, and encamped on a beautiful patch of grass on the bed of a
stream that we obtained water in by digging, 4 m. E.N.E. from the
great bend of the river, and in S. lat. 27° 40' 13", E. long.
115° 50'. Our course between Mount Welcome and this place led
across extensive plains, over which the waters of the rivers we
had crossed to the eastward flow to the Murchison, and through
places covered with quartz and iron stones, wooded with acacia
and studded with granite breccia, greenstone, and mica-slate
hills, that in many places presented rugged barriers impeding our
progress without affording either feed or water, and only
furnishing a sufficient supply for our horses once, at a large
hole on an elevated granite platform on the N.W. side of a huge
bare rock of that description, in S. lat. 27° 38', E. long. 115°
48'.</p>
<p>On the 14th we resumed our march down the Murchison, in which,
below the great bend, or the point where the waters from the
eastward are concentrated and fall into it, we found plenty of
fresh water, either in small springs under the red sandstone
cliffs that bound the bed on either side, or by digging in the
sand hummocks accumulated in the bed. Twenty miles along the
river, from the great bend, we found a few pools of salt water,
and shot a few brown ducks on them; and in the thickets on both
sides, presenting stony plains and wooded with acacia and white
gum-trees, ½ m. back, several turkeys and red kangaroos were shot
and many emus were seen. Lower down, the fresh water and grass
were scarce for 30 m., and the country presented a barrier,
destitute of large game, that appeared never to have been visited
by them. Low ranges of hills that, till this time, had been 7 or
8 m. off on both sides, now closed upon the river, and made the
passages down it difficult by continually driving us into or
across the heavy sandy bed, and presenting dense scrubs that
prevented our cutting off the bends. The prevailing rocks on
these hills were sienitic trap and gneiss, and spurs or dikes of
the former rock cut across the river-bed in several places. After
I had verified our position by Mr. Gregory's marks, I found his
sketch of the river of the utmost service, for, knowing his
accuracy, I was enabled by it to save many miles and strike his
water-points even in the dark; and I have much pleasure in
admitting that I was mainly able to penetrate beyond him, through
the valuable information he afforded me and the friendly interest
he took in the Expedition.</p>
<p>From the traces of Mr. Gregory's party in the bed of this
river, and other satisfactory evidence, I am convinced there has
not been a sufficient fall of rain in the interior during the
last three years to cause either it or its tributaries to
flow.</p>
<p>We met a party of natives about 30 m. from the mines, and
they, thinking we were going up the river, gave me a very
truthful account of the country, advising us all that it was
destitute of fresh water, and no men could live there at this
season.</p>
<p>On the 19th, at noon, we were within 15 m. of the mines, and
finished our provisions, intending to get in that night; but, at
sunset, Narryer shot a fine emu, about 4 m. from the mines, in a
fine patch of grass, and, as the horses were weary, I halted
there for the night and pushed on to the mines next morning,
where we arrived in health and spirits, though looking thin and
jaded, at 11 <span class="a">a.m.</span> on Monday, the 20th
November, and where we were received and treated most kindly by
Mr. C. Evans and Captain Hoskens, to whom I shall always feel
grateful for their unremitting attention to my party, as soon
after we arrived there all of us were ill, except Mr. Brown, and
I was down the first night, though I had been very
abstemious.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, I sent R. Buck, J. Edwards, W. Cant, Narryer, and
Souper, with the horses and equipment, in a cart to Port Gregory,
in charge of Mr. Whitfield.</p>
<p>On the 24th, Captain Sanford galloped in with a lot of fine
horses, mounted the rest of the party, invited us all to Linton,
and volunteered to take me up in his cutter to Shark Bay, to
relieve the ship and push, if possible, from the mouth of the
Gascoigne to my last bivouac in the interior. The pleasure this
offer afforded me can scarcely be conceived. I determined to take
Narryer with me, and eagerly embraced it. It was such a noble and
manly offer, and so calculated to be of service to
me&mdash;especially as he well knew the risk, having nearly
perished in his former bold attempt along the coast with Mr.
Gregory&mdash;that, though circumstances ultimately prevented my
accepting it, I thank him from my heart. We accepted his kind
invitation, and leaving our good friends at the mines, proceeded
on the 25th to Port Gregory, where I had the pleasure of meeting
on that day, and consulting with you relative to the disposal of
my party, and when it was arranged that Messrs. Buck, Edwards,
and Cant should accompany you in the schooner 'Daphne' to
Fremantle; that Messrs. Whitfield, Fraser, Brown, and Guerin
should be, as they requested, immediately released from their
engagements; and that Narryer and Souper were to proceed overland
with me to Head Quarters, as soon as the horses were sufficiently
recruited. In pursuance of this arrangement, I arrived at Perth
on the 27th December, and reported myself to you, when I was glad
to learn that all my party had safely arrived before me.</p>
<p>Looking at the map of the country I have traversed you will
see, 1st.&mdash;That there are extensive marshes in 118° E.
long., between 27° and 28° of S. lat., flowing and trending N.W.,
and about 1400 ft. above the level of the sea; that the country
between Toodyay, which is about 800 ft., and the base of Mount
Farmer, on the N.W. side of these marshes, rises gradually to the
height of 1896 ft. above the sea; and that this portion of the
country is so inclined, that the water is shed over this area,
towards the S. and W., into Mr. Gregory's great lake "Moore",
which is tributary to lake Cow-cowing, flowing thence, by way of
the Salt River and the Avon, to the ocean.</p>
<p>2nd.&mdash;That there are four large rivers in 117° E. long,
(between 27° 20' and 26° 40' S. lat.) of a decidedly fresh
character, coming from the N.E., and shedding into the Murchison,
which, itself, flows from the same direction; and that I appear
to have struck near the N.W. extreme of its basin; that large
numbers of natives occasionally come down these streams at the
latter end of our dry season; and that red kangaroos, emus, and
turkeys were very numerous between these rivers, though the
country on our route was very indifferent, and still worse to the
westward, while, everywhere else, the country traversed was
destitute of game, and afforded no traces of any number of
natives, except at the eastern side of the cliffs near "Farmer's
Horse Camp".</p>
<p>3rd.&mdash;That, between Mount Farmer and Mount Magnet, 150 m.
to the eastward of Mr. Gregory's last bivouac on the Murchison,
and 300 m. S.E. from Shark Bay, I have passed over 70 m. of
undulating country, presenting chocolate-coloured mica-slate
hills, and felspar and quartz grit cliffs, in association with
quartz and hornblende schist, resting on granite breccia and
greenstone, surrounded by plains of red loam, covered with quartz
stones and rich black iron ore, and shedding to the N.E. into the
great interior marsh I have discovered flowing to the N.W.; that
100 m. E. from the bottom of Hamelin Harbour, or the N. arm of
Shark Bay, at the place we retreated from on the 12th of October,
there are white cliffs resembling chalk, and quartz grit cliffs,
with, egg-shaped quartz pebbles of various sizes imbedded in
them, resting on dislocated gneiss rocks, intersected by two
walls or veins, one of round and the other of angular quartz
stones, cemented in a hard greenish-white matrix, and surrounded
by red loamy plains, covered with these angular and rounded
stones; that 100 m. S.S.W. from this last-named place, and on the
left bank of the Murchison, across my track of the 15th and 16th
of November, there are similar pebble cliffs in association or
blended with primary schists; that there are pipeclay plains,
resting on greenstone, around the quartz schist ranges, in the
vicinity of Mount Kenneth, and similar plains, covered with
quartz stones, at the base of the Felspar Cliffs, near our
bivouac of the 12th of August; and that all the facts I have
alluded to under this head show the accuracy of Sir Roderick
Murchison's views relative to the geological formation of the
country to the eastward of the Murchison River and at the hack of
Shark Bay.</p>
<p>I beg to direct your attention to the first and second items,
as indicative of <i>a fertile country to the eastward</i>; and to
the latter as confirmatory evidence in support of an eminent
geologist's opinion that we have, in this hitherto unexplored and
imprudently neglected portion of our territory, probably one of
the finest Gold Fields in the world. I have noted many important
facts in support of these opinions, which, if you wish me to lay
before you, I shall have much pleasure in submitting for your
further consideration, as well as a plan for future operations
from a central depot on the great bend of the Murchison. In
conclusion, I thank you for the consideration and kindness with
which you have supported and guided me in this arduous
undertaking; and I beg to assure you that I regret that an
Expedition, for which I was so efficiently equipped, and on
which, subject to proper restrictions, I was left as free to act
as I could possibly have desired, has not resulted in immediate
benefit, to satisfy those who are not capable of appreciating the
importance and ultimate utility of such explorations.</p>
<p>I have much pleasure in bearing testimony to the obedience and
general good conduct of my party.</p>
<p>To Mr. George Phillips, of the Colonial Secretary's office, we
are all indebted for his having volunteered and taken charge of
the schooner 'Perseverance', sent to meet us at the mouth of the
Gascoigne, and I have to thank him for the judicious and spirited
steps he took there with that vessel, which I am satisfied were
admirably calculated to ensure our communicating with him, had we
been so fortunate as to reach that place. Nor am I forgetful of
the privations the officers and crew of the vessel cheerfully
endured to serve us, and for which I do, and we all ought, to
thank them.</p>

<h4><a name="ch07" id="ch07"></a>1. <em>Letter from Mr. George
Phillips to the Hon. the Surveyor-General</em>.</h4>
<p align="right"><small>Western Australia, Perth, July 6,
1855.</small>   </p>
<p><span class="a">Sir</span>,&mdash;In compliance with your
request, I have the honour to inform you, with reference to the
River Gascoigne falling into the N. arm of Shark Bay, after
perusing my journal, kept while engaged carrying out your
instructions relative to furnishing supplies for, and
communicating with the exploring party, under the command of
Assistant-Surveyor Robert Austin, that this river flows into
Shark Bay by two branches, about 2½ m. apart, forming an island,
called Babbage Island. The approaches to these branches are
obstructed by sand spits. The entrance to the north branch is
about 12 yards wide, with a depth of 4 ft. water at high tide.
When once in, it has the appearance of an estuary, being of
considerable width, say 500 yards, running inland N.E. about a
mile, when it takes a sharp turn to the southward. Point
Whitmore, to the north of this entrance, described by Captain
Grey as being a drift sand, has, since then, been washed into the
northern entrance, thereby contracting it, and lessening the
depth of water on the bar. There is but little drift-wood on the
banks of this branch of the river.</p>
<p>The southern branch is of a very different appearance. After
crossing the bar, which, at low water, is perfectly dry, and,
during flood-tide, has from 5 to 6 ft. water over it, you
immediately come into a fine sheet of water, about 276 yards
wide, and 2½ fathoms deep. Up this branch we pulled 1½ m., the
river still carrying its width with it, but not depth. This
branch had every appearance of being the outlet of very heavy
falls of water. The banks to the south were thickly covered with
driftwood, some of the logs being of considerable dimensions, and
a great quantity of it mahogany (<i>eucalyptus robustus</i>)*
which, from my slight experience in these matters, I believe is
indicative of a well-timbered country at the back. The banks of
the river are composed of porous red sand, among clay; and the
flats, which extend to the south, are salt marshes.</p>
<p class="foot">[* It is believed that this is the most northern
point on which this species of eucalyptus has been seen.]</p>
<p>The bar, at the entrance, is, I imagine, from its shape,
formed of a deposit from the freshes during the floods. On it
there is a considerable quantity of driftwood, some of which is
so placed as to resemble a number of posts, when viewing it from
seaward.</p>
<p>That portion of Babbage Island presented to the sea is formed
of abrupt white sand dunes. At the back of these dunes, it
appears to be luxuriantly vegetated, and intersected by mangrove
creeks. The island is easily recognised, it being the most
southern part of the coast where the sand dunes exist in that
portion of the bay, the southern branch of the river separating
it from the belt of mangrove-trees.</p>
<p>The country to the south of the river, and on the coast side
of the range of sand hills, so far as I had an opportunity of
observing, is of a very sterile nature. It consists of salt
marshes, clay flats, sand, and scrub; no timber of any
description, and covered with natives' paths, well beaten, and in
places, artificially raised above the level of the swamps.</p>
<p>With regard to the natives, the majority were
well-proportioned and fine athletic men; they do not seem to make
use of any paint whatever, are of a dirty black colour, do not
wear any clothing, and I never at any time saw them accompanied
by women or children. They were always armed with short, barbed
spears, and throwing-sticks, and always seemed anxious for us to
go to them; but on our doing so, retreated to the shore or into
the scrub, where they would commence hallooing one to another
until the sounds were lost in the distance. They never evinced
any hostility to us, save on one occasion, when three of the men
left the boat to visit the bottle I had buried, containing
intelligence of our arrival, for Mr. Austin, on the south end of
Babbage Island; when returning to us they were chased by nine
natives armed with spears. Upon the men regaining the boat, we
fired a shot over their heads which checked their further
pursuit. They then made signs of peace to us by throwing down the
spears behind them and holding up their hands to show that they
were empty, but they were not to be trusted. I observed upon one
occasion, when returning to the vessel from the river, that they
used a description of net which appeared, as near as I could form
an idea at the distance we were from them, to be about 20 ft. in
length and 3 ft. deep; this was drawn across the channels, like a
seine, by two men, and the fish driven by others into it.</p>
<p>We were very fortunate in securing a good anchorage, 5 m. to
the south of the river, in a channel in a very extensive sand
flat. This flat stretched over an extent of 15 m. north and
south&mdash;ran out into the sea between 4 and 5 m., was
intersected by deep channels, with bar entrances. The one in
which the schooner was anchored had 6 ft. of water on the bar, 2½
fathoms inside, and about 100 yards wide. In this novel harbour
we remained in perfect safety, 3 m. off shore, and in smooth
water, although exposed to the full force of the wind. On each
side of the channel at low water the flat was perfectly dry.</p>
<p>It is exceedingly difficult to discover the approaches to any
one of these channels in gloomy weather owing to the flat being
covered with weed at its outer edge, but on a clear day these
openings are very distinct, and you are enabled to follow the
channel with the eye until it shoals to a mere ditch.</p>
<p>There is a very large channel to the south-and-by-east of the
river, and at the northern extremity of the sand flat, with
upwards of 7 ft. water at the entrance to it at low ebb tide, and
about 200 yards wide, with upwards of 3 fathoms water. The only
disadvantage attending this channel, is that it is open to the
north-west gales; and it would be necessary to proceed some
distance up it to avoid the sea.</p>
<p>It would always be desirable, in the event of any vessel
seeking shelter in any one of these channels, to lay down buoys
on each side of the entrance, and send a boat a short distance in
advance up the channel, when with proper management a vessel
could be safely taken in without fear of grounding.</p>
<p>The wind, during our stay, varied from S.E. to S.S.W., with
clear sky. When at S.E. it invariably blew a gale, which caused
fine red sand to blow from the main, giving the appearance of a
red haze. Upon one occasion, when it had been blowing stiffly
from the east, the rigging was covered with a fine red dust. With
the wind from the E.N.E., we had very cloudy, gloomy weather,
intensely hot, and accompanied by severe thunder-storms. On
December 17 we had the only shower of rain worthy of notice;
during the time the shower lasted it was exceedingly close.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of the tide varies from 5 to 6 ft. at the
full of the moon, when we had the highest water, and low ebb
tides at the season of the new moon.</p>
<p>The only curiosities I was fortunate enough to discover, were
some water-snakes, of green and yellow colour, about 6 ft. long,
but which I was unable to preserve, not having the proper
materials,&mdash;and part of a canoe, picked up on the southern
extremity of Babbage Island, similar to that found by Mr. Austin
when surveying that coast in 1851.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The canoe presented to the Perth Museum by
Lieut. Helpman and Mr. Austin, on their return from the survey of
Shark Bay and Exmouth Gulf, in 1851, was found by the latter
gentleman on the sandy mangrove point on the southern side of the
S. entrance of the Gascoigne River, and consisted of a very light
log of white wood, 11 ft. long, and 10 in. diameter, curved at
one end to an angle of 160°, with pegs driven on each side of the
curved end, on which two layers of small twigs were bound with
bark, forming a basket like a dish along half its length, in
which the natives probably place their spears, children, &amp;c.,
while propelling themselves across the river; but as these
canoes, which are not adapted for rough water, were found among
the drift timber, at a point where the river is fordable in fine
weather, and the materials of which they are formed do not grow
on the coast, Mr. Austin infers they came from the interior with
the drift timber, from a good country lying in a N.E. direction,
within 200 m. of the coast, shedding its waters S.W., into the
upper part of the N. arm of Shark Bay by this river, and another
supposed to exist between it and Cape Cuvier, and abreast of
Bernier Island, on which Captain (now Sir George) Grey discovered
a great quantity of large drift timber; and N.W. into Exmouth
Gulf, where Mr. Austin discovered extensive mud-flats, containing
fragments of granite, slate, and quartz, indicative of the mouth
of a large river that flowed from a country where these rocks
prevailed, more especially as the neighbourhood of the coast
appears of coalitic and tertiary formation. In addition to what I
have advanced here, and elsewhere, in favour of a large river
flowing into Shark Bay, it may be useful to state that the
singular mammiferous animal called the Dugong, an inhabitant of
shallow seas near the mouths of large rivers in S. America, was
found by Lieut. Helpman there, and accurately described for the
information of Professor Owen, of London, by
myself.&mdash;<span class="u">Robert Austin</span>.]</p>
<p>The following, Sir, is a brief outline of my proceedings from
the time of my leaving Fremantle to that of my return to
head-quarters:&mdash;</p>
<p>Sailed from Fremantle on the 11th October, 1854, with a light
wind from the S.E. Arrived at Port Gregory on the 15th; and after
taking in our supply of water we sailed again for Shark Bay on
the 18th&mdash;anchored at the Quoin on the 20th. We then formed
a Provision Depôt, as a resource for the boats, in the event of
an accident occurring to the vessel while off the river. Sailed
at daylight on the morning of the 25th for the N. end of Peron's
Peninsula, and anchored there at 4 <span class="a">p.m.</span> on
the same day. We again sailed in the morning and sighted the main
about 9h. 30m. <span class="a">a.m.</span>,&mdash;stood in close
for the land. I then went in search of the river without
succeeding in finding it. While searching for the river I came
upon an extensive flat with from 2 to 3 ft. of water on it. It
was intersected at intervals with deep channels, varying from 2
to 3 fathoms in depth, with bar entrances. After pulling up and
down the coast for several hours I returned to the ship, when it
began to blow very strongly from the S.E. We were, therefore,
obliged to stand out to sea once more. On the night of the 29th,
the wind having fallen, we stood in again for Shark Bay, having
been blown about 60 m. outside of Bernier Island. On the 31st
went in through the Naturalist Passage, and at 7 <span class=
"a">p.m.</span> let go anchor for the night on a pearl bank,
about 3 m. to leeward of Peron's Peninsula. On the following
morning we worked up to the north extremity of the Peninsula,
where we remained till the 5th November, taking in a supply of
firewood.</p>
<p>At 2 <span class="a">a.m.</span> on the morning of the 6th we
again sailed for the main, with a light southerly wind. At noon
we anchored the vessel in one of the channels before mentioned.
After the vessel was safely moored I started once more in search
of the river, the south entrance of which we made at dusk, and
found it as before described. While running up the coast this
afternoon we fell in with several sea-snakes of a dingy brown
colour, with bright green and yellow spots. We slept at the
southern extremity of the island on the night of the 6th. In the
morning, so soon as it was sufficiently daylight, I went and
examined the mangrove bushes, to see if any limbs had been cut
off, also whether any of the earth had been turned up about them,
but found no signs of the party. We then returned to the
vessel.</p>
<p>On the 14th I visited the north entrance of the river for the
purpose of ascertaining the depth of water and the formation of
that branch. We found the entrance very narrow and about 4 ft.
deep: this was at high water. It had a sandbar in front, on
which, with an ordinary sea breeze, the sea broke with
violence.</p>
<p>During my absence on the 6th the vessel was visited by seven
natives without evincing any fear, as I was afterwards informed
by the master, and which I found to be the case on several
subsequent occasions.</p>
<p>On the 22nd the vessel was moored in another channel with less
water, and with barely 4 ft. water on the bar at the entrance, at
ebb tide. In this channel we remained till the 60 days had
expired, and continued to visit the river twice a week. On one
occasion of visiting the river we found the remains of a ship's
long boat about a quarter of a mile to the S. of the river.</p>
<p>Native fires were very numerous along the coast during the
whole period we were in this vicinity.</p>
<p>On the 7th January, 1855, the number of days we were to remain
in the vicinity of the Gascoigne having expired, and not having
seen any signs of the Exploring Party, we took advantage of the
fine weather, and after warping the vessel out of the channel set
sail for the Peninsula; the wind favouring us a little, we
arrived at the north end of the Peninsula on the 8th, took in a
supply of water, and sailed for the Quoin on the 12th, where,
after breaking up the Provision Depot and ballasting the vessel
with guano, we sailed for Port Gregory, at which port we arrived
on the 27th, and having learnt the safe return of Mr. Austin and
party, we sailed for Fremantle on the 30th, and arrived there on
the 4th February, and on the 5th I proceeded to head-quarters and
reported the safe return of the schooner from Shark Bay.</p>

<h4><a name="ch08" id="ch08"></a>2. <em>Letter from Mr.
Drummond</em>.</h4>
<p align="right"><small>Hawthornden Farm, April 16, 1855.</small>
  </p>
<p><span class="a">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have examined the two
collections of plants brought and sent home by you, <i>as well as
I can, from the very imperfect state of the specimens</i>. I
find, in all, about fifty exogenous plants, three
<i>endogens</i>, and one <i>acrogen</i>, or lichen. The
leguminous plants are ten in number. The plant which was pointed
out to me by my son James, as the one which poisoned your horses,
is a species of gastrolobium, the same genus which is known to
produce so many poisons; it is in flower in the first collection,
and in seed in the second. One of the most beautiful plants you
brought home is of this order&mdash;a plant with flat, leafless
stems, and large red or yellow flowers. I found it, first, near
the Wangan hills, and, afterwards, saw it in many places in the
Champion Bay district. Although I have long sent it to Europe, I
have, as yet, seen no description of it. I observe six myrtaceous
plants in the collections: one, a grey shrub, with branches
densely <i>crowded with leaves</i>, is new to me; but it has
neither flowers nor seed-vessels. Among the myrtaceæ, there are
specimens of <i>salisia pulchella</i>, and <i>callistemon
ph&oelig;niceus</i>, of Lindley, both beautiful Swan River
plants. There are five or six <i>proteaceæ</i>, none of them new,
and an equal number of <i>compositæ</i>, all common everlasting
flowers. The collection contains a pretty <i>hibiscus</i>, with
grey, wrinkled, solanum leaves, and a hoary-leaved purple flower.
I have gathered both of these plants in the Champion Bay
district; both collections contain specimens of a very beautiful
plant, the <i>keraudrenia velutina</i> of Steetz, a plant first
found in this colony by Mr. Roe, and, I believe, sent by him to
Baron Hügel. The second collection contains fragments, <i>almost
in the form of powder</i>, of two <i>loranthaceous</i> plants.
These make our Western Australian specimens of this curious
parasitical genus amount to eleven in number. If you can
recollect them, it would be well to state the trees on which
these parasites grow. When at Champion Bay, I found a curious
climbing blue-flowered pentandrous plant, a new genus, natural
order unknown to me. Your second collection contains two
additional specimens of this unknown genus. The same collection
contains two remarkable plants, which are altogether unknown to
me. Of one, there is only a very small fragment, the top of a
shoot with very clammy leaves. This plant I cannot examine
without altogether destroying the specimen; and I think it better
to return it to Mr. Roe as I received it. The other plant has
grey leaves, and remarkably oblong shield-like seed-vessels. I
know no plant which in the least resembles this, and, without
much better specimens, I cannot understand its economy. Of the
endogens, two are very common all over the west coast. The third
has no leaves, but, from the flowers, it seems to be a pretty,
new species of thysanotus. The <i>acrogen</i> is a curious
lichen, allied to the European L. caninus.</p>

<h4><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>3. <em>Letter from W. A. Sanford
to the Colonial Secretary</em>.</h4>
<p align="right"><small>Perth, July 7, 1855.</small>   </p>
<p>Sir,&mdash;As you request, I send you a list of the mammalia
and birds, the skins of which you have forwarded me, as far as I
am acquainted with them, with a few observations on the
distribution of the species.</p>
<p><i>Osphranter rufus</i>.&mdash;Great red kangaroo.
<i>Lagorchestes hirsutus</i>.&mdash;Rufous hare kangaroo.
<i>Hapalotis Mitchellii</i>.&mdash;Mitchell's soft-ear.
<i>Echidna hystrix</i>.&mdash;Spiny echidna.</p>
<p>From your description, you appear to have fallen in with large
numbers of the <i>Hapalotis conditor</i>, the building soft-ear,
and <i>Ch&oelig;ropus castanotus</i>, the chestnut-eared
hog's-foot, and some of the <i>Onychogalea lunata</i>, lunated
nail-tailed kangaroo or worung.</p>
<p><i>Strix delicatula</i>.&mdash;Delicate owl.  .  .  .  Another
species. <i>Cinclosoma cinnamomeus</i>.&mdash;Cinnamon
ground-thrush. <i>Cacatua eos</i>.&mdash;Rose-breasted cockatoo.
<i>Melopsittacus undulatus</i>.&mdash;Undulated grass parrakeet
or bujirigar. <i>Euphema Bourkii</i>.&mdash;Bourke's grass
parrakeet.</p>
<p><i>Platycercus</i>.  .  .  .  . Probably a new
species&mdash;small, not so large as <i>P. icterotis</i>; blue,
green, with a delicate brown bar on the tip of each feather on
the neck and back; base of the tail black, shaded through green
and blue to white; primaries black, outer rib blue shaded into
white; secondaries deep blue; under wing coverts and scapulars
bright blue; belly and vent pale greenish orange, frontal band
orange, and spots of orange brown on rump, shoulders, and top of
the head. Killed on the Upper Murchison.</p>
<p><i>Pezoporus formosus</i>.&mdash;Beautiful ground parrot.
<i>Ochophaps plumifera</i>.&mdash;Crested pigeon. <i>Estrilda
bella</i>?&mdash;A small finch. <i>Cursorius</i>?&mdash;I am not
acquainted with this courser, but have no reason to believe it
new.</p>
<p>Four small insessorial birds, with which I am not
acquainted.</p>
<p>You also appear to have fallen in with considerable numbers of
the gnow, <i>leipoa ocellata</i>, and many other birds well known
in the colony.</p>
<p>Your description and sketch of the nest of the gnow is most
interesting, and is probably new to naturalists, as far as the
detail is concerned.</p>
<p>The conclusions which may be drawn from the existence of many
of the above animals in the colony are, that a country of a
somewhat similar character to that in which they were found
exists, extending from it to the borders of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The <i>Osphranter rufus</i> has not hitherto been found to the
west of South Australia, except when seen by Mr. Gregory and my
brother, in their last Expedition; and your having brought home
specimens sets the question at rest as to the existence of the
species in this colony. The fact of the variation of colour in
both sexes from blue to red is a fact, as far as I know of,
hitherto unnoticed.</p>
<p>As these animals require good feeding ground, their existence
in this colony affords some hope that a communication may yet be
found between this and the Eastern Colonies.</p>
<p>The <i>Hapalotis</i> of both kinds, the <i>Ch&oelig;ropus</i>,
and <i>Echidna</i> have been found in the Eastern Colonies, and,
with the exception of the <i>Echidna</i>, in much the same sort
of country as that in which you appear to have found them.</p>
<p>The <i>Lagorchestes</i> and <i>Onychogalea</i> have hitherto
been found in this colony alone.</p>
<p>Of the birds, the most interesting, in point of distribution,
are probably <i>Cinclosoma cinnamomeus</i>, a bird of
considerable rarity, found only in the remote interior. Another
species inhabits this colony, and another New South Wales.
<i>Cacatua eos, Melopsittacus undulatus, Euphema Bourkii</i>:
these are all characteristic of the interior; this
<i>Euphema</i>, I believe, has never been found near the
coast.</p>
<p>The <i>Cursorius</i> indicates the probable existence of vast
flat countries. The only parts where such birds are at all
plentiful, as far as I am aware of, are in the neighbourhood of
the Sahara, and similar localities.</p>
<p>The birds, as well as the mammalia, lead to the conclusion
that you reached the central region of animal life of this
continent; and that a country capable of supporting large animals
exists throughout the interior, although probably separated into
oases of greater or less extent and distance from each other. The
spot where the great red kangaroo was most abundant would, on
this view, be the best adapted for a starting-point for any fresh
Expedition into the interior.</p>
