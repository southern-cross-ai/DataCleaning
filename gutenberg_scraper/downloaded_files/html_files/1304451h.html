<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; TERROR ON THE
HIGHWAY</h2>

<p class="first">ANN TRAVERS awoke with a start. She lifted her
head from the rough tweed of Bob's overcoat shoulder and looked
dazedly around. The roadster's motor still thrummed the monotonous
song that seldom had been out of her ears in the long week since
they had left New York. Her husband's blunt-fingered, capable hands
still gripped the steering wheel, The desert still
spread&mdash;bare, utterly lifeless&mdash;from horizon to horizon;
and running interminably under the hood there were still the two
faint ruts in the sand which the thin-lipped filling-station
attendant in Axton had pointed out as the road to Deadhope. Yet Ann
was uneasy, oppressed, aware of a creeping chill in her bones that
matched the anomalous chill of the desert night.</p>

<p>"Awake, hon?" Bob broke the silence. "We're almost there. Not
much over a mile more."</p>

<p>Ann's lips smiled, but her weary eyes were humorless. "I don't
believe it. This trip is never going to end. We're going on and
on..."</p>

<p>"Wrong again. A mere five thousand feet from here, the gang I
sent ahead to get things ready is waiting to greet their
boss&mdash;Mrs. Travers."</p>

<p>How Bob loved to mouth that title. She hadn't gotten used to it
yet&mdash;one doesn't identify a new name with oneself in a
week...</p>

<p>All at once now, Ann realized what change had occurred to weigh
her down with vague fear since she had drifted off to sleep. The
stars that had been close and friendly, their myriads a vast,
coruscating splendor in the velvety black bowl of the heavens, now
were pale, infinitely distant in a sky suffused with heatless,
silvery radiance, forerunner of a not-yet-risen moon. The spectral
luminance sifted down to paint the undulating, gaunt plain with
weird mystery, and long flat shadows of mesquite bush and cactus
barred the vibrant glow with a network strangely ominous.</p>

<p>Bob leaned forward, flicked a switch on the dashboard. The
headlights boring the night dimmed. "Save battery," he muttered, in
explanation. Then, grinning, "Show my employer how economical her
mine-superintendent can be."</p>

<p>Ann twisted to him. "Bob! I don't want to hear that sort of talk
any longer. The silver mine Uncle Horvay left is as much yours as
mine. More, because it's just so much dirt except for your
wonderful process. There hasn't been anything taken out of it for
years."</p>

<p>The man threw an arm up in mock defense against her vehemence.
"All right. All right. I'll be good. Give me a kiss."</p>

<p>Even while Bob's lips clung warmly to hers, Ann's eyes strayed
past him. Ahead, the horizon was close, much too close, as if the
road ended abruptly in a vast uncanny nothingness. It was just the
crest of a rise, she told herself fiercely; but she could not rid
herself of the eerie sensation that they were plunging on to a
jumping-off place, a Land's End over which the car would hurtle to
fall eternally into some abysmal chasm.</p>

<p>Under the steady thrum of the roadster and the sough of its
tires there was a hissing sound, like the breathing of some unseen
monster. It was the whispering of countless grains of sand sifted
along the desert by the wind, but it added to the spine-prickling
certainty of impending disaster in Ann's mind. This strange, grim
land resented their intrusion, their intention to reopen the old
wounds in its bosom that long ago had healed. Once before it had
lured men with false promise into its deadly gullet, had spewed
them out broken in pocket and health, grey with the patina of
defeat. Now it was warning them to turn back&mdash;before it was
too late.</p>

<p>Ann started at a new sound that filled her ears. It was a
roaring from ahead, from the secret region beyond the ridge-crest.
It was the thunder of an approaching engine, a ponderous engine
plunging through moon-hazed night at breakneck speed.</p>

<p>The tremendous apparition on that too-close skyline was
startling despite the trumpeted warning of its approach. The huge
truck lurched over the ridge, careened down the road, hurtled
straight at them. Bob's horn blared raucous warning. Ann glimpsed
his pallid, lined face, his blanched hands fighting the wheel. The
truck blasted down upon them like a juggernaut, an avalanche of
destruction. Ann screamed...</p>

<p>The gigantic front of the bellowing projectile loomed right
above her. In that age-long, frozen instant of imminent demolition
Ann saw the utterly white countenance of its high-perched driver:
his eyes that bulged with a terror blinding him to the presence of
the other car, of anything but some stark inner vision from which
he fled; his twitching, bitten lips. She screamed again, more in
horror at that which she read in the contorted visage than from her
own peril.</p>

<p>Her shrill keening penetrated the brain of the truck driver. His
big-thewed arms jerked, the careening vehicle swerved, scraped past
the edge of the roadster's fender. The swaying body of the
dirt-truck, altitudinous above her, was crowded with husky,
brute-jawed men. They were rigid in the grip of the same terror
that invested their chauffeur. Their livid faces were color-drained
masks straining through the dust-cloud that swirled after them.
Their eyes were deep-pitted coals ablaze with black flame. The
truck skidded...</p>

<p>The picture of soul-shattering, fearful flight flashing on Ann's
vision exploded in a grinding crash, a thunderous detonation of
metal on metal, of bursting tires and smashing glass. She hurtled,
asprawl, through a whirling world, thudded down on stinging,
breath-expelling grit.</p>

<p>She looked up through dazed eyes. The truck was already yards
away, its breathless haste not slackened at all, the red eye of its
tail-light penduluming in short arcs as panic speed magnified the
slight inequalities of the desert road. The sideward, yellow spray
of the tiny lamp spattered, not on a license plate, but on an
incredible figure hanging by clenched, bony fingers from a bracing
truss under the truck's tailboard and hidden by it from the
terror-stiffened men above.</p>

<p>Ann saw the man clearly. The grisly fingers by which the
rag-garmented, dust-greyed apparition was suspended from the
catapulting vehicle seemed to probe her brain with horror.
Skeleton-thin, he streamed out behind the hurtling lorry like a
bedraggled pennant; whatever of clothing had covered his pipe-stem,
bounding legs was torn away and they were greyed to the hue of
putrescent bone. His feet, flesh-stripped as they dragged through
the dirt of the turnpike, trailed two lines of scarlet blood.</p>

<p>Then the truck was gone. Only a low-lying band of drifting
dust-cloud and two scars on the desert's silvered surface showed
that it had even been. Two scars between which thirsty sand drank
red moisture, till no trace remained to testify that the grisly
figure she had seen, or thought she had seen, was real.</p>

<p>The truck was gone! The meaning of that impacted on Ann's
bewildered mind. As on the trackless sea, so in the desert waste
the unwritten law of Man's obligation to his fellow in distress is
stringent, inflexible. To have ignored it as the occupants of the
lorry had, in rushing heedless from the wreck they had caused,
stamped them as utterly vile&mdash;or inflamed by such devastating
panic as had stripped humanity from them...</p>

<p>The sound of a groan cut into Ann's consciousness. She rolled
toward it.</p>

<p>The roadster was on its side, smashed to a jumble of twisted
metal, burst rubber. Ann realized that only by the miracle of a
lowered top had she been thrown free. Threshing arms, a body
twisting up from chaos, falling back into it, showed her that Bob
had not been so fortunate.</p>

<p>A sob tightened her throat. She pawed sand, pushed herself to
her knees, heaved erect. The ground rolled like a tidal swell,
staggered her, reeled her to a grip on the crumpled car-side. Bob
groaned again, and she saw his twisted torso, the pale, tortured
oval of his face.</p>

<p>"Ann!" His voice was a husked, hoarse whisper, pain-edged. "Ann!
You're&mdash;you're all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the monosyllable squeezed from between her icy lips. "But
you&mdash;you're hurt, darling. You're terribly hurt."</p>

<p>"A&mdash;little." Bob gasped and collapsed to the sickening
sound of grating bone. "I&mdash;can't&mdash;get free."</p>

<p>His eyes sought Ann's face. Agony flared in them, was obscured
by drooping, bloodless lids. Suddenly he was so motionless, so
filmed over by the spectral moonlight with the very hue of death,
that Ann's heart stood still and her skin was an icy sheath
constricting her trembling body. But his cheek was warm to her
darting palm; his nostrils quivered with pain, and a muscle
twitched across the taut cords of his stretched-back neck.</p>

<p>Ann's teeth gritted. Her lips tightened to a grim, thin line.
Her husband's right leg was strangely askew. Its ankle, making a
nauseatingly awkward angle with its calf, already was swollen to
twice normal size and the foot was caught between gear-lever and
emergency brake. No wonder he had groaned in anguish, no wonder he
had fainted!</p>

<p>The next few minutes greyed to a blur of feverish activity, of
muscle-tearing effort. How Ann accomplished it she never knew, but
somehow she extricated Bob, somehow she lifted his hundred-eighty
pounds free of the wreck. At last he was stretched out on the sand.
Ann loosened his shoe, got it off. Then, staggering back to the car
to pull seat-cushions out, she improvised a bed for him. She tugged
and pushed at his inert frame till he was as comfortable as she
could make him. She paused then, stared down at his big-boned face,
appallingly white against the black leather.</p>

<p>Bob's eyelids flickered open, revealing hot torment. "My boy,"
Ann sobbed. "My poor boy."</p>

<p>There was something besides pain in those queerly glittering
eyes&mdash;an appeal, an urgent demand. "What is it, dear?" the
girl gasped. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>The croak that came from him was unintelligible. But his arm
lifted, motioned waveringly to the breast pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>Ann realized what worried him. She slipped a hand between the
warm roughness of the fabric and his pounding heart. Paper crackled
at the tips of her searching fingers. She pulled it out, the
envelope containing the essential formulae for the process that
would make profitable the working of low-grade ore from the
abandoned mine at Deadhope. She pulled it out and held it up for
Bob to see.</p>

<p>His mouth twisted, and his eyes signaled imperatively. Ann slid
the envelope into her bosom, felt it crackle against her breast.
After he had proved the worth of his process, Bob had told her, he
could sell it for vast sums. Until then he must keep it secret.
There were interests...</p>

<p>But her husband was once more unconscious. Her own limbs were
water weak. She sank down beside him, squatted there, holding his
hand in hers. Exhaustion welled up in her like a dark sea.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2"></a>II &mdash; THE CRAWLERS</h2>

<p class="first">THE moon had risen now over the ridge whence had
catapulted the juggernaut of terror and destruction. It hung low in
the sky, a great orange globe. It was so close, yet so infinitely
far. It watched Ann's distress with an impersonal stolidity and she
was small, terribly small, in the unpeopled immensity of the
desert, in the hush weirdly emphasized by the whispering of the
restless sands. What else did the moon watch, there over the hill,
there where the ghost town of Deadhope had spawned horror which had
sent hard-faced, stolid men careening through the night in a
paroxysm of terror?</p>

<p>Ann tried to wrench her mind away from fear, tried to tell
herself that she ought to see what she could do for Bob's broken
ankle; that she ought to bathe his face, pimply with the cold sweat
of pain even in his coma. In a minute she would&mdash;in a minute,
but just now she must rest. She was so tired, so tired, and her
body was one gigantic ache. And she was terribly afraid. Not only
because of the breath of death's wings that had brushed so close.
Not only because of Bob's hurt, his helplessness. But because of
that which she had read in the faces of the men on that
truck&mdash;because of that which had trailed behind the vehicle as
it rushed away!</p>

<p>Recalling these, a pall of dread closed down, somehow visible in
the sheeted moonlight lying spectrally on the limitless, lifeless
waste around her. Lifeless? Was it some trick of the half-light, of
her tired eyes, or was that shadow, that one way off there on the
horizon, moving?...</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> moving. It was something gruesomely alive,
indiscernible, flat against the sand, something that slithered
slowly, that slithered over that ridge to the east, that vanished
over the earth-fold beyond which was&mdash;what?</p>

<p>Ann's scalp was a tight cap on her throbbing skull. That which
had crawled along the desert surface, how long had it lain there?
How long had its shadow lain immobile like the other shadows,
shorter now, of the water-starved, grotesque foliage of the
barrens? How long had it watched there, buzzard-like? Had it now
gone to call its fellows, certain that there would soon be carrion
here for them to feed upon?</p>

<p><i>"Ten thousand men laboring an hour apiece! That slide rule's
warped..."</i> Gibberish in a hoarse, parched voice pulled her head
around to Bob's sweat-wet face, to his open, staring eyes. <i>"DX
over DY multiplied by cosign thirty degrees and you get two
kilograms of Ag O Cl."</i> His hand was a burning coal in hers, his
lips were black, cracked. He jerked up to a sitting posture, his
other arm flung up over his head, and he screamed: <i>"Ann! I've
got it! I've got it, Ann! We're rich. We're rich!"</i></p>

<p>"Bob. Bob, dear. Lie down. Be quiet." The young wife had both
hands on the delirious man, was trying to wrestle him down. But
fever-madness contorted his face, and with the strength of madness
he tossed her about, fighting her.</p>

<p><i>"You can't have it!"</i> he screeched, in that awful voice
that was not Bob's voice. <i>"You can't have my secret. It's for
Ann. For Ann, I tell you. I won't give it to you!"</i></p>

<p>The desert silence took his shrill cries and quenched them, but
they rang on in Ann's ears, and in her veins the blood ran cold
with fear for her husband, her lover. Even as she fought to save
him from his fever-demented self, tears streamed down her face, and
sobs racked her. Oh, God! What was she to do? What could she do for
him? If he got away from her?</p>

<p>As suddenly as it had come, the paroxysm of delirium passed. Bob
slumped down. One word, one word more rasped from him.
"Water..."</p>

<p>Water! He was burning with fever. Water would relieve him, water
for his dry throat, water to bathe his torrid brow. Ann clawed to
her feet, fought weakness, fought exhaustion to get to the car.</p>

<p>Water! The cans had torn loose from their straps on the crumpled
running-board, the cans all travelers in the desert must carry.
Here they were. Here in the sand was the red-painted one for gas,
there the blue one for oil. The white one! Good Lord! Where was the
white can, the water can? Breath sobbed from between Ann's lips as
she spied it, flung farther than the others, blending with the
silver of the sands.</p>

<p>She tottered to it, bent to it, got hands on it and lifted it.
It was light! <i>Too light!</i> Oh, God! Oh, merciless God! The
depression it left in the sand was wet, though rapidly drying, and
a gash in the white side of the round can showed where the water,
more precious than a thousand times its weight of silver or
platinum, had run out. <i>There was no water!</i></p>

<p>There was no water, and on the pallet she had improvised for him
Bob, her Bob, tossed and rasped out his agonized demand
for&mdash;water. "Ann," he husked. "Ann. I'm burning. Water. Ann,
give me water."</p>

<p>The distracted girl licked her own dry lips, let the mocking
canteen slip from her powerless fingers, stood statuesque, rigid,
numbed by a disaster more overwhelming than all the intangible
fears crowing around her had foreshadowed. To be waterless in the
desert! Even now the fever-wracked, thirst-tormented man was
threshing on his bed of pain, was crying for cooling liquid to
assuage the fire within him. What would it be when the sun came
blazing up over the horizon to pour down its torrid beams on the
shade-less, waterless waste? What would it be when the air, so
chill now, quivered with insupportable heat and the sands became a
fiery furnace, a searing hell?</p>

<p>Water! Old tales crawled out of the past to trail their awful
warning through her anguish. Tales leathery-visaged Uncle Horvay
had told, come from the Purgatory of his depleted mine to find a
year or two of brooding sanctuary in her home. They had haunted her
dreams, those stories of men creeping, creeping through the
thirsty, interminable miles of the desert, black tongues hanging
from blackened mouths&mdash;stark, staring mad after hopeless
struggle and ripping their own veins to drink relieving death at
last. One gibbering, skull-like visage seemed to form in the
ambient sheen of the vacant night as it had gibbered at her in
nightmares then. It changed to Bob's square-jawed, bronzed
countenance, changed back again to a mask of horror. Her larynx
constricted to a soundless scream.</p>

<p>"Ann!" Bob's cry came like the cry of a frightened child,
through the shell of despair encompassing her. "Ann! Where are you?
<i>Ann!"</i> He was sitting up, was staring about him with
glittering, frightened eyes. He stared right at her and did not see
her.</p>

<p>She got to him, knelt to him. Her arms were around him. "Bob!"
she sobbed. "Bob, dear. Here I am. Right here."</p>

<p>"Ann," he whimpered, clinging to her. "Ann. Why don't you give
me some water? I'm so thirsty. So terribly thirsty. And my foot
hurts so."</p>

<p>Fever and pain had made of her strong, brawny husband a little,
frightened child. Agony tore at her heart, clawed her brain.</p>

<p>"Help me, Ann. Help me."</p>

<p>"Of course I'll help you." The girl got steadiness into her
voice. "But you will have to be brave." She loved him. Only now did
she know how love strained in her every nerve, in her every sinew,
how it yearned to him. She got his head down to her palpitant
breast, held it there. He was quieter, his upturned eyes more
reasonable. She would have to chance telling him. "Listen, dear.
Our water is spilt. I'll have to go and get some more. I'll have to
go and get help. I'll have to leave you, but it will be only for a
little while."</p>

<p>"Leave me! Alone?" Fear flared in the pain-filled orbs that were
fastened on her face. Then it died away. The lines of Bob's face
hardened, the lines of his mouth firmed. "Of course. Deadhope is
only over the hill." He lay more heavily against her breast. The
fever was sapping what little strength he had left.
"Kane...foreman. Tell him...hurry. I'll be&mdash;all
right&mdash;till he&mdash;comes." Bob's voice trailed into silence.
His eyes were closed. He was asleep.</p>

<p>Ann slid him gently off her lap, on to the seat cushions, pulled
his overcoat together, buttoned it with shaking fingers. She stood
up and slipped out of her own warm garment to roll it and push it
under his head for a pillow. Her lips brushed his and he smiled in
his sleep. Muttered, "Ann. Darling."</p>

<p>Then she was erect, was walking away from him, the desert sands
clogging her footsteps. Walking toward the crest of the road-rise
that now was silver-edged, shimmering as though it were the crest
of a long sea-swell. Deadhope was over the hill. Deadhope from
which two-fisted, hard-faced brawlers had fled in an extremity of
blood-curdling terror. Deadhope where some awful menace lurked,
more fearful because she could not know, could not guess its
nature.</p>

<p>Deadhope where water must be, water and some conveyance,
perhaps, that would enable her to carry Bob to shelter.</p>

<p>Behind lay mile upon mile of unpopulated, barren country. Only
in the mystery ahead was there any reachable possibility of help
for Bob. And so, although apprehension lay a leaden weight within
her, and fear clawed her with gelid talons, and her veins were a
network lacing her shuddering form with icy dread, Ann Travers
stalked like a lonely specter through the ghost-grey moonlight. And
far out on the desert another shadow that had lain motionless and
watching, moved imperceptibly and slithered over the edge of the
ground-swell to carry ahead word of her coming...</p>

<p>Ann climbed the ground-swell as though she were moving through
some transparent, thick liquid. Though quite invisible, it resisted
her slow advance so that she had to force through it, fighting for
every inch of progress. It was barely a hundred yards to the summit
of the rise, yet it was an endless journey as within her fear
shrieked, "Look out! Danger ahead! If those men could not fight it,
how can you hope to? Turn back. Turn back before it is too late!"
Thus fear. And love answered, "Go on! Go on! At whatever peril to
yourself, you must go on. Bob will die if you do not. Bob will
die." Love, conquering fear. <i>"Go on before it is too
late."</i></p>

<p>She reached the last tiny rise at last, hesitated a moment,
shuddering with cold dread, took the final step that brought her up
and over the summit. Stopped again.</p>

<p>The desert pitched more steeply than it had climbed, so that it
descended into a vast hollow filled with moon glow, ghostly,
evanescent. It seemed brighter here, and momentarily Ann could see
nothing but that all-pervading, silver-grey radiance investing sky
and earth alike with brooding mystery. Then she made out the grey
bowl of sand merging with the grey bowl of the heavens so that
their joining was indiscernible. Far at the other side of the
hollow, a maze of darker lines resolved themselves into gaunt,
shattered timbers hazily outlining what once had been houses,
dwellings.</p>

<p>Like silhouetted skeletons they rose, those ghastly beams, like
stripped skeletons of a dead town. Here a tall chimney leaned
askew, still faithful to a hearth that never again would gather
about itself laughter and merriment. There the collapsed roof-poles
of a more ambitious structure stabbed through a space that must
have been a dance-hall, perhaps the very dance-hall Dan Horvay had
cleaned out one mad and brawling night...</p>

<p>Ann's gaze pulled away from the ghostly town, pulled nearer.
Midway across the lower plain an angular-edged black blot lay
athwart the shifting, luminous sands, somehow incongruous to the
color-drained, incorporeal, dreamlike scene. This was the long
barracks, Ann guessed, erected by the men Bob had sent to prepare
the mine for its reopening, the men who had been driven away from
here by some supernal terror. And her heart leaped as she saw, in
the ebony side of it facing her, a yellow oblong flash out, an
oblong of light, and across it shadows moved.</p>

<p>Someone had been left behind! Someone alive! Someone who could
help her! The girl forgot her dread in exultation, sprang into
motion. She was running down the side of the hill, her lips formed
to a call...</p>

<p>The call was never uttered. Ann's heels dug into the sand,
braked her to a halt. Her hand came up to her frozen lips, stifling
that cry. A nightmare paralysis held her rigid on the hillside, and
the affrighted blood fled the surfaces of her body, sought the
warmth of her pounding heart. Only her eyes were alive, only her
fear-widened, aching eyes that were focused on something that
moved, there ahead of her in the phantasmal sand, something that
crawled slowly toward her with loathsome life.</p>

<p>It was movement only, at first, and the lengthening shadow of a
mesquite bush. Then an arm writhed into the lunar luminance, a
long, shudderingly emaciated arm, livid and ghastly. It lifted
inches from the ground, dropped, and the tentacular, fleshless
fingers of its hand hooked into the dirt, dug deep, pulled, pulled
head and body after it, out of the shadow.</p>

<p>A head! But it was a gargoylesque mask, livid, hatchet-edged,
sunken-socketed. The head of a thing long dead, of a woman long
dead, crawling out from the shadow on her belly, crawling with slow
malevolence toward the staring, motionless Ann.</p>

<p>Bedraggled, grey hair was stringy about that dreadful
countenance. Clearly in the moon glow Ann saw saliva drool from
between lips drawn back to reveal blued and toothless gums. In the
awful visage there was no expression, no sign of human
intelligence, so that that which slithered toward her seemed a
soulless, imbecile thing, utterly brainless. But then the dragging,
prostrate body came fully out into such light as there was, and a
vagrant beam struck deep into the abysmal pits under the livid
brow, and red hate stared out at Ann.</p>

<p>Power over her limbs came back to the girl in that moment, power
to whirl, to run from the inexorable advance of that crawling,
hateful, mindless thing. Sand spurted from beneath her feet. She
plunged back up the slope down which she had come with hope and
relief flaring within her. A queer low wail rose from behind
her...</p>

<p>Abruptly the hillcrest before her changed form, took on an
outline that halted her in her tracks and wrenched a groan of
ineffable fear from her parched throat. For another crawling
creature seethed over the ridge, rustled slowly through the sand!
Another gargoyle face peered at her with mad hate, the face of a
man this time, pitted and scarred and with its flesh sloughed away
as though the owner had been rejected from a nameless grave!...</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE WHIP</h2>

<p class="first">THE horror slithered fearsomely down with a dread
leisureliness that told how sure it was of its prey, how certain it
was that it had cut her off. The woman behind, the man
ahead&mdash;and Ann knew, knew without looking, without daring to
look, that more of the crawling things were closing in on her from
all sides, that they had enclosed her in a ring from which there
was no escape!</p>

<p>Terror was a living thing in her breast, a thing that tore
upward to her throat and burst from her mouth, in a piercing,
shrill shriek she had not willed. Again she screamed...</p>

<p>A shout from below whirled her around, a deep-throated shout
that somehow she knew had responded to her outcry. The woman who
crawled was nearer, fearfully nearer, though Ann had been certain
she had out sped the creature's slow advance. But beyond her,
whence the resonant shout came again, a second oblong of light
broke the black expanse of the barracks, an opened door&mdash;and
in it was framed a tall thin figure that stood there peering
out.</p>

<p>That <i>stood!</i> The girl's whirling brain seized on that fact
to distinguish the newcomer from the ringing grey creepers who
closed about to capture her for an unguessable fate. <i>He was
erect!</i></p>

<p><i>"Help!"</i> she shrieked. <i>"Help!"</i></p>

<p>The man's head jerked to her. Though he was only a slim black
silhouette against the saffron luminance, Ann knew he must see her
plainly. "Help!" she cried again.</p>

<p>He was motionless, and the woman was crawling always closer, and
behind her Ann could hear the approach of the snaking man as sand
sifted away from beneath his crawling advance. Oh, Mother of Mercy!
"Help! Save me!"</p>

<p>An ululation of sound burst over the desert, a long-drawn
crescendo filled with threat, with unspeakable menace. It stabbed
the girl's brain with new terror, chilled her, rocked her with a
veritable apotheosis of fear. It rose to an apex of quivering
sound, cut short&mdash;and the silence that followed it was a-quake
with the awful recollection...</p>

<p>Good Lord! Ann came up out of the bottomless sea of horror into
which that cry had plunged her and was startlingly aware that the
desert crawlers no longer advanced upon her, that they were gone,
completely gone&mdash;as though they had been figments of her own
distorted imaginings! Oh, Mother of Mercy! Was that truly what they
had been? She shuddered at the appalling thought. They had seemed
real, so real, and now they were vanished. Was she...?</p>

<p>No! She would not even phrase that question to herself. They had
been real, too real. And there was covert enough for them to have
hidden now, covert enough in the black pools of shadow cast by
mesquite and cactus, in the rolling, uneven terrain. That's what it
was, of course. They were hiding...</p>

<p>Let it be enough that they no longer slid toward her, that their
dreadful bodies writhed no longer toward her, that their skinny
arms no longer reached for her with soul-shattering menace.</p>

<p>The man in the doorway beckoned to her. Had the strange outcry
that had banished the grey creepers come from him? Ann started to
him&mdash;froze once more. Who was he? What was he? Why was he here
in this camp from which terror had driven all others? What mastery
did he hold over the crawling people? Was he one of them? Fear
flamed within her. She whipped around to run away, to run back to
Bob...</p>

<p>But slowly she turned back. Bob was injured, dying perhaps. Down
there was water for Bob, help for him. She must go down there,
whatever the peril, to get it for him. She had promised him to
return with help.</p>

<p>She drew a long breath into her tortured, aching lungs, and
willed herself to move. Then she was running down the hill, through
the sand, running the gauntlet of the weird creatures she knew must
be all about her, though she could see no trace of them. She was
running interminably while the very soul within her cringed with
fear that this instant, or <i>this,</i> would bring the clutch of
bony fingers at her ankle, would see a crawling, slimy creature
spring up at her out of the very ground.</p>

<p>Incredulously, Ann reached the open door, plunged through. She
whipped around as it banged shut behind her, as the tall man
rattled a bolt into its socket. She stood gasping, shuddering, as
he turned to her&mdash;and smiled.</p>

<p>"Hello," the man said. "You're Mrs. Travers, I know. I'm Haldon
Kane, your foreman. Where is Mr. Travers?"</p>

<p>Ann gasped, catching her breath. "He's out on the desert, hurt.
We've got to get help to him, quickly. A truck came over the hill,
driven by a maniac, and wrecked us, broke Bob's ankle.
He's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A truck. That must have been ours. Damn those fellows!" The
oath ripped from between thin lips in a long, horse face. "When
they've got their skins full of white mule they <i>are</i> a bunch
of raving maniacs. I sent them down to Axton to get them away from
here so you wouldn't have to hear their caterwauls your first night
in camp, and that's what they've done."</p>

<p>"They&mdash;they looked scared to me." The explanation had been
too pat. "As if they were running away from something."</p>

<p>"Sure they were," Kane responded smoothly. "Running away from
the beatings I'd promised them if they were here when you and Mr.
Travers arrived."</p>

<p>A dark suit, complete with coat and vest and white collar,
clothed his slender frame. Ann could not quite picture him
victorious in a hand-to-hand tussle with the stalwarts of the
truck. "But we oughtn't to leave Mr. Travers alone any longer than
necessary," he said. "I'll jump in the flivver and fetch him."</p>

<p>"You have a car! How lucky! Come on." Ann started to the door.
"He was delirious when I left him. We've got to get to him
quickly."</p>

<p>Kane was somehow in her way, though he had not seemed to move.
"It won't take the two of us, Mrs. Travers. Hadn't you better stay
here and get things ready? Put up water to heat on the range?" He
gestured vaguely toward the end of a long door-walled corridor that
appeared to bisect the barracks. "Tear up some sheets into bandages
and so on? From what you tell me he's going to need plenty of
attention, and we ought to be ready to act quickly."</p>

<p>"But I can't stay here alone." Panic flared up in Ann once more.
"Those awful creatures&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Won't bother you here!" The smile was wiped from the foreman's
face, and momentarily a grim ferocity came into it that made the
narrow countenance with its pointed chin somehow Satanic. "Not
here..."</p>

<p>His insistence seemed somehow sinister. "I'm going with you,"
the girl gulped. "I won't stay away from Bob that long."</p>

<p>She tried to shove past him. But his hand was on her arm, his
long-fingered, bony hand. It stopped her. His black, glittering
eyes took hers, were gimlets of black flame boring into her
brain.</p>

<p>"I said you are safe in here. I'll go bond for that. But if you
put one foot over this threshold&mdash;" Kane's voice dropped to an
ominous, fearful whisper&mdash;"I could not protect you if I were
the devil himself. The moon and the desert have spawned evil,
prowling things out there, and they have scented you, and they are
waiting for you.</p>

<p>"It will do your Bob no good if I save him and he wakes up to
find you&mdash;what you will be when they get through with
you."</p>

<p>Shudders of icy dread shook Ann's slender frame. Kane whipped
around, was through the door. Momentarily Ann was rigid, incapable
of movement, and in that moment the door slammed behind him,
footsteps pounded on hard sand, a motor roared. The girl fought her
hand to the doorknob. The car she heard roared away...</p>

<p>It was too late. He was gone, Kane was gone. And she was alone,
alone in the hollow with&mdash;the foul spawn of the desert!
Surging terror jerked her hand to the bolt, raided it home...</p>

<p>For a long time Ann remained in the grip of a nightmare
paralysis, staring unseeingly at the rough-planed panels of the
door. What was Kane? What was his power over the crawling horrors
of the sands...?</p>

<p>Or had he any such power? Was she sure, dead sure, that the
eerie cry that had cleared them from her path had come from him? It
had seemed source-less, had seemed to invest the atmosphere from
all directions at once...</p>

<p>But when he returned&mdash;<i>if</i> he returned&mdash;he would
bring Bob with him. She must get ready...</p>

<p>The light here came from a lantern hanging on a hook beside the
entrance. Ann lifted it off, turned to locate herself. The
structure was hastily thrown together; the walls and partitions
were of rough, unpainted lumber, joists and studding not covered.
Angular shadows moved as she moved the lantern, slithered
menacingly. The sharp odor of new-sawed wood stung her nostrils,
mingled with the stench of man-sweat, the rubbery aroma of boots,
the stench of machine-grease, of strong soap, of stale tobacco. The
place was alive with the aura of occupancy, yet it was deathly
silent.</p>

<p>Had Kane pointed to left or right when he spoke of heating water
on the range? Ann could not remember. She would have to look. A
curious reluctance slowed her movements as she reached for the
driven nail serving as knob to the nearest door. What was behind
it? What would she find behind it? She pulled it open.</p>

<p>Light struck into a big room, showed an overturned table, cards
strewn over the floor, a lumber jacket in a heap in the corner, a
smashed chair. Chaos. Had a drink-maddened brawl done this, bearing
out Kane's glib explanation of the flying truck? It might have,
except for one thing. There was no smell of alcohol here, there
were no flasks emptied or full, no glasses of any kind...</p>

<p>The nape of Ann's neck prickled. Something <i>had</i> happened
here. Something that had disrupted an orderly gathering into hasty,
disorganized flight. <i>Something about which Haldon Kane had
lied.</i></p>

<p>But Bob would soon be here. Time later to investigate; now she
must get a bed ready for him, hot water, bandages. A bed! Sheets to
rip for bandages! None here. Maybe in this next room.</p>

<p>No. This was an office, the foreman's office. A rude desk told
her that, a small safe with its door open. Here too were signs of
panicky departure. Blueprints spilling from a rude cupboard in the
corner, a pen stuck point down in the floor, ink blotching the
place where it had stabbed. Papers disorderly on the desk, held
down by&mdash;What <i>was</i> it?</p>

<p>Ann took a step nearer, lifting her lantern to throw a stronger
light. The black, slender thing coiled ominously on the table-top,
ended in a thicker, wire-wound handle. It was a whip, a
short-handled, cruel whip. A bull-whip such as she had seen
mule-freighters use, in the borax mines on the journey here. But
they had no mules here, no oxen...The end of the lash trailed over
the further edge of the desk, was hidden by it. Oddly fascinated,
the girl circled till she could see it.</p>

<p>The long lash ended in a snapper, a barbed thing such as she had
seen raise welts on the tough skin of a mule. This one glistened in
the light. A drop formed, dripped off, splashed on the floor. It
was a frayed disk of red on the planed board. It was a splotch of
blood!</p>

<p>An iron band constricted Ann's temples, and the floor heaved
under her feet.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; WHERE HORROR FED</h2>

<p class="first">FROM somewhere came a muffled roar. Ann's head
jerked up. It was the sound of a motor laboring, pounding against
the clogging desert sand. Kane was coming back. Had he found Bob?
Was he bringing Bob back with him?</p>

<p>The girl whirled, her feet pounded wood. She reached the outer
door, rattled the bolt free, grabbed for the knob, twisted it and
pushed...</p>

<p>The door would not open. Somehow it had jammed. The car sound
was louder now, was right outside. Ann pushed again, threw her
weight against the portal. It was immovable.</p>

<p>Good God! It hadn't jammed. It was locked! Locked from the
outside!</p>

<p>The car didn't stop! Mother of Mercy, it hadn't stopped! It had
passed; its noise was growing fainter, was dying down. Was it some
other car than Kane's, perhaps? Or...?</p>

<p>Ann beat small fists on the wood, pounded till her hands were
bruised and bleeding. "Bob!" she screamed. "Bob!"</p>

<p>Something like a laugh answered her, a mocking laugh, muffled by
wall and by distance. There was a window somewhere on this side of
the structure, a window from which light had glowed. The frantic
girl twisted away from the locked door, toward it.</p>

<p>Then she was at it, was peering out through glass. Her own face
stared back at her from blackness. The lantern glared behind it.
The lantern! Of course! Its light was stronger than that outside,
was making a mirror of the pane.</p>

<p>Whimpering, Ann smashed the lamp to the floor, reckless of fire.
She could see through now, could see the desert spectral in the
moonlight, could just see a dilapidated, open flivver plowing
toward the gaunt timbers of the ghost town. Someone was hunched
over the wheel, and beside him a body folded limp over the car
side, its arms hanging down, its hands just touching the
running-board. Bob!</p>

<p>The window was framed glass; its sash did not lift. The girl
flailed at it with her bare hands. Glass splintered, crashed. Her
fingers were bloody, her knuckles gashed. She plucked shards from
their hold in the frame, uncaring. She lifted to the high sill,
squirmed through. Jagged edges of broken glass caught at her, tore
her frock. She dropped to the sand outside, sprawled. Then she
exploded to her feet and was running toward the ruins of
Deadhope.</p>

<p>Down there, where those skeleton timbers affronted the sky,
nothing stirred. Nothing at all. While she had battered at the
window the laboring car had vanished into nothingness as the
crawlers had vanished. She could see it no longer, could no longer
hear it. But she could see the tracks it had left in the desert,
long tracks reaching clear into the mazed shadows of the skeleton
village. She could follow them. Staggering, stumbling, reeling, she
could follow them to where Bob had been taken.</p>

<p>The soft sand sifted from beneath her flying feet, gave no
footing. Even through her desperation, her frenzy of anxiety for
her husband, her soul-sapping fear for him and for herself, the
feeling of eerie unreality flooded back on her that first had
manifested itself when she awoke in the car to see a world flooded
by ghostly moonlight. The naked timbers ahead seemed to retreat as
she ran, as if she were spurning a treadmill beneath her, an
eternally wheeling treadmill on which she would run forever and
make no headway. Pain strapped her leg muscles, stabbed her
bursting lungs. Yet somehow she seemed no nearer her goal. No
nearer...</p>

<p>The pallid desert all about her was blotched by shadows that
weirdly were other than shadows. The sands shimmered like water
under the moonlight, like water furrowed by the wind, swirling into
a whirlpool. Ann gasped, halted her headlong rush, her heels
digging into the silt, her eyes staring. There was a circular, wide
wallow here where the desert had been plowed up, torn, trampled by
some terrific struggle. As though some great beast&mdash;or some
man&mdash;had fought here long and unavailingly against a ravening
something that had dragged him down at last.</p>

<p>Yes, here was the mark of shod feet and
here&mdash;blood-darkened&mdash;the depression his body had made
when it had come down. The shifting sand had kept the shape of the
impact because it had been wetted&mdash;wetted red by life-fluid
spurting from severed veins. And from this spot a long furrow
started to run along with the tire-tracks Ann followed! Vividly, as
if the tragedy were being reenacted before her pulsing eyes, the
girl could see what had made it: the gore-bathed corpse pouring
blood; the slimy, crawling things dragging their victim to their
lair...</p>

<p>The record was plainly written&mdash;too plainly&mdash;in the
sand. No wonder they had fled in crazed terror from this dire
hollow, the half-mad men in the truck. No wonder they had not dared
to stop when Bob&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bob!</i> Oh, God! He was somewhere in there, somewhere in the
ruined town ahead to which the crawlers had dragged their prey!
Ann's larynx clamped on a scream, and she was running once more,
was following the twin tracks of the flivver in which Bob's limp
body had been, was following the blood-darkened furrow that
gibbered at her an awful promise of what it was to which her lover
had been taken.</p>

<p>On and on, endlessly, she ran, till&mdash;suddenly&mdash;barred
shadows fell across her and she leapt aside, panting...</p>

<p>It was only the shadow of a tumbledown house, stripped of its
siding. Others clustered around, the rotted skeletons of a vanished
town, the fleshless bones of Deadhope! But where was the flivver?
Where was Bob?</p>

<p>The girl reeled, paused, gasping for breath. She staggered
against a rotting beam, clung to it, gagging, retching. Her heart
pounded against her heaving ribs as though it would break through
the thin confining wall of her chest. She lifted a hand to her
breast to still it, felt paper rustle under her hand. Paper! The
formulae of Bob's process. Bob's secret.</p>

<p><i>Bob's secret!</i> Dizzy, nauseated, afraid, the thought
pounded into Ann's brain. <span class="smcap"><i>Bob's
secret!</i></span> <i>She must keep it safe.</i> She glanced around
with eyes crafty, not wholly sane. No one was in sight. The jumbled
beams against which she leaned screened her from observation. Here
were two that made a cross, an <i>inverted cross,</i> and beneath
them was another that lay close to the ground so that there was
only a slit beneath it. Ann clawed at her bosom, clawed out the
precious envelope, shoved it under that beam. There was no sign of
digging to betray that cache, but the envelope was out of sight and
it was marked by a sign she would not forget. The sign of the
inverted cross. <i>The sign of Satan.</i></p>

<p>The momentary rest somewhat restored her. She could breathe
again and her vision had cleared. There were the tracks, the rutted
tracks of the car that had carried her Bob, winding among the
strewn timbers of the ghost town. And there, still marching with
them, was the grim furrow dug by that which had been dragged here.
Ann's eyes followed that grisly spoor, probed a pool of shadow,
some fifty feet ahead, to which it led.</p>

<p>It wasn't a shadow! It was a grey-black shapeless mound in the
barred moon glow, a mound that heaved restlessly, a mound that was
animate with gruesome life. Through the desert hush sounds came
clearly to Ann, smacking sounds, low whimperings, <i>the scrape of
a gnawing tooth on bone.</i> That gruesome shape was feeding! <i>On
what?</i></p>

<p>A hand squeezed Ann's heart, and an awful fear sheathed her with
quivering cold. The furrow of the dragged corpse led straight to
that squirming; pile, and the tracks of the car in which Bob had
been brought here! What was it that composed that grisly meal?</p>

<p>Sound rasped through the girl's cramped larynx. A whine, a
whimper&mdash;it was not a word. It was not anything one could have
recognized as human speech. But perhaps He understood it. He to
whom that prayer of a woman's tortured soul was spoken. Perhaps He
knew that the racked brain of the devoted wife was saying, over and
over: "God! Dear God! It isn't Bob. It isn't It can't be.
<i>Please, God, don't let it be Bob."</i></p>

<p>Perhaps he heard and touched that loathly tumulus with his
finger. Perhaps Ann's sob of agony and dread reached the ghastly
feeders. At any rate, the heaving mass split apart. Grey,
earth-hugging forms slithered away from it, like satiated vermin
from their putrid feast, slithered through the sand, out of range
of Ann's vision. She did not see where they went, saw nothing but
the motionless something to which her burning gaze clung, that
which they had left behind. A nausea retched her stomach, but she
could not see&mdash;she could not be certain what it was at which
she stared.</p>

<p>She could not be certain, and she had to be. She pushed herself
away from the beam against which she leaned, took a reeling step
toward&mdash;toward the motionless, awfully motionless
<i>debris</i> ahead. Her legs, water-weak, buckled, and she tumbled
headlong into the sand.</p>

<p>She moaned, and then was crawling toward <i>it,</i> was shoving
palms down into gritty, cutting sand, was lifting herself on
breaking arms, dragging herself onward little by little. And all
the while the dread question grew in her shaken mind like a bubble
blown in acid, burst so that she did not know why she crawled, and
grew again.</p>

<p>Time was a grey nothingness that flowed over her. The anguish of
her ripped hands, of her torn knees, was a pulsing torment she did
not feel. She was mumbling, "Not Bob. God. Not Bob," and she did
not know what it was she said nor why she said it. But she kept
going, eternally, hitching through the sand, dragging the agony of
her body and her soul to a destination she had forgotten but that
she knew she must reach.</p>

<p>The pallid desert must have pitied her then, the desert and the
shadows that moved on its spectral breast and were not shadows.
Even they must have pitied her, the leprous-faced horrors that
crawled&mdash;or did They think her one of them, this
tatter-clothed, crawling woman with the contorted features of
dementia and the eyes glowing red with madness? At any rate they
let her pass unscathed until her out-reaching hand fell upon
something that was not sand, something that rolled and left a red,
wet stain on the sand where it had lain.</p>

<p>The clammy, shuddersome feel of the thing upon which Ann's hand
had fallen shocked her back to reason. To reason and the flooding
horror of her search. She shoved up on extended arms, arching her
back; she looked dazedly about her.</p>

<p>Madness pulsed in her once more as she stared at that which the
crawlers had left&mdash;at tattered, gnawed flesh; at a torso from
whose ribs meat hung in frayed strips, at a skull that had been
scraped quite clean so that the grinning bone glowed whitely in the
lunar rays. And everywhere on the pitiful remnants that once had
been human were the marks of teeth, of <i>human teeth!</i></p>

<p>But even through the swirling blackness that mounted in her
brain, the gibbering question still screamed its query. Who was it?
Bob? Was it Bob? How could she tell? How could she tell when there
was no face left on this, no skin?</p>

<p>Whimpering, Ann looked hopelessly down at that upon which her
hand still rested. It was a bone that had been torn loose, a
thigh-bone. Hanging to it by a shred of ligament was the long
calf-bone, bits of flesh still adhering, and the foot was quite
untouched. The foot! The <i>right</i> foot!</p>

<p>Ann remembered. It was Bob's <i>right</i> ankle that had been
broken!</p>

<p>And this&mdash;right ankle was&mdash;whole!</p>

<p>Oh, God! Oh, thank God!</p>

<p>Something gave way within Ann and she slid down and down into
weltering, merciful blackness...</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">SOMEONE was shaking her. Someone was whispering,
"Mrs. Travers. Mrs. Travers. Wake up."</p>

<p>Someone was bending over her. Ann's eyes came open, and she saw
Kane's narrow face in the moonlight, its lips writhing. Somehow she
was on her feet. Bone crunched under her heel, but she did not
notice it. Her hands shot out, gripped the lapels of Kane's
coat.</p>

<p>"Where is Bob?" she shrilled. "What have you done with him?"</p>

<p>Strong fingers clutched her wrists, tore them away. "Come out of
here," Kane said. "Quickly."</p>

<p>A howl sliced across the words, a howl of animal threat. Arms
went around her and lifted her, cradled her. The man was running,
breathing hard, was plunging through the vague moonlight that
glowed around them. Ann twisted around in the arms that carried
her, saw Kane's face above her, sharper, more Satanic than ever as
its eyes slitted dangerously, as lips curled away from dull-white,
huge teeth in a narrow mouth.</p>

<p>She beat at his breast with futile thrusts. "Where's Bob?"</p>

<p>He carried her across the silvered desert, carried her toward
the black bulk of the barracks. "I don't&mdash;know," he gritted.
"I don't know."</p>

<p>Ann squirmed, fighting to get free. The grip of his arms was
unrelenting, inescapable. "You lie," she spat at him. "What have
you done with him?"</p>

<p>"I'm not lying," the man grunted. "He wasn't there when I found
the wreck. He was gone."</p>

<p>Fury was a red flame swirling in Ann's brain. "You lie," she
screeched again. "You've got him somewhere in there, somewhere in
Deadhope. I saw your flivver pass the house and I saw him in
it."</p>

<p>"My&mdash;flivver?" The nostrils of his tremendous hooked nose
flared, and white spots showed in the thin-drawn skin on either
side of it. "Not mine. I have no flivver. Look, this is my
car."</p>

<p>They had reached the entrance to the barracks. A car puffed
before it, the engine running. It was an old Dodge sedan! A Dodge?
A sedan! But the car Ann had seen dart past and vanish into the
barred shadows of the ghost town had been a Model T. It had been a
touring car in which Kane had brought back Bob's horribly limp
body...</p>

<p>Wait! She had not seen the driver clearly. Was it Kane? She
could not be certain. Oh, God! She <i>was not</i> certain it had
been Kane.</p>

<p>"He was gone when I got there," Haldon Kane said again. Ann had
ceased struggling. He set her down. But he had to support her as
they took the few further steps to the barracks door, so weak she
was from exhaustion, from terror and wild anxiety. "I found the
overturned roadster, the cushions by its side on which he had lain.
But no one. No one living..."</p>

<p>There was a curious emphasis on the last word. Ann twisted to
him. "Living! Then there was..."</p>

<p>A veil dropped across the glitter of his eyes. His free hand
made a curious gesture, as if he were pushing something away from
him, something revolting. "Never mind that." His lips seemed to
move not at all. "It isn't&mdash;important." Then, "Mr. Travers was
not there. But I don't understand&mdash;you said you saw him in a
flivver, saw someone taking him down to the old town?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The monosyllable hissed from between Ann's compressed
lips, as she fought to expel a grisly speculation from the
maelstrom of her mind. "I heard it, saw it. But it disappeared down
there&mdash;as though it were&mdash;something unreal." They had
reached the barracks door. She twisted to Kane, fear of the
crawlers forgotten in a greater fear. "But you must have seen it,
too! It had to pass you."</p>

<p>"No." A muscle twitched in his hollow cheek. "No. I saw nothing.
Nothing passed me." The response dripped dully into a crystal
sphere of heartlessness that seemed suddenly to enclose the girl.
"Nothing. No one."</p>

<p>A shadow moved out in the desert, sand slithered. Kane's pupils
flickered to it. His hand darted to the doorknob&mdash;and the
portal swung open effortlessly. But it had been
locked&mdash;locked&mdash;minutes before!</p>

<p>He shouldered Ann through, came into the dark hallway himself
and had the barrier shut in one smooth flow of movement. Red worms
of fear crawled in his eyes.</p>

<p>"That's better," he breathed. A pale, eerie luminance sifted in
through the window Ann had smashed, flowed over him, showed a
toothy smile that was palpably forced on his narrow face. "Better.
But where's the lantern?"</p>

<p>Ann jerked a pointing hand to it, where it had guttered out.
"I&mdash;dropped it."</p>

<p>Kane flashed a curious glance at her, then at the lantern. From
that to the smashed window. "Have to get that fixed," he snapped.
"At once."</p>

<p>Then he was gone!</p>

<p>The girl was startled. Then she realized that as she
automatically had followed the direction of his glance he had
soundlessly taken the one necessary step into the foreman's office,
had closed its door. She heard his footsteps moving about, heard
the rasp of a pulled-out drawer, heard a dull thud as if something
heavy had dropped. Then there was no sound in there, no sound at
all...</p>

<p>Minutes dragged past as Ann stared with widened eyes at the
blank wood. Coils seemed to tighten about her, gelid coils of
nameless dread. Certainty grew upon her that something had happened
to Kane in there&mdash;something that all the time he had feared.
It was her fault. <i>Hers!</i> In breaking the window to gain exit
she had breached his defenses, had made a way for something to
enter&mdash;something that had lurked in the darkness of that
room...</p>

<p>She backed, inch by slow inch, till she felt the outer door
pressing against her. Her hand lifted behind her, her fingers found
and closed about the knob. She turned it, pushed, her apprehensive
gaze still fixed ahead.</p>

<p>A faint breath of air stirred in through the slitted opening she
had made, and with it came a vague, hissing sound. The whispering
voice of the desert? <i>Or the sound of the crawlers, closing
in?</i> Panic scorched her breast, was a living flame in her brain.
She pulled to the door, shot its bolt with shaking, bloodless
fingers. Fearful, horribly fearful as she was of what <i>might</i>
lie in the secret silence of the room from whose entrance her gaze
had never wavered, she was more terrified still of the creeping
things she <i>knew</i> prowled the sands. She dared not go out
there again. She dared not stay here, not knowing with what peril
she was housed.</p>

<p>Ann whimpered, far back in her throat. She could not remain
forever rigid in the grip of an icy fear. She must&mdash;do
something&mdash;or in minutes she would&mdash;go mad.</p>

<p>There was no sound in the darkly brooding barracks. No movement.
There couldn't be anything, living, in there. She must know what
had happened to Kane. At all costs she must know. Or&mdash;give
herself over to gibbering madness.</p>

<p>She forced unwilling limbs across the narrow corridor. Its
nail-handle was hot to her frigid clutch. The door came creakingly
open. Her body blocked light from the obscurity within, but
something lumped on the floor ahead, a shapeless something that was
fearfully still. Ann fought herself over that dread threshold, into
the gloom...</p>

<p>A shadow came alive, swooped down on her, engulfed her! Not a
shadow, but cloth, black cloth enveloping her, smothering her,
clamping her threshing arms, her flailing legs, clamping tight and
holding her immobile. She was being lifted from her feet, was being
carried off. And through the thick, blinding folds of the shrouding
fabric a laugh sounded, a hollow mocking laugh, the laugh that she
had heard while a battered flivver had chugged past with Bob, with
her limp and broken husband.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; DESPAIR UNDERGROUND</h2>

<p class="first">ANN could fight no longer. Bruised, battered, her
soft flesh torn, her brain a whirl of agony and terror, she sagged,
strengthless, flaccid. Consciousness shrank to a minute spark in
the vast, dark limbo of her fear. Terror piled on terror, fear on
fear, had brought her at last to that ultimate point where her
distracted mind must find refuge within an enclave of numbed,
despairing acceptance of horror or be wholly shattered.</p>

<p>She was only dimly aware that the arms encircling the bundle
they had made of her were so powerful that they handled her weight
with utter ease. Only vaguely did she feel shambling, level
progress. It did not matter now what became of her, now that Bob
was dead...</p>

<p>But she did not <i>know</i> that Bob was dead. Perhaps he was
still alive. Perhaps she was being taken to him now, to the place
where he had been <i>taken.</i> Hope stored within her&mdash;a
faint thread of pitiful hope that again she might be near him,
might see his face, might for an instant press her lips to his dear
mouth before she died. But <i>was</i> it to death she was being
borne? To merciful death?</p>

<p>And once more she was awake to ineffable fear, to grueling
terror. If that which was carrying her off, human or ghoul, desired
only death of her, he could easily have killed her in the same
unguarded moment that he had overcome her. He had not.
<i>Why?</i></p>

<p>Neither this searing, dreadful query nor the faint hope that
preceded it was destined yet to be answered. Quite suddenly Ann
felt herself deposited on some soft, high pallet. A slow chuckle
came muted to her ears, and the shambling footfalls faded away.
Then silence enfolded her once more, and helpless dread.</p>

<p>The girl lay lax, straining to catch some murmur of sound. She
heard only the <i>pud, pud</i> of her own pulse. Had her captor
gone off? Was whatever doom that lay in store for her
postponed?</p>

<p>Ann chanced tentative movement, held her breath as she waited
for its effect. Nothing happened. Strangely, this was more
frightening than a heavy-handed rebuke, a threatening voice, would
have been. She was alone. He had left her alone. How sure he must
be of his power to have done that, of the impossibility of her
rescue!</p>

<p>Rescue! Who was there to rescue her? Kane? Haldon Kane lay dead
on the office floor. She had seen him, had seen in the gloom a
mound of blacker black that must have been he, lying lifeless.</p>

<p>Even in her extremity of dread, Ann found time to regret her
suspicions of the man, her certainty that it had been he who had
vanished with Bob into the ghost town, that he was the master of
the creepers. She realized now that the crawling fear she had felt
in his presence had been the contagion of <i>his</i> fear. The man
had been afraid, had been as terror-stricken as those who had
careened in mad flight from this doomed hollow in the desert. But
he had remained, faithful to his charge&mdash;had remained here to
guard the mine for herself and Bob and had met the death he feared
in doing so.</p>

<p>What was that sound? During interminable minutes Ann had tossed,
had struggled unavailingly to free herself of the muffling fabric
which held her rigid, had twisted, jerked, fought until sheer
exhaustion had forced her to quit. Then for an endless time she had
lain quiescent, gathering strength to struggle again...</p>

<p>It was close at hand&mdash;the slow slither of a heavy body
through sand, the almost imperceptible hiss of labored breathing.
It came closer, and Ann was quivering, the cold sweat of terror
dewing her forehead, her breasts aching with its agony. They had
her at last, the crawlers, the belly-creeping, snaking Things with
the form of humans and the dead eyes of the damned. At last they
had come for her, and she was helpless to escape them.</p>

<p>A hand prodded her, fumbled along the fabric within which she
was muffled. Ann drew in breath through the constricted cords of
her throat. The sound it made was a screeching, sharp-edged
squeal.</p>

<p>"Hush," a muted voice hissed warningly. "Hush."</p>

<p>Fever ran hotly through Ann's veins, exploded within her skull.
Good&mdash;Lord! Who was it that warned her to silence? Whose hands
were they that groped down her flanks, that pulled, tugged at the
lashings about her ankles? Bob's? Oh, Merciful God! Could it be
Bob, escaped somehow, come somehow to find her, to release her from
terror?...</p>

<p>The bag pulled up over her ankles, her knees, stripped up over
her torso, caught momentarily under her chin and then was entirely
gone. Ann squirmed, twisted about, gasped. Closed her lips on the
glad "Bob!" that had almost escaped them.</p>

<p>This wasn't Bob's face, this gaunt, long countenance silhouetted
against dim moon-glow in a broken-arched aperture across which a
shattered beam&mdash;sprawled. It&mdash;wasn't&mdash;Bob's. Hope
seeped out of her, almost life itself.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she gulped. "I thought it was my husband."</p>

<p>"Quiet," Kane breathed. "Quiet, Mrs. Travers, or we may be
heard." His lips were paler, tighter, his eyes more narrowly
slitted, more piercing. A curious excitement danced in them. "I've
taken an awful chance tracing you here. We're both in terrible
danger and you must not make it worse."</p>

<p>"What is it? Who is it that's doing all this? What terrible
things are happening here?" Pushing herself up, Ann whispered the
questions. "I won't move till I know."</p>

<p>"For God's sake!" he groaned, his pupils flicking into the
darkness beyond her. "If it is known that I am still alive, that I
have freed you..." His gesture finished the sentence. "We've got to
get out of here." His skin was fish-belly grey with&mdash;was it
fear...? "Come. Hurry."</p>

<p>The urgency of his speech, his evident terror, got through to
Ann. Once more he had risked his life to save her. She had no right
to impede him now. And yet...</p>

<p>"Can you walk?" His left arm reached for her. Odd how long and
slender his hand was, how it clawed vulture-like. Odd that his
right should be concealed behind his back. <i>What was it he hid
from her?</i></p>

<p>Ann avoided his grasp. He had fought for her, sided with her. He
was her only hope for safety. She must be mad indeed to shudder
with revulsion from his touch as though he were something
unclean.</p>

<p>"I can walk," she muttered. "You needn't help me."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, then." He turned toward the radiance-silvered
opening, pointed with a preternaturally long, straight finger.
"I'll follow."</p>

<p>A tocsin of alarm sounded deep within Ann at the thought of
letting him get behind her. But she could not refuse. She slid by
him, shrinking; she almost reached the light.</p>

<p>"Wait!" Kane spat. "Wait."</p>

<p>Ann twisted. "What...?" she gasped. "What is it?"</p>

<p>He was startlingly close, towered gauntly gigantic above her.
"We may not get through." His voice was a husked whisper. "If you
have anything you wouldn't want found, any&mdash;papers, for
instance, give them to me. I'll hide them here."</p>

<p>"Papers!" the girl blurted. "I&mdash;" She bit off the words.
Good Lord! Why should he ask that now? Her mouth was suddenly dry.
"I&mdash;I don't know what you're talking about." <i>How would he
know that she carried any papers unless he had wrung the
information from Bob?</i> "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>There was a subtle change in Kane's face. Through their slits
his eyes were ablaze with a strange eagerness; the long lines from
their corners to his strangely pointed chin had deepened. "Travers
was bringing out the formulae for his new process. They weren't in
the luggage in your car, and&mdash;" He checked himself, tried
again. "And..."</p>

<p>"And he didn't have them on him!" Ann almost shrieked the
accusation. "You've searched him! It <i>was</i> you that brought
him in." She leaped at him, her hooked fingers clawing at his
saturnine eyes. "What have you done with him?"</p>

<p>Kane's hidden hand leaped into view. In mid-spring Ann saw the
whip in it, butt reversed. The wire-wound handle crashed across the
side of her head, sent her down.</p>

<p>She sprawled, half-stunned, and Kane bent to her. His whip hand
pinned her to the ground; the other was on her thighs, was
scrabbling frantically over her body, was violating the privacy of
her breasts. "Where are they?" he snarled. "Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Where you can't get them," Ann mouthed. "Murderer!"</p>

<p>His countenance now was utterly Satanic. "You've hidden them,
damn you," he spat. "You've hidden them."</p>

<p>"Yes." There was nothing left to her now but defiance. "Yes.
I've hidden them where you'll never find them."</p>

<p>His hands gripped her shoulders, shook her, worried her as a
terrier a rat. "Tell me where they are," he snarled. "Where are
they?"</p>

<p>"I'll&mdash;never&mdash;tell," Ann said as he shook her. "You
can&mdash;kill me&mdash;and I won't&mdash;tell."</p>

<p>"You'll tell!" Kane surged erect. The whip in his hand lashed
up, swished above his head. "You'll tell." It whistled down,
coiling, writhing like a thing alive.</p>

<p>Screaming, Ann rolled from under just as it pounded down on the
spot where she had been. Dust spurted as the snapper at the lash's
end dug dirt. Kane snarled once more and jerked his terrible weapon
up again.</p>

<p>Terror exploded in Ann, blasted her to her feet in a
lightning-swift splurge of effort that had its impetus from
something other than her will. The snakelike lash whipped around
her legs, seared from her a shriek of purest agony. It jerked,
swept her footing from under her. The girl crashed down. The whip
jerked free and curled above Kane's head for another blow. Savagely
his arm arced down.</p>

<p>But the lash did not descend. It tautened, jerked the whip butt
from Kane's hand. The button-like snapper had caught in some
inequality of the dark roof. A bestial snarl spat from Kane's
twisted mouth; he whirled savagely and snatched at the thong as it
swung from some hidden fastening. It pendulumed, avoided his first
rage-blinded grab. Ann writhed away into the darkness, pitched over
the edge of a steep incline.</p>

<p>Somehow she was on her feet. An animal bellow from behind
catapulted her into hurtling speed. Footsteps pounded behind her.
The descent pitched steeply and now she was more falling than
running. Her footing was no longer sliding sand. It was a flooring
of small stones that rolled beneath her, that threw her suddenly
sidewise.</p>

<p>One flailing arm struck a wall; she gathered herself for the
crash of her body against it. That crash never came and she was
really falling now. She pounded down on&mdash;on something alive
that squealed, that slid out from under her and scuttered away in
the darkness!</p>

<p>The rattling thump of pursuit pounded above her. Passed. Ann lay
in pitch darkness, dazed by the shock of her fall, quivering from
the stinging torment of the whip blows, shuddering with revulsion
at the cold and clammy feel of that upon which she had thumped
down, retching with terror at the prospect of Kane's return. He
must soon realize that she had avoided him by tumbling into some
side passage off the lightless tunnel. He would come back to seek
her. And he would find her there helpless to escape his fury. She
was done, completely exhausted. She could flee no further.</p>

<p>But his pounding footsteps kept on<i>,</i> faded into distance,
into silence. Slow, timorous hope began to grow in the dizzy
turmoil of the girl's mind, matured into certainty. Her blood ran a
little more warmly; strength commenced to seep back, and the
ability to think.</p>

<p>But thought brought despair blacker than the Stygian gloom in
which she lay. Bob was dead, undoubtedly he was dead. Kane had only
half lied when he had said he had found nothing alive at the wreck.
He had <i>left</i> nothing alive! It was Bob's corpse that had
slumped over the side of his flivver, Bob's corpse he had hidden
somewhere here. Somewhere in this underground maze that must be the
workings of the old mine. Somewhere...</p>

<p>A noise cut off thought. A tiny noise, sourceless, almost
inaudible. A sensation of movement rather than of sound, of furtive
movement paralyzingly near. There it was again! The flicker of a
breath. A moan so low that only in the breathless hush of the
underground could it have been heard.</p>

<p>The knowledge that she was not alone, that something alive was
here in the dark with her, brought no fear to Ann. She was beyond
fear. She was beyond emotion. With the conviction that her husband,
her lover, was dead, she too seemed to have died. Only her body was
left&mdash;her aching, torn body&mdash;and her senses. But
something like a dull, dazed curiosity made her strain to locate
that sound, made her wonder what it was that produced it.</p>

<p>The low moan came again, finned into a word. A name! <i>Her</i>
name! "Ann." And then, "Oh, Ann. I'm so sick. So sick."</p>

<p>"Bob!" The girl screamed into reverberating darkness. "Bob!
Where are you? Oh, God! Where are you?"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE CRAWLERS CLOSE
IN</h2>

<p class="first">"ANN!" The voice was so weak, so terribly weak. "I
thought&mdash;you would never&mdash;come back." There was no longer
delirium in Bob's voice, but evidently he was unaware he was no
longer beside the wreck in the desert.</p>

<p>Ann managed speech. "Where are you, Bob? It's so dark I can't
see you." Then he didn't know what was happening. He didn't know
that anything was happening. "Keep on calling."</p>

<p>Pangs of excruciating agony rewarded the girl's effort to turn,
to get going toward him.</p>

<p>"Ann. Here I am." It didn't matter. Nothing mattered except that
Bob was alive, that Bob was restored to her. "I'm here, Ann." She
gritted her teeth, choked to silence a scream of anguish, twisted
over on hands and knees. "Come to me, Ann."</p>

<p>"I'm coming, dear. I'm coming as fast as I can." There was
nothing in her tone to betray the network of fiery pain that meshed
her body. "But it's so dark I can't see you. Keep calling,
Bob..."</p>

<p>There was torture in Bob's accents, torment to match her own.
"I've been calling for hours, Ann. Hours." Sharp stones across
which she crept cut her knees. Her hands were sticky with the blood
oozing from their gashed palms. "Why is it so dark, darling? Where
are the stars?"</p>

<p>Ann's arm reached out for another torturous advance, rasped
against vertical stone. An iron band constricted about her temples,
and a sudden fear tightened her scalp. Her other hand found the
rock-face. She squatted, felt wildly to left and right, groped
above her head. Apprehension firmed to certainty. This was a wall,
a wall of stone right across her path. But Bob's voice came from
right ahead, from beyond that wall!</p>

<p>"Are you coming, Ann?" It sounded clearly, apparently unmuffled
by anything intervening!</p>

<p>"Just a minute, dear. I'm resting." Bob was hurt, weakened by
the awful fever that had swamped his mind in delirium. On no
account must he be frightened. "I must rest, I'm awfully tired." It
took indomitable courage, steel-nerved grit to keep out of her call
the despair that knotted her stomach, the panic that twisted her
breast.</p>

<p>Ann found projections in the rock-face before her, gripped them
and dragged herself erect while all her maltreated body screamed
protest. Leaning against the stone, she groped above her head, high
as she could reach. The barrier was still there, the barrier from
beyond which Bob's voice still sounded with uncanny clearness.
"Ann!"</p>

<p>From the unholy dark that clamped almost tangible oppression
around her, madness once more gibbered its mopping threat at the
tormented girl. This wasn't real! It couldn't be real! Her ears
told her that Bob was right here, right in front of her, so near
that she had only to reach out a hand to touch him&mdash;but that
reaching hand found only cold, damp, immovable stone.</p>

<p>But what was this? Her fingers, clawing sidewise, touched
something cylindrical, greasy. A candle! Great God! A candle stuck
in a niche. And a match next to it. A single match! Light!</p>

<p>Ann clutched the candle, the match. She was shaking, trembling
as with an ague. By striking this match, by touching its flame to
the wick of this candle, she would be able to see again. To see
what it was that barred her way to Bob! But there was only one
match. One only. And her hands were ripped, bleeding, numb with
cold and weakness...</p>

<p>The universe itself stood by with bated breath as Ann licked a
finger and held it up to discover if any draft wandered here to
blow out the precious flame in the moment of its birth, as she felt
with a quivering hand for a dry spot on the rock before her, as she
placed the head of the match against one that she found and rubbed
it slowly across the rough surface.</p>

<p>Phosphorous spluttered, flared. The girl's whole soul was in her
eyes as she watched that tiny flare, as she watched the blue spark
ignite the splinter of wood. Her heart missed a beat as the glow
flickered, pounded wildly when it grew stronger again and became a
robust flame she dared move the all-important inch to the charred
fiber of the wick. And no detonation that meant the collapse of a
city's wall ever fired a besieger's heart with greater exultation
than the ignition of that candle-end did hers.</p>

<p>Light guttered, steadied, drove back darkness. It revealed a
chamber hollowed out of rock by human hands, human tools. It
showed, some ten feet high in the farther wall, the aperture
through which she had tumbled into this artificial cavern. Below
this, and to one side, the growing illumination fell across a great
mound of burlap bags, some of which had burst to spill forth jagged
fragments of ore. The burlap of which the bags were fashioned was
new and fresh! How could that be when the mine had not been worked
for decades?</p>

<p>"Ann! I can see your light." Bob's cry struck across the wild
surmise springing to the girl's consciousness. "Ann!"</p>

<p>She turned. There was the rocky wall touch had told her about,
unbroken. And always, as though he were right here in front of her,
she could hear Bob. "Ann! You're almost here. What are you waiting
for?"</p>

<p>It was nightmarish, fantastic. "Ann!" Then she saw where the
voice was coming from. Above her, with above her, there was another
break in the surface of the rock, an arched opening like the one
through which she had so fortuitously entered, except that
<i>it</i> was barely two feet high and not much more across. It
gaped blackly at her, and the stone that edged it was slightly
blacker for inches than the rest of the wall, and from it Bob's
whimper came as though out of an old-fashioned speaking tube.
"Please come to me, dear. Please hurry."</p>

<p>A speaking tube. That's what it was! A tube, the orifice of a
small tunnel boring into rock! And somewhere within it, not far
away, Bob lay, weak and sick, and in need of her! The thought
sloughed exhaustion and pain from Ann like a discarded garment. She
got a foot on an out-jutting knob of rock, lifted, slid her candle
into the hole she could just reach, got her fingers onto its edge
and was scrambling, was lifting herself <i>up</i> that sheer
rock-face. She had one knee up, another, was squirming into the
narrow tunnel.</p>

<p>"Coming, Bob," she said. "I'm coming now." She had to snake
through here on her stomach, for the roof of the passage was not
high enough even for her to lift to hands and knees. But Bob was
somewhere in there, and even had the tunnel been narrower still she
would somehow have squeezed through.</p>

<p>The flickering luminance of the candle Ann pushed ahead of her
showed damp-blackened stone, slimy, scummed over by the blanched
small fungi of the regions where the sun never reaches. Stalactites
ripped long gashes in her clothing, tore her skin. Ahead there was
the scutter of the eyeless creatures of the dark. But here and
there Ann saw the mark of a pickaxe, a tooled groove, and knew she
was not the first human to crawl through this tight gallery, knew
that it was man formed, man-driven through the bowels of the earth,
knew that it was the old mine through which she crept. But...</p>

<p>The ground slanted upward, beneath her, the tunnel opened out.
"Ann!" Bob's face was suddenly before her, pallid, bloodless, Bob's
body recumbent on the same auto cushions that so long
ago&mdash;years, it seemed&mdash;she had dragged from the crumpled
remains of their car.</p>

<p>"Bob! My dear! My dearest!" she had her arms around him, was
kissing him. "My sweet."</p>

<p>His hand came up, feebly, stroked her face. "Ann! I've been
dreaming&mdash;the most horrible...Good Lord!...Where is this? What
place is this. I thought..."</p>

<p>"Don't think, Bob. Don't think. Things have happened, all kinds
of things. But everything's all right now. I have you back and
everything must be all right."</p>

<p>"But, Ann&mdash;Holy Jumping Jehoshaphat&mdash;<i>what's
that?"</i></p>

<p>Ann twisted in the direction of his startled gaze, saw across
the low, irregularly circular chamber where they were the orifices
of a number of such tunnels as that through which she had come, saw
a clawed, skeleton hand writhe from one of them, an emaciated arm.
And it was followed by a face!</p>

<p>The face looked at her, broke into a loathsome grin. That is,
the livid gash that was its mouth widened to expose rotted, black
teeth in a grimace that might have been intended for a grin. But
there was no humor in the concave, grey countenance above it, no
humor in the blank, imbecile eyes. There was only menace, lewd
menace that brought back all the horror of that dreadful night and
multiplied it a thousand-fold.</p>

<p>Breath hissed from Bob's lips, close against her face, and Ann
felt his body stiffen to the rigidity of terror. That same terror
ran molten through her own frame...</p>

<p>The Thing moved gruesomely, and a sound came from it, a
chattering, mindless howl, hollow and horrible. It echoed&mdash;No!
It was being repeated from the other openings into this low, flat
chamber, and from them came the rustling dry rasp of fabric dragged
along stone. Skeleton fingers clutched the edge of a second
hole...</p>

<p>Realization burst like black flame in Ann's skull. They were
closing in! The loathsome crawlers were closing in on her and on
Bob! <i>On Bob!</i></p>

<p>Breath gusted from her throat in a shriek the more poignant
because it was soundless. Ann threw herself over the prostrate form
of her husband to blanket him, to shield him from the obscene
menace closing inexorably in. Her hand struck the candle, struck
the light from it. Blackness swept down, blanking out the monstrous
faces peering in, blanking out the grotesque half-human masks and
the reptilian, snaking arms that writhed out of the rock in a
constricting circle of doom. But it did not quench the slithering
noises of the crawlers' coming, their voiceless husked cries, the
pungent, fetid odor of their foul bodies.</p>

<p>Bob's cheek against hers was icy cold. Ann hitched to cover him
more completely, to cover him with her own quivering flesh from the
Things that came slowly nearer, nearer...Perhaps they would be
satisfied with her. Perhaps possession of her would sate them.
Perhaps she yet might save him from them.</p>

<p>It was feeling, not thought, that curdled in her brain with this
last thread of hope, and reason gibbered to her how futile it was.
They would take her, and they would take him, and there was utterly
no hope for either.</p>

<p>Something touched her outstretched, bare arm, slithered
gruesomely down its length. Ann's skin crawled to the bloodless,
lusting touch. A fleshless hand fastened about her ankle...</p>

<p>Rock grated, thunderously. The darkness paled suddenly to the
color-drained, spectral luminance of moonlight. For one
reason-devastating moment Ann was aware of a grotesque, leprous
mask thrust close against her face, of lecherous eyes in which
hell-fire glowed. Then an enormous, bat-like shadow fell across the
twisted, prone form behind it, fell across her. Shrill, horrible
sound burst like a tornado in the confined space&mdash;the
piercing, weird ululation that had answered her cry for help and
banished the crawlers when first she had glimpsed them. It
crescendoed to its blasphemous apex of soul-shattering threat, held
that topmost note till Ann knew that in another instant it would
blast reason from her brain and leave her forever mad...</p>

<p>Abruptly it ended. The nerve-racked girl was aware that the
crawlers had pulled away, that they were writhing on
ground-scraping bellies to their holes, that they were sliding into
them like so many rats. Above her, someone chuckled.</p>

<p>Ann rolled, thanksgiving bursting in her heart, trembling on her
lips, rolled over to see who it was that twice had saved her from
the fearful threat of the crawlers. Who was this unknown, unseen
friend that alone in the weltering horror of Deadhope had aided
her?</p>

<p>Gaunt, black and gigantic in the silting moon glow, Haldon Kane
loomed above her. In his Luciferian countenance huge teeth showed,
grinning with demoniac triumph, and about that head of Satan his
black whip whistled and writhed!</p>

<p>"You," Ann sobbed. "You!"</p>

<p>The whip-lash writhed down, flicked her chin, lifted again. The
dexterous play of Kane's thin wrist kept it in hissing, ominous
motion. "Of course," he snarled. "You didn't think you could
<i>get</i> away from me, in this place whose every nook and cranny
I know? After ten years one should be more familiar with even a
maze like this than another who had known it for&mdash;ten
minutes."</p>

<p>"Ten years! But you haven't been here that long! Bob hired you
only last week." Clutching at straws, Ann was trying to keep him in
play, was desperately trying to stave off the final moment.</p>

<p>A mocking hideous laugh mingled with the whir of the whip.
"Travers didn't hire me. I was here long ago, ever since it was
deserted by fools who thought they must pay for labor to work it,
who thought they must dig five times as much dirt as the thin vein
occupied so that that labor might have place to stand at its
work...Who do you think I am?"</p>

<p>"You said&mdash;Haldon Kane, the&mdash;"</p>

<p>The circling whip-lash rippled in time to the chuckle that
dripped from its wielder's mouth. "Kane is miles away from here,
still running from the one sight I allowed him and his men of my
pets. How do <i>you</i> like them?"</p>

<p>Ann shuddered, could not keep her eyes from the menace of the
black thong snaking above her. "They&mdash;they're horrible..." she
whimpered. "They&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're not pretty, but useful. I don't have to pay them, you
know, and their food costs little. They find it themselves..."</p>

<p>"They find food&mdash;in this desert? How..." A gruesome
speculation formed in Ann's mind, added a new horror to that which
encompassed her, was answered by the grinning fiend.</p>

<p>"There were more of them when I brought them here. Many more.
And it was not disease that killed them. Do you understand?" Hell
itself quivered in his sardonic smile. "Queer," he mused. "How
simply this State can be persuaded to farm out its convicts to
anyone who will engage to board and clothe them. It saves the
taxpayers money, you see, especially if the contractor engages also
to guard them himself. And then&mdash;even guards are not necessary
when a simple inoculation will make the prisoners amenable, very
amenable to orders from one who has a brain..."</p>

<p>His voice trailed away, leaving behind it a slimy smear of
horror, then came again. "But they're hungry. My pets are hungry
now." Again that slow, Satanic smile and the whip's hissing. "Shall
I let them feed?" His slitted eyes flickered to Bob's pallid
figure, came back to her and seemed to strip the clothes from her
in one lewd glance. "In the presence of such juicy morsels I have
already had quite a little difficulty restraining them."</p>

<p>Nausea retched bitterness into Ann's throat at the ultimate
horror he implied. "No. Oh God, no!" she whimpered. "Kill us but
don't let&mdash;" Terror choked her.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may. Perhaps I may even let you&mdash;and
Travers&mdash;live...Your husband's formulae&mdash;what did you do
with them?"</p>

<p>The man was no longer smiling, but his whip seemed to chuckle as
somehow he managed to evoke a rattling sound from the snapper at
its end. The choice he offered was clear.</p>

<p>Ann's lips twitched. Gelid fingers clutched her throat. She
contrived to squeeze out speech. "I'll show you. Promise to let us
go and I'll show you."</p>

<p>"Get up, and take me to where you have hidden them." The whip
stopped its eternal whir, floated down to his side, hung there,
tense and ready. "Then, if you will sign this mine over to me I
will&mdash;let you live."</p>

<p>"And Bob?"</p>

<p>"And your husband. I swear it."</p>

<p>Ann had to drag herself up by his leg, had to hold onto his arm,
while the nausea of repugnance retched her, or she could not have
remained standing. Her head came above the roof of the chamber, and
she saw that the desert stretched, away from it, shimmering in the
moonlight. Something like a trapdoor fashioned of rock lay to one
side. When that was in place there would be no sign of what lay
below.</p>

<p>"Come," the man who was not Kane said. "I don't know how long my
pets can restrain themselves."</p>

<p>The skeleton town was to one side, silhouetted against a moon
across whose face luminous clouds drifted. "Over there," Ann
husked.</p>

<p>Ann stumbled over to the spot, with the man close behind her.
Here were the beams in the form of an inverted cross, below them
the other beneath which she had slid the envelope. Ann managed to
stoop over, to slide her hand into the recess...</p>

<p>A cold chill took her. There was nothing there! Oh God! The
envelope was not there, the envelope that was to ransom Bob from
horror!</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>She turned haunted, lifeless eyes to her tormenter. Her lips
moved soundlessly.</p>

<p>He needed no words to understand. Livid fury leaped into his
eyes. His lash surged up. Ann shrank against the stripped framework
of timber, horror staring from her twisted face.</p>

<p>"You've tricked me!" the man screamed. "You've dared to trick
me!" The black thong spat at her, spat across her face. "I'll flay
you alive."</p>

<p>Agony seared through to Ann's brain. Her body was a shell of ice
enclosing agony, seething with terror. The whip hissed up,
stopped.</p>

<p>"No. That's too good for you," the man squealed. <i>"They</i>
shall have you!" His chest swelled, and an ululation burst from
between his colorless, writhing lips&mdash;a sound somehow like the
warning cry she had heard twice before, but somehow different,
somehow more horrible.</p>

<p>They were coming! Past the quivering, passion-shaken figure of
the fiend she could see them squirming up out of the hole where Bob
still was. Verminous grey shadows in the silver of the moon-bathed
desert, spectral shadows of uttermost horror from a living grave,
they were crawling loathsomely toward her.</p>

<p><i>"Take her!"</i> their master shrieked. His long left hand
jerked a pointing finger across his quivering body, his whip curled
above his head, lashing air, hissing a song of doom. "Take her! Her
flesh is sweet, her blood is warm."</p>

<p>They slithered along the sand, coming fast now, faster than ever
before they had moved. Ann could see their drooling mouths now,
their devastated faces, their mindless eyes in which glowed the
fires of damnation. <i>"Take her!"</i> the maddened voice shrilled
again, and grey talons writhed out, grey hands gripped the hem of
her dress.</p>

<p>She held on to the splintered timbers behind her, she kicked out
at them with her small feet. But they were dragging her down. They
were dragging her down to their seething, foul mouths.</p>

<p>And most horrible of all was the silence with which they
attacked her, and the spectral glow of the moon on their contorted
forms, more horrible even than the crackling of the man's whip, and
the shrillness of his mad voice as he screamed, <i>"Take
her!"</i></p>

<p>The grip of Ann's hands on the beams behind her was torn away.
She was on her knees. Twisting, she grabbed again at the shattered
timbers, still frantically fighting, still desperately struggling
against the inevitable horror that tore at her. A fanged tooth sank
into her thigh, ripped. She jerked convulsively.</p>

<p>Above her there was a grinding crash! Light was blotted out.
Cataclysmic sound burst all about her. Behind her there was a
thunderous crash, a high-pitched scream of agony. Dust was in her
nostrils, her eyes. It choked and blinded her. Coughing,
spluttering, she flailed out frenzied arms, struck wood close on
either side, wood above her.</p>

<p>Her knees, her legs were queerly wet. But hands no longer
plucked at her, teeth no longer ripped her flesh. And there was no
longer a shrill voice in her ears, keening "Take her."</p>

<p>The dust settled. Upheld by shattered timbers, Ann moaned. Her
brain cleared. Silvery light splotched shadow around her, and
slowly she became aware that she was penned in a pyramidal space of
shattered, jagged timbers, that beneath her the ground was soaked,
muddy with blood, that behind her there were small whimperings,
tiny noises of infinite suffering. The whimperings faded at last to
silence. Her bewildered mind struggled with these things, and
realization finally dawned on her. That last, hopeless grab of
hers, that last frenzied clutch, somehow had seized upon the key
beam of a precariously balanced heap of timbers. It had collapsed,
and missing her, by some miracle had fallen upon and crushed the
crawlers behind her, and their master...</p>

<p>A miracle? Perhaps. And then again...<i>"Oh God!"</i> Ann
sobbed. <i>"Oh God, I thank Thee."</i> Perhaps she was right.
Perhaps He in whose sight no sparrow's tail is unnoted...</p>

<p>The sun may have warmed them to courage again, the men whom the
crawlers had routed from Deadhope and sent careening away in
marrow-melting fear. At any rate, it was they, bristling with
automatics and borrowed rifles, who returned, when that desert sun
was already blazing high in the sky, to dig Ann out from under the
blood-spattered beams, and fetch her again delirious husband from
the strange pit where he lay. They carried them to the room
prepared for them in the bunkhouse and aided them with rude surgery
till a doctor and nurse could be summoned from Axton to take over
the job.</p>

<p>But it was not till a week later that Ann came sufficiently out
from the shadows to talk to Bob. "It's all like a horrible
nightmare," she said. "I still don't understand what it was all
about."</p>

<p>"We've pieced it together from what we've been able to find
here, and the things he said to you, and what little was known
about him." Travers' mouth was still lined with pain, his eyes
somber. "The man's real name was Grandon Rolfe. He knew your Uncle
Horvay in the old days, knew that his silver vein had petered out
till it was unprofitable to work the mine.</p>

<p>"After Deadhope was abandoned he moved in. He got convicts from
the prison camp at Pimento, got them out here and made imbeciles of
them with an injection extracted from locoweed that grows wild all
through this desert. Then he worked the mine with them, starving
them and whipping them into submission. With free labor, with no
cost for equipment, it still could be made to pay..."</p>

<p>"But why did they crawl like that?"</p>

<p>"Because to further save expense and time, he excavated only the
narrow vein of silver ore and made them work on their bellies, like
snakes crawling in their burrows, till they no longer were able to
walk erect."</p>

<p>"Oh, horrible&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not more horrible than some coal mines of which I know, in this
country and abroad, where the miners work stooped over all day
long, and tiny children are used for any task that requires
quickness of movement. Greed inspires horrible things, my dear, and
it is only in degree that Rolfe was worse than a great many
highly-respected industrialists.</p>

<p>"However, he knew the jig was up when our men came in. He
stopped operations, covered over all signs of them, and pretending
to be a friendly neighbor, wormed out of them the reason for their
activity, my discovery of the new process. He made up his mind to
get hold of that and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And his twisted brain conceived the idea of using his crawling
idiots to scare them away, and then to frighten the process out of
us."</p>

<p>"Yes. It was only your bravery that defeated him, my dear."</p>

<p>"Not bravery, Bob. I was scared to death. But all your work, all
your hopes would have been ruined." Then a new thought leaped to
her brain, stinging it with anxiety. "Bob! The envelope. The papers
with your formulae. They're gone!"</p>

<p>"No, dear. They had only slipped into a little hole farther back
than you could reach. I have them." His hand reached across the
space between their beds, found hers. An electric circuit seemed to
close. Its current tingled between them, made them one. "I don't
deserve you, Ann."</p>

<p>"Silly," Ann said dreamily. "Someday I shall go through worse
things than that for you..."</p>

<p>Bob's eyes shone. "You mean...?"</p>

<p>"I think so&mdash;Oh Bob, I love you so much!"</p>
