  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; APE ATTACK</h2>

<p class="first">INTO the side-show tent the strident blare of a
calliope filtered, a barker's raucous shouts, the crack of rifles
from a shooting gallery&mdash;all the surging, happy tumult of
Cranport's annual gala night. It was spring. Salburn's Super
Shows once more were starting out on the road, and the factory
town was getting a preview of its refurbished marvels.</p>

<p>The simple people of the community were also getting, all
unknowingly, a preview of the horror that was to come before the
gaudy caravan returned to its winter quarters&mdash;horror that
would paint faces now ruddy under the flare of carnival torches
with the grey of grisly dread; that would make screams of terror
tear through throats now chortling with laughter and replace
gayety with the desolation of fear-bred madness.</p>

<p>"Hot! Hot! Get 'em while they're red hot," a weenie vendor
bawled, and from the Thriller Ride shrilled the mirthful shrieks
of its tumbled patrons.</p>

<p>But within the canvas walls of Zortal's tent the clamor was
muted by a strained, taut hush. The terraced bleachers were in
shadow, so that from Dan King's front row seat the packed benches
were only a mounting bank of pallid, blurred ovals. But he knew
that their occupants were hunched forward, silently, almost
grimly intent on the huge ape in the central arena&mdash;staring
at the ape and the stocky, swart-visaged human in close-fitting
tights of green silk who stood to one side, glowering and quite
motionless.</p>

<p>Gasoline flares, high on poles, stabbed down at the hard-
packed earth, filled the ring with a dancing, fitful glare. The
long black lash of a cruel whip hung down along Zortal's leg and
coiled at his feet, but neither by word nor sign was he giving
any direction to the shaggy, lumbering primate in its incredible
routine.</p>

<p>Naida Stone's little hand crept into King's protective one. It
was icy, quivering. "I don't like it," she whispered,
tremulously. "There's something wrong about it, something
dreadfully wrong." A shudder ran through her slender body, so
tinglingly close against his own.</p>

<p>"The brute is better trained than most, that's all," the young
automotive engineer rumbled. But even as he said it, chill
prickles scampered up and down his spine and he was conscious of
a faint quiver at the pit of his stomach.</p>

<p>Was it some atavistic fear that crawled sluggishly in his
blood, some ancestral memory of the days when Man first moved
into caves and the Tree People still stalked him through steamy
jungle aisles? But he had seen great apes before and felt nothing
but a mild interest. In the hulking chimpanzee padding
noiselessly out there, there was some eerie, too-human quality.
Vaguely he, too, sensed that it had passed through some strange
metamorphosis into a being neither beast nor man, into an entity
beyond the pale of familiar things.</p>

<p>The gigantic beast, bent-kneed, long-armed, blackly hirsute,
shuffled to a large mound in the center of the ring and jerked a
tarpaulin from it. A stripped automobile chassis stood
revealed&mdash;with bare framework&mdash;and beside it a helter-
skelter pile of gears, steel rods, castings, all the multifarious
parts of a car's power plant. Ranged on a canvas strip were
wrenches, spanners and other implements. The polished tools
splintered light into darting gleams...</p>

<p>Muscles tightened along the ridge of Dan King's square jaw. A
murmur ran through the crowd, almost a moan. Nearly all of them
workers in Cranport's two automobile factories&mdash;every man in
the gasping audience had often seen just such piles of jumbled
parts. King, himself part owner and engineer, of the Mayflower
plant had arranged more than one such display for speed tests
between crews of expert assemblers. Good Lord! Was the
ape...?</p>

<p>The astounding speculation became actuality. The primate
snatched up tools, fell on the tumbled mass of fabricated metal.
With incredible swiftness it changed&mdash;with unbelievable
speed a motor grew on the chassis, a crankshaft clanged into
place, connecting rods were fitted to their bearings. Muscles
swelled under the shaggy hide, the tremendous chest heaved as
weights ordinarily handled by clanking cranes yielded to the
chimpanzee's gigantic strength, were lifted and dropped
meticulously into their beds. Grotesque black paws darted in
intricate manipulations with a deftness, a dexterity no human
laborer could surpass.</p>

<p>"No! No!" Naida whimpered. "It isn't doing it. It can't be. It
isn't possible."</p>

<p>She was warm, palpitant within the curve of Dan King's
arm&mdash;but in that moment he did not wonder at his daring, at
her acquiescence. His throat was dry, his brain throbbed with an
astoundment that was almost pain. He pulled his gaze from the
fantastic performance, sought saner things for assurance of his
own sanity.</p>

<p>Across the ring, nearly opposite, Ned Salburn leaned forward,
his heavy-jowled face rubicund, his jaws working on his eternal
tobacco cud. Further along was Warren Fenton, superintendent for
United Motors of their Hiawatha factory, Mayflower's bitterest
rival. Fenton's fox-like countenance was livid, his eyes almost
popping from his head.</p>

<p>The emerald-clad man in the arena was somehow more erect.
There was a swagger in the tilt of his, Zortal's, shoulders, in
the poise of his head, as though he were saying, with gloating
triumph, "I have done this. I, Zortal the Great."</p>

<p>From somewhere high up a hoarse voice boomed: "Come out from
under that mask Pat Cooney. We know you. Come out!"</p>

<p>Tension broke as boisterous, almost hysteric laughter swept
the big tent. The great ape dropped its wrench, twisted around to
face the jester&mdash;and King's scalp tightened as he saw in the
beast's russet fur a bald spot crowning its brow-less skull that
had a gargoylesque resemblance to the popular foreman who had
quit the factory without notice about a month before. Then the
similitude was gone, the ape was altogether bestial as it loped
forward, its curved knuckles brushing the ground. Light struck
across its snouted, leathery countenance and the bridgeless
spread of its flat nose, while the grotesque visage worked with
some obscure emotion.</p>

<p>"Get back! Get back there," Zortal shouted, coming alive. "Get
back!" He was moving to intercept the chimpanzee's path, his
long, wicked lash lifting in his sinewy hand.</p>

<p>The ape came on, ignoring its master, thick lips snarling away
from yellow fangs as it came straight for King, and he half-
lifted from his seat with some dim notion of fending the brute
off from Naida. Suddenly it was very near, and Dan saw its
look...</p>

<p>His skin was suddenly a tight sheath for his quivering body,
his palms were wet with cold sweat. Good God! Those were not the
eyes of an animal. A soul looked out from those eyes, a tortured
human soul, and in their blue depths fear crawled in a suffering
terrible appeal!</p>

<p>Something flashed across King's vision, and there was the
crack of a gun shot. No&mdash;! It was Zortal's whip as it
lashed across the ape's hairy back, lifted, writhed, and bit
savagely again and again into brute flesh.</p>

<p>"Back to your work. Back, I say!"</p>

<p>Clamor beat about Dan. Shouts, a woman's scream, were suddenly
swallowed, blotted out, by an abysmal, thunderous roar that
filled the tent with sound almost tangible, that blasted its
hearers with devastating terror. The ape whirled on its
tormentor. The out lash of its colossal arm was the lightning
strike of a rattlesnake, and Zortal's whip was in the grip of a
black, gnarled paw&mdash;was wrenched from the trainer's grip.
The beast crouched, pounced. Zortal went down under a grunting,
snarling tornado of hairy fury, and the flash of green silk was
gone.</p>

<p>Dan King was somehow in the ring. He was tugging frantically
at a pole at the top of which a torch flared. A shriek burbled in
his ears, a shriek of purest agony. The rod came away in King's
hands and he whirled, threw himself at the monstrous, snarling
simian. His extemporary weapon pounded down and flame splashed on
tossing, red-brown shagginess. Burned hair, frying flesh, stung
its nostrils.</p>

<p>The chimpanzee surged erect, twisting. King leaped far back.
The enraged beast loomed over him, tremendous. Its brutish mouth
yawned cavernous and its bellow was about him like a black flood.
Fetid breath gusted over him.</p>

<p>For an appalling instant fear ran icy in the engineer's veins.
Monstrous arms flailed, and the giant ape sprang still roaring,
to tear him apart. King's muscles exploded into swift movement,
and he lunged forward to meet that cataclysmic rush, thrust the
blazing flare squarely into the brute's face. The creature
screamed and the man leaped back out of its reach, lithely. The
flame-pot rolled across the ground, vomiting flame and black
smoke.</p>

<p>The chimpanzee thudded to a halt. It clawed at its cooked face
with huge hands, and he saw that in the deep-sunk sockets under
the overhang of its forehead there were blackened cinders where
eyes should be.</p>

<p>Naida was suddenly beside King&mdash;clutching his arm. "Dan!"
the girl shrilled. "Dan! Come back. He'll kill you!"</p>

<p>The ape whirled to the sound, lurched blindly toward it, great
paws sweeping out to clutch Naida, to rend. In a single flash of
action Dan hurled the girl aside, lanced the stake at the
cyclonic onrush of the maddened brute, jabbed its pointed ferrule
into the ape's gaping mouth. The impact threw King backward,
sprawling upon the ground; but the beast's own terrific momentum
impaled it, drove the pole out through the back of its neck.
Blood-rush choked off the nerve-shattering roar, and the gigantic
animal pounded down, was a threshing, gory horror.</p>

<p>King rolled over and scrambled to his feet, frantically
seeking Naida. He fought nausea that retched bitterness into his
mouth.</p>

<p>Figures were all about him, blocking vision. Someone grabbed
his hand, pulled him around. A crowd ringed him in, white-faced,
spewing oaths. It split apart and Zortal came through, his green
suit ripped, one arm dangling limply, shoulder askew.</p>

<p>King stared at him, stupid with amazement. The man's face was
contorted with rage, his eyes black with fury. "Damn you," he
squealed, rage thinning his voice. "You've killed him! Murderer!"
The fellow's good hand came up, fisting. Dan's muscles knotted,
but pudgy fingers, Ned Salburn's, grabbed Zortal's wrist.</p>

<p>"Stop it, you fool!" the showman roared. "Stop it. He saved
your life. You'd be in little pieces now if it wasn't for him.
The rest of us were paralyzed."</p>

<p>The trainer's thin mouth twitched. His stocky frame quivered
as he visibly fought to gain control. "But&mdash;" he husked.
"But he's ruined the work of years. The greatest
attraction..."</p>

<p>"The devil with that!" Salburn came back. "You'll get another
chimp, train it. I'll keep you on the payroll and next
year..."</p>

<p>"Next year hell!" Wrath seemed to have drained out of the man,
but his countenance was still livid, tiny fires still smoldered
in his eyes. "I'll have another one for you in two weeks. A
better one. I know how now."</p>

<p>Disbelief showed in the carnival proprietor's expression. "All
right then. Two weeks. But come away. Come out of here&mdash;and
let's get your arm fixed."</p>

<p>"Dan! Dan darling. Are you hurt? Are you all right?"</p>

<p>King wheeled to Naida. Her white frock was dirt-smeared and
there was a brown splotch across her cheek. But something in her
eyes sent a thrill through him, surging warmly in his veins.</p>

<p>"Naida!" He reached for her. "Naida! Let's get out of this."
Words were on his tongue that for months he had choked down, had
hardly dared to think. "Let's get out."</p>

<p>The crowd parted for them. They went past Zortal, and the man
lipped, "I won't forget you, Mr. King. I won't forget this." It
might have been thanks, but somehow the man's green costume
seemed to make him oddly reptilian, poisonous. His black, cold
eyes flickered from Dan to the girl his arm encircled, and little
lights crawled in them, little lascivious lights.</p>

<p>There was a crowd outside too, and more coming on the run,
brought by swift rumor. "What happened, Mr. King?" someone
called, reaching out to stop them. Dan scarcely heard, did not
answer. They were in his Mayflower Eight and were roaring away,
out of the Fair Grounds, out along the car tracks of the Shore
Road to where the Big House stood, set far back from the
road.</p>

<p>As a shoeless kid he had long ago brought the laundry to the
back door of that house. The small girl in crisp organdie whom he
would see on the lawn&mdash;black ringlets curling about her
tiny, piquant face, fat little legs twinkling&mdash;had made him
poignantly conscious of his tattered clothes, of the tumble-down
shack in Frog Hollow that was his home. Once she had smiled at
him and he had run away.</p>

<p>He thought he had forgotten her in the long years between,
years filled with days of grueling labor, with nights of more
grueling study. His inventions, his genius for the management of
labor, had multiplied the production, the profits of the
Mayflower plant. Even when Roger Stone had recognized his
ability, had given him greater and greater responsibility, had
last year taken him into partnership, Dan King had remained the
kid from Frog Hollow, and the Big House a palace, with the girl
who lived there unapproachable as royalty itself.</p>

<p>She had come into the office more and more frequently. He had
been wordless in her presence, awkward, had found duties to take
him out into the plant. But increasingly she had haunted his
dreams, and, when her father had asked him today to take her to
the carnival he had trembled inwardly...</p>

<p>He braked the car at the big stone gate, turned to her.
"Naida," he murmured. "Naida. I love you. I have always loved
you."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE HEADLESS
CORPSE</h2>

<p class="first">THE rush of night air about him could not quench
the tingle of Naida's parting kiss on Dan King's lips. A vast
exhilaration possessed him, joy pulsed in his big body. He wanted
to shout, to trumpet it triumphantly to sleeping Cranport. "Naida
is mine, all mine. She loves me. Do you hear that? She is going
to be my wife!"</p>

<p>Trees gave way to flatlands, and the dark loom of the
Mayflower plant's low buildings was unreeling to his right.
Yellow oblongs showed windows still lighted in the administration
building. Roger Stone was still there, then. King's sedan nosed
into the cinder driveway, skidded to a stop.</p>

<p>The broad-shouldered man with hair that was black as Naida's
save for greying temples looked up from a desk spread with
blueprints and sheets of typed manuscript. Dan halted inside the
office door that for the first time he had flung open without the
formality of knocking, and tried to find words to tell Naida's
father of that which had happened.</p>

<p>There was a smile of approval on the older man's aristocratic
countenance "Dan, my boy," Stone said, "you've done it again.
This new car will cut the feet out from under the Hiawatha
Company. We'll be able to undersell them by two hundred dollars
and deliver a better job for the money. I've already had Johnson
send off the patent applications to Washington, and we'll be able
to start production in a month. Congratulations..."</p>

<p>"Thanks." King brushed aside the phrases that this afternoon
would have meant so much to him. "Glad you like it. But I've got
something to tell you about Naida?"</p>

<p>The other came up out of his chair. "Naida! Something
happened...?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. That is, nothing bad." Dan was stammering like a
schoolboy. "She&mdash;I&mdash;that is... She's promised to be my
wife."</p>

<p>Stone was a graven image, standing behind his desk. The office
was deathly still. Papers crackled under his blue-veined hands as
he pressed down on them.</p>

<p>"She's promised... to be... <i>your</i> wife." The words
dribbled from lips that were white under his grey mustache, and
there was something in the way he said them, something in his
eyes, that brought a hot flush to King's cheeks. "I picked you
out of the stink and filth of Frog Hollow to make a man of you,
and this is how you thank me. You," contempt was a knife-edge in
his tone, "the son of a drunkard who died in the gutter, of a
washwoman who scrubbed my drawers, are going to give me my
grandchildren. No!"</p>

<p>Slow anger mounted in Dan. His great hands knotted, nails
digging into their palms. But he managed to hold himself in
leash. "You did not make a man of me, Mr. Stone. Whatever I am,
whatever I possess, I have earned. Fenton would have had you down
long ago if it weren't for me. If you wish, you can have it all
back, my job, my partnership in the firm. United Motors has been
after me for years. I can go to them tomorrow and they will be
glad to have me. You can have the new car whose plans lie on your
table. I'll give them a better one. And Naida will go with me.
You can't stop her. She loves me and you can't hold her."</p>

<p>Silence again clotted in the room. The two men faced each
other, their stares clashing, indomitable, their wills wrestling
in a wordless combat. Then, quite suddenly, Dan realized that
Stone was an old, broken man whose hand abruptly gestured in a
curious, almost pathetic movement.</p>

<p>"No. I can't hold her. I've never been able to do anything
with her&mdash;not since her mother died, so long ago. And I need
you. I need you, Dan. Just give me a chance. Let me take her away
on&mdash;on a trip somewhere. She's so young. She may not know
her own mind. And I am tired, sick. I need a rest. If she still
wants you three months from now you can have her. And we'll go on
as before."</p>

<p>King sucked breath in between cold lips. She was necessary to
him now, part of him. Not to see her for three long months...</p>

<p>"You're not afraid, are you? If she loves you as she says,
three months absence will make no difference. And if it
should&mdash;you have no right to her. No right!"</p>

<p>It was a challenge he could not evade. "All right." He did not
want to say it but he had to. God help him, he had to. "All
right. Go ahead."</p>

<p><br>
ITS motor purring sweet rhythm that should have been music to
Dan King's ears, the Mayflower Eight poured itself down Railroad
Street. The engine sound should have been music, and the far-off
hoot of a locomotive whistle wailing down the night wind should
have set pulses leaping in his wrists; for Naida Stone was on
that train, bringing her back to Cranport and to Dan after the
three long months when he hadn't heard from her, when he hadn't
even known where she was&mdash;the girl he loved better than life
itself.</p>

<p>God! If only he had been able to wire her, to tell her to stay
away. To stay far away from Cranport, from the fear-cursed town
where terror ran rampant. But he <i>hadn't</i> known how to reach
her, until the telegram had come, a half-hour ago, to say that
she was on the Cannonball Express. Then it was too
late&mdash;except to jump into the sedan and send it rocketing to
the station so that he could catch her there, make her stay on
the train, send her away.</p>

<p>Old Pete Foley had goggled at him, swinging back the big gate
so that he could go through the high, barbed-wire fence. One of
the guards had come running, the floodlights glinting on his
sawed-off shotgun, to shout incoherently at him. They had been
afraid for him, and he was afraid, too. With hammering
trepidation running like a cold flame through his veins, he
feared that which was loose in the factory town. For a weird
menace had made beleaguered fortresses of the Mayflower Factory,
and of the Hiawatha Motor Works on the other side of town.</p>

<p>The wind of his own speed stung his red-rimmed eyeballs
sharply. He squinted through the windshield. <i>Look!</i> Even
downtown here, even here in the heart of Cranport where the
terror had not yet struck, where men were not yet mysteriously,
awesomely missing from their homes, fear was a dark river inside
shuttered, door-barred houses.</p>

<p>It was early, it was only eight o'clock&mdash;but the only
moving figures to be seen were two patrolmen, coupled for
protection, with their guns in their hands as they walked down
the center of the roadway, away from shadowy alleys, from the
lightless nooks that might be ambush for whatever it was that
snatched men out of life into some unnamable fate. Stores were
tight shut. The station plaza, as he rounded into it, was a
broad, deserted expanse, its asphalt somehow gleaming ghastly
under light filtering down from ornamental lampposts.</p>

<p>King brought his car to a squealing, skidding halt. He flung
out of it, thumped stiff-legged across the sidewalk, shoved a
shoulder against a swinging door. He was inside the waiting-room,
was pounding between a long row of benches toward the exits to
the tracks. His footfalls echoed hollowly under the high-domed
roof. The place was empty of life, was filled with brooding,
breathless dread. The blind was down over the ticket agent's
wicket; there was no gate-man...</p>

<p>Dan stopped short, his skin crawling. What was that on the
floor, sticking out from under the bench? A shoe&mdash;a foot!
He knelt down, got his hand on it. His other hand, supporting him
on the floor; found something wet, warm, sticky. The body at
whose foot he tugged came sliding out, spreading a pool of its
own blood.</p>

<p>God! The corpse hadn't any head&mdash;only a shapeless mess of
pulped flesh and smashed bone where it ought to have a head. What
was once a uniform was shredded grey rags, matted with clotted
blood...</p>

<p>The oncoming train whistled again, nearer. Outside, rails
hummed. Through King's retching nausea an alarm blared, and he
twisted, stood up&mdash;started to run. But a tremendous form,
black, grotesque, avalanched down upon him from over the top of
the bench.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; TERROR AT THE
CROSSROADS</h2>

<p class="first">DUCKING to avoid the attack, Dan King's feet
skidded out from under him on the blood-wet tiles and he went
down flat, half-rolling. The pouncing, shaggy thing missed,
thudded alongside him. King realized he was under the bench, and
kept on rolling. A hairy arm darted after him. A huge paw, black-
taloned, snatching for him, caught the hem of his coat. He tore
the cloth away, came out into the aisle on the other side. He got
his knees under him, shoved with his hands, leaped up. Two huge
apes had come from hiding in the deserted waiting room of the
station!</p>

<p>A gigantic beast loomed in front of him. Its big-thewed arms
went around him, hugging him against stiff bristles that rasped
his face, grated his lips as his mouth came open for a yell that
the hairy hide stifled. The beast's circling hold constricted,
making breath wheeze from King's lungs under the irresistible
pressure. Excruciating pain seared his back, his chest, as the
steel-trap squeeze caved his ribs. His fists beat a futile tattoo
on the brute's sides. A yellow-toothed grin between thick black
lips blurred in his burning, bleared vision.</p>

<p>Dan's knee jerked spasmodically up, found softness, drove into
it. The ape squealed agony and his grip relaxed,
slightly&mdash;enough for King, desperation exploding into
momentarily redoubled strength, to jerk free, staggering
backward. The further bench caught him, held him upright. He
sucked sobbing breath into collapsed lungs, had a fleeting
glimpse of the primate doubling up, and kicked savagely at its
agonized groin.</p>

<p>A shadow fell across him. He wheeled to see the other ape
towering over him, its splayed feet groping for a prehensile grip
on the top of the bench separating them, its columnar legs
haunching to pounce.</p>

<p>Terror pronged King's breast. The jungle denizen launched a
ferocious swoop and Dan's heels drove into the tiles, catapulting
him forward and under the down-circling arc of the hairy
monster's leap. His out-flung hands clutched the bench-top the
beast had just left, gave him a hold sufficient to vault the
high-backed furniture. He pounded down, just missing the sprawled
corpse of the murdered gateman he had discovered. He hurdled the
gory cadaver, pelted toward the track exits. Padding footfalls
behind told him the brutes were on his trail. Almost he could
feel their hot breaths on his neck.</p>

<p>The eerie, macabre silence that had shrouded the incredible
struggle was shattered by a sudden high, wild shriek from
outside. It crescendoed to a wailing, ear-piercing scream. Then
there was the pound and hiss of a locomotive driving past, the
screech of jamming brakes. From somewhere a thin whistle
shrilled. King lurched between out-jutting brass rails, crashed
against a door that did not swing open, that was appallingly
immovable, locked.</p>

<p>His last hope of escape collapsed like a bursting balloon. He
was penned in, utterly lost. Panic and despair twisted at the pit
of his stomach, and he whirled to face the oncoming, bestial
doom. He gasped, stung by the discovery that the savage primates
were no longer intent upon him, but were surging out through the
street entrance.</p>

<p>He reeled, snatching at the short, curved rail-lengths that
had made a standing place for the guard who would never stand
again. Half stunned, he fought for breath, fought to still the
pound of an over-taxed heart hammering against the walls of his
aching chest. Through vertiginous darkness swirling inside his
skull, dim realization came that the fearful messengers of an
awful death had been scared off by the sound of the arriving
train.</p>

<p>The train! Naida! He pushed himself away from the rails to
which he clung, threw himself around the barrier, thrust at the
next door. That too was locked, mocked his efforts. Oh God! He
had to get out there, had to warn her.</p>

<p>"All ab-o-o-ard," a far-off voice intoned. "All ab-o-oard."
King was running wildly along the line of rail-guarded doors, was
frantically trying each one. The very last swung open. Yellow
light-squares were already sliding over the platform as the
express crashed away. He shoved through, saw Naida peering about
her, far down, a bag alongside her.</p>

<p>"Naida," Dan shouted, sprinting toward her. "Naida!" She came
to meet him, was in his arms. His lips, that had thirsted so
long, were crushed against hers in a long embrace. She was warm,
dear, in his arms. "Darling," he murmured. "It's good, so good to
have you back."</p>

<p>Then momentarily forgotten terror was back, cold at the base
of his brain, and he pulled away. Chaotic words rose to his
throat. He swallowed them as he remembered that the train was
gone, that there was not to be another till morning. His plan to
send her away was blotted out. He must think, must find a way to
safeguard her. Meantime no use in frightening her...</p>

<p>"Dan. I've longed for you so. If Dad had been with me I would
have found a way to write you. But he put me on my honor before
he went away..."</p>

<p>"Away! Wasn't he with you in...?" Dan stopped short, sparred
for time, tried to think.</p>

<p>"Florida. No. He took me to Miami and left the next day. Said
he had wanted a long fishing trip all his life&mdash;that I
wouldn't enjoy it."</p>

<p>King scarcely heard. They were alone on the platform. The apes
might be back. The apes... Good Lord! What did the attack in the
station mean? Were they the prowling menace terrorizing Cranport?
Had they marked him for their next victim?</p>

<p>"Come on," he blurted, picking up the girl's bags, taking her
arm with his free hand. "Come on, let's get going. Let's get away
from here." He started off, his glance furtively, fearfully
searching the shadows. He was fairly dragging her, half-
running.</p>

<p>"But Dan," Naida protested, "why are you going around outside.
It's shorter through the waiting room."</p>

<p>"Yes, but there's a&mdash;someone I want to avoid is waiting
for me. We'll go this way." The gateman's body was still in
there; she must not see it. "Look, here we are! How do you like
the new car? Isn't it a beauty?" He must let the police know
about the dead man. But not now, not till he had Naida indoors,
safe...</p>

<p>"Oh, it is. It is. I must drive it!" She pulled away from him,
had the door open and had slid under the wheel.</p>

<p>A flicker of movement, seen out of the corner of his eye,
twisted King around. Shadows at the end of station seemed to be
taking on rounded form, seemed to be coming alive. He twisted
back, flung Naida's bag into the sedan, jumped in. "Get started,"
he yelled. "Quick!"</p>

<p>The starter whirred as she clicked-over the ignition key and
the girl's small foot went down on the button. Motor roared,
gears clashed, and the car jumped forward like an unleashed
greyhound. Wind beat in under the lifted windshield. Darkened
houses flicked past.</p>

<p>"What was it?" Naida flung at him, her eyes steady on the
road. "You sounded so scared."</p>

<p>A pulse thumped in his temples, dull pain throbbed in his
chest. Every breath was stabbing torture, he was corseted with
agony. The battering he had sustained, the terrible squeezing,
anesthetized at first by excitement, by the thrill of his
sweetheart's return, were showing their effect now. He
couldn't&mdash;think straight.</p>

<p>But he must not scare her&mdash;let the sharp-clawed fear
tear at her that was slicing his own brain. He had to get her to
safety, behind barbed wire, under the protection of armed
guards.</p>

<p>"Accident&mdash;at the plant," he answered. So hard to talk,
each word searing his lungs with new pain. "Got to get&mdash;back
there quick. Hurry!" Once there, once safe, he could tell
her.</p>

<p>"An accident! You're hurt, Dan. Your face..."</p>

<p>"No. Not hurt. Working hard&mdash;day, night. Drive fast. Tell
you when&mdash;get there. Don't talk&mdash;now. Hurry!"</p>

<p>Working hard? Oh God! As the car hurtled through the night the
torturesome weeks of which this was the culmination reeled
through Dan King's throbbing mind, a motion-picture film edged
with corroding acid. The days of feverish preparation for the new
model. The start of production and the great ads flowering in
newspapers all over the nation. Then came crashing
catastrophe!</p>

<p>On that very same day other ads had appeared, proclaiming in
staring black type cuts in Hiawatha's prices that made
Mayflower's drastically lowered ones seem extortionate.
Devastating cuts. Investigation had driven into King's being the
certitude that Warren Fenton must have had a spy in his designing
room. For the patent application had scarcely had time to reach
Washington when a high board fence had gone up around the
Hiawatha area, and the workers there had not been permitted to
leave it Hiawatha must have made changes too...</p>

<p>But what changes? King had purchased his competitor's product,
had torn it down and analyzed every bit of its fabric. There was
no cheapening in material, in design. The only saving could be in
labor.</p>

<p>He had met Fenton's cut with another, only to find his rival
going under his price again. King was selling at cost now, but
Hiawatha cars sold far below&mdash;unbelievably cheaper. Even if
the unions would have stood for it, there was absolutely no room
for any wages to the workers. How were they doing it?</p>

<p>Mayflower was equal to the new reduction. But it was suicidal.
Bankruptcy stared at Dan King, swept down upon him.</p>

<p>He had been a very vortex of energy. He had been everywhere in
the plant, cutting down every least waste, speeding up,
exhorting, driving his men till they were strained to the very
last pitch of exhaustion. Years of cooperation, of good
treatment, had their reward. The beleaguered manufacturer had
begun to see light.</p>

<p>Then the terror had begun. One by one his workers had
vanished, gone into some eerie limbo of oblivion. At first he had
thought Fenton was raiding him, but, even admitting disloyalty,
if Hiawatha had won away the missing laborers with higher pay,
where was his rival's saving? Even United Motors' great treasury
could not stand such a drain.</p>

<p>Desperately King had fought on. He had put up a barbed wire
barricade of his own, flood-lighted and patrolled by armed
guards. He had set up cots for his men, had forbidden them to
leave the place. The assembly line was moving again, was speeding
up. All day long autos were spewed out of the two great
plants&mdash;roared away in long motorcades to a public that was
making Saturnalia of the weird battle. While the night shift
labored, gates were closed, barred, sentinelled.</p>

<p>The conflict was at a stalemate. Battling alone, Dan King had
been a staggering Atlas, carrying the enterprise on his stalwart
shoulders. With the period of Roger Stone's self-exile ended,
with him returning, the scales might yet turn...</p>

<p>Good Lord! A grisly speculation trailed across his mind. Was
that the reason for the attack upon him? Was there some macabre
connection between...?</p>

<p>He jerked upright. The road ahead curved, dipped to a fork
whose right branch went toward the Mayflower works, whose left
was the Shore Road passing Naida's home, going on to the Hiawatha
plant. Just as his car's headlights scythed through blackness to
impinge on the intersection they caught a black, huge form that
had leaped back into shrubbery with the ungainly, yet swift gait
of the apes he had just been battling. An ambush...!</p>

<p>"Stop!" he yelled, snatching for the emergency brake. "Turn
back?"</p>

<p>Motor-sound cut off, the sedan lurched, skidded, slewed half
around. Its front wheels went into a ditch, there was a rending,
tearing sound, the crack of fractured metal. His auto-seat
dropped sickeningly beneath King and Naida lurched against
him.</p>

<p>"Axle smashed," he grunted, icy with realization that escape
in the sedan was impossible. Darkness blotted the road now, but
senses sharpened by fear brought intimations to him of a black
mass moving along it toward them. The skewed headlamp beam showed
a wilted, straggly garden and an unpainted, low shack. Frail as
it looked, it was the only shelter&mdash;better at least than the
smashed car. He tugged at the door handle of the car, knew a
moment of sinking despair as it resisted his efforts. He pounded
his shoulder against it and it gave.</p>

<p>Sprawling out, King surged to his feet. Naida was staring at
him from the car, white-faced, and now the pad of oncoming
footfalls thudded menacingly against his ears. He mouthed some
unintelligible exclamation, dragged the girl out, was pounding
toward the lightless house.</p>

<p>"Dan!" the girl gasped in amazement as he pulled her roughly
along. "Have you gone mad?"</p>

<p>King pulled in a sobbing breath as his feet pounded on a
creaking porch. A door faced him in the drab wall and he snatched
at its knob, praying that it was not locked. It went inward to
his thrust. He pulled Naida inside, slammed the door shut, leaned
against it.</p>

<p>"No," he lipped. "I'm not crazy, the world is." Naida was a
pallid spectre in darkness. "Tried to keep it from you, but
horrible things are loose in Cranport." His searching fingers,
fumbling for a key or a bolt, felt splintered metal of a smashed
lock. Furniture bulked vaguely in the gloom, he lurched for the
largest, got hands on a heavy table, tried to drag it toward the
door. "Help me."</p>

<p>Naida sprang to his assistance. The table moved, smashed
against the portal just as unshod feet thumped on the porch
beyond and a body thudded against the door. The whole structure
shook to the impact. The girl screamed once and clung to King.
Then a snuffling, animal sound came from outside, and at the same
time&mdash;in the very room with them&mdash;they heard the
slither of stealthy movement! The rustle of fabric scraping
against the floor! Something was creeping craftily toward
them...</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; SEAN O'FLAHERTY'S
DOOM</h2>

<p class="first">THE menace outside, the menace within, clutched
King's throat with choking fear. Of the two the mysterious,
crawling threat inside was the more imminent, the more appalling.
The ape would be held back for a moment at least by the hasty
barrier. Naida came up against him, he could feel her trembling,
could hear her choked whimper. He got a hand into the pocket of
his jacket, found wood matches. Got one out, scraped a thumb-nail
across its head.</p>

<p>Murk fled when the match flared. A shabby, drab room sprang
into flickering existence... a doorway in a scabrous wall. A
hand, grey, skeleton-like, grasped its sash, low-down. A
fleshless, cadaverous countenance hitched into view, almost level
with the floor. Mad eyes glared at King from sunken, dark sockets
and the barrel of a shotgun shoved out, lifted with snouting
menace.</p>

<p>King leaped catapulting across the chamber. He had his fingers
on the gun-barrel. It came away easily, too easily.</p>

<p>Naida shrieked, and the scrape of the barricading table cut
across her scream. "I can't hold it," she screamed. "He's coming
in." King whirled. The dark wall was slitted by white light from
his wrecked car's headlights. The slit widened, was jogged by the
table, by Naida's shoulder, was blotched by a silhouette beyond
the door&mdash;by the tall black outline of a shaggy ape-
flank.</p>

<p>The gun-butt jarred against his shoulder. "Get away," he
yelled. "Get away, Naida!" The girl's white form swept aside, out
of the line of fire. Gun-roar blasted, thunderous in the confined
space. There was suddenly a jagged-edged, gaping hole in the
door. A howl of rage and pain shrieked through the night.</p>

<p>King fired the other barrel and the roar of his shot was
deafening. When the ringing in his ears faded, he heard a thin
whistle and receding thumping sounds that quickly faded out to
silence. He got to the door, scrambled over the table, peered out
through the gap he had made. Vague, lurching shapes were just
vanishing into night-invested shrubbery.</p>

<p>He wheeled. "They're gone," he gasped, shaking. "They're gone,
Naida."</p>

<p>"Light. Make a light, Dan." The girl's tone was stifled, taut.
A moan sounded, not from her.</p>

<p>King got out another match, snapped it into flame. Naida
looked fearfully toward the doorway at the form that lay there.
Dan King found an oil lamp and got it lit.</p>

<p>The figure at which Naida stared, wide-eyed, was a flaccid,
deflated old man. Sparse, white wisps of hair barely covered his
scalp, his skull was visible through the tight, almost
transparent skin on his age-yellowed visage and wrinkled lids
drooped over bulging eyeballs.</p>

<p>King went and looked down at the scrawny, half-clothed form.
The thin back lifted and fell with shallow, labored breathing,
but King's spine prickled as he saw the ancient's trailing legs,
saw that they were horribly twisted, broken as a wanton child
would break a despised doll.</p>

<p>Recognition palpitated in the aching throb of Dan's brain.
This was Sean O'Flaherty, pensioned off by Roger Stone two years
ago. This afternoon his son Francis had begged for leave to visit
the ailing father, had not returned by nightfall. Now King knew
he would never return. This was not the first visit the apes had
made here tonight...</p>

<p>There was a sudden rattle in the old man's throat, the frail,
tortured body arced, blood gushed from between thin lips. Then
Sean O'Flaherty fell back, was still.</p>

<p>"A fighter to the last," King muttered. Evidently the old man
had been aroused from a numbed coma by the noise of his and
Naida's entrance, had thought them the simian marauders
returning, had dragged himself along the floor on a mission of
vengeance.</p>

<p>"Dan. Oh Dan," Naida quavered, shuddering. "What is going on
here? What awful thing is going on?"</p>

<p>King got his arm around her, held her close. "I thought I
could keep it from you&mdash;but listen..." Rapidly, concisely,
he told her of those past terrible weeks. "That's why I was in
such a rush to get to the plant, you'd be safe there.
Now&mdash;with the car wrecked&mdash;I don't know what we're
going to do."</p>

<p>"They're afraid of the gun, Dan. They ran away when you
fired."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I've got a hunch they'll be back, Naida.
There's something peculiar about those apes, about the whole
thing&mdash;the grim, purposeful way they fight, the peculiar
whistle that controls them... I have a queer feeling that a human
is behind their activities, some human fiend..."</p>

<p>He broke off. The thrum of an approaching car came clearly in,
rose to a roar, cut off. King wheeled to the door as footsteps
thudded, lifted his shotgun. "Hello there," someone called.
"Hello inside. Anything wrong?"</p>

<p>"Who's there?" King challenged. "Who is it?"</p>

<p>"That you, King...? Thought I recognized your car. This is
Fenton&mdash;Warren Fenton of Hiawatha."</p>

<p>"Wait." King reached the door, pulled aside the table. Fenton
came in, slim, dapper, his sharp face anxious.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;" he began. "Oh, hello, Miss Stone. I didn't know
you were..." Then his expression changed as he saw King's weapon,
as his eyes darted to the corpse on the floor. "Great Jupiter!
What's happened?"</p>

<p>"Plenty," King snapped. "The damn beasts that've been raising
hell around the country got one of my best men here&mdash;killed
this poor old man, almost got us. Apes, Fenton, great apes
running wild!"</p>

<p>"I'll be damned. Apes!" Astonishment was vivid in the man's
face. Was it acting or... King quenched the half-formed thought.
Nonsense. He couldn't have anything to do with them. "Have you
notified the police?" Fenton finished.</p>

<p>"The police! I've been trying to get Miss Stone to a place of
safety. Take us to Mayflower, will you Fenton? I think we can get
through now."</p>

<p>"Can't. I'm sorry. I've got to get back to the plant right
away on the hop. But I pass the Stone place, I'll drop you off.
You can 'phone the cops from there and I'll chase some of my
guards over to help you till they come."</p>

<p>"Take us to your plant. I'm afraid..." King checked at
Fenton's narrowed eyes, at the suspicion flaring in them. "Oh all
right," he said wearily. "I understand. You're afraid I'll see
your secrets."</p>

<p><br>
THE inside of the Big House was musty-smelling, fetid with the
dust of disuse. Dan King locked the tall entrance door as Naida
switched on a light. He turned. "Where's the 'phone?"</p>

<p>Naida's hand came up to her throat. "Dan! I forgot! It's no
good. We had it disconnected when we left."</p>

<p>A pulse throbbed in King's temple, but he managed a grin.
"Never mind. Fenton's guards will be here soon. You go and wash
those smudges off your sweet face. I'll stay on watch down here
with this gun, but I don't think there's any real danger any
more. We're too close to Hiawatha for them to attack us." He knew
there was neither rhyme nor reason in the words, but he had to
say something to quiet the girl's apprehension, to dim the little
fires of terrible fear in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I had rather stay down here with you, Dan. I'm
afraid. I'm deathly afraid."</p>

<p>The man made his tone firm. "Now do as I say. What kind of
wife are you going to make if you're going to argue every time I
tell you to do something?"</p>

<p>Naida smiled wanly. "Wife. How good that sounds! All right,
dear. I'll obey." She turned from him, climbed tiredly
upward.</p>

<p>King's tortured gaze followed her till she was out of sight on
the landing above. Her small feet pattered along the upstairs
hall. From outside leaves rustled, somehow ominously. Was it the
wind soughing through the foliage or...? Apprehension swelled
within him, tightened a squeezing hand to his heart. Then sudden
anger brought a pulsing, red mist before his eyes. He wouldn't
cringe here, waiting for an attack. He would go out, drive them
away. He shot back the door-bolt, was outside.</p>

<p>Night shrouded the landscaped grounds, lay like a silent
death-shroud over the lawn. The thick bole of an ancient locust
blocked his vision and he strode a pace or two forward to get
beyond the obstruction. A huge shadow dropped out of its foliage,
hurtled down on him. The back of his head crashed against the
tree-trunk and the World exploded into whirling, coruscating
nothingness...</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; FLIGHT THROUGH THE
TREES</h2>

<p class="first">PAIN was a dark sea on which Dan King floated,
slowly lifting, slowly sinking to the long roll of its slow tide.
Now it changed to meshed network clothing his body, constricting,
relaxing, tightening again with a leisurely, demoniac pulse. Pain
throbbed in his every cell, his every sinew. It bathed him,
seeped through him&mdash;a dull, queasy agony as though molten,
hot quicksilver had replaced his life-fluids.</p>

<p>Light beat against his closed lids, searing his eyeballs,
pressing against them like gouging thumbs. King moaned. Dim
thought crawled within him and summoned up a nightmare memory of
whispering voices, vague forms moving in a blaze of white light,
piercing black eyes set in a swarthy face the lower half of which
was grotesquely obliterated by white blankness. There had been a
horrific black countenance, too, somewhere in the seething,
vertiginous phantasmagoria&mdash;a dark browless visage that had
been primitive evil incarnate... Steel had flashed, sharp steel
descending toward him...</p>

<p>There was a stiffened silence about his torment, and the
feeling of walls closing him in, and a sense of utter
helplessness. Where was he, what had happened to him? What had
happened to Naida whom his carelessness had betrayed? Had the
apes...? <i>Naida!</i> The name was a tortured shriek in his
blurred consciousness...</p>

<p>He was on his feet, staring about him wild-eyed, reeling with
vertigo engendered by pain. He was in a small, white-walled room.
The bed on which he had been lying was its only furnishing. There
was an open window high up over the bed&mdash;but it was steel-
barred.</p>

<p>King staggered to the door of the cell-like room. It was
locked. He backed away, hunching a shoulder, crouching for a
battering rush at it.</p>

<p>Sounds came from beyond the door, the padding movements of
some ponderous body. Something brushed against the panel like
bristles of a hairbrush scraping across it. Hair lifted at the
back of King's neck and his lips snarled back from his teeth. A
key clicked over and a throaty voice rumbled, outside.</p>

<p>Fear exploded in Dan King's soul, fear of that which was
outside, of that which was coming in. He whirled, leaped to the
bed. Reached high, grasping the bars, and pulled himself up to
the sill, crouched in the window embrasure. Behind him hinges
squealed, and an animal fetor, a bestial miasma, tainted the
air.</p>

<p>He dared not look back, down. His hands folded around the
bars, wrenched. Incredibly the steel rods were bending, were
twisting. Strength surged up in him. He felt muscles bulging
across his back, felt his upper arms swell, his neck cording.
Stone split with a sharp report and the bars were lose in his
hands. He lurched out through the opening, toes gripping the
framework.</p>

<p>His legs straightened, catapulting him out from the sill,
hurling him in a long arc out through darkness. Foliage was a
rustling, blacker silhouette against a black sky and his arms
flung out ahead of him, fingers curling. Leaves whipped across
his face, twigs lashed him, and his clutching hands closed on
rough bark of a limb that bent, dipped under the sudden weight of
his body, but held. He pendulumed, threshing through the treetop.
He let go of the branch he held, was falling, falling&mdash;had
caught a still thicker branch where it forked out of the
trunk.</p>

<p>His heels dug, rasping, into the bole; his knees clutched it.
He was immobile, frozen against the friendly tree. He looked
back, peering squint-eyed. Leaves, branches, were blackly laced
across a white square that stared at him out of a dark wall.
Great God! It was yards away from the nearest bough that could
have supported him. He couldn't have jumped that distance! No man
could have, impelled by whatever panic, by whatever terror.</p>

<p>But he had done it, amazingly he had done it and he was free.
For the moment at least. From somewhere below shouts came, and a
lane of light lay suddenly across greensward. Shadows cut it, the
shadows of running men, of beings formed like man. King chuckled,
was on the move. Some instinct told him how to do it, how to use
his new found strength, his new dexterity in swinging through
these treetops, in walking surefooted along bending limbs. He
made no more noise through the leaves than the light breeze.</p>

<p>The sounds of the hunt travelled off, the hunters at fault. He
would have liked to see them&mdash;known who it was that had
taken him captive. The mystery of the terror, he knew, lay there
for him to fathom. But a greater need drove him, a greater
emergency. He must get away from here. He must get to the Big
House on the Shore Road and find out if Naida were safe.</p>

<p>Dan King's nostrils flared. He had never before noticed how
the damp night emphasized odors. He could distinguish the fresh
green aroma of growing plants, other smells, staler, that
reminded him of a zoo. From his right came a mixed odor of road-
tar, gasoline, oil, a smell that could be made by nothing else
but a highway. That was where he must go, then, to the right.</p>

<p>The clump of trees which was an easy path to his uncanny skill
petered out. But the last branch arched over a high wall, and
from beyond that the road-smell came very strong. Dan King worked
out along the bough, hand over hand, till it dipped beyond the
barrier. The highway was fully fifteen feet below, but, not
stopping to think, King let go his hold.</p>

<p>He swopped downward, landed on all fours. Bent arms and legs
took the shock like springs. He was scarcely shaken. He rose,
threw an apprehensive glance about him. The sky was overcast and
it was very dark, but somehow his sight, like his sense of smell,
had grown keener, more acute. He made out the high lift of the
wall over which he had come, its crenellated top, running off
into the distance. There was only one wall like that near
Cranport, the one bounding the old Fosdick Estate where the
Salburn Shows wintered. The Salburn Shows... Speculation stirred
within him, eluded him...</p>

<p>The physical prowess, the sense of well-being that filled him
despite the still throbbing ache to which he had awakened seemed
to be matched by a corresponding mental sluggishness. What was
the urgency beating at him, the dread that blanketed him? Oh yes!
Naida! He must get to Naida's home, must find out whether she was
there, whether&mdash;they had taken her, too.</p>

<p><i>They...</i> The thought made him afraid again, dreadfully
afraid. He was loping down the dark road. He stooped over, his
arms hanging loosely in front of him, his hands curled. He could
run faster that way. He came out into a broader boulevard. An
orange light hung over the intersection from a wire running
across between two tall poles. This was Shore Road, the Big House
stood a mile to the left.</p>

<p>King started to turn in that direction. Sudden light blazed
all about him. He whirled, saw an interurban trolley driving down
upon him. It meant help, help to get quickly to Naida, human aid
to battle the menace of the apes so mysteriously ravaging the
countryside. He lifted his arm in signal. Brakes grated, the
trolley was slowing. It loomed over him, the motorman peering
out. The man's face went suddenly livid, incredulous terror
flared into his eyes. And the car picked up speed, thundered
past, careened down the road.</p>

<p>King stared after it, stunned. The fear of death had been in
that florid countenance. What was there about himself to...?</p>

<p>He shrugged away dazed speculation. He had no time for
pondering, no time to fathom the car-man's startling behavior. He
must get to the Big House, must get to Naida. He was loping,
bent-legged, shambling-footed along concrete hot with the August
sun that burned his feet. He swerved to grass plots at the
sidewalk's edge, found the footing firmer, easier. He sprinted
past widely separated dwellings that were lightless, blind.
Nobody lived out here any longer, they had moved into the center
of the town to huddle for mutual protection against the frightful
creatures that came by night to carry people off from their very
beds. He'd been a fool, a witless dunce to have let Fenton
persuade him to take Naida to the Big House.</p>

<p>Oh God! Was she there? Was she in the grim structure, back
there in the woods, suffering Satan alone knew what tortures? He
stopped stark-still, paralyzed by sudden indecision. Should he go
on? Perhaps he should go back for help...</p>

<p>A siren wailed in the distance, the siren of a police cruiser!
It screamed nearer, coming fast. Thank God! Oh, thank God! He
would stop them, tell them what he knew! Here was help! The car
rushed nearer, its headlights two green spots in the darkness.
King jumped out in the road, waving his arms above his head,
shouting.</p>

<p>The siren cut off. An orange spark flashed among the dark
bulks of the hurtling car's occupants. Another. Dust spat from
the concrete in front of him, a car track clanged, and tardily
the double crack of rifle shots reached Dan King. They were
shooting at <i>him! At him!</i> Gun-flare spat again, and
something zoomed past King's ear, like a buzzing, virulent
bee.</p>

<p>He spun around, a black mass of trees looming at the roadside.
He leaped for them, was in among them, was scrambling up a shag-
barked trunk. The police car squealed to a stop, through the
leaves he saw men spraying out of it, rifles like sticks in their
hands. They were in under him.</p>

<p>"We've got the damn devil!" someone shouted. "He's in here
somewhere. Anyone sees him, shoot to kill!"</p>

<p>Underbrush threshed as heavy, sweating men ploughed through
it. The sharp odor of their bodies stung King's nostrils. He
could tell where each one was by the hiss of his breathing, by
his aroma. He slipped silently through the arborage, working
west, toward the Big House. He was quivering within. He was a
hunted beast, an outcast. By some strange trick of fate every
man's hand was against him, to capture, to slay.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; MAN INTO BEAST</h2>

<p class="first">THE trees along the route he took were evenly
spaced in long rows that spread away from him on either side. The
tang of rotted, fermenting apples was acrid. This was an old
orchard, abandoned, run wild. Recollection stirred. There was
just such an orchard alongside the Stone mansion. Was this it?
Was he so near, so very near? So near, and so damnably
far&mdash;with armed men below him, eager to blast him with their
bullets, to make carrion of him...</p>

<p>Foliage thinned. He was at the end of the grove. He lay along
a bough of the last tree and squinted out. A pulse thumped in his
temple. There it was, the place that was called the Big House,
majestic against the lowering heavens. The roof over the kitchen-
addition jutted out at him from the high blackness of a
windowless wall; ended below him, thirty feet away.</p>

<p>Man-smell was pungent in King's nostrils. His hackles rose,
and he peered down into the murk of the cleared space between. A
still, shadowy figure was down there, tense. Light from somewhere
glinted on metal, the barrel of a rifle!</p>

<p>Dan's neck swelled. Small muscles in his face knotted,
tightening his upper lip in a soundless snarl. Saliva drooled
from the corners of his mouth. This was one of the men who had
shot at him, who were hunting him down. He was waiting there,
waiting to kill Dan King, to keep him from his mate. Hate was a
dark flood in his brain, hardening into sly craftiness.</p>

<p>King gathered his legs and arms under him, slowly, carefully,
so as to make no warning sound. He was crouching now on the
bough, his sinews quivering with leashed eagerness.</p>

<p><i>Now!</i> He dropped, fierce hands outstretched, down on his
enemy. A white face flashed up at him, and he pounded down on the
man. His fingers flashed to a soft throat, dug in. The body under
him arched. Hands tore at his strong arms that were like columns
of steel. Eyes stared into his own out of a purpling face, eyes
black with agony and incredulous terror.</p>

<p>King's blood ran riot with triumph. In savage longing he
wanted to tear, rend this weakling he had so easily conquered.
Wild laughter rattled in his chest. His knees crunched into a
soft belly. He gouged viciously...</p>

<p>The eyes into which he glared glazed over. The man was
struggling no longer, was limp. Suddenly Dan King retched.
Realization swept him with a sick nausea, and his throttling
claws opened. Good Lord! What was it he was doing? What in God's
name was this ferocity that boiled turbulently within him, this
clamor to kill, to destroy, to sink his teeth into warm flesh? He
rolled away, rose, stood trembling, shivering with a grisly
dread.</p>

<p>A whistle shrilled. Others answered, one by one, from every
point of the compass. A long quiver ran through the flaccid
figure on the ground, and pulled-in breath squeeched.</p>

<p>"Who's missing?" a distant voice said. "Someone didn't
answer." Then, "Jack!" Alarm was a knife edge in the bawled
call. "Jack Parker! Where are you?"</p>

<p>"The other side of the orchard!" another voice. "Hell! Maybe
the blasted thing got him." Running sounds came nearer, fear-shot
curses. "Jack! Jack!"</p>

<p>Panic blazed in Dan. He whirled away, leaped the steps of the
kitchen, twisted its door knob. The portal resisted him; he
crashed a huge fist at the dull gleam of the key-plate. Metal
snapped, and the door flew open.</p>

<p>He was inside, had shut the door behind him, was crouched
against it. Muffled voices came through. "Here he is! Gees! He's
only half alive." "We'll never get the... now; he's out in the
fields." "The house...?" "Naw, it's locked up, the Stones have
been away for months. Come on guys, we've got to get Jack to a
hospital, quick." Voices hushed by dread, by a queasy terror of
something their owners did not understand. Sounds of thudding
feet, going away, of a whimpering moan. Sounds of a car rushing
away, police siren screaming its melancholy, fearful wail. Then
quiet...</p>

<p>Silence, and the musty smell of old meals in Dan King's
nostrils, of cold stove-metal. Darkness, and the feel of being
enclosed, the stifling sensation of being shut in&mdash;a sensing
of eerie shapes bulking about him, prickling his spine, bristling
the hairs at the back of his neck with taut fear.</p>

<p>He battled down frantic desire to get out of here&mdash;out
into the open. The house was so silent, so dreadfully still.
Naida! Oh God&mdash;they had taken Naida! She was gone! She was
back there in the place from which he had escaped and filthy,
lascivious paws were mishandling her palpitant
body&mdash;leathery black paws dripping with the blood of their
victims.</p>

<p>He sprang erect, unaware that his knuckles had been resting on
the floor, and thumped across a cold stone-place, out through a
doorway. He was at the rear of the wide entrance foyer, and
stairs lifted beside him, slanting up out of darkness into
darkness. His throat worked, whimpering. Her name blasted out of
his heaving chest.</p>

<p><i>"Naida,"</i> he shouted, despairingly, not daring to hope
for an answer. <i>"Naida!"</i></p>

<p>Small thumps struck the ceiling over him. A pale shape showed
above him, wraithlike, a shape he could just see through the
stair-rails. Then his heart leaped to a startled, fear-thinned
cry.</p>

<p>"Dan! Oh, Dan dear!"</p>

<p>"Naida! Are you all right? Are you...?"</p>

<p>She was coming down. "I've been so frightened, Dan. You were
gone when I looked for you, and Mr. Fenton's men never came. I've
been hiding up here in the dark, so terribly afraid. What
happened? Why did you go away?"</p>

<p>A switch clicked. Light sprang into being. The jetty cascade
of her hair framed her dear face, her curving, red lips.
Luminance struck through the sheer silk of her nightgown, limning
the luscious curves of her body. Hot desire swept Dan like an up-
surging wave, choked him. He wanted her, wanted... He came out
into the light.</p>

<p>Naida's mouth jerked open, and a scream knifed out of it. Her
eyes were wide, terrified. She spun around, dove for the great
front door beyond, her shriek ripping the dusty air. King sprang
after her&mdash;and something leaped at him, out of a doorway to
his left.</p>

<p>He whirled to it, met the glare of a horrific visage&mdash;a
brutish, hairy countenance. A pallid arm flailed out at him. He
crouched, then leaped to meet the Thing's leap. He crashed into
glass! Glass shattered about him, the shards ripped him.</p>

<p>The Thing was gone. No! It had never been there. Dan King
stared, incredulous, at the ruined remnants of a tall mirror! In
jagged fragments of glass still jutting from the frame, he saw
broken reflections of a white, unclothed torso, of a bristle-
blackened jaw.</p>

<p>Realization exploded in his reeling brain. The Thing he had
thought about to attack him had been his own reflection. It was
he! He was no longer Dan King. He was something half ape, half
man. He was a grotesque, loathsome freak, a thing of soul-
shattering horror, of terror unspeakable.</p>

<p>No wonder the motorman had been all but paralyzed with fear at
the sight of him! No wonder the police squad had come screaming
out to shoot him down like some unspeakable foulness! No wonder
Naida had plunged out...</p>

<p>Naida! He spun to the open door through which she had gone.
There she was, a white figure running across the lawn, running
toward a high hedge that half-screened the pale ribbon of the
highway. She screamed...</p>

<p>Two huge, black forms surged out of the greenery. Naida
twisted, shrieking, but they had her. She was thrown over the
shoulder of one, and the couple vaulted the hedge. A horn hooted,
beyond, and a car motor roared into action.</p>

<p>King catapulted out of the door, down the steps, hurtled
across the lawn, crashed through brambles. He was out in the
road, racing after the rushing sound of the auto. A red tail
light winked at him, mocking, dwindled to a point, vanished.</p>

<p>Oh God! Oh merciless God! She was in their clutches! His Naida
was in the power of those who had made him the unspeakable
monstrosity he was!</p>

<p>Scarlet rage shook Dan King, horror unspeakable gibbered at
him from rustling darkness. The terror-beasts had swooped upon
Naida. She was in the hands of grisly, cruel monsters who were
all the more terrible because of a mysterious, human intelligence
that seemed to direct them, control their outrages with a cunning
uncannily not brutish. Naida was in their hands, and he himself
was stamped with the mark of the beast, was an outcast against
whom every man's hand was turned. He was a changeling, besweared,
transformed by some evil metamorphosis, a leprous monster every
man must flee from in terror, or fight to kill. Naida was in
desperate danger, and he was powerless to help her, powerless to
summon aid&mdash;alone, weaponless, naked...</p>

<p>Naked! Clothed, hatted, he might not be so terrifying an
apparition. His awesome appearance masked, he might get close
enough to someone to explain himself, to tell his unbelievable
tale, get help to Naida before it was everlastingly too late.
Wait! The glimmerings of a plan began to form in his aching,
tortured brain. His own plant was miles away, far to the other
side of Cranport. But Fenton's was nearby, just over the ridge to
which the road began to mount. Men with guns were there,
autos...</p>

<p>He wheeled, sprinted for the open door of the Big House. Some
of Stone's clothes would surely be there! The need for haste
screamed at him. A terrible urgency hammered in his racked soul.
Hurry! Before the fiends had time to set to work on Naida! Hurry!
Before the man with the half-face and the piercing eyes could
consummate that awful change in her. Hurry! Please God, let him
be in time!</p>

<p><br>
KING lurched wearily along the ten-foot fence surrounding the
Hiawatha plant. He hadn't been able to button the trousers he had
found. Stone's shoes didn't fit him and he was still barefoot.
But the borrowed topcoat, tight across his shoulders hid his
nakedness and a broad-brimmed hat was pulled low down over his
face. If he could have shaved...</p>

<p>A five hundred watt lamp, ahead, spilled light in front of a
high gate. King got to the circle of glare, pounded on the
barrier. A small door in it opened, a man slouched out, short-
barreled rifle lying across his palms, finger on the trigger.</p>

<p>"What the hell?" he demanded, leering at King out of beady
eyes in a pinched, pasty-complexioned face. "What d'yer
want?"</p>

<p>"Get Fenton! Get the other guards, rifles, cars. I've located
the terror hideout and it's got Naida Stone," Dan King shouted.
No! Oh God! He couldn't make his tongue form another single human
word! <i>All that came out was a chattering roar, an animal cry,
wordless, unmeaning.</i> His skin was a cold sheath for his body,
ice-crystals formed in his veins, damming the blood-rush. The
change was still going on, he was more nearly an ape now, a
beast. <i>He had lost the faculty of human speech!</i> He could
no longer tell this man, tell anyone, what he wanted, what was
happening to Naida, how to find her!</p>

<p>The man's gun jerked up, snouted at Dan's chest. "Come out o'
there," he growled. "Come out before I blow yer guts t'rough yer
backbone." Amazingly there was no surprise in his tone, no fear.
Only gruff command.</p>

<p>King jerked his arms up over his head. His hand touched the
brim of his hat in passing, knocked it off. The guard
grunted.</p>

<p>"Hey Harry, Gyp," he bawled, not turning, keeping his weapon
rock-steady on King. "C'm out here. Look what I got. One o' the
monks dressed up, walkin' around saucy as ye please an' bawlin'
at me."</p>

<p>Two other low-browed, high cheek-boned roustabouts ran out
into the light. "Hell," one yawned. "Yuh're drunk, Baldy.
It's&mdash;" He saw King, stopped. "By Gawd, so it is. Someone's
goin' ter get the works fer this funny business."</p>

<p>Their talk, their acceptance of his unholy appearance, trailed
an impossible speculation across the dizzy chaos of King's mind.
But what mattered now was that he had to make them understand,
had to get help to Naida. He licked his lips, tried again. All he
could manage was senseless chatter.</p>

<p>"Bring it inside." The one called Harry seemed of a slightly
higher caliber, was not quite as uncouth, as gangster-like, as
the others. There was something vaguely familiar about his broad
features, his narrow, agate-hard eyes. "March it over to the
barracks. I'll 'phone up you're comin'."</p>

<p>Then King remembered that face&mdash;pictured under flaring
headlines. "Bollinger Leads Jail-Break. Public Enemy No. 1 and a
Dozen Lifers Shoot Way to Freedom!"</p>

<p>"Christmas!" Gyp mouthed. "There's goin' ter be hell ter pay
over this. The boss is goin' ter want ter know how it got out,
an' why. I vote fer bumping it off an' ditchin' it in th' swamp.
That way, the boss won't know nothin' about it."</p>

<p>King shook his head, trying to clear it. Dread closed in about
him once more. These men would kill him out of hand, and then
Naida was lost, irretrievably lost.</p>

<p>"You was on the wall this evenin', wasn't you, Gyp?" Bollinger
said softly, meaningfully. "Or was you in th' guardhouse playin'
poker when you <i>ought</i> to have been on the wall, watchin'
that none o' them got out?"</p>

<p>"Hell!" Gyp swung around on him. "What's it to you where I
was." He reached under his left arm-pit, cursing. An automatic
was suddenly in Bollinger's hand. Baldy's gaze shifted to the
byplay.</p>

<p>King saw his chance. He leaped, lashing at Baldy's gun.
Somehow it was in his hand. It was a club he swung full-force
against the man's head. It landed, crunched sickeningly. There
was no longer a face where it had struck&mdash;just a puffy,
blood-covered place. He was past Baldy's falling body, had
smashed a devastating fist against Bollinger's jaw, had whirled
to the other man. That one gaped, his eyes goggling, his mouth
open. King left the ground in a long leap. As he came down his
hand clamped on the wrist of a hand which was rising with a black
automatic in it.</p>

<p>He twisted. Bone cracked and the man screamed, piteously.
King's other hand, the clubbed gun somehow jolted from it, found
the fellow's throat. He felt gristle scrape under his powerful
constriction, saw blood gush from the fellow's mouth. Wild
triumph surged in him... Then the roar of a gun blasted from the
ground behind him.</p>

<p>A red hot iron seared across King's scalp, darkness exploded
inside his skull. He slid down into a sick blackness...</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE HELL-SURGEON'S
LUST</h2>

<p class="first">THE crash of a stamping machine, the scream of a
power-lathe, seeped into Dan King's sodden sleep. For weeks, for
months, those sounds had pounded their infernal obbligato into
the cat-naps he had snatched wherever outraged nature had finally
asserted itself. The crash of machinery, the strain under which
he was working, the grisly, mysterious menace of the terror
outside, had given birth to weird nightmares, troubling even the
sleep of utter exhaustion. This last one had been a beauty...</p>

<p>King forced his leaden lids open. He was lying on the floor of
the assembling-room balcony, was faced so he could look down on
its floor. He blinked, dazedly. Queer! Was he still dreaming?
Those weren't men posted along the moving conveyor. Not men
tightening bolts, fitting in gears, bearings, building cars as
they moved past. <i>They were apes</i>, huge black apes, brute-
visaged, hairy, their grotesque hands flashing with uncanny skill
like&mdash;like the chimpanzee he had killed at the Salburn
Shows, that memorable night.</p>

<p>Realization blasted through him. No! It wasn't a dream. Would
to heaven that it were! Great Lord above! These weren't his own
works! This was the Hiawatha plant. Those <i>were</i> great apes
working down there, dexterously, with a deftness no human could
surpass. They were apes! No wonder Fenton could cut under his
price, cut it down to where there was no possible leeway for
paying labor. <i>He didn't pay labor?!</i></p>

<p>Fenton had been at the show that night, had seen the miracle
Zortal's eerie genius had accomplished, the training of a brute
to do everything a man could do. He had made a dicker with the
trainer, had gotten him to train hundreds of the animals...</p>

<p>To train! Good Lord, where could they have gotten so many,
trained them all in so short a time? Full understanding swept on
King like a dark avalanche. They didn't <i>train</i> them! They
<i>made</i> them! They took humans and by some Satanic alchemy
turned them into chimpanzees, set them to work with escaped
convicts&mdash;killers&mdash;as guards over them. As guards, not
to keep out the terror that had devastated Cranport&mdash;<i>to
keep it in!</i> Fenton, Zortal, were the prime movers of the
frightful scene&mdash;the demons behind it! It was they who had
desolated Cranport's homes, shucked them like crackling nuts to
extract the kernels that were food for their greed! That demoniac
chemistry was at work in his own blood, was making an ape of him,
was turning him into one of these brutish monstrosities...</p>

<p>It was no dream. Oh God! It had been no dream. His long
odyssey of terror, the weird alternation of man and beast within
him&mdash;now one, now the other ascendant&mdash;had been no
nightmare. He had not dreamed the hunt through the orchard, and
Naida's capture.</p>

<p>Naida, his Naida was in their hands, they were at work on her.
They were making an ape of Naida! Dan leaped to his feet,
<i>tried to leap</i>. Cords cut into his arms, his legs. Cords
gashed him, held him immovable. He was bound, helpless to save
himself, to save Naida...</p>

<p>He groaned, rolled over. Feet thudded, and Bollinger's
narrowed, murderous gaze looked down at him. A livid bruise
decorated the gangster's jaw; there was clotted blood on his
lips.</p>

<p>"So you're awake, you...!" The epithet dripped foulness. "I've
got a mind to smash your brains out like you did poor
Baldy's."</p>

<p>King stared up at him. Even this killer, this calloused spawn
of the underworld, would help Naida if he knew what was being
done to her. He must tell him about Naida!</p>

<p>"Woof, waroo," he chattered. "Grrumph."</p>

<p>Horror, despair, twisted his vitals. Intelligible speech was
gone from him forever, speech and the last glimmering chance of
aid for Naida.</p>

<p>"Cripes," Bollinger gritted. "I don't know why Zortal says you
got to go back so he can finish you up. Your face looks like a
monk's now, even if you ain't got no hair on your chest, and you
sure talk like one. Here, see how you like this."</p>

<p>He stooped, swiped vindictively at King's head with his open
palm. There was the glint of metal in it, then the flat of an
automatic crashed against King's temple. Pain split through his
head. He arched up, throwing himself at his tormentor, fell back
as thongs cut into his arms, his legs. Bollinger rained blows
upon him, snarling, eyes slitted and gleaming sadistically.
King's head was ringing. Dizzy black clouds were swirling before
his sight, through the agony of the terrible beating. He
writhed... was dimly aware that the blows had stopped. He clung
to shreds of consciousness desperately and heard another voice
above him: "Harry, you fool, quit that. Zortal will tear your
liver out for it."</p>

<p>"The hell with Zortal. Nobody cracks Harry Bollinger an' gets
away with it. If Zortal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up, you ass. Here he comes."</p>

<p>King couldn't get his eyes open, couldn't think. He lay in his
welter of agony and heard approaching feet click, heard an eager
voice snap. "Where is he? Where's the rat that escaped?"</p>

<p>"Right here, Mr. Zortal. Here on the floor."</p>

<p>Through his nausea, through the black clouds swirling about
him, drawing him down into their oblivion, King was conscious of
someone standing above him, of an inimical, hating gaze beating
down on him.</p>

<p>"Who did that? Who beat him up like that?"</p>

<p>Bollinger replied, "I did. He sloughed me an' I took it out o'
him. What do you say to that."</p>

<p>There was the sudden sharp sound of an open hand slapping
flesh. "This," Zortal snapped. "This."</p>

<p>A howl of rage and the sound of a scuffle followed. A soothing
voice spoke: "Hold it, Harry. Y'gotta take it an' like it.
They've got us dead to rights, remember. If they turn us in we
burn."</p>

<p>King lost his slender hold on awareness and went down, down
into a miasmic darkness, into a stupor that was not quite wholly
unconsciousness, so that vague intimations reached him of his
being lifted and carried off, of the rattle and sway of a moving
auto, of his being carried again. He was viciously thrown down on
some hard footing, the shock of the impact brought merciful
oblivion...</p>

<p>When consciousness drifted back, a fetid, animal odor,
assailed King's nostrils. He forced his heavy-lids open to
darkness that pressed in on his eyeballs. He lifted
instinctively; dazedly unsurprised that he was no longer bound.
Dread sucked at him like the stinking mire of a bog and red
sparks drifted in the blackness. Spots of red-glowing fire came
menacingly toward him. Fear flared within him, and even in that
moment of overpowering terror and awful despair, plucked at the
very vitals of his being, as the thought of Naida seared across
his pulsing brain. Then something growled in the sightlessness,
and, black against black, he was aware of a plunging, gigantic
bulk.</p>

<p>Sudden light sprayed in and Zortal stood framed in a doorway.
The illumination showed Zortal, showed a huge ape leaping at
King. Zortal's arm was uplifted, a lash hissed from its quick
down-flick, writhed around the beast's belly, flung it
backward.</p>

<p>King crouched, leaped at Zortal. The whip caught him with a
fiery sting, stopping his rush. It jerked away, struck again,
cutting into him, wrung a squeal of agony from his hoarse throat.
He slammed to the ground, groveled, his arms covering his head,
his body quivering to the virulent, merciless torture of the
lash.</p>

<p>It stopped at last, leaving him a broken, bleeding thing.
"That's your lesson, King," the man snarled. "You'll behave, now,
till I come back for you." He laughed, gloatingly, humorlessly,
and there was grisly threat in the weird cachinnation.</p>

<p>He turned to the ape that had been attacking King, and his
whiplash flicked out, driving the brute before him, driving the
lumbering anthropoid out of the doorway. King saw a passageway
beyond, then the door slammed shut, cutting off light.</p>

<p>He lay prostrate, whimpering, beaten, heedless to the rustling
sound of another simian coming toward him. Death would be welcome
now, death would release him from the torturing thought of his
loved one helpless in the hands of the sadistic demon. But a
rough tongue licked his wounds, warm spittle drooled along his
aching flank. A shudder of revulsion shook him. He rolled
away...</p>

<p>Above him a square of light, crossed by a close pattern of
black bars, flared into existence. King rolled to it, struggled
upright, reached hands up to its sill. He pulled himself up,
looked through... Horror burst upon him&mdash;soul-shaking
horror...</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">NAIDA STONE came awake to the terror of the dark
room where she had been imprisoned, to the terror of wall-
muffled, bestial roaring. Her bare feet thudded as she leaped
from the bed, her heart pounding, fear clutching her throat. She
crouched, staring into darkness. The ferocious sounds suddenly
ceased, after one wild, high shriek of an animal in torment. But
the silence that followed seemed alive with furtive movement.</p>

<p>The outlines of her cell became vaguely visible&mdash;the
glimmer of walls, the darker outlines of a door. Naida bit her
lip, forced her cold limbs into motion. She reached the door,
found the knob. But there was no use; it was still locked as it
had been when first she had recovered consciousness and had
battled for release, only to sink at last into a stupor of
exhaustion.</p>

<p>A sob formed in her chest, welled out from between her
writhing lips. What was happening out there? What <i>had</i>
happened? Were the monsters whose prisoner she was battling for
her, for possession of her? Had one conquered, was he even now
coming for her? Footfalls thumped beyond the door, came nearer. A
scream contorted her vocal cords, then aborted in a soundless
rasp. The knob twisted in her hand that still held it and a key
clicked.</p>

<p>Naida's shoulder was against the panel, her legs were stiff,
her feet gripped the floor. The door moved in, slowly,
inexorably. A slit of light at its edge increased as the girl's
bulging eyes watched it, widened&mdash;and she could not stop
it. A black hand showed, jogging the light, closed on the door-
edge. With the additional leverage the barrier swung more rapidly
inward. Naida's legs buckled, and she slid to the floor, lay
there quivering.</p>

<p>Shoes tramped in along the path of light. Shoes! Relief flared
in Naida, and she rolled over, looked along trousered legs, along
a white robe, seamless, to stocky shoulders of a white-gowned man
looking down at her, his face swarthy, glowering.</p>

<p>The man was Zortal, the animal trainer she had seen at the
carnival so long ago! Understanding flashed through Naida's dizzy
brain, release from nightmare horror. In his absence some of his
apes had escaped, had carried her off. He had returned, punished
them, come to release her.</p>

<p>"Oh," she gasped. "Oh, I am so glad you are here. So
glad..."</p>

<p>She stopped, her scalp tightening. Why did he smile so grimly,
so menacingly, why did his black, piercing eyes fix upon her
unclothed form so hotly?</p>

<p>"You are glad," slow words dropped down to her. "That makes me
happy. I had not anticipated such a reception."</p>

<p>Her lips were icy. "What&mdash;what do you mean?" she managed
to ask. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>His smouldering look was a lewd caress. He gestured. "What
could I mean, gazing at a body so beautiful, so divine. The
actuality is even lovelier, more enticing than the promise I
discerned when I first saw you. Do you remember, that night at
the circus when your lover killed my clever creature, the first
reward of my researches, and incurred my undying hatred? I have
not forgotten, I hated him for that, and I hated him even more
because you were his. I promised him a special fate, but I
promised myself&mdash;<i>you!</i>"</p>

<p>Naida twisted, was on her feet. "No," she choked. "No! You
beast, you filthy beast! I'd die before I let you touch me!"</p>

<p>Zortal's lids narrowed. Through their slits his eyes were
somehow reptilian, and there was a hiss in his accents. "You
disdain me?" He shrugged, and his smile was an obscene grin
twisting across his face. "You refuse Zortal the Great? Well,
Zortal shall not force you, but he shall have you. Willingly he
shall have you. Come."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; DEATH AND HORROR
BLENDED</h2>

<p class="first">TO Naida's agonized comprehension it was clear
only that he had retreated from his monstrous proposition, that
he was motioning her to the door. She went past him, out into a
lighted corridor.</p>

<p>"To the right," Zortal called. "The door to the right."</p>

<p>The girl whirled, snatched at the door she saw before her. It
opened, she plunged through, stopped, aghast. This was not the
way out! It was another room. A table flashed before her vision,
its top a white slab at the sides of which angle-irons rose,
centered by open metal cuffs. Near the table a great ape
squatted, its handcuffed wrists chained to the arms of the chair
in which it sat. Over the huge, hairy animal, steel bars were
fitted vertically across a great square opening in the
wall...</p>

<p>She spun about. Zortal was in the doorway, coming in, grinning
evilly, triumphantly. She sprang at him, clawing for his
lascivious eyes. He seized her wrist with one rubber gloved hand,
held her off, ripped her nightgown from her with his other. Even
in her terror, her outrage, a hot flush burned her cheeks as she
knew that she was naked before him.</p>

<p>He pulled her to him, his fiery breath gusting over her face.
His burning lips slobbered on hers. She flailed at him with her
free hand, with ripping nails.</p>

<p>He lifted her, insensible to her cries, her flailing nails,
the kick of her naked foot. He threw her on the table, and
magically her wrists were in the metal bracelets that he snapped
closed. Springing to the foot of the table, Zortal grasped her
flailing feet, forced them down, and cold metal clamped around
her ankles, held her helpless.</p>

<p>Naida's screams rasped into voicelessness, into terror-numbed
quiet. Zortal chuckled, threw a white sheet over her so that only
her heaving chest, her head were exposed. "I shall not share the
sight of your beautiful curves with another," he lipped, "just
yet."</p>

<p>The girl lay gasping, exhausted. Fear crawled gelid in her
veins, squeezed her pulsing brain. A hospital odor was acrid in
the thick air about her, blending with the fetid stench of the
ape. She turned her head to the brute, seeking its snouted, black
face rather than the evil, leering countenance of the man.
Movement above pulled her gaze to the cage-front.</p>

<p>Hands gripped the vertical bars, a face came into sight, a
hairy face. Oh God! A monstrous creature, ape-faced, man-bodied,
hung in the barred aperture, leering out at her, pounding at the
steel. It was the appalling beast from which she had fled when
Dan's call had brought her downstairs.</p>

<p>Dan! Mother of Mercy! Her soul was pronged with recollection
of the man she loved, with fear for him. This caged thing must
have struck him down, must have killed him even in the moment he
had called to her. Its mouth worked, hideously, stark madness
glared at her out of its eyes in which there was a shuddersome,
almost human semblance. Its long white arm reached out to
her...</p>

<p>"Antonio," Zortal called from the doorway. "Antonio, I am
ready." A surgeon's mask of white gauze was over the lower part
of his swarthy face, making him gargoylesque, somehow weird.
Another man came into the room. This one was also gowned in a
half-sleeved robe of white, was also masked with white gauze. A
white turban covered his skull, came low down on his brow, so
that all that could be seen of his face was agate-hard, merciless
eyes and thin nose.</p>

<p>"Who are you," Zortal spoke sharply. "You are not my
assistant..."</p>

<p>"No." The second man answered, hoarsely. "I'm Crandall, one o'
the guards. Antonio got sick and he knew I once studied medicine,
so he 'phoned up to the plant for me to come and help you. He
said for me to tell you that I wouldn't squeal&mdash;that you can
trust me."</p>

<p>Zortal appeared doubtful. "Can you give an anesthetic?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"Ether or gas?"</p>

<p>"Ether, on a cone."</p>

<p>"Sure thing."</p>

<p>"We shall go to work, then. The woman, first."</p>

<p>"She don't look sick."</p>

<p>Zortal laughed, shortly, gruesomely. "No, Crandall, she is not
sick. You are about to see such an operation as none of your
professors would believe possible. Only the great Zortal knows
the secret of it&mdash;and it shall die with Zortal. But this
much I can tell you, so that you may help me intelligently. I am
about to excise a certain gland from this chimpanzee and
transplant it in a new place, in the body of this woman&mdash;"
Zortal broke off. "There's the ether can, on the shelf behind
you, also the cone."</p>

<p>Crandall picked the things up, started dripping ether on the
mask that was to go over Naida's face. From a sterilizer Zortal
lifted a scalpel, came toward her. His eyes were wide now,
staring.</p>

<p>"Go on," Crandall muttered. "What's this gland business
for?"</p>

<p>Zortal's chuckle was the evil chortle of a madman&mdash;or a
fiend. "You shall see. In half an hour her human attributes will
fade. Her features will coarsen. She will chatter instead of
speaking. She will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A monk! D'you mean that's how...?"</p>

<p>"That is how I make the apes you have seen," explained Zortal,
nodding toward the ape-man shackled near the table. But Naida
heard no more.</p>

<p>"No," she screamed. "No! You can't do that to me. You can't
&mdash;!" Her body arched, straining against the metal that
gripped her wrists, her ankles. "Kill me&mdash;but don't do that
to me. Don't, don't, <i>don't!</i>"</p>

<p>Zortal bent over her, the keen scalpel poised. "You had your
chance. You refused me. Now you shall be unable to refuse. Before
the change is completed I shall possess you, and then I shall
give you to the others. You shall have the honor of proving
whether they can breed...!"</p>

<p>"Hey! Leggo!" Zortal whirled to Crandall's sudden shout. The
assistant's mask was ripped away by the clutch of the ape-man's
hand that had suddenly reached through the bars. The creature's
other long arm was clawing out for him, and he was snarling,
growling bestial fury. Crandall jumped forward, out of reach.</p>

<p>"Bollinger!" Zortal yelled. "You are Bollinger, not
Crandall."</p>

<p>There was suddenly a black automatic in the other man's fist.
"Yeah," he lipped. "Bollinger. D'ye think you were going to get
away with slapping me. Me!"</p>

<p>The ape-man behind the caged aperture roared with rage, his
bellow shaking the room, rattling the instruments within it.
Naida's screams added to the pandemonium, while the howls of
another simian that had come up beside the ape-man rent the air
as it aided him in shaking the bars, in tugging at them with a
violence, a fury, that seemed to be bending them.</p>

<p>But through the tumult Bollinger's shouted words impacted on
Naida's ears. "I conked Antonio and then I got into his clothes
thinkin' maybe I could muscle in on your racket before I put you
away. That's no good, but this still is." Gun-bark detonated
suddenly through the riot&mdash;then again and again. Orange
flame streaked at Zortal. On his white gown a red splotch showed.
Like a ripped meal-sack he crumpled to the floor.</p>

<p>The shock of it momentarily stilled the pandemonium. Naida's
screams choked off, the caged animals, the shackled beast-thing
in the room, were silent. Bollinger came slowly around to the
girl, advanced slowly to her side.</p>

<p>"Now, my pretty," Bollinger lipped, "let's look you over."
With his unoccupied hand he twitched away the sheet with which
Zortal had covered her. "Mmmm," he breathed, licking his lips.
"Ni-i-ce!"</p>

<p>Feet pounded outside, the door crashed open. "Zortal!" Naida's
father's voice sounded incredibly. "Have you heard anything of
Naida...?" He stopped abruptly, stood stark-still in the doorway,
his eyes on the girl. "Oh God! <i>Naida!</i>"</p>

<p>"Stone," Bollinger gasped. "What the hell are you after?"</p>

<p>The older man twisted to him. "Bollinger," he shouted. "You've
got a hand in this! I'll turn you over to&mdash;" Flat gun-report
stopped him, he swayed, his face suddenly greyed. He grabbed at
the table-end for support.</p>

<p>"Squeal on me, will you?" Bollinger gritted. "That'll shut
your trap."</p>

<p>"Murderer!" Naida shrieked. "You've killed him...!"</p>

<p>The ape in the chair lurched. His heavy seat toppled against
Bollinger, and the slayer stumbled backward, against the wall-
cage. Clutching, reaching out between the bars, the man-ape had
him. Strong fingers were about his neck, were digging in. The
man's eyes popped from their sockets, blood vomited from his
mouth. Then he hung, a limp, bedraggled, lifeless thing, from the
grip of the monster that had avenged Naida's father.</p>

<p>"Daddy," the girl yelled, futilely straining to get to him.
"Dad! Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>Roger Stone's tortured countenance turned to her. "Yes," he
gasped. His hand was clutched to his breast and wet redness
dripped through his fingers. "Yes. He&mdash;he got me. Can
you&mdash;forgive me, Naida&mdash;before I die?"</p>

<p>"Forgive you? For what?"</p>

<p>"For&mdash;all this. I&mdash;was the cause of it&mdash;all. I
couldn't&mdash;see you married to washwoman's son. I
had&mdash;bought Hiawatha that day from&mdash;United Motors.
King&mdash;didn't know it."</p>

<p>Color was draining out of his face, but somehow his voice had
grown stronger. "I planned to ruin Mayflower and King with
Hiawatha's competition, prevent your marriage that way. I motored
back here from Florida, by night, meaning to give Hiawatha the
new&mdash;car. It would take six months to adapt their plant. Too
long. Fenton told me about Zortal's miraculous act at the
carnival&mdash;and I got... idea. I sent for Zortal and he told
me what he could do. I was desperate&mdash;offered him Mayflower
when it failed&mdash;could be bought in for a song. He
accepted."</p>

<p>"But what did he do, Father? What was it he did for you?"</p>

<p>"Made apes of men so that we could have their work for
nothing. They kept only memory enough to be able to go on with
their usual work. It&mdash;" Stone gurgled, blood bubbled at his
lips, he lurched, dropped...</p>

<p>"Naida!" Dan's voice, hoarse, rumbling, sounded in the murder
chamber. "Naida!" The girl twisted. Her name was coming from the
lips of the being that had been in the cage! The being&mdash;it
was Dan. Dan! "Naida! Oh God! I can talk again. I can talk!"</p>

<p>With the help of the other beast-thing he had pulled some of
the bars out&mdash;escaped from the cage!</p>

<p>She fought the manacles chaining her to the table, surged
fruitlessly against them. "Dan! What have they done to you?"</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;changed yet!" came a new voice. A shirtless,
staggering man clung to the door-jamb, his hands clutching it,
blood streaming down his white, pain-twisted face, from a wound
in his scalp. "Not all changed. Started to, but not time for
transfusion&mdash;treatment to complete... job. Zortal hadn't
made transfusion yet. Gland alone&mdash;not enough, is being
absorbed. Man again&mdash;soon."</p>

<p>Antonio&mdash;it must be Zortal's assistant&mdash;pitched
forward, thudded down atop her father's sprawled legs.</p>

<p>"Thank God," Naida gasped. "Oh thank&mdash;" Running feet
pounded outside, a policeman barged in, a rifle coming up to his
shoulder. "What's all the shoot-in'...?" He stopped, gaped
unbelievingly at what the room held.</p>

<p>Naida's mouth twitched. "I... oh&mdash;" with a convulsive
shudder she fainted in the arms of Dan King, who could talk
again&mdash;who was slowly becoming a man once more!</p>  <hr>
