  <h2><a id="pro"
     name="pro"></a>PROLOGUE</h2>

<p class="first">DAN SAWYER was tired as he climbed the musty-
smelling, dimly lit stairs of the tenement. Tired, hungry and
despairing, he had walked the dreary streets all day, hearing
again and again the grunted, "No job for you&mdash;sorry." Half
the night he had paced the deserted sidewalks, trying to flog
himself into coming home, into facing the mute question in
Norma's eyes, into seeing hope drain out of them once more as his
head shook in silent negation. She wouldn't say anything, but she
would be thinking of Cora, of their little daughter's tattered
shoes and the insatiate demand of the child's growing body for
food they could not afford.</p>

<p>He hadn't eaten since his scanty breakfast, and there was no
strength in his legs. They buckled under him as he reached the
first floor landing, and he had to catch hold of the newel post
to keep from tumbling back down the stairs. Peeling, scabrous
wallpaper wavered in the flicker of a cheap light bulb, which
revealed the blurred lettering on the door he faced. Sawyer
couldn't read the sign, but he knew that it spelt:</p><br>

<p class="sign">
TOORAH<br>
WISDOM FROM BEYOND THE VEIL</p><br>

<p>The door burst open, and the pungent odor of incense gusted
out. Then it thudded shut. Two dark-clothed men crouched in front
of it, taut, listening. Sawyer peered at them, dazedly.</p>

<p>"Gawd," one whined, a weazened, undersized fellow. "I had to
do it."</p>

<p>"Shut up," the other grunted. "You're chattering too damn
much."</p>

<p>One big-shouldered, simian-armed brute was Lefty Lane,
Sawyer's neighbor across the landing, and the other was Hen
Reddon, from the top floor. Tough customers. But they weren't
tough now. They were shaking. Their faces were pallid, greenish,
and their dilated eyes were dark with some creeping terror.</p>

<p>"Come on, let's beat it before&mdash;Hey!" Reddon jumped
forward. His gloved hands grabbed Sawyer's shoulder, dug into it.
"This guy's seen us..." His other arm swept up. Against the light
Dan saw a stubbed, cruel rod of steel in its fist. His muscles
were waterweak, and Reddon's grip held him paralyzed. The rod
arced down to crash into his scalp, to scatter his brains...
Lefty's big paw grabbed it, wrenched it from the snarling
killer's hold.</p>

<p>"Be your age," he growled. "It's Dan Sawyer. Dan's all right.
Ain't yuh, Dan?"</p>

<p>Sawyer couldn't talk, couldn't answer. The thug seemed to take
his silence for assent. Lane's hand fumbled at Dan's and he felt
something hard in his palm. "Cache this for me," Lefty whispered.
"I'll get it from you later. My old woman gave it to Toorah for a
reading, an' I just made him give it back to me. I don't want her
to know about it, or she'll raise particular hell. Don't tell
your wife about it&mdash;or nobody. An' here's a fin for takin'
care of it for me."</p>

<p>Dan thrust the thing Lane had given him into a trouser pocket,
snatched at the bill. His brain was in a whirl, he couldn't think
straight. But he knew five dollars would mean the wolf pushed
away from the door for another week. He'd tell Norma he'd earned
it doing odd jobs along the shore.</p>

<p>"Hide it good," Lefty repeated, shoving him toward the
stairs.</p>

<p>Sawyer went on up mechanically. He didn't realize what had
happened, to what he had committed himself. All he knew was that
he wanted to get to Norma, to give her the money. A steel band
was about his head, was tightening till the very bone threatened
to collapse. He felt ill. There was a roaring in his ears.</p>

<p>Because of that roaring he did not hear Lane's whisper. "He'll
know he's in the mess with us when he finds out where that come
from. He's tied up pretty, an' he can't squeal."</p>

<p>Sawyer staggered, realized vaguely that he was on his own
landing. The door gave to his shaking, blind hand. The cold grey
of dawn filtered in through the window of his and Norma's room.
He reeled in, fell across the bed.</p>

<p>"Dan," Norma gasped, "what's the matter?" Her voice was miles
away and he couldn't see her. "Dan! You're sick. You're terribly
sick. I'm going for Doc Baldwin..."</p>

<p>The grey fog receded a little and the outlines of the
bedchamber were vaguely perceptible. Norma wasn't there. She had
gone away. There was something he had to do. Oh yes! Hide what
Lane had given him. Hide the... What was that?</p>

<p>Dan Sawyer's hand groped into his pocket. He stared at the
thing in his palm. It glowed there with milky, secret fires, like
a baneful eye glaring at him. It was a gem, an opal almost as
large as a pigeon's egg.</p>

<p>"Hide it!" Lefty's urgent command hammered at the throbbing
torture within Dan's skull. He lurched to his feet, started for
the door. The pain was excruciating now, and black clouds swirled
in his brain...</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1">I. &mdash; THE SEEKER COMES</a></h2>

<p class="first"> NORMA SAWYER came dreadfully awake. The
nightmare still clutched her heart with its gelid fingers. Her
decrepit cot creaked with the quivering waves of terror still
shaking her. She was no longer asleep, but dread was still a
tangible presence in the dark bedroom, a grisly threat.</p>

<p>Mother instinct directed Norma's wide, burning eyes through
the gloom to the pallid glimmer that was little Cora's crib.
There was no movement, utterly no movement there. Norma's scalp
tightened, her throat clamped on a scream. She pushed against the
mattress' yielding surface, shoved herself upright, swung cold
feet over the side of the bed... Sound impacted dully against her
ears, a dull thud, far off. It came again. It was a muffled
<i>pud</i> from the front of the small flat. From the door!
Someone was knocking at the door. That was what had awakened her.
A knock on the door. But it was past midnight! Who could be
demanding admission, so late?</p>

<p>"Daddy." The child's drowsy, small voice met her as Norma came
erect. "Is it Daddy, Momma, comin' home?"</p>

<p>Cora was all right. Of course she was all right. But pain
twisted in the mother's breast. "No, dear." It was hard to say
it, so hard. "It isn't Daddy. He's gone away&mdash;and maybe he's
not coming home any more. Go to sleep while mother sees who it is
knocking. If you go right to sleep mother will let you have sugar
on your cereal when you wake up in the morning."</p>

<p>"Awight. But I want my daddy." The six-year old's sleep-fuzzed
wail tore at Norma's heartstrings. "I&mdash;want&mdash;my
daddy&mdash;to come..."</p>

<p>The worn linoleum of the kitchen-living room was clammy-cold
to the bare soles of her feet, and the darkness clotted into
fearsome shadows in the corners. The knocking at the door was
steady now, measured and curiously insistent. Queerly muffled,
too, for all its persistence, as though the knuckles were swathed
in thick gloves. Or as though they were flabby, boneless.</p>

<p>Suddenly Norma knew that she was afraid&mdash;deadly afraid of
her midnight visitant. The strength seeped out of her legs, and,
in the small hall leading to the flat entrance, she wavered, had
to hold on to a door-jamb to keep from falling.</p>

<p>"Just&mdash;a minute," she gasped. Her words seemed to fall
flatly against the close air, but the one who knocked must have
heard them, for his rapping stopped. Was he someone from the
hospital? To tell her Dan was gone; that at last his tenuous hold
on life had slipped? For a week, now, he had lain there, white,
inanimate, only the faintest of possible pulses signaling that he
was not the corpse he seemed. If she could only have stayed there
with him&mdash;but she had to come back to Cora. Cora must not
know how sick her father was...</p>

<p>Sleeping sickness, they had told her. But she knew they did
not believe it themselves, as she did not believe them. They had
found him in the hall, his eyes open, a look of unspeakable
terror in them, but otherwise as one from whom life was gone.</p>

<p>They had taken him away to the hospital, but the terror had
lived on, almost tangible in the destitute flat. It had been a
black pall overhanging her, a brooding, intangible threat. And
this summons out of the night seemed a part of it.</p>

<p>"Open up." Door-muffled, a hollow voice jerked Norma back to
actuality "Let me in."</p>

<p>Her hand was on the cold doorknob, was supporting her lax
weight. She licked her dry lips. "Who it is? What do you
want?"</p>

<p>"The room. I've come to take it."</p>

<p>Momentarily Norma's dread gave way to elation. The sign she
had only tonight persuaded the corner druggist to let her put in
his window, had brought results already! Her desperate need had
demanded that she find a lodger for the chamber from which
searing memories barred her. The money that had been in Dan's
clenched, deathlike hand was spent. A dollar or two, whatever she
could get from a lodger, how much it would mean!</p>

<p>Before her fears surged back she had opened the door... Icy
prickles scampered along Norma's spine. She could see no one in
the vague light filtering up from the dim bulb on the landing
below. But the sense of a presence here before her was eerily
strong. Involuntarily she closed her eyes against it, shrinking
back.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Are you ill?"</p>

<p>There must be something wrong with her. She had not, perhaps,
altogether awakened from her dream. He had been there all the
time, the man who spoke. He must have been there. He could not
have formed, as her first terrified impression had been, from an
uncanny up-swirl of the shadows that lay as a heavy, ominous pool
between her and the stairhead. He was real, tangible, for all
that his long black ulster made his tall form shapeless, and his
broad-brimmed hat darkened his face so that Norma could see
nothing of it.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you must excuse me." The muscles around her lips
tightened, but she knew that she had not contrived the smile she
intended. "I was asleep when you knocked."</p>

<p>"Asleep? Is it so late?" he asked.</p>

<p>Queer. Didn't he know what time it was? "Yes&mdash;very," she
admitted.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;then if you will take me to the room, I shall not
disturb you longer."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but I did not intend to... I am alone here with my
child. I thought&mdash;some woman..." An eerie dread of the man
was thickening her tongue, was making it hard for her to
talk.</p>

<p>"I understand." What was there about his intonation that was
so outlandish? "But I am helpless as any woman. I
am&mdash;blind."</p>

<p>"Blind!" Quick, feminine pity leaped up in Norma, "Oh! How
terrible!"</p>

<p>"I shall not be&mdash;for long. I shall recover
my&mdash;sight&mdash;very soon." It sounded like a threat,
strangely, reawakening Norma's fear of him. "Nothing can stop me
from getting it back." He moved, coming toward her, as if to
enter. But Norma held her place in the doorway, barring his
entrance.</p>

<p>He halted. He stopped short, there in front of her, just
before he reached her, just before he touched her. How had he
known that she had not made way for him? Had the loss of his
sight sharpened his other senses so that the fragrance of her
breath, some warm aura, had warned him of the impediment to his
progress?</p>

<p>A quivering aversion, some psychic alarm bell deep within her,
warned Norma against him. But how could she turn a blind man from
her door at this hour? How could she send him out to wander in
the dismal streets...?</p>

<p>"I can pay." His misunderstanding of her reluctance to admit
him seemed almost deliberate. "I can pay well." There was a coin
in Norma's hand. She stared at it, the little hairs at the nape
of her neck bristling. He had not handed it to her. She was
certain he had not given it to her. But there it was, clutched in
her small fist, hard, and round and cold. "I imagine that will be
quite enough for a week."</p>

<p>There was some hint of mockery in the way he said it, as
though he were laughing at her. <i>Enough!</i> Good Lord! It was
gold. It was a verdigris-encrusted, worn disk of gold, and
although the almost obliterated letters graven on it spelled
words in some language Norma did not know, it was the size of a
ten-dollar piece. <i>Ten Dollars.</i> Shoes for Cora! A dress...
She had no right to refuse it. No right...</p>

<p>"This is the room. In here." He could not see. She must guide
him. She must lift her hand, put her fingers on his sleeve. Her
muscles were rigid, fighting the command of her brain which
itself quivered with inexplicable aversion. But she managed it.
She managed to touch him. Light as was that touch, the fabric of
his coat gave under the pressure, dented as though... <i>as
though there were no arm within it.</i></p>

<p>His feet made no sound on the bare boards of the floor. He was
swallowed by the dense lightlessness within that room. Norma
started after him to turn on the light, checked herself,
remembering that he had no need for light.</p>

<p>Her throat twitched with hysterical laughter. To stop it she
spoke. "The&mdash;the bathroom is next door. Right next door,
here to the left, Mister&mdash;Mister...?" He had not told her
his name.</p>

<p>He didn't answer the questioning inflection. For an eternally
long minute he did not answer. And suddenly it seemed that the
blackness of the room was starkly, staringly empty&mdash;that he
was no longer there...</p>

<p>And then the name rustled out to her "Malwa." It was a
bodiless whisper hanging in the dark. "I am called Malwa, the
Seeker." There was finality in its tone, dismissal.</p>

<p>Norma was conscious of a barrier before her, shutting her out.
The door was closed. It had swung silently shut, like a dark
curtain dropping. Stunning realization seared her. She had closed
that door days ago, <i>and she had not opened it now for
Malwa!</i></p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2">II. &mdash; THE MISSING SKULl</a></h2>

<p class="first"> THIS was madness. Nerves shredded by terrific
anxiety were breaking her long control at last, were tricking her
into insane illusions. For Cora's sake she had had to wear a
smiling face, to mask with laughter the fierce agony of her
breaking heart. Destitution, abject poverty, had made a long
purgatory for her; the strange illness of her husband, her lover,
a searing, poignant hell. Only in sleep had she found relief,
strength to endure. The breaking of that sleep tonight was
pushing her over the brink.</p>

<p>Norma's teeth bit into her lip. She would not give way. She
would not. There was nothing strange, nothing fantastic about the
blind man who had come out of the night. She should be happy,
grateful, that he had taken her room that he was paying so well
for it. She should thank God...</p>

<p>But she was trembling as she turned, as she made her way back
through the hall, through the kitchen, to the little back
room.</p>

<p>"He's gone, Mother," Cora's small voice greeted her,
whimpering. "Where did he go?"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear." The mother's admonition was inattentive,
automatic. "Hush. Why aren't you asleep?"</p>

<p>"I was. But he waked me up."</p>

<p>The child's amazing statement impacted on Norma's
consciousness. "Who woke you?" she questioned sharply. "What are
you talking about."</p>

<p>"Daddy. He kissed me and waked me up. There was a kind of blue
light all around him&mdash;and he looked awful scared. He was
going to tell me something, but the brown man put his hand on
Daddy's mouth, and pulled him away, and then it was all dark
again&mdash;and he wasn't here any more."</p>

<p>A tide of grisly terror rose about Norma once again. "You were
dreaming dear. You didn't really see them."</p>

<p>"I did so see them. I saw daddy and I saw the brown man. He
had a towel wound around on top of his head and he had a funny
mark on his face, like my vaccination."</p>

<p>Steady. Steady. She must not frighten the child. Whatever dark
dread writhed screaming through the recesses of her own soul, she
must fend terror away from her little daughter.</p>

<p>"How could you have seen them?" Norma laughed. "It is so dark
here you can't even see me. You dreamed it. And now you must go
right back to sleep, or you won't be able to get up on time for
school in the morning. Look. Mother will tuck you in, nice and
warm, and shut each eye with a kiss. There.
Sleep&mdash;sleep."</p>

<p>"Sleep! There will be no sleep any more for me," Norma was
thinking. "I must lie here, awake, staring with burning eyes into
the dark. Watching, waiting for God alone knows what. Tensed,
quivering, deathly afraid. Sensing dark evil closing in about me.
Closing in. Praying that when it strikes it will take me only,
and leave little Cora unscathed. God shield her. Dear God,
protect her. She is so tiny, so helpless, so sweet..."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">DAYLIGHT came&mdash;and with it the bustle of
getting Cora ready for school, of combing the blonde curls
twining so tightly about the child's scrubbed and shining face,
of running with her down the long, drab stairs and listening to
her bubbling prattle for the two long blocks to the schoolhouse
gate.</p>

<p>All this served to dispel Norma's fears. Even though a phone
call to the hospital had brought the response that Dan's
condition was unchanged&mdash;that he still was motionless in
living death&mdash;the sun was warm and comforting and there was
money in her purse, nine crisp dollar bills old Levi, the
pawnbroker, had given her for the blind man's gold. Nightmare was
almost forgotten in the unaccustomed joy of buying thick sweet
cream and a box of Cora's favorite marshmallow cookies, with
chocolate icing...</p>

<p>The shoe store window beckoned her. After school she would get
Cora a pair of sandals with sharkskin tips that couldn't be
easily scuffed. They were only two dollars. But she had better
hurry home now. Mr. Malwa's door had been closed when she left.
He must still have been asleep, but he would be up now; she would
have to sweep out the room, make the bed. Perhaps he would want
her to serve him his meals. She had better figure out how much to
charge him. He probably didn't eat much, he was so thin...</p>

<p>Wasn't that a police car in front of the house? A crowd was on
the stoop, peering in through the vestibule door. Norma's heart
skipped a beat. Had they brought Dan home...?</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Tony?"</p>

<p>The iceman turned to Norma, shrugged expressive shoulders. "I
dunno, Mis' Sawyer. Mist' Walen, da janitor, he runna out, calla
da cop. Say somet'in about somebod' deada."</p>

<p>"Dead! Oh! Let me through. Let me through, please. I live
here."</p>

<p>The hall resounded with the sound of clumping feet. Men were
clustered about an open door on the first-floor landing. "Dat's
all I knows about it, I tell you," sounded the janitor's voice.
She could see him, pallid-faced under black stubble, talking to a
grey-haired policeman. "I ain't seen neither o' dem for a week,
an' I thinks I better find out is anyt'ing wrong. So I uses me
pass-key&mdash;an dat's what I sees."</p>

<p>The knot shifted, and Norma could look past them, into a room
hung with heavy, silken folds of dark blue and floored with a
carpet of the same midnight hue. She saw a heap on the floor, its
whiteness marred by a brown and grisly splotch. A limp arm flung
out from that gruesome heap was dreadfully still, and the drawn
lips of a brown face&mdash;a visage of waxen death&mdash;was
bisected by a scar puckering the festering cheek, <i>like Cora's
vaccination mark!</i></p>

<p>Norma was cold all over, trembling. But the sight held her
spell-bound. She could not move, could not take the step she so
terribly wanted to that would carry her up and away from that
spectacle of gruesome death.</p>

<p>The hem of the corpse's robe just touched a silver platform on
which stood a great jeweled vase, and beyond that there was a
three-legged stand of iridescent mother-of-pearl. It seemed to
the staring woman as though the tripod were incomplete, as though
something should have rested atop it that was not there. There
seemed to be some obscure message for her in that circumstance,
some occult meaning. That was absurd! What possible connection
could there be between her and this&mdash;murder?</p>

<p>"Where's the other fellow, this servant? What did you say his
name was?"</p>

<p>"Ganda," Walen answered the officer's question. "How should I
know where he is? He went away a week ago, told me Toorah was
sending him somewhere."</p>

<p>A hard-faced man in a derby and a grey suit who had been
standing alongside the policeman intervened. "It's just one o'
those things, lieutenant. This Ganda had conked his boss, an'
beat it. What gets me is his leaving a couple hundred grand in
stones behind. This pot here is nothin'. You ought to see what's
in the back rooms, an' I'll swear none of it's been touched."</p>

<p>"Yeah, he did take somethin'," the janitor interjected,
stabbing a grimy thumb at the gleaming tripod. "There's a skull
belongs on that stand an' it ain't there no more."</p>

<p>"A skull! Hell! What would the killer want with a piece of
bone. It just got thrown out with the garbage."</p>

<p>"I wish it wuz in the garbage. I'd quit my job if it come down
the dummy. It had big jools in its eyes an' the place where its
nose ought to be. White jools with lights in 'em all green an'
gold an' red. I seen one like that in Levi's window
once&mdash;an' the tag on it said a hunnerd an' fifty bucks. That
one wasn't no bigger than the nail on my thumb, an' these was big
as&mdash;as a baby's fist."</p>

<p>"You're crazy. Opals that big would be worth a fortune..."</p>

<p>"They was there, though. I seen 'em. An' the skull talked when
anyone came in for a readin'. It talked like it was alive. Toorah
asked it questions, an' it answered him."</p>

<p>"Trick stuff," the police captain sneered. "Old stuff.
Telephone wires and a loudspeaker... Hey, Flaherty, clear the
hall. What's this, a public meetin'?"</p>

<p>A florid-faced patrolman jerked around.</p>

<p>"Move along, lady. Yuh can't stand there."</p>

<p>As Norma obediently started up the stairs she heard Walen's
flat, unemotional voice. "I dunno. All I know is the skull
talked, an' it had a name. Toorah called it the Head o'
Malwa."</p>

<p>A chill tremor prickled Norma's spine. <i>Malwa!...</i> It was
coincidence, the merest coincidence, that was all.</p>

<p>Then a black figure lurched at her from the embrasured gloom
of her own doorway. The packages spilled from her arms, and an
abortive scream fluttered in her throat. A hand closed on her
elbow, a brutal visage hung in the murk, and a gruff, hoarse
voice was sharp with menace.</p>

<p>"I been waitin' for you," it said. "I been waitin' for you a
long time."</p>

<p>The moment of frantic panic passed. This was someone she knew.
It was the man who lived across the hall.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what do you want?" she squeezed out of a throat
still tight with fright. "What...?"</p>

<p>"You got a sign down in Ginsberg's window. How much do you
want for th' room?"</p>

<p>"The room! But you live right here. What do you want to rent
another room for?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;uh&mdash;I got some folks come to stay for a couple
days. I gotta get me a place to sleep&mdash;an' when I sees your
sign I thinks, 'Geez, what luck! Right on me own floor.'"</p>

<p>Somehow the explanation did not ring true&mdash;but it didn't
matter, anyway. "I'm sorry, Mr. Lane; I can't let it to you."</p>

<p>"You can't...! What's the matter with me? I ain't got
smallpox, have I? Ain't my money good's anyone else's?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is&mdash;but the room is already taken.
It&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Taken!" His utterance was suddenly ugly, bullying. "That's a
lie. I been watchin', an' there ain't nobody been here all
mornin'."</p>

<p>"Not this morning. Last night. I rented it last night&mdash;to
a blind man."</p>

<p>"A blind&mdash;" His hold on her arm was suddenly gone, and he
staggered back as if from the impact of a blow. "Cripes!"</p>

<p>The fetid hallway seemed to pulsate again with inexplicable
menace. There was terror in Lane's eyes, curiously akin to the
terror she had glimpsed in Dan's. "What's the matter?" she
asked.</p>

<p>The man seemed to collect himself with a tremendous effort.
"Nuttin'," he husked. "Nuttin'. Only I pulled the scab off this
sore on my hand where a dog bit me. It hurt, kinda."</p>

<p>Norma bent to pick up her scattered parcels. Why was he so
anxious to rent the room? His excuse had been palpably false.</p>

<p>"Listen, Mrs. Sawyer," the man said, his apelike countenance
livid, his thick lips leaden, "I'd like to ask you somethin'. I'd
like to ask you, did Dan say anything that night? Did he tell you
to talk to me about anything?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand. Why should he have...?"</p>

<p>"I just thought&mdash;Aw hell, skip it."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" He slid past her. The door of his flat crashed
shut behind him.</p>

<p>What did it all mean...? In God's name, what did it mean?
Norma's furtive happiness of the morning had vanished. She felt
as though she were struggling against grey, impalpable filaments
that were enmeshing her in some inexplicable web of evil, as
though that which had mysteriously stricken Dan was watching her
with a beady, malevolent gaze...</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3">III. &mdash; THE MARK OF HUMAN
TEETH</a></h2>

<p class="first"> SUN streamed into Norma's kitchen from the
backyard that was the flat's only outlook, but somehow it had no
warmth, no cheeriness. A chill shook her, a trembling ague that
quivered in her very bones. Someone had been in here. Small
things told her that, tiny trifles only a meticulous housewife
would notice. The row of cereal canisters over the sink was
slightly askew. A few grains of cracked wheat were gritty on the
edge of the shelf, and cornflakes were the cereal she had given
Cora for breakfast. The garbage can cover was not on quite
tight.</p>

<p>Her glance drifted through the door of the back bedroom, where
she had swept, made the beds, while the child had been busied
with her morning functions. There was a barely perceptible dent
on the surface of her cot's pitiful spread, as though a hand had
lightly rested while its owner peered under the bed. Who had
intruded?... A sneak-thief?... Ludicrous? Only an imbecile would
expect to find anything of value in this poverty-stricken
household. Who then...?</p>

<p>Perhaps Mr. Malwa had heard the prowler. Norma recalled that
his door was still closed&mdash;but he might be awake... She went
to it, could hear no sound from the room&mdash;not even the deep
sigh of a sleeping man's breath.</p>

<p>She knocked. There was only deathly stillness behind the drab
panels. Fingers of dread closed on her heart. A thought filtered
into her throbbing brain, an appalling question.</p>

<p>Murder had entered this tenement once, not long ago. Had it
struck again? What was behind this silent door? Almost without
conscious volition her hand was on the knob, twisting it. The
room was open before her and it was empty! Malwa was not there,
and the bed had apparently not been slept in, and there was no
evidence that the room had been entered, since she had cleaned it
after Dan's still form had been taken to the hospital.</p>

<p>He must have gone out. The blind lodger must have waked,
dressed, made his bed, and gone out.</p>

<p><i>"I been watchin', an' there ain't nobody been here all
mornin'."</i> Lane seemed to be saying it again, thrusting his
stubbled face into hers.</p>

<p>Long, faint lines lay across the floor, marring the
spotlessness of the boards she had scrubbed. Norma stooped to see
them closer. They were dust lying along the crevices where the
wooden strips joined. Paint was chipped from a nail-head at her
feet, from another. Every nail in that floor had been drawn from
its hole and replaced. Malwa, or someone else, had lifted all the
boards, had reset them...</p>

<p>A shriek sliced through the cloaking silence. It was a thick,
burbling ululation of terror and unendurable pain. It
crescendoed, higher and higher, to become a shrill, mad voicing
of anguish. It came from outside the entrance door, and other
sounds underlay the somehow obscene scream&mdash;muffled thuds as
of a heavy body tumbling, step by step, down hard stairs.</p>

<p>Norma whirled, flung open the door. The shriek cut off, but
the thumping continued, pulled her wide-eyed glance to the stair-
flight from the top floor. A dark bundle pounded down the final
step, sprawled. It was the body of a man that arched, suddenly in
ultimate, awful agony, writhed, was still&mdash;dreadfully
still...</p>

<p>She was out beside it, was looking down at a face convulsed,
distorted out of all human semblance, its throat torn as if by
bestial fangs. From the gullet spurted a scarlet fountain, to
inundate a weazened, twisted frame. A hand lay motionless in a
gory pool.</p>

<p>There were marks on that hand, a semi-circle of deep
lacerations from each of which a single scarlet drop oozed and
dripped away. Norma stared at those marks, and her own blood was
a dark surge in her veins. They were the marks of teeth. They
were the marks of <i>human</i> teeth.</p>

<p>Behind her something made a rolling sound, like a great ball
revolving across the floor. Norma heard it through the daze that
cloaked her brain. It meant nothing to her then, but afterwards
she was to remember it&mdash;and wonder...</p>

<p>"Gripes almighty!" Somehow Lefty Lane was beside her, his
exclamation a guttural, shaken moan. "It's Hen. It's Hen Reddon."
He was down on his knees beside the slain man, tearing at the
corpse's waist. Did he think he could do anything for him? Did he
think he still lived?</p>

<p>The dead man's shirt gave way with a ripping hiss, and Lane
fumbled within it. He tugged at something, pulled off a belt of
khaki canvas studded with pockets. One of the pockets was
slashed, gaping open.</p>

<p>"Hell," Lane muttered. "It's gone. The fool wouldn't cache it
like I told him!" He flung the money-belt away from him. It
struck an upright of the banister, writhed, reptilian, dropped
out of sight. Lane came up from his haunches. His eyes were
glazed, a muscle twitched in his swarthy cheek.</p>

<p>Footsteps pounded far below, clumping footsteps of men running
up. Lefty seemed suddenly to realize Norma's presence. His hand
lashed out, his fingers dug fiercely into her shoulder. "I wasn't
here," he grunted. "If you spill what you seen I'll cut your
brat's throat."</p>

<p>He was soon out of sight, and behind the shut door of his
flat. In a second men were crowding around Norma, vague in a
swirling mist.</p>

<p>"God!" someone said, in a sick voice. "Look at that." It was
the derby-hatted detective, but his face wasn't hard any more.
Above his starched collar it sagged in horror, and his Adam's
apple slid up and down, as if he were swallowing something he
would have liked to spit out.</p>

<p>"Upstairs," Norma blurted. "He fell from there. His
wife..."</p>

<p>"Stay here, Flaherty, and watch it," the detective snapped.
There was a gun in his hand, and he was climbing the stairs.
Slowly, as if he would give his chance of promotion not to have
to, he went around the bend...</p>

<p>"What do you know about this?" Officer Flaherty was asking
her. "You was here pretty quick."</p>

<p>"I live in this flat," she pointed. "I heard him scream and I
came out."</p>

<p>"See anyone?"</p>

<p>Norma hesitated. Lane wasn't the killer. There hadn't been any
blood on his hands, <i>or about his mouth.</i> It was only his
ghoul's search of Reddon's money belt that had prompted his
terrible threat. He would kill Cora if she told about that.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;there was no one here," she answered. "No one could
have passed the body as it tumbled down, and I was out here
before it had stopped falling."</p>

<p>"The killer must still be up there then, unless he went over
the roof. If he's still there, Lusano will get him."</p>

<p>"He won't get him. He didn't go over the roof, but Mr. Lusano
won't get him." Now what made her say that? What inner voice was
it that made her so certain there would be no trace of the slayer
up there?</p>

<p>"Hey, lady. Come up here. Maybe you can do somethin'..."
Lusano was peering over the banister.</p>

<p>Norma went up the stairs.</p>

<p>There was a trail of blood on the steps. It went across the
landing, spattered the threshold of the Reddon flat just over
hers, was a grisly spurt on the wall of its inner hall. A low,
moaning babble came from the bedroom which opened into the little
passage.</p>

<p>"She was like that when I got here," said Lusano. "I can't get
anything out of her."</p>

<p>An obese woman clad in a blood-drenched, bedraggled apron sat
on the bed and swayed from side to side as she moaned. A dribble
of saliva drooled from one corner of her mouth, and her fat-
pouched eyes were glassy. Her face was a billowing lump of yellow
dough, animated only by a jelly-like quiver. A wave of revulsion
swept Norma, and then she was in the room.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Reddon," she said sharply. "Mrs. Reddon, what happened
here? What did you see?"</p>

<p>The woman swayed, moaned. Her glazed eyes stared right through
Norma, as though she still saw unutterable horrors.</p>

<p>"It's the damnedest set-up," Lusano muttered, behind her.
"I've searched the flat, gone up to the roof. The bolt on the
trapdoor is rusted into its socket; it ain't been opened for
years. The fire escape window in back is locked. The space that's
left ain't wide enough for anything bigger than a cat to get
through&mdash;an' no cat did that."</p>

<p>Norma scarcely heard him. Her teeth bit into her lip. There
was one way to bring this woman out of her hysteria&mdash;only
one way. Her hand flew back, flailed out. The spat of her palm
against the flabby cheek was like a pistol shot.</p>

<p>The woman screamed. She heaved to her feet, screamed again.
Words spewed from her, incredible words. "The head! The head of
death! Sainted Mary, defend us. It's the head of Satan
himself."</p>

<p>Lusano had hold of the gibbering woman. "Cut the yelling," he
growled, "and tell us what you saw."</p>

<p>"I am telling you. It was a head, only a head. There wasn't
any more. It was hangin' to Hen's neck, and Hen's blood was
spilling over it. He was fightin', battlin' it. But his fists
were plowin' thin air, 'cause there wasn't any belly there for
him to hit. There wasn't any legs or arms. There was just the
head bitin' him. I went to help him, and his blood spilled on me,
and then the devil's head dragged him out into the hall. He went
tumbling down the&mdash;" Intelligibility shrilled again into a
high and dreadful scream that went on and on.</p>

<p>"Loony," the detective grunted, struggling with the woman.
"Clean loony. She did it herself. She went batty and she ripped
the windpipe out of her old man."</p>

<p>A metallic click penetrated his words and black metal
encircled the screaming woman's wrists. Lusano wrapped his hand
about the clinking chain joining the manacles. "Get Flaherty," he
snapped. "Tell the cop to come up here. It'll take the two of us
to handle her."</p>

<p>Norma was glad to get out of the horror of that place, and
away from the stench of blood, her feet skidding in its slippery
viscidness. She heard Flaherty's hoarse objurgation, "Get back. I
don't care if you do live up there. You can't pass till the boss
says it's okay."</p>

<p>She delivered her message, reeled past a mass of white faces
floor-high in the stair-well, and got the door shut between her
and the gory form that lay out on the landing. But she could go
no further. She leaned back against the portal and fought
retching nausea.</p>

<p>After a while Norma felt a little better. The familiar length
of the corridor cleared somewhat. A flat beam of light, from the
window in the rented room, lay on the floor before her. Her eyes
found it, clung to it, as if that bit of sunlight filtering
through the gloom of a tenement airshaft represented sanity,
which seemed to have fled from within the gaunt, rain-streaked
walls through which it penetrated. Her mind began to function
again.</p>

<p>It's lucky, she thought, that Cora goes to the school
lunchroom for her midday meal. By the time she comes home they
will have taken Henry Reddon away&mdash;and Mr. Walen will have
washed up the landing. She won't see the..."</p>

<p>Thought failed in her throbbing brain. A blurred shadow had
suddenly jogged the lane of sunlight, there before her! She
focused her gaze on it. Outlines became firmer. It was the
silhouette of a head, of a bodiless head floating in empty
space!</p>

<p>Terror clutched the heart of the staring woman. A rasp in her
throat was a soundless scream. She was motionless, rigid in the
grip of a nightmare paralysis. She could see only that grisly,
terror-filled blotch on the floor, only... Good Lord! It wasn't a
head. It was a great bat, a tremendous, fluttering bat.</p>

<p>The wavering stopped. The shadow no longer was of something
eerie, appalling. It was only the shadow of a man&mdash;of Malwa,
her roomer. But Malwa hadn't been there before, and, if he had
gone out, Flaherty would not have let him return.</p>

<p>Norma found strength to take the three steps that would bring
her to that room door. She got to it, looked fearfully in. Mr.
Malwa was standing in front of the window. A black dressing gown
enveloped him, draped loosely from shoulders so straight and
sharp-edged that it seemed almost as if the robe were suspended
from a clothes hanger. Its sleeves were so long that they covered
his hands. His head was swathed in bandages, chin to scalp, but
there was a tiny opening where his left eye should be, and
through the aperture a red spark flickered, blinked out, showed
again.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Sawyer." His voice was intonationless as
it had been the night before. "You seem surprised to see me."</p>

<p>Norma moistened dry lips. "I&mdash;I thought you had gone
out."</p>

<p>"I was here by the window when you looked in. Perhaps this
closet door hid me from you, but I saw you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You what!"</p>

<p>"I saw you... Oh, pardon me! Of course, you could not know. I
have, Mrs. Sawyer, recovered my&mdash;the sight of my left
eye."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4">IV. &mdash; "YOU CANNOT KILL THE
DEAD!"</a></h2>

<p class="first"> "FOUR and what make ten?... Four and six make
ten." Norma Sawyer looked lacklusterly at her small daughter,
bent over a school-book across the kitchen table that was cleared
now of supper dishes.</p>

<p>"Five and what make ten?... Five and five make ten."</p>

<p>Light, spilling down from the single, shaded bulb, tangled in
the golden loveliness of Cora's hair, lost its harshness as it
bathed her downy cheek. The whispering, rapt undertone in which
the child conned her lesson was like a rough file rasping the
mother's raw nerves.</p>

<p>Dread anxiety throbbed a pulse of dull pain in Norma's
temples. Nothing more had happened after the events of the
terrible morning. Morbid excitement, surging through the drab
hallways of the tenement, through the sleazy street, had finally
subsided with the departure of the police and their prisoner, of
the morgue wagon with its grisly freight. Malwa had shut his room
door, had remained within, noiseless, non-existent, all the long
day. But the thought of his presence had been a pall of eerie
fear brooding over the small flat.</p>

<p>"Eight and what make ten?... Eight and two make ten." There
was a shadow in the corner behind Cora, like some black-coated,
noisome animal crouched, watching, waiting its chance. Norma's
hand went to her breast, pressed against the flutter of her
heart. It was nothing. It was cast by the unused gas jet of the
converted light fixture, and it had always been there.</p>

<p>"Ten and what make ten?... Ten and nothing make ten." Cora
closed her book with a bang. "Mother, it's early yet. May I play
jacks for a while?"</p>

<p>"You must have lost your jacks, dear. They weren't anywhere
around when I straightened up this morning."</p>

<p>A smile broke Cora's precocious solemnity. Her blue eyes
twinkled with a sly mischievousness. "I didn't lose them, 'If you
count to a hundred and close your eyes,'" she chanted, "'I'll
show you something to make you wise.'"</p>

<p>"All right." Curtaining lids eased the ache beneath them.
Small feet pattered, going away, and a childish chuckle came from
behind, from the bedroom.</p>

<p>"Don't peek, now. Please don't peek."</p>

<p>This was a game they had always played, she and Cora
and&mdash;Dan. It was a secret Cora had shared with her father, a
laughing conspiracy against Norma. Dan had contrived some
mysterious hiding place for the little one's small treasures, and
the two had defied her to find it. She had never been able to,
though she had tried...</p>

<p>"You can look now." Cora was back in the room, with the jacks
and a ball clutched in her chubby hand. The bits of metal
clattered on the table. "I'm going to get to tensies tonight
without a miss. Watch me!"</p>

<p>Beyond the thump of the ball on wood, there was a slither of
furtive sound. Nor-ma's breath caught in her throat. Her glance
darted to the unlighted passage from which it had seemed to come.
A tiny, lurid spark glowed in the blackness. Norma was out of her
chair, was peering fearfully into the gloom of the short hallway.
She had imagined the spark that was like a red-glowing, baleful
eye. She <i>must</i> have imagined it. There was no one in the
hall! Nothing...</p>

<p>Had a door closed down there, just as she got to the kitchen
exit? The door of Malwa's room?</p>

<p>"What's the matter, mother? What made you jump like that?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, honey. Nothing. I&mdash;I thought I heard a mouse;
that's all. I think you had better go to bed now&mdash;right
away."</p>

<p>"Oh mother, I haven't finished. I've only got to foursie."</p>

<p>"Please, dear." She would shut the bedroom door, lock it. "I
want you to." Lock it against&mdash;what? "I'll let you come into
my bed and snuggle up close." With her arms tight around the
warm, dear form no harm could touch Cora. What, in God's name,
was she afraid of?</p>

<p>"Goodie. And you'll sing me to sleep like you used to before
Daddy went away. You will mother, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes, I'll sing you to sleep."</p>

<p>"Sing 'Sweet and Low,' and maybe Daddy will come
again&mdash;like he did last night&mdash;to kiss me. Do you think
the brown man will let him come?"</p>

<p>Norma swallowed the lump in her throat. "Perhaps you will
dream about Daddy again. Perhaps he will come back to
you&mdash;in your dreams.</p>

<p>"'Low, low, breathe and blow, wind of the western sea...'"</p>

<p>Tennyson's poignant words sobbed into silence. The nostalgic,
infinitely mournful second stanza sang silently in Norma's brain.
"Sleep and rest... Father will come to thee soon, father will
come to his babe in the nest..." If only he could come. If only
some perfumed, wind-filling gossamer sails could bring Dan back
again, over a shimmering, moon-blessed sea, whole again to his
loved ones. But that could happen only in poems, and in
dreams...</p>

<p>Was Cora dreaming of him now? The soft whisper of her
breathing against her mother's breast told that she was wrapped
in sleep. It welled up in Norma's own brain, tugged at her heavy
lids. She must not sleep; she dared not. She must keep awake,
watching, listening...</p>

<p>The room was luminous with a hazy, blue glow. Norma could see
the outline of the door she had locked, her dresser against the
wall next to it, Cora's doll carriage&mdash;but they were
wavering, unreal. It seemed to her as though a light, feathery
touch on her shoulder had awakened her, as though the instant
before she had opened her eyes someone had been there, right
there beside her bed. It seemed as though, at that very instant,
the air had ceased vibrating from the echoes of someone's voice,
someone who had been calling to her...</p>

<p>"Norma!"</p>

<p>It came from a great, an infinite, distance&mdash;worlds away.
It was a mere breath of sound&mdash;a sensation, a thought within
her, as airy, as phantasmal as the blue light pulsing about
her.</p>

<p><i>"Norma!"</i></p>

<p>The light was deeper, denser, obscuring the room and
everything within it. The room was gone and she was suspended in
some chill sector of outer space, formless, limitless, utterly
unsubstantial.</p>

<p><i>"Norma! Norma!"</i></p>

<p>It was Dan's voice, calling to her, calling... Dan's voice,
close by, its timbre familiar to her as her own! "Norma.
<i>Norma,</i> can you hear me?"</p>

<p>"Dan darling, I hear you," she gasped. "I&mdash;hear you."</p>

<p>"Norma! Listen. I have only a moment. Give it to him. Let him
have it. It's in the... Oh God, don't! Let me tell her. Let
me..."</p>

<p>The voice had been suddenly muffled, had burst out again,
broken, shrill with tortured protest. Somewhere in the blueness
Norma saw him, saw Dan, his face twisted, contorted by such agony
as only a soul in hell could suffer. A black swirl in the
cerulean haze was a malevolent, satanic visage, a purple scar
bisecting its upper lip and angling away. Dan seemed to be
struggling with the other. For an instant he broke away.</p>

<p>"Norma," he screamed. "Cora knows where..."</p>

<p>An impenetrable blackness descended upon her as she seemed to
be catapulting downward, hurtling headlong into an abyss that
yawned, a vast nothingness, to receive her. Then Norma Sawyer was
dreadfully awake, gelid fingers clenched tight about her heart.
She was awake, and now she knew out of what dream she had
plummeted, the night before, to eerie, fear-shot
consciousness.</p>

<p>Her slender frame was bathed in the cold sweat of terror. But
no dull thud against the outer door came to explain her
awakening. There was no sound at all except Cora's soft
breathing, beside her. The blackness lay ponderous, inscrutable,
in the small room. It crouched against the locked door, a vast
monster...</p>

<p>It wasn't the darkness that pressed close against the door!
The darkness wore no clothes to rasp, with a hiss just over the
threshold of audibility, against the panel's wood. The darkness
had no hand to close on the knob of that door and turn it,
slowly, slowly, so that the grate of metal against metal was
perceptible only because her senses, her hearing, were tensed to
supernormal acuteness.</p>

<p>Norma could not move, could not cry out. She lay stony as some
effigy on a medieval tomb, voiceless as the moldering skeleton
within it. Only her brain was alive; only the quivering, freezing
fear within it.</p>

<p>The knob clicked at the limit of its arc, slid almost
soundlessly back. The intruder had discovered that the door was
locked. Was he baffled? Would he go away?</p>

<p>The thump of heavier metal against the jamb answered her, tiny
crackles as some sharp edge pressed in between door-edge and
jamb. Norma heard the louder but still muted protest of riven
fibers and the sharp snap of the bolt forced from its socket.
<i>The door swung open.</i></p>

<p>Its black rectangle was blotched by a blacker form, by an ape-
shouldered, simian figure. The intruder poised motionless for an
eternal moment, taut, tensed to determine if the cautious sounds
of his entry had awakened the sleepers within. If she were quiet,
if he thought her asleep, perhaps he would take what he wanted
and go. Perhaps he would go, leaving her unharmed. And
Cora...?</p>

<p>He moved. He was coming in. What was he after? What could he
want in this destitute room? There was nothing here except the
rickety furniture, a few toys. Nothing of any value...</p>

<p>The intruder whirled. He peered out into the kitchen, out into
the lightless gloom from which he had entered. He crouched, and
indrawn breath gusted in his throat.</p>

<p>Norma followed the direction of his gaze. A spark dotted the
stygian murk, a single red spark just at the height of a tall
man's head. A frigid quiver ran through her...</p>

<p>"Who's there?" the prowler gasped into the blackness. "Who's
there?" His ejaculation was a husked susurration a-thrill with
terror. "Who is it?"</p>

<p>The lurid spark drifted closer, swooping with increasing speed
on the man's black bulk. Norma's breath stopped in her nostrils,
a steel band seemed to clamp across her chest, constrict.
Suddenly she saw a fluttering form beneath the red ember that was
a Cyclopean eye in a pallid, spectral countenance.</p>

<p>"Keep back," the prowler squealed. "Keep back!" His arm jerked
up. A vagrant light ray glinted on steel of a short, thick bar it
held. The rod lashed down, crashed down on the swooping, terrible
menace. Crashed <i>through</i> it.</p>

<p>A mocking laugh rustled, and the apparition was upon the
other. The room was hideous with snarling, vicious combat; with
grunts and squeals that were bestial in their ferocity.</p>

<p>"They'll wake Cora," Norma thought, agonized. "They'll wake
Cora, and she will be crazed with fright." But the child was
motionless, soft-breathing, by her side. From infancy she had
been trained not to be disturbed when asleep. Their poverty had
demanded that, the necessity for entertainment, for amusement in
cramped quarters. Norma thanked God for it now.</p>

<p>"Got you," a hoarse voice grunted. "Got you!" A squat, ape-
like figure lurched backward through the doorway. It was Lane. It
was Lefty Lane, from across the hall. A fluttering, black shape
hung flaccid from his great hands...</p>

<p>Malwa's sibilant, inhuman laugh was a hissing taunt in the
ambient gloom. God! Oh God! Lane gripped the conquered body of
the roomer who had come to her rescue, but Malwa wasn't there.
His bandaged, spectral visage was a pale oval hanging bodiless
and appalling in the darkness.</p>

<p>"You cannot kill the dead!" ghastly accents rustled from that
horror. "You cannot kill the servant of Siva. <i>But you must
obey him!</i> Robert Lane, where have you hidden that which is
mine?"</p>

<p>That which he held dropped from Lane's nerveless clutch. Lane
swayed, his breath a voiceless wheeze.</p>

<p>"Where have you hidden it?"</p>

<p>Lane did not answer. But there was animal courage, defiance,
in his pose.</p>

<p>"You will not tell? Come then. Come to the fate which has been
prepared for you."</p>

<p>Cora stirred, rolling over against her mother, whimpering
sleepily. The touch of the little body freed Norma from the
paralysis that gripped her. She was out of the bed, she was
hurling herself at the open door. Cora was awakening. She must
not hear, must not see...</p>

<p>Now the door was shut between Norma and the sight of horror.
But it could not shut out the muffled sounds that came through
the panel. Of stertorous breathing, clumping, labored footfalls
ending in an unwilling shuffle, as if he whose heavy-soled shoes
made them were being forced, step by fearful step, back from the
kitchen into the passageway, down the short hall.</p>

<p>A door thudded into its jamb, cutting off the sounds. Silence
fell once more against Norma's straining ears...</p>

<p>Then the silence was gone, and night pulsated with a
vociferation that was neither scream nor shriek but a
crescendoing ululation, a rounded, hollow yowl, as of a pain-torn
animal baying his infinite torment out of some abysmal pit of
hell...</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5">V. &mdash; HELL'S SYPHON</a></h2>

<p class="first">"MOTHER! Mother...!"</p>

<p>Cora's frightened cry was more poignant, more terrible to the
mother than the awful howl welling about her. It dragged her
around to the dim bed, compelled speech from her of which an
instant before she would have been utterly incapable.</p>

<p>"It's nothing to be scared of, honey. It's&mdash;it's only a
dog&mdash;a hurt dog..."</p>

<p>"He must be awfully hurt, Mums. Listen to him. Go help him
mother. Go help him."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" The terrible outcry plucked at her nerves, and
then it had ended in a low, sobbing moan.</p>

<p>"You must go and help him. Daddy always says one must help
those who are hurt, even a dog."</p>

<p>Even a dog! But a thief, a skulker in the dark, caught red-
handed violating the sanctuary of a home?</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> going to help him, Mother?"</p>

<p>The faith of a little child! No fear, no shuddering terror of
what might be out there in the terrible dark could justify its
betrayal. "Yes. Yes, dear heart. I am going to help him."</p>

<p>The terrible dark waiting in the kitchen where that weird
struggle had been waged, swallowing one, clammy and cold; in a
hall whose black tunnel funneled a low moan of intense, unearthly
suffering. The eerie, menacing dark through which one groped,
quivering, till dank wood met one's hand and the piteous sound
was just the other side of a door one must open.</p>

<p>The window was a yellow rectangle, lighted by the reflection
of some belated lamp in the air shaft. It was a luminous frame
for a bloated, horrible shadow blotching the pale
radiance&mdash;a shadow that swayed slightly, swinging slowly, in
time to the tortured, recurrent moan that came from it. Norma's
arm moved up. Her fingers jerked a switch-cord. The thing was a
shadow no longer...</p>

<p>It was the body of a man suspended by a rope harness that
passed under his armpits and rose tautly to a spike driven deep
into the top of the window sash! It was the naked body of Lefty
Lane, unnaturally bloated, meshed by a blue pattern of swollen
veins corrugating its bleached and bloodless skin. Eyes bulged
from their retracted lids, eyes that were without pupils, without
gloss&mdash;that were like the sightless orbs of a boiled fish.
Yellow, rotted teeth grimaced from between pulled-back, colorless
lips. A hairy chest heaved, and twitching belly muscles heaved to
drive out each retching, racked moan.</p>

<p>"Don't," Norma sobbed, sheer lunacy gibbering within her
skull. "Oh, don't!"</p>

<p>A thin, reptilian something issued from beneath the skin of
one wrist lying lax against a quivering thigh, arced away and
upward to a faucetted can high on a side wall. It was a tube,
hard, almost rigid with the liquid in it syphoning down from the
tin container.</p>

<p>A scene flashed across Norma's memory, a hospital ward she had
visited once, where just such a can hung high from a crane over a
sufferer's bed, just such a tube snaking down to a hollow needle
thrust into a wrist's artery. But the flow in that tube had been
regulated so that, drop by careful drop, a life-giving solution
might seep into the patient's drained veins. Here there was no
valve to stop this awful flow. The full pressure of a six foot
drop was forcing some fluid into Lane's body, was swelling his
veins, his arteries, to bursting.</p>

<p>Norma lurched across the intervening space, tore the tube out
of Lane's pierced skin. A pinkish jet spurted from the opened
wrist, sprayed over her. The suspended body writhed. The network
of swollen veins collapsed.</p>

<p>She had her arms around the moribund man's knees, was fighting
with her small strength to lift his weight from the cutting,
cruel harness. She felt his legs batter with convulsive force
against her breast. A hoarse voice came down to her:</p>

<p>"Oh God! Oh God! It ain't no use. I'm done for. He's done for
me, and I had to tell him where mine was hidden." Agonized words
breathed in defiance of impending death. "He's got Hen's now and
he's got mine. There's only Dan's left. I came to look for it,
an' he caught me. Give it to him. Let him have it before...
before... Oh, dear God... take me!"</p>

<p>She was holding dead weight, the weight of a dead man.</p>

<p><i>"Give it to him. Let him have it!"</i> Those were Dan's
words, Dan's, in the dream she had had. But <i>was it a
dream?</i> Thoughts flung up out of the whirling chaos of Norma's
brain. <i>"I am Malwa the Seeker."</i> Malwa had killed Hen
Reddon for some object he sought, had tortured Lane for another.
<i>"I</i> <i>have recovered my sight."</i> But there was still
another&mdash;and Dan had had it. It was somewhere here
now&mdash;somewhere. He would torture her too to find it. But she
did not know what it was. She did not know where it was... Then
she remembered that Dan had said: <i>"Cora knows!"</i> Cora knows
what Malwa seeks, and Malwa knows she knows. <i>He is back there
now!"</i></p>

<p>"Cora!"</p>

<p>The child's name ripped from Norma's lips as she loosed the
lifeless legs of Malwa's victim, as she whirled around. She threw
herself across the room&mdash;crashed against the door.</p>

<p>It was closed. She hadn't closed it after her! She clawed for
its knob. It wouldn't open. It was locked! He had locked it! He
had locked her in here while he went to work his will on
Cora!</p>

<p>Something made a hollow, rolling sound along the hall floor,
going back to the kitchen, to the bedroom. Just such a sound as
she had heard behind her while she stared at Reddon's gory
corpse.</p>

<p>Norma flung herself against the unyielding barrier, beating
battered, bleeding fists against it, scratching at the wood as
one possessed, ripping her nails from her finger tips. Great sobs
wrenched out of her breast, tore her throat.</p>

<p><i>"Mother! Mommy!"</i></p>

<p>Through the door, through her own wailing, Norma heard Cora's
far-off scream. <i>"Mother!"</i> It sliced through her madness,
silenced her, brought sanity to her for a fleeting second which
was long enough for her to realize that under her foot something
rolled and clattered. It was a steel bar; flattened at the
end&mdash;the jimmy with which Lane had forced the bedroom
door.</p>

<p>She snatched it up, struggled against frenzied clumsiness,
against tearing haste to jab the chisel-like end of the thing
into the crack between door-edge and jamb, to thrust with precise
leverage at the other end of the burglar's tool.</p>

<p>Wood screeched, breaking away. Norma was out in the hall
again. She whirled to the left. The kitchen, dark no longer, was
aglow with a fitful blue light&mdash;the cerulean luminosity out
of which Dan had spoken to her. The radiant haze waxed and waned,
and it seemed to be alive with shadowy wraiths not quite
visible.</p>

<p>Norma plunged into movement again, catapulting down the
hallway toward the eerie flicker. She was in it; it was all
around her. She thumped against the table, whirled around it.</p>

<p>Something caught her flying feet, tripped her. She fell for
aeons through the blue light, fell down on hard boards. She
tugged frantically at the robe Lane had dropped there, that had
tangled with her and brought her down. Got it free and pushed
frantic palms down on the boards to shove herself up again.</p>

<p>She froze with startled amazement. The bedroom doorway was
before her&mdash;and Malwa was on the very threshold, gaunt, and
stark, and appalling in his fluttering garment, his bandage-
swathed head. But he was halted there. He was stark-still in the
doorway, and his attitude&mdash;every line of his black-robed,
emaciated figure&mdash;was taut, not with menace, but with...
Could it be fear?</p>

<p>Norma's amazed stare went past him. Someone was there beyond
Malwa. Someone&mdash;Good God!... <i>It was Dan!</i></p>

<p>Straight and tall and terrible, Dan stood there with one arm
straight out from its shoulder, its hand up-bent, its forbidding
palm barring Malwa's advance. There was no agony in his face,
only a blaze of terrible wrath, of awesome majesty.</p>

<p>And behind him&mdash;Cora. Tiny, cherubic in her white
nightgown, the little tot was standing in the middle of the
floor, her tiny arms up thrown as if to defend herself. Her
blonde curls were rumpled, clustering about her small, startled
face. She was looking&mdash;not at her father&mdash;but at Malwa.
She was looking <i>through</i> Dan, as if he were not there.</p>

<p>"Mother," she whimpered. "Oh, Mother."</p>

<p>"Yes dear." From the very depths of hell, from the footstool
of God's throne, the mother heart would answer that call. "Yes,
dear. Mother's here."</p>

<p>"What does the man want, Mother? Why does he stand there like
that? What does he want?"</p>

<p>"Tell her to give it to him," Dan said. "Tell her it's in the
hiding place I made for her."</p>

<p>His lips had not moved. He had not spoken. It was with some
inner hearing that she had heard him, with some ear of the soul.
"Cora, dear," she whispered. "Don't be frightened. There isn't
anything at which to be frightened. But there is <i>something</i>
in the place you put your jacks and other things, that belongs to
the man. You must get it for him and give it to him; and then he
will go away."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know. The pretty stone daddy told me to hide when you
went to get the doctor for him. I promised I would tell nobody
about it, not even you."</p>

<p>There was a perceptible relaxation in Malwa's tenseness, an
evident slackening of the silent, motionless struggle that in
some weird fashion had existed till now in that blue-lit
doorway.</p>

<p>"That's it honey; that's what you must give him," Norma
encouraged.</p>

<p>"All right, mother." The child padded to her crib. Her small
hands twisted at one of the posts. It turned in response to her
purposeful tugging, was unscrewing. It came away...</p>

<p>Small objects spilled out of a hollow within it. Jacks rattled
on the floor, miniature doll's roller skates, a broken fountain
pen. Then flashing iridescent beauty rolled across the boards. It
was an opal as large as a pigeon's egg, shimmering with secret
fires, purple and saffron and golden and scarlet as sin
itself.</p>

<p>Malwa bent, straightened. His hand came away from his head
and, as he turned, Norma saw that two fiery eyes glowed now
beneath his forehead. He went past her. He must have gone past
her, but she did not see him. She felt only a cold draught
whisper over her.</p>

<p>"Dan!"</p>

<p>Tortured longing ripped the name from her, but Dan, too, was
gone. Dan was gone! She knew what that meant. He was dead. His
soul had gone from his body, and for a moment it had been
permitted to come here, to save his loved ones from evil. Now it
was indeed gone forever. Dan was&mdash;dead...</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother, I was frightened when I saw him coming in. I was
so frightened. 'I want my eye,' he said. 'Where have you hidden
my eye?' And then all of a sudden he stopped and he didn't say
anything. And then you were running into the kitchen&mdash;and
you fell..."</p>

<p>"Don't think about it, dear. Everything is all right now.
Everything. Come back to bed. Come back to bed and I will sing
you to sleep again."</p>

<p>But someone was knocking at the door, once more. Someone from
the hospital, of course, to tell her Dan was dead. They couldn't
know that she knew it already... It was Mr. Ginsberg, the
druggist.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sawyer. They just called up from St. Mary's..."</p>

<p>"I know. Dan is gone."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;he woke up just now. He is going to get better. They
don't know what happened, but he is normal again, weak, feeble,
but going to get well."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">A BLUE-HUNG, blue-floored room was silent behind
a door sealed by the police. The luminous blue light filling it
from some invisible source lay heavily on a kneeling figure bowed
in voiceless adoration before a jeweled censer, before an
iridescent tripod carved from mother-of-pearl on which rested a
grinning skull. From within its cavernous eye-sockets, from its
triangular nasal orifice, the milky, secret fires of three opals
glowed.</p>

<p>Finally the reverent Hindu rose. From the folds of his robe he
brought forth a bag of azure silk. In a moment the skull was
hidden in the bag.</p>

<p>Ganda was a flitting shadow descending the rusted, swaying
fire escape into the tenement backyard. Then he had merged with
the night, with the limitless night whose dark mantle covers
secrets that are not dreamed of in the philosophy of the
omniscient West.</p>

<p>But from high up in the drab face of the rickety tenement a
mother's voice crooned:</p><br>

<p class="verse">Sleep and rest, sleep and rest,<br>
Father will come to thee soon...<br>
Rest, rest, on mother's breast,<br>
Father will come to thee soon...</p>  <hr>
