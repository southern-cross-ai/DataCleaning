<h2><a id="ch1">I. &mdash; DELEGATION FROM THE TOMB</a></h2>

<p class="first"> LINDA LORAY tried not to show her
disappointment and growing uneasiness as she asked the hotel
clerk whether he knew Holt Carst&mdash;the man she had come to
Torburg to wed.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, eyes narrowing in his young but strangely
grey-hued, brooding countenance. "Everybody in Torburg knows Holt
Carst." His glance flickered over Linda's face with a curious
intentness, dropped to the brass-framed card, flat on the
counter, that bore the words:</p>

<p class="sign">ON DUTY: Dan Thilton</p> <br>

<p>"Mr. Carst wired me to come by the late train," Linda
explained, "but he wasn't at the station and there was no message
for me." She was poignantly conscious of the dusty hush of the
lobby, of its somehow desolate emptiness. "How can I reach
him?"</p>

<p>"Hard to say." The girl had a queer impression that Thilton
was holding something back deliberately, perhaps maliciously.
"There are no more trains till morning. Best thing for you is
take a room here and wait for Carst to get in touch with
<i>you</i>." He shoved the register at her; thrust a pen into her
hesitant fingers.</p>

<p>The ancient, musty inn was vaguely repulsive to her, but there
was nothing else for her to do but sign: Linda Loray, Boston.</p>

<p>Thilton turned and took a key from a rack whose hooks were
completely filled. He came out from behind the counter, moving
slowly, not from weariness but as though trammeled by some odd
reluctance. His tall frame was a little stooped, a little awkward
with the earthbound clumsiness peculiar to men born in the
hills.</p>

<p>"This way," he murmured, picking up Linda's bag and motioning
across rutted floor tiles toward a staircase at the other end of
the dim foyer. Linda reached the worn steps, started to mount
them. "Lije," Thilton called, behind her. "Oh, Lije!"</p>

<p>A big door slid open in the lobby wall at right angles to the
staircase, and the cloying, sick-sweet odor of funeral flowers
was all about the girl. She turned, startled, and looked through
the doorway.</p>

<p>The flowers were piled around a makeshift bier in what must be
the dining room of the old hotel. They formed a bank of blood-red
roses, of lilies wax-white as death itself, and on that bank a
dull ebony coffin rested. Two huge candles were burning on either
side of it.</p>

<p>There was no lid to the coffin, so that from her slight
eminence Linda looked right down into it. She saw a black frock
coat clothing a man's body&mdash;a coat unnaturally stiff as are
only the garments of the dead.</p>

<p>The dead man's hands were decorously folded on the rigid
chest, but even lifeless they were pallid, rapacious claws; their
bony fingers half-curled as if still eager to tear some helpless,
quivering flesh.</p>

<p>The head was completely bald. The face was lashless, wax-white
as the lilies. It resembled the visage of an albino vulture.
Beneath the closed, blue eyelids the skin sagged in the pendulous
dark pouches of dissipation, and the way the livid lips were
thinly puckered branded those moribund features with lascivious
cruelty.</p>

<p>"I'm going upstairs, Lije," Thilton said, "to show this lady
to her room. Watch things, will you?"</p>

<p>"Sure," a toneless, heavy voice responded. "Sure, Dan."</p>

<p>Linda looked at the man who had opened the door from within.
The watcher of the dead was as tall as Thilton, as spare-framed
and gangling, but much older. His hair was iron-grey, his cheeks
deeply seamed, weather-beaten. And in his hands there was&mdash;a
shotgun! Its black barrel slanted across his torso and one
calloused forefinger rested on the trigger. Watcher of the dead
indeed! The man called Lije was a <i>guard</i> of the dead. An
<i>armed</i> guard!</p>

<p>Against what impossible menace was he armed? Against what
ghouls who would violate a coffined corpse?</p>

<p>Thilton, in motion again, forced Linda to recommence her
climb, lest he collide with her. He unlocked the door of a room
at the head of the stairs, shifted the key to the inside, put her
bag down and departed without a word.</p>

<p>Despite the questions hammering within Linda's skull,
questions she oddly dared not voice. Despite her perturbation
over Holt Carst's failure to meet her, the exhaustion of her long
journey welled up drug-like in her, numbed her. She was already
half-asleep as she undressed, and when she crept into the
creaking bed, it was as though she crept into immediate, tangible
oblivion...</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THOUGH she had slept long enough to warm the
harsh cotton sheets, Linda Loray's slim body seemed molded within
ice when she awoke&mdash;as frigid and as utterly incapable of
motion! Fear, naked and terrible, was a presence in the room, a
livid crawl in her veins.</p>

<p>The sound that had startled her to the quick came
again&mdash;a thin cry shrilling out of the night. This time the
incredible words were clear and terrifying.</p>

<p><i>"They're coming! The dead are coming!"</i></p>

<p>Running footfalls thudded toward the hotel. "The
dead&mdash;they're alive again!" The shout was right under
Linda's window, and the pound of frightened feet was first dull
on the hard-dirt path from Torburg's single street, then hollow
on the inn's porch planks. "They're com&mdash;" A door slammed,
cutting off the cry.</p>

<p>"Lije!" a muffled voice shouted from below. Now the sounds of
trampling feet were within the house, the sounds of voices husky
with apprehension but too low for Linda to distinguish the
words...</p>

<p>She was dreaming, she tried to tell herself, and then her
fear-frozen brain was demanding, can one dream noises alone,
seeing nothing, feeling nothing except the pressure of one's lids
against aching eyeballs, the pressure of lids one fights un-availingly to open?</p>

<p>It <i>must</i> be a dream. In no waking moment did one hear a
voice crying that the dead were alive. Only in a nightmare did
one's muscles refuse the bidding of a brain squeezed between the
jaws of terror's dreadful vise. Only in a nightmare were one's
nostrils so stuffed with the odor of funeral flowers that one
could hardly breathe.</p>

<p>Of course! The smell of the flowers from that improvised
morgue below, seeping up through the moldering walls and warped
floors of the crumbling structure, had inspired a dream of
horror. If she could only get her eyes open, if she could only
come fully awake...</p>

<p>It was no dream! Linda was staring at the cold, hueless glow
of moonlight that crept into the musty chamber. She was awake
now, without possibility of question, and she still heard those
ominous sounds.</p>

<p>Hushed voices quivered with some dreadful urgency. Something
scraped ponderously, as though a heavy piece of furniture was
being moved across the lobby floor to barricade the entrance.</p>

<p>On the faded quilt that weighed Linda down, the lunar
luminance lay, shaped in a sharp-edged rectangle by the frame of
the window through which it seeped. The oblong was deeply notched
by a triangular black shadow. The girl focused her attention on
that strange silhouette, trying by pondering the puzzle its odd
shape presented to take her mind from the more fearful puzzle of
the weird warning she had overheard, of the threat against which
the preparations below were being made.</p>

<p>The sky had been dark when she had toiled up the deserted
street from the railroad station. The moon must be now just
rising. It was the shadow of a building, then, that lay on the
coverlet. Linda recalled seeing a church, across the wide Main
Street from the inn. Inevitable landmark of a New England
village, its steeple had pointed a slender finger to the heavens.
The moon was behind it now and this somber triangle was the
shadow of the steeple's tip.</p>

<p>There had been an iron-fenced graveyard beside the
church...</p>

<p><i>Thud!</i> That dull sound was outside the inn. It was the
thump of stone on soft earth. <i>Thud!</i> Ridiculous to
think&mdash;that they were made by tombstones falling, one by
one, on the soft loam of the graves they marked, that the sounds
came from the graveyard...</p>

<p>Rusty hinges screamed protest against being disturbed! There
had been an iron gate in that iron fence. It was opening! Who,
<i>what</i>, was opening it?</p>

<p>Casting the quilt and sheets off her body, Linda sat there for
a moment in a daze. Then suddenly her bare feet struck the floor,
and she came erect.</p>

<p>The sheer silk of her nightgown was no armor against the sharp
chill of the upland night. Gooseflesh prickled her nubile
breasts. Muscles tautened across her flat abdomen, shrinking from
the frigid sting. The cold struck through to the very marrow of
her bones, but the girl did not hesitate. The imperative need to
know what was going on was impelling her to the open window
through which the moonlight&mdash;and the scrape of dragging feet
on flagstones&mdash;came.</p>

<p>She reached it, peered through it. The tiny burial place was
plain in a pale weird light that lay on it like a transparent
shroud.</p>

<p>Linda saw the black oblong of an open grave. It was for the
dead man, of course, who was laid out in the dining room below.
But there was another, and another; and on the grass behind them
their headstones lay, askew as if just now they'd toppled to the
ground.</p>

<p>The earth from those empty graves was not neatly piled but had
erupted from the black holes, as though it had been thrust up
from beneath.</p>

<p>The shadow of the church was black along the front of the
graveyard, along the tall fence that a century ago had been
wrought by patient sledges to wall the graveyard in, so that
Linda's staring gaze could not make out what it was that moved
there. But <i>something</i> moved there, many things, in fact,
and from within the shadow came the faint scrapings that had
seemed to her the sound of bony feet on the flagstones that paved
the churchyard paths...</p>

<p>Whatever was there moved toward the curb, moved across the
curb and out into the street. The darkness not so intense there,
Linda made out the form of a man; other forms followed him. The
leader came nearer still, came into a patch of pale
moonlight.</p>

<p>A scream formed in Linda Loray's throat, was held there by the
swelling of her larynx that cut off all her breath but a wheezing
gasp.</p>

<p>Moldering garments fluttered about that scrawny shape, and
through the rents in them grey-whiteness flashed that could be
only skeleton ribs. Its head was grotesquely askew on twisted
shoulders, and its face...</p>

<p>It had no face!</p>

<p>It had only a serrated, grinning gap where its mouth ought to
be, two great stygian pits for eyes. That macabre countenance was
earth-smeared, and something flapped against a grey-white cheek-hollow, like an ear that had rotted loose.</p>

<p>An ear that flapped with the grisly, limping gait of the thing
as it crept along. The <i>thing</i> passed into shadow again. But
the shape that followed it was no less gruesome, nor was the one
that followed next...</p>

<p>They went across that patch of revealing luminance, and
darkness hid them from Linda once more. But the shadow could not
shut from her ears the scrape, scrape which told her that the
spectral procession paraded straight up the path to the inn, that
it mounted the steps to the hotel porch.</p>

<p>It could not keep her from hearing the rat-a-tat of bony
knuckles on the door below her window, and the sepulchral voice
that boomed a summons.</p>

<p>"Open!" it called. "Open for the <i>League of
Lazarus</i>."</p>


<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch2">II. &mdash; THE DEAD ATTACK</a></h2>

<p class="first"> LINDA LORAY'S trembling fingers bit into the
window sill. It wasn't&mdash;it <i>couldn't</i> be true. She had
not seen living corpses marching from their violated graves. They
were not clustered beneath her, hidden from her by the porch
roof, demanding admittance to the very house that sheltered
her.</p>

<p>Such things could not happen. Yet&mdash;</p>

<p>"Open!" the dead leader of the dead boomed once more. "We have
come for our brother and his bride."</p>

<p>His bride! The bride of the dead? There had been only one
coffin down there. There had been no keys missing from the rack
in the lobby&mdash;no other room was occupied...</p>

<p>It could not be <i>she</i> whom they meant. How could it? In
the morning she would be a bride, but not of a dead man. Of Holt
Carst, who was vibrantly, heart-stirringly alive.</p>

<p>"Not this time," a voice shouted. "We ain't going to let you
in." It wasn't Dan Thilton's voice. "This Lazarus business is
going to stop right now." It was the voice of Lije, the man who
had watched a corpse with a shotgun in his hands. "Henry Fulton's
going to be buried proper, and he's going to stay buried."</p>

<p>Where was Holt? Why had he not met her at the station? What
business could he have so important as to keep him from her?
Saying goodbye he had murmured, "It's only for a few weeks,
sweetheart, but it's going to seem like years. I dread the
thought of our being separated."</p>

<p>Linda had smiled through her tears. "You don't really mean
that, Holt. You've only known me for a month, surely you couldn't
have gotten as used to having me around as all that."</p>

<p>"I've known you forever, Linda&mdash;in my dreams." She felt
that way about him, too. She seemed always to have known his
lithe, straight figure, his dark eyes that could be so gay, that
could glow with such tenderness. "Known, and loved you forever."
From the first time she had met him; his every little gesture had
been utterly familiar, as when he tossed his head to fling back
his shock of ebon hair from his high, white brow. "I'll send for
you as soon as I can."</p>

<p>Then the trainman had called, "All aboard! All ab-o-oard!" And
Holt's arms had crushed her to him, his lips hot on hers.</p>

<p>"Take me with you," Linda had gasped against his lips. "Now."
But he had thrust her from him and sprinted through the train
gate...</p>

<p>The great city had been lonelier than ever, after that, for
the orphaned girl. She had had no friends, few acquaintances,
before Holt Carst had come into her life. She had been content
with her job and her books. But there had been no contentment in
the time of waiting after he had returned to Torburg. It had been
almost agony, relieved only by the thought that it would soon be
over...</p>

<p>Now, there was a tentative rattle of the door latch below, and
then an ominous moment of silence.</p>

<p>It was ended by a piercing whistle. Then another whistle
answered it.</p>

<p>Central in the graveyard, a moss-stained family tomb glimmered
palely in the moonlight. Peering to make out whence that second
whistle had come, Linda saw the great bronze door of that tomb
swing open; saw one, two, a half-dozen more of the spectral
figures issue from it. They clustered about a shaft standing just
within the graveyard gate, a "broken pillar" of archaic funeral
design.</p>

<p>The grisly shadows gathered about that symbol of grief. They
swayed, and the pillar swayed with it. It toppled, fell!</p>

<p>The shadows lifted the monument from where it had fallen,
shuffled off with it. They shuffled out through the gate. They
were carrying the cylindrical gravestone horizontally between
them and the way they carried it made their purpose plain.</p>

<p>The stone that had been intended to stand forever as a
memorial to someone's loved one&mdash;was to be a battering
ram!</p>

<p>She must warn those below! Linda shoved herself away from the
window, got moving across the room. The dimness was like some
invisible, viscous flood, clinging to her limbs, clogging her
progress. It required infinite effort to get her to the door, but
she reached it at last, fumbled at the key till it clicked over.
She reached the outer hall, leaned over the rail at the
stairhead.</p>

<p>"Watch out," she called, managing only a husky whisper.
"They're bringing something to break the door in."</p>

<p>"Let them," Lije grunted. His head didn't turn. He was
standing in the center of the lobby, facing the place where Linda
knew the entrance door was, though she could not see it. Another
man was beside him, shorter, stockier. Both had guns to their
shoulders, the barrels pointing at the door. They were straddle-legged, indomitable, but Linda saw that their hair and the backs
of their heads were wet with perspiration.</p>

<p>It was deathly cold in that hotel lobby. The sweat that
dampened the skin of those two men was the sweat of fear...</p>

<p>The clerk, Thilton, was nowhere in sight. A stir came into the
lobby from beyond the unseen entrance, the thump of burdened feet
on the porch planks.</p>

<p>"Don't try any tricks," Lije shouted, "or we'll shoot."</p>

<p>A laugh answered him, hollow and horrible. The crash of stone
against wood obliterated it.</p>

<p>"Jehoshaphat!" the other man whimpered. "They're doin' it.
They're breakin' in."</p>

<p>"Can't stop them," Lije grunted. "But we can give them a taste
of lead when they get the door knocked down. Hold your fire till
you can see them, Jed."</p>

<p>The battering ram thundered again. Wood splintered. Bolts,
riven from their ancient fastenings, shrieked shrilly.</p>

<p>"Lead!" Jed exclaimed. "What good's lead against 'em? You
can't kill the dead!" His voice pitched upward to a squeal. "You
can't kill..."</p>

<p>Crash!</p>

<p>"That's what I'm going to find out. No use running now, there
ain't no place to run to."</p>

<p>Linda wanted to get back into her room, to lock her door and
cower behind it. But she couldn't. She couldn't move&mdash;she
could only lean over the rail and stair...</p>

<p><i>Crash!</i></p>

<p>The whole structure shook with that thunderous impact, but
apparently the door still held. The old inn was built like a
fortress. It had been built as a fortress, decades ago. It must
date back to the War of 1812, perhaps to the Revolution.</p>

<p>Light wavered on the steps. Linda had a sensation of eyes upon
her, of malign eyes watching her. She looked around... The dining
room door was open. She could see through it. She could see the
flower-banked coffin, the body&mdash;</p>

<p>The dead man's lids were <i>open!</i> Some shortening of their
muscles, drying, must have pulled them open. A dark fire
glittered in those eyes that should have been glazed and
sightless!</p>

<p><i>CRASH!</i></p>

<p>A scream tore out through Linda's throat, but whatever its
volume it was drowned by the final appalling detonation as the
battered door gave way; by the deafening explosion of the two
shotguns in the confined space.</p>

<p>Orange-red flares streaked from the gun muzzles. Frantic
fingers pumped reloading bolts. A skull-countenanced figure
leaped toward the defenders, leaping downward as though from
piled shards of the shattered portal. Lije's gun poured its
charge pointblank into the attacker.</p>

<p>As though that lethal burst had been the harmless spurting of
a child's cap pistol the apparition came on, laughed
mockingly.</p>

<p>Others leaped behind it, a ghastly pack. Jed's shotgun blasted
again... Then Jed's shriek was a scarlet thread of agonized
sound. The two defenders went down under that macabre rush. A
pile of green-scummed shrouds, of tossing skeleton limbs, hid the
men from Linda. But a carmine stream dribbled out from under the
seething mass, across the rutted tiles.</p>

<p>A single figure, that of the grim leader, extricated itself
from that heaving, awful mound. Linda's eyes followed him, her
limbs once more rigid in the grip of a nightmare paralysis. The
animate skeleton came inexorably toward the stairs. He was coming
for her, coming to take her...</p>

<p>No! At the last moment he veered, went into the room where the
dead man lay. He was sitting up! Henry Fulton, dead, mourned for
dead, was sitting up in his coffin!</p>

<p>"Welcome, brother," the spectral captain of the spectral troop
intoned, "welcome to our company of the dead."</p>

<p>Fulton, the body of Fulton, lifted his dead arms. But it was
not to the living corpse that his hands extended. It was not to
the apparition in the doorway that his face was turned. It was
the almost nude form of the staring girl to whom the orbs of
black fire were lifted. It was Linda towards whom those pallid
hands thrust, their grisly fingers curved like rapacious
claws.</p>

<p>"All in good time," the other answered that look and that
gesture. "You shall have your bride to warm your earthen bed for
you&mdash;as have all your brothers of the League of Lazarus. But
first..."</p>

<p><i>Icy fingers clutched Linda's arm!</i> She wheeled, flailing
out a small fist in reflex of terror. Lent strength, virulence,
by her terror, that fist spattered against flesh, broke her
captor's grip. She glimpsed a man staggering back against the
corridor wall behind her&mdash;Thilton! She leaped for the open
door of her room, slammed it closed&mdash;locked it in the same
motion. Leaned against it gasping, alternating waves of frigid
cold and torrid heat chasing each other through her body, a long
shudder shaking it.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch3">III. &mdash; SAVED&mdash;FOR WHAT?</a></h2>

<p class="first"> DEEP in Linda Loray's throat there was a
whimper of animal fear. She knew now why Thilton had induced her
to stay here the night, why he had not been down there in the
lobby with its defenders, who were now shredded flesh,
dismembered bones...</p>

<p>He was one of them, an accomplice of the incredible creatures
who called themselves the League of Lazarus. He had snared their
bride for them, their bride for the dead.</p>

<p>"Miss Loray." His whisper came through the thin panel. "Let me
in. I can get you away. I can save you."</p>

<p>The corners of Linda's lips twitched, distorting her mouth to
a humorless smile.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Miss Loray! Let me in quick, before they see
me."</p>

<p>"No." Linda was surprised to find her voice steady, was
surprised that she had a voice at all. "You can't fool me."</p>

<p>"I'm not trying to fool you. I'm trying to help you. I'm your
friend."</p>

<p>"Then prove it. Find Holt Carst. Get him for me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good Lord! Carst's&mdash;"</p>

<p>The whisper cut off, was replaced by the padding of stealthy
feet on the worn hall carpeting. Then there was other feet,
coming up the stairs. They stumbled, those feet, uncertainly, as
if they were numbed by sleep&mdash;or by death.</p>

<p>They thumped on the landing outside. The doorknob turned
against Linda's back and the door pressed against the bolt she
had shot.</p>

<p>"It's locked," the voice of the corpse's leader said.
Something answered him.</p>

<p>It wasn't a voice. It was a thick, tongue-less mumble that had
the inflection of words, though it was utterly unintelligible. It
was fuzzed by the throaty vibration that is called the death
rattle, but it was not made by a man dying. It was made by a man
coming alive after being dead.</p>

<p>"Open!" the first voice demanded. "Open for your groom."</p>

<p>Linda cowered away from the door, went wheeling across the
room, blind panic driving her as far away from those voices of
the dead as she could get. Flesh-less knuckles gartered against
the flimsy portal, and the panel shook.</p>

<p>The wall stopped Linda, and she cowered against it, her
dilated pupils on the thin barrier that was all that was between
her and&mdash;nameless doom. There was the sound of splitting
wood. The door must give...</p>

<p>The girl felt every blow on that door as though it was
delivered on her own cringing flesh. There was no hope for
her&mdash;no escape.</p>

<p>Escape? Hysteric laughter twisted her larynx. She was at the
window, the open window... She heaved herself up to the sill,
squirmed through to the slanting porch roof outside. Abruptly she
could think again...</p>

<p>She reached in, pulled the window shade down, then the window
itself. That would gain her precious moments, moments that would
mean the difference between safety and disaster. They would look
for her within the room first, beneath the bed, in the closet.
Meantime she could run along the porch roof, let herself down at
the end of the house, where she wouldn't be seen by those who
were still below.</p>

<p>She heard the door crash in, the sound distinct through the
glass pane. She twisted to start the flight she had
planned&mdash;and froze!</p>

<p>A footfall on the path below had pulled her eyes downward. She
saw Holt. Her lover. He was running up the path, his stride, the
jaunty pose of his head, unmistakable. He was running straight
toward that smashed entrance, straight into the clutches of the
terrible <i>things</i> who were making saturnalia below!</p>

<p>Behind Linda the shade rattled as someone brushed against it.
She still had a chance, but if she called to Holt, to warn him,
she would betray herself.</p>

<p>"Holt!" she cried. "Don't go in there, Holt. Stop.
<i>Stop!</i>"</p>

<p>He halted. Shade fabric ripped and the sash thumped up, behind
Linda. She heard the rattling mumble of the dead-alive. Beneath
her Holt was looking about him, startled, uncertain whence her
cry had come.</p>

<p>"Run, Holt!" the girl screamed, leaning far over the edge.
"Run!"</p>

<p>Something touched her back, snatching at it, something clammy-cold. She flinched from it, lost her balance, went hurtling over
the porch roof, went hurtling down to the darkness below...</p>

<p>Sight flashed to Linda in the whirling eye-blink of time that
she fell&mdash;a vision of Holt's gaping, startled countenance;
of the animate corpses pouring down from the porch and swarming
over him. Agony burned into her that her sacrifice had been
futile. Then she crashed into the branches of a bush that whipped
her face, lashed her almost nude body. Breath, all but the
faintest trace of consciousness itself, was jarred from her as
her body pounded those branches to the ground. She was catapulted
sidewise, hurled into dank, earthy darkness that enveloped her
brain.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">HER wounds netting her with a garment of pain,
Linda Loray weltered slowly back to realization of the miracle
that she was still alive.</p>

<p>Stygian darkness weighed heavily upon her, darkness so
complete that she could be sure her eyes were open only by the
feeling of lids stretched wide to stare. Clotted silence brooded
about her. Then she began to make out small sounds.</p>

<p>There was a <i>pit, pit, pit</i>, regular as a clock tick, not
far away. <i>Pit, pit, pit</i>. It might be water dripping, drop
by drop, from a tiny pipe leak.</p>

<p>There was, every now and then, a rustling crackle. Linda had
some time, somewhere, heard a sound like that before. It vaguely
disturbed her that she could not identify it... Then it came
again, a little louder, and she remembered. It was the sound the
timbers of an old house make, drying out, settling, never quiet
still, never silent.</p>

<p>There was another sound, faint but continuous, a soughing
overtone to the others. It seemed to come from over her head
where, she realized, the blackness was not quite so absolute. A
soft, chill breeze seemed to brush down on her from above,
bringing that vague whisper with it.</p>

<p>A breeze. The sound of a breeze. The sound of a breeze flowing
through damp grass, yet above her... Then she knew.</p>

<p>She was in the cellar of the old inn! She had not fallen
directly upon that bush, but upon the lateral branches of it, on
the side towards the house. The strong branches had acted like
springs, had thrown her light form under the porch, into the
hotel's basement. So swiftly had it happened, with no one's eyes
upon her, that it must have seemed as though she had vanished
magically, leaving no trace.</p>

<p>Her heart pounded against her aching ribs. She was saved. A
miracle had saved her!</p>

<p>And then, inwardly, she groaned. She was saved, but in her
stead the ghastly <i>things</i> that had risen from the grave,
the spectral beings who called themselves the League of Lazarus,
had seized Holt Carst, her lover. What had they done to him? Had
they served him as they had served Lije and Jed? Was he lying out
there on the lawn, torn?...</p>

<p>The thought she dared not word even in her own mind lifted
Linda to her feet. She twisted to the wall beside her, groped for
the place whence came the wind. She found it&mdash;a narrow
opening between short stone pillars that supported the foundation
beams of the hotel. By pulling herself up to the very tips of her
toes she could bring her eyes level with it.</p>

<p>She peered out, fearful of what she might see, yet knowing
that she must look for it. At first, the dim glow that met her
gaze blinded her, so complete had been the darkness here. But
after a moment, she saw that she was looking out between the
under-planking of the porch and the debris-strewn ground beneath
it. Beyond, where spread the luminance of a moon now high in the
heavens, she discerned the base of the bush that had saved her,
the shaggy lawn, even the path where Holt Carst had been when she
had spied him.</p>

<p>The grass was trampled, the path rough with footmarks. But no
blood stained them, no fragments of a body strewed them.</p>

<p>There was no sign of Holt Carst there, no sign that he had
been killed. What then? They could not have let him go. They must
have taken him off with them, to the inferno whence they came.
They must have carried him off to Satan alone knew what hellish
fate!</p>

<p>Linda's figure tightened on the jagged edge to which she
clung. Holt! A voice within her groaned. What have they done to
you?</p>

<p>And then terror struck at her once more. There was a rasp
behind her, a stealthy scrape of wood on wood...</p>

<p>She swung about, trembling hand to quivering breast, dry lips
twisting. There was light in the cellar now; a vertical sheet of
yellow light slicing down from a yellow slit in the black roof to
be cut off in a narrow, zig-zag line by ladder-like stairs at the
other end of the basement.</p>

<p>The slit in the roof widened, slowly. Its rim was scalloped by
a set of knuckles. A shadow blotched the opening, a man's shadow
that grew upon the stairs, grotesquely deformed, grimly ominous.
The trapdoor came fully open, and Linda saw Dan Thilton crouched
over it, peering down.</p>

<p>She had not been thrown into this basement quite unobserved.
He had seen her, and now he was coming for her!</p>

<p>Furtively, as though he believed her unconscious of his advent
and feared to alarm her before he could get her in his clutches,
he lowered first one, then another cautious foot to the top of
the ladder. He came down, slow and silent, the inexorable
messenger of the dead.</p>

<p>Linda crouched, darted along the wall, her unshod feet
noiseless on the earthen floor; fiercely glad that her almost
naked body was unhampered by garments that might rustle.</p>

<p>Thilton reached the base of the ladder, started straight
across for the spot where Linda had lain. No doubt, now, that it
was she for whom he searched&mdash;that he knew exactly where she
should be.</p>

<p>The girl's outstretched fingers touched stone, warned her that
she had reached the basement's corner. She twisted, crouched
motionless, her eyes on the prowler, a daring plan budding behind
her aching brow.</p>

<p>When Thilton got to the outer wall she would dart straight
across the cellar to the ladder. She could be up and out, the
trapdoor closed, before he was aware of her. There must be some
way to fasten it down, some way to imprison him, long enough at
least for her to escape from the inn, for her to rouse the
village to Holt's rescue.</p>

<p>She waited. Out of the path of light from above, Thilton was
only a moving bulk, hardly discernible, blacker against
blackness. He reached the foundation wall, grunted beneath his
breath. Now was her chance. <i>Now!</i></p>

<p>She launched into a run, swift and silent as a bat's flight.
She was yards from the corner, she was halfway to the ladder. She
was...</p>

<p>Her toe stubbed against something, and she went down. Rocks
bruised her. Rocks rattled down about her. Not rocks but coal.
She had run into a pile of coal in the blackness and it
avalanched down upon her in thunderous betrayal.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch4">IV. &mdash; PRISONER OF DOOM</a></h2>

<p class="first"> LINDA LORAY heard the sharp intake of Thilton's
breath. She heard his feet scrape as he whirled, heard him cry
out, sharply, as he plunged toward her.</p>

<p>"Miss Loray!" Even then there was something stealthy in the
sound of his footfalls, something furtive. "Thank God you're
alive! I thought..."</p>

<p>He reached her, bent to her, the round shape of his head
silhouetted against the trapdoor's light. Linda's hand flailed
for it, holding a chunk of coal she had grasped as she fell. The
impromptu missile landed square on the man's temple, the thud it
made sending a sick shudder through the girl despite her
desperation.</p>

<p>He collapsed heavily upon her, quivered, and was still.
Hysteria wrenched at Linda's larynx. She throttled the scream,
fought from under the man's dead weight. Bits of the coal
showered from her as she gained her feet, and she lunged for the
ladder.</p>

<p>She slipped as she reached it, barked her shin against the
sharp edge of the lowermost rung. Excruciating pain shot up her
leg. She clutched with frantic hands at the splintery wood,
pulled herself erect. She was up the ladder and out on the lobby
floor; she was tugging at the heavy trap door.</p>

<p>Its weight came up, swung over, tore itself from her bleeding
fingers with a ponderous crash. The hole in the floor was closed,
but there was no bolt, no lock, nothing to hold it shut. Linda
looked frantically about her, for the moment oblivious of the
shambles that made of the tiled floor a slaughter-house horror. A
deep-seated club chair was only a few feet away, its stalwart
frame promising weight enough for her purpose. She leaped to it,
grasped its arms and tugged at it.</p>

<p>It moved easily, sliding too easily on the carmine fluid which
lay in pools along the floor, but something caught a leg of the
chair before it was wholly on the trapdoor and Linda darted
around behind it to push it the rest of the way.</p>

<p>She halted&mdash;and dropped to her knees beside a bound,
recumbent form the chair had hidden from her.</p>

<p>"Holt," she gasped. "Oh, Holt!"</p>

<p>It was her lover, his ankles, his wrists lashed, a gag forced
between his jaws! It was Holt, his clothes half torn from him, a
livid bruise on his cheek, but alive. Alive and not a prisoner of
the <i>revenants</i>.</p>

<p>Linda's flying fingers untied the knot that held the gag in
his mouth, pulled the rag from it. Then they flew to the lashings
on his wrists.</p>

<p>"What happened?" she demanded. "What happened to you, my
dear?"</p>

<p>"Got away&mdash;from&mdash;those <i>things</i>," he mumbled.
"Came back here... look for you. Thilton jumped me from the
stairs... conked me... But you, Linda, why did you stay here?
Why...?"</p>

<p>"He told me to." Holt's hands were free and he was helping
Linda loosen the lashings that bound his legs. "Thilton. He said
you were busy, couldn't be reached till morning."</p>

<p>"The dog!" Their fingers touched and the old electric tingle
ran through the girl. "I <i>was</i> busy&mdash;trying to get the
villagers together to fight that damned League of Lazarus. Trying
to convince the townsmen that there's nothing supernatural about
the League. Your train had already left when Fulton died, and
there was no way of stopping you. But I left word with Thilton to
send Lije up to my house with you when you came. You would have
been safe there. Dan's in cahoots with them. I always suspected
him."</p>

<p>He was free now. They were both on their feet, and Linda was
in her lover's arms. "You poor dear," he murmured. "You must have
gone through hell. But everything's all right now. I'll take you
home and then I'm going after them." He was shrugging out of his
coat, was putting it around her. "I'll lick them alone if there's
no other way."</p>

<p>"What are they?" Linda cried, snuggling into the warmth of her
sweetheart's fur-lined coat, doubly comforting because it was
his, because it was redolent with the spicy tang of his tobacco,
of his masculinity. <i>"What are they?"</i></p>

<p>Carst's eyes went bleak, his lips tight. "I don't know. Nobody
knows. They first showed up when old Winthrop died, while I was
in Boston. His body vanished and a girl vanished, too. That's
happened three times since, and they've got all Torburg
terrorized, so nobody sticks his nose out of doors when any man
lies unburied, anywhere in town. This time I made up my mind to
stop the damn business. I sent Lije Carberry here to guard Hen
Fulton's body, and Jed Storm to watch the graveyard while I tried
to get the town aroused. But it wasn't any use."</p>

<p>"No. It was no use." Linda's eyes widened, as Holt's words
reminded her of what had happened here and the sight of that
which was strewn through the lobby&mdash;struck sickness through
her as it had not when she was so frantic. "Take me out of here,
Holt. Take me away from here."</p>

<p>"Yes dear," said Holt; he looked down at her tattered
nightgown, added, "As soon as you get some clothes on. Where are
they?"</p>

<p>"Upstairs. But I'm not going up there again." She shuddered.
"I'm going just as I am. Come on."</p>

<p>"You can't run naked through the streets. Your feet will be
all cut up. You'll freeze to death... Wait&mdash;I'll run up and
get something for you to put on."</p>

<p>"No! Holt&mdash;" But he was already across the lobby, was
already halfway up the stairs, taking them two at a time.</p>

<p>Horrible as was the thought of going up to that room again,
the thought of remaining alone here was still worse. Linda ran
after him, across the slippery tiles. She reached the staircase,
started up.</p>

<p>Carst yelled something, up there. His voice cut off. A black
shadow whirled into being at the head of the stairs. It swooped
down on Linda, enveloped her with its darkness. It swirled about
her, was drawn tight, pinning her arms to her sides, pinning her
legs together. Sightless, helpless in those swathing folds, Linda
suddenly felt something jammed against her face, smelled a
pungent, heady sweetness.</p>

<p>Hands gripped her, lifted her. She tried not to breathe, but
her laboring chest broke the seal she put on her windpipe. The
fumes gusted into her lungs, swirled up into her skull. She was
slipping, slipping down into vertiginous dark.</p>

<p>Just as her senses left her she heard the tongueless mumble of
the revived corpse to whom she had been promised as a bride. But
her last thought was of her lover.</p>

<p>Had they killed Holt, up there? Or...</p>

<p>A <i>thing</i> mewled, close by. And although Linda Loray
could not see what it was, because she had not yet summoned up
courage to open her eyes, she knew by the sound it made that it
was blind and mindless and without hope that death would ever
come to release it from its agony...</p>

<p>Linda was sick with nausea. The stone upon which she lay on
her side was damp and cold against her lacerated skin, and the
odor of death was in her nostrils, the stench of corruption.</p>

<p>There were other living things about her. Vague noises told
her so; a sighing breath, sluggish movement, the rub of two
surfaces one upon the other. There was a hollow, reverberant
quality to the sounds that told her she was in a more than
ordinarily large space, and that the exit to it was closed. But
it was the mewling that bothered, the half-human, half-animal cry
that seemed a prophecy of what she was to become.</p>

<p>Something touched her thigh, something cold and slimy. It
started to crawl across her quivering skin. Linda snatched at it,
flung the squirming, noisome thing away from her, trembling with
revulsion. And suddenly she summoned up enough courage to open
her eyes.</p>

<p>A green and spectral light pulsed against those throbbing,
pupil-dilated eyes. It came from flames that danced out of a
trephined skull supported on a tripod of human thigh bones at one
end of the space about which she stared. The skull's eye-sockets
were filled with the green flame. It glared through the jagged
triangle of its nose-pit, gleamed iridescent from its lipless,
grinning mouth.</p>

<p>The ghastly luminance played across a wide floor of damp-blackened stone. It stroked the pillars of massive arches that
curved overhead to form an interlaced roof, from which dripped
serrated stalactites like tears frozen to stony icicles. It
probed the shadows between the ranged pillars, thrust flickering
fingers through a wide-meshed lattice-work of rusted strap iron
and showed Linda what it was that moved&mdash;what it was that
mewled...</p>

<p>They were humans who were caged there! Naked women! Young
girls, or rather girls who once had been young, and now were
ageless from suffering.</p>

<p>Linda could see three of them. The one who mewled lay on her
side, her knees drawn up and pressed into her belly, her head and
shoulders curled over so that her blue-veined breasts lay against
those knees. Even in that emerald light the wealth of hair that
cascaded over the huddled form gleamed with warm red tints. Once
the girl must have been very beautiful. Once&mdash;before
whatever frightful experience she had passed through had ravaged
her, had left her a face a mouthing mask of horror and her body a
bundle of agonized flesh...</p>

<p>The others, on either side of the girl on the floor, were
erect and clinging to their cage-bars with fingers that writhed
worm-like against the rust-red straps. Their heads were pressed
against the bars, the curls of one golden as the sun, the
luxuriant crown of the other raven black.</p>

<p>The faces of these two, turned as if they were trying to see
one another, were contorted with a strange animal ferocity, with
a mindless hate. Their red lips pulled away from their white
teeth in silent snarls, their long-lashed eyes were orbs of lurid
wrath. But, and this was most horrible of all, they made no sound
and somehow Linda knew that they could make no sound, that
somehow speech was lost to them forever.</p>

<p>Abruptly the ghastly illumination flared into brightness!
Linda twisted to the source of the new light, saw that another
skull, on its thigh-bone tripod, had blazed into being at the
other end of the crypt.</p>

<p>This macabre flambeau was at the focal point of a tiered
amphitheatre rising behind it. The seats on that stepped and
curving rise were gravestones, so ancient that the stone flaked
from them, that their inscriptions were indecipherable beneath a
coating of green mould. Between them and the flaming skull three
coffins stood erect, the central one taller and more ornate, and
lidless, though the others were closed.</p>

<p>In the moment Linda saw all this an unseen bell filled the
chamber with a melancholy tolling. Like a death-knell...</p>

<p>A scream rang out. The terror-filled sound pulled Linda's eyes
back to the cages across from her. The red-haired girl had sprung
to her feet! She clawed at the barrier that penned her in, and
the rattling of the decrepit iron mingled with her screams, with
the fading notes of the bell that had tolled.</p>

<p>The cacophony aroused Linda to action at last. She thrust
frantic hands against the floor beneath her, to shove herself to
her feet. She lifted herself. Something tightened across her
hips, her ankles.</p>

<p>Linda clawed at the wide canvas straps. They had been loose
enough not to impress her until this moment, but they held her
inescapably. She writhed around, discovered she was free to sit
up, to bend and tear at the strange lashings.</p>

<p>"Don't be in such a hurry, dearie," a laugh cackled in her
ear. "You must first be properly dressed for your wedding."</p>

<p>The girl could not see whence the hag had come, but she was
bending over her, thrusting a sharp chin into Linda's face; her
eyes gleaming like black beads out of rheumy sockets, her great
nose hooked and vulpine, her skin yellow, wrinkled parchment, her
teeth yellow fangs in a drooling mouth.</p>

<p>Linda's own scream added itself to the turmoil. She struck at
the witch...</p>

<p>Fleshless fingers caught her wrist. They tightened, and with
amazing strength they held Linda stiff, motionless. The tiny,
evil eyes fastened on hers. The red rims expanded, the black orbs
within them were great dark pools into which Linda slid.</p>

<p>The girl went limp. "What must I do?" she asked, her voice
lacking expression.</p>

<p>"Obey Nitina," the hag cackled triumphantly. "Obey Nitina, and
Nitina will give you a groom such as many a girl might envy. But
first, here is your wedding dress."</p>

<p>She released Linda, bent and lifted from the ground a bundle
of white fabric. "See, is it not pretty?" she asked, shaking it
out.</p>

<p>It hung from her taloned hands, long and white and shapeless.
It was such a gown as no bride had ever before been proffered. It
was such a garment as long ago was used to clothe the dead. It
was a shroud!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch5">V. &mdash; HELL'S BRIDAL SPORT</a></h2>

<p class="first"> LINDA LORAY plucked at the hooks that fastened
the canvas straps to rings in the floor. Her fingers were clumsy,
her eyes slitted and dreamy, her face utterly expressionless.</p>

<p>She got herself free, came slowly to her feet, stood there
docilely. Nitina tore from her the few remaining shreds of her
night gown, and slipped the shroud over her head.</p>

<p>Even when the harsh skin of Nitina's fingers rasped her
bruised breast and sent fierce pain darting through her, Linda
did not move. Even when the hag's long nails tore a new wound
among the many on her lacerated abdomen she did not wince.</p>

<p>But when Nitina stepped back to admire her handiwork, and
indicated with a gesture that she might turn, the muscles in
Linda's thighs tensed for the quick leap she planned, the flight
from the hag toward a door she remembered having glimpsed to one
side of the banked gravestones. Her quick yielding to the witch's
hypnosis had been altogether simulated, had enabled her to avoid
a real surrender.</p>

<p>Linda wheeled&mdash;but she did not make that intended leap
toward escape possible.</p>

<p>She had delayed too long, and the way of possible escape she
had spotted was now impossible. The curved rows of seats were now
thronged by the dead-alive who had earlier raided the inn. They
sat on the monuments that should have weighed them down in the
long sleep, the sleep from which by some inconceivable necromancy
they had been evoked, and every eyeless socket of that grinning,
serried host was turned upon her.</p>

<p>There was no hope now, utterly no hope, of getting past them.
They would surely intercept her.</p>

<p>Even if by some miracle she should avoid their clutching,
skeleton fingers, whose awful power she had witnessed when Jed
and Lije had gone down beneath their ravening rush, the door was
blocked to her.</p>

<p>If <i>they</i> had shaken her with revulsion, the being that
strode in through that darksome entrance was horrible beyond
conception.</p>

<p>Words brushed Linda's tortured mind, words from a Book even
the mere memory of which, was sacrilege in this cloistered
theatre of hell:</p>

<p><i>"And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice,
'Lazarus, come forth!' And he that was dead came forth, bound
hand and foot with grave clothes; and his face was bound about
with a napkin."</i></p>



<p>He who came through that doorway&mdash;which Linda saw now was
shaped like the door of a tomb&mdash;and glided rather than
walked, was "bound hand and foot with grave clothes; and his face
was bound about with a napkin." The napkin covered his face, so
that Linda could not see it, and if in that moment she could be
glad of anything, she was glad that this was so.</p>

<p>For as he reached the center coffin of the three that stood
behind the green-flaming skull and took his place within it, the
deep-toned bell tolled once more and the rustling, expressionless
voices of the dead ranked above it dully chanted his name.</p>

<p><i>"Lazarus! Hail Lazarus!"</i></p>

<p>Lazarus bowed that white-bound, faceless head, and they were
silent. His white-swathed arm gestured to his right.</p>

<p>The lid that covered the coffin to which he motioned slid
down, seemingly into the very rock beneath it. In that place of
fluttering, earth-rotted rags, of white grave clothes, no
contrast could have been more ghastly than the meticulously
frock-coated figure revealed within that upended casket; no long-dead skull more horrible than the staring, waxy, sex-ridden face
of Henry Fulton.</p>

<p>Lazarus gestured to the left.</p>

<p>The lid of the coffin on that side slid down. Linda's eyes
widened, watching it wondering what weird figure it would
reveal.</p>

<p>There was none, none at all. The coffin was empty.</p>

<p>"The bride!" Lazarus' voice boomed out and echoed into the
hollow resonance of the crypt. "Let the bride come forth!"</p>

<p>The unseen bell tolled again. But now it was not a single peal
that filled the great vault. The muted strokes of the bell came
again and again, and its tone changed, so that it formed a
welling threnody. Higher in pitch, the sound of another, smaller
bell joined it, merged with it.</p>

<p>The measured melody of the mellower bell was the melody of the
Wedding March from Lohengrin. Beneath it, deep and hollow,
shaking Linda to the very core of her being, the greater gong
beat out the slow, measured notes of Chopin's Funeral March.</p>

<p>"Go, dearie," Nitina whispered behind her. "Go to your
place."</p>

<p>Linda was marching toward that empty coffin, her quivering
limbs keeping time to those strangely intermingled processionals
that beat about her and carried her onward on the bosom of their
palpitant flood. She went steadily toward the casket that awaited
her.</p>

<p>What else was there for her to do? What else save carry out
her pretence of conquest by the hag's hypnosis, hoping against
hope that something might occur to save her from that to which
she seemed doomed?</p>

<p>There was still within her, deep within her, the utterly mad,
utterly unwarranted thought that perhaps Holt was still alive,
that somehow he had once more escaped the minions of Lazarus and
would somehow rescue her before it was too late.</p>

<p>She reached that waiting corpse-box, entered it. The bells
moaned to silence.</p>

<p>"Dearly beloved," Lazarus intoned, in sepulchral mockery of
the words with which so many a devoted minister had commenced his
discourse on the inscrutable ways of his God, ways that were here
denied. "Dearly beloved, tonight we welcome among us a new
brother to our unholy company. Tried and tested in the ways of
evil is he, so that he has been accounted fit to be one of us. We
have with us too the bride he has selected to warm him in the
cold companionship of the grave to which he is destined. Living,
she shall feed her dead spouse with the life that is in her, so
that the chains of death shall not bind him, the earth not hold
him. So that, in the long years, he shall join with us in our
nightly revels.</p>

<p>"Such is our custom. But, as is also our custom, before the
grisly rites of their nuptials are consummated, we shall indulge
him who was known among the living as Henry Fulton, and her who,
still living for a space, bears the name of Linda Loray, with a
foretaste of those orgies we of the League of Lazarus have
preserved for the centuries since first they were presented in
the arenas of Imperial Rome. Is this your will?"</p>

<p>"Aye," the spectral congregation cried from their high banked
gravestones. "Aye. It is our will."</p>

<p>"So be it. And now our faithful Ninita, what have you
conceived for our pleasure?"</p>

<p>The hag hobbled to the center of the open space and ducked in
an almost ludicrous curtsey. "Something you'll like," she
cackled, "I'm sure. Something to which I've trained my pretty
ones with much trouble."</p>

<p>"Proceed."</p>

<p>The old witch curtsied again, limped toward the cages. There
was a key suddenly in her hand. She unlocked the cage against
whose bars the golden-haired girl pressed.</p>

<p>"Come, Naomi. Come my sweet."</p>

<p>The girl darted past her, the green luminance stroking her
unclothed limbs, flashing on her curves, on the secret charms of
her sleek body. She crouched, knuckles to the ground, lips drawn
back snarling from her gaping mouth, her eyes not human eyes but
the lurid orbs of a maddened beast.</p>

<p>"And Jane. You've been impatient for this time, I know."</p>

<p>The key creaked in the rusty lock; the dark-haired maiden was
whining as once Linda had heard a dog whine, eager to be at
another's throat. The iron door clanged open.</p>

<p>Jane leaped from the enclosure. She stopped for a moment,
gazed about her, evidently dazed. Linda was conscious of the
impulse to veil her eyes from that gleaming nakedness, a
nakedness not only of body but of murdered soul. Some horrible
fascination prevented her, kept her staring at those nude girls
out there, those girls who were circling now, heads thrown back,
faces virulent with hatred and contorted with a fierce animal
ferocity, arms crooked before them, palled fingers curved to
hooked claws.</p>

<p>"Go get her!" Ninita screamed. "Jane! Get her, Naomi."</p>

<p>They sprang at each other. They were clawing at each other.
They were tumbling on the stone, snarling, biting, gouging. And
the grisly spectators were not silent, but howling with
delight.</p>

<p>Their screams blasted down on Linda, beating against the
coffin within which she stood&mdash;cries of encouragement, cries
of lewd pleasure evoked by the naked limbs flashing in that
throbbing green light. With each shrewd blow, with each handful
of hair torn from a bleeding scalp, with each gory rake of
tearing nails across palpitant flesh, a shriek of sadistic
ecstasy shrilled from the yelling watchers.</p>

<p>Blood smeared the stony floor now, blood bathed the unclad
flesh of the maniac girls who fought for the delectation of the
dead-alive in a gladiatorial fray more awful than ever had been
staged in ancient Rome.</p>

<p>Linda managed to drag her staring eyes from the dreadful
sight&mdash;only to see the frock-coated man who should be dead
leaning out of his casket; his eyes, that should be glazed,
aflame with the dark light of frenzied ecstasy, and spittle
drooling from the corners of his writhing lips&mdash;that should
be frozen and still forever...</p>

<p>"That's the way, my little one!" Ninita's cry dragged Linda's
eyes back to the arena. "Finish her, Naomi."</p>

<p>The dark girl lay flat on the stone, quivering feebly. The
other kneeled on her, a scarlet-smeared, monstrous shape. Naomi's
torn hands were clenched on the other's throat, were tightening,
and in a sudden, brittle silence Linda heard the grate of
collapsing gristle.</p>

<p>Jane, the terrible shape that had been Jane, writhed once, and
was still. The victor lifted her head to receive the plaudits of
the mob.</p>

<p>There were no longer eyes in that contorted, carmine mask!</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch6">VI. &mdash; DREADFUL DILEMMA</a></h2>

<p class="first"> THEY had been taken away, the dead body of
Jane, and Naomi who less mercifully was still alive.</p>

<p>The green light wavered under the labyrinth of weeping arches,
between the thick dark pillars of that demoniac cloister. Sick
with horror, Linda Loray shrank within the casket from which she
dared not move; listened to the voice of the cerement-clothed
being who had been acclaimed as Lazarus.</p>

<p>"Well done, my Ninita," he was saying. "You have pleased us.
And what other little entertainment have you devised for us?"</p>

<p>"One that I think you'll like even better," the hag responded,
the seams of her saffron visage twisting in what she must have
meant to be a smile. "An improvement on a device of Nero's of
which you have told me."</p>

<p>"On with it then. Our bridegroom grows impatient."</p>

<p>"For this I must call help," the woman replied. She hobbled to
the opposite end of the crypt, passing the further flambeau.
Linda saw her reach the end-wall beyond it; saw for the first
time that it was broken by a door.</p>

<p>Ninita opened that door, and came limping back. A shadowy form
moved through the opening, came into the light.</p>

<p>Even in the full illumination the newcomer was still a shadow.
He was all black; his lithe body, his legs, his arms, his hands
and even his head covered by a skin-tight, dull black garment. He
faced Lazarus and lifted a long, coiling black whip in
salute.</p>

<p>Ninita's key rattled in the lock of the middle cage, the one
where the auburn-haired girl was.</p>

<p>What had happened to those other two had been horrible, but at
least they had been wholly mad and in all likelihood had no
conception of what they were doing, perhaps had not even felt
pain. She had seen this other suffer in anticipation, had heard
her scream at the sound of the bell that had announced the
gathering of the league. She would know exactly what was
occurring, would suffer trebly because she was
not&mdash;insane.</p>

<p>The cage door opened. "Come, Lillian," Ninita said. "It's your
turn now."</p>

<p>There was no sound in response, no voice, no movement.</p>

<p>"Lillian!" the hag exclaimed sharply. "Quickly!"</p>

<p>A murmur ran through the assemblage. Then Ninita was coming
out into the open again, and she was trembling with fright.</p>

<p>"Master!" she quavered. "It&mdash;she&mdash;Lillian is dead.
Dead from fright. And I have no other to substitute for her. We
shall have to dispense with what I had prepared for her."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" Linda breathed. "Oh thank God."</p>

<p>"You should have taken better care of her," Lazarus rebuked
the scrawny old panderess of sensation. "You may take her
place."</p>

<p>"No!" the woman screamed. <i>"No!"</i> Terror convulsed her
countenance. She went down to her knees, her arms flung out in
entreaty. "I have served you well. I do not deserve payment such
as that."</p>

<p>"It is by your negligence that the brotherhood is cheated of
its pleasure."</p>

<p>"Pleasure?" the witch squalled. "What pleasure will you have
watching this old flesh lashed, these old bones broken! Look!" In
an agony of desperation she tore at her clothing, ripping it from
her in rags. In seconds she was naked as her victims, her sere
and scrawny flesh exposed, her thighs yellow pipe-stems, her
torso a bag of bones against which her wrinkled breasts lay flat
and hideous. "But you need not be deprived of your game. There,"
she leaped erect, "there is one well-formed and beautiful. There
is the one who should be here in the arena for your delight."</p>

<p>She pointed&mdash;straight at Linda!</p>

<p>"Yes!" the fleshless voices of the dead-alive roared. "Yes!
Give her to us. Lazarus, <i>give her to us!</i>"</p>

<p>"Silence," their lord thundered. "Silence. It is for me to
decide."</p>

<p>They were still, ghastly still... Linda stood motionless as
the napkined head turned toward her. She could not see the eyes
behind it, but she could feel them upon her.</p>

<p>A sound broke that stillness, a sound more horrible than the
chorused voices of those living corpses. It was a mumble, the
tongueless mumble of the one who was too newly dead to have
relearned speech, protesting the loss of the bride that had been
destined to him.</p>

<p>"No," Lazarus intoned. "It is not for me to choose. I have
promised her to our novice brother. I cannot break that
promise."</p>

<p>They were angry now, the brotherhood of the dead. They let him
know it in no uncertain terms.</p>

<p>"Silence," he cut them off again. "Let me finish. I have given
my promise and cannot withdraw it. But there is one who may
choose. I leave the choice to that one."</p>

<p>His bandaged arm rose, his white-swathed hand pointed at
Linda. "Choose, you. Is it bride you will be, or&mdash;" That
pointing arm swept outward to the black figure, waiting just
before the distant skull with his lash. "Choose! Which shall it
be?"</p>

<p>Which should it be? Linda Loray peered across the green glow
to that snaking whip, coiling and avid for her flesh. Her head
turned.</p>

<p>She saw Henry Fulton, read his wax-white face, read the
meaning of his drooling, lascivious mouth. Even if he were
living... She shuddered, and her eyes went back to the other,
terrible shape.</p>

<p>"What is your choice, Linda Loray? Bridal bed or the
lash?"</p>

<p>The man down there at the other end of the crypt moved. His
head tossed back, as if to fling back a shock of hair as black
but more lustrous than the hairless cloth that covered it...</p>

<p>That gesture was unmistakable. It was Holt who stood there!
Holt Carst! Somehow he had managed to get in here, somehow
managed to overcome Ninita's helper where he had been waiting for
her summons. Disguised, he had thus contrived to get in here, and
now he had let her know who he was!</p>

<p>"I choose the lash," Linda announced, hard put to it to keep
her elation out of her tone.</p>

<p>The red-headed girl's death had made her rescue easy. Holt
would wait for her there, only a few paces from the door. When
she reached him they would both dash out. Before any of the
League of Lazarus could get to them they would be away...</p>

<p>"Come then, my duckling!" Ninita cackled. "Come, my
gosling."</p>

<p>"Go!" Lazarus commanded.</p>

<p>Linda stepped out of her coffin. She went past the chuckling,
relieved hag. She went past the flaming skull. She went steadily
across the stony floor that was slimy with the blood of the two
mad girls who had fought there to the death. There was joy in her
heart.</p>

<p>Holt drew the lash lingeringly between his black-gloved
fingers. He seemed to gather himself together. His acting was
superb.</p>

<p>The place was so still the silence beat at Linda, pressed
against her the shroud that was to have been her bridal gown. She
was near to Holt now, near enough to whisper.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart! You are so brave. So very brave!"</p>

<p>"You don't know how brave, Linda," his whisper came back to
her. "You don't know..." His arm lifted the short handle of his
whip. His wrist circled a bit, so that its long lash coiled in
wide, lazy circles about his head. He was gaining every instant
of time that he could, every instant that would be so precious
when they dashed at last for safety...</p>

<p>The lash struck out at Linda! It slashed across her side, cut
through the shroud-stuff and wealed her shrieking skin!</p>

<p>"Holt!" she screamed. "Holt!" And then she was screaming no
longer. Her arms were flung up to protect her eyes. Her head was
bowed, and the whirring, biting whip was playing around her, was
slashing at her. With infinite cruelty it flicked, just flicked
her garment, tearing the shroud wisp by wisp, stripping her naked
with its cruel bite.</p>

<p>"You fool!" Holt's voice was harsh. "This is what I brought
you here for!"</p>

<p>She was nude, entirely nude. She darted away. The lash curled
about her waist, brought her back to her tormentor, to her lover
turned torturer. It made a thorny web about her, a web through
which she could not pass. It bit at her skin, stung her flesh. It
had stripped her, and now it was flaying her...!</p>

<p>Her mind was caught in that tortuous mesh, wishing
only&mdash;and vainly&mdash;for the release of death...</p>

<p>A deafening detonation exploded about Linda. There were
screams somewhere, shouts. There were shots...</p>

<p>The whip was no longer whirring about her, no longer licking
at her. She went to her knees. Twisting as she fell, Linda saw a
tossing, uproarious chaos involve the slanting amphitheatre from
which the League of Lazarus had watched its saturnalia. She saw
uniformed men swarming among the corpses, saw a club lift and
fall on one grisly skull...</p>

<p>And a face, a grizzled, staring-eyed, but human face, appear
from within it!</p>

<p>Fingers clutched her throat from behind, fingers cloth-covered. "I'll make sure you won't talk," Holt's voice grated in
her ears. The fingers closed, hard upon her larynx, cutting off
her breath. A knee dug into her spine, garroting her. "I'll get
away and they won't know I've ever been here."</p>

<p>The fight was so fierce, up at the other end of the crypt,
that no one saw what was happening at this end. Linda knew she
was about to die...</p>

<p>Footfalls pounded out of the darkness. The strangling fingers
were suddenly gone from Linda's throat, the torturing knee from
her backbone. She collapsed to the floor, but the veil lifted
from her eyes. She saw a fist rise and fall on a black-swathed
head, saw the face of the man whose fist it was.</p>

<p>Youthful, but no longer grey-hued, no longer
brooding&mdash;Dan Thilton!</p>

<p><br>
"I MUST have lain there in the cellar a long time," Dan
Thilton said, "after you knocked me out. When I came to I crawled
out through the hole under the porch. I telephoned for the state
cops; then I followed the tracks of the so-called dead men. They
were plain in the graveyard, leading right to the tomb that was
the entrance to that place where they carried on their mumbo
jumbo. By the time I found the entrance the state cops came
driving into town, and we went right to work breaking that door
down. I guess we got down into the underground chamber just in
time to save you."</p>

<p>They were in the room where Linda had first awakened to
terror. She was clothed now. A grey dawn was pressing against the
window through which she had climbed, and from the lobby beneath
came the noises that told of the police-detail lining up those of
their prisoners who were still alive, getting them ready for the
bus that was to take them to jail.</p>

<p>"How did you know to look for me in the cellar?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I was on the porch roof, trying to get to you and talk some
sense into you, so I saw what happened to you when you fell. I
had to wait until the bunch that were dressed up as corpses went
back to the graveyard, and then I went downstairs to find you.
Carst was in the lobby, looking for you, I guess, and he jumped
me. I knocked him out, tied him up, and went on down to the
cellar."</p>

<p>"He said he had been arousing the people of Torburg to fight
the League of Lazarus. He said it was he who got Lije and Jed
here to fight them."</p>

<p>"That's right. He got them here and he gave them the shotguns
too, loaded with blanks so they weren't any good. Lije and Jed
and I weren't scared enough of his outfit to suit him, and he was
afraid we were going to make trouble, so he took that way to get
rid of us. But I was up here watching your room. You see, when
you came in and said he'd wired you to come here tonight, it made
me sure of what I'd already suspected&mdash;that there was some
connection between him and what was going on. Because those other
girls came here to marry Holt Carst, too! They vanished right
away. Queer thing was, they were all insured in his name."</p>

<p>"Insured...! I remember... He did get me to sign a paper, just
before he left. Said it was an application for a marriage
license, but it may have been an application for insurance. I
trusted him."</p>

<p>Linda opened her suitcase. She had already taken out of the
wardrobe the frilly, glamorous garments that, tired as she had
been last night, she had carefully hung up because they were to
have been her trousseau. As she started to fold them into the
bag, she glimpsed out of the corner of her eye Thilton's gaunt
frame, silhouetted against the window out of which he was staring
with grim bleakness.</p>

<p>"Sure it was an insurance application," he said. "Carst played
both ends against the middle. Getting the insurance on these
girls was the final business. In the first place, he got the
girls for that bunch of rich old libertines that paid him plenty
for a new kind of thrill. 'Lazarus' was the richest; his name
doesn't matter now that he's dead. And Carst is through, too.
Yankee juries work fast. He's through and Torburg's clean
again."</p>

<p>"I'm glad," Linda breathed. "It seemed such a nice village
from the little I saw of it last night."</p>

<p>"Nice isn't just the right word for it. It's grand. Carst and
his gang came from outside, and they soiled our town for a little
while, and now they are gone. But the hills were here before they
came, and will be here long after they are forgotten. The wooded
hills, the green and pleasant valleys, the white houses where
friendly people live..."</p>

<p>"Friendly people," Linda breathed, thinking of the cold grey
city to which she was returning. "Neighbors... Yes, it's a lovely
town. I'd like to stay here..."</p>

<p>Thilton looked at her, hope
dawning in his eyes. "Do you mean that? I wish you would. I was
thinking I'd have to move to Boston if I wanted to see you any
more&mdash;and I do... I love you, Linda."</p>

<p>As he came toward her slowly, shyly, Linda knew that she had
learned more about this man in a few hours of terror than she
could have learned in years of just living.</p>

<p>"I love you, too," she answered. Her voice was low, but joy
was in her heart. She thought. "It's funny, I did come here to
get married&mdash;and that's what I'm staying for!" She smiled.
But she didn't say it aloud&mdash;just then. She couldn't, for
she could not talk and be kissed at the same time. And by now she
was being thoroughly kissed...</p>
