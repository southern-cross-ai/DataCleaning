<p class="first">"YOU'VE been working too hard, Greg," Dean Thorkel,
chief editor of New York <i>Newscast Central</i> said. "This Paris
trip will set you on your feet."</p>

<p>Professor Gregory Vance stared at his friend out of glowing
eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to Paris, Dean," he said quietly. "Maybe by
tomorrow I won't be able to go anywhere."</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the white-tiled laboratory was suddenly
heatless with the chill of some brooding dread.</p>

<p>"Not going!" The newsman gasped. "Passing up the Einstein Award
Convocation! Hell, man! When it was announced in nineteen
ninety-six you told Cliff Hoskins and me you would devote your life
to winning it. That's why you've been slaving here at National U.
for seven years while I've been keeping an eye on seven seas and
five continents, and Cliff's been risking his life in the Military
Intelligence. You?"</p>

<p>"Risking his life." The words trickled from between the
scientist's white lips. "Risking&mdash;" A sharp <i>burr</i> cut
him off, the attention call of the wireless teleautograph in a
corner of the lab. He twisted&mdash;and then his voice was a thin
thread, wire-edged with terror. "There it is again!"</p>

<p>Thorkel leaped to the machine whose silver pencil danced eerily
across white, unrolling paper. "<i>Vance!"</i> The salutation was
abrupt. "<i>Final warning. You speak before you reach Paris,
willingly or&mdash;unwillingly</i>."</p>

<p>The newsman, his massively sculptured countenance chalky,
whirled to the disc of a verbal communications transmitter, but
Vance's hand closed on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"No use, Dean," the physicist whispered. "I've tried to trace
those messages before. He taps in from some unauthorized station of
his own, and it can't be located."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;who?"</p>

<p>"Ho-Lung."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" Thorkel breathed the exclamation. "He?"</p>

<p>Vance's thin lips quirked in a humorless smile.</p>

<p>"You've heard of him?"</p>

<p>"Who hasn't. He's the lone-wolf ace of the Asiatic Secret
Service. He's got ears and eyes everywhere. He's killed more
enemies of the Yellow Coalition than their armies. But no one knows
who or what he is. Sometimes I think he's a myth. But you're no
soldier or diplomat. What can he want of you?"</p>

<p>"Want of me?" Gregory Vance's slim white hands curled into
curiously ineffectual looking fists. "I'll show you."</p>

<p>He moved to the lab table, lifted a cylindrical graduate from
the stone slab of the laboratory table. From shelves on which
hundreds of bottles were ranged, each labeled with a number only,
he selected a half dozen vials. He carefully measured their
contents into the etched glass until he had a liquid compound that
was purplish and fuming. Somehow it seemed alive in the cold light
of the beta-argon bulb in the ceiling.</p>

<p>The physicist picked up a lens-shaped but hollow crystal,
dripped the solution he had concocted through a tiny opening until
it filled the cavity. Then he fitted the lens he had made over the
miniature bulb of an ordinary flash-light.</p>

<p>"Get down one of those cages with a white mouse in it, and place
it on the table." Thorkel obeyed.</p>

<p>"Watch!" Vance aimed the flashlight at the cage, pressed the
button. A green beam flashed out, uncannily bright even in the mock
daylight of the windowless room. It struck the mouse. An
exclamation of horror escaped from the newsman.</p>

<p>An instant before the tiny animal had been there, instinct with
life. Now&mdash;a glittering, viscid pool of iridescent oil
glittered at the bottom of the cage!</p>

<p>THE virescent light clicked out. Vance extracted the lens that
had converted an ordinary flashlight into an instrument of
annihilation, smashed the glass in the sink, watched the purple
liquid disappear, fuming, down the drain.</p>

<p>"Imagine searchlight beams fanning that green ray through the
skies and over the seas, trapping the oncoming hosts of an enemy
and melting them, melting human beings into oily nothingness as
that mouse was melted.</p>

<p>"Imagine their rocket-ships dropping uncontrolled from the
heavens, their surface craft colliding, sinking into a boiling sea.
What price invasion then?</p>

<p>"And all that is needed to make the weapon ready is the compound
to fill the hollow lenses. Every glass factory in the country is
now busy casting for the searchlights with which our coasts are
lined, for the aircraft beacons which dot the continent.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but how can mere light produce such an effect?"</p>

<p>"It's simple. You know that matter is the result of a
disturbance in the sub-ether, just as light is a vibration of the
ether. And that ether and sub-ether are intimately interconnected.
I have discovered a light vibration that steps up the vibrations of
material atoms one micron. It transmutes elements, in other words.
It acts only on organic matter, so far&mdash;transmutes the
elements of any living body to others a little higher in the scale.
And that?"&mdash;Vance nodded at the oily pool that had been a
living thing moments before&mdash;"Is the result of the
transmutation. Now do you know why Ho-Lung has been after me for
weeks?"</p>

<p>"For weeks!" Thorkel exclaimed in surprise. "But&mdash;your life
hasn't already been attempted. Surely I should have heard."</p>

<p>"No," the other replied. "He wants the secret for his country.
The ray is as formidable a weapon of offense as of defense. His
messages have taken me up on high mountains and offered me the
earth and the fullness thereof. He has resorted to threats only in
the past week, as I neared perfection."</p>

<p>"Neared perfection! It looks pretty damn perfect to me."</p>

<p>"The effects, yes. But adjustments are necessary so that the
target of the ray may not be shielded. My ray will penetrate any
material except a certain ferro-beryllium alloy. Unfortunately,
that alloy is the very one used to armor the Oriental rocket ships.
I am on the track of the solution. In a few days I hope to have it.
Otherwise&mdash;the thing is useless."</p>

<p>"But the Army laboratories! Surely they must be helping you on
this. You must have given them some idea of the thing, so that they
should be able to proceed if anything should happen to you."</p>

<p>"No. The War Department has ordered the hollow lenses purely on
blind faith in me. The basic principle of the ray is known by
myself alone. Our service is honeycombed with spies.</p>

<p>"Cliff Hoskins flew in from Manchukuo six months ago. Just a
week before that I had got in touch with the War Secretary and
given him in strictest confidence the barest outline of what I was
working on. Three days later, Hoskins, eavesdropping on a
conference of the Asiatic General Staff, had heard a full report of
every detail of my talk!"</p>

<p>"Then if you are killed the whole thing is lost."</p>

<p>"Wiped out!" Vance's hand erased a chalk mark on the table-top.
"Like that. If they can get the formula from me, well and good. But
as soon as they are convinced that I will not yield it to them they
will make sure the American Government does not get it either. That
is why I cannot go to Paris, why I must hide. I have a place
prepared, and I can get there unobserved. I shall show you how
later. There is only one chance in a hundred of their getting me,
once I'm away, but I want to guard against that one chance."</p>

<p>Vance pulled a paper from his pocket, handed it to Thorkel. The
other saw figures at the top, map co-ordinates of some point in the
Far North. Then there was a long line of curious symbols, symbols
that were vaguely familiar.</p>

<p>"The location of my hiding place," Vance explained. "And the
formula, in our old code."</p>

<p>Thorkel remembered. How clearly that brought back the old
student days, when he, Greg, and Cliff Hoskins had been
inseparable. Hoskins had been reading treatises on cryptography and
had challenged the other two to devise a code he could not
decipher. They had accepted, and won. Hoskins had accused them of
being unfair when he learned that three keywords were necessary to
the solution.</p>

<p>"The keywords are these." Vance wrote three words on a bit of
paper, displayed them to Thorkel, then tore the scrap of paper into
tiny fragments. "You know how much depends on the safety of that
formula. If you don't hear from me within a week, take it to the
Secretary of War&mdash;to no one else." Greg gripped Thorkel's arm,
his fingers digging deep in emphasis. "Remember, Dean, give the
formula to no one else, whoever he is, no matter what the
circumstances."</p>

<p>Vance turned to the door. "Now come out to the hangar with me
and I shall show you how I shall get away, literally unseen."</p>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE STOLEN CIPHER</h2>

<p class="first">DEAN THORKEL strode through the high-ceilinged
dispatch room of New York <i>Newscast Central</i>, his heels
clicking sharply on the rotunda's marble floor. He was oblivious of
the intermingled voices of the announcers droning to a million
listeners their running commentary on the televised picturing of
world events. He climbed stairs to his bright metal desk atop a
raised platform at the center of the hall. Beneath his chestnut
thatch his brown eyes were almost black with foreboding.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Thorkel."</p>

<p>"Morning, Haley. How'd the night go?"</p>

<p>"Fairly smoothly, sir." Randall Haley, night editor, was short,
emaciated, completely bald. His tiny eyes, uncannily bright behind
slitted, lashless lids; his sharp, hooked nose, gave him the
appearance of a bird&mdash;a vulture. "The Aurora Borealis is
kicking up again and Transcontinental Air's Arctic refueling fields
are cut off. But nothing ever happens up there."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll take over." Behind his expressionless features
a band seemed to constrict about Thorkel's brain. The electrical
disturbance might last for days. Suppose Greg wanted to communicate
with him&mdash;. He grunted vaguely. Sinking into his swivel chair,
he bent as if to fasten the lace of his shoe. There was the slither
of steel on steel, barely perceptible. In a moment Vance's cryptic
formula was safe in a secret drawer.</p>

<p>Thorkel straightened, switched the foot-square monitor screen
before him to the wave-length of a newscopter that hovered above
the hundred-story Science Tower of National University.</p>

<p>On the screen's shimmering surface a tiny figure emerged from
the penthouse laboratory where, to quote the Einstein Award
Citation, "science has leaped forward a century in five years." It
moved to a blue, toylike one-man gyrocopter that had been rolled
out of its hangar.</p>

<p>"Professor Vance is entering his 'copter, folks," the reporter's
voice droned. "In seconds he will take off&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Dean Thorkel, I believe," suave tones drawled from the
stairhead. Thorkel twisted around.</p>

<p>"Cliff Hoskins, you tramp," he roared, jumping up. "Where the
hell did you drop from?"</p>

<p>The stocky, dark man in quiet gray came across the platform.</p>

<p>"Hell's right," he responded, low-toned. "I tried to get here in
time to slap old Greg on the back before he left for Paris, but
skin-friction held my rocket plane up and I'm too late,
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're just in time," Thorkel snapped. "He's taking off. Look."
He turned back to the screen.</p>

<p>The imaged plane blurred as its vanes gathered speed. It lifted
from the roof, gained attitude in vertical ascent&mdash;and
vanished!</p>

<p>"My God!" the reporter cried. "That wasn't a static blot, folks.
Professor Vance is&mdash;gone. Blotted out, I can't see his plane
anywhere."</p>

<p>Low words thudded from Thorkel's lips. "It works. By all that's
holy, it works!"</p>

<p>"What works, Dean?" Hoskins questioned. "What's happened to
Greg?"</p>

<p>"He's skipped. He's putting himself out of harm's way until he
finishes his job."</p>

<p>"So you know about that!" Cliff Hoskins slid the seat of his
trousers onto the desktop. "Where did he go?"</p>

<p>"Sorry, Cliff. I can't tell even you."</p>

<p>"But you know. It's on something hidden in your desk." The
Secret Service man grinned. "It's okay with me, Dean, but you want
to be more careful. You looked down just then. That was a dead give
away. An Asiatic spy would not have missed it."</p>

<p>Thorkel, startled, swivelled about to where Haley, behind him,
was washing up. The little man's face was a mass of soap suds; he
could have heard, seen, nothing.</p>

<p>"I've got about a half hour to chin with you," Hoskins said.
"Then I've got to get back to Manchukuo. Big doings there."</p>

<p>For thirty minutes the Intelligence man told a rapt listener of
an East buzzing with activity, of new explosives by the hundred
thousand tons pouring from smoking factories, of vast arrays of
rocket planes and hordes of surface-craft, of all the gigantic
thunderbolt Asiatica was forging to launch at America, the only
nation strong enough to resist the Mongolian dream of world
domination.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Dean, we haven't a ghost of a show unless Greg
comes through. Even then&mdash;" Hoskins shrugged. "But I've got to
go." He rose, then paused. "Say&mdash;I may have to get in touch
with you, in a hurry. How?"</p>

<p>Thorkel reached for a memorandum pad, jotted some numbers on it.
"Here's the wave-length combo of my private line. I've just changed
it. Greg's the only other who knows it. That'll be the safest for
you to use."</p>

<p>Hoskins took the slip, studied it briefly.</p>

<p>"This may be foolish, but it's a habit," he said. He grinned,
crumpled the memo into a ball and popped it into his mouth. Then,
with an insouciant wave of the hand, he was gone, returning with a
smile on his face to the alien land where death stalked always at
his elbow.</p>

<p>"No report on Professor Vance's whereabouts&mdash;. No trace has
been found of Professor Gregory Vance." All the rest of that day,
all the next morning, the recurring phrase from the busy operators
pounded at Dean Thorkel, thumped into his brain. The total absence
of news from Greg meant that his plan was working, that he was
safe. But&mdash;</p>

<p>Mid-morning, a low, insistent <i>burr</i> pulled his eyes to the
serried row of phonejacks on his desktop. A red glow showed above
the furthest one on his private line. Only two men knew that
combination. Greg! It must be Greg! Thorkel slammed on his
headphones, jammed the dangling plug into its receptacle.</p>

<p>"Hello."</p>

<p>"Dean?" A flat voice, monotonous, unfamiliar. "Greg speaking.
Greg Vance." It didn't sound like Greg. Thorkel jerked down two
cupped discs from the headband across his skull, fitted them over
his eyes.</p>

<p>"What's up?" It was Greg Vance. The visor eyepieces brought his
image clearly, his high-domed head, the patch of premature gray at
its temples. But&mdash;it must have been the effect of the
Borealis&mdash;a greenish tinge filmed the televised face and the
eyes seemed glazed, expressionless.</p>

<p>"Dean!" the unnatural voice whispered. "Come to me. I
need&mdash;" A sudden shadow loomed behind Greg's head. It was
gone. There was a thud in Thorkel's ears, the soft thud of a fallen
body. Then&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>Someone had found Greg! Some enemy. Thorkel ripped the headpiece
away, crouched below the screen of his desk. He pulled out the
lowermost drawer. His hand slid within it, pressed against the
upper-edge of one side-piece, forced the apparently solid metal
down and to the rear. The steel slid. Thorkel's fingers fumbled
within the revealed cavity.</p>

<p>The concealed niche was empty. The paper that meant Vance's
safety, the nation's safety, was gone.</p>

<p>Thorkel lunged to his feet, leaped the stairs to the floor
below, ran in great, bounding strides to the exit. His 'copter was
parked, sleekly yellow, in the open roof-square. In a few seconds
he was in its driving seat.</p>

<p>Above, the traffic beam showed red, and a green police plane
hovered watchfully. But Dean Thorkel thrust over the throttle, and
the gyro shot up from its berth, zoomed through the thick
cross-streams overhead.</p>

<p>Thorkel had a momentary glimpse of a white-faced pilot at the
controls of a lumbering bus-flier as he shot across its prow. His
stubby wings scraped a rusting flivver's wings. A woman's shrill
scream came thinly up to him. The traffic cop's siren was in his
ears and the green plane was diving for him.</p>

<p>A twisted grin relieved the grimness of Thorkel's face for an
instant. His horizontal-flight propeller screamed as it bit the
air. The yellow gyro darted north. The police boat banked and was
after him. Dead ahead another green plane appeared, steadied,
waited ominously.</p>

<p>On the dashboard before the newsman a foot-square metal box was
fastened, crudely. Fine wires led from the box, and made a meshwork
on all the outer surfaces of Thorkel's gyro.</p>

<p>"You may have to reach me unobserved," Greg Vance had said, when
he had worked to install the queer contrivance. "This will enable
you to do so, as it will enable me to slip away unseen."</p>

<p>The first police craft was overhauling Thorkel, was fifty yards
behind. Its siren shrilled again, and a black, metallic tube
snouted at him. Thorket jabbed at a button on the front of the
box.</p>

<p>Two traffic officers rubbed amazed eyes, and looked again for
the yellow gyro that had flicked into non-existence between them.
But there was nothing to be seen!</p>

<p>Everything outside his own little ship was nothingness to
Thorkel's eyes. He was in a tiny world of his own, suspended in
illimitable, empty space. Only sound beat in to him from the
invisible world about him, the sough of the crowded air-lanes two
thousand feet below, the muted roar of the great city still lower,
the rattling thunder of the pursuer's prop, the police siren
moaning into sudden silence.</p>

<p>On the fifteen thousand foot level, where chances of collision
were at a minimum, Dean Thorkel drove on northward. Blind flying
with a vengeance, this was, though broad daylight and an unclouded
sky were all about him. For that same daylight was flowing around
his gyro, the ether waves curved by the field of force the little
box produced and the fine wires guided. No sight could come to
Thorkel of things beyond that network, nor could anyone beyond that
network see his plane. The light waves were warped.</p>

<p>"Good thing," Thorkel muttered, "that I've got a sound-wave
robot pilot instead of the old style radio-reflector, or I'd sure
be out of luck."</p>

<p>Cold crept into the yellow gyro-copter's cabin, cold that even
the high altitude heat-coils could not combat. The position dot on
the robot-pilot's map was close to the point where it became
necessary for Thorkel to take over the manual control for the
landing. He pressed a black button.</p>

<p>An illimitable expanse of snow and ice stretched desolate
beneath him. Overhead the Aurora's macabre dance of sheeted light
was eerie against night's black curtain. Far to the west an
air-borne dot circled, minutely scarlet. Instinct, the call of kind
to kind in the vast loneliness, told Dean Thorkel that this was a
plane, man-guided. It faded into the lurid dance of the Northern
Lights.</p>

<p>The automatic control relinquished the plane's guidance. Moments
later, Dean Thorkel stumbled across tumbled blocks of ice. He
passed a blue plane, frost-whitened, hidden beneath the overarch of
a pressure-ridge. His breath fell in snow before his mouth, and
each inhalation was an agony. The snow-hill just ahead was a house.
Its outlines wavered as the icy fingers of a forty-below
temperature twisted his brain. The shape of a door was vague in the
ice-encrusted wall.</p>

<p>He forced a numbed hand to it. But the door opened before he
touched it. A tall figure stood in the jagged rectangle. Its long
face was a white, expressionless mask. Gregory Vance lifted an arm,
jerkily, beckoned Thorkel in.</p>

<p>"Greg!" Thorkel's intended shout was a frozen whisper. "Greg!
You're all right! I thought&mdash;" Thorkel went across the
threshold, reached for the statuelike figure of his friend, touched
its shoulder. Suddenly Vance crumpled, to the floor, slowly,
horribly, as the man-form robots used in domestic service crumple
when the power-cast fails.</p>

<p>"Greg!" Dead eyes stared up at Thorkel. Just beneath the
hairline a threadlike scar circled, crimson on the gray-white
forehead. Thorkel peered closer&mdash;</p>

<p>"Freeze. And keep your hands away from your body!" Dean Thorkel
twisted to the sharp command behind him. He saw a squat apparition,
formless in a loose black robe; the head a faceless black globe, a
black-gloved hand thrusting at him the blued steel of a forty-shot
Trinite gun. Thorkel stiffened, his arms grotesquely out from his
body.</p>

<p>The voice came again through the swathings, flat, colorless.</p>

<p>"You are Dean Thorkel." It was not a question, it was a
statement.</p>

<p>Eyes glittered through holes in the ebon fabric. The black
figure was ten feet away. It was useless to attack him. Before
Thorkel could possibly close with him the tiny Trinite projectiles
from his gun would tear into the American, would explode, and he
would be spattered flesh.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm Thorkel. What do you want?"</p>

<p>"The keywords of the cipher Vance left with you."</p>

<p>Then the formula was safe! The cipher was unreadable without the
keywords. Thorkel shook his head, wordlessly.</p>

<p>The flat, cold voice was brittle.</p>

<p>"It will be better for you to give it to me willingly. I shall
have it from you&mdash;be assured of that. And the process will not
be&mdash;pleasant."</p>

<p>Torture! The Mongol's were adepts at it. But torture could not
make a dead man talk! Thorkel's knees dipped, his hands fisted. He
sprang&mdash;straight at the pointing gun!</p>

<p>Something caught his ankles, tripped him. Amazingly, Vance's
body jerked toward him, headfirst across the floor! Thorkel
fell.</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; VANCE'S CORPSE</h2>

<p class="first">THE newsman lifted slowly back to consciousness
through a weltering purple darkness that was thick about him. His
head pumped pain against a thin band tight around his skull.
Fingers fumbled at his brow. His eyes opened. A black-swathed head
floated before them, and glittering pupils in which glinted green
flecks of light peered at him. A relentless, unhuman voice beat
against his dulled ears.</p>

<p>"What is the code?"</p>

<p>Thorkel's lips tasted salty blood. But he forced words through
them. "No!"</p>

<p>The black head drifted upward as the Oriental straightened. The
gun was gone from his hand, but there was something else in it,
something metallic from which wires trailed. One filament came down
to Thorkel's head, the other disappeared within the spy's robe.</p>

<p>The gloved hand twisted at that which it held. Fire bound Dean
Thorkel's head in agony. Fire ran, a searing flood, through his
veins. Sight, hearing, were gone. Feeling alone was left as every
cell of his body quivered in anguish.</p>

<p>Then the fire died, and he was a limp, helpless mass on the
floor.</p>

<p>"What is the keyword to the cipher?" Cold, pitiless, the
inexorable question came down to him from the masked figure.</p>

<p>There was no escape, no hope of rescue. Greg Vance had chosen
this location because of its isolation, its loneliness. Eventually
human endurance would crumple and Thorkel would be compelled to
divulge the key-words. Yet Thorkel still could say, through gritted
teeth, "No, you scum," and gather himself to withstand the return
of hell.</p>

<p>It didn't come. The spy twisted to a frost-hazed window. The
stutter of a descending plane was muffled by thick walls. The
masked torturer bent to his victim, twitched the wire off. An inner
door closed behind his retreating form.</p>

<p>The front door shoved in before the rush of bulked bodies.</p>

<p>"What's going on in here? What's all the delay?" Two men,
formless in heavy furs, were inside the room. There were Trinite
guns in their mitted hands. There were red tabs on their shoulders,
the badges of the Northwest Flying Police!</p>

<p>"He's inside," Thorkel gasped. "The killer's in there!" He poked
a shaking hand at the inner door.</p>

<p>The Flyies whirled.</p>

<p>"Come on, Connors." one yelled, "McKraken's inside!" The two
made a diving rush across the floor, were in the other room.</p>

<p>A wave of nausea rose, engulfed Dean Thorkel in a dizzy
whirlpool. Air! He had to have air! He fumbled through the door,
reeling. Intense cold struck at him, froze the mists from his
brain. He saw a black shape flitting across the ice, saw it vanish
behind a hummock. The slayer was escaping! He must&mdash;</p>

<p>Iron fingers gripped his arm, hauled him back into the house. A
gun snouted in his face. "Not so fast, you!"</p>

<p>"He got out," Thorkel yammered. "He's getting away!
Quick&mdash;you can still catch him!"</p>

<p>The Flyie's reply was heavy with sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah! We'll chase shadows outside while you beat it. Say, we
cops may be dumb, guy, but we don't fall for the same stunt twice.
Stick 'em up!"</p>

<p>"Hey, Daniels!" The one called Connors was standing over Greg's
body. He had a paper in his hand. "Guess who this stiff is! It's
that Professor Vance&mdash;missing since Monday. This 'tele'
picture's kind of blurred, but it's him all right."</p>

<p>Daniels swore picturesquely. "An' this is the bird that killed
him. Well, Connors, that McKraken's slipped us, but we've made a
damn sight better catch. Here's where we get our stripes." Steel
cuffs clicked over Thorkel's wrists.</p>

<p>"You're making a terrible mistake," the newsman protested. "The
murderer is escaping while&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure it's terrible&mdash;for you," the officer scoffed, heavily
humorous. "I'll say you're running in tough luck. Here we're out
hunting a mechanic from Z40 refueling field that's stabbed his
boss. We see your gyro's down here, think it's the yellow boat he
took to make his getaway, and come busting in&mdash;just in time to
spoil your little party."</p>

<p>"I tell you I'm not the murderer," Thorkel pleaded. "The real
killer is escaping, while you're fooling around with me. Vance got
a call for help through to me&mdash;I'm chief editor of New York
<i>Newscast Central</i>&mdash;and I reached here just too late.
Vance opened the door for me. He dropped just as I got in. It was
that close. The killer jumped me and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all wet," drawled Connors, kneeling to examine the dead
Vance. "This corpse is stiffer than a poker&mdash;he's been dead at
least twelve hours."</p>

<p>Hysteria edged Thorkel's cry.</p>

<p>"But he talked to me not an hour ago. I saw him&mdash;"</p>

<p>The policeman's big hand flicked out, slapped stingingly against
his mouth. "Cut the fairy tales, you." He shoved the bewildered man
roughly into a chair, snapped another handcuff around one ankle and
a chair-leg. "Let's take a look at the body."</p>

<p>Thorkel buried his face in his linked hands. An hour ago Vance
had called for help on the wave-lengths. Only Vance and Cliff
Hoskins knew how to compose the combination of his private line.
Minutes ago Vance had welcomed him at the door of his retreat. Now
he was dead and the Flying Policeman, trained to determinations of
that nature, his opinion not to be disputed, had pronounced the
scientist to have been lifeless for twelve hours at least!</p>

<p>Talk penetrated.</p>

<p>"Man, look at this! What the hell has this bird been up to?" The
prisoner lifted his head, saw that Greg's body had been turned over
on its face, saw Connors pointing to wires that coiled out of two
tiny holes in the center of a shaved patch at the back of Vance's
head. They trailed across the floor and were kinked where Thorkel's
feet had caught in them in his mad, sacrificial rush at the
black-swathed figure!</p>

<p>"We'd better send in a report, before we investigate further,"
Connors was saying as Thorkel's eyes clung bewilderedly to the
metal threads. "Looks like the Borealis has quit. We ought to get
the captain up here."</p>

<p>"Check! There's a communication set in the other room. And say,
confirm this lad's claim that he is editor of New York
<i>Newscast</i>." Connors went out, and his partner turned to the
prisoner.</p>

<p>"What's the idea of the wires?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about them. Look here&mdash;"</p>

<p>The policeman jerked about, his Trinite gun suddenly in his
hand. The outer door was slowly opening! Thorkel went rigid in his
chair, expecting again the squat, jet-draped torturer. The one who
strode in, though short, was a fur-clad bulk. Thorkel glimpsed his
face. An incredulous shout leaped to his lips&mdash;"Cliff!"</p>

<p>Daniels' gun stabbed.</p>

<p>"Hands up, you! Up high!"</p>

<p>Cliff Hoskins' arms reached ceilingward, but his voice was
unperturbed. "Hello. Dean. Glad you, at least, are safe." His calm
tone steadied Thorkel, he was no longer friendless in an inimical
world.</p>

<p>The police officer advanced threateningly.</p>

<p>"One of his gang, eh." His voice rose. "Connors! Oh, Joe! Come
in here. There's another baby just popped in. Come in here and put
the bracelets on him."</p>

<p>"No, cop. You're not putting any bracelets on me. On the
contrary, you're taking them off Dean Thorkel, here."</p>

<p>Daniels' jaw thrust out, and his eyes slitted. "Oh yeah? Mighty
sure of yourself, aren't you? Who the blazes do you think you
are?"</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Hoskins, of the Army Intelligence Service. On
special duty."</p>

<p>"More fairy stories! You birds sure tell them high, wide, and
handsome."</p>

<p>"That will be enough low comedy from you. Take my thumbprints,
check them with Headquarters." Authority snapped in Hoskins' voice.
"Be quick about it too, if you want to save your jobs."</p>

<p>The flying policeman's tone was sullen as he saw credit for an
important capture slipping from him.</p>

<p>"All right. All right. I'll check your thumbprints. But there's
no need to get shirty. I'm just doing my duty."</p>

<p>"Right. But try to do it less unpleasantly." The thumbprinting
was quickly accomplished, and Connors retreated to the
televisophone. Daniels permitted Hoskins to lower his arms, but
watched him wearily. Hoskins ignored him, spoke to Thorkel in low
tones.</p>

<p>"We'll have you out of those as soon as the checkup comes
through. I got wind of what was going on up here only a couple of
hours ago, and I sure burned the stratosphere getting here from
Harbin. Just what has happened?"</p>

<p>Thorkel's words tumbled over each other. Hoskins' face was
expressionless, but his eyes grew granite-hard. "I can't figure it
out at all," Thorkel ended. "There's something wrong,
somewhere."</p>

<p>"Greg was already dead when you got the first message." Hoskins
stated that humorlessly.</p>

<p>"Huh!"</p>

<p>"I'm not spoofing. The tip I got in Harbin gave me the picture.
The Oriental spy reached here yesterday and tortured Vance to get
the formula. Greg's leaky heart gave way. The spy had the cipher,
but he had to get you up here to read it. He posed Greg's body in
front of the visophone tube-eye and spoke from some hiding place
nearby. The corpse started to topple, he had to pull the connection
in a hurry. But he'd got what he wanted across."</p>

<p>Thorkel objected, almost pleadingly.</p>

<p>"But Greg opened the door for me. He motioned me in."</p>

<p>"That's the meaning of those wires. The Asiatic scientists have
found that by applying an electric current of a certain intensity
to the proper brain areas they can produce muscular reactions in a
dead body similar to those the same areas controlled in life. It is
merely a refinement of the ancient experiment of making a dead frog
kick by electrifying the muscles themselves. You disturbed the
adjustment when you touched Greg, and he dropped."</p>

<p>"He's Hoskins, all right." Connors' reentry cut the friends'
colloquy short. "And H. Q. says we are to obey his orders to the
letter."</p>

<p>Daniels flushed brick red.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Lieutenant," he stammered, "but I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forget it!" the Intelligence Man interrupted. "Unlock those
cuffs. Then get out in your plane and scout for the killer."</p>

<p>As the door closed behind the cops Hoskins swung back to
Thorkel.</p>

<p>"But they haven't the ghost of a show," the latter said. "The
spy is halfway back to Manchukuo." Hoskins shook his head.</p>

<p>"He must be hanging around. As long as you're alive with the key
to that formula he won't give up. That's why I sent the cops away.
I'm sure he couldn't have spotted my arrival. He'll figure you've
been left alone here, and return. We'll be ready for him this time.
He's a sly fox, and we've got to be careful how we bait the trap.
The stage must be set just right. Let's see&mdash;" Hoskins' eyes
were glowing with a strange light. "Get back in that chair and play
'possum. I'll hide in the other room."</p>

<p>Thorkel sprawled in the chair, his head lolling.</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"Great! But keep your eyes closed. And&mdash;I almost forgot!
You had better give me the keywords to the cipher in case anything
goes wrong. He may get one of us."</p>

<p>"The keywords are&mdash;" Thorkel cut off.

<p>Greg's unclosed, dead eyes seemed eerily to signal a message to
him. Words echoed within his brain: 'Remember&mdash;give the formula
to no one else, whoever he is, no matter what the circumstances.'

<p>"Perhaps I had better not, Cliff," he said slowly. "Greg enjoined
me to give the secret only to the Secretary of War, no matter what
happened. I've a queer feeling that I should not disobey him."</p>

<p>Hoskins' black eyes blazed sudden wrath. Then, with a visible
effort, he was smiling.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, old man. Greg could not have foreseen our
present predicament. Besides, you know damn well that he would have
entrusted the cipher to me, had I been available. He told me his
plans months ago."</p>

<p>"You're right, Cliff. I'm a superstitious ass. The words
are&mdash;" There was a jarring thud against the door, and sounds
of a scuffle. A blast of cold swept in a struggling group. The two
Flyies were back, and between them&mdash;Dean grunted in
astonishment&mdash;between them was the wizened form
of&mdash;Randall Haley!</p>

<p>Hoskins' words were thick with inexplicable fury!</p>

<p>"What's this?"</p>

<p>Daniels saluted.</p>

<p>"We spotted this guy going like blazes in one of them new
one-man rocket planes, but we couldn't get within two hundred miles
of his speed. He landed about a quarter-mile from here, concealed
his plane and sneaked right up to this house. He was trying to
listen at the door when we jumped him!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; HA-LUNG UNMASKED</h2>

<p class="first">THORKEL stared at his assistant. Haley must have
stolen the formula, must have known that he held the key. The
damning facts tumbled into his brain chaotically. Information came
to the <i>Newscast</i> editors' desks that was often
suppressed&mdash;for the nation's good.</p>

<p>Haley's newscard would admit him where the general public was
barred! Then Randall Haley was the Asiatic spy&mdash;Ho-Lung! He
had returned to complete his crime, just as Cliff had predicted.
Dean Thorkel leaped to his feet, flung out an accusing arm.</p>

<p>"Haley," he shouted. "Where's that paper? Where's the paper with
the formula of the green ray?" His face was livid.</p>

<p>The little assistant editor appeared dazed. He retreated before
Thorkel's fury, despite the Flyie's grasp on his arm.</p>

<p>"I don't understand, Mr. Thorkel," he twittered. "I&mdash;I came
up here to get you out of trouble&mdash;to identify you.
What&mdash;what paper are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"That acting won't get you anything, Haley, or Ho-Lung. You've
got away with it for twenty years, but the game's up. You know what
paper I mean; the paper you stole from my desk." Thorkel advanced
on the man. Haley was against the wall, one foot was lifting,
slowly, its sole scraping against the plaster. His lips trembled
pathetically.</p>

<p>"&mdash;I don't know to what you refer. But&mdash;but if
anything is missing from your desk, perhaps Mr. Hoskins can tell
you about it. He looked through its drawers last night&mdash;said
that you had sent him for something. I knew he was your friend and
permitted it."</p>

<p>Thorkel thrust his face close to the bird-like countenance. "You
lie, damn you."</p>

<p>"The whole night force will bear me out. Visophone them and
ask."</p>

<p>There was ludicrous dignity in Haley's refutation, the ring of
truth in his statement. Dean Thorkel wheeled to Hoskins, who had
drawn a little apart. The chair was between, and Thorkel caught at
it.</p>

<p>"What about it, Cliff?" A faint sneer lifted the Secret Service
man's lip. His hand hovered very close to the butt of his holstered
gun. "He's just playing for time, Dean."</p>

<p>For an instant Thorkel was irresolute, then something snapped in
his brain. The holes in Hoskins' smoothly spun story were suddenly
caverns to his sharpened perception. His fingers flattened against
the metal of the chair.</p>

<p>"Maybe," he barked, "maybe you're right. You're so damn pat with
your explanations of everything, suppose you explain a few more
things. For instance, how you got here right on the spot, moments
after the spy escaped, without the Flyies' having seen your plane.
Why you were so all-fired anxious to get the keywords of the cipher
out of me as soon as they were gone. And how it happened&mdash;I
was a fool not to see it sooner&mdash;how on earth it happened that
the faked call came in on my private line, the wave-length
combination of which was known only to Greg, who was dead, <i>and
to you!</i>"</p>

<p>Hoskins' glance flicked past Thorkel. His gun leaped from its
holder. His eyes were twin pinpoints of menace. "I'll explain,
Thorkel," his voice rang out. "And if anyone so much as twitches a
finger I'll explain with Trinite spray. <i>I am Ho-Lung!</i> Vance
escaped me when his heart gave way, but I'll get the formula from
you, and all hell won't stop me!"</p>

<p>Death vibrated in the room's stunned silence.
Hoskins&mdash;Ho-Lung&mdash;crouched, his lips retracted from white
teeth. From the corner of his eye Thorkel saw Daniels leap to one
side, hunting the shelter of a cupboard, dragging at his weapon.
Blue flame darted from Hoskins'
gun&mdash;once&mdash;twice&mdash;there was the spatter of pellets
striking their target&mdash;and the flesh-muffled roar of the
Trinite blast. The room rocked beneath Thorkel, and a warm liquid
splashed across his face to haze his vision with a red mist.</p>

<p>As if of their own accord his hands jerked up the chair they
grasped, hurled it at the momentarily distracted spy. Then he was
off his feet, catapulting in its wake. <i>Crack!</i> The renegade's
face squashed under the news-man's fist. <i>Crack!</i> Another
hammer blow struck home. Hoskins was down, Thorkel swarming atop
him.</p>

<p>He heard a faint cry&mdash;"Stop, Dean, stop it!"&mdash;but his
hands were clamped about a soft throat, and berserk fury made his
fingers a tightening vise.</p>

<p>Hands were pulling at Thorkel.</p>

<p>"Let up! Let go! Killing's too good for him," someone was
shouting. He surged to his feet.</p>

<p>Daniels, white-faced, leaned against the wall. His left hand was
gripped tightly about his right. He stared dazedly at a pool of
blood on the floor, a pool fed by a diminishing stream from Haley's
shattered, legless torso.</p>

<p>Suddenly the shambles disappeared from Dean Thorkel's
consciousness. He darted to the body, jerked at a bit of black
fabric protruding from the rags that had been his assistant's fur
coat.</p>

<p>From his nerveless hand a black robe hung sleazily, and a long
black bandage through which two eye-holes had been cut! Thorkel
stooped again. His fingers, searching, encountered wires, a Trinite
gun. Then paper rustled. He started at cryptic symbols that danced
before his eyes, symbols in Greg Vance's familiar handwriting. It
was the cipher&mdash;the cipher that held a nation's safety! The
proof was complete. It was Randall Haley who had stolen the
formula, Randall Haley who was the torturer! Then&mdash;what about
Cliff Hoskins?</p>

<p>"God, Dean, you've got the kick of a mule," the self-convicted
traitor mumbled, painfully lifting himself to a sitting posture,
his mauled features twisting into a battered grin.</p>

<p>Thorkel held the disguise out toward Hoskins. "Then&mdash;then
you are not Ho-Lung," he stammered.</p>

<p>Hoskins' grin became more pronounced. He wiped blood from his
mouth.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I am Ho-Lung," he said calmly. "I didn't lie."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hoskins laughed. "It's a bit complicated. I am Ho-Lung, one of
Asiatica's most famous spies, and yet I am not a renegade to the
white race, nor a traitor to the American Intelligence
Service."</p>

<p>Thorkel's expression of dazed perplexity was pitiful. "I don't
understand."</p>

<p>"I don't blame you. I was born in Asiatica, the son of American
missionaries who were both killed in an accident soon afterward. I
was adopted by Ho-Chien, an Asiatic high in the Secret Service of
that country. He sent me to America to study, with the very
brilliant idea that close acquaintance with our country's ways and
customs would make me a most efficient spy indeed.</p>

<p>"What Ho-Chien did not count on was the call of my own people.
At the University I realized that I was an American, a white. I
realized that I could be of tremendous service to this country by
pretending to continue to play the part of an Asiatic spy, while
being in actuality a member of the American Intelligence Service. I
told Ho-Chien that I was doing to America what I was actually doing
to the Asiatics, that I was acting as a member of the American
Service in order to further my work for the Easterners."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;Ho-Lung&mdash;are notorious as a shrewd, cruel
spy. The exploits with which Ho-Lung has been credited&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hoskins chuckled.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have built up quite a reputation for Ho-Lung, so much so
that he has become a legend of terror. That, I imagine, is why
Haley signed that name to his communications threatening Greg. And
it was a sort of poetic justice. For the way Ho-Lung got his
reputation was by stealing credit for the work of others.</p>

<p>"You see, the Oriental Service is so managed that no one agent
is known to another. Each works independently, getting what aid he
can manage if he needs help. It was easy, then, for me to drop
hints that this, that, or the other deed was mine, careful hints
that spread in just the right quarters. Of course, every so often I
did turn in real information, obsolete plans of fortifications,
specifications of armaments carefully altered so that they were
useless, names of American spies whom I knew had already been
discovered, or were in a place of safety.</p>

<p>"There was one operative, somewhere in America, who was
particularly successful, and whose identity I could not ascertain.
It was he who turned up what Greg Vance was doing, he who had
charge of the operations in connection therewith."</p>

<p>"Randall Haley!"</p>

<p>"Randall Haley. He got the wave-length combination of your
private line by the old device of a waxed sheet hidden in the memo
pad on which you jotted it for me."</p>

<p>"But why did you denounce yourself as Ho-Lung?"</p>

<p>"Because if I hadn't we'd all be shreds of pulped flesh now,
blown to bits. I wondered why Haley shrank against the wall, why
his foot was lifting, scraping against it. And then I saw a tiny
bit of metal, there, that fine wire running out through the
door-edge." Hoskins pointed at it.</p>

<p>"I guessed what he was up to. The current he used for the
torture wire came from a small, but powerful battery concealed in
his clothing, the circuit grounded through the sole-nails in his
shoe. If Asiatica could not have the formula, he was determined
no-one should. If the contact in his shoe ever reached that wire, a
spark would have set off a Trinity bomb he had previously buried
beneath the ice just outside.</p>

<p>"My claim to be Ho-Lung confused him just long enough for me to
get my gun out. The cop grabbed for his own gun. I had to shoot the
gun out of his hands to save myself, and all of us. But I got
Haley!"</p>

<p>"Great work," Thorkel exclaimed. "Yet Haley won anyway. We're
alive and we've got the formula. But Vance is dead, and it will
never be completed now."</p>

<p>"I wonder. What's on that other slip of paper? It fell out when
you pulled the formula from the dead man's clothing. You were too
excited to notice it."</p>

<p>Thorkel looked where his friend pointed. Then he snatched the
bloody slip of paper up. Words were scrawled on it, five words that
changed the history of the world.</p>

<p>"Increase third acid by 1.2%."</p>

<p>Dean Thorkel's voice dripped into the cold.</p>

<p>"Greg's handwriting. He finished it. He finished the formula."
Thorkel pulled a sleeve across his forehead, clearing away a vision
of blazing homes, of a yellow swarm pouring over a fair, happy
land. "Let's get going to Washington, Cliff. They're waiting for
the green ray."</p>

<p>Cliff Hoskins stuck out a big paw.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, old man," he rumbled. "I've got to get back to
Manchukuo. There's work waiting for me there."</p>
