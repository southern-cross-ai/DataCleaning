  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; MARK OF THE DEVIL'S HOOF</h2>

  <p class="first">THEY had taken away the rude wooden trestles on which the
  coffin had lain, and the room to which tragedy had called back Ruth Adair was
  just the same as it had been two years ago when she had left it&mdash;except
  for the heavy, cloying scent of funeral flowers mingling with the salt tang
  of the sea.</p>

  <p>"Jim!" The girl's speech was muted, tight with a queer dread. "Why didn't
  they let me look at my father before they took him away?"</p>

  <p>The driftwood fire within the deep embrasure of the stone-smudged
  fireplace was shot through with darts of green and scarlet. Shadows overhung
  the two&mdash;dark shadows brooding between the adze-hewn, time-blackened
  rafters of the low ceiling. Against the firelight Jim Horne's stalwart figure
  was a tall silhouette, somehow ungainly in the suit of Sunday best he had
  worn to Cap'n Eli's obsequies. His wind-reddened, broad-planed features were
  expressionless, masklike.</p>

  <p>"You were late." The words boomed from his deep chest. "If we had been any
  longer, the dark would have caught us out on Dead Man's Arm."</p>

  <p>"But it was my father, Jim. My father! I had a right to say good-bye to
  him."</p>

  <p>The man's big fists knotted at his sides. "You had a right to stay here
  with your father and your old mother and not go off to New York, draining
  them of their little savings while you studied singing." There was almost
  savage rebuke in his tone, and bitterness. "If you had stayed
  here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jim!" Her sharp cry cut him short. "My life is none of your affair. I
  told you that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;two years ago, yes. You have not changed." A tiny muscle pulsed in
  his cheek. "Then I have no business here." He turned abruptly away, was
  across to the door in three stiff-legged strides. But he twisted around just
  as he reached it, and there was tortured urgency in his voice. "I came back
  to say one thing, and I will say it. You must go back. You must go back to
  the city tonight. You must not stay here."</p>

  <p>An old anger flared within the girl. "I must not! Who are you to tell me
  when to come or go? When I take orders from any man it will not be a
  slow-minded fisherman, a great hulking clod good for nothing but to heave a
  net and pull an oar."</p>

  <p>Jim's eyes blazed, then suddenly were bleak. "All right," he mumbled
  thickly. "It'll be your fault..." He pulled the door open&mdash;was gone.</p>

  <p>Ruth stared at the drab, fitfully lighted oak, and the dull ache beating
  in her brain was not all because of her loss. Behind her the fire crackled,
  and slow feet thudded.</p>

  <p>"Some tea mak' yoh feel better, Miss Ruth." The corpulent negress coming
  in from the kitchen had a cup and saucer in her lumpish, black hands. She set
  them down on the slab-topped chartroom table at which Cap'n Eli would never
  sit again, conning his maps and sailing in fancy remembered voyages. "Yoh
  ain't had a mite t'eat sence yoh come home."</p>

  <p>"No, Lidy," the girl said drearily. "No, thank you. It would choke
  me."</p>

  <p>"Then stir it. Please, Miss Ruth, stir it for me."</p>

  <p>"You're still at that foolishness, Lidy? I..."</p>

  <p>"Please." There was an odd insistence in the way her old nurse said it.
  Ruth shrugged. She was too tired to argue, too dreadfully tired. She swirled
  a spoon in the streaming liquid, laid it down. The black woman leaned heavily
  on the table, peering at the circling of leaves on the tea's surface, and she
  seemed cloaked with an eerie shadow, blacker than the mourning garments in
  which she was clothed. For a long moment there was no sound save for the
  dully booming advance of the sea that the ancient walls could not keep out,
  the surge of the sea coming up close to the house and the swishing hiss of
  its retreat.</p>

  <p>Ruth's finely chiseled nostrils flared a bit, and her chin quivered.
  "Lidy." Anguish edged the girl's tones, though her eyes were dry. "What was
  the matter with everyone at the funeral? Why didn't they talk to me or to
  mother? Why did they run away right after father was&mdash;was buried, as
  though they were afraid of something?"</p>

  <p>Afraid! Voicing it, Ruth suddenly knew what the strangeness was that had
  overlain the heavy-bodied, bony-visaged fisherfolk from the village beyond
  the dunes. It was fear that lurked in their eyes, some crawling, inexplicable
  fear that had hurried them along the sandy spit and away as soon as that
  which had to be done was done, and Cap'n Eli lay couched at the very tip of
  Dead Man's Arm. Fear had been a tangible presence under the scrub pines that
  grew only on that narrow peninsula jutting into the water, was inexplicably
  even now a chill warning in her veins. In God's name what was this aura of
  fear to which she had returned?</p>

  <p>"Lawd a-massy!" Lidy's exclamation jerked Ruth's startled glance to her.
  "De good Lawd p'eserve us!" It was half prayer, half groan. The woman's
  work-calloused fingers clutched the table edge and shook with an
  uncontrollable ague. She was staring into the tea-cup. Grayness filmed her
  face so that it was like chocolate that has been alternately heated and
  cooled.</p>

  <p>A cold prickle chilled Ruth's spine. "What is it," she cried, momentarily
  back in her childhood. "What is it you see, Lidy?"</p>

  <p>"Ah sees mo' trouble a-comin' to dis house," Lidy chanted in a hushed,
  rapt monotone. "Ah sees de debbil hisself a-comin' outta de sea." She was
  looking at Ruth now, and in the black depths of her distended eyes
  light-worms crawled. "Dis very night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ruth fought herself out of a billowing miasma of unaccountable dread.
  "Nonsense," she cried. "You can't frighten me with your silly nonsense any
  more. I'm grown up, Lidy. I'm no longer a little girl."</p>

  <p>Protruding, thick lips, a leaden blue, writhed. "No, Miss Ruth. Yoh is no
  little girl. Yoh is ripe foh Satan an he comin' foh yoh. De leaves say it an'
  de leaves doan lie. De debbil boat sail on de bosom o' de ocean, an' de
  fingers o' Dead Man's Arm beckon it. Yoh got to go away. Yoh got to flee
  right now befoh de moon rise to mak' a path foh de ship f'om Hell. Yoh got to
  go away."</p>

  <p>A queasy dread twisted at the pit of Ruth's stomach. Had Jim's words been
  a warning then? Was the negress reechoing that warning? "Go away? Lidy, how
  can I go away and leave my poor mother alone in this lonely house? She is so
  old, so feeble&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How yoh think yoh mother gwine feel when she see yoh wid you pretty haid
  stomped to bits by de debbil's hoofs like yoh daddy..." The negress' hand
  flew to her twitching mouth, but Ruth saw only the affrighted, staring eyes,
  saw only the horror that had leaped to their surface.</p>

  <p>"Stamped!" The girl's skin was an icy sheath for her body. "Oh God! That
  was why the coffin's lid was screwed down so tightly! That was why they
  wouldn't let me kiss his dead lips! What was it that happened, Lidy? What was
  it that killed him?"</p>

  <p>Lidy's terrified glance crept to the teacup, to the black oblong of the
  window beyond which the sea surged, came back to Ruth. "De same thing dat
  killed Otis Blake. De debbil..."</p>

  <p>"Shut up, yoh ol' fool!" The hoarse roar from behind pulled Ruth around to
  the kitchen doorway. "Shut up yoh fool talk o' de debbil." A huge negro
  filled the aperture, his shoulders touching the jamb on either side. The
  firelight slid silkily over the brown gleam of his big-muscled arms, over his
  columnar neck, was quenched by the sleeveless shirt tight over his barrel
  chest. "I done tol' yoh I done had enough o' dat." In the dimness Lidy's son
  was a simian brute; half crouched, prognathous jaw outthrust, corrugated
  black brow receding from bony eye-ridges.</p>

  <p>"William! What does she mean?" Ruth gasped the question at him, forcing
  the sounds past cold fingers that seemed to clutch her throat.
  "What&mdash;How did my father die?"</p>

  <p>The negro's gaze shifted to her, his small eyes red-lit with smoldering,
  bestial hate. Just for an instant, then a veil seemed to drop over them, and
  there was only an emotionless black face looking at her. "Doan yoh pay mammy
  no never min', Miss Ruth."</p>

  <p>"Answer me!"</p>

  <p>"He walk on de breakwater an' de rocks give way. Big stone fall on his
  haid. He daid w'en Misteh Hohne fin' him." He was mumbling, evasive. Ruth
  caught herself up. Lidy's wild words, her own grief, were clouding her
  reason. "Mammy gettin' weak in de haid, cryin' de debbil done it."</p>

  <p>The woman whimpered, "Stones doan' kill Mist' Blake. He lie under de pines
  an' blood pour outta he t'roat dat's tore open by de sea-debbil's claws."</p>

  <p>"By de knife he kill hisself wid."</p>

  <p>Lidy's voice rose. "Whah de knife? Dey ain' foun' no knife..."</p>

  <p>"Hush." Ruth swayed, clutched at a chair-back for support. "Hush, both of
  you. You'll wake up mother with your wrangling." Weariness dragged at her,
  was an aching flood torturing her body.</p>

  <p>"Get me a candle. I'll talk to you tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Would Jim Horne come to her tomorrow, realizing she had not meant her
  harsh words?</p>

  <p>"Yoh heah dat, mammy. Get Miss Ruth her candle an' den come along to de
  village."</p>

  <p>"To the village? You&mdash;aren't you sleeping in your room behind the
  kitchen, Lidy? Aren't you...?"</p>

  <p>"De las' year Cap'n Eli mak' me leave de house w'en I get troo my work. He
  say he doan wan' nobody in de house at night. But I stay here tonight. I
  sleep in my ol' baid."</p>

  <p>"Yoh will not!" William's protest was harsh-voiced. "Yoh'll come
  home..."</p>

  <p>The black woman turned on him, and suddenly her cringing was gone and she
  was erect, determined. "I sleeps heah, an' I watches ober Miss Ruth. Remembeh
  dat, Willyum. I watches dat no harm come to huh, like I done watched foh
  sebenteen year ontell she went to de city." Ruth was aware that the glances
  of mother and son had tangled, that a silent, meaningful conflict raged
  between them. And this time it was the man who gave way.</p>

  <p>"Yoh suits yohself," he mumbled.</p>

  <p>"I want you, Lidy," the girl put in. "I want you to stay here. It's bad
  enough that father will not be here tonight."</p>

  <p>"Good night, den." The negro growled. "Ah's gwine home befoh de moon
  rises."</p>

  <p>Climbing the partition-enclosed stairwell, shadows retreated from the
  flickering flame of Ruth's candle and formed again behind her. The worn wood
  treads vibrated vaguely with the beat of the sea as though the old structure
  itself were shivering at some dim threat. A sense of foreboding brooded about
  her, a sense of impending evil. In the hallway Ruth stopped at the door of
  her mother's room, listened. There was no sound from within, no sound at
  all.</p>

  <p>Her cold hand crept to the knob, closed on it. She was afraid&mdash;she
  was almost afraid to open the door. She turned the knob, noiselessly, pushed
  against the seamed wood to swing it open, slowly, without a sound.</p>

  <p>Candlelight filtered into the slant-ceiled, papered room. It painted with
  luminance a pinched, worn face that was as white as the pillow on which it
  lay, as white as the hair that was a wraithlike aureole about the wrinkled
  brow. One thin, almost transparent hand lay curled, flaccid on the
  coverlet.</p>

  <p>Flaccid&mdash;there was utterly no movement in that bed. Janet Adair was
  ghastly still. Dread squeezed Ruth's heart&mdash;and then her held breath
  hissed softly from between her teeth. Her mother had sighed in her sleep,
  tremulously. The pale lips moved.</p>

  <p>"No, Eli. Don't do it." The breathed words were just audible. "Don't
  betray the sea you love." So low the muttered speech was that the girl was
  not quite sure she heard. "Not even for Ruth. The sea's vengeance is
  terrible. It will take us all before it is through."</p>

  <p>The girl waited, but the sleeping woman said no more. After awhile Ruth
  closed the door and stumbled down the hall to her own old room.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE HELL SHIP LANDS</h2>

  <p class="first">RUTH ADAIR came awake with a start. Dread squeezed her
  heart, lay heavily upon her, more heavily than the coverlet that seemed to
  stifle her breathing. The voice of the sea beat against stillness. From
  outside a sharp sound came, and Ruth knew what it was that had awakened her.
  There was nothing ominous about the sound. It was only the flap of a sail, of
  a wet sail spilling the wind. Yet somehow the girl was afraid.</p>

  <p>The window was a grey oblong, glowing with the luminance that is
  forerunner of the moon. Ruth stared at it, chill little shivers running
  through her. Beyond the window was a sandy beach, running down to the
  breakwater that defied the nibbling of the waves, and beyond that was the
  sea. It was all as it had been as long as she could remember, she told
  herself. Just as it had been&mdash;there was nothing out there to fear.
  Nothing. If she looked out of the window she would see nothing but the beach
  and the sea.</p>

  <p>If she looked out! She dared not look out, and yet she knew she must. She
  could not lie here, cowering with a nameless terror. She could not lie here
  watching the shadows move across the ceiling as the moon rose, watching the
  shadows and waiting, waiting with bated breath for the doom that was creeping
  upon her, to strike&mdash;the doom against which Jim Horne had warned her,
  the evil Lidy had seen in the Sibylline cup. Her bare feet thumped on the
  floor, and slowly, step by step, she forced her reluctant legs to carry her
  to the window.</p>

  <p>Water swished, rippling against a long keel. A ship was coming into the
  cove and the moon was rising. The moon...</p>

  <p>The sea was a long, oily heave, and to the right it was blotched by a
  black bar that was Dead Man's Arm. The cape angled, halfway out, like a bent
  elbow, and its farther end split into five curled fingers of bleached rock
  that looked for all the world like a beckoning, skeleton hand. A thicket of
  dwarfed evergreens made a loose, shaggy sleeve for the arm, ended abruptly at
  the wrist of that bony hand. It was just there Cap'n Eli had asked to be
  buried...</p>

  <p>There was nothing in the little bay before the house. The vast, darkly
  undulant expanse to the far horizon was utterly empty. A light showed above
  and beyond the pines, a point of yellow light. Even as Ruth glimpsed it, it
  grew, became a crescent whose lower edge the pine-tips jagged. A silvery
  shimmer glinted on the water, became a lane of golden radiance lying on the
  bay's surface. From the skeleton wrist it made a path of light to the
  breakwater&mdash;to the gap in the breakwater that must be the very spot her
  father had lain, pulped by falling rocks the sea had loosened.</p>

  <p>A path! The moon was making a path... The girl's throat was suddenly dry
  and her scalp prickled with eerie fear. A shadow was forming, there in the
  crook of Dead Man's Arm. It darkened the bosom of the sea&mdash;was sweeping
  along the luminous lane with silent swiftness. Ruth gulped. It was only a
  catspaw of wind, she tried to tell herself, roughening the water. She had
  seen it a thousand times... Oh God! <i>It was the shadow of a full-rigged
  schooner sliding over the cove's surface!</i> Clearly, unmistakably, it was
  the shadow of a ship close-hauled&mdash;but there was no ship to cast the
  shadow. There was only that ominous silhouette darting toward the shore,
  toward the house, with a grisly soundlessness...</p>

  <p>The shadow of the breakwater swallowed it, and it was gone. But somewhere
  a pulley creaked, and furling canvas slatted. Somewhere a phantom rope
  screeched, reeving through protesting sheaves. Ruth moved icy hands,
  thrusting them at nothingness as if to ward off the approach of terror...</p>

  <p>A footfall thudded just below.</p>

  <p>Fear slowed, then shook Ruth's pulse, so that her heart jerked like a live
  creature in her breast. The beach was silvery with moonlight, but the glow
  had not yet reached the house and a murky gloom lay along the stone
  foundation walls. Within that pall of shadow something moved, a pallid
  something, wraithlike, without form.</p>

  <p>The little hairs at the back of her neck bristled, and her throat
  contracted in a low whimper.</p>

  <p>A voice rang out. "Who dat?" Lidy's voice, challenging, a-thrill with
  terror. "Who dat climbin' oveh de breakwater?"</p>

  <p>Ruth's gaze darted to the retaining wall of piled, loose stone. The blue
  lunar glow lay clear along its tumbled disorder, and there was nothing there,
  nothing except a vague shimmer that might have been the quiver of air rising
  from the sun-heated rock. Nothing. But a hissing whisper came from the sands
  as though someone moved across it.</p>

  <p>"Who dat a-comin?" The black woman surged out into the light, crouched,
  staring at nothingness. She was a hulking shape at the edge of the shadow, a
  white cotton nightgown enveloping her rotund form, flapping against her black
  shins. "Stop! Stop dah!" Lidy's arm lifted and Ruth saw that a carving knife
  was clenched in her fist. "Yoh cain't have Miss Ruth whilst I lives. Keep
  back!"</p>

  <p>The knife flickered as if Lidy were slashing at some attacker. It stabbed
  out and down into empty air, but there was a gruesome chunk as if it had
  plunged into flesh. The negress tugged it back&mdash;its polished blade was
  oddly dull now, swallowing the light&mdash;and slashed again. Then, suddenly,
  the weapon flew from her hand, arced, thudding to the sand, and she was
  clutching at her throat, was clawing at it. She was being forced backward,
  was being driven down to her knees&mdash;by what? Mother of Mercy! What
  grisly invisible power was it that had Lidy by the neck, that was
  overpowering the old servant?</p>

  <p>A horrible, choking gurgle came up to Ruth. It was grotesque,
  unbelievable. The colored woman was alone out there, absolutely alone, and
  yet she had fought an invisible someone and had been conquered, was swaying
  on her knees, was battling unseen fingers that squeezed her throat, cutting
  off breath, life itself.</p>

  <p>A scream rasped Ruth's throat. Lidy was down. She was a convulsed hulk,
  writhing on the sand. Her head twisted around in the spasm of her anguish,
  and the girl could see her bulging eyes, her contorted face, the tongue
  protruding from her mouth. Life was being choked from her, and still Ruth
  could see nothing of her attacker, could see that there was no attacker.</p>

  <p>It was over. Lidy Nore was a still, black heap on the sands, an almost
  naked corpse, flaccid, pitiful. Lidy was dead on the sands, killed by some
  dread presence from beyond the pale. Was it thus that death had come to Otis
  Blake? To Cap'n Eli? Death striking unseen out of the moonlight?</p>

  <p>Was that death stalking Ruth now? <i>"Yoh is ripe foh Satan an' he comin'
  foh yoh."</i> The slain woman's warning sounded in her ears, and horror
  gibbered at her from the moonlight. "Keep back," Lidy had defied the
  invisible. "Yoh cain't have Miss Ruth whilst I live." And now she no longer
  lived.</p>

  <p>Lidy had given her life to protect her and she could not leave the old
  woman's body out there for the crabs and the sand-worms. She pulled herself
  around from the window, padded to the door. She was out in the musty,
  lightless passage and its murk was alive with a dark malevolence that had
  infested all the house. Against the pound of terror in her breast, by sheer
  force of will compelling her strength-drained limbs to function, she forged
  through the gloom to the staircase, groped for the banister and went down
  until she was crouched, trembling and weak, against the rough wood of the
  entrance door.</p>

  <p>Through the panel the sound of movement came, of something dragging
  through the sand, the whispering sound of furtive movement across the hissing
  sand. Ruth's hand froze on the door knob. Her whole body was rigid, icy in
  the grip of a crawling nightmare paralysis that was the acme of fear. The
  phantom killer was outside. He was coming for her.</p>

  <p>Why had she not heeded Jim's warnings, and Lidy's? Why had she not fled
  from this accursed place while yet there was time? She had stayed because of
  her mother, and now the doom from the sea was coming to finish its work, to
  slay her and her mother and leave the house an empty, lifeless shell, staring
  out at the waters from windows through which there would be none left to
  look.</p>

  <p>No! A sudden, desperate courage surged up in her, broke the impalpable
  thongs by which terror bound her. It was she for whom the invisible presence
  came&mdash;Lidy's vision had warned that&mdash;and if it did not enter the
  house her mother would be safe...</p>

  <p>Ruth jerked open the door, lurched out to meet her doom, lurched down high
  steps to the sand. Then she stopped, tensed for the leap of the killer, for
  the pounce of the slayer from the sea.</p>

  <p>The roar of the tide beat about her, and damp cold of the shore night
  struck through the sheerness of her nightdress to chill her body. Moonlight
  lay, a pallid blue film on the sands, mounded over Lidy's contorted corpse
  like a shimmering, winding sheet. Dead Man's Arm held the ripple of the cove
  in its crook, and its skeleton fingers lay beckoning under the gibbous moon.
  Otherwise there was nothing&mdash;appallingly nothing. No living thing moved
  on the deserted beach.</p>

  <p>Ruth moaned, got somehow to the dead negress, knelt to her. The sand here
  was trampled, torn up by Lidy's struggles. But there were only the tracks of
  the devoted servant, coming from the steps to the place where she had died in
  futile sacrifice. There were no footprints, no spoor of whatever it was she
  had challenged and fought, between here and the breakwater. No sign of any
  other presence. No sign of how death had approached.</p>

  <p>Breath hissed from between Ruth's teeth, and the pounding of her heart
  slowed. The clean, briny redolence of the on-shore wind was blowing the
  cobwebs from her throbbing brain. Sanity returned, seeping slowly back to her
  bewildered soul. Smatterings of things she had read came back to her.</p>

  <p>Lidy had challenged something invisible, had fought with an apparition
  unseen, had been slain by it. Impossible. Was there not some reasonable
  explanation? Might it not be that the woman had been self-hypnotized, driven
  half-mad perhaps by her adventurings into the occult, her heritage of
  superstition? That she had imagined the menace approaching from the
  breakwater, imagined his attack, and fighting a creation of her imagining
  died through the collapse of a diseased heart? That was it, of course. She
  had had a weak heart. Ruth remembered her sinking spells, her distress on
  occasions of excitement or stress. That was it! The girl gasped with relief
  grasping reality once more.</p>

  <p>The negress' hands were still clutched at her throat, as they had been in
  her final paroxysm. Ruth reached for them, pulled them gently away.</p>

  <p>An eerie dread closed in on her once more. Livid across the folds of the
  brown skin, a puckered weal ran, and tiny drops of blood oozed where a
  strangling cord had cut deep. Where a noose had cut&mdash;but there was no
  noose! There was no cord&mdash;it had vanished like the garroter who had used
  it. It had vanished&mdash;or never been visible.</p>

  <p>Ruth stared at the telltale mark while horror crawled her spine. No
  phantasm of the mind, no weakness of the heart, had killed Lidy. There was
  the evidence, clear, unmistakable. The woman had been murdered, cruelly
  murdered, by a thing unseen, invisible. By a horror fashioned of the
  moonlight and sea-spume, a slayer visible only to his victim in the final,
  fatal moment...</p>

  <p>A footfall thudded behind Ruth, and a shadow fell across her. The bulking
  shadow of something man-formed, compact of imminent threat, lay on her, and
  on the dead woman, and on the sand beyond. She felt the appalling loom of
  that which cast the shadow towering above her. The shadow's arm moved, and
  something lengthened the silhouetted arm. Something that must be a thick,
  gnarled club. Terror blazed across the girl's mind like a bolt of
  lightning.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; DEATH IS BETTER</h2>

  <p class="first">RUTH cowered, bent over, waiting for the blow to smash down
  on her, crushing her skull, pounding her into oblivion. It did not come. Time
  stretched into infinity, and the club did not fall, and the waiting was more
  dreadful than imminent death. The waiting, and the slow, cold realization
  that it was not death with which she was threatened. Not death...</p>

  <p>Then&mdash;what?...</p>

  <p>The question pronged white-hot fingers into her brain, twisted her around.
  Her staring eyes found columnar, spraddled legs, traveled up to a thick
  torso, to a ridged, outthrust jaw, and baleful, threatening eyes glaring down
  at her. To Jim Horne's eyes! It was Jim Horne who stood over her, clad again
  in dungarees. It was Jim Horne's great arm that hung over her, his raised
  fist clutched about the butt-end of a stout club!</p>

  <p>"Jim!" Ruth heard the name, was aware only after a moment that it had come
  from her own cold lips. "Jim. You."</p>

  <p>His mouth twisted across his colorless face, the only life in that grim
  mask. "You stayed." His voice was a husked growl. "You stayed
  here&mdash;tonight."</p>

  <p>Somehow the girl tottered to her feet. She faced him in white-faced
  silence.</p>

  <p>Horne's club dropped slowly, as though some force outside himself had held
  it aloft, and now was relaxing its grip. Ruth saw that a long shudder was
  racking his great body, that the stony composure of his countenance was
  breaking, that his rough-modeled features were working, were tortured as with
  some obscure, terrific struggle going on within him. His mouth opened,
  closed...</p>

  <p>And suddenly he was shouting at her, "Get in there!" His blunt thumb
  stabbed at the house. "Get inside, quick, and bolt the door. Don't open it
  for anyone. Not even for me. Do you understand? Not even for me."</p>

  <p>"Jim. Why..."</p>

  <p>"Get in there." His club was coming up again, she could see his knuckles
  whiten with the strength of his clutch on it, could see his biceps swelling.
  "For God's sake go, before... <i>Go!"</i></p>

  <p>The impact of his voice whirled her around, hurled her willy-nilly to the
  house door, through it. She slammed the oak leaf shut behind her, rattled a
  sturdy bolt into its socket. Leaned against the wood, whimpering. The echo of
  Jim's thick shout was still in her ears. "Go, before..." Before what? What
  was the emotion, the madness against which he had seemed to fight? Why had
  his weapon been raised over her? Why had he warned her against himself?
  <i>Where had he come from, so silently, so mysteriously, out of
  nothingness?</i></p>

  <p>It was Jim Horne, she remembered William saying, who had found her
  father's dead body. Found it? That club, the heavy club his hand had
  clutched, could smash an old man's head so that it might <i>seem</i> that a
  rock had pulped it... A grisly speculation trailed across the morass of her
  pulsing mind.</p>

  <p>Oh God, what was she thinking? Jim Horne couldn't be a murderer. Not Jim.
  Not the boy with whom she had played along the beach and out on the water.
  Not the youth who had taught her to swim, who had given her her first, clumsy
  kiss...</p>

  <p>But might not some alien being have taken possession of him? Some
  disembodied spirit brought from out of a watery hell by the ghost ship that,
  itself unseen, had darkened the sea's bosom with its uncanny shadow...</p>

  <p>Ruth jumped, whirled around in response to a sudden, sharp sound. Embers
  of the driftwood fire glowed fitfully on the hearth, light shimmering through
  them in glimmering waves... A pine knot must have crackled, burst by the
  dying heat. That was all.</p>

  <p>Ruth's mind flew back to Jim. Her spine prickled to the sensation of a
  gaze upon her, a hostile, inimical gaze. And then fabric slithered against
  fabric, far back in the room's vagueness. Stone grated, and in the obscurity
  under the chartroom table something bulked. Its shadow elongated, a hand came
  out into the light, a taloned <i>yellow</i> hand. It curved, clawed at the
  rug, tugged. A head appeared, high-cheek-boned, slant-eyed, thin lips curled
  over a wide-bladed, cruel knife. Even in that frantic moment Ruth rocked to
  redoubled horror as she saw it was the futile weapon Lidy had wielded...</p>

  <p>The Chinese writhed out from under the table in a single lithe movement,
  was on his feet. His beady eyes went straight to Ruth, he snatched the dagger
  from his mouth, leaped for her. She screamed, hurled herself away from the
  door. Her feet struck the first step of the staircase. She fairly threw
  herself upward, into the weltering, tar-barrel murk to which it rose.
  Slippered feet thudded on the stairs behind her, and her heart pounded
  against its caging ribs, pounded as if it would burst through. She reached
  the upper landing, whirled to the passage.</p>

  <p>The silent pursuer was close behind. Ruth snatched for the knob of her
  mother's door, twisted, flung the door in, slammed it shut behind her, and
  twisted the key in the lock... Just in time. A body thudded against the wood,
  the frail portal shook to the impact.</p>

  <p>The girl whirled to look for something, anything, to shove against the
  door to strengthen it against the attack of the saffron specter that had so
  weirdly appeared to terrify her with a new menace. She saw a dresser, rolled
  it against the portal. Rolled it! It wouldn't be of much use when the lock
  was smashed...</p>

  <p>The bed! The great four-poster would make a barricade. She turned to
  it&mdash;and froze motionless, aghast.</p>

  <p>The bed was empty! There was the imprint of her mother's head on the
  pillow. The tumbled sheets still held the mold of her old body. But she
  wasn't there. She wasn't anywhere in the room. She had vanished, as
  mysteriously, as unaccountably, as Lidy had died; as Jim Horne had come to
  order Ruth back into the house.</p>

  <p>To order her&mdash;not to safety, to the clutches of the Chinese, whose
  knife was scraping now at the wood of the door, slowly, methodically cutting
  away the fibers that held its lock! The steel point came through, sliced
  downward. In minutes the thin panel would give way and he would come in.</p>

  <p>He would come in&mdash;to sink that steel into her quivering flesh. To
  tear at her with his pointed talons! Terror engulfed Ruth&mdash;all the
  eerie, incredible terror of the dreadful night that had turned the home in
  which she was born to a pesthouse of mad menace. Her father, her old servant,
  mysteriously murdered. Her childhood friend, the man who had not been out of
  her thoughts in all the long months of her absence, metamorphosed into an
  avatar of strange threat. An impossible, blood-lusting Oriental impossibly
  materialized into a vacant room, pursuing her with a curious, silent fury.
  Her aged, feeble mother weirdly vanished, and the scrape, scrape of cutting
  steel paring away her own last defense. The doom the black seeress had
  predicted was closing relentlessly in on the helpless girl!</p>

  <p>Mind-shattering, livid fear, voiced at her from the obscurity of the
  moonlit chamber. Fear was a blaze of black fire in her blood, of madness in
  her brain. Her wide, staring eyes flickered to the bed where her mother had
  reposed...</p>

  <p>Then the dark mantle of her terror dropped away, and cold rage replaced
  it. She was no longer a soft, civilized maid. She became a primitive woman,
  fighting for life, for sanity. Fighting for a loved one. She would find out
  where they had taken her mother. She would make the yellow devil tell. And
  then she would wrest their captive from his fellows, if she had to go down to
  Hell itself to find them, if she had to battle every fiend in Hades.</p>

  <p>Ruth crossed to the dresser, pulled out a drawer. Her groping hand touched
  chill metal, came out with a long scissors, the scissors with which her
  mother had laboriously cut out little dresses for her, long ago. Razor-edged
  with many sharpenings, its blades were narrow; their ends, where they joined
  in a point, paper-thin. The girl clutched her weapon, slid around the dresser
  and crouched against the wall beside it...</p>

  <p>A screech of metal against metal sliced through the swirling chaos of her
  brain. The carved-out door-lock fell to the floor. The panel banged inward,
  crashed against the dresser. Something thumped against the portal with a
  meaty thud and the piece of furniture rolled in on its oiled casters. Ruth
  glimpsed an emaciated body in the widening aperture, a ribbed, jaundiced
  torso naked to the waist, crisscrossed by curious, raised lines, its back to
  her, its sharp shoulder against the wood. Then the muscles in her straining
  thighs exploded like unleashed springs, catapulting her at the intruder, the
  scissors in her hand flailing, unsheathed claws of the enraged tigress she
  had become.</p>

  <p>The scissors point struck flesh at the base of the Mongol's neck, met
  gruesome resistance, ripped a jagged gash, came away. The Asiatic whirled,
  his scrawny arm darting up, slicing his knife down at Ruth. Her fingers
  caught the bony wrist in mid-air, halted its lethal swoop.</p>

  <p>In the same instant she felt her own right wrist clutched. She strained to
  get free from the steely grip that held her improvised weapon powerless. She
  tightened her own grasp on the Chinese's arm. The two froze in a ghastly,
  heaving deadlock, their feet planted on the floor, quivering muscles battling
  for mastery. Fetid breath gusted in Ruth's face. Almond eyes glittered
  malevolently at her from deep-sunk sockets. The Mongolian was hairless, and
  his skin so tightly drawn over the bones of his head that it was a skull that
  leered at her, a saffron tinted skull.</p>

  <p>Ruth could see the gash she had made in the Asiatic's shoulder, and though
  it was so deep that the bone showed grayish in the slit, no blood flowed from
  the wound!</p>

  <p>No blood flowed, and no sound came from between the greenish, pointed
  fangs exposed by writhing, fleshless lips. Eerie terror was back, netting
  Ruth's form with an icy, prickling mesh. Terror clawed at her, more poignant
  than the excruciating agony tearing her back and the sinews of her legs and
  arms. Agony pierced her lungs with each labored, hissing breath as the
  strength of her first mad onslaught seeped away and she bent back, ever back
  under the increasing, terrible pressure of her ghastly antagonist.</p>

  <p>She was beaten! She gave way, suddenly, toppling backward. The Chinese's
  own straining effort threw him forward, against Ruth, as the resistance
  against which he fought unexpectedly vanished. A final despairing instinct
  jerked the girl's knees up as she fell, they pounded into the yellow man's
  groin. Even then no sound came from him, but his gaunt features twisted with
  pain, and his grip on Ruth's right wrist relaxed. She twisted it free, drove
  the point of her scissors into the corded, yellow neck.</p>

  <p>The metal sank in, nauseating her with the sliding sough of its stab. Her
  fingers touched skin that was clammy, cold, and the weight lying on her was
  suddenly limp. The deathly chill of it was damp against her nearly nude body.
  Revulsion galvanized her into a last fury of action. She thrust at the
  flaccid corpse, beat her shaking fists against it, until she had forced it
  from her. She rolled away from the horrible cadaver, and lay panting, face
  down on the polished floor. The flooring vibrated beneath her with a
  monotonous rhythm in time to the long, dull boom of the sea. She lifted and
  fell on a weltering tide of dark horror.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," a toneless voice grated from above. "You saved me the trouble
  of disposing of this carrion."</p>

  <p>Ruth looked up. Water splashed into her face, a drop of water, stinging,
  and she stared up into a narrow, grey countenance. In a single frantic flash
  she saw glittering eyes, a hooked nose and pointed chin, a thin-lipped
  Satanic grin. She saw dark, stringy hair wet pasted like clinging seaweed to
  a livid brow, and drenched garments tight on an incredibly thin body, tight
  and shimmering with a ripple of emerald light like moonlight on windless,
  stagnant water. She saw long nailed, curved fingers, dripping water, reaching
  down for her.</p>

  <p>Realization rocketed through her. This was the Master of Horror, the fiend
  come up out of the sea to take her to his dread domain. One reaching claw
  touched her arm, and its touch was a frigid burning, an electric shock that
  galvanized her body, so that she sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>The apparition laughed gloatingly, came toward her with appalling surety
  that she could not escape. He was between her and the door. Ruth whirled, her
  frantic glance found the open window. Death, any clean death, were better
  than capture by this sinister creature. She catapulted to the opening. The
  soles of her bare feet felt the sill as she sprang. She flung herself
  headlong out, and fell toward the silver glimmer of the moonlit sands.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; ON DEAD MAN'S ARM</h2>

  <p class="first">IT seemed to Ruth that the air was viscid, strangely
  buoyant, that her fall to death on the glistening sand was weirdly slow as a
  dive sometimes is from a great height. She did not want to die, terror of
  oblivion suffocated her even as she fell. She was a child of the sea, and in
  her extremity the lessons the sea had taught her flashed to her aid. She
  brought knees up, tucked her arms between them and the soft warmth of her
  body. Made of herself a flaccid bundle dropping down, every muscle relaxed.
  The impact of her landing pounded breath out of her, half-stunned her; but
  her limpness, the shock-absorbers she had made of her limbs, took the blow of
  the landing and no bones were broken.</p>

  <p>She toppled sidewise. Her cheek fell against something, cold, clammy. It
  was the thigh of Lidy's corpse, and a crab scuttled away. Ruth pulled briny
  air into agonized lungs, jerked her head away from the grisly touch of the
  cadaver. Brown-skinned flesh hung in strips where already the
  beach-scavengers had been at their loathly feeding.</p>

  <p>Her glance recoiled from gruesomeness, swung to the wall of the house. She
  saw the somber roughness of the house's stone foundation, the paint-peeled
  frame of a tiny cellar window. A spectral something moved vaguely across the
  black square.</p>

  <p>The girl twisted over and attempted to rise from the sand. She had to get
  up and run over the dunes to the left, over the dunes and away from this
  outpost of hell. If she ran fast enough she could get away, she could get to
  the village where people were, human beings who would take her in, who would
  shelter her against the grisly evil that pursued her. Behind her a hinge
  squealed, and feet thudded on wood of the threshold.</p>

  <p>Ruth sprang erect. A swift, terrified backward glance showed the
  brine-soaked apparition plunging out, the water-devil with the visage of
  Satan. Her heels dug into the sand. And then, in an instant before her
  muscles responded to the frenzied command of her brain, a moving something
  caught her gaze, something moving at the angle where Dead Man's Arm jutted
  out from the shore. It vanished under the trees clothing the cape, but Ruth
  knew what she had seen was the bulking form of William Nore, Lidy's
  son&mdash;and over his shoulders had been the thin, white clad figure of her
  mother.</p>

  <p>She leaped into a frantic, staggering run. She twisted, not to the left,
  where chance of safety lay, but to the right, to the grisly spit whose
  skeleton hand had beckoned the hell ship from the sea. The cape cloaked with
  ominous pines into whose gloom the black man had carried her mother.</p>

  <p>Sand spurted from under the girl's flying feet, and the thud, thud of the
  pursuing fiend pounded after her. The dark thicket flashed nearer, nearer,
  but the sound of the phantom hunter drew up on her. Terror spurred her to
  incredible speed, terror of the foul thing stalking her, of the fate to which
  her mother was being borne. Oh God!&mdash;What fate was it to which the negro
  was bearing the aged woman?</p>

  <p>The pines were closed ahead, their lightless obscurity opening to swallow
  her. And then, suddenly Jim Horne came running from behind the house to
  intercept her, his club upraised. "Ruth!" he called. "Ruth&mdash;stop..."</p>

  <p>She did not hear the rest; a final, desperate leap had launched her into
  the blackness of the pine thicket, and as it swallowed her it blotted out the
  sound of pursuit, of the two grim antagonists who had joined forces for her
  destruction.</p>

  <p>Ruth plunged through underbrush that tore her flesh, that whipped stinging
  lashes across her face and body. Brambles caught her nightdress, ripped the
  filmy stuff from her, so that only a few shreds remained to flutter about her
  flanks, her breasts. She was following the vague sound of a huge body
  threshing through the thicket ahead; she was fleeing from the servants of
  evil who hurtled after her.</p>

  <p>Once she heard Jim's voice, distance-muffled, shouting: "Ruth! Wait..."
  Calling to her as if he thought she was still blind to his betrayal, to his
  oneness with the fiends evolved from the sea and the moon's lifeless beams.
  Once she heard a scream from far ahead, a thin, quavering scream that could
  come only from the throat of her mother. Panic swept her at that
  sound&mdash;and was followed by despair. And then there were no more sounds
  except those she made herself, crashing through the thicket. That, and the
  unceasing mutter of the ocean, unseen but close now on either hand...</p>

  <p>It seemed that she ran forever, fighting the battering of the dark woods
  that were in league with her enemies; fighting the weariness that tugged at
  her muscles, the pain that was a garment for her naked body. She was a wild,
  mad creature hurtling through an unreal, cruel purgatory...</p>

  <p>Light glimmered through the tree-trunks before her, a vine caught her
  ankles. She staggered, the impetus of her headlong flight carrying her out
  into a clearing. She pitched to her knees. Stayed there, moaning, not feeling
  pain any longer, feeling nothing but a renewed burst of horror within her as
  she stared at something that swayed back and forth, penduluming against the
  yellow round of the full moon, which rode high now in a lowering sky.</p>

  <p>It was a body, it was a woman's body, swinging at the end of a rope, and
  that rope hung down, straight down from the yardarm of a mast. There were
  other masts, their yards thickened by furled canvas, their rigging a tangle
  of black meshing the lunar glow. They sprang from a long, low keel; a black
  keel that slowly rose and fell on the oily heave of an unreal sea. A sea that
  shimmered greenly like the shimmer of the garments the fiend wore, who was
  the captain of the schooner from hell at which she gazed.</p>

  <p>Ruth Adair's body twitched and a great wave of terror-spawned hysteria
  suddenly shook it. Abruptly the girl burst into loud, crazed laughter. Her
  hold on reason slipped, and an illusory clairvoyance seemed now to reveal the
  sinister plan of her persecutors. They had played with her. They had let her
  go, not bothering to overtake her. Of course they had let her go, she was
  going just where they wanted her to go&mdash;to the landing place of their
  ship, of their schooner from Hades. How they must have laughed, watching her
  struggle through the woods, watching her running. She could laugh with them.
  It was funny. Oh how funny it was.</p>

  <p>And the funniest of all was that they had used the phantom of her mother
  to lure her on. The <i>phantom</i> of her mother!</p>

  <p>Suddenly the girl's mad laughter ceased. They were coming for her now. A
  splash in the water was followed by a shadow jutting out from the penumbra of
  the hellship's keel, and a longboat was riding the water, its oars skimming
  the waves, dipping and skimming again, like a monstrous water-spider
  scuttling toward her. It was a spider, and she the fly, and there was no
  escape for her. She no longer wanted to escape. She wanted them to take her
  aboard the schooner. She wanted to see her body hang from the other end of
  that yardarm. And then she would take the spokes of the wheel and steer the
  vessel back to hell. She knew how to steer, Jim Horne had taught her how to
  steer. She would sing as they sailed, and Jim would be on the bridge too. Jim
  Horne, Captain Satan's first mate. And then she saw that Jim was standing
  above her.</p>

  <p>"Jim," she said to him. "Jim, I will steer the ship for you." It was not
  strange that he was here in the clearing, that he was bending down to her,
  not strange at all. "When we get to hell Satan will wed us." She could say it
  now that they were both dead. She couldn't say it in life. She could only
  mouth bitter words at him, words bitter because he would not love her as she
  had always loved him. "And then because of our love hell will be heaven."</p>

  <p>Then a form came up out of a dark rock pile behind Jim. His grey face was
  furious, and he bounded toward Jim, a rock upraised in his taloned hand.
  "Jim!" the girl screamed. "Behind you!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; GRISLY CARGO</h2>

  <p class="first">HORNE whirled, grating an oath. The stone flew at him,
  bounced off his shoulder. His leap carried him yards across the clearing, his
  fist slapped into Satan's face. There was a squashing sound, and that gaunt
  visage was splotched with red. Then two forms were locked in a snarling,
  growling combat, and Ruth was aghast as the madness died within her and she
  was aware that Jim Horne was fighting for her, had all through the ghastly
  night been fighting to protect her.</p>

  <p>The girl staggered to her feet. Against any human antagonist Jim could
  hold his own. But was it a human being he was fighting? And even if it were,
  even if Jim could defeat him, his confederates were coming from the
  black-hulled schooner, were coming fast in the longboat that skimmed the
  water under the drive of powerful oars.</p>

  <p>Ruth twisted around. The dory was very close, and she could see its
  occupants, their swinging backs, their white fists tugging at the oar
  handles. She could see that there were others in the boat who were not
  rowing, bent forms squatting between the thwarts. Now a hand lifted and she
  caught the glint of metal on a yellow wrist, could hear the clank of
  chains.</p>

  <p>Oh God! What was this grisly small craft oaring in, who were the chained
  beings that made its living cargo? The terror of the night closed in again on
  her. The keel of the rowboat grated on rock, the bow oarsman turned. It was
  the negro, William Nore!</p>

  <p>Ruth whirled again, just in time to see Jim's great arms lift the
  struggling, writhing, reptilian form of his opponent high in the air, to see
  Jim pound him crashing down. "Jim," she screamed. "Watch out! The
  others..."</p>

  <p>Jim came around, a scarlet weal across his cheek, his mouth awry. "It's
  all right, Ruth. It's all right. They're friends."</p>

  <p>He was striding toward her, was tearing the straps of his overalls from
  his shoulders, and stripping the dungarees down. He stopped to pull them off.
  "Put these on, darling." He tossed them to her.</p>

  <p>The girl caught the garment, started toward the curtaining shrubbery. But
  a cry halted her, a thin, piping cry from the longboat. "Ruth. Ruth. Are you
  all right?"</p>

  <p>She turned. Her mother was standing up, her old arms outstretched. Her
  mother!&mdash;But the woman's form still hung, a ghastly pendulum swinging
  against the moon.</p>

  <h3>*</h3>

  <p>The blaze from the driftwood fire on the hearth in the living room of the
  old Adair house reached high between the age-blackened rafters of its low
  ceiling, driving away the shadows. "Jim," Ruth said. "I can't understand any
  of it. Did I dream it all?"</p>

  <p>Horne turned from the fire, looked moodily at her. "No. It wasn't a dream.
  I&mdash;I hate to explain it, but I suppose I'll have to... Look, Ruth, you
  didn't realize how little your father really had when you wrote him for more
  money. He couldn't deny you. And when William Nore came to him with a
  proposition that they handle live contraband, he said yes, even though it
  must have gone against his grain."</p>

  <p>"Live contraband?"</p>

  <p>"Chinese, smuggled into the country to evade the law. Cap'n Eli didn't
  realize what he was letting himself in for. The men in that trade aren't
  human, they're fiends. And this particular crew was the worst of the lot.</p>

  <p>"The government realized the Chinks were coming in somewhere along this
  coast. They couldn't send strangers in, and I was appointed an undercover
  agent, to try and stop it. Otis Blake was selected to help me, and we were
  thunderstruck when we discovered that the smugglers were landing their living
  merchandise on Dead Man's Arm.</p>

  <p>"It still didn't occur to us that Cap'n Eli was mixed up in the thing,
  though we did suspect the negro. However, we couldn't make out how they were
  being taken away from the spit. From out at sea we could see only that they
  were being taken into the pines, and they weren't there in the morning. Otis
  volunteered to hide out there, spy on them. The next day he didn't show
  up&mdash;poor fellow, we found his body on the skeleton hand, his throat
  cut.</p>

  <p>"Lidy started a lot of talk about the devil haunting the cape. A lot of
  damned fools in the village believed her.</p>

  <p>"This was last week. I kept snooping around&mdash;and found out that a
  tunnel had been dug from the woods, along behind the breakwater, then into
  the cellar of this house. I came to Cap'n Eli with my discovery&mdash;and he
  told me he knew all about it, that he was in on the thing. He showed me a
  trapdoor under the table, that had been arranged for the Chinks to be brought
  up and out of if the cellar exit out back were being watched.</p>

  <p>"Ruth! I couldn't arrest your father. I gave him a chance to get out of
  it. He promised me that he would tell the gang he was quitting. He did tell
  them&mdash;I imagine that was the reason they bashed his head in with a rock,
  out there.</p>

  <p>"This morning I got word from our operative in Halifax that a shipment was
  going out, and I knew they would be landed tonight. With your father gone, I
  didn't hesitate to have a Coast Guard boat sent down here, had it waiting
  down the coast, hidden in a cove. I tried to warn you..."</p>

  <p>"Lidy tried to warn me too. She must have sensed something coming, and she
  tried to frighten me away with her talk of a hell ship sailing a moon path on
  the water."</p>

  <p>"I've seen that eerie effect myself. When the schooner came in the other
  side of the point the just rising moon threw its shadow on the cove out
  here... Well, I was out behind the house, signaling the coast guard launch
  when I heard Lidy yelling her defiance of the devil&mdash;perhaps that was to
  frighten you some more, drive you away, perhaps her mind had really given way
  and she believed the story she had herself invented. At any rate, there was a
  Chinese in the cellar who was left from the last shipment. He hadn't paid his
  passage and the devils had been torturing him to get even. The window was too
  small for him to get out, but when he saw Lidy's knife, he wanted it. He
  unraveled an old net down there, made a noose which he flipped out through
  it, got it around her neck. He had a long pole by which he fished the knife
  in, and somehow he managed to get the strangling cord loose and pull that
  back in too. He started working at the fastenings of the trapdoor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And got through just in time to attack me," said Ruth, shuddering.</p>

  <p>"The poor fellow thought you were one of his tormentors, was wild for
  revenge. In the meantime William Nore, who had never really gone to the
  village, had looked out and seen his dead mother. He thought that had been
  done by the smugglers, scuttled up the backstairs to warn you and your
  mother. You were not in your room. Again he thought the contraband runners
  were responsible, he went to your mother. Warning her to be silent he carried
  her out and down the way he had come. I saw him coming out with her, and by
  that time had gotten a message that the ship was captured but that Grange,
  the leader of the gang, had dived overboard and gotten away. I thought that
  perhaps Grange might make for the house, that the safest place was the ship,
  sent Nore out there... started around to look for you. As I came out from the
  corner of the house I saw you running, and Grange after you. I threw my club
  at him, he dodged it, made the woods. Then I lost him in the underbrush...
  You know the rest."</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;who was the woman they hung?"</p>

  <p>"Our operative in Halifax. They discovered she was a spy, took her along
  and killed her when they landed here, just before the coast guard boat came
  into sight. They were too late to save her."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the poor girl!" Ruth blinked away tears.</p>

  <p>"Ruth." The new authority was suddenly gone from Jim, he was again gawky,
  awkward. "Ruth. I&mdash;I want to ask you something."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" A pulse beat in her wrists, and suddenly she too was very
  shy.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you said out there&mdash;hell would be heaven because of our
  love. You&mdash;didn't mean that&mdash;you..." He bogged down.</p>

  <p>"I meant that I love you," she said, and then she was in his arms. "Oh my
  dear, with all my heart and soul." Hot lips were crushed against hers...
  After awhile she pulled away, smiled tremulously. "This isn't hell, Jim," she
  whispered. "But that was a good imitation of heaven."</p>
