  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; DARK HALLWAYS</h2>

  <p class="first">JUNE FORSYTHE'S hand flew to her throat as though to stifle
  the scream that rose in it&mdash;the scream that, if given utterance, would
  betray her to the unknown horror that lurked in that ancient corridor. She
  stood stock-still, horribly unable to move as she listened to the grisly,
  scraping sounds that came from out of the eerie shadows ahead&mdash;the
  shadows through which she must pass.</p>

  <p>The sounds were tiny sounds, such as might have been made by the scrape of
  claws on wood, the rubbing of a furry form against the rotting, mildewed
  plaster. From each of the many doorways let into the walls of this
  high-ceilinged passageway the sounds had come at intervals. Each doorway was
  a pocket of ominous blackness, and in each pocket sly horror lurked.</p>

  <p>June's white lips moved in a soundless prayer for light. If only she
  possessed even a candle, she might be able to drive back the things that
  waited out there, but in the sprawling expanse of this rotting, deserted old
  office building there was no light of any kind, or any means of obtaining
  one. There was nothing at all but reverberant emptiness, hollowly, faintly
  echoing the city's roar that seeped vaguely through the thick old walls.
  Nothing but the dank fetor of a dead structure that had once been
  overwhelmingly alive... Nothing but the whispering scamper of the vileness
  its death had spawned.</p>

  <p>But she couldn't stay here forever like this, rigid in the numbing grip of
  fear. The things that awaited her must be met, eventually&mdash;and they
  would not wait indefinitely. They would creep upon her, if she delayed too
  long, emboldened by her stillness&mdash;they would leap at her...</p>

  <p>The girl drew a long quivering breath and dashed forward. Small, loathsome
  creatures squealed and scattered before the reckless impetuosity of her
  flight. One sleek gray beast, larger than the rest, did not flee. It
  crouched, and bared white fangs that gleamed in the darkness. Before it could
  spring, June's slim shoe struck it. There was a crunch of a small, snapped
  spine, the feel of a crushed body. June whimpered as nausea swept over her,
  and fled on down the hall on trembling limbs.</p>

  <p>The patter of her rushing footfalls echoed and reechoed through the
  brooding silence. She snatched at a verdigrised doorknob. Sheer momentum
  almost tore her grasp from it. She held, and it swung her around to face tall
  double-doors of time-darkened oak, deeply set back in an arched embrasure.
  She opened the door and went it.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Miss Gordon," a voice greeted her.</p>

  <p>June stood with her back against the door and shuddered. Hand to heaving
  breast she fought for breath, for control of her nerves. But Jeffery van
  Gandt had not looked up from the chaotic litter on the table he used as a
  desk. "I hope your dreams were pleasant ones." It was his customary greeting,
  spoken in deep-throated, mellow tones.</p>

  <p>The grime on the huge window behind him could not keep out the blaze of
  the morning sun, so that van Gandt's body was detailless, a black silhouette
  against the glare. A silhouette such as might have been cast by a beau of the
  last century. For he wore a broad-brimmed grey top-hat on his finely modelled
  head, and a high, wing collar and big-knotted cravat added their bits to his
  old-fashioned outline.</p>

  <p>"I won't come here any more!" June sobbed. "I won't!... They'll drive me
  mad!"</p>

  <p>Van Gandt's look was mildly questioning. "What have your dreams, mad or
  otherwise, to do with your working for me?"</p>

  <p>Hysteria was plucking at the girl's nerves, pulsing in her throat.
  "Dreams? Not dreams! Rats! The place is alive with them. Crawling with
  them!"</p>

  <p>"Rats?" The man seemed puzzled. "Of course there are rats." He rose, came
  forward. He was very tall, and where the hair showed from under his
  anachronistic headgear it was quite white. But his clean-shaven face was
  fresh-complexioned, unwrinkled; and his figure slender, lithe within his grey
  frock coat, double-breasted vest, and tight pantaloons.</p>

  <p>He peered nearsightedly at the girl. "My child," he exclaimed, suddenly
  solicitous. "You are pale. You stare so. You&mdash;you are frightened." He
  laid a long, sensitive hand on her arm, gently.</p>

  <p>"Frightened! I'm terrified!" But even as she said it her terror seemed to
  be oozing away, almost as if that hand on her arm were driving off the
  fear.</p>

  <p>"Yes." His tone was musing, thoughtful. "Yes, I see that you are
  frightened... of rats." He hesitated, seemed to ponder. His hand fell
  away.</p>

  <p>Mechanically June removed her hat, her trim suit-coat, got crisp paper
  from the drawer of her own small desk that she might fold and clip it for
  cuffs. The accustomed routine was bringing her back to normal, but within she
  was still trembling.</p>

  <p>"Are others as afraid of rats as you?" There was an oddly eager light in
  the bleared grey of van Gandt's eyes.</p>

  <p>"All women fear them. Terribly. They're so&mdash;so terribly cruel." She
  could not repress the long shudder that ran through her delicately molded
  body.</p>

  <p>"And men?"</p>

  <p>"And men too, I think. I made Dan admit that he did, once.
  Before&mdash;before..." She caught herself. That was a slip. Van Gandt
  mustn't know that she had been married. But she had to blink back the tears
  that the thought of her stalwart husband still brought to her eyes.</p>

  <p>It had been two years since that single, despairing radio call had come
  out of the sea's grey mystery: "Help! Help! Oh God, help us!"&mdash;but these
  two years had not availed to heal the hurt of her great loss. She had had him
  for so short a time, and then he had sailed away on the Marietta, and the
  secret of the ship's vanishing had never been solved. There had been no hint
  as to her fate except a tramp steamer's report of a red flare on the horizon,
  just about where the doomed vessel might have been.</p>

  <p>Van Gandt went back to his table. Somehow his footfalls made no sound on
  the splintered, bare floor. "Rats," he murmured musingly as he collected a
  number of white papers covered with minuscule writing and tapped them into a
  neat pile. "I must make a note of that."</p>

  <p>June Forsythe bustled busily at her own place, but from the corners of her
  eyes she watched her employer open a small and battered safe that stood under
  the broad sill of the window, watched him place the mass of papers within.
  Her pulse pounded sharply as she glimpsed the safe's shadowed interior. The
  grey back of an account book, inside, was splotched with red ink.</p>

  <p>Van Gandt swung the iron door closed, twirled the combination dial. He did
  that every morning, right after she came in, and always there were more white
  sheets in the mass than there had been the morning before. He must write all
  night, June thought, by the light of his green-shaded oil lamp. What was it
  that he wrote, that he must guard it so carefully?</p>

  <p>She inserted paper into her shiny typewriter. For the three days since she
  had answered van Gandt's ad she had copied long columns of names and figures
  from dusty, time-yellowed ledgers. The pages of the ancient books crumbled as
  she turned them, sent little spurts of dust up into her face. June shivered a
  little&mdash;not with the cold and dampness that pervaded this place with
  the atmosphere of a tomb&mdash;with dread. With the creeping, almost tangible
  dread that seemed the only really live thing in this place. But stronger than
  that was the hate burning like a cold flame within her to temper the
  steel-hard determination with which she faced the grisly menace of the
  rat-infested passageways.</p>

  <p>Suddenly van Gandt's voice came from beside her. "I will return shortly,"
  he said. He moved like a wraith, this man, like an immaterial phantom!
  "Continue with your work."</p>

  <p>He was going out! He was leaving her here alone! June fought to keep her
  elation from showing in her face. Her chance had come so soon! She watched
  the great door shut behind his tall, out-of-date figure. And then she leaped
  to her feet, panic surging through her brain, as a metallic click came
  sharply from that door!</p>

  <p>She was at the door, was tugging at its knob. It refused to move.
  Appallingly it refused to move! He had locked her in! Good Lord! He had
  locked her in with...</p>

  <p>With what?</p>

  <p>The girl twisted about to face the room. Her apprehensive glance swept its
  expanse, probed its every inch. There were her desk, his, the safe behind it,
  the window, darkening already with the shadow of the skyscraper whose
  towering, windowless wall it faced. There was the other long table to the
  right, with its row of cane-bottomed chairs. There was the closet door in the
  wall on the left, the door that she had never seen opened. And there was
  nothing else. No one else. Whence, then, came the feeling of another
  presence, the spine-chilling sensation of eyes, of inimical, hostile eyes,
  glaring at her?</p>

  <p>June flattened herself against the door, as if she were trying to force
  herself through the very wood and thus escape from this dreadful chamber. She
  was afraid, with a fear the more hideous for its being seemingly baseless. It
  clutched her throat with icy fingers, shook her quivering body in a palsy of
  terror.</p>

  <p>There was nothing of which to be afraid. Nothing. She said it over and
  over to a tight brain that would not listen. There was no one in the office
  with her. Van Gandt did not suspect her&mdash;could not possibly suspect her.
  He had locked the door unthinkingly, through habit. It was only three days
  after all, that she had been with him; before that he had always had to lock
  the door when he went out.</p>

  <p>Even through that door's thick wood the rat noises came in from the
  corridor, their scamperings, their little squeals. They seemed to be
  gathering around the threshold, to be waiting for her. Even if she could she
  would not dare go out there!</p>

  <p>She was alone in the rambling, ten-story structure. Utterly alone. The
  building, long ago, had been scheduled to be torn down to make way for just
  such a skyscraper as the two between which it cowered. The other tenants had
  been evacuated, electricity, telephones, had been cut off. Van Gandt had
  delayed, loath to quit the second-floor office where his whole working life
  had been spent. The prospective builders had humored him. And then the
  fateful October ninth of 'Twenty-nine had swooped down upon them and the
  project had been abandoned. He had stayed on ever since, rent free,
  undisturbed, and alone.</p>

  <p>June shook herself angrily. She must get her nerves under control. She was
  not in danger. Nothing threatened her, nothing could possibly harm her. If
  she could not get out of the office, neither could anyone get in.</p>

  <p>The pounding of her heart eased. She pushed herself away from the door.
  She was wasting time. Van Gandt might be back before...</p>

  <p>Wood scraped on wood, loudly! Right here! Right in the office with
  her&mdash;</p>

  <p>June froze.</p>

  <p>Oh God! The heavy window was moving slowly upward. Through the coating of
  dirt that made its glass translucent the terrified girl could see a huge,
  shapeless bulk, and fingers jogged the lower edge of the dirt-drab sash.
  Mother in Heaven! Those fingers were black, were shaggy with coarse hair! And
  the way they grasped the wood was weirdly, blood-chillingly unhuman.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE MAN WHO SCREAMED</h2>

  <p class="first">A SCREAM grew in June's chest, seared upward, died at her
  pallid lips in a choked rasp. The strength drained out of her legs so it
  seemed in the next moment she must crumple to the floor. There was infinite
  threat in the window's slow movement, in the way the hand, leathery and
  black, snaked in, closed in a strained clutch on the sill-edge. The other
  hand shifted. The sash squealed as it moved rapidly in its groove.</p>

  <p>That sound released the girl from the fear-paralysis that held her. There
  was only one hiding place for her, only one possible sanctuary. She darted
  across the room to the closet door, jerked at it, gasped with quick relief as
  it opened. Quickly she sprang into the yawning darkness and slammed the door
  between her and terror.</p>

  <p>A silent sob shook her. There was no way to bar this door. No way at all.
  If the prowler found her here she was trapped, hopelessly trapped. Out there
  she might at least have dodged him for a while, might have snatched up some
  impromptu weapon, might have gotten to the open window and screamed. Here she
  was completely helpless. What a fool she had been!</p>

  <p>There was a dull thud on the floor. He was in the room, then... It was in
  the room! No man possessed a hand like that. No man could climb twenty sheer
  feet of brick wall to reach that window. Some impossible monster was out
  there in the office. Some Thing of faceless horror moved about in there,
  snuffling, thudding blindly against the room's furnishings, searching,
  searching...</p>

  <p>The sounds of movement stopped! What was he doing? Was he crouching before
  this frail panel that was the only thing between them? Was he reaching a
  dreadful hand, black and shaggy with coarse hair, to twist its knob? To
  twist, momentarily afterward, her neck? In fancy June could feel thick,
  spatulate, savage fingers closing on her throat...</p>

  <p>Something cold struck her cheek, something cold and damp! A heavy
  something bumped flaccidly against her, from behind! June twisted about in
  the utter dark, flailed out insanely with her small fists. Clammy flesh
  soughed under the impact of her blows, a cold hand caught at her wrist,
  missed its mark.</p>

  <p>The girl whirled again, clawed at the closet door. Nothing could be worse
  than this horror in the dark. The barrier gave way, she fell through,
  sprawling out face down across the office floor.</p>

  <p>A guttural snarl came from the direction of van Gandt's table. Through the
  space under it she saw a dark, hunching, ungainly figure. It had beady, feral
  eyes that stared at her behind a mop of shaggy hair.</p>

  <p>Thick, bestial lips drew back from yellow fangs. The awful face moved,
  came towards her. Terror exploded in June's brain, blinded and deafened her.
  She was dizzy in a whirlpool of swirling blackness. "June! June!" Dan's voice
  called to her from beyond his watery grave. She slid down and down into
  merciful oblivion...</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">HANDS tore at her. June beat weakly at her attacker, kept
  her eyes tight shut, knowing that sight of him must drive her surely mad.</p>

  <p>"No," she moaned. "No"</p>

  <p>"Wake up, child," Jeffery van Gandt's voice said. "Wake up." Liquid
  coolness splashed against her lips. He was holding a glass of water to her
  mouth and his eyes were anxious. "What happened to you?"</p>

  <p>The water was grateful to the girl's parched throat. She gulped it down,
  pushed herself up in a sitting posture, looked fearfully around.
  "Where&mdash;where is he?" she quavered.</p>

  <p>"Where is who?" Fine wrinkles sprayed from the corners of van Gandt's eyes
  and his lids narrowed. June saw that they two were alone in the office.
  Nothing appeared disturbed and the closet door was closed. "When I opened the
  door there was no one here but you&mdash;on the floor, in a dead faint."
  Something flickered, evasively, behind the bland veil of his aquiline
  face.</p>

  <p>June got slowly to her feet. Now she could see that the window, also, was
  tight shut. She ran unsteady fingers through her close-cut boyish hair,
  straightening as best she could its unruly tangle of tight brown curls.
  Thought slid through her mind like a blurring cinema film. She came to a
  decision.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I felt ill," she said slowly, "and dizzy. I had an impression
  that someone came into the room, but it must have been an illusion." She
  forced a smile, a toss of the head. "I don't know why it should have happened
  to me unless it's because of the scare the rats gave me. This is the first
  time in my life that I have fainted."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you ought to go home now, rest up. There is no hurry about the
  work you are doing, you know."</p>

  <p>"No, thank you. I shall stay. I am quite all right. There is no need of my
  going home." If she could. If she only could! But there was her promise to
  Dan's memory. There was the oath she had sworn to his picture on that
  dreadful night when she had found the entry in his diary and at last had
  given up hope.</p>

  <p>June imagined that the spirit of the old building resented the tapping of
  her typewriter. After so many long years of bustle the place was weary,
  longed for sleep. And now she was waking it with vibrant challenge... June
  bit her lip. These were mad thoughts crawling through her brain! She must
  stop them&mdash;stop them!</p>

  <p>"SS. Holden Hall," she wrote, heading a new sheet. "From La Guiara 15
  April, 1896." This one had carried hides that voyage and its hold must have
  been alive with rats. The Marietta had carried hides, too, down into the
  limbo of oblivion. Had the rats poured up on deck in the final, awful moment?
  Had they attacked the crew in their frenzy, attacked Dan&mdash;? Oh God!</p>

  <p>White teeth bit into the girl's lower lip. Steady, June, steady. Enough
  that those pictures, those visions, trail through your dreams at night, and
  wake you, screaming, to lie awake through the awful hours. Go on with your
  work. Go on!</p>

  <p>"Puerto Cabello, 15 April, no cargo," she copied the next entry. Then she
  turned the ledger page, began again. And a frigid chill ran through her. "21
  July, 1897," she wrote. "Received from Marine Underwriters Ltd. $45,000 in
  settlement of all claims for loss of ship and cargo."</p>

  <p>Good Lord! Had it begun so long ago? So... long... ago!</p>

  <p>Van Gandt seemed almost asleep in his chair, he was so quiet, so
  motionless. But his eyes were fixed on her, speculatively. The nape of the
  girl's neck bristled and her breath came a little faster. Someone fumbled
  furtively at the door behind her!</p>

  <p>Before June could turn, another sound came into the room's quiet, a
  queerly muffled thump against the panel. Again. There was a weird combination
  of timorousness and insistence about the furtive rap, as though he who was
  asking admittance were terrified at the thought of what awaited him, yet
  wanted to get the inevitable over and done with. An answering apprehension
  stirred in the girl's bosom as she rose and moved toward the entrance.
  Obscurely she sensed that she was threatened by the same influence that the
  visitor seemed to dread. She opened the door hesitantly.</p>

  <p>"Mr. van Gandt iss in?"</p>

  <p>June stared, momentarily speechless. Coming from the man-mountain who
  bulked in the doorway, the thin piping voice was weirdly incongruous. The
  face that hung before her was like a full moon of hairless pink flesh in
  whose rounded contours a tiny mouth pursed. Pendulous fat rolls concealed the
  neck and lay quivering on the outcurve of a clothed balloon that was his
  chest and unbelievably bloated abdomen.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the girl managed to gasp. "Who is it?"</p>

  <p>The caller sucked in breath, simpering. "Karl Potten, please." At the end
  of one columnar arm a hand like half-shaped dough clutched an umbrella by the
  middle. "I can see Herr van Gandt? Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," June repeated, parrotlike. "I suppose so." But she did not move
  aside to permit his entrance.</p>

  <p>His hat was in his other hand and he was completely bald. A cold shiver so
  shook the girl that she could barely conceal it. Her fascinated gaze sought
  his eyes, tiny beads almost lost in the billowing expanse of his cheeks.
  Behind their china-blue hardness she sensed a soul in torment.</p>

  <p>"Karl!" Startlingly van Gandt's voice was right behind her. "Come in, man.
  Come in."</p>

  <p>Her employer had the visitor by the arm, as much of it as his long fingers
  could encompass. "It has been a long time since last we met," he went on, his
  mellow accents warm, cordial. The two, contrasting so sharply that their
  juxtaposition was grotesque, moved across the long room. Van Gandt's progress
  was as eerily soundless as usual, but Potten's great weight brought his feet
  down with a peculiarly distinctive sound: pud, pud, pud...</p>

  <p>Van Gant pulled a second chair over to his desk. Potten lowered himself to
  it gingerly, as though expecting it to collapse, and June caught herself
  holding her breath in expectation of the same catastrophe.</p>

  <p>"Miss Gordon," van Gandt said. "Will you take your lunch now, please?"</p>

  <p>June realized that he was demanding privacy for the interview with Potten.
  "Very well," she murmured, and turned to the rack holding her street
  clothes.</p>

  <p>She went out into the gloomy, rat-infested corridor. Her heels clicked as
  she broke into a run down the hall. Van Gandt would expect her to run through
  the menace of the rodents...</p>

  <p>The girl ran the length of the corridor, then she turned about and
  tip-toed back to the door she had just left. She pressed up against it, her
  ear close against its rough surface. Behind her the grisly small creatures
  seemed to her to make a semi-circular ring of red-eyed threat, a ring that
  slowly, implacably closed in upon her.</p>

  <p>But the girl, shivering with fear though she was, stuck to her post.</p>

  <p>Karl Potten's piping voice came clearly through the wood. "Name your
  price, Cheffery, und I vill pay it. Udderwise..." He broke off. Somehow June
  could guess at the gesture that accompanied that pause. He would have made it
  with the ponderous arm that held the umbrella, and it would not have been
  pleasant.</p>

  <p>Van Gandt's insouciant answer seemed quite irrelevant. "You and I are old,
  Karl," he said. "Old enough to be afraid of death." The eavesdropper pictured
  his slow cold smile. "It is not the young who fear death, it is easy to
  recruit armies, hazardous expeditions, from among them. But naturally enough,
  as a man approaches nearer and nearer his inevitable dissolution, his fear of
  that inescapable end grows greater and more insupportable. It makes a
  groveling, superstitious coward of him, Karl, a spineless creature ready to
  bribe God or the Devil for a few more days, a few more hours. Life becomes a
  torture to him because of the terror of oblivion that gnaws at his brain, and
  claws at his entrails, and clots in his hardening veins, yet he will not let
  it go."</p>

  <p>"Vot are you talking aboudt?" The other's voice thickened with the fear
  that was in him. "Vy do you say dot?"</p>

  <p>"Because, my old friend, in the next few seconds one of us will be
  released from that fear." The words dripped slowly into an aghast silence, as
  honey drips from a broken comb. And a threat buzzed in it as robbed insects
  buzz angry threat. "Released from fear by the thing he fears. By death!"</p>

  <p>"Very well," Karl Potten responded, a new grimness in his thin voice. "If
  dot iss the way you want it..."</p>

  <p>Momentarily there was no further sound within there. No sound at all. But
  June knew that in that room horror grew like a bubble, grew, grew, till its
  walls were too thin to hold longer&mdash;</p>

  <p>There was a scream that was a thin sound of uttermost agony. It wavered,
  faded, rose again to insupportable intensity, thickened and spread into an
  obscure burbling... ended with an awful finality. Ended&mdash;but echoed
  still in June's ears, in her reeling brain...</p>

  <p>Someone moved on the other side of the door. Someone turned its knob. The
  girl crushed herself against the side of the embrasure. The great wooden leaf
  swung outward, hiding her from whoever was coming out of that chamber where a
  man had screamed&mdash;and hiding him from her...</p>

  <p>Who was it that rushed away down that long corridor and vanished beyond a
  further curve?</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; HORROR'S PRISONER</h2>

  <p class="first">JUNE FORSYTHE licked her parched lips as she crouched in the
  triangular space between the open door and the narrow wall of the archway
  within which it was sunk. Silence beat dully against her ears. Even the rats
  seemed silenced by horror, even the senile groans of the ancient structure
  seemed stilled. June Forsythe recoiled in every atom of her being from the
  thought of entering the room where death lurked&mdash;and knew that she must
  do so.</p>

  <p>It was her chance, the chance she had waited for. Once before the
  opportunity had been offered her and had been snatched away. She must not
  fail her husband, her lover this time. She must not fail.</p>

  <p>Shadows blurred the corners of the soundless office. Beyond the table van
  Gandt used as a desk something was on the floor, something that had not been
  there before. From where she stood, in the doorway, June could not see what
  it was. But, of course, she knew what it was. Dreadfully, she knew. Only its
  identity was unknown to her.</p>

  <p>A viscous, unseen fluid seemed to cling to her legs, so that she had to
  force her way through it, slowly. The journey across the room was
  interminable. Was it from van Gandt she had learned the trick of moving so
  that her shoes made no sound on the uncarpeted floor? Or was she dreaming
  this? Was it part of the nightmare she had lived since Dan had left her?</p>

  <p>She reached the desk. She swayed, rested one hand on its paper-littered
  top to steady herself. She moved around the table towards the end where was
  the chair, now empty, upon which Karl Potten had sat.</p>

  <p>Breath hissed from between her teeth. The mound on the floor was like a
  deflated balloon. The hat was still clutched in one hand, the umbrella in the
  other. June held on to the table and stared at it, and the gray-white head
  seemed to her like that of some noisome slug, mysteriously grown
  enormous.</p>

  <p>The black, decent clothing of that gross corpse was hardly disarrayed. The
  body lay almost as if it were asleep&mdash;except that its head was
  grotesquely twisted to the left, and that there were blue blotches on the
  fat-drowned neck, blue blotches that were bruises made by brutal, murderous
  fingers.</p>

  <p>As a deep cut by a clean blade is its own anesthetic, so excess of horror
  lost its power to shock the girl. She gazed almost calmly at the thing lying
  there, and wondered that there had been strength enough in van Gandt's
  fingers to have done this thing.</p>

  <p>Wind from the opened window rustled papers, and June jumped. Her eyes went
  to the safe from whose iron the paint had peeled, but on whose front faint
  gold letters still were legible: "J. van Gandt and Partners. Shipping." She
  would, she saw, have to touch that which had been Karl Potten not so long
  ago. It lay so that she would have to climb over it to reach that safe. She
  could not hope to move it.</p>

  <p>The cadaver was still warm, still soft. She slipped. Her knee sank into
  its mass and it seemed to move under the pressure. Panic seized June again,
  stopping her breath, clutching her heart. She had to put her hand on the
  massive face to push herself over. The damp clamminess sucked at her fingers,
  engulfing them. Hysteria gibbered in her skull.</p>

  <p>"Dan," she whispered. "Dan." The softly repeated name took hold of her
  like tender hands&mdash;quieted her. She knelt in front of the antique strong
  box. She had prepared for this moment, knew just what to do, knew that in
  minutes the iron door would swing open for her. She was trembling again, but
  not with fear.</p>

  <p>June got her ear against the cold metal, just above the dull nickel of the
  combination-dial. This brought her around so that she had to look at the
  corpse and she shut her eyes against the gruesome vision. Her hand closed on
  the dial. She turned it slowly, was concentrated on listening for the first
  click of tumblers falling into place...</p>

  <p>An arm slid around her waist, lifted her. A hand clamped over her face, a
  rasping, rough-palmed hand. It shut off breath and blinded her!</p>

  <p>June flailed frantic heels backward. They beat a futile tattoo against
  muscles that had no resilience. She squirmed, tried to bite the hand that
  stifled and blinded her. As well bite tanned, hardened leather. Her captor's
  strength was enormous, she was utterly helpless. He was carrying her off,
  easily as one would carry a doll, despite her desperate struggles.</p>

  <p>The girl's lungs were laboring agonizedly and darkness swirled in her
  brain, mingling pain and terror. She tugged feebly at the arm that encircled
  her, that crushed her. Appallingly she realized that it was sleeveless, that
  it was covered by shaggy, coarse hair...</p>

  <p>The Thing that had hold of her snuffled revoltingly. Its hand lifted away
  from her face for an instant, clamped down again. She had just time to snatch
  a breath of air tinctured with a musty, indescribable odor, to glimpse the
  same brutish, savage countenance that before had stared at her from under van
  Gandt's desk!</p>

  <p>June was not unconscious, but sensation, thought, were a chaotic whirlpool
  within her that was the essence of madness. Her horrid captor's lewd face
  gibbered at her from the swirling darkness, hooked talons, blackly hirsute,
  clawed at her as though to strip her naked. June came momentarily back to
  some dim sanity and was aware that her captor was climbing stairs, that he
  was grunting a bit with the effort.</p>

  <p>Terror, and unutterable fear and despair flooded in on her once more,
  swamping consciousness...</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">WHEN June regained her senses, she was lying, asprawl, on a
  wooden floor.</p>

  <p>She dared not open her eyes. Another glimpse of the monster that had
  brought her here would, she knew, send her back into the grey and horrible
  mists of insanity, and she would never again escape from them.</p>

  <p>It was quiet here. There wasn't any sound, except her own breathing.
  Surely, pressed against the floor as she was, she should hear, sense, some
  vibration if anyone was near. Perhaps her fearful captor had gone to complete
  whatever task he had been engaged in, before&mdash;finishing with her.</p>

  <p>She was alone in the room. June opened her eyes and looked fearfully about
  her, sat up. This place was just like the other office except that it was
  unfurnished. There was the big arc-topped window, and behind her the
  door&mdash;but this one had a glass transom over it...</p>

  <p>June got to her feet, swaying. Agony pounded in her temples. Her knees
  buckled with weakness, but she managed to get to the door, to try it. She
  wasn't surprised to find that it was locked. But&mdash;the window...</p>

  <p>Her muscles were so sluggish, responded so dully. If she didn't hurry the
  monster would be back before she could reach the window, and then...! June
  whimpered. Thick dust on the sill was gritty to her palms as she leaned on
  them, resting momentarily. Dirt coated the glass so that light filtered
  through only dimly.</p>

  <p>It was so hard to move the window-sash. So awfully hard. Strained muscles
  tore at the small of her back, but at last, it grated open. Cool air, coming
  through the slowly widening opening, was grateful. Traffic noises came in,
  also, blessedly sane. The blare of motor horns, the far-off shrilling of a
  policeman's whistle.</p>

  <p>Far-off! Far down! June leaned out to gaze down and down the precipitous
  steep wall to a concrete alley appallingly far below. She was on the top
  floor! There could be no escape this way! No use, even, to scream for help. A
  towering, unpierced wall leered at her from across the alley. The skyscraper
  that was to have been built on this site was planned to abut on that other
  with no provision for light or air. Behind that wall were hundreds of people,
  only a score of feet away, yet she was as alone, as far beyond the reach of
  aid, as though she were buried in primeval jungle.</p>

  <p>Sound pulled June around to face the door, slithering sound from the
  corridor beyond it. Her skin, prickled with terror and despair, was a leaden
  weight in her breast.</p>

  <p>The noise of the monster's approach came nearer, nearer. His return was
  leisurely. She was safely held, he knew, for his pleasure when he chose to
  take it</p>

  <p>June turned, climbed up and crouched on the broad window-sill. The giddy
  height made her dizzy, urged her to plunge out and down. Her burning eyes
  sought the entrance. When it opened&mdash;he must see how she had escaped
  him&mdash;she would lean out through the window, would let go all holds.</p>

  <p>Soft footfalls thudded closer. A tiny muscle in June's cheek began
  twitching. She put a finger to it to try and stop it. Her other hand was over
  her head, holding on to the sash. Straightening that arm would send her
  spinning out...</p>

  <p>Now! The footfalls were at the door, right outside... were passing!...
  were moving away, down the hall! It wasn't her captor at all! It was someone
  else! Someone who might help her. And she was letting him go! June slid off
  the sill to the floor and her throat constricted to a cry for help...</p>

  <p>But before she could give it utterance a new thought blazed across the
  chaos of her brain. Suppose it were another such monster as the one that had
  brought her here! Suppose it were van Gandt, looking for her. She knew that
  he was a murderer&mdash;and murderers did not hesitate to kill again! Before
  she called she must see who walked out there.</p>

  <p>The white-faced girl slipped off her shoes, darted across the floor. She
  lifted a stockinged foot to the doorknob, clawed at the door itself with
  desperate fingers. She was up, was clinging to the transom ledge with
  clutching hands, and her face was level with the glass. She rubbed away dust,
  peered through.</p>

  <p>The long, hazy vista of the corridor stretched away. Halfway to the
  disused elevators and the stairway, she could see the figure of a man moving
  along, wearily. He came into a shaft of light from an open door and there was
  something queerly familiar about him&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Help!" June screamed. "Help!"</p>

  <p>The man hesitated, as if uncertain that he had heard aright. Started on
  again. "Help!" the girl shrilled. He turned.</p>

  <p>And then June knew she had gone completely mad.</p>

  <p>Dead eyes stared out of deep-sunk, dark pits in the face that was turned
  toward her. One side of it was eaten away by a livid scar that jutted a
  hairless wedge into the man's scalp and wrenched his mouth out of shape to
  make of it a horrible, one-sided grin. But battered, dreadful as that face
  was, it was the face of Dan Forsythe&mdash;of her husband who had died two
  years ago!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; WHAT FED IN THE DARK?</h2>

  <p class="first">THE impact of that vision was like a physical blow, striking
  June away from her precarious hold. She reeled, her hand slipped on the
  ledge, her foot almost slipped from the knob. By some miracle her toes clung,
  and her fingertips&mdash;and contorted her body, fighting to save herself
  from a bone-crashing fall. Then she caught herself, and got a new grip on the
  transom frame with cold, shaking hands, and thrust her twitching face hard
  against the glass, against the peephole she had made in its film of
  grime.</p>

  <p>The long passage was blurred to her straining vision. Then her sight
  cleared and she saw that the hall was horribly, mockingly empty...</p>

  <p>Where had he gone? Oh, merciful God! Where had Dan gone?</p>

  <p>Had she seen him at all? Had she seen anyone? In the glass before her,
  June's reflection stared back at her, features sheet-white, drawn, eyes great
  dark pools outlined by quivering, blue lids, colorless lips twisting... The
  face of a madwoman!</p>

  <p>No! She was not mad! She had seen Dan! Dan had come back to her! He was
  alive! He was out there somewhere...</p>

  <p>June's little fist beat at the transom glass. Went through. The shards
  splintered about her face, ripped her hand, her arm. Crashed to the floor
  below. She tugged at the jagged remnants of glass still remaining in the
  frame and they were slippery with her blood, so that her grip slithered off.
  Whimpering with the pain, the girl struck and tugged at the remaining
  shards.</p>

  <p>The opening was wide enough at last. June pulled herself up, got a knee up
  on that high ledge, pulled herself through. Sharp points tore at her clothes,
  ripped her blouse away from one shoulder, dug into her flesh. She squirmed
  around, hung from extended arms, dropped. Twisted lithely as a cat as she
  fell, so that she faced the direction in which she had seen, or thought she
  had seen, Dan. She ran down the corridor in stocking feet with blood
  streaming from her cheek from her gashed shoulder. With blood, that she did
  not feel, dripping down across one white breast.</p>

  <p>"Dan!" she cried. "Dan...!"</p>

  <p>The hollow, empty labyrinths of the old structure took up her cry, and
  flung it from one moldering wall to another, mocking her with their endless
  echoing of his name. She reached the room with the open door and stopped to
  glance in, saw only dust and vacancy, and ran out. She reached the staircase
  that spiralled down as they used to build them, above the elevator shaft.</p>

  <p>"Dan!" she called down that lightless well. "Dan!" Listened for a
  reply&mdash;The musty darkness swallowed her agonized call, muffled it. Then
  the staircase was as silent as it was dark.</p>

  <p>June Forsythe held herself upright by wedging herself into the wall-corner
  behind her. Tears were hot in her eyes, and her heart pounded against its
  caging ribs as though about to break through. She had found him only to lose
  him again. He was gone&mdash;irretrievably gone. For her utter damnation she
  had been given one last glimpse of him, of his flame-seared, fire-tortured
  features, and then he had gone from her forever.</p>

  <p>He had not even known how near she was. He had not heard her call.</p>

  <p>If that which she had seen were a phantom, a ghost out of the dead past
  sent to torture her, it would have known she was there, it would have come to
  her through the very walls. No! Dan was alive. It was Dan she had seen. Thus
  the thoughts whirling through her tortured brain. Dan had gone down those
  stairs, down to where van Gandt, the murderer, lurked. Down to where the
  monster prowled. They would kill him again, one or the other of them.</p>

  <p>She must follow&mdash;to warn him, to save him. She must follow down
  through that ominous, dreadful darkness. Even though terror of what she might
  encounter clawed her breast&mdash;</p>

  <p>From the gloom below a wail floated up. It rose higher and higher in pitch
  until it was a thin scream of unendurable pain, of torment unspeakable. And
  then, suddenly, terribly, the sound choked off.</p>

  <p>Deathly silence closed in... What new horror was enclosed in those ghastly
  walls? Jeffery van Gandt had struck again. But whom? Oh God! Whom?</p>

  <p>June Forsythe half ran, half fell, down interminable steps. In the dark
  rectangles that marked the exits from each floor, gibbering, murderous things
  seemed to crouch, waiting for her&mdash;seemed to snatch at her with long,
  misty arms. Between, on the stygian flights, there was a scuttering of furry
  small bodies, and the gnashing of long fangs in pinched, sharp jaws, and the
  fetor of the rats. One blundered into her, squealed, and ran on up the
  stairs. Another. By tens, by scores, they poured past her, scampering upward.
  They went past her, as though she were not there, as though blinded to her
  presence, blinded by fear.</p>

  <p>Something unutterably fearsome was down below. Something from which the
  rats fled headlong, their ferocity forgotten, swamped by terror. The monster
  was somewhere down there, the monster from whose cell she had escaped; and
  Jeffery van Gandt was down there, surely awake now to the danger for him that
  her continued existence implied. They were waiting for her...</p>

  <p>If she turned off at one of these floors she was passing, hid in one of
  these deserted offices, they would never find her. There were thousands of
  cubicles in the ten-story, sprawling building, dozens of interlaced,
  wandering corridors. It would take an army to ferret her out. She could be
  safe from them&mdash;so easily she could be safe...</p>

  <p>But Dan was down there. Dan!</p>

  <p>June hurried on, downward through the unending darkness.</p>

  <p>The pound of each footfall sent darts of pain stabbing up her weary legs.
  Pain tore at June's laboring lungs, and utter exhaustion beat heavily within
  her skull. She must rest... She clung desperately to an unseen railing, held
  herself erect with the last shred of her strength. The damp cold of the brick
  wall was grateful to her throbbing forehead. In a minute&mdash;in just a
  minute she would go on again.</p>

  <p>Just below her in the darkness there was a soft sound. The lipping of an
  arid mouth against torn flesh. The gnawing of teeth on bone.</p>

  <p>Just below her, just around the sharp corner of the elevator shaft,
  something fed, snuffling with gluttonous, bestial satisfaction. Dead flesh
  thumped dully as the feaster tugged at it. It sounded like an arm threshing
  about, thudding against the wall. Icy prickles crawled up June Forsythe's
  backbone. Cold talons clutched her throat. What was it upon which the unseen
  carnivore fed? Who was it?</p>

  <p>She must know! The need to know fought within her against soul-searing
  dread, against revulsion, against unutterable fear. Step by step it dragged
  her down to where the treads became triangular to turn the shaft-corner,
  dragged her around that corner...</p>

  <p>Something bulked blackly against the grey oblong of the floor door. A
  beast large as a Newfoundland dog, incredibly large as a month-old calf. A
  loathsome thing whose shape was unmistakable against the pallid light by
  which it was half-revealed: sleek, narrow body, long head, sharp-pointed,
  pinched jaw with out-jutting teeth that tore into flesh and stripped it from
  bones. It was an enormous, a gigantic rat... Impossibly, it was a rat bloated
  to ten times the size of the largest rat that ever was, its foulness
  multiplied a thousandfold. And that over which it slavered, that which it
  nuzzled and tore at and vilely munched, that unbelievable rodent's dreadful
  meal still retained some grotesque semblance of its original&mdash;of its
  human&mdash;form!</p>

  <p>Here, on the steps down which she was so certain Dan had preceded her, a
  human being had been struck down by this overgrown foulness...</p>

  <p>The giant rat snarled, whipped around to her. It had scented her, heard
  her. It raised itself from its crouching posture. Its vile head was breast
  high to her. Its sinister eyes glowed redly in the murk. Its forelimbs were
  oddly, repugnantly man-like as they dangled in midair before it, and each
  yellow, encrusted fang was the size of a big man's thumb. Its black, split
  lip twitched, waving the long bristles of its mustache in unison, but the
  brute made no sound. Horribly, it made no sound.</p>

  <p>Its odor reached, enveloped June. Her senses reeled with the stench of the
  beast. Every quivering cell of her shrieked separate warning that the brute
  was about to leap upon her, was about to drag her down. In anticipation her
  flesh felt the rip of those awful fangs, the slice of those terrible claws.
  But appallingly she could not move. As if she were a reptile-fascinated bird,
  a nightmare paralysis had her in its inexorable grip, a rigidity that would
  not loose her to flee. She could only shudder, and moan&mdash;and wait
  helplessly for the gargantuan rat to spring.</p>

  <p>The gaunt, horrible body tautened for the lethal leap. A prayer rose in
  the maelstrom of her mind. "Oh Father, take me..."</p>

  <p>The beast crouched...</p>

  <p>Thunder blasted in June's ear and orange flame darted past her, searing
  her cheek. The rat jerked, snarled. The gun barked again. The beast whirled,
  was gone through the door behind it.</p>

  <p>June's knees folded, refused support. She toppled, slid down along the
  shaft-wall, bumped headlong down the few remaining steps to the landing. Her
  hand thrust forward to break her fall and went into warm, viscous liquid. A
  face stared into her own, a face from which the flesh had been stripped so
  that it was a gory, grinning skull. Whose? Oh merciful God! Whose?</p>

  <p>Her other hand came forward, pawed for the torn body. Felt shredded flesh,
  bared ribs. Found a flank that had been spared, that her coming had saved
  from the mammoth rodent's slicing teeth. Felt hair, shaggy coarse hair
  matting that bloody side. Hair such as she had felt&mdash;it seemed ages
  ago&mdash;on the arm of a two-legged brute that crushed her to its shaggy
  breast and carried her off to its lair.</p>

  <p>Not Dan! Oh, thank God! Not Dan.</p>

  <p>She was conscious of a presence above her. She twisted about to stare
  upwards at Jeffrey van Gandt! He towered above her, impeccable, and in his
  steady, almost transparent hand a revolver rested. June got unsteadily to her
  feet. The gun gestured toward her, she flung herself backward, twisted around
  the lintel of the floor door, and dashed down the passage. Before van Gandt
  could get into the corridor for a clear shot at her she had reached, dived
  down, a side hall, had twisted into another. She flattened herself into a
  doorway and waited, listening.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; FOOTFALLS OF DOOM</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was no indication that van Gandt had followed her. The
  silence of the ancient building closed in around June, brooding, pregnant
  with cryptic threat. He moved so noiselessly, so sinisterly without sound,
  that he might be almost upon her, might be there, just around that wall-angle
  that blocked off her sight. The girl's heart pounded, and fear crawled in her
  veins. He knew probably every nook and cranny of the place&mdash;he might be
  circling to creep up on her from the other side, hoping to catch her
  unaware.</p>

  <p>June felt behind her, found a doorknob, twisted it. In there she would be
  safer by a tiny bit, would at least have warning of his approach. She was
  inside, the door was closed, the room's mustiness folded about her.</p>

  <p>She was his quarry, his prey. He would track her down. He must hunt her
  down. He dared not let her escape. He dared not let her get out into the
  street with her story of what had happened to Karl Potten. At her report the
  police would come, would search...</p>

  <p>Would open his safe and find there the damning evidence of his more
  horrible crimes which she had risked so much, endured so much, in the attempt
  to obtain!</p>

  <p>No. Jeffrey Van Gandt would never let her get out of here alive. He dared
  not...</p>

  <p>But why, then, had he saved her from the giant rat?</p>

  <p>June shuddered, remembering the horror the unbelievable beast had wrought,
  remembering how it had crouched to leap upon her. A bullet would be more
  merciful. If rightly aimed death would be swift, painless. Almost, she wished
  she had stayed to take van Gandt's shot. Then she could have joined Dan,
  somewhere beyond the Veil...</p>

  <p>But Dan wasn't dead. Memory ran through her, warning her. How could she
  have forgotten? She had seen Dan, had followed him...</p>

  <p>Where was he? Where in this dim maze of death, of the fear of death and
  the fear of things far worse than death was her husband, her lover? He was
  sick, feeble! Mentally ill. The one glimpse she had had of his face had told
  her that. And there was so much of danger in this place to threaten him. She
  must find him! She must find her Dan!</p>

  <p>But how? Where could she look... June's throat tightened at the thud of a
  footfall near by. She whirled... There was no one here. No one at all. Only
  she was here within these leprous walls. Yet those were footsteps of an
  invisible walker, coming towards her! Heavy, ponderous footfalls she
  recognized. Pud&mdash;pud... She could feel the floor shake to their steady
  fall. Pud&mdash;pud... Footfalls of approaching doom. Footfalls like those of
  Karl Potten walking across van Gandt's office. Walking to his death!</p>

  <p>The air was suddenly icy, in this chamber where an unseen corpse walked.
  June thrust shaking, cold hands out in front of her, fending it off, fending
  off the menace she could not see, the thing of utter fear that thudded toward
  her&mdash;slowly, implacably. Without conscious volition, she backed from
  before its steady approach...</p>

  <p>The dank odor of a sepulchre was in her nostrils, dank breath of a tomb
  brushed her with feathery touch. She was against the mildewed, damp wall, she
  was crushed against the wall, and still the ominous, slow march came on. She
  could go no further. She was lost. Irredeemably she was lost...</p>

  <p>And then it was upon her! Its unseen, flabby hands were at her throat. A
  shriek burst from that throat before it was too late, before she could shriek
  no longer...</p>

  <p>June slid, limply, to the floor. The thudding footfalls continued. They
  went on. On&mdash;through the solid wall against which she lay! They faded,
  pounding off into the distance.</p>

  <p>The girl crouched on the floor, racked by supernatural fear. The terrors
  that thus far she had endured, soul-wrenching as they had been, were more or
  less explicable, more or less within the bounds of reason. But
  this&mdash;this invisible, intangible sound that had come slowly toward her
  with infinite menace, this parade of footfalls made by legs, which she had
  seen immobile in death, that had come in to her through solid brick and
  plaster, that had gone out through walls as impenetrable&mdash;what
  hypothesis could explain that? Except&mdash;that the wrath of Karl Potten had
  returned to stalk his murderer&mdash;to hunt down Jeffery van Gandt as van
  Gandt hunted her.</p>

  <p>But&mdash;but that was utterly mad! There were no such things as ghosts.
  There was no such thing as survival after death...</p>

  <p>Was there not? What was it, then, that had walked through a wall into this
  room, and out through another wall. What&mdash;if not a ghost, a vengeful
  wraith?</p>

  <p>But if the dead veritably walked in this house of ancient evil, then was
  Dan&mdash;the momentary glimpse of whom had wrung her heart and awakened full
  force all her burning love for him, all the torment the frustration of that
  love had brought upon her&mdash;was Dan a ghost? Was he a phantom come back
  to haunt the schemer who had sent him back to die? Only a phantom?</p>

  <p>June's brow furrowed in an attempt at thought. Her reason groped in dim,
  unfamiliar channels. If, by some miracle, Dan had survived the Marietta's
  destruction, had lain somewhere hurt, delirious perhaps, had recovered at
  last and found his way back to New York, he would have come to her at once.
  Of course he would...</p>

  <p>It was, then, not Dan whom she had seen. Not a living Dan. Dan was dead
  and the hope, the pain-shot joy that had flared within her at the sight of
  him must be quenched by final despair...</p>

  <p>No! God would not be so cruel. Dan was alive. He was somewhere within the
  time-blackened walls of this building and she would find him!</p>

  <p>The girl's lips tightened as she forced herself painfully to her knees.
  Her wounds had ceased to bleed, but everywhere dried blood caked her skin,
  and pain throbbed in a network encasing her tortured body. She pushed herself
  laboriously erect, reeled to the door of the room where she had vainly sought
  sanctuary.</p>

  <p>The passage outside was long, and very dim. June was conscious of a
  feeling that night was near. The passage was dim and silent, and dread lay in
  it like a palpable presence. Flecked-off, once-showy gilt lettering on the
  door through which she had just come read, "Room 263."</p>

  <p>Hazily, this made June aware of her location. She was on the second floor
  once more. To the left, down this corridor, then left again, and again left,
  was van Gandt's office. That was the way to the room of uncanny death, the
  room where there was a corpulent corpse that would not lie still, where a
  closet hid some dreadful secret. Where the giant rat...</p>

  <p>June pulled back into the doorway's embrasure, her heart pounding. A
  barely heard whisper of movement had warned that someone was nearby. Her
  fingers curled, trembling, about the doorknob, turned it slowly, without
  sound. She must get back in there, must hide...</p>

  <p>But&mdash;suppose it were Dan coming, searching for her. Suppose she hid
  from him, and he passed, and they never could find one another again...! In
  reality it was less than the space of a clock-tick, but it seemed to June
  that she hesitated for hours, while that soft susurration brushed
  nearer&mdash;nearer&mdash;bringing deadly peril or the lost lover for whom
  her arms ached.</p>

  <p>Which? She must know! She must know, despite terror that stopped her
  breath, robbed her of strength...</p>

  <p>Slowly her hand let the doorknob come back. Then, trembling violently, she
  peered around the corner of the wall.</p>

  <p>The corridor was a long tunnel of darkness, a narrowing vista that ended
  in a greyish translucence that was the pallid wall of another hall. For an
  instant June saw nothing&mdash;then there was something against the wan
  screen, a tall silhouette, the detailless black outline of a tall man out of
  the past, with canted top-hat and wing collar, and tight pantaloons. But one
  black hand of this silhouette was thrust stiffly out before it, and in that
  hand snouted the black shape of a very modern, very efficient revolver.</p>

  <p>Van Gandt's shadow drifted to her right across the end of the corridor and
  was gone. Breath burst from June's aching lungs&mdash;caught at her throat.
  Another silhouette had thrust out against that oblong of greyish light.
  Another form was momentarily occupying that eerie stage. Like the enormous
  projection of a close-up on a cinema screen it bulked for an instant;
  sharp-snouted, thin-legged, scaly-tailed&mdash;a macaber picturization of
  foul ferocity, of dire and dreadful death. The great rat crept with belly
  close to the ground, and its progress was utterly, gruesomely, silent as it
  stalked the human killer who had gone before.</p>

  <p>It, too, vanished. Like a grisly nightmare the two had passed across her
  vision and were silently gone, the brute human
  stalking&mdash;herself&mdash;and the foul beast that hunted him.</p>

  <p>June's mouth twisted with a grim, sardonic humor. Van Gandt had saved her
  from the rodent, was the rodent now to save her from van Gandt? There would
  be weird justice in such a denouement.</p>

  <p>Her way was clear! Realization beat in on her consciousness. Her way to
  van Gandt's office was clear, her way to van Gandt's office and the safe in
  that office, and the grey book with the ink-splotched back that lay in that
  safe.</p>

  <p>She started running, breathlessly, down the corridor. She reached its end
  in the passage along which he had gone&mdash;he who was at once hunter and
  hunted, and the thing that hunted him. She threw a wild, frightened look over
  her shoulder as she twisted to the left. A little way beyond, that hall
  turned again, and they were beyond the turn. She kept on, fear prickling her
  spine, the nape of her neck, fear that they might hear, that they might
  return. The fetor of the giant rodent was strong in the stagnant air.</p>

  <p>She turned left again. Somewhat safer now. Left once more. This corridor
  was more familiar&mdash;this corridor and the door at its further end.</p>

  <p>She crept down the long hall to the door, turned the knob, and entered the
  musty office where all this weird adventure had begun. The sheet on which she
  had been working when Karl Potten knocked, asking admittance to death, was
  still in the typewriter. The table-desk before the window was quite
  undisturbed. But&mdash;there was no cadaver on the floor before the safe!</p>

  <p>June flung a harried glance at the inscrutable door of the closet to the
  left. There was space in there, space even for Potten's tremendous bulk to
  companion that other cold and clammy thing that had resented her hiding
  there. She pulled her eyes away from that, saw a huge packing case bulking
  against the other wall. A stab of eerie terror shot through her as the faint
  sound of furtive movement seemed to come from within it. Her lips tightened
  and she went on toward her objective. She had too much to fear from the
  living to be afraid of the dead. Even of the dead who walked.</p>

  <p>She crept past the desk, knelt in front of the safe. She put her cheek
  against the chill of its iron and twirled the dial, listening for the fall of
  the tumblers into their places. Elation surged within her, momentarily
  surmounting her fear&mdash;the ghastly memory of what had occurred when once
  before she had attempted this deed. The shaggy brute, at least, would not
  trouble her again. Faint nausea retched at her as she remembered how she had
  seen him last...</p>

  <p>It was done. The last tumbler clicked, and June pulled the door open. The
  safe's shelved interior was open to her...</p>

  <p>Dismay spread like a black pool in her consciousness. The ancient shelves
  before her was empty. Swept clean. The grey book was not there. The
  manuscript on which van Gandt had labored was gone...</p>

  <p>"Something told me that I should find you here," a mellow, suave voice
  said from behind her. "I am fortunate to have gotten back in time."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; MONSTERS OF DARKNESS</h2>

  <p class="first">DESPAIR and the realization of utter defeat engulfed June.
  She came slowly erect, turned about. She had put her hands on the back of van
  Gandt's chair to steady herself as her legs threatened to refuse support.</p>

  <p>The room was almost quite dark now, so that he was a looming, indefinite
  shadow in its gloom. The fantastic quality with which his outdated dress had
  always invested him was emphasized by the darkness, so that he seemed
  altogether unreal. He was a vague clotting of the darkness, a tall spectre of
  infinite threat. But a stray gleam of light impinged on the gun in his pale
  hand, and that was all too concrete.</p>

  <p>The tiny metallic glitter pulled June's eyes to it. Why didn't he shoot,
  she wondered wearily, and end this agony? Why did he stand there so silently?
  Why did his smouldering eyes sweep up and down her quivering frame? She was
  half-nude, she knew. But he must have seen feminine flesh before&mdash;flesh
  not torn, not lacerated as hers was.</p>

  <p>"Where&mdash;" he said at last&mdash;"where are the things that have been
  taken from that safe?" His speech was still quiet, still low-pitched. But
  behind the tone of imperative demand in it there were undertones of an
  inexplicable scorn, of savage anger. "Where have you hidden them?"</p>

  <p>That was why he had saved her from the giant rat, why he did not shoot her
  now, off-hand. Someone had beaten her to it, had extracted the account-book
  and the manuscript from their repository, and he thought it was she. He would
  not kill her until they were back again in his hands.</p>

  <p>June lifted her head to look squarely at him. Her lips moved. At first
  they made no sound. Then words breathed from between them. "I did
  not&mdash;hide them. I did not&mdash;take them."</p>

  <p>She said it, and then gasped, within herself. It was the wrong thing to
  say. Utterly the wrong thing. If he believed her there was no longer any
  reason for him to spare her, every reason to do away with the sole witness to
  his murder of Potten. If he did not believe her he would try to force the
  answer to his demand from her. And there was that in his face, even in the
  posture of his body, that told her he would stop at nothing to force
  her...</p>

  <p>"Where&mdash;are&mdash;they?" Syllable by soft syllable the question
  thudded into the room's gathering darkness.</p>

  <p>June's throat constricted. He did not believe that she knew nothing about
  the book's whereabouts and that of the manuscript. He didn't believe...</p>

  <p>"I tell you I don't know." The sentence tore her throat as she formed it
  and a sob was its period, a sob she could not repress. She was tired, so
  terribly tired of fighting, of pain. "I&mdash;don't&mdash;know."</p>

  <p>Even in the murk she could see her tormenter stiffen, could sense the
  decision to which he had come. "It would be better for you to remember," he
  said, and there was a new grimness, a new threat in his voice. "Before
  I&mdash;take steps to make you&mdash;remember."</p>

  <p>The gentleness was gone from his features now. They had sharpened,
  somehow, and the muscles beneath the anomalous youth of his skin seemed to
  have melted, so that his face was a skull-like mask of sadistic ferocity
  through dark pits in which eyes stared that mirrored madness. And suddenly
  van Gandt advanced toward the terrified girl. He seemed to grow taller as he
  came, appallingly to grow taller, so that he seemed a spectre of doom.</p>

  <p>June's hand fluttered to her mouth in an uncontrollable gesture of
  abandoned terror as van Gandt came to the desk, moved silently around it to
  reach her. She was utterly incapable of movement, utterly unable to make even
  a futile gesture at escape.</p>

  <p>He was upon her! His free hand lashed out, its skinny fingers closed on
  her arm, dug in. Each separate digit burned into her quivering flesh. A
  supernatural strength was in those fingers and all the slender, frail-seeming
  frame of the man. June was forced backward, irresistibly backward, till the
  upper edge of the open safe door was against her back.</p>

  <p>Van Gandt thrust his knee within the steel portal, held it immovable. The
  inexorable pressure of the hand on June's arm bent her over backward, the
  small of her back fulcruming on the metal, bent her still further backward
  until burning pain cut across her spine, tore across the stretched muscles of
  her abdomen.</p>

  <p>A scream burbled in the girl's chest. Van Gandt's hand released her arm,
  lashed for her throat, clenched it, quenched the shriek before it reached her
  lips. Her own arm was caught behind her in the narrow V at the hinge of the
  safe door, and the door was closed upon it, clamped it.</p>

  <p>Van Gandt's knee was on the outside of the door now, and his hand that
  still clutched his gun utilized the tremendous leverage to close the steel
  upon the girl's soft arm. It was crushing her bone. The pain she had already
  suffered was as nothing to the excruciating agony that slowly closing vise
  inflicted now...</p>

  <p>"Will you&mdash;tell me&mdash;now?" van Gandt grunted, and the clutch of
  his grip on her throat relaxed an instant.</p>

  <p>"Can't," the agonized girl forced out. "Don't&mdash;know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Rage flared in the torturer's eyes, and his hot breath gusted in her face.
  "You'll tell before I am through with you," he grunted. "You'll tell." He
  swung his hip against the safe door and it was forced an inch nearer to
  closing. Pain burst the bonds of June's arm, shrilled through her whole body.
  Pain insupportable. The tortures of hell could be no worse... Blackness
  swirled about June, but she prayed in vain for the release of
  unconsciousness.</p>

  <p>Then, dimly she realized that the agonizing pressure was relaxing, that
  there was sound somewhere, the sound of heavy footfalls, of rapping on the
  office door.</p>

  <p>People were out there, were demanding admittance. People! Had Dan managed
  to get out, to call the police? Was it Dan come to rescue her...?</p>

  <p>"One moment, please, while I light up." Van Gandt must have iron nerves!
  His voice was steady, unperturbed, and as he spoke he lifted her free of the
  safe. She could breathe but his hand remained on her throat, in warning to
  silence. June knew only hazily what was going on, her perception fogged by
  the swirling chaos that consciousness had become for her. But she was aware
  that the man was moving swiftly to get something out of his desk drawer, that
  her lips were suddenly tight clamped by something he had stripped across
  them, that the same something was binding her wrists, her ankles. That was
  adhesive tape gagging her, holding her helpless.</p>

  <p>He rolled her under the table, and lit the oil lamp above. Its dull glow
  filled the office that had been a torture-chamber, but where June was the
  shadow was impenetrable. Anyone looking in her direction would be blinded by
  the blaze of light above, could not possibly see her in the deep blackness
  where she lay. But she lay facing the door and the room, and could see
  everything there.</p>

  <p>Whoever was at the door rapped again, but so swiftly had van Gandt worked
  that there was yet no real impatience in the knock. He flitted across the
  room, turned the key in the lock.</p>

  <p>"Come in," van Gandt said smoothly.</p>

  <p>"I must have fallen asleep while I was waiting for you and when your knock
  woke me it was pitch-dark."</p>

  <p>Hope seeped from June, left her trembling with despair. He had been
  expecting the newcomers. Of course! They were friends of his, men come to
  take away the packing case and its grisly contents. They would be gone in a
  few minutes and he would again be free to torture her...</p>

  <p>The black tide of physical suffering and mental despair welled up into her
  consciousness, blotted sight, hearing. Then a stab of poignant pain cleared
  her senses again. She saw legs, feet moving across the floor, three pairs of
  them. She recognized van Gandt's in the lead by their gray gaiters,
  tight-fitting over elastic-sided Congress shoes. The others were modern, a
  pair of brown ties, a snub-nosed, stumping pair of black oxfords. The six
  feet thumped across the floor, and their footfalls pounded on June's rasped
  nerves, on the unbearable ache of her crushed, limp arm, so that her brain
  swam.</p>

  <p>They were going toward the packing case, where it stood at the head of the
  long table. It was so big, June fretted in a queer inconsequence that was
  delirium, and what was in it was so heavy that two men wouldn't be strong
  enough to carry it...</p>

  <p>"Will you take your accustomed seats, gentlemen," Jeffery van Gandt said,
  amazingly, "and we'll get down to business." There was a crisp competence in
  his tone that had not been there before.</p>

  <p>An answering voice was age-thinned, querulous. "What is your purpose in
  bringing us here again, Jeffery? I thought we'd split up for good. Settled
  everything." Chairs scraped. June could see up as far as the chair seats,
  could see spindly shanks, thin buttocks, settle into one; could see a
  sturdier form occupy the other. Van Gandt remained standing, at the head of
  the table. One hand rested on the huge box, the other was unconcernedly in a
  pocket of his long frock coat where a lump might be his fist&mdash;or the
  revolver.</p>

  <p>"There is something still to adjust, Hugh Tomlinson," he responded in a
  grim voice. "Something I did not know about last month, when we split
  partnership."</p>

  <p>"You're not going back on our bargain now," the third man rumbled. "You
  got all the better of it as it is. We gave you what was left of the business
  when we pulled out. I'm not signing any more documents."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are, Stoughton," van Gandt said softly. "Yes, you are." His hand
  that was on the case moved out of June's sight. A paper rustled as if he were
  bringing it out of a breast pocket. "You are signing this one."</p>

  <p>Tomlinson's senile utterance cut across the other's sentence. "Where's
  Karl? Where's Karl Potten? I don't see why Karl Potten isn't here."</p>

  <p>June could sense the hard-mouthed leer in the reply. "Don't worry about
  Karl. I've settled with him already." She wondered if the others realized the
  threat in what he said. If she could warn them. If only she could warn
  them!</p>

  <p>"What's on that paper?" Stoughton's deep tones fell flatly into the
  momentary pause. "What is it you want us to sign?"</p>

  <p>"A confession." It seemed as though van Gandt were relishing each word, so
  slowly did it come forth. "A confession&mdash;of grand larceny, fraud,
  and&mdash;mass murder."</p>

  <p>"What!" His chair went spinning across the room as Stoughton lunged out of
  it to his feet. "You're insane..."</p>

  <p>"Hold it!" Van Gandt's gun was out of its concealing pocket now. Its blue
  barrel jutted rock-steady, menacing. "I'll use this if I have to."</p>

  <p>The man's big-thewed limbs froze, but June saw the tensity of their
  muscles, the taut quiver of their knees. This man was not licked, not yet. He
  was waiting, hawklike, for a momentary wavering in van Gandt's attention, the
  flicker of a chance for him to spring, to wrest the gun from the other, to
  beat him to his knees. The girl prayed that he might have that chance.</p>

  <p>"I knew I shouldn't come here," Tomlinson wailed. "My heart&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up you old fool," Stoughton growled. Then, to van Gandt. "What's
  this rigamarole you're pulling on us?"</p>

  <p>"Listen! Here's the confession you are going to sign before you leave
  here. I'll read it so that Hugh also will understand, I see he is too upset
  to put on his spectacles: 'We the undersigned, Hugh Tomlinson and James
  Stoughton, for fifty years members of the firm of J. van Gandt and Partners,
  in the business of owning, chartering and operating freight ships, do hereby
  confess that during the said fifty years we conspired to destroy, and did
  destroy without trace, ten various vessels owned by the said firm, together
  with the crews thereof, for the purpose of securing to ourselves the
  insurance upon said vessels and upon the cargoes thereof which we had insured
  at far above their actual value. The names of the said vessels are attached
  hereto.</p>

  <p>" 'We also state that Jeffery van Gandt of the said firm was at no time
  aware of the said conspiracy and is altogether innocent of participation
  therein.</p>

  <p>" 'In witness whereof...!' "</p>

  <p>The floor seemed to heave under June, her blood to curdle in her veins. It
  was all true, then, the crime Dan had suspected, evidence of which she had
  come here to uncover. It was true, but van Gandt was setting upon it the
  capstone of a greater infamy. With the disappearance of that very evidence he
  was sliding out from under its revelations, was foistering his own guilt on
  his ex-partners. Whether or not they were tarred with the same pitch, this
  confession would sign their death warrants and let him go free! He was evil
  incarnate...</p>

  <p>"And how are you going to make us sign?" Stoughton was saying. "By holding
  a gun on us?" Mass murderer, or not, he was courageous. His feet were planted
  foursquare, his voice had no quiver in it. "We'd be signing our own death
  warrant. It would be better to die with a swift bullet than in the electric
  chair." Tomlinson was slumped laxly in his chair. Had he fainted, or...</p>

  <p>Van Gandt chuckled. "No, James. Knowing you I do not expect to force you
  to sign this confession by threatening to shoot you. It is because I did not
  quite see how I could accomplish it that I waited, writing the history of the
  frauds, petty and great, that my partners perpetrated during our long
  association. You left the books with me, you know. The books wherein the
  seeing eye could easily trace out that history.</p>

  <p>"In the meantime I studied something else, James. I studied fear. In
  literature, James, and in life. And, curiously enough, it was your own
  emissary that taught me how to make you sign, James. Your emissary who
  succeeded in opening my safe&mdash;too late." The man's short laugh was
  humorless, cruel. "Isn't it funny that the girl you sent to steal from me
  should give me the weapon I needed?"</p>

  <p>June caught her breath with the realization that van Gandt thought these
  men had sent her. He thought they had sent her to open his safe and
  steal&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What weapon?" asked Stoughton hoarsely. "What weapon?"</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid of rats?" van Gandt said softly. "Are you afraid of rats,
  James?"</p>

  <p>"Of rats. You're crazy! Of course not!"</p>

  <p>Under the table in the pool of darkness blacker than night, fear clotted
  around June as she sensed what van Gandt intended. His hand was back to the
  packing case, was fumbling at a metal catch she had not before noticed.</p>

  <p>"I think you will be afraid of this one, James." The case's wooden sides
  dropped away, their metal lining flashing momentarily as it caught the rays
  of the lamp. Then there was a cage beside the tall, gaunt man, a cage of
  inch-thick bamboo shafts. And within that cage was an ungainly grey form that
  heaved to splay feet and stood for a moment blinking little red eyes at the
  light. A gigantic rat, larger even than the one that had prowled the dank
  corridors, thrust a sharp nose against the bamboo and twitched split, black
  lips to reveal long, cruel fangs.</p>

  <p>"Ohhh!" Tomlinson squealed, his flaccid limbs jerking to sudden life.
  "Ohhh!" he gurgled. "My heart!" He pitched out of his chair down onto the
  floor. He shuddered, lay still.</p>

  <p>"Are you not afraid of this rat, James Stoughton?" van Gandt asked again
  as he backed slowly away from that cage and its dreadful prisoner, backed on
  silent feet to the room door. "Are you not afraid?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; FROM BENEATH THE TABLE</h2>

  <p class="first">JUNE could not see Stoughton's face, but she could see his
  great hands, his big-knuckled hands, tight against his trouser legs. She
  could see them open and close, open and close, in the pregnant silence. She
  could see them begin to quiver, could see them flutter like the leaves of an
  aspen in the wind.</p>

  <p>Jeffery van Gandt was at the door. He faced the office, and his revolver
  snouted from his hip, menacing. Momentarily the shocked silence held. And
  then was broken by the scrape of great yellow teeth.</p>

  <p>The sound pulled June's gaze back to the cage in time to see a splinter
  tear away from a bar of that cage, to see the rat's fangs return to the
  attack and tear off another long shred of fibrous wood.</p>

  <p>"How long," van Gandt asked, conversationally. "Do you think it will take
  him to get out, if I do not shoot him?"</p>

  <p>Stoughton's words were a husked stage-whisper. "You don't dare let him
  out, Jeffery. He'll get you too."</p>

  <p>"No. I can get out in time, and lock the door. But you&mdash;Stay back!"
  Orange flame spat from van Gandt's gun, a bullet plunked into the floor at
  Stoughton's feet. "The next one will break your leg, James, and stretch you
  helpless for the rat!"</p>

  <p>Stretch him helpless! Good God! June herself was already stretched
  helpless on the floor where the rat must surely find her. A swift vision rose
  before her of that other rat's prey, of the grinning skull to which shreds of
  torn flesh still adhered. If Stoughton did not sign&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Will you sign, James? Will you sign so that I may use a bullet on the
  brute? Or shall I leave you here with the rat of which you are not
  afraid?"</p>

  <p>"Damn you, van Gandt," Stoughton groaned, broken-voiced.</p>

  <p><i>Crrrack!</i> The huge rodent had already gnawed half through the bar.
  It worked steadily, savagely, ignoring the men's voices, ignoring the terror
  it inspired. Those teeth, that sheared tough bamboo so readily, what would
  they do to human flesh, to human bone?</p>

  <p>Why didn't he give in? Oh, God! Why didn't Stoughton give in?</p>

  <p>"Well?" Van Gandt's free hand was behind him. The rattle of the turning
  doorknob added its omen to the steady rasp of the rat's teeth. The great
  wooden leaf was slowly moving, June could see the opening widen. "I can't
  wait much longer, James."</p>

  <p>Stoughton's hands were like writhing snakes. June's ear was against the
  floor and she could hear sound not audible to the others. The sound she heard
  was the thump of a ponderous foot that was dead. Pud&mdash;pud... It didn't
  mean anything to the girl just then. She too, would be dead in moments.
  Horribly dead.</p>

  <p><i>Crrrack!</i> There was only a thread of fibre remaining, now, to hold
  that rat in. Only a thread. June could not tear her eyes from the cage,
  though she heard the door squeak fully open.</p>

  <p>"Shoot! For God's sake shoot it! I'll sign!" It was the gibbering,
  fear-maddened voice of Stoughton. "Here. I've signed it."</p>

  <p>The last filament of the bar broke through. The rat's fangs clenched on
  the severed rod, bent it inward. But there was no shot! The great, vile beast
  was free!</p>

  <p>"Karl!" van Gandt choked. "Don't, Karl"</p>

  <p>A columnar, black-clothed arm was clamped around van Gandt's chest. A
  tremendous hand, doughy pale, was folded over his gun, was wresting it from
  him. The murderer, struggled with the apparition of his victim, surged
  backward, out of the room. The door slammed shut!</p>

  <p>The rat crouched, its beady, ferocious eyes on Stoughton. It leaped...</p>

  <p>June closed her eyes as a heavy body struck the floor, as a strong man
  screamed in uttermost horror and agony. There was the sound of a brief
  struggle out there on the floor. Then there was only the snarling snuffle of
  a feeding rodent, the scrape of fangs on bared bone.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the grisly sounds stopped too. The girl was aware of eyes upon
  her, of a hostile stare prickling her spine with warning. She had to
  look.</p>

  <p>The huge beast was crouched over the gory, indescribable thing that not so
  long ago had moved, and spoken, and known fear. Its pinched jaw thrust at
  June where she lay in shadow, and its pointed nose wrinkled to the scent that
  had just come to it...</p>

  <p>Movement pulled June's eyes beyond the creature. The office door was once
  more open. Its opening framed&mdash;Dan!</p>

  <p>Dan's arm crooked. There was a gun in his hand and that gun belched flame.
  The rat jerked to the impact of its projectile. Jerked again&mdash;and again.
  Then it collapsed, lifeless atop the bloody body upon which it had dined.</p>

  <p>Dan leaned against the door-jamb. The color had drained from his face,
  except where his scar flamed scarlet across tortured flesh. His eyes were
  agonized as he stared at the shambles in that room, at what once was
  Stoughton, at Tomlinson's corpse with its blue-tinged face and hands telling
  the story of an overburdened heart that terror had burst, at the rat. His
  head turned to the door, and he said, in a dull dead voice&mdash;"She isn't
  here..."</p>

  <p>June writhed, arced her body, threw herself over. Rolled out from under
  the table. Dan saw her and a great joy flashed into his face, transfigured
  it.</p>

  <p>"June!" he cried. "My little wife!" He was on his knees beside her. She
  was in his arms again, and his kisses were warm on her torn face. She
  gestured and he pulled the tape from her mouth so that she could answer those
  kisses, from her wrists so that she could answer his embrace.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you two love-birds had enough?" van Gandt asked.</p>

  <p>Terror was a cold tide sweeping June once more. "Dan!" she croaked. "Watch
  out, Dan!"</p>

  <p>"It's all right, darling," Dan said. "Quite all right"</p>

  <p>"No!" Jeffery van Gandt denied. "It is not all right. Not yet." He was
  still tall, still saturnine in the doorway, but his tall hat was gone, his
  coat ripped from his shoulders, his collar ripped from his neck. "It will not
  be all right till I make such amends as I may to Mrs. Forsythe for what I
  have done to her."</p>

  <p>June pulled herself to a sitting posture. "Done to me!" she gasped. "What
  about what you have done to him and those who sailed with him on the
  Marietta? What about what you did to those other crews&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, June," Dan interrupted. "No! I've read the books that were in the
  safe and I know now that van Gandt knew nothing about the conspiracy. He only
  discovered it afterward and was working to expose his ex-partners. They got
  wind of what he was doing. Stoughton sent men to steal it, Potten tried to
  buy him off&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But he killed Potten, and then the German came back to haunt him.
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"June! Potten wasn't killed. Goonah knocked him out, but he came to after
  a while, and..."</p>

  <p>"Goonah?"</p>

  <p>"The half-crazy Lascar stoker Stoughton hired to get van Gandt's
  manuscript. A hairy ape he was, if there ever was one..."</p>

  <p>"The&mdash;monster! Dan! Was he the monster that carried me off?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. To hide you from van Gandt. We were afraid that..."</p>

  <p>"We were afraid. Were you mixed up in... Look here, Dan, you had better
  tell me about all this from the beginning. That is if you want to keep me
  sane."</p>

  <p>"Another kiss first." Dan held her.</p>

  <p>June pushed him away. "You didn't seem to think enough of me to let me
  know you were alive. Dan&mdash;why...?"</p>

  <p>The man's head hung, abashed. "I'm so hideous. I didn't think you could
  stand the sight of me. I didn't think you would love me any longer."</p>

  <p>"You foolish, foolish boy." June kissed him as the tears welled in her
  eyes. "But I'm still waiting for your story," she said at last.</p>

  <p>"The Marietta went up in a sudden blaze," began Dan, "and there wasn't a
  dog's chance of anyone's surviving, except that we were hove to, and I
  happened to be out overside in a dinghy, looking over the hull to see if it
  needed painting. As it was, a spurt of flame burned me terribly, and when I
  was picked up, days afterward, I was out of my mind. I was taken to a
  hospital in New Zealand, took a year to recover, another to work my way back
  home. But all the time I was thinking of something I had seen here in this
  office in an old account book that I glimpsed over Tomlinson's shoulder. It
  was a list of lost vessels and the insurance collected for them, and at the
  bottom there was a notation that..."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know. You wrote about in your diary, and about the suspicions of
  organized ship-scuttling it roused in you&mdash;and your intention of looking
  into the matter further when you came back from that voyage. When the
  Marietta was lost I made up my mind to bring the criminals to justice. That
  is why I tried to get into this office, and finally succeeded..."</p>

  <p>Dan smiled his pathetically twisted smile. "I had forgotten that I made
  that entry. So you wanted to avenge me, you brave kid, and bit off more than
  you bargained for. Well, I sneaked into this building last night, but I found
  the old curmudgeon writing all night. There was plenty of room to hide in
  this place however, and I did so. Van Gandt did leave the room early in the
  morning, and I got into it. But he came back almost immediately and I just
  about managed to slide into that closet over there just in time. I was in
  there when you came in, and recognized your voice. I was frantic to get to
  you, but he was in the room...</p>

  <p>"I must have fallen asleep, because the next thing I knew you came
  bounding into the closet as if the devil himself were after you. I touched
  you, started to speak to you, when you screeched and dived out again. I
  followed, saw you on the floor, saw a shaggy-haired brute at the safe,
  working to open it. Before I could do or say anything van Gandt was at the
  door again.</p>

  <p>"The Lascar dived out of the window, and I saw that he had come down a
  rope from an upper floor. I followed him, swarmed up the rope after him, and
  we pulled it up just in time to avoid van Gandt's seeing it.</p>

  <p>"Goonah told me he was after something in the safe, that he had been hired
  to get it. He assumed that Tomlinson or Potten had sent me on the same
  mission, fell in easily with my suggestion that we work together. I told him
  that you were my girl, that I was afraid for you and anxious to get you out
  of here. He slid down the rope once more to spy.</p>

  <p>"Van Gandt saw him, got off some rigamarole about death, and suddenly
  whirled to grab at him. He pulled Goonah in, but the Lascar sent him
  spinning. Potten made a grab at him, and he twisted the Dutchman's neck, came
  back up the rope. He told me what had happened, that van Gandt had run out of
  the room, scared. I sent him down to make a try at the safe.</p>

  <p>"You had beaten him to it. He remembered what I had said about wanting you
  out of there, picked you up and scooted. Took you all the way up to the top
  floor and locked you in a room. I went up to look for you, but suddenly
  Goonah called me from below and I started down again. Before I got two
  flights down he screamed, horribly. I rushed down the rest of the way, saw
  that a capybara had gotten him, that it was too late for me to do anything,
  and got out of the way before the thing would go for me."</p>

  <p>"What was that you called it?" June stirred. "A capy&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>"A capybara. It's a ratlike animal from the wilds of Brazil. I can't
  imagine where van Gandt could have gotten them. I thought the only specimen
  in this country was in the Bronx Zoo."</p>

  <p>"I had a couple in a South Street warehouse waiting to be shipped to the
  Cleveland Park," van Gandt interrupted. "The first time I went out, this
  morning, I arranged to have them sent here. One got away and it took me hours
  to track it down, kill it."</p>

  <p>"At any rate," Dan resumed, "I finally got a chance to come down the rope,
  get into the safe, get what I was after. I was upstairs again, had just
  discovered van Gandt's innocence, when I heard shots, shouting, rushed down
  here and saw him struggling with Potten. 'Save the girl,' he yelled as he saw
  me, 'in there,' and kicked a gun that was on the floor at me. I knew the girl
  must be you, snatched up the gun and came in, and..."</p>

  <p>"I suddenly realized that none of my three sweet partners," Jeffery van
  Gandt explained, "had given any evidence of knowing of your existence. I knew
  then that I was mistaken in thinking you were an emissary of their's and when
  I saw Forsythe I sent him in to save you from the capybara. That's only the
  beginning of my payment for torturing you. I am a bachelor, have no
  relatives. You shall be my heirs."</p>

  <p>It was not till the next day, when Dan came in to tell her of the
  arraignment of Karl Potten before a magistrate and his being held for the
  Grand Jury that June remembered how he had walked invisibly through the room
  where she was and terrorized her. She told Dan about it. He scoffed at her,
  gently.</p>

  <p>"But I did hear him. It was as if he were in the very room with me and yet
  he wasn't. It was Room 263&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait," Dan grunted. "Wait, June. I know the answer. The rooms in that
  corridor are back to back with the one where van Gandt's office is, and the
  floor boards run right through. Potten was walking in the passage, but he
  walks so heavily that the boards carried the sound right through into the
  room where you were."</p>

  <p>"There goes my last ghost," June mourned&mdash;and the word "ghost" came
  faintly, all but smothered out beneath June's smiling lips.</p>
