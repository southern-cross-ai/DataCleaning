<p><span class="a">Sir</span>,&mdash;I avail myself of an
opportunity, <em>viâ</em> King George's Sound, to report to his
Excellency the Governor my arrival here yesterday with the party,
which he has been pleased to place under my guidance, and my
intention to proceed to-morrow north-eastward, on the further
prosecution of the service intrusted to me.</p>
<p>The expedition having started from York on the 14th ultimo,
ascended the Avon river, and took its final departure on the 17th
from N&#257;lyaring, the upper sheep-station in that district,
following the compass direction of E. by S. ½ S. as intermediate
between tracts of country previously traversed. The rough plan of
our route, which I have the honour to inclose, will show that in
15 miles we passed gradually from good grassy country about
N&#257;lyaring to scrubby sand-plains and eucalyptus thickets. At
34 miles we met with a tribe of natives who, although at first
alarmed and suspicious, soon became friendly and useful, showing
us several springs and wells of good water on our route,
extending 50 miles to the boundary of their own immediate
country. At this time we had descended from an elevated tract of
sandy plains covered with low scrubby vegetation, and were
threading a vast chain of small shallow salt lagoons, in a wide
valley of thick scrub, several miles in extent, coming from the
S.E., and extending in the opposite direction and westward,
towards that part of the Avon a little above Jarakine Pool. The
natives gave us to understand there was good grass in the valley
of the river, between that pool and our camp at Y&#363;rakine,
but that higher up the valley was poor and worthless; I therefore
quitted it, and proceeded eastward to the meridian of 119° E.,
where, finding that the country did not improve, and that we
looked out to the N.E. and S.E., over 15 or 20 miles of land
apparently unfit for any useful purpose, or capable of affording
subsistence for our horses, I turned to the S.S.W., towards the
Stirling range, to accomplish the ultimate portion of my
instructions before the dry season should become too far
advanced.</p>

From PERTH to RUSSELL RANGE, 1848 &amp; 1849<br>
<br>
<small>[Click on map to enlarge it.]</small></p>
<p>At the end of 25 miles we recrossed the extensive system of
salt lakes belonging to the Avon branch, already mentioned, and
gradually ascended an extensive tract of elevated sand plains,
which furnish the sources of the rivers Avon, Williams, Arthur,
Buchanan, and Beaufort. The sharp, keen air of that region, and
the difficulty we experienced in keeping ourselves warm,
especially when exposed to the pelting hail, which was frequently
brought along by a strong S.W. wind, induced me to conclude that
our elevation above the sea-level could not be less than 1800 or
2000 feet.</p>
<p>Descending to the southward, through very thick country, or
over scrubby sand plains, we forced our way across an intricate
wide valley, in lat. 33° 16' S., in which were scattered small
pools of fresh water, inclining westward, in a shallow clay bed,
being probably near the source of the Buchanan river, the highest
known portion of which was 80 miles distant, in the same
latitude.</p>
<p>The country continued poor and unpromising, with some few
exceptions, for 55 miles further, when we emerged from a very
dense scrubby thicket, which we had found some difficulty in
forcing, upon a system of waters falling into the S. coast, and
were rejoiced and relieved at finding both water and grass for
the supply of our half-famished horses. This proved to be a
branch of the P&#257;llinup river, which we followed downwards to
our intended camp of P&#333;ilyenup, near the N.E. extremity of
the Stirling range, meeting with excellent grass and abundance of
water in its valley. The weather had, indeed, set in boisterous
and wet from the S. W., and rendered the country so exceedingly
soft that it was with difficulty we proceeded.</p>
<p>The future route of the expedition must necessarily greatly
depend upon circumstances; but as I learn that a branch of the
P&#257;llinup comes from the N.E. and joins the main river at 12
or 15 miles from its mouth, I have deemed it advisable to try the
north-eastern country by that route as far as practicable,
starting with supplies for 90 days.</p>
<p>Having now as briefly as possible detailed the principal
occurrences connected with my past movements and future
intentions, I can but regret that the former have proved of value
chiefly in a geographical point of view, although much good and
available country, both arable and pastoral, has been seen in
patches adapted to limited operations; but I beg to assure his
Excellency that in the remainder of my proceedings, let them be
in what direction they may, for carrying out the ultimate views
of the Government, my best exertions shall be used for rendering
the expedition as productive as possible of public benefit.</p>
<p>I am much indebted to Messrs. H. Gregory and Ridley for their
valuable assistance, promptly and cheerfully rendered whenever
necessary; and have great pleasure in reporting the uniformly
steady good conduct of privates Lee and Buck,&mdash;the whole
being animated by the best spirit.</p>
<div style="text-align:right;"><small>Surveyor-General's Office,
Perth, 10th March, 1849.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></div>
<div><span class="a">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the honour to
report to his Excellency the Governor my return to head-quarters,
on the 2nd ultimo, with the expedition under my charge, which
left Perth on the 8th of September last, for the purpose of
exploring the interior country as far as the Russell range, in
accordance with instructions to that effect conveyed in your
letter to me, dated the 30th of the previous month. Those
instructions, I have the satisfaction to add, have been fully
carried out. The expedition examined and passed round the range,
and returned to Cape Riche, in 86 days, with the loss only of one
horse, although more than once threatened with the loss of all by
the dreadful nature of the country they had to force through on
the eastern route. The nature of our proceedings will, however,
be better understood by the following brief outline from my
journal, and by the accompanying tracing of the route which the
expedition followed. My letter of October 12th, from Cape Riche,
will have made you acquainted with our movements up to that date.
On the 14th of the same month, having rested those of our horses
that required it, supplied ourselves with materials for light
calico and dungaree tents, instead of the heavier ones we had
brought from Perth, and discarded every article we could possibly
dispense with, we took leave of our hospitable friends, Mr. and
Mrs. Cheyne, and started from Cape Riche with 90 days' supplies
for six persons, and 300lbs. of corn for the horses; the whole to
be carried by our 11 horses, which were to complete their bait at
the first well-grassed spot which appeared suited for the
purpose. Such a place presented itself on the 15th at
Y&#363;nganup on the P&#257;llinup river, and we remained there
until the morning of the 18th, completing our preparations. It is
in latitude 34° 24' 6" S., 15 miles N. by E. from Mr. Cheyne's
farm, and has a limited quantity of excellent grass in a small
valley tributary to the P&#257;llinup, which was here slightly
brackish, in long deep pools, 80 or 90 yards across, abounding
with black swans, ducks, and teal. While at the camp, a Cape
Riche native, known as "Bob", who had engaged to form one of our
party to the E., was visited by several of his friends from
Doubtful Island Bay, and other parts, including two who had
walked with him from what he represented to be the neighbourhood
of Middle Island; but as I could gather nothing more as to the
nature of the interior country than Bob himself was able to
communicate, I did not regret my inability to engage the
proffered services of one of the two who offered to accompany me
also, and who had previously accompanied Mr. Bland and Dr. von
Sommer to the neighbourhood of Mount Barren.</div>
<br>
<p>Dispatching by them to Cape Riche our final letters for the
Swan, with a suitable inducement to insure a safe delivery, we
began on the evening of the 18th to ascend the P&#257;llinup, in
the hope and belief it would lead us to the N.E. In 7 miles we
quitted the main river, coming in long open reaches from the
westward, between grassy banks, and ascended a branch coming from
the N.E., where we soon found ourselves amidst the white and red
sandstone cliffs of the coal formation, and continued so for the
next 6 miles, when we encamped just in time to escape the
severity of heavy stormy weather, which set in from the N.W. with
much rain. This continued and detained us in camp during next
day, a respite which was to myself personally acceptable, as I
had caught a violent cold by incautiously sleeping in wet
clothes. Whilst ascending this river we carefully examined every
accessible cliff for coal shales, but could discover no approach
to them, the strata in this place being apparently too remote,
and having no perceptible or decided dip in any direction.</p>
<p>Finding we were led too far N.W. by following up this branch,
we quitted it on the 21st, 13 miles further N., coming from the
N.N.W. through a valley of good soil and grass, 300 yards wide,
with scrub on each side; the channel being filled with granite
and whinstone, and the water high coloured, but brackish.
Kangaroo and emu numerous.</p>
<p>Steering N.E., we crossed several small fresh streams running
to the S., in good grassy valleys, and at noon, in lat. 34° 4'
S., came on one of large size, in a more considerable valley of
good soil, well grassed. It was running from N.N.W., rather
brackish, and, according to our native companion, flows into
Bremer Bay, 45 miles to the S.E. I did not therefore follow it,
leaving its further examination for my return W., should
circumstances then permit.</p>
<p>We had now decidedly left all indications of the coal
formation behind us, and were in a granite and quartz country of
greater elevation, sheets of the former spreading out on the
surface, and the latter blended with it. Pushing to the N.E. we
crossed several fresh tributaries of the above river, occupying
good grassy valleys, and encamped 10 miles further on, upon a N.
branch of the same river, fresh, in a grassy valley of good brown
soil, timbered with yeit, casuarina, and wattles. The former is a
species of the extensive eucalyptus family, with a dark rough
netted bark, and is always welcomed by the traveller as growing
in good soil, and amongst grass.</p>
<p>On passing over the first ridge on the following morning we
were gladdened by the view of a large tract of good grassy
country to the N.E., lightly timbered, and at this time well
watered by a river and its numerous branches. It is known to the
natives as Je&#275;r-a-mung-up. Entering upon it immediately, we
descended for 2½ miles by a well-grassed valley, with beautiful
lightly-wooded hills or slopes on either hand, and then reached
the main river, slightly brackish, in a granite rocky bed, and
scarcely running to the S.E. Grasses of the best description
filled its valley, and extended up the sides and over the tops of
the gently rising hills on each side, which, as well as the
valleys, were lightly wooded with yeit, casuarina, and black
wattles. Finding from Bob that this stream flowed S.E. to the
sea, near Middle Mount Barren, I left the lower part of it for
future examination, and traced upwards to the N.E. by E. amongst
rich grass and soil for 3 miles, when, finding the grassy breadth
decrease, and the river coming from the N.N.W., I proceeded up a
branch in a N.N.E. direction, and near the junction observed the
latitude at noon to be 33° 54' 52" S. Samphire and rushes filled
the bed of the stream, indicating a want of permanency in the
good water. This being Sunday, we encamped at one o'clock for the
remainder of the day, well satisfied at having seen between
12,000 and 15,000 acres of excellent grazing country during the
late 7½ miles of our journey, with a prospect of its being much
more extensive, especially downwards. Our native, who has crossed
this river near its mouth, reports the land there to be good,
which leaves room for a just inference that the intervening space
of 35 or 40 miles may be the same.</p>
<p>On the 23rd, I followed this branch upwards to the E.N.E. for
4 miles further, when the grass and water had gradually
diminished, so as to render its further examination of little
importance, and I again steered N.E., a cloudy observation at
noon giving the latitude about 33° 53½' S., and a high hill about
Mount Barren, bearing N. 104° E., 45 or 50 miles distant. The
country, as we proceeded, was poor and scrubby, with some
exceptions, and we encamped late on a chain of salt and brackish
pools, dipping E. in a country almost level.</p>
<p>Following these pools down next day, they soon joined a
continuous river of brackish water, between banks of granite or
sand 20 to 30 yards apart, coming from the N.N.W., and flowing E.
and S.E. through open scrubby plains; joining the river of the
22nd many miles lower down, according to the information of our
native. The weather, which had been very threatening during the
morning, drove us to an encampment earlier than usual, for after
two hours' rain the country was scarcely passable for the
horses.</p>
<p>Almost continuous rain from the S.E. quarter fell during the
remainder of this day, and on the 25th, frequently bogging our
horses in the hollow places while seeking their food. I did not
therefore attempt to break up the camp until the following
morning, when the wind had veered round to the S.W. and the rain
ceased. We then resumed our N.E. route, passing over for the most
part open sandy downs, or plains, separated by very dense
thickets, through which the axe was in frequent requisition to
clear a way for the horses. The country was high and level,
water-courses had disappeared, and their place had been supplied
by numerous small salt or samphire lagoons; upon one of the
former of which we were obliged to encamp, with nothing but long
coarse rushes for the horses, and brackish water, which oozed
into our wells. Water was, however, speedily supplied in
abundance by a most severe thunder-storm, which seemed to vent
its whole fury in the very midst of our little party, the
lightning darting through and amongst our tents in fearful
flashes, and the frequent deafening thunder-claps threatening the
destruction of everything around.</p>
<p>On the 27th the salt lakes and swamps increased in number and
size as we proceeded N.E.; but after 4 miles they ceased, and our
route lay up a long ascent to a country of much greater
elevation, but of poor quality, covered with scrub and dense
thickets, without timber. Thick showers following each other in
rapid succession greatly confined our view, but the surrounding
country for at least 2 or 3 miles appeared to be of the same
description. While despairing of being able to feed our horses
better than the night before we unexpectedly came on a small
fresh lake, surrounded by good grass in a clump of trees, and
gladly encamped there at once, having come upwards of 16 miles
since the morning without seeing either grass or water,
notwithstanding the rain, which had fallen nearly all day.</p>
<p>At 2 miles N.E. from our camp we were gratified at coming upon
some good grass and a deposit of rain-water in a clump of yeit
trees, and in observing the appearance of a small grassy granite
hill to the N. of our route;&mdash;circumstances in themselves
very trivial and unimportant in a general point of view, but to
us all-important, as giving promise that their recurrence would
afford us the means of sustaining our horses. We, however,
encountered nothing but scrub and thicket for the next 14 miles,
when we were again fortunate in discovering, amongst the many
places examined, some good grass and a native well in a clump of
yeit, where we immediately encamped.</p>
<p>By two stars on the meridian the latitude of this place was
33° 23' 6" S. I should gladly have set apart the next day
(Sunday, 29th October) as a day of rest for many reasons,
including that of drying our provisions, which had become very
wet on their passage, during the last 3 or 4 days, through the
rain and wet bushes; but independently of the small patch of good
grass immediately round our camp having been all eaten close off,
the weather continued too unsettled to hold out a prospect of my
being able to accomplish the desired object effectually, I
therefore moved on N.E. in the morning, and at the end of 2½
miles had an extensive view from the summit of a sandy plain of
the country in advance between N. by W. and N.E. by E. We were,
however, neither gratified nor encouraged by observing that, to
the distance of 16 or 18 miles, which limited our view, the
country appeared of the same description as that just passed
over, the extensive undulating plains being occasionally
diversified by dark lines of vegetation, probably only marking
the thickets which separated them. At 2 miles further N.E. we
came in sight of some extensive white sandy lakes 5 or 6 miles to
the N.W., evidently salt, as also of a lofty red granite hill at
the same distance, bearing N. 80° E. Despatching Messrs. Ridley
and Gregory to ascertain the nature of the lakes, I conducted the
party to the granite hill, which I had the pleasure to name Mount
Madden, in compliment to my friend the Colonial Secretary of
Western Australia, who had taken a warm interest in the
expedition. On my way I passed several large granite sheets, with
only short mossy grass about them, but abundance of rain-water
collected in the cavities, and in some places forming small
running streams, the result, probably, of the recent rains. A
clear open lake, 3 miles in length, was left a mile to the N.,
soon after which we crossed over, with considerable difficulty, a
broad wooded flat of 3 miles in width, evidently connected with
its waters during very wet seasons, but now dry and much
encumbered with dead trees and brushwood, both erect and
prostrate. A long and very fatiguing ascent of 1½ mile, through
close thickets or soft boggy land, brought us at length to the
base of the granite mass, where our disappointment was great at
finding only sufficient grass to give our horses a scanty feed
during the night. Messrs. Ridley and Gregory rejoined us soon
afterwards, having traced the salt lakes and their connecting
channels downwards to the one I had passed near, and found the
country about them scrubby and worthless. Ascending Mount Madden,
we found it a mass of solid red granite, J mile in length, and
from its summit caught a view of East Mount Barren, bearing N.
172° 15' E., nearly 50 miles distant, and again saw an
intermediate range, apparently granite, which we had first
observed in the evening. Its summit was now 15 miles distant in
the S.E., and received the name of Mount Short in honour of the
Bishop of South and Western Australia, who was expected at that
time to be making his first pastoral visit to Perth. The country
around our station did not present any very encouraging
appearance, the principal objects visible being sand plains and
thickets. The latitude of our camp was 33° 18' 14" S. On the 30th
we pushed on to the N.E. 12 miles, over sand plains and through
much close thicket, including the stubborn burnt sticks of last
year 6 to 8 feet high, which much impeded our progress, and tore
our clothes and packs. After searching many clumps of trees in
vain, we at length found good rain-water and excellent grass
among some burnt thicket, and encamped for the night.</p>
<p>Towards sunset of next day, after a fatiguing march of 23
miles through much thick country partially wooded, we were again
greatly favoured by coming most opportunely to a small shallow
lake, the water in which, although highly coloured by the clay
bed, was quite fresh. A little grass being scattered along the
margin, we encamped for the night. The latitude by two stars 32°
55' 20" S. On quitting this lake we entered immediately on a low
level bed connected with it, and trending to the E., about 600
yards in width, its well-defined banks being evidently waterworn
and flanked by thickets and dense scrub. Our hopes of a river
were, however, disappointed, for at the end of 1 mile the
unimportance of this channel was evident, and we quitted it,
while it took a S.E. and S. direction towards some extensive salt
lakes, which we afterwards saw within 20 miles of the spot. Red
and white sandstone cliffs, 15 feet in height, were here seen and
examined, but no dip or inclination could be perceived in them,
nor did they again appear as we proceeded N.E. Our distance at
this time of 80 miles from the sea-coast, with a very intricate
country intervening, would have rendered coal itself of little
value, had that mineral appeared.</p>
<p>On extricating ourselves from the thick country in this
neighbourhood, and rising the open sand plains beyond, we
obtained the first glimpse of a lofty bare granite peak 45 miles
to the E., appearing over the intervening scrubby wooded land
like the top of a huge sugar-loaf. A range of wooded hills of
less elevation was also seen 25 miles in the N.E., and to them we
first bent our way, as lying nearer our intended route; but the
further we advanced the worse became the country, the scrubs and
thickets were more dense, the sandy soil more stony, appearances
of grass less promising, and after a fatiguing march of 18 miles,
there was nothing better for our horses than coarse rushes and
scrub, without water.</p>
<p>Early the next day, November 2nd, we proceeded in our N.E.
course, and in 8 miles came upon an extensive series of salt
lakes and broad shallow channels, at least 2½ miles in width,
studded with many low rushy islands, and winding towards the
hills we had seen the day before in the N.E. On one of these
islands I halted our hungry horses for ½ an hour, to give them
the benefit of some grass there, which, although dry, was very
acceptable, and we plied our spade in vain in the most likely
places around for fresh water. All, however, was salt: the whole
country for several miles seemed one extensive salt basin or low
depressed plain, and to afford no chance of our finding in it the
article we stood so much in need of. As the day advanced I
quitted this salt region, and on keeping more E. came on good
grass in several situations, but could not halt upon it for want
of water,&mdash;our last chance was the range of hills for which
we had been steering&mdash;one of those we accordingly ascended,
passed several channels, quite dry, and were greatly disappointed
on reaching the summit, after sunset, to find it a collection of
loose quartz and whinstone, instead of granite sheets retaining
water. Forcing our way at once towards a deep valley beyond, the
darkness and almost impracticable thicket soon obliged us to
halt, and we tied our horses up short in a small clear space,
without a blade or drop of anything to give them. We were
ourselves much better off, having a pint of water each, the last
remains of our scanty stock. Markab, on the meridian, showed the
latitude of this bivouac to be 32° 37' 11" S., or about 90 miles
from the nearest part of the coast to the southward. Being now
fairly within the range, we could perceive it consisted of a
succession of steep narrow ridges of unequal elevation, covered
densely with thickets and small timber, and yielding no grass.
The soil was coloured a deep red by the ironstone at the surface,
but the principal rock in view was whinstone, with fragments of
quartz. This description seemed to apply to the whole of the
range, which apparently extended N.W. and S.E. about 6 miles,
with a width of about 3 or 4; but our view was very much confined
by the thickness of the wood, and I had to regret being unable to
catch even a slight glance at the country we had passed over, as
the setting sun was gleaming like burnished gold upon some open
water to the W. of our recent route, and would probably have
pointed out an extensive continuation of the salt lakes we had
encountered during the day. In remembrance of an excellent
officer, under whom I had formerly served in the navy, I named
this the Bremer Range, and its highest hill Mount Gordon.</p>
<p>Our horses having now been two days without water, and eating
but sparingly for want of it, I became anxious to obtain a supply
for them, and fortunately succeeded next morning by digging in a
small water-course we had followed down to the eastward. Here
their pressing thirst was in a slight degree alleviated by ½ a
bucket each of a red liquid, which was, nevertheless, fresh, and
before the heat of the day came on we fortunately found an
abundant supply of good water, in small pools in the midst of
thickets and scrub, where little expected. The rush of the poor
horses to it was so sudden and uncontrollable that they were all
in the midst of the pool in an instant; and two of them carrying
heavy loads were with difficulty unloaded and got out again. By
this time we had passed to the S. side of the range, and found a
continuation of the fresh pools in a water-course which descended
from its south-eastern slopes; there was, however, a total
absence of grass at this time, although there was reason to
believe some good grass had covered the hill-sides previous to
the last fires, which had swept all minor vegetation away, and
left standing only that close thicket and scrub we heartily
wished had shared the same fate.</p>
<p>Food for our half-famished horses being now the first
consideration, and there appearing little prospect of obtaining
it on a more northerly route, or of procuring fresh water in the
great salt valley to the S., I steered E.S.E. across tolerably
open sand-plains, towards the high granite peak we bad seen on
the 1st, which was 28 miles distant in the S.E. Anxiously did we
watch the progress we made towards the desired haven, doubting
not its being able to afford us the means of giving the party a
couple of days' rest, of which all the horses were sadly in need.
All our anxiety and exertions, however, could not accomplish our
wishes; the famished and exhausted animals, after a fatiguing
journey of nearly 24 miles to sunset, were unable to proceed any
further up a continued ascent, and we were compelled once more to
halt them for the night amidst coarse rushes and scrub, and
without any water, their existence appearing to depend on our
finding both water and grass on the morrow.</p>
<p>Algenib on the meridian gave the lat. 32° 52' 43" S., and our
distance from the granite peak was still 3 long up-hill
miles.</p>
<p>Commencing their ascent early next morning, the hill itself
was eventually reached, but all search for the means of keeping
our cattle alive was for a time fruitless. Both grass and water
were, however, found on the northern side; and there the party
encamped in the afternoon. I found it absolutely necessary to
remain here a few days for the recovery of the horses, several of
whom were so weak as to be scarcely able to stagger along with
their loads, or to be got on their legs again after falling. This
respite also enabled us to examine and dry the provisions and
stores, repair saddlery and clothes, and put in order our
saddlebags, which the recent thickets had almost reduced to
shreds. A short rest was also acceptable to the whole party. This
welcome retreat being at the most elevated and prominent mass of
land we had hitherto discovered on our journey, I named the whole
the Fitzgerald Peaks, the highest being distinguished as Peak
Charles, and another of proportionate elevation as Peak Eleanora.
The former is about 1000 feet above the surrounding plains, and
has some excellent grass on its eastern base. The view from this
peak, although very extensive, was by no means cheering. In every
direction lay spread out one vast sea of dark scrub and thicket,
intersected by broad belts of salt lakes and samphire marshes, to
the visible extent of 30 miles, and doubtless more, winding
through a country apparently almost level; the only exceptions
being the wooded range we had last quitted 35 miles to the N.W.,
and another range of similar appearance somewhat farther off in
the N.E. quarter. To the latter I felt most desirous of
proceeding next; but when I contemplated its apparent character
through a telescope, and glanced over the intermediate country, a
recollection that my horses had been 5 days without grass before
they reached Peak Charles, forbade me to compromise their safety,
and thereby to endanger the results of the expedition by making
the attempt. Having therefore sufficiently recruited them all,
with only one exception, and refitted our shattered equipments,
we launched out once more on the morning of the 9th of November,
into the frowning sea of scrub to the eastward, and soon came, as
expected, upon country which had not belied its appearance.</p>
<p>It may be sufficient merely to add that, after struggling with
this formidable country for 3 days, and by forced marches
accomplishing a distance of 50 miles E. from Peak Charles, the
expedition became almost entangled in a very extensive series of
salt lakes and marshes, one false move amongst which would have
proved its entire destruction. We had, however, fortunately come
upon a patch of good grass for the horses in the midst of this
universal waste, but they were sadly distressed for water, which
had only once been met with since leaving Peak Charles. At this
critical juncture it was found impossible to continue the
exploration further eastward until they could be recruited. For
this purpose, therefore, I began next day to work my way to the
S., in hopes of speedily emerging from the extensive salt country
in which we had hitherto encountered so many obstacles. No
improvement, however, took place for the next 12½ miles, at the
end of which we looked out upon a country of much less elevation
to the southward, and with great thankfulness welcomed the sight
of a considerable elevation to the S.E., which formed the only
break in the uniformly level horizon. It is scarcely necessary to
say that we instinctively turned towards this promising relief,
but as I looked across the intervening distance of apparently 30
miles, and at the same time contemplated the distress and
exhaustion of our cattle, I confess the result appeared doubtful.
We had not proceeded on our S.E. course more than 8 miles before
the horse for which I had most cause to fear was knocked
completely up, and unable to move another step. As he had only
previously carried an empty saddle it was speedily removed to
another, and to our great regret poor "Jack" was abandoned for
the present, in the hope that we might yet find both water and
grass within reasonable distance, and be able to recover him.
Three miles further on, another of my best horses (Ney) also gave
in, completely beat, and the rest were in a most pitiable
condition, for we had been totally unable to restrain them from
rushing into the salt lakes near which we passed, and from
drinking part of their contents before discovering their briny
quality. To avoid these lakes was impossible, the country being
so thick that they were not seen until a few yards distant. As
the sun was now near the horizon, and I was extremely unwilling
to lose this second horse without some further effort for his
recovery, the party were encamped on the spot, after a most
trying day's journey of more than 23 miles, but once more without
either grass or water. A kind Providence, however, which had
already relieved us in many a difficulty, again interposed in our
behalf, and by means of a light rain, which fell for 2 hours
during the early part of the night, enabled us to collect with
our tin plates, from the surrounding bushes, sufficient water to
give the two weakest horses 1½ gallons each, and the remainder a
quart a-piece. This proved most welcome and seasonable after
having been 3 days and nights without a drop of anything but
brine. We were also enabled to replenish our own small stock.
This day we passed over, in lat. 33° 8' S., long. 121° 52' E.,
the dry beds of several salt lakes formed of the white and dark
red sandstones belonging to the coal formation. They were very
mottled and confusedly mixed, and had numerous veins of hard
ironstone running through them, similar in appearance to the
sandstone, which we afterwards saw in close connection with coal
and shales.</p>
<p>Striking our light dungaree tents at 3 o'clock next morning
(Nov. 13), we got away early on our S.E. route, the horses
appearing somewhat revived; but their frequent falling and
stumbling betrayed their extreme weakness, and at the end of 4
miles Ney, from utter inability to proceed, was again left
behind. With many regrets he was here left, and we pushed on, the
day becoming very warm and oppressive. Every obstacle was,
however, finally overcome, and at 3 o'clock I had the
satisfaction to encamp the party once more in a desirable spot,
at the east end of the hill for which we had been steering, and
to which I gave the name of Mount Ridley, after one of my
companions, to whom I felt greatly indebted for his prompt and
valuable aid on all occasions which required it. Indeed the whole
party were actuated by the best spirit, and I need not say it was
fully taxed in meeting all their privations and difficulties.
Next day Messrs. Ridley and Gregory, with the native Bob, brought
Ney once more into camp, but in such an exhausted condition as to
render another day's halt necessary for his partial recovery. I
regretted this the more as the grass around Mount Ridley was
scanty and poor, and I hoped to obtain it of much better quality
at some other hills of similar character, which appeared at the
distance of 25 to 40 miles further eastward. From the summit of
the Mount, which is a huge mass of bare granite a quarter of a
mile in length, and about 700 feet above the surrounding plains,
several hills of similar description were visible to the
southward and eastward, but in every other direction was spread
out one illimitable sea of frowning scrub and thicket, with
extensive chains of salt and samphire flats and lakes too
numerous to particularise, and bounded by a distant horizon as
unbroken as that of the sea itself.</p>
<p>Much of our time was now taken up in attending to the horses'
backs and sides, which were sadly galled by their saddles. The
leather and canvas of their appointments were also bad, and
required constant repairs, which were rapidly consuming the small
quantity of materials we had taken with us for the purpose.</p>
<p>Having, by the evening of the 15th, completed all pressing
repairs, and weeded our baggage of every article that could
possibly be dispensed with, we again pushed forward to the
eastward early next morning, Ney with only an empty saddle. His
powers of endurance had however been over estimated, for at the
end of 15 miles they again failed, and he could move no further.
Giving him a portion of the water we carried, Messrs. Ridley and
Gregory's offer to remain and bring him on after us was accepted,
and I made for the nearest granite hill, which was then 9 miles
distant to the S.E., rising like all the others out of extensive
level flats of salt lakes and thickets. With a star for our guide
we groped our way after dark through the thick brushwood, and
finally reached the hill at 9 o'clock, turning the tired horses
loose to find the best feed they could. Water we had already
passed through, in thick tea-tree swamps, nearly up to their
knees, and next morning an excellent spring well was found at the
eastern foot of the hill, amongst luxuriant grasses of the best
description. Thither we immediately removed from the rocky
unsheltered bivouac we had been compelled to take up for the
previous night, and soon afterwards the absentees returned,
having been unable to bring on Ney nearer than 4 miles: at noon
the attempt was renewed, aided by our two water-kegs and a bag of
good grass; but when night closed in the poor animal was still a
quarter of a mile from the camp, utterly unable to move another
step, and it was not until next morning that he could be brought
in. As both grass and water were abundant at this limited spot, I
determined on leaving him here to have a chance of recovering
from his exhaustion, and of being called for again on our return
homewards by a more southerly route. I could scarcely bring
myself to regret the delay of a day thus caused, as the horses
were greatly benefited by being in such good quarters; numerous
repairs were again made to our torn saddle-bags, and I was
afforded an opportunity of obtaining an extensive round of angles
to a numerous assemblage of distant granite hills which covered
the horizon between E. and S.W. The most interesting of these to
us was the Russell Range, which now for the first time came in
sight 50 miles to the eastward, in lofty and rugged outline,
cheering us with a far-off prospect of the eastern limit of the
country I had been instructed to examine.</p>
<p>Although so near, however, there was no mistaking the nature
of the intervening country, which was desolate and cheerless in
the extreme, presenting no more friendly granite hills at which
we could hope to keep our horses alive, and even the misty range
itself caused many a doubt in my mind as to the nature of so huge
a mass of rock, rising abruptly out of a sea of scrub. The whole
northern horizon between this range and Mount Ridley was unbroken
by a single hill, to the distance of 30 to 40 miles, and was
covered with salt lakes and dense scrub on a gradual northerly
ascent. Here, on the evening of the 17th, we viewed with peculiar
interest, from our elevated position of 400 feet above the
surrounding plains, a lengthened exhibition of the mysterious
southern lights which, for more than an hour, darted or flashed
upwards in rapid succession to the height of 20 degrees above the
horizon, through a reddish glare, resembling the loom of a
distant conflagration, but which was in all probability caused by
the extreme haziness of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The huge mass of granite, 200 feet above our camp, which had
thus so opportunely afforded a refuge to our favourite horse,
having been named after him Mount Ney, we suspended his saddle in
a tree, and once more launched forth eastward into the formidable
country before us, relying on a continuance of that aid and
protection which had hitherto been so conspicuously extended
towards us. Nor had we overrated the nature of the obstacles
which now opposed our progress. At first we were flattered into
hope by some relaxation in the density of the scrub, but as we
persevered on our way towards a small granite hill where I hoped
to obtain grass and water, numerous salt lakes again obtruded
their unwelcome presence, bound and joined by thickets so close
and densely matted together, as frequently to call our axes into
requisition before the horses could move on. This belt of salt
and scrub, 5 or 6 miles wide, which occupied the lowest part of a
valley trending to E. by S., being passed, and a passage forced
through the close thickets which covered the opposite ascent, our
poor horses could do no more, and were gladly conducted at the
end of 15 J miles to their promised rest and feed. Here, however,
not a blade of grass rewarded our minutest search, and only a few
pints of water were lodged in holes in the rock. Some flags and
coarse rushes occupied the place of better feed, and among these
the horses were tethered to do their best, water being
fortunately found by digging near the N.E. foot of the granite
rock.</p>
<p>Quitting this inhospitable retreat as early as possible next
morning (Nov. 19), we again steered E. through thicket and scrub
growing in light soil, and at the end of 6½ miles came suddenly
upon a small fire which had just been abandoned by some natives.
The embers were under my feet before they were discovered, and
the country was so thick that I did not immediately perceive near
them several long bark baskets, tied up at the extremities, and
filled with honey-flowers, which the natives had been employed in
collecting. Their retreat was so hasty that they had even left
behind two carved and well-greased "wommeras", used in
discharging their spears, nor could they be induced, by the loud
calls and invitations of our native, to return and give us an
interview. We therefore placed some biscuit in their baskets,
left everything as we found it, and proceeded on our way; Bob
being of opinion that they either had taken us for devils and
would never venture near the spot again, or that they were
concealed at the time within very few yards of it. We had on
several occasions reason to suppose that the natives were aware
of our vicinity as we passed through the country, and were even
watching our movements; but we saw none of them at this time, nor
could we succeed on other occasions in bringing on any interview,
although we purposely passed over tracts of country in which
their tires were burning. On such occasions we saw footmarks on
the sand of men, women, and children, though not of numerous
tribes, and observed their signal smokes rise suddenly up within
a mile and a half of us soon after we had passed.</p>
<p>Although the country still continued to be densely thicketed,
it lost its generally flat character, and raised our hopes of a
change,&mdash;for fresh water had lodged in no less than three
places met with this day, showing the more clayey nature of the
soil; the salt lakes seemed to have been left behind, and a
gradual rise was perceptible in the undulations, which on their
ridges had an outcrop of granite. A change for the worse appeared
however in the scrubs, which became even more close than before,
and contained considerable quantities of a broad-leaved stubborn
eucalyptus, that would not readily yield a passage. At sunset we
encamped once more without grass or water, but our hungry horses
consumed the bark off every tree, and the top off every bush
within their reach, some of them even eating the dry sticks under
their feet.</p>
<p>Early on the next day's march we were fortunate enough to fall
in with a small pool of fresh water, and 6 miles further on our
famished animals were revelling in a beautiful patch of excellent
though somewhat dry grass, growing amongst yeit-trees in a
circular flat 300 yards in diameter, having found nothing better
than flags and rushes at the low granite hill for which we had
been steering for the last 21 miles. We hailed this additional
change in the features of the country with much satisfaction,
good grass being invariably found amongst the yeit, in a better
description of soil. Although the day was yet young I felt
compelled to encamp here for the sake of the horses, several of
whom had fallen during the morning from absolute weakness. From
one of these, who had thus fallen, and had staked himself badly
in his ineffectual struggles to rise, a rough piece of dead wood
was extracted 4½ inches long and three-fourths of an inch in
diameter.</p>
<p>Amongst the changes perceptible hereabouts we observed a
greater variety than heretofore in the nature and qualities of
the soil, which, from a general light sandy character amongst the
salt lakes and samphire marshes, had now become more clayey and
loamy, and altogether of a better description. It was also
satisfactory to find we were traversing a country capable of
retaining fresh water at its surface, for so little rain had
fallen of late that we found the granite rocks were no longer to
be so fully relied on as formerly for those supplies, which we
had hitherto chiefly expected to procure from them. As we
advanced eastward next day the country was found more undulating,
and occasionally broken into large granite sheets, round one of
which near our last camp was some good grass, but the general
surface continued densely thick, and sorely tried our weary and
exhausted animals, for whom I greatly wished to procure a few
days' rest and good feed. At the end of 13 miles they could go no
further, and I was compelled to halt them once more in the tall
scrub, with nothing better than rushes, and without any water;
nor did we prove successful in procuring any of the latter by
digging. Climbing a granite ridge immediately over our camp, I
looked out with much anxiety over the desolate space of not more
than 20 miles, which still lay between us and Russell Range, and
turned over in my mind a list, far too long, of those horses
which I feared would never have strength to reach it. Granite
hills were abundant to the southward, within the same distance,
but I cared nothing for them at the time, and to the N. the
interminable frowning scrubs presented an aspect anything but
cheering. The only relief appeared in a small granite hill 16
long miles to the E., and as it was in the direction of our
intended route, I launched out for it early next morning, relying
on a kind Providence, and the unsubdued spirit and energy of my
little party, for aid. The poor horses staggered up to their
saddles with a despondency and aspect which seemed to upbraid us
with their treatment, and I felt glad to escape from the
misgivings which their appearance created by commencing the toils
of the journey-I should most gladly have reconnoitred in advance
on such occasions, but in so fearful a country delays were
utterly inadmissible, and to have halted the party would have
been certain destruction to the whole. Thus were we hurried on
from day to day, without its being possible to give the wearied
horses that rest which was almost indispensable to their very
existence.</p>
<p>Travelling now became difficult in the extreme. To avoid
sapling thickets, 12 to 15 feet high, so closely packed that axes
only could have opened a passage, we were compelled to take a
more circuitous route round them, and to force a way through
scrubs of a more yielding character. These were frequently so
dense that at the distance of 3 or 4 feet no part of a horse
could be seen, and the greatest care and watchfulness were
necessary to keep them close together and in line. This work,
however, could not last long; and when half way to the granite
hill, four of the horses gave convincing proofs of their
inability to proceed another mile, by streaming out in those
profuse cold sweats which are always the forerunner of a complete
and fatal break up. Thankful for the warning, the party was
halted, the complaining horses unloaded, and arrangements
immediately made for leaving behind everything that could
possibly be dispensed with, including the whole of our salt meat,
which had formed the entire load of one horse; but it was no easy
matter to decide what in our situation could best be abandoned,
our equipment being as light as possible, and without a single
article that could in any view be deemed superfluous. Some little
time was necessarily occupied in completing these arrangements;
and our salt meat was about to be triced up to the trees destined
to receive it, when the horses appeared so much revived by their
short respite that I resolved to make one more trial to get on
without the adoption of measures which might materially cripple
the ultimate proceedings of the expedition. Distributing the
loads, therefore, in proportion to the ability to carry weight,
and every horse carrying a pack, we cheered them on as well as we
could; kept them ail moving and in close line; and late in the
afternoon halted at the foot of the hill where we had hoped to
obtain relief. Here, however, we again met with nothing but cruel
disappointment,&mdash;not a blade of grass was to be found either
over or around the hill; and a flattering appearance of water
proved to be a mere trickling over a large bare granite sheet,
scarcely sufficient to wet its surface. Encamping among some
rushes and scrub at this spot, in the vain hope of procuring
water with our spade, the horses were suffered to roam about the
hill, and pick up what they could find, while I climbed to its
summit for a view of the surrounding country. Cheerless, indeed,
was that view, and serious were the apprehensions forced upon me
for the safety of the whole of the horses, in whose existence was
likewise involved that of the party placed under my charge. At
the distance of only four miles, the precipitous mass of rock
composing the Russell Range rose abruptly, in a bare naked mass,
to the height of 600 feet out of the surrounding scrubby plains,
and not a blade of grass or the least appearance of fresh water
was anywhere to be seen. Thickets and scrub, interspersed with
sand-plains and salt-lakes, covered the face of the country,
except where numerous granite hills disturbed the uniformity of
the southern horizon, like so many bare rocky islands rising
abruptly out of the sea. We had observed natives' smokes rising
up about this spot from a distance, or I should now have left all
our heaviest articles and hastened our dying horses on until I
found both food and water for them; but not caring to run so
great a risk of losing our provisions, and feeling that one false
move in our critical situation would compromise the safety of the
whole party, the last of the small quantity of water we had
carried was shared out for breakfast; and early on the morning of
the 23rd the party was moving on to ascertain the worst.</p>
<p>Making for the nearest part of the range, the bush became
fortunately more open, and freely admitted the passage of our
exhausted and desponding animals, who staggered along under their
loads as if it were the last effort they could make. Our greatest
present anxiety was to keep them from falling or lying down; as,
when once down, they were with great difficulty got on their legs
again. Finding, on a nearer approach to the range, that we had
not been deceived as to its utter sterility on this side, we
hastened towards a clump of yeit and casuarina trees at the S.
end, and there, to our great joy, found abundance of excellent
grass in a small thickly-wooded ravine, the bottom of which was
occupied by a small rocky water-course. Here the party were
immediately encamped: the horses required no bidding to feed
after their long abstinence; and while one party was dispatched
round the E. side of the range in search of water, another plied
the spade in those spots giving most promise of it. Leaving one
man to keep the camp, I then followed up the water-course in the
ravine. This, however, proved most unprofitable; and after much
scrambling and climbing was found to issue from a small deep
cavern in the mountain, so defended by thicket and tangle as to
be scarcely approachable. It was quite dry, and the spade
produced lower down only a very small quantity of brackish water,
of a yellow colour. That water was somewhere in the neighbourhood
there appeared little doubt, by several natives' fires having
started up at little more than a mile from us; and we were
discussing a plan for beating up their quarters when Lee and Bob
returned from their excursion round the range with the joyful
news that they had found a splendid run of excellent water near
its N.E. extremity, with grass in the same neighbourhood.
Reloading, we lost no time in proceeding to the spot; and I had
once more the gratification of encamping in a situation where the
horses could recruit their exhausted energies, and prepare for
the remainder of their journey. No sight could have been more
welcome to us at the moment than this beautiful run of pure cool
fresh water, cascading down from the highest part of the range
immediately above, and forming various lodgments in small clear
pools, in which several of the poor horses immersed nearly their
entire heads.</p>
<p>Although the feed hereabouts was neither first rate nor
abundant, I felt it necessary to remain 4 days to recruit and
refit, and had the satisfaction to find our stud improve rapidly
in spirit, although not much in appearance. The rest was of most
essential service, not only to their weary limbs but to their
sore backs, in the constant attention to which neither time nor
labour was spared.</p>
<p>Every effort was made to remedy the defects in our pony
packsaddles, to make them fit better; but we could effect little
real good in this respect beyond fresh arranging their padding.
Our saddle-bags were also in so dilapidated a state, that we were
almost at our wits' ends for devising the means of making them
hold together.</p>
<p>While these operations were in progress I lost no opportunity
of collecting materials for my survey of the country, adding to
the collections of geology, botany, &amp;c., and making as many
astronomical observations as our limited stay and the state of
the heavens would permit.</p>
<p>The result of the latter showed that by four different stars a
lofty flat-topped peak near the N.E. end of the range under which
we had encamped was in latitude 33° 27' 15" S., and longitude by
chart 123° 24' E.; the variation of the magnetic needle by means
of 9 azimuths being 2° 46' W.</p>
<p>On ascending the peak this section of the range was found to
consist of a sharp narrow ridge of rugged steep rocks, about 1½
miles in length, N. by E. and S. by W., with sides rising in many
parts at an angle of less than 45° to the summit. Having seen no
peak that better deserves the name, I conclude this to be the
hill which Mr. Eyre, the discoverer of the Russell Range from the
coast, called Mount Ragged. It is a somewhat loose mass of
laminated quartz and micaceous schist, dipping to the W. by N.,
at an angle of 7° or 8° from the vertical, and intersected by
numerous quartz veins traversing the mount in various directions.
The summit is about 600 feet above the base; and the latter 400
feet above the level of the surrounding limestone plains. Several
remarkable transverse rents are also observable, extending from
the summit to its base, and combining with other appearances to
lead to a belief that the whole mass is rapidly breaking up. The
other hills of this range are of similar aspect and composition,
but are of less elevation, and lie in a detached group, 4 or 5
miles to the N.E.; the intermediate and surrounding country being
covered as before with thickets and scrub, presenting a horizon
30 miles distant, in the N.E. and N.W. quarters unbroken by a
single rise. In the opposite quarter appeared the mighty ocean,
studded with many islands of the Recherche Archipelago, and
numerous reefs, both covered and dry. The low sandy coast about
Point Malcolm seemed to be not more than 15 miles distant in the
S.E.; and numerous fires of the natives smoked up amongst its
sand-hills, and along the coast farther to the N.E.; behind which
rose some granite hills of considerable elevation, similar to
those which now appeared in view behind Capes Pasley and Arid.
Amongst them I directed my glass long and attentively, but in
vain, in the hope of discovering some inducement for prolonging
my journey to the eastward; for although I had then the
satisfaction of standing upon the spot pointed out in my
instructions as the eastern limit for present exploration, I
should not have hesitated to exercise a discretion in proceeding
farther E., had appearances and prospects in the least encouraged
an advance. Such, however, was unfortunately not the case; not
the least sign of a grassy tract of country appeared in any
direction, and our horses had already had too much taken out of
them to warrant my further risking their lives, by prolonging the
examination of so fearful and impracticable a country. They had
already traversed fully 1000 miles of country since leaving the
Swan River, and had as much more in prospect before they could
reach it again.</p>
<p>From this point, therefore, I determined on returning to Cape
Riche by a more southerly route, for the purpose of intercepting
and examining any rivers or streams that might fall into the S.
coast.</p>
<p>On the 28th November, the horses having been sufficiently
recruited, and all practicable repairs effected in our clothes
and appointments, we commenced our return, passing from one to
another of various hills composed of granite and gneiss, which we
had noticed from the interior, and generally finding around them
sufficient grass and water for our purposes. Grass trees and
zamiæ were again met with at less than 20 miles from the Russell
Range, as also the Kangaroo, which afforded us a welcome relief
from our long salt diet.</p>
<p>The soil of the country we now passed over was generally of a
light sandy character; but it improved as we proceeded W., and
encountered the novelty of numerous open fresh lakes, rushy
lagoons, and abundance of fresh water, in a country lying low and
level. Clumps of yeit trees scattered about it afforded our
horses plenty of grass, and we had the satisfaction of seeing
them improve daily in spirit and condition; for the country was
more open and accessible, and gave us reason to hope all
formidable scrubs had been left behind.</p>
<p>Fragments of limestone, of oolitic formation and variegated
colours, were in many places abundantly scattered over the
surface; and the same rock frequently formed the basis of the low
rocky ridges which traversed the level country between the
granite hills. The latter were usually bare, naked masses of
close solid granite or gneiss, 300 to 500 feet above the
surrounding plains, from which a sloping platform ascended for ½
mile to the base of the bare rock. These hills frequently
presented the extraordinary appearance of deep yawning rents or
fissures, 3 inches to 1 foot in width across their entire
breadth, some being open, but the greater part filled up with
loose stones and rubbish. The rock itself was too compact and
solid to exhibit much dip or stratification; but wherever any
such were observable, the dip seemed to be to the S.S.E., at an
angle of 20° from the vertical. We found occasion also to observe
more than once that the huge masses of rock, of which these hills
were composed, had, from some unknown cause, probably
subterranean, undergone a complete and violent disruption; and
that whilst one end of a mountain mass would be piled up in a
confused heap of immense boulders, its opposite extremity would
repose in broad smooth sheets of almost unbroken rock. Whether
such appearances have been occasioned by subterranean fire or
merely exhibit the wreck of once lofty peaks, I feel unable to
say; such hills had evidently in former ages been of considerably
greater dimensions. Those met with on the eastern part of our
journey could never be relied on for affording feed for our
horses.</p>
<p>On the 2nd December, having reached a lofty and remarkable
granite hill, 50 miles S.W. of the Russell Range, which I named
Ho wick Hill, in reference to the nobleman at the head of
colonial affairs, we were then 25 miles abreast of Mount Ney, and
I determined on sending for our valued horse, if found alive and
able to travel. Accordingly Messrs. Ridley and Gregory, who had
volunteered their service, were dispatched to Mount Ney on the
two best horses we had, while I conducted the party to some grass
and water which we had passed in a low swamp 3 miles back, the
country for many miles round being tolerably level, and covered
with very thick prickly scrub, knee high, closely matted, and
difficult to get through. Large clumps of nuytria floribunda
(cabbage-tree), mixed with melaleuca (tea-tree), both of stunted
and gnarled growth, were now scattered about, and formed the
nearest approach to timber we had seen for 350 miles. Stagnant
water was plentiful, but grass very scarce, wiry, and coarse. The
total failure of even this supply obliged me on the 4th to remove
the horses to another and more grassy spot which we had
discovered in our rambles, 2 miles farther to the S.W.; and I
should gladly have moved the entire camp also, had I not feared
our absent companions might thereby miss us altogether, had they
travelled after dark to rejoin us. The necessity for shifting our
camp was urgent; for, independent of the grass and feed being
closely eaten off, one by one of our little water-holes had been
dried up, leaving half a bushel of tadpoles, 1 inch long, at the
bottom; and our bowels and limbs were affected by the unhealthy
low situation. Intending to leave a notice of our position, we
were preparing to start from this residence of fever and ague
while we had the power to do so, when, to our great joy, the
absentees returned late in the day, with Ney in company. His
respite of 15 days had improved him wonderfully, though he still
gave too abundant evidence of continued weakness; but this, I
trusted, some indulgence would overcome. During our stay at the
camp the weather was too cloudy to admit of my obtaining any
astronomical observations beyond what enabled me to ascertain
that the variation was only 0° 12' westerly. Musquitoes and large
biting flies were exceedingly abundant and troublesome.</p>
<p>On the 5th we gladly moved westward once more, the horses much
recruited by the respite they had been afforded, and by the
attention we had been enabled to bestow on their sore backs.</p>
<p>No material alteration took place in the face of the country.
It continued nearly level, but with slight undulations of low
limestone ridges, among which were many small fresh lakes, with
occasional clumps of yeit, affording good grass and water.</p>
<p>On the 7th we were abreast of Esperance Bay, and encamped at
the foot of a high granite hill, 15 miles N. from Cape-le-Grand,
from the summit of which a crowd of lofty granite islands and
rocks were observed to rise abruptly out of the sea, together
with some covered rocks and reefs, which will render great
caution necessary, on the part of the vessels frequenting the
bay.</p>
<p>The shore of the latter is sandy for several miles back, and
numerous lakes, apparently salt, were observed to lie behind its
northern beach. Around our camp were many huts and recent
fire-places of the natives: and large smokes were curling up 3 or
4 miles to the westward, showing the country to be somewhat
better peopled. This hill, being a very remarkable object at a
distance of 40 miles, I named Mount Merivale, after one of the
Under Secretaries of State for the Colonies; and a similar hill,
15 miles to the eastward, Mount Hawes. While taking a round of
angles from the summit of the former, Mr. Ridley, who was
breaking off samples of the rock, discovered in one of very white
formation some remarkable veins and streaks of a light blue
colour, which led to further examination, and to our quarrying to
as great a depth as we could penetrate with the tools in our
possession. All our sanguine hopes of copper, however, fell to
the ground by finding, on our return to the camp, that the best
specimens would not respond to the established tests.</p>
<p>To the W. of Mount Merivale we crossed several streams of
brackish water, running in shallow channels, from 1 to 20 yards
wide, towards the lakes behind Esperance Bay. These were the
first watercourses we had met with for 400 miles; the
surface-water of the country, where occurring at all, being found
in holes amongst the granite rocks, in small rushy lagoons or
open lakes, and occasionally in lodgments in the more clayey
descriptions of soil amongst the thick scrub of the interior. In
the latter situations were also frequently seen many circular
spaces, 5 to 10 yards in diameter, in which the interior
rain-waters had subsided, and which answered the description of
Dr. Leichhardt's "melon-holes". From this time until we arrived
abreast of the western group of the Recherche Archipelago, salt
lakes were of frequent occurrence immediately behind the
sea-coast hills, and yielded the only food for our horses which
this part of the country was likely to afford us; nor was this at
all abundant or easily found on the route I pursued. Mr. Eyre
had, in 1841, generally found abundance both of water and grass
hereabouts for his horses, immediately behind the coast hills;
but I was desirous of avoiding all former tracks as much as
possible, and, with respect to the nature of the country further
inland, some natives we fell in with gave me to understand that
nothing was to be met with there but scrub and salt lakes.</p>
<p>On the 10th we had, in search for grass, so worked our way
amongst numerous salt and fresh lakes and swamps, and the narrow
ridges of steep limestone hills which divided them, that it was
not without some difficulty we extricated ourselves next day, and
gained the less intricate country which bordered them on the N.
The travelling was, however, bad, and very trying to our wearied
horses, both on account of the steepness of the ridges, and their
rocky rugged nature. We were, therefore, not sorry to find grass
increase as we proceeded over more accessible slopes, and that in
one patch it was of excellent quality to the extent of 300 acres.
Hopes being raised, toil no longer felt oppressive, and, before
noon, we were once more gladdened by the sight of an open deep
river, 15 yards wide, extending directly across our course.
Clamps of nuytria and yeit were scattered about, zamiæ of
gigantic size grew near the steep banks, and tolerable grass
among dwarf grass trees extended back from 2 to 400 yards.
Numerous ducks and black swans were constantly disturbed as we
ascended the river in its course from the northward, but we found
to our regret that the bed rapidly diminished in importance. At
first the banks were frequently broken into steep yellow and red
cliffs, indicating a proximity to the coal formation; but these
gradually disappeared, and, in less than 3 miles, the narrow
rocky bed was composed entirely of granite or gneiss, and the
water in it was still brackish; the soil a light sandy loam. The
day being warm and oppressive, with a land-wind from the N.W.,
and the thermometer at 104° in the coolest spot I could find, I
took advantage of fresh water being found in the tributaries and
swamps of this vicinity, and halted until 3 o'clock, amongst good
grass in a clump of yeit trees. As we had expected, a
thunderstorm began to brew in the N.W., which came on so rapidly
that before we could secure ourselves in another camping place we
had taken up for the night, it burst with great violence, and
completely drenched us. Next day we traced this stream upwards to
the total distance of 13 miles N.N.E., when, finding it took us
so much to the eastward, and-that the grass in its neighbourhood
had considerably diminished in quantity, I left it coming from
the N.E. in several branches, the valleys of which were narrow
but grassy, and drained extensive elevated plains of poor and
worthless character. Its mouth is near the spot where Captain
Flinders records on his chart "there is a white streak in the
sand-hills", and on its banks we occasionally observed some rich
and very good soil. Kangaroo were abundant, and we frequently
noticed traces of emu, but our only dog was so pitiably foot-sore
as to be quite incapable of catching anything, nor could he be
induced to keep on, even for ten minutes, the various leather
boots we made for his relief. Naming this river the Gore, we
quitted it about 16 miles from the coast, and crossed a western
branch, as we steered westward over open scrubby downs, drained
by small watercourses or lakes, containing either salt or
brackish water. After a harassing march of 22 miles, we were
fortunately enabled to encamp on the 12th amongst tolerable feed
on the borders of a lake, perfectly fresh, and about
three-fourths of a mile in diameter.</p>
<p>Five miles further westward over similar country brought us to
the abrupt rocky banks of another river, with a samphire-bed 70
or 80 yards wide, in which were pools of salt water 20 yards by 6
or 7, but not a vestige of grass. As no inducement presented
itself for following this river up to the N.N.E., I proceeded at
once down to its bed to the southward, came soon to good grass
where the banks opened out, and in less than 3 miles encamped in
the midst of abundance of it and of drinkable water at the
junction of several branches, some of which were observed to have
cut their way through white, yellow, and red cliffs. While the
horses took the benefit of their early halt, I minutely examined
the cliffs and their vicinity, in company with Mr. Ridley; but
although there was every appearance of their forming a portion of
the carboniferous series, we could discover no shales nor any
rocks in which could be traced a decided dip or inclination of
the strata. In the evening the latitude by Menkar was found to be
33° 44' 8" S.</p>
<p>On the 14th of December we resumed our examination down the
river, eagerly examining every accessible cliff we met, but
discovering no shales. Granite or gneiss&gt; with a large portion
of hornblende in it, was in contact with these cliffs, and did
not raise our immediate hopes of coal; nevertheless, at ½ a mile
from the mouth of the river, a mass of dark red sandstone
projected from its right bank into a deep navigable reach 70
yards across, and indicated a closer proximity to the object of
our search. The water was here quite salt, and about 20 feet
deep, tenanted by many fine large fish, resembling bream, upwards
of a foot in length, which resisted the most tempting inducements
we could hold out to them to take bait. Below this spot, the
shores both of the river and of a fine large estuary which
received it were low and sandy, and no more sandstone was seen to
crop out upon them.</p>
<p>In less than a mile from the mouth of this river, our western
course was arrested by the open deep reach of another, at least
250 yards across, coming from the northward, and flowing into the
same estuary. Having ascertained that its mouth, which was ¼ of a
mile lower down, and divided into two open channels, was not
fordable, I commenced its examination upwards. The low level
banks soon rose to more undulating land, of light sandy
character, clothed with some good grass, extending half a mile
back, and growing among nuytriæ, gigantic zamiæ, yeit, tea-trees,
Jacksoniæ, &amp;c. In less than 3 miles the width of the open
water had contracted to 100 yards, and a considerable peninsula,
thickly covered with high grass, was projected by it to the
eastward. Hereabouts several large grassy tributaries were added,
and, a little higher up, a dry rocky ledge connecting the two
banks obliquely, enabled us to cross to the right bank. The land
on that side, however, was found to be so rocky and steep that we
soon afterwards re-crossed, and finally encamped on one of the
above tributaries, at the first fresh-water hole we had found in
connection with the river. Grass was here in ample sufficiency
for our wants, and the river itself, which had now dwindled to a
very brackish tea-tree brook, 5 yards across, wound its tortuous
way through a well-grassed flat ¼ to ½ a mile wide. Red cliffs
occasionally broke out on the hill-sides thus far, and the land
on either side of the river's valley had all the flat-topped
appearance of the sandstone formation; but granite or gneiss was
the prevailing rock on the lower levels, with occasional veins of
quartz through it to the thickness of a foot. All our spare time
was now directed to the horses' backs and feet, for the former
required constant attention, especially to protect them from the
flies, whilst many of their shoes were loose, and some cast
altogether. To make good these defects in so rough a country as
that we were in was most essential, but the practical knowledge
of farriery amongst the whole party was only small; necessity
proved, as usual, an excellent assistant in overcoming
difficulties, and, without laming a single horse, Mr. Gregory
soon became a practical farrier.</p>
<p>On essaying to follow up the river on the 15th, so many
branches here fell in that it was not easy to decide on the
principal one, but in such a case I deferred to the native's
judgment, and kept to a valley coming from the N.N.W. At the end
of a mile, a larger tributary than usual, containing considerable
pools of open water, joined from the eastward, and appeared to me
to be the main branch; for that which we followed to the N.N.W.
soon diminished in importance, and ascended rapidly in a rough
granite bed, between somewhat steep rocky banks. Although grass
still covered the slopes of the narrow valley which contained the
river, the latter was so much reduced in size and character that
I deemed it no longer worth following, and at 10 miles from its
mouth quitted it for the purpose of making a further examination
of the estuary; and as that neighbourhood promised well for coal,
I was desirous of ascertaining what facilities existed for its
transport by water. Where I quitted this river it was coming from
the N.W., and lay in irregular rocky pools, nearly salt. The
stratified gneiss rock of dark glittering appearance, which here
formed the basis of the country, was observed to lie in the
direction of the magnetic meridian, with a decided dip to the
eastward of about 15° from the vertical. Fragments of red
sandstone, several inches square, lay on the surface near our
rocky bridge, and contained many perfect impressions of bivalve
shells. Crossing to the right bank by the rocky bridge, we came
out on the estuary by some good grassy slopes near its mouth,
passed close to an open salt lake which appeared to have some
connection with it, across a very narrow dividing neck of land,
and then, proceeding westward, traversed open treeless plains ½ a
mile behind the shore, covered with somewhat coarse grass, and
drained by a small stream-bed, now in pools and
slightly-brackish.</p>
<p>The grass improved both in quantity and quality as we
proceeded, but we met with no more water, and, after sunset, were
obliged to encamp without it at the foot of a rough limestone
hill, where grass was good and plentiful, with a few dead sticks
for our bivouac fire. On ascending our little limestone hill next
morning for angles, the estuary presented a fine open sheet of
water at its foot, 5 or 6 miles long and 2 wide, with a general
direction of S.E. by S. to its connexion with the sea. It did not
appear very deep, and several rocky shoals could be detected with
a glass under its surface: but for all purposes of boat
navigation it seemed sufficiently open throughout its whole
extent. Next morning I completed the examination of the estuary
downwards, and found limestone to be the prevailing rock, rising
in steep cliffs and abrupt projections. The mouth was closed by a
dry sandbar 300 yards across, and 400 yards wide to the sea,
which broke heavily upon two parallel ridges of sunken rocks
close in front, thus preventing any permanent channel being open
except for boats, and for them only in fine weather when the
water outside is smooth. From the absence of shells inside the
bar, it may reasonably be inferred that the sea never breaks into
the estuary at any time, but closes up again any channel which
its accumulated waters may occasionally force through the bar
after heavy rains. The sea-coast was sandy, fronted by covered
rocks and broken by rocky projections; and from a sand hillock at
the estuary's mouth I set the Rocky Islets of Captain Flinders,
bearing S. 46° 30' W., distant 20 miles. Naming this inlet after
my friend Capt. J. Lort Stokes, R.N., and its upper river the
"Lort", I called the principal river the "Young", after the
Governor of South Australia. Tracks and fires of the natives were
numerous in this vicinity, but none showed themselves, nor could
I spare the time necessary for finding them out.</p>
<p>Returning to our camp, we proceeded on the same afternoon 11
miles westward, at first over limestone country, much broken into
steep ravines, and then across undulating sandy land covered by
low heathy vegetation. At sunset we encamped on an upper branch
of another river, which had afforded us very bad travelling for
the 3 previous miles through thick matted scrub and tall rushes.
Broad open reaches were observed in its lower part 4 or 5 miles
from the coast, but it afforded no grass whatever, and our
bivouac was amongst burnt sticks and scrub, at a brackish pool 18
yards by 10, from which we disturbed some ducks and their young
families. The latitude by Menkar was 33° 49' 38" S.</p>
<p>Next day, December 17th, our westerly course led us 5 or 6
miles behind the sea coast, over poor country, the elevated
ridges of which were chiefly granite or gneiss, with occasional
red sandstone. Grass having been exceedingly scarce since leaving
Stokes Inlet, we halted towards noon to give the horses the
benefit of some good feed in a valley of yeit trees, through
which wound the shallow bed of a stream, now in numerous fresh
pools of excellent water 10 to 12 yards in diameter. Here our
footsore dog contrived, with some difficulty, to kill a young
kangaroo, and as we were not able to carry it, we dined, and in
the afternoon again proceeded westward. Crossing over a high open
ridge of sandy gravelly soil, we came at its foot to a salt
watercourse, the banks of which were broken into soft red and
yellow cliffs, amongst which were fragments of dark red
sandstone. Nearly 2 miles beyond this commenced a broad flat of
beautiful grassy land, dotted with yeit, wattles, and hakea,
growing in good soil. At the end of a mile and a half we came to
the watercourse which drains this plain; it was 8 yards wide,
brackish, and winding to the S. W., at the S.E. foot of a steep
cliffy bank. Here we halted for the night, and I observed the
latitude 33° 49' 6" S.</p>
<p>From the summit of a long sandy ascent of 2 miles next
morning, the rocky islets before mentioned were again seen
bearing N. 161° 45' E., at the distance of 7 leagues; and the
"Seal Rock" of Flinders was recognized through the haze, 9 or 10
leagues distant, bearing N. 223° 30' E. Some high breakers which
had been seen on the 17th, about 3 miles off shore, were now
again visible in a line with Seal Rock, and are thus mentioned
because they are not noticed in the existing charts.</p>
<p>As the coast now seemed to take a decided turn to the W.S.W.,
and to be backed by sand-ridges and open downs of no inviting
appearance, I maintained my westerly course for the purpose of
striking a river which Bob said we should encounter on the E.
side of East Mount Barren, and on which he reported some good
grass was to be found. Soon after noon we obtained our first
sight of the lofty hills of the above range, about 40 miles to
the westward, but throughout the day passed over open country of
very poor description and destitute of grass. No improvement
taking place when the day closed in, we halted, under almost the
only bushes visible, in a bleak open plain, which seemed scarcely
to have a limit, and across which a strong S.E. wind did its best
to extinguish the very scanty fire we found materials for making.
The only cheering object in view was a watercourse 6 to 10 yards
wide, in which water, as salt as brine, was winding very
tortuously and slowly to the W.S.W., but its banks and bed were
composed of dark red sandstone, and the same encouraging rock had
frequently been passed in the course of the day. The latitude of
this inhospitable bivouac was found to be 33° 48' 26" S. Half a
mile westward of it, East Mount Barren bore W. 10° 15' S., and a
considerable hill, about 7 leagues distant, which I called Mount
Desmond, W. 28° N.</p>
<p>Soon after noon of the 19th I gave our hungry horses the
chance of picking up something amongst some low scrub in a small
fresh swamp, and at the end of 14 miles made up all deficiencies
by encamping them in good grass on a considerable stream,
slightly brackish, and lying in pools 100 yards long by 15 or 20
yards wide.</p>
<p>The river here had a great and rapid fall among sheets and
blocks of fine grey granite, which composed its entire bed and
banks, with exception of occasional accumulations of a coarse
quartzose pebbly sand, which had been carried down by freshes,
and now lay in heaps 3 or 4 feet above the ordinary channel. The
water in some of the holes in the rocks from 2 to 12 feet in
diameter, was found to be perfectly fresh and good; whilst in
others almost in contact with them it was far too brackish for
use. The pools and holes were not full, and thin layers of salt,
encrusted on the rocks, showed the gradual process of evaporation
as the river had ceased to run. The fragments or débris on the
banks (for in the actual bed of the river there were none)
consisted chiefly of waterworn pieces of granite, quartz, whin,
streak-stone, red sandstone, oolitic conglomerate, and a variety
of fragments of a dark slaty colour, and very hard close grain.
Calcareous rocks and red sandstone had repeatedly occurred during
the day as we passed over a rough undulating country otherwise
uninteresting.</p>
<p>On the 20th of December, as we advanced westward, the
geological indications acquired additional interest in our eyes
at every watercourse we crossed, for the intervening scrubby
country showed nothing more remarkable than the occasional
outcrop of red sandstone in a gravelly sandy soil. At 3½ miles
from our last camp we crossed a river, in pools 100 yards by 20,
and perfectly fresh, running slowly to the S.S.W., between banks
which frequently broke into red and yellow sandstone cliffs. On
examining these and the interesting débris at their feet, the
prospects of coal being not very remote were greater and more
encouraging, for we seemed to have got much lower in the
carboniferous strata than in the stream-beds to the eastward.
Flaky ironstone of a hard flinty texture was found at a low
level, together with pebbly concretes, and layers of waterworn
pebbles were also embedded in the cliffs. Amongst the débris of
stones and gravel in the river's bed were fragments of slate,
flint, and apparent chalk, the same being also embedded in the
rocky banks. From this spot the sharp-peaked summit of the lofty
rocky range in advance bore W. 10° S., about 14 miles distant,
and towards it we shaped our course, crossing three more streams
of smaller size and fresh, running to the southward in grassy
valleys, the developments in which made us long to linger on
spots so geologically interesting: for in some of them the slaty
coal-shales appeared, and were closely traced as far as
visible.</p>
<p>The intervening ridges were high, steep, and rocky, and well
covered with thicket and scrub, which appeared also to continue
on the lower grounds, as these hills broke off into a descent ½
mile to the S.</p>
<p>The horses' feet now suffered so much from the extreme
hardness of the rocks, which in many places required the greatest
care in avoiding their sharp knife-like edges, that I did not
regret when a valley, deeper and wider than the others, at length
lay at our feet, and promised to afford them a respite on its
well-grassed flats. Descending its steep and rugged slope, we
encamped at 4 o'clock in the midst of luxuriant grass, in a
valley ½ a mile wide, through which was winding, in a very
tortuous course, the river which Bob had described to us as
draining the eastern side of the range. Here the scenery was
altogether rich and beautiful, such as, in contrast with our
former scrubs and thickets, we seemed never tired of
contemplating. It was, however, limited; and the effect was
chiefly produced by the abutment into the rich grassy valley of
several small projections from the higher land, composed entirely
of fragments of red sandstone, quartz, and thin scales of
micaceous slate, of every hue and colour. These projections and
their intermediate little grassy ravines were beautifully studded
with wattles and small ornamental trees; and above all rose a
dense mass of dark green foliage, reminding us but too forcibly
of the impenetrable thickets with which we had contended in the
interior.</p>
<p>As the morning of this day had been wet and stormy, with much
thunder and lightning from the S.E., and clouds were again piling
up in heavy masses, threatening a continuance of the storm, I
avoided all trees and conspicuous objects in selecting our camp;
and fortunate it proved that I did so, as before the sun went
down a thunder-storm, which had been gathering in the N.W., burst
furiously upon us from the opposite quarter, and would have swept
everything before it had we not been sheltered by a little
thicket of saplings. This continued and even increased; and until
early morning we seemed to be the sport of one continued dark
thunderstorm, passing from S.E. to N.W., and <em>vice versâ</em>.
The lightning gleamed and darted about us most vividly; and the
sharp cracks of thunder seemed to be in our very presence, and to
explode close by us. The rain did not fail to play its part
either; and by the time all was over our ammunition (in
waterproof canisters) was the only article left dry, for our
frail calico tents might as well have been struck at the
outset.</p>
<p>At daylight nature smiled out upon us as if nothing had
happened; and we proceeded on the labours of the day as soon as
we could dry some clothes, and had looked about for the damage
done by the elements; but excepting the leaping and brawling of
the water-channels around, and the occasional grumbling of the
distant thunder, no vestige appeared of the recent storm.</p>
<p>On examining the river 100 yards to the westward, it was found
to be in deep open pools of considerable size, formed entirely
out of a light-coloured greenish rock, laminated and stratified.
Its lay was E. 30° N., and W. 30° S., with occasional deviations,
amounting to 10° or 15°; and the dip was estimated at about 60°
to S. 30° E. Thin veins of metamorphic ironstone traversed the
strata, without any regard to order or arrangement; and to all
appearance the whole of the adjacent range was of the same
formation, its naked rocks being plainly visible to the eye.</p>
<p>Mr. Gregory, in following up the river's bed a few hundred
yards, having found some loose pieces of micaceous slaty rock,
apparently coloured black by a bituminous substance, and
resembling a slaty coal, we proceeded on our examination of the
river upwards with renewed hopes, and at a part of it ¾ m. W.
from the last bivouac, came upon shales of a promising character
in the bed, of a deep slate colour, approaching to black, and
apparently bituminous, with thin veins of still darker substance
like coal between the layers. The direction and dip of the strata
were as before stated; and the sides of the steep hills which
rose from the river's bed were strewed with fragments of the same
slaty appearance, but more hardened by exposure to the
atmosphere.</p>
<p>The rains of the previous night had unfortunately filled all
the lowest levels in the river's bed, and had also set it
running, as well as every adjoining tributary. The bed was
likewise so encumbered here with rocky fragments among the deep
pools as to render our search difficult, tedious, and incomplete;
for at the time it was in progress the horses were struggling and
floundering across the rich grassy peninsula formed here by the
right bank, where the land lay very low, and had been rendered
soft and boggy by the rains; I therefore felt desirous of
securing for them a firmer footing on the higher ground, and for
this purpose cut off angles of the river which would otherwise
have been more fully examined.</p>
<p>As we proceeded upwards, the obstacles and impediments near
the river increased, and I found it necessary to withdraw the
horses altogether from its vicinity, while in a condition to do
so. While therefore Messrs. Gregory and Ridley traced its bed I
conducted the party through the dense masses of thicket we had
seen from our camp, as the only means of getting above some steep
rocky cliffs which occurred on the western side of them. By the
time these were cleared, at the expense of much scratching and
tearing, the party from the river's bed rejoined us, and reported
that they had fallen, in with coal shales, if not the actual coal
itself, of far superior quality to that already noticed, and that
it lay in large blocks in the river's bed. Not being aware of
this till we had long passed the spot, I did not see it, but
continued my search for some grass and a proper camping place,
the horses being greatly fatigued with their harassing hill-work,
and some of them very foot-sore.</p>
<p>Ascending a peaked rocky hill, 2 miles N. from the range, the
river was observed to occupy a very steep rugged valley in the
intermediate space, and to be in large pools. Above this it was
observed to wind through extensive grassy slopes from the N.N.W.
and N., its numerous tributaries being also well grassed, and the
principal valley 15 or 18 miles off in the direction of N. by W.
One of these tributaries, not so grassy as the others, seemed to
cut its way almost wholly through a red sandstone country, and
could be traced by its cliffs many miles to the W. and N. W. from
its mouth, a little above the hill we were upon. Several lofty
and abrupt hills of varied and peaked outline were observed
between East and Middle Mounts Barren; and the latter itself
appeared at the distance of 30 miles on the bearing S. 50° W. All
these hills seemed to be composed of the same light-coloured
micaceous slaty rock as that which formed the range near us.</p>
<p>Having given to the latter the name of Mr. Eyre, the
indefatigable explorer who was the first to report its existence,
we descended from our rugged elevation, and encamped 2 miles
further to the westward, a little above the mouth of the
tributary already noticed with the red cliffs. Here grass and
water were abundant, and the rock chiefly red sandstone
conglomerates, mixed with slate, and a variety of others in loose
and promiscuous heaps.</p>
<p>At this camp we seemed to have got quite above or to the N.W.
of the main coal seam of this river, which will in all
probability be found to crop out in its bed between ½ mile and 1½
mile in a direct line above our bivouac of 20th December, from
which East Mount Barren bore S. 28° 45' W. and the N. end of Eyre
Range W. ½ S. I should even now have proceeded on foot for its
further examination, but Bob assured me it was not the spot in
which his friends had told him coal was to be found, and to which
he was very desirous we should proceed without delay.</p>
<p>I have been thus particular in describing my passage across
this coal-field, in order that others who may hereafter follow up
the discovery may be fully aware of what has been left
incomplete. That coal exists in the locality pointed out there
cannot remain the slightest doubt; for although the later
specimens were so unfortunately lost, sufficient were seen and
brought away from the neighbourhood to settle all doubts; and I
have little fear but this valuable mineral will be found in
considerable quantity where I have stated. Its locality is
favourable, at 8 or 9 miles from the sea-coast, and probably 5 or
6 only from the head of an estuary which was seen at a distance
to receive the river on the eastern side of East Mount Barren.
This estuary (which was named Culham Inlet, and its river the
Phillips) is probably navigable for boats for a few miles, but,
like all the inlets on the coast, is doubtless shut up by a dry
sand bar at its mouth, except during a small portion of the rainy
season. This bar, and the anchorage off it, would be only 50
miles from the southern part of Doubtful Island Bay, where
steamers might coal in security from a depot.</p>
<p>Being desirous of searching as soon as possible for the coal
which our native had heard existed farther to the westward, and
in a position so favourable as to admit of its being readily
embarked in a boat, I proceeded previously to ascend the
Phillips, and to examine the good country we had seen in its
several valleys on the 21 st. Here we found much good grassy land
in the vicinity of the river, and of its numerous branches and
tributaries, the greater number of which came from Mount Short
and the Ravensthorpe Hills, and were mostly fresh, though
sometimes brackish. Following that branch which led us most to
the westward, at the end of 28 miles it had ceased to be worth
following, and we proceeded S.W. over generally a poor country,
but intersected by many small hollows and water-courses,
containing good grass, and more or less water, mostly too
brackish for use. The trap formation, through which the upper
branches of the Phillips had been observed to flow, was now
changed to granite, which showed itself extensively in the
highest and lowest levels of an open country, without timber, and
covered with low heathy vegetation, amongst which was much good
feed for cattle.</p>
<p>On the eve of Christmas day I was enabled to give the party a
long-promised rest, by reaching a well-grassed little tributary
to a stream-bed in brackish pools, which was winding its way
south-eastward towards the coast, in a bed of granite and trap.
Here we brought forward our best for the enjoyment of Christmas
in the bush, and dined off an unexceptionable roast saddle of
kangaroo, followed up by a pudding, which Buck had manufactured
out of soaked biscuit and sugar, and an allowance of brandy from
the small stock we had carried as medicine. There was reason to
believe that our repast was overlooked by a party of natives from
the rising ground above, whose suppressed voices reached the
acute and practised ears of Bob, but whose presence could be
nowhere discovered on our searching and calling out.</p>
<p>Numerous traces of emu and kangaroo were about our camp, as
well as of horned cattle, but the latter were not recent. Of emus
we saw but few as we passed through the country, but kangaroos
were very numerous. The lat. of our camp was found to be 33° 45'
41" S.; but the cloudy, showery weather greatly interfered with
observations of this kind, although otherwise welcome, as
affording us a good supply of water among the rocks.</p>
<p>On the 26th, our journey S.W. was resumed with renewed spirits
and energy; and at noon we felt that another important stage in
it was performed by our gaining a misty, indistinct view of the
Stirling range, about 80 miles to the W.S.W. We had then reached
the system of waters belonging to the river on whose estuary our
native supposed we should find surface coal, and observed
increasing indications of its vicinity in red and yellow cliffs,
and in the sandstones being in connexion with granite, a
water-course in a deep valley alone separating them. Here we also
saw West Mount Barren about 30 miles distant, bearing S. 6° 10'
W., and a remarkable double-topped peaked hill to the eastward of
it, which I called Mount Bland, bearing S. 5° E. Crossing the
water-course last mentioned, in its rapid descent to S.W. by S.
we found travelling difficult and rugged among numerous small
rocky ravines, and finally steered to the southward to avoid
them, and get upon more level land. At the end of 5 miles of
level sandy country we came upon another branch of the river,
winding to the southward in a very tortuous course, at the bottom
of a rocky steep valley ¾ of a mile wide. Here occurred the
white, streaked, and coloured sandstones we had previously
noticed on the Phillips, in close connexion with the coal,
accompanied by the same ironstone veins, deep red sandstone,
waterworn quartz pebbles, and rough coarse conglomerates, which
had been observed to accompany them. Climbing over the edge of a
perpendicular cliff, 150 feet high, overlooking the river in the
bottom, caverns 8 feet deep were found to have been excavated by
the atmosphere in the softer white sandstones, and the entire
geological formation lay most beautifully before us.</p>
<p>The surface in this dangerous vicinity for our horses being
extremely rugged and thick, I felt glad to remove them away
southward as soon as possible, where the land seemed to descend,
and to become more open as the distance from the river increased.
At the end of 2½ miles we were again upon the verge of a similar
sharp bend of the river, winding through a valley ½ to ¾ of a
mile wide, and bordered by broken red and white cliffs, 50 to 80
feet high, and in many places perpendicular. The whole country
hereabouts was extremely rough, and thickly covered with scrub,
rendering the greatest caution necessary in threading our way
slowly amongst the concealed rocks and holes. Descending to the
river's bed by a low hill of granite protruding amongst the
sandstones, we came there upon large pools of brackish water, and
observed many indications of their being sometimes as high as 25
feet above their then level. Half a mile below this we encamped
amongst good grass, in a rich flat, formed by the windings of the
river, which then seemed to pass amongst numerous flat-topped
ridges with narrow summits, sometimes bearing the appearance of
perfectly level tables, and in other views assuming the form of
sharp red peaks. Our native recognised this river as identical
with that on which we were detained on the 25th of October by
rainy weather and soft ground, about 15 miles to the N.W.</p>
<p>To abandon our search for coal at this most interesting period
was not for a moment to be thought of, and we determined at all
hazards to persevere in researches which now appeared so likely
to be crowned with success. Choosing the smoothest way that could
be found among the sharp rocks, we resumed our descent of the
river on the 27th, watered the horses at a pool not quite so salt
as those higher up, and in 2 miles from our camp passed the mouth
of the main branch, coming from W. by N., in a valley ½ a mile
wide, with steep cliffy banks. The river itself wound through an
intermediate flat of grass and rushes, and was at this time
running slowly between large pools; but the presence of samphire
seemed to indicate that the water is not at all times fit for
use. On the authority of our native, this main branch comes from
Je&#275;r-a-mung-up, where we had seen so much good country on
the 22nd of October last, 30 miles to the W. by N., the whole of
which space he also said was well grassed, and fit for good stock
runs. Up to this time we had been in the geological formation,
previously noticed, of granite on one side of the valley, and
perpendicular sandstone cliffs from 50 to 100 feet high on the
other. Half a mile lower down we passed the mouth of a steep
cliffy valley, with a water-course in it coming from the N.; and
being then on the high ground, observed the tracks of three
horses and a pony, supposed to have belonged to our indefatigable
botanist, Mr. James Drummond, who was known to have been recently
in this part of the country prosecuting his favourite pursuit.
Avoiding the cliffy bed of the river in this part for 2½ miles
our travelling was improved, and we were then abreast of another
steep valley from the N., ½ a mile wide, and of the same
sandstone formation as the others.</p>
<p>Taking again to the river's bed at this part, we were at
length cheered by the sight of shales cropping out on its left
bank, and in the bed found a small piece of undoubted coal.
Halting the party, further search was immediately made upwards,
and all former toils and sufferings were amply rewarded <em>by
the discovery of extensive beds of coal</em>, occupying the
lowest levels in the channel of the river. The part exposed fully
to view was 12 to 15 yards wide and 61 in length, N.N.E. and
S.S.W., any further development being concealed by loose drift
sand, covered with thick scrub, which occupied the whole valley
except the immediate channel in use. Mr. Ridley afterwards found
amongst this scrub another flat bed of even better-looking coal,
80 yards long and 6 wide, in contact with the lower end of the
above;&mdash;and there is every reason to conclude that, on
clearing away the drift sand and examining the beds of the deep
pools hereabouts, the breadth of coal will be found much more
extensive. It seemed to lie horizontally, without perceptible dip
or inclination, but the adjoining shales which cropped out on the
river's left bank showed a dip of 45 degrees to the S.E., and
precisely resembled those which had previously been seen on the
Phillips.</p>
<p>Diverting the small run of brackish water to a side channel, a
pit was dug 5 feet long and 3 feet deep through the mass of coal,
without observing any change whatever in its appearance, which
was that of carbonized wood, resembling pine. The grain could be
readily traced, and some of the pieces appeared even not to have
been completely converted. Having been so long saturated with
water it was exceedingly tough and compact, and until dried did
not break with a brittle fracture. Elongated globules of bitumen,
from the size of a pea to that of a goose egg, were found in it,
as if endeavouring to force their way to the surface. As our
mining tools consisted only of a spade and a tomahawk, and I was
desirous of moving on while daylight favoured us, we did not
penetrate more than 3 feet, but dried some of the upper and lower
pieces, and put them through the test of burning. This proved
most satisfactory,&mdash;they burnt with a good flame, and
without the slightest crackling or flying,&mdash;emitted a
regular coal smoke and strong odour, and left no residue but a
soft white ash. The result was equally satisfactory when we
submitted some of it to the process for gas, by means of a
tobacco-pipe and some clay.</p>
<p>The river's bed was here 200 or 300 yards wide, between very
steep banks, and was filled either with rank grass or dense thick
scrub. Many marks of floods were visible to the height of at
least 20 feet, which will render care necessary in selecting
proper sites for shafts to work the coal. On the left bank, and
in its small deep ravines, cropped out the shales in all that
interesting variety we had observed on the Phillips, and their
corresponding appearance tended more than ever to confirm the
opinion we had formed, that we had been upon a bed of coal in the
latter locality, and that it would have appeared in view had not
the river been set running by the rains of the previous
night.</p>
<p>Having fully satisfied ourselves and feasted our eyes on the
broad sheet before us, which was calculated to prove of such
important benefit to the colony, we took away as much of the coal
as could be conveniently carried on our jaded horses, and moved
away to where Bob remembered to have drunk fresh water from a
well amongst good feed for the horses. In 1 mile E. by N. we
reached it, and were afforded another proof of the unerring
memory and instinctive sagacity of the aboriginal native, in thus
being able in so intricate a part of the country, almost totally
unknown to him, to walk direct to a small water-hole, entirely
concealed from view amongst tufts of grass. Plunging into the
midst of these, our sable friend remained at least two minutes
under ground, and then re-appeared with a distended stomach, and
the welcome intelligence that plenty of good water existed 6 feet
below the surface. Encamping immediately, under shelter of some
neighbouring bushes, the spade was tried, and soon produced fresh
water 2 feet below the surface, and therefore accessible to the
horses, to whom and to all of us a little fresh water was quite a
treat. These wells were in a grassy tributary to the coal river,
the steep white banks of which were visible ¼ of a mile below our
camp. In the mean time Messrs. Ridley and Gregory had followed
that river downwards a short distance, and reported that 1 mile
below the coal the shales were still abundant, but apparently in
some disorder, the dip being changed from S.E. to S.W., and
occasionally to the S. They saw no more coal, and found that a
very white appearance, which covered the entire right bank of the
river below the coal-bed, was caused by numerous fragments of
white quartz, which had apparently fallen from the surface of the
land above, and had become partly embedded in the soft slaty and
clayey shales. Menkar on the meridian gave the latitude of this
camp 34° 1' 28" S., and abrupt red sandstone hills, flat-topped
and peaked, rose up around it in every direction.</p>
<p>The inlet which receives this river being that on which our
native had been informed a French whale-ship had procured coal
for use, I determined on giving it a close inspection, and, with
that view, recommenced our descent of the river on the morning of
the 28th of December, keeping as near as possible to it in order
to watch the indications. The river was here in pools, in an open
valley ½ a mile wide, well supplied with spear, kangaroo, and
other good grasses, growing among yeit trees and the
m&#257;inung-wattle, both of which indicate a superior soil. At
less than a mile from our camp a tributary joined from the right,
opposite to an elevated quartz slope, almost a cliff, on the left
bank. The valley soon afterwards contracted to a width of 200
yards, and became cliffy and steep; shales again appeared in
abundance on the left bank, crowned by a superincumbent mass of
ironstone, but the intervening bed of the river would not afford
a practicable passage by which we could get at them. They
appeared, however, to dip as formerly, 45° to the S.E. The
general direction of the river was here to S. by E. ½ E. for
nearly 3 miles; its valley was narrow, and filled with slaty
shales blending with quartz; all the water in its long pools was
bad, and the banks were so contracted, precipitous, and rugged
that it was frequently necessary to reconnoitre far ahead before
we could venture to advance with our weary horses.</p>
<p>Two tributaries now fell in from the right within a short
distance from each other, having a projecting grassy hill between
them, and down a long reach of the river itself West Mount Barren
appeared in sight, bearing S. 13° 30' W., at the distance of 16
miles; 2 miles below this the river cuts its way through a bed of
shales, leaving them in perpendicular walls on each side 100 feet
apart, and little less in height, with red sandstone above the
shales and scrubby vegetation on the top of all. From the strong
and decided echo among these singular cliffs, I called the place
Glen Echo, and immediately below it had the satisfaction to
observe the valley of the river open out and again become grassy.
From N.E. at the Glen its direction changed to S.E.; well-grassed
flats, 200 yards in width, occasionally occurred, and in a steep
cliff of considerable elevation on the left bank, we thought the
dip of the shales had increased from 45° to 60°, but could not
afford to cross over for a more minute examination. Half a mile
below this no shales appeared at the surface, but red sandstone
took their place for 300 or 400 yards, and the white and yellow
cliffs re-appeared with a dip not exceeding 2° to the S.E., and
the river at their base. Here the country became much more open,
good grass appeared along the valley of the river to the S.E. and
E., and we appeared to be rapidly receding from all indications
of the coal formation.</p>
<p>We here again fell in with some horse-tracks of Mr. Drummond,
together with the remains of one of his encampments, but, from
their appearance, we had little hope of falling in with that
enterprising botanist himself except by accident. From the dip
and open character of the country to the S.E. it was evident the
estuary was not far off, and I therefore took up the best
situation we could find, with good water and grass, where our
exhausted cattle could recover a little while we effected its
examination. This camp was on a chain of low swamps, filled with
samphire and green rushes, in a broad flat valley which drained
into the river about a mile lower down, and Middle Mount Barren
bore from it N. 87° ½ E., distant 7 or 8 miles. Traces of
kangaroo were everywhere abundant, together with some of emu, and
the bones of both were plentifully scattered around two large and
very recent huts of natives near our camp, which seemed to have
been occupied by them within the last two days, for the branches
which had been used in their construction were still green and
fresh. Like most of the huts or shelters we had seen scattered
over several hundred miles of country, these were of very rude
and primitive construction, having been formed by merely placing
broken-off branches in a semicircle, and resting their broken
ends in a strong forked support sloping towards them in front.
The fire, which always forms part of a native's encampment, is
invariably small and without flame, and is made within or without
the support in front, according to the size of the hut, or to the
number of persons it is intended to shelter. Near rivers or
swamps which produce the tea-tree (melaleuca), its paper-like
bark is used to cover in the huts, and is very loosely and
carelessly thrown across straight sticks, stripped of their
leaves, stuck in the ground, and arched over to a general
interlocking at the top.</p>
<p>Having seen the camp established, and our horses feeding on
the choicest spots of soft green grass which had been selected
for them, I started with Messrs. Gregory and Ridley and the
native, at four o'clock, mounted on the best of our stud, to
reconnoitre the country in advance, and prepare for a more full
examination of the estuary on the morrow. In less than 2 miles it
came in view, about a mile to the E.S.E., presenting a fine sheet
of open water, into which projected several prominent headlands
promising well for deep navigation, but no opening could yet be
seen to the sea. In the upper part it received some open reaches
of our river, near which were also some open lakes, and farther
eastward two of a sandy salt character, seemingly at this time
quite dry. Beyond these we came out, at the end of a mile, upon
the low swampy N.W. shore of the estuary abreast of the river's
mouth, and worked our way S.E. to examine a lofty bold projection
of yellow and reddish cliffs, which formed a prominent and not
unpleasing object on the estuary's northern shore, 3 or 4 miles
further on. As we got into its neighbourhood the land became
exceedingly rocky, broken, and rough; deep precipitous ravines,
which would have required a long time to examine, were found
deeply, to indent the shore, and the projecting abutments between
them were overhanging sandstone cliffs, washed by the waters of
the estuary. Leaving Bob in charge of our horses, we scrambled
and climbed about, examining all we could find accessible; but
when the sun disappeared behind the opposite hills, the main
headland was still ¾ of a mile distant to the southward, and it
would have been quite dark before we could reach it across the
thick scrub which crowned its summit. The mouth of the estuary
being also observed to be about two miles distant in the S.E.,
and the fiat summit of Middle Mount Barren bearing N. 67° E., at
the distance of 3 miles, we remounted, and reached our camp soon
after 8 o'clock.</p>
<p>Next morning (December 29th), with the same party, the
examination of the estuary was resumed by passing round its
opposite shore. Crossing the river ½ a mile S. by W. from our
camp, it there occupied a straggling samphire-bed, nearly dry,
and took a wide sweep round the margin of a rich flat with good
kangaroo, spear, and other grasses. At the far side of this flat
a tributary joined from the W. out of a steep cliffy valley, and
the river itself became full between its banks, winding with
rather a tortuous course to the S.E. Sandstone cliffs, 60 or 70
feet high, rose from its southern shore; in some places these
cliffs and the mass of rubbish at their base approached so near
the deep open river that we had scarcely room to pass, and could
not avail ourselves of any occasional shallows in the river's bed
on account of the softness of the light-blue clay which composed
it. Hereabouts the dark red sandstone again made its appearance
beneath those of lighter colour, but none of them had as yet any
decided dip.</p>
<p>As we descended the river increased its open width to 100
yards, opposite to the mouth of a lake in connexion with its left
bank, the whole of which shore is for several miles very low,
sedgy, and at times under water. The depth is here, however, much
diminished; both banks and bed are of clay and ironstone, with
many sharp masses of the latter showing themselves above water
where the broad wide mouth of the river joins the estuary.
Remarking a low island which divides that mouth into two
channels, we passed out on to the shore of the estuary, and found
both the latter and the steep banks which rise up from it
extremely rugged and thick. Low cliffs of red and white sandstone
abutted on the shore, and the intervening spaces were covered
thickly with a lining of stunted tea-trees and salt-water bushes,
obliging us to wade into the treacherous estuary in order to pass
them. Round the S. side of one very prominent projection, only ¾
of a mile W. 15° N. from our steep headland of the preceding day,
a cove, ½ a mile wide and deep, extended to the westward, and
received at its head a small streambed, at this time dry, winding
through a steep cliffy valley, grassy at its mouth. Red sandstone
and a slaty shaly rock were here prevalent, together with an
outcropping of laminated quartz.</p>
<p>The eastern side of the cove above-mentioned was formed of
another steep red and yellow cliff, similar to that on the
opposite shore. Its ridge was extremely rugged, steep, and
thickly scrubbed, and not finally surmounted without much
scrambling and tearing; but all bruises and broken shins were
soon forgotten when, at the seaward side of the cliff, <em>the
same kind of shales lined the shore as those we had seen in the
vicinity of the coal</em>. With raised hopes we proceeded, and
contended against every obstacle, but, as usual in these close
proximities to coal, the country was so rough and intricate that,
notwithstanding our great eagerness to move on, the whole party
were frequently hemmed up into the smallest possible space,
without power to stir another foot until a new opening could be
cleared. In our desire to avoid these formidable obstacles to our
progress, and save time and distance as much as possible, we took
advantage of every opportunity to wade in the estuary whenever
circumstances permitted; but as the water was thick, and its
depth not always apparent, our horses' legs were sometimes
endangered by their plunging suddenly into deep holes amongst the
sunken rocks. Such an accident threw one of them on his side, and
caused some apprehension for his limbs, and even for his life,
before he could be unloaded and got out again. The shales we here
saw on an E.S.E. course of about a mile, were crossed by us
obliquely as they rose out of the estuary, and lay in the general
direction of between W. 20° S. and W. 27° S., with an uncertain
amount of dip to the S.E. and S.E. by S. of about 45°. They then
disappeared under the steep white sand-dunes of the sea-coast,
which were covered thickly with flags and scrub. Below the shales
the estuary contracted rapidly from l½ miles to a width of 300
yards, and in some places even to 150 yards, and the depth of
water in this narrow pass soon diminished to 3 or 4 feet, on a
soft muddy bottom. A mile and a half from the shales, through
much thick tangle, took us to the mouth of the estuary, which we
found about ¼ of a mile wide, and choked up by a dry bar of fine
white sand at least 300 yards across to the sea-rollers. From
appearances within this bar, and from the general absence of
marine shells on the shores of the estuary, it seemed likely that
the sea seldom, if ever, broke into it, but rapidly closed up
again any opening which occasionally might be made across the bar
by the accumulation of water within after heavy rains. The small
bay outside was sandy and apparently clear of rocks, but was
somewhat shoal near the beach, and could afford no shelter to
shipping from the strong S.E. winds of summer. From all northerly
and S.W. winds it seemed perfectly secure, and boats would find
the best landing at nearly all times where the high rocky shore
commences at the S. end of the bay. The water is there smoother
than in other parts of the bay more exposed to the S.E., and good
landing might be secured by means of a very short jetty. From the
bar Middle Mount Barren bore N. 47½° E., 3 miles distant.</p>
<p>Feeling disappointed that the surface coal (if any exists on
this shore) should hitherto have eluded our observations, after
the plain indications we had witnessed, I proceeded N.E. to
search for any probable outcrop along the beach, and observed the
sand dunes of the coast to be supported and partly formed by
calcareous sandstone in horizontal layers or low cliffs, among
which were many fragments of slaty shaly rocks. To seaward of
these, appearances were in favour of fresh water being procurable
in many places among the sand-hills at a very short distance
below the surface, and at the end of a mile and a half a
remarkable spring of excellent water was found trickling from the
bare dunes at a considerable elevation above the beach. We found
most tempting little pools of fresh-water in the pure sand
amongst the limestone rocks and our native said that good water
was always procurable here by scratching a small hole in the
sand.</p>
<p>The surface now became strewed with many fragments of thin
slaty rock, and at the end of a quarter of a mile I stood upon
the summit of what had appeared from a distance to be a large
bare sand-hill, but which in reality proved to be a mass of
coal-shale, blended with a whitish schistose rock disposed in
thin parallel plates. The whole was highly glazed over, by the
influence probably of the sea air, and bristled up so sharply at
an angle of 5 or 10 degrees from the vertical, that the hill was
perfectly impassable for horses. The dip of the shales was here
found to be curiously enough S.W. by S., which, combined with the
great alteration also observed in the angle of its dip, proved
that a very great geological change had taken place in the
features of the country within the space of 2 short miles. I had
visited the hill because it lay in the direction towards which
the shales were tending from the southern shore of the estuary
just left. A continuation of those shales I certainly met with,
as expected, but showing so different an arrangement as to
direction and dip, that I could only account on the spot for the
sudden change by supposing that the Middle Mount Barren ranges
had been thrust up from below at a period subsequent to that
which formed the country around them. The flat-topped summit of
the mount was distant only 1 mile to the N.E. ¾ E., but in the
bottom of that short space lay another inlet from the sea, with a
dry sand-bar at its mouth, and two streams flowing into the head
of it, which was less than 2 miles distant to the W.N.W.</p>
<p>As the sun was near the horizon by the time I had completed a
round of angles from this bare hill, and we had yet much to do
before reaching our camp, I moved on westward, and in 2? miles
came to a part of the larger inlet just below its very projecting
cliffy headland.</p>
<p>Having from the opposite shore considered this spot worthy of
inspection, the horses were left in charge of Bob while we
scrambled down the steep rocky bank to some low cliffs, and fully
examined them and the adjoining shore up and down. The cliffs
were of light-coloured hard sandstone and conglomerates, in massy
horizontal layers, and the land in front was low, very swampy,
and thickly covered with tea-trees. Although this spot was in the
line the shales were taking from the opposite shore of the
estuary, not the least appearance of any was here visible, nor
anything further to indicate the near proximity to coal. As the
day had now closed in we recovered our horses, and soon after
dark reached the camp, though scarcely satisfied with the
unproductive result of our harassing day's work.</p>
<p>That coal exists in the vicinity of the lower part of this
estuary, although probably not at the surface, there seemed no
reason to doubt, all its attendant clays, shales, and sandstones,
ironstone veins, conglomerates, &amp;c., having been there seen
in abundance; but the great derangement which is observable in
all the geological strata near the sea about Middle Mount Barren
is calculated to throw out any but a practised geologist, and to
lead to a belief that, if coal is discovered there at all by any
other person, it will be by mere accident. It was gratifying to
find that the estuary itself and the lower reaches of the river
afforded good and open navigation for boats in a space of 5 or 6
miles to the bar, which was distant only 24 miles from sheltered
anchorage in the southern part of Doubtful Island Bay, where, on
the formation of a depot, steamers might lie convenient to the
shore, and coal in security. Notwithstanding also the roughness
of the 7 or 8 miles which intervened between the coal actually
discovered and the head of navigation on its river, there is
reason to believe a very good and tolerably level road may,
without much difficulty, be carried between them, and probably
between the coal-bed and the nearest bay of the sea coast to the
S.E., distant about the same number of miles; but of the latter I
have no means of speaking with any degree of certainty. With
these facilities, aided by the projection of a strong pile jetty
into the bay at the estuary's mouth, the inexhaustible bed of
coal we discovered on the 27th of December may, at this
particular juncture, be considered a most valuable acquisition to
the colonial resources, and if worked and rendered available for
the use of steamers, will have presented itself very opportunely
on one of the intended lines of steam route.</p>
<p>These important considerations connected with the river on
which we were encamped, joined with the large quantity of good
country we had seen on its upper branches, induced me to name
both the river and the inlet after Governor Fitzgerald; the small
river on which we halted on the 26th, and which forms a pretty
little tributary to the Fitzgerald, being called the Elwes.</p>
<p>Aldebaran on the meridian gave the latitude of our camp 34° 3'
26" S.</p>
<p>Being now in possession of the material facts that a broad
seam of coal, if not several parallel seams, traversed this part
of the country in an E.N.E. and W.S.W. direction, and that we had
been very near to, if not actually upon, one of them, amongst the
red sandstone lakes, noticed on the 12th of November, 160 miles
to the E.N.E., I became very desirous of tracing these seams
further in the opposite direction, where they might possibly be
detected cropping out on some of the various stream-beds and
inlets which fall into the south coast. I accordingly broke up
the camp on the evening of the 30th, and proceeded from this
interesting locality towards West Mount Barren, regretting that
time did not admit of my making some further examination of
Fitzgerald Inlet, amongst the precipitous rocky glens of which it
seemed very probable that coal might even yet be found, near the
surface, on further examination, with the assistance of a
boat.</p>
<p>Proceeding S. from our camp of the 28th and 29th of December
the Fitzgerald was crossed at our former ford at the end of
three-fourths of a mile, and we then entered on an extensive
level flat of excellent kangaroo grass, which had afforded our
horses rich and abundant food. Beyond this we emerged from the
valley of the river by ascending one of its tributaries coming
from the westward, where the country was exceedingly rough,
steep, and rocky, covered with coarse stunted scrub, and
difficult of access. Further to the south it appeared even
worse.</p>
<p>At the end of 5 miles we crossed over a poor sandy ridge at
the source of this branch, and then crossed two others belonging
to a different stream, which seemed to have its exit to the sea
by a break in the coast hills 3 or 4 miles to the southward. The
country around was extremely rocky, rugged, and scrubby. In the
westernmost of these branches we crossed a briny salt stream, in
pools, at foot of some well-defined yellow and brown sandstone
cliffs, commencing 80 or 90 feet below the general surface of the
country above. Salt was encrusted upon them, and had oozed out
between the layers.</p>
<p>In 3 miles more over open gravelly sand plains covered with
low heathy vegetation, we were passing 1 mile to the N.W. of the
remarkable double-topped summit of Mount Bland, and both here and
at the adjoining hill, West Mount Barren, observed a singular
change in the character of the vegetation. Many plants and
shrubs, long lost sight of, here reappeared under the protection
of the hills. Mr. Drummond's new Hakea Victoria especially seemed
to be perfectly at home in all its splendid magnificence; and we
felt another stage had been accomplished in our journey by the
reappearance of the "M&#363;ngart", or honey-bearing Banksia, so
prized by the natives during its flowering season.</p>
<p>West Mount Barren being passed on its north side, we were
descending from a shoulder about half a mile westward of its
western base, when shales were again met with, lying as before W.
25° S., and <em>vice versâ</em>, and dipping S.E. at an angle of
5° or 10° from the vertical. They were extensive, and seemed to
traverse the mount also through its whole extent, the
neighbourhood being likewise strewed with quartz, ironstone, and
all the conglomerates and rubbish heretofore observed to be
associated with the shales.</p>
<p>The land continuing to dip as we proceeded S.W. along a small
watercourse, with the shales occasionally visible at the surface,
we came, at the end of 3 miles, to a very abrupt descent, almost
amounting to a cliff, of red sandstone 3 overlooking a river at
its base, winding to the S.E. Much good grass was in and about
its bed, the main branch of which seemed to come from the S.W.
and W., and to be joined immediately beneath us by a grassy
tributary from the N.W. Descending carefully and without
accident, I encamped amongst yeit and maiming wattle, at the fork
formed by the tributary, and found the water in one of the large
deep pools fit for use. Grass was in the greatest abundance and
of the best description, fit at this time for making many tons of
excellent hay; the kangaroo grass in particular being in its
prime, with heavy seed-tops and young green shoots below.</p>
<p>This day's rough travelling again forced upon me the necessity
for sparing the horses as much as possible in such a country, and
indeed ourselves also; for not only were the shoes of the former
lamentably on the decline, and their feet very sore, but some of
the bipeds of our party were likewise nearly unshod, and neither
nails, leather, nor tacks remained to effect any more repairs. It
was therefore with some concern I learnt from our native that
this river came through a very rough and rugged country; though
the disagreeable information was somewhat qualified by the
assurance that the good grassy land upon it extended only a short
distance further upwards, and was then replaced by thick scrub.
This changed my first intention of tracing it up, and induced me
to proceed next day in the opposite direction, for the purpose
chiefly of examining the river's estuary, the mouth of which I
remembered to have passed some years ago on the western shore of
Doubtful Island Bay.</p>
<p>Observing the latitude of our camp to be 34° 14' 5" S., and
West Mount Barren to bear N. 21° E., 3 miles distant, we
proceeded E.S.E. down the river in the morning; Messrs. Gregory
and Ridley tracing the bed as far as the termination of the
cliffs, ½ a mile lower down, with the chances of falling in with
an outcrop of coal. None, however, appeared; and 1 mile further
the estuary was seen, its mouth being about 4 miles distant to
the E. The natives call the country around this sheet of water
Y&#333;r-de-lup, and the land about the Fitz-Gerald Inlet,
Gn&#257;ng-meip. Our river now assumed a more bold and decided
character, sweeping in fine open reaches 40 to 60 yards wide in
the space of a mile, when it joined the estuary near a red cliff
of considerable elevation on the left bank. The country around
had nothing to recommend it; but the estuary appeared, through
the trees which lined its southern shore, to be open, and
navigable for boats. Several long points projected into it along
its entire length of 3 miles, forming on either side deep bays or
coves, in which were observed many ducks, teal, and black swans.
From a dry sand-bar at the mouth of this estuary, Point Hood,
which forms Doubtful Island Bay, bore S.E. by S., 4 or 5 leagues
distant; and the sea-shore abreast was observed to be free of
rocks, but without any headland or bay to afford shelter for
boats or small craft. The anchorage in the southern part of
Doubtful Island Bay being, however, only 9 or 10 miles distant,
would always afford a ready and valuable resort for vessels,
should this estuary ever be brought into requisition for the
transport of coal by water.</p>
<p>Outside the bar the beach is very broad and level, and good
fresh-water is procurable by scratching to the depth of a few
inches in the little sandy hollows behind high-water margin.</p>
<p>Naming this inlet the Gordon, and its river the Gairdner, we
quitted both and proceeded five miles along the beach to the S.,
where the travelling was good, and enabled us to avoid much rocky
and rugged country. After crossing the dry sandy mouths of
several small water-courses in pools, some fresh and others salt,
which discharge themselves upon the western side of this bay, we
quitted its sandy shore at the commencement of the granite
formation, and proceeded 6 miles S.W., over very uneven grassy
land, bare of timber, except clumps of tea-trees and peppermint
in numerous small hollows, and abounding in kangaroos. This space
would afford cattle or horses a good run, but is in some parts
too much covered with low scrub to answer for sheep.</p>
<p>Coming out then on the shore of Bremer Bay, we made use of its
soft sandy beach for 3 miles more, a heavy sea rolling in, with a
strong southerly wind, and breaking high at the distance of 150
yards from the steep sandy beach. At 50 to 100 yards behind the
shore, high sand dunes, scantily clothed with bushes, were
partially supported by a long line of white cliffs of calcareous
sandstone, which also abutted on the granite formed land at the
northern end of the bay, but had there changed in colour to red
and yellow. At the more sheltered southern corner of this long
beach is the sandy barred mouth of another inlet from the sea,
which I had on a former occasion ascended in a whale-boat to the
distance of 10 or 12 miles, and was now desirous of further
examining by land. Crossing its dry bar, therefore, and
considering in passing that the waters of the estuary were at
least 5 feet above the level of the sea outside, we encamped
after dark at a good spring-well of excellent water, a mile
farther up, in the midst of a small patch of rich luxuriant feed
for our tired horses. The soil is good, and much mixed with
marine shells. Red cliffs were visible on the northern shore,
between 1 and 2 miles higher up; but the indications for coal
since leaving the previous camp had been but few and remote,
granite appearing to form the basis of the country along this
portion of the coast, and the red sandstones to retire further
inland.</p>
<p>Here we exchanged our limited congratulations on the
succession of a new year. The 31st had been very cloudy and
threatening, with light showers from the S.W. These increased
after we encamped, and the old year 1848 went out with us
exceedingly wet and boisterous.</p>
<p><em>Jan</em>. 1<em>s</em>t, 1849.&mdash;Proceeding, after
breakfast, to the examination of this inlet upwards, in a
westerly direction, we soon found the face of the country so
rugged, and broken into precipitous rocky gullies and ravines,
that to make any progress near its shore was a task of no easy
accomplishment. Matters grew even worse as we proceeded, and at
length finding that only detriment and loss of time ensued, and
that our weary horses (who had lost 25 shoes amongst them) could
scarcely be got along at all over the stony surface, I encamped
about 5 miles from the mouth of the inlet, and next day proceeded
S.W., towards more accessible country behind Cape Knob. In that
neighbourhood, Bob (who might now be considered to have got again
within the limit of his own immediate country) informed me, some
wild cattle had long been roaming at large, and I felt desirous
of ascertaining what had attracted them to the spot. In 7 or 8
miles we were upon their tracks, amongst numerous small rushy
lagoons and swamps, in the midst of which were three small open
lakes of good permanent water, which seemed to have been their
particular resort. The tracks were very old, none of them having,
to all appearance, been made within the preceding twelve months.
It is, therefore, needless to say we saw none of the animals, the
total number of whom we now learn did not exceed three. The lakes
and lagoons, here alluded to, form part of an extensive chain,
which occupies the lowest level in a wide valley formed by the
northern slope of the sea-coast hills. These hills are of a
limestone and sandy formation, and probably retain much of the
drainage on its way to the sea, as fresh water is always to be
found among the sand-hills of the sea-coast abreast, by scraping
a small hole in the sand.</p>
<p>Before proceeding further westward I made one more visit to
the neighbouring sea-coast, for the purpose of examining its
formation, being greatly prompted to this step by the alarming
illness of one of our best pack-horses (Smiler), now stretched
out on his side beyond our power of relief; for, in the first
place, we could not decide with certainty what was the matter
with him; and, in the second, we had no horse-medicines with us.
Leaving him under the best treatment we could devise, we
proceeded, mounted, to the beach as far eastward as the "Smooth
Rocks" lying westward of Cape Knob. Here a steep granite head
projected southward towards the rocks, and from its summit I
observed a small dry rock, not laid down in any existing chart,
about halfway between Smooth Rocks and the nearest trend of Cape
Knob, or about 2½ miles from each. The sea appeared perfectly
clear and deep all round it, and, from its lying low, and being
apparently not larger than a large boat, would be dangerous to a
vessel making free with the shore in the night. At this rocky
head I had again an opportunity of observing the remarkable
geological formation which had been so conspicuous in the
northern part of Bremer Bay, and noticed that, while the head
itself was composed of hard compact granite, it was overlaid on
the western side by brown calcareous sandstone, adhering with the
tenacity of a strong cement, and mixed with many petrified roots.
Horizontal cliffs of the same kind of sandstone extended behind
the beach eastward.</p>
<p>Returning W. along the beach it was found to be fronted by a
ledge of flat rocks even with the water's edge, against which the
sea broke heavily during a fresh S.E. wind, and created
occasionally a smooth shelter within for boats. In this limited
space of 20 to 60 yards wide, and 6 to 10 feet deep, shoals of
fine salmon were swimming about, but would take no bait.</p>
<p>A little further W. the route lay across one of those
extensive sheets of bare sand prevalent on all sea coasts, where
the low white sand is kept so continually in motion by peculiar
eddies of the prevailing winds, that vegetation fails in its
struggles to maintain even a scanty existence upon them. Here the
process was going forward in full force, and the sand-hillocks
undergoing a rapid change of position by the force of a strong
S.E. wind. The entire "sand patch" was in motion, and enveloped
in a thick cloud of sand, moving along with as much facility as
smoke, and gaining only fresh impetus by the perpendicular
resistance it frequently encountered. To move at all amongst
these animated sand-heaps with our loaded horses seemed at first
a proceeding of rather doubtful issue, on account of fancied
quicksands; but on Bob's assurance that it was a safe road,
always used by the black fellows to avoid the adjoining rocky
scrubby country, we advanced into it, and found the footing
tolerably firm throughout its whole extent of 3 or 4 miles. In
that space our route sometimes lay over broad sheets of white
limestone rock, of that peculiar oolitic formation which embraces
the appearance of large roots of trees; and amongst these rocks
would occasionally appear one solitary plant or bush, struggling
for existence against the overwhelming sands. Thus had evidently
all the adjoining land been formed, and the process seemed in
rapid continuation.</p>
<p>While traversing that part of this dreary waste which borders
on the sea-coast, we came suddenly upon the skeleton of a human
being, reposing upon a broad limestone sheet, about 200 yards
behind the beach. Our native immediately explained that they were
the remains of one of three seamen, who had quitted a Hobart Town
whaler some 18 months ago, in the vicinity of Middle Island, for
the purpose of walking into Albany, a distance fully 350 miles at
the shortest. Why these men quitted, or were <em>suffered</em> to
quit, their ship thus, on so inhospitable a coast, it is
unnecessary here to remark on. The only survivor of the three,
who was recently in the employ of Mr. Cheyne at Cape Riche,
declared that they were landed with their own consent, supplied
by the captain with as much provision as they chose to carry, and
with a musket and ammunition;&mdash;that, after a long ramble,
they became much distressed for fresh water, and at length
separated to search for it more inland, agreeing to rendezvous at
a certain hill, then in sight in advance;&mdash;but they never
did so rejoin or see each other, and that he alone survived the
fearful journey. The natives seemed to have been fully aware of
the death of the other two, and ascribe it to actual starvation
and exhaustion, disclaiming most strongly having used any
personal violence, but, on the contrary, having endeavoured to
assist the only one of them they saw before his death, who had,
however, through fear or distrust, invariably pointed his gun at
them when any one ventured to approach him. The unfortunate man
now before us was said to be one of them,&mdash;the other lying
somewhere amongst the sand-hills to the E., in a spot which our
native did not profess to know. He was of rather short
stature,&mdash;had on the remains of a coarse white shirt, blue
serge shirt, and moleskin trousers;&mdash;one blucher boot, with
a foot in it, was detached a few yards, and the other lay near
it, showing, with other evidences of severed limbs, that the body
had been, after death, attacked by wild dogs. Two of these
animals, of large size, were seen near the spot feeding on a
piece of whale-flesh, and Mr. Gregory got a long rifle-shot at
them, but they succeeded in getting clear off. Any attempt to
describe the features or person of the unfortunate man before us
would be perfectly useless, the face and hair having been totally
destroyed, leaving the scalp still on the skull, and some
parchment-looking skin stretched over the skeleton of the body.
After ascertaining that no marks of personal violence appeared on
those parts of the head and body capable of showing any, the
remains were collected and removed to a neighbouring hollow,
where we built over them a pile of limestone rocks 6 feet long
and 3 feet in height, with a large slab at the head, and left the
poor fellow to repose near the spot where he had so miserably
terminated his fatal journey. The heap will, doubtless, soon be
covered by a hillock of sand, and become a collection of
petrified bones. The position is about 3 miles N.N.W. ½ W. from
the Smooth Rocks W. of Cape Knob.</p>
<p>The sun being now very low and the dreary "sand patch" yet to
be traversed, we wended our way slowly onwards amongst its living
hillocks, remarking on the sad spectacle we had just witnessed,
having in all probability been occasioned chiefly by the want of
water, which was anywhere to be had in abundance within a stone's
throw, by scratching a small hole in the sand. This presence of
fresh water in the large sand-drifts of the sea-coast has often
been observed by travellers, but never satisfactorily accounted
for, nor can I assign for it any cause more rational or probable
than its being the drainage of the back country through those
caverns and hollow ways which, in limestone countries, so much
abound.</p>
<p>Passing through much good grass amongst peppermint trees and
short steep sand hills, we reached our camp before it was quite
dark, and I observed the latitude of the clump of large yeit
trees in which it was situated to be 34° 24' 29" S., three
miniature woods of the same description extending in a line from
it to the N.N.W. about 1 mile apart. Our horse, Smiler, was
somewhat better, but still gave cause for uneasiness.</p>
<p>Next day we proceeded W. along a beaten track of the natives,
behind the sea-coast hills, where the land lay low, open, and for
several miles nearly level, with small clumps of yeit trees and
rushy lagoons. At the end of 10 miles we descended the steep
shore of the estuary which receives the P&#257;llinup river, and
crossing its dry sand-bar, which was only 50 to 60 yards across,
encamped 2 miles up its S. shore, where we found abundance of
excellent grass, and tolerable water by digging near the shore of
the estuary. The latter was at this time very full; the water in
it nearly salt, and grass scarce on its lower part. Poor Smiler
having been left behind on the opposite side of the bar, standing
in the estuary up to his saddle-girths, unable to move another
yard, Messrs. Gregory and Ridley brought him into camp late in
the evening, somewhat revived by his refreshing halt. It was,
nevertheless, but too evident that without further rest he would
be quite unable to accomplish the remainder of his journey, or
even to reach Mr. Cheyne's establishment at Cape Riche, although
not more than 20 miles distant. I therefore availed myself of
this necessity for a halt to examine the P&#257;llinup river
upwards, as it was crossed hereabouts by the line of direction
taken by the shales from the vicinity of West Mount Barren. About
our camp the granitic stratified rocks preserved the
corresponding direction of W. 18° to 25° S., and had a dip to S.
25° E. of about 70°; besides which our hopes were further raised
by observing an outcrop of red sandstone, with varieties of a
lighter colour above it, and by a recollection that this was the
river on which we had first noticed so many red and yellow cliffs
about 12 miles higher up, on the 18th of November last.</p>
<p>With four of the best horses, therefore, the country was
examined upwards one day and down the next, on which occasions
some good grassy land was seen on the river, which swept in fine
long reaches, broad, deep, and open for at least 8 miles above
our camp, and showed occasional out-crops of white and red
sandstone; but neither river nor estuary showed any coal shales
on their southern bank, and the opposite shore was not accessible
to us. Towards the lower part gneiss or stratified granite was
the prevailing rock, in close connexion with white and red
sandstone. Near the sea other sandstones appeared of a calcareous
nature, overlaying the granite-gneiss rocks, and ranging in long
horizontal strata, from 50 to 150 yards behind the beach. The
hills on the eastern side of the bar are entirely composed of
such rocks, covered over with loose sandy soil; but on the
opposite side they speedily rise to granite hills of greater
elevation, and terminate very abruptly to the eastward at Point
Irby, or, as the sealers are in the habit of calling it, "Groper
Bluff". This name has been applied by them in consequence of the
locality being much resorted to by a large species of rock fish,
weighing from 30lbs. to 100lbs., which they have named Groper, in
consequence of its feeding among the rocks, and detaching from
them large limpets, sea-ears, &amp;c., with its stout long teeth,
resembling those of a pig. We caught one weighing about 40lbs.,
and found it of a dingy black colour, short, sturdy, and very
strong, with large black scales, and pointed head. It was well
supplied with fins, and had soft protruding lips or gums, adapted
to its peculiar mode of obtaining food. It proved excellent
eating, very gelatinous and nourishing. Some wild ducks and
duck-eggs were also added to our larder, the nests being found
among the low bushes, from 100 to 300 yards back from the river's
bank.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 7th January every surrounding object
beyond 10 yards was completely obscured by the densest fog I have
ever seen in Australia. Its appearance at that time was rather
inopportune, as our poor horse Smiler was nowhere to be found,
and we began to fear he might have stumbled into the estuary from
weakness f and been drowned. He was at length discovered lying
down in a small thicket, and was brought into camp in a very weak
state, notwithstanding his recent rest. Being nevertheless in
hopes he would be able to accomplish the remainder of the journey
to Cape Riche, now amounting only to 15 miles, we commenced, so
soon as the sun had acquired sufficient power to dispel the fog,
and proceeded up a steep rocky valley to the S.W. Passing
northward of the high granite ridge which extends westward from
Point Irby, at the end of 2½ miles the horses were watered at a
permanent spring of good water, called N&#333;ondeip, situate
amongst granite rocks, in a water-course descending to the
south-westward. A mile beyond this brought us out upon the
scrubby coast hills overlooking a snug little boat harbour at
their feet, from which the extremity of Cape Riche bore S. 17° W.
It was formed by a low rocky point on its S. side: its sandy
beach was open to easterly winds; and the sea broke heavily upon
a detached covered reef, which lay to the southward of it, 1 mile
from the shore. Passing up the steep rocky valley of a small
water-course which fell into this little cove from the westward,
the travelling was very rugged and bad for nearly 2 miles, when
the beach at length became practicable, and our horses felt much
relieved by getting on to it. After scrambling over two or three
rocky sandstone cliffs which were lashed at their bases by a
heavy surf, and crossing several small water-courses with beds of
the same description, we at length reached the mouth of Cheyne's
Inlet, and were surprised to find it open, with a salt stream 10
yards wide and 2 feet deep, running strongly out. Our approach
having been observed, we were met here by the worthy owner of the
property, Mr. George Cheyne, who showed us how to avoid some
quicksands in crossing, and then welcomed us to his hospitable
abode with his accustomed kindness and cordiality.</p>
<p>After an absence of 86 days, which, to our weak and worn-out
horses in particular, had been a period of almost unremitting
toil and privation, they now once again revelled in the enjoyment
of good corn and rest, and, with the exception of Smiler, rapidly
recruited their exhausted energies.</p>
<p>Here we remained four days, during which the horses were
reshod; saddles, bags, and clothes were repaired, and every
preparation made for our return to the Swan, with provisions
completed for 20 days. Every opportunity was taken of adding to
my store of angles and other useful observations for my survey of
the country; and for several hours on two successive days I
watched from Cape Riche, and from the high land over it, for a
covered reef of rocks which I was informed had been frequently
seen by vessels 3 miles S.E. by S. from the cape. Although my
vigils were both during and after a fresh breeze, when this
danger might be supposed to be visible, I could perceive no
appearance of it with a good telescope, but have nevertheless no
reason to doubt its existence. The latitude of Mr. Cheyne's large
barn was 34° 36' 31" S.</p>
<p>As the water on the face of the country was now fast drying
up, or becoming too salt for use, I hastened our preparations so
as to have everything in readiness on the morning of the 7th
January; but it was then found that our native had become tired
of the service on which he had been engaged, and had gone to
rejoin his tribe. Finding it impossible to replace him without
much loss of time, I had to abandon my intention of taking a new
route to the westward, and through the middle of the Stirling
Range, as all parties agreed in assuring me that fresh water was
then extremely scarce along that line, and could only be found by
the aid of a native.</p>
<p>On January 7th we took leave of our hospitable friends, Mr.
and Mrs. Cheyne, to whom I felt greatly indebted for their
kindness in facilitating all our arrangements; and leaving poor
old "Smiler" to be recruited and forwarded on (as he was then so
reduced as to be scarcely able to keep his legs), we proceeded
along the beaten sandal-wood track on the eastern side of the
Stirling Range, the remaining nine horses being much revived.</p>
<p>Encamping on the 9th at the spring of P&#333;ilyenup, near the
P&#257;llinup river, we were there joined by four teams engaged
in carting sandal-wood to Cape Riche, for shipment to China; and
next day we proceeded up the river, passing through much good
grassy country in its valley and various tributaries.</p>
<p>The branches of this river are numerous, and come chiefly from
the eastward of N.; but as I wished to make for the military post
at K&#333;jonup, we followed up what appeared to be the main
stream coming from the N.W., and in 12 miles reached a place
called Myerup, where Mr. Maxwell had a sandal-wood cutting
station, at a good spring, and amongst fine grass. Here the
beaten track terminated, and I could gain no information relative
to water in the country in advance, but was fortunately enabled
to engage a native to accompany us, and under his guidance
followed up the river on the following dav. The latitude of
Myerup was found to be 34° 8' 57" S., with Ellen's Peak bearing
S. 21° 15' E., and the Peak of T&#333;olbrunup S.W. by S.</p>
<p>Our next bivouac was at some large pools called Kybelup, 11
miles further on: the intermediate space being grassy in the
river's bed, but scrubby on extensive open downs immediately
behind the valley. Shortly above this we quitted the
P&#257;llinup, coming from the N.W. in a rocky granite bed,
containing pools of water nearly fresh. The grass in the river's
valley had by this time depreciated much, both in quantity and
quality, and, as we proceeded westward, entirely disappeared in a
level sandy country, covered with low scrub and brushwood. In 7½
miles W. by S. from our last camp, we watered at C&#257;rramup, a
spring of good water surrounded by a small patch of grass, at
this time very dry, growing in tolerably good soil. White gum and
yeit were also now frequently met with, and at the end of 5 miles
of grassy forest land, extensively fired by the natives, we
encamped at a fine open lake of good water, 200 yards in
diameter, called Toolbrun. Ducks were very plentiful about it,
and the country around teemed with kangaroo and emu. Here we met
the families or small tribe to which our native guide belonged,
and by whom we were welcomed to their ground. These and all the
aborigines we fell in with after leaving Cape Riche were
afflicted with the prevailing whooping cough; they seemed,
however, to adopt no precautions against it, and, on the other
hand, the disease had visited them but mildly. Latitude 34" 6'
55" S.</p>
<p>Next day we travelled through mostly forest country, in plains
well grassed, and had abundance of good water, camping at the end
of 11 miles upon the Gordon River, in large pools of fresh water.
Here again we had to repeat remonstrances at the day's march
being so short, but all in vain: our guide (who richly deserved
the appellation of "Donkey", by which he had been distinguished
by the white people) persisted in saying the water in advance was
all salt and bad. Latitude 34° 2' 34" S., and native name
Kylobunup.</p>
<p>Throughout the 18th of January we travelled over grassy forest
country, intersected by many small tributaries to the Gordon, in
some of which were pools of fresh water, and in all of them good
grass. Finding us resolved to proceed without them if they did
not push on, our guides grumbled along at a somewhat better pace
this day, and accomplished 21½ miles N.W. by N., halting at a
small pool in a watercourse winding to the S.W. in latitude 33°
48' 2" S. They called the place Gnw-yillup.</p>
<p>On the 19th, being personally unwell, and quite unable either
to walk or ride, I did not move away until 4 P.M., when we made a
short stage of 5 miles, and soon after sunset reached a deserted
sheep-station of Mr. Hassell's at C&#363;rralup, on the left bank
of the Beaufort River. The grass here was extensive, and
tolerably good; and the water of the river fresh, in large pools
30 yards across, winding to the N.W. A cart arrived soon
afterwards to remove the contents of the hut, preparatory to Mr.
Hassell transferring his principal station to the fine country we
had discovered on the 22nd of October, at J&#275;er-a-mung-up, on
the Fitz-Gerald. This arrival at the haunts of civilised man put
us in possession of various particulars relative to passing
events in the colony, and made us acquainted for the first time
with the result of Mr. A. Gregory's recent expedition towards
Shark's Bay&mdash;of his discovery of a lead-vein on the
Murchison River&mdash;and of the Governor having been wounded by
a native, on a visit subsequently made to the spot.</p>
<p>Proceeding S.W. along a beaten road, next day, over undulating
forest country covered with indifferent grass, at the end of 7
miles we crossed another branch of the Beaufort, in a soft dry
bed 70 yards wide, filled with brushwood; and, in 4½ miles more,
reached another of Mr. Hassell's sheep-stations, at a brackish
spring called W&#257;rkelup, or Joseph's Well. Here the overseer
was preparing to remove his flock also to the Fitz-Gerald, the
country around having been extensively burnt by the natives, and
the grass nearly all destroyed for the season. In 4 miles N.N.W.
from this station we reached K&#333;jonup barracks, and were met
with every desire on the part of the small military party
stationed there to render us any service in their power. By five
stars on the meridian the mean latitude of the K&#333;jonup
barracks was found to be 33° 49' 20" S.; and two azimuths gave
the magnetic variation 3° 48' westerly.</p>
<p>Remaining at our camp on Sunday, the 21st of January, I
performed Divine Service to our little party, according to the
custom invariably followed throughout the journey whenever
circumstances permitted; and next morning, having discharged our
natives, we proceeded along the post-road towards Bunbury. The
route lay amongst rocky forest-hills, and both grass and water
were in sufficient quantities for supplying our wants; but,
notwithstanding this, our horses continually cropped from many
bushes on their way, and from none more eagerly than the
poisonous plants which are so fatal to cattle and sheep. Our
previous belief that horses could partake of these plants with
impunity had now to be corrected; for, after crossing the
Blackwood at 24 miles from K&#333;jonup, winding through a hilly
country, nearly all of them showed such alarming symptoms of
weakness and lethargy, that on the morning of the 24th I was glad
to find a suitable place at which to halt them for the remainder
of the day. They were fortunately somewhat relieved by the short
respite this afforded them; but it was not without some
difficulty that they were got on another stage of 16 miles next
day, to a branch of the Collie River, at this time in fresh
pools, in latitude 33° 34' 25" S.</p>
<p>At 12 miles from the Blackwood River the white gum and
mahogany forests began to show some very good timber of the
latter description, which increased both in quantity and quality
as we proceeded N.W., improving as the white gum became replaced
by red, and the trees grew closer, straighter, and better able to
resist the pernicious effects of the periodical bush-fires.</p>
<p>On the 26th we passed about 20 miles N.W. by N. to latitude
33° 27' 39" S., through forests of the finest timber that could
be desired for naval and ordnance purposes; the splendid straight
mahogany or j&#257;rrah trees, growing within 3 or 6 feet of each
other, reaching to the height of 50 and 80 feet without a branch
or blemish, and apparently quite sound. The red gum is equally
perfect, although not so good for naval purposes as the
j&#257;rrah, on account of its numerous gum veins, which would
appear to weaken the timber in the solid mass, and to render it
unfit for any purpose requiring the exclusion of water. It is
nevertheless highly prized by the colonists for various purposes
about a farm, and would apparently answer well for ships' beams,
being of immense size, very hard, tough, and straight. It is,
however, more subject to decay than the j&#257;rrah, which, in
its sound state and free from sap, is not even assailable by
those formidable and universal destroyers, the white ant and sea
worm. The best timber is found in the most hilly country, and the
greatest facilities are at command for the construction of roads
through it, long straight timber of any required dimensions being
on the spot for bridges and viaducts.</p>
<p>Eight or nine miles, on a devious course to N.N.W., through
hilly country equally practicable, and equally well timbered,
took us to the Ferguson; after crossing which, by a very good
small bridge, the road became, and continued for 3½ miles, so
steep and severe amongst sharp abrupt hills, as to be totally
impracticable for a loaded team. After this, the country opened
out and became more level, the hills were left entirely behind,
and a good easy road might be made throughout the intervening
distance to the shipping port of Bunbury.</p>
<p>Having now reached a located part of the colony, we passed by
beaten tracks homewards for the benefit of our weary horses, and
on the evening of the 2nd of February arrived at Perth, after an
absence of 149 days.</p>
<p>During this period the expedition traversed nearly 1800 miles
of country; and although, from the nature of the interior, no
great addition has been made to the amount of good land available
to the colony, much useful geographical knowledge has been
acquired relative to a portion of this continent hitherto
entirely unknown. Independent of all other considerations, and as
being more immediately and practically beneficial to this colony,
<em>the discovery which has been made on this occasion of coal in
two available situations</em>, at this particular juncture, is
alone a sufficient recompense for all the outlay and labour
bestowed; especially if my anticipations are realised, that this
valuable mineral may be traced even nearer than I found it to the
anchorage in Doubtful Island Bay.</p>
<p>It is also to be hoped that, as one of the most valuable and
most readily available sources of wealth in this colony, the
superb naval timber which I observed in such inexhaustible
quantity in the forests behind Bunbury, will not much longer be
suffered to remain there idle, but that, on the formation of
practicable roads, the axe and saw will shortly resound amongst
it, to the mutual advantage of the colony and of its parent
country.</p>
<p>The pleasing duty now only remains to me of reporting my
entire satisfaction with the praiseworthy conduct of Messrs.
Gregory and Ridley, and of privates Lee and Buck of the 96th, who
were associated with me on this expedition. To the cheerfulness
and alacrity with which each and all were ever at their
respective posts, putting forth their best energies and exertions
to overcome formidable obstacles, and to further the objects in
view, is mainly to be attributed, under Providence, my successful
accomplishment of the duties pointed out in his Excellency's
instructions; nor can I speak too highly of that spirit of steady
endurance and determination with which they met unavoidable
privations, and faced difficulties and impediments of no ordinary
description, during our long and toilsome journey.</p>
