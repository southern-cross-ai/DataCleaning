  <h3>First published in <i>Everybody&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, September 1918</h3>

  <p class="first">LIEUTENANT BAXTER was writing letters home and, at the
  moment Cornish came into the mess-hut, was gazing through the window with
  that fixed stare which might indicate either the memory of some one loved and
  absent or a mental struggle after the correct spelling of the village billets
  he had bombed the night before.</p>

  <p>Cornish, who looked sixteen, but was in reality quite an old gentleman of
  twenty, thrust his hands into his breeches pockets and gazed disconsolately
  round before he slouched across to where Baxter sat at his literary
  exercises.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Cornish in a complaining voice, &ldquo;what the
  devil are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cleaning my boots,&rdquo; said Baxter without looking up;
  &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you notice it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Second-Lieutenant Cornish sniggered. &ldquo;Quit fooling. I say, what are
  you writing letters for? Good Heavens, you are always writing
  letters!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Baxter withdrew his gaze from the window and went on writing with marked
  industry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Cornish again, &ldquo;there was a fellow of the
  American squadron in here to-day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Baxter sighed and put down his pen. &ldquo;I am told that America is in
  the war,&rdquo; he said politely. &ldquo;This fact would probably account for
  the phenomenal happening.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He asked for rye whisky,&rdquo; said Cornish, nodding
  significantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When I told him that we hadn&rsquo;t any rye whisky,&rdquo; Cornish
  went on, &ldquo;he asked, whether we weren&rsquo;t fighting for civilization
  and the free something or other of peoples.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Baxter swung round on his chair, his hands folded on his lap. &ldquo;All
  this is very fascinating,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you write a
  book about it? And what are you doing here, may I ask? I thought you were
  going into Amiens?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d gone,&rdquo; said the gloomy young man; &ldquo;it
  is blowing eighty miles an hour up-stairs. Depledge went up and was buffeted
  about all over the shop and nearly crashed. Saw a Hun and couldn&rsquo;t get
  near him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was the Hun doing?&rdquo; asked Baxter, interested in spite of
  himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very question Depledge asked me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t tell him?&rdquo; said Baxter.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a reticent devil, Cornish! And now, if you don&rsquo;t
  mind my communicating with my fond parents, perhaps you will go out into the
  garden and eat worms.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that reminds me,&rdquo; said Cornish: &ldquo;This American
  chap, a most excellent fellow, by the way, wanted to know what has happened
  to Tam.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you tell him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; confessed Cornish.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know?&rdquo; asked the patient Baxter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Cornish.</p>

  <p>Baxter groaned. &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Cornish.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said Baxter loudly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This fellow,&rdquo; Cornish drawled on in his even, monotonous
  voice, &ldquo;this American fellow. I mean, the American fellow I saw this
  morning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought you were speaking about the Spanish fellow you saw
  yesterday,&rdquo; said Baxter wearily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, this American fellow said that he had heard that Tam was coming
  back. Some brass-hat told him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was pulling your leg, my dear Cornish,&rdquo; said Baxter;
  &ldquo;these Americans stuff people, especially the young and the innocent.
  Now go to bed or go out and buy me some stamps or take my motor-bike and
  joy-ride into Amiens or go down to the workshop or&mdash;or go to the
  dickens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are very unsociable,&rdquo; said Cornish, and wandered out.</p>

  <p>He strolled across to the workshop and stood for a few minutes in that
  noisy hive watching the mechanics fitting a new tractor screw to his
  &ldquo;camel,&rdquo; then walked back to his quarters through the
  drizzle.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE wind was blowing gustily. It slammed doors and sent gray
  clouds of smoke bellowing from the stove, it rattled the windows and whined
  and sobbed about the corners of the hut.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly above the sigh and moan of it rose a shrill
  <i>&ldquo;whee-e-e!&rdquo;</i></p>

  <p>Cornish was in the act of sitting down as the sound came to him. He
  checked the action and, half-doubled as he was, leapt for the door and flung
  it open.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Wh&mdash;oom&mdash;oom!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The force of the explosion flung him back, the windows crashed outward,
  the ground beneath his feet rocked again.</p>

  <p>Even as he fell he heard the shattering of wood where the bomb fragments
  ripped through the casings of the hut. He was on his feet in an instant and
  through the door.</p>

  <p>High above the aerodrome, appearing and disappearing through the hurrying
  cloud-ruck, was a machine that swayed and jumped most visibly.</p>

  <p>Cornish started at a run as the antiaircraft guns began their belated
  chorus.</p>

  <p>He met Baxter struggling into his padded jacket before his hangar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a chance,&rdquo; said Baxter rapidly;
  &ldquo;who&rsquo;d ever imagine the swine would come over on a day like
  this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Think he&rsquo;ll come back?&rdquo; asked Cornish.</p>

  <p>The other shouted something unintelligible as he turned to climb into his
  tiny one-seater and Cornish guessed rather than heard the answer.</p>

  <p>Three minutes later he was zooming up behind his superior, his machine
  dancing like a scrap of paper caught in the wind. The little scout climbed
  steeply, heading eastward, and Cornish, strapped to his seat, saw nothing but
  the gray race of cloud above him, until the altimeter registered eight
  thousand feet. Then he began to take notice.</p>

  <p>A little below him and a mile away was Baxter&rsquo;s machine, while a
  mile ahead of him and running across his bows was a Hun plane of respectable
  size and unusual lines. He observed with joy that the enemy was making bad
  weather of it, and banked round to run on a parallel course.</p>

  <p>A rapid glimpse of the country told him that the adventurous enemy was
  making for home, and the proximity of the machine was probably due to the
  fact that the bomber had attempted to return against the wind to repeat his
  good work when he had sighted the chasers.</p>

  <p>Baxter&rsquo;s scout swung round behind the enemy. Cornish closed to his
  flank. The astonished but interested infantry in the trenches eight thousand
  feet below, heard above the purr of the engines the
  <i>&ldquo;ral-tat-tat-tat-tat!&rdquo;</i> of machine guns and saw the Boche
  side-slip. It was a scientific side-slip, wholly designed as an advertisement
  of the slipper&rsquo;s distress, but it was not the weather for artful
  maneuvers. Suddenly the big machine began to spin, not a well-controlled
  spin, but rather following the motion of a corkscrew driven by a drunken
  hand.</p>

  <p>The two scouts dived for him, their guns chattering excitedly, and the big
  Hun flip-flopped earthward, nose up, tail up, wing up&mdash;till he made a
  pancake crash midway between the line and the aerodrome of the
  Umpty-fourth.</p>

  <p>Baxter followed and made a bad landing, but the Providence which protects
  the child was kinder to Cornish, who lit &ldquo;like a blinking angel,&rdquo;
  to quote a muddy and unprejudiced representative of the P.B.I.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The infantry is invariably referred to by all other
  arms as the &ldquo;Poor Blooming Infantry.&rdquo; or words to that
  effect.&mdash;E.W.]</p>

  <p>Luck was not wholly against the enemy (for the two German airmen were
  alive when their machine reached bottom) except that the friendly hands which
  had strapped them to their seats had done their work a little too
  effectively. By the time they had freed themselves from restraint, but before
  they had fired the incendiary bomb which was intended to destroy the machine,
  Baxter was out of his chaser and was standing on the under-carriage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fire the machine unless you&rsquo;re awfully keen on a
  military funeral,&rdquo; he said, and four gloved hands arose over two
  leather-helmeted heads.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot. Colonel,&rdquo; said the cheerful pilot,
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Baxter watched his prisoners descend before he restored his Colt automatic
  to its holster.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry and all that sort of thing,&rdquo; he said to the pilot,
  &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ve got <i>some</i> nerve.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give the barbarian credit for something,&rdquo; replied the blue-
  eyed pilot, lighting a black cigar. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid my friend here
  will want a doctor.&rdquo; He indicated the very young and very pale officer,
  whose thumb had apparently been shot away. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t speak
  English. My name is Prince Karl of Stettiz-Waldenstein, the last of the
  ancient race that carries the blood of Charlemagne.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cheerioh,&rdquo; said Baxter, &ldquo;come along to our mess and
  have some lunch before the wolves get you and put you in a little cage.
  We&rsquo;ll drop your friend at the hospital&mdash;my name, by the way, is
  Baxter, and I come from a long line of hardware merchants.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The prince smiled. &ldquo;Trade follows the flag,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;My little friend&rsquo;s father makes typewriters&mdash;and pretty bad
  ones. You ought to be friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>An R.F.C. picked them up and after depositing the wounded youth at the
  general hospital, the two foemen were whirled back to the aerodrome, their
  arrival coinciding with the return of the majority of the squadron from
  Amiens. The prisoner was talkative and lively. He had been educated at
  Harvard and Oxford, thought the war was pretty good sport, told a joyous tale
  of a grand-ducal aunt who had sent him a set of silken underwear
  embarrassingly embroidered with the legend: &ldquo;Gott strafe England und
  America,&rdquo; but would not offer any information about the machine he was
  flying.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can see what is left of it and discover for yourself,&rdquo; he
  said to Major Blackie at parting; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a fairly useful bus, but
  nothing as useful as she&rsquo;s supposed to be. Oh, by the way, I nearly
  forgot to ask&mdash;where&rsquo;s Tam?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tam is in England,&rdquo; smiled Blackie. &ldquo;I thought you
  fellows knew. He got married and went away to be an instructor or
  something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But surely he&rsquo;s back,&rdquo; persisted the other. &ldquo;One
  of our circus commanders (you call them circuses, don&rsquo;t you?) told me
  he was due back to-day&mdash;that was one of the reasons I came over. If the
  weather had been good we should have come in force!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A sort of &lsquo;welcome home,&rsquo; eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The prince grinned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, he isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; Blackie went on, &ldquo;and so
  far as I know&mdash;excuse me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>An orderly stood in the door with a scrap of paper in his hand which
  Blackie took and read.</p><br>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;I MUST hurry you off,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the
  wind&rsquo;s dropped and one of your circuses is going up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good luck to &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said the prisoner as he shook
  hands.</p>

  <p>The circus did not materialize in so far as the squadron was concerned,
  its activities being exclusively monopolized by certain enthusiastic but
  half-trained units of the U. S. F. C., which, while on a practise flight, and
  strictly against all instructions, engaged its more skilful enemy and bluffed
  it into retreat.</p>

  <p>This was discussed among other matters after dinner that night.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The gentlemen from Indiana got Fritz with his tail down,&rdquo;
  said Baxter; &ldquo;they were out doing a formation stunt with no idea in
  life save to avoid unpleasantness with their flight commander&mdash;it
  wasn&rsquo;t a bad formation, by the way&mdash;when Fritz and his Imperial
  Circus butted into the simple children of the West.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was funny. The gentlemen from Indiana just dropped that
  formation nonsense. They simply went baldheaded for the nearest Hun and
  before you could say &lsquo;knife,&rsquo; two Huns were spinning out of
  control and the circus was moving homeward with the United States of America
  in hot pursuit. It was comic to see the French instructor shooting off
  frantic recall signals.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blackie pulled out his cigar case and contemplated the interior with a
  look of gloom.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder why everybody thinks Tam is coming back&mdash;the cigars
  and the Americans remind me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s no use for flying&mdash;when a chap is
  married he&rsquo;s done for,&rdquo; said a voice in a dark corner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hit him, somebody,&rdquo; growled Mortimer, the latest of the
  squadron benedicts. &ldquo;Come out of your obscurity, Hector Misogynist; oh,
  it&rsquo;s Cornish! Bah!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cornish came into the light unabashed. &ldquo;Kipling wrote it about a
  fellow who wouldn&rsquo;t take a fence or lead his squadron after he was
  married&mdash;got scared when he thought of his child and all that sort of
  thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The door opened suddenly and a muffled figure stood in the entrance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Waiting patrol!&rdquo; he barked. &ldquo;Get up&mdash;light,
  bombing squadron over Corps Headquarters&mdash;get a wiggle on!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A scamper of feet, wails and imprecations from the waiting patrol, a
  chorus of &ldquo;Shut that door&mdash;damn you!&rdquo; and the hum of engines
  outside. A confusion of voices, a more intense roar which dies down to
  silence, and the night patrol is away.</p>

  <p>Blackie looked at his watch. &ldquo;Simmonds, your flight had better stand
  by&mdash;they don&rsquo;t usually strafe C. H. Q. There go our
  Archies&mdash;everybody stand by!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blackie hurried to his concrete office where a nonchalant telephonist was
  exchanging philosophy with another telephonist six miles away, and if the
  distant operator was the less philosophical of the two, he might be excused,
  since he was at that moment undergoing an aerial bombardment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Umpty-eighth bein&rsquo; bombed, sir,&rdquo; reported the
  telephonist in the same surprised tone you might employ to announce that a
  football match had been postponed, &ldquo;the &rsquo;Uns &rsquo;ave strafed
  two &rsquo;angars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And knocked the H&rsquo;s off the rest, eh?&rdquo; said Blackie.
  &ldquo;Ask O. Pip* if any of our people have signaled.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Observation post.]</p>

  <p class="first">Click! A plug pushed home, a rasping buzz and&mdash;
  &ldquo;Hello&mdash;O. Pip&mdash;Hallow! O. Pip. Reports? Right.&rdquo; He
  turned. &ldquo;Night squadron signaled nine thousand feet,
  sir&mdash;makin&rsquo; west. Encountered no H.A.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He said this importantly, since there was a fine roll in
  &ldquo;encountered&rdquo; and a pleasant mystery&mdash;which was no mystery
  to anybody&mdash;in the abbreviations for &ldquo;Hostile Aircraft&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;Observation Post.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Baxter came back ten minutes later to report and inquire. &ldquo;They seem
  to be leaving us alone, which is strange, after what that prince person
  said.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Apparently they are after the gentlemen from Indiana, who, I
  suppose, will be gnashing their teeth at their good kind instructor because
  he won&rsquo;t let them go up in the dark, dark night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a cheerful lot of boys,&rdquo; said Baxter. &ldquo;Who
  called them the gentlemen from Indiana, by the way?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tam,&rdquo; said Blackie laughing; &ldquo;he&rsquo;d read a book
  with a title like that&mdash;Indiana was the word that took Tam&rsquo;s
  fancy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello&mdash;hello&mdash;yes&mdash;speak up,
  Clarence&mdash;bombin&rsquo; yer, are they&mdash;all right.&rdquo; The
  operator half turned. &ldquo;Bombing Squadron H. A. operatin&rsquo; over
  American Squadron H. Q., sir; one &rsquo;angar slightly damaged.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blackie nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello! Yes&mdash;one H. A. forced to descend by Archie fire,
  sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blackie nodded again. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re out to-night with a
  vengeance,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;every bombing squadron Fritz has must be
  working.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Headquarters call, sir,&rdquo; reported the telephonist and slipped
  the apparatus from his head.</p>

  <p>Blackie sank into the seat vacated and adjusted the ear-pieces.
  &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Umpty-fourth&mdash;yes, sir, Blackie speaking.
  Yes&mdash;they seem lively, yes, sir&mdash;(check this, Baxter) twelve
  machines to escort 947th and 958th squadrons on a bombing raid to be in the
  air at five aco-emma! (Got that, Baxter?) Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He hung up the receiver. &ldquo;Reprisals by order&mdash;wind up at
  D.H.Q.&mdash;slow music and death to the sleep-destroying Hun!&rdquo;</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p class="first">WITH the dawn the escorting squadrons rose to their station,
  and Blackie from the ground saw the flicker of blue and green lights as the
  British bombing machines came over and their escort fell into place.</p>

  <p>The drone of their engines had hushed to an intermittent buzz when Blackie
  strolled across the aerodrome to the deserted mess-room for his morning cup
  of tea.</p>

  <p>The sergeant-major who walked at his side was expressing the gloomy views
  on the weather which sergeant-majors are permitted to hold, when he suddenly
  stopped talking and stood still.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Sergeant-major?&rdquo; demanded
  Blackie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Somethin&rsquo; comin&rsquo; our way, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blackie listened.</p>

  <p>The sound of airplane engines which had almost died away was again
  audible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not coming back?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blackie listened with a puzzled frown.</p>

  <p>The noise rose from throb to buzz, from buzz to angry purr.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Uns,&rdquo; said the sergeant-major&rsquo; sapiently.
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a circus&mdash;look, Sir!&rdquo; He pointed eagerly.
  Twelve thousand feet above, the rays of the yet invisible sun caught the
  white wings of the enemy squadron. Tiny flecks that glittered in the dawn
  light and unmistakably hostile.</p>

  <p><i>&ldquo;Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!&rdquo;</i></p>

  <p><i>&ldquo;Pang! Pang! Pa-pa-pang!&rdquo;</i></p>

  <p>The sleepless Archies were at work and the skies were full of wailing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, damn!&rdquo; snapped Blackie, &ldquo;every one of my machines
  up! Bomb-proof shelter for us, I think, Sergeant-Major.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the sergeant-major was staring at the skies. The big German formation
  so perfectly alined had suddenly broken. &ldquo;The leader&rsquo;s in
  trouble, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>No need to say as much, for the leader was sweeping earthward in wide
  circles.</p>

  <p><i>&ldquo;Ticka-tacka, ticka-tacka!&rdquo;</i></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Machine gun&mdash;what the dickens is wrong with
  &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A second machine fell out of formation, disastrously blazing. The
  formation was now confused and scattered. Three machines had banked over and
  turned for home. Another three&mdash;obviously fighting machines&mdash;were
  circling and the fierce chatter of their guns was eloquent of their
  annoyance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what are they fighting&mdash;one another?&rdquo; demanded the
  mystified Blackie. &ldquo;None of our people are up&mdash;glory be! There
  goes another!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>One of the attackers crumpled and broke in the air and spun earthward.</p>

  <p>Then Blackie saw.</p>

  <p>High above what had once been a formation was poised an airplane of
  microscopic size. It was a pin-point of light in the skies, so tiny that
  Blackie could not believe the evidence of his eyes until the circus turned
  homeward, one machine, obviously damaged and losing height with every yard it
  traveled, lagging in the rear.</p>

  <p>Then did the midget in the blue condescend to give the ground observers a
  closer view of himself. He dived steeply on the tail of the damaged machine.
  They heard the splutter of his gun and saw the lame duck crash.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what is it&mdash;Sergeant-Major? Good Lord, it&rsquo;s as big
  as a large-sized hat-box.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The tiny stranger wheeled round, poised for a moment and then began a
  glide for the aerodrome.</p>

  <p>As it drew nearer Blackie saw that his estimate of its size was not an
  extravagant one. It might be stowed in a big packing-case and might with no
  discomfort take shelter under the wing of a Handley-Page.</p>

  <p>The midget lit lightly at the far end of the aerodrome, and Blackie ran to
  meet the visitor as he stepped down the few feet which separated the nascalle
  from the ground.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, I&rsquo;m awfully grateful to you, but from what toy-store
  did you dig out this contraption?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The pilot shed his furry gloves and lifted the mica-eyed mask that hid his
  face before he spoke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;ll be thankin&rsquo; ye, Major Blackie, sir, if ye&rsquo;ll
  no speak disrespectfully of ma wee frien&rsquo;, &lsquo;Annie Laurie,&rsquo;
  the pride o&rsquo; Scotland an&rsquo; the terror o&rsquo; the
  Hoon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tam!&rdquo; yelled Blackie, and gripped the scout by the shoulders.
  &ldquo;Tam! You melodramatic humbug! You villain! Back again!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From ma honeymoon,&rdquo; said Tam, shaking his head,
  &ldquo;an&rsquo; just as I were gettin&rsquo; used to it&mdash;mon,
  war&rsquo;s hell&mdash;have ye a seegair in your pooch&mdash;A&rsquo;m
  travelin&rsquo; wi&rsquo;oot ma baggage!&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>Everybody&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, September 1918</h3>

  <p class="first">WHEN the Grand Duke of Friesruhe, son of a Most Exalted and
  Princely House, heir to Wilhelm XXVI of Friesruhe, beloved nephew of a Kaiser
  and a Czar and Colonel of the Third Regiment of the Prussian Guard, expressed
  his august desire to become a flying officer, permission was immediately
  given and instructions were issued to the Commander of the Sixty-fourth Corps
  District (wherein the Duke was stationed) that his Serene Highness was to be
  allowed to enroll himself a member of the Flying Service, might be
  photographed in the uniform, might indeed accompany a considerably
  experienced and trustworthy expert on a ground trial, providing (a) the
  weather were propitious, (b) the reliability of the machine had been
  thoroughly tested, (c) staff photographers were present, but that he must not
  be allowed to fly.</p>

  <p>Whereupon the Grand Duke of Friesruhe, who was quite a nice youth, lay
  low, mastered the technique of the airplane with great assiduity, and on a
  certain day which was not propitious in the matter of weather, and in a
  borrowed machine which was notoriously unreliable, climbed to twelve thousand
  feet alone and unaided in the full view of a pallid staff, which alternately
  prayed and swore. In the language of court circles it was an
  &ldquo;escapade&rdquo; and the matter did not become serious until the Duke
  insisted upon becoming a real pilot, whereupon he was summoned to Grand
  Headquarters and was lectured on obedience by the Most All Highest and Then
  Some.</p>

  <p>He listened to the lecture in silence, standing rigidly at attention, and
  went back to his principality. Within three days the socialistic
  <i>Arbeiter-Zeitung</i> published in his city began a violent agitation for
  Peace at Almost Any Price, and since the Grand Duke was known to be behind
  the Friesruhe <i>Arbeiter-Zeitung,</i> and the succession to the throne was
  secure, Grand Headquarters reversed its decision, gave him full authority to
  break his neck and requested that the <i>Arbeiter-Zeitung</i> should be
  subjected to Preventive Censorship.</p>

  <p>So the Duke went joyously to the front, and the <i>Arbeiter-Zeitung</i>
  explained that what it really craved for was a Peace with Annexations and
  Very Large Indemnities.</p>

  <p>That is the true story of how Colonel, the Grand Duke of Friesruhe came to
  be an air fighter and eventually leader of what was known on the British,
  French and American fronts as &ldquo;The Duke&rsquo;s Museum.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It differed from the recognized circuses in this respect: It consisted of
  two flights of five machines each, and those machines were more or less
  freakish. All the new types of airplane that ever came to the German army
  were first tried out by the Museum&mdash;and in the most freakish of all it
  was certain that the Duke himself would be found. The Duke was the first to
  fly a Fokker, the first to handle a Gotha; he was the very father-in-law of
  the Friedrichshafen, and the comparatively successful and the comparatively
  useless types he handled were legion.</p>

  <p>The cry of, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the blinkin&rsquo; Museum
  comin&rsquo;!&rdquo; was sufficient to empty the dugouts and bring even
  battalion headquarters recklessly into the open to watch twelve
  &ldquo;machines&mdash;assorted,&rdquo; twelve different types of different
  speed and varying military values, come staggering across the
  sky&mdash;aerial infants learning to walk.</p>

  <p>They were protected. High above drove the jealous scouts, buzzing like
  bees and relatively as large.</p>

  <p>Many and fierce were the battles fought and many were the specimens from
  the Museum that crashed behind the German lines. But the Duke remained, and
  presently, on some fine day, our scouts would see him at the head of a
  straggling line of new and even more eccentric machines.</p>

  <p>This new interest had come during the absence in England of Second
  Lieutenant Tam of the Scouts, and his first acquaintance with the Museum was
  when, returning from a reconnaissance, he barged into the ragged formation
  and was greeted (from the ground) by a protective barrage of &ldquo;flaming
  onions&rdquo;&mdash;the onion being a highly inflammable rocket which it is
  unpleasant to meet. He did not stop to investigate, having certain
  photographic plates which needed urgent development.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas no&rsquo; a sense of duty that brought me oot a&rsquo;
  ma coorse,&rdquo; reported Tam to his chief as they sat in the mess that
  night. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas no&rsquo; the quickenin&rsquo; pulse of ma
  fichtin&rsquo; ancestors&mdash;&rsquo;twas the instinct that makes a wee boy
  push his way into the crood that surroun&rsquo;s a lad in a fit. Mon! but
  A&rsquo;m keen on gettin&rsquo; a squaint at the Airchduke.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Grand Duke,&rdquo; corrected Blackie; &ldquo;Archdukes are
  Austrian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the same, Major Blackie, sir,&rdquo; said Tam calmly;
  &ldquo;Airchdukes are the grandest dukes in Austria&mdash;A&rsquo;m
  studyin&rsquo; the subject of dukes the noo. There&rsquo;s a bonnie book just
  come to me frae ma&mdash;frae a friend o&rsquo; mine&rdquo; (he never spoke,
  save in this cautious fashion, of the pretty and vivacious little American
  girl he had married, and who was now living in Devonshire and watching with
  apprehension every messenger-boy who carried a telgram); &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a
  wonderful book an&rsquo; must have cost twa dollars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eight shillings,&rdquo; corrected the youthful &ldquo;ace&rdquo;
  Bagley.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Twa dollars, ma friend,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;an&rsquo; less than
  eight shillin&rsquo;s, for the currency of ma adopted country is fine
  an&rsquo; healthy. Well, noo, why do you interrupt me? This book is aboot war
  in the days before flyin&rsquo; machines. They were gay times. When a
  commander led his flight o&rsquo;er the enemy&rsquo;s line, he just cranked
  up his one-seated chairger, filled his petrol-tank wi&rsquo; beer and
  whusky&mdash;accordin&rsquo; to whether he was a squire mechanic or a knight
  obsairver&mdash;took a good grip of a ten-foot joystick an&rsquo; said to his
  wee page&mdash;&lsquo;Contact&mdash;let her rip, Alec;&rsquo; an&rsquo; off
  he&rsquo;d zoom across the wairld, not carin&rsquo; whether it snowed.
  An&rsquo; when he met a Hun he&rsquo;d ficht and ficht till he crashed him
  an&rsquo; cut off his heid. Then by rights all the golden airmor of the Hun
  was his. Or, if he just brought him doon oot of control, he&rsquo;d put him
  in a cage an&rsquo; say, &lsquo;Yon feller&rsquo;s ma pairsonal
  property&mdash;his relations can buy him back for ten thousand
  rose-nobles.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You could buy the earth and Paris if you held your prisoners to
  ransom, Tam,&rdquo; said Blackie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;m no&rsquo; so sure,&rdquo; said Tam, shaking his head;
  &ldquo;&rsquo;tis only the men-at-airms an&rsquo; the young squires
  A&rsquo;ve pinched, wi&rsquo; an occasional baron&mdash;but barons are
  nothin&rsquo; in Gairmany. Every Hun A&rsquo;ve brought doon so far
  A&rsquo;ve called &lsquo;Baron,&rsquo; an&rsquo; the only mistake A&rsquo;ve
  made was when A ought to have said &lsquo;Coont&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;Prince.&rsquo; There are more barons in Gairmany than there are second
  loots in the British Army&mdash;they&rsquo;re as plentiful as Very lights on
  a strafe night. Suppose A held a baron to ransom, an&rsquo; suppose A got
  through a letter to his family Slosh or Schloss,
  sayin&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;Dear Sair or Madame: A have found a baron
  bearin&rsquo; your name an&rsquo; address. Kindly send ransom for same in
  strictest confidence.&rsquo; What d&rsquo;ye think A&rsquo;d get? A ten-cent
  postal stamp?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get the Duke, Tam, and earn promotion,&rdquo; said Blackie,
  &ldquo;he smokes the finest cigars of any man in Germany and his pockets are
  usually filled with them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a deid mon!&rdquo; said Tam.</p>

  <p>But a grand duke takes a lot of killing.</p>

  <p>Tam, patrolling from Gx. 971. A. to Tm. 141 Q (you will search in vain for
  this hideous disguise of the limits of the Saarville district), came into
  contact with a flying formation which he at first identified as von
  Bissing&rsquo;s circus, usually to be found in this region. Closer
  inspection, however, revealed the fact that the formation was made up of
  &ldquo;job lots&rdquo; and Tam disappeared into the base of a cumulus and
  circled through the thick mist to pass the time which must elapse before the
  Museum came within fighting distance. It had been heading his way and so also
  had the overhead escort&mdash;five famous air-fighters formed the guard of
  honor.</p>

  <p>Tam skimmed lower and lower until only the thinnest veil of mist separated
  him from the Grand Ducal Squadron. He judged them to be fifteen hundred feet
  beneath when he dived straight into the center of the formation.</p>

  <p>Airplanes do not emit a startled squeal or roll up the whites of their
  eyes or shriek for help, but they have a way of illustrating emotion. They
  scattered and dived, some to the east, some to the north&mdash;all except,
  one, a new Alto-Albatross that pushed its nose up to meet the droning
  fury.</p>

  <p>It was to this machine that Tam directed his attention. He passed the
  Albatross in a flash, something snapped behind him and a wire stay dangled
  loosely. He looped back to secure some of the height he had lost, but the
  Duke was quicker and had maneuvered for the attacking position. Tam banked
  over, loosing his gun and sensed the hit he made. He came again to the
  attack, half-circled his enemy, now enveloped in smoke, let fly another
  fusillade and dropped steeply for earth. Tam did not look up to discover what
  the German escort was doing. He knew. He dropped because he calculated that
  at that moment five angry machines, piloted by most redoubtable fighters were
  driving for him.</p>

  <p>He fell for the cover which the flying British Archie gives to airmen in
  distress, but the five fell with him, for the machine of a Most Exalted
  Person was smoking and burning in mid-air, and each and every one of the five
  would be held accountable for any change in the succession to the throne of
  Friesruhe.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE Seventy-ninth Patrolling Flight of the United States
  Army witnessed these deeds from afar off and consumed with morbid curiosity
  came down from their lofty plane to investigate&mdash;and the chase
  ended.</p>

  <p>It was the flight commander who reported, subsequently, that the
  Duke&rsquo;s machine had made a good landing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;m hopin&rsquo; the Duke was no&rsquo; burned,&rdquo; said
  Tam, &ldquo;that would be an awfu&rsquo; waste o&rsquo; good
  seegairs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Duke was no&rsquo; burned. His incomparable Museum and Exhibiton of
  Mechanical Marvels and Magical Air-Conquering Apparatus paraded the Ypres
  front that same week with the greatest eclat, but this time (according to the
  report of the Umpty-ninth Squadron R.F.C. supported by the veracious
  &ldquo;gulls&rdquo; of the Royal Naval Air Service) the number of the escort
  was such that they darkened the sky.</p>

  <p>The commander of the Umpty-first complained bitterly that he had lost
  three machines because of &ldquo;this infernal obstruction&rdquo; in the
  skies.</p>

  <p>His machines had been good-natured bombers which were homewardly plodding
  their weary way, after dropping about three tons of high explosives on
  Roulers railway station, when they had fallen in with the Museum and its
  board of trustees, and three pedigreed Page machines were sorely stricken and
  now lay somewhere in Flanders.</p>

  <p>Then one day, a message came through to four fighting squadrons.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This Museum business is getting on the nerves of G.H.Q.,&rdquo;
  said Blackie to his assistant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, sir?&rdquo; asked that youth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Museum is to be found and smudged out&mdash;its aerodrome is to
  be bombed at every opportunity and the Duke must be crushed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Baxter whistled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not like G.H.Q.,&rdquo; he
  said, &ldquo;that black-hand stuff. What has the poor old Duke been
  doing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blackie shook his head. &ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it is
  something fierce to stir up G.H.Q.&mdash;the American and French squadrons
  have had the same instructions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He opened a steel safe and took out from a drawer which he unlocked, a
  long yellow envelope which had been heavily sealed. From this he extracted a
  slip of paper on which were written about eight lines of handwriting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Send Tam to me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>Tam was in the middle of a long composition designed for his
  &ldquo;friend,&rdquo; embellished at unexpected intervals with those poems
  which only Tam could write. He hastily locked away his letter and hurried
  across to the orderly room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shut the door, Tam,&rdquo; said Blackie&mdash;and when this was
  done&mdash;&rdquo;what I tell you now is in absolute confidence. To-morrow we
  start sending out to find the Duke and he is to be brought down, if possible,
  within our lines. If that is not feasible, he must be crashed, and by crashed
  I mean his machine must be destroyed. You will tell your flight no more than
  this, that if necessary, you must engineer a collision in mid-air&mdash;in
  fact, ram him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye, sir,&rdquo; said Tam, gravely nodding.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why this order has come out, but it is a very
  special and confidential instruction. These measures are not to be put into
  movement until&rdquo;&mdash;he consulted the paper
  again&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;twelve o&rsquo;clock noon on the
  eighteenth&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam saluted and departed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you make of it, sir?&rdquo; asked Baxter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hardly know,&rdquo; replied Blackie slowly; &ldquo;but from what
  some of the Huns we have captured say I rather fancy we have been underrating
  the Duke. He is one of the best, boldest and most inventive flyers in the
  German service. He has tried out every good machine they have had, and has
  made them practicable for general service. I rather fancy the big escort is
  more to protect him in his experiments than to save his blue blood from
  spilling. Remember, all his flights are carried out under war
  conditions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what are the rest of the Museum?&rdquo; asked Baxter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That apparently is camouflage to hide the fact that the machine
  that is being tried out is the one which the Duke is flying&mdash;you
  remember we used to do the same thing when poor Hall was alive. Hall
  perfected the Wingate Stabilizer at twelve thousand feet under Archie fire;
  he improved our bomb sights while actually circling over Treves. I rather
  suspect that the Duke is a genius of a similar order.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="first">AT twelve o&rsquo;clock the next day, punctually to the
  second, the Museum came into sight to the east of St. Quentin. It consisted
  of ten machines flying in V-shape formation, and as usual no one machine was
  like another. At the apex of the V was a monoplane with an unusually long
  nacelle, an unusually long and remarkably narrow wing spread.</p>

  <p>The observers, through their telescopes, reported that there was nothing
  more remarkable than the fact that the monoplane, in spite of its high engine
  power, did not lose place but maintained its position even though its
  companions were obviously more antiquated &ldquo;buses,&rdquo; but most
  remarkable of all was the report which came through Lieutenant Gordon T.
  Simms, an observer of the U..S. Air Service, an extract from whose report may
  be quoted:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">&ldquo;Until engaged by enemy patrols, I had an
  uninterrupted view of the enemy formation, which was led by a large monoplane
  resembling in appearance the old Antoinette, which acted as leader. At a
  distance of a mile or more I saw the Antoinette machine slow until it almost
  stopped, the remainder of the formation passing on until ten seconds later
  the formation had advanced leaving the Antoinette well in the rear. It had
  the appearance of being almost stationary for half a minute, at the end of
  which time it went forward again at great speed, and took its place at the
  head of the formation. In the position from which I observed this, it was
  impossible that I could be the victim of an optical illusion.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Air experts are equally emphatic that it is impossible that an airplane
  can stand still without losing height. The man who invented such a machine or
  a pilot who could employ mechanism to produce that result would very nearly
  solve the last problem of aviation.</p>

  <p>At three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, the Museum was seen following the
  line of the Scarpe in a southwesterly direction, escorted by twenty
  battle-planes in two formations of ten. The escort was attacked by the 904th,
  the 623d and the 612th squadrons of the British, and by the 120th and 121st
  flights of the U. S. Air Services, and by de Mouleys&rsquo; famous squadron
  of &ldquo;aces&rdquo;; and the battle which raged in the air has come to be
  historic. Fourteen German airplanes were crashed or driven down out of
  control and three British and one French. But in the course of the fighting
  the Museum got away. Again the report came through that the Antoinette had
  distinctly slowed her pace until she was almost at a standstill.</p>

  <p>Following this, three British bombing squadrons raided the aerodrome where
  the Museum was known to reside, and dropped particularly powerful bombs upon
  the underground hangars&mdash;ignoring the inviting array of matchwood sheds
  which the Germans had erected to draw the fire of raiders.</p>

  <p>On the twenty-first, the Museum, with the inevitable Antoinette at its
  head, but this time made up of much faster machines, came over the British
  lines and was attacked by the defensive squadrons, four of the Museum dying
  the death before their guardians could come to their assistance.</p>

  <p>Again the Antoinette escaped, and bitter were the words which came humming
  along the wire which connected G.H.Q. with the squadrons concerned. There was
  a great ringing of telephone bells, and secret discussions in locked offices
  where eminent officers consulted in Hindustani, to the intense annoyance of
  the military exchange.</p>

  <p>At eight o&rsquo;clock, Blackie walked into Tam&rsquo;s quarters, locked
  the door behind him, took from his pocket a map and a large-caliber pistol of
  unfamiliar pattern.</p>

  <p>Without any preliminary he began:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Antoinette is at the Gisors aerodrome&mdash;the experimental
  aerodrome to the north,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are not taking any chance
  with a bombing squadron. The hangar is certain to be underground. Here is a
  signal pistol we took from one of the Museum machines that crashed. It is
  loaded with a cartridge which shows a red and green light. That is the
  landing signal for this particular aerodrome.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam waited.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;G.H.Q. has heard about you and they want you to make a landing. You
  will probably be shot if you are caught. Here you are,&rdquo; he spread the
  map and laid his finger upon a green patch; &ldquo;<i>that</i> is a fairly
  level plain about two hundred yards from the aerodrome. Land there and get
  into the hangar as well as you can. You will destroy the machine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><a id="picNNN"
     name="picNNN"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1305041h-images/TFS-04.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>&ldquo;And they will make anither,&rdquo; said Tam.</p>

  <p>Blackie shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It will take them nine months to make another like it,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;I have seen the Director of Intelligence. He tells me that this
  Antoinette is being perfected in the air, and, that the Duke is the only man
  that can fly it so far. You may not be able to get back to your
  machine,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;but you must take the risk. Only use the
  landing light if they get an Archie barrage on you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook hands and walked abruptly away. He was sending his best man to
  his death, and. anything he might say, now, would be feeble and inadequate.
  Tam looked at the map and looked at the pistol, opened his desk and took out
  the letter which he had just finished writing.</p>

  <p>He added this P.S.:</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be awa&rsquo; to make a call on another
  aerodrome. Tam.&rdquo;</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p class="first">TO the north of Gisors is a small aerodrome consisting of
  about half a dozen flimsy huts and three underground hangars which are
  approached by broad sloping runways. The hangars themselves are protected by
  nine feet of sandbagging and so elaborately camouflaged that it would be
  impossible to detect from the air either the runway or the bulge of earth
  which corresponded to the roof of the underground chambers.</p>

  <p>In one of these were three men, two of them officers, one an old and
  spectacled mechanic in field-gray. The hangar was brilliantly illuminated
  with ground, roof and wall lights, so that there was not one bit of the long
  and dainty machine which stood in the center of the hangar that was not
  flooded with light.</p>

  <p class="first">THE younger of the officers and, if the truth be told, the
  least distinguished was, contrary to all regulations, smoking a long thin
  cigar and eyeing the machine with knitted brows. The second of the officers,
  an older man and one of higher rank, was shaking his head in admiration.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your Highness has performed a miracle,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;this
  will rank as one of the greatest mechanical discoveries of the
  war.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was the younger man&rsquo;s turn to shake his head. &ldquo;Not yet, von
  Grosser,&rdquo; he said sharply; &ldquo;you are premature. Perhaps in a month
  we may reduce the thing to a formula. At present I am making new discoveries
  every day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He walked slowly around the machine. There was nothing extraordinary in
  its appearance save that, in addition to the tractor screw in front, it
  carried a small propeller behind the driver&rsquo;s seat, a propeller which
  was fitted at a curious angle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Von Missen is very anxious to make a flight in her,&rdquo; said the
  older officer. &ldquo;I think he has recently arrived. I saw his landing
  lights a few moments ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Von Missen is a fool,&rdquo; said his Highness, &ldquo;and he would
  be a dead fool if he essayed it. Three times she has failed, for some reason
  I can not understand. But I shall get it right,&rdquo; he nodded; &ldquo;yes,
  I shall get it right. If&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If?&rdquo; repeated von Grosser.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If the people over there,&rdquo; he jerked his head to the west,
  &ldquo;don&rsquo;t get me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Von Grosser laughed. &ldquo;Your Highness may be assured that that will
  never happen,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;they have tried and failed. They have
  bombed every aerodrome between here and St. Quentin. Why,&rdquo; he shrugged,
  &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because they know, my friend, that if they get me, this
  machine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was looking at Colonel von Grosser as he spoke. The Colonel was facing
  the narrow entrance which admitted into the hangar when the great sliding
  doors were closed and he saw the other&rsquo;s eyebrows rise and a comical
  look of incredulity and annoyance dawn upon his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hands up, all of ye!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A figure stood in the doorway, his face half hidden by the mica goggles he
  still wore, puffed and padded from head to foot in a soiled yellow leather
  jacket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come oot o&rsquo; that,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;come oot,
  uncle!&rdquo; He waved the frightened mechanic to the far wall, &ldquo;which
  of ye is the Airchduke?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

  <p>The younger man laughed. &ldquo;I am the Grand Duke of Friesruhe,&rdquo;
  he said; &ldquo;if I am the person you are seeking?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And is that yer fine machine?&rdquo; said Tam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my fine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Something cracked from Tam&rsquo;s left hand, a blazing ball of fire leapt
  toward the machine, filling the hangar with a pungent and disagreeable odor.
  The ball struck one of the wings, which burst into a blaze.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thairmite,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t try to put it
  oot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Von Grosser, paralyzed by the apparition, suddenly came to life. His hand
  dropped to the holster at his belt, but before he could draw his weapon Tam
  shot him down. The Duke had been quicker. Two bullets from his automatic went
  through the leather jacket of the airman before Tam&rsquo;s pistol could
  swing round and cover him.</p>

  <p>The machine was now blazing furiously. The room was an inferno. Tam
  beckoned first the Duke and then the mechanic toward the little door and he
  himself dragged the wounded man to the safety of the little passage.</p>

  <p>Tam led the way up the steep incline to the open air. Suddenly he turned,
  and with a lightning blow felled the mechanic. Then he gripped the Duke by
  the arm and started at a jog-trot across the aerodrome.</p>

  <p>Dense volumes of smoke were pouring through the interstices. The alarm had
  already been given and the shouts of command came to them through the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; said the Duke suddenly and stopped
  dead.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;m going back to ma wee bed,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;and
  ye&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll take me dead,&rdquo; said the Duke in German and
  leaped at his captor.</p>

  <p>An arm like a bar of steel flung him backward.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By God, you shall suffer for this!&rdquo; said the breathless young
  man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, aye,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;d&rsquo; ye no&rsquo; ken
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to ken you, damn you,&rdquo; stormed the Duke in
  English.</p>

  <p>By this time they had passed through the fence wires which Tam had cut.
  The Scotsman was making his way with confident step toward the plain where
  his machine awaited him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;m Tam,&rdquo; he said complacently; &ldquo;d&rsquo;ye
  na&rsquo; ken Tam? A&rsquo;m Tam, the Scoot. Noo, Duke, over yon&rsquo;
  there&rsquo;s a bonnie machine wi&rsquo; a nice comfortable seat for an
  obsairver. Will ye be my obsairver back to the British fines?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Duke thought a moment. &ldquo;Under the circumstances, I think I
  will,&rdquo; he said.</p><br>

  <p class="first">HALF-WAY back, and what time all the telegraph wires leading
  into Germany were in a condition bordering on hysteria, and while
  search-lights swept the skies and Archie barrages worked double time, Tam
  leaned over and tapped the silent figure in the observer&rsquo;s seat upon
  the shoulder.</p>

  <p>The Duke adjusted the speaking-tube and listened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hand over yeer seegairs,&rdquo; said Tam, remembering at this, the
  eleventh hour, that something was due to him.</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>Everybody&lsquo;s Magazine</i>, December 1918</h3>

  <p class="first">THE entry of the United States into the European war may be
  likened to the entry of a large and enthusiastic boys&rsquo; school into a
  strange bathing-pond. There was a great leap, a monstrous splash, much
  laughter, many whoops of joy, a few yells of consternation and a considerable
  amount of spluttering. The experienced swimmers who were already in and were
  not finding the water any too fine, had been through exactly the same process
  before they learned the art of natation, and neither criticized nor sneered
  nor grew greatly hilarious, realizing that in time the hubbub would die down
  and there would be some desperately good swimming going on and that some of
  them would have to battle hard to keep abreast of the new material.</p>

  <p>They were not all amateurs, these new arrivals. There were some who could
  do fine breast strokes and wonderful overhand movements and there were others
  who floated quite nicely. These were the &ldquo;old contemptibles&rdquo; of
  the American Army, those wise and wicked men who had sneaked away to Europe
  disguised as Frenchmen, Canadians, Englishmen&mdash;any old thing that gave
  them the right to enter the war zone.</p>

  <p>Among the <i>voertrekkers</i> in the field of honor was a very
  considerable body of American gentlemen who were formed into a flying
  squadron attached to the French army and did truly wonderful work, being by
  nature adventurers. They earned world fame and deservedly so, for they did
  famous deeds which were chronicled in American newspapers and so fired the
  imagination of youthful America that when the big splash occurred, a large
  number of the swimmers made their way in the direction of those instructors
  in that peculiar form of warfare which is waged between the clouds and the
  stars.</p>

  <p>A volume of recruits flowed into the American aerodromes to learn their
  business, but there was nevertheless a steady trickle of youthful talent
  toward France. Americans who were wintering in Egypt, Americans who were
  observing Paris or amusing themselves in London, very naturally directed
  their steps toward the American headquarters in France. They thought, and
  there was reason for it, that they were losing time by going to America and
  taking unjustifiable risks from submarines. Moreover, they were most anxious
  to finish the war before the other America came in, and so they filled the
  anterooms of the American military attachés in various cities of the world
  and armed with imposing passports and divers documents, they made their way
  to a town, which we will call Bonville, where there had been established in
  the twinkling of an eye the nucleus of an American Air Service.</p>

  <p>The older men taught them the game&mdash;the stunts they found out for
  themselves. They did things which no reasonable and well-conducted airman
  should do, but everybody seemed to agree that under the circumstances those
  extraordinary departures from convention were wholly justified.</p>

  <p>Tam of the Scouts was sent on a swift single-seater to make certain
  observations of the country which extends from the back of the British line
  to the sea. He was discovering landmarks whereby hostile airmen could find
  their way to a certain naval port. Wherever these landmarks were too
  conspicuous they would be camouflaged; even the course of a river, which
  helped a bombing squadron at night, might so be changed in appearance that it
  would not serve for guidance.</p>

  <p>He reached the sea, circled over the port and headed back for his
  aerodrome. He was ten minutes&rsquo; distance from the town, that is to say,
  some fifteen miles, when he was attacked in the air by a large formation
  which when he approached it had been orderly and regular in its appearance,
  but which broke and broke unpleasantly when he came within rifle-shot. Two of
  the machines took no part in the attack. Their pilots were firing strangely
  colored lights with every evidence of agitation, but the remainder came upon
  him like a swarm of hornets and Tam was compelled to nose-dive into the
  middle of them, letting off his Lewis gun and very narrowly escaping a
  collision with a large and old-fashioned biplane which seemed to suffer from
  some chronic aeronautic affliction which caused it to loop the loop
  involuntarily.</p>

  <p>Tam planed down to within a thousand feet of the earth, fluttered and
  ruffled. It was not his business to fight people and certainly not his
  business to take on fifteen hostile airplanes single-handed, and as he had
  the foot of his enemies, he had no difficulty in shaking off all except one
  pursuer, who chased him back to the aerodrome and when he landed, plumped
  down within a dozen yards.</p>

  <p>Tam walked across to the pilot as he was hastily unbuckling the straps
  about his middle and addressed him sadly: &ldquo;Sirr,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;can ye no&rsquo; tell a Hun when ye see him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The flushed young man who had jumped from the chaser shrieked with
  laughter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is one on us! We thought you were
  a Heinie.&rdquo;</p>

  </div><br>

  <p class="first">IT transpired that Tam had butted into the kindergarten, the
  boldest kindergarten that had ever learned the C-A-T, cat, of aviation.</p>

  <p>Later came Captain Bredwell of the United States Army, a teacher of the
  new idea and a veteran of war. He was very apologetic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Training a set o&rsquo; pups is child&rsquo;s play compared with
  teaching these kids not to hit anything they see running loose. I tried to
  call &rsquo;em to heel and just as well might Noah have whistled for the dove
  after he had got well on his way to Ararat. I am very sorry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Blackie. &ldquo;Tam enjoyed it;
  didn&rsquo;t you, Tam?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Weel,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;A&rsquo;m no&rsquo; so sure.
  A&rsquo;ll be coming over your way to morrow, sir,&rdquo; he said to the
  American officer. &ldquo;What time do ye take your young gentlemen
  up?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From eleven till one, if the weather&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said the
  other.</p>

  <p>Tam nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;ll be coming about two,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
  ye&rsquo;ll recognize me by the fact that A&rsquo;m wearin&rsquo; a red rose
  in ma buttonhole and carrying the <i>Scotsman</i> in ma right
  hand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The kindergarten is pretty difficult to handle,&rdquo; confessed
  Captain Bredwell over the luncheon-table; &ldquo;you see, we haven&rsquo;t
  had time to ground them in the fear of God and military history. They are
  young, they are keen, they are full of spunk but they haven&rsquo;t got the
  hang of this military business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook his head reprovingly at the boy who had chased Tam back to the
  aerodrome, but the youth was at that moment in a heated discussion with
  Lieutenant Curten on the relative merits of British and American motor-cars,
  both, strangely enough, being the sons of men who had grown rich in
  exploiting the public passion for speed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no&rsquo; discipline that young Rain-in-the-Neck
  wants,&rdquo; said Tam&mdash;he had a trick of applying the nomenclature to
  be found in the works of his favorite authors to those who pleased him.
  &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a little machine-gun practise. He was on ma trail a&rsquo;
  the time and didna get me&mdash;Mon, that&rsquo;s inexcusable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What really happened, Tam?&rdquo; asked Baxter, and the babble of
  noise which accompanied every meal in the Umpty-fourth hushed to silence.</p>

  <p>Tam looked over his audience as an experienced lecturer might.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a fearfu&rsquo; experience,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;Wingin&rsquo; ma way homeward wi&rsquo; no thocht o&rsquo; danger,
  wi&rsquo; a blaw sky o&rsquo;erhead an&rsquo; the gay green airth beneath, A
  was thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; you young gentlemen an&rsquo; the veecious
  practise ye&rsquo;ve got into of smokin&rsquo; cigarettes that produce
  anemia, palpitation, hairt disease an&rsquo; cold feet, when ma attention was
  attracted by the appearance on ma starboard bow of a graund aggregation of
  talent that would have made Buff&rsquo;lo Bill tairn in his grave.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At the moment A did not realize &rsquo;twas the United States Airmv
  practisin&rsquo; for bluidy war. Ma first thocht was that &rsquo;twas a party
  of French bairdmen that had been celebratin&rsquo; the feast of the Moulin
  Rouge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; chuckled Captain Bredwell loyally, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
  rather tall&mdash;I guess the formation wasn&rsquo;t perfect,
  but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Some one whispered to him and he sat back with a grin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whilst ma mind was occupied wi&rsquo; givin&rsquo; the merry pairty
  a wide miss,&rdquo; continued Tam, &ldquo;the&mdash;what you might tairm for
  want of a better word&mdash;formation broke up an&rsquo; the ghastly truth
  dawned on me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a Wild West show,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;yes
  sirrs! There was buckin&rsquo; broncos, an&rsquo; shairpshooters, an&rsquo;
  lasooers, an&rsquo; wild Injans an&rsquo; the pairformance started
  promptly&mdash;there was no waitin&rsquo;. Whilst I was attacked on the right
  by Sittin&rsquo; Bull an&rsquo; on the left by Denver Dan, Mexican Joe dived
  from above, utterin&rsquo; the war-cry or totem or what-not of his fierce
  clan. Alkali Ike tried to ram me&mdash;or tried not to ram me, A don&rsquo;t
  know which, but the result was nearly the same. The Colorado Kid caught ma
  controls a swat wi&rsquo; his sixty-six shooter&mdash;an&rsquo; A was chased
  to ma old log cabin by Rain-in-the-Neck howlin&rsquo; for the blood of the
  paleface.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam&rsquo;s acquaintance with the technique of the classics was an
  extensive one. He went on in his singsong tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of the rest of the story there is na much to be told.&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;Tam, the indomitable scoot, is noo an auld man wi&rsquo; gray
  hair, an&rsquo; may be seen, leadin&rsquo; his grandson to the scene of his
  great ficht, pointin&rsquo; oot the place in the sky where he was nearly
  straffit. Denver Dan ended his evil life in a low drinkin&rsquo; shanty,
  Rain-in-the-Neck is a Bug Hoose, whilst the Colorado Kid got releegion
  an&rsquo; made money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was terrific applause when Tam finished&mdash;loudest of all from
  that same Rain-in-the-Neck (in private life Cadet Cyril Yanderberg).</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE story of Tam&rsquo;s encounter with the kindergarten
  became public property. From Dunkirk down to Belfort hundreds of messes
  recounted the story with such embellishments as fancy dictated and in a
  remarkably short space of time it came to the ears of Captain Fritz von
  Stoffel, and naturally von Stoffel was greatly interested, for he was chief
  of the Baby-killers&rsquo; Circus.</p>

  <p>It must be said that the babies he killed were mostly Germans. He was a
  disciplinarian of the fierce and fiery type. He never spoke, he barked. His
  lightest whisper was something between a rifle-shot and the explosion of a
  pop-gun. He had never raided London nor had he raided any of the villages
  that lie between the Kentish coast and the metropolis. Indeed he had never
  crossed blue water. He earned his title of Baby-killer because his specialty
  lay in the strafing of rest-camps, hospitals, unprotected artillery bases and
  observation balloons. He took few risks and in consequence endured very few
  casualties in air fighting; indeed, the heaviest death-roll resulted from his
  practise of sending nervous young pilots aloft in a high wind.</p>

  <p>Now, most circuses are sporting. They are out looking for trouble and when
  they find it they get as close as they can and stay as long as it is safe,
  but everybody knows that von Stoffel&rsquo;s circus never did anything which
  could be exaggerated into recklessness. It so happened when the news of
  Tam&rsquo;s adventure came to the gallant captain that he had received a hint
  from the head-quarters of the corps to which he was attached&mdash;one of
  those broad Prussian hints that left a scar&mdash;that his cautiousness was
  developing into a vice, and it was suggested that it might be necessary to
  ask him to take a long leave for the benefit of his health and hand his
  command over to his junior.</p>

  <p>Von Stoffel spent an evening in his stuffy and airless dugout grappling
  with &ldquo;A Plan.&rdquo; That plan, set forth with much detail, was
  delivered into the hands of the corps commander and by him transmitted to
  Highest Authority, retransmitted to the corps commander with certain
  hieroglyphics of approval scrawled upon its margin and by him forwarded to
  von Stoffel, who did everything but kiss the aforesaid hieroglyphics in his
  ecstatic happiness.</p><br>

  <p class="first">TAM of the Scouts was ordered one fine day to take a flight
  into Darkest France, and pursue investigations concerning the transportation
  of German troops westward. Two of his machines developed engine trouble and
  returned and Tam went on with the two that remained and had a most exciting
  morning. For though his machine was a scout and not of the bombing type, he
  carried four bombs for exactly the same reason that the average Western
  citizen carries a gun in his hip pocket, and passing over a seemingly
  deserted aerodrome he dropped a couple to discover whether anybody was at
  home.</p>

  <p>He had hardly observed the bursts before his machine was ringed with
  well-aimed shrapnel. Whereupon his two companions, who were quite out of the
  danger zone, very naturally closed into it and one of these secured a direct
  hit upon a building which Tam surmised must have been the private brewery of
  that aerodrome, for he and his companions were immediately attacked with
  unparalleled ferocity by the owners of the aerodrome, who had been out
  hunting and approached their home behind the cover which a stratum of cloud
  afforded.</p>

  <p>Whereupon the three British airmen decided that it was getting very late
  and streaked westward, all out, losing a little height to increase the margin
  which lay between them and their pursuers. They passed over the line,
  disgracefully deserted at this particular moment by fighting craft, with six
  machines still in pursuit.</p>

  <p>Now, no airman, in whatever distress of mind he may be, will fly from an
  enemy over his own territory, even should the enemy be overwhelmingly
  stronger, and in conformity with the unwritten law of air fighting, no sooner
  had the zigzag of trenches been left in his rear than Tam signalled
  &ldquo;Engage&rdquo; and swung round to meet his enemies.</p>

  <p>Two modern air-planes separated at a distance of four-hundred and fifty
  yards approach each other at such a speed that they pass in the time that you
  can count six. In three of these seconds the decisive battle is fought.
  Either you &ldquo;get&rdquo; your enemy, your enemy &ldquo;gets&rdquo; you,
  or you &ldquo;get&rdquo; one another.</p>

  <p>In a flash as they passed Tam saw the enemy pilot drop, and as he himself
  had no inclination to drop, he knew he had won, unless the enemy observer had
  escaped and was using the dual controls.</p>

  <p>Imagine these two machines passing each other on a parallel course and a
  second later a third machine dropping from the blue and missing the tail of
  the attacker by inches. Picture a second British machine falling after this
  bolt, his gun shooting vertically earthward, along the nacelle of the diving
  German; imagine two other enemy machines banking over and shooting sideways
  and indiscriminately at Tam and his assistant&mdash;a roaring, whirling
  mix-up of air-planes bucking and jumping, slipping, climbing and diving, and
  suppose that all this happens in the space of some twenty seconds, and you
  visualize an air battle at its most intense period.</p>

  <p>Tam looked down as the second machine fell in flames and began his glide
  to earth, for he did not need to see the remainder of the enemy flight wheel
  eastward to know that the battle was over. One of his own machines was going
  down in circles. Tam saw this and wrinkled his nose&mdash;that was the only
  sign of sorrow he ever showed&mdash;and there was reason enough, for that
  easy spiral which was bringing a dead pilot and a dead observer to earth
  would end in a crash.</p>

  <p>Tam&rsquo;s report was almost uninteresting by the side of another report
  which was being flashed along the wire to Headquarters Intelligence. It was
  the report of a young and keen intelligence officer who had sat by the
  bedside of a dying German air-man, one of those whom Tam had grounded, and
  had listened to the unconscious man as he talked of his home in Darmstadt and
  his mother and the fishing on the Moselle, and how splendid it would be to go
  to Marienbad this summer and other things which had made the intelligence
  officer lean over the bed, listening intently and scribbling notes in the
  little book he whipped from his tunic pocket.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE air-man died before he said very much. If he had died
  sooner he would have saved the German army quite a number of casualties.</p>

  <p>Tam was roused from his bed at midnight by the entrance of his
  superior.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry to wake you from your beauty sleep.&rdquo; said Blackie,
  putting no hint of sorrow in his voice, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s the greatest
  stunt on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam sat up in bed blinking at the electric light.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take an interest, you sleepy devil,&rdquo; said Blackie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, aye,&rdquo; said Tam. &ldquo;A&rsquo;m awfu&rsquo; interested.
  A&rsquo;m speechless wi&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blackie sat himself on the bed. &ldquo;The Hun is going to strafe the
  kindergarten to-morrow,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you butted into the Baby-
  killers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo; said Tam, wide awake. &ldquo;It was
  no&rsquo; von Stoffel?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was von Stoffel,&rdquo; nodded Blackie, &ldquo;and you
  interrupted a practise attack. I have always said the kindergarten flies too
  near the line for safety. I don&rsquo;t think they will after this. It is a
  pretty low-down thing to do, but I suppose it&rsquo;s fair. Von Stoffel is
  taking big flights to-morrow and intends swooping down on the kindergarten
  and there shall be a great slaughtering of innocents, according to the plan.
  Intelligence found it out and you are for the stunt,&rdquo; he shook his head
  mournfully. &ldquo;You are a lucky beggar,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t mind admitting that I asked to go in your place, but my life is
  much too valuable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is the stunt?&rdquo; asked Tam.</p>

  <p>Blackie chuckled. &ldquo;The kindergarten will remain in school to-
  morrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;their places in the air will be taken by the
  aces. All the squadrons in this part of the world are to send one. You are
  the representative of the Umpty-fourth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam swung his legs out of bed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to get up,&rdquo; said Blackie, &ldquo;the
  stunt isn&rsquo;t on for another nine hours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mon,&rdquo; said Tam. unbuttoning his pajama jacket,
  &ldquo;&rsquo;twill take me that time to learn the American
  language.&rdquo;</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p class="first">AT five o&rsquo;clock in the morning two specially chosen
  patrols flew to the region of the kindergarten&rsquo;s aerodrome and began
  sweeping the skies eastward, forming a barrage through which no inquisitive
  Hun might pass. They were not protecting the kindergarten, far from it. They
  had a certain duty to perform and when that was performed, as it was by eight
  o&rsquo;clock, the patrols signalled one another good-by and departed for
  their homes, leaving the way clear for von Stoffel, who was due at eleven,
  that being the hour when the kindergarten took the air.</p>

  <p>But between five and eight the aces began to arrive, sweeping down from
  great heights and ranging themselves in nice orderly lines on the broad
  expanse of the aerodrome. Tam was the first to arrive. De Rochleaux, with
  twenty-nine crashed to his credit, was the second. Mildred of the Hundred and
  Umpty-first Squadron, who had on one memorable occasion taken on a circus
  single-handed and had brought down six machines, was the third, and after his
  arrival the aces fell thick and fast.</p>

  <p>Le Fevre, Runnymede, Lord Arthur Saxman, Townly, the American instructor
  with eighteen skull-and-cross-bones painted on the nose of his machine to
  represent the eighteen sad occurrences to the German Army, Minter &ldquo;the
  guardian of Ypres&rdquo;&mdash;they all met for breakfast, full of joy at the
  forthcoming meeting. They took the air at 10:15, flying raggedly, the most
  beautiful piece of camouflage that was ever seen in the air.</p>

  <p>At exactly the same hour von Stoffel snapped the case of his great gold
  watch and remarked to his obsequious adjutant: &ldquo;Before we come back the
  American correspondents will have something to write home about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He glanced down at the long line of airplanes, pilots in their places,
  mechanics standing by the propellers, and raised his hand in a signal.
  Instantly there was a roaring and snorting, thudding and thundering din of
  engines. His hand dropped and his graceful Fokker leaped forward and zoomed
  up at an acute angle. One after the other the squadron followed and ten
  minutes later the formation was in being.</p>

  <p>Von Stoffel, sitting in the cock-pit before the pilot, fired his signal
  pistol and the big circus moved westward. The German commander adjusted his
  ear-piece and speaking-tube, fired off a few rounds from his gun to test it
  and then gave himself up to the enjoyable prospect before him.</p>

  <p>The circus crossed the British lines and were greeted by Archie in the
  usual manner. Von Stoffel, his powerful field-glasses to his eyes, searched
  the distant heavens.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! There they are,&rdquo; he said triumphantly, and signaled
  &ldquo;Enemy in Sight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall have to climb,&rdquo; said a voice in his ears, the voice
  of his squadron&rsquo;s crack pilot, &ldquo;they are much higher than
  we.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are we flying at?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ten thousand feet, Herr Captain; they are at twelve
  thousand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This was hitch number one. The reconnaissance patrols which von Stoffel
  had sent out had reported that the kindergarten never flew higher than eight
  thousand feet. The baby-killer signaled a change of direction and asked for
  altitude and the big formation began climbing. Again the direction was
  changed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are climbing too,&rdquo; said the voice of his pilot. &ldquo;I
  think they are going up to fifteen thousand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Von Stoffel swore and again his squadron climbed.</p>

  <p>The spurious kindergarten watched these maneuvers with the greatest
  hilarity. Lord Arthur Saxman, by reason of his seniority, commanded the right
  wing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bags I the great white chief,&rdquo; he said joyously and went down
  in an alarming nose-dive, working both his guns&mdash;for he was a two-gun
  man and ambidextrous.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That big bomb for mine!&rdquo; said Captain Bredwell and dropped
  simultaneously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Big fellow, I want ye,&rdquo; and Tam dropped, his gun rapping
  furiously.</p>

  <p>This was all very hard luck on von Stoffel, because either of these aces
  could have settled him.</p>

  <p>Of the twenty-two strafers that set forth to beat up the kindergarten,
  four came back, two limping, if a knocking engine be the equivalent to a
  limp, and a German communiqué of that night read:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">&ldquo;WE CONDUCTED A SUCCESSFUL RAID UPON AN AMERICAN
  AVIATION CENTER. SEVERAL MACHINES WERE SEEN TO FALL IN FLAMES. ALL OUR
  MACHINES RETURNED SAFELY.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>This telegram, thoughtfully transmitted from headquarters to the
  kindergarten mess, where they were entertaining the noisiest bunch of guests
  that had ever assembled, embellished the end of a perfect day.</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>Everbody's Magazine</i>, January 1919</h3>

  <p class="first">TAM of the Scouts sat enthroned on the edge of the billiard
  table&mdash;which, appropriately enough, since he formed the topic of
  conversation, was a luxury donated by the Splendiferous Lieutenant
  Walker-Mannsell whose paternal relative was reputed to have so much money
  that he had refused war contracts. This Splendiferous One, still spoken of by
  the squadron with affection and amusement, lay in a little grave to the west
  of Mossy Face Wood, and that the squadron joked about him is accounted for by
  the fact that the men of the R.F.C. never die, and, accordingly, are never
  invested with solemn post-mortem virtues designed to prove that they were
  really too good to live.</p>

  <p>Therefore he was &ldquo;The Splendiferous One&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;S.W.M.&rdquo; and men roared over the jokes told against him&mdash;and
  if they always ended the story with &ldquo;good old Splendif, he was a lad of
  the village&rdquo;&mdash;why, they would have done the same if he had been
  just outside the mess-room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A call to mind an argument wi&rsquo; Mr. Walker-Mannseel,&rdquo;
  said Tam. (Observe that Tam was a sergeant when the boy was living and Tam
  regarded it as extremely disrespectful to quote the nickname he would never
  have employed to one who was his superior.) &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas hoo much an
  ordinary spendthreeft could spend in a day if he&rsquo;d gie his mind to
  it&mdash;A said five dollars, but the wee lad rather thocht that if a body
  corn-centrated he micht spend seex.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good old Splendiferous,&rdquo; said Blackie, laughing with the
  rest; &ldquo;but you haven&rsquo;t told us what happened to
  Goldheimer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam had begun the story of the magnificent Goldheimer and had drifted
  through a dissertation on plutocracy in the field, to one of the best loved
  of his officers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Goldheimer&rdquo; had been born Thysen-Hyndorpf. He had been born
  with a steel ingot in his mouth, for his parent had been the veritable
  Theodore Thysen, the Westphalian steel baron. His brother officers had named
  him Goldheimer and even worse, and in due course the fame of him came to the
  right side of the line, and his photograph, cut from a Berlin society
  journal, adorned the green notice-board of the mess of the Umpty-fourth.</p>

  <p>There he smirked, with his stout, vacant face, his stiff little mustache,
  his tiny monocle, his imposing <i>Pickelhaube</i>, and men of the patrol on
  their way to the sheds would stop and examine the features thoughtfully and
  wonder if it was their luck to get him that day.</p>

  <p>Goldheimer was rich&mdash;rich beyond the dreams of actresses. He was so
  rich that if he had written down his fortune in marks he would have had
  writer&rsquo;s cramp before he reached the last cipher.</p>

  <p>He was so offensively rich that every hard-up subaltern of the R.F.C.
  pined for his destruction.</p>

  <p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Twas no&rsquo; like the lad to be oot before the air was
  war-m,&rdquo; said Tam, resuming his narrative at the point where it had been
  diverted, &ldquo;an&rsquo; ye may imagine ma surprise, when passin&rsquo; to
  the sooth o&rsquo; Cambrai&mdash;at the place where the Hoon has five or six
  bridges across the canal&mdash;to obsairve the expensive ootfit of Mc
  Goldheimer riskin&rsquo; the mornin&rsquo; air. There was no mistakin&rsquo;
  him. His seelver-mounted wings, the graund gold monogram on his silken wings,
  the filigree fusilage by Mr. Benny Vinturo, the heavy di&rsquo;mond buckles
  to his stays, the jeweled engine an&rsquo; the gun-metal gunwork of his gun.
  &lsquo;Tam,&rsquo; says A to mesel&rsquo;, &lsquo;are ye no&rsquo; ashamed to
  be seen oot in the same sky as yon? Awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; ye!&rsquo; A says,
  &lsquo;be off an&rsquo; brush yeer pants an&rsquo; change yeer
  cravat&mdash;look at Mc Goldheimer,&rsquo; A says, &lsquo;take a lesson from
  him&mdash;follow him,&rsquo; A says&mdash;so A followed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He sat in his seat a fine figure of a man. His surtout or haubeck
  was of some clingin&rsquo; material that clung. Aboot his shapely heid was a
  broad band of dull gold richly encrusted wi&rsquo; uncut rubies; a simple
  collar of celluloid an&rsquo; mother-of-pairl or father-of-concrete completed
  the picture.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A dived for to make his acquaintance. But he was prood. The haughty
  intolerance which comes from generations spent in the board-room
  cuttin&rsquo; down expenses would not allow him to unbend. He side-flopped
  wi&rsquo; dignity, but A was no&rsquo; to be shaken off.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ma mannie,&rsquo; says&rsquo; A, &lsquo;do ye no&rsquo; ken
  that Tam o&rsquo; the Scoots is on yeer trail? Have ye no creepin&rsquo;
  sensation up an&rsquo; down yeer spine to tell ye that the terror of the
  cloods is stayin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; ye?&rsquo; Apparently not. Wi&rsquo; the
  courage of despair the reckless millionaireman tairned on his remorseless
  pursuer, his coorse face inflamed wi&rsquo; drink, high livin&rsquo;
  an&rsquo; annoyance. He glared at his persecutor, the gold fillin&rsquo;s of
  his teeth quiverin&rsquo; with passion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glancin&rsquo; scornfully at his puny opponent he banked o&rsquo;er
  and got the sun* of his absent-minded but resourceful foe. &rsquo;Twas a
  contest that Homer or Rudyard Kiplin&rsquo; would have taken the elevator to
  see. Capital an&rsquo; labor battled in the cloods. The hated money classes
  an&rsquo; the sweatin&rsquo; proletariat joined issues. The idle
  rich&mdash;an&rsquo; no&rsquo; so idle wasn&rsquo;t that lad as ye&rsquo;ll
  notice, if ye take a squint at the wings of ma wee Kitten&mdash;the idle rich
  an&rsquo; the haggard toiler, alone, or nearly alone, under the
  watchin&rsquo; stars, focht that the wairld should be made safe for
  democracy.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* &ldquo;Getting the sun&rdquo; is to get between the
  sun and your enemy.]</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It ended a&rsquo; too soon,&rdquo; said Tam sadly. &ldquo;A came
  down in a fine dive an&rsquo; loosed ma last drum at the diamond sun-burst he
  wore on the back of his neck an&rsquo; he responded. Instantly gold bullets
  was hailin&rsquo; aboot my ears. If A&rsquo;d stayed long enough A&rsquo;d
  have died a millionaire. Dazzled an&rsquo; blinded A broke off the unequal
  contest an&rsquo; dropped slowly to airth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which means that Goldheimer&rsquo;s patrol got on your tail and
  strafed you?&rdquo; suggested Baxter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye&mdash;something like that,&rdquo; admitted Tam; &ldquo;there
  were ten o&rsquo; the lads&mdash;Tam could have tackled nine&mdash;but the
  fearless boy fra&rsquo; Glasgow was outnumbered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Goldheimer putting on frills?&rdquo; somebody asked and Tam
  smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;d be sorry to lose the wee feller&mdash;he&rsquo;s a graund
  practise for the young an&rsquo; inexperienced aviator.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In real life, whatever may be the case in fiction, the multi-millionaire,
  even though he may have inherited his fortune, is very infrequently a fool.
  He may generally be distinguished by his uneasiness, his suspicion and that
  shrewd business ability which we associate with confidence men. Nor are stout
  young men who affect monocles and wear ridiculous mustaches necessarily
  brainless, lethargic and addicted to the four <i>a.m</i>. habit.</p>

  <p>Goldheimer was a notable illustration of the fact that great possessions
  sometimes go hand in hand with great mental capacities.</p>

  <p>Many crack pilots, French and British, had gone out to say how d&rsquo;ye
  do to the Goldheimer patrol and had come back more cracked than ever. He was
  fat but nippy. His eye was glassy, but behind the sights of a machine-gun it
  had all the robust qualities of the big game hunter. He was ridiculous but
  his airmanship was sublime. The scalps of seventeen British machines hung to
  his bomb-proof wigwam and he was always out to add to his collection.</p>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;As like as not the puir lad&rsquo;ll be shot down by
  an Archie that&rsquo;s aimin&rsquo; at somethin&rsquo; else,&rdquo; said Tam,
  &ldquo;or he&rsquo;ll fall to the kindergarten&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which reminds me,&rdquo; said Blackie, looking up from his cards,
  &ldquo;I am going to plant a Hun** on you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *&ldquo;Hun&rdquo; is a term applied to all aviation
  recruits.]</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A Hun!&rdquo; said Tam is consternation.</p>

  <p>Blackie&rsquo;s eyes twinkled as he nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cadet William Best of the United States Army,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;They are breaking up the kindergarten and attaching one youngster to
  each of the French and British squadrons. As a matter of fact,&rdquo; he went
  on, &ldquo;you will find William quite a pleasant young man, he has already
  had some air-fighting experience. He attached himself to the Camelot Squadron
  about six months ago and though he has not undergone his full technical
  course, he is a pretty wise bird.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam had got down from the billiard table and was looking dolefully at his
  superior.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am A to understand, Major Blackie, sir, that A must teach this
  young gentleman controls?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no, Tam,&rdquo; laughed Blackie, &ldquo;not so bad as that. You
  will just give him tips on air fighting. From what I have heard of him he
  does not require much tuition. Be at the office to-morrow morning at ten
  o&rsquo;clock and I will introduce you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At that hour Tam met his pupil. He was young, very young. His face was
  fresh and pink like a girl&rsquo;s, his gray eyes, full of laughter, were lit
  with those eager fires which God kindles in children to warm the ashes of
  their parents&rsquo; hearts.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is Cadet Best,&rdquo; introduced Blackie; &ldquo;this is
  Second Lieutenant McTavish who will take you under his wing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad to meet you,&rdquo; said Cadet William Best joyously and
  extended a large, firm hand.</p>

  <p>Tam and his charge surveyed one another in an amused silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is all,&rdquo; said Blackie after an embarrassing pause.</p>

  <p>Tam jerked his head to his companion and they passed out of the
  office.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have ye a bed, sir?&rdquo; asked Tam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;I carry one around in my grip,&rdquo; said the cheerful
  youth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What A mean,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;have ye a place to lay yeer
  weary heid if ye survive the dangers an&rsquo; perils o&rsquo; the
  elements?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cadet William Best grinned and shook a head which in its bright-eyed
  alertness showed no signs of weariness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Weel,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll bunk wi&rsquo; me. If ye
  leave the door open an&rsquo; sleep wi&rsquo; yeer feet oot o&rsquo; the
  window there&rsquo;ll be room for ye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>No other word was spoken. Tam led the way with dignity, opened the door of
  his quarters and ushered his friend into the little room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do ye smoke?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would ye like a seegair?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Try me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam thought a while. &ldquo;Yeer too young for seegairs,&rdquo; he said;
  &ldquo;they try the nairves an&rsquo; weaken the nairvous
  system&mdash;A&rsquo;ll give ye a stick o&rsquo; candy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He groped under his bed and produced a large box of familiar tint and
  embellishment. This he opened, disclosing a platoon of large cigars lying
  stiffly at &ldquo;attention&rdquo; wearing the gold and scarlet waist-belts
  of their caste.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps ye&rsquo;d better smoke,&rdquo; said Tam gloomily;
  &ldquo;they cost one franc twenty-five per, an&rsquo; A doot if they&rsquo;re
  paid for.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; said Mr. Best enthusiastically; &ldquo;these look good
  to me&mdash;where do you buy &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A dinna buy seegairs,&rdquo; said Tam. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re donated
  by ma friends, admirers&mdash;an&rsquo; pupils.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I get you,&rdquo; nodded the other, puffing luxuriously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;m a prood an&rsquo; tetchy feller,&rdquo; said Tam;
  &ldquo;ye must no&rsquo; hairt ma feelin&rsquo;s by handin&rsquo; &rsquo;em
  to me in a coorse an&rsquo; brutal manner. Ye must just leave &rsquo;em
  aroond careless an&rsquo; A&rsquo;ll find &lsquo;em&mdash;yeer name is
  William, A doot?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;William,&rdquo; agreed the pupil.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;ll be callin&rsquo; ye Billy,&rdquo; said Tam;
  &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a nickname A&rsquo;ve invented. Ye&rsquo;ll be Billy
  Best&mdash;no, ye&rsquo;ll be Boy Billy Best inside this room so that ye may
  retain a sense of ma superiority in age, morals an&rsquo; proved efficiency.
  Ye may call me Tam an&rsquo; ye may sleep on that bed when the sheets are
  changed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where will you sleep?&rdquo; demanded Billy Best with a hint of
  truculence in his tone.</p>

  <p>Tam rubbed his chin. &ldquo;A&rsquo;ll sleep on the floor&mdash;A prefair
  it. A&rsquo;ve never slept in a bed in ma life. Gie me a heap o&rsquo; slag
  an&rsquo; a couple o&rsquo; bricks an&rsquo; A wouldna&rsquo; call the king
  ma uncle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy drew at his cigar deliberately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may can all that sleeping-on-the-cold-ground stuff,&rdquo; he
  said; &ldquo;the floor for mine&mdash;I&rsquo;m a hog-sleeper. Nothing short
  of a head-on collision wakes me and I prefer broken glass to
  Ostermoors.&rdquo;*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* An American matress brandname.]</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A could never sleep in a bed,&rdquo; protested Tam;
  &ldquo;&rsquo;tis effiminate practise an&rsquo; weakens the army&rsquo;s
  morale.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The timely arrival of the quartermaster sergeant with a fatigue party and
  a second bed put an end to the discussion.</p>

  <p>It was after this was installed and the heavy-footed mechanics had
  departed that Billy Best, acquainting himself with his new surroundings,
  discovered things behind a cretonne curtain&mdash;four rows of shelf tightly
  packed with literature; not the commonplace literature stiffly bound and
  consistently neglected which you would find in a library of the literary
  dilettante; not the musty tomes that decorate the study of the professor, but
  bright, vital, red-blooded stories between paper covers of lurid design.</p>

  <p>Tam was writing at his table when he heard a gasp and looking up, went
  very red, for Billy Best, his eyes blazing with joy, was examining a twenty-
  four page monograph devoted to the life and death of Yellowstone Jim who was
  (as the explanatory subtitle revealed) The Lone Bandit of Crow&rsquo;s Nest
  Canyon.</p>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; want to be readin&rsquo; that
  stuff,&rdquo; said Tam uncomfortably&mdash;he was a little sensitive with
  strangers; &ldquo;they belong to a young frind o&rsquo; mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say you haven&rsquo;t read them?&rdquo; asked the
  amazed youth. &ldquo;See here&mdash;if you haven&rsquo;t, make a start. This
  is the only stuff worth reading. You can have your Scotts and Dickenses and
  Thackerays&mdash;this is meat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Weel,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;A&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; say A
  haven&rsquo;t glanced through these degradin&rsquo; wairks of
  fiction.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw!&rdquo; grunted the boy, &ldquo;degrading nothing&mdash;this is
  life! Look at this one, &lsquo;The Pawnee Cache or Black Dick&rsquo;s Fight
  for Fortune&rsquo;&mdash;one of the best yarns&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mon, it&rsquo;s easy to see ye&rsquo;ve no&rsquo; read&mdash;here
  gie me the books&mdash;here it is. &lsquo;Mollie the Moorman or The Thugs of
  Utah&rsquo;&mdash;when ye&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; aboot stories will ye cast
  yeer eye o&rsquo;er that yin!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam was excited now&mdash;Billy Best&rsquo;s voice was raised to a key of
  dispute.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nutty, Tam! This Pawnee Cache yarn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>We may leave them to their disputation. Wiser men, men grown gray in the
  service of Arts and Letters, have argued as fiercely and with less kindliness
  over matters in no sense more important.</p>

  <p>At ten o&rsquo;clock the next morning Tam and his new assistant took the
  air&mdash;Tam at the controls, Billy in the cockpit for&rsquo;ard.</p>

  <p>Tam&rsquo;s plan was to spend the morning in stunts. He outlined the
  program after breakfast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll acquaint ye with the spinnin&rsquo; nose-dive, the
  windmill loop, the tail dive, the oot o&rsquo; control dive, the stall
  an&rsquo; the fa&rsquo; an&rsquo; ither pretty exercises.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bully,&rdquo; said Billy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s verra dangerous,&rdquo; cautioned Tam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you won&rsquo;t hurt Tam,&rdquo; said Billy,
  &ldquo;and if you don&rsquo;t hurt Tam you won&rsquo;t hurt Billy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;the controls go
  wrang&mdash;sometimes when one&rsquo;s thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; trouble doon
  drops the Imperial Gairman Circus &ldquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Circuses arc my vice,&rdquo; said Billy, speaking with some
  difficulty.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;m no&rsquo; so sure o&rsquo; yeer judgment,&rdquo; said Tam
  before the start; &ldquo;but A like yeer appetite&mdash;do ye ever stop
  eatin,&rsquo; Billy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy blushed guiltily and almost choked in swallowing the chunk of candy
  that was bulging his cheek.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My people send me lots of candy,&rdquo; he said apologetically;
  &ldquo;it helps pass time between smokes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It takes attention from the wairk,&rdquo; said Tam sternly;
  &ldquo;ha&rsquo; ye any in yeer pooch?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy meekly produced from the pocket of his leather jacket a sticky mass
  so completely at one with its paper wrapping that it was difficult to tell
  where paper ended and candy began.</p>

  <p>Tam took it with a grimace of disgust, bit it in two and handed the other
  half to its owner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; asked Billy anxiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A have no&rsquo; finished eatin&rsquo; through the paper,&rdquo;
  mumbled Tam; &ldquo;in wi&rsquo; ye!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p class="first">HE PUSHED the machine steeply upward, grinned as he saw the
  boy handling the gun in the bow and cast his hopeful eyes round to left and
  right for something to kill, and banked to reach a cloud base.</p>

  <p>His scheme was to go through the mist &ldquo;all out&rdquo;&mdash;an
  unnerving experience for the tyro&mdash;and to end with a nose fall. He
  opened up, hit the cloud and was instantly engulfed in a blind white mist, so
  dense that glancing back he could only catch occasional glimpses of his
  tail.</p>

  <p>The gloom, at first hardly noticeable, increased in density. From pale
  gray the light went yellow, umber and then a blackness as of night.</p>

  <p>Tam glanced at his compass and brought the head of his machine to the
  north; but three minutes passed without the darkness lessening. It was not an
  unusual experience for Tam, whatever it might be for the boy in the cockpit.
  The density and width of clouds are difficult to gage, particularly when they
  are approached at their own level.</p>

  <p>Another minute passed and Tam moved the joy-stick. The nose of the machine
  dropped and down, down roared the big airplane.</p>

  <p>Billy had a momentary sensation of sickness, but that passed. He felt that
  nature with her trick of improvising conditions to meet circumstances had
  rearranged his digestive system so that it should be as near as possible to
  his throat. He moved his head slightly to get a better view of the
  nothingness which was leaping to meet him, and the pressure of the air nearly
  wrenched his head from his neck. Then the blackness blended swiftly with
  umber-yellow-gray, and Billy was looking down at a neat little world all
  checkered with fields and laced with white roads. Also, there were five
  airplanes about a thousand feet beneath and each of these bore on its wings
  that strange device, a black iron cross.</p>

  <p>If the truth be told there was nothing auriferous or magnificent in the
  appearance of Goldheimer&rsquo;s patrol. There were neither silver fittings
  nor gold mountings nor jeweled holdings. It was just a business-like
  collection of fighting planes. Tam knew it&mdash;Billy knew nothing except
  that This Was the Life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gun!&rdquo; wheezed a voice through the speaking tube; &ldquo;aim
  between ... pilot ... obsairver ... tak&rsquo; the left-hand machine ...
  don&rsquo;t tak&rsquo; yeer eyes off him till he crashes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy Best adjusted his sights with a jerk of his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; thundered a voice in his ear and Billy fired.</p>

  <p>The leader&rsquo;s machine put up her tail and dropped, Tam in pursuit,
  four enemy machines behind him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s smokin&rsquo;, Billy!&rdquo; yelled the voice in the
  speaking tube; &ldquo;hit him anither crack an&rsquo; get ready to shoot
  up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy was obeying when the machine turned over and slipped sideways. He
  looked round and met the goggled eyes of Tam&mdash;or one eye, for the other
  was screwed up in a ferocious wink. Another machine was swooping and Billy
  brought up the muzzle of his gun and sent a shower of nickel ripping through
  the canvas of the wing. Amateurs&rsquo; luck is proverbial. Before he knew
  what had happened or realized that he had brought it about in some mysterious
  way, the wing of the attacker collapsed. It leaped up as though it had been
  struck by a gigantic hammer from beneath.</p>

  <p><a id="picNNN"
     name="picNNN"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Round went Tam&rsquo;s machine to avoid the debris&mdash;there was a
  momentary glimpse of a falling body, of two figures helmeted and masked, of a
  big white tail ornamented with iron crosses&mdash;and then nothing.</p>

  <p>Tam had maneuvered for height, but the three enemy machines had reformed
  and were full of fight.</p>

  <p>The little pilot weighed the chances and decided in favor of an early
  lunch. He feinted to climb, then, without warning, dropped earthward,
  skimming over the lines and rising only sufficiently to clear the avenue of
  poplars two miles beyond which the aerodrome lay.</p>

  <p>He unstrapped himself and assisted Billy Best to land.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Weel?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>Billy&rsquo;s face was sad, his tone querulous. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t
  you let me finish the others?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

  <p>Tam looked him over before replying. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye ken what
  ye&rsquo;ve done this morn, ma lad?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;I&rsquo;ve brought down two machines,
  but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does it penetrate to that desolation ye call a mind, that
  ye&rsquo;ve strafed the greatest Gairman airman, bar Richtofen?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The eyes of Billy Best lit up. &ldquo;Richtofen&mdash;he&rsquo;s the Big
  Thing, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The biggest,&rdquo; said Tam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s he to be found?&rdquo; demanded the boy.</p>

  <p>Tam removed his leather helmet and wiped his brow. &ldquo;Do ye want to go
  up noo&mdash;an&rsquo; look for him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure thing&mdash;why not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haund over that stick o&rsquo; candy ye&rsquo;re
  hidin&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; behave,&rdquo; said Tam sternly.</p>

  <p>And they went over to the office together to report, chewing
  industriously.</p>

  <h3>First published in Everybody&lsquo;s Magazine, February 1919</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE is among the children of all countries, and this has
  been true through all the ages, a certain test of courage which varies
  according to locality and according to the standard which local tradition
  demands. Blessed indeed is the boy of that town which has a suicide&rsquo;s
  tree to which shivering youth can make a midnight pilgrimage, bringing back
  proof of his valor; or great deeds can be accomplished and prowess proved
  beyond any question, if there are inaccessible cliffs which may be climbed,
  what time parents are blissfully unconscious of the narrow margin which
  separates the smoothness of their daily life from the upheaval consequent
  upon a fashionable funeral.</p>

  <p>Not so many years ago the small boys of the village demonstrated at once
  their agility and daring by making lightning dashes across the path of
  motor-cars, he who missed the mud-guard by the narrowest space being
  acclaimed a hero, and holding his position until some rival who strove to
  emulate his deed, miscalculated the distance and made that form of test
  unpopular amongst the mothers of the village.</p>

  <p>Cadet William Best was standing beside his Hepworth Kitten gazing a little
  dubiously at the sky when Tam crossed the aerodrome in his direction.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; up. Billy,&rdquo; said Tam solemnly.
  &ldquo;A thocht A&rsquo;d come and say good-by to ye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy Best, who was chewing gum with extraordinary regularity, made no
  reply. His eyes were wistfully fixed upon a streak of cloud which was passing
  all too quickly across the heavens</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re a good boy as far as ye go,&rdquo; Tam went on in his
  most sepulchural tones. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a grand poem that A&rsquo;ve got
  in ma heid for ye.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Puir Billy Best<br>
  Is noo at rest,<br>
  He&rsquo;s burnt somewhere handy.<br>
  We&rsquo;ll miss his face<br>
  Aroond the place,<br>
  But oh! we&rsquo;ll miss his candy!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Billy between bites, &ldquo;were you ever
  cheerful?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a lang way ye&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;.&rdquo; said Tam,
  ignoring the question, &ldquo;on a bit machine that has no parteecular merit
  except that ye canna be seen if ye get behint a machine-gun bullet. The air-r
  is filled&rsquo;wi&rsquo; skeelful and cunning Huns&mdash;A doot if
  A&rsquo;ll ever see ye again. Did ye leave the seegairs where I could find
  &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy jerked his head to the waiting mechanic and stepped gingerly into
  the fuselage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Before ye go,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;do ye know yer
  way?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw! Rats!&rdquo; snarled Billy Best. &ldquo;Contact!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The mechanics swung the propeller round once, twice, and then it caught
  hold with a surprisingly loud roar for so small an engine.</p>

  <p>Tam stood with a smile in his eye as the little Kitten zoomed steeply up
  from the aerodrome. He watched it circling for height, and then, a tiny speck
  in the sky, he saw it turn and make toward Mossy Face Wood. He was in his own
  machine in two seconds and was climbing as steeply after his friend before
  the speck which represented the Kitten was out of sight.</p>

  <p>Tam&rsquo;s scout was the fastest of the squadron. He might reasonably
  hope to overtake Billy before Mossy Face Wood was reached, but he made no
  such attempt, keeping well to the left and crossing the line just below
  Quéant.</p>

  <p>It was not until a quarter of an hour later that he saw Billy. Even then
  he would not have spotted him but for the fact that the air above Mossy Face
  Wood was filled with white and black shell-bursts.</p>

  <p>Tam circled round and came to the east of the wood, and, looking down, saw
  the swift Albatross squadron climbing up to engage the intrepid disturber of
  their peace, for Billy had evidently carried out his promise, had dived to
  the sacred aerodrome and had loosed his machine gun at the indignant members
  of the chasing squadron lined up ready to rise.</p>

  <p>Tam dipped for the nearest machine and sent it down out of control. Billy
  was now on the home stretch and there was nothing to be gained by waiting for
  certain trouble, for some of the Mossy Face squadron were certain to be in
  the upper regions of the air and moving in a fury to cut off the raiders.</p>

  <p>Billy reached home a few seconds ahead of his companion and came down with
  one smashed strut, divers injuries to his wings, a leaking radiator and a
  groggy elevator. Otherwise he was sublimely happy, for he had climbed the
  cliff and visited the haunted tree and crossed ahead of the motor-car. In
  other words, he had bearded the Mossy Face squadron in its lair, a feat which
  all good young airmen accomplish if they have the opportunity.</p>

  <p>His face was radiant and shining with pardonable pride when Tam came over
  to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bad luck, Billy,&rdquo; said Tam; &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t get
  there, I see!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy stared at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t get there?&rdquo; he demanded wrathfully. &ldquo;What
  do you mean? Of course I got there. I dived to within five hundred yards of
  the ground...a dozen machines came up after me...I loosed my
  gun&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did ye noo?&rdquo; said Tam incredulously. &ldquo;Noo watching the
  ficht close at hand I thocht ye were intercepted by the watchful Hun.
  &lsquo;Puir Billy,&rsquo; ses A, &lsquo;brave lad,&rsquo; ses A to
  mesel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you see me?&rdquo; demanded Billy heatedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I saw ye,&rdquo; admitted Tam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did I go down over Mossy Face Wood?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye did,&rdquo; said Tam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; said the triumphant Billy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye did,&rdquo; repeated Tam, &ldquo;and ye owe me the box of
  seegairs A bet ye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>An outrageous claim which left Billy speechless.</p>

  <p>Now the relationship between the Imperial Flying Corps of the German army
  and the flying corps of their enemies is a remarkable one. There are no
  written laws, no verbal arrangements, no discussions and agreements which
  bind other parties to any of the curious laws which have grown up in the
  course of the war and which govern both sides equally. For example, it had
  never been arranged that the flight over the aerodromes east of Mossy Face
  Wood should be regarded as a test of the quality and courage of British or
  American airmen, and no reciprocal arrangement had been reached by which the
  aerodrome of the Umpty-fourth should serve the same purpose for the recruits
  of Boelke&rsquo;s or Immelman&rsquo;s squadrons. It was
  &ldquo;understood;&rdquo; but how that understanding was reached is a
  mystery, that the post-graduate course of flying should include the difficult
  exercise represented by a trial flight from one aerodrome to the other.</p>

  <p>It was understood too, that by way of signaling his arrival at the enemy
  goal, the student should endeavor to the best of his ability to shoot or bomb
  any odd gentleman of the squadron who happened to be in billets or in the
  open below, and it was equally understood that if the aerodrome thus attacked
  succeeded in shooting or driving down the rash visitor so that he crashed to
  his death, the side which obtained this success scored one.</p>

  <p>The rivalry between Mossy Face Wood and the Umpty-fourth was a
  particularly keen one at the moment when Billy Best went out and returned in
  safety. For the scores stood:</p>

  <p class="first"
     style="margin-left:15%">Umpty-fourth, 26<br>
  Mossy Face, 12</p>

  <p class="first">and two of the latter were accounted for by defective
  engines and were not seriously included by the enemy in his calculation.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the German airman is, speaking largely, a good sportsman. All that
  is best in the German army has gravitated to the flying corps, which in the
  third year of the war was the <i>corps d&rsquo;élite</i>.</p>

  <p>So much so that it ranked in social prestige above the Grenadiers of the
  Guard who hold a terribly high position in the military hierarchy.</p>

  <p>Major Blackie duly recorded in his unofficial diary the fact that Billy
  had come and gone, and anticipating the sequel to this successful visit at a
  moment when the Mossy Face crowd were naturally feeling sore, he sent up a
  flight to patrol the area between Mossy Face and the Umpty-Fourth, and the
  precaution was justified, for at five o&rsquo;clock that evening two German
  candidates for honor came speeding through the air at twelve thousand feet
  <i>en route</i> for the Umpty-fourth, followed at a distance by interested
  veterans who came to see the fun.</p>

  <p>The first of the candidates was shot down two thousand yards west of the
  Umpty-fourth headquarters. The second reached the aerodrome and dropped a gas
  bomb, fell into a nose dive to avoid the attention of an aerial sentinel
  above and was shot down at six thousand feet by Tam who was climbing up to
  meet him.</p>

  <p>So that at the end of that day the score was:</p>

  <p class="first"
     style="margin-left:15%">Umpty-fourth, 28<br>
  Mossy Face, 12</p>

  <p>It was just about this date that Rittmeister von Haarden made his
  appearance upon the scene. In the chilly hours before the dawn, when the sky
  was smothered with stars and the world was still save for the never-ending
  thud and thunder of the guns, Tam led his flight over the lines for a
  three-hour reconnaissance. Four machines took part in the enterprise, and the
  pilots beside himself were Billy Best, Feltham and Barnstable.</p>

  <p>They crossed the line in the dark and were some hundred miles from their
  base when the first rays of the sun glittered upon the white wings of the
  four planes. They were over a world which was singularly free from the
  evidence of war, a world of green checkered fields, of meandering threads of
  rivers, of clustering hamlets, though far away to the northwest a dull smudge
  of gray smoke and mist advertised the existence of a large industrial
  town.</p>

  <p>There were no enemy machines in sight but the main roads were filled with
  transports, and Tam detected and photographed a big naval gun, admirably
  camouflaged, before a battery of Archies opened on his party and sent the
  machines rocking southward.</p>

  <p>The light was not good for photography and much of the work was simple
  note-taking. They were searching for a cavalry concentration which was
  supposed to have come into existence in this particular area, and presently
  they found it, mile upon mile of white tents and picket-lines.</p>

  <p>Since his duty was not to attack but to observe, Tam&rsquo;s survey was a
  cautious one. By this time the light had improved and the cameras were
  clicking busily.</p>

  <p>At seven o&rsquo;clock Tam fired the &ldquo;Return&rdquo; signal, and the
  four scouts turned homeward, devoting the next ten minutes to a very careful
  test of their guns&mdash;for between them and their aerodrome lay some thirty
  squadrons of expert aerial fighters.</p>

  <p>The morning, however, was clouding up and reconnoitering airplanes climbed
  until they were within reach of cover if cover were necessary. The necessity
  soon became apparent. Little white dots showing against the gray-blue of the
  horizon began to make their appearance.</p>

  <p>It was within the cover afforded by clouds that Tam made his first
  acquaintance with Rittmeister von Haarden. He was going full lick through an
  impenetrable wall of white fog when something leaped out of the cloud before
  him and passed in a flash. He had a momentary glimpse of a great Albatross,
  the wings of which missed his by a few yards and that was all.</p>

  <p>The tremendous disturbance of air caused by the machine&rsquo;s passing
  made him side-slip out of the cloud into the visible range of the
  anti-aircraft guns. He looked round and saw a machine, which he recognized as
  Billy Best&rsquo;s, rocking and diving amidst a veritable tornado of shell.
  Even as he looked the firing ceased and Tam banked over, for he knew that
  somebody was being attacked in the air and it was within the range of
  possibility that that somebody was himself. He glanced side-wise and saw the
  big Albatross dropping straight for Billy, glimpsed the stabbing pencils of
  flame from its machine gun and came round on a hairpin turn to engage the
  enemy. He and Billy were alone. The other two machines were in the cloud,
  quite unconscious of the fact that he was being attacked.</p>

  <p>But the Albatross had apparently no friends in the offing. Billy stalled
  and looped behind his assailant as Tam got one burst of fire at the enemy.
  But the man in the Albatross was no amateur. His red-and-green striped wings
  dipped in a nose dive, a red ball of fire leaped from the fuselage, and
  Archie opened almost instantly upon the two British machines.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;is where we gang hame,&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;gang hame&rdquo; he did, avoiding all further combats, dodging the
  furious barrage which was put up against him behind the lines and reaching
  the aerodrome in time for breakfast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Captain Blackie. sir,&rdquo; he reported (he consistently ignored
  the major&rsquo;s promotion), &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a new feller wi&rsquo; a
  gay Albatross painted like a sun-blind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Von Haarden,&rdquo; said Blackie; &ldquo;I heard he is on this
  sector. You had better watch that fellow. He is the best man the Germans had
  on the Russian front.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Puir lad,&rdquo; said Tam shaking his head; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s an
  awfu&rsquo; come down from Russia to Somewhere-Near-Amiens. A doot
  he&rsquo;ll miss the wee Bolchyvicks. &rsquo;Twill be a sad change after the
  glorious uncairtainties of war on the eastern front, not knowing whether
  ye&rsquo;ll be treated better if ye fall on one side of the line than if ye
  fall on the other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make no mistake, Tam,&rdquo; warned Blackie, &ldquo;this fellow is
  an ace. We shall see him over here&mdash;Boelke makes all his new men do that
  stunt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;ll be verra glad to meet him, and so will ma wee
  frien&rsquo; Billy Best,&rdquo; said Tam loyally.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How is that boy shaping?&rdquo; asked Blackie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine lad,&rdquo; said Tam soberly. &ldquo;You may
  think I&rsquo;m prejudiced because he&rsquo;s a fellow Scotsman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; asked the startled Blackie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fellow Scotsman,&rdquo; said Tam calmly. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye think
  he&rsquo;s American because he was born of American parents in America? There
  ye&rsquo;re wrong, Captain Blackie. Speeritually he&rsquo;s Scots.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blackie smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to entangle me into the
  realms of metaphysics, Tam,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I warn you and your Scots
  friend to look out for this fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Warn him,&rdquo; said Tam; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll need it. A&rsquo;m
  going to tell Billy about him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam shared a &ldquo;bunk&rdquo; with Cadet William Best, and here he found
  that young man stretched at full length on his bed, a suspicious-looking
  bulge in his mouth, his eyes glued to a paper-covered volume.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get up, ye lazy deevil,&rdquo; said Tam sternly. &ldquo;Mon. if
  ye&rsquo;d heard the things that Captain Blackie was saying about
  ye&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;About me?&rdquo; mumbled Billy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak wi&rsquo; yer mouth full,&rdquo; said Tam.
  &ldquo;Have ye no got over that disgustin&rsquo; habit of yours? Billy,
  it&rsquo;s childish for a grown man to be chewin&rsquo; goodies like a wee
  bairn. Faugh! Let&rsquo;s open the window. The place reeks wi&rsquo; the
  faint sickly fumes of mint. Have ye eaten it all?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy meekly produced a solid slab of unhealthy-looking sweetmeat and Tam
  nipped off a generous quantity before he spoke with the same difficulty which
  Billy was experiencing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no&rsquo; so good as the last lot,&rdquo; he complained;
  &ldquo;yeer parents are neglectin&rsquo; ye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What did Blackie say about me?&rdquo; demanded the youth on the
  bed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;d like to spare ye,&rdquo; said Tam, seating himself at his
  desk and extracting a report form. &ldquo;A did ma best for ye, Billy, but
  though A&rsquo;m puir A&rsquo;m honest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pure?&rdquo; asked the puzzled Billy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Impecunious,&rdquo; said Tam. &ldquo;&lsquo;What likes yon American
  boy?&rsquo; ses Captain Blackie. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s verra young but
  he&rsquo;ll lairn,&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;Are ye lookin&rsquo; after
  him?&rsquo; ses Blackie. &lsquo;A am. sair,&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;Every
  morning A make him wash his neck and clean his teeth, and look after him as
  if he was ma own child.&rsquo; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a rotten flyer, A&rsquo;m
  thinkin,&rsquo; ses Captain Blackie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say that?&rdquo; said Billy in alarm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not exactly in those words,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;but from the
  look in his eye, A kent that was what he meant. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s no&rsquo;
  so bad,&rsquo; ses I; &lsquo;Give him another chance,&rsquo; ses I;
  &lsquo;his nairves aren&rsquo;t all they might be,&rsquo; ses I. &lsquo;But
  that&rsquo;s due,&rsquo; ses I, &lsquo;to his practise of smoking
  seegairs.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do something for him, Tam,&rsquo; ses he;
  &lsquo;persuade him to give them up, Tam,&rsquo; ses he. &lsquo;take
  &rsquo;em away from him, if necessary by force,&rsquo; ses he, &lsquo;and
  keep &rsquo;em till he comes of age.&rsquo; &lsquo;A will,&rsquo; ses
  I.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says Billy Best resuming his study of
  exciting literature. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already given up smoking twice at your
  request. I thought it was bully of you to take such an interest till I found
  you smoking &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Twas all for your good,&rdquo; said Tam gently.
  &ldquo;Billy, have ye got a seegair?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy groaned and groped under the bed, produced a locked box and, with
  great ostentation, fumbled for and found a key which was suspended round his
  neck by a bootlace. With this he opened the box, took out one cigar, relocked
  the box and replaced it under his bed, Tam eying the proceedings without
  moving a muscle of his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye can&rsquo;t be too careful. Billy; there&rsquo;s thieves
  about,&rdquo; he said as he smelled the cigar and pinched it. &ldquo;Mon,
  what a surprise they&rsquo;d get if the puir bodies burgled ye and got no
  better than a five-cent seegair. This is a shorter one than usual,
  Billy,&rdquo; he said after a pause, and when his challenge had provoked no
  comment, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re robbin&rsquo; ye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are all the same size,&rdquo; said Billy thickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Open the box again and let me compare &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said
  Tam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not on yer life,&rdquo; said a voice which might literally be
  described as sweet, but which in fact sounded as though its owner were
  undergoing a process of slow strangulation. And for a few moments there was
  no sound but the scrape of Tam&rsquo;s pen and the indescribable noise of
  strong young jaws munching candy.</p>

  <p>Then Billy asked: &ldquo;What did you really say, Tam? I mean about me to
  Blackie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, weel,&rdquo; said Tam grudgingly, &ldquo;Ah said ye were
  no&rsquo; so bad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo; asked Billy eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Weel,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;he just sneefed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But honestly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mon, ye&rsquo;re a vain pup and A&rsquo;m no&rsquo; going to make
  ye conceited.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy sat up suddenly on the bed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he
  asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a Hun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam lifted his head and listened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis one of young Boelke&rsquo;s Frenchmen,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <p>He opened the door and stepped out, and looked upward between his shading
  palms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come oot o&rsquo; that, Billy.&rdquo; he shouted, and broke into a
  run to his hangar, but long before he reached it von Haarden was over the
  aerodrome.</p>

  <p>The bomb had exploded near the headquarter office and he was wheeling
  backward, fighting off the guarding patrol which had closed on him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you were too late. Tam.&rdquo; said Blackie,
  standing amidst a litter of smashed glass and shattered match-boarding which
  had once been his clerk&rsquo;s office. A mechanic was running across the
  ground carrying a little canvas bag.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said Blackie, &ldquo;dropped a message, did he? By
  the way, that was von Haarden.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A noticed it,&rdquo; said Tam grimly.</p>

  <p>Blackie took the bag and opened it, read the sheet of paper it contained
  and grinned. By this time he had an audience, for the mess-room and quarters
  had emptied rapidly at the first alarm and he was surrounded by a group of
  officers in various stages of dishabillé.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen to this!&rdquo; He read:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">To-day I come once. To-morrow or perhaps next day or some
  other time propitious I come twice and show you that it is simple for German
  airmen to come. I will make a bet of gloves to do this unofficially.
  Soldierly and fraternal greetings. von Haarden.</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;Silly ass,&rdquo; said a disgusted voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It sounds funny because his English isn&rsquo;t good.&rdquo; said
  Blackie, &ldquo;but in reality it isn&rsquo;t so funny as it looks. We will
  watch for this fellow on the &lsquo;first day propitious.&rsquo; I do not
  desire that he should make a merry hell of my office again.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p class="first">FIGHTING squadrons of the Flying Corps have something more
  to do than to devote their attention to private vendettas. The work of the
  squadron is so systematized every hour of the day, every pilot and every
  machine is so occupied with the routine of war that the squadron can no more
  than reserve a corner of its collective brain for matters which are outside
  the official orbit.</p>

  <p>Yet since the guarding of an aerodrome against hostile attacks is very
  much part of the day&rsquo;s work and, bet or no bet, Rittmeister von Haarden
  was a most formidable scout leader, Blackie detailed in the orders of the day
  two flights to patrol &ldquo;if weather reports favorable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Neither the next nor the following day did the enemy put in an appearance,
  but there was excellent reason. The weather had grown gusty, the sky was
  filled with low-lying clouds, and even the artillery planes were unable to go
  about their business.</p>

  <p>On the afternoon of the third day the wind died down and the clouds rose
  with the barometer. Billy Best went up with Tam and patroled according to
  instructions. It was part of the unwritten law that the visit must be paid in
  the daytime, and it was an hour before sunset when von Haarden came
  along.</p>

  <p>His arrival was signaled from the observation station two miles to the
  east of the aerodrome and Blackie hurried out to his telescope.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the game,&rdquo; he growled, and neither was it,
  for von Haarden was flying at something over twenty thousand feet.</p>

  <p>Blackie looked round for the barrage flights. He counted the four machines
  of McAllister&rsquo;s flight, but Tam&rsquo;s four machines were invisible.
  Then presently he found them, and emitted a yell of exuberant joy, for Tam
  was also well above twenty thousand feet and his four planes were pinpoints
  of black in the sky and almost seemed stationary.</p>

  <p>Tam was one of the few men who preferred the upper air. It was a saying of
  his that &ldquo;Ye can fa&rsquo; quicker than ye can climb.&rdquo; He was, in
  point of fact, a thousand feet higher than von Haarden in the region which
  would still be ablaze with sunshine when the sun had sunk for half an hour
  below the western skyline, a region so bitterly cold that even beneath his
  fur gloves his fingers were frozen stiff.</p>

  <p>He saw the oncoming plane and signaled &ldquo;Attack.&rdquo; Billy Best,
  who was the right of the diamond formation in which the flight was moving,
  dropped sheer to his quarry and got in a burst as von Haarden swung his
  machine to avoid the attack.</p>

  <p>Billy saw his enemy for perhaps the tenth part of a second before he fell
  behind and passed the tail of the <i>Albatross</i>. It was just a glimpse of
  a man in a fur coat, his face masked, his bent head covered with a fur and
  leather cap, his hands gripping the joy stick.</p>

  <p>Tam, who followed, did not see as much. Curious things happen to machine
  guns in the upper air. and when Tam sighted the Rittmeister his gun behaved
  accordingly. There is no time in air fighting to correct the mischief of a
  jammed gun. Before Tam could loop over and gain the height necessary for
  attack, the <i>Albatross</i> had fulfilled its mission, was crossing the
  aerodrome amidst a pandemonium of Archie fire and was heading due west.</p>

  <p>Tam followed in pursuit, but he had lost too much height to reach his
  enemy&rsquo;s level and after a twenty-mile run, during which he succeeded in
  getting his gun working, he returned to the aerodrome.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hard lines, Tam,&rdquo; said Blackie; &ldquo;go over and cheer your
  young Scottish friend. He&rsquo;s disconsolate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy indeed was grieved, almost to the point of tears.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I used to think I could shoot,&rdquo; he said miserably:
  &ldquo;missed him at less than fifty yards. I was your young Nimrod all
  right: missed him, Tam, at fifty yards, by gosh!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah weel,&rdquo; said Tam philosophically, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis nothing
  to greet aboot. Maybe ye scairt him. What did ye come down for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Search me!&rdquo; said the wretched Billy. &ldquo;I just felt
  lonely and homesick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; said the stern Tam. &ldquo;Up wi&rsquo; ye, ye
  whining little deevil. Is it no&rsquo; twice the laddie is
  coming.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p class="first">TAM took another machine, tested the gun and rose with Billy
  to join the flight. He had reached the high level when a Lucas lamp flickered
  from the aerodrome.</p>

  <p>Tam read the message: &ldquo;Von Haarden coming back. Get him this
  time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For ten minutes Tam searched the heavens in vain and presently he saw the
  big Albatross. It was flying much lower and again was heading straight for
  the aerodrome. Tam shot off three rounds from his gun and then thought of
  Billy.</p>

  <p>Billy should have his chance. He signaled &ldquo;Nearest attack,&rdquo;
  and Billy swept down the six thousand feet which separated him from his
  enemy. Tam watched the planes growing nearer and nearer, saw Billy turn on a
  parallel course with the <i>Albatross</i>.</p>

  <p>The boy might make sure but it was a terribly dangerous position to take.
  Closer and closer the planes approached one another. Billy would be waiting
  for von Haarden to show himself, and Tam watched as he dropped in a wide
  circle toward the two machines. And then an amazing thing happened. The
  <i>Albatross</i> and Billy&rsquo;s scout were running almost side by side,
  and less than fifty yards separated them and nothing happened.</p>

  <p>As Tam looked, he saw Billy bank over and turn, leaving the
  <i>Albatross</i> to pursue its course over the aerodrome. Almost immediately
  Blackie signaled &ldquo;Flight return.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When Tam reached the ground Billy was standing before Blackie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Best,&rdquo; said Blackie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid von
  Haarden&rsquo;s won his bet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Billy simply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did your gun jam?&rdquo; asked Blackie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did ye no&rsquo; fire?&rdquo; Tam interrupted anxiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Billy. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t fire and my gun
  didn&rsquo;t jam.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, what happened then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it, sir,&rdquo; said Billy, and his face
  was white. &ldquo;It was awful. It can&rsquo;t possibly have happened. I saw
  von Haarden as plainly as I see you &mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo; asked Blackie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was dead, sir. He had been dead an hour,&rdquo; said Billy.</p>

  <p>An hour later a German <i>Albatross</i> crashed within a hundred yards of
  the aerodrome. It crashed because its petrol had run out. For two hours it
  had been moving in a wide circle that carried it from Mossy Face Wood to the
  aerodrome across the back areas, round to the wood again and again back to
  the aerodrome. It had been moving steadily, unswervingly, just so long as its
  petrol lasted, with a dead man&rsquo;s stiff hand at its control&mdash;for
  Billy had killed him with his first shot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a verra moot point,&rdquo; said Tam to Billy that night
  as he sat on the edge of his bed smoking a cigar luxuriously, &ldquo;whether
  that puir body, Mad Haarden, won his bet. Speakin&rsquo; theologically I
  think he did. and A&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; over Mossy Face Wood tomorrow to drop
  a pair of yeer gloves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why my gloves?&rdquo; demanded Billy truculently.</p>

  <h3>First published in Everybody&lsquo;s Magazine, April 1919</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE is a loneliness more poignant than that
  &ldquo;loneliness of wings&rdquo; of which Leonardo wrote; there is the
  loneliness of anonymity. To be one of twenty thousand men or more, roughly
  classified heroic by an admiring but misunderstanding public, is to endure
  the same crushing sense of obliteration which comes to all men in a
  crowd.</p>

  <p>Billy Best realized fully enough that he was a member of a great and
  wonderful brotherhood. It was a brotherhood which included in its membership
  even those men who daily sought his destruction in the air and whom he
  variously described, according to his mood, as Fritz, Heinie, Boche, Hun,
  Jerry, or &ldquo;them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For Billy had adopted the nomenclature of both armies, French and British.
  There had been a time when he had thought that it was low down that terms of
  contempt should be employed against German fighting men who were undoubtedly
  brave, who were certainly patriotic and who, whatever might be the justice of
  their cause, were entitled to respect.</p>

  <p>But he had learned in the great school of war that such phrases were not
  contemptuous, but were rather labels applied by high-spirited young men to a
  foe whose valor they respected but of whose inferiority to themselves they
  were perfectly convinced.</p>

  <p>Billy lived among men whose names, if they did not reach the
  newspaper-press&mdash;for the British government was a little too
  conservative on the publicity side of the war&mdash;were familiarly spoken of
  in every mess-room he visited. He learned of the little feuds between
  particular French and British squadrons and particular German squadrons. He
  knew why von Heuben went regularly to a certain aerodrome behind Rheims
  looking for Villiers, the French ace, and why Villiers avoided meeting the
  man who was his half-brother.</p>

  <p>He knew why the Captain Baron von Kohn was killed by Seveni, the Italian
  airman in circumstances so remarkable that one hesitates to record them,
  since the two men had fought a duel behind a German aerodrome under the eyes
  of a princely army commander. And von Kohn&rsquo;s offense had been so great
  in the eyes of honorable men that Seveni, after killing his man, was allowed
  to go back to his machine which stood in the center of the German ground and
  retire unmolested.</p>

  <p>He knew of &ldquo;Eighteen&rdquo; Spanton, so called because on his
  eighteenth birthday, which was the eighteenth of the month, he shot down his
  eighteenth enemy plane and died that night in number eighteen general
  hospital. He knew of the men in the German service that both the French and
  British knew, of Boelke, Immelmann, and the two Richthofens and their kind,
  and he knew also that in the German messes there were French and British
  fighters who were discussed at every table.</p>

  <p>Had not Tam been challenged by three or four of the most famous of
  fighters? Had not Blackie been signaled out by Bissing&rsquo;s circus in the
  old days?</p>

  <p>All these men knew one another though they had never met. Their methods,
  their character, their systems of fighting were discussed and criticized in
  very much the same way as the form of a race-horse or of a team player is
  discussed by the votaries of sport. And he was of the crowd, one of the
  unmentioned, and it depressed him, not because he was a lover of the spot-
  light, not because he was looking forward to seeing his name figure in the
  world&rsquo;s press, but rather from a mistaken sense of his
  unworthiness.</p>

  <p>He was piqued with the feeling that he did not count. With youth happily
  such moments of depression are of brief duration, but while they last there
  is no denying that they are fairly intensive.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye ought to be ashamed of yersel&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Tam severely.
  &ldquo;A&rsquo;m surprised at ye, Billy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up,&rdquo; said Billy, a sad figure in shirt-sleeves
  sitting in the one chair of which Tam&rsquo;s modest apartment boasted, his
  elbows on his knees, his face in his hands. &ldquo;I just feel out of it;
  I&rsquo;ll never make a scout.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will ye be quiet,&rdquo; said Tam; &ldquo;have ye no candy to put
  in yeer face, and after me teachin&rsquo; ye the art and science of
  scootin&rsquo;? Have ye no sense of decency or will ye be an American to the
  end of yeer days?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with America,&rdquo; said
  Billy, reviving sufficiently to defend his native land against the aspersions
  of a foreigner. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me that&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What would ye like?&rdquo; demanded Tam, sitting on the edge of the
  table and eying the other with disfavor. &ldquo;Would ye like me to put a wee
  bit in the <i>Glasgow Herald</i>, or maybe ye&rsquo;d like to see yeer
  portrait in the police news?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forget all that,&rdquo; said Billy rudely; &ldquo;you know that
  doesn&rsquo;t cut any ice with me. I&rsquo;m just no good. Do you know what
  happened to-day?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;m waitin&rsquo; to learn.&rdquo; said Tam; &ldquo;all this
  afternoon A&rsquo;ve been sitting by patiently and, if A may use the word,
  modestly, waitin&rsquo; for yeer confession. Ye&rsquo;ve done something,
  Billy. A can see it in yeer fairtive glances. Yeer color comes and goes. Yeer
  hands shake like a brigade movie. Yeer breath is labored. Ye wear a hunted
  and a haunted look. Tell me the worst, laddie. Have yeer parents no&rsquo;
  sent the candy they promised ye?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy snarled something rude.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oot wi&rsquo; it,&rdquo; said Tam.</p>

  <p>The boy rose to his feet and thrust his hands deep into the pockets of his
  slacks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tam,&rdquo; he said and then there was a long silence which Tam did
  not break. &ldquo;I just hate to tell you;&rdquo; then quickly, &ldquo;Did
  you hear anything to-day&mdash;about me, I mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A haird ye were pursood by Mr. Mac Bissing and his world-renowned
  caircus!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Billy and his face was long and
  glum. &ldquo;Tam&mdash;gee! I was scared sick! It came over me all in a
  moment. My mouth went dry and my hands shook and all my bones seemed to turn
  to water. What do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A bright and kindly light dawned in Tam&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;A&rsquo;m
  glad ye told me,&rdquo; he said quickly, &ldquo;and A&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s
  ower.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Over? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam slid down to the floor and laid his hand on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder.
  &ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;d&rsquo;ye think, that A&rsquo;ve
  no&rsquo; had that feelin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You? Why, of course you haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mon, I had it to-day,&rdquo; said Tam. &ldquo;A have it regularly
  twice a week. A never see a Hun maneuvering for ma tail withoot A don&rsquo;t
  wish A were home suppin&rsquo; tea wi&rsquo; ma Aunt Elizabeth. I have no
  Aunt Elizabeth, but A often, wish A had. If ye went to Blackie and told him,
  he would tell ye the same. If ye had a heart-to-heart talk with Richthofen,
  he would tell ye the same. If ye went down to the Frenchies&rsquo; aerodrome
  and talked it over with the aces, they would all tell ye the same.
  They&rsquo;re scared to death. If it wasn&rsquo;t for that, air fighting
  would be wilful murder. As it is, it is just justifiable homicide in
  self-defense.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But do you mean,&rdquo; demanded Billy, &ldquo;that feeling like
  that I am fit for scouting&mdash;that I&rsquo;ll have those sensations
  again?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If ye&rsquo;re normal ye will,&rdquo; said Tam; &ldquo;if
  ye&rsquo;re mad ye won&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a sign ye&rsquo;re healthy, Billy.
  It relieves ma mind. A was afraid ye were smoking too much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you really mean that?&rdquo; said Billy brightening up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A mean it,&rdquo; said Tam, and his sincerity carried
  conviction.</p>

  <p>Billy remembered this conversation the next morning when forming one of
  the escort to a bombing squadron which was making its way toward a much too
  active railway junction, he found himself engaged with that very circus which
  had occasioned him so much misgiving.</p>

  <p>It cheered him to feel that his sensations had their counterpart in the
  bosom of an invisible German pilot who at that moment was firing at him
  through his propeller, and when he maneuvered to his enemy&rsquo;s tail and,
  following him down in a nose dive, saw the German machine crash and burst
  into flames, he experienced the righteous sense of satisfaction which comes
  to the respectable householder who has got the first shot at an armed
  burglar.</p>

  <p>What Tam had not told Billy was that no airman succeeds until he has
  evolved a system of his own and developed characteristics which remove him
  from the general run of good workmen and place him in a class by himself.
  Such things are not to be told to the young lest they form &ldquo;ground
  theories,&rdquo; for systems of fighting are born in a flash in moments of
  deadly crises. They can not be worked out by rote nor puzzled out in leisure
  moments.</p>

  <p>The versification of air fighting may be mechanically mastered, its poetry
  defies research and comes in that second of inspiration when the soul of the
  man who acquires the knowledge is trembling on the brink of eternity.</p>

  <p>Billy did things according to the book. He knew all the tricks that
  skilled masters could teach him, did as well, in fact, as any other good man
  who had a hand light enough to manipulate the controls of a fast and
  sensitive scout. He knew when to sideslip, when to loop, when to fall into a
  tail dive. He knew how to dodge shrapnel and when it need not be dodged. He
  understood the mechanical side of reconnaissance. In fact, he was, as so many
  other men have been, a credit to the masters who had pumped into his
  receptive mind the a-b-c of his work.</p>

  <p>It was all to his advantage that he was consumed with that divine
  discontent which is the very hallmark of genius and that he could detect
  between his own methods and those of his compeers a difference so subtle as
  to evade him.</p>

  <p>The men of the Flying Corps have no secrets from one another. Their
  systems are individual and, giving their frankness its lowest value, there is
  nothing to be gained by preserving a reticence about a method which, since no
  two men think and act alike, is inimitable.</p>

  <p>Bradbury, the American ace, came over to the Umpty-fourth and to him as a
  compatriot Billy opened his heart. Bradbury listened without smiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to it,&rdquo; he said when Billy had
  finished; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just adapting the know-how in a novel way that
  makes the star airman, I guess&mdash;it will come to you. After you&rsquo;ve
  crashed about a dozen Germans you&rsquo;ll find the way you can crash
  &rsquo;em best and then you&rsquo;ll be a specialist.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said Billy without enthusiasm.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THERE was little opportunity for specialism during the
  ensuing days and nights. Early morning reconnaissance work, escort duty to
  bombing squadrons, patrol guard over the artillery planes, these and other
  duties of a similar kind offer little scope for the display of
  initiative.</p>

  <p>Billy had a fight or two with &ldquo;sausage killers,&rdquo; those
  venomous wasps who shoot their fiery sting at the helpless and obese
  observation balloons. He interfered with the comfort of a too venturesome
  enemy patrol. He enjoyed a little fight on his own over the Lille aerodrome
  (his enemy was obviously a novice and dived for safety after the first burst
  of fire) and he experienced the discomforts attendant upon a crash of his
  own.</p>

  <p>Then one day his opportunity came. He was one of a flight told off to
  escort a special train running from Calais to Paris conveying some important
  members of the British Government to an inter-allied conference. His flight
  had to cover eighty miles of the journey where the escort duty was taken up
  by another flight. Nothing untoward occurred and the train was formally
  handed over to the new escort and the flight had turned northward on its
  homeward journey when far away to the right and flying at a considerable
  elevation Billy saw a solitary airplane which from its shape he judged was
  German. Tam&rsquo;s sharp eyes had seen the machine and he had no doubt. He
  signaled Billy to investigate and Billy swung off eastward. It was
  indubitably an enemy plane. What was its mission, why it was so far behind
  the lines or how it had evaded the patrols, Billy did not trouble to
  think.</p>

  <p>At any rate, the enemy machine was not evading Billy and it came round and
  began a swift glide in his direction. It was an Albatross scout, obviously a
  two-gun machine, and Billy maneuvered to avoid unpleasantness, recognizing
  with dismay the certain symptoms of approaching panic. Despite the
  encouraging talk he had had with Tam those symptoms developed alarmingly.</p>

  <p>He felt his breath coming in short gasps. He had a curious sensation in
  the pit of his stomach. He felt himself breaking into a perspiration and
  cursed.</p>

  <p>The hand at the gun was steady enough. He would have only the fraction of
  a second to meet and counter the attack. He was horribly lonely and then
  suddenly his fear turned to an almost insane anger. Why should this man wish
  to destroy him? What had he done to deserve&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Zip! Zip! Zip!</i></p>

  <p>He felt the bullets whistle past him and saw a great rent in the canvas of
  his wings. A strut snapped and a wire hung loose. All this he saw before the
  attacking Albatross flashed by.</p>

  <p>Billy banked over in a cold rage and dived straight for the machine. He
  had no other desire but to ram his enemy.</p>

  <p>In the second of time between taking his decision and swooping down to
  carry it into effect he felt a wild exaltation at the thought of the smash
  which was coming when the full weight of his heavy scout traveling at one
  hundred and twenty miles an hour struck home. He had bloody murder in his
  heart, and only by a miracle did the Albatross escape. Down went the nose of
  the German, Billy on his tail. By this time something of the old training had
  asserted itself. He reached for his gun and emptied a tray of ammunition at
  the falling machine. Something jumped out of the wing, something that looked
  like a stick with a piece of rag attached. Billy fired again and this time
  with deadly effect. The machine was wrapped in a pall of smoke, pierced by
  long streamers of flame.</p><br>

  <p class="first">CADET WILLIAM BEST returned to the aerodrome of the
  Umpty-fourth in a condition bordering upon the ecstatic. He strutted over to
  Tam and clapped him on the shoulder with gross familiarity.
  &ldquo;Son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam looked up guiltily. &ldquo;A&rsquo;ve found it mesel&rsquo;,&rdquo; he
  said; &ldquo;&rsquo;twas under yeer pillow. Mon, those seegairs of yours are
  no&rsquo; what they&rsquo;re cracked up to be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean the key of my box, you pirate,&rdquo; chortled
  Billy; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found my <i>métier</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh aye,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll be a bonny lass, but
  ye&rsquo;re ower young to think o&rsquo; marryin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Métier</i>!&rdquo; roared Billy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Terror of
  the Skies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll have to fight me for that championship,&rdquo; said
  Tam. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the sky been doin&rsquo; to ye?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am the rammer,&rdquo; said Billy, biting off the end of a large
  cigar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Open the window,&rdquo; begged Tam; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the sun,
  Billy. Ye&rsquo;ll feel all right in a minute. What have ye been
  ramming?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Not briefly did Billy relate his story. He told it in detail. He gave
  sectional views of his emotions. He described how he felt and why he felt
  it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Condensin&rsquo; yeer serial story,&rdquo; said Tam after a very
  patient hearing, &ldquo;into a few pithy paragraphs, A gather ye made an
  attempt to damage government property and commit suicide and that the heat of
  yeer language and the fire in yeer eye set a light to puir wee Fritzie. Have
  ye any other statement to make before A report the disgusting caircumstances
  to yeer superior officer?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But wasn&rsquo;t it fine, Tam?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;m no&rsquo; so sure,&rdquo; said the cautious Tam,
  &ldquo;and at the same time A&rsquo;m no&rsquo; so sure it wasn&rsquo;t. If
  yeer daring exploit was witnessed by the other Fritzies ye&rsquo;ll have a
  reputation for insanity which ought to make yeer fortune.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p class="first">BILLY&rsquo;s reputation came in a night, was consolidated
  in a week. His system was a simple one. It was no more and no less than a
  series of desperate attempts on his part to collide with enemy airplanes. Had
  he succeeded he would not have survived his success. The story of how he fell
  spread-eagle upon the great von Bissing and of how that gentleman, one of the
  most skilful ot fighters, did not look back until he reached his aerodrome;
  the story of his head-on dive at Major von Hoffer; the story of his gallant
  attempt to ram von Richthofen himself, have been told so often and have been
  exaggerated and embellished so frequently that it is not necessary to
  describe all the particulars of those remarkable combats.</p>

  <p>At the end of the second week German airmen prisoners brought the news
  that several expert fighters were looking for the &ldquo;mad dog&rdquo; and
  Billy was in the seventh heaven of delight. Nobody checked him, because that
  is not the way of the air service. Nobody warned him or counseled moderation.
  Battles are not won by paying heed to such counsel. They gave him the best
  and the fastest machine they could find and they said good-by to him every
  time he went out, without any great hope that he would be back to lunch.</p>

  <p>Tam, whose methods had more finesse, watched his jubilant subordinate and
  on one occasion, at least, relieved Billy of responsibility by driving down
  the machine which the boy was maneuvering to crash.</p>

  <p>The moral effect upon the enemy was great. Even the skilled fighters gave
  him a wide berth. Elkstein, who was shot down behind the British lines,
  explained this reluctance to face the bull-rush dive of the
  &ldquo;Rammer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is good to be killed by fair shooting, also by clever
  maneuverment, but it is like to be knocked down in the street by a beer wagon
  for a gallant soldier to outgo from life in such brutal
  circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Billy reigned supreme, the joy of a hundred tiny mess-rooms up and
  down the line, until the day that Lieutenant Heinrich Mickelbaum went up in
  an old-type Taube escorted by a fighting squadron of German scouts and sought
  the Rammer in that sky area where he loved to roam.</p>

  <p>The Intelligence Department of the Royal Flying Corps is singularly
  efficient. It works in conjunction with other Intelligence Departments and
  the news it secures is both curious and accurate.</p>

  <p>On the morning when Lieutenant Heinrich Mickelbaum and his escort rose,
  Tam. who had been on an early morning flight, came into the room where Billy
  was shaving.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;A want to see ye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Feast yer eyes,&rdquo; said Billy arrogantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not so fillin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Tam; &ldquo;mon. will
  ye never lairn that it is ridiculous to put a reaper over asphalt? A had a
  dream aboot ye last night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say?&rdquo; said Billy politely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A dreamt A was making up a bit of poetry about ye, Billy, and was
  writing a letter to yeer misguided parents. &lsquo;Dear father and mother of
  Billy Best,&rsquo; writes I, &lsquo;yeer puir foolish son is no more. We
  shall miss him, but the Hun did not, so no more at present. From his
  late&mdash;but never too late to learn&mdash;friend. Tam.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Billy, fingering his chin with satisfaction.</p>

  <p><a id="picNNN"
     name="picNNN"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1305041h-images/TFS-16.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>&ldquo;The point of ma story is to come.&rdquo; said Tam. &ldquo;Billy,
  the authorities are worried about ye and they have got a graund stunt for ye.
  A&rsquo;ve come to bring the news.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy looked round anxiously. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Tam?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let other lips tell ye,&rdquo; said Tam. shaking his head; &ldquo;A
  hate to bring ye the sad news, but they&rsquo;re trying to save yeer life It
  seems unnecessary, but ye must humor the foolish people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the joke?&rdquo; demanded Billy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whether &rsquo;twas a telegram from President Wilson or Doctor
  Wilson, as the case may be, or whether they want ye for the movies noo that
  Charlie Chapiin&rsquo;s joining up, or whether the Gairman Emperor has
  threatened reprisals, A don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="first">THE mystery was cleared up when Billy put in his appearance
  at the orderly room and was introduced to a quiet-looking gentleman in the
  uniform of a staff-major who proved to be Sir George Cannel, the aeronautical
  expert.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Best, sir,&rdquo; said Major Blackie.</p>

  <p>The staff-officer nodded. &ldquo;We have reason to believe that the Hun is
  going to get you, Mr. Best.&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and as we are anxious not
  to lose you, we thought that we would like to make a sporting experiment
  which might or might not save your life and which might or might not prove
  that certain of our theories are right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Billy, groping for light.</p>

  <p>The officer took up a fairly large bundle which lay across Blackie&rsquo;s
  desk. It looked like a tightly rolled blanket, though the material was of a
  much finer texture. Protruding from one end of the bundle were a number of
  straps.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is the Cannel parachute.&rdquo; he smiled; &ldquo;it is, in
  fact, my own invention. We have had one or two experiments from airplanes,
  but they have not been wholly successful and we have never tried them out in
  fighting airplanes. Your peculiar method of fighting, however, enables us to
  &mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make the experiment on my foul body,&rdquo; smiled Billy;
  &ldquo;yes, sir, I would be very pleased.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would not guarantee,&rdquo; said the staff-officer, &ldquo;that
  this is going to save your life, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter
  much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at all, sir,&rdquo; said Billy cheerfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; laughed the major; &ldquo;what I mean is
  that if you collide in midair without this, you are certainly killed. With
  this you have a fifty to fifty chance of escaping.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy hesitated. &ldquo;Is that exactly fair to the other man, sir?&rdquo;
  he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The German?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t worry very much about him,&rdquo; said the
  officer dryly; &ldquo;it is by no means a certainty that you will escape. The
  odds are two to one that the parachute will get entangled in the fuselage. It
  is not like a clean drop from a balloon. It is an even chance that you will
  be insensible when the crash comes and be unable to operate. In fact, the,
  chances are all against you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;em then,&rdquo; said Billy promptly.</p>

  <p>The necessary instructions did not take very long. The working of the
  parachute was simplicity itself, always providing he could jump clear of the
  falling machine. If it turned turtle or fell sideways the chances of saving
  his life were remote.</p>

  <p>Billy, strapped and belted, with the parachute lightly fastened to the
  nacelle behind him and the release string within his reach, went up in search
  of adventure with less pleasure than he usually experienced when he set
  forth. Adventure he soon found and that immediately behind the German line.
  Six enemy machines, five of the newest pattern and one which was strange to
  him and which was obviously slower than the rest, came into sight and then,
  as if on some signal, four of the six retired, leaving a slow monoplane to
  meet the Rammer.</p>

  <p>Billy maneuvered for height and reached his enemy&rsquo;s level. He did
  not doubt that the usual thing would happen, that before his devastating rush
  his enemy would drop in flight, exposing himself to the pursuer&rsquo;s
  gun.</p>

  <p>Something within him made him hesitate to attack. It wasn&rsquo;t fair.
  The chances were not equal. If he were sure that the parachute would not act,
  he would have gone joyously to the fight; but there was an outside risk of
  safety. His opponent settled all misgivings by suddenly turning and heading
  his way. In a moment Billy forgot his scruples. Straight at the Taube he
  went, all out, his engines roaring like a mill. Nearer and nearer&mdash;then
  Billy realized with a gasp and a return of the old panic feeling that the
  machine would not avoid him. This, then, was Billy&rsquo;s last fight. He
  recognized its inevitability, saw the end and with a quick jerk of his hand
  released the safety-catch of the parachute.</p>

  <p>The machines collided at an angle. Billy leaped up into the air and was
  jerked back by the weight of the parachute. He was horribly shocked and
  jarred. He did not know what had happened to the machines save that they had
  collided. He smelled something burning, was flung upward again and was again
  pulled back and felt himself falling, falling at a terrifying rate through
  the air.</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes. &ldquo;He did not pray nor experience the slightest
  tinge of fear. He was just curious and found himself wondering why there was
  such pressure under his arms. He opened his eyes and looked up. Above his
  head was spread a big circular umbrella shape. The parachute had acted.</p>

  <p>He almost fainted for the first time in his life as he realized the fact.
  He looked down. He saw the two machines whirling downward in smoke and flame,
  tumbling (slowly as it seemed) to earth and again felt that twinge of remorse
  that he had experienced before the fight had started.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor devil,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t
  fair.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Somebody was talking, yelling is a better word, cursing would be a truer
  description. With an effort he turned round. Not fifty yards away and level
  with him was another parachute and suspended therefrom a red-faced German
  officer who alternately cursed him in English and German.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pig! <i>Schweinehund</i>!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;You have no
  bravery. Ha! You have parachute. You can not take risk. You always have
  parachute, you brave fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar!&rdquo; veiled Billy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pig!&rdquo; said the German.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When I get down I&rsquo;ll break your head!&rdquo; shouted
  Billy.</p>

  <p>The parachutes were drifting nearer together. Conversation was almost
  impossible unless the men raised their voices.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are so bold a fellow that you can not come up to fight mit
  German gentleman mitout a parachute, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen, you poor boob,&rdquo; yelled Billy; &ldquo;what do you
  think you are hanging on to, a damned Christmas-tree?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They were still quarreling violently when they descended gently into a
  field behind the British support line. They were quarreling when delighted
  Tommies released them from their straps and from the staff car that carried
  them both back to headquarters. The sound of their recriminations came to the
  admiring soldiery long after they had passed out of sight round the bend of
  the road.</p>

  <h3>First published in Everybody&lsquo;s Magazine, November 1918</h3>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;ARE you going through Bézierville, Tam?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye an&rsquo; no,&rdquo; replied Tam cautiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What in thunder do you mean?&rdquo; asked Major Blackie irritably.
  &ldquo;Either you&rsquo;re going or not going!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Tam. &ldquo;A&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to
  Bézierville to buy a few cheap seegairs, &rsquo;tis Mr. Baxter&rsquo;s
  bairthday to-morrow an&rsquo; A thocht A&rsquo;d gi&rsquo;e him a surprise,
  the puir body. A&rsquo;m no&rsquo; goin&rsquo; <i>through</i>
  Bézierville&mdash;but intae Bézierville.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blackie laughed and picked up a heavy leather case from his desk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a long-winded beggar,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Drop
  these at Advance Survey&mdash;they&rsquo;re photographic plates which young
  Oathwaite exposed on his last reconnaissance. Get a receipt from the
  photographic gentleman&mdash;be careful as to this; photographs have been
  going astray lately and G.H.Q. has been kicking up the devil of a
  shine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam took the leathern wallet, received the printed receipt-form and passed
  out to the motor-cycle and side-car. He tucked the plates carefully away in
  the bottom of the little carriage and pushed off.</p>

  <p>Bézierville (this is not the real name of the town) lies twenty-three
  miles due southwest of the Umpty-fourth&rsquo;s aerodrome, and as the Advance
  Survey Office lies half a mile west of the town, the journey certainly
  involved a change in Tam&rsquo;s original plan, since it was necessary to
  pass through the narrow streets of the town and emerge through the mossy
  bastions of what had once been Bézierville&rsquo;s western gate. He entered
  the gaunt dwelling-house where the Survey had its headquarters and found the
  slim, spectacled chief of the development department.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Umpty-fourth Squadron&mdash;Wytschaete
  Sector&mdash;h&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said the young man, reading the label.
  &ldquo;Why are they photographing that part of the line?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam liked or disliked people very quickly. He instantly decided that he
  disliked this young man very much indeed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; for me to tell ye,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
  mebbe it&rsquo;s grawin&rsquo; auld; or grawin&rsquo; whiskers; or mebbe the
  Commander-in-Chief wants to frame it an&rsquo; hang it o&rsquo;er his
  bed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The young man looked at him sharply. He was a civilian and apparently
  recognized no urgent reason why he should be polite to a junior
  lieutenant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a humorist.&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam shook his head. &ldquo;Not so ye&rsquo;d notice it,&rdquo; he said,
  and added as an afterthought, &ldquo;Mister Lavinski.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The young man went red. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said loudly,
  &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t get fresh with me because you&rsquo;re an officer,
  you know. My name isn&rsquo;t Lavinski&mdash;see? I&rsquo;m not here to be
  insulted, and I shall report you to the G. O. C.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, aye,&rdquo; said Tam with approval, &ldquo;mention ma name to
  him&mdash;&rsquo;tis one he&rsquo;ll remember.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no wish to hold any further conversation with
  you,&rdquo; said the photographer loftily and turned away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here! Come back, ma impetuous laddie, an&rsquo; gi&rsquo;e me
  ye&rsquo;r autograph on this bit receipt. It will sairve as a
  souveneer,&rdquo; he said as the other hastily scrawled his signature.</p>

  <p>Tam blotted and folded the receipt and moved leisurely from the office. He
  was mounting his bicycle when the young man appeared at the doorway and,
  after a few seconds hesitation, came down to the scout.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me if I got a bit heated up,&rdquo; he said;
  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very worrying work. My name&rsquo;s Yeldstein&mdash;Dutch,
  but lived all my life in dear old Blighty. Grand country, England.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So A&rsquo;ve heard.&rdquo; said Tam gravely; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis the
  wild land sooth of Glasgae, A&rsquo;m told, but I have never explored
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you are Scotch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Scots,&rdquo; corrected Tam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A grand country, Scotland,&rdquo; said Mr. Yeldstein. &ldquo;Maybe
  you know my two cousins. They&rsquo;ve got a store in Perth&mdash;MacPherson
  Brothers. Ike&rsquo;s a good chap, so&rsquo;s Abe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A never mix with the hieland nobility,&rdquo; said Tam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Mr. What&rsquo;s-yer-name,&rdquo; Mr. Yeldstein went on.
  &ldquo;I hope we are not going to be bad friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use hopin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Tam solemnly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Any time you&rsquo;re around this way, look me up. I&rsquo;ve got
  quarters here,&rdquo; he pointed to a large barn-like building behind the
  house, &ldquo;you will always find a drop of the real wine of
  Scotland&mdash;you know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Tam, wilfully dense, &ldquo;ginger ale.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He would have made a dignified retirement, but his front tire just at that
  moment decided to go &ldquo;phut!&rdquo; and Mr. Yeldstein became the soul of
  hospitality, summoning slaves from dark rooms and workshops to repair the
  damage, and carrying the unwilling Tam to his quarters.</p>

  <p>The place had originally been a storehouse, but its new owner&rsquo;s
  native genius had transformed it into a very comfortable living-room. The
  dark young man produced whisky and large and opulent-looking cigars with
  imposing gold bands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just make yourself comfortable,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;while I run
  over to the office and tell my people where I am. We are getting photographs
  every hour of the day and night.&rdquo; He called back from the doorway,
  &ldquo;You will find the soda in that second cupboard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam was not very keen on drinking, but he had his ideas as to what was and
  what was not polite. There were two doors, but the first did not reveal
  either a cupboard or a wine-store. It was, in fact, the entrance to a small
  room innocent of anything more refreshing than might be contained in six
  large steel cylinders.</p>

  <p>Tam was peering into the interior in his quest for soda siphons when Mr.
  Yeldstein returned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, not there!&rdquo; said the photographer hastily; &ldquo;the
  next!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shut the door hurriedly, slipped a key from his pocket and locked it,
  and Tam noticed that his face was very red.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some photographic stuff. I thought the da&mdash;I thought the bally
  room was locked.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam found the soda, refreshed himself and took farewell of his voluble
  host, who, from the moment of his return to the room to the moment he shook
  hands with unnecessary heartiness, did not stop speaking.</p>

  <p>Tam mentioned the matter casually to Blackie the next day.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is a pretty useful photographer, I believe, and was in a good
  way of business in the north of England when he was called up,&rdquo; said
  Blackie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;m no&rsquo; so sure that A like him,&rdquo; said Tam;
  &ldquo;ye were tellin&rsquo; me, Major Blackie, sir, that photographs of the
  lines have been going astray.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blackie nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have found several very confidential maps in the German lines
  when we raided them,&rdquo; said Blackie; &ldquo;there has been an awful row
  about it, but obviously they must have come through some neutral
  country.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s verra likely,&rdquo; said Tam; &ldquo;then again
  it&rsquo;s verra unlikely.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blackie groaned. &ldquo;I can see you joining the Intelligence
  Department,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>A week later Tam took a flight to escort a dozen bombing machines on a
  night raid.</p>

  <p>It was one of those commonplace affairs which ordinarily receive a line
  such as, &ldquo;<i>bombs were dropped on enemy dumps.</i>&rdquo; in the
  official communiqué, and the escort had a simple and uneventful time, turning
  in the direction of their headquarters soon after midnight. In order to
  facilitate their return, the raiders followed the course of a little river
  which carried them west and south of their homes, turning north again when
  the lights of Bézierville showed on their right. This brought the raiders
  immediately over Bézierville, to which they had signaled their innocent
  character in order that the civilians of that town should endure no agony of
  mind.</p>

  <p>Tam, leading the squadron, had crossed the dull silver thread which marked
  the river south of the town, when something big and soft struck the nose of
  his machine, was jerked violently backward by the tractor, and hit the little
  pilot full in the face.</p>

  <p><a id="picNNN"

  </div><br>

  <p>He flung out his hand and pushed the thing away and it disappeared,
  leaving on his knees a thin cotton bag some ten inches square and torn at the
  neck, as he subsequently discovered.</p>

  <p>The occurrence was alarming, though from first to last it had occupied
  less than a second of time. Tam turned in his seat and flashed from his Lucas
  lamp an anxious inquiry to the following squadron. Sixteen lamps winked O. K.
  and Tam went on, mystified.</p>

  <p>Blackie chuckled when Tam recounted the mysterious appearance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were quite unconsciously sailing under an enemy
  squadron,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They were reported in the region of
  Bézierville at ten o&rsquo;clock. Probably one of the pilots dropped
  something overboard. You ought to be thankful it wasn&rsquo;t anything
  worse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Tom, relieved, &ldquo;is that a&rsquo;? They bombed
  Bézierville A&rsquo;ve nae doot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Blackie. &ldquo;They did not drop anything on that
  little dorp, so far as I can find out. As a matter of fact, they are rather
  keen on Bézierville, though what they expect to find there, Heaven knows.
  There is always a Hun scout or two in that region, but they usually choose
  daybreak for their reconnaissance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam scratched his chin. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s verra strange,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <p>This was in the early hours of Tuesday morning. An hour before dawn on the
  Wednesday, Tam left the aerodrome, flying his tiny Hepworth Kitten and headed
  straight for Bézierville. He awaited the dawn and beyond the dawn and saw
  nothing. The next morning he repeated his visit, this time flying at an
  incredible height, and had the satisfaction of watching three very fast
  German machines come swiftly from the east, circle widely about Bézierville
  in the very first light of dawn and return to their bases. He did not attack
  them then nor the following morning when, through his glasses, he witnessed
  something which left him gasping.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They waire machines of the Intelligence Squad.&rdquo; he reported,
  &ldquo;and Major Blackie, sir, the Gairmans have a grand stoont.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>What that stunt was he described in detail, and it was Blackie&rsquo;s
  turn to gasp. Tam made a personal report to the corps commander, and that
  gray veteran listened in absorbed silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seems incredible,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and yet it can be only
  that. We know maps are getting across to the other side, but as to how they
  manage it, the Intelligence are in the dark. Take all the men you want from
  any of the squadrons, Major Blackie,&rdquo; he said, turning to the squadron
  commander, &ldquo;and see what you can do in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The next scene of the drama was set on a bleak road where an anti-
  aircraft waited patiently for the dawn.</p>

  <p>The battery commander scanned the heavens through his
  glasses&mdash;carefully covering that gray patch of sky which represented his
  &ldquo;area of protection.&rdquo; His signaler lay face downward by the side
  of the dusty road, a telephone receiver clamped to his ears, and carried on a
  <i>sotto voce</i> conversation with a young gentleman similarly employed at a
  distant observation post.</p>

  <p>Now and again he raised his official voice to convey military secrets:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Passin&rsquo; Q. B. 73 T. sir&mdash;headin&rsquo; for Q. Y. 99 B.,
  sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The battery threw a glance left and right to the big trolleys where the A.
  A. guns pointed their slim noses upward; to the expectant gun-crews, their
  faces turned to the officer at the range-finder, then returned to the
  inspection of the clouded blue.</p>

  <p>Suddenly: &ldquo;Swat that fly!&rdquo; A monotonous voice drawled range
  and deflection.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bang! Bang! Bang!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Archies flashed and roared. Black smudges of smoke and white
  puff-balls appeared against the clouds, and through it all sailed one serene
  bird, dazzling white and almost ethereal in the dawn light.</p>

  <p>The intruder into these forbidden realms neither swerved to the right nor
  to the left. The impression left on the mind of the observer was that the
  pilot was unconscious of the discourteous greeting. Shells burst beneath,
  above, before, behind, but this swift dragon-fly hummed on its course and
  presently was out of range of this anti-aircraft battery on the road and was
  receiving the attention of another Archie group three miles to the
  westward.</p>

  <p>The battery commander ordered &ldquo;Cease Fire,&rdquo; and walked across
  to his second in command.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fritz is in a hurry&mdash;reconnaissance?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His captain was drinking from the cup of a vacuum flask and shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Solitary Fritzes hardly go on reconnaissance work,&rdquo; he said;
  &ldquo;he&rsquo;s carrying a message to one of our aerodromes
  and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Passin&rsquo; due north Lorette headin&rsquo; for Q Y. 99 B.,
  sir,&rdquo; yelled the signaler.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stand by!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again the white-winged dragon-fly came streaking through the
  air&mdash;eastward this time. Again the Archies banged and crashed and the
  trollies jerked and swayed to and fro with every explosion, as a tiny boat
  oscillates in the wash of a passing steamer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cease fire!&rdquo; The battery commander walked over to his second,
  filling his pipe. &ldquo;That fellow was nearer fifteen thousand than ten
  thousand,&rdquo; he growled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Twelve thousand and four hundred, sir,&rdquo; replied the other;
  &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t stay long&mdash;that&rsquo;s one of ours
  following.&rdquo; He pointed eastward.</p>

  <p>Another plane was in the skies&mdash;the snarl of her engines came to them
  above the ceaseless pulsation of the distant guns. It was climbing as it
  progressed, climbing perceptibly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That fellow&rsquo;s moving some&mdash;a fast
  scouting-machine.&rdquo; said the battery commander.</p>

  <p><a id="picNNN"
     name="picNNN"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1305041h-images/TFS-19.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>The machine banked over suddenly and began to climb in big spirals. Higher
  and higher it climbed till it reached that altitude where even the rising sun
  failed to find reflection on its wings and it became a black speck. The
  artillerymen watched the climb for ten minutes before a new diversion came.
  It was afforded by the appearance in the east of a big formation which went
  slowly across the sky at an altitude of twelve thousand feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Twenty-five&mdash;twenty-six&mdash;twenty-seven&mdash;say
  thirty,&rdquo; counted the gunner officer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thirty-two,&rdquo; suggested his companion, &ldquo;or thirty-three,
  counting the watcher up aloft&mdash;I wonder what the devil he&rsquo;s doing
  up there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Passin&rsquo; Q. B. 73 T., sir&mdash;headin&rsquo; for Q. Y. 99 B.,
  sir,&rdquo; rasped the weary signaler on the ground.</p>

  <p>It was the white German returning; the gunners recognized her. She was
  following a course identical with that which she had pursued less than half
  an hour before. Again she winged her contemptuous way through the shrapnel
  which a western battery was flinging at her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Old fire against &rsquo;ostile aircraft approachin&rsquo; Q.
  Y.99 B., sir,&rdquo; sang the signaler.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here comes the watcher!&rdquo; said the battery commander as the
  speck in the sky grew larger and larger.</p>

  <p><i>&ldquo;Ticka licka tickal&rdquo;</i></p>

  <p>The chatter of the machine-gun came to the men on the road&mdash;then
  something in the long white &ldquo;body&rdquo; of the enemy burst into flame
  and the machine dropped sideways and tail down to the earth, the
  &ldquo;watcher&rdquo; swooping down in his tracks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He ought to fall somewhere about here,&rdquo; speculated the
  battery commander. &ldquo;What a devil of a time it takes to get &rsquo;em
  down&mdash;here she comes!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Come &ldquo;she&rdquo; did, with a thud and jangle on the very center of
  the white road a hundred yards away.</p>

  <p>The gunners started at a run for the blazing wreckage, the battery
  commander himself leading the way and dashing through the evil-smelling smoke
  to the very heart of the blaze; his scorched hands wrenched away the strap
  which fastened the pilot to his seat and lifted him out.</p>

  <p>He was unconscious and bleeding from the neck, but there was no appearance
  of any fatal wound. The big gunner carried the insensible man a dozen yards
  and laid him on the side of the road. His face was black with smoke, his fair
  hair was singed and amber brown.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A good-looking fellow for a Fritz,&rdquo; said the battery
  commander, scientifically bandaging the neck wound, which was apparently
  superficial. &ldquo;Open his tunic, Grey. Ah! Nothing wrong there. I suppose
  the poor devil got it when he crashed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He filled a cup with hot coffee from his vacuum flask and forced open the
  airman&rsquo;s teeth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Drink hearty, Fritzie,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>The eyelids of the prostrate man fluttered, he gasped and choked and
  muttered something in German. His destroyer had landed in a near-by field and
  the pilot had descended and was walking rapidly toward the group, shedding
  his gloves as he came.</p>

  <p>First he made his way to the blazing machine, hopping in and out of the
  spluttering fire till at last he emerged with a long bamboo pole to the end
  of which was fastened a thin, steel grapnel-hook. He laid this down by the
  side of the road carefully and walked toward the circle of men about the
  fallen airman.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your bird, I think,&rdquo; said the battery commander.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said the pilot.</p>

  <p>He stooped down, unfastened the remaining buttons of the German&rsquo;s
  tunic and felt gingerly into first one and then the other of the inside
  pockets. From the latter he took a flat case of limp leather and opened it,
  disclosing a map which was protected by a mica covering. He nodded and
  grinned and carefully transferred the case to his own pocket.</p>

  <p>Now, it was not unusual for a pilot to carry a map. Ordinarily that map is
  so disposed in his machine that there is no difficulty about its
  consultation. It is on the other hand, very unusual for a map to be carried
  in a pocket which is wholly unget-at-able, and it was more unusual still that
  a German airman prisoner, awakening to consciousness, should signify that his
  first thought was of a map which obviously he could not be employing for the
  purpose of his flight.</p>

  <p>The young man, still dazed, his eyes half closed, stirred uneasily and
  spoke again in the same muttering tone. Then his hands felt for his inside
  pocket. For a moment he explored and then with a curse he sat bolt upright,
  staring from face to face. It took him some little time to grasp his
  unfortunate position and to realize that he was not among friends.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; he asked in English, and he addressed the
  little Scottish aviator who was standing over him regarding him with a look
  in which solicitude and amusement were blended.</p>

  <p><a id="picNNN"

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1305041h-images/TFS-20.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;ve second sight,&rdquo; said the other solemnly;
  &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a failure o&rsquo; mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man on the ground groaned and closed his eyes and presently he spoke
  again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think I can get up now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You had better remain where you are.&rdquo; said the battery
  commander, and Tam nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; our electroplated limousine for
  ye,&rdquo; he said with a note of sarcasm in his tone; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis not
  often we meet the like o&rsquo; ye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All this was very mysterious to the battery commander, but he was too old
  a soldier to ask questions.</p>

  <p>Presently the &ldquo;electroplated limousine&rdquo; came up in a cloud of
  dust, and proved to be a very grimy staff car into which the shaken young man
  was assisted.</p>

  <p>Tam picked up the bamboo pole and strapped it to his nacelle, started up
  his engine and, flying at a thousand feet, overtook and passed his prisoner
  and was waiting for him in the aerodrome when the car pulled up before
  Squadron Headquarters.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE formality of checking the name and division of the
  prisoner, of asking him the conventional questions which he as conventionally
  refused to answer, was got through and Tam and his commander were alone in
  the office.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now let us have a look at that map,&rdquo; said Blackie.</p>

  <p>Tam took the case from his pocket and opened it on the table. It was a
  very ordinary photographic map, what is termed a mosaic, that is to say it
  was made up of a number of squares which had been accurately photographed by
  airmen and pieced together, and, unlike most mosaics, it was small, the
  squares being little more than an inch either way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How did you get him?&rdquo; asked Blackie, looking up.</p>

  <p>Tam coughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; for me,&rdquo; he said modestly,
  &ldquo;to speak in praise o&rsquo; ma own foresight an&rsquo;
  acumen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Blackie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the ither hand,&rdquo; Tam continued, &ldquo;&rsquo;twould be
  doing a grave injustice to the Umpty-fourth if I were to mask ma light. At
  5:26 on the mornin&rsquo; of the 4th instant A received a communication from
  ma respected commander to the effect that hostile aircraft of seenister
  design, to wit the Gairman Intelligence Department, had been behavin&rsquo;
  strangely and even insultingly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Tam, cut all that,&rdquo; said Blackie; &ldquo;I sent you out
  to observe while the squadron was assembling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And A obsairved,&rdquo; said Tam; &ldquo;A obsairved the hostile
  enemy goin&rsquo; due east. A further obsairved the squadron goin&rsquo;
  northeast, so I just hung aroond, ma instinct tellin&rsquo; me that this wee
  feller would return. A knew he would return, for he hadna caught anything,
  for awa&rsquo; up A could see a wee balloon that was driftin&rsquo; slowly
  southward.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blackie nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Presently ma fine lad came back. He had missed it the first time
  and he had missed it the second time, but the third time he spotted it and
  off he went. A had a good peek at him through ma glasses and A saw him push
  out his grand little fishin&rsquo;-rod, hook the cord of the balloon and hike
  it into the nacelle. It didna take so long to get the map and break the
  gas-bag. Mon, it was a grand stoont!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam shook his head in admiration.</p>

  <p>That morning the Assistant Provost Marshal of Bézierville arrested the
  amiable Mr. Yeldstein and impounded him and his gas-cylinders, his little

  <h3>First published in <i>Everybody&lsquo;s Magazine</i>, May 1919</h3>

  <p class="first">TAM walked to the door of his hut and peered cautiously
  forth. He commanded a view of one corner of the aerodrome, but it was a
  corner from which Cadet William Best was not in sight, and Tam closed the
  door and returned to his writing-table, muttering uncomplimentary words.</p>

  <p>He squared his shoulders to the monumental task he had set himself. Filed
  neatly before him in the heart of an official blue folder labeled
  &ldquo;Corps Orders,&rdquo; the flaps outspread and ready to be closed at the
  first alarm, were some hundred quarto sheets of manuscript written in
  Tam&rsquo;s peculiar caligraphy.</p>

  <p>The first page bore, one under the other, some five titles, all of which
  had been crossed out. So whatever this thrilling romance might be called
  eventually, it would not be, &ldquo;The Terror of the Sky,&rdquo; or
  &ldquo;The Birdman of Blood,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Crime in the Clouds,&rdquo;
  or &ldquo;Looping Larry&rsquo;s Last Lap,&rdquo; nor even &ldquo;The Pirate
  Pilot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This was Tam&rsquo;s guilty secret, a secret he shared with Boy Billy
  Best. He was writing a book; at least he and Billy were writing it in
  collaboration, for if there was some uncertainty as to what the title of this
  &ldquo;Story of Mystery and Crime&rdquo; (to quote the subtitle) should be,
  its authorship was definitely ascribed in carefully printed characters to
  &ldquo;Tam McTavish, R.F.C., and Cadet William Best, U. S. Army.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam took up his pen, dipped it slowly in the ink and wrote:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was a terrible moment for the brave lads of the air. What should
  they do? Hector felt his heart beating, his throat was filled with black rage
  and hate, his hands were working convulsively.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Beyond this Tam could not make <i>Hector</i> go. <i>Hector</i> was the
  hero who had been sent forward from the City of the Plains to make a
  reconnaissance. The City of the Plains (conveniently adjacent to the Mexican
  border) was awaiting the advent of an invading army and <i>Hector</i> had
  discovered that same army advancing through a pass in the mountains.</p>

  <p>The scene had been laid, against Tam&rsquo;s better judgment, in America.
  Tam had suggested that it should be laid in Scotland, a suggestion which
  Billy had rejected with scorn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Scots haven&rsquo;t got any enemies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;m no&rsquo; so sure about that,&rdquo; said Tam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, who would you be at war with, anyway? You haven&rsquo;t
  anybody on your borders who are likely to invade Scotland except the
  English.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam shook his head in doubt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a gey lot of tourists come to Scotland in the
  summer,&rdquo; he said, but he had agreed that his suggestion was weak. So
  the story became American, and Tam was reconciled to the overriding of his
  views by the fact that the American public would &ldquo;go crazy,&rdquo; as
  said the enthusiastic Billy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;m no&rsquo; so sure,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;that
  they&rsquo;ll go as crazy as that. Noo, my idea is that we&rsquo;ve got this
  story a&rsquo; wrong. Theer&rsquo;s nae woman in it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woman!&rdquo; scoffed Billy Best. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mushy, Tam!
  What&rsquo;s a woman to do with flying? For the Lord&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye talk like the meenister of the wee kirk,&rdquo; said Tam;
  &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a wonder ye fly at a&rsquo; wi&rsquo; such a wind-pressure,
  Billy. There&rsquo;s nae sentiment in ye. Mon, where&rsquo;s the gentle-faced
  dauchter of the auld trapper that&rsquo;s been lured awa&rsquo; by the deadly
  Choctaws? Wheer&rsquo;s the Pride of Minin&rsquo; Camp wi&rsquo; a pair
  o&rsquo; six-shooters? Have ye ever known a story that hadn&rsquo;t a girlie
  in it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is a story,&rdquo; insisted the obstinate Billy,&rdquo; of
  flying, and there isn&rsquo;t going to be a woman in it&mdash;it&rsquo;ll be
  a novel story.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re inhuman,&rdquo; said Tam, but he did not press the
  matter.</p>

  <p>And here he was held up and Billy, the faithless collaborator, who had
  sworn by all his gods, including Gee and Giminy and Gosh, that he would
  return at four o&rsquo;clock from Amiens, had not kept his appointment.</p>

  <p>Tam made one more attack upon <i>Hector</i> before he laid down his pen,
  but the attack was repulsed with heavy losses to Tam&rsquo;s confidence and,
  with a sigh, he folded away the manuscript and locked it in his drawer.</p>

  <p>He made a careful search of Billy&rsquo;s belongings, felt in his pockets,
  opened his suitcase, groped under his bed, turned back his pillows and found
  the box of cigars that Billy had secreted, helped himself, replacing the box
  under his own pillow, and made his way to the mess-room.</p>

  <p>Half a gale was blowing and the sky was filled with flying clouds, and Tam
  did not need to pause at the notice-board in the mess-room to read the
  weather report and forecast. There would be no &ldquo;Wind S. W. 6 miles at
  3,000 feet, light ground mists,&rdquo; for the barometer was still
  falling.</p>

  <p>In these circumstances he expected to find the mess full and was not
  disappointed. The smoking-room was crowded, for such weather as this which
  makes flying impossible, enables airmen to pay social calls upon their
  fellows and adds a pleasant variety to the bridge-tables, which are inclined
  to become rather monotonous and stodgy when the same people play night after
  night.</p>

  <p>There were no cards on the table, partly because the visitors were sitting
  on them and partly because there was a great discussion in progress.</p>

  <p>Weatherby, squadron commander of the Umpty-ninth, with two rows of ribbons
  on his breast and only a faint suspicion of hair on his upper lip, yelled a
  welcome to Tam as he came in.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ask Tam!&rdquo; he shouted&mdash;you had to shout to make yourself
  heard when twenty-five strategists were all offering their views at one and
  the same time.</p>

  <p>Blackie looked round over his shoulder. &ldquo;What do you think, Tam,
  about the offensive? Where is it going to be?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or is it going to happen at all?&rdquo; demanded Weatherby.
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just come down from the Ypres salient. No signs of Huns
  there, except the usual crowd.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How far did you go back?&rdquo; demanded Blackie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As far as Namur. The only remarkable thing about the trip was the
  number of &lsquo;hates&rsquo; I got. I was hated in all sorts of funny places
  where you never saw an Archie battery before.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Railway junctions?&rdquo; suggested somebody.</p>

  <p>Weatherby shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you expect
  them there. On plain bits of the line where there are no villages or houses,
  in open fields&mdash;there was no method about it. I was quite rattled after
  a bit. Of course, they gave me hell at Namur, but that is understandable. But
  why should I get hell at Wieglehoek, which has one farm, a church and an
  estaminet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Huns are trying out some new Archie batteries,&rdquo; suggested
  Rolls of Weatherby&rsquo;s squadron.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That hasn&rsquo;t answered our question,&rdquo; said Blackie;
  &ldquo;is there going to be an offensive and where? What do you say,
  Tam?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;m no&rsquo; so sure,&rdquo; said Tam. &ldquo;A was taking a
  peek behind the St. Quentin front on the Sabbath and A was hated verra
  brightly, but there was nothing strange so far as ma puir auld eyes could
  tell. The peaceful land was bathed in sunlight, the little bairds were
  singing, and a regiment of Huns was marching away from kirk, behind their
  band&mdash;a gay an&rsquo; gallant display. As A looked doon, the sicht of
  these martial men in their gentle mood, retairning maybe from a heartrending
  sermon about the Kaiser to their warm Sunday sausage brocht a lump to ma
  throat. Ma first inclination was to loose a couple of trays of ammunition at
  them, but ma better feelings prevailed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, no, Tam,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;yer too far off and ye
  mayn&rsquo;t hit &rsquo;em. What did the government give ye bombs for?&rsquo;
  So I dropped a couple right in the middle of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did they scatter?&rdquo; asked Weatherby.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They seemed a bit put oot,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;but A
  didn&rsquo;t wait, for all the Archies in the world opened up on
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some people think it will be down in the Champagne.&rdquo; said
  Blackie, &ldquo;against the French. Demaurier was telling me the other day
  that his people had spotted a concentration there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More likely the Aubers Ridge.&rdquo; said Weatherby, shaking his
  head; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a sure break-through there in the angle of the Lys
  and the Lawe. Besides, they&rsquo;ve got the ridge for observation and
  that&rsquo;s a big advantage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was the quietest sector all last year? Was it no&rsquo;
  between Arras and St. Quentin? Mon, I&rsquo;ve flown fifty miles along that
  line and never seen a German in the air. I took a flight down there last week
  and had to fight my way oot. There&rsquo;s more caircuses between Quéant and
  St. Quentin than Barnum ever heard aboot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But no concentrations?&rdquo; asked Weatherby.</p>

  <p>Tam shook his head.</p>

  <p>Billy Best was waiting for Tam when the pilot returned to his room.
  &ldquo;Where did ye get to, Billy?&rdquo; demanded Tam reproachfully;
  &ldquo;for two hours A&rsquo;ve been wastin&rsquo; ma time discussin&rsquo;
  the strategy an&rsquo; tactics o&rsquo; the war when A micht ha&rsquo; been
  followin&rsquo; ma literary career. &lsquo;What would ye do,&rsquo; sez the
  young gentleman to me, &lsquo;suppose ye was Hindenburg?&rsquo; &lsquo;Change
  ma face,&rsquo; I says. &ldquo;Would ye attack frontally or sideways?&rsquo;
  they asked, &lsquo;or would ye use strategy or tactics or a little of
  both?&rsquo; says they. Mon, they were frichtfully struck on ma tellin&rsquo;
  &rsquo;em, but I wouldna!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam sat down to his table and jerked out the manuscript.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a graund nicht for romance. Billy,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;but A&rsquo;m stuck. A&rsquo;ve got Hector in an awfu&rsquo;
  position&mdash;listen to this:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hector glanced left and right an&rsquo; behint him. There was no
  one in sicht but the hated foe. His radiator was smashed an&rsquo; his
  intake&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See here, Tam,&rdquo; said Billy in his shirtsleeves, with his back
  to his companion, &ldquo;why not make Hector pancake or crash and have him
  rescued by a beautiful French girl who hides him, eh?&rdquo; his voice was
  careless, so was his hand, for as he splashed water into the big enameled
  basin, preparatory to making his evening ablutions, certain errant drops
  reached Tam&rsquo;s neck, &ldquo;or, how would it be if a mysterious triplane
  comes barging out of a cloud and rescues the falling hero, and it turns out
  that this fellow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The clood or the triplane?&rdquo; asked Tam politely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This pilot fellow, I mean, isn&rsquo;t a man at all, but just a
  peach of a French girl?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam put down his pen and turned. &ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; he said, eying the
  boy keenly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter wi&rsquo; ye?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy blushed and rubbed his face vigorously with a towel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; he said airily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where have ye been?&rdquo; asked Tam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, to be honest, Tam&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been to see a friend of
  mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I feared it,&rdquo; said Tam sadly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name
  and in what store in Peronne does she sairve the picture postals to the
  ribald soldiery?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy blushed more furiously than ever.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you know her, do you, Tam? She&rsquo;s just fine, that girl!
  Think of it! She&rsquo;s never been out of the battle zone&mdash;her brother
  was killed at Roye and her father at Verdun and she just hangs on with her
  mother and won&rsquo;t budge. They&rsquo;re wonderful, these Frenchwomen,
  <i>pour la France</i>, and all that sort of thing, Tam&mdash;full of grand
  spirit and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hark at the heathen American talking French!&rdquo; said Tam
  addressing the roof; &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>pour la France,</i>&rsquo; says he,
  an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s been pourin&rsquo; all the day. Billy, when ye were
  pourin&rsquo; la France over a grocery counter did ye no&rsquo; think of the
  girl ye left in Washin&rsquo;ton, Ohio, or whatever the shire may be? Did ye
  no&rsquo; remember the girl that stood on the quay at Phullydelphia an&rsquo;
  watched the big ship carry ye away, her bright an&rsquo; luminous eyes filled
  wi&rsquo; tears? Did ye no&rsquo; recall Maisie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maisie!&rdquo; gasped Billy, recovering from the trance into which
  Tam&rsquo;s inventive genius had thrown him, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
  know&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t a girl&mdash;and, anyway, I didn&rsquo;t sail from
  Philadelphia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam replaced the manuscript and rose. &ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;A&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to talk to ye fer yeer good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have a cigar,&rdquo; invited Billy hastily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye can&rsquo;t bribe me&mdash;unless ye&rsquo;ve something better
  than the cheap trash ye keep under yeer pillow&mdash;anyway, A don&rsquo;t
  want to smoke. Billy&mdash;it&rsquo;s a graund idea, the descendants of
  George L. Washin&rsquo;ton&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the L for, anyway?&rdquo; growled Billy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Late,&rdquo; replied Tam calmly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a graund idea
  for the great-grandson of George L. Wash&rsquo;in&rsquo;ton to wed the
  heiress of the McLafayette, but, Billy, we can&rsquo;t do
  it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s talking of marrying?&rdquo; grumbled the boy.
  &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t have me, anyway. I don&rsquo;t want to do anything
  but just look at her&mdash;God, it makes me feel good. Tam! It&rsquo;s like a
  mind bath to know that that kid has just stuck to her post&mdash;when the
  Boche was in Peronne, when the Somme battle was in full swing and is still
  carrying on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam was silent. He had an instinct as delicate as a woman&rsquo;s and he
  visioned the clean splendor of the boy&rsquo;s mind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, aye,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;tis a fine race, Billy, even
  if they do charge ye the price for butter that ye ought to pay.&rdquo; (Tam
  had taken on temporarily the post of mess caterer during the
  president&rsquo;s absence on leave and the price of local luxuries had left
  their mark upon him.) &ldquo;But A doot if Peronne&rsquo;s a good place to
  be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Billy confidently;
  &ldquo;she&rsquo;s got a big dugout behind the store and when the Boche is
  night bombing, she skips in there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;m no&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; of night bombin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
  said Tam. &ldquo;Billy, the Boche is gettin&rsquo; ready for his big
  push&mdash;he&rsquo;ll take Peronne.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rats,&rdquo; scoffed Billy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah weel,&rdquo; said Tam, and that ended the discussion.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE next day was fine and Tam made a reconnaissance
  eastward&mdash;so far eastward that he saw....</p>

  <p>Back he came at top speed, dodging barrage of shell and airplane, intent
  only upon carrying the information he had acquired to headquarters.</p>

  <p>The British knew the worst three days before the blow fell&mdash;but three
  days is all too short a warning. Divisions began moving from remote corners
  of France, but still with caution. Reserves stood in readiness from Dunkirk
  to Champagne&mdash;but at any moment a change of enemy direction might be
  noted.</p>

  <p>Fourteen divisions strung along a front of fifty miles, three divisions in
  the rear their only reserves, and, on top of it all, fog! Fog that hid the
  railways, the roads, the vital nodal points! Fog that tied the fuming airmen
  to the ground while the rumble of the guns increased to a thunderous chorus!
  Fog that lifted tantalizingly and sent hundreds of machines roaring upward
  only to come groping their way back at terrible peril to themselves. Not a
  fog as you understand fog&mdash;a thick wall which blots out immediate
  objects&mdash;but the fog which blurs all objects on the ground at a distance
  of a thousand feet.</p>

  <p>Then came the night of the twentieth. Somewhere in the mist behind the
  horizon formed by the spires and roofs of Cambrai, behind the stark woods and
  the rolling hills, lay danger. The horizon itself was blurred and limited by
  the mists which kept the outposts straining ears and eyes for some hint of
  the mystery which overhangs all battle-fields on the eve of an offensive.
  Gunner officers in their solitary observation posts could do no more than
  record the hits that came within their restricted view. The telltale flash of
  enemy guns was hidden from them and such counter battery work as
  &ldquo;O.Pip&rdquo; could control was little.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Observation post.]</p>

  <p>Save for the ceaseless clang of the opposing artilleries which had grown
  in intensity during the night, there was no sign of unusual activity.
  &ldquo;O. Pip&rdquo; reported strange happenings he had witnessed in the
  twilight; for example, he had seen German field batteries gallop up into
  action and unlimber. He had seen the teams gallop back again, leaving the
  guns stranded and apparently unattended, though he guessed that the gun crew
  had dug themselves in, or had taken positions near trenches which the
  obliging German infantry had dug for them on the previous night.</p>

  <p>The guns were too near the enemy&rsquo;s front line to capture, and an
  inquisitive patrol of the Black Watch which went out to investigate, not this
  but other strange phenomena the night before, had not returned. A kilted
  figure lying on the German wire had been revealed through glasses, but even
  this told the men nothing. Fog and the night hid the feverish preparations
  which were going on at the back of beyond. The French and British airmen
  going about their desperate business, could switch their bomb releases and
  send their whistling charges into the black void below, could in the
  momentary glare of the explosion glimpse tiny transport lorries and black
  snakes of men threading the narrow streets of the town, or in the bursting
  white light of a flare, note the congestion of carriages and trucks in the
  railway station they were attacking, but such things indicated no more than
  normal activities on the part of the army.</p>

  <p>And yet from a hundred stations and sidings, the men in field gray were
  pouring, knapsacks belted about with their heavy great-coats and crowned with
  spare boots, bombs at their belts, two days&rsquo; rations of food and an
  iron ration in their haversacks, one hundred and fifty rounds of ammunition
  in their pouches, gas-masks at the &ldquo;ready&rdquo; and the gripping fear
  of the morrow in their hearts.</p><br>

  <p class="first">STORM troops, those ugly darlings of the corps, were there,
  lightly equipped, but well supplied with bombs. The gas corps, the
  flame-throwing corps and, somewhere in the background, those sinister
  Pomeranians whose duty it is to strip and bury the dead.</p>

  <p>All night long the reserves were moving up, for it was the eve of
  &ldquo;Michael&rsquo;s Day,&rdquo; the day of victory, the day of vengeance.
  The British line was to be pierced and turned northward, the French pushed
  back beyond the swampy estuary of the Somme&mdash;and then in good time and
  at the Germans&rsquo; leisure, both enemy armies were to be destroyed.</p>

  <p>Endless were the columns that came tramping through the night; never
  ceasing was the clatter and clamor of shunting trucks and rolling wheels. Von
  Berne&rsquo;s corps to the north was deploying. Lindequist&rsquo;s corps on
  his left was up to fullest strength and had a reserve division to make sure.
  Kuhne&rsquo;s, Grunert&rsquo;s and Stael&rsquo;s corps&mdash;a phalanx of
  gray coats accurately marshalled under Otto von Below, the newest German
  hero.</p>

  <p>The Umpty-fourth stood waiting in the mist, standing by their
  machines&mdash;waiting, waiting&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My God, this is awful&mdash;this mist! Do you think&mdash;do you
  think they&rsquo;ll take Peronne&mdash;but she&rsquo;d have time to clear,
  wouldn&rsquo;t she, Tam&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam made no reply.</p>

  <p>Not that day nor yet the next was Peronne taken. There were days and
  nights of furious, frantic endeavor, when men worked and fought without
  sleep, when the Umpty-fourth aerodrome was shelled to a blackened heap, when
  day reconnaissance followed night bombing without intermission, and
  haggard-faced pilots hawked through the skies, sustained by the sense of the
  army&rsquo;s imminent peril.</p>

  <p class="first">THE day after Peronne fell Blackie sent for Tam. They were
  occupying a new aerodrome to the west of the Amiens line and Tam had slept
  for six hours on the bare ground, a sleep of sheer exhaustion, when he was
  awakened by Blackie&rsquo;s summons. That great man, unshaven, chewing
  vigorously at the end of a cold cigar, beckoned Tam into the hut which served
  as his headquarters.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A special mission for you, Tam,&rdquo; he said;
  &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a woman in Peronne who calls herself Marie Vaupois. Her
  real name is Clara Geth. She was left behind in Peronne when the Germans
  evacuated the town, and she had collected a whole bunch of information. Our
  intelligence tells us that she&rsquo;s leaving at eleven o&rsquo;clock by
  motor-car for Spa. I haven&rsquo;t time to tell you how she hoodwinked the
  French authorities or impersonated the daughter of a French soldier, but she
  kept a little picture-post-card shop.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam put his hand to his eyes. &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; he said unsteadily.
  &ldquo;What would ye have me do, Captain Blackie, sir?&rdquo;</p>

  <p><a id="picNNN"
     name="picNNN"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1305041h-images/TFS-22.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a chance in a hundred, but you may have the luck,&rdquo;
  said Blackie rapidly; &ldquo;she mustn&rsquo;t reach Spa. She carries too
  much in her head for our comfort. Kill her. You can either bomb her or
  machine-gun her, but she&rsquo;s got to be killed. It&rsquo;s a rotten job, I
  know,&rdquo; he said clapping the other on the shoulder, &ldquo;but if you
  look carefully over the ground, Tam, as you pass, you will see hundreds of
  our own fellows who are lying unburied because a woman like that has been
  working secretly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh aye,&rdquo; said Tam.</p>

  <p>He swung out without another word. The riggers had finished repairing his
  machine and she was loaded up. Soon he was zooming up into the clear skies,
  heading for Peronne. He fought off an attempt that was made to intercept him
  and a few minutes before eleven reached the north road which runs through
  Gouzeaucourt.</p>

  <p>The roads were crowded with troops, but presently he saw a car speeding up
  one side which had been left clear and he dropped for observation and attack.
  The lorry Archies blazed at him. Machine guns came into action and their
  bullets zipped through his wings. He saw the troops break from the road to
  cover but the car sped on and at the back he caught a glimpse of a woman with
  a purple motor-veil and swooped down almost vertically, his machine gun
  cackling furiously.</p>

  <p>Nothing could live under such a fire. He had one glimpse of a huddled
  figure in the tonneau before the car swerved into a ditch and overturned.
  Then he set his face for home.</p>

  <p>He landed in the aerodrome and Billy came to meet him with a radiant
  face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tam, Tam,&rdquo; he yelled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had news!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam&rsquo;s heart stood still.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have ye, Billy?&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She got away, Tam. Nobody saw her after the Germans came in, and
  her house wasn&rsquo;t touched. Isn&rsquo;t that bully? Gee! I&rsquo;d like
  to see her just for two minutes,&rdquo; said the boy, his eyes shining.</p>

  <p>Tam looked down. For his part he was trying not to see her.</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>Everybody&lsquo;s Magazine</i>, June 1919</h3>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;TAM,&rdquo; said Billy.</p>

  <p>Tam sat at his table, his pen poised, his eyes fixed on the calendar which
  hung on the wall. So he had been staring for ten minutes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tam.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam woke from his reverie with a start and, laying down his pen, turned to
  his companion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Billy?&rdquo; he asked, and there was a note in his
  voice which was new to Billy Best.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you know that the Infant Samuel brought down Gray and Mirdle
  to-day?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye don&rsquo;t say&mdash;puir lads.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Long usage to the tragedies of war flying had never dulled his
  sensibility. There was always the same tremor of concern in his voice
  whenever a good comrade passed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Deid,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;or missing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Smashed up&mdash;fell inside our lines; they&rsquo;ll both
  recover.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam took up his pen again and sucked the end. &ldquo;The wee lad is
  gettin&rsquo; ower bold,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; his
  habit to strafe chasers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy, his hands behind his head, lay on his bed watching a spider on the
  ceiling. Presently: &ldquo;Tam&mdash;I&rsquo;ve fixed that interview with de
  Lisle&mdash;Buller says he&rsquo;ll come. Could you pick us up on the Amiens
  road&mdash;we&rsquo;re going out to buy some things early and could go on to
  de Lisle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, aye,&rdquo; said Tam absently.</p>

  <p>Another long pause.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tam&mdash;what&rsquo;s biting you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been moping all day&mdash;are you in love?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam uncrossed and crossed his legs before he replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Weel,&rdquo; he said cautiously, &ldquo;A&rsquo;ve a friend,
  Billy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy remembered that Tam never spoke of his wife except in these terms,
  and sniffed, and Tam&rsquo;s hard face softened in a smile as tender as a
  woman&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the fashion to pretend that ye&rsquo;ve only to be
  marrit to be miserable, Billy.&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A&rsquo;ve kent
  hundreds an&rsquo; hundreds of laddies like ye. &rsquo;Tis one of the
  illusions of youth, like the illusion that ye can win money by playin&rsquo;
  the races or by pickin&rsquo; the pea from the thimble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He returned his gaze to the calendar and a troubled frown wrinkled his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bein&rsquo; American an&rsquo; ma&mdash;ma friend bein&rsquo;
  American,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;maybe ye&rsquo;ll understand what A&rsquo;m
  tellin&rsquo; ye&mdash;it&rsquo;s a michty sacred confidence A&rsquo;m
  gi&rsquo;in&rsquo; ye, Billy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Tam&mdash;have a cigar?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Billy; this is verra serious&mdash;weel, a seegair will
  no&rsquo; make it worse&mdash;thank ye.&rdquo; He bit off the end of the
  proffered weed. &ldquo;Billy, ma friend has been writin&rsquo; strange
  letters to me. Maybe in yer abysmal ignorance o&rsquo; women yer instinct
  will help ye to understand where ma matured reason lets me crash.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy ignored the challenge and allowed the slur on his judgment to pass.
  He knew Tam well enough to recognize in the half-whimsical, half-serious
  preamble a certain strained anxiety.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A willna tell ye everything&mdash;but ye know ma friend
  married&mdash;well, &rsquo;twas what the young feller who does the society
  notes in the Scotsman calls a miss-alleeance&mdash; she marrit beneath
  her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He swallowed something and Billy was silent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;ve been verra, verra happy wi&rsquo; ma friend,
  Billy,&rdquo; Tam went on slowly, &ldquo;an&rsquo; she writes twice a week
  regularly an&rsquo; they&rsquo;re letters&mdash;Billy, they&rsquo;re
  no&rsquo; mortal in their kindness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stopped again, still staring at the calendar, his strong hands clasping
  and unclasping in his perturbation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I got a letter this morn,&rdquo; he said in a low voice,&rdquo;
  &rsquo;twas sweet an&rsquo; lovin&rsquo;, but, mon, it was sad! It was like a
  letter from the dyin&rsquo;, Billy&mdash;the letter of a dear body
  knockin&rsquo; at Peter&rsquo;s Gate an&rsquo; sendin&rsquo; one
  wistfu&rsquo; glance back&mdash;A canna read it to ye, but &rsquo;twas
  a&rsquo; regrets an&rsquo; hopes&mdash;would A love her memory as A
  loved&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He choked and stopped and his chin went down to his breast. Presently,
  with an impatient sideway jerk of his head, he went on.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fear in the letter&mdash;Billy&mdash;that just
  sickens me&mdash;that makes ma verra soul curl up like a parched
  paper&mdash;God knows what it&rsquo;s a&rsquo; aboot. Maybe she knows
  she&rsquo;s made a mistake, the puir lassie, maybe she&rsquo;s met some lad
  she kent awa&rsquo; back in America&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And maybe she&rsquo;s fed up with waiting for you to go on leave,
  Tam,&rdquo; said Billy wisely; &ldquo;after all, it must be six months since
  you went to England&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Scotland,&rdquo; murmured Tam, &ldquo;though she&rsquo;s in England
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, go back home&mdash;you can&rsquo;t expect a girl to sit down
  and patiently wait without grouching. Now, I understand women,
  Tam&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam was smiling now, smiling through tears. &ldquo;Awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo;
  ye, ye arrogant pup!&rdquo; he said in quite his old tone; &ldquo;but maybe
  ye&rsquo;re right an&rsquo; A&rsquo;ll ask leave in the morn. Noo help
  yersel&rsquo; to one of yer ain seegairs, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll have a graund
  talk about the Infant Samuel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And of him they talked until the small hours, for the Infant Samuel was
  that phenomenon, the perfect air-fighter, and that he happened to be a German
  in no way detracted from the interest that was felt in him even on the
  civilized side of the battle-line.</p>

  <p>Therefore did they speak of him until they slept, and met the next day,
  reinforced by a third redoubtable fighter, to speak of him again.</p>

  <p>A solemn old gentleman of twenty-three&mdash;and twenty-three feels
  horribly old when it has killed its seventeenth man&mdash;sat at a round
  table in that most disreputable of estaminets (it was called most
  incomprehensibly &ldquo;The Grand Choice&rdquo; and stands on the
  Amiens-Arras road) and discussed the art and practise of wilful murder, the
  paucity of leave and the perfectly ripping qualities of Yorkshire terriers
  with our sober veteran of nineteen who had three or four slaughters, several
  attempted suicides and divers other acts of violence to his credit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The great thing is to keep away from stereoptyped methods,
  Billy,&rdquo; said the sage of twenty-three, whose name was Buller.
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where so many fellows go wrong. They patent a new stunt
  and work it too long. Presently Fritz gets &rsquo;em taped&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said Billy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gets wise to &rsquo;em,&rdquo; translated Buller; &ldquo;the
  counter-stunt appears one fine morning and the patent lapses, owner being too
  dead to renew. They are bound to cut you sooner or later,&rdquo; went on this
  cheerful youth complacently, &ldquo;and likely as not you&rsquo;ll be brought
  down by a beastly Archie or shot down by a puddin&rsquo; headed Prussian
  private. But it&rsquo;s your job to prevent yourself being outed in a
  legitimate way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I get you,&rdquo; said Billy. &ldquo;Now, Tam
  says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Tam,&rdquo; said Buller with respect; &ldquo;well, you see, Tam
  is always inventing new stunts and he never tries &rsquo;em more than three
  times. Tam is the only man that ever brought down a Boche machine with a hand
  grenade, and that wants some doing, but he never tried the hand-grenade trick
  twice, and Tam brought down von Bruning by falling into a tail dive and
  shooting up, and that was never done before. Tam has done everything and
  still finds new things to do. I am not talking about genius&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bouquets should be left with the stage-door keeper,&rdquo; said
  Billy, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t apologize. You mean well. Tam&rsquo;s all
  right.&rdquo; He looked at his wrist-watch. &ldquo;Are we renting a room
  here?&rdquo; he asked politely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got another five minutes,&rdquo; replied Buller,
  consulting his own watch.</p>

  <p>He walked to the door of the estaminet and looked down the long road and,
  save for an ambulance convoy moving slowly back to the base hospital, there
  was no one in sight. Overhead an artillery plane was moaning its mournful way
  to its aerodrome and at this Buller cocked a critical eye.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Infant missed you, anyway,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a low-down business shooting spotters,&rdquo; said
  Billy. &ldquo;Tam and me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tam and I,&rdquo; corrected the veteran.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tam and me,&rdquo; said the defiant Billy, &ldquo;reckon
  we&rsquo;ll lay for the Infant Samuel and rock him to sleep, yes, sir,
  and&mdash;there&rsquo;s Tam.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam was no more than a swift-moving cloud of dust on the long road.
  Presently the cloud thinned and revealed a small motor-car and Tam drew up
  his machine chick-a-chucking noisily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the best A could do,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
  will ye be so kind, Mr. Buller, as to say nothin&rsquo; that will hairt the
  patriotic feelin&rsquo;s o&rsquo; ma wee friend, Billy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The fellow that made that car is turning out two submarine chasers
  a day,&rdquo; said Billy, not without pride. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to make
  thousands of one-man submarines&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that, but where will he get his crews?&rdquo;
  asked the practical Mr. Buller; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll want pretty daring
  fellows for a job like that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter wi&rsquo; the fellers who drive his
  cars?&rdquo; asked Tam. &ldquo;Mon, it wants nairve. Get in, Mr.
  Buller&mdash;that bit o&rsquo; tin wi&rsquo; the handle is the door. Hauld
  tight&mdash;A&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to start.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>You may imagine three enthusiastic Egyptologists taking long journeys to
  consult a fortunate fourth who had seen with his own eyes the scarab of
  Amen-Ra; or the pilgrimage of three astronomers to compare notes with one who
  has discovered in the spectrum of Nueva Aquilæ the lines of calcium; or the
  journeyings of zoologists to greet the traveler who, in the deeps of the
  Bongindanga forest, has had the good fortune to photograph an okapi. It
  requires an adaptable imagination to understand the object of the journey
  which three members of the Flying Corps were taking.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THESE three young men were great craftsmen, great
  enthusiasts and great scientists. They were slayers of men, but that was only
  incidental to the greater business of their days. The killing of a man merely
  marked the completeness of their achievement. If they could have tagged an
  enemy airplane with red chalk, and by such marking passed the machine and its
  occupants automatically from service, they would have been satisfied. They
  were on their way now to talk with a hero of twenty and a few odd months who
  could tell them ever so many things about another young gentleman they wanted
  to kill.</p>

  <p>The hero lived in a big aerodrome behind the French lines (to the relief
  of Billy, who had rashly undertaken the duties of interpreter, he spoke
  excellent English), and when the three musketeers found him he was eating
  large slices of bread and cheese and jam and washing it down with immense
  drafts of <i>vin ordinaire.</i></p>

  <p>He was the French ace de Lisle, and he had a transparent little mustache
  and about twelve medals.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>M&rsquo;sieur</i>,&rdquo; said Billy valiantly, &ldquo;<i>pardon
  si nous dérangez</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Dérangons</i>,&rdquo; murmured Buller; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
  plural.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And singular too,&rdquo; laughed de Lisle. &ldquo;Tam, Bill-ee Best
  and Buller, isn&rsquo;t it? Welcome, my aviators! What is happening on your
  part of the line? Bissing&rsquo;s circus was performing the last time I heard
  from you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He seated them, energetically talking all the time.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Weel, ye see, Mr. de Lisle,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
  aboot the Infant Samuel we&rsquo;ve come to see ye&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah. The Bébé! Good!&rdquo; smiled de Lisle. &ldquo;Yes, we know him
  and I have seen him. A cherub, by gar! An angel! He has been on the Champagne
  front for a year and a terrible fellow he has been, par-bleu! I was taken
  prisoner a month ago and saw him&mdash;engine failed and down I went into the
  Boche lines. He came down after me and I saw him. At first I thought it was a
  little girl when I saw him jump from his machine and come across to me. I was
  amazed, dumfounded; it was incredible! Blue eyes, hair like spun
  gold&mdash;not cut short, Boche fashion, but curly; complexion like a peach
  and the smile of a beneficent cupid! And polite, m&rsquo;sieurs! A veritable
  gentleman. Saxon, of course&mdash;age about seventeen and the pride of the
  German army. I have tried to kill him twice since then&mdash;I escaped, as
  you know, on the night of my capture and I am not allowed to cross the German
  lines any more.&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders, desolated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He must be a graund little feller,&rdquo; said Tam.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to have a crack at him. What like&rsquo;s his
  machine?&rdquo;</p>

  <p><a id="picNNN"

  </div><br>

  <p>&ldquo;Fokker improved,&rdquo; said de Lisle; &ldquo;it turns very quickly
  and is a devil of a climber.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are his stunts?&rdquo; asked Billy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All of them,&rdquo; replied de Lisle promptly. &ldquo;He shoots up
  from below, and you want to be careful about getting on his tail&mdash;he has
  a trick of stalling and shooting backward. He&rsquo;ll never give you the
  sun&mdash;that&rsquo;s certain. I&rsquo;ve never known a man who got between
  him and the sun. He shoots better to the left than to the right, and the only
  way you&rsquo;ll ever get him is to zoom up at him on his blindest
  side&mdash;that&rsquo;s the right, and my faith! that infant has very good
  sight on the blind side, too!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For an hour the talk ran to and fro like the shuttle of a loom, leaping
  from Tam to de Lisle, from de Lisle to Billy, from Buller to Tam, and
  presently there was woven a good piece of education in the ways and wiles of
  the Infant Samuel.</p>

  <p>They went back to their quarters that afternoon with important data common
  to all three, but with three views on the best method of employing their
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>Buller, on early patrol duty, spent the greater part of the night planning
  his method of attack and went up confidently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wish you were in this flight, Tam,&rdquo; he said at parting.
  &ldquo;I feel I&rsquo;m going to meet the Infant.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bring me back a lock o&rsquo; that golden hair,&rdquo; said Tam
  gruesomely. &ldquo;Billy is makin&rsquo; a collection.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Buller&rsquo;s prophecy was fulfilled. He met the Infant over Citie St.
  Augustine, north of Lens, and attacked him from below. The Infant turned and
  windmilled, wing over wing, and Buller, pulling clear of the disorder,
  exposed himself for the fraction of a second....</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Buller is down,&rdquo; said Blackie, coming into the mess for
  breakfast; &ldquo;fell in our lines, poor chap.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>No need to ask any further question. The &ldquo;poor chap&rdquo; was all
  the announcement that need be made.</p>

  <p>Buller, with a puzzled smile frozen on his white face, was lying in a
  trench covered by an army blanket and the R. A. F. mechanics were already
  digging his grave.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pass the toast, Tam,&rdquo; said Billy gruffly. Tam knew just how
  he felt.</p>

  <p>Later in the morning they learned that it was a veritable Infant kill.
  Witnesses there were in plenty and victims also. The pilot and observer of a
  stricken artillery bus on the Arras road had seen the fight&mdash;and had
  even felt its repercussion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve given a circus to that Infant,&rdquo; telephoned the
  brigadier to the headquarters of the Umpty-fourth; &ldquo;for the moment
  he&rsquo;s pursuing Richthofen&rsquo;s tactics.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Richthofen&rsquo;s tactics were familiar to every airman. The leader
  commands a dozen swift machines and the circus patrols in formation. The task
  of the eleven is rounding out any sky stragglers they meet to ring them round
  until escape is impossible. Then the leader on number twelve drops to deliver
  the coup de grace. It is only possible over the German lines, which means
  that it is always possible because it is there where the Allied airmen are to
  be found.</p>

  <p>The Umpty-fourth turned out in full strength.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tam,&rdquo; yelled Billy, as he flung himself into his quarters,
  &ldquo;there&rsquo;s going to be a real dog fight&mdash;why, what&rsquo;s the
  matter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam was standing by the window, his face drawn and haggard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s another letter, Billy,&rdquo; he said huskily; &ldquo;ye
  can see it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy took the half sheet of note-paper.</p>

  <p>There were only a few lines written in pencil:</p>

  <p class="letter">God bless you, my boy, and help you to bear whatever trial
  He sends you. I am happy in a sad way, believing whatever is, is best.
  &mdash; V.</p><br>

  <p>Billy handed the letter back without comment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;ve asked for leave an&rsquo; A&rsquo;ll be leavin&rsquo;
  to-morrow forenoon,&rdquo; said Tam, as he folded the paper and put it in his
  breast pocket.</p>

  <p>Billy had no words. His heart was aching for his comrade and he felt
  horribly inadequate and deficient.</p>

  <p>They walked across the flying-ground in silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So long, Tam,&rdquo; said Billy as he came to his machine, and Tam
  gripped his hand and passed on.</p>

  <p>The fighting scouts went up one by one and maneuvered for formation. Soon
  they were heading for the northeast to avenge their dead. The artillery
  spotters saw them sail majestically to their goal, a grim and beautiful
  spectacle.</p>

  <p>They were in action between Roulers and Lille&mdash;a short savage scrap
  with a flight of six German battle-planes&mdash;and there was a mighty
  rocketing and looping. The air pulsed with the incessant splutter of
  machine-gun fire. Eight machines fell blazing to the earth and the squadrons
  reformed and continued eastward, for they had annihilated their enemies.</p>

  <p>Tam swung his machine into position, saw Billy three hundred yards away on
  his right rear and waved his hand. Nothing happened until Blackie signaled
  &ldquo;Return.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They were nearing Lille when the reinforced Archie barrage split them. Tam
  led his flight to the right, following the course of the Lys. It was above
  the ruins of Armentières that the Infant struck. Six enemy machines drove
  toward the flight and Tam, observing the fan-shaped formation and the central
  chaser at a lower level, knew that this was the opportunity he sought.</p>

  <p>He came down with one wing up to blind his adversary and brought his gun
  into action. The Infant came round on a quick turn and let go a burst at the
  higher machine. Tam stalled the scout and fell back vertically, with his
  undercarriage exposed to his enemy, who again swooped round, this time in a
  wider circle, in the hope of reaching a vulnerable place.</p>

  <p>Tam thought he had his man. Down went his nose and straight he drove to
  the enemy&rsquo;s flank. The maneuver which followed was one of lightning
  swiftness. The Infant stalled, but in stalling came round so that the belly
  of his big machine faced the onrush&mdash;then through the floor of the
  nacelle he fired two deadly bursts.</p>

  <p>Tam was unhurt, but his controls were gone and he was spinning for a fall.
  Like a flash the Infant zoomed up to give the death blow. And at that moment
  came Billy Best, a roaring rocket of spurting flame. The Infant banked too
  late. Billy saw a hand go up in involuntary protest, and the big chaser
  fell.</p>

  <p>Tam was half-way to earth by now, but working feverishly to right his
  elevator. He was still working when his Spad pancaked and crashed on all
  fours, flinging him into a plowed field.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hurt?&rdquo; Billy was down and supporting him. &ldquo;Gee, Tam, I
  thought you&rsquo;d borrowed your last cigar!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam relieved his face of a coating of Flanders and shook his head.
  &ldquo;Did ye get him?&rdquo; he asked shakily.</p>

  <p>Billy pointed. The wreckage of an airplane lay in the next field&mdash;and
  as they made their way across the plow, half a dozen soldiers were lifting
  from the débris its tiny pilot.</p>

  <p>Pathetically small he looked, a mere wisp of a boy with matted golden hair
  that cascaded over his forehead.</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes and smiled up at the two.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hard luck&mdash;yes,&rdquo; he whispered in English, &ldquo;Can I
  drink?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Billy knelt by his side and lifted his shoulders from the ground and put
  the nozle of a water-bottle to his lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p><a id="picNNN"
     name="picNNN"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <p>It was ten minutes past one and they told him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you please tell me who you are&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;Tam and
  Best, that is the American who used to ram machines; you will carry a message
  over the lines to the Roulers aerodrome, please. Also will you write a
  message for my&mdash;mother&mdash;You are very kind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes drowsily.</p>

  <p>The blood patch was spreading across his gray tunic and Tam knew the end
  was near.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell her I was very happy&mdash;yes? I am young&mdash;but I have
  lived.&rdquo;</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1305041h-images/TFS-25.jpg"

  <p>His smile was the smile of a child; the powder-grimed hand that lay on his
  breast was as delicate as a woman&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bismarckstrasse 97,&rdquo; he murmured and then, as though in his
  delirium he recalled the nickname the English had given him, &ldquo;Speak,
  Lord, for Thy servant heareth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And so saying he died.</p>

  <p>They saw the body put on an ambulance before the car came to carry them
  home and neither spoke until the aerodrome was in sight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; said Tam solemnly, &ldquo;yon was a verra guid
  boy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; said Billy, chewing vigorously and looking straight
  ahead.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awfu&rsquo; waste, this war,&rdquo; said Tam.</p>

  <p>Billy turned and looked at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I tell you how I figure it out, Tam,&rdquo; he said a little
  incoherently, &ldquo;something better is going to grow in the place of all
  the good things the war has burnt. It&rsquo;s a weeding-out,
  Tam&mdash;that&rsquo;s how I figure it. I guess that for every soul that goes
  out to God there&rsquo;s another soul blooming&mdash;this sounds slush and I
  wouldn&rsquo;t say it to anybody but you. These fellows who die don&rsquo;t
  really die&mdash;they just fade aside and make way for the men and women who
  will come along the path they died to open up. Do you see,
  Tam&mdash;that&rsquo;s how I figure it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam gripped the boy&rsquo;s arm in his and squeezed it tight.</p>

  <p>The car drove straight to the headquarter office and Blackie bounded out
  to meet them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank God you&rsquo;re back!&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>Now it was not usual for Blackie to express his thanks publicly for his
  blessings, and Tam looked at him with interest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Blackie and handed the scout a field-telegraph
  form.</p>

  <p>It was addressed to Tam and read:</p>

  <p class="telegram">WE HAVE A DARLING BOY, TAM&mdash;I AM SPLENDIDLY WELL.
  WHAT SHALL WE CALL HIM? VERA.</p><br>

  <p>Tam turned his head and looked back down the long white road. An ambulance
  was coming briskly toward the hospital which lay beyond the aerodrome and he
  recognized it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will call him Samuel,&rdquo; he said, and then the old bubbling
  spirit which was peculiarly his, broke through, &ldquo;after Uncle
  Sam,&rdquo; he added.</p>
