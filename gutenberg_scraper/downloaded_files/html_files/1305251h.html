  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1"></a>I. &mdash; A CHANGE OF PLAN</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was when an excited and vengeful client demanded what the
  so-and-so and such a thing Mr. Evans meant by sending out three selections
  for one race, that the educated man laid down his system of ethics.</p>

  <p>"Tippin'," he said, "is ta'tics. You start out to do one thing an' do
  another. Bettin's a battle. You got to change your plans the same as the
  celebrated Napoleon Bonaparte, him that was killed in the Battle of
  Waterloo."</p>

  <p>This philosophy he impressed upon a Miss Casey, with disastrous effects.
  As to Miss Casey...</p>

  <p>To sit beside a beautiful lady in the pit of the Lyceum is indeed a
  privilege. To feel her small hand steal into yours in the excitement and
  emotion occasioned by Miss Frederick's acting, is thrilling. Educated Evans
  had both these experiences. The lady was young. Her face was as fresh and as
  sweet as a pansy. She had red lips and large grey eyes... presently to be
  blinded with hot tears at the pitiable plight of Madame X.</p>

  <p>Evans returned the grip of her hand and reeled.</p>

  <p>"Whatever will you think of me?" she asked penitently as they came out of
  the theatre.</p>

  <p>"My opinion of you," said Mr. Evans passionately, "is the same as the
  well-known Henry the Eighth had for the far-famed Joan of Arc."</p>

  <p>"Oh, go on!" said the delighted Miss Casey. They went to a famous corner
  shop café and Evans blew a dollar on coffee and doughnuts and a box of
  chocolate tied up with blue ribbon &mdash;which was Miss Casey's favourite
  colour.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans agreed to meet her in Hyde Park the following evening, and went
  home walking on air.</p>

  <p>A week later Mr. Challoner ("The Miller" to the cognoscenti of Camden
  Town) called on the educated man. And the real reason for his call was an
  article in a certain weekly publication. The article was entitled "Fortunes
  from Tipping," and the paragraph ran:</p>

  <p>"Another turf prophet who has amassed wealth is Mr. Evans, the well-known
  racing man of Camden Town. Although Mr. Evans lives in unostentatious
  surroundings, it is no secret that his fortune runs into five figures."</p>

  <p>"Did you supply that information?" asked The Miller sternly.</p>

  <p>"It's publicity or press work," murmured Evans. "I had a chat with the
  reporter&mdash;met him up West &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Five figures!" said The Miller, shocked.</p>

  <p>"Ten pun' nine an' eleven," said Evans calmly. "Write that down an' if it
  ain't five figures nothin' is."</p>

  <p>He had been putting the finishing touch to a neat little sign on the
  door&mdash;an oblong of wood on which was painted the new house title.</p>

  <p>No directory of Camden Town would reveal the whereabouts of "Priory Park"
  but for the fact that on all circulars to clients, old and new, Mr. Evans
  added more concisely, "Bayham Mews, N.W."</p>

  <p>"You've got a nerve," said The Miller with that reluctant admiration he
  offered to the successful criminal. "So far as I can remember, your tip was
  Asterus."</p>

  <p>Educated Evans closed his eyes, a sure sign of offended dignity, and began
  to search the one drawer of an article which served as desk, counter,
  dressing-table, stand for duplicator, and occasionally seat. From the litter
  the drawer contained he produced a hectographed sheet.</p>

  <p>"Read," he said simply.</p>

  <p>Detective Inspector Challoner read.</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">"EDUCATED EVANS!<br>
  The World's Chief Turf Adviser<br>
  (Under Royal Patronage)<br>
  To all clients I advise a good bet on ASTERUS***</p>

  <p class="quote">At the same time I am warned by my correspondents that
  Weissdorn is greatly fancied and that King of Clubs will be on the premises.
  At the same time what beats Melon will win and Priory Park will run
  forward."</p><br>

  <p>"He ran forward," said Mr. Evans with even greater simplicity.</p>

  <p>"Most horses do," said The Miller, "unless they're clothes horses."</p>

  <p>"I also give Sprig&mdash;what a double!"</p>

  <p>"Sprig? You lie in your boots!" said the indignant Miller. "You said that
  the Prince of Wales had given you Thrown In!"</p>

  <p>Evans shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Sprig," he said. "I've got documents to prove that me Ten pun' Special to
  all and sundried was Sprig&mdash;fear nothing."</p>

  <p>The Miller did not argue. Mr. Evans' Ten Pound Special was his favourite
  myth. Like Mrs. Harris, there was no such thing.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time Mr. Evans had announced his intention of sending out such
  a startling service, and had offered it for a beggarly quid a nod, but nobody
  coughed up and the service fell into disuse. For why, argued the regulars who
  followed Educated Evans to their ruin, pay a Bradbury for a ten pun' special
  when you could get his five pound guarantee wire for a dollar&mdash;and that
  on the nod?</p>

  <p>"Them Lubeses is givin' me trouble, Mr. Challoner," said Evans, shaking
  his head sadly. "I've done me best to educate the woman but she's like the
  far-famed horse that could be led to the slaughter but you couldn't make him
  think. Never since the days of Mary Queen of Scotch&mdash;her that invented
  the well-known Johnny Walker&mdash;has there been a lady like Mrs.
  Lube&mdash;an' when I call her a lady I expect to be struck down for
  perjury."</p>

  <p>The Miller lingered on the first step of the ladder by which Mr. Evans
  reached Priory Park.</p>

  <p>"It's malice an' libel this time&mdash;an' mind you, Mr. Challoner, I
  haven't said a word about her new lodger&mdash;but she's takin' the name of a
  young lady in vain&mdash;as good a young lady as ever drew the breath of
  life!"</p>

  <p>The Miller came back to the room.</p>

  <p>"You interest me strangely," he said. "Who is the unfortunate female
  honoured by your attentions at the moment?"</p>

  <p>The face of Mr. Evans went pink; his manner grew haughty, almost cold.</p>

  <p>"She's in business down the West End an' it's purely planetic."</p>

  <p>"What-ic?" asked the puzzled inspector, and then: "Oh&mdash;you mean
  platonic?"</p>

  <p>"It's spelt both ways," said Evans, unmoved. "The Germans call it one
  thing and the French another. The whole proceedings are accordin' to what
  you've been brought up to. I call it planetic."</p>

  <p>The Miller did not dispute this shameless change of pronunciation but
  pursued his inquiries.</p>

  <p>"I am anxious to know," he said, "because my experience is that women only
  get hold of you to twist you&mdash;what is she after?"</p>

  <p>Evans smiled.</p>

  <p>"We got an infinity for one another," he said. "She's in lingery."</p>

  <p>"Let us be delicate," said Mr. Challoner.</p>

  <p>"I mean she's in a lingery department of Snodds and Richersens, the
  well-known high-class ladies' underwear and knick-knack shop&mdash;see
  advertisements. I met her the day I brought off All Green&mdash;fear
  nothin'&mdash;what a beauty! In fact we was seein' the well- known Miss
  Palling Frederickson, the far-famed scream actress at the Lyceum. I lent her
  a pocket-handkerchief to wipe away her tears."</p>

  <p>"You lent Miss Frederick&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;Her. Miss Casey. She's Irish on her father's side, but her
  mother's quite a lady. Them Lubeses see me with her at the cinema and put it
  around I was adoptin' her. An' I've had anomalous letters callin' me body
  snatcher."</p>

  <p>"From which I gather that she is young," said The Miller.</p>

  <p>"Twenty come the 19th of April," said Mr. Evans. "And what an education!
  She knows Romeo and Julia, Switzerland, where all the well-known winter
  sports go to, hist'ry grammar an' she can knit ties."</p>

  <p>"Has she got medals for these accomplishments?" asked the sarcastic police
  officer.</p>

  <p>"Cups," said Evans, and added "She can play the pianner with two
  fingers."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans could afford a little light recreation. Since the five-figure
  episode he had struck a vein of fortune such as comes to few tipsters.</p>

  <p>He had not only tipped three winners off the reel, but he had, with
  unexampled recklessness or courage, backed them. As Mr. Issyheim said when he
  reluctantly counted out note after note into the trembling hands of the
  world's supreme prophet and turf adviser, all the miracles were going against
  the book.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans had a new suit&mdash;or practically so. It was, in hue,
  violently blue, the trousers were slightly long in the leg, even when
  painfully braced, but the general effect was distinctly classy. A new white
  bowler hat and a necktie usually sacred to the officers of the 10th Hussars
  completed the pleasing picture when, on a bright spring morning, Mr. Evans
  journeyed by 'bus to Paddington Station.</p>

  <p>A neat little figure awaited him in the booking-hall. Awaited? Nay, came
  running towards him.</p>

  <p>"I've bought the tickets!" she said excitedly. "Oh, Mr. Evans, I've got so
  much to tell you!"</p>

  <p>He winced at the sight of the briefs&mdash;they were first- class; but her
  next words reassured him.</p>

  <p>"I insist upon paying for the tickets, Mr. Evans&mdash;I'm rich!"</p>

  <p>He smiled tolerantly. Nothing made Mr. Evans smile so tolerantly as
  somebody else paying.</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't give me special tickets," she said. "I told them you were a
  member of the Jockey Club&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In a sense," said Evans hastily, as he hurried her to the platform. "It's
  not generally known. I do a lot of secret service work for the old
  club&mdash;that's why I usually go into the silver ring. Me an' Lonsdale's
  like brothers&mdash;good mornin', me lord!"</p>

  <p>He lifted his hat graciously to a hurrying race-goer. The hurrying
  race-goer nodded and said "Hullo, face!" and passed on.</p>

  <p>"Lord Lashells, the far-famed husband of Princess What's- her-name,"
  explained Evans casually.</p>

  <p>They had a carriage to themselves. The Miller, walking along the platform,
  paused at the door but thought better of it.</p>

  <p>"Now!" said Elsie .Casey as the train started. "What do you think of
  this?"</p>

  <p>She produced from her bag a long envelope. It had been heavily sealed in
  wax. Pulling out a letter, she handed it triumphantly to Evans. The
  letter-head ran:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"><tt>"John Dougherty, Solicitors, Ballyriggan, Co.
  Wexford."</tt></p>

  <p class="quote"><tt>"DEAR MISS CASEY,&mdash;We have had a communication from
  Heinz and Heinz, Attorneys, 175 Fifth Avenue, New York, of which we hasten to
  apprise you. By the will of your uncle John Donovan Casey (deceased) the sum
  of $100,000 and the residue of his estate (proved at $1,757,000) is
  bequeathed to you..."</tt></p><br>

  <p>Evans gasped and the lines swam before his eyes. In his agitation he held
  her hand.</p>

  <p class="quote"><tt>...absolutely. The attorneys inform me that it will be
  necessary that you should go to New York at once. As I know you are in
  possession of the necessary funds, it is not necessary to offer you an
  advance on account of expenses. Our Mr. Michael Dougherty will join you at
  Queenstown."</tt></p><br>

  <p>"Well, well, well!" said Evans. But apparently it was not well.</p>

  <p>"You see, Mr. Evans, I've been rather a fool&mdash;I didn't want my people
  at Ballyriggan to know that I was a shop girl, and so I&mdash;well, I
  swanked. You'll never understand that."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans understood perfectly.</p>

  <p>"You got your position to keep up," he said, "the same as me. Everybody's
  swankers. Take Pharer's daughter, her that said she found the well-known
  Moses in the bulrushes, take Queen Elizabeth, the far-famed verging queen,
  take B&mdash;Mary, her that done in her little nephews in the Tower... ."</p>

  <p>He talked all the time, and his busy brain was working overtime. He saw
  the fulfilment of his ambitions. He would buy Swan and Edgar's and put up a
  twenty storey building with Educated Evans picked out in black marble. He'd
  have a grand dinner room and invite the trainers, who, under the influence of
  generous wines, would put him on to the goods. His advertisements would cover
  front pages.</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">EVENTUALLY&mdash;WHY NOT NOW?<br>
  EDUCATED EVANS<br>

  (same address for thirty years)<br>
  Our £50 Special runs at Windsor.<br>
  (Cross all cheques "Bank of England")<br>

  (Enough Said).</p><br>

  <p>In this exalted mood came Mr. Evans to Newbury.</p>

  <p>"Don't waste your money," said the young lady anxiously.</p>

  <p>But nothing would hold Mr. Evans.</p>

  <p>"I got a horse in the first race that can't lose unless the stewards are
  cuttin' it up. I got him from the boy that does him. He's been tried better
  than Pri'ry Park&mdash;an' there's one in the three o'clock that could fall
  down, get up an' then win. I got him from me man at Lambourn. I got agents
  everywhere."</p>

  <p>"Don't lose your money,' warned Miss Casey....</p>

  <p>£80 to £20 the first winner, 100-15 the third, 200-25 the fourth.</p>

  <p>Returning by train, there was little opportunity for confidences. At the
  little restaurant near King's Cross Mr. Evans bought a bottle of wine and
  they talked. From this man of the world she had much advice.</p>

  <p>"Don't be puttin' your money in banks," he said. "Hand it over to some
  educated person of experience. Look how banks fail..."</p>

  <p>He explained his own methods of securing his wealth; showed her the pocket
  inside his waistcoat.</p>

  <p>"Now about this fortune of yourn, Miss Casey. I can let you have the money
  to get to America&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't dream of it!" she said instantly, and the little nagging worry
  that had gnawed at Evans' heart all day vanished. "I've got enough and more
  than enough&mdash;but you are a darling."</p>

  <p>Evans closed his eyes and breathed through his nose. Nobody had called him
  a darling for years, though Mrs. Lube had once addressed him as "a pretty
  beauty." Probably she did not mean it.</p>

  <p>"I should so love to see your office," she said suddenly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans coughed.</p>

  <p>"It's not much to look at," he admitted, "but if you go puttin' up
  skyscrapers you only attract a lot of undesirables, as the saying goes. They
  just call in for a drink an' that's where your profit goes."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he allowed himself to be persuaded.</p>

  <p>"What a dear little room!" She was bright-eyed and ecstatic. "I suppose
  you keep your race-horses in the stables downstairs?"</p>

  <p>In the stables downstairs was a Ford van, the property of a provision
  merchant, but Mr. Evans did not think it necessary to explain this.</p>

  <p>They sat together, he smoking one of her scented cigarettes, and they
  discussed the future.</p>

  <p>"I'm rather young to marry," she said, "but I should feel safe with you,
  Algernon. And having all this money..."</p>

  <p>"Qui' ri'," said Mr. Evans thickly.</p>

  <p>Two days later The Miller, strolling up West and entirely out of his own
  division, was called upon to assist two policemen in the arrest of a certain
  Mr. Albert Ugger, on a charge of working the confidence trick on an
  unsuspecting American. Mr. Ugger was ferociously intoxicated, but under the
  beneficent influence of The Miller, whom he recognised, he went quietly.</p>

  <p>"Wimmin's ruined me, Miller," he said as they marched him to Vine Street.
  "I got a mug taped up Camden Town way&mdash;a feller called Evans. He's got
  lashin's of money accordin' to the papers...."</p>

  <p>The Miller was a fascinated audience.</p>

  <p>"... So we put Polly Agathy on to him&mdash;she's twenty- eight but looks
  a kid... and what do you think she done on us? Gave him a doped fag and
  skipped out with four hundred quid that she took from his pouch. Is that
  right &mdash;I ask yer?"</p>

  <p>The Miller began to understand why for the past two days no selections had
  been flowing from the anguished tenant of Priory Park.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2"></a>II. &mdash; MR. EVANS DOES A BIT OF GAS WORK</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. SINITER was wider than Broad Street. He was very rich
  and he trusted nobody, least of all jockeys. But he thought he could trust
  Lem Dooby, one of the smartest lads that ever left Australia for the good of
  the English turf. That a jockey could not trust him will be made clear.</p>

  <p>Lem had rather a pretty wife. Saul Siniter had a soft place in his heart
  for beauty, married or unmarried; and Lem's wife had a weakness for good
  dinners, theatre parties, and those expensive but inconspicuous articles of
  jewellery that a very rich bookmaker could, with propriety, send her on her
  birthday.</p>

  <p>One day, when Lem was riding in the North, Mrs. Lem and Saul dined
  magnificently, danced till three o'clock in the morning, at which hour Saul
  saw her home.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you the truth, Saul," said Margarita, which was her name: "I'm
  rather worried about Lem. He's one of those quiet people who say nothing and
  think a lot; and if he should hear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't worry about Lem," scoffed Mr. Siniter, who was a very tall,
  handsome man with the manners of a duke&mdash;such dukes as have
  manners&mdash;"Unless you go talking, Lem will know nothing. Anyway, I'll
  write to him tomorrow, and tell him I took you out to dinner, so there's no
  secret about it."</p>

  <p>Which was very true. There was no secret at all about the dinner part of
  the evening or even the dancing part.</p>

  <p>Mr. Siniter, for all his bulk and his strength and his notorious <i>savoir
  faire</i>, was a moral coward, of the type to whom worry and suspicion were
  more potent poisons than strychnine and arsenic. For the moment, however, he
  saw no cause to worry; he had a horse that was saved for one of the big
  handicaps, and which he had backed at ridiculous odds; he had a certain
  winner in Hot Feet when the moment arrived to let his head loose; and he
  could contemplate the future with equanimity.</p>

  <p>Before Hot Feet ran at Hurst he had a little conversation with Lem Dooby,
  who was a very nice little man without vice or temperament.</p>

  <p>"Lem," he said, "I don't want you to win this race... yes, I know they'll
  make him favourite, but seven to four is no good to me. I've told everybody
  to back him and the next time we'll get a good price. You'd better get caught
  flat-footed at the start, and the further you're left the better I shall be
  pleased."</p>

  <p>Lem nodded.</p>

  <p>But he was a man who had many friends, in all circles of society; and as
  he was going into the ring he saw a nobleman for whom he had ridden and who
  he knew was in that select circle which supplies the stewards of meetings all
  over the country.</p>

  <p>"I want to talk to you, Dooby," he said, and led the jockey aside. "You
  must tell nobody, not your best friend, what I'm telling you, but there's
  been a lot of talk about the way Siniter 'rubs out,' and they're watching
  your running to-day very carefully. In fact, one of the stewards will be down
  at the elbow to see the start. You can make any excuse you like to
  Siniter&mdash;and I know I can trust you not to tell him the truth&mdash;but
  I don't want to see you stood down."</p>

  <p>Lem, who was a wise lad, touched his cap and went into the
  saddling-ring.</p>

  <p>The story of Hot Feet's possibilities was already public property in
  Camden Town.</p>

  <p class="first">The Miller met Mr. Evans at the corner of Bayham Street.</p>

  <p>"One of these days," he said savagely, "you're going to get me hung; and
  if you don't get me, you'll get yourself hung. What the devil do you mean by
  calling up the police station and telling the sergeant that you had something
  hot and extra for me?"</p>

  <p>Evans shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You've been a good friend of mine, Mr. Challoner," he said, "and I wasn't
  going to let you out of this coop. I got it this, mornin' from a feller that
  does a lot of betting at the club, an' I promised him I. wouldn't tell a
  soul."</p>

  <p>"And you sent it out to your forty-three thousand clients, I presume?"
  said The Miller.</p>

  <p>"Five hundred an' seventy-four," confessed Evans, in a modest vein. "I've
  been sendin' a army of messengers all over Camden Town puttin' them on to Hot
  Feet."</p>

  <p>"A bookmaker's horse," said The Miller coldly. "It's the sort of stumer
  that bookmakers put around. Hot Feet! Cold Feet would be a better name for
  him!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans smiled cryptically.</p>

  <p>"He's been tried forty-one pounds&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>The Miller silenced him with a look.</p>

  <p>Apparently the legend that Hot Feet was a stumer, and that Mr. Evans was
  the misguided, perhaps the all too willing, victim of a penciller's
  machinations, was for some extraordinary reason general throughout Camden
  Town. When Mr. Evans, took the air at midday in the High Street he was
  accosted every few yards by sceptical clients.</p>

  <p>"What's this Hot Feet you've sent me, Evans? Siniter's horse! I'm
  surprised at you sendin' a wire like that. He was beat a short head at Hurst
  and he'll be rubbin' out to-day."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans closed his eyes and looked pained.</p>

  <p>A few yards on he met Mr. Harriboy, the far-famed fishmonger and
  poulterer.</p>

  <p>"I've got your message, Mr. Evans, but I can't see Hot Feet winning. He's
  a bookmaker's horse, and everybody knows he'll be rubbing out, to- day."</p>

  <p>Now "rubbing out," as the initiated know, is the art of discouraging
  backers from putting their money on horses that seem to have an outstanding
  chance. And this art is very widely practised. To-day you are a short head
  behind a good winner; next week your horse starts at 6-4 and finishes a bad
  fourth; and this may happen on his next outing, until newspaper tipsters and
  wily punters grow weary of supporting this erratic animal; and then he pops
  up at a price remunerative to all concerned. And Mr. Siniter was one of the
  best-known "rubbers out" of form.</p>

  <p>"I can only tell you," said Mr. Evans patiently, "that he's On the Job. If
  there's any man in Camden Town who can teach me my business, let him come
  forward or for ever hold his speech. I'll allow him ten points for education
  an' then beat him. I'm like the far-famed salamander, I've got eyes in the
  back of me head&mdash;I've got to, Mr. Harriboy, to live."</p>

  <p>Mr. Harriboy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm not backing your horse to-day, Evans," he said definitely.</p>

  <p>And others had formed a conclusion as definite; and when, that afternoon,
  Hot Feet won at 7-1, there were sore hearts in Camden Town.</p>

  <p>"It's Evans' fault," said Mr. Harriboy to a disgruntled friend. "If he'd
  only told us what he knew, instead of chucking his weight about up and down
  High Street, I'd have been on that horse."</p>

  <p>After the race Lem got down to meet his enraged owner.</p>

  <p>"What the hell do you mean by winning?" hissed Siniter. "Didn't I tell you
  that I'd not backed the horse? Didn't I ask you to start flat-footed?"</p>

  <p>"I was left, but I couldn't hold him in," said Lem, and for two pins would
  have told him the strength of the position, but loyalty to his aristocratic
  friend kept him silent.</p>

  <p>Mr. Siniter went away from the course a very thoughtful man; and two days
  later, when he met Margarita, expressed his suspicion.</p>

  <p>"Lem's got something at the back of his mind. I don't think you and I had
  better be seen out together so much. I'll have to find another jockey."</p>

  <p>Now Margarita was not a nice woman, but she had a curious sense of
  loyalty.</p>

  <p>"You'll do nothing of the kind," she said. "Lem never did a crooked thing
  in his life." Mr. Siniter grew purple.</p>

  <p>"He's not going to ride Blue Tick!" he stormed. "I've backed him to win me
  three thousand and I'm taking no risks."</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"You don't know what risks you'll be taking if you put down Lem," she said
  significantly.</p>

  <p>He very wisely did not ask questions. And later that day it came to his
  ears that one Educated Evans had sent Hot Feet to 49,732 clients, of which
  five had backed the horse and fifteen hadn't.</p>

  <p>Mr. Siniter trusted no detective. He himself went in search of Educated
  Evans and found him engaged in the preparation of his morning advice.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to intrude on you, mister," said the temporarily genial
  Siniter.</p>

  <p>He looked round the apartment. It did not seem the kind of place from
  which 49,732 letters were likely to be addressed, but you never know what
  tipsters can do at a push.</p>

  <p>"I've come to thank you for your tip on Hot Feet," said Mr. Siniter, and
  put a five-pound note on the table. "You sent it to a friend of mine, but I
  backed it. Now if you ever have any tips from this stable&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have 'em every day," said Mr. Evans with a quiet smile. "There's
  nothin' that twistin' Siniter does that I don't know."</p>

  <p>Siniter swallowed something.</p>

  <p>"You knew that Hot Feet was going to win?" he said, maintaining his calm
  with difficulty.</p>

  <p>Evans nodded.</p>

  <p>"Information v. gaswork," he said. "I got a boy in the stable, and
  Dooby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;you know Dooby, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Evans smiled again.</p>

  <p>"Me an' him's like brothers," he said. "I met him at the Jockey Club in
  Park Lane. He reminds me of the celebrated Fred Archer who rode the far-famed
  Eclipse when it won at San-down Park in 1795&mdash;I don't know whether it
  was the fourth or fifth of May.''</p>

  <p>"You know a lot about Mr. Siniter's horses?" Educated Evans was
  amused.</p>

  <p>"Everything," he said. "Take Blue. Tick&mdash;him they lay 7-4 about in
  the Epsom Handicap&mdash;not a yard!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Siniter heard and perspired.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;who told you?" he demanded, trying to smother his wrath.</p>

  <p>"Information," murmured Evans. "That race is a squinch for
  Dewflower&mdash;tried two stone better than Lopear an' walked it!"</p>

  <p>When Mr. Siniter got home he summoned Lem by 'phone.</p>

  <p>"Dooby, I'm putting up another jockey on Blue Tick. I don't think you
  understand the horse, old man."</p>

  <p>Dooby understood. He was one of those little men who were treacherous to
  others and never imagined he would be suspected of treachery.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he said. "Now who shall we put up? What about Jim Gold?"</p>

  <p>Now the name of Jim Gold had also occurred to Mr. Siniter, but the mere
  fact that Dooby suggested it was quite sufficient to put him off.</p>

  <p>"No, I can't have Jim: he wouldn't ride one side of the horse," he said.
  "I don't mind any other jockey&mdash;bar Slick Markey."</p>

  <p>Here again Lem understood. Slick Markey was as crooked as a flash of
  lightning. Even jockeys, who never give one another away, admitted that Slick
  was mustard. He was one of those clever jockeys who got twenty-five mounts a
  year and was popularly supposed to be in everybody's pocket but his own.</p>

  <p>"No, I wouldn't advise you to take Slick&mdash;he can't help thieving any
  more than I can help scratching my head. What about Tommy Lutter?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Siniter hesitated. It had been on the tip of his tongue to mention the
  same jockey.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "he doesn't understand the horse either. I don't care who
  rides him, but the only thing I bar is Slick."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," murmured the sympathetic Mr. Dooby.</p>

  <p>He went away without having discovered a solution to the pressing problem.
  By midnight Mr. Siniter had worked himself into a condition of nervous
  prostration, and at that hour he called up some one who was nearly a
  friend.</p>

  <p>"I want a jockey to ride my horse Blue Tick," he said. "I don't think
  he'll win, but he's a curious horse to ride and I'd like to have the best man
  available."</p>

  <p>His friend, who was also an owner, thought for some time.</p>

  <p>"Isn't Dooby riding&mdash;no? Well, what about Joe Ginnett? He hasn't a
  mount. Funnily enough, I saw him to-night in Camden Town&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, did you?" said Mr. Siniter loudly. "Well, he won't do! Can you
  suggest anybody else?"</p>

  <p>After a long pause.</p>

  <p>"I don't know... of course you can't have Slick: he's impossible. If he
  knew you'd backed the horse he'd stop it, and if you hadn't backed it he'd
  win. And he's in the pocket of... " He libelled half a dozen perfectly
  respectable but eminent pencillers of Tattersalls. "The only man I can
  suggest is Callison. He's a friend of Dooby's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He won't do either," said Mr. Siniter promptly. "Sorry to bother you, old
  man&mdash;I'll think it out."</p>

  <p>"Anyway, don't take Slick," came the final warning.</p>

  <p>Mr. Siniter, in spite of his agitation, smiled.</p>

  <p>Time was growing short. The next day he made another attempt. One jockey
  after another came up for review&mdash;none could be trusted. At eleven
  o'clock that night he rang up Slick Markey and offered him the mount.</p>

  <p>Secretly, and in an assumed name, he had become one of Mr. Evans'
  subscribers. The morning post brought a communication from that
  genius.</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">EDUCATED EVANS,<br>

  Straight from a reliable source.<br>
  My information is that<br>
  BEGGAR BOY***<br>
  is walking over for the important event as advertised in all leading
  papers.</p><br>

  <p>Mr. Siniter wiped his perspiring brow. Somebody knew more than he; there
  was a conspiracy amongst these jockeys. What a fool he had been to put up
  Slick, the most notorious crook of all!</p>

  <p>To change him now was neither possible nor desirable. There was only one
  thing to do. He sent secret instructions to his commission agents to lay Blue
  Tick, and drove to the course with the full assurance that he had taken the
  only wise course.</p>

  <p>Before the race he interviewed the wizen-faced jockey with the shifty
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I've laid off all my bets on this horse," he said, "so you can handle him
  gently."</p>

  <p>Slick nodded&mdash;he was a man of very few words, and they were mostly
  unprintable.</p>

  <p>There was a big field. Mr. Evans, lounging against the rails, waited with
  a calm air of assurance for his unbeatable gem to materialise.</p>

  <p>He never could read a race, and never learnt to look at any of the horses
  except the one he had backed&mdash;and usually he confounded that with
  another.</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking Blue Tick: he was a grey, and the flamboyant
  colours of Mr. Siniter could not be mistaken nor confounded with anything
  more delicate. They lay in the centre of the field, about third for most of
  the journey. In the last furlong they drew to the front....</p>

  <p>Blue Tick won, hard held, by three lengths.</p>

  <p>"Information v. gasworks," said Evans bitterly. "It almost makes you give
  up trying to find 'em!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Siniter watched the horses come back to the paddock like a man in a
  dream. And it was a pretty bad dream. He saw Dooby, who rode one of the last
  division, slip from his horse and unsaddle, and as the little man passed him
  Mr. Siniter noticed in a vague kind of way that he was beaming.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you won, guv'nor," said the jockey. "I think anybody could have
  won on him. He had us beat from start to finish. I hope you had a good win.
  My missus had eighty pounds on him."</p>

  <p>Mr. Siniter recovered his voice:</p>

  <p>"Who told her to back it?" he asked hollowly.</p>

  <p>"Old Slick Markey, just before he went out," said Lem. "It's given me
  another idea of old Slick&mdash;first time I've known him to do the straight
  thing."</p>

  <h2><a id="story3"
     name="story3"></a>III. &mdash; EDUCATION AND COMBINATIONS</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. EVANS had concluded his ablutions and had hung the towel
  on the bed-rail to dry. The yellow sunlight which slanted through the open
  window proclaimed the coming of spring; the piles of unopened letters that
  covered the table proclaimed the Turn of the Tide.</p>

  <p>Until the small hours of the morning he had been turning the handle of the
  Duplicating Machine that a Child Could Work, and littering the bed was his
  latest <i>pronunciamento</i>.</p>

  <p><a id="picNNN"

  </div><br>

  <p>Mr. Evans picked up a hectographed sheet and read it with satisfaction. He
  had struck a blow at the very heart of his enemies. Seven successive three
  star naps had Old Sam sent forth in his Midnight Special, and each and every
  one of them had gone down the sink.</p>

  <p>He heard footsteps on the stairs, but did not turn round, even when a
  shadow came into the room.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Evans."</p>

  <p>The educated man spun round and his face went pale. Standing in the
  doorway was Mrs. Lube, and in her hand a large bunch of primroses.</p>

  <p>"Many happy returns of the day, Mr. Evans, an' let by-gorns be
  by-gorns."</p>

  <p>Once you knew Mr. Evans' birthday it was well-nigh impossible to forget
  it, for he first saw the light on April 1st in the year&mdash;well, never
  mind about the year.</p>

  <p>"Um&mdash;same to you, Mrs. Lube."</p>

  <p>He took the flowers gingerly, expecting them to explode at any moment.</p>

  <p>"May I come in, Mr. Evans?"</p>

  <p>He indicated a chair and watched her warily, ready to jump at the first
  sign of a poker. But not only was Mrs. Lube unarmed, she was disarming.</p>

  <p>"I daresay you wonder why I come, Mr. Evans," she said. "After all the
  bickerin' an' unpleasantness we've had and what not. But what I say is live
  an' let live, but I've been talking it over with my dear gran'father an' my
  dear husband an' I says 'What's the use of us tryin' to down dear Mr. Evans?'
  I says, 'the only thing to do,' I says, 'is to get him to help us,' I
  says."</p>

  <p>Evans found his voice gruffly.</p>

  <p>"I got nothing to give away," he said.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube swallowed something.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you have, Mr. Evans." She was very earnest, or appeared to be.
  "You've got education. I says to my poor dear gran'father, 'What's the use of
  our goin' on as we're goin' on without education?' "</p>

  <p>Educated Evans coughed and fingered his chin importantly.</p>

  <p>"I says," continued Mrs. Lube, "the only thing is to throw ourselves on
  his mercy an' for me to ask him to educate me."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans coughed again.</p>

  <p>"In a manner of speakin' you're right," he said. "Take biology an'
  science. What's water? In French it's 'O.' In science it's H.3.0., in German
  it's something altogether different. Take the world, which revolves or turns
  on its axle once in every twenty-four hours, thus causin' the stars to shine.
  Take history. The War of the Roses was caused through Lancashire beatin'
  Yorkshire and vicer verser, which is Latin. Which brings us to Julia Caesar,
  the far-famed wife that was always suspicious of her husband owin' to his
  carryin' on with Lewdcreature Burgia the female Crippen of Italy. Where's
  Italy, you ask me? That's geography again and brings us to the question of
  Mussel Enos, the far-famed Fassykist."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube blinked rapidly.</p>

  <p>"My poor brain!" she said disparagingly. "What a headpiece you've got, Mr.
  Evans!"</p>

  <p>"Take botomy, the science of vegetables," said Evans, warming to his
  subject. "By studyin' the ways an' means of flowers we arrive at zoo-ology or
  caterpillars which change into butterflies by metamorphious methods commonly
  called hibernation...."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube stayed two hours and had a grounding in erudition.</p>

  <p>"It's your idea, Elfred," she said to her husband on her return, "and if
  it turns out that I've bin wastin' my time on that old so-and- so, I'll have
  something to say to you!"</p>

  <p>"We've got to do something," said Alfred.</p>

  <p>Detective-Inspector Arbuthnot Challoner was taking what was literally and
  figuratively a constitutional. In other words he was engaged in the
  improvement of his system by the exercise of his limbs and the improvement of
  Camden Town by the employment of his senses.</p>

  <p>He called at the Blue Pig, to the embarrassment of a young married
  gentleman who had left his wife chargeable to the Parish of St. Pancras; he
  looked in at Hookey's Coffee Bar and Good Pull Up for Carmen and found Spicey
  Brown and Cully Parks intent upon dominoes&mdash;they invariably planned
  their busts over a game, and used the pieces to model the house they intended
  to burgle.</p>

  <p>("Say that double-six is the front door," Cully was saying when The Miller
  arrived, "and that four-one is the pantry winder, all we gotter do is to get
  down the area an' the job's as good as done....")</p>

  <p>The pieces were swept into confusion on The Miller's approach, and two
  innocent men greeted him with sycophantic pleasure.</p>

  <p>Mr. Challoner's next call was at a fried-fish shop off the High Street,
  where one who was born Lieverbaum but was now styled Leverbrown carried on a
  small spieling club in the back parlour.</p>

  <p>Comparatively speaking, Camden Town was law-abiding and almost chaste.</p>

  <p>"All the boys have gorn racin', Mr. Challoner," said Lieverbaum, rubbing
  his podgy hands. "It's a blessing this racing, ain't it? Keeps the boys out
  of mischief, yes? An' what with Edjercated Evings doin' so well&mdash;three
  winners right orf the reel&mdash;the man's marvellous. The bookmakers are
  doin' rotten."</p>

  <p>He spoke feelingly, for Mr. Lieverbaum was notoriously an evader of the
  law, being a ready money bookmaker, and had been three times convicted.</p>

  <p>The Miller stopped long enough to warn him against this practice, and
  resumed his stroll. And then, turning past the Nag's Head in the direction of
  Regent's Park, he beheld a sight which left him dazed and gasping. There
  flashed past him one of those handsome limousines which can be hired by the
  mile or by the hour, and wedged on the back seat thereof was Mrs. Lube, a
  white-bearded old gentleman, and Mr. Evans of Myra Gray Mansions.</p>

  <p>The Miller's first thought was that his unfortunate friend had been
  kidnapped, and his hand strayed to his pocket where he kept his whistle. In
  another second the car had vanished in the direction of the park.</p>

  <p>That evening, being off duty, he made a call in Bayham Mews and found Mr.
  Evans pressing his best trousers.</p>

  <p>"Good evenin', inspector&mdash;mind you don't knock over them flowers." He
  hastily saved the jam jar full of primroses and put it on the mantelpiece.
  "They were sent to me by a friend."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Lube?"</p>

  <p>The Miller meant to be ironical. He was staggered when Mr. Evans
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"We're goin' into partnership, me an' Old Sam," he said calmly. "The man's
  got his points, but, as Amelia says&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Who's Amelia?" demanded the baffled detective.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Lube&mdash;we're like brothers and sisters."</p>

  <p>The detective looked at him suspiciously. "What's the idea?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"Education an' combinations," said Evans profoundly.</p>

  <p>"Let us keep the conversation clean," said The Miller.</p>

  <p>And then Evans explained. It was, he said (untruthfully), his own idea. By
  some curious workings of chance, which even The Miller had observed, it fell
  out that luck balanced up and down. When Old Sam's Midnight Special was
  successful, Evans was unsuccessful. When Evans' fortune hit the beam, gloom
  reigned in the house of Lube. Why not therefore conclude a secret
  arrangement? Both parties to work independent one of the other and to pool
  profits. In this way, the misfortune of Old Sam would be relieved by the
  swelling coffers of Educated Evans. On the other hand, when the fickle
  goddess had deserted Evans, his exchequer would be supplied from the
  surpluses which came from his rival.</p>

  <p>"Umph!" said The Miller. "That won't work!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans could afford to smile.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact it's workin'," he said simply. "We've both had a good
  week, but he's had better than me an' sent me four pun' six an' ninepence
  difference."</p>

  <p>It appeared that Mrs. Lube was keeping the books, that Mrs. Lube's cousin
  was acting as accountant, and Mrs. Lube's sister-in-law was preparing the
  balance sheet, and the money was to be kept in Mrs. Lube's bank.</p>

  <p>"It's a hundred to one against you, Evans," said The Miller ominously.
  Evans smiled again.</p>

  <p>If it was not to be registered, the partnership was to be a very
  high-class affair. It was Mr. Evans who suggested the telegraphic address,
  "Evanlube, London," and in his enthusiasm paid the two guineas required by
  the postal authorities. "Not," said Mrs. Lube, "that it makes much
  difference, for all the telegrams we shall ever get." Still, it gave the firm
  an importance when added to Old Sam's flamboyant notehead with a rubber
  stamp.</p>

  <p>The week that followed was a tragic one for the followers of Educated
  Evans. He gave four £5 Specials that failed to finish in the first nine. His
  unbeatable cert for Friday (widely circularised) was a non-runner. On
  Saturday he called at the Lube household confidently, for Old Sam had had a
  wonderful run, including two 100-8 winners.</p>

  <p>There was no accident about this except the fluke of Alfred finding Mr.
  Dewbring, a watcher of horses at Carshott. It happened that the three
  trainers at Carshott were enjoying the fruits of their industry and cunning,
  and sending out winners almost every day.</p>

  <p>Evans knocked at the door with a gay heart and was admitted. Mrs. Lube
  received him in the parlour and her manner was as distinctly cold as Evans'
  was distinctly genial.</p>

  <p>"I've had a temp'ry setback in fortune," he said breezily. "As dear old
  Hamlet said, you can't win all the time."</p>

  <p>He produced from his trousers pocket a very small bundle of Treasury
  notes, mostly, as Mrs. Lube saw with a discriminating eye, green.</p>

  <p>"Two pun' six," he said cheerily, and placed it on the table.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube's lips tightened. With some reluctance she produced her
  books.</p>

  <p>"That's seven pun' five I've got to pay you," she said ungraciously. "What
  with all this money goin' out an' none cumin' in and five mouths to fill, the
  instalment on the pianner due next week, I dunno, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>What she did not know she did not specify.</p>

  <p>"I got something up me sleeve for Tuesday, Amelia," said Evans darkly as
  he pocketed his money. "Something that could fall down, get up an' then win.
  I had it from the boy that does him&mdash;a girl named Jackson who's keepin'
  company&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I dunno, I'm sure," said Mrs. Lube again, and with those cryptic words
  dismissed the partner in her new business.</p>

  <p>On the following Tuesday Mr. Evans started badly. He sent out Bollybill
  "tried 21 lbs. better than Coronach," and Bollybill finished a bad last. On
  the Wednesday he pleaded with all clients new and old to go for Snatcher.
  "This horse" (to quote his own words) "is a Rod in Pickle. He's been brought
  over specially from Ireland for a coop." Snatcher was seventh in a field of
  eight. On the Thursday The Miller met Mr. Evans at the entrance of Bayham
  Mews.</p>

  <p>"I've just headed off a small deputation that was calling upon you. I
  don't know whether I oughtn't to have pinched them for conspiring to
  murder."</p>

  <p>Evans smiled tolerantly.</p>

  <p>"What's one man's meat," he said, "is another man's poison, which is
  French for chickens. My dear old partner Sam has brought home two
  eight-to-one shots. Next week it'll be my turn. Mr. Challoner, I got a horse
  for you on Saturday. He's a stone pinch. I had her from the boy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If I were you," interrupted The Miller gently, "I should lose that
  boy."</p>

  <p>On the Thursday afternoon Mrs. Lube made up her mind. The telegraphic
  address was expunged from the notehead, and a penny postcard sent to the
  local post office informing the official in charge that "Evanlube" might in
  the future indicate Evans, but it did not indicate Lube.</p>

  <p>"Nobody sends us telegrams," explained Amelia to her husband, "except Mr.
  Dewbring, and he puts our full name and address."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" asked Alf.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube smiled unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>On the Friday afternoon she came to Myra Gray Mansions, and there was
  something very determined in her mien.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, Amelia," began Evans. "You're just in time for a little
  bit of education. Take astronomy or the heavens&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We've had enough 'eavens, educated an' uneducated," said Mrs. Lube, "and
  I'll thank you not to call me Amelia. Me husband objects. How have you
  done?"</p>

  <p>Too well she knew how Mr. Evans had "done."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose I've took a couple of pounds," said Evans cheerfully,
  "but luck will turn&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So will worms," said Mrs. Lube. "You don't think me an' my poor dear
  gran'father's going to keep you in idleness an' losin' our connection what
  we've built up through information v. gaswork?"</p>

  <p>"Here, hold hard," said Evans, stung to annoyance by this gross
  plagiarism.</p>

  <p>"You don't suppose,' Mrs. Lube went on, "that we're goin' to put your
  measly two pounds to our fifty day after day an' week after week an' year
  after year an' keep you in the bread of idleness with five mouths to fill an'
  my poor dear gran'father gettin' older every day?"</p>

  <p>"Who ain't?" asked Evans loudly. "That's the evolution of nature, as I've
  told you till I'm sick of telling you. It's due to the subcutaneous tissues
  and bones&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind about bones," said Mrs. Lube, even more loudly. "You'll soon
  be gnawin' them if this goes on."</p>

  <p>She planked a piece of paper on the table. "There's five
  pounds&mdash;that's your share, and the partnership's over. We're not goin'
  to be ruined by educated has-beens and whatnots."</p>

  <p>Evans turned pale with fury.</p>

  <p>"You come to me for education&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"And we got it," said Mrs. Lube. "The partnership's over."</p>

  <p>Evans watched the departure of the lady from the top of the steps, walked
  back with a shrug, and applied himself to the task of composition.</p>

  <p>That night, from information received, there was delivered by hand, or
  posted, to all clients old and new an important statement.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Educated Evans is once more Educated Evans. Partnership
  with Uneducated People Dissolved and Abolished.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Educated Evans, the World's Premier Turf Prophet and
  Adviser to the Nobility (by request) begs to announce that he has taken away
  his valuable advice from the so-called Old Sam (lately assistant and
  messenger boy to the well-known Educated Evans) and now henceforward and
  herewith is on his own. Clients new and old who have received Educated Evans'
  beauties can now have a horse that he's been keeping up his sleeve till he'd
  dropped all his low connections.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">WET WHITE.<br>
  WET WHITE.<br>
  WET WHITE.</p>

  <p class="quote">"All clients new and old are advised to have their limit
  upon this unbeatable gem, especially kept up the sleeve of Educated Evans. No
  connection with any other business, no longer adviser to Old Sam."</p><br>

  <p>Great minds think alike. That evening Mrs. Lube was turning the handle of
  a rotary machine which announced to the world that:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"We have dismissed our assistant tipster, E. Evans, having
  no use for same."</p><br>

  <p>"Do you think," asked Alfred Lube thoughtfully, as they sat at breakfast
  and he read Mr. Evans' flamboyant claim, "do you think he's got anything up
  his sleeve?"</p>

  <p>"His sleeve?" scoffed the infrequent partner of his joys. "He's had
  nothing up his sleeve, not even a shirt!"</p>

  <p>Yet Wet White won; and on the Monday, at a Midland meeting, Too Gladly won
  at 100-6 and was Evans' special three-star help-yourself selection. And on
  the Tuesday Wiggletoe won, and was Mr. Evans' confident and unbeatable gem.
  And on the Wednesday up popped Small Schweppe in a two-year-old seller.
  Popped was hardly the word, since he exploded at the brilliant price of
  20's.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube put on her hat and went out to interview Evans.</p>

  <p>"Fair's fair all the world over, Mr. Evans," was her opening. "Me an' my
  dear gran'father have got the idea that we've been a bit hasty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And then she stopped. On the table was a telegraph envelope addressed to
  "E. Evans, Esq., Myra Gray Mansions, Bayham Mews." And by its side was a
  telegram, but the address was different: it was simply "Evanlube London."
  Slowly there dawned upon the good lady the horrible revelation. She had
  transferred the telegraphic address without realising that she had been
  receiving Evanlube wires all the time! She seized the telegraph form and
  read:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram"
     style="text-align:center">"BLINKEYE CERTAINTY
     TO-MORROW.&mdash;DEWBRING."</p><br>

  <p>"A gentleman at Carshott," said Evans. "He's been sending me winners all
  the week. I don't know why. What was you saying, Mrs. What's-yer- name?"</p>

  <p>But Mrs. What's-yer-name was speechless.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story4"
     name="story4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE OTHER LUBESES</h2>

  <p class="first">EDUCATED EVANS, being by nature gallant and by
  predisposition romantic, imagined, in the purity of his mind and the
  loftiness of his soul, that he might do almost anything that would be
  reprehensible in other men.</p>

  <p>A lesser man might have thought twice before taking Millie Ropes to
  Lingfield. Millie was a little on the notorious side. She had left the bar of
  the "White Cow" with suspicious suddenness. There was a lot of vague talk
  about marked half-crowns. And she had subsequently disappeared from London,
  returning at the end of six months with a very small baby that she said
  belonged to her sister Annie, who had to leave England for Australia. Millie
  Robes was frankly an indiscretion on Evans' part.</p>

  <p>"It's all over Camden Town, is it?" he said defiantly to a well-meaning
  friend. "Well, is it all over Camden Town that I give Orbindos&mdash;fear
  Melon&mdash;nothin' else mentioned? Is it all over Camden Town that I give
  Funny Freak&mdash;100-6 beat a head&mdash;hard lines? Is it all over Camden
  Town that I give Priory Park before the entries come out? I don't take no
  notice of what common people say about us. I'm like the well- known an'
  highly respected King Edward the Professor, who picked up a lady's garter an'
  shoved it round his neck, hence the celebrated sayin' 'Hony swar kwee maly
  pense'."</p>

  <p>But Millie was not the only brick that Mr. Evans dropped. Was he not seen
  at the Hialto Cinema with Mrs. Alf Ibbidino? And was not Lou Ibbidino (her
  husband was in the ice-cream business) a lady about whom the tongue of gossip
  wagged slanderously?</p>

  <p>"She's a Satisfied Client of mine," protested Evans when The Miller
  reproached him. "What was I to do when she asked me out to see the
  pictures?... I <i>know</i> she's Livin' Apart.... I know all about the barman
  at the Green Moon... but, Mr. Challoner, I'm like the famous wife of Julius
  Caesar, the well-known King of Italy, I'm never suspicious."</p>

  <p>Too well was Educated Evans doing for the Lubes to ignore this
  opportunity. Old Sam's Midnight Special announced</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">OLD SAM<br>
  <i>(The Moral Tipster)</i><br>
  83 years old and never got anybody into trouble.<br>
  Patronise the Man who Gave Myra Gray.<br>
  Old Sam gives tips that children can read.<br>
  Don't Support Vice, support Purity.</p><br>

  <p>Evans complained bitterly about this&mdash;his chief complaint being that
  Myra Gray was a figment of Lubean imagination.</p>

  <p>But after a while the reflection upon his character began to get on his
  nerves. People began to stop him in the street and ask him not to speak to
  their wives. A woman who occupied a room in the mews told him he ought to be
  ashamed of himself&mdash;a man of his age. And behind it all was the crude
  propaganda of the Lubeses&mdash;apocryphal stories related to the hushed
  denizens of bars by Alf Lube, scandals proclaimed over the tea table by Mrs.
  Lube. Even Old Sam, that patriarchal man, made insulting references to the
  moral probity of the educated man.</p>

  <p>"You've got to live it down," said The Miller.</p>

  <p>"Live what down?" wailed the agitated Evans. "I done nothing&mdash;me
  character's bein' demobbed by them Lubeses and if I don't take 'em into court
  my name's not Evans!"</p>

  <p>One day business took him to a foreign land&mdash;Camberwell, S.E. He had
  to interview a friend who had settled in this strange country. This friend
  had a wife whose sister was walking out with the brother of a head lad in a
  Wiltshire stable, and the possibility of obtaining direct stable information
  was not to be missed. They had completed their business, and it had been
  arranged that anything the wife's sister told the wife about what her young
  man's brother had told her young man should be communicated by the husband to
  Evans at the earliest possible moment. And after Evans had told his friend to
  ask his wife to tell her sister to ask her young man to tell his brother that
  Evans paid heavily for news, the party was adjourning when he received a very
  staggering piece of information.</p>

  <p>"I wonder, Mr. Evans," said his friend, "whether you know of a job for my
  sister-in-law? She's been offered a place up your way, but she wants a little
  extra work to keep her going. She's as nice a young woman..."</p>

  <p>Evans listened with closed eyes, framing the while a polite regret that he
  could not furnish the necessary employment.</p>

  <p>"I've got meself into too much trouble lately min' to bein' kind to
  wimmin," he said, shaking his head. "There's a certain party in Camden Town
  who's cast more aspiration on my character than the far-famed Lewdcreature
  Burgia, the well-known female Crippen of Italy. But I might hear of
  something&mdash;what's the name of your lady friend?"</p>

  <p>His friend gave it, and the educated man staggered.</p>

  <p>"What?" he said incredulously. "Goo' lor'!"</p>

  <p>His brain worked rapidly.</p>

  <p>"I'll engage her," he said excitedly. "Two pun' ten a week if she'll come
  and do a bit of racing with me."</p>

  <p>"She's highly respectable," warned the friend. "So am I," said Mr.
  Evans.</p>

  <p>Thereafter life ran with greater smoothness at Orbindos Manse&mdash;which,
  despite the ecclesiastical and evangelical character of the title, was the
  one room above a stable in Bayham Mews which was the <i>pied à terre</i> of
  the World's Turf Adviser.</p>

  <p>Prosperity was revealed in the two flower-pots topped with the blazing
  blue of hyacinths, in the gold lettering on the door tablet, in the new green
  and magenta tablecloth.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" said The Miller, stopping in the doorway to survey the
  unexpected grandeur.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans smirked in a self-deprecatory way.</p>

  <p>"I got a young lady who comes in an' does," he said simply.</p>

  <p>"Does what?"</p>

  <p>Evans shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Does for me. I got no time nowadays to go messin' about makin' beds and
  fryin' sausages."</p>

  <p>The Miller turned the straw between his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Attractive?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Evans' shoulders went up and down.</p>

  <p>"I scarcely notice the girl," he said indifferently. "Her name's Mrs.
  Lube&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" The Miller's eyes opened. "Not your hated rival&mdash;and you let
  her come here?"</p>

  <p>"She don't have any truck with Old Sam," said Evans, avoiding the
  visitor's eye. "As dear old B&mdash; Mary said to Cardinal Rishloo, the
  famous French poet, when she had her uncle chopped in four pieces for
  encouragin' Lady Jane Graves, 'Relations are best apart.' "</p>

  <p>The Miller nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"I think you're mad!" he said.</p>

  <p>"I'm quite 'in sansitas,' to use a foreign expression," said Mr. Evans
  calmly. "As a matter of fact she ain't any relation at all. But her name's
  Mrs. Lube and she's partially a widder&mdash;her husband havin' run away with
  another lady. I pay her two ten a week an' she's worth it."</p>

  <p>News travels fast in Camden Town. Mr. Alf Lube, supporting the bar of the
  "Grey Squirrel," heard a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Here, what's that?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"He's goin' about with Mrs. Lube&mdash;that's all I know. He was down at
  Kempton&mdash;or was it Plumpton?&mdash;with her. Harry Gribble, the
  bookmaker, said Evans introduced her in a gentlemanly way an' she took
  seventy-five shillin's to five Cats Eyes an' drew."</p>

  <p>Alf went purple.</p>

  <p>"That's a lie!" he said. "And for tuppence I'd give you a punch on the
  nose."</p>

  <p>His informant laid two pennies on the counter and uttered truculent words.
  Apparently Alf neither saw nor heard. He dashed back to the headquarters of
  Old Sam's Midnight Special.</p>

  <p>"Here!" he demanded wrathfully. "What's all this about you an' Evans?
  Here's me workin' me brains out tryin' to think winners an' you
  gallivantin'..."</p>

  <p>After he had picked himself up and Mrs. Lube had thrown the broken chair
  into the scullery&mdash;she always used a chair as a weapon in her more
  distraught moments,</p>

  <p>"I'll go an' see Evans," she said, and went in search of the bag in which
  she did her shopping. In was the only bag she had in which she could carry a
  poker.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans was not in when she bounced into his room. There was in his
  place a neat little woman in a print dress.</p>

  <p>"Where's that...?" Mrs. Lube described the educated man vividly.</p>

  <p>"Moderate your language," said the calm guardian of Evans' home. "I'm a
  respectable woman an' not used to common talk. What's more, I don't want to
  lose me temper and slosh you one."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube gasped as an idea flashed on her. "What name do you call
  yourself?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Lube," said Mrs. Lube II. "I call myself that because it was me
  husband's."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube I. stood petrified.</p>

  <p>"Your real name... no relation to me?"</p>

  <p>"Gawd forbid!" said Mrs. Lube II.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube staggered down the stairs a broken woman. Half a dozen people
  saw her leave. Half a dozen broadcasters spread the tidings. So it <i>was</i>
  true....</p>

  <p>People who scarcely knew Alf Lube came up to him and gripped his hand
  sympathetically. Perfect strangers offered him beer, and women came to their
  front doors to see him pass, shake their heads sorrowfully and say "Poor
  feller!"</p>

  <p>As to Emma (which was one of her Christian names, the other being Amelia),
  she explained the matter to her husband.</p>

  <p>"Another woman called Mrs. Lube, eh?" he said, with cold politeness. "Oh,
  yes, I dessay...."</p>

  <p>"Go an' see for yourself," hissed his partner. Alf Lube said nothing, but
  looked murderous.</p>

  <p>Detective-Inspector Challoner thought it necessary to warn his friend.</p>

  <p>"Personally," he said, "I have no very strong feelings in the matter. We
  haven't had a good murder in Camden Town for years, and I should know who did
  it, because I happen to have heard that Alf Lube was trying to buy a German
  revolver that Joe Carter brought back from the war."</p>

  <p>Educated Evans turned pale.</p>

  <p>"Is it my fault," he demanded, "that people talk about me an' her? Ain't
  they been talkin' about me for munce and munce, a scandalisin' an'
  deprecatin' me? As the well-known an' celebrated Cleopatra, her that hid
  Moses in the bulrushes, said: 'You can't do nothin' if you can't prove
  nothin'.' "</p>

  <p>"We shall see," said The Miller ominously.</p>

  <p>He left Mr. Evans very thoughtful, though not for long. Mrs. Lube II. was
  a cheery soul, a lady of thirty-five; rather, as The Miller had supposed,
  attractive. She dressed neatly and took an intelligent interest in racing, so
  that Evans was more or less justified in adding to his circulars:</p>

  <p>"Address all communications and other postal orders to E. Evans, Orbindos
  Manse, or to my private secretary, Mrs. Lube."</p>

  <p>He had arranged to take his lady friend to Sandown. If the truth be told,
  Mr. Evans did not find his deception a very irksome one. Mrs. Lube II. was a
  presentable lady, who agreed with almost everything he said.</p>

  <p>On the way to Sandown he explained to her the new move.</p>

  <p>"You be my secretary, Mrs. L.," he said. "I'll give you another ten
  shillin's a week for that."</p>

  <p>She brightened at the prospect; and there was room for improvement, for
  all that morning she had been glum and depressed&mdash;in fact, Mr. Evans had
  the suspicion, when she arrived at the Manse, that she had been crying. She
  had had some bad news, she told him when he questioned her, but she made no
  attempt to inform him of its character.</p>

  <p>"Naturally"&mdash;Mr. Evans pursued the topic as the train sped to
  Esher&mdash;"you haven't got my education. I don't suppose you ever will.
  Take the two seasons, flat an' jumpin'&mdash;they're caused by the world
  going round on its axle or orbit. The farther you get away from the sun the
  colder it gets, which is natural, hence the National Hunt Committee an' the
  so- called sport of gentlemen. Take chemistry, botomy and syntax. Take
  mathematics or decimals. Take algebra, invented by the far-famed Euclid. Take
  hist'ry... ."</p>

  <p>Fortunately the train had reached Esher station before Mrs. L. could take
  anything more than a passing interest in the scenery.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans had come down laden with information, but his star was not in
  the ascendant. There is no doubt that Guggs should have won the first race if
  he had been trying. But he wasn't trying.</p>

  <p>"He ought to have won ten minutes," said Mr. Evans hotly. "I had him from
  a friend of mine whose wife's sister is keeping company&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Only then was he dimly aware of the presence of Mr. Alf Lube. The man was
  watching him evilly. When Evans walked into the paddock Mr. Lube followed,
  muttering incoherently.</p>

  <p>"You're looking pale, Mr. Evans," said Mrs. L.</p>

  <p>Evans smiled a sickly smile.</p>

  <p>"I just remembered a client I didn't send Guggs to. We'll keep him
  anyway!"</p>

  <p>His unbeatable selection in the second race should have won pulling up,
  instead of which he was pulled up before he won.</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut!" said Evans impatiently, as he glared through his glasses at
  the offending horse. "There's a bit of dirty work there."</p>

  <p>He feared dirty work elsewhere; kept an apprehensive eye over his shoulder
  for Mr. Alfred Lube. Never once did he miss his shadow. As Evans was standing
  by the ring marking his card, a hateful voice spoke at his elbow.</p>

  <p>"You'll go on till you go off!" grated Mr. All Lube.</p>

  <p>"I don't want any talk with you, my friend," said Mr. Evans loudly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lube laughed harshly. Later, Evans saw him in the bar, drinking whisky
  feverishly, and suggested to his companion that they should go home by the
  next train. But the fire of racing was in her and on her disappearance into
  the ring to battle with bookmakers, Evans thought it was an excellent
  opportunity to explain the situation to the disgruntled husband of Mrs. Lube
  I.</p>

  <p>He saw him emerge from the bar, met his murderous scowl with a smile, and
  was about to approach him when his arm was caught in a firm grip and he was
  swung round.</p>

  <p>The man who confronted him was six feet in height and terribly broad. He
  had a strong, brutal face and light blue eyes that glinted murder.</p>

  <p>"Here," said the stranger. "I see you talkin' to a lady just
  now&mdash;Mrs. Lube."</p>

  <p>Evans opened his mouth but no sound came.</p>

  <p>"She's my wife," said the giant fiercely. "I admit I done wrong, but a
  lovin' wife ought to take her husband back. When I see her this mornin' she
  wouldn't&mdash;some one's come between us. WHAT IS SHE TO YOU?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans' mouth was dry, as the stranger urgently rocked him to and fro,
  and then inspiration came.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," said Evans, with what dignity he could summon. "I know
  nothing about the lady in question&mdash;she's a mere friend or client. I'm
  Educated Evans, the far-famed Turf Prophet. If you're Mr. Lube then I have
  been mistaken an' I apologise. That's the gent. who calls himself Mr. Lube."
  He pointed at the glowering Alf.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lube II. released his grip.</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;him?... Calls himself Mr. Lube...."</p>

  <p>Evans waited till the battle joined and sped blithely to the pass out
  gate. He did not even turn his head to see the result of the contest, but it
  was a satisfaction to him to see the motor ambulance speeding round the
  course towards Tattersall's.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5"></a>V. &mdash; MR. EVANS PULLS OFF A REAL COOP</h2>

  <p class="first">THE MILLER regarded his unfortunate friend with a stern but
  pitying eye.</p>

  <p>"A tipster is a rogue until he starts backing his own wayward fancies," he
  said, "and then he qualifies for admission to the mug class."</p>

  <p>Evans shifted uneasily under the other's gaze.</p>

  <p>"It was give me by the boy that does him," he pleaded. "This here horse
  was tried twenty-one pound and a beatin' better than Coronach. He could have
  fell down, got up an' <i>then</i> won. If he'd been trying&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't the jockey, it was the judge," said The Miller gently. "If
  <i>he'd</i> been trying hard he might have seen your unbeatable gem. But he's
  only human, Evans&mdash;he couldn't see so far down the course. Evans, I
  think you had better stick to motors."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans ignored this insulting reference to a certain licence he held,
  sighed, and then, with a start of alarm, saw The Miller take from his pocket
  a hateful green paper.</p>

  <p>"What them Lubeses say don't mean nothing to me," he said loudly. "Mrs.
  Lube is no better than a lady ought to be. Old Sam's Midnight Special!" he
  sneered. "It ought to be called 'The Lodger's Moonlight Sonata.' She's worse
  than the far-famed Kate Webster that cut up her mother an' put her in a
  biscuit box. She's as two-faced as the well-known weathercock on St. Pancases
  Church. That woman would take away a man's character an' never think twice
  about it. She's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Leave the poor woman alone: listen and weep," said The Miller as he
  read:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">"Who sent three horses for one race?<br>
  EVANS!<br>
  Did they win?<br>
  NO!<br>
  Was they placed?<br>
  NO!<br>
  Is that education?<br>
  YES!<br>
  Stick to Old Sam, who only sends one winner and that wins."</p><br>

  <p>"That's what I call vulgar," said Evans hotly. "I wouldn't have that
  woman's disposition for ten million pounds. Education! Ain't I the only man
  that could ever ask Datas a question that could never be answered? Didn't I
  stand up for two hours and twenty-five minutes in Hyde Park one Sunday night
  and argue about drink till a policeman come an' moved me away? I don't mind
  Old Sam: he's not right in his head; but this here Mrs. Lube, I'm going to
  bring an action in the High Court an' I'm consultin' me solicitor this
  mornin'. I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't get ten years."</p>

  <p>Yet, for all Mr. Evans' righteous indignation, there can be no question
  whatever that he had fallen into grievous error over the Stanborough
  Handicap. For, having sent out overnight Waxy, he had received information by
  the first post which induced him to change his selection to Fairy Feet, and
  at the eleventh hour, as the result of an urgent communication which had come
  to him from the sister of a girl who had got into serious trouble with a head
  lad, he wired all his important clients that Funny Harry was walking over for
  that same race. And, as The Miller rightly and properly said, not one of
  those horses had finished in the first three, or, for the matter of that, in
  the first five.</p>

  <p>Now a man may make mistakes and be forgiven. It was not the first time
  that Mr. Evans had had the misfortune to tip more horses than one in a race;
  but on all these occasions Camden Town had forgiven him and offered him one
  more chance. But whether it was due to the wide publicity which the Lubeses
  gave to his unfortunate mistake, or whether for some more esoteric reason,
  Educated Evans encountered a stone wall of hostility, and within three days
  of his <i>faux pas</i>, his clientele had been reduced to three persons, one
  of whom suffered chronically from delirium tremens. The other two never paid,
  so they didn't count.</p>

  <p>Evans for once was sensitive to popular disapprobation. He sought vainly
  to justify himself, made a rapid circuit of his houses of call, was frozen
  out of three and physically thrown out of the fourth. Misfortunes never come
  singly; and it was Mr. Evans' misfortune that he had ventured not only his
  reserve but his very rent money on Funny Harry, and it was a ruined man who
  pored over the evening newspaper, hoping that some misprint or a chance prick
  in the programme would act as a revelation from heaven and furnish him with
  the necessary means of rehabilitation.</p>

  <p>Tragic indeed is the lot of him who, falling from a high estate, of which
  he was the admired darling, discovers himself lying in the mud, a door-mat on
  which the unworthy feet of sometime clients might be wiped, a gibe for
  Lubeses of both sexes.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans felt his position acutely during those seven tragic days which
  followed.</p>

  <p>If he could only have persuaded one of the old reliables to come back and
  act honourable, he might have mounted again to his former eminence but with a
  unanimity which was terrifying, Camden Town refused to recognise the genius
  and integrity of him who had once been its pride.</p>

  <p>He buttonholed Mr. Hackitt, the eminent fishmonger and poulterer.</p>

  <p>"I've got a horse in the Lingfield Plate&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Keep it there," said Mr. Hackitt roughly, disengaging himself. "He'll
  feel lonely without his two pals, won't he? You usually send three, don't
  you, Evans?"</p>

  <p>"All I want to say to you, Mr. Hackitt," pleaded Evans; but long before he
  could frame his justification and apology, Mr. Hackitt had disappeared into
  the fish mortuary which he called a shop.</p>

  <p>He tried with the landlord of the "White Hart" over a friendly whisky and
  soda which he could ill afford, and at that hour in the morning could hardly
  digest.</p>

  <p>"I got one for the Lingfield Plate, Mr. Long," he said confidentially. "It
  was sent me in a curious way."</p>

  <p>"I dessay," said Mr. Long, wiping the zinc-topped counter mechanically.
  "And I expect you'll send it out in a curious way, but I'm not going to back
  it in any way. A man who sends one horse I can stand, but a man who sends
  three&mdash;and I got 'em all&mdash;is, a man I never want to see in my
  house."</p>

  <p>By the end of the day all Camden Town knew that Mr. Evans had something
  unbeatable, something remarkable, something that could fall down, get up and
  then win the Lingfield Plate. Men told each other this fact with a quiet,
  sneering smile. It is true there were one or two weaklings who were almost
  inclined to subscribe, but the scorn and contempt of their fellows made them
  change their minds.</p>

  <p>In perfect justice to these hard-shelled gentlemen, it must be confessed
  that Mr. Evans had no unbeatable selection for the Lingfield Plate; he had
  hardly looked at the entries. Yet, in a mysterious way, his fate was bound up
  with three young men who were very greatly interested in a horse entered for
  that affair, and by the queer workings of Providence he was brought in touch
  with them.</p>

  <p>It was evening and rather sultry. A heavy shower had fallen on Camden
  Town, making the roads greasy. He was walking along Hampstead Road when he
  saw a big car coming at a little above regulation speed in the direction of
  the West End. It tried to pass a taxi, skidded on the tram-lines, did a
  graceful <i>chassé</i> towards the pavement, hit a lamp-post, and in some
  miraculous fashion came to a stop by the kerb without having sustained any
  greater damage than a smashed mudguard.</p>

  <p>Before the crowd gathered, Evans went up to the window, and the first
  thing he realised was that the young gentleman in evening dress who was
  sitting at the steering wheel was slightly the better for drink. He was very
  cheerful, very talkative, and in fact was screaming with laughter, as at a
  great joke, when Evans approached. His companions were a little better, or a
  little worse, according to the view you take of intemperance.</p>

  <p>Now, if Evans had never driven a car, he had driven one of those
  motor-lorries which Mr. Ford, a well-known American, had introduced to our
  long-suffering country; and in his pride and skill he had acquired for
  himself a driver's licence. He saw at some distance an approaching policeman;
  and whatever you might say about Mr. Evans, you must admit that his mind
  worked quickly.</p>

  <p>He opened the door of the saloon and stepped in uninvited.</p>

  <p>"Hi, outside you, old fellow!" said the driver. "You're right!" hissed
  Evans. "And if that flattie comes up you'll be pinched."</p>

  <p>The driver was not so unsober that he did not recognise the truth of this
  unknown intruder's prediction. In an instant he made way, and by the time the
  policeman came up, groping in the region of his pants for a pocket- book, Mr.
  Evans was sitting nonchalantly at the wheel.</p>

  <p>Happily for him, he was not recognised by this young constable, and after
  taking the number of the car, examining Evans' licence, which he had with
  him, carefully examining the lamp-post, the car proceeded.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?" asked Evans, starting the car with a grind of gears
  that set the occupants' teeth on edge, and certainly did much to sober
  them.</p>

  <p>"We're going to St. Jamesh Street," said the young man, who was now
  thoroughly alert.</p>

  <p>"And I'm dashed obliged to you," he said, after the exchange had been
  made. "Come along and have a drink."</p>

  <p>In the palatial flat of Sir Henry Llewellyn Creen (for this proved to be
  the name of the driver) Mr. Evans explained his vocation. He did not notice
  the three men look at one another significantly, and if he had he would have
  thought nothing more than that they were impressed by this chance meeting of
  one whose name was famous throughout the north-west district of London.</p>

  <p>In the course of time he was dismissed, with a £5 note which he twice
  refused, until he was quite sure they weren't trying to take a rise out of
  him. The three young gentleman sat round a table and discussed the great
  event of the morrow.</p>

  <p>They were all fairly well off, and one of them owned a certain horse,
  Dictonite, a maiden four-year-old that had run six times as a two and had
  never been placed, had not run at all as a three, but as a four- year-old had
  been got ready for the Lingfield High-Weight Plate. It had not only been got
  ready, but every substantial bookmaker in the United Kingdom had also shared
  in the process.</p>

  <p>There was in course of preparation amongst these young bloods the colossal
  coup of the year. The race was to be run at 2.20, and at 2.15 1,270 telegrams
  were to be handed in at fifty post offices in various parts of England. They
  had borrowed names and they themselves had opened accounts wherever accounts
  could be opened; and their secret had been so jealously guarded that nobody,
  with the exception of their trainer and their trainer's head lad, was aware
  that Dictonite was "walking" the Lingfield Plate.</p>

  <p>They did not need the money, but they wanted the rag, and the organisation
  of the coup had occupied three months which otherwise would have been spent
  in evading boredom.</p>

  <p>They talked of Dictonite over a bottle, and then they talked of Evans over
  another bottle; at the third bottle they got back to Dictonite. And then the
  young baronet, who was the head of this lively gang, rose unsteadily to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"Boys," he said thickly, "we'll do this bird Evans a turn! Le's go roun'
  and see him and tell him to send out Dictonite to all his pals."</p>

  <p>And they were in that state of mind that none of them recognised that the
  carefully laid plans of three months were on the point of going
  assy-tassy.</p>

  <p>It was late at night when they clambered into a taxi-cab, and a quarter of
  an hour later, after considerable search, Evans' flat was located, and they
  were thundering on the door.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans rose hastily and admitted his visitors.</p>

  <p>" 'Slike this, ole feller," said Sir Henry gravely. "You're a goo' chap,
  we're goo' chaps. You're a tipshter, we're tipshters. You shend out Dictonite
  to-morrow morning... money for nothin', old thing... got many clients?"</p>

  <p>"Fourteen thousand seven hundred and fifty-one," said Evans wearily.</p>

  <p>"You shend Dictonite, old cock...."</p>

  <p>"You'd better go home," said Evans, whose first thought when he had seen
  them was that they had called for the return of his £5 note.</p>

  <p>"You shend Dictonite," said Sir Henry Llewellyn Creen again, and with this
  piece of profound advice they took their leave, each having in his bosom the
  glow which comes to drunken men who have done somebody a good turn at their
  own expense.</p>

  <p>But the morning brought recollection, repentance and something like
  dismay. The elder of the three dashed into Sir Henry's room and woke him.</p>

  <p>"I say, we were awfully pickled last night, but did we go round to that
  damned tipster and tell him about Dictonite, or did I dream it?"</p>

  <p>The youthful baronet rose and rubbed his hair.</p>

  <p>"We did, by gad!" he said. "Wake up, Winkie, we'll have to have a council
  of war."</p>

  <p>Winkie, the youngest of the three, was dragged from his bed, brought to
  consciousness with a cold-water sponge thrust into his face, and pushed into
  a chair at the council board.</p>

  <p>"There's only one thing to be done," said the penitent leader. "What can
  we do? What lunatics we were!"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," said his second-in-command. "Let's send this bird a wire
  asking him to keep his mouth shut and not to send the horse, and we'll give
  him the odds to a pony."</p>

  <p>The wire was sent over the telephone, and three gloomy young conspirators
  went to their baths and bathed and dressed.</p>

  <p>"If this feller sends the tip, it'll cost us about twenty thousand quid,"
  said Sir Henry Llewellyn Creen, over his meagre breakfast. "Let's go and see
  him."</p>

  <p>They went in a body to Bayham Mews, but no response came to their
  knocking. A taxi-driver, about to venture forth with his machine, volunteered
  the information that Evans had left early. "I see him comin' down the stairs
  as the telegraph boy arrived&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did he get the telegram?" asked Sir Henry eagerly. "Thank heaven for
  that!"</p>

  <p>They drove to Lingfield with a lighter heart.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans had received the telegram. If the truth be told, he had left
  early in order to avoid an interview with his rapacious landlord, to whom he
  owed four weeks' rent. He had met the telegraph boy, had taken the telegram
  from him and thrust it into his pocket. It was his practice to receive, three
  mornings a week, a wire from his correspondent at Lambourn: but as the last
  four wires he had had from that quarter demanded payment for past work, he
  had got into the habit of leaving such messages unopened.</p>

  <p>He had a yesterday's railway ticket for Ling-field which he had scrounged
  from a disgruntled backer who had succeeded in evading the collector, and,
  after chewing off the date, he made his way to Victoria and eventually
  reached the course. Only very few intimates know how Mr. Evans succeeded in
  reaching Tattersall's. He had three methods, and none of them had ever
  failed.</p>

  <p>He was leaning disconsolately over the rails, watching the horses go down
  to the post, when he heard The Miller's voice.</p>

  <p>"Had a bet, Evans?" asked Inspector Arbuthnot Challoner.</p>

  <p>Evans smiled wanly.</p>

  <p>"I got a horse in this race that couldn't lose," he said.
  "Pinpoint&mdash;help yourself. You couldn't put me off it. Three young swells
  came round to my flat last night and tried to stuff me with a horse called
  Dictonite&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dictonite?"</p>

  <p>The Miller looked at his card, then consulted his book of form, then shook
  his head.</p>

  <p>"Not a earthly. That horse couldn't win a race&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped here. The field had started on its homeward journey. He had not
  even troubled to examine the colours of Dictonite, so that when the brown and
  purple jacket went past the post two lengths ahead of its fellows, he was
  under the impression that it was something of Jack Jarvis's .</p>

  <p>"This horse Dictonite&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"It won," said The Miller.</p>

  <p>"Did it?" said Evans, aghast. "Bless my heart an' soul. An' to think I had
  that horse give me by the owner. Tut-tut! When your luck's out you can do
  nothin' right. Now I've got one for the next race, Mr. Miller&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But The Miller didn't wait to hear.</p>

  <p>Evans strolled disconsolately into the paddock. He heard, with a shudder,
  that Dictonite had started at 100-6.</p>

  <p>"What a nearly beauty!" he moaned.</p>

  <p>And then he saw approaching him the young man whom he had displaced at the
  wheel on the previous night. The young gentleman beckoned him aside and Evans
  went.</p>

  <p>"Did you send this horse out?"</p>

  <p>It was on the tip of Evans' tongue to enumerate the number of clients to
  whom this gem had been sent, but second thoughts were best.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth, sir, I didn't," he said. "I gathered you didn't,
  from the price," said Sir Henry cheerfully.</p>

  <p>He dived his hand into his pocket, produced a wad of notes and thrust them
  into the palsied hand of the World's Champion.</p>

  <p>"Here the odds to a pony each way, as I promised you in my wire. Good
  fellow!"</p>

  <p>He patted Evans paternally on the back. Evans held on to the railings with
  one hand and to the banknotes with the other. It was not until the numbers
  went up for the last race that he was sufficiently recovered to make his way
  to the railway station.</p>

  <p>And that night all Camden Town knew that, though they had rejected the
  priceless information which Mr. Evans had been prepared to give them, he
  himself had packed up a parcel. For did he not stand at the bar of the "White
  Hart" that night and insolently demand of the landlord that he should change
  a £50 note, and threaten him with the loss of his licence unless he did
  so?</p>

  <h2><a id="story6"
     name="story6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE NICE MINDED GIRL</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE is no doubt at all that Mr. Nobbs, the celebrated
  trainer, was hot, and less doubt that Mr. Snazzivitz, his chief and principal
  patron, was even hotter. Mr. Snazzivitz was so hot that when he went for an
  insurance on his new cabinet works at Bethnal Green, the insurance manager
  sent for the police.</p>

  <p>They were both hot and patient, and that made them even warmer. Mr. Nobbs
  was quite content to run a horse down the course one day a week for the whole
  of the season, and pop him up at Warwick at 100-7 in the last week; the
  identical animal having finished tailed off last time out. And he felt no
  shame when he read in the morning newspapers that his horse had made every
  yard of the running and had been well backed.</p>

  <p>There were many people who thought Mr. Nobbs would be better off in
  another world, and bitter statements were made about the purblindness of
  stewards; but Mr. Nobbs was never warned off, for he had an explanation up
  one sleeve and an alibi up the other, and the only time he was ever called
  before the local stewards, he told such a pathetic and plausible story that
  there was some talk of raising a subscription for him, though it came to
  nothing.</p>

  <p>It was the privilege of Educated Evans, the World's Premier Prophet and
  Turf Adviser, to know the barber who shaved Mr. Snazzivitz whenever he was in
  town. And whenever one of Mr. Snazzivitz's horses was on the job, the fact
  was whispered into the barber's shell-like ear for his own information and
  guidance, repeated to Educated Evans, and by him circulated the wide world
  over. So it might be said that the confidence of Mr. Snazzivitz was only
  partially respected.</p>

  <p>One afternoon Mr. Snazzivitz met his trainer, the eminent Mr. Nobbs, at
  lunch, and Mr. Nobbs was both querulous and accusative.</p>

  <p>"We ought to have got twenty to one about that horse yesterday,
  Snazzivitz," he said. "I didn't have a penny on him on the course; I told
  nobody, and even the stable lads didn't know he was going to run; and yet
  money started rolling in for him ten minutes before the off. Five to two is
  no good for me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't fill me with the wildest enthusiasm, my dear," said Mr.
  Snazzivitz, who didn't talk quite as good English as I have made him talk.
  "It must be that so-and-so barber of mine. I only heard this morning that
  he's a dead pal of that so-and-so-Evans, the Camden Town tipster."</p>

  <p>"Change your barber," suggested Mr. Nobbs.</p>

  <p>"I know a better way than that," said Mr. Snazzivitz, an unholy smile on a
  large and cherubic face that was sprinkled with large and prominent
  features.</p>

  <p>"They've spoilt one of the best coups we have ever had, and I'm not going
  to let 'em down as lightly as that. I'm the sort of man, Nobbs," he went on,
  "that never forgets a friend or forgives an enemy. I'd work my fingers to the
  bone to help them that help me, and to destroy them that did me down. That's
  the kind of man I am!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Nobbs knew the kind of man he was without being told. He was the kind
  of man who, if you sent him in the ring to back a horse for you, returned you
  the starting price and pouched the difference for Mr. Snazzivitz was so rich
  that he couldn't afford to be honest.</p>

  <p>Educated Evans occasionally employed female labour. He had not been very
  fortunate in his selections, it is true, but such was his faith in human
  nature, and so high was his regard for the female of the species that he
  never entirely lost hope. So there came to be installed at Forseti House the
  beauteous Miss Marie Rose, who was fair and slim and had wonderful blue eyes
  and arched black eyebrows&mdash;all of which were attached to a body of
  singular attraction, so far as could be seen; and as she dressed in the mode
  of the day, quite a lot was visible.</p>

  <p>She was the niece of Mr. Rose, the cheese-monger, who was a great admirer
  of Educated Evans, and dreamed dreams of giving over the sordid cheese and
  butter business and embarking upon the romantic adventure of an s.p. book.
  And since she was likely to be the only person he would trust, he was
  desirous that she should become acquainted with the peculiar technology of
  the racing world. And he had another reason for getting her out of the
  house.</p>

  <p>"I trust her with you, Evans," he said, "and I wouldn't trust her with
  anybody else. She's a nice-minded girl, high-spirited and all that sort of
  thing, and she was brought up in a convent."</p>

  <p>"With the monks," nodded Evans.</p>

  <p>"I don't know nothing about monks," said the cheese man. "But she knows
  practically nothing of the world, and I want you to stand between her and, so
  to speak, temptation. I know you're all right, because no girl would look
  twice at you without laughing: you've got such a good-natured face," he
  added, and the ruffled Evans was hardly appeased.</p>

  <p>He was enunciating his philosophy one morning, what time she folded with
  nimble fingers the announcements which were to gladden the hearts of all
  clients new and old.</p>

  <p>"I dare say, Miss Rose," said Evans, "that I sort of puzzle you at times.
  Not that you ain't well educated, but you haven't got my experience and savvy
  fair, to use a foreign expression. I dare say sometimes you don't follow my
  reason and logic, but you'll get used to me in time, Miss Rose. I'm like the
  well-known William the Silent, the highly-celebrated Emperor of Germany; I
  don't talk unless I have to."</p>

  <p>"Education is a wonderful thing," sighed the young lady. "I often wish I'd
  gone on to the sixth standard."</p>

  <p>"It is wonderful and it's not," admitted Evans modestly. "You get a bit
  fed up with people pointing you out in the street and saying 'That's him!'
  But you've got to put up with that. The way they come to me to settle bets is
  getting a public nuisance. Do you know the date of the Great Fire of London?"
  he asked, closing his eyes and raising his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm only twenty-one," she said. "I don't quite remember; it must have
  happened when I was a baby."</p>

  <p>"1643," said Evans rapidly, "during the reign of the great Queen Anne,
  known as the virgin queen because of her friendship for the great Duke of
  Marlborough, the ancestor of Winston Churchill, the highly celebrated naval
  man. The last time the Thames was froze over was in 1472, the year we
  defeated the Germans at the Battle of Trafalgar Square&mdash;see Lord
  Nelson."</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew as much as you," said Marie Rose wistfully.</p>

  <p>"You can't," said Evans. "It's not given to everybody. It's a gift, the
  same as a voice for singing purposes. All my work is brain work. I've got to
  carry things in me head that'd drive you silly! When did Eclipse win the
  Derby?"</p>

  <p>"Last week?" she hazarded, having only a vague knowledge of the sport of
  kings.</p>

  <p>"In 1872," said Evans with even greater rapidity. "It was run during a
  snowstorm, and Jack Jarvis, the celebrated trainer, put a ball of butter in
  the horse's hoofs so that he'd slide round Tottenham Corner. Eclipse was the
  half-brother to Bayardo, from which the mighty Bart Snowball is descended.
  See Stud Book!"</p>

  <p>His further lesson in ancient history was interrupted by a tap at the
  door. Evans himself opened it and saw a resplendent gentleman smoking a large
  cigar and wearing what appeared to be the entire contents of Sam Isaacs'
  jewellery store.</p>

  <p>"Name of Evans?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am Mr. Evans," admitted the educational authority.</p>

  <p>The newcomer swept the room with a glance in which contempt, amusement,
  resentment and disgust were unskilfully blended.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to have a word with you when you're alone," he said.</p>

  <p>Evans looked at the young lady, raised his eyebrows with great
  significance&mdash;he had very flexible eyebrows&mdash;and she took a hasty
  departure.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Evans." Mr. Snazzivitz sat down uninvited on the only
  comfortable chair in the room. "You've probably heard of me. My name is
  Isidore Snazzivitz."</p>

  <p>"The celebrated owner?" asked Evans, interested. "Who trains with the
  well-known Mr. Nobbs on the far-famed Berkshire Downs?"</p>

  <p>"That's me," said Mr. Snazzivitz. "You've been sending out a horse of
  mine. I'd like to know where you got your information."</p>

  <p>Evans knit his brow.</p>

  <p>"I send out so many horses," he said. "Perhaps, if you'll kindly name the
  animal&mdash;" He paused inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Bluebottle," said Mr. Snazzivitz, and a look of intelligence came to Mr.
  Evans' already intelligent face.</p>

  <p>"Bluebottle? I seem to remember the name... yes, yes, I sent it out on my
  five-pound special. I had it from one of my touts."</p>

  <p>"You had it from my barber&mdash;that's who you had it from," said Mr.
  Snazzivitz unpleasantly. And then, remembering his mission, he forced a smile
  to his face. "Now look here, Evans, you're not a bad fellow; I've heard a lot
  about you; and if you ever want a tip, come straight to me. Don't go messing
  about with my barber. I'll tell you anything I know and anything that's
  going. Here's my address"&mdash;he produced a large card with a floral
  decoration in the corner&mdash;"I only live five minutes' walk away," he
  said. "Never hesitate to come and see me, and maybe I'll put you on to one or
  two good things. You're interfering with my business, Evans, and that's a
  fact. What chance have I of getting a job home when you're circulating it
  round Camden Town? You see what I mean?"</p>

  <p>Evans saw what he meant. Such condescension from a real owner was most
  overpowering. He could only bow.</p>

  <p>"That's a very nice girl you've got. Where did you get her?"</p>

  <p>"She's a friend of mine," said Evans, with a certain amount of dignity. "I
  never give away the names of the staff."</p>

  <p>Now Mr. Snazzivitz had come with no other idea than to take a firm grip of
  a possible cause of annoyance, for he had many horses due to win, and, so to
  speak, his winter's keep was looming ahead. And it was vitally necessary that
  no so-and-so tipster should send his so-and-so horses (as he himself tersely
  described the situation) and spoil his something-or-other market. Which was a
  feeling very right and natural, and held in common with other speculative
  owners, trainers, jockeys and jockeys' valets. But he was a susceptible man,
  and the sight of those blue eyes and that rose-and-milk complexion, that
  svelte form and other appendages peculiar to radiant femininity, shifted, so
  to speak, his angle of vision.</p>

  <p>The next morning he called again. Evans saw him coming down the mews and
  uttered a few words of warning and admonition to his assistant.</p>

  <p>"You want to be careful about that man," he said. "I'm so to speak
  responsible for you to your uncle. Ever heard about the gipsy's warning? I'll
  get you a copy this afternoon. If he asks you to go and have a bit of dinner
  with him, just be 'aughty&mdash;like that!" Evans gave an imitation of a
  haughty young lady of twenty-one, a piece of acting that must have made Mrs.
  Phelps turn in her grave.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't dream of going," said the girl. "Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"His name is Snazzivitz," said Evans rapidly, for the man was coming up
  the stairs. "He's a horse-owner and a rooey."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" she asked, in open-eyed wonder.</p>

  <p>"A man that don't know when to stop," said Evans.</p>

  <p>"What does he do for a living?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"Backs horses. But the bookmakers are getting wise," said Evans, "and
  they're closing his accounts. He used to have about four hundred, but they're
  shut down now, and he's always on the look-out for mugs to open accounts for
  him."</p>

  <p>"How perfectly dreadful!" said Marie.</p>

  <p>It was perfectly true that Mr. Snazzivitz was that kind of man. He was the
  greatest job merchant of his year, and when he wanted to back a horse he used
  not only his own accounts, but he had a large list of friends who for a
  consideration would lend their names and accounts for his purpose. Thus, if
  you are John Jones and have an account with Macpherson the eminent bookmaker,
  you could by arrangement lend him a wire addressed to your bookmaker, and at
  the psychological moment he would back the horse for £5, the odds to £1 being
  yours, the odds to £4 being his; and if the horse went down, which it never
  did, he would refund you the £4 you had lost.</p>

  <p>"Does he get a lot of money that way?" she asked wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Packets," said Evans.</p>

  <p>"How wonderful!" breathed the girl. "I mean, how dreadful to take it
  perhaps from the poor bookmakers and to deprive them as it were of sustenance
  for their wives and shoes for their little children I wonder he can sleep at
  nights."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that he does," said Evans.</p>

  <p>And then Mr. Snazzivitz came in.</p>

  <p>"Talking about horses," he said, his eyes on the peerless Marie, "I've had
  a tip for one that's going at&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;er Lingfield on
  Saturday, a horse called Heah."</p>

  <p>He did not take his eyes from the girl. Evans was annoyed. He was annoyed
  because there was no meeting at Lingfield on Saturday, and because Heah had
  already won there.</p>

  <p>"Good morning," said Mr. Snazzivitz. He was not speaking to Evans.</p>

  <p>The girl raised her timid eyes from her work and dropped them again.</p>

  <p>"That's a funny job you've got," said Mr. Snazzivitz in his most amiable
  tone. "We shall have to improve on that, eh, Evans?"</p>

  <p>"This is my business," said Evans loudly, "and I'd be obliged if you
  didn't speak to the clurks."</p>

  <p>A look passed between the two. Evans, unused to the artfulness of
  courtship, saw nothing. Did she scribble "8 o'clock, Cobden Statue" on her
  blotting-pad? If she did, she scribbled it out again, because he could see
  nothing but wriggly lines when he examined the pad later. At any rate, Mr.
  Snazzivitz did not prolong his stay.</p>

  <p>He was a youngish man, and people who wanted to be in his good books, or
  men and women of defective vision, might describe him as handsome. Mr. Evans,
  returning from a heated argument at the "Bull and Crow" with Lube on the
  ethics of tipping, had occasion to walk through Mornington Crescent, a
  somewhat deserted residential thoroughfare; and there he had the shock of his
  life. A man and a girl were walking in front of him, arm in arm, their heads
  together, their pace leisurely. Evans gasped.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he breathed.</p>

  <p>He had a good mind to go back and challenge Mr. Snazzivitz, reprimand the
  girl, wave her dramatically in the direction of the cheese- monger's, and
  send her home. But he did not.</p>

  <p>The next morning, when he went to his office, Miss Marie Rose was not
  there. Instead was a little note in which she said that she found the work
  was rather heavier than she had expected, and with her uncle's permission she
  had decided that a woman's place was at home.</p>

  <p>"Education's wasted on that girl," said Evans bitterly to The Miller at
  the first opportunity. "That man's no better than the celebrated Looey the
  Nineteenth who used to chase nimps through the glades of Fountingblue. I'm
  going straight to her uncle."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't if I were you," said The Miller. "That young lady can take
  care of herself."</p>

  <p>"She went to a convent&mdash;" began Evans.</p>

  <p>"She was also chucked out of the convent for teaching the younger students
  the game of banker," said The Miller.</p>

  <p>"But her uncle sent her to me because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Her uncle sent her to you," said The Miller patiently, "because she
  tossed the errand boy for his salary with a two-headed ha 'penny. If you can
  teach her anything, you might send the subject along to me, will you? That
  girl will do anything for money except work."</p>

  <p>Yet she was a good girl, as she told the discomfited Mr. Snazzivitz, when
  he offered her almost everything in the world, except a marriage certificate,
  to share his life and fortune.</p>

  <p>"I will do almost anything for you, Ronald," she said, with sweet childish
  impetuosity, "and haven't I already opened twenty-five accounts for you in
  dear uncle's name? At least, on dear uncle's note-heading? And there'll be
  another thirty by to-night's post. You can't ask me to do more than
  that."</p>

  <p>"I love you&mdash;" began Mr. Snazzivitz.</p>

  <p>"I know, and I love you dreadfully," said the girl, shaking her head, a
  tear trembling on her eyelids. "But we must be sensible, mustn't we? I don't
  even mind being married at a registrar's office; you can always get the
  photographers there, and I make an awfully good photograph. But this idea of
  a Bloomsbury flat is so dreadfully vulgar and shocking that I cannot let
  myself think about it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Snazzivitz was content to wait. They dined that night at the Laurence
  in Wardour Street, and they supped that night at the Boolum Club, and they
  lunched next day at the Empress Club, and went to a <i>thé dansant</i> at the
  Regent Palace, and dined at the Worlingham&mdash;in fact they were quite a
  lot together. And all the time one of Mr. Nobbs' charges, a noble animal
  called "Button Boots," was nearing perfection.</p>

  <p>On the night before the Hurst Park meeting Mr. Nobbs came to town and saw
  Mr. Snazzivitz.</p>

  <p>"This horse," he said, "could pull a 'bus and win. You haven't been to
  that so-and-so barber of yours, have you?"</p>

  <p>"I'll so-and-so watch it!" said Mr. Snazzivitz luridly.</p>

  <p>"Then we ought to get 100 to 7 for our money. Have you opened any new
  accounts?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Snazzivitz nodded.</p>

  <p>"A friend of mine has opened sixty," he said complacently...</p>

  <p>The next morning The Miller met Mr. Evans and made a suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Button Boots?" said Evans dubiously. "He hasn't been placed all the year,
  and he's been running in selling plates. You don't expect him to win a
  good-class race?"</p>

  <p>"There's a whisper round the town."</p>

  <p>Evans smiled sourly.</p>

  <p>"That Snazzivitz couldn't win a race," he said definitely. "He won't have
  no luck for the rest of the year. He's a kidnapper, a snake in the grass and
  a rooey! I'd like to do him a bad turn, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>When The Miller had gone, Evans sat down to consider the matter. He had no
  very definite views on the race. Why not send out Button Boots, if only to
  annoy the man for whom he had conceived such a deadly hatred? To think, with
  Evans, was to act. To all clients new and old the message went forth.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"SIR,&mdash;Have a good win on</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">BUTTON BOOTS.</p>

  <p class="quote">This horse has been tried to be 21 lbs. in front of the
  highly celebrated Pickaboon. Help yourself, and don't forget your old friend
  Educated Evans."</p><br>

  <p>And Button Boots won&mdash;at a modest price, it is true. For there was an
  illusion in Camden Town that Evans knew all about Nobbs' horses, and his fame
  as an informant in the matter of these animals had spread to the very end of
  the world, which is somewhere beyond Croydon. He was reckoning the possible
  revenues from his success when the door was flung violently open and the
  innocent girl came in. Her eyes were blazing, her cheeks were white.</p>

  <p>"Did you send out Button Boots?" she hissed. "Yes, Miss Marie," said
  Evans, rising with politeness. He was always a gentleman.</p>

  <p>"Then what in hell do you mean by spoiling my market?" she howled at
  him.</p>

  <p>She left Evans staggering and dazed. As she turned out of the mews she was
  met by Mr. Snazzivitz.</p>

  <p>"Oh, here you are!" he said, relieved. "You got those wires away? It was a
  rotten price&mdash;I don't know why&mdash;but so far as I can make out,
  you'll be sending me a thousand pounds on Monday&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A thousand buck-rabbits!" said the blue-eyed child with startling
  malignity. "It ought to have been three thousand if that pie-faced mutt had
  closed his big mouth! And listen, Mr. Snazzivitz, I'm English, and my motto
  is 'What I've got I hold.' If you ever get any money from me, book the
  address&mdash;I'll be writing from a high-class lunatic asylum!"</p>

  <h2><a id="story7"
     name="story7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE MUSICAL TIP</h2>

  <p class="first">IT is a curious fact, that must have impressed itself upon
  the observant, that people who move in an environment of splendour seldom
  realise their own good fortune.</p>

  <p>For example: there are men and women who live at those earthly paradises,
  Blackpool and Southend, all the year round and are unconscious of the
  blessing. There are coarse stage hands who see Gladys Cooper every day of
  their lives and do not swoon with ecstasy. Similarly, Sir Boski Takerlit knew
  and entertained some of the wisest trainers that were ever licensed by the
  Jockey Club, and yet profited not by so much as a penny from the priceless
  information which came his way.</p>

  <p>"Rubbish and nonsense!" he used to say of racing. "Dommy rod! Der man dat
  bags horses is a stubid ass&mdash;hein?"</p>

  <p>How he came to know these trainers at all is a long story but may be
  briefly condensed. He was an authority on the musical comedy and operatic
  world, and when he wanted to put a girl in the chorus in a small part his
  recommendation was almost a command. And there were many naughty trainers
  who, quite unknown to their wives, were interested in furthering the stage
  ambitions of pretty young ladies in whom they took more than a fatherly
  interest.</p>

  <p>Lady Takerlit was not so well known to all who go racing as, say, Old
  Kate. In fact, for certain reasons she never went racing at all, because, to
  her husband, racing was anathema. He was a popular musician and had been
  knighted. It is a well-known fact that any man who wags a baton before a
  hired band playing somebody else's music simply can't escape being knighted.
  Round about New Year's Day the Flying Squad scour London to find a bandmaster
  who isn't a Sir, and, clubbing him into insensibility, they tie a Garter
  round his neck, hit him on the head with a sword and his name henceforth is
  Sir Mud.</p>

  <p>Sir Boski Takerlit was a rich man, having recomposed several popular tunes
  of the '60's. Her ladyship (as she was often called) was a democrat. That is
  to say, she was happiest when she was in the company of her intellectual and
  social inferiors. They were sometimes difficult to find, for this is the
  truth: Sir Boski, in a moment of temporary insanity or spiritual exaltation
  (one is sometimes mistaken for the other) married his housemaid. She was
  pretty and once upon a time had been slight. She was still pretty when, an
  optimistic circular having come her way, she wrote to Educated Evans.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">DEAR SIR,&mdash;Please send me your 5 pound special. I
  inclose p.o. for 2s. 6d.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours truly,</p>

  <p class="letter">LADY TAKERLIT.</p><br>

  <p>She always signed herself "Lady Takerlit." Otherwise, as she said to her
  husband: "How the hell would they know I was a lady?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans sent his £5 Special for 2s. 6d. The usual price was 5s., but he
  never returned money. And the horse he sent was a winner.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Thank you, dear Mr. Evons!" she wrote. "I back Marked
  Marble and as you say, What beauty! Pray pop round one day to tea. The
  buttler will show you in.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours truly,</p>

  <p class="letter">LADY TAKERLIT."</p><br>

  <p>She usually referred to her buttler in such letters.</p>

  <p>Evans popped round to Micklesfield Square. He was met on the doorstep by
  Sir Boski Takerlit, who glared at him.</p>

  <p>"Who der plazes are you?" asked Sir Boski. "Mr. Evans, of Masked Marvel
  Mansions," said the educated man; "commonly known as the World's Champion
  Turf Adviser</p>

  <p>"Tibster!" roared Sir Boski. "So id is you that has let my wife asdray!
  Gid oudt!"</p>

  <p>Evans got oudt.</p>

  <p>He did not know that Sir Boski was both jealous and mean. This he learnt
  later when her ladyship called on him one dark evening.</p>

  <p>"I don't really know how I can look you in the face, Mr. Evons," she said.
  "I don't reely! The way my husband went on to you is simply disgraceful and
  disgusting."</p>

  <p>She looked round the little room; to her it seemed agreeably cosy, for in
  truth she was rather overawed by the magnificent Victorian surroundings in
  which she moved.</p>

  <p>"Good idea having your office over a stable&mdash;I suppose you keep your
  horses downstairs?" she said.</p>

  <p>Evans inclined his head gravely, though in truth the only animal beneath
  him was Ford Van (by Rattle out of Detroit).</p>

  <p>"You've no idea how near he is, Mr. Evons, and him with money to burn and
  everything. If I didn't make a bit of pin money now and again I don't know
  where I'd be. But don't send me any more&mdash;he opens my letters. I'll pop
  round and see you, and now and again I'll be able to give you a tip."</p>

  <p>"My ladyship," said Evans, with old-world courtesy, "the pleasure will be
  yours."</p>

  <p>He kissed her hand. He had seen pictures of people kissing the hand of
  royalty and he thought it was the right thing to do. Unfortunately, at that
  second the door was opened and Bogey Jones appeared. He had come to borrow
  the <i>Sporting Chronicle</i>. It was an embarrassing moment, but Evans,
  quick-witted, thought of an expedient to get rid of the visitor: he had
  reason to regret his intelligence.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Them that acts honourable <i>is</i> honourable!" said
  Educated Evans emphatically. "An' them that <i>don't</i> act honourable would
  pinch the nails out of a orphan's boots an' sell 'em to blind men for
  cloves!"</p>

  <p>"Which, reduced to the language of Camden Town, means that you've been
  had," said The Miller unsympathetically. He was chewing a straw that he had
  abstracted from a truss at Morley's, the Corn and Flour Merchants. "Anyway
  you're a Can&mdash;nobody but a Can would trust Bogey Jones."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean by Can, Mr. Challoner," said Evans with
  dignity. "I've never got hold of the low talk that abounds or percerlates
  through Camden Town. Bogey is a tea-leaf: we all know that, but tea- leafs
  act honourable in their sportin' transactions&mdash;see Palmer, the well-
  known Rugby doctor who poisoned his bookmaker rather than knock him."</p>

  <p>"Rugeley," murmured The Miller.</p>

  <p>"Wherever it was. Bogey Jones is a Twister. If he ever gets married he'll
  have a family of corkscrews."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he'll return the money," suggested The Miller.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans made a noise like a meditative duck.</p>

  <p>"As the well-known W. Shakespeare said to Lord What's-his- name&mdash;him
  that got his napper cut off for takin' a liberty with Queen Elizabeth, the
  so-called Vergers Queen because she used to go to church so often&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused, having missed the path. "Shakespeare," prompted The Miller.</p>

  <p>"... As he said one day when him an' David Garrick the well-known artist
  who painted Lady Godiva, The Woman They Couldn't Shingle, her that did the
  bare-back ride down Coventry Street to advertise the Back Ache
  pills&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He reached a cross road.</p>

  <p>"Shakespeare," murmured The Miller.</p>

  <p>"As Shakespeare said&mdash;you can't expect nothin' from a pig but a
  grunt."</p>

  <p>Evans took out the stump of a cigar, sneered at it and put it back in his
  face.</p>

  <p>"I'll GET Bogey," he said.</p>

  <p>"In the meantime you've been got," said The Miller gently, "and it is your
  own fault." Inspector Challoner reproved him. "Imagine a man like you, as
  wide as Broad Street, giving Bogey a five-pound note and asking him to bring
  you the change in the morning. It is inexplicable!"</p>

  <p>The Miller had a line of classy words of four and five syllables that was
  the admiration of High Street, Camden Town.</p>

  <p>"It may be ines&mdash;what you said," retorted Evans hotly, "but the
  money's gone."</p>

  <p>The Miller frowned and eyed him curiously.</p>

  <p>"There is something at the back of this act of guileless trust on your
  part," he said. "A woman!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans went red and spluttered.</p>

  <p>"A woman!"</p>

  <p>"A lady!" protested Mr. Evans passionately. "A lady of title an' as pure
  as a driven snowball! If you want to know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't&mdash;" The Miller's manner was pointed. "Scandal has never
  interested me."</p>

  <p>Evans looked round as though he expected to discover an army of secret
  service agents waiting to note his words.</p>

  <p>"I gave that fiver to Bogey to Save a Woman's Name."</p>

  <p>"And you got no change," said the practical officer. "I don't think that
  you came off very well."</p>

  <p>Evans shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It was the Price I Paid for Honour," he said mysteriously.</p>

  <p>The Miller was thoroughly interested.</p>

  <p>"If you'll stop talking like the pictures and get right down to solid
  earth, I'll give you a round of applause," he said.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Evans smiled cryptically.</p>

  <p>"Aristocracy," he said simply.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Evans learned by accident that her ladyship had been ordered
  by her indignant husband to close her two modest bookmakers' accounts (the
  accounts were modest, not the bookmakers), and then one night there came to
  him a mysterious message.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">DEAR MR. EVONS,&mdash;I must tell you somethink of great
  importance. My husband will be out to-night conducting his orkystra. Expect
  me about 10.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours truly,</p>

  <p class="letter">LADY TAKERLIT.</p>

  <p class="letter">P.S.&mdash;Don't let anybody come popping in after I pop
  in."</p><br>

  <p>At ten o'clock that night a mysterious figure might have been seen
  flitting into Bayham Mews. It was not seen as a matter of fact, because it
  was a rainy night and nobody was particularly interested even in mysterious
  figures. But Evans waited at the top of the stairs. The light was turned low
  in his room, and he experienced all the agreeable sensations of a
  conspirator. There was, too, a thrill in it.</p>

  <p>Her ladyship mounted the stairs cautiously, as she had become a woman of
  weight, and panted into Mr. Evans' bureau in an agitated state. Evans closed
  the door&mdash;the curtains were already pulled&mdash;and then he turned up
  the light.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Evons"&mdash;she was on the verge of tears&mdash;"I feel I've got
  to speak to a Man about his Goings On! I'll divorce him, Mr. Evons! I won't
  be trod on like a worm. I've stood it long enough."</p>

  <p>"It's a long worm that has no turning," said Evans seriously. "What has
  his lordship been doing, my ladyship?"</p>

  <p>She sat down breathlessly on a chair, and as breathlessly related the
  story of a letter, discovered by accident, as all such letters are
  discovered, whilst she was searching his pockets for papers of a greater
  monetary value.</p>

  <p>"I'll divorce him before the Lord Chief Justice his own self!" said her
  ladyship tremulously. "He's a low, common Hungarian from Austria, and I
  bemeaned myself by marrying him! I'll get almony out of him, too. This comes
  of his mixing up with low, common chorus-girls. All musical people are alike,
  Mr. Evons: they don't know where to stop, and even if they do, they
  don't."</p>

  <p>Evans listened gravely, shook his head, uttered tut-tuts of surprise and
  horror, and when she had exhausted her denunciations of musical genius, she
  unburdened her soul on a matter which was much more important.</p>

  <p>"I told you I'd give you a tip, Mr. Evons, and I will," she added
  vehemently. "We had one of them&mdash;those, I mean: forgive me being
  unladylike&mdash;trainers up to lunch to-day, and whether Boski's told 'em or
  not I don't know, but they never speak about horses in front of me. But I did
  hear something." She nodded more emphatically than ever. "It's going to win
  at Newbury. It's the biggest certainty of the year. In fact, Mr. Evons," she
  said, "this horse can't lose. You never heard of a horse like that?"</p>

  <p>Evans had heard of horses like that, and had frequently described them in
  his optimistic circulars.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear the name, my ladyship?" he asked:</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, that's where the&mdash;where my husband was artful. The only thing I
  know is this"&mdash; she spoke slowly and deliberately&mdash;"the horse runs
  on Wednesday, and the name of the horse is the name of a piece he's playing
  as an extra on Tuesday night at the Queen's 'All&mdash;Hall, I mean; I'm so
  upset that I don't know even how to speak grammar. That's what Boski said
  when they whispered it to him."</p>

  <p>"It'll be on the programme," said Evans thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, they never put the names of the extras on the programme, but it'll be
  after the third piece is played. He's bound to get an encore, and then he'll
  play this other piece. It's operatic &mdash;that's all I know."</p>

  <p>Evans considered.</p>

  <p>"The Merry Widder?" he said.</p>

  <p>She didn't think it was the Merry Widder.</p>

  <p>" 'I'll take you back if you want to come back?' " suggested Evans, going
  rapidly through his repertory.</p>

  <p>"Is there a horse called that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Evans had to admit there wasn't.</p>

  <p>"We'll easily find out. Go to the hall the night before, and anybody will
  tell you what it is. And, Mr. Evons, will you put a ten-pound note on for
  me?"</p>

  <p>She produced the ten-pound note. Evans waved it aside and continued waving
  until she showed an inclination to replace the money in her bag. He stopped
  it half-way.</p>

  <p>"I'll learn him!" said her ladyship, quivering with annoyance. "The Pretty
  Beauty!"</p>

  <p>In this vague and unsatisfactory way did Educated Evans become possessed
  of the gem of the year.</p>

  <p>She left him in a studious mood. She was going to divorce her husband; and
  her ladyship had looked kindly upon him. There was an understanding between
  them...</p>

  <p>Evans walked to the wall and looked into the four square inches of cracked
  mirror. He wasn't bad looking, he confessed; he was on the right side of
  fifty, and he was a man of fame and education.</p>

  <p>The next day he sounded The Miller as to the propriety of marrying a
  divorcée.</p>

  <p>"Not that I'm a marrying man," he said, "and as for titles&mdash;bah!" He
  snapped his fingers. "I don't want to marry just for the sake of being Lord
  Evans...."</p>

  <p>The Miller explained gently that marrying a knight's lost lady would not
  entitle Mr. Evans to a seat in the House of Lords.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't it?" The educated man was obviously disappointed.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said The Miller. "you thought it would look fine on the
  circulars.</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">LORD EDUCATED EVANS,<br>
  The World's Champion Turf Prophet.<br>
  Address all money orders<br>
  c/o the Lord Chancellor.</p><br>

  <p>But it can't be done."</p>

  <p>Evans shrugged.</p>

  <p>"I'm a Socialist meself," he said, "practically red. Me an'
  Sakker&mdash;what's his name&mdash;are like brothers."</p>

  <p>He did not tell his friend anything about the musical horse. Indeed, he
  kept his secret locked in his own narrow chest; for secrets have a habit of
  leaking out, and the Lubeses, who ran Old Sam's Midnight Special, sent forth
  from day to day crowds of spies and informers to discover and anticipate the
  substance of his £5 Specials.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans knew nothing about music, except that it was a pleasing noise
  made by barrel organs. And naturally he was not particularly well versed in
  operatic selections. He looked up the newspaper, saw that Sir Boski Takerlit
  was conducting the New Brighton Symphony Orchestra, but the programme told
  him nothing. He had never heard of a horse called "Three Dances from Henry
  VIII.," nor did he know of any animal who answered to the name of
  "Rachmaninoff's Prelude." He settled himself down to prepare for the great
  coup, got out his circular complete, leaving only a space into which he would
  insert, by means of a rubber stamp, the name of this unparalleled
  quadruped.</p>

  <p>The Miller met him when, arrayed for the evening, with his pockets stuffed
  with handbills advertising his virtues as a finder of winners (for, as Mr.
  Evans argued, you never know what business might be brought in by a few bills
  dropped judiciously in a public place) and wearing the famous plaid trousers
  and gold pin, he sallied forth to an evening's entertainment.</p>

  <p>"Music?" said The Miller incredulously. "I didn't know you had any tastes
  in that direction &mdash;or are you going to take a peep at the injured
  husband?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to get a little information," said Evans mysteriously. "And as
  for music, it's education, ain't it? The well-known and highly respected
  Mozart who wrote the Moonlight Sonata&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But The Miller had passed on.</p>

  <p>He found the Queen's Hall, a handsome place of entertainment, crowded when
  he arrived and, with great reluctance, paid for his seat.</p>

  <p>"If you <i>are</i> Press," said the manager, "I'll admit you, but what
  paper do you represent?"</p>

  <p>"I won't argue," said Evans loftily. "What's the cheapest seat you've got?
  For two pins I wouldn't go in and report your music at all."</p>

  <p>Eventually he found a seat at five shillings on the floor of the house,
  and made his way in with a look of disparagement on his face. He was
  fortunate enough to get an aisle seat in a row half-way between back and
  front, and for an hour he listened uncomprehendingly to a succession of
  musical acrobatics. Standing on a little platform in front of his orchestra
  was Sir Boski Takerlit, whom he recognised instantly.</p>

  <p>"A bit of swank, ain't it?" he asked his neighbour, an aesthetic young man
  with horn-rimmed spectacles. "Him standing up there so that everybody can see
  him?"</p>

  <p>The young man was startled and made no reply.</p>

  <p>"It's what I call gettin' yourself in the limelight," said Evans, warming
  up on the subject. "It's pushin' yourself forward."</p>

  <p>The young man maintained his silence but edged a little farther away from
  the companion which the booking-office had thrust upon him.</p>

  <p>"It only shows what a dirty dog he is," said Evans. "He don't play
  nothin', he simply sits up there an' chucks his arms about, and when people
  clap he starts bowing an' scraping as if he did it all."</p>

  <p>"I don't wish to speak with you," said the young man in a very elegant
  voice.</p>

  <p>The applause that greeted the third piece was deafening. Evans joined in,
  because he was anxious that the encore should be given.</p>

  <p>There was no announcement: the piece started with a thunderous beating of
  drums. Evans in frantic anxiety turned to the studious young man.</p>

  <p>"What's the name of this bit?" he asked. The young gentleman ignored his
  insistence. "Do you mind tellin' me what's the name of this song they're
  playing of?" quavered Evans. The young man turned in a fury.</p>

  <p>"If you don't leave me alone I'll send for an attendant and have you
  turned out," he said.</p>

  <p>People were scowling at the educated man and twisting their necks round
  and glaring at him, in the way typical of all music-lovers. Evans began to
  perspire.</p>

  <p>Eight hundred and four envelopes, all addressed and all stamped. Eight
  hundred and four circulars, ready to receive the imprint of this gem of the
  year. And what it was, heaven only knew!</p>

  <p>And then a wild resolve came to him&mdash;an inspiration. He rose and
  walked swiftly along the aisle. Before him was a short flight of steps
  leading to the platform, and above this two more steps to the rostrum where
  Sir Boski, unconscious of the coming interruption, was waving his baton
  ecstatically. In a stride Evans was on the platform; in another, he was
  peering over the shoulder of the outraged conductor.</p>

  <p>Low murmurs arose from the hall; a voice cried "Chuck him out!" And then
  he saw the word on the top of the page...</p>

  <p>Fortissimo!</p>

  <p>With a chortle of triumph he turned as a red-faced attendant grabbed him
  by the collar and dragged him to the aisle. He had a dim vision of
  royal-looking personages surveying him with amused interest. And then another
  hand gripped him and he was dragged towards the door. One disengaged hand he
  thrust into his pocket, grabbed a bundle of handbills and flung them wide. A
  few seconds later he struck the pavement of Wigmore Street with a dull,
  sickening thud.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans rose with a beatific smile, waved a cheery hand to the
  attendant, and shuffled off. The musician's secret was his!</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The next evening The Miller came to see him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I know Fortissimo won. But, you poor piece of cheese,
  Fortissimo isn't the name of a musical piece, it's a direction meaning
  'louder.' Obviously the horse was Lohengrin&mdash;that was the piece they
  played. And Lohengrin was pipped on the post by a short head...
  Fortissimo!"</p>

  <p>Evans closed his eyes and smiled.</p>

  <p>"What a beauty, what a beauty!" he murmured. "Straight from the trumpet's
  mouth!"</p>

  <p class="first">MRS. LUBE had a cousin, a young man who had done well for
  himself. He was in fact an educated man, being one of those teachers at
  elementary schools who do so much to imbue the young idea with ultra-
  Socialistic principles. When the Lubeses talked of Cousin Arthur they did so
  in hushed tones. His portrait hung in every Lube parlour, including the
  parlour of that Lube who had been sent to Canada by the late Dr.
  Barnardo.</p>

  <p>Cousin Arthur very infrequently visited his relations, for he lived in a
  magnificent semi-detached villa at Streatham, but when he did he gave ample
  warning and the parlour was dusted, the loo-table polished and a fire was
  lit. This latter being an important event, for, as everybody knows, the fire
  is never lit in the parlour except on Christmas and Boxing Days, for which
  occasion all the antimacassars are removed and carefully folded away.</p>

  <p>He came after due notice and was received in the manner of a reigning
  prince paying a state visit to a feudal dependant. That is to say, Mrs. Lube
  bought crumpets for tea and a bottle of Gilbey's port wine&mdash;the
  genteelest of all refreshments.</p>

  <p>Arthur Stickleburn was a young man who wore pince-nez, a little yellow
  moustache, a red necktie to proclaim his abhorrence of capital, and a heavy
  gold watch-chain to emphasise his affluence. He had a ready smile, was
  affable to Mrs. Lube, gravely respectful to Old Sam (who sat in a corner, his
  hands clasped over his stomach and his beery eyes glued to the bottle of
  port), and comradely to Mr. Lube.</p>

  <p>After they had thoroughly and exhaustively discussed all the relations who
  had died since they met last, and what sort of funerals they had had, Mrs.
  Lube told him some of her troubles. And in the front rank of these was
  Educated Evans.</p>

  <p>"And of all the perjurous hounds that <i>ever</i> lived, Arthur&mdash;if
  you'll excuse my language&mdash;there's nobody like him. An' me strugglin' on
  with three mouths to feed, and him a bachelor, makin' money hand over fist
  an' gettin' winners...."</p>

  <p>Cousin Arthur was amused.</p>

  <p>"Educated, is he? In what direction&mdash;philosophy, science, archæology,
  philology&mdash;?"<br>
  None of these sounded familiar to Mrs. Lube. She explained her
  difficulties.</p>

  <p>"H'm! I seem to remember having heard of the fellow," mused Cousin Arthur,
  stroking his weak chin thoughtfully. "I wish I could spare the time to deal
  with this person. Educated! I don't suppose he has ever read a line of John
  Stuart Mills or heard of the Binomial Theorem."</p>

  <p>"Whose horse is that?" asked Mrs. Lube hopefully.</p>

  <p>Cousin Arthur smiled.</p>

  <p>"It is not a horse&mdash;it is a Calculus," he said, and then, after
  frowning consideration "Psychology is what you want," he said. "Fortunately
  that is my pet study. Tell me something more of this man and I may get his
  Psychology."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Luke shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You'd never get anything out of him," she said. "He's so mean, he uses
  his tea-leaves twice!"</p>

  <p>Cousin Arthur explained, as far as she was able to comprehend, just what
  he meant. He elaborated his plan, grew enthusiastic with its growth.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">A week later the news went forth to Camden Town of Mrs.
  Lube's dire straits, and naturally Detective-Inspector Challoner, who was the
  repository of all fairy stories, came to learn of her domestic trials.</p>

  <p>There comes to most men to whom fate has been unexpectedly kind, a large
  and glowing sense of benevolence. Toby Walker, drawing fifty shillings from
  Issy Issyheim over a successful up-and-downer, enters the saloon bar of the
  "Red Lion," nods genially to the assembled company, and the glad cry of
  "What's yours?" falls upon grateful ear-holes. Mr. Issy Issyheim, on his
  annual visit to Monte Carlo, struts forth from the Cercle Privée and throws a
  mille note to a chance acquaintance with a nod and a smile; one suspects M.
  Blanc, the guv'nor of the rooms, to disperse his doings in a similar glad
  spirit of munificence.</p>

  <p>Educated Evans was in that mood which is so acceptable to the importunate
  ear-biter when the news of the Lubeses' misfortune came to him. He had sent
  out three winners in succession, and the majority of his satisfied clientele
  had acted honourable. With crinkling banknotes in his pouch and the peace of
  God in his heart, he strolled forth into the snowy wastes of High Street,
  Camden Town, reconciled even to the inevitable abandonment of the Windsor
  meeting. And opposite the "Nag's Head," whom should he pop up against but The
  Miller, a frozen straw gripped between his teeth and his face a little redder
  than usual.</p>

  <p>"Heard about Mrs. Lube?" asked The Miller.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to hear anything about them Lubeses, Mr. Challoner," said
  Evans loftily. "They take the low road and I take the high, as the good book
  says, an' we never meet. Socially they're not in my set. As Richloo, the
  celebrated French clergyman, said to Cardinal Valtaire when they was in
  France: <i>'Demi-tasse, demi-monde,'</i> which means that one half of the
  world don't know how the other half drinks and the other half don't
  care."</p>

  <p>"She is ill," said The Miller, a little dazed by the erudition of his
  learned friend.</p>

  <p>"Poomonica?" asked Evans, interested.</p>

  <p>"No, not pneumonia&mdash;if that is what you mean&mdash;nervous breakdown.
  Old Sam's broke, and her husband's run away with the barmaid at the 'Cow and
  Garter'."</p>

  <p>"Not the red-haired one?" Evans was fascinated by the news.</p>

  <p>"I don't know the colour of her hair," retorted The Miller impatiently.
  "But she is certainly&mdash;Mrs. Lube I mean&mdash;down and out."</p>

  <p>Evans made a faint tut-tutting noise.</p>

  <p>"It had to be," he said complacently. "I kill all competition. Information
  v. gaswork. Knowin' v. pickin' 'em out with a pin. I got one that's runnin'
  on Tuesday that's past the post! Tryin' for the first time since last year's
  National. This horse is fourteen pound better than Ruddygore an' ten pound
  better than Silvo&mdash;an' he's in a seller! I got him from the boy who does
  him."</p>

  <p>Mr. Challoner's concern for the unhappy Mrs Lube momentarily
  evaporated.</p>

  <p>"What's this&mdash;Ned Carver?" he asked, with provocative sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"Ned Carver's gone to stud," said Evans, unperturbed by the implied
  scepticism. "So has Bart Snowball and Sergeant Murphy."</p>

  <p>The Miller explained certain reasons why none of these horses was likely
  to make successful sires.</p>

  <p>"It's a shame to treat horses like that," said Evans severely. "Anyway,
  this horse I'm tellin' you about is goin' for the coop of the year. You know
  Sarkles the trainer&mdash;he's hot. Whenever a horse of his wants a poultice
  he just leans against 'em."</p>

  <p>"Sarkles? Then it's Bonny Whitelegs you're talking about?"</p>

  <p>Evans wagged his head in annoyance.</p>

  <p>"I ought to wear a muzzle," he said; "but you'll keep this to yourself,
  Mr. Challoner? This is the biggest coop that ever looked through a saddle.
  Keep it quiet and we'll get eightses to our money."</p>

  <p>The Miller made a mental note and reverted to the subject of Mrs.
  Lube.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know that she is no friend of yours," he interrupted Mr. Evans'
  protest, "but she's a woman."</p>

  <p>"So was Lewdcreature Burgia, the female Crippen," said Evans bitterly. "So
  was Cleopatra, whose needle we all admire; so was B&mdash; Mary who done in
  the princes in the well-known Tower by pourin' poison in their earholes! So
  was Catherine, the celebrated Queen of Russia, who massacred all the
  in-patients of Bartholomew's Hospital because they wouldn't have any truck
  with the Hugenuts; so was Mrs. Manning, who was hung in a blue silk dress at
  Horse-monger Lane Gaol for murderin' her nine little children&mdash;see
  Dickens!"</p>

  <p>He might at that moment wash his hands of the Lubeses, dismiss them to the
  outer oblivion, shrug them into the infinite spaces where wander The People
  Who Don't Count; but in the cosy comfort, not to say fug, of his bureau at
  Desert Chief House, and what time he smoked a good cigar before a blazing
  fire, the thought of his sick enemy came back to him and his conscience
  stirred uneasily.</p>

  <p>On his new table were stacked five hundred and forty stamped, addressed
  envelopes. Into these shortly would be inserted the circular already printed,
  advertising the merits of Bonny Whitelegs. In his skyrocket a wad of notes
  rustled musically every time he crossed his legs. And in that dark and
  saddened home lay a woman deserted by the man to whom she had given her hand
  and confided her destiny.</p>

  <p>Evans sighed. And then a formless thought took shape.</p>

  <p>He went out into the chill night with a basket, and procured from Higgs's,
  the grocers, a jar of invalid jelly, a dozen new-laid eggs, a packet of
  oatmeal and various other luxuries associated in his mind with the effective
  treatment of sickness.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In the kitchen of Mrs. Lube's house sat Old Sam, Young Alf
  Lube and the partner of his joys and sorrows. Old Sam was asleep, and, by the
  happy smile that transfigured the patriarchal face, it was easy to suppose
  that he was dreaming of strong drink.</p>

  <p>"It's a bit rough on me," grumbled Mr. Lube, "poked up in the house all
  day and night waitin' for Evans to come&mdash;a silly idea I call it."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube bridled.</p>

  <p>"What about me?" she demanded. "Every time there's a knock at the door do
  I have to go into the parlour an' lay on the sofa or don't I? Answer me."</p>

  <p>"Silly idea!" gloomed Alfred. "As if this Sy &mdash;whatever the word
  is&mdash;is goin' to bring Evans here. An' what about my reputation? Me
  supposed to have run away from you with a common barmaid!"</p>

  <p>"You seem to bear up all right," she said.</p>

  <p>"Do I? Suppose <i>she</i> gets to hear of it&mdash;what's she goin' to
  say?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube stiffened.</p>

  <p>"She&mdash;which 'she,' I'd like to know?"</p>

  <p>Alfred Lube was embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"Well... whoever it is. I don't know her myself, never so much as said
  'How d'ye do' to her. But she's got her feelin's, the same as the rest of
  us."</p>

  <p>"Barmaids haven't got any feelin's," said Mrs. Lube, her suspicious eyes
  on her husband. "You seem to think a lot about what she'll think,
  Alfred!"</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes wearily.</p>

  <p>"Whose idea was it&mdash;did I say anything about runnin' away with
  barmaids? Wasn't it your cousin Arthur with his Sy&mdash;something?"</p>

  <p>"Don't speak a word about my cousin," she said with acerbity. "This
  sy-sausagy, or whatever it is, can't be wrong. He couldn't harbour a wrong
  thought."</p>

  <p>"What's it mean?" demanded Mr. Lube.</p>

  <p>"Findin' out&mdash;it's a new way," said Mrs. Lube, and at that moment
  there was a gentlemanly knock at the door.</p>

  <p>It was opened to Mr. Evans by a small boy who wore a black tie. Evans
  thought for a moment that his purchases would be on his hands.</p>

  <p>"Mother's ill," said the sepulchral child. "So's grandfa'r."</p>

  <p>A husky voice from the parlour asked "Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Evans, Mrs. Lube," said the educated man loudly.</p>

  <p>"Come in."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans removed his hat reverently and tiptoed into the parlour. On a
  sofa drawn up by the fire lay Mrs. Lube. She wore her oldest dress and there
  was a bandage round her head.</p>

  <p>"Come in, do, Mr. Evans," she moaned. "I suppose you've come to gloat over
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Far be it from me to gloat," said the virtuous Evans, "but as an educated
  man it's me duty to do unto others as I'm done by. I've brought you a few
  things."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube glanced sideways at the articles which her visitor put upon the
  table, spreading them out so that none might escape her attention.</p>

  <p>"Set down, Mr. Evans&mdash;Willie, go out into the kitchen and don't make
  a row or I'll break your neck!"</p>

  <p>Willie withdrew and slammed the door. Mr. Evans sat on the edge of a
  chair, a look of condolence and sympathy on his face.</p>

  <p>"We all ought to stand together," he said. "Misfortune, as the saying
  goes, makes cowards of us all. What's the matter with you, Mrs. Lube?"</p>

  <p>"Internal," she said.</p>

  <p>Evans coughed and was silent He was not a family man.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I'm Here for Long," she added. Evans made a noise
  expressing his sorrow. "Well," he said, "we can't expect to live for ever.
  You've had your life&mdash;what are you, Mrs. Lube, about forty-five?"</p>

  <p>"Thirty-three!" she snarled. "What's the idea of forty- five?"</p>

  <p>She mastered her emotion with an effort, but Mr. Evans was not put
  out.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you get light-headed when you're ill," he said. "I remember you
  twenty years ago an' you was no chicken then. Anyway, you've had your
  life&mdash;we all have to go sooner or later. Lube's run away?"</p>

  <p>She nodded: she could not trust herself to speak.</p>

  <p>"I think it must be with the red-haired one," meditated Evans. "I always
  guessed there was something wrong ever since I saw 'em coming out of the
  Pictures together."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube sat up suddenly.</p>

  <p>"When was this?" she demanded fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Must have been a month ago," said Evans. "But don't agitate yourself,
  Mrs. Lube&mdash;after all, he's a younger man than you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's four years older!" she stormed.</p>

  <p>"Men keep young longer than women," said Evans soothingly. "As the
  well-known Julius Caesar the Eyetalian said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind about him!" interrupted Mrs. Lube. "You say you saw him with a
  barmaid at the Pictures, do you&mdash;the dirty dog!"</p>

  <p>"Set your mind on Heaven," said the educated man gently. "You know the
  worst, Mrs. Lube. He's gone&mdash;forget him. Can I do anything for you?"</p>

  <p>It was then that Mrs. Lube remembered that she was being far too energetic
  for a person in <i>extremis</i>. She accordingly relaxed into her role of
  interesting invalid.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Evans, there is nothing you can do for me," she said faintly.
  "I'm sure I'm much obliged to you for the 'am&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jelly," murmured Evans.</p>

  <p>"You're very kind. Before I passed, as it were, I'd like to have sent out
  a winner&mdash;but what's the use? We're ruined, me an' my poor dear
  grandfather&mdash;no clients&mdash;no money for paper, no
  stamps&mdash;nothing. I don't want to send it out, only just to know it."</p>

  <p>Evans considered the matter deeply. Here was a woman, in a manner of
  speaking, on the very edge of Tophet. Basely deserted, starving, as it were,
  and wanting one gleam of sunshine which he was in a position to radiate. And
  yet&mdash;</p>

  <p>"How's Old Sam?" he asked.</p>

  <p>''Ill in bed&mdash;not expected to recover&mdash;business gone, Alf
  gone&mdash;everything gone," she wailed.</p>

  <p>Evans took the plunge. Leaning over her, he hissed</p>

  <p>"Bonny Whitelegs&mdash;help yourself an' tell the angels!"</p>

  <p>She opened her eyes wide.</p>

  <p>"Him?" she said doubtingly.</p>

  <p>"Got it from the boy that does him&mdash;a lad called 'Orace&mdash;nex'
  Wednesday. Keep it to yourself, Mrs. Lube, an' have a real good win. You
  ought to have a bit of money to leave to your children!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube breathed deeply.</p>

  <p>"Oh, if I could only believe that," she whispered, "I'd pass peaceful! You
  sendin' it out, Mr. Evans?"</p>

  <p>"Tuesday night&mdash;late," he said briskly. "Now don't leave it to him
  an' his carrotty girl, Mrs. Lube. She's had enough from what I've heard.
  Three pun' ten he paid for the di'mond bracelet she was wearin' of when I see
  her last&mdash;an' the hat he bought her at Stibbinses!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube was very pale; her eyelids fluttered furiously.</p>

  <p>"Bracelet...." Her voice sounded strangled. Mr. Evans thought the end was
  near. "Hat... three pun' ten!"</p>

  <p>She's wandering, thought Evans, and tiptoed out of the room.</p>

  <p>The door had hardly closed upon him when Mr. Lube, smoking a cigarette
  before the kitchen fire, heard his wife's firm footfall in the passage. And
  then the door opened and she entered.</p>

  <p>"Did you find out anything&mdash;" he began, and then he saw her face,
  and, swift to move, dodged the jar of invalid jelly.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">On the Thursday:</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Lube has made a good recovery," said The Miller.</p>

  <p>Educated Evans looked at him pained&mdash;for the time being
  speechless.</p>

  <p>"And Bonny Whitelegs&mdash;what a beauty!" said The Miller. "I had forty
  pound to five. And I presume that all clients old and new received this
  gem?"</p>

  <p>Evans shook his head and found his voice.</p>

  <p>"At three-thirty on the afternoon of Tuesday the fourteenth ult," he began
  dreamily (and obviously it was a bad dream), "I was sittin' or reclinin' in
  my chair when I had a telegram&mdash;'Don't send out Bonny Whitelegs,
  Horace.' I ought to have known," he mused, "that it was a swindle or
  imposture, but me bein' what I am, I put it aside an' said 'Another day.' An'
  he won... an' the Lubeses sent it out to all clients new an old. An' Alf Lube
  sent the wire from Marlborough because a friend of mine see him gettin' into
  the rattler at Paddin'ton with a black eye an' a lip as big as a cushion...
  my horse...!"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Lube&mdash;" began The Miller.</p>

  <p>"Is alive." Evans nodded gravely and pointed to the black armlet about his
  sleeve. "She's alive&mdash;ain't I in mournin'?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story9"
     name="story9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE SHOWING UP OF EDUCATED EVANS</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was unfortunate that Mr. Yevers, the landlord of the "Cow
  and Garter," loathed Educated Evans with a deadly loathing. Mr. Yevers
  himself was an uneducated man. At best he could only affix his name to the
  south-east corner of a cheque with the very greatest labour. As for reading,
  when anybody pointed out a paragraph in the newspaper he invariably replied:
  "Read it out&mdash;I've mislaid me glasses."</p>

  <p>His career had been a romantic one. Starting as a small boy, penniless and
  friendless, he had worked his way up to be first the barman and then the
  manager of the biggest house in North London. And as this was in the days
  before the coming of the cash register, Mr Yevers had diligently acquired
  sufficient money. With his savings he purchased his master's business (when
  that gentleman went into Carey Street as a result of his carelessness and the
  dishonesty of his subordinates), and by the application of his industry and a
  little fencing on the side, he attained to wealth beyond the dreams of
  actresses.</p>

  <p>He was a self-made man, and had nobody else to blame for it.</p>

  <p>He hated Evans primarily because of his education, but particularly
  because Evans, in an argumentative moment, had unconsciously betrayed Mr.
  Yevers' shortcomings.</p>

  <p>It was over the old vexed question as to when the Thames was frozen last,
  and on what date a coach and four was driven across at London Bridge.</p>

  <p>"I remember it as a boy," said Mr. Yevers, who never would admit that
  anything happened before he was born.</p>

  <p>"You're mistaken, sir," said Evans, courteously enough. "It was in 1452 in
  the reign of Good Queen Anne, the celebrated dead lady&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I remember it as a boy," asseverated Mr. Yevers hotly.</p>

  <p>"If you can read&mdash;" began Evans, meaning nothing ill.</p>

  <p>Mr. Yevers went a dark blue and pointed to the door of the saloon bar.</p>

  <p>"Get out of my house before I kick you out!" he said.</p>

  <p>And because great minds brood upon little things, Mr. Yevers brooded upon
  the affront which had been offered him by a man who, as he rightly said,
  hadn't as much brass to his name as Mr. Yevers took in the bottle and jug
  department in one day.</p>

  <p>"How was I to know he couldn't read or write?" protested Evans to The
  Miller. "The ignorance of the lower orders is simply remarkable and
  stupefying. I've no desire to hurt the man's feelings. He's a bung, an' I
  can't say anything worse to him than that."</p>

  <p>"You've lost a client," said The Miller.</p>

  <p>Evans smiled sardonically.</p>

  <p>"Three times a year, and I have to take me winnings in beer, which is
  repugnant to me, being a gentlemanly spirit drinker. Or a bottle of port wine
  from the wood and made of it! I've wiped him off me books."</p>

  <p>The Miller, the champion pacifier of Camden Town, succeeded in reconciling
  the ruffled Mr. Yevers. Unfortunately for all concerned, the reconciliation
  coincided with a period when things were going badly with Mr. Yevers. He had
  in two new barmen and a sub-manager in a month. But such is the mechanical
  mind of the present generation that the seemingly insuperable difficulties
  presented by the cash register were overcome by all three of them, each in
  his own way. And then, in a moment of insanity, Mr. Yevers decided to have a
  plunge on a horse whispered confidentially across the zinc.</p>

  <p>He went down to Lingfield to see the horse run; was genial, almost
  convivial, until...</p>

  <p>As the field came into the straight with Jiggling Jimmie ten lengths
  ahead, Mr. Evans turned to his companion with a shrug.</p>

  <p>"Information v. gas-work,'' he stated briefly. Knowledge v. pickin' 'em
  out of a hat! As I told you, Mr. Challoner, this here Jiggling Jimmie could
  fall down&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He has!" said The Miller.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans opened his eyes arid glared through his glasses.</p>

  <p>"That ain't Jiggling Jimmie... yes, it is... no, it ain't... yes, it
  is."</p>

  <p>"Shall I say 'when'?" asked the sympathetic Miller. "Tough luck,
  Evans!'</p>

  <p>Tough luck it was, for Jiggling Jimmy, having fallen and dislodged his
  rider, was still leading the field as it passed the post.</p>

  <p>Educated Evans threw his race-card on the asphalt of Tattersall's, jumped
  on it, lifted his nose in a bitter sneer, and sent his glasses back in his
  case with a crash; it was the gesture of a defeated warrior sheathing his
  sword.</p>

  <p>"That horse was tried twenty-one pound better than Jerry M. and two stone
  better than Tom Pinch," he began. "An' to think that&mdash;what did win it?"
  he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Cat's Eyes," replied The Miller, and Mr. Evans breathed heavily through
  his nostrils.</p>

  <p>"Old Sam's Three-Star Nap!" he said hollowly. "Is that luck or ain't it?
  Was Cat's Eyes on the map? I'm asking you."</p>

  <p>"I heard you," said The Miller, as they made their way towards the
  rattler. "It is sad&mdash;but it is racing, Evans. Such things happen."</p>

  <p>Evans had forgotten all about Mr. Yevers' existence in the passionate
  despair of the moment, and when that blue-faced man confronted him on the
  platform he was dumbfounded by the injustice of the attack.</p>

  <p>"Tipster!" he roared. "You bring me down here and make me have monkeys on
  horses that can't stand up on their own legs! Why, Old Sam's worth a million
  of you&mdash;two million," he amended generously.</p>

  <p>In the face of such vulgarity Evans could merely shrug his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Speaking as an educated man&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"You're a fake!" howled Mr. Yevers, shaking his fist in the face of
  erudition. "You don't know nothing about nothing and never did!"</p>

  <p>A most persistent patron of the "Cow and Garter" was one Old Sam, editor
  of the Midnight Special, whose three-star nap had won the race. To him Mr.
  Yevers confided his woes in the condescending way which publicans have with
  their moister clients. Old Sam sighed and shook his head in his melancholy
  way.</p>

  <p>"You'd better by half have stuck to me. What won the race, Mr.
  Yevers?"</p>

  <p>"Cat's Eyes."</p>

  <p>"That's a good horse," nodded Sam soberly, though he wasn't. "As nice a
  horse as ever looked through a collar."</p>

  <p>"You tipped it," said Mr. Yevers.</p>

  <p>Old Sam scratched his nose.</p>

  <p>"Did I?" he said. There was a note of genuine surprise. "Why, of course I
  did! Bless my soul, I've give so many winners that I don't know what I
  tipped."</p>

  <p>"As for his education!" said Mr. Yevers.</p>

  <p>Sam smiled.</p>

  <p>"He gets it out of a book," he said confidentially. "I know: he used to be
  a partner of mine. He gets it all out of a book. Not his ideas at all."</p>

  <p>Now the idea of showing up Educated Evans might have gone no further but
  for the fact that Mr. Yevers was called away to a sick relation in a little
  country town; and as the man owed him a bit of money, and, moreover, since
  there was no written acknowledgment of the debt (this was the principal cause
  of anxiety), Mr. Yevers thought it advisable to call on his relation and
  secure from him an acknowledgment that at any rate his executors would
  honour....</p>

  <p>This took time, because the sick man was also a very obstinate man, and
  one of the symptoms of his disease was an extraordinary lapse of memory, so
  that he could not recall any time when he had ever borrowed money.</p>

  <p>The matter satisfactorily settled, Mr. Yevers found time hanging on his
  hands, and went into a small music-hall. And there he saw on the stage the
  most charming young lady, who answered the most abstruse and difficult
  questions fired at her from the audience with an alacrity which almost
  suggested that she had some good friends in the audience. He asked the man on
  his right the name of the lady, and learnt that she was Lizo, the Human
  Encyclopaedia, and later, having a drink at the bar with the manager, he
  learnt that Lizo wasn't as successful as he would have expected her to
  be.</p>

  <p>"It's out of date, that sort of turn," said the manager. "People are not
  interested in ancient history since the War."</p>

  <p>An idea flashed through Mr. Yevers' mind. He learnt the girl's salary, and
  interviewed her in a dressing-room and discovered to his joy that she had
  once graced the private bar of a high-class establishment in the West
  End.</p>

  <p>He engaged her on the spot.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The "Cow and Garter" was not a House that was a particular
  favourite of Educated Evans, and even the arrival of Miss Betty, the new and
  even more golden-headed-than-usual barmaid, did not attract him, though the
  fame of her spread throughout Camden Town. For beauty, as Mr. Evans remarked
  originally, is but skin deep and very often not that.</p>

  <p>"What's comin' to young ladies nowadays, Mr. Challoner, I can't
  understand," he said in despair. "What with paint and powder an' doin' up
  their eyelashes with blackin' an' jinglin' their hair and what not, they beat
  me!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder," mused The Miller, "if you are as good a judge of beauty as you
  are of horses? Because, if you are, I shouldn't like you to pick out a wife
  for <i>me</i>!"</p>

  <p>Evans smiled tolerantly.</p>

  <p>"Wimmin don't like me&mdash;I know too much about 'em. Take
  Hist'ry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you are going to talk about B&mdash;Mary..." expostulated The
  Miller.</p>

  <p>"I ain't," Evans shrugged. "There's others, an' as the widely advertised
  Shakespeare says, 'I've learnt about wimmin from all of 'em!' Take the
  well-known&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not Lewdcreature Burgia!" begged The Miller. "Let that poor lady rest in
  her marble tomb&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lipsus lazily&mdash;not marble," corrected Evans. "She was buried in
  Westminster Abbey by the side of her dear old father in 1684&mdash;correct me
  if I'm wrong. Her last words was 'You'll find Callis engraved on me
  brain'&mdash;her end was peace."</p>

  <p>The Miller fanned himself vigorously.</p>

  <p>"No," Evans went on, "I'm referrin' more to such wimmin as&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cleopatra," murmured The Miller, "whose needle we all admire!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans' annoyance was not wholly without cause.</p>

  <p>"I'm thinkin' of wimmin like Bore-de-Syer, the well-known Roman queen that
  fought the ancient Britons in a chariot with mowin' machines tied on the
  spokes! What a woman!"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" agreed The Miller densely. "A friend of yours?"</p>

  <p>Educated Evans could only make impatient noises.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, I don't get lured up to no public-houses by females," he said. "I
  got my reputation to lose."</p>

  <p>"May I suggest," said The Miller, with infinite gentleness, "that you not
  only lose it, but that you tie a brick round its neck and drop it into the
  Regent's Canal? So that it doesn't come back. As to the new Circe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pardon?" said Evans.</p>

  <p>"Temptress," amended The Miller, "her chief interest to me is her
  education. She is one of the best-read girls I have ever met and she has a
  memory like a loose-leaf ledger. I confess that she staggered me when she
  told me the date the police force was founded."</p>

  <p>"1743," murmured Evans, "by the celebrated Lord Copper&mdash;it used to be
  Peel, I know," he added to The Miller's correction, "but he changed his name
  for family reasons."</p>

  <p>"Her education," went on The Miller, "is rather remarkable. People are
  talking about it. Yevers says he had her schoolmaster in the saloon bar the
  other day and she fairly staggered him."</p>

  <p>"Anything staggers a schoolmaster," scoffed Evans. "Besides, how can a bit
  of a girl be educated? Where's her experience? Where's her
  man-of-the-worldness? Take geography diamonds come from Asterdam&mdash;very
  few people know that. Sugar comes from Demerare, coffee comes from Africa,
  cotton comes from Liverpool and dear old Dixieland&mdash;see song. Take
  mathematics&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" said The Miller.</p>

  <p>"Take mathematics," said Mr. Evans calmly. "What about algebra? What about
  Euclid? What about isosceles triangles&mdash;that's geometry: you do it with
  a compass. I got a prize for it at school. Take physics. What makes a
  seidlitz powder go fizz? Very few people know that. It's the combustion of
  the blue with the white..."</p>

  <p>Curiosity and tentative invitation extended at third hand, plus the fact
  that several people had told him about the young lady at the "Cow and
  Garter," eventually induced Mr. Evans to make a call.</p>

  <p>Mr. Yevers was standing in the bar, a sardonic smile upon his face, as
  Evans strolled in with a certain <i>hauteur</i>. To his surprise, the
  landlord came towards him.</p>

  <p>"Let bygones be bygones, Evans," he said thickly. "'Ave one on the
  'ouse."</p>

  <p>"Port wine," said Evans, "or maybe a glass of sherry white wine&mdash;as
  seck as possible. Seck's Latin for sweet, hence the word seckarine."</p>

  <p>This was a challenge, delivered alike to the awe-stricken habitués of the
  "Cow and Garter," who had gathered to witness this Homeric contest, and to
  the beautiful lady who was regarding him with the speculative eye of a
  gladiator confronted with a large and unshaved lion. Mr. Yevers looked round
  at her, frowned significantly. Here was her quarry.</p>

  <p>"Sherry," she said, in a clear, loud voice, "comes from Jerez, pronounced
  Hreth, in the south of Spain. 'Sec' means 'dry.' Sherry was first introduced
  into England in 1642."</p>

  <p>" '41," murmured Evans. "The first lot was brought here by a gentleman
  named Williams." He was on the point of saying "a particular friend of mine,"
  but checked himself in time.</p>

  <p>He glanced round the saloon bar, stared insolently through the
  windows.</p>

  <p>"Looks like snow," he said; "which reminds me that the Thames was froze
  over in 1714 and a coach and six horses drove across at Wapping Stairs."</p>

  <p>"The Thames was frozen over," said the belle of learning, "in 1742 at
  Richmond Bridge, and a whole ox was roasted on the ice near Putney in
  1831."</p>

  <p>" '32," murmured Evans; "and it wasn't a whole ox, it was half an ox. It
  was the year that Diomedes won the Derby."</p>

  <p>He thought this would stagger her, but she was a girl not easily
  staggered.</p>

  <p>"Diomedes," she said, "is a bay colt by Argos-Capdane. He is trained by H.
  Leader and owned by Mr. Beer. As a two-year old&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not talking about that Diomedes, there's another," said Evans loudly.
  "You've got 'em all mixed up. I'm talking about the horse that won the Derby
  in 1784, owned by Lord What's-his-name and ridden by Fred Archer, the
  well-known but late jockey."</p>

  <p>She was staggered by this, but came again nobly.</p>

  <p>"Fred Archer was born&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"Everybody knows that," said Evans. "What about Socrates, the well-known
  poet and Eyetalian, the fellow that double-crossed the well- known
  Rubicons&mdash;him and Julius Caesar was like brothers. So was Mark Antony,
  the highly celebrated friend, Roman and countryman.</p>

  <p>"Shakespeare&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"Never mind about Shakespeare," said Mr. Evans, holding tight to his
  vantage. "What about Brutus, that chewed tobacco?"</p>

  <p>"Tobacco&mdash;" began the girl.</p>

  <p>"Never mind about tobacco. Did he or didn't he? Didn't Julius Caesar, when
  he lay a-dyin' on his couch on the Plain of Nervy, say 'Et chew, Brutus?' Is
  that hist'ry or making it up? And what about Cleopatra, who was stoned to
  death by rats? What about her needle, which we all admire, covered over with
  hydrostatics, which I used to be able to read when I was a boy, as everybody
  knows, though I've got out of speaking Egyptian, though I still know a few
  words, such as 'ooka' and 'wookha,' which means 'male' and 'female,' as there
  is in every country throughout the British Empire, on which the sun never
  sets. Which brings us to Australia. The finest horse that ever came out of
  Australia was Carbine, by Musket out of Woodbine. He ran in seventy- five
  races and was only beaten once, his jockey havin' a packet on the second.
  Take Flemington race-course, the finest course in the world, where the
  Viceroy's Cup's run. Which brings us to the question of Ireland."</p>

  <p>Hebe made her supreme effort.</p>

  <p>"Ireland was conquered by Richard Strongbow in 1066&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know all about that," said Evans. "He landed in Galway 'Arbour on the
  thirteenth of July at seven o'clock in the morning. It was raining," he
  added. "Which brings us to the question of how many pennies put side by side
  would reach from here to the moon. Very few people know this. The moon is an
  extinct volcano, entirely surrounded by ether. Chloroform was invented by Dr.
  Lister by accident whilst trying to discover the secret of gunpowder. In
  1635: I am not sure of the exact date. Talking of doctors reminds us that
  Lewdcreature Burgia, the female Crippen of Italy, who poisoned the little
  princes and buried 'em under the stairs where the Marble Arch now stands, was
  one of the most educated women of the day. Her husband was the well- known
  Leonardo D. Vincey, the celebrated picture-taker, whose portraits we all
  admire, both in the British Museum and otherwise. The British Museum was
  founded by an old sailor who wanted the people of London to have a place to
  go into when it was wet."</p>

  <p>The female encyclopaedia lost her head.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Mr. Whatever-your-name-is," she said hotly, "all these dates
  and things you're giving us are wrong. You know they're wrong. And all my
  dates are right: I got them out of the Encyclopaedia of General Knowledge,
  and learnt the 2,000 pages by heart."</p>

  <p>Evans smiled.</p>

  <p>"I wrote it," he said simply.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story10"
     name="story10"></a>X. &mdash; THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND</h2>

  <p class="first">THE eternal quest for education led Mr. Evans into many
  strange experiences. There was a Cult that had meetings in a tiny hall in
  Stibbington Street, and the educated man was for some time a regular
  attendant.</p>

  <p>"What is this I hear about your going to the meetings of The Children of
  the Sun?" asked The Miller.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans smiled.</p>

  <p>"It's learnin'," he said simply. "I gotta sub- conscience."</p>

  <p>"A what?" asked the startled officer.</p>

  <p>"A sub-conscience&mdash;it's workin' all the time. It's due to the
  sun."</p>

  <p>"But you never see the sun in Camden Town."</p>

  <p>"I go racin'," said Evans. "When a man gets a sub- conscience he gets
  Revealations. Things come into his mind. It's in a book. Sometimes when I'm
  walkin' about I get a sub-conscience of what I'm goin' to have for dinner;
  sometimes I get a sub-conscience that I'm goin' to meet you. It's
  astral."</p>

  <p>"Whatal?"</p>

  <p>"Astral&mdash;somethin' to do with flyin'," said Mr. Evans.</p>

  <p>"Kite-flying?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans smiled again indulgently.</p>

  <p>The life of a prophet, even a world's champion prophet, is not all jam. He
  is at the mercy of temperament&mdash;temperamental horses, temperamental
  jockeys, and last, but by no means last, temperamental clients. No client of
  Educated Evans better fitted this description than Moses Smike, the owner of
  Smike's Renowned Fish and Chip Restaurant, whose establishment was off Great
  College Street, Camden Town.</p>

  <p>And yet Mr. Evans had undoubtedly been the salvation of the man. As long
  ago as Braxted (what a beauty!) and Eton Boy (given from the weights some
  clients got 33-1), he had encouraged Mr. Smike in the pursuit of easy wealth.
  Only the other day, when Mr. Smike had some difficulty with the wholesaler
  who supplied him with plaice and skate, it was the Educated Marvel who found
  him Obscotch (8-1) and Bunions (11-2), and thus rescued him from an
  appearance in the Bankruptcy Court.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't mind," complained Mr. Evans, "if the man would say a thing an'
  stick to it. But when he says 'There's a tenner for you, Evans,' an' when I
  call for it there's only a middle piece and 8s. 3d. in coppers, I consider
  he's not acting honourable. And coppers is low&mdash;with all due respect to
  you, Mr. Challoner, an' meanin' nothing against rozzers."</p>

  <p>Detective-Inspector Challoner took no umbrage. He was in his most cheerful
  mood that morning, and the straw he chewed was whiter and more imposing than
  usual.</p>

  <p>"Smike's going to be married," he said, and Evans uttered a tut-tut of
  surprise and disapproval.</p>

  <p>"Why, he's an old man! It'll be like the celebrated Mr. May marryin' the
  well-known Miss December!"</p>

  <p>"To be exact, he is about your age," said The Miller. "Anyway, I shouldn't
  be surprised if he made amends by asking you to the wedding."</p>

  <p>Evans brightened visibly.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he'll give me a weddin' present?" he said.</p>

  <p>The Miller explained that the giving of wedding presents was the privilege
  rather of the guest than the host.</p>

  <p>"That's a silly idea," said Educated Evans. "Anyway, the most he'll ever
  get from me is my Sealed £10 Guarantee Coop wire&mdash;that's worth a dollar
  of anybody's money."</p>

  <p>The bride was Miss Emily Jane Loocood and she was supposed to be of French
  origin. She had been an assistant at Mr. Smike's fish establishment for six
  years.</p>

  <p>"And about time he married her," said Evans scandalously. "That's why they
  call 'em December an' May marriages&mdash;they're spliced in December
  an'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't let us be uncharitable," said the Miller. "Anyway, May is a lucky
  month to be born in."</p>

  <p>To the wedding Mr. Evans was invited. It occurred on a Sunday so as not to
  interfere with business, a brief honeymoon ("totally unnecessary," said
  Evans) was to be spent at Brighton, and the Happy Pair would be back in time
  to open the shop on Tuesday and receive the felicitations of all old
  customers.</p>

  <p>As a wedding feast it was, from Mr. Evans' point of view, a failure, for
  not only was Mrs. Lube present in startling magenta, but Old Sam, his
  whiskers dry-cleaned and wearing a frock coat and white tall hat, was amongst
  the guests. Mrs. Lube was unaccountably friendly.</p>

  <p>"I hope, Mr. Evans, you're going to let bygones be bygones," said Mrs.
  Lube.</p>

  <p>"I hope so, I'm sure," said Evans stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Remember what you owe to my dear gran'father that brought you up when you
  hadn't got a penny piece," said Mrs. Lube sweetly.</p>

  <p>Evans choked and gurgled.</p>

  <p>Old Sam! Who used to run errands for him! A holder-up of public-houses,
  waiting for a horse-drawn vehicle to pull up so that he could earn a penny by
  holding the head of an animal who wouldn't have run away if he could.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon?" he said hotly. "That old&mdash;your gran'father was a
  mere menial and dependant. I said 'go' and he goed&mdash;'hither' and he
  hithered&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube smiled.</p>

  <p>"Your memory ain't as good as it was when you was young," she said
  cryptically.</p>

  <p>Possibly it was the effect this outrageous statement had upon Mr. Evans
  that put into her head the idea which, subsequently, was to cause the learned
  man so much acute mental distress.</p>

  <p>"I can only say," he exclaimed in wrath, "that I'm sorry for your
  education. You're like the celebrated orsstretch that puts its head in the
  sandy desert every time somebody tries to take a rise out of him. You remind
  me of my old friend Cardinal Rishloo, who made the celebrated French
  Revolution because he couldn't find how the dumplin' got into the apple!"</p>

  <p>"You're very strange, Mr. Evans," she said, her hazy ideas taking a very
  definite shape: "strange in your manner. It must be goin' to these meetin's
  in Stibbington Street. You're very strange."</p>

  <p>"I'm treatin' you like a lady," said Evans, "an' I dessay that seems
  strange to you."</p>

  <p>The Miller was not at the wedding, and to him Evans related the events of
  the afternoon.</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't have gone," said The Miller. "You know that Smike and the
  Lubes are thicker than thieves."</p>

  <p>The wedding coincided with a period of great activity at Masked Marvel
  Mansions. The Lincoln weights were out, and Mr. Evans had heard of a horse at
  Newmarket that was being specially got ready for the race. Moreover, to meet
  current demands and to satisfy the cravings of his clientele for their daily
  heart flutters, he had secured one of the grandest bits of information about
  a horse running at Hurst Park that ever came to mortal man.</p>

  <p>The information came, as all good things in life come, by the veriest
  accident. He was racing at Sandown one day and heard two men talking about
  Suggo. Now Suggo, as everybody knows, is not the name of a new soap powder,
  but the registered title of a thoroughbred racehorse in one of the hottest
  stables at Epsom. There isn't a cold stable at Epsom, but this one was so hot
  that steam heating was a superfluity.</p>

  <p>"Not to-day!" grunted one of the men. "Hurst&mdash;keep it to
  yourself."</p>

  <p>Evans went along, and by the aid of his card and the number on the
  attendant's arm, identified Suggo, who had a careless look in his eye which
  suggested that this intelligent animal knew that he was not being called upon
  for any supreme effort at the moment. In the race Suggo was never wholly
  visible. He was eighth, ninth or tenth till the field came into the straight,
  and then, moving up to make a show, he finished a respectable fifth.</p>

  <p>Consequently, a few days after the wedding, Mr. Evans was in a position to
  send out to all clients new and old the following:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">EDUCATED EVANS'<br>
  MYSTERY HORSE!!!<br>
  What a beauty!<br>
  What a beauty!<br></p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">Educated Evans, the World's Champion Turf
     Adviser and Racing Prophet,<br>
  begs to advise the following:<br>
  MONEY FOR NOTHING<br>
  This horse has been tried to beat the best horses at Epsom.<br>
  SUGGO on Friday.<br>
  Help yourself and roll up with your T.M.Q.'s for 10s. for<br>
  ONE THAT WILL WIN TEN MINUTES<br>
  on Saturday.<br>
  P.S. This horse has been Revealed to me.</p><br>

  <p>"What on earth made you put that?" asked The Miller.</p>

  <p>"To make it mysteriouser," said Evans complacently. "The public likes
  mysteries. An' I've gotta sub-conscience about this horse."</p>

  <p>He went down to see the race. This time Suggo led the field for half the
  journey and then fell back, a beaten horse.</p>

  <p>"Rapped himself," said the trainer glibly.</p>

  <p>There was another Hurst Park meeting a few weeks later, and he had
  arranged that in this race Suggo should not rap himself or do anything to
  himself except get his head in front at the stick.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans accepted defeat with the philosophy of one to whom adversity was
  no stranger</p>

  <p>"Can't give 'em winners every day," he said when he saw The Miller that
  night; "but I got one for Monday that will Doddle It!"</p>

  <p>To all clients (new and old) he despatched the following Hurry Up
  message:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">EDUCATED EVANS<br>
  Owing to his last selection Wrapping Himself<br>
  (hard lines, hard lines),<br>
  Mr. Evans, the highly celebrated Turf Expert,<br>
  begs to send his friends one and all<br>
  MOUSE HOLE<br>
  for the Littlehampton Hurdle on Monday.<br>
  Go for your summer's keep.<br>
  P.S. This horse is a Revellation!!</p><br>

  <p>In the race Mouse Hole found its namesake and crawled into it, finishing
  last.</p>

  <p>And then a sinister rumour flashed around Camden Town. How much Alf Lube
  had to do with it, to what extent it owed its circulation to the affected
  concern of Mrs. Lube, how far certain disgruntled publicans, whose word is
  law, assisted in its promulgation, is a matter for investigation.</p>

  <p>The Miller, in the course of his business, had to make a few inquiries
  concerning the whereabouts of two motor rugs which had been absentmindedly
  abstracted from a garage; and in the course of these inquiries he came into
  contact with Toby Lyons, one of Evans' biggest and fastest supporters.</p>

  <p>"Poor old Evans!" said Toby, shaking his head mournfully. "That only shows
  you what education'll do for you, Mr. Challoner."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with Evans?"</p>

  <p>Toby smiled sadly.</p>

  <p>"Goin'," he said significantly. "It's too much readin' that clogs up the
  headpiece, and naturally the brain won't work."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean he's mad?" asked The Miller, aghast.</p>

  <p>"Revelations," murmured Toby. "According to what I hear, he sits in a
  trance and hears ghosts tellin' him what's going to win."</p>

  <p>Everywhere The Miller went he heard the same story. In some subtle and
  pernicious manner the authority of Educated Evans was being underpinned and
  undermined. He took the trouble to call on Mr. Evans, and that gentleman
  smiled at his warning.</p>

  <p>"It's only the lower orders, the riff-raff and the what- not," he said. "I
  don't take no notice of what uneducated people say about me. If people are
  like the well-known wife of the celebrated Julius Caesar, suspicious of
  everybody, well, let 'em be! See what they say about you, Mr. Challoner."</p>

  <p>"What do they say about me?" asked The Miller, interested.</p>

  <p>"They say you've got three rows of houses out of the money you've done
  hooks out of! I always say: 'You're misjudgin' the man. I don't suppose he's
  got more than a row anyway.' "</p>

  <p>"Thank you for your enthusiastic championship," said The Miller
  sarcastically. "Now take a tip from me, Evans&mdash;cut out The Children of
  the Sun and the subconscious mind, and keep to your old method of finding
  winners&mdash;putting all the names in a hat and sending out the first one
  you draw."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans was not offended.</p>

  <p>He went to the "Cow and Garter" that night with the idea of establishing
  beyond any doubt his complete sanity. Mr. Yevers, the inimical landlord, was
  confined to his bed with an attack of gout, and the encyclopaedic barmaid had
  been replaced by one of greater beauty but less erudition. He could not but
  observe that, when he entered the bar, silence fell upon the habitués.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, friends all," he said in his genial way, as he ordered his
  whisky and soda. "The weather's mild for this time of the year. We shall soon
  have spring here."</p>

  <p>Everybody agreed.</p>

  <p>"Spring," said Evans, "is caused by the world rotating on its own equinox,
  thereby not only causing day and night, but also summer, autumn, Christmas
  and other seasons, the snow on the North Pole meltin' an' bringin' about the
  floods, causin' great damage to life and property, see Sunday papers."</p>

  <p>Toby, who was in the bar, answered him, and his voice was gentle, almost
  pleading.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think, Mr. Evans, it'd be a good idea if you gave up studyin'
  for a bit?" he asked. "It can't do your brain any good havin' all these
  thoughts in your mind."</p>

  <p>Evans surveyed his whisky with a mysterious smile.</p>

  <p>"You can't be educated without thought, Toby," he said. "Take Biography or
  the study of insects. Microbes cause all diseases such as headache, earache,
  ingrained toenails&mdash;which brings us to the question of
  electricity&mdash;which causes both lightnin' and lamps. Electricity can be
  caused by water</p>

  <p>"By dynimos," said a husky voice in the background. It was Hoggy Main, who
  for three days shovelled coal in a firehouse. "Dynimos and wires."</p>

  <p>"Dynamos are turned by water," said Evans. "By coal," said Hoggy. "I
  oughter know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Somebody whispered a remonstrance to him and he was silent.</p>

  <p>"Of course they're turned by water, Mr. Evans," said Toby soothingly.
  "Everybody knows that."</p>

  <p>"Everybody don't know that," said Evans, irritated. "Only a few people,
  which brings us to the question of the human figure, composed of heart, lungs
  an' important blood vessels, which together with bones and muscles makes man,
  woman an' child."</p>

  <p>Everybody agreed with him at once. The barmaid stood at a respectful
  distance behind the counter, ready to fly, for she had heard of Mr. Evans'
  strange disorder.</p>

  <p>"What about the sub-conscience mind?" asked the irrepressible Hoggy.</p>

  <p>"Shut up," said Toby. "Don't annoy the man. You oughter be ashamed of
  yourself, Hoggy."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans waved aside the defence.</p>

  <p>"The sub-conscience mind," he said, "as everybody knows except the
  ignorant an' the common, is due to the brain actin' without people
  thinkin'."</p>

  <p>"And I convinced 'em," he told The Miller. "Nobody so much as argued with
  me. It's brains that does it."</p>

  <p>But a change was coming over the fortunes of the World's Champion. First
  his local, and then, as rumour reached them, his more distant clientele, grew
  shy of his appeals. It is true that he gave three losers in succession and
  two of them started at odds on; but the foundation of their scepticism was
  planted deeper than in the vicissitudes of a prophet's fortunes. His temper
  was not improved by the fact that he could not walk abroad without being
  confronted with the poster advertising Old Sam's Midnight Special.</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">HARDNUT!   HARDNUT!   HARDNUT!<br>

  OLD SAM'S DOUBLE NAP!<br>
  Information v. The sub-conscience mind.<br>
  P.S. Keep away from the Bogey Man!!</p><br>

  <p>One old-established client wrote</p>

  <p class="letter">"DEAR SIR: Hearing you have gone wrong in your head, please
  take my name off your list and oblige."</p><br>

  <p>He sent a winner to his dwindling clientele, but it was not of a price
  calculated to re-establish confidence. In a fit of despondency, through which
  ran the red thread of panic, he sat down in his little room one night to
  study the programme of the coming Saturday, and as usual he limited his study
  to the race which had the fewest entries, because, as he argued rightly, the
  smaller the field the smaller the chance of picking the wrong 'un.</p>

  <p>This race, however, did not promise well. Bogey Boy was a certain runner,
  would start at 6-1 on and doddle it. Mrs. Lipski, another prominent jumper,
  might possibly beat him, but wasn't by any means a certain runner. At the
  bottom of the little handicap was a horse called Iron Face. He didn't
  remember having seen the name before, and disconsolately he went back to Mrs.
  Lipski, turned up his tattered book of form, scanned the training
  intelligence of the <i>Sporting Chronicle</i> and eventually made up his mind
  to risk Mrs. Lipski. She would at least be 7-2 against.</p>

  <p>In no happy frame of mind he drew a wax sheet towards him and wrote
  laboriously, and had reached the line: "This one has been sent to me by my
  correspondent as the coop of the century," when&mdash;Iron Face!</p>

  <p>It came to him like the thunder of drums. Iron Face would win that race. A
  revelation... his sub-conscience mind!</p>

  <p>Iron Face would win: he knew it as certainly as if he were watching the
  horse walking into the winners' enclosure.</p>

  <p>All of a tremble, he threw aside the wax sheet and started
  another.</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">Educated Evans has had a tip straight from his
     Sub-conscience Mind!<br>
  A Revellation!     A Revellation!<br>
  This horse will start at an outside price and Can't be Beat.<br>
  Old and new clients all, you will never get another chance like this.<br>
  IRONFACE<br>
  IRONFACE<br>
  IRONFACE.</p><br>

  <p>The morning after he sent out the revelation, The Miller came tramping up
  the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Evans, you're going to let yourself in very bad unless you drop this
  revelation stuff," he said. "Iron Face is an old crock that has never jumped
  more than two fences in his life. He's up against the best 'chaser in the
  Midlands...."</p>

  <p>Evans closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Sub-conscience mind," he murmured. "Help yourself an' don't forget I've
  got a mouth."</p>

  <p>Later he met Mr. Izzy Izzyheim, the famous turf accountant.</p>

  <p>"You're a regular money-getter to me, Evans," said Mr. Izzyheim with great
  joviality. "If Camden Town only stands you for another three months, I'll be
  getting that new Rolls I promised the missus."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans shrugged his thin shoulders.</p>

  <p>"There's things you don't understand, Mr. Izzyheim," he began.</p>

  <p>"How much money have you got?" asked Izzyheim, his eyes glowing at the
  prospect of easy wealth. "Because I'm willing to lay you all you have at s.p.
  and never send a penny to the course,"</p>

  <p>It needed but this to spur Evans to a frenzy Diving his hand into his
  pocket, he brought out a disordered collection of Treasury notes and postal
  orders; put his hand into another pocket and produced a ball of paper which,
  unwrapped, proved to consist of five £5 notes.</p>

  <p>"Thirty-eight pun' ten," said Mr. Izzyheim gravely. "It'll just about pay
  my expenses to Brighton for the week-end."</p>

  <p>He had one or two sycophantic clients with him, and these were amused. At
  that moment The Miller came up and Mr. Izzyheim hastily pocketed the
  ready.</p>

  <p>"I've just laid our friend s.p. to thirty-eight ten against his
  sub-conscience horse," he said, and The Miller shook his head in despair.</p>

  <p>"Evans," he said, as he walked with him towards the Cobden statue, "do you
  know that half the people in Camden Town never see you without tapping their
  nuts?"</p>

  <p>"Let 'em!" said Evans defiantly.</p>

  <p>He went hot and cold as people pointed to him, walking down the High
  Street that afternoon, and in a state of misery retired to his room and sat
  in the growing darkness, his head between his hands, deploring the insanity
  that had led him to parting with his capital. With bitterness in his heart he
  cursed The Children of the Sun; cursed the sub-conscience mind...</p>

  <p>A hasty step on the stairs, and The Miller burst in.</p>

  <p>"You lucky brute!" he said.... "Three runners. They laid seven to two on
  the favourite, seven to two against Mrs. Lipski, and they both fell and your
  hair trunk won at thirty-three to one!"</p>

  <p>Evans raised his haggard face.</p>

  <p>"What a beauty! What a beauty!" he said hollowly. "Sub- conscience mind v.
  pickin' 'em out with a pin!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story11"
     name="story11"></a>XI. &mdash; MR. EVANS HAS A WELL-SCREWED HEAD</h2>

  <p class="first">AS the field came round the pay gate turn, Mr. Evans stood
  on one leg with a look of exquisite agony on his face, for Theoline lay last
  but one and "Theoline: go heavy had been his £5 Special, his £2 Guarantee and
  his £10 Occasional Beauty.</p>

  <p>As the field breasted the hill Theoline was absolutely last.</p>

  <p>"Not a yard!" said Evans bitterly.</p>

  <p>As the horses came opposite the silver ring a change occurred&mdash;out of
  the blue shot a bolt, and Theoline, threading his way through beaten horses,
  came with one effortless run to win in the end in a hack canter.</p>

  <p>"That Lappy's the best jockey in the world," said Mr. Evans to his
  companion. "He's what they call in the French language a <i>'Multum in
  Palmo,'</i> which means that he's there if he's wanted. He reminds me of the
  celebrated Bill Archer."</p>

  <p>Mr. Iggson, his friend, was both polite and flattering.</p>

  <p>"It's a licker to me, Evans," he said, "how you do it. You've got your
  head screwed on the right way."</p>

  <p>Educated Evans purred: he was still purring when the red flag went up.
  After that he purred no more, for Theoline was disqualified for boring.</p>

  <p>"What a jockey!" he said savagely as they made their way across to the
  station. "There ain't no jockeys nowadays&mdash;only butcher boys an'
  what-nots! Did you hear what I said to him when he came out to ride in the
  next race? That Lappy can't ride one side of a horse nor the other side
  either. He ought to be warned off."</p>

  <p>At that moment Mr. Arthur Lappy, speeding towards London in his Rolls, was
  expressing the same opinion to the pretty young lady who sat by his side. He
  was a fair-haired young man with rather a nice voice, for his father had been
  a fairly rich trainer and Arthur Lappy had enjoyed the luxury of a tutor. And
  he had other hobbies besides racing. Millicent Drace (which was not her real
  name) was most anxious to talk about these, and listened with some impatience
  to her companion discussing quite another subject.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear what that poor little devil said when I came out of the
  weighing room?" he chuckled. " 'Butcher boy!' And I am!"</p>

  <p>"Who was he?" asked Millicent, who wasn't interested.</p>

  <p>"A little tipster from Camden Town&mdash;a chap called Evans. Poor little
  blighter!"</p>

  <p>Millicent sought to bring the conversation to the subject of emeralds. She
  had seen Evans: she had also seen Mr. Iggson and had been more interested in
  that prosperous figure than in his companion. But for the moment ...
  emeralds.</p>

  <p>"You shall see them one day," said Arthur Lappy, and forgot all about
  Evans in the discussion of his expensive hobby.</p>

  <p>For he had a passion for the green stones. Some jockeys collect stamps,
  some bookmakers' bills, some children, but Arthur Lappy collected emeralds,
  as his father did before him.</p>

  <p>He had a flat in Half Moon Street, a house in Newmarket and a shoot in
  Norfolk, for Arthur's income was a very large one, and he had had several big
  strokes of luck, and he never wasted what he won. He was chary of speaking
  about his collection to strangers, but Millie was no stranger. He had known
  her three weeks, having met her at a party given by an actor friend, and
  because she never betted and never asked him for a tip, he knew that her
  heart was pure.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Evans, as the race special thundered towards London,
  elaborated his views on bad jockeys.</p>

  <p>"It's ridin' flash that does it, Mr. Iggson," he said. "These here jockeys
  go dissipatin' up in the West End when they ought to be in bed dreamin' how
  they can help the public. They're like the celebrated candle that burns at
  both ends. It's havin' no education that does it. They're ignorant. Ask Lappy
  where the North Pole is an' what would he answer? Ask him about Julia Cæsar
  an' he'd be flummoxed. Take foreign languages&mdash;suppose you said to him
  'Polly voo Francy' he wouldn't understand plain English."</p>

  <p>No doubt Educated Evans had reason for his sourness. Theoline was his
  eighth consecutive loser.</p>

  <p>Well might Old Sam's Midnight Special chortle with joy.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">Don't be robbed by so-called Educated<br>
  Amatchers, come to Old Sam, The Expert.<br>
  (Same address since 1869)</p><br>

  <p>"Don't worry," soothed Mr. Iggson. "You'll come out on top&mdash;you've
  got your head screwed on the right way."</p>

  <p>It was natural that Mr. Iggson should comfort his unhappy friend. Even on
  ordinary occasions this stout and red-faced man never failed to favour Mr.
  Evans with a friendly nod whenever education walked the pavement before
  Iggson's Fresh Vegetable and Seasonable Fruit Store, though, as sometimes
  happens to a world's champion prophet and turf adviser, luck ran a little
  churlishly.</p>

  <p>"You can't find winners all the time, Mr. Evans," said Mr. Iggson
  pleasantly. "Don't worry&mdash;you go on trying to find 'em and go on backing
  'em! You're a man who's got his head screwed on the right way."</p>

  <p>This was a favourite saying of Mr. Iggson's, and the highest praise he
  could bestow on any man&mdash;that he had his head screwed on the right
  way.</p>

  <p>The very next day he stopped Mr. Evans as he was passing the shop.</p>

  <p>"I've got a thing here that you'll understand, Mr. Evans. I'm an
  uneducated man myself, but you with your headpiece will see what it is in a
  jiffy. It's art."</p>

  <p>"Art," said Mr. Evans profoundly, "is paintin', the same as the well-known
  Lanspear, him that did pictures of dogs by hand. Or it's statures, the same
  as the far-famed Ajax defyin' the lightnin' in Hyde Park, or it's musical
  pieces&mdash;see Moseark."</p>

  <p>Mr. Iggson inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"This is a stature," he said, and led the way into the back parlour.</p>

  <p>On the mantelpiece stood a piece of bronze&mdash;the figure of a woman in
  long flowing robes.</p>

  <p>"I bought it at the Caledonian Market, and according to certain things
  that's been said, it's art of the best quality."</p>

  <p>"It's Venus," said Evans, eyeing the statuette with a frown. "The Venus de
  Marlow by the celebrated Michael Angleol."</p>

  <p>The inscription on the bottom said "Hebe."</p>

  <p>"That's Roman for Venus," explained Evans. "I've been thinkin'," said Mr.
  Iggson, "that if anything happened to me I'd like you to keep that. Accordin'
  to what I've heard it brings luck&mdash;especially if you keep it in a box
  under the bed and don't tell anybody you've got it."</p>

  <p>Evans smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'm not superstitious meself," he said, "an' I don't believe in mascots.
  All you got to do if your luck's out is to carry a bit of coal in your pocket
  an' spit every time you see a peebald horse."</p>

  <p>"I'd like you to have it," said Mr. Iggson solemnly, "when I'm gorn."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans murmured a polite hope that the day would be long deferred, and
  returned to answer certain abusive letters that had come to Goodwin Chambers
  in the past twenty-four hours.</p>

  <p>A few nights later as Mr. Evans sat, a brooding, unhappy figure, examining
  the day's results, and wondering what perverse fate had induced him to change
  his mind and send to all clients old and new Black Velvet (down the course),
  when he had woken up with the fullest intention and determination to send
  French Star (won 100-7), a whistle from the mews below brought him out into
  the open.</p>

  <p>"Only one for you," said the postman as the educated man flew down the
  steps. "It's a wonder to me you get any after the stumers you've been
  lumbering on to the working classes."</p>

  <p>"No insolence, my man," said Mr. Evans haughtily. "It's the like of us
  taxpayers that keeps the likes of you postmen."</p>

  <p>He took the letter upstairs and opened it. It was written on
  aristocratically thick notepaper and had an embossed heading.</p>

  <p class="letter">"If Mr. Evans will call upon Mr. Arthur Lappy at 7.30
  to-morrow night, he may hear of something which may be of assistance to
  him."</p>

  <p>Arthur Lappy! The far-famed jockey! Educated Evans was in a twitter of
  excitement, and scarcely remembered how the next day passed. At 7.30 to the
  second he rang the bell against the polished door of Mr. Lappy's flat, and
  was admitted by a magnificent footman in uniform&mdash;for Arthur had the
  aristocracy complex which has ruined so many young jockeys.</p>

  <p>He himself was sitting in his den, a handsomely furnished apartment, a
  little overloaded with the objects of art which he had acquired in his
  extensive travels; for Arthur in the off season was a great globe-
  trotter.</p>

  <p>"You're the man who called me a butcher boy," said Mr. Lappy with a grin,
  "and I admit I rode like one."</p>

  <p>For certain reasons he was in an exalted</p>

  <p>Haroun al Raschid mood, at peace with the world, his heart charged with a
  benevolence which, to do him justice, was not unusual, even if it was a
  little more intensified that night.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to give you a winner, but I'm not going to make a habit of it.
  Range Rider will walk the three o'clock race on Friday."</p>

  <p>"Do you ride it, sir?" asked Evans humbly.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't."</p>

  <p>Arthur nodded.</p>

  <p>"I often wonder how you fellows get a living," he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans coughed.</p>

  <p>"Personally speakin'," he said, "I don't understand meself how the lower
  orders, the hoi polloi, or what I might term the uneducated masses, manage to
  exist. Take art&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped suddenly. When he raised his eyes he saw on the mantelpiece the
  exact counterpart of Mr. Iggson's statuette.</p>

  <p>"Good lord!" he gasped.</p>

  <p>Arthur Lappy was quick to notice his surprise.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen one like that before?" He lifted the bronze figure down. "I
  bought that in Milan. There used to be a pair, but a servant I had pinched
  one."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans was momentarily embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"I can't exactly say I've seen anything like it," he said discreetly, for
  Mr Iggson had a private reputation.</p>

  <p>There was a ring at the bell, and Arthur rose quickly.</p>

  <p>"You clear out," he said, and the reason for the hurry became apparent to
  Mr. Evans when a radiant young lady passed him in the hall, leaving behind
  the faint fragrance of those flowers which only the Paris perfumer knows.</p>

  <p>An industrious man was Educated Evans that night. To all clients ancient
  and modern went forth the joyous tidings.</p>

  <p><a id="pic2"
     name="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1305251h-images/EE3-03.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>There was something so definite, so cocksure about this missive that even
  that astute judge of men and horses, Detective-Inspector Challoner, was
  impressed and came up to see Evans.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get this?" he demanded. Evans smiled.</p>

  <p>"One of me correspondents at Lam-bourn&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's not trained at Lambourn anyway," said The Miller, eyeing the prophet
  with disfavour. And then, abruptly: "Is it from one of your dupes? I saw you
  at Sandown with them."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Iggson," said Evans with dignity, "is one of my highest respected
  clients."</p>

  <p>The Miller chewed on his straw thoughtfully. "Did he introduce you to the
  lady?"</p>

  <p>"There wasn't a lady," said Mr. Evans.</p>

  <p>"I'm inclined to agree with you," replied The Miller cryptically, but did
  not explain his mystery.</p>

  <p>It is a curious fact that all Mr. Evans' tips were not backed by the
  people who purchased them.</p>

  <p>After a big win there was a surprising number of clients, especially those
  who had soberly and solemnly agreed to remit the odds to five shillings, who
  had forgotten that the horse was in the first race, or hadn't had the money
  to bet with, or hadn't received this letter. But this day, as he walked
  through the High Street, Camden Town, made splendid by a glorious and unusual
  sun, he was intercepted every few yards by earnest men who assured him they
  were going to back Range Rider, and that this was the last chance that he'd
  ever get any so-and-so money out of them if it didn't win.</p>

  <p>Four o'clock brought the happy result, four-thirty the surprising price;
  for at the last moment money had come into the market for three horses, and
  Range Rider had started at 100-9.</p>

  <p>Mr. Iggson was the first to congratulate his friend.</p>

  <p>"I've always said..."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans went cheerily back to the flat, in thorough and complete
  agreement that his head <i>was</i> screwed on the right way, and that he lay
  under an everlasting debt of gratitude to that great and supreme artist of
  the pigskin, Mr. Arthur Lappy.</p>

  <p>That night... The young woman from Iggson's made a call upon Mr. Evans:
  she chose the wan hour of 2 a.m. and was unconscious of the unseemliness of
  it all.</p>

  <p>"Good Gawd!" exclaimed Mr. Evans testily as he opened the door and peered
  forth into the rainy night. "What's all this about?"</p>

  <p>A small, squeaky voice answered him.</p>

  <p>"It's Evie&mdash;the girl from Iggson's, Mr. Evans."</p>

  <p>"Wait a tick," said Mr. Evans modestly, and put on his trousers in the
  dark,</p>

  <p>He lit a lamp, straightened the couch on which, a few minutes before, he
  had been dreaming that the City was won by a horse with an elephant's head,
  and, opening the door, invited Iggson's girl inside.</p>

  <p>She was neither young nor comely, but she had always been Iggson's
  girl&mdash;a general servant by day and a seller of potatoes in the busy
  hours of Saturday night.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Iggson is in trouble," she said in a hushed voice.</p>

  <p>Words and tone told the dire story. Mr. Evans made a clucking noise to
  express his astonishment&mdash;he was in truth staggered. It was common talk
  that Iggson did not confine himself to the sale of greens, and that, beside
  the trade in apples, he did a little buying "on the side."</p>

  <p>If you found a "clock" or a bit of jewellery and casually mentioned the
  fact to Mr. Iggson in the privacy of his back parlour, you were certain of
  collecting a bit of money and no questions asked.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Evans was not a common man. He believed the best of horses and
  men&mdash;especially horses. He never gave credence to the stories which came
  to him, but at the same time he had ears to hear and heard.</p>

  <p>None the less he was shocked.</p>

  <p>"That's bad news." he said, and added politely "The worst news since the
  Great Fire of London in 1848 that burnt down the Thames Embankment."</p>

  <p>"I see a fire engine as I was coming along," said Iggson's girl
  conversationally, but returned to the cause for her visit. "They come an'
  took him out of his bed&mdash;The Miller an' two 'busies," an' Mr. Iggson got
  a chance to speak to me just as they was searchin' his room an' he said,
  'Take that stature orf the mantelpiece in the bedroom to Mr. Evans an' tell
  him to keep it for me till further orders.' "</p>

  <p>She groped in the big, soddened bag she carried and produced the
  "stature."</p>

  <p>"Good lor'!" said the startled Evans.</p>

  <p>Never in his wildest moments had he dreamt that the statue would come to
  him in such circumstances.</p>

  <p>The tragedy of Iggson did not disturb Mr. Evans' rest. He accepted other
  people's troubles with the greatest philosophy. Iggson was a man of some
  property and could pay for a mouthpiece&mdash;he would not at any rate
  require Mr. Evans' services as legal adviser.</p>

  <p>Evans put the statue under the bed and slept the sleep of the completely
  satisfied.</p>

  <p>He had reason for his satisfaction, for the next morning's post brought
  the most generous acknowledgments of the service he had rendered to a world
  of suffering punters (bookmakers in Camden Town pay out overnight). New
  orders rolled in all the morning, and the heart of the educated man swelled
  with joy and gratitude to his benefactor.</p>

  <p>And then he remembered the statue. Obviously it was the one that matched
  Arthur Lappy's&mdash;what a chance of paying back the man who had
  re-established him in the estimation of Camden Town.</p>

  <p>To think, with Mr. Evans, was to act. Wrapping the statuette in a piece of
  white paper, wrapping that again in brown paper and tying it carefully, he
  waited till night, and, going down to Half Moon Street, he deposited his
  burden on the mat before Mr. Lappy's flat, rang the bell and made a hurried
  exit. Only the words "From a Friend" were inscribed upon the parcel for Evans
  had no desire to complicate the case against the erring Iggson. No doubt, he
  reflected, Iggson had "fenced" the little bronze piece from the jockey's
  defaulting servant.</p>

  <p>When he got back to the flat he found The Miller waiting for him.</p>

  <p>"Did Iggson's girl come here the other night?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"No," lied Evans. "What's the trouble, Mr. Challoner? When I heard he was
  inside you could have knocked me down with a feather."</p>

  <p>"Emeralds is the trouble," said The Miller grimly. "We've got Iggson and
  we've got Lappy's old servant, but we haven't got the girl yet."</p>

  <p>Educated Evans dithered but did not swoon. "Lappy's old servant?" he said
  hollowly. "What's he got to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"They were Lappy's emeralds," said The Miller, unusually communicative for
  a police officer. "Apparently his servant had been pinching things for years
  and fencing them with Iggson&mdash;that's how he got to know there were
  emeralds in the flat. Twelve thousand pounds' worth."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans spent an unhappy night.</p>

  <p>For three weeks he avoided High Street, Camden Town, and lived hourly in
  expectation of arrest as an accomplice.</p>

  <p>One satisfaction he had&mdash;he had returned the statue.</p>

  <p>And then the miracle happened. Mr. Iggson, brought up at the Old Bailey,
  was acquitted for lack of evidence, and came back almost triumphantly to
  Camden Town. The first intimation Evans had of the joyous news was the sight
  of the smiling Iggson standing in his doorway.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Evans, I'm out. All the lies and perjuries of these busies
  didn't get me put away."</p>

  <p>Evans was overjoyed, and said so.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I thought you would be. You're a man with his head screwed on the
  right way and you know a thing or two, Mr. Evans," said Iggson. "And if you
  don't mind, I'll take that stature."</p>

  <p>The face of Mr. Evans dropped.</p>

  <p>"I gave it away," he said.</p>

  <p>"You what?" shrieked the greengrocer. "Give it away... who did you give it
  to?"</p>

  <p>"I give it back to the bloke it was pinched from," said Evans, pale but
  determined. "As an educated man I couldn't do anything else&mdash;"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was lucky for all concerned that The Miller had followed
  Mr. Iggson into Bayham Mews.</p>

  <p>"What was the trouble, Evans?" asked The Miller curiously.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans was dabbing his nose with an ensanguined handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I'm not at liberty to discuss the matter," he said. "I tried to do this
  low feller a favour an' he hadn't got the education to see it."</p>

  <p>The Miller was looking at him oddly.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to ask you any more questions, Evans, but I've got an idea
  that somebody left a statuette on Lappy's doormat, and if you're the man
  Lappy owes you a bit. For inside that statuette were twenty-five emeralds
  worth twelve thousand pounds.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans gaped at him.</p>

  <p>"Inside?"</p>

  <p>The Miller nodded.</p>

  <p>"The inside is hollow, but you don't notice it if the head's screwed on
  the right way."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story12"
     name="story12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE TWISTING OF ARTHUR COLLEYBORN</h2>

  <p class="first">ONE of the hardest things that any trainer can attempt is to
  speak encouragingly about any horse he trains. Everybody knows Colleyborn. He
  is one of those honest fellows with a shining face that everybody likes. He
  never bets and never encourages his owners to bet, and yet in some miraculous
  way he is a very rich man.</p>

  <p>It is true that he has been known to encourage his brother- in-law to
  bet.</p>

  <p>To the owner of Boopah he wrote:</p>

  <p>"Your horse is very well, but there are other horses in the race quite as
  well. I am afraid of Mawky's horse and I rather imagine Sir Peter Booley's
  horse may be fitter than we think. I should have a little bet each way if I
  were you."</p>

  <p>On the other hand, he wrote to his brother-in-law, Mr. Willie
  Yegley:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"DEAR BILL,&mdash;Get me a monkey on Boopah, and this time
  keep the wires back till a quarter of an hour before the set time. We ought
  to get tens to our money. Thank you for the cheque over Mouldy Boy. Kind love
  to Cis.</p>

  <p class="letter">ARTHUR."</p><br>

  <p>Now Mr. Colleyborn was terribly susceptible to the charms of what is
  sometimes described as the fair sex but is as often as not brunette. And
  amongst the many pretty ladies who had driven to town in Mr. Colleyborn's
  Bentley for a show, a bit of supper and a dance, was a certain Arabella, who
  was acting at the time as the assistant of a Cambridge doctor. That is to
  say, she assisted him by making out patients' bills and typing the evidence
  he gave whenever he was called upon to swear that the gentleman who ran his
  car into a lamp-post and wanted to fight a policeman was not drunk but was
  suffering from temporary dementia.</p>

  <p>In course of time Mr. Colleyborn and his lady friend parted. He did not
  ask her for the return of his presents, because he had given her nothing more
  substantial than a Good Time.</p>

  <p>Soon after this Miss Arabella went back to London to another job, and
  there the matter ended, for Arabella married&mdash;unhappily, as it proved.
  But the lady never ceased to ascribe the cause of her misfortune to the
  dirty, low and underhand treatment she had received at Mr. Colleyborn's
  hands.</p>

  <p>And then fate threw this vengeful lady into association with Educated
  Evans. And this at a moment when Mr. Arthur Colleyborn was preparing several
  winters' keep.</p>

  <p>The racing world had been greatly mystified by the eccentric running of
  Grub Alley, the four-year-old son of Fleet Court out of Mudslinger. Grub
  Alley was (according to various journalistic estimates):</p>

  <p class="quote">(a) A good horse,<br>
  (b) A rogue,<br>
  (c) Touched in his wind,<br>
  (d) Unreliable.</p>

  <p>There were shrewd people who thought that he was being "fiddled" in
  preparation for a big handicap. Certain bookmakers who had no illusions and
  knew Mr. Colleyborn better than his owner, issued urgent warnings to their
  clients not to lend their names. Grub Alley's owner, a bewildered man who
  never betted, was told by Mr. Colleyborn that one of these days the horse
  would surprise everybody, and was content to let nature take its course. So
  were the turf prophets, who, having tipped him a score of times, left Grub
  Alley severely alone. Which is just what Mr. Colleyborn most earnestly
  desired.</p>

  <p>Grub Alley was in the Newshire Handicap with 7.6 when the curtain rang up
  on this present drama of Misplaced Confidence.</p>

  <p>Educated Evans was a philosopher in all matters except love. When Eros
  aimed his tender dart at Mr. Evans' simple heart (which is poetry but isn't
  intended to be), his judgment went out to 33-1 others.</p>

  <p>"To anything in skirts," said The Miller, shaking his head sadly, "you are
  Blackberries on a Country Road."</p>

  <p>"This young lady," said Mr. Evans soberly, "is Educated. I admit she
  rather resembles the Venus dee Milan&mdash;but beauty's only skin deep as the
  far-famed Cardinal Garnet Wolseley said. She knows more a bout anatomy an'
  bones than any lady I've ever met. She was clurk to a Harley Street
  specialist who lives in Newmarket an' what she don't know about blood
  capsules and other well-known microbes ain't worth talking about."</p>

  <p>"Does she know anything about horses?" Mr. Evans smiled pityingly.</p>

  <p>"She lived in Newmarket an' nearly married three trainers," he replied
  crushingly.</p>

  <p>"And she preferred to marry a gentleman who is doing twelve months for
  assaulting the police," said The Miller.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans was covered with confusion.</p>

  <p>"I'm doin' my duty by her," he said.</p>

  <p>"That's what I'm afraid of," said The Miller cryptically.</p>

  <p>Was it entirely for her intellect or her helplessness that Mr. Evans
  attached himself to Arabella Louker? She was pretty&mdash;whether like the
  Venus de Milo or not is a moot question. Nobody ever saw that lady wearing
  clothes.</p>

  <p>They had met by accident, which was the only possible manner Mr. Evans
  ever met anybody. She was waiting for a 'bus and he was waiting for a 'bus,
  and he said it was a fine day and she agreed. Then she said that the way 'bus
  conductors treated people was a positive disgrace and he agreed. She got off
  at the Cobden statue and so did he. He asked her to have a cup of tea and she
  said she would like one. And that is how it all happened.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube, who loathed Mr. Evans and spoke of him disrespectfully on all
  occasions, referred to Arabella as "Evans' latest pick up," and expressed her
  amazement that a girl so singularly attractive should so descend the scale of
  taste.</p>

  <p>"From what I hear," she told her husband, "Evans is giving her work to do
  at the office. I wish I knew the girl: she might like to pick up a pound now
  and again."</p>

  <p>"I could easily get to know her," said her husband hopefully.</p>

  <p>The suggestion was not well received. "Wimmin have been your ruin," she
  said. He looked at her thoughtfully and was inclined to admit the truth of
  this. But he didn't, for obvious reasons.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Arabella Louker was a nice girl, a pleasant companion and an engaging
  talker. She had been secretary to a Newmarket doctor when Joe Louker crossed
  her path. She was on the point of returning to the medical profession at the
  moment Mr. Evans dawned rosily upon a dreary world which was mainly populated
  by landladies who wanted their arrears of rent, and gentleman acquaintances
  who were anxious to contribute to her support.</p>

  <p>"What I like about you, Mr. Evans," she said once, "is that you don't
  insult me. I've got so tired of walking out with gentlemen and having to
  dodge round back streets so as not to meet their wives and children."</p>

  <p>"I'm a man," said Evans impressively, "not like the well- known Crippen. I
  always say that if education does nothin' else it teaches you to respect
  ladies. As the highly celebrated Queen Elizabeth said to the renowned Duke of
  Wellington&mdash;''</p>

  <p>"What about Newmarket?" asked Arabella, who was not especially interested
  in the great figures of history.</p>

  <p>"I'll run you down to-morrow&mdash;I've ordered me car for six," replied
  Evans. "Not that I think you'll get anything out of Colleyborn. If I could
  only find out whether he's working a coop with Grub Alley, it'd mean a
  fortune in my pocket, Miss Arabella. Bee Face is a stone pinch with him out
  of the way&mdash;''</p>

  <p>"He'll tell me the truth or I'll wring his false heart from his body,"
  said Arabella sombrely. "Oh, if I only knew how to get my own back with that
  false-faced hound!"</p>

  <p>On this evening Mr. Alfred Lube made a great discovery and came post-haste
  to the Headquarters of Old Sam's Midnight Special.</p>

  <p>"That girl he's walkin' out with is a married woman. An' she's a friend of
  Colleyborn. Her an' Evans are gain' down to Newmarket to see Colleyborn. She
  knows him an' I'll bet they're after Grub Alley."</p>

  <p>"By train?" asked Mrs. Lube.</p>

  <p>"They've hired Winkworth's Ford."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube thought rapidly.</p>

  <p>"You go down by train an' don't leave 'em out of your sight," she
  said.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">And the next morning....</p>

  <p>Brightly fell the morning sunlight athwart the one window of Adam's Apple
  Orchard, Bayham Mews. There was no sound in that salubrious <i>cul de sac</i>
  but the impatient kicking of the hungry horses and the chirping of famished
  sparrows.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans turned uneasily in his bed and half awoke with that uneasy
  sensation of impending unpleasantness peculiar to gentlemen incarcerated in
  Pentonville Prison who have an urgent appointment with the executioner at 8
  a.m.</p>

  <p>This unease brought him to wakefulness, and he sat up, blinking. His table
  was piled high with the envelopes he had addressed on the night before; the
  duplicating machine that a child could work (but never had) rested on the
  floor; the wax sheet was already written which, properly placed in the
  duplicator, would enable him to announce to all the world that Bee Face had
  been tried two stone better than Cresta Run, and if a boy could only ride
  him, would come home alone for the Newshire Handicap.</p>

  <p>"Good lord!" gasped Mr. Evans, remembering, and threw his shivering legs
  out of bed, covered them decently with his best trousers, which he drew from
  under the mattress, where they had been carefully laid the night before, and
  began his preparations for an early morning breakfast.</p>

  <p>When the sticks were burning and the kettle making unhappy moaning sounds,
  his spirits revived. By the time he had shaved and had a sluice he was
  ostensibly like himself.</p>

  <p>He heard the thump and splutter of the hired motor-car at the end of the
  mews, swallowed his breakfast hastily, buttoned his collar and put on his
  classiest tie, and though a walking-stick is not a particularly useful piece
  of equipment for a motor-car journey, he took his nearly gold- headed cane
  from the corner and, going out and locking the door, made his way to the
  covered Ford.</p>

  <p>He picked up his lady friend ten minutes later (she was surprisingly
  punctual), and in two winks, as it were, the car was bumping through Epping
  Forest.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans seized the opportunity to explain the growing importance of
  exact information on the Newshire Handicap. There was reason enough for his
  anxiety. The Newshire Handicap had suddenly become an item of important
  public interest by reason of the fact that the wealthy Australian owner of
  one of the candidates had, under the influence of good cheer and other
  refreshment at a public dinner, announced that he would give the whole of his
  winnings (if he won) to the hospitals; and for the first time in its history
  the Newshire Handicap was the subject of ante-post betting. Which meant that
  there was as much dead meat in that race as any of the Spring handicaps.</p>

  <p>The Newshire Handicap had also been a subject of newspaper comment and
  analysis. More than this, Mr. Evans had received inquiries from his clientele
  concerning this event.</p>

  <p>"I know Colleyborn," said Arabella. "He's the sort of man who gives
  nothing away. If I could tell you, Mr. Evans, what I've done for that man,
  you'd be surprised&mdash;typed his letters, et cetera, et cetera, and all I
  got was a seven and sixpenny dinner and a four shilling bottle of Beaune!
  I've not so much as had a ring or a bracelet watch out of him. And if he's
  going to work one of his dirty tricks on the public, and I can get the news
  beforehand, it'll break his 'eart&mdash;heart, I mean."</p>

  <p>"If it comes to presents&mdash;'' began Evans, in a munificent mood, but
  she was one of those girls who listened best when she was talking
  herself.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't have married but for him," she rattled on. "I said to him:
  'Arthur, if I leave you, you'll rue the day.' I said to him: 'Arthur, I'm
  going to get my own back on you if it takes me twenty years.' "</p>

  <p>"What did he say?" asked the interested Evans.</p>

  <p>"He just sneered," said Arabella, "and scoffed."</p>

  <p>"A man like that ought to be pole-axed," said Mr. Evans passionately.
  "He's worse than the well-known Edward the Eighth who had ten wives and had
  their heads cut off and hung up in a private room. He's worse than the
  far-famed Looey the Nineteenth, him that got into trouble over Lewdcreature
  Burgia, the female Crippen of Italy."</p>

  <p>"He's a dirty dog," said Arabella expressively, in the language of the
  twentieth century.</p>

  <p>Newmarket bounced into view at last. Strings of horses wandering aimlessly
  about the Heath; tiny boys in tight leggings; bored trainers following their
  strings home, and discussing loudly the new show at Drury Lane and other
  sporting matters.</p>

  <p>"There he is," said Arabella suddenly. "Stop the car."</p>

  <p>The car needed very little encouragement. It stopped. Arabella got out and
  walked towards a rather red-faced, youngish-looking man who was striding
  across the Heath on the way to the town. Unhappily for him, he was not
  mounted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there you are!" said Arabella's voice, and Mr. Evans thought he heard
  a groan.</p>

  <p>He watched them strolling about the Heath, saw Mr. Colleyborn's arms
  raised in frantic protest, saw Miss Arabella shake her fist under his
  nose.... Evans sat and purred. Never had he seen racing information being
  extracted in such a picturesque manner.</p>

  <p>After a quarter of an hour she walked rapidly back to the car.</p>

  <p>"You wait in the town and have a bite," she said. "Me and Colleyborn's
  going to talk things over."</p>

  <p>"Does he know who I am?" asked Mr. Evans, in some alarm, realising the
  terrible things that had happened to touts at Newmarket. (He had once been
  shown a mound of earth which was locally called the Ditch, but which a
  trainer had told him was a secret burial place of murdered watchers.)</p>

  <p>"Yes, he knows who you are. You don't suppose I've got any secrets about
  my friends?" she said. "But Mr. Colleyborn's a very nice man and you needn't
  be afraid."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans found an eating-house.</p>

  <p>When he had finished and got back to the car, the driver handed him a
  note.</p>

  <p>"A boy left it with me to give to you."</p>

  <p>"DEAR MR. EVANS," ran the epistle, "I've had a very long talk with Mr.
  Colleyborn, and he's realised what a terrible mistake he made by giving me
  up. He says that Grub Alley won't finish in the first three, but the other
  trainer's told him that Bee Face is a certainty. I'm sorry I can't come back
  with you, but Mr. Colleyborn wants me to type a few letters for him, and for
  old time's sake and because of the Past I am willing to forget and
  forgive."</p>

  <p>With this information in his inside pocket Educated Evans sped back to
  London, a happy man.</p>

  <p>Alfred Lube, who had watched the arrival of the car, who had seen the
  coming of the note, who had been a witness of that poignant scene upon the
  Heath, also sped back in greater comfort.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, Emma," he reported breathlessly to his wife. "That girl's
  got the information for Evans, and we ain't goin' to be caught this
  time."</p>

  <p>Wherefore did Old Sam's Midnight Special come out flamboyantly,
  recommending all clients old and new to go their limit, have their shirts on,
  and generally to support Grub Alley (there were ten stars against Grub
  Alley).</p>

  <p>A more dignified communication was that made by Educated Evans.</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">EDUCATED EVANS,<br>

  <p>He was not unnaturally annoyed when Grub Alley won at 7-1.</p>

  <p>Annoyance and resentment went hand in hand on this occasion, and he
  carried his sorrows to The Miller. Inspector Arbuthnot Challoner listened
  unsympathetically.</p>

  <p>"Your so-and-so tip cost me two pounds," he said savagely. "Arabella
  twisted you, you poor mutt! And she's received the price of her villainy! I
  saw Colleyborn's Bentley outside Woolworth's yesterday."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story13"
     name="story13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE KIDNAPPING OF MR. EVANS</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was a certain head lad who had a number of private
  clients. Which is not allowed by any of the rules of racing.</p>

  <p>He was a purveyor of very excellent information, but he had few clients,
  and those did not advertise him, for a very obvious reason.</p>

  <p>Then one day he came from the country to Camden Town to stay with a sister
  who had done very well and married into the laundry trade, and to her he
  poured forth the sum of his trouble. "I had three winners last week and got
  nothing out of it," he complained. "Now if I only had a bit of money and
  could advertise in another name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What about the Lubeses?" asked his sister suddenly.</p>

  <p>She knew Mrs. Lube personally. They shared in common an immense admiration
  for John Barrymore in Tragics and Charlie Chaplin in Comics.</p>

  <p>"Her grandfather has got a paper&mdash;I bet he'd do something for
  you."</p>

  <p>The head lad cogitated this, "What about this chap Evans?" he asked. His
  sister turned up a nose that was by nature tip-tilted.</p>

  <p>"Him!" she said scornfully. "He made us pay for a shirt he said we lost! I
  wouldn't have dealings with a common man like that."</p>

  <p>So the introduction to the Lubeses followed. Mrs. Lube came to tea and met
  the head lad, whose name&mdash;well, never mind his name. At first the
  conversation was general. Then the head lad casually mentioned his
  profession; then he remarked on the valuelessness of watching gallops if you
  can't make money out of them.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube listened and quivered. She stayed after tea and came again that
  night, and she and the wicked head lad talked head to head and the conference
  was in every way successful.</p>

  <p>A week after this, Mr. Evans was watering the geranium that represented
  the garden of Abbot's Speed House. He was in a complacent frame of mind. He
  had sent out one horse that had won at 6-4 and one that had been short-
  headed at 100-8. Hard lines! Hard lines!</p>

  <p>It was not his custom to purchase Old Sam's Midnight Special.</p>

  <p>"Why should I throw away threepence on <i>his</i> Five Pound Special?" he
  was wont to remark. "When I got information of me own <i>v.</i> pickin' 'em
  out with a pin?"</p>

  <p>It was The Miller who brought the most sensational issue of the
  Special.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Evans," he said pleasantly. "Seen this?"</p>

  <p>Evans' lip curled.</p>

  <p>"I never read muck," he said.</p>

  <p>"That is why your messages to the deluded public are so full of spelling
  mistakes," said The Miller, and placed before the educated man the "Extra
  Special Issue."</p>

  <p>It was printed on green paper&mdash;which Evans wouldn't dream of using
  because it was notoriously unlucky. Evans picked it up and his eye was
  arrested by the hysterical headline.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">Secret Information by the Grandest Informer who will give
  Winners Galore! No more Educated 6-4 chances! No more swank bluff and babble!
  No more Educated Humbug by a so-called 'prophet'! News that nobody knows! Not

     style="text-align:center">Send T.M.O. 10s. to Winner Mansions, Little
     Hillington Street.<br>
  Old Sam's Grand Winner!</p><br>

  <p>"This," said Evans rapidly and indignantly, "is mere stuff and nonsense
  and uneducated twaddle! This is mere playgaring and sheer swank! This man Old
  Sam is a mere beer-eatin' patrician that ought to be in an asylum for goats.
  Education! Look at the spelling&mdash;look at the vulgarity and commonness of
  it! He's worse than Charlie Peace the far-famed inventor of the Chamber of
  Horrors; he reminds me of the man they couldn't 'ang; he's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What is the source of this interesting information?" interrupted The
  Miller. "Do you know anything about the winner of the Colebeach
  Handicap?"</p>

  <p>"Do I know?" scoffed Evans. "Ain't I had Hambone from the boy who does
  him? Ain't I seen him with my own eyes beat Abbot's Speed in a trial?"</p>

  <p>"No," said The Miller, "you haven't."</p>

  <p>But Mr. Evans was not abashed.</p>

  <p>"I got this horse from a gentleman who goes to the same barber as the
  owner; this Hambone could win this race an' laugh at the rest. He could win
  on a tight rein or a loose rein. He could get left at the post an' then trot
  it."</p>

  <p>The Miller listened patiently.</p>

  <p>"Hambone was scratched this afternoon&mdash;now tell me another lie."</p>

  <p>But it took more than that to upset Mr. Evans. "Scratched&mdash;tut-tut!
  An' yet, after what the owner told me, I ought to have expected it. 'Evans,'
  he says, 'I don't know whether to run this horse in the Colebeach or keep him
  for the Royal Hunt Cup,' he says. So I says to him: 'Whatever you do, me
  lord, don't show the horse up'&mdash;an' he's took my advice."</p>

  <p>"You don't know anything about the Colebeach Handicap," accused The Miller
  wrathfully. "Until you saw this paper, you had no idea that there was such a
  race."</p>

  <p>Evans closed his eyes, hurt but dignified.</p>

  <p>"I was goin' down to Newmarket specially to gee it run," he said.</p>

  <p>"It's run at Haydock Park," said The Miller unkindly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans might dismiss the frenzied claim of Old Sam lightly, but in his
  secret heart he was troubled and uneasy. Never before had Mrs. Lube made so
  confident a statement. He sensed, behind the blatant claim, the very core of
  sincerity.</p>

  <p>That night he pored over the entries. Elbowed, Mognato, Binny Bird, Sweep,
  Obah,</p>

  <p>Lucy Lala....</p>

  <p>He paused at this. Lucy Lala was trained in a little stable that sometimes
  sent out two winners a year, but sometimes didn't. The trainer trained a few
  horses, as he told everybody, for his own amusement and the amusement of his
  friends. Apparently they had an enlarged sense of humour, or else they got a
  lot of fun out of paying their training bills.</p>

  <p>Evans shook his head. No, that couldn't be it. He went further.</p>

  <p>Happy Grin, Yangtse, Mogador, Bony Bertie...</p>

  <p>He conned and conned till his eyes ached. And as he studied and thought,
  he reached a conclusion. It must be Yangtse.</p>

  <p>He began laboriously to inscribe a pronunciamento which commenced:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Information from my new special and secret
  watcher..."</p><br>

  <p>He finished his work and went abroad for refreshment. In the meantime Mrs.
  Lube snatched the still wet sheet from her grandfather's hand. She, too, had
  been working a duplicator and had not observed the entrance of her
  ancestor.</p>

  <p>"You're not supposed to read that, gran'father," she said sharply.</p>

  <p>Old Sam, who could read just well enough to decipher "<span class=
  "smcap">Lucy Lala****</span>" in big black type, murmured his apologies.</p>

  <p>"Is that the horse you sent us?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>He addressed the head lad, who, with Mr. Alfred Lube, were the other
  occupants of the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"Take this two shillings and go out. Gran'father," said Mrs. Lube tartly.
  "And don't go stickin' your nose into business that don't concern you."</p>

  <p>When he had gone the head lad emphasised the wonder of his tip.</p>

  <p>"I saw this horse tried&mdash;it's the biggest pinch that ever looked
  through a bridle, and if it don't bring you&mdash;us&mdash;in a thousand
  pounds, I don't know what will."</p>

  <p>He spent the evening telling them how fortunate they were in having met
  him. And whilst this was going on there was another and less pleasant
  meeting.</p>

  <p>It is a fact that Old Sam, who occasionally described himself as the
  Seventh Wonder of the Sporting World, but who, in more modest moments, was
  content with the less provocative title, "The Wizard of Camden
  Town"&mdash;this Old Sam was normally a gentle, almost humble soul. Ere his
  masterful granddaughter had forced him into the hazardous business of
  anticipating the intentions of clever stables, he had been content to hold up
  one wall of the White Hart, which feat he accomplished by the simple process
  of standing outside the hostelry all day and applying his back to it; in this
  status he was affable, courteous, ready for the price of a pint (which before
  Hell Broke Loose in Europe was 2d.) to run an "arrand" or keep an eye upon a
  taxi whilst its owner had one, and sometimes two, inside.</p>

  <p>But when Old Sam, through the strivings and pushings of Mrs. Lube,
  developed into the proprietor of Old Sam's Midnight Special he was no longer
  normal. For normality to Old Sam was a condition of mild fuddlement, beer
  being the instrument of his semi-insensibility. Prosperity brought spirits;
  spirits aroused in him a fierce pugnacity which was not consonant with his
  advanced age. So that he never met Educated Evans in the street but that he
  hurled upon that man of singular erudition the most opprobrious and bitter
  gibes.</p>

  <p>Evans bore his trials with a certain haughty dignity, until one day he was
  passing a quiet evening in that same White Hart. He was, in point of fact,
  instructing the mind of Miss Eveline, the new barmaid, whose mind was not
  quite as plastic as a large piece of wood.</p>

  <p>"... take botomy. Tomatoes are fruit&mdash;very few people know that. Take
  apples&mdash;or <i>pomme de terres</i>, named after the celebrated racehorse
  that I give when he won at Ascot, or it may have been Goodwood, what a
  beauty! Take the day an' night, so called because the world, which is the
  shape of a orange, revolves round the sun once in twenty- four hours. Take
  Shakespeare, him that wrote the pieces which we all admire&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Take Shakespeare!" grated a hateful voice. "You couldn't take Shakespeare
  if they paid yer!"</p>

  <p>Evans turned his head slightly and looked significantly at the
  barmaid.</p>

  <p>"He's had Enough," he said meaningly.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't take Shakespeare from the Cobden stature to the Euston
  Road," sneered Old Sam as he lurched to the bar.</p>

  <p>"An' there ain't a 'orse called Shakespeare. Don't take none of his tips,
  miss, or you'll die in the work'us. A double scotch and a splash, miss."</p>

  <p>Despite Mr. Evans' warning, the young lady with the diamond brooch served
  the old man deftly.</p>

  <p>"You're a swindlin' 'ound," said Old Sam with great gravity. "You're a
  common pinprickin' perishin' piecan."</p>

  <p>He tossed down the fiery liquid. Mr. Evans ostensibly ignored him.</p>

  <p>"You're one of those people that can't find winners&mdash;Lucy
  Lala&mdash;what a beauty, what a beauty!"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" said Evans, instantly attentive.</p>

  <p>As instantly, as his ghastly error came to him, was Old Sam
  sober&mdash;and Old Sam sober was a gentle soul.</p>

  <p>"What was I a-sayin' of?" he quavered, passing his hand before his eyes.
  "Did I say anything I oughtn't to have said, Mr. Evans?" Evans' soul was
  filled with a great exaltation. "You said Lucy Lala!" he said.</p>

  <p>Which was a great mistake on Evans' part. He saw Old Sam reel from the
  bar, and waited only till the door swung close before he followed. Little he
  imagined, as he worked feverishly at a new composition advising all and
  sundry to</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">Bet blind on<br>
  LUCY LALA***<br>
  Don't take notice of previous messages sent in error.</p><br>

  <p class="first">that old Sam, rather tearful, was facing his enraged
  relatives with the story of his blunder.</p>

  <p>Midnight was striking when a knock came to the door of Mr. Evans' flat. A
  diminutive boy in leggings was revealed in the lamplight.</p>

  <p>"Are you the celebrated Educated Evans, the World's Champion Turf
  Prophet?"</p>

  <p>He seemed to be recalling a sentence well learnt.</p>

  <p>"That's me, my boy," said Evans graciously. "Lord Iggerman wants to see
  you urgent," said the youth.</p>

  <p>Evans gasped. Lord Iggerham was one of the greatest of the owners.</p>

  <p>"To see me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; he says he don't want you to tip a horse of his."</p>

  <p>That was quite understandable. Evans saw nothing remarkable in the
  request.</p>

  <p>"Very good, my boy&mdash;where is his lordship?"</p>

  <p>"At the Midlands Goods Yard," was the staggering reply. "He's in his
  special train."</p>

  <p>Evans was intrigued. He followed his guide through the streets&mdash;but
  it was some distance from the goods yard that the special train was waiting,
  and to reach it involved dodging officious railway foremen and traversing a
  bewildering maze of railway lines. And in truth, his lordship's special train
  had the appearance of being a string of horse boxes.</p>

  <p>The lad climbed up and opened a door.</p>

  <p>"In here, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans swung himself up to the dark interior of the small compartment
  in which stable boys usually travel. As he did so, the door closed with a
  crash and he heard a key turn.</p>

  <p>He tried to open the windows, but they were fast.</p>

  <p>In the darkness Mr. Alf Lube and the head lad watched happily.</p>

  <p>"He's all right," said the head lad, before climbing into another coach.
  "When we get to Salisbury I'll have the coach shunted&mdash;you needn't worry
  about him."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube was waiting for her husband.</p>

  <p>"I've been in his room," she said, "an' the low common swindler was
  sendin' out our horse! This'll learn him a lesson!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At four o'clock the next afternoon Mr. Evans woke from an
  exhausted sleep to hear the door unlocked.</p>

  <p>"Hullo&mdash;what are you doing here?" demanded a railway man
  suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Where's this?" demanded Evans.</p>

  <p>"Salisbury&mdash;hop it!"</p>

  <p>Evans crawled out and made his way to the nearest bar. If there was a law
  in the land, the Lubeses should sleep that night in Albany Street Police
  Station.</p>

  <p>The plot was clear&mdash;they were stopping him sending out Lucy Lala...
  if only he hadn't sent out a horse at all for that race! Yangtse! What a
  horse to send!</p>

  <p>All night long he'd been remembering that Yangtse was touched in the wind
  and couldn't gallop on hard going and didn't like left-hand courses and
  wasn't any good over a mile.</p>

  <p>A newspaper boy shouted his wares, and Evans with a sinking and bitter
  heart went out to buy a paper. He opened it slowly and saw the headline:</p>

  <p class="headline">A TRAGEDY FOR BACKERS.<br>
  Yangtse wins Handicap at 20-1;<br>
  Lucy Lala, a hot favourite, finishes last.</p><br>

  <p>Mr. Evans drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"Information v. gaswork," he murmured, and went inside again to
  refresh.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="story14"
     name="story14"></a>XIV. &mdash; EDUCATED EVANS DECLARES TO WIN</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. EVANS had many detractors. He had some admirers who
  stuck to him through thick and thin: men who could see no wrong in him. For
  example, one Harry Wissell was such a man. He was a good-looking and athletic
  young man who might have broken into the most exclusive circles, instead of
  which he broke into houses, occasionally with profit to
  himself&mdash;occasionally to disappear from town into what is
  euphemistically called "the country."</p>

  <p>The secret of his adoration of the educated man was no secret to police
  headquarters. During one of the periods of his retirement Mr. Evans, who was
  a kind-hearted man, had come to the rescue of Wissell's aged and ailing
  mother. In other words, he had paid her fine when she was charged with:</p>

  <p>(a) Being drunk and disorderly.</p>

  <p>(b) Assaulting Police-Constable Jones in the execution of his duty.</p>

  <p>(c) Doing wilful damage to the extent of 13s. 4d. by tearing up the
  blanket with which she was supplied in the cell.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Mr. Evans had written her defence, which she read from the dock
  and which began:</p>

  <p>"Your Worship, Situated as I am, the mother of a large family, I feel my
  position acute. For years I have suffered from giddiness, pains in the head,
  rheumatism and other excruciating pains too numerous to mention...."</p>

  <p>Anyway, she was fined, though the magistrate expressed his doubt as to
  whether he was wise in loosing her upon an unoffending world.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Wissell gained a certain sanctity soon after the release of her son
  by falling in the Regent's Canal and drowning herself; and Harry never forgot
  what he owed to his benefactor.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Evans," he said on one occasion, "if I could do you a turn I'd walk
  from here to Highgate Archway on me bare feet."</p>

  <p>And he meant it. He did many a good turn to Mr. Evans, notably when young
  Mr. Lube, flushed with wine and victory (for Old Sam's Midnight Special had
  given three winners in succession), made disparaging remarks about the
  educated man. It was unfortunate for him that Harry was present.</p>

  <p>"Educated Evans?" said All Lube, smiling pityingly. "Why, he ain't a man,
  he's no better than a bit of horse-radish! Education! I could talk his head
  off, before witnesses or private&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>"Here!" said Mr. Wissell.</p>

  <p>Alf looked round, but did not recognise danger.</p>

  <p>"I'm talkin' about Educated Evans&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"You called him a bit of horse-radish," said Harry.</p>

  <p>The landlord, recognising the symptoms, leaned over the zinc bar.</p>

  <p>"Outside! he hissed.</p>

  <p>They went, Alf Lube unwillingly. He returned to the bosom of his family
  that night slightly altered.</p>

  <p>"And that's what I'd do to anybody who said a word against you, Mr.
  Evans," said Harry.</p>

  <p>Evans grasped him by the hand.</p>

  <p>"But if you see Mrs. Lube you might tell her that I knew nothing about
  it."</p>

  <p>"If I see Mrs. Lube she'll be sorry," said Harry ominously.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans almost wished they would meet.</p>

  <p>His friend had expressed only one regret: he could not help Mr. Evans in
  his own particular business.</p>

  <p>"I don't know no racin' people, Mr. Evans," he said regretfully. "I wish I
  did."</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, Harry," said Educated Evans, with a quiet smile. "I know 'em
  all. Take Lord Durby: him an' me's like brothers. When I take off me hat to
  him he takes off his hat to me. Take the celebrated Lord Wool&mdash;what's
  his name&mdash;him that invented Johnny Walker. I've slept in his park often
  an' often. Take Steve&mdash;I don't know his brother Pat so well&mdash;me an'
  Steve often meet in the Jockey Club."</p>

  <p>"You do get about, don't you?" said his admirer, awe- stricken.</p>

  <p>Evans smiled.</p>

  <p>"It's education," he said simply. "It's knowin' hist'ry an' breedin' an'
  geography."</p>

  <p>"If I ever get hold of a winner&mdash;" began Harry.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans was amused.</p>

  <p>A week later he was wishing somebody would get hold of a winner&mdash;for
  they had succeeded in eluding his own grasp.</p>

  <p>So sure had Mr. Evans been that a certain thing would happen at Epsom that
  he had painted a new signboard for his door&mdash;"The Priory Park." In a fit
  of great depression he had painted this out, and was half-way through his
  task of transforming that lordly demesne into "Embargo Chambers," when The
  Miller, whose other name was Detective-Inspector Arbuthnot Challoner, came in
  unobserved and stood silently regarding the artist's efforts.</p>

  <p>"You're a bad sign-painter but a first-class liar," he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans started and turned, blinking up at the newcomer.</p>

  <p>"Bless me life and soul, Mr. Challoner!" he said mildly. "You creep in and
  out like the celebrated Shylock Holmes, of Upper Baker Street, N.W. You
  remind me of the far-famed Lady Macduff, who walked in her sleep&mdash;see
  Shakespeare."</p>

  <p>"I'd hate to tell you what you remind me of," said The Miller gently, and
  added: "You gave Priory Park for the City and Suburban."</p>

  <p>"The eleventh hour wire&mdash;" pleaded Evans.</p>

  <p>"Was Priory Park," said the remorseless Miller, "and your fifty-ninth
  second tip was that same dilatory animal."</p>

  <p>"I got to get me living," said Evans, and went on calmly with his
  fraudulent sign-work. "Them Lubeses tipped Kinnaird. If you find winners by
  gaswork you're bound to be right sooner or later. My information was that
  Priory Park couldn't lose."</p>

  <p>"My information was that it did," said The Miller, "and I backed him on
  your advice! Men have been certified as mentally unsound for less."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans paused in his work and smiled.</p>

  <p>"I got one for you at Newmarket next week that'll come home by himself.
  This horse has been tried&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is it Call Boy?" asked the ruthless Miller. Mr. Evans admitted it
  was.</p>

  <p>"How do you get hold of these stable secrets?" asked the
  detective-inspector with an exaggerated expression of surprise.</p>

  <p>Evans was not embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"I got it from a chap who knows the chauffeur who drives the car of Mr.
  What's-his-name, the celebrated author of the play that the owner of Call Boy
  acts in. It's all about crooks."</p>

  <p>"It's a pity he doesn't know you, Evans," said The Miller, who was in his
  sourest mood. "He could write a play about you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans smirked.</p>

  <p>"I was thinkin' of goin' on the stage," he said surprisingly. "I happen to
  know a young lady who's an actress&mdash;at least, she's not exactly an
  actress but she does the young ladies of the chorus."</p>

  <p>"Robs them or robes them?" asked The Miller, interested. "You mean she's a
  dresser?" Evans nodded.</p>

  <p>"It must be a wonderful life," he said, rising stiffly. "Her father keeps
  the 'Grey Dog' down at Lambourn&mdash;well, he don't exactly keep it, but
  he's got a job there. I never had such information in me life," he said
  enthusiastically. "I got a horse running at Newmarket next week that could
  fall down, take a nap and then win. There's another horse that I got for
  Chester that's Home. Did you want to see me about anything, Mr. Miller?"</p>

  <p>The Miller wanted to see him very badly about something. Harry Wissell,
  notoriously a client of Evans, had vanished from London as though the ground
  had opened under him and swallowed him up. And coincident with this
  disappearance came a complaint from the Berkshire police that Highlow, an
  historic mansion, had been broken into and an article of value, to wit a
  nearly gold pencil, had been removed.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen him lately?" asked The Miller.</p>

  <p>Evans shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Challoner."</p>

  <p>"Well, you'd better give him a wide berth." warned The Miller. "The
  Berkshire police are pretty certain it was he who broke into
  Frithington-Evans' place. He didn't pinch much, which was remarkable.
  Frithington-Evans was in the next room&mdash;you know him, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Evans knew him very well.</p>

  <p>Mr. Frithington-Evans was one of those rich men who hated spending money.
  His meanness, his general unpleasantness, have been canvassed in earlier
  adventures. He changed his jockeys monthly and his trainer every half-year,
  and lived the tortured life of one who was certain that he was being robbed
  all the time by somebody or other.</p>

  <p>It fell to Mr. Challoner to call upon this gentleman, for he had a very
  wide acquaintance with the methods of the suspected man.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;it looks like Wissell's work&mdash;he always lifts
  casement windows off their hinges."</p>

  <p>Mr. Frithington-Evans stood by during the inspection, biting his
  nails.</p>

  <p>"Why the devil don't you catch him?" he demanded irritably. "That is your
  job, my friend.' '</p>

  <p>"So I'm told," said The Miller coolly.</p>

  <p>You must remember that he was once a public school boy and monied
  insolence neither rattled nor impressed him.</p>

  <p>"Don't be impertinent, please," snapped Frithington.</p>

  <p>The Miller almost lost his inspectorship and Mr. Frithington-Evans as
  nearly gained a thick ear.</p>

  <p>"He must have broken into the very next room to the library where I was
  sitting," said the aggrieved young man.</p>

  <p>"Were you alone?"</p>

  <p>"I was not alone: I had my trainer, Mr. Bluson, here, and we were
  discussing&mdash;er&mdash;business."</p>

  <p>All the racing man in The Miller ached to ask him whether the business had
  to do with a certain maiden race at Newmarket in which Mr. Frithington-Evans
  had two horses, called Blain and Woggle, engaged. That morning there had
  appeared a paragraph in the papers that Woggle was a doubtful runner, having
  picked up a nail at exercise. But Blain looked to have a. rosy chance. Mr.
  Frithington-Evans became communicative.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth, Inspector, we were discussing a horse of
  mine&mdash;if you were a betting man I would advise you to back it&mdash;it
  is called Blain and it will win on Friday."</p>

  <p>The Miller murmured his gratitude.</p>

  <p>Soon after he went back to town to look for the missing Mr. Wissell.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Evans was dozing when the gentle knock came to his door.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Harry&mdash; Wissell, Mr. Evans," came the whispered reply.</p>

  <p>Evans got out of bed and opened the door. "Seen The Miller?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"I ain't," said Bill, "but I don't mind seein' him. I got a alibi the size
  of a house. I bin stayin' with a friend at Brighton as I can prove on me
  oath...."</p>

  <p>His voice sank to a whisper... Mr. Evans listened eagerly, punctuating the
  story of Harry Wissell with innumerable "Bless my soul's" and "Good gracious
  me's."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Frithington-Evans was not a very popular man with the
  rulers of the turf. There was one noble lord who, besides being a steward of
  the Jockey Club, had the dubious advantage of being related by marriage.</p>

  <p>His lordship was a man with a grim sense of humour, and he had one
  hobby&mdash;he collected the literature of advertising and other
  tipsters.</p>

  <p>On the morning the Highstreet Maiden Stakes was decided he met Mr.
  Frithington-Evans strolling in the paddock.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Snoopy." By this pet name was Mr. Frithington-Evans called
  in the secret circles of his family. "Are you running Blain in the Maiden
  Stakes?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Snoopy. "I was hoping to run both, but Woggle picked up a nail
  at exercise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I read the paragraph. Why run him if he's unfit?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Frithington-Evans shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"He is only short of a few gallops and it will do him no harm to see a
  race-course," he said. "Blain is a two-stone better horse, and of course I am
  declaring to win with him. That is, if Woggle runs. I'm not so sure. My
  trainer said he'd come to a decision this morning and send him on by
  motor-box. He hasn't arrived yet."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said his relative. "Lexleigh was asking me whether he should back
  him."</p>

  <p>"You can tell Lord Lexleigh with my compliments," said Snoopy, with his
  sweetest smile, "that he can back Blain without the slightest fear. I have
  been carefully through the list of runners, and I'm perfectly sure there's
  nothing in the race that can beat him."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said the steward again, and went on his way.</p>

  <p>Mr. Frithington-Evans had not many friends, but there was still a large
  number of people who did not know enough to keep away from him, and from the
  paddock to the private stands he was stopped every few yards, and to all and
  sundry, friends, semi-friends, nearly enemies and the loathsome, he told all
  he knew (as he said) frankly and without reservation.</p>

  <p>When the numbers went up into the frame, a board was also hoisted:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Frithington-Evans declares to win with Blain."</p>

  <p>Blain carried his first colours, was ridden by his stable jockey; and
  Woggle, who did appear after all, had up a stable lad and the second colours.
  Blain opened at 7-4, and was a tight 11-10 chance when the tapes went up.</p>

  <p>Nobody noticed Woggle, for he was running on the stand side, until the
  field came into the dip, and then he was seen; but for all his second colours
  and his stable-lad rider, he was four lengths clear of his field. It was more
  nearly six lengths when they passed the post.</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary!" said Mr. Frithington-Evans to the nearest scowling
  acquaintance. "I have never been so shocked in my life. I had my usual pony
  on Blain. We tried them twenty-eight pounds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't believe in fairies," snarled his acquaintance.</p>

  <p>To the paddock, after the "All Right" had been called, came Snoopy's
  lordly relative, and, taking him by the arm, he led him into a quiet
  corner.</p>

  <p>"Great surprise for you, eh? Terrible shock and all that sort of
  thing?"</p>

  <p>"I assure you, sir&mdash;" began Snoopy. "Read this."</p>

  <p>The steward took from his pocket a document which was soon to be added to
  his historic collection. Frithington-Evans frowned and read.</p><br>

  yourself, and don't forget the family motto of Educated Evans is "Information

  <p>Mr. Frithington-Evans turned white and red.</p>

  <p>"That damned burglar must have told him!" he gasped, and in the agitation
  of the moment did not realise his self-betrayal.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Yes, I backed it," said The Miller slowly, "but I'm very
  anxious to know who was your informant. It wasn't by any chance a larcenist
  who has succeeded in persuading some Brighton friends to perjure themselves,
  was it? He didn't glue his ear to the keyhole while Mr. Frithington-Evans was
  discussing matters with his trainer, did he? Come across, Evans. I'd like to
  know all about it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans closed his eyes ecstatically.</p>

  <p>"Information v. gaswork" he murmured, and added: "What a beauty!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story15"
     name="story15"></a>XV. &mdash; FOR EVANS' SAKE</h2>

  <p class="first">DETECTIVE-INSPECTOR CHALLONER strolled along the Hampstead
  Road, his hands behind him, a new straw clenched between his teeth, and an
  introspective frown on his face.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he could notice the approach of Joe Maycart, and observed
  with satisfaction that, at the sight of him, Joe did not recall a previous
  engagement and turn back, nor did he cross the road to avoid meeting with
  this representative of the law. Instead he quickened his step and appeared
  eager for conversation.</p>

  <p>"Lor'lumme, Inspector," he said breathlessly, "you seen Evans?"</p>

  <p>"Not for two days&mdash;why?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Maycart's eyes bulged.</p>

  <p>"He's gotta fur-line' coat! Fur all round the collar&mdash;an' gloves!
  When he come into the 'Cow an' Garter' last night, everybody took off their
  'ats!"</p>

  <p>News, indeed, but:</p>

  <p>"Is there any particular reason why he shouldn't wear a fur- lined coat?"
  asked The Miller blandly. "Has anybody lost one?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" Joe made haste to free himself of the imputation that he was
  "nosing" on any man. "It's straight&mdash;he must have bought it off a man up
  in Caledonian Market. They say that Mrs. Lube's linin' Old Sam's ulster with
  an 'earthrug. But Evans&mdash;what a lad!"</p>

  <p>The Miller had no intention whatever of visiting the home of learning that
  morning, but curiosity to examine the cause of such local excitement brought
  him to Masked Marvel Mansions.</p>

  <p>He discovered Mr. Evans in his shirt sleeves, for the educated man was
  turning the handle of the Patent Duplicator that a Child could Manipulate,
  and it was hot work.</p>

  <p>On a peg driven into the wall hung The Coat. The very sight of it was
  enough to induce a mild perspiration.</p>

  <p>"Business is doin' well," said Evans, pausing to wipe his forehead. "I'm
  just sendin' out to 3,742 clients the glad tidings about my Lincoln
  horse&mdash;Cora: fear nothing!"</p>

  <p>"Where did you get the coat?" asked The Miller, examining the garment
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"Sable," said Evans calmly. "Used to belong to the Grand Duke
  what's-his-name; sable or muck-squash."</p>

  <p>"Muck-squash, I should say," said The Miller; "raised in a rabbit hutch.
  What's the idea? It's getting warm."</p>

  <p>Evans raised his shoulders and smiled.</p>

  <p>"I've a position to keep up," he said simply. " 'As a bird is known by his
  note so is a man by his apparelations'&mdash;Shakespeare. All celebrated
  people are classy dressers. Look at Bo Bunghole, the dandy of Bath an' Wells.
  Look at the far-famed Lord Dishralli, the well-known Prime Minister; look at
  Owing Nares, the highly respected acting gentleman. Besides&mdash;"<br>
  "Besides what?" asked The Miller, when he paused.</p>

  <p>Evans coughed.</p>

  <p>"My young lady likes it," he said, with an attempt at offhandedness.</p>

  <p>The Miller's mouth opened.</p>

  <p>"What, another?"</p>

  <p>Evans smiled.</p>

  <p>"This young lady's different," he said. "She's what you might call an
  'eyebrow.' Very superior&mdash;don't know nothing about racing&mdash;mad on
  classicals&mdash; poetry, picture paintin', artistic stone
  masonry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sculpture," said The Miller helpfully.</p>

  <p>"Everythin' like that. She don't even know I'm on the turf&mdash;can't
  bear racin'&mdash;everythin' like that's low. But poetry&mdash;! She's fair
  pot&mdash;mad about it. She likes mine."</p>

  <p>"Yours!" said The Miller, aghast.</p>

  <p>Evans went to his hanging jacket and took out a folded paper. He was
  flushed and his eyes were bright.</p>

  <p>"I just dashed it off last night," he said carelessly. "Never knew I had
  the gift till I tried. It's funny how a person can have poetry inside him and
  never know it."</p>

  <p>The Miller unfolded the sheet slowly and read the title.</p>

  <p class="cp"><i>"To a Lady of Manchester Square."</i></p>

  <p>"After 'Errick, the celebrated poem maker," explained Evans. "She's very
  fond of 'Errick."</p>

  <p>"Eric who?" The Miller was wilfully dense.</p>

  <p>"I don't know his other name," confessed Mr. Evans. "It's probably a Nong
  de Plume." The Miller read:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"The world turns round in twenty-four hours,<br>
  Thus causing the night and the day,<br>
  Also the seasons, hence the flowers,<br>
  Or so the people say."</p><br>

  <p>"That's not bad," said The Miller.</p>

  <p>"It's education," said Evans gravely. "My young lady's like that&mdash;she
  wears glasses." The Miller attacked the second stanza.</p>

  <p class="verse">"Thou are not like Lewdcreature Burgia,<br>
  The female Crippen of France,<br>
  Thou art like the Princess of Surgia,<br>
  Who gave every gentleman a chance."</p><br>

  <p>"Who is the Princess and where is Surgia?" Mr. Evans rubbed his nose.</p>

  <p>"I made that bit up," he admitted. "Poet's licence."</p>

  <p>"Issued by the Jockey Club?"</p>

  <p>"Post Office," said Evans. "I've never seen one but I've heard of 'em. I
  put in 'France' because 'Italy' wouldn't rhyme."</p>

  <p>The Miller resumed.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">I worship the pavement where your fairy feet<br>
  Pedestrianates so bright and neat.<br>
  You're like the wife of the well-known Julius Caesar<br>
  And if she'll have me I'll try to please her."</p><br>

  <p>"That's wonderful," said The Miller, as he folded the paper. "All you want
  is something like:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"If your mind is at sixes and sevens,<br>
  Go to Educated Evans,<br>
  Merchant of street corner rumours,<br>
  Send five bob and get his stumers."</p><br>

  <p>"Who wrote that?" asked Evans suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Kipling," replied The Miller.</p>

  <p>Now Evans had only stated a vital fact in the mildest possible way when he
  said that Miss Hortense Curryfed was no lover of racing. She had been ruined
  by the turf. Her male parent had done in two egg and bacon shops by his rash
  and hazardous speculations in this department of human activity. Her first
  young man had put the money reserved for the purchase of a home upon St.
  Becan in the Derby, thereby paralysing all prospects of domestic happiness.
  Her second young man had been driven to financial embarrassment when Pons
  Asinorum failed to get his nose in front at the stick.</p>

  <p>To add to her horror and detestation of the betting habits of mankind, she
  lived in the same house (and in the service) of a high-class Oxford Street
  bookmaker.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans had met her in favourable circumstances at a very high-class
  play in the Euston Road. He went to the Regent under the mistaken impression
  that "The Immortal Hour" was a new Chaplin film, and after he had survived
  the risk of being thrown out for laughing, he found himself in conversation
  with a sharp but not unpleasant-featured female who confided to him that she
  had seen the play twenty-five times. Luckily, he learnt of her antipathy to
  racing before he began to talk about himself&mdash;which means that she
  started telling him pretty soon after they were acquainted.</p>

  <p>Miss Hortense was a governess (she also had taken out a poetic licence)
  and looked after the manners and morals of two violent children whom she
  described as "handfuls." She had, she hinted, a bit of money put aside for a
  rainy day. Her grandmamma had left her a small annuity and she was the owner
  of two houses in Peckham. Obviously a lady. She liked men older than
  herself&mdash;bits of boys she couldn't stand. They got on her nerves.
  Obviously a sensible lady.</p>

  <p>"I'm in business for meself," Evans told her, and, when he referred to his
  clients, she was not sure whether he was a lawyer or a shingle specialist.
  She was too well brought up to inquire. She liked strong, silent men, she
  told him. Evans could be strong but he could not be silent.</p>

  <p>At nights (three a week) they walked or took a cup of coffee together at
  the Corner House in the West End, or saw an improving picture. Evans saw all
  the improving pictures in London. All about Women's Souls and Fate and
  Railway Accidents and Little Children who said:</p>

  <p>"Mama, you are not running away with that wicked man! Remember you owe a
  duty to your unfortunate progeny."</p>

  <p>Mostly the plays were about heroic women who sacrificed their principles
  for the sake of the men they loved. This was Miss Curryfed's favourite
  theme.</p>

  <p>So the courtship progressed and reached, as we have seen, the stage where
  poetry commenced.</p>

  <p>And then the blow fell.</p>

  <p>One night, Mr. Evans, returning from Lingfield somewhat short of temper
  and money, and with the knowledge that he had sent out to all clients old and
  new, them that had acted honourable and them that hadn't acted honourable,
  "Binge&mdash;fear nothing" (the same Binge having refused at the first fence
  like a sensible horse), ran into Miss Curryfed. His race glasses were slung
  over his shoulder as he strode across the broad meeting-ground of Victoria
  Station&mdash;there was no excuse.</p>

  <p>Miss Curryfed confronted him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Evans&mdash;you are a common racing-man!"</p>

  <p>"I just popped down&mdash;" began Evans.</p>

  <p>"You've been horse-racing and betting&mdash;never speak to me again!"</p>

  <p>Evans was not in his tenderest mood.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said haughtily, lifted his hat and strode on.</p>

  <p>Now that his true character was revealed, Miss Curryfed had no difficulty
  in establishing the identity of the deceiver. Even her employer had heard his
  name, and spoke slightingly of him.</p>

  <p>It needed but this to revivify the dormant romanticism in Miss Curryfed's
  bosom. Was she right, she asked herself. Was she doing her duty, she
  demanded? The memory of parallel cases oppressed her. She thought of the
  screen women married to rich husbands who had endured All for the sake of the
  child, or had endured All for the sake of their mothers. She thought of the
  pure young girls who had sacrificed their lives and futures, had given up All
  that they held Dear, and had married fat and bloated millionaires so that
  their sick sister should be attended by the great specialist whom they really
  loved. In her mind's eye she saw the young and beautiful girl, who, though
  she was loved by the rich, handsome and chivalrous leading man, stood by her
  poor and crotchety husband (quite a minor character) and endured All until he
  was providentially run over by a tram-car, when she married the rich and
  chivalrous suitor, and faded out on a long and lingering kiss.</p>

  <p>Her mind was made up. The path of Duty was clear. That night for the first
  time she listened to the idle chatter of racing-men who gathered about her
  employer's table. She heard and shivered as they talked with coarse
  familiarity of strange animals to which they gave no name, referring rather
  to "that thing of Leader's" or "that so-and-so thing of Bennett's," but from
  the confusion of narrative emerged one golden thread. She recognised its
  importance by the low tones in which the information passed across the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Poor Pup&mdash;keep it to yourself," said the informant, and her employer
  nodded. "And whatever you do, Joe, don't be a loser on it. They'll back it
  away, and you'll get your wires half an hour after the off."</p>

  <p>Poor Pup! She bit her lip to suppress her emotion, and, going up to her
  room, she put on a dark coat and a shapeless hat and made her stealthy way
  from the house.</p>

  <p>It was very dark; rain was falling in torrents, but she walked rapidly on.
  Could this be she? Miss Curryfed wondered bitterly, going forth in the night
  to this racing-man, to tell him of a horse that would win. But it was her
  duty.</p>

  <p>She raised her chin proudly, drove back the tears, and reached Bayham Mews
  without any of the misadventures which usually overtake heroines when they
  are about to do something silly.</p>

  <p>Presently she found Masked Marvel Mansions and, climbing the slippery
  wooden stairs, listened at the door. No sound came from within except an
  irregular groan that sounded like a vacuum cleaner that was working in fits
  and starts. Evans was sleeping. She knocked at the door gently, and, when no
  answer came, knocked louder.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" said Evans, struggling up. "Who's there?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Evans?" said a voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's me," said Evans.</p>

  <p>"Poor Pup!" she said hollowly.</p>

  <p>"Who is?" asked the indignant Evans. "Poor Pup," she said again, and he
  recognised the voice.</p>

  <p>"D'you call yourself a lady," he demanded wrathfully, "comin' here in the
  middle of the night an' callin' me names? Where's your education? Where's
  your dickyorum?"</p>

  <p>"Poor Pup," she said again&mdash;"I do this for your sake."</p>

  <p>He heard the sound of her feet on the stairs, and when he opened the door
  she was gone.</p>

  <p>Two days later Mr. Evans opened his newspaper and read:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align: center">Poor Pup - 1<br>
  Jellybag - 2<br>
  Oh You! - 3<br>
  100-9. 5-2. 6-1.</p><br>

  <p>He clasped his forehead in despair, and there flashed upon him an
  understanding of that midnight scene.</p>

  <p>All that day he paced in vain the pavement of Manchester Square, but she
  made no appearance. He remembered now that she was working for a bookmaker,
  and a happy sense of content and complacency came to him as he construed her
  action.</p>

  <p>Two or three days later he was just dozing off to sleep when a tap came at
  his door.</p>

  <p>"Joojah!" hissed a voice.</p>

  <p>"Here, wait a minute, Miss Curryfed."</p>

  <p>"Joojah&mdash;farewell."</p>

  <p>She was gone when he walked out on to the rain-splattered landing. But
  this time he made no mistake. To all clients, ancient and modern, went forth
  the joyous news: "Joojah&mdash;Fear Nothing"; and Joojah accordingly
  obliged&mdash;at a modest price, it is true, but, as Evans said: "I can't
  help prices."</p>

  <p>Night after night he waited on a chair behind the door for the coming of
  his mysterious informant. A week passed, but he neither saw nor heard
  her.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Whilst it cannot be said that Mrs. Lube was without her own
  especial dreams, the type indeed that is very popular in certain cinema
  palaces where they are not so very particular, she had all a righteous wife's
  indignation at a philandering husband. Prosperity had come to her from an
  unexpected legacy, and Mr. Alf Lube had shared in that prosperity to the
  extent that he was able to go farther afield into bars where he was quite
  unknown, and where there was no necessity to wait patiently for a friend to
  enter and ask brightly, "What's yours, Alf?"</p>

  <p>And in the course of his wandering Mr. Lube, who was of an inflammable
  nature, had met with one who embodied in her gracious person all the
  attractions of a siren, all the supple grace of a mermaid.</p>

  <p>Every afternoon and every evening Mr. Lube lounged into the bar of the
  "Dog and Kettle," and fixed his languid eyes upon the beautiful manipulator
  of beer handles and deft turner-up of bottles. And they had private
  conversations not unconnected, on Mr. Lube's part, with the money that had
  come into his family. It is true that he gave the impression that he was the
  sole legatee, and he also hinted in his subtle way that he was unhappily
  married to a woman who did not understand him.</p>

  <p>Miss Flossie, the barmaid, who was well acquainted with this type of
  husband, listened sympathetically; and when, one day, Alf laid a golden
  bangle on the counter, she took it with downcast eyes, which not only
  established in his mind the illusion of modesty, but enabled her to see that
  it was only nine carat. And from there on the friendship grew apace.</p>

  <p>"I'm in the sporting line of business," said Alf. "I suppose you've heard
  of me?"</p>

  <p>"You're not Educated Evans!" said Hebe, with interest.</p>

  <p>"Him!" said Mr. Lube contemptuously. "I could lose him! No, I own Old
  Sam's Midnight Special."</p>

  <p>"Go on!" she said.</p>

  <p>He went on.</p>

  <p>How far on he would have gone will never be known. Mrs. Lube had her
  suspicions aroused from the amazing fact that her husband had innovated a new
  domestic practice: he washed twice a day. That, and the purchase of clean
  collars and the discovery in his pocket of a tram-ticket, brought her like a
  bloodhound on his trail.</p>

  <p>Miss Curryfed met the squat and stoutish lady on her way to Bayham Mews,
  and Mrs. Lube was not only very angry, but confided the cause of her wrath to
  the first acquaintance.</p>

  <p>"Thank your lucky stars you're not married, young woman!" she said
  tremulously.</p>

  <p>Miss Curryfed had never thanked her stars for anything so stupid.</p>

  <p>"Me allowin' him money, with four mouths to feed, an' him carryin' on with
  a ginger-haired barmaid, an' I on'y heard about it to-night! I barmaided
  her!"</p>

  <p>"You should forgive your husband," said Miss Curryfed gently. "Marriage
  calls for great sacrifice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Two bob a day beer money&mdash;what's that?" snapped Mrs. Lube, who was
  returning from one of those occasional pilgrimages which the erratic
  affections of her husband made necessary.</p>

  <p>"If you love him," murmured Miss Curryfed... "To know all is to forgive
  all."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure that I do know all," said Mrs. Lube darkly.</p>

  <p>"Now I," said Miss Curryfed, "am doing something I hate for the man of my
  choice."</p>

  <p>And encouraged by the confidence that had been given to her, she told the
  story of those midnight visits.</p>

  <p>"I shall never speak to him again, of course," said Miss Curryfed sadly,
  "but I must help him in his struggle."</p>

  <p>"Is it Evans?" asked Mrs. Lube, all her wrath against her worser half
  disappearing.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is Evans&mdash;Hubert Evans," said the girl softly, and wiped her
  glasses.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube almost stopped breathing.</p>

  <p>"Don't take the risk, miss," she said earnestly. "You've no idea of the
  people that live down that mews. I quite sympathise an' understand, bein' one
  woman to another. I'll tell you what I'll do, young lady. I'll tell him! I
  don't mind dogs, an' I'm older than you.... You'll find me waitin' at the end
  of the mews every night at ten o'clock&mdash;either me or my husband. All you
  got to do is to tell him the horse...."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Week after week Evans listened in vain for the light
  footstep on the stairs. Week after week he bemoaned the surprising and
  startling success of Old Sam's Midnight Special, which was sending out three-
  star winners with disgusting frequency.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story16"
     name="story16"></a>XVI. &mdash; THE PARTICULAR BEAUTY</h2>

  <p class="first">EDUCATED EVANS had many promising clients. They promised him
  odds to various sums, and a proportion of them kept their word and a
  proportion partly fulfilled their obligations and a large proportion deeply
  regretted that his information had come too late to be of any use to them,
  and finished up their letters of excuse with the pious hope that he would
  have "better luck next time."</p>

  <p>"They're not actin' honourable," said Mr. Evans bitterly. "Here am I,
  goin' around happy as a king an' thinkin' of all the stuff that's comin', and
  here are they playin' robbers and thieves. They're worse than Amlet, the
  celebrated Danish gentleman&mdash;they say 'My kingdom for your guarantee
  special', an' when it clicks an' I ask for my dues they say 'Out dam spot!'
  Is that fair?"</p>

  <p>"It certainly is the limit," said The Miller. "Have you ever thought of
  suing them?"</p>

  <p>"What's the good?" asked Evans. "I know as much about the lore as the next
  man&mdash;but what's the good? Take Marky Wirral. You couldn't get him to pay
  if you took Scotland Yard with you."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you cut him off?"</p>

  <p>"I do," said Evans gloomily, "and round he comes an' pitches a tale about
  his old mother&mdash;I 'm too soft-hearted."</p>

  <p>"And headed," suggested The Miller.</p>

  <p>There is honour amongst thieves&mdash;it is when you get down to the
  punting class that you touch the deeps of human depravity and artfulness.</p>

  <p>"I'm weedin' 'em out," said Evans. "I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't
  chuck this low connection an' open up in a classy neighbourhood&mdash;Edgware
  Road or somewhere."</p>

  <p>He tried employing a client who used to be in the fighting business, till
  his backers went broke. Tom got a bit out of every dollar he collected. The
  first night he came back with a shilling he'd got from Nosey Walker and a
  string of hard-luck tales that choked him as he related them. The second
  evening he came back with nothing more substantial than a skinful of beer,
  and he spent the night sitting on the bottom of the steps singing doleful
  songs about women. The next night he didn't come back at all.</p>

  <p>Evans gave up all hope of collection. He had other matters of routine to
  bother him. And then Lew Emmings, the well-known fighting man, a fervent
  admirer and defender of Evans, came to him with a suggestion, offered in all
  deference and humility, but Evans shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm very sorry, Lew. I'd like to oblige you, but I don't have no more
  women about this place. They're snakes in the grass, as hist'ry tells us.
  Take Mary Queen of Scotch&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Rebecca's Jewish," pleaded Lew.</p>

  <p>"Well, take the well-known Queen of Sheba&mdash;her that done in the
  far-famed Solomon by gettin' him to go out and fight the Hi-tites while she
  was goin' round with another man."</p>

  <p>"Rebecca's a respectable girl," urged Lew.</p>

  <p>"So was Cleopatra, whose needle we all admire," said Evans rapidly. "So
  was Lewdcreature Burgia&mdash;up to a point. So was Bonny Mary, the
  well-known Duchess of Argyll. So was the celebrated an' highly respected
  Queen Elizabeth, commonly called the Verger Queen. No, Lew, I like an'
  respect you, but I can't give no jobs to no girl. Besides, I've got to think
  of your sister's reputation, workin' alone with me."</p>

  <p>Lew argued in vain. But the deposed and dishonest secretary was not to be
  replaced.</p>

  <p>And yet there was need of clerical assistance. He had recently renewed his
  association with the Midland Goods Yard, and there were forty £10 Specials to
  be struck off every morning between ten and twelve, after the runners came
  up.</p>

  <p>Then again, he found his accounts were in bad order. He had written asking
  clients to act honourable who had acted honourable, and said so violently and
  offensively; and he had sent out his special messages to people who were on
  the back of his book&mdash;or would have been if he'd had a book.</p>

  <p>"It's system an' order I want," he confided to The Miller. "I'm goin' to
  keep a file so they can't chisel me."</p>

  <p>The Miller looked at him suspiciously, but the jest was an unconscious
  one.</p>

  <p>"But wimmin!" Evans shook his head "I've been both stung an' bit, an' I'm
  rapidly turning into a mysograph&mdash;I am indeed, Mr. Challoner."</p>

  <p>"That sounds like a writing machine to me," said the puzzled Miller. "You
  don't by any chance mean mysogynist?"</p>

  <p>"Mysogynist or mysograph," said Evans carelessly. "One's Greek an' the
  other's Latin. Lew wants me to take his sister&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why don't you?" said The Miller. "Little Rebecca is very pretty, very
  capable and very straight. If you take my advice, you'll give her fifty
  shillings a week and a commission on all the money she collects."</p>

  <p>Evans thought the matter over and sent for Lew, and that faithful man came
  breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"She's a good clurk an' a good collector, Mr. Evans," he said.</p>

  <p>"She oughter be able to get a job anywhere, oughtn't she?" asked Evans
  suspiciously.</p>

  <p>Lew hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell you the truth about Rebecca, Mr. Evans. She ought to get
  a job an' she could get a job, but she's very touchy about the way people
  look at her. She's so beautiful, Mr. Evans," he said earnestly, "that she
  can't allow nobody to get fresh with her, or cast aspersions on her. I've had
  more fights over Rebecca than I can remember. If a feller looks at her like
  this"&mdash;he leered&mdash;"home she comes to me and says 'Lew, I've been
  insulted,' an' out I go an' bash the bloke. A feller tried to hold her hand
  once in the City, an' she had hysterics for three hours an' twenty-seven
  minutes&mdash;by the clock. But you're a gentleman, Mr. Evans, an' as long as
  you're stern with her she won't mind that."</p>

  <p>With some misgivings Mr. Evans awaited the arrival of the Particular
  Beauty.</p>

  <p>She was all that The Miller had said and more, having one of those svelte
  figures that one associates with the bathing girls who appear on the covers
  of the summer magazines. She had fair hair and deep blue eyes, regular
  features and a complexion like milk and roses. Evans knew that it was going
  to be very difficult to be stern with her.</p>

  <p>"Well, Miss&mdash;"he began.</p>

  <p>"Call me Rebecca," she said with a dazzling smile.</p>

  <p>Evans glanced at her brother to bear him witness that he had this
  permission.</p>

  <p>She was immensely capable, too. Under her nimble fingers Mr. Order took a
  long farewell of Mrs. Chaos.</p>

  <p>"She's a good girl," said Lew, as they walked down the High Street
  together, "an' I'd kill me best friend if he got fresh with her. I'd take him
  by the throat an' bash his head against the wall."</p>

  <p>Evans avoided her all day, and when he did come into the office a set
  scowl was on his countenance and he kept at a respectful distance, lest by
  some mischance he touched that twinkling hand.</p>

  <p>The next morning, armed with a list containing the names and addresses of
  defaulters and the amounts owing, she set forth. At three in the afternoon
  came Lew, with a respectable pile of money, which he put on the table.</p>

  <p>"Rebecca can't come back to-day," he said gloomily. "She went to Harry
  Watson to collect the thirty bob he owes you, an' Harry looked at her funny.
  They've just took him to the hospital," he added.</p>

  <p>On the next day Toby Lowe, a hired porter, met the request of Mr. Evans'
  new collector for immediate payment with a light-hearted suggestion that he'd
  pay twice over if she'd come and have a cup of tea with him. Ambulance bells
  rang loudly along Great College Street.</p>

  <p>On the third day she came home in triumph with a bundle of Treasury notes,
  in various stages of cleanliness, and laid them before the frowning
  Evans.</p>

  <p>"Only one man insulted me," she said brightly, "but Lew can't find him, I
  think he must have gone abroad."</p>

  <p>Evans counted the money with a glow of joy. "You're one of the nicest
  little women I've ever&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then he remembered with a chill and looked up. A look of cold doubt was in
  her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm talking alejorically or pari-doxically," said Evans hastily. "Being
  educated, Miss Rebecca, you understand, I have to use all sorts of
  metaphorics an' poetry."</p>

  <p>He composed his features to a scowl.</p>

  <p>"I respect you as a lady an' as a woman of business," he went on rapidly.
  "You're a sort of machine, like a motor-bicycle or a beer engine. Her face
  cleared; the deadly suspicion passed from her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you told me that, Mr. Evans," she said seriously. "I shouldn't
  like to think you were Gay."</p>

  <p>"Gay? Me?" Evans' face was contorted with stupefied wonder. "Why, Miss
  Rebecca, I'm no more gay than the Reverend Hinge&mdash;him that put the
  cracks in St. Paul's."</p>

  <p>"I loathe people falling in love with me," said Rebecca.</p>

  <p>"At the same time," said Evans, his natural gallantry overcoming his fear,
  "it's not to be wondered at...."</p>

  <p>And then, as the look of distrust reappeared: "It's not to be wondered at
  that you do, Miss Rebecca. Personally speakin', I hate people to fall in love
  with me. The wimmin that's tried to hold my hand! The girls that chase me
  around!"</p>

  <p>She was interested, possibly sceptical. She had every right to be.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know you were so fascinatin', Mr. Evans."</p>

  <p>"In a way I am," admitted Evans modestly. "I suppose it's the education.
  But love don't mean any more to me than it meant to the celebrated and highly
  renowned Lewdcreature Burgia, the female Crippen of Rome, that done in her
  father with arsenic an' got pinched just as she was drawin' the insurance
  money. What a lady! Take B&mdash; Mary..."</p>

  <p>"What's 'B' mean?" She was alert for insults.</p>

  <p>"Bolshevik," said Evans quickly. "There's a woman that never had no love
  for anybody. She had her head cut off an' never smiled again &mdash;see
  Hist'ry. Take Cleopatra, whose needle we all admire: she was stung to death
  by apses &mdash;a kind of needle that the Egyptians sewed their mummies up
  with. She found Moses in the bulrushes, and everybody used to say he had her
  nose! Which only goes to prove that the voice of scandal is the voice of the
  people&mdash;or in other words, <i>pro bono publico</i>&mdash;French."</p>

  <p>He made his escape, feeling very moist under the collar. For the next two
  days he avoided his clurk and collector, insisting that her brother should
  accompany him whenever urgent necessity took him to his office.</p>

  <p>To make doubly sure, he engaged old Mrs. Tomwit, whose son was doing
  seven, and had eighteen months to go to qualify for her old age pension, to
  come and sit in the office during Rebecca's working hours.</p>

  <p>"She's all right," he admitted reluctantly to The Miller, "but she gets
  insulted. I wanted to send out Darling Mine for the three o'clock at Plumpton
  to-day, but I simply daren't say the words. But I got something for you on
  Friday&mdash;St. Cheese. He'll start at 10-1 an' he's money for nothin' I'm
  sendin' this horse out to all clients&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Old and new," murmured The Miller.</p>

  <p>"To all clients," said Evans, "as my £10 Special. The Lubeses are sendin'
  out Ratrun, as I happen to know owin' to havin' a friend in the printing
  business. Ratrun don't."</p>

  <p>"Don't what?" asked The Miller.</p>

  <p>"Run," said Evans.</p>

  <p>The days that followed were too busy for Mr. Evans to absent himself from
  the office. Lew came with him, and with the aged lady the room was rather
  crowded. Lew took his turn with the duplicator, and Rebecca worked like three
  women, too absorbed in her labours even to detect the least disrespectful
  glance.</p>

  <p>Now the Lubes were also busy, for an unexpected piece of luck had come the
  way of the owners, proprietors and editors of Old Sam's Midnight Special.
  Mrs. Lube, to her fluttering joy, had become acquainted with a real
  jockey.</p>

  <p>To tell the story of how this acquaintance was made is like examining the
  ancestry of the modern holder of an ancient peerage. Mrs. Lube's cousin,
  Arthur Stickleburn, the schoolmaster, coached in his spare time a staff-
  sergeant of the Army Service Corps who was working for his first-class
  certificate. This sergeant had a brother who was engaged to the sister of the
  young lady whom George Grob was walking out with. Now do you see?</p>

  <p>To scrape acquaintance with George Grob was a fairly easy matter. He was a
  little man with a bullet head and a roving eye, who chewed gum, wrote his
  name with difficulty, and patronised a Sackville Street tailor. He was
  introduced to Mr. Stickleburn, who, having shared something of his cousin's
  prosperity, found an opportunity to pass on his capture to Mrs. Lube; and
  there was a great luncheon at an Oxford Street restaurant, which cost no less
  than £4 7s. 6d. including wine, at which Mrs. Lube met the great horseman
  (Old Sam and her husband were kept in the background); and the friendship was
  sealed when Mr. Grob informed his hostess that Ratrun was something to bet
  on.</p>

  <p>"But the papers say it won't start," said Mrs. Lube.</p>

  <p>Mr. Grob smiled a cryptic smile.</p>

  <p>"If you believe everything you read in the papers," he said, in his most
  original manner, "you'll go off your chump! He runs and he'll win, and if any
  of your friends like to put me on a pony, I'll let 'em&mdash;that's a nice
  bit of fluff over there."</p>

  <p>The bit of fluff, who was really a bit of fluff, gave him smile for smile,
  and thereafter Mr. Grob's interest in racing and tippery evaporated.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Them Lubeses," said Evans, "has gone off their nuts.
  They're sendin' out Ratrun, an' I happen to know from the boy who does him
  that he's bein' kept for Cheltenham. It's gaswork&mdash;absolutely
  gaswork."</p>

  <p>"If Ratrun is in the field," said The Miller, "your St. Cheese will be
  beaten two fences."</p>

  <p>"Fear Nothing," murmured Evans, and went on licking stamps.</p>

  <p>The rivalry between the Evanses and the Lubeses was so keen and so widely
  canvassed in Camden Town that the knowledge that they were sending, with
  equal confidence, two horses for the same race, added a certain piquancy to
  the event. Once more Camden Town divided itself into the rival camps, and
  when the selections were known, the balance of opinion favoured the sanity of
  Old Sam's advisers.</p>

  <p>Because Ratrun was a perfect fencer; it would be ridden by a crack jockey;
  and though the possibility was that 5-4 would be an outside offer, yet 5-4 in
  the hand is worth 1000-1 down the course. And it was also known, through some
  mysterious agency, that St. Cheese was not on the job. How these stories came
  into circulation has never been discovered, but it is generally believed that
  the big bookmakers in London employ a corps of fairy- tale-tellers to
  disseminate profitable news.</p>

  <p>"He's on the job an' he's tryin'," said Evans when the story came to him.
  "I not only had it from the boy who does him, but I've had it from the barber
  who shaves the owner's uncle. An' if that's not good enough, what is?"</p>

  <p>"I think I'll come along and see this animal perform," said The Miller,
  and Educated Evans showed every sign of relief.</p>

  <p>"She's comin' down too"&mdash;he jerked his head towards Bayham
  Mews.&mdash;"She's never seen a race."</p>

  <p>"You're not taking her, are you?" asked The Miller quickly.</p>

  <p>"Not me I" said the fervent Evans. "Am I mad? Why, if I bought her an
  evenin' paper she'd scream for help. I never even take me hat off to her when
  I meet her in the street."</p>

  <p>On a bright, wintry day Lingfield has its claims to loveliness, and Mr.
  Evans walked from the rattler with a light step and a light heart, confident
  that the sun would go down upon a great achievement and the roll of honour
  which included Braxted, what a beauty, and Eton Boy, Marked Marble (the
  danger) would be still further enriched.</p>

  <p>The Miller had come down on his motor-bike. He came across the paddock to
  meet Mr. Evans. "Ratrun does," he said.</p>

  <p>"What?" asked Evans, startled.</p>

  <p>"Run," said The Miller laconically.</p>

  <p>Evans frowned, opened his evening paper and scowled at the list of
  probables.</p>

  <p>"It's not down here," he said.</p>

  <p>"It's down here," said The Miller, pointing to the stables.</p>

  <p>"You can't believe half these newspaper writers tell you," said Evans
  bitterly. "Half what they say's gaswork an' the other half ain't sense.
  They're like the well-known Volytare, the celebrated French officer, who
  wouldn't get out of bed till somebody told him how he got in it!"</p>

  <p>In the depths of despair, he went in search of his party. The delighted
  Rebecca was standing by the ringside, watching the horses parade, and Lew was
  explaining to her the significance of the numbers on the boys' arms.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it wonderful, Mr. Evans?" she said her eyes afire with excitement.
  "I've never been on a race-course in my life! And nobody looks at
  you&mdash;that's the wonderful thing. I could live here all my life. I heard
  somebody say just now 'Look at her beautiful legs,' and of course I got
  awfully upset, but they were talking about a horse&mdash;weren't they,
  Lew?"</p>

  <p>"So he said," said Lew darkly. "If I thought he'd been talkin' about
  yours, Rebecca&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure he wasn't: he was a gentleman&mdash;he had an umbrella," she
  said.</p>

  <p>Evans could take no part in their joy. His soul was harrowed with the
  knowledge that he had expended 6oo pence, to say nothing of £1, 4s. in wires
  for extra special clients, in despatching to the world the glad tidings
  concerning St. Cheese. Undoubtedly Ratrun was on the job. He went and stared
  at him as he walked proudly round the paddock before the race. Compared with
  Ratrun, St. Cheese looked&mdash;well, just like St. Cheese.</p>

  <p>The jockeys were coming out. Mr. Grob, the last to appear, strolled across
  the paddock, swinging his whip nonchalantly; and it so happened that Rebecca
  stood not only in his way but in his line of vision. He looked at her and
  winked! And, what's more, Lew saw him do it! In a second he had gripped the
  jockey's collar.</p>

  <p>"Here, what d'you mean by insulting my sister?" he demanded hotly.</p>

  <p>"He winked at me!" gasped Rebecca.</p>

  <p>"Didn't I see him do it?" asked Lew wrathfully.</p>

  <p>"Let go of me," said Mr. Grob, "or I'll give you a punch on the
  nose...."</p>

  <p>The Miller was the first upon the spot, and his strong arms separated the
  contestants; not, however, before Mr. Grob's eye was slightly swollen and his
  nose ensanguined.</p>

  <p>"I'll murder you when I come back!" he hissed, as he dodged under the
  rail....</p>

  <p>A jockey with a black eye, a sore nose and a malignant desire for murder
  in his heart, is no fit pilot for a high-spirited thoroughbred. At the third
  fence from the back stretch Mr. Grob drove his mount savagely at a jump, took
  off too soon... and the race was over. St. Cheese, plugging away through the
  mud, held the lead he established when he came into the straight, out-jumped
  his opponent at the last fence, and scrambled home by a neck.</p>

  <p>"They've sent the ambulance out for the jock," said Evans
  complacently.</p>

  <p>Lew glowered.</p>

  <p>"It'd have saved 'em a lot of trouble if he'd a-come back," he said. "They
  wouldn't have had so far to carry him!"</p>

  <h2><a id="story17"
     name="story17"></a>XVII. &mdash; THE LAST COOP OF ALL</h2>

  <p class="first">"HE's a rum-looking devil," said Lord Fanerly.</p>

  <p>"He can go a bit, my lord," said the trainer.</p>

  <p>The two-year-old under review was a leggy chestnut who had a poor neck,
  drooping quarters and bad hocks amongst other defects.</p>

  <p>"He's the rummiest-looking devil I've ever seen&mdash;how is he bred,
  again?"</p>

  <p>"By Short Cut out of Brief Survey, my lord." His lordship beamed round on
  his three pretty daughters.</p>

  <p>"I'll give any of you a fiver who finds me a name for this atrocity!" he
  chuckled. "All right, Mr. Atkins; we'll let him run for the stakes."</p>

  <p>Which was his lordship's favourite joke, for though he owned a stable of
  good horses, he only had one bet a year, and that was on the King's horse in
  the Derby.</p>

  <p>And this is where the story of Mr. Evans' last and greatest coop begins.
  Perhaps it began in the latter part of last year, when he earned the hatred
  and loathing of Mr. Goolby. Mr. Goolby was a well-off man who owned a chain
  of public-houses and a string of comparatively bad horses.</p>

  <p>But by some accident a good one came his way, and having fiddled with it
  for three months, running it down the course and out of its distance, he
  decided to have a go, and to this end he opened up new accounts all over the
  country. By ill-chance, Mr. Evans either heard or pricked with a pin the name
  of this gem, and sent it, amongst others, to one Issyheim, a shrewd
  bookmaker. Ordinarily, the fact that Evans sent out a horse made no more
  difference to its price than the printing of its name in the programme, but
  by a second mischance one of the wires despatched by Mr. Goolby and backing
  his horse each way, arrived at Issyheim's office in time for him to put
  through an inquiry to further bookmakers. They, too, had had wires&mdash;the
  'phone to the course was set to work, and Goolby's horse started at 13-8.</p>

  <p>Very unjustly, he blamed Evans, and after he had recovered from his six
  fits he set down to work his vengeance. He had in his stables a two-year-old
  by Newsboy out of Railway Tunnel. It was by far the worst two-year- old he
  had ever owned, but when his trainer suggested he should get rid of it, he
  shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've got a use for him," he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Goolby, as it happened, lived on the aristocratic fringe of Camden
  Town, so that Evans was something more than a vague personality. For three
  months this cunning man stalked his prey....</p>

  <p>It was the habit of Detective-Inspector Arbuthnot Challoner to make a
  tri-weekly call upon the educated man. He made no excuse for his peculiar
  conduct, for "The Miller" was rather superior to public opinion.</p>

  <p>"Goolby," he said, suspiciously, when Evans told him the good news. "Isn't
  he the fellow who said he'd murder you?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans smiled.</p>

  <p>"We all make our mistakes, Mr. Challoner," he said. "Take the well-known
  Napoleon Bonyparte, him that was drowned at the Battle of Trafalgar. Didn't
  he put his telescope to the wrong eye? Take the far-famed Mary Queen of
  Scotch; didn't she walk over Sir Francis Drake's cloak that he put down in
  the mud, an' didn't he stick a knife in her when she was saying her prayers
  in the highly-celebrated Tower of London? Take Lewdcreature
  Burgia&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm tired of taking that woman," said The Miller. "But what does Goolby
  want?"</p>

  <p>"To do me a turn," replied Evans promptly. "He's got no children, being a
  bachelor; he's got millions of money. He took a fancy to me the minute we
  met."</p>

  <p>"In the dark, I presume," said The Miller unpleasantly. "Take my tip,
  Evans&mdash;that man is going to do you dirt."</p>

  <p>Evans smiled again.</p>

  <p>That evening he went to dinner with Mr. Goolby, and the magnificence of
  Mr. Goolby's dining-room took his breath away. Never had Evans seen so much
  gold on so much purple wallpaper.</p>

  <p>"The point is, Evans," said Mr. Goolby, over roast duck with green peas
  and sage stuffing, which latter was to cause Mr. Evans a certain amount of
  discomfiture and interrupt the smooth flow of his conversation, "the point
  is, I took a liking to you the first time I saw you."</p>

  <p>"It is funny," said Mr. Evans. "The first time I see you, Mr. Goolby, I
  ses to myself: 'There's an educated man.' You remind me of the far-famed
  Volta, the well-known French cricket&mdash;excuse me!&mdash;'im that got
  Looey IX. and the far-famed Mary Auntynette executed in the well-known B.
  Tower. You remind me&mdash;excuse me!&mdash;of the far-famed Rishloo, who is
  well known to all the local inhabitants of France for his piousness and
  education."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to make your fortune, Evans," said Mr. Goolby, as he poured out
  some of Gilbey's celebrated invalid port, "and I can do it if you'll keep
  your mouth shut."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans smiled.</p>

  <p>"I've got the shuttest mouth in Camden Town, as all will admit," he said.
  "I've got stable secrets in me desk&mdash;excuse me&mdash;never could eat
  onions&mdash;that even the Jockey Club don't know anything about."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if I <i>can</i> trust you," asked Mr. Goolby, surveying him
  gloomily.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans smiled again.</p>

  <p>"I'm like the far-famed Michael Velli, the well-known Italian poet. What
  goes in me ears never comes out of me mouth&mdash;excuse me!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Goolby went on to explain that he had in his stable a colt by Newsboy
  out of Railway Tunnel, and that this two-year-old could catch pigeons. He had
  tried this horse well enough to win any reasonable Derby, but unfortunately
  two-year-olds were not allowed to run for the Derby.</p>

  <p>"If you send this out to your clients you are a mug. If I were in your
  place," said Mr. Goolby solemnly, "I should get together every penny I had in
  the world; I should sell my furniture, I should borrow money from my friends,
  I'd even use any money I had that didn't belong to me. Now, I'm telling you
  this as man to man, because I want to do you a turn."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," murmured Mr. Evans.</p>

  <p>"He's running at Sandown in a maiden race&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are you backing him yourself?" asked Evans, anxiously.</p>

  <p>Mr. Goolby shook his head:</p>

  <p>"No, I've given up betting; I've taken a vow&mdash;or an oath, as the case
  may be&mdash;never to bet again. If I was betting, Evans, should I give you
  this information."</p>

  <p>"I'd better write down the name," said Evans, producing a pencil and
  paper. "Railway Tunnel colt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" corrected the other. "I'm calling him 'Press Cutting': in fact I
  am writing to-day to Wetherby's to name him. Come up and see me to-morrow,
  and I'll give you the latest about him. You ought to make enough money to
  sink a ship, and if you don't, then all I can say to you, if you don't mind
  my being offensive, is that you are a mug."</p>

  <p>Evans walked back to Call Boy Castle on air. Who knew the secret his bosom
  held?</p>

  <p>He would have passed Inspector Arbuthnot Challoner without noticing him,
  but The Miller called him back.</p>

  <p>"You been drinking?" he asked suspiciously. "Or are you in possession of
  stolen property?"</p>

  <p>"That's a game I never take on, Mr. Challoner," said Evans,
  good-humouredly. "No, I'm just going back to the Castle to have a bit of tea
  and a sluice. I got some work to do." He smiled mysteriously, and then, as a
  thought struck him:</p>

  <p>"Suppose I was to ask you to lend me a tenner, Mr. Challoner?"</p>

  <p>"I should pinch you, right away," said Mr. Challoner promptly. "But
  seriously, Evans, you don't want to borrow £10?"</p>

  <p>Evans nodded.</p>

  <p>"I got something I want to back," he said, mysteriously. "Something that I
  can't tell nobody about. Something that I can't even send to me £5
  clients."</p>

  <p>The Miller became suddenly interested.</p>

  <p>"You're putting your own money on it and you are not sending it out?" he
  asked incredulously. "You're mad."</p>

  <p>Evans was turning away with a shrug when The Miller called him back.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you a tenner; in fact I'll send you two tenners, and you can
  put one of them on for me. I can see my life's savings going, but this is
  June, when even inspectors of police are entitled to go a little light-
  headed."</p>

  <p>He was as good as his word. That very evening, he brought four crisp
  five-pound notes.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans put them into his pocket with an air of nonchalance which did
  not exactly tally with the state of his mind. For he had been very busy all
  that evening, and had been amazingly successful. Eighty- seven pounds of his
  own ill-gotten gains had been supplemented by no less a sum than £20 of
  borrowed money. To this must be added a sum of £30 that he had
  wangled&mdash;there is no other word for it&mdash;from the landlord of the
  White Hart, with whom he had been restored to friendship, and the prospect of
  what would happen when Press Cutting lost boggled his imagination.</p>

  <p>He would dearly have loved to refuse The Miller's loan and investment. For
  if there was one person in the world on whom he did not wish to commit a
  petty larceny, it was an inspector of the C.I.D.</p>

  <p>The next day added to his commitments by one of those extraordinary
  strokes of fate which may be recorded but cannot be explained. Mr. Highbrite,
  the well-known wholesale confectioner and sherbet manufacturer of Camden
  Town, came to Evans and asked him if he would purchase for the same Mr.
  Highbrite a small motor-van which had been placed in Evans' hands for sale.
  The negotiations had been going on for a month, and Evans was getting a fiver
  out of the transaction, for the owner of the motor-van was a very old friend
  of his.</p>

  <p>Only for one moment, as he saw £75 placed on the table, in real money, did
  he falter&mdash;and then, in a spirit of restlessness, he clutched the money
  with a trembling hand.</p>

  <p>"I sha'n't want this car for a couple of days, Mr. Evans," said Mr.
  Highbrite. "I am going down to Brighton for the week-end, and I know I can
  trust you."</p>

  <p>"I am like the celebrated Caesar's wife," said Evans hollowly: "All things
  to all men!"</p>

  <p>That night he saw Goolby, and told him in detail the manner in which he
  had accumulated £245, 10s. He did not exactly explain the motorcar incident:
  that sounded too much like robbery with violence.</p>

  <p>Mr. Goolby listened and internally gloated. If there was one man in the
  world he desired to put it across, it was Educated Evans.</p>

  <p>"Go down to Sandown yourself, my boy. Don't trust these S.P. bookmakers;
  it will only get about. Go up and down the rails and put on a tenner here and
  a tenner there, and you won't affect the price."</p>

  <p>After Evans had gone, Mr. Goolby got on to the telephone to his Epsom
  trainer.</p>

  <p>"Run that rag of mine on Saturday," he said.</p>

  <p>"But he is shin sore," protested the voice at the other end, "and even if
  he wasn't, he hasn't got a ghost of a chance of winning the Maiden
  Plate."</p>

  <p>"Run him," hissed Mr. Goolby.</p>

  <p>Mr. Goolby had three cronies, men who were as wide as Broad Street, but
  had never been convicted, and it so happened that these three men had also
  suffered irreparable injury at the hands of Educated Evans, for they had been
  in Mr. Goolby's coup that had gone astray.</p>

  <p>To them he confided the story of his fell deed.</p>

  <p>That Friday was a very anxious day for Mr. Evans. He was torn between love
  and duty. He had acquired quite a number of good clients &mdash;men of
  substance who would act honourable in the event of a win. Should he leave
  them in the lurch, or put them in the cart, or leave them out? The thought
  was intolerable. His oath of secrecy was one lightly to be broken, for Mr.
  Evans was a God-fearing man who regarded all oaths concerning race-horses as
  <i>ultra vires</i> from the start.</p>

  <p>He struggled with himself before he went to a wealthy poulterer, and then
  to an opulent furniture merchant, and thirdly to a plutocratic dealer in
  second-hand clothes, and told them the tale.</p>

  <p>"You are on the odds to a fiver," said the second-hand gentleman, "and
  I'll put the wire in at the last minute."</p>

  <p>The others promised almost as extravagant a reward.</p>

  <p>Encouraged by this dream of easy wealth, Mr. Evans went further afield. He
  came back that night exhausted with his journeyings, but with the
  consciousness that he was on the odds to £60 with twenty-three reliable
  clients who had acted honourable before, and would no doubt act honourable
  again.</p>

  <p>On. Waterloo platform next day he met The Miller, and to The Miller he
  confided his intelligence.</p>

  <p>"Give me my tenner back," said The Miller. "I can get a better price
  myself."</p>

  <p>He ran his eye down the programme.</p>

  <p>"You mightn't see his name there," said Evans, anxiously. "He was only
  named a couple of days ago."</p>

  <p>"He's here all right: where did you get him from?"</p>

  <p>"From the owner," said Evans, and The Miller looked at him
  suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"That sounds like a lie," he said, "and therefore it is a lie."</p>

  <p>The race was the second on the card, and there was a horse in the race
  called Jujube, and apparently all the cognoscenti had been waiting for Jujube
  ever since the moment he was foaled. For no sooner did a reckless
  bookmaker&mdash;and you know how reckless bookmakers can be&mdash;open his
  mouth and shout "6-4 on the field," than he was almost trampled to death by
  the rush of gentlemen anxious to relieve him of his surplus wealth.</p>

  <p>Evans waited till the market had settled before he sidled up to one of the
  loudest of the bookmakers, and then:</p>

  <p>"... I'll lay a thousand to sixty Press Cutting."</p>

  <p>Evans held up his hand like a small boy at school anxious to call his
  teacher's attention to his necessities.</p>

  <p>"I'll take yer," he said, huskily.</p>

  <p>The great bookmaker blinked at him, momentarily paralysed, but
  mechanically put out his hand to take the money, a gesture which no bookmaker
  ever forgets until he is dead.</p>

  <p>From another adventurer Evans took 500-40. His last penny was invested
  when he turned a moist face to meet The Miller.</p>

  <p>"What price did you get?" asked that energetic officer of the law.</p>

  <p>"Sixteen's and twelve's," said Evans.</p>

  <p>The Miller sneered.</p>

  <p>"They saw you coming," he said. "I got 25-1 all right to my tenner. Now
  tell me the truth. Evans: do you really know Lord Fanerly?"</p>

  <p>"Lord who?" asked the staggered Evans.</p>

  <p>"Fanerly," said The Miller, impatiently. "You said you knew the owner of
  Press Cutting."</p>

  <p>"He don't own him," said the agitated Evans. "He belongs to Goolby."</p>

  <p>The Miller scowled from Evans to the card.</p>

  <p>"Here's Goolby's horse," he said&mdash;"No. 4. Colt by Newsboy out of
  Railway Tunnel!... Here, hold up!"&mdash;for Mr. Evans had collapsed against
  him.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to back Goolby's horse," he wailed. "Oh, my Gawd, I've backed
  the wrong 'un!"</p>

  <p>The Miller shook him with an ungentle hand.</p>

  <p>"You poor soused mackerel," he hissed. "Do you mean to tell me you've done
  in my tenner?"</p>

  <p>At that moment the gate went up, and a crowd of silken jackets jumbled
  together. Half-way it was impossible to tell which of six horses was leading,
  but a furlong from home the puce-and-green jacket of Lord Fanerly forged to
  the front.</p>

  <p>"We've won," gasped The Miller. "You lucky rat!"</p>

  <p>In the unsaddling enclosure Lord Fanerly was talking to a friend.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's a rum-looking devil, and the queer thing is that when I named
  him, there was another feller applying for exactly the same name, but I got
  in five minutes ahead of him.</p>

  <p>"Not badly named, is he?... By Short Cut out of Brief Survey...</p>

  <p>"A rum-looking devil!"</p>
