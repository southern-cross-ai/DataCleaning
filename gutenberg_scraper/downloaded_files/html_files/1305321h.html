  <p class="blurb">The following sketches were written about a period when "a
  contemptible little army" fell back from Mons on Paris, advanced north to the
  Aisne, and finally arrived in Belgium to fight the first battle of Ypres.</p>

  <p class="blurb">Much water has flowed under the bridge since they were
  written: there are not many left of that original handful who crossed the
  water; and yet a second winter finds us in positions practically unchanged.
  True, the trenches have improved; the bombs are better; the guns more
  numerous. But the boredom and the mud, the cold and the fright, are just the
  same.</p>

  <p class="blurb">The stories are not chronological, and, needless to say,
  portray no specific individual. All are founded on fact, sketched in with a
  framework of imagination.</p>

  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1"></a>I. &mdash; THREE TO ONE<br>
  An Incident in the Advance from Paris</h2>

  <h3>Published as "The Guards" in <i>Michael Cassidy, Sergeant</i></h3>

  <p class="first">"SURE, and it's the neatest little girl I've seen this side
  of Connymara that you are. It's a souvenir that you're wanting? By jabers!
  it's a souvenir you'll have, anyway. 'Tis the correct thing the other side of
  the water, whichever way you go."</p>

  <p>The resounding noise of a kiss assailed my scandalised ears, followed by
  rapidly retreating feminine footsteps.</p>

  <p>"I'll be after waiting for you here tomorrow morning at the same time."
  Sergeant Michael Cassidy's rich Irish voice followed the invisible recipient
  of his souvenir as she departed; and judging by the way he leaned over the
  railings waving an extremely dirty pocket-handkerchief, I came to the
  reluctant conclusion that the lady was not only not averse to receiving
  souvenirs, but would in all probability return for more.</p>

  <p>"Are you not ashamed of yourself, Michael Cassidy &mdash; you with a wife
  and four children in Ballygoyle?" I remarked, as the handkerchief gradually
  became less violent.</p>

  <p>"And what the devil &mdash; Ah! by all the saints! 'tis you, sir." Limping
  and leaning heavily on a crutch, Sergeant Cassidy came towards me. "'Tis
  great to see you again, sir. Is it wounded you've been, or why are you not
  over yonder?" He waved his free arm vaguely in the direction of Wales:
  however his meaning was clear.</p>

  <p>"I was abroad when it started, Cassidy, and they've caught me for
  Kitchener's Army." I held my cigarette case out to him.</p>

  <p>"'Tis bad luck that," he remarked, as he lit one of my best gold-tipped
  cigarettes. "But bedad you'll be after getting all you want when you do get
  out. It's no picnic at all &mdash; what with the Black Marias, and coal
  boxes, and snipers."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you?" I asked as we sat down.</p>

  <p>"I stopped a bit of lead with my foot. Nothing at all: we were just
  putting up a bit of wire one night in a wood, and one of them snipers got an
  outer in my foot."</p>

  <p>He regarded the offending member with a critical eye, and carefully
  deposited it on a seat.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>And here, to make things clear, I must digress for a moment. Michael
  Cassidy is a sergeant in His Majesty's Corps of Royal Engineers, to which I
  also have the honour to belong in the humble capacity of officer. I say
  humble advisedly; for there are sergeants of many sorts and kinds, and there
  is Michael Cassidy, and in his presence even Brigadier-Generals have
  trembled. Now in the days before the exigencies of the service had taken me
  abroad to an abominable island given over almost exclusively to priests and
  goats (anyone who has been condemned to soldier there will at once recognise
  its name) &mdash; in the days before my incarceration, then, on this dread
  spot, I had for some years soldiered side by side with Sergeant Cassidy. For
  when one's motto is "Ubique," it follows that one may live for a space with a
  man, and then obeying the dictates of the Great Powers that Be at the War
  Office, be rudely torn away from old friends and associations, whom one may
  never see again, and be hurled into the midst of new faces as well as new
  conditions. Lucky for the man who escapes the abode of goats: but that is
  neither here nor there, and anyway it's all in the day's work, I suppose.</p>

  <p>Be that as it may, the order of my release from its inhospitable shores
  having coincided most aptly with a regrettable midnight fracas with the local
  police, which incidentally is quite another story, I had shaken its dust
  rapidly and joyfully from my feet and sailed for home, full of war and
  cocktails. I had landed some ten days before, to find myself posted to a
  "Catch 'em Alive oh!" but withal cheery crowd of solicitors, grocers,
  tailors, and coalheavers, who go to make up the New Army. Chancing to wander
  one morning round the garden of a select London mansion, which had been put
  at the disposal of wounded soldiers, my eyes had been gladdened by the events
  which I have already chronicled, and I metaphorically fell upon the neck of
  my old and disreputable friend.</p>

  <p>"And how's the old crowd getting along, Cassidy?" I asked when he was
  comfortably settled.</p>

  <p>"Fine, sir, fine. 'Tis a lot of officers we've lost, though &mdash; killed
  and wounded." He gave a little sigh. "Do you recall young Mr Trentham, him
  that came to us last Christmas, just before you went away?"</p>

  <p>"I do," I answered. "I see he's wounded, in today's list."</p>

  <p>"'Tis that that made me speak, sir. You remember him &mdash; quiet he was
  &mdash; without the necessary swallow which helps an officer to drink the
  healths of his men properly on Christmas Day."</p>

  <p>I had vivid recollections of his inability to do so &mdash; but that is
  neither here nor there.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, he may not be able to drink like some of us" &mdash; I
  indignantly repudiated this monstrous aspersion &mdash; "he may not, I say,
  be able to drink like some of us, but glory be he can fight. I have not seen
  his equal outside Ballygoyle. You mind the manner of young gentleman he was,
  sir, strong as a bull, with an arm like the hind leg of an elephant. He was
  fair crazy to get at them, was Mr Trentham; he couldn't stand the sort of
  fighting we were getting at all. 'It is not fighting,' he says to me one day,
  'when you can't bill someone over the head with the butt end of a rifle once
  in a way.' I said to myself at the time, I said: 'May Heaven help the Boche
  you do put your hands on, for he'll want all of that and more.'</p>

  <p>"Well, one day, I misremember the name of the place we were at, but it
  wasn't like what it is now, all one long line &mdash; there was a chance of
  striking a stray Uhlan on his own, scouting, if he wasn't drunk &mdash; and
  when them fellows do get on the drink, you can take it from me, sir, the
  races at Ballygoone ain't in it. Well, Mr Trentham and I were out one day,
  things being fairly quiet, and we thought we might visit one of those cafés
  they call them, and see if we could raise a bottle of the good. 'Tis poor
  stuff they have there, but we thought it was worth trying. We came along the
  road, and there in front of the café we were going to, we saw some horses
  tied up.</p>

  <p>"'Steady,' says he to me all of a sudden; 'they aren't our horses, nor
  French either, unless I'm much mistaken.' At that moment out walks a man.
  'Jove, Cassidy,' says he, pulling me behind a bush, 'it's Germans they are: a
  patrol of Uhlans.'</p>

  <p>"'They are that, sir,' says I. 'What will we do? for not a drop will they
  have left in that café."</p>

  <p>"He thought a moment, and then a lovely look came over his face. 'What
  will we do, Cassidy?' he says. 'What do you think?'</p>

  <p>"'The same as you, sir,' says I.</p>

  <p>"With that I followed him as fast as we could leg it towards that café,
  keeping under cover of some bushes by the road. At last we got to the place,
  and crept in through the back. Just as we got to the window, creeping, we
  were, along the side of the house, we heard a girl scream inside, followed by
  a roar of laughter. Mr Trentham, he forgot the risk, straightens himself up
  and looks in through the window. I do the same. Mother of Heaven! 'twas
  awful. There was six of them in all, six of the dirty traitorous swine.
  They'd been drinking hard, and the old lady that kept the café was trussed up
  in a corner. They'd been having pot shots at her with the empty bottles. Her
  face was all cut, and half stunned she was. The old man was bound to the
  table, but they hadn't stunned him. They'd left him in the full possession of
  his senses that he might the better appreciate the fun. They'd got the
  daughter &mdash; a pretty girl, of maybe twenty &mdash; in a chair. Well, I
  needn't say more, but every time the poor old man tried to get to her, they
  pulled the table back and roared with laughter. The swine &mdash; the
  cowardly swine!"</p>

  <p>The veins were standing out in Cassidy's neck as he spoke: he was back
  again looking through that window. "Mr Trentham he turns to me and mutters.
  'Three to one, Michael Cassidy, three to one,' he says, and his face was
  white, saving only his eyes, and they were blood-red. 'Three to one,' and his
  voice was thick, and he shook like a man with the ague as we crept through
  the back door. 'Three to one,' he snarled as we got to the door, while his
  hand, that had been shaking with the fury of his passion, grew steady as a
  rock. For a moment we stood outside of the door, and as I looked at him I
  said to myself, I said, 'You were dangerous at the window when you saw red,'
  I says; 'but by the Holy Mother a regiment of Uhlans wouldn't stop you now.'
  And then we went in. 'Twas great, oh! 'twas great. They stood there, that six
  &mdash; gaping, they were. Then one of them muttered 'English.' Then I saw Mr
  Trentham go in. Oh! 'twas an education &mdash; a dream. And then I lost sight
  of him in the box-up. I got home on one of their heads with my rifle belt,
  and split it like a pumpkin. My backhander hit the lamp, and spoilt the next
  one, but it reached his face, and it was enough for him. And then I saw one
  getting out of the door. I caught him in the garden: he will not play that
  game again. When I got back I found everything was silent, saving only the
  poor old woman moaning in the corner. It was an awful sight. Mr Trentham,
  he'd swung two of them together, and cracked both their skulls. They was dead
  as mutton. The other one he'd got at with his hands.</p>

  <p>"'Is there any more of them, Michael Cassidy?' he says.</p>

  <p>"'There is not, sir,' says I. 'They are all dead, the devils, and their
  horses are without.'</p>

  <p>"''Twas a great blow that first one of yours,' he says.</p>

  <p>"'It felt good, sir,' says I. ''Tis a blow we use at Ballygoyle with empty
  bottles on race days.'</p>

  <p>"While we'd been speaking we'd untied the old man and the old lady, but
  the poor girl she just lay there dazed and sick. 'Twas awful, the room.
  You've never seen such a shambles in your life, sir &mdash; oh! 'twas
  fearful. We pulled out the dead Germans, and threw them into the wood, and
  then we cleared up the mess as best we could. We left them there, the three
  of them, the poor old man trying to comfort his old wife, and the pair of
  them weeping by the daughter. Ah! the devils, the swine: to think of it. It
  might have been one's own girl, sir; and the look in her eyes &mdash; I'll
  never forget it."</p>

  <p>"But you killed the lot, Cassidy. That's the main point: you killed the
  brutes," I cried excitedly.</p>

  <p>"And is not one officer of the British Army and one sergeant sufficient
  for six Germans when it comes to that sort of work, especially when the
  officer is such as Mr Trentham?" he answered with dignity.</p>

  <p>He did not add a like comparison for the sergeant.</p>

  <p>I admired him for it.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2"></a>II. &mdash; A FIRE IN BILLETS<br>
  A Farm near Bailleul, December 1914</h2>

  <p class="first">"'Tis a fine body of men that they are," remarked Sergeant
  Cassidy to me, as I sat with him one day in the house where he was slowly
  recovering from the wound in his foot, which had caused his temporary absence
  from the plains of Flanders. As he spoke his eyes followed the fire engine,
  drawn by two grand white horses, disappearing in the distance. The bell was
  still clanging faintly, as he absent-mindedly felt in his pocket, to find
  that as usual he'd left his cigarettes upstairs.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a fine body of men that they are," he remarked again, as he took one
  of mine. "But, by jabers! sir, seeing them going up the street there, brings
  to my mind the last fire that I was present at, over yonder." On this
  occasion he indicated Northumberland with a large hand; but, no matter.</p>

  <p>"You'll mind," he went on after a reflective pause, "that those farms over
  the water are not what you would call the equals of Buckingham Palace for
  comfort. The majority of them are built in the same manner all over the
  country, and when you've seen one you've seen the lot. There's the farm
  itself, in which reside the owners and the officers. The officers have a room
  to themselves, but in these farms all the rooms lead into one another. Mr
  Tracey &mdash; you mind him, sir, the officer with the spectacles, fat he was
  &mdash; he was powerful set on washing, which is not to be encouraged in that
  trying weather; and he was rendered extremely irritated by the habit of the
  ladies of the farm, who would walk through the room when he was in his
  bath.</p>

  <p>"I mind one morning, perishing cold it was, when I came up to the kitchen
  to see him, and I looked through the door. Two of the old women of the farm
  were in the room, and they'd left both the doors open, while they had a bit
  of a set-to about something. Poor Mr Tracey was sitting in his bath, shouting
  at them to go out of the room and shut the door. He'd lost his spectacles,
  and his towel had fallen in the bath, and the draught was causing him great
  uneasiness. 'Twas a terrible example of the dangers of washing in those
  parts."</p>

  <p>Sergeant Cassidy shook his head reflectively.</p>

  <p>"Still," he continued after a moment, "'twas of the farms I was speaking.
  They have most of them two barns which run perpendicular to the farmhouse, so
  that the three buildings enclose a sort of square yard in the middle of them.
  The barns are full of straw and hay and the like, and there it is that the
  men sleep, though 'tis well to climb up to the loft, and not to remain on the
  ground floor. The reason will be clear to you. These folks are very partial
  to pigs and hens and cows, and they are not particular where the animals go
  at night. When therefore I was roused from my sleep on one occasion by a
  fearful yell from below, I was not surprised.</p>

  <p>"'Mother of Heaven! 'tis the Germans,' says the man next to me, hunting
  for his gun.</p>

  <p>"''Tis nothing of the sort,' I says, as I looked through the loft. ''Tis
  the pig, going to bed, and she has sat on the face of Angus MacNab.'</p>

  <p>"'The dirty beast has sat on me face,' cried MacNab, as he saw me.</p>

  <p>"'Then 'tis the pig I'm concerned about,' says I, and I went back to my
  blankets. I have no patience with them Scotchmen."</p>

  <p>Sergeant Cassidy again availed himself of my cigarette case. "But where
  does the fire come in, Cassidy?" I asked, as he lit up.</p>

  <p>"I am just coming to that, sir. As you can imagine, the soldier will not
  stop his smoking because he is in the middle of hay and straw. It is too much
  to ask of any man. There are strict orders about it, of course, but &mdash;
  well, an officer like you will understand, sir. One day &mdash; it was about
  eleven o'clock in the morning &mdash; one of the men says to me, 'Look at the
  barn.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis fired,' I cried, and there was smoke coming out at the top of the
  thatching. 'Run, ye blackguards, run. It's water and buckets we'll be
  wanting.'</p>

  <p>"The first man in was the dirty schemer O'Toole, him that had been excused
  duty that very morning by the doctor for gout in the foot.</p>

  <p>"'I have my bull's-eyes saved,' he says to me as I came up.</p>

  <p>"'You flat-faced malingerer,' says I, 'you have fatigues for a month as
  well.'</p>

  <p>"And then the officers came out. ''Tis fired, it is,' I says to the Major.
  Do you recall the Major, sir. A terrible sarcastic man he was &mdash; with an
  eyeglass.</p>

  <p>"He puts it in his eye as I spoke. 'I didn't imagine the damn'd thing was
  frostbitten,' he says. 'Who's the fool who did it?'</p>

  <p>"Then the boys got the water going. We had a ladder placed up to the loft,
  and we handed the buckets up to the men above. The lads kept a chain of full
  buckets on the move from hand to hand. But it was hopeless from the
  start.</p>

  <p>"'Get the animals out, boys,' I shouts.</p>

  <p>"Then the fun began. The old women were out wringing their hands and
  weeping, and the old farmer was shouting to the interpreter, with a little
  pig under each arm. The interpreter goes up to the Major, and tells him that
  the farmer said there was a fire engine in the village. So the Major he sends
  off one of the officers to get it. Meantime one of the pigs had knocked down
  the old women, and then got entangled in their skirts. When that little
  box-up came to rest in the middle of the refuse pit, the skirts were on the
  pig. Oh! 'twas great. The fair at Ballygoyle was not in it. Then Mr Tracey he
  climbs up the ladder to the loft, and gets an empty bucket in the chest, as
  they threw it out.</p>

  <p>"''Tis hopeless, sir,' he says to the Major when he could again speak, for
  the wind he had lost.</p>

  <p>"So the Major orders all the men out of the barn, and we started pouring
  water on the house to keep it from spreading. And then after about an hour
  the fire engine arrived. 'Twas the most amazing contraption you ever did see.
  'Twas an old tub on two wheels, with a hand-pump attached, and it had been
  brought by three old gentlemen with grey hair &mdash; one of them with a
  wooden leg. 'Twas the local fire brigade &mdash; the rest had gone to the
  war. The old man with the wooden leg took on something terrible. He hopped
  about crying 'Oh! Oh!' and we thought he was hurt till the interpreter said
  he wanted the tub filled with water. Just as we had it filled the old pig
  knocked it over, and we had to fill it again. A terrible machine it was! When
  it was filled, those of the lads who could speak for laughter started to
  pump, while one of the old gentlemen took the nozzle, and climbed up the roof
  of the farmhouse, that he might the better direct the water. He had his thumb
  over the end of the nozzle to get the pressure up, and 'twas a powerful thumb
  he had, for the hose burst near the Major, and the water took him in the
  stomach. The lads were pumping with a will, and in stepping back the Major
  overbalanced and fell into the refuse pit in the centre of the courtyard. Oh!
  a terrible sight he was as he got up. All the men spent the afternoon looking
  for his eyeglass. And then the old gentleman on the roof was overcome by the
  heat, and fell off, and was only saved from destruction by going into a tub
  of pigwash. 'Twas a great diversion, as, having his head downwards, he was
  nearly drowned."</p>

  <p>I could stand it no more, so I rose to go. "Were the people compensated,
  Cassidy?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"They will be, sir," he answered, "they will be &mdash; though it's my own
  belief the old ruffian of a farmer set light to it himself. 'Twas poor hay
  that he had, and he will be paid as if 'twas best quality."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story3"
     name="story3"></a>III. &mdash; MEDICAL INSPECTION<br>
  Cleanliness is Next to...</h2>

  <p class="first">The other morning was not one of my best. Somehow in the
  days of peace I had always laboured under the delusion that, if ever we did
  go to war, we should at any rate enter simultaneously into an era when the
  ordnance cease from troubling and the doctors are at rest. So having found
  how great the delusion really was, my heart yearned for Sergeant Cassidy. His
  views on life in general, especially with regard to those branches of the
  Service whose mission in life is the annoyance of everyone else, would, I
  thought, be as balm to my anguished soul.</p>

  <p>I found him in bed. His foot had relapsed.</p>

  <p>"Cassidy," I said, as I handed him my cigarette case, "I am in trouble. A
  doctor has just inspected us, and was very put out to find the ration meat
  for the men floating in the soak-pit of a neighbouring ablution bench. It was
  not put there by my instructions, as I told him, but he was unappeasable.
  Again, a Board Inventory, the property of the Army Service Corps, has been
  defaced, in that false figures have been added by some person or persons
  unknown. Personally I suspect the solicitor, who is at present doing
  cook-mate, of having feloniously inserted the figures 94 opposite the item
  'Shovels, coal, ordinary. Mark 6A.' We have not, as you know, got 94 shovels,
  coal, ordinary, Mark 6A. We haven't got one. It has been lost, and personally
  I again suspect the solicitor: but the stout gentleman who was making his
  weekly or yearly inspection has already reported it to the Army Council. He
  gave me to understand that if we do lose the war, it will probably be owing
  to that Inventory Board." I sighed deeply and relapsed into silence.</p>

  <p>"'Tis always the same, sir," he answered kindly: I needed sympathy. "'Tis
  always the same. The great thing is to discover their little weaknesses
  before they come round to see one. Of course the circumstances you mention
  are peculiar. I doubt me that, even had you discovered their peculiarities,
  so to speak, you would have escaped entirely &mdash; for as you say, sir, the
  soak-pit is no place for the meat to rest in at all. Still, 'tis a most
  important thing, and should be looked into on all occasions of that
  nature.</p>

  <p>"I mind me now of a thing which took place some fortnight before I got the
  little souvenir in my foot. We were in billets; 'twas the billet of which I
  have already spoken, where the barn was burnt down. One day the doctor comes
  to me and says, 'Cassidy,' he says, 'it's inspected we'll be.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis not the first time that same thing has happened,' says I, 'and we
  will survive. Do not be uneasy, sir. 'Twill be all right.'</p>

  <p>"I should tell you that our doctor was not a soldier at all: one of those
  civilians, he was, who came in at the beginning. His principal duty when we
  was resting in billets was the obtaining of food and drink for the officers,
  at which same game, so I heard, he was hard to beat. One of them gentlemen
  who has a way with him: he would coax a bottle of the stuff out of a
  lime-kiln, and most of them cafés were worse than that after the boys had
  been there for a bit. A cheery gentleman he was, who always got mistakes in
  his returns. You mind them returns, sir &mdash; in triplicate they are
  generally, and he could not abide them same. Oh! there was a terrible box-up
  when he made a mistake on one occasion, and mixed up the number of orderlies
  that he had with the number of men that had been inoculated for the enteric.
  For he had but two orderlies, and one hundred and sixty of the boys had the
  inoculation taken.</p>

  <p>"Of course he was not used to inspections, but I told him 'twould be all
  right. 'Twas the chief of all the doctors was coming, he said, and as he
  always got his returns wrong, he was anxious that all should be well. So we
  went round together, and he poked his nose into all the places where the men
  slept, and the cook-houses, and the like. I turned them on to the cleaning
  up, and soon the smell was not quite so bad as usual. We had everything ready
  the night before, and the men had knocked off, when the doctor comes to me in
  a terrible state.</p>

  <p>"'Cassidy,' he says, 'we have the bath forgot.'</p>

  <p>"'Bath,' says I, 'what will we be wanting with a bath? Have not the boys
  their buckets? And it is not the Hotel Cecil that we have.'</p>

  <p>"'Cassidy,' he says, 'the chief doctor is the devil on a bath for the men.
  That and a tub in which to wash their clothes we must have, or it's lost I
  am. I heard just now 'twas the first thing he'd look for.'</p>

  <p>"'Bedad,' says I, 'if 'tis the peculiarity of the chief doctor we will get
  a bath, or my name is not Michael Cassidy. &mdash; O'Toole,' I shouts, 'you
  lazy blatherer, I'm wanting you.' 'Twas the scheming malingerer that had been
  excused duty for the gout in the foot, and had us all beat when we ran to the
  burning barn, to save his peppermint bull's-eyes. You mind I told you of that
  same O'Toole. I says when he comes, 'Hunt round and find a bath.'</p>

  <p>"'A bath!' says he, 'and where will I be finding that same?'</p>

  <p>"'Is it me that would be saving you that trouble?' I cries. 'The doctor
  wishes a bath; do not let me see your ugly face till you have one found.'</p>

  <p>"'I'm thinking,' says I, when he had gone, 'that if we cannot get a bath,
  it is a hole we might dig in the field, and line it with the waterproof
  sheets. They did that same, the squadron in the next farm, but owing to the
  difficulty of seeing which was hole and which was not when they had it filled
  with the water, the old sow fell in at the same time as the sergeant-major,
  and there was a terrible commotion.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis something better we must have, Cassidy,' he says. 'The chief doctor
  is a terrible man, and he has it against me that I told him in triplicate
  that I had one hundred and sixty orderlies.'</p>

  <p>"At that moment back comes O'Toole. 'I have it found,' he cries. 'There is
  a big tub yonder of metal, that they use for the pig-wash, and empty it
  is.'</p>

  <p>"'It will serve,' says I when I see it. 'Can ye paint, O'Toole?'</p>

  <p>"'I can that,' he says.</p>

  <p>"'There is a man with some whitewash,' I says, 'painting the farm. Get
  that same and write BATH upon that tub.'</p>

  <p>"'But the wash-tub,' cries the doctor. 'We have it forgot.'</p>

  <p>"'Is there another of them tubs, O'Toole?' I says.</p>

  <p>"'There is not,' he says. 'I have the farm searched.'</p>

  <p>"'What will we do?' cried the doctor. 'The chief doctor is a devil for
  wash-tubs; and, Cassidy,' he says coaxingly, 'there's that matter of the
  orderlies.' Oh! he had a way with him, had the doctor.</p>

  <p>"''Tis not I that will be failing you,' I cries, and I thinks for a
  moment. I looks at the tub, and then sudden-like I gets the idea.</p>

  <p>"''Tis big enough,' I says, 'tis plenty big. O'Toole,' I cries, 'O'Toole,
  ye blackguard, you will paint BATH as I have told you on this side of that
  tub, and on the other you will paint WASH-TUB. Do you follow me,
  O'Toole?'</p>

  <p>"'I do that,' he says, and goes off for the whitewash.</p>

  <p>"The doctor was gazing at me. 'What is the notion?' he says, 'for the
  chief doctor will not be deceived.'</p>

  <p>"'Leave it to me, sir,' I says: 'leave it to me,' for I had the scheme in
  my mind.</p>

  <p>"The next day I sent for O'Toole. 'You have it marked,' I says. 'That is
  good. Now listen while I tell you, you dirty malingerer. The chief doctor is
  inspecting us this day, and the devil he is on baths and washtubs. You will
  place the tub against the wall in the barn with the word BATH outwards. The
  chief doctor is coming at eleven, but it's late he may be. On the other hand
  he may be early. So at a quarter to eleven you will remove your clothes, and
  stand by the bath.'</p>

  <p>"'But, Sergeant!' he says.</p>

  <p>"'There is no but,' says I. 'When the chief doctor appears you will
  receive the signal from Angus MacNab, who will be at the door, and you will
  get into the water. You will get into the water, I say, and when the chief
  doctor comes in at the door you will pretend that you like it.'</p>

  <p>"'But it's dead I shall be!' he cries.</p>

  <p>"''Twill be no loss,' says I. Then I sends for six of the boys. 'The chief
  doctor is coming,' I says, 'and the devil he is on baths and wash-tubs. I
  have the bath fixed for O'Toole; but when I shall give the signal for which
  you will watch, you will rush in and seize the tub and carry it round to the
  other side of the barn, and put it against the wall with WASH-TUB showing. I
  will see the chief doctor goes round the other way; then when he appears you
  will be washing your socks. There will be water in it from the bath of
  O'Toole.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis only one pair of socks that I have,' says one.</p>

  <p>"'Then 'tis high time they were washed,' says I. 'Be off, you blackguards,
  and may Heaven help you if you have the doctor let down.'</p>

  <p>"At eleven-thirty the chief doctor arrives. ''Tis the bath I would see,'
  he says.</p>

  <p>"''Tis occupied, sir,' says I, giving the sign to Angus MacNab. 'Twas high
  time too, for O'Toole had been dressed only in his shirt for three-quarters
  of an hour.'</p>

  <p>"When we got to the barn there was O'Toole standing in the water. He was
  blue with the cold, and shivering like a leaf in the wind.</p>

  <p>"'Ah! my man,' says the chief doctor, ''tis a bath you're having, I
  see.'</p>

  <p>"'Sit down, you varmint,' I whispers, 'sit down and splash. It's enjoying
  yourself you are.'</p>

  <p>"'And how often do you take a bath?' says the chief doctor.</p>

  <p>"'Every day,' mutters O'Toole, when he could speak for the chattering of
  his teeth, for I had my eye fixed upon him.</p>

  <p>"'Very good indeed,' says the chief doctor. 'A most satisfactory
  arrangement,' he remarks to our own doctor. 'And now I will inspect the place
  where they have the clothes washed.'</p>

  <p>"'Get out,' I says to O'Toole as they goes out.</p>

  <p>"''Tis dying I am,' he says, as the six men rushes in for the tub.</p>

  <p>"'Step it, you blackguards!' I cries. 'I will keep them diverted till you
  have it in place.'</p>

  <p>"With that I catches up the party, and asks the Colonel concerning one of
  the cookhouses nearby. The doctor keeps him occupied inside, I having given
  him the wink, and then out come the boys with the tub. They stuck going
  round, as the passage was narrow, but I had them fixed with my eye, and they
  suddenly fell through together. The tub upset and the water was received by
  Angus MacNab. There was a terrible noise as it fell on the bricks, but they
  was out of sight when the doctor appeared.</p>

  <p>"'And now the wash-tub,' he says.</p>

  <p>"'Round here, sir,' says I, and with that I leads the party to the other
  side of the barn. They had it fixed, as he comes up.</p>

  <p>"'But it is empty,' says he. 'You cannot wash clothes without water. And
  what is that at the bottom?'</p>

  <p>"He pointed to a watery-looking grey object at the bottom of the tub.</p>

  <p>"''Tis the shirt of O'Toole," whispers one of the men to me, 'that slipped
  in by mistake.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis a shirt,' says I, 'the owner of which has been in contact with a
  horse with the ringworm.' At that moment I heard the voice of O'Toole from
  inside as he looked for his shirt, and I went on a little louder, the better
  to drown his horrible language. 'I have the men instructed that they are to
  empty the water away after washing any of his garments.'</p>

  <p>"'But why does he not wash his own?' asks the Colonel.</p>

  <p>"'In this unit, sir,' says I, 'the medical officer is that particular that
  we has a special squad trained in washing.'</p>

  <p>"'Indeed,' says he, and looked at me close. 'Twas a mercy he did not look
  at our own doctor, for he was purple in the face, and unable to speak with
  ease. 'Indeed,' says he, and fixes his eye on the one sock which was all the
  whole six could muster between them for the washing. 'I trust they are not
  overworked.'</p>

  <p>"I have since wondered whether he suspected anything," murmured Cassidy,
  as he took another of my cigarettes.</p>

  <p>I left the great man smoking reflectively, and as I reached the front door
  the sense of my great inferiority descended like a pall. What would he have
  done had the meat been found in the soak-pit? But at this moment I was nearly
  run over by a motor omnibus.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story4"
     name="story4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE GUARDS</h2>

  <p class="first">As I strolled into the house one morning where Sergeant
  Michael Cassidy was recovering from the wound in his foot, I found a subdued
  air of bustle and confusion.</p>

  <p>"And what is up this morning, sister?" I asked. "You seem very busy."</p>

  <p>"He wishes to go for a drive," she said.</p>

  <p>I smiled, and asked the unnecessary question. There being some twenty
  other wounded in the house, to the casual observer the question as to who
  wished to go for a drive might not appear unnecessary; but then the casual
  observer does not know Cassidy. Receiving, as I had anticipated, an amazed:
  "Why, Sergeant Cassidy, of course," I thoughtfully left her to lay down the
  necessary red carpet on the steps, and wended my way upstairs to his
  room.</p>

  <p>I found the great man in a gracious mood.</p>

  <p>"Ah! 'tis yourself, sir," he said, as I came in. "And it's pleased to see
  you that I am."</p>

  <p>"I hear you're going for a drive, Cassidy," I remarked, as he held out his
  hand for my cigarette case. "I rather think I'll come with you &mdash;
  unless," I hastened to add, "any beautiful lady wishes for the
  privilege."</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, "no; I was going alone, and it's delighted I shall be
  if you will come."</p>

  <p>And so it happened that in a few minutes we were rolling smoothly towards
  Regent's Park. It was at the entrance by Sussex Place, as far as I can
  remember, that he suddenly blew a delighted kiss to a lady standing on the
  pavement, whom I recognised, to my horror, as the wife of a well-known
  sporting peer.</p>

  <p>"Cassidy," I said, "for Heaven's sake, what are you doing?" I clutched his
  arm. "Do you know who that was?"</p>

  <p>"I do not," he said. "But she was a decent enough looking little filly,
  and would I not be blowing her a kiss?" He dismissed this untoward incident
  with a wave of the hand, and sat back majestically in the car. The next
  instant he sat up with a jerk. "Glory be, sir," he said, "and what is that
  that I see?"</p>

  <p>I followed the direction of his eyes, and saw, that at present familiar
  sight to all Londoners, a line of men in wonderful garments, bowlers, flannel
  trousers, scarlet tunics, brown brogue shoes, and the like, advancing a few
  paces, then lying down, and finally charging the road with hoarse and
  horrible noises.</p>

  <p>"It is Kitchener's Army training," I said.</p>

  <p>"The saints be praised," he remarked. "Seeing them without any uniform, I
  thought that likely enough some scheming blackguard had hopped it with their
  money, and that sort of row is one I am not willing to miss." He watched them
  closely as, the charge over, they closed up on the road to listen to the
  words of wisdom of their platoon commander. "Indeed," he went on after a
  moment, "'tis Kitchener's Army they are! And a likely-looking lot of boys, or
  my name is not Michael Cassidy. But tell me, sir," he turned to me, "are they
  allowed to dig in the grass here?"</p>

  <p>I told him that I really wasn't certain whether they were actually allowed
  to dig in the Park itself, but that they anyway did it elsewhere.</p>

  <p>"That is good," he said. "You must mind, sir, that the war over yonder is
  different to what you and I were brought up to. What we have just seen is
  good: 'tis undoubtedly good that the foot soldiers should be able to run and
  lie down the like we have been after looking at; but it is by no manner of
  speaking all. And it is the other great part of their training that I would
  not see left out, for, begorrah, 'tis the most important."</p>

  <p>"You mean the digging, Cassidy?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I mean that same, sir. I would march those lads miles and miles till they
  were fit to drop, and when they were so tired that they were unable to wish
  for anything &mdash; not even beer &mdash; I would say to them, 'Dig, you
  blackguards, dig yourselves in, and I will give you an hour to do that same
  in. And if I find any man who has made but a scratch in the ground, I will be
  upon him and he will be sorry that he was ever born. You are to go down four
  feet or four feet six, and you shall not rest till you have it done.' Then,
  when I had seen them do it, I would say to them, 'That is what you will do
  over yonder, only then it will not be in the daylight; 'twill be at night,
  and we will practise that same every day for the next month. It is that," he
  continued, "that made those fellows the devils," and with a large hand he
  indicated the Zoo.</p>

  <p>"Which fellows?" I asked, a little bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Those Guards," he answered. "It is there that they live, is it not?
  though it seems a strange place for those smart gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"They have moved into the Cavalry Barracks lately," I answered mildly,
  "but they are not far from here."</p>

  <p>"I knew they were somewhere in these parks," he remarked. "And you say
  they are cavalry?"</p>

  <p>"The particular barracks in Regent's Park are cavalry ones," I told
  him.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" he said, as he lit another of my cigarettes. "Well, of those
  Cavalry Guards I cannot speak. They have not, up to date, served with me
  personally." He paused in thought.</p>

  <p>"Oh! you haven't been with them out there?" I asked, as his attention
  wandered to a nursemaid on the path.</p>

  <p>"That is correct, sir," he returned, when the perambulator had vanished.
  "They have not been with me out there; but I have heard tell that they are
  equally devils. But it is of those Foot Guards that I would tell you, for I
  have not seen their equals in a fight outside of Ballygoyle. I mind me once,
  when I was in these parts before, I was standing in one of those crowded
  streets, when I heard the sound of a band, and coming along the road was a
  company of those fellows. 'Twas a dream to watch them, they were so smart;
  and I was just thinking that I myself could not have walked better than the
  man with the stick at the head, when a little rat of a man standing beside
  me, said to me all of a sudden, he says, 'And what is the use of those
  fellows? Dressed-up dolls, I call them, and that's what I and the likes of
  me have to pay for. Soldiers like you,' he says to me, 'we do not mind, but
  those &mdash;' and he spat in the gutter.</p>

  <p>"'Ye dirty little beast,' I says to him, 'is it a drink you're wanting
  with your flattery? With a face like yours, whatever clothes you were after
  putting on, it is not a doll you would resemble, but a walking pimple; and as
  for paying, you have never paid for anything yet in your life unless you
  could not steal it,' and with that I put him in the gutter too.</p>

  <p>"But it is an undoubted fact, sir," he continued, "that those fellows were
  not with a certain class of the people too popular. They are always about
  with His Majesty the King &mdash; the saints preserve him &mdash; and, as I
  say, a certain class of the people think that they cannot fight, because they
  are too grand to do that same. Well &mdash; they are wrong," and with an air
  of finality Cassidy smiled at three complete strangers of the female sex.</p>

  <p>"You mind, sir," he continued after a moment, "that, as I told you, the
  war is different to what you and I were brought up to expect. Take our own
  work, for instance. Since we have been up in the North, 'tis entirely at
  night that we have been used. The foot soldiers are in the trenches, and the
  Germans are in their trenches, so close that they are able to wish one
  another the top of the morning. But as those Germans, when they were making
  an endeavour to break through our lines, were not in the habit of ringing a
  bell before they started, it was necessary to put up a halting-place where
  they might gain breath, the better to attack. That they should stop there,
  because they could not get through the wire, was not our fault, and if they
  were killed, well, what could they expect with the range but ten or fifteen
  yards? I mind me one morning I was in the trenches, and when the dawn broke
  'twas an ugly sight. There must have been a hundred of them dead on the wire
  we had put up the night before. One of them was facing me, so close that I
  could almost touch him.</p>

  <p>"He had the wire-cutters in his right hand, and it was stretched above his
  head. He was lying on the apron of the wire, and his head was twisted, and he
  was grinning. His legs was all twisted, and he still held his rifle in his
  left hand. And he went on grinning, until I was after shouting at him to turn
  his face away. And one of those Foot Guards sergeants he says to me, he says,
  ''Tis not a pleasant sight,' he says. 'It's alive he might be, and the bully
  beef is uncommon hard on the stomach for the contemplation of him.' 'I have a
  wife,' I said to him, 'a wife and four kiddies in Ballygoyle, and it's
  thinking I am that that man there may have the same. What would she say if
  she were to see that grin? Ah! for the Holy Mother's sake, turn your face
  away,' I muttered, for my nerves were a bit upset, and I could not take my
  eyes from that grin. And then he slips down &mdash; quietly like, all of a
  sudden, and as he slipped his chin caught in one of the wires, and his head
  went back, and he stopped his grinning.</p>

  <p>"But 'twas the Guards I was after speaking to you of." Cassidy became
  cheerful again "It will be clear to you, sir," he said, "that when one is
  putting up that same wire in front of those trenches, it makes a power of
  difference who it is that is behind. For some of those lads &mdash;
  especially those recruits who had come out to replace the casualties &mdash;
  were a bit jumpy: and in the habit of loosing off into the night without due
  consideration of the consequences. It is just as easy to be killed from
  behind, when one is on the top of the ground working between the trenches, as
  it is to be killed from in front. I remember me one night when that
  flat-footed malingerer O'Toole of whom I have already spoken to you, missed
  the picket with his maul, and hit the foot of Angus MacNab. 'Twas a fearful
  howl that rent the night, and the Germans thought that it was attacking we
  were. So they started to fire. 'Lie down,' I screams as our own fellows fired
  too, 'or it's shot we shall be.' And there we lie for half an hour, while
  they shot over our heads. 'Twas a mercy no one was hit; though 'twas the
  language of MacNab that had us saved. He had thrown himself down when I
  shouted, and his face met some bully beef which had walked out of the
  trenches on its own. That and his foot combined raised the tone of his
  conversation, and deflected those bullets.</p>

  <p>"But as you know, sir," he went on, "when we are working we have not the
  time to fire even if we are attacked. It is therefore desirable to get, if
  the infantry will arrange it, a covering party, which will give the warning
  if the Germans are coming. But the infantry were having a terrible time. They
  were being shelled all day and half the night, and 'twas sometimes a little
  difficult to get that same covering party. For it meant, as you will see,
  going even nearer to the Germans than we were, and in addition to that it
  meant coming out of the trenches where they felt they were, in a manner of
  speaking, safe. It was necessary to use a little persuasion at times, and
  sometimes even we worked without them at all.</p>

  <p>"But one night, I mind me, we were to work in front of the Guards. When we
  arrived, at about ten of the clock, Mr Trentham was with us in command, and
  he crept along the trench with me to find the officer. 'Is it wiring you
  are?' he says, when we found him. 'We'll have a drop of the old and bold,
  while I arrange for the party to cover you as you work.' And with that he
  went out, and we each had a drop of the stuff, which same, I remember me, was
  the proper goods. Then he came back and said, ''Tis all arranged, and I have
  the men told that you are doing the dirty in front, and they will not fire
  until I tell them.' Mr Trentham and I, we looked at one another, and 'twas
  the same thought in both our minds: 'If 'twas always like that how easy it
  would be!' The covering party ready at once, and offered without the asking:
  the splendid discipline of it all! For those men behind us would have died
  sooner than fire without the further orders. Mind you, sir, there are many
  other regiments the same, but 'tis unfair to my manner of thinking that
  anyone should say those Guards are for show alone. And I says, and I'd like
  to meet the man that would deny me, that the discipline in those fellows is
  simply amazing."</p>

  <p>"But where does the digging come in, Cassidy?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"'Tis another story, that, sir," he answered, "but 'tis all part of the
  same thing &mdash; the discipline. You'll mind, that when men have been
  fighting hard, or when they have been marching, and it is all over for the
  time, the first thought of those men is to lie down and go to sleep. They are
  done to the world, they are dead beat, and more often than not it is at
  night. I am speaking of the thing as it was some month or two ago. The men
  are there &mdash; the position is new &mdash; and they cannot see ten yards
  in front of them. There is no officer at hand, maybe, and they just lie down
  and go to sleep. Now, sir, that will not do at all. 'Tis fatal. The morning
  comes, and those coal boxes start again, and the men are in the open. Even if
  they are not hit, they get a bit jumpy in a manner of speaking, for those
  contraptions are ugly things to watch, bursting all round you. They get
  jumpy, I say, and perhaps one comes a bit nearer than the rest, and somebody
  mutters 'Let's hop it.' 'Tis not a thing which we would wish to speak of,
  sir, but you know as well as I that those things happen even in the finest
  army of the world. Had those same lads been made to dig themselves in &mdash;
  right in, not a blithering little hole scratched in the mud, but down four
  foot or more, when they got there the night previous, some of those things
  which I have seen, and of which same I would rather not speak, would not have
  happened at all. But 'tis discipline that is needed to make a man dig when he
  is beat to the world, and there is no regiment in the Army that has the
  Guards beat at it. Some are as good, but there is none that has them beat.
  Those fellows have not yet run, that I knows of: they have not budged one
  inch from the places where they were put, and there are regiments that cannot
  say that same. And I puts it down to the making the men dig themselves in, to
  a great extent &mdash; to the discipline that makes the man not skimp his
  work because the officer is not behind him with a stick. You will understand,
  sir, when I say run I do not mean that anyone has hopped it bad: at least,
  glory be, I have not seen that same. But 'tis just that hopping it for a
  quarter of a mile or so and losing the advantage that you had won overnight,
  for the want of the digging, that sometimes occurred, before the importance
  of that same digging was understood properly; and it's there those Guards
  were so good, and it's that which those fellows who are now training should
  have shooed into their heads."</p>

  <p>"I think that lesson has been well learned," I said as he stopped.</p>

  <p>"Sir," he answered seriously, "it cannot be learned too well, "for 'tis a
  matter of life and death."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5"></a>V. &mdash; A SUBALTERN OF THE GUARDS</h2>

  <p class="first">Slowly the car glided past Wellington Barracks, and as we
  passed one of the entrances three young officers came out.</p>

  <p>"Good lads they are," cried Cassidy, "with that swagger which is right and
  fitting. For as you know, sir, if there is one thing which the boys cannot
  abide, it is the officer who creeps about like a cheese mite. They have their
  faults, those lads, but they are faults on the right side. I mind me now of a
  story I heard out yonder. They'd suffered, those Guard regiments, lost
  something cruel, as you know; and the young gentlemen from home were coming
  out to replace the casualties. Well, as you can imagine, sir, 'tis an uneasy
  matter at times for a young lad, fresh to the game, to find himself with old
  soldiers who have him watched, to see what manner of lad he is when the
  Marias are about. And 'tis the fear of being afraid that makes their hands
  tremble a bit, and gives them a touch of sweat on the forehead though the day
  would kill a polar bear with the cold. 'Tis the fear of being afraid of which
  those lads are afraid. One of those young lads &mdash; a proper thoroughbred
  he was &mdash; came out, and found himself in a trench, with the lads with
  their eyes on him.</p>

  <p>"''Tis afraid they think me,' he says to himself. 'I'll show 'em, the
  blighters. So he stepped out of the trench, as pleasant as may be, as if to
  take the air. 'Come in, sir,' begs the sergeant &mdash; ''tis death outside.'
  'Seems quite a healthy sort of death, sergeant,' says he, as nice as you
  like, and as he was speaking he took it. Luckily for him 'twas only a flesh
  wound, in such a place that he could not sit down with ease. The men they
  roared with laughter, and the sergeant smiled; and at that moment along
  creeps the captain. ''Tis wounded I am, sir,' says the subaltern. 'Bad luck,'
  says the captain; 'and where have you taken it?' 'Where it will hinder the
  easy use of the firing step to sit on,' says the subaltern. 'And how the
  devil did you take it there?' says the captain. 'Was it out of the trench you
  were?' 'I was that,' he says &mdash; ' taking the air.' The captain looked at
  the sergeant and saw him smile, and the captain looked at the men and saw
  them with their hands to their mouths studying the view. 'You cannot with
  ease sit upon the step,' he said. 'Can you with ease accompany me a little
  distance down the trench? And you will come as well, sergeant,' he says, 'for
  I'm minded to discuss this question of taking the air.' When they were away
  from the men he said to the sergeant, 'Did you tell the officer the air was
  unhealthy a few feet higher up?' 'I did that, sir,' said the sergeant. ' All
  right,' he said, 'that will do.' The sergeant backed away a few paces, and
  then the captain started. 'Mr So-and-so,' he started &mdash; I misremember
  the gentleman's name &mdash; 'have you made any mistake? You aren't by any
  means under the delusion that you are out here to practise open-air pastoral
  dances, are you? You aren't qualifying for an instructor in Swedish exercises
  by any chance, are you?' 'No, sir,' said the little officer, looking all
  bewildered like. 'Then what the blazes do you mean by behaving like an organ
  grinder's monkey and getting out of that trench?' he roared. ''Twas to show
  them I was not afraid,' says the little 'un, standing bolt upright and
  looking him straight in the face. The captain's eyes they twinkled, and he
  looked away that the lad might not see; then he turned back. 'The officers in
  our regiment,' he said, 'are never afraid. Let us not be mistaken,' he said.
  'When you come to me as my subaltern, I want you alive and well. It is your
  job to keep yourself fit, and not get wounded. If I told you to lead the men
  over that ground there,' and he pointed to the German trenches, 'and you
  refused or hesitated, though 'twould be certain death you went to, I would
  blow your brains out if you could not blow them out yourself. But I did not
  tell you to give an imitation of a skirt dance at the Alhambra merely to show
  that you possessed what you should blow your brains out for if you didn't.
  It's taught you a lesson, my lad, and a damned good one. Take him away,' he
  said to the sergeant, 'and have it dressed. If he can't sit down, he must lie
  on his face.' The lad was nigh faint with the blood he had lost, but he stood
  up and he said, 'I'm sorry, sir: I was a fool.' 'You were, my lad,' said the
  captain; but as he went back to the trench past the sergeant, he said to him,
  'They're the sort of fool we can do with, though, aren't they?'</p>

  <p>"A thoroughbred lot they are," continued Cassidy, after a pause, "with
  their eyeglasses, and hair-oil, and the like. Hampers they have from the big
  shops, they tell me, with bottles of the stuff inside. And the talking of
  those same bottles reminds me of another story about those same Guards." He
  paused reminiscently as a huge and majestic policeman barred our way.</p>

  <p>"The lad in blue," he went on after a moment, "he over yonder hiding the
  'bus, is about the same size, from all I've heard, as one of the German
  officers that fell into the trenches the other night. They were our Guards in
  them, and if I am not mistaken the fat one was of the Prussian Guard. 'Twas
  in the days two months ago, when they were trying to break the line. They got
  right up to our trenches, the devils, and jumped in, and there was a grand
  box-up. The fat lad stood on the side before getting in, and the earth gave
  way, so he got in unexpected like, and fell upon one of the young officer
  gentlemen. Well, as was natural, there was a great box-up, and the fighting
  between the men was of a quality not often struck outside of Ireland. It went
  on for some minutes, but at last the Boches were all killed or prisoners,
  when they became aware of a terrible noise at the end of the trench. They
  looked, and the sergeant he said, 'Mother of Heaven! is it an elephant or a
  whale that we have?' for there was water in the trench, and as far as could
  be seen there was a huge fat thing wallowing in it, blowing like a porpoise.
  They could not see rightly what was happening, so they let him blow for a
  bit. Laughing they were, when he suddenly says, 'Shall we stop?' in English.
  'It's bored I'm getting, old dear,' said a voice from the region of his
  stomach. 'Glory be,' said the sergeant, 'the officer is underneath. Pull him
  off, boys.' When they had pulled him off, they dug the officer out of the
  mud. 'It's a prisoner I would be,' said the German. 'I am not liking the
  life.' 'It's a prisoner you are,' cried the officer, when he had taken the
  mud from his mouth; 'but it does not alter the fact that you have the last
  bottle of my Madeira smashed, and it's amputated my foot must be where you
  sat upon it. &mdash; Take him back out of the trench,' he said to the
  sergeant, 'with the other prisoners. His general appearance is beastly, and
  he has the rum spilt as well.'</p>

  <p>"'I'm doubting whether he will get down the communication trench, sir,'
  said the sergeant, 'for it's a large man he is, and the trenches are not yet
  widened.'</p>

  <p>"'Then roll the blighter along the top,' said he; 'but take him away, for
  I dislike him greatly.' "</p>

  <p>By devious routes we had now reached the Houses of Parliament, and were
  turning for home. My thoughts as to whether by any chance the arbiter of my
  fate and finances should be leaning gracefully from the window of my bank,
  and imagining that someone had given me a Rolls Royce, again become gracious
  as in the days of long ago, when once for over a week I was in credit, were
  interrupted by Cassidy's exclamation. The Guard was changing at the Horse
  Guards, and the usual crowd was watching. "'Tis great lads they are," he said
  &mdash; "great. They can march and they can fight. They can sit still in a
  trench, and they can charge, and there are few that are their equals."</p>

  <p>And then I left him, to squeeze another fiver out of that granite boulder
  &mdash; my bank account.</p>

  <h2><a id="story6"
     name="story6"></a>VI. &mdash; A WORD TO THE SHIRKERS<br>
  And &mdash; which is more &mdash; you'll be a man, my son. Kipling</h2>

  <p class="first">"It makes me sick, sir. I would like to take those
  cigarette-smoking, pigeon-chested malingerers and transport them out of the
  bars in which they make eyes at a fat woman they dare not kiss for fear she
  would be after smacking their faces, when they would run home and tell mother
  they were hurt. I would take them away from the football matches, where they
  scream insults at the referee, knowing he is too far away to hit them. I
  would take them away, with their dirty, wretched, contemptible little minds
  and bodies, and I would dump them straight into the trenches."</p>

  <p>A Saturday afternoon football crowd, getting into the Underground train in
  which Sergeant Michael Cassidy and I were returning from a visit to Wimbledon
  to celebrate his return to convalescence, had occasioned this outburst from
  my somewhat excitable comrade.</p>

  <p>"Look at that thing, sir," he said, indicating a vacuous youth opposite,
  with very tight trousers and very yellow boots. "What good does that fellow
  think he is to the country? It is not as if he were an ornament, for 'tis the
  most unhealthy-looking addition to the landscape I have seen since I was by
  the bedside of my mother's brother when he died and left the black heifer and
  six good laying hens to my cousin Shamus &mdash; the scheming
  blackguard."</p>

  <p>"Are you talking about me, my man?" demanded the youth at this moment,
  carefully shooting two purple cuffs and regarding my companion with a pale
  and watery eye.</p>

  <p>"I was," answered Cassidy &mdash; "I was." At that moment the train
  stopped, so his remarks were painfully audible. "I was wondering what it was
  that your father was after saying to your mother when he first saw you, or
  whether he was that type of cheese-mite that was unable to hope for anything
  better; and by the holy saints, if you speak to me as 'my man' again, you
  rat-faced cough drop, I will hang you out of them doors in the centre by your
  feet, saving only for the danger of your face causing uneasiness to the
  signalmen."</p>

  <p>A merciful influx of people interposed at this moment between Cassidy and
  the youth, who, with trembling hands, was endeavouring to open his cigarette
  case, while his eyes roved, like a frightened rabbit's, from Cassidy to the
  door and back again, as if fearing that at any moment the threat might be put
  into execution.</p>

  <p>"Can you picture that thing in the trenches?" said Cassidy, "at least that
  thing as he is now; for I have made men of worse than that. Can't you see it
  screaming and blubbering and begging the Boches to send their shells where
  they will not be after hurting the pride of the local picture palace? And
  them other things too sitting beside him and thinking they're men." His eye
  travelled impartially over the five youths sitting opposite him, whose
  agitation at last culminated in one of their number, with a pretty taste in
  mauve socks and yellow clocks, swallowing a large portion of his Woodbine.
  "They have not the virtues of men," he went on, "nor their vices neither.
  They can neither fight nor drink; they cannot hate nor love. They are beneath
  contempt entirely; and 'tis for them things, sir, that the men of the country
  is bleeding over yonder."</p>

  <p>"They're a sorry crowd, Cassidy, I admit," I answered, "but there's been a
  lot of harm done by lumping every one in the country who doesn't wear uniform
  into the same category of funks and shirkers." I had vivid recollections of
  the one and only time I had ventured to London in mufti, and the lady with a
  tomato and a bunch of grapes in her head-piece, who had presented me with a
  white feather in Piccadilly &mdash; but that is neither here nor there.</p>

  <p>"I would not be forgetting it either, sir," he remarked. "There are men,
  good men, who would be with us yonder if they could, only they are prevented
  by things they are unable to alter. 'Tis a bad heart they have, or short
  sight or the like. Of them I would say nothing. But 'tis of them blotchy
  apologies for men, them kinema creepers, them things that think they are men
  of the world, and can neither ride a horse nor shoot with a gun, who cannot
  make love to a woman nor stand up to a man &mdash; 'tis of them I would say a
  lot."</p>

  <p>I was glad to notice at this moment that Purple Cuffs' breathing was
  almost normal again.</p>

  <p>"I would take them five football shouters," he continued, "and I would
  heave them by their necks into a trench, where I would follow them to have
  the pleasure of showing them the sights. The trench would have the water
  standing in the bottom of it, and there would be a wind blowing that would
  cut through to their skins like a knife. And above the howling of the wind
  sweeping down the trenches and into the shelters it's another noise they
  would hear, which same they would not understand at the first &mdash; not
  having heard that noise before. They would stand huddled together &mdash; I
  see them in my mind &mdash; and then I would talk to them. 'You hear that
  noise?' I would say to them. ''Tis not the wind I mean, but that swishing
  noise passing over your heads. You hear that thudding in the earth in front,
  that moaning in the air? It is not football that they are playing now, my
  lads; you are not watching a game you cannot play yourselves, you are
  watching the game of death, and if you jump up now and abuse the referee you
  will not do it a second time. You are watching the game that others have been
  playing while you sat at home and played shove-halfpenny; you are watching
  the game of men with men, when you walk and you talk and you eat and sleep
  with death &mdash; and how do you like it?</p>

  <p>"'You see that flash down the trench there? You hear that roar? Just come
  with me, my five brave huddlers, just come with me and we will see what has
  happened down there beyond that traverse where we cannot see. Oh! 'tis quite
  safe if you duck your heads &mdash; them bullets will not hurt you. Come
  along, my heroes. 'Tis making you more uneasy than the picture palaces to
  represent a coal-box? 'Twas no paper bag that burst round the other side of
  that traverse. You have never seen a dead man, you say &mdash; you with the
  purple cuffs? Your face is white, is it &mdash; and your teeth is chattering
  &mdash; and your hands are wet with the sweat, for you can guess what you'll
  be after seeing on the other side, can you? You do not want to, you say, and
  there's sickness in your stomach and weakness in your knees, and you would
  sell your soul &mdash; if you're after having one at all &mdash; to be quit
  of that whiz overhead for a bit. But what of the others, my lads, what of all
  the other boys who are out here? What of the lads who have got a bit of earth
  over them, and the lads who haven't even got that, but are lying staring up
  at the sky with eyes that will not again look at a football match, though it
  was liking that game they were &mdash; same as you? Why should they be stiff
  and stark, my heroes? Why should they have run this risk &mdash;<i>for
  you</i>? Are you thinking they wanted to &mdash; but they did? And why are
  you not doing the same?</p>

  <p>"'And here we are at the traverse; and 'tis the other side we're after
  looking at. 'Twas there we saw that coal-box burst, wasn't it? You'll be
  stepping over the traverse where it's fallen down, Mr Purple Cuffs &mdash;
  ah! what is it that you're after stopping for? Step carefully and you will
  not touch him. But as you pass just look at his eyes. For why have you not
  been running the same risks as he has done? Why are you not standing in these
  trenches, with the sound of death in your ears, and the sight of death in
  your eyes, as a man should stand, if he would hold his head up and count
  himself a man? You might be hit yourself, you says &mdash; you might have
  your eyes fixed on them grey clouds with that fixed stare that does not see
  them scudding overhead; and that you would not like. Why, no, perhaps not
  &mdash; but are you thinking that he liked it any better? 'Tis not nice to
  die when there is so much one is after living for, but 'twas just the same
  with him at your feet. Why are you not doing the same?</p>

  <p>"'You will mind that thing you are treading into the slush there. Oh! yes,
  it is, my lad &mdash; it's a leg that is, and it's belonging to the little
  officer gentleman in the corner. You're looking at him, are you &mdash; and
  it's wanting to know where the other has gone, that you is? 'Tis little
  matter. The officer gentleman, though his eyes is closed, yet he will not
  open them again, for his legs is gone and his chest as well. And he has been
  out here, while you &mdash; what have you been after doing, you five? Why
  should that little officer gentleman, who was what you will never be &mdash;
  a man &mdash; who played the games you could only look on at &mdash; why
  should he have done this thing <i>for you</i>? He was paid for it, you says
  &mdash; 'twas his job &mdash; 'twas bad luck. Will the pay he got give him
  back his legs and his chest, you worms? And was it his job to defend
  <i>you</i>? Can you not defend yourselves? 'Twas his job to defend them that
  is unable to do that same &mdash; the women, the children, the invalids. Is
  it an invalid you are? It is not, you say; then why are you not doing your
  job and standing beside that officer gentleman? Is it, my lads &mdash; now
  I'm asking you &mdash; is it that you are afraid? You are not, you say; but
  did a man ask me that question, 'tis not so I would answer him. I would have
  my hands on his throat, and it is not repeating it he would be. And I still
  wish to know why you are not standing beside the little officer.</p>

  <p>"'And here is another in the same trench, and it's alive that he is. Give
  me a hand, ye dogs, give me a hand to make him easier, for it is not long
  that he has left. He will not again see England &mdash; nor a picture palace,
  nor any of the things he liked &mdash; same as you like them; it is no
  difference at all that there is between you, saving only that he is a man and
  you are not. 'Tis a girl's name he'll be trying to say, if he can speak for
  the blood that is in his throat. Loosen his collar, Purple Cuffs, for it's a
  little comfort it will give him, or do you shrink from the touching of that
  wound? And yet this same lad got that wound for you. Why are you not here
  with him? Why should he be dying, while you creep about at home in safety,
  for you are not an invalid, you say, and you are not a coward &mdash; and
  it's asking you why, that I am; and you are unable to answer me. I mistrust
  them that cannot answer a plain question. Is it that the work you are doing
  at home here is important to the country, and must be done? Then I have no
  more to say. But what is your age, ye tight-trousered thing, and what do you
  do? You are twenty-four, you say, and you work in a shop, selling stockings
  and the like to the ladies. 'Tis clear you cannot be spared, is it? You dirty
  little beast, is there not a woman who can do that same job? Is it a man's
  work to sell the chemises at such a time?</p>

  <p>"'And you with the mauve socks next door &mdash; what is you doing? In an
  office, you says, and afraid of losing your job. There are many jobs, my lad,
  which will be going to spare when this show is through; and even if there are
  not, why should I fight to keep you in a job? Does you really think you are
  worth it, you worm, you? You are doing nothing for England at all, and the
  men of the country are bleeding to death for you, and your chemises, and your
  halfpenny nap in the back office. Mother of God! you makes me sick!' "</p>

  <p>The train came to a grinding stop, and the five youths who had been the
  subject of Cassidy's diatribe rose and majestically walked to the door, each
  in turn throwing a withering and scornful glance at my companion, who watched
  them with interest. "I would not be surprised if they did not make faces at
  us through the window," he remarked as the door closed on the last of them,
  "for he did not appreciate my remarks about the signalmen, I'm after
  thinking. Ah! but 'tis cruel, sir," he said, turning to me. "'Tis cruel to
  think of them pimply little beasts creeping about the country, and then
  remember what the lads are doing over the water. To think that Mr O'Rourke
  gave his life for such as them. Did you hear the story, sir?" as the train
  drew up at my station. "Come round tomorrow and I will tell it you, for it
  bears the telling."</p>

  <p>"I will, Cassidy," I said. "Good night."</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>I reached my club, and picked up the evening paper. "Desperate Fighting
  at&mdash;"</p>

  <p>What was it Kipling said in those immortal lines:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,<br>
  Yours is the earth and everything that's in it,<br>
  And &mdash; which is more &mdash; you'll be a man, my son.</p><br>

  <p>This chapter was written in January 1915. Since then many of those who
  hung back have crossed the Vale.</p>

  <p>But there are still men who wear, for reasons best known to themselves,
  glasses of blue and yellow; there are still men who &mdash; though of
  fighting age and fit &mdash; have joined home defence units; there are still
  men who, robed in khaki, out in France &mdash; also of fighting age and fit
  &mdash; drive motor-cars at bases, and specialise in cocktails.</p>

  <p>No one can sort out the sheep from the goats; they, and they alone, know.
  But in the days to come, when they are called on to give an account of their
  manhood, it may be they will regret with tears of blood.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="story7"
     name="story7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE BRIDGE<br>
  An Incident During the Retreat</h2>

  <p class="first">"I have been wondering, sir," remarked Cassidy to me the
  next day, "whether we were not perhaps a little hard on those five boys
  yesterday, that we saw in the train."</p>

  <p>I had strolled round in the afternoon to hear from him the story of Dennis
  O'Rourke, and what had happened at the Bridge.</p>

  <p>"It is not maybe that they are afraid, sir," he went on, "for I'm thinking
  that if they were, they would be far more frightened of saying so, but it is
  that they do not realise; and 'tis hard to see how they can, for it has not
  been brought home to them &mdash; none of those little things that one sees,
  which serve to make one understand what it means.</p>

  <p>"I remember one day &mdash; 'twas in the early stages when we were drawing
  them after us into France. 'Twas hot &mdash; hot as the devil &mdash; and
  towards the evening I was riding quiet like, along a nice shady road, for all
  the world as it might have been a lane in England. For the time there was but
  little noise of firing at all &mdash; 'twas just a bit of a lull &mdash; but
  we had seen them, and we knew they were coming, coming in motor-'buses, and
  the saints know what else; in thousands and thousands they were pouring along
  after us, though at the time we did not know 'twas as bad as it was. Oh!
  'twas cruel; but as I say, I was away on my own &mdash; the sappers mostly
  were those days, being split up for the different jobs &mdash; and as I rode
  along the road I saw a lad leaning over the hedge sucking a straw. Away back
  behind him was a great house and stables, and I said to him, I said, "'Bong
  soir,' I said.</p>

  <p>"'Cheese it,' he answers. 'Who are you bong-soiring?'</p>

  <p>"When I heard him talking plain like that, I pulled up and looked at him.
  'I thought you were a Frenchie,' I said to him, 'till you opened your beer
  trap. Do you grow here, or are you touring the country for fun?'</p>

  <p>"'I ride for the stable up yonder,' he said, pointing with his thumb.</p>

  <p>"'Bedad!' I said, ''tis a training stable you have,' for it had not struck
  me they had those things in France at all.</p>

  <p>"'Did you think it was a potted meat factory?' he said.</p>

  <p>"'I did not,' I said; 'but unless you hop it pretty quickly it precious
  soon will be.'</p>

  <p>"'What are you meaning?' said the trainer, who had come out and overheard
  what I said.</p>

  <p>"'Unless you and your horses and your lads hop it smartly,' I said to him,
  'it's hopping in another direction you'll be before the morning, for by that
  time the Germans will be upon you.'</p>

  <p>"'Are you sure?' he said, 'for I have some valuable horses with me, and I
  would not lose them.'</p>

  <p>"'Am I sure?' said I. 'Would I be riding for three days without ceasing,
  with a thirst like the morning after, if I were not sure?'</p>

  <p>"'What will I do?' he said, 'for 'tis the first I have heard of it.'</p>

  <p>"'Do!' I said. 'The first thing you will do is to give me a drink, and my
  horse as well, and then you will gather your lads and you will ride south,
  and you will not stop riding for a week or so; for if you do not, 'tis little
  riding you'll any of you do again.'</p>

  <p>"When he saw I was in earnest 'twas a terrible blather he got into, and
  the last I saw of him he was riding into the dusk with his boys behind him
  and his stud of twelve horses, while the old woman who cleaned his house was
  hopping along beside him in the road, hanging on to his stirrup leather
  &mdash; and she a martyr to the indigestion as one of the lads told me. I
  know not what happened to him, but the next morning I saw his house fired,
  and 'twas a mercy I had the whisky removed. 'Tis the little things like that
  that make the people realise what war is; and we have not had the like in
  England at all, and it perhaps would be a good thing if we had, I'm after
  thinking."</p>

  <p>He paused to light another of my cigarettes.</p>

  <p>"But it was of Mr O'Rourke I would tell you, sir," he went on. "'Twas the
  morning after the little affair of which I have just told you, that we
  received the orders to go at once to a bridge nearby and have it prepared for
  the demolition. Mr O'Rourke was in charge, and I was with him, and we had
  about a dozen of the lads. When we got there we found 'twas a big one over a
  river &mdash; a sort of suspension bridge, and 'twas evidently an important
  one. 'Twas another scorching day, and Mr O'Rourke he says, 'Let's get it
  fixed up quick, boys,' he says, 'and it's a bathe we can have.' Well, there
  is not the necessity for me to tell you the details of the fixing &mdash; of
  how we placed the gun-cotton on the cables, and the leads were running to the
  exploder hidden behind a tree on our own side. We tested it all, and we had
  the bit of fuse and another detonator fixed up in case of any failure in the
  electricity. When we had it done, some of the lads had a bathe, and we lay in
  the shade of a few trees, most of us fast asleep &mdash; for you will mind
  that our orders were only to prepare it for the demolition, and not actually
  to blow it up. 'Twas still &mdash; 'twas just peace: the heat haze shimmering
  in the blue, and the buzz of the little flies and things, to send one to
  sleep, for we were well behind our own men. Two hours later &mdash; well, we
  will come to that, sir, but it will give you an idea of how those fellows
  came on. It seemed as if we had been there but a minute, but maybe it was
  half an hour, when with a crash one of the Horse Batteries galloped over the
  bridge. The dust rose in great choking clouds, and through it we could see
  the drivers &mdash; their collars open, their faces grey with it, some with
  hats and some without, themselves sitting down and riding like men possessed,
  while their horses sweated and galloped and the guns swayed behind. In a
  second they were gone, and only the dust remained.</p>

  <p>"Mr O'Rourke he turned to me and he said, 'They were going fast even for
  the Horse,' he said, 'along a road; and I would to Heaven it had been the
  other way they were galloping,' for I should tell you, sir, they were going
  south. Five minutes later we heard them come into action a quarter of a mile
  behind us. 'Covering the retreat again,' he muttered; and barely had he
  spoken when an Infantry regiment came in sight &mdash; going the same way. Mr
  O'Rourke and I we went into the centre of the bridge to keep our eye on the
  charge, and we watched them come by. Walking dogged they were, with a fixed
  sort of stare, and some were asleep as they marched, and some were whistling
  through lips that made no noise. The sweat was caked on them, and they were
  grey from head to foot, and the officers were staggering up and down cheering
  them on &mdash; for those lads had been going without rest at all for ten
  days and more. And one of the sergeants said to me as he went by, he said,
  'There are thousands of them, and they're close behind.' When they had gone I
  went to Mr O'Rourke and I said to him, 'It's close work it's going to be,
  sir, I'm thinking, for they are near behind.'</p>

  <p>"And then up galloped a staff officer.</p>

  <p>"'Are you the Engineer officer in charge?' he said.</p>

  <p>"'I am that,' said Mr O'Rourke.</p>

  <p>"'There are still two squadrons of Lancers between you and the Germans,'
  he said, 'and they will be across soon, for they are only covering the
  Infantry who have just gone over. When they are over blow up the bridge, and
  do not linger to admire the view, for it will be unhealthy.'</p>

  <p>"'Very good, sir,' says Mr O'Rourke.</p>

  <p>"'And,' says he, 'let there be no mistake, for the love of Heaven; for
  should the charge fail we are undone. This bridge is the most important of
  any there are to be destroyed, and they must not get it.'</p>

  <p>"'They will not get it,' says Mr O'Rourke; and with that he galloped away.
  When he had gone we walked off the bridge. 'Pray Heaven, Cassidy,' he said,
  'that all is well, for we will not have much time, if there is a fault, to
  adjust it.'</p>

  <p>"'It will be all right, sir,' said I, 'for we have it tested.'</p>

  <p>"And then the Cavalry started coming back.</p>

  <p>"'Clear out, you boys,' shouted an officer; 'they are in touch with us,
  and we cannot hold them longer.'</p>

  <p>"'Cassidy,' said Mr O'Rourke, 'take the men back, for it is no good them
  stopping here.'</p>

  <p>"'Would we be leaving you, sir?' I cried.</p>

  <p>"'You would not,' he said; 'but what good can you do? for if the charge
  fails there will be no time to relay it, and if it succeeds 'twill be easier
  for me to get away alone than if you are all here.'</p>

  <p>"I saw his point, and I knew he was right &mdash; though it went against
  the grain to leave him in the lurch, as it were. But he would not alter, and
  so I took them away &mdash; muttering and cursing they were. I took them to a
  little rise under cover two or three hundred yards away, where it was easy to
  clear from when the bridge was down without being fired on. Before I went I
  said to him, I said, 'We will be yonder, and it's there we will wait for you.
  If you go that way round you can get there easily.' Just after we got there
  we saw a major gallop over the bridge with his orderly behind him, and he
  shouted something to Mr O'Rourke. We saw him running to the exploder and
  fixing the leads, and then he paused and straightened himself up behind the
  tree. From where we were we could see two Uhlans coming near the bridge, with
  more of them, hundreds of them, behind. And then he forced down the handle of
  the exploder. 'Mother of Heaven!' I screamed, for nothing happened. He did it
  again, and it failed again. You will mind, sir, that from where he was he
  could not see the Uhlan and they could not see him &mdash; but we could see
  both of them from the rise. The men were sobbing and cursing. A corporal
  caught my arm, and he muttered, 'It was not to fail,' he said, 'and it has.
  What will we do?' 'What can we?' I said, 'for they are on the bridge.' And
  then of a sudden we saw the lad creeping along under cover of the trees, and
  he reached the bridge and ran like a hare to the charge. The Uhlans saw him
  too, and rode at him; and the men started screaming and cheering, for they
  were off their heads, and they thought he would be able to do something. 'But
  what can he do?' I groaned, 'for the fuse will not burn quick enough. They
  are too close.' He reached the charge first, and his revolver was drawn. It
  was drawn, I say, but it was not at the Uhlans it pointed. For a second he
  stood there, with his head thrown back, and it seemed to us as if he laughed
  at them. And the lads saw what was in his mind, and they were silent &mdash;
  saving only one, and he threw himself on the ground sobbing. And the Uhlans
  saw what was in his mind, and one pulled his horse over backwards trying to
  get off the bridge, while the other rode at him. And then he fired. From the
  range of an inch he fired into the gun-cotton, and the roar of the detonation
  shook the heaven. And he and the Uhlans disappeared. They were there one
  minute and the next they were not. And then, with a great sort of rending
  crash, the whole thing fell into the river below.</p>

  <p>"We looked for a moment and then we stumbled away &mdash; and the most of
  us could not see with ease, for the lads had loved him well."</p>

  <p>Cassidy paused and looked into the fire. "So it was not a failure," I said
  softly as I left him.</p>

  <h2><a id="story8"
     name="story8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE CHARGE OF THE COOKS<br>
  Zillebeeke, November 1914</h2>

  <p class="first">"I wonder if by chance you recall the fat lad that was cook
  for the officers' mess when we used to go on the manoeuvres in England,"
  remarked Cassidy to me one day. We were strolling slowly through the Park,
  getting his foot into work again; but scenting one of his more expansive
  moments, I suggested a seat.</p>

  <p>"A great lad he was," he went on when we had made ourselves comfortable,
  "and it was cook he was for the officers over yonder. You recall his name,
  sir &mdash; Michael M'Doolan. 'Tis true that he was not the equal of a French
  chef, but he was a worthy lad to work under our doctor, of which same
  gentleman and his way with the people I have already told you. Of course you
  will understand, sir, that before we came into the billets, and whenever we
  are fighting, the doctor has no time to do anything but his job, and so 'tis
  the cook who does what he can for the officers, such as milking any cow the
  owner has forgotten about, or the like.</p>

  <p>"I remember one day &mdash; we had come up to where we are now, sir
  &mdash; it being a day in November, and we were all working pretty hard just
  then. You'll mind, sir, our hours are different to the others, for we are on
  always, and we never know when we shall be wanted or where we have to go. The
  officers all go out each night with parties of men and work in front of the
  trenches and on the different jobs, and come back in the morning &mdash; when
  they want a bit of food before they go to sleep. 'Tis the same with the men.
  They all come back into the farm or the dug-out behind the firing-line, where
  they get a chance of lying up during the day.</p>

  <p>"In the place where we were then the officers were in a farm. 'Twas a bit
  draughty, as there was more hole than wall, owing to the shells, and it was
  not over-distant from the firing-line itself, but hidden from it by a little
  hill. On the day I speak of I was walking from my own bit of a pigsty to
  their farm, when I felt the zip of a bullet as it went past my head. Thinks I
  to myself, 'That was as close as was convenient,' when another one zips past
  too. I was taking no risks, so I jumped into the ditch, the better to think.
  'If there is not a blackguard drawing on me,' I says to myself, 'may I never
  again see Ballygoyle; but where is it that he is, for it is not in the
  firing-line that he can be?' seeing, as I have told you, we were hidden from
  it by a hill. I crept along the ditch to the officers' farm, and there I
  finds M'Doolan. The officers and men were all out, but he was not alone, for
  there were gathered with him behind the wall of the farm the four other cooks
  for the mess.</p>

  <p>"'What the devil are you all doing here?' I said, as I got out of the
  ditch. 'Is it a mothers' meeting that it is, or why are you not at the
  dinners?'</p>

  <p>"'Do you see the farm yonder?' says M'Doolan, pointing to one we could
  just see.</p>

  <p>"'I do,' says I, following his finger.</p>

  <p>"'They have us marked from there,' he says. 'There are three of them, I
  think, and it's sniping us they've been for the last two hours.'</p>

  <p>"''Twas from there, was it,' I says, 'that it came?' and I looked through
  a hole at the farm.</p>

  <p>"'Have they been at you, Sergeant?' they says.</p>

  <p>"'Why else would I be in the ditch?' says I. 'I am not after training as a
  Boy Scout.'</p>

  <p>"At that moment there came another shot. There was a terrible 'cluck,' and
  all was still. M'Doolan, he jumped up and rushed out before we could stop
  him, shouting, 'The devils, the devils!' at the top of his voice.</p>

  <p>"'Come back, you fool,' I cried, and went out and pulled him in. I pulled
  him in, I say, but he was peering through the different holes in the wall
  like a man possessed.</p>

  <p>"'Was it a cluck I heard behind there?' he says &mdash; in a terrible way
  he was &mdash; 'was it a cluck, for if so 'twas Rosie.'</p>

  <p>"'Rosie,' I says, 'what are you talking about, and who's your Rosie at
  all?'</p>

  <p>"'It was,' he cries, peering through one of the holes, 'for I can see her
  &mdash; and it's dead she is.'</p>

  <p>"I looked out and I saw a hen lying in the corner with most of its
  feathers off, and she certainly did not look very lively."</p>

  <p>"''Tis only a hen,' I cried in disgust. 'Away with you and your
  Rosie.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis not that,' he says; ''tis the Major. 'Tis terrible particular he is
  about getting his egg in the morning when he comes in, and when we comes here
  a week ago I found little Rosie. She was the only one left, and saving only
  that an ammunition wagon passed over her the day before yesterday she has
  been doing well. Oh! 'tis a terrible thing she has passed away, Sergeant.</p>

  <p>"'Why, only this morning she failed to do her duty, and when I went out
  there was nothing. The Major he says, "M'Doolan," he says, "where the deuce
  is the Hen Fruit? Hen fruit, you fool!" he cries, irritable-like, when I
  looks at him puzzled, "produce of the feathered biped &mdash; egg?"'</p>

  <p>"'She has misfired, sir,' I says. ''Tis either the wagon which passed over
  her two days ago, or else the round of ammunition she ate yesterday &mdash;
  but she is looking unwell.'</p>

  <p>"' "Well, put her in a corner and sing to her this morning," he says, "and
  she'll either lay an egg or the bullet &mdash; but for Heaven's sake get hold
  of eggs somehow."</p>

  <p>"'Well, I was doing my best. I had her in the corner over there, and it
  was hypnotising her I was. She was standing on one leg, and something was
  happening. I was clucking to her, when a bullet went between my legs from
  that same devil yonder. So I hopped it, but little Rosie stayed on, for I
  watched her, and 'tis an egg she would have laid before evening, for it was
  in earnest she was. And now what will I be after saying to the Major about it
  at all?'</p>

  <p>"''Tis rot you're talking,' I says. 'If the hen has been shot &mdash; and,
  bedad, after it had been run over by a wagon, and had eaten a round of
  ammunition, and had been looked at by you close, 'twas a merciful end for the
  poor bird &mdash; why are you five great hulking blatherers here? Away with
  you, and capture the house and the snipers. Are not five Sappers enough to do
  it, even if they are cooks?'</p>

  <p>"'Less of your even and your cooks, Sergeant,' says one. 'We will do it at
  once.'</p>

  <p>"Bedad! sir," laughed Cassidy, "you'd have laughed to see those five.
  M'Doolan elected himself the commander, and off they went up the ditch in
  great style, for all the world like a herd of hippopotamuses going to water.
  I followed them to see the fun. When they came to the end of the ditch they
  were still about two hundred yards from the house where they were. You'll
  mind, sir, the line was a bit mixed up just there, and there were a lot of
  the German snipers behind our own lines and all over the place. M'Doolan in a
  voice like a foghorn, gathered them together behind a refuse-heap and
  explained the situation.</p>

  <p>"'Two of you,' he says, 'will fire at the devils from here, to keep them
  engaged like, while we three will go round the back and rush them,' and away
  they crept. The two that were left behind were not in a manner of speaking
  marksmen, but as they had not fired a shot since the beginning they were all
  over it. They plastered the house and the ground and the refuse-heap they
  were lying behind with bullets, and one of them struck a cow in the next
  field &mdash; leastways with a bellow of pain she disappeared towards the
  trenches.</p>

  <p>"But the diversion served, for the snipers had all their attention on the
  refuse-heap, and M'Doolan and his two warriors reached the back unobserved.
  They crept up the stairs, and M'Doolan had his gun in one hand and Rosie in
  the other, for he was minded she should revenge herself. There were only two
  of them there, and they were occupied, as I have said, with the two outside.
  They crept into the room, and then with a whoop they were on them. M'Doolan
  tackled one. He hit him in the stomach with his rifle and in the face with
  Rosie, so that he dropped his gun and started praying. The other two had not
  their rifles, but one of them hit the second German over the head with a
  bottle of curry powder, while the other collared him by the legs. The first
  of them was trying to get Rosie's foot out of his mouth, and the other was
  sneezing curry when I got there; and it was a great diversion, for M'Doolan
  was taking no risks, and he still had them covered with his gun, while the
  other two were trying to gather up what was left of the curry powder.</p>

  <p>"'Murderers!' roars M'Doolan, brandishing Rosie in front of them, 'could
  you not have let her be while she laid her last egg? You Huths, you Gons!' he
  says, getting a trifle mixed. ''Tis my prisoners you are.' With that he
  seized them both, and when the other two had taken their guns he marched them
  out. 'Twas a great procession. We went down the road with the Germans in
  front, the one plucking curry powder from his mouth and the other feathers.
  The first man we ran into was the Major.</p>

  <p>"'What the devil is this!' he cries, putting up his eyeglass.</p>

  <p>"'We have avenged the death of Rosie, sir,' says M'Doolan, holding up the
  hen. 'Those two devils slaughtered her as she was getting ready to lay the
  egg for your breakfast tomorrow.'</p>

  <p>"'Great Scott!' says he, 'let's hear about it.'</p>

  <p>"So M'Doolan told him the story. When he had finished the Major looked at
  him and then he looked at the Germans. One had still got his teeth full of
  feathers and the other was covered with a sort of yellow foam. Lastly he
  looked at the hen, and then he laughed.</p>

  <p>"'Take 'em away,' he says to me; 'take 'em away, and send 'em to
  headquarters with my compliments.'</p>

  <p>"'But Rosie, sir,' says M'Doolan. 'Is it roast or boiled you will have
  her?'</p>

  <p>"The Major he looks at M'Doolan and laughs again. ''Tis a second Napoleon
  you are, M'Doolan,' he says, 'and it is well you have done to capture them
  two; but with regard to your cooking, do which you like, for we will not know
  the difference.' "</p>

  <h2><a id="story9"
     name="story9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE SPY<br>
  November 1914, near Messines</h2>

  <p class="first">"It seems strange," I remarked one morning to Sergeant
  Cassidy, as we sat together in the Park, whither he had hobbled on his
  crutches, "that those fellows run their spy system so well. Why aren't they
  spotted more easily?" Only that morning I had been reading in the paper of a
  German officer who had spent some four or five days behind the British lines,
  his identity only being suspected when he was back safely behind his own
  again.</p>

  <p>"Maybe, sir, maybe," answered my guide and counsellor. "But 'tis not so
  strange after all, when you come to think of it. For when a man dressed as a
  French officer comes behind the English lines, and another dressed as an
  English officer is himself behind the French, 'tis hard to tell where you
  are. For our knowledge of the language is not all it might be, and 'tis hard
  to tell if it's a German talking English or a Frenchman &mdash; even for the
  officers."</p>

  <p>Reluctantly I was compelled to admit that my gardener's unhealthy wish for
  pens, ink, and paper, and my aunt's notorious predilection for cheese in all
  forms &mdash; the only blot on our otherwise stainless escutcheon &mdash;
  which in the days of my youth I had so frequently translated into perfect
  French, had not fitted me for the onerous task of spy-hunting behind the
  lines.</p>

  <p>"But, bedad, it's right that you are, sir," continued Cassidy, when he had
  temporarily taken over my cigarette case. "They are extraordinary &mdash; the
  way they send men behind our lines and find things out, and no one can deny
  that those same men are full of pluck. For they know the penalty when they
  are found out &mdash; and there is not much glory over their work at all.
  They do what our own officers would not like the doing of, because they would
  be after thinking it was dirty work.</p>

  <p>"I mind me once when we caught one of them at it. 'Twas more by luck than
  anything else that we did that same, but 'tis a story that bears the
  telling."</p>

  <p>A temporary lull occurred at that moment, owing to the excitement of his
  catching what I believe is known as the "glad-eye" from a passing fairy, and
  very nearly slipping off the seat. When he had waved his crutch twice, and
  comparative calm again reigned, I ventured to recall the great man to the
  affairs of earth.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about the spy, Cassidy," I said firmly.</p>

  <p>"What a peach!" he murmured. "Begorrah &mdash; a darling; and 'tis Irish
  she was with her eyes." He sighed deeply. "But 'tis of the spy you would be
  hearing, sir. For the proper understanding of what I would be telling you, it
  is clear you must know how the firing line is at the present moment &mdash;
  and what the lads are after doing. You will mind that there are farmhouses
  &mdash; dotted they are all over the place &mdash; and barns and old mills
  and the like. Those same barns were occupied by the Germans in most cases
  before they were taken over by us as we pushed them back. Of course, as you
  know, they have not moved at all lately, but I am speaking of maybe two or
  three months ago. What was easier than for those fellows to leave a stray man
  or two behind them who was able to talk the English or French, and put a
  telephone or the like in one of those same barns which was connected with
  their own lines, and where they knew they would be?</p>

  <p>"You will mind also that the lingo they speak up in the North, where they
  are now, has a heathenish sound to it, and a man might be a German or a Jew
  from Patagonia before one was the wiser for it. And there is another thing
  too, sir, that you must be after bearing in mind, and that is the importance
  of this same spying. For with the aeroplanes and the like, 'tis impossible to
  move the lads during the day, as it is seen they would be, and any big
  massing of them is bound to be known. So 'tis at night that the moves are
  done, and 'tis then that these fellows come in. For you will mind that, with
  the line as it is, if maybe a bit of a hill like is captured &mdash; though
  it may only be an advance of a few hundred feet &mdash; yet the new position
  may enfilade their line, and when the guns are brought up may cause them
  great uneasiness for two or three miles. Then maybe the winning of that
  little bit of ground may allow our lads to get the range of a railway they
  are using, or the like. So you will see, sir, that those little advances are
  much more important than they would appear in the papers; but the success of
  them depends on secrecy, and if 'tis given away beforehand by a spy, the lads
  have no chance.</p>

  <p>"We were in a farm at the time. 'Twas a funny old bird that had that same
  farm, all screwed up and wizened like. The boys called him Gilbert the
  Filbert &mdash; and his appearance was like to a monkey that had not washed
  for months. It was all alone in the farm he was, so the interpreter told me
  &mdash; you mind that all our regiments and batteries yonder have a French
  interpreter with them &mdash; and his wife had died of the shock when the
  Germans had been in the farm.</p>

  <p>"I says to him, I says when he told me, 'By the Holy Saints,' I says, 'if
  the old lady's face was like most of those I've seen creeping about round
  here, 'twas probably a heavy casualty list those Boches had themselves when
  they see her.'</p>

  <p>"We never saw him most of the day. Down in the café he was, they said
  &mdash; or rather 'estaminet,' as they call 'pubs' in those parts &mdash;
  drinking to drown his grief. The old devil! 'Twas great the way he had us
  boiled. Well, one morning the General he comes round to the farm, and his
  staff with him. I misremember what actually he had come for; 'twas an
  inspection or something, but 'tis of no account. When 'twas all over the
  officer gentlemen were sitting in the farm having a bit of lunch, and from
  what Mr Tracey told me after, the General was talking a bit open like about
  the intentions of the big guns, and what they were going to do. Nothing much,
  you mind me, but things it would be inconvenient for them German lads to
  know. Now, in that farm we were in then there was a cellar &mdash; they have
  them in many of them &mdash; where they keep the beer and the like."</p>

  <p>Cassidy paused a moment and laid his hand on my arm. "While I think of it,
  sir," he said impressively, "when you get there, be careful of that same beer
  &mdash; for 'tis cold on the stomach it lies, and there is but little warmth
  in it."</p>

  <p>I duly noted the fact, for when an expert speaks it behoves all who can to
  read, mark, learn and inwardly digest.</p>

  <p>"As I was after saying," he went on, after a short but solemn pause,
  "there was a cellar in this same farm, and one way of reaching it was from
  the room where the officers were sitting. As luck would have it, the lad who
  was the cook &mdash; that same M'Doolan of whom I have already told you
  &mdash; had run short of milk, and the officers were thinking a little hot
  milk and rum would be good for their health. The Doctor &mdash; the lad that
  had the way with him &mdash; was a great believer in it as a medicine, and
  the Major, I am told, did not disagree with him on the matter. So M'Doolan
  was in a great way, for the General was minded to try it, and devil a drop of
  the cow oil was there. He was shouting for Gilbert, and making a noise he
  said was like a cow, for not a word of the lingo could he speak. 'Twas a
  terrible commotion, and when he came outside to find the old man, making this
  noise, we thought the ration lorry was upset.</p>

  <p>"''Tis not another drop the old cow will lay if she hears you,' I
  says.</p>

  <p>"'I cannot find Gilbert,' says he, 'and the General is dying of thirst and
  the cold.'</p>

  <p>"Away he goes, and for some reason he went into the cellar, for there was
  another way in besides the one I have told you of. He gets in, and, bedad, he
  had not been gone a minute before there was a noise like a Black Maria
  inside.</p>

  <p>"''Tis the cow,' I cried. 'He has her caught, and it's milking her he
  is.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis not,' he cries. ''Tis Gilbert, and 'tis a spy he is, the dirty
  devil.' And with that be comes up with the old farmer man. He had him by the
  back of the neck, and his clasp knife was in his other hand, to make him move
  the faster. 'I found him,' he says, 'with his ear at the door of the
  officers' room, and 'tis listening he was to the General.'</p>

  <p>"And then, as you may think, there was the devil and all. The lads came
  running, and the officers appeared, and the General, wiping his moustache,
  for without the necessary milk they had been drinking it neat.</p>

  <p>"'What is it at all?' he says, 'and why is there all this commotion?'</p>

  <p>"''Tis a spy, sir,' says M'Doolan, 'and it's his ear he had to the door
  when I caught him.'</p>

  <p>"And then a change came over them all, and they became very silent. The
  Major puts in his eyeglass and looks at the men. 'You may dismiss,' says he,
  quiet like, and they dismissed. The General he looked at the farmer, and then
  he turned to the Major.</p>

  <p>"'Is this the source,' says he, 'of the leakage of information?' For I may
  tell you, sir, that though at the time I did not know of that same &mdash; Mr
  Tracey, he told me after &mdash; there had been a great leakage, and the
  reason had them all beat. 'What have you to say?' he says, and he turned to
  the farmer.</p>

  <p>"The farmer he stood there, sullen like, for it was afraid to move he was,
  seeing that M'Doolan's clasp knife was touching his neck.</p>

  <p>"'<i>Comprends pas</i>,' he says, or some such words, though not knowing
  the language I could not say exact like.</p>

  <p>"'Go down, Tracey,' says the Major, 'and search the cellar'; and Mr Tracey
  he went off. While he was away we were all silent, and the General's face was
  stern, for we knew without the searching. In a few minutes Mr Tracey came
  back, and in his hand he held a telephone.</p>

  <p>"''Twas under the sacks, sir,' he says to the General. 'I cut the leads
  and here it is.'</p>

  <p>"The General looked at the telephone, and then at the farmer. 'What have
  you to say?' he says, and his voice was terrible to hear.</p>

  <p>"I was watching the farmer, and 'twas a strange sight, for on the sudden
  he seemed to change. He realised 'twas the end, and he straightened himself
  up. 'Twas acting he'd been, and he was not an old man at all. He brought his
  heels together and stood to attention, giving him look for look.</p>

  <p>"'Nothing,' he says.</p>

  <p>"'You know the penalty?' says the General.</p>

  <p>"'I do,' he says, and he did not falter.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it was the change in him, but the Brigade Major he gives a
  start and then he looks at him close. 'Good God!' he says, 'were you not
  shooting with Lord&mdash;?' &mdash; he mentioned one of the quality &mdash;
  'were you not shooting with him last year?'</p>

  <p>"'I was, Major Drayton,' says he, and his voice was cold.</p>

  <p>"Major Drayton turns away, and his mouth was sneering, for he liked not
  finding him a spy.</p>

  <p>"'Is there any letter you wish to write?' says the General. 'I will send
  it for you when I have read it.'</p>

  <p>"'There is not,' he says, still standing stiff and rigid like.</p>

  <p>"'Is there anything you would wish to say?' says the General.</p>

  <p>"'One thing, and one thing only,' says he, and his voice rang out clear
  and loud. I remember it well, for the lads were looking from the barn to see
  what was occurring. 'We have different ideas,' he says, 'you and I. There are
  thousands of us doing this &mdash; glorying in it &mdash; for 'tis the work
  of a man. I am of the Prussian Army, and I tell you that your day is over.
  For you English your star is setting &mdash; you have ceased to be a great
  nation &mdash; you are on the wane. What matter my death? There are others.
  For years we have prepared, we have made ready, we have waited &mdash; and
  now your hour has come. It is <i>der Tag</i>,' and he raised his hand above
  his head.</p>

  <p>"Everyone was silent, and the General was silent too, for the man was
  terribly in earnest. At last the General spoke, and his voice was not
  terrible any more. 'We will not argue the matter,' he said. 'As you say, we
  see things differently. Perhaps in time you and your nation will find that
  you have made a terrible mistake, and that the star of England has not set,
  but is blazing fiercer than ever.' And then he paused, and the officers round
  stood stiffly &mdash; just like the German &mdash; and one, I remember,
  caught his breath in a sob almost, for he was young and just out. 'There is
  no more to be said,' went on the General, 'and as you have no letter to write
  I will not delay. You will be shot in half an hour.'</p>

  <p>"The German he saluted, and not a muscle of his face moved.</p>

  <p>"'Twas very gravely and quietly the officers saluted too, for, German or
  no German, spy or no spy, he was a brave man."</p>

     name="story10"></a>X. &mdash; MUD AND NOISE<br>
  Any Old Place &mdash; the Trenches, Winter, 1914</h2>

  <p class="first">"'Tis a strange war, sir," said Cassidy to me one day, as we
  watched the ceaseless stream of London traffic through the open window. "'Tis
  a strange war, and one which makes a man think, and wonder what will be the
  end of it at all. 'Tis beating them we shall be in the end, but who will be
  giving us back the friends and the lads we have lost? They tell me we may be
  after taking money from them to punish them, but will money give back life to
  those who are lying stiff and stark out yonder &mdash; the lads we have
  fought with, and drunk with, and lived alongside of for years?"</p>

  <p>"It's the same in all wars," I answered soberly, for in all faith the
  thought gives one to think.</p>

  <p>"Ah! 'tis different, sir," he said. "Was I not through the South African
  War, and are you putting this on the same footing at all? Some of these
  battalions have left at the present moment eight or nine men out of the
  thousand odd who came out with them in August. Think of it, sir &mdash; eight
  out of a thousand! And where will you be finding the others at all? They are
  not all dead, I know, but they are either that or wounded or missing. You
  cannot conceive it at all, sir. 'Twas only the other day I was talking to a
  lad home on leave, and he was telling me what it was like in the trenches
  now. It was a sergeant he was, and they were relieved one night in the
  ordinary way like by another regiment. They were not going back there again
  for four days, and when they had formed up behind, and the roll call was
  being taken, they found one of the lads was missing &mdash; at least there
  were many missing, but it was of this one he was after speaking.</p>

  <p>"The other regiment took over the trenches in the dark, and another one
  took over from them two days later. And then the first regiment went back
  again to the same place. That night the sergeant happened to go down a bit of
  a communication trench which the other regiments had not happened to use. At
  the end he found the man of whom I spoke &mdash; the one who was missing. He
  was wounded and weak, and he was stuck. Stuck, I tell you, stuck in the mud,
  and it was unable to move that he was. His cries had not been heard, and for
  four days and four nights had the lad been there. They got him out just
  before he died. 'Twas no one's fault &mdash; just sheer bad luck &mdash; but
  it shows what those trenches are like these days; though no one can realise
  what they really are till he has actually seen them. If you imagine a gateway
  into a field, which is not metalled, when there has been a rare lot of rain,
  and lots of horses and wagons and the like have been in and out, and then
  think of that same condition it is in being four foot deep and mixed with an
  Irish bog, 'tis a fair idea you have of some of the communication
  trenches.</p>

  <p>"Bedad, sir, they cannot realise it at home here at all. Sure they are
  shown in the pictures as happy and laughing &mdash; them lads in the trenches
  &mdash; and 'tis laughing they are, for if they were not 'tis mad they would
  be for the horror of it. You have not heard it yet, sir, the noise. 'Tis the
  noise that is the devil, and 'tis almost impossible to describe what that
  noise is like to you. There's the whistle of their rifle bullets at times as
  they pass over your head. 'Tis a sound, you know, like the drone of bees on a
  summer's night, and the thud, thud, as they hit the parapet in front of you.
  Then there's the bark of their maxims &mdash; a coughing sort of noise it is,
  sharp and clear cut &mdash; three or four shots at one time, and then maybe a
  great long bark for half a minute. And 'tis not one only, for the other guns
  take it up, and it seems continuous like all along their line.</p>

  <p>"And then the shells. Their shrapnel is not much anyway, though 'tis dirty
  the bullets are, and an ugly wound they give one. But 'tis the dirt of the
  bullets more than their speed that has one caught. The big ones are
  different. 'Tis a strange noise they make. 'Tis like a huge hornet or maybe a
  big cockchafer, like those one meets in the August evenings on the hills. You
  hear those Marias come buzzing out of the sky, and they pass over one's head
  with a droning sort of noise. And then they burst. 'Tis a big sort of 'plonk'
  they make, and the dirt and the mud fly around. There's a great cloud of
  smoke too, and yet they look far worse than they are. Of course, as you will
  guess, sir, if they burst in the trench 'tis mighty unpleasant for those that
  are in the vicinity; and if they burst near the trench as like as not the
  side will fall in, and some of the lads will be buried, but generally 'tis
  dug out they can be.</p>

  <p>"And then there's the little fellow filled with high explosives, and it's
  a nasty little devil that he is, for he sounds angry and he bursts angry.
  Bedad! the noise is awful, for there are all our own lads firing as well, and
  our guns and the spelting of our maxims. And by the holy saints, if you
  happens to get near where a battery of those French 75's is, you'd think your
  ears would be split. Mind you, sir, it is not always so. I was in the trench
  one evening, I remember, and suddenly the firing seemed to die away.
  Gradually it ceased, and I pulled out my watch. 'Twas half-past five, and for
  about ten minutes there was not a sound. 'Twas still, absolutely still, and
  the men looked at one another, for the silence sounded so strange. 'Twas very
  funny &mdash; that sudden deathly stillness. The men was almost talking in
  whispers. And then a man fired &mdash; just one chance shot &mdash; and in a
  second they was at it again. But 'twas strange, that silence &mdash; very
  strange."</p>

  <p>Cassidy paused, and as I handed him my cigarette case, I wondered if
  perchance for those few minutes the dread Harbinger himself had stayed his
  hand, appalled at the richness of his harvest and the insensate stupidity of
  his playthings. And then his cynical laugh as the crack of a rifle started
  him yet once again on the pilgrimage of Death.</p>

  <p>"There is another noise you will be after hearing, particularly yourself,
  sir," he went on after a while. "'Tis the noise of the snipers, and to my way
  of thinking 'tis the worst of the lot. It's going out you will be at night
  with the lads to put up wire, or to dig a bit of a trench maybe. Perhaps the
  guns are still at it, and away in the distance the sky will be like summer
  lightning. Then dull booms are going on all around you, and occasionally the
  sky is all lit up by one of them shells that does not explode but goes off
  like a firework. Maybe you are working in a wood, and every now and then
  there comes a crack from somewhere, and you hear the zip of a bullet in the
  ground near you. 'Tis that occasional crack that is the devil, for you do not
  know where it comes from. And sometimes a man nearby gives a little cough,
  and his shovel clatters against the pick, and when you get to him you find he
  will not use either again.</p>

  <p>"They are the devil, those fellows, for in the majority of cases 'tis just
  pure luck whether they hit you or whether they do not. Sometimes you will see
  one in a tree, maybe. He is not moving, but against the dim light in the sky
  you will see a strange shape &mdash; as like as not in a fork. Very likely
  'tis only imagination, but perhaps 'tis not; and you'll have a shot, and if
  'tis a good one there will be a crash and something will fall through the
  branches, and there will be a thud as it hits the ground. But as often as not
  they tie themselves on to the tree, the better to shoot. They are brave lads,
  and they stop there, perhaps clean through the day if 'tis a good tree. I
  remember me finding one once. Shot through the heart he was, and he was still
  lashed tight, and it's dead he had been for a week.</p>

  <p>"And you will bear in mind, sir, that 'tis not all on their side. Whether
  'tis true or not, I would not be after saying, but one of our own officers
  &mdash; a captain he is in the Infantry &mdash; is said to have two hundred
  and fifty of them to his own cheek. He creeps out by night with a sergeant,
  and takes a second gun with his servant as loader, and 'tis great sport that
  he has.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a strange war, that it is. They are all that close to one another,"
  and Cassidy shook his head reflectively. "There is but little sport in
  it."</p>

  <p>"I suppose that is the reason we are being trained in using hand grenades
  and bombs so particularly," I remarked. "They should be good when one is so
  close."</p>

  <p>"You are right, sir," he said, as he held out his hand for my cigarette
  case, "though to my way of thinking those things are very often more
  dangerous to those that throw them than they are to the Germans. You have to
  be very careful with them, or 'tis yourself will be blown to glory. Take
  those hand grenades, for instance. As you know yourself, sir, they explode on
  percussion, when they hit the ground. You take them in your right hand, and
  they have streamers behind them to make them fly straight when you throw
  them, and you hold those same streamers in your left. When you has undone the
  safety arrangements 'tis all ready to go off. I remember one night one of the
  Infantry gentlemen had some he was after throwing. He had the range
  beautifully, he had. 'Tis bowling at cricket one is after doing with them, as
  you know. You hold them behind your back in your right hand, and sweep up
  your arm like as you were bowling. Then you lets go with your left of the
  streamers, and away she flies.</p>

  <p>"'Twas great execution he was doing. He had, as I say, the range grand,
  and he had them all thrown save only the last. 'Twas one particular bit in
  their trench he was minded to reach with this last one, and a bit farther it
  was than he had thrown before. So he made a great effort, and he hit the back
  of his own trench with the grenade as it came up. 'Tis the danger, and the
  things of which you must mind &mdash; for you will not do it a second time.
  Those things explode just as easily when they hit the ground in an English
  trench as when 'tis a German they fall into. There was but little left of the
  poor gentleman, and six men was dead, too, when they came to look from behind
  the next traverse.</p>

  <p>"Then there's that other sort of bomb, there is, which they're after
  making from the ration jam tins. You mind them ration jam tins, sir; 'tis
  about six inches high they are and three across, and 'tis always 'plum and
  apple' they have inside. Sure one of the lads the other day got one of
  strawberry, and it was killed in the rush that he was. You fill them with
  bits of iron and the like, and put a bit of gun-cotton inside, and a
  detonator, and a bit of safety fuse. About two inches you use, which should
  take two or three seconds to bury. You lights the fuse and waits a second,
  and then you throws it. 'Tis a dangerous affair, for it will not explode till
  the fuse is burnt, and, as you know, that fuse is queer stuff in the burning.
  If you throw it too soon they throw it back, and if you leave it too late
  it's after bursting in your hand, so it's in the soup you are anyway with
  those things. 'Twas one of our own officers, it was, who went up one night to
  throw them for the lads in the trenches. 'Twas well for a time, and then one
  of them 'ad the fuse too long. They threw it back, and, by the saints it
  burst right in his face. Plastered he was with bits of iron and nails and
  things that he had put in himself.</p>

  <p>"''Tis hard,' he whispered, as they carried him away, ''tis hard that I
  should be done in by the nail that came out of my own boot this
  morning.'"</p>

  <p>"It is time," said a voice at the door, "for your tonic, Michael
  Cassidy."</p>

  <p>And with that I went away.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="story11"
     name="story11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE CHRISTMAS TRUCE</h2>

  <p class="first">"'Twas a strange thing, that Christmas truce, sir," remarked
  Sergeant Cassidy to me one afternoon, "and 'twas not a thing to be encouraged
  at all, and yet 'twas only natural, I suppose, for there comes a time when a
  man is sick of fighting, and his being craves for a bit of peace."</p>

  <p>"It was not approved of by the authorities, so I heard," I answered.</p>

  <p>"And quite rightly, sir. For we are but soldiers out there; the lads are
  not particular what they fight for, but 'tis their job to fight. More than
  that they do not ask. 'Tis a scrap of paper and the like, but you are after
  knowing the boys, sir, and 'tis not caring much that they are. They are there
  to fight, and the sooner 'tis over the better they will be pleased. 'Tis
  funny devils they are, as you know. I have seen those lads, some of them,
  with my own eyes. I have seen them, when those Germans were coming on in
  their masses, singing they were that song of theirs, and line after line was
  being mown down, till a great heap of their dead and dying were in front of
  us &mdash; I have seen them almost chuck down their guns and refuse to shoot,
  so sick were they with the awful butchery of it. 'Tis not that they are
  soft-hearted. If one of the lads, as you know, gets his dander up, the devil
  himself standing at the mouth of hell, would not be after stopping him.</p>

  <p>"'Twas in one of the Cavalry regiments that a little thing happened, which
  I was seeing. One of the officer gentlemen found a wounded German officer
  close to our trenches, and in the general clean-up after one of their attacks
  &mdash; 'twas when the Cavalry were in the trenches &mdash; he gave him a
  drink out of his water bottle. He took it &mdash; and I would tell you that
  it was a Prussian he was &mdash; he took it, I say, and as the Cavalry
  officer turned to go away, the Prussian drew his revolver and shot him dead
  from behind. 'Twas a big Irishman that saw it done, in the officer's troop,
  and for a second he stood stock still &mdash; for it was not believing his
  eyes that he was. Then he came to himself, and he bellowed like a bull. He
  took one leap at the Prussian, and he had his gun in his hand. The Prussian
  pointed his revolver again, but before his hand was half up, the lad hit it
  with the butt of his rifle. The revolver went west, and his arm was cracked
  like glass. 'Twas making strange noises that the Irishman was, and his face
  was working like a man in a fit. He screamed curses at him, and his language
  was terrible to hear; for the lads were watching, though without a proper
  understanding of what had occurred. And then the lad raised his gun, and his
  bayonet was on the end. 'Twas a fierce sight, for with a grunt like a pig he
  spitted the Prussian's head to the ground, and the steel was six inches into
  the ground on the other side; and when he took his hands away the rifle stood
  upright, quivering, with the Prussian pinned like a beetle in a box.</p>

  <p>"That is one thing, and when the lads heard what had happened they was
  like men whose women have been touched. But those Germans are not all like
  that, and 'tis a great mistake to think that they are. They are brave
  soldiers, and they are gallant soldiers, and it is not the lads who have met
  them who would be after denying it. And 'tis the terrible, the hideous
  slaughter which goes on when they make one of their mass attacks that tends
  almost to sicken the boys, for it does not agree always with their ideas of
  what is sporting. And that tendency must not be encouraged, sir, for we are
  at war, and 'tis not kid gloves one can wear for that same thing. That's why
  I say that things like that Christmas truce are dangerous. What would we have
  been after doing had the lads received orders for the attack that day? for
  whatever discipline one may have, sir, human nature is human nature, and when
  you have worn a man's hat and drunk his beer, 'tis hard to stick a bayonet
  into his stomach.</p>

  <p>"'Twas queer some of the stories that went around about that same truce.
  In some places it lasted for the whole day, and in some for but half an hour
  or an hour. 'Tis really an amazing thing when you come to think into it, sir.
  For weeks and months you have been lying opposite these men, and your one
  idea has been to kill them before they were after killing you. Then sudden
  like you go out and ask them how their mother is, and whether the children
  are over the chicken-pox or not. You drink with them, you smoke with them,
  you sing with them, knowing full well that in a few hours you will be at it
  all over again, and the man you have your arm through will be trying to put a
  bullet in your brain.</p>

  <p>"The officers were more stand-offish like, and they generally quarrelled
  over who started the war, for those Germans are just as certain that we did
  it as we are that they did. And as there is no method of proof &mdash;
  leastways none available out there &mdash; the meeting was apt to break up in
  confusion, there being no end to the argument save calling the other man a
  liar, which is apt to be taken more seriously out there than it would be,
  say, at the races at Ballygoyle, where 'tis a term of affection.</p>

  <p>"Another strange thing there was about it, and that is the ignorance of
  some of their lads about the state of affairs. 'Twas extraordinary. Says one
  of them to one of our lads, he says, 'Why do you go on?' he says. 'You are
  beaten, and you know it, and 'twould be more healthy for you to make peace
  now, as it is not hard we would be upon you. You are brave men, and so are
  we, and brave men should live, not die.'</p>

  <p>"Our lad, he looks at one of his pals and laughs. ''Tis beat we are, is
  it? And why are you after saying that?'</p>

  <p>"'Why,' says the German, 'do you not know? Paris is in our hands, and the
  French are finished, and our Zeppelins float over your London every day.
  Shortly great ships will leave filled with troops for England &mdash; when we
  have sunk the rest of your fleet.'</p>

  <p>"'Say, Copper Nob,' for it was red-headed the German was, 'you've got the
  wrong end of the blooming onion.' Our lads were laughing. 'There weren't no
  Zeppelins over London the last time I was there; and have you ever heard of
  the Falkland Islands? As to Paris, the officer yonder spent his week's leave
  there, and it's just come back that he is. Someone's been kidding you, old
  dear; for 'tis you that are beat &mdash; not us.'</p>

  <p>"'You have been deceived, my poor fellow,' says the German.</p>

  <p>"'Oh! cheese it with your poor fellow,' says the lad; and as his tone was
  annoyed like, the officer who had been to Paris comes up to stop any trouble.
  ''Tis beat, he says we are, sir,' said the lad, 'and 'tis Paris he says they
  have. Have you not just come from that same place yourself?'</p>

  <p>"The officer laughed, for 'twas a dangerous subject, and he was mindful to
  drop it &mdash; but Copper Nob would not have it. 'Am I to understand,' he
  says, 'that you have been to Paris lately?'</p>

  <p>"'I returned ten days ago,' says the officer.</p>

  <p>"'But 'tis invested by us,' says the German.</p>

  <p>"'I think not,' says the officer with a smile. 'There are none of your
  people within forty miles of Paris, in that part that you may have heard of
  &mdash; Soissons.'</p>

  <p>"'It is incredible that you &mdash; an officer &mdash; do not know the
  truth,' says Copper Nob. He looked pityingly at him for a moment, and then
  his face changed. 'Ah!' he says &mdash; 'I see. But you are a brave man, and
  a clever man, and is it fair to these men?'</p>

  <p>"With that he went away, and left the officer looking surprised. 'What the
  devil is the little blighter talking about?' he says. 'Is what fair? and
  anyway what the blazes is he after meaning at all?'</p>

  <p>"'I've got it, sir,' says a sergeant who was by. 'He thinks you knows all
  about it, and that the officers are keeping the men in ignorance of what has
  took place, the better to encourage them.'</p>

  <p>"And that is a thing which is important, sir, to my way of thinking, and
  which must not be overlooked. For to my way of looking at it, it is
  immaterial what is really true as far as the soldier is concerned. For his
  spirits to be kept up, as long as what he believes is true, is good; he will
  carry on, and all will be well. And those German lads have been guyed up with
  stories, and all they think is that we are the lads who have been deceived.
  They are just as certain that our newspapers are lying &mdash; these soldiers
  in the trenches, I mean &mdash; they are just as certain of that fact, as we
  are that theirs are. So where are you at all?"</p>

  <p>"But you can't guy the big business men like that, Cassidy," I said. "They
  will find out soon that all is not well."</p>

  <p>"Maybe, sir, maybe," he answered. "Of that you would be knowing better
  than me; and 'twould be strange, when they find out the real truth, if it did
  not make a difference. But all I can tell you is this: that as far as their
  soldiers are concerned 'tis beat they think we are; and they are utterly
  convinced that we are all being kept in ignorance of what is really
  occurring."</p>

  <p>And I think perhaps that the near-finish optimists might do well to ponder
  the utterances of Sergeant Michael Cassidy.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story12"
     name="story12"></a>XII. &mdash; SAPPING AND MINING</h2>

  <p class="first">"'Twas mentioning to you the other day that I was concerning
  the difference between them Prussians and the other blackguards in their army
  &mdash; them Saxons and the others." Cassidy carefully adjusted a pillow
  behind his head, and then gazed reflectively at an extremely vulgar cigarette
  holder of which he was inordinately proud.</p>

  <p>"They are different entirely," he continued, when I had justified my
  existence, "and it is careful one must be that when they are relieved in
  their trenches they do not change round. For should one have had those Saxon
  lads opposite to one for a time, one is apt to be after getting a little gay
  with them: bits of tobacco and the like are apt to change hands, and one is
  not above coming out of the trenches to take the air. If that same thing is
  tried on with the Prussians the result is unhealthy, and it is not twice one
  does it.</p>

  <p>"'Twas only the other day I was hearing from one of the lads, of one of
  those Saxon regiments occupying a bit of trench opposite us. 'Twas fed up
  they all were with the mud and the filth, and they knew &mdash; both we and
  they &mdash; that there was nothing doing. So gradual like they got a bit
  free and easy, until one morning the Germans hoisted a deck-chair on to the
  ground behind their trench.</p>

  <p>"'What is it at all they are doing?' said the lads, 'for 'tis a strange
  place entirely for a deck-chair.' And then they hoisted a white flag, and the
  lads were all watching, and one of their officers gets out and waves his hand
  to us. 'Good-morning, Englishmen,' he says, and sits down on the chair. He
  lights a cigar and starts reading the paper.</p>

  <p>"'Well, I'm&mdash;' says one of our officers, ''tis a casual blackguard
  that he is. But he has nerve, and the saints forbid that he should come to
  harm, for 'tis a man after my own heart that he is.'</p>

  <p>"And after a while, our lads and theirs, they all came out and lay on the
  ground, and 'tis most days they are after doing it. About fifty yards apart
  they are, and they shout remarks at one another. For, when all is said and
  done, 'tis of small matter if we kill ten of them and they kill ten of us, as
  far as the result is concerned. 'Tis just twenty more of the lads gone to the
  other side, and no good from it at all; and that is all the result one will
  be after getting, however much one throws bombs and shoots on sight and the
  like. For in the part of the line where an advance on either side is
  impossible 'tis silly to sacrifice the lads, and that is where it differed
  from the Christmas truce. The lads who were hobnobbing there had been
  fighting the day before, and would be at it again the next &mdash; not like
  the particular Saxon lads of whom I am after telling you. 'Twas a curious
  thing that happened with them, too, one day, for the Captain was out in his
  chair, and he was drinking beer, and all the lads were taking it easy like,
  when one of our guns made a boss shot and put a shell right in the middle of
  them. 'Twas pure accident, but it killed ten of them.</p>

  <p>"'Get back in the trenches,' shouts one of our own officers, for 'twas
  annoyed he thought they might be. But the German officer did not move. 'Twas
  his glass he waved friendly like, to show that he understood and bore no ill
  feeling, and all went on as before."</p>

  <p>Now, as I have mentioned, I have known Sergeant Cassidy for many years,
  and I have a very high regard for his many sterling qualities; but I am free
  to confess that I looked at him a trifle hard as I again replenished his
  cigarette holder. It struck me that the story had just a shade too much
  Ballygoyle flavour in it. For the benefit of those unacquainted with his
  history, I may mention that it was in the aforesaid hamlet in Erin that he
  first saw light, and his stories in connection with it put Baron Munchausen
  to utter rout.</p>

  <p>"Is it deceiving you I would be, sir!" he cried with dignity. "'Tis
  perhaps a little free and easy like in the telling that I was, but 'tis true
  every word of it. For is it a shell more or less that would be after making
  one annoyed over yonder, when one has been where they are like bees when they
  are swarming? And you will mind another thing, sir. When one has a long line
  like what we have yonder, the healthiness of it varies from mile to mile as a
  place of residence. There are bits of it which are of no use to man or beast,
  and there are others which are important; but 'tis held it must all be. Then
  there are bits which are easy to hold, and bits which are not. If you find
  yourself in a bit of flat country, with the Germans fifty yards away, and a
  barbed-wire factory in between, 'tis at a standstill you both are. There is
  nothing doing either way, and 'tis of little use trying to do it. And in
  those parts of the line where there is nothing of importance behind the other
  devils, such as a big railway junction or the like, 'tis stopped the fighting
  that they have. They just sit there and watch one another; and as I was
  saying in the story I was telling you, and which you was after doubting"
  &mdash; Cassidy fixed me with a stern eye &mdash; "they see the folly of
  killing when 'tis no gain to either side that it will be.</p>

  <p>"There are, of course, the other places, where by the nature of the ground
  one side or the other find it difficult to hold, or 'tis important to get a
  bit of a hill or the like; and there they are at it all day long and all
  night too for the matter of that. Mining they are and sapping, and the like,
  and it is not I that need be telling you what that means."</p>

  <p>But here, for the benefit of the uninitiated, I will interrupt the thread
  of my old friend Cassidy's discourse. For in this warfare of moles every idea
  and rule of fighting &mdash; the ABC of it one might say, has been changed
  from what one was taught. And it is possible that to some people sapping and
  mining may be but terms vaguely associated with picks and shovels and
  explosions which occur periodically in the bowels of the earth. At the risk,
  therefore, of boring those who know, I will try and give briefly an idea of
  what really happens.</p>

  <p>Originally, then, before the Huns hunned, that particular operation known
  as "sapping and mining" was associated with fortress warfare. Having found
  your fortress, you next proceeded to sit and look at it, from a trench and a
  safe distance. When you got tired of this interesting pastime, and were able
  to sit up and take nourishment again and all that sort of thing, you crept
  out into the dark and stilly night, and dug another trench a bit nearer the
  fortress. By dawn, when those unfortunates who had received the next man's
  pick through their foot, had been removed to the nearest clearing hospital,
  you were all safely ensconced two or three hundred yards nearer home.</p>

  <p>However, as frequently occurred, the owners of the fortress refused to
  conform to the rules, and insisted on directing the vulgar glare of
  publicity, in the shape of a searchlight, on the lads as they indulged in
  their nightly pastime. A tendency to open fire with maxims and other
  unpleasant instruments rendered it impossible for the men to do themselves
  justice, and other methods had to be resorted to &mdash; the first of these
  being known as "sapping." Now to sap is a tedious operation, as only one man
  can work on the front of each sap at a time. Should anyone doubt me, I would
  suggest that he digs a hole in his lawn about six feet deep in which he can
  comfortably stand, and then &mdash; never coming nearer to the surface of the
  ground than that six feet &mdash; that he should proceed to hew a passage
  from the hole to the pigsty or ferret house or some point of notoriety in the
  neighbourhood. Remember, he must not come to the surface of the ground and
  dig down. He must go forward, always keeping six feet below the surface,
  hewing a passage out for himself as he goes.</p>

  <p>True, in the trenches there is a waiting domestic to remove the earth to
  the rear on a silver salver, and other modern improvements laid on, but even
  so three feet an hour is very good going. There is another point, too, which
  must not be lost sight of. The average man, if he did dig a hole in the
  ground, in order to sap to the hennery, and was left at large and so forth,
  would in all probability go there in a straight line &mdash; it being, I
  believe, one of those great truths to be spoken of in whispers, and
  discovered by my old friend Euclid, that the shortest distance between two
  points is the straight line joining them. A point which the dear man
  overlooked, however, is that a long straight line is a very nice thing for
  what is known as enfilade fire, and a maxim firing down a communication
  trench &mdash; and that is all a sap is &mdash; makes things unhealthy for
  the users of that same &mdash; as Cassidy would say. So saps proceed in a
  series of zigzags, and by this means you get as near the fortress as possible
  &mdash; putting sandbags filled with earth on the ground in front of you, to
  protect your head.</p>

  <p>When you have got as near as you can, you join the heads of all the saps
  with another trench, and pause to recover your breath. I am speaking of what
  we were taught before the war, for <i>nous avons changé tout cela</i>.
  (Following Cassidy's advice I have been taking French lessons.) Then comes
  the time when the General sends for the sappers and breaks it to them gently
  that a little mining would be an interesting form of amusement. When everyone
  has got over their joy, and written their wills, and finished what was left
  of the port, they start mining. Now sapping is slow, but it's like an
  aeroplane and a tortoise compared to mining. In sapping you are up in the
  air, but in mining you're not. You go down under the ground, and proceed to
  make a series of mine shafts, starting from the trench you were last in,
  towards the fortress. As you go along you put in a succession of wooden cases
  to hold up the sides and top of the gallery, and the earth is taken away to
  the rear as in sapping. The direction is given by the officers, and though
  great accuracy is not needed, it is advisable not to go backwards or anything
  like that, as it tends to make the General unsympathetic.</p>

  <p>Let it not be considered that one's troubles are now over. Being people of
  a cantankerous disposition, the inhabitants of the fortress proceed to
  countermine &mdash; that is, run out mines to meet you. In parenthesis I
  might say that one's object in mining is that when one has approached the
  actual fort itself, the mine head is stacked with explosives, and at the
  crucial moment all the charges in all the mine-heads are fired. When those
  that feel like it have exploded, any of the assailants who are not stunned by
  the shock, or killed by the flying bricks, rush forward with a hoarse British
  cheer and capture the fort. That's the idea, and they're always led by the
  Senior Sapper Subaltern present, which is very beautiful and all that; but I
  have always thought personally, being what is described as an interested
  party, that a stone in one's boot, or a sudden attack of writer's cramp, or
  something of that sort, would be much more in my line. However, that is
  neither here nor there, and I'm really quite brave after dinner.</p>

  <p>Well, as I was saying, the men in the fort start countermining out to meet
  you, and their idea is to put little charges in the front of their mines and
  by exploding them make it impossible for you to work. When you are down there
  you can hear the tapping of their picks in the distance, but it is almost an
  impossible thing to tell how far they are away. They tried a big experiment
  once with some coal miners, to see if by listening they could tell how far
  off the other man was, but they failed. For if there is a fissure in the soil
  running parallel with the mine between you and the other lad, he will sound
  close to, and he may be fifty yards off. And if there's a stratum of some
  soil more or less impervious to sound perpendicular to you in front of your
  mine, he may be close, but you will scarcely hear him. It's jumpy work, for
  you never know but what the other fellow will blow up his mine and do you
  down.</p>

  <p>In this war, however, as far as fortresses are concerned, the necessity
  for sapping and mining has disappeared. In fact, fortress warfare has
  disappeared, as it was understood in the past, for no fortress can stand
  against modern heavy artillery. It is almost unnecessary to have any infantry
  there &mdash; the gunners can do the whole thing, and all the mining and
  sapping that is done now is done against infantry in their trenches. For it
  is easy to see that though these heavy guns are the devil when they have a
  fortress they can't miss, yet against infantry in narrow trenches they have a
  very different target, and one where they cannot do anything like the same
  amount of damage. Trench warfare now has become what fortress warfare was in
  the past &mdash; a slow and tedious operation; and just as with a fortress
  there came a time when further progress was impossible, save under the
  ground, so now, in those places where fighting continues without cessation,
  the only method of getting nearer the other trench is by sapping and mining,
  and the invariable retaliation of countermining.</p>

  <p>Of that sapping and mining there are stories to tell.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story13"
     name="story13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE HEAVY LIEUTENANT'S PRISONER</h2>

  <p class="first">"I was mentioning to you the last time you were round of the
  mining and of the sapping they are after doing over yonder," remarked Cassidy
  to me one day. "'Tis unpleasant, that it is, and no gentleman's way of
  fighting at all. Sure, there's enough death in the air without having to look
  for it under the ground as well. Moreover, as you can imagine, sir, there is
  nothing that so tends to shake the nerves of the lads as the explosion of a
  mine in the neighbourhood, for 'tis unhealthy for all concerned.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a favourite trick, and one which is done on both sides, to mine one
  of your own trenches. The gun-cotton is buried and the leads are taken away
  to the rear, being hidden too. Earlier in the proceedings, when everyone was
  not so suspicious like as they are now, the lads would get out of the bit of
  trench that was mined, and creep away to one in the rear during the night.
  When the Germans saw the trench was unoccupied &mdash; maybe they would
  discover it the same night when some of their creepers was on the war-path
  &mdash; 'twas great excitement they was thrown into, thinking 'twas a
  retirement or the like. Like as not, the next morning there they would be.
  And then there would be a great tearing roar, and the mud and stones and
  &mdash; other things would rush up to the sky. A great stillness followed,
  and 'twas all over.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a terrible form of warfare, for 'tis so relentless like, so cold-
  blooded. One's blood is not up &mdash; 'tis not fighting that one is at the
  moment. Just the forcing down of the handle of the exploder, and forty or
  fifty of them is gone. Can one yet realise the thoughts of the lad who is
  pressing the button? 'Will I give them one minute more?' he says to himself,
  as the first faint streak of dawn is coming into the sky. And then he unlocks
  the exploder and raises the handle. He waits a moment, and the lads near him
  watch him fascinated like. For to bag a man with a gun is one thing; there is
  sport &mdash; there is an element of one against one, like when the quality
  goes big game shooting. But to bag twenty men by a mine has not the same
  feeling at all, even if they are Germans. And as the men sit watching, maybe
  his jaw tightens a little, maybe he laughs a little, or maybe he curses a
  little, as suddenly he forces the handle down with all his weight, and 'tis
  all over."</p>

  <p>Without speaking I handed him my cigarette case. The War of Moles, with
  death in the air, and death in the ground, and an enemy one never sees. And
  yet someone once said there was romance in it!</p>

  <p>"Then at times they succeed in getting up near the other trenches with
  some mine shafts they have run out from their own. 'Tis an important point,
  maybe, and 'tis countermining the others are. But you are after knowing the
  difficulties of that same mining and countermining game, and 'tis an equal
  chance whether you meet them underground, and get busy with a pick or two
  &mdash; which same is a good weapon, I would tell you.</p>

  <p>"Then maybe, as I was saying, 'tis an important place, and 'tis a big
  attack they will be making. For hours the guns plaster you with their little
  messages of love, and you sit tight wishing you were at home in a picture
  show, with one of your best girls. All this time their lads that are going to
  make the attack are away back, sleeping their last beauty sleep, for 'tis
  drugs they use greatly, and maybe the idea is good. They give them all
  something to make them sleep, and then just before they come on they are
  given something else, which is to buck them up, and give them that feeling
  which you and me would be after getting when we had drunk well of the
  whisky.</p>

  <p>"Then maybe all is ready, and they are singing and feeling full of the
  Fatherland when their engineers blows up the mines. 'Tis possible they may
  blow up great bits of the advanced trench, and all the men as well; and
  though maybe 'tis knowing they have been that they were mining, yet 'tis
  always unexpected when it comes, and the lads in the support trenches are
  sort of dazed like for a while. Then on they come, with officers behind to
  give them a bit of a reminder, should that happy feeling of the joy of dying
  for Bill ooze away too quickly, and officers in front who wish they weren't
  to lead them. But 'tis not mistaken I would have you, sir. Those attacks are
  not to be sneezed at. 'Tis marvellous how they come on &mdash; drugs or no
  drugs. Right up to the trenches &mdash; dying in rows they are &mdash; but on
  they come. They are brave, and I would not be denying it.</p>

  <p>"Then there's a lot of sapping that both sides are after doing as well.
  They run out a sap-head from the trench, maybe to see what's going on, or
  maybe to start a mine from, or perhaps just to get a more convenient place to
  fire from for one of their good shots. 'Tis an absolute rabbit warren, as you
  can imagine, but 'tis necessary that the location of those same sap-heads
  should be known more or less exact like, and what is going on in them, so
  that if they are up to any mischief &mdash; and 'tis not sapping you would be
  doing for fun or because it was a hobby &mdash; then you can make one of your
  own maybe, and scotch them that way. And as the habit of strolling about by
  day to find out what is the news, and to see if the grass is still green, is
  unhealthy, and unlikely to give satisfaction at all, save only to the lads
  opposite, 'tis at night that these little things must be found out. Oh! 'tis
  a rare lot of creeping goes on between the trenches at night.</p>

  <p>"'Twas a funny story I was after hearing the other day of that same
  creeping. 'Twas a sap-head them Germans had made, and 'twas the opinion of
  the captain of the company in the trenches just opposite, that 'twas not for
  the hatching of chickens or the like that it would be used. Also it was not
  certain that he was exactly where it lay. So one of the subaltern gentlemen
  he says to him one night: ''Tis out I will go, sir,' he says, 'and find where
  it is, and what they are doing at all.' He was a stout gentleman was the
  lieutenant, and one of the boys entirely.</p>

  <p>"''Tis well,' said the captain. 'Away with you, but do not linger on the
  parapet of our trench as you get out, or 'tis a landslip we will be having':
  for 'twas big round the stomach he was, and heavy.</p>

  <p>"Away he creeps, and he had not been gone a minute when a terrible splash
  was heard, and a great commotion from in front.</p>

  <p>"'What has happened?' says the captain. 'Is it bathing that he is?' for
  there was a great blowing and spitting and spluttering, and terrible language
  for which that same officer was famed. The lads they listened, and after a
  while they heard his voice from in front like a fog horn:</p>

  <p>"''Tis my prisoner that you are, you rat!' and with a terrible upheaval
  the stout officer fell into the trench again, and with him a German. Dripping
  wet they both were and shivering in every limb, for the wind was like
  ice.</p>

  <p>"'What is it at all?' said the captain, 'and what is the family pet you
  have with you?' and he looked at the Boche, who was cowering in the corner of
  the trench.</p>

  <p>"'The rat,' says the lieutenant, when he could speak for the chattering of
  his teeth &mdash; 'the rat,' he says, 'was creeping too. 'Twas out there I
  went, sir, and creeping I was towards the sap-head, when I met it. Suddenly
  his face loomed out of the night, and there we was with our noses almost
  touching. "Are you English?" I says, for I could not see. "Gott in Himmel,"
  says he, and the words were not out of his mouth before I had him. 'Twas by
  the nose I seized him, for 'tis a great organ, as you will be after seeing,
  and 'twas close to me, blocking the landscape. I seized him by the nose and
  an ear, and 'twas struggling he was, so I sat upon him.'</p>

  <p>"'Great Scott!' says the captain. 'Poor brute,' and he looks at the
  German.</p>

  <p>"'I sat upon him,' says the subaltern, 'and at that moment the earth gave
  way. 'Twas on the edge of a Black Maria hole we were, which was filled with
  water, and it gave way. We were up to our necks in the water, but it was
  underneath he was, and I sat upon his face for a while &mdash; the
  blackguard. Then I pulled it out, and there it is.'</p>

  <p>"'It is killed I will be,' said the little man, for he spoke English after
  a fashion.</p>

  <p>"'Why would you be killed?' said the captain. ''Tis death from
  suffocation, and death from drowning you have already escaped, and why would
  you be killed? We do not kill our prisoners,' and he looks at him surprised
  like.</p>

  <p>"'Do you not?' he says, 'for they are after telling us all that you do,'
  and 'twas happy as a king he looked. 'If you do not kill me, I am glad, for
  maybe I shall again see London, where I have lived for many years.'</p>

  <p>"'Funny little blighter,' says the captain. 'It's like something out of
  cheese that he is, and 'tis strange notions that he has of how we treat our
  prisoners.'"</p>

  <p>"I hear they tell all their men that they will be killed if they are
  captured," I said.</p>

  <p>"'Tis so, sir," said Cassidy; "and 'tis a thing or two I can tell you that
  I have seen, if you care to come round another day, on that same
  subject."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story14"
     name="story14"></a>XIV. &mdash; HOW TO BE HAPPY THOUGH WOUNDED</h2>

  <p class="first">"I suppose that having only had a little fellow of an army
  in the past," said Cassidy to me one day, "one is after regarding the boys as
  the family pets, and that is why they look after our wounded so well. From
  all one is hearing, 'tis the idea with those other lads that once a man is
  wounded 'tis no more use that he is at all, and 'tis not bothered with him
  that they will be. Those trains packed with wounded men, and carts and the
  like, with the blood dripping out of the doorways on to the ground, and
  terrible groans, of which one reads in the paper, does not strike one as a
  picnic for Bank Holiday at all.</p>

  <p>"'Tis exaggerated it may be, of course, and that I would not be after
  knowing at all, but 'tis fitting in that it is with their doctrines of hate
  and their ruthlessness, of which I have heard tell. And 'tis another thing
  too, sir. They tell their men that we and the French, 'tis the same that we
  are; and, as you know, their men all think that if they are wounded and fall
  into our hands it is killed they will be. Do I not remember a little thing
  that happened a while back? In a wood we were, sitting quiet like, and eating
  a bit of bully by way of a diversion. Suddenly we see five of the most
  terrible-looking objects you have ever seen in your life, tottering through
  the trees. Filthy they were, and absolutely in rags. 'Twas unable to stand
  that they were with ease, and the five of them came lurching along, holding
  one another up.</p>

  <p>"'Saints preserve us,' says a corporal to me; ''tis the chorus from the
  Gaiety that has blown in.'</p>

  <p>"They held up their hands, leastways as many as could do it held them up
  &mdash; which were three hands in all &mdash; for, as I should have said
  before, they were Germans &mdash; Uhlans, to be exact.</p>

  <p>"'Walk up, my beauties,' says I, 'and it's hearing we will be of your
  murky past.'</p>

  <p>"Then they came nearer, and when we looked at them closely &mdash; well,
  'tis nasty things one has seen &mdash; but they were the worst. I would not
  be after telling you what they looked like, but we were all nearly sick.</p>

  <p>"'Water,' gasped one of them in English. 'Water, for the love of
  Heaven!'</p>

  <p>"So we gave them water, and, saints preserve us, how those five drank!
  They lowered pints, and 'twas hideous to watch them.</p>

  <p>"'Away with you,' I says to one of the lads, 'and get the doctor if it is
  not busy that he is, and tell him we have five wounded Germans.'</p>

  <p>"The doctor he came along and looked at them, and we watched for a
  distance, for 'twas not near them we could be with comfort.</p>

  <p>"'Great Heavens!' he said, 'how long is it you have been in the woods with
  your wounds like this?'</p>

  <p>"'Five days,' said the one who spoke English. 'We thought you would be
  after shooting us if we came in, but now it doesn't matter, for it is shot we
  would wish to be &mdash; we are in such agony.'</p>

  <p>"The doctor, he looked at me and shook his head. ''Tis waste of time,' he
  whispered. 'I cannot save them now &mdash; 'tis too late. I will do what I
  can, but 'tis useless it will be. Had they come in two or three days ago,
  'twould have been easy, for their wounds are but light ones; but the gangrene
  has set in terribly, and 'tis dead by the night they will all be.'</p>

  <p>"And they were, every man jack of the five. And had they not been stuffed
  with them yarns, and had given themselves up sooner, 'tis saved they would
  all have been.</p>

  <p>"But take our own lads when they take it in the neck, sir." Cassidy
  absent-mindedly stretched out his hand for my cigarette case. "'Tis as easy
  as falling off a log. Take myself in the manner of speaking. As you know,
  'twas in the foot I stopped one of their bullets one night, when we were
  putting up a bit of wire for the boys.</p>

  <p>"''Tis hit I am,' I says to Mr Tracey, I says. ''Tis in the foot I have
  took it; and what will I do, for I doubt if I can walk with ease?'</p>

  <p>"So he told off a couple of the lads, and they helped me back to the
  advanced dressing station. A dug-out it was, about a quarter of a mile behind
  the firing line.</p>

  <p>"''Tis in the foot I have it taken,' I said to the doctor-man who was
  there.</p>

  <p>"He dressed it for me, and 'twas hurting a bit that it was, and I laid
  down and waited a while; for the dug-out being a bit concealed like, 'twas
  easy in that particular place for a motor ambulance to come there. Sure
  enough, about an hour after, a motor ambulance arrived. I do not know if you
  have seen the things, sir, but they are made to carry four lying at full
  length on the stretchers. Two stretchers are hooked to the roof above the
  others, like the berths in a ship. Off we went, and there were four of us
  inside, bound for one of the clearing hospitals, which same are up close to
  the firing line &mdash; as close as possible without being under shell fire;
  though some of them are, and it is shelled they sometimes are.</p>

  <p>"We jolted and swayed and cursed, for the roads are terrible round those
  parts; and though the driver is as careful as he can be, there are, like as
  not, others to be brought in, and it is not all night he can be over one
  trip. He has to go back for more. My foot was throbbing to beat the band; but
  I mind me there was a poor devil with a shattered shoulder beneath me whose
  moaning was terrible. Still, 'twas over at last, and we reached the hospital.
  The stretchers were taken out and we were carried up to bed. 'Twas morning
  when we arrived, and 'twas great to see the sight of a bed again &mdash;
  bedad! 'twas great &mdash; with sheets and the like. A great big room it was,
  all divided up into sort of cubicles like. 'Twas there I spent the whole of
  the day, and officers and men were brought in during the day, and others went
  out to be taken down to the base in the hospital trains. 'Twas in a good
  place I was in that hospital, I mind me, for towards evening my foot was a
  little easier, and 'twas talking about the food and the drink for the
  patients that the sister was to the orderly. 'Twas close by where I was
  lying, and I heard it all.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a little bit of chicken for the Captain yonder,' she says, 'and it's
  a whisky-and-soda he may have. As for the Colonel &mdash; the spirit is not
  good for him, but a small bottle of the champagne will not be after hurting
  him at all.'</p>

  <p>"'Tis well,' said the orderly. 'And what of the other new patient &mdash;
  Michael Cassidy?'</p>

  <p>"'Ah!' says she, 'with a wound in his foot. 'Tis hot milk he may
  have.'</p>

  <p>"But 'twas not more I waited to hear, for I let out a roar of 'Help,' so
  that the orderly came running to find out the trouble.</p>

  <p>"'Away with you,' I says, 'for I am not well, and your face is not either.
  'Tis the sister I would see.'</p>

  <p>"'What is it, Cassidy?' she says, coming up.</p>

  <p>"'Sister darling,' says I, ''twas hearing you that I was. 'Tis whisky for
  the Captain, and champagne for the Colonel, and for Michael Cassidy 'tis hot
  milk. You would not be so cruel, for 'tis heating to the blood I have always
  found the milk.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis something you shall have inside it,' says she, laughing.</p>

  <p>"''Tis well,' I says, 'but as you love me, sister, make not the milk part
  too strong.'</p>

  <p>"'Orderly,' she says, 'beat up two eggs in Cassidy's milk,' and with that
  she was away. 'Twas terrible, but maybe she was right, for a little later my
  foot started throbbing bad.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a strange thing the noises in a hospital at night, sir. There were
  fifty or sixty of us in that ward, and 'twas screened from one another we
  were by wooden partitions, as I have been telling you. Next door to me was a
  lad muttering to himself, and 'twas rot he was talking of his best girl and
  the Kaiser all jumbled up together. Low groans were coming from different
  parts of the room, and 'twas a terrible air of restlessness brooded over the
  place. Away down the other end an officer was coughing as if he would tear
  himself to pieces, and once very loud and sharp a voice rang out 'Steady,
  boys.' And up and down went the sister, with a glass of milk for one maybe,
  and a cool hand on a lad's hot forehead, and a soothing word for all of us.
  'Tis angels they are.</p>

  <p>"And then &mdash; 'twas only to be expected like &mdash; I got a bit
  light-headed myself, but not bad, for 'twas into a sort of uneasy doze that I
  fell: dreaming vividly I was &mdash; fever dreams &mdash; you mind the sort,
  sir. 'Twas a great dream, for 'twas back in Ballygoyle that I was, and 'twas
  a grand morning in November. For the hounds were drawing the gorse, and the
  greatest dog fox you have ever seen was away like a streak &mdash; with the
  beauties streaming after him. I heard their music &mdash; and 'twas giving
  tongue I was myself &mdash; for 'twas four miles without a check as he was
  going. 'Hark-to-'em, the beauties!' I cries. 'Forrard on, my darlings!' and
  as I was coming to the first bank myself, 'twas a big one too, I woke up, and
  the sister was there.</p>

  <p>"'Hush, Cassidy,' she says, ''tis disturbing the others that you are.'</p>

  <p>"'But 'twas hounds I heard in full cry,' I says, 'and we were in
  Ballygoyle.'</p>

  <p>"''Twas not hounds,' she says, putting her hand on my forehead; ''twas the
  Colonel, who had just got to sleep, and it's woken him you have.'</p>

  <p>"As she was speaking he started again. Bedad! sir, I have never heard his
  equal. 'Twas like the music of fifteen packs of hounds, broken by periodical
  explosions like landmines going off.</p>

  <p>"''Tis great,' I says, as he woke up again with a terrible loud explosion
  that shook the room. ''Tis my grandfather he has beaten entirely, and 'twas
  him you could hear in the next street.'</p>

  <p>"'Twas the next morning they took me away again, for you will mind that at
  the clearing hospitals up at the front 'tis rare that they keep one for more
  than a night. 'Tis never knowing that they are whether there will not be an
  attack or the like, and a lot of the lads suddenly to make room for, so they
  have you out at once. Carried downstairs in a stretcher I was to one of those
  motor ambulances again, and away we went to the station.</p>

  <p>"And while I think of it, sir, 'twas a fine story I heard the other day,
  and 'tis talking of clearing hospitals that made me think of it. The very
  same night I was in one myself, those Germans put a few shells into another
  of them in another part of the line. 'Twas but little damage they did, saving
  only to burst one of those little high-explosive shells close by one of the
  motor cyclists as he was passing by outside. Nigh blown to bits he was, but
  there was still life in him.</p>

  <p>"'A doctor,' cried the lads who came running up, 'for 'tis hurt he
  is.'</p>

  <p>"''Tis no doctor I want at all,' he gasps, ''tis an officer. Get an
  officer &mdash; a staff officer if possible, but anyway an officer. 'Tis not
  a doctor will be doing me any good' &mdash; for the lad knew 'twas all
  over.</p>

  <p>"They ran and fetched an officer, and when he came, the motor cyclist
  clutched his arm and whispered. 'You have it, sir?' he says when he had
  finished, 'for 'tis important. Repeat it to me.' And the officer repeated
  it.</p>

  <p>"'Tis well,' he said, 'and 'tis not failed I have,' as the doctor arrived.
  ''Tis no good, doc,' he says, ''tis all up; but I have the message
  delivered.' And then he turned over and muttered. ''Tis all right, dear,' he
  whispers, and he choked a bit, and 'twas all over. 'Twas a 'Varsity lad, they
  told me, and a man that he was.</p>

  <p>"But as I was telling you, sir," he went on after a moment, "they took me
  to the hospital train, and 'twas comfortable it was too. 'Tis nice things to
  eat and drink you can get on board, and 'twas a nice lady was in charge of
  the carriage where I was. Kind she was, and with her a gentleman of the Red
  Cross. 'Twas between six and seven hours we were before we reached the base,
  where we were again taken by them motor ambulances to a big stationary
  hospital. 'Twas there I met the sweetest little hospital nurse I have ever
  seen. Begorrah! sir, she was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But at this moment I felt an interruption was necessary. "Quite so,
  Cassidy; so they all are, and I trust Mrs Cassidy shares your opinion," I
  remarked, with the vain idea of stemming this flood-tide of reminiscence.</p>

  <p>"A sweet little fringe she had," he went on dreamily, "and the neatest
  little ankle you have seen outside of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But personally I was outside of the door.</p>

  <h2><a id="story15"
     name="story15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE TERRIBLE DANGER OF "FUNK"</h2>

  <p class="first">"Do you think, Cassidy," I remarked one day to him, "that
  all the stories one hears of the atrocities committed by those blighters are
  true, or are they a bit exaggerated?" I held out my cigarette case to save
  time, which he was gracious enough to accept without comment.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a hard question, sir," he returned at length, "and one that I would
  not be after answering at once without thinking it over a bit like. 'Tis not
  doubting I would be at all that there were terrible things done as they came
  through Belgium &mdash; things that our own lads would not be after doing at
  all. For you know the boys, sir. They are sometimes a bit gay when they have
  a drop of the stuff on board &mdash; but there are some things they would not
  do at all &mdash; certainly if there were a lot of them together. 'Tis
  ashamed they would be for others to see &mdash; though 'tis possible that
  isolated men here and there might be after doing a girl down. But if half
  what one hears of those Germans is true, 'tis the devils of hell they are. I
  would not be telling you of the stories I have heard, and 'tis well-nigh
  impossible to believe that some of them are true.</p>

  <p>"Them Uhlans are the worse, because 'tis they who get sent off in small
  parties to scout and the like, and in many cases they are told they are not
  to come back without the information. They are under no control at all, and
  the result is they get drunk as can be. When they were first coming over
  France the country was full of wine, and 'twas as easy as falling off a log,
  to find the liquor. 'Tis not so easy now." Sergeant Cassidy regarded the
  other side of the street with a melancholy air.</p>

  <p>"Those fellows &mdash; they used to go out, and 'tis terrible the things
  they would be after doing. 'Tis a delight they would take in strapping the
  fathers and the brothers to the trees, and such things, and making them watch
  what they would do to the young girls. 'Tis devils that they are. But you
  have been hearing those stories, sir, and 'tis nothing new I would be telling
  you if I should repeat them to you. There is one maybe you have not heard,
  and though it concerns the girls not at all, yet it shows the manner of men
  that they are.</p>

  <p>"'Twas a lad they caught on a motor cycle. There were six of them, and he
  was but one. I was watching it myself from a little hill through the field-
  glasses. 'Twas just pure chance I happened to be after seeing it at all
  &mdash; but there it is. They caught him fair and square, and had they shot
  him dead on the spot I would not be saying anything at all. 'Twould have been
  the luck of war, and 'tis what we entered the Army for. But 'twas nothing of
  the sort they did at all. He had not the time to draw his revolver, and if he
  had 'twould have been of but little use, before they had him upset in the
  road. He stood there &mdash; dazed like in the middle of the road, and the
  six of them were round him jeering. Then, while one in front spoke to him,
  those behind stuck him in the back with their lances. He fell down in the
  road squirming, and they stuck him again where he lay &mdash; though still
  they were not after killing him. And then a brilliant idea struck them. 'Twas
  a rick there was, of hay, beside the road, and they fired it. Then, when it
  was well alight, they chucked his machine on to it, and then the lad himself.
  Still alive he was, and they burnt him to death out of sheer devilry. Why
  could they not have killed him outright? The result was the same &mdash; one
  man less to us. But it serves to show the manner of swine that they are
  &mdash; full of senseless brutality.</p>

  <p>"'Tis fitting in with what they have been taught, I suppose," continued
  Cassidy after a pause. "They write of Louvain and Rheims and all the other
  beautiful places they have been after spoiling &mdash; and of them I would
  say nothing. 'Tis not for the likes of me to know the rights and wrongs of
  bombarding those beautiful cathedrals and the like. 'Tis part of their
  method; and perhaps, sir, 'tis better in the long run to strike terror into
  the hearts of the population by any means you can than to fight gentlemanly,
  like we do. I do not know about that at all &mdash; and 'tis not much that I
  hold with buildings anyway. 'Tis works of art that they are, so I read in the
  paper; but 'tis the little house at Ballygoyle, where 'tis the porter with a
  stick in it one is after getting, that appeals most to me. But, as I say,
  'tis no judge that I am at all.</p>

  <p>"And there is another thing, too &mdash; which one may be forgetting. A
  church is, often as not, the best place in the village to see from. 'Tis
  higher than the other houses around, and 'tis the best place from which to
  view the effect of the artillery fire. Well, sir, if 'tis used for that
  purpose, they have a perfect right to shell it, church or no church. Would we
  not be doing the same thing ourselves? and 'tis possible that some of those
  destructive atrocities for which they are blamed have been due to reasons of
  that sort. I would not be saying, for I do not know; but 'tis possible. One
  thing is clear, sir, about their method of fighting. 'Tis afraid they would
  make us, and 'tis nothing they will stick at to do that same; and are they
  not after saying that all is fair in love or war? 'Tis not excusing them that
  I would be, but there is perhaps something to be said for the knocking down
  of the villages we have read of in the papers. Swine they are, without a
  doubt, but 'tis possible in a few cases there may be an excuse."</p>

  <p>"But what excuse can there be," I demanded, "for the way in which they
  have butchered whole batches of people &mdash; old men and women, and
  children too, because they say someone has fired on them from one of the
  houses in the village? It is inexcusable, Cassidy."</p>

  <p>"Maybe, sir, maybe," he answered. "I would not have you think that it was
  defending them that I was at all. They are swine, and I hate them, and 'tis
  only three should be kept at all &mdash; one in England, one in France, and
  one in Russia &mdash; and 'tis in a museum they should each be for safety.
  But what would you do yourself, if you were fired on by a civilian in a
  village? You do not know who it was at all; but one, or maybe two, of the
  lads are dead. What will you be after doing, not only to punish the village,
  but to prevent it occurring in the next one you go into? 'Tis a difficult
  point, sir, and 'tis not able you are to dismiss it at once, as if 'twas
  nothing. 'Tis the same old thing &mdash; the system of putting the fear of
  God into their enemies, and 'tis not I that would be saying 'twas a bad one.
  For as a soldier, sir, you will be after appreciating the value to the other
  side of one or two cowards in the lads opposite them, and if 'tis more
  widespread still, 'tis even more valuable. But I'm thinking that what shows
  the type of blackguards they are, even more than their atrocities, is their
  dirty habits. 'Tis inconceivable, if you have not seen it yourself, to
  realise the filth and dirt one was after finding in some of those beautiful
  French houses where those blighters had been before us. 'Tis not only that
  they had smashed the whole place up, and torn down the lovely pictures and
  the like, and trampled up the flowers for no reason at all &mdash; 'twas not
  only that, I say, but 'twas more especial like the filthy habits of the
  brutes. 'Twas disgusting &mdash; and for that there is no excuse. Sure
  animals themselves would be behaving better.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I would not be denying it. They are swine, with the manners of
  swine, and there is no excuse for many of the things they have done at all.
  But as soldiers one must realise that there is reason in bombarding a
  hospital if they think there is an ammunition train near it, and having at a
  church if there is an artillery observer in it."</p>

  <p>"But they've abused the flag of truce as well," I said. "There is no
  excuse for that."</p>

  <p>"'Tis well you have said it, sir, or 'tis me that might have been
  forgetting to warn you of that same thing when you get out there. 'Tis a
  thing of which you must be amazingly careful, and over that matter it's a lot
  there is to be said on both sides. For take it this way. There is a regiment
  of them in the trenches, and maybe the company in the middle has been having
  a terrible doing, while the others have been getting off easy like. The
  company in the centre gets fed up, and shows the white flag. If the lads
  opposite to them are such fools as to get out of their trenches and go to
  take them prisoners, 'tis shot they deserve to be, and 'tis no patience I
  would have with them at all. The other companies have not given in, and like
  as not the other lads do not know that the white flag has been hoisted at
  all. That being so, if you go dancing gaily over to the other trenches 'tis
  your own silly fault, and the other lads who have not hoisted the flag are
  perfectly right in killing you. 'Tis they who must come to you, leaving their
  arms behind them, if they wish to surrender; though there is not many would
  reach you alive, for 'tis killed they would be by their own men. It takes
  pluck to come in and surrender if it means walking about between the
  trenches, for everyone's finger is light on the trigger, these days, and if
  people are heard taking the air at night 'tis not healthy for them. Though
  they tell me a lot of their lads are doing it, and 'tis well, for that sort
  of thing is after being catching to the others. 'Tis a catching thing, is
  cowardice, and one man who is afraid, as you will know, sir, may be a
  terrible danger to the unit that is cursed with him."</p>

  <p>"'Tis time your foot was dressed, Cassidy," said the sister, putting her
  head round the door, and with that he left me pondering over his last
  remark.</p>

  <p>I seemed to see in my mind a line of men charging over the ground, with a
  hail of bullets to keep them amused; and then, as gradually the tension
  became more acute, the strain more terrific, the breaking-point beyond which
  flesh and blood cannot go more imminent, I saw a man waver in the centre. He
  wavered and stopped; he had broken, the weakest link in the chain. Behind him
  was an officer with a revolver in his hand, and without a second's hesitation
  the officer killed him, and gathering up the broken pieces the line surged
  on, hardly conscious that for a second a deadly danger had stalked within
  their midst.</p>

  <p>And then I saw another picture. The same line, the same scene, but in this
  case the officer hesitated to shoot &mdash; and was lost. All along the line,
  spreading with inconceivable rapidity outwards from that broken link, men
  paused, stopped, caught by the deadly contagion. The line wavered, broke. The
  attack had failed, because an officer, confronted with a new problem, had
  hesitated to kill one of his own men.</p>

  <p>We are not taught it in the Army. It is an idea we have never had brought
  home &mdash; the mention of the word "funk." But just as it is easy to mend a
  small hole in one's pocket if one does it at once, and then it will not grow
  bigger; and just as it is easy to stop a small hole in a dam if one does it
  at once, but very hard when it grows bigger, just so is it essential to act,
  and act at once, if one would prevent the hesitation of one man causing the
  disaster of hundreds.</p>

  <p>It is a problem with which one may never be confronted, but it is well to
  give thought to it, for if it should come it will be too late to do so then.
  And it is not one that can be dismissed lightly, for it goes against the
  grain to shoot a "pal," and with us officers and men are "pals." But it is
  not well that anyone should forget that men are human, and that there may
  come a moment when a great and terrible decision must be made, and made <i>at
  once</i>, without a second's hesitation; and if that decision is to be the
  right one, if hundreds of lives hang in the balance, and what is more,
  success or failure, the man who fails to arrive at that decision is just as
  culpable &mdash; ay, more so, for his education is greater &mdash; as the man
  who gave out, the rotten link in the chain.</p>

  <h2><a id="story16"
     name="story16"></a>XVI. &mdash; GOOD-BYE AND GOOD LUCK</h2>

  <p class="first">It was with quite a heavy heart that I found myself
  ascending the steps of the house where my disreputable old friend temporarily
  dwelt, for it was for the last time; and in this war all good-byes tend to
  have a feeling of solemnity about them. I found him in front of the open
  window making violent signals to a parlour maid in the house opposite; but as
  she hastily vanished when she saw me, I did not draw undue attention to his
  behaviour.</p>

  <p>"'Tis yourself, sir," he said, "and it's glad to see you that I am. 'Tis
  reading I've just been of some French lads who went out one night to the
  German trenches to cut the wire. Twenty of them there were under a sergeant,
  and they got right up without being seen. 'Twas cutting they were, when one
  of them cut the alarm wire, and 'twas all up. They put the search-lights on,
  and there they were &mdash; absolutely in the soup. In a second they were all
  killed or wounded, and 'twas lucky for those that were killed, for their end
  was quick and merciful. But the poor devils who were wounded! Does it not
  bring a lump to one's throat, sir, to think of them? &mdash; for those German
  swine would neither allow the French to come out and rescue them, nor would
  they be bothered with the taking of them prisoners themselves.</p>

  <p>"For two days and nights they lay there, moaning feebly and trying to bind
  one another's wounds; and 'twas not killing them even the Germans would be,
  to end their misery, though they were close to their trenches. They liked to
  gloat over them, as they died in agony. At last 'twas only the sergeant who
  was left, and 'twas not far from rest and peace that he was at all. He could
  hardly move, his limbs were just twitching feebly, when suddenly &mdash;
  'twas just before the end, I suppose &mdash; he gathered all his strength
  together, and his voice rang out through the night. 'Twas the Marseillaise he
  sang, and as they heard it a great roar of cheers came from the French, and
  they all took it up with him. 'Twas a great death for a man to die &mdash; to
  go out to such a tune, like that, with the Germans to hear, and to know that,
  though death was on you, yet you were a better man than those who had let you
  die."</p>

  <p>"It must be an awful thing to see fellows you know wounded in front of
  you, and not be able to get at them," I said as he paused.</p>

  <p>"It is, sir, it is. Sometimes in the morning one will see a great mass of
  men lying out in front, and some are dead and some are dying, and some are
  only wounded badly. 'Tis terrible the moaning, and sometimes a man in his
  agony will give a great heave and a scream and half rise out of a twitching
  mass of bodies, and then sink back again, exhausted and a little nearer
  death. And on each side they watch them like a cat watches a mouse. 'Tis not
  a nice affair &mdash; but 'tis no good pretending that this war is anything
  but hideous. 'Tis perhaps no one's fault &mdash; the difficulty of getting in
  those wounded &mdash; because it stands to reason one cannot have them
  wandering about between the trenches, seeing where sap-heads are, maybe, and
  getting an idea of the other fellow's trenches and the number of men that he
  has.</p>

  <p>"But there is one story, sir, that is almost the finest I have ever heard.
  Maybe you have heard it yourself &mdash; but it does not matter, for 'tis a
  story that bears the telling twice. There were wounded of both sides &mdash;
  us and them &mdash; between the trenches, and gradually they had all been
  brought in. Mistakes had occurred, 'tis true. Each side had plugged the
  others as they got out to pull them in, but people are jumpy up there, and
  guns go off quickly &mdash; and anyway both sides were equally to blame. They
  had them all in &mdash; all, that is, save one, and he was a German; wounded
  badly he was, and about half way between the two trenches. One of their lads
  getting out to bring him in was shot as dead as a doornail by a lad who was a
  bit jumpy, and then another one did the same thing. 'Twas bad, but those
  things will happen. Then suddenly one of our own officers &mdash; furious he
  was with our lads for shooting &mdash; he jumps up on the parapet and goes
  out. The Germans promptly plugged him &mdash; but they did not kill him
  &mdash; and he went on steadily straight to the wounded German. Both sides
  was watching, for they could not understand what was occurring. He reached
  the Boche and picks him up, and then he staggers on to the German trenches.
  And then they understood. 'Twas half out of the trenches both sides was in
  their excitement, roaring and cheering. He reached the Germans and handed him
  over to his own lads. Then he saluted; but 'twas not finished yet, for a
  German officer sprang out, and taking off his own Iron Cross, pinned it on
  the English officer. The Germans roared and cheered as he saluted again and
  turned back. 'Twas in the middle half way back that he lurched forward and
  fell, only to get up again and stagger on a few paces. Then he fell again,
  and did not rise, and some of our lads went out to bring him in. 'Twas dead
  that he was, and when they found it out they took off their hats for a
  moment, and stood still in the middle between the trenches. And the German
  officer and some men got up on the parapet to be after showing their respect
  for a brave man, while they carried him in.</p>

  <p>"'Tis perhaps those little touches of human nature," he went on after a
  pause, "that save us all from going mad up there. 'Tis terrible the strain,
  sir. I mind that after that terrible fighting in November, when they came out
  of the trenches, 'twas impossible to speak to some of the lads without their
  bursting out crying. 'Twas their nerves had all gone, and 'tis not that I
  would be surprised at it. But 'tis a terrible thing to see a great strong man
  suddenly start to sob like a little child, because you're after asking him
  the time. 'Tis almost funny it sounds, but 'tis to me the most terrible thing
  of all &mdash; more terrible far than death to look on.</p>

  <p>"'Twas those great shells did it a lot. The concussion if they burst near
  you was so terrible. It left you dazed like, and 'twas unable to control your
  hands or your legs at all that you were &mdash; trembling all over, and
  talking gibberish as like as not; and when you see a man like that, 'tis not
  a sight you will be forgetting.</p>

  <p>"I mind me once we were drawn up along a road. All the wagons and carts
  were there one behind the other, and 'twas myself that was in charge of them
  for the time being. Suddenly I saw an officer coming down the road; walking
  fast he was, first on one side and then on the other.</p>

  <p>"''Tis a strange appearance he has,' says I to myself, 'and 'tis in a
  hurry he seems to be.' With that he reaches the drivers of the first wagon,
  and asks them something. Terrible excited he was, almost running from one to
  the other; and very angry he seemed to be when they were unable to tell him.
  He goes on to the next wagon and does the same performance all over again;
  and when I sees the two first ones talking together and looking at him, I
  says to myself, I says, 'There's something queer, there is,' I says. ''Tis
  myself that will be finding out what is the matter at all.'</p>

  <p>"So up I goes, and I says to him, 'Can I do anything for you, sir?' I
  says, 'or what is it at all you would be wanting?'</p>

  <p>"''Tis a sergeant you are,' he says. 'The saints be praised, for 'tis no
  sense at all I can get from them damn fools,' and he points to the drivers.
  'Have you seen my men?' he goes on, 'for 'tis somewhere about here they
  should be.'</p>

  <p>"'What regiment, sir?' I says, for he was from the trenches, and covered
  with mud, and 'twas hard to see his badges.</p>

  <p>"'The Pimlico Peashooters,' he says, glaring at me. 'Don't stand there
  gaping at me like a stuck pig, you fool, or 'tis missing the train we'll be.
  'Tis Margate I have promised to take them to for a bathe, and to eat winkles
  with a pin.'</p>

  <p>"And then one of the men nearby started to laugh. 'Shoot that man!' he
  cries, and draws his revolver. Sure if I had not been quick, he would have
  done it, and it took three of us to get him quiet again. Then mercifully the
  doctor-man came up, and all was well. Mad he was, sir, absolutely mad. He
  thought he'd walked from Berlin, and he didn't even know there was a war on.
  Poor gentleman, 'tis hoping I am that he is all right again now &mdash; but I
  heard afterwards what had happened. 'Twas blown up the trench had been in
  which he was, and he was the only one who had escaped. Every man with him,
  all the other officers, had been blown to pieces, and he had been hurled
  about twenty yards by the explosion. Stunned he was, of course, and when he
  recovered his reason had gone. 'Twas a terrible sight to see."</p>

  <p>Sergeant Cassidy paused, and a far-away look came over his face. "It's
  thinking I am, sir," he said, after a pause, "though 'tis not much in my line
  to say these things &mdash; 'tis thinking I am that I would not change places
  with Kaiser Bill. 'Tis not the dead that will be troubling him at all &mdash;
  not them that are killed clean. But when the end comes, and he goes to join
  his fathers, will he be liking the burden he has to bear? Will he hear then
  the groaning curses of men writhing in their death-grip on the plains of
  Flanders? Will he see then the lads turning their glazing eyes to the
  Fatherland before they go out into the darkness? Will he live then through
  the hours when men, turning this way and that, scream to their officers to
  kill them and put them out of their misery and agony? What will that man
  feel, I am asking you, sir?</p>

  <p>"Will he see the women and the children watching through tearless staring
  eyes for steps they will never hear again? Will he hear those names &mdash;
  softly muttered through lips already half choked with the life-blood of the
  speakers &mdash; will he hear them, I says, and will they haunt him
  throughout eternity? I do not know, but I would not be him. 'Tis a sergeant I
  am, a poor Irishman from Ballygoyle, but as there is a God above, it's
  frightened I would be to have to face eternity with his little load. 'Twas he
  who started it &mdash; he or his son. I know not which, and faith! 'tis of
  little matter. But when the time comes and 'tis his time to cross the border,
  his time to go down the last long Vale, 'tis not alone he will be. Wailing
  beside him will be the bitter fearful curses of homes he has wrecked, of
  women, of children, of men writhing in their death-grip. Women left
  destitute, their men rigid, grinning, with eyes that do not see &mdash;
  children fatherless, mourning for men who went to their death singing the
  'Watch on the Rhine.' Drugged they were, and puppets &mdash; playthings of
  the great War Lord. Those curses, sir, will ring in his ears through
  eternity, till maybe a merciful God will give him oblivion and wipe him
  out."</p>

  <p>"You are right, Cassidy," I said quietly. "God knows the extent of his sin
  &mdash; God will decide the extent of his punishment; but, as you say, I
  would not be him."</p>

  <p>For a space we were silent, and in one's imagination one seemed to hear
  the zip of the maxims, the drone of the shells carrying on even then the work
  of death. But such thoughts are not good for soldiers. We are there to fight,
  not philosophise; to act, not to think.</p>

  <p>"I am going in three days, Cassidy," I said, as I got up. "Over yonder
  &mdash; with the new lads. Goodbye."</p>

  <p>"Goodbye, sir," he said, getting up, though I tried to prevent him. "We
  have been together before now, and we know one another. 'Tis good they will
  be, I know &mdash; but 'tis good they must be if they would live up to the
  reputation we have given them. 'Tis but remnants we have left of our original
  army, but there has never been anything in this world to beat it &mdash; and
  there never will be again. Goodbye, sir. Good luck."</p>
