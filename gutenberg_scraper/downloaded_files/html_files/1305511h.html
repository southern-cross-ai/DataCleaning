  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY ERNEST FUHR</h3>

  <h3>First published in <i>Everybody's Magazine</i>, March 1919</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">THERE is a certain Belgian village where in pre-war days the
  aristocracy of Belgium sojourned during the hot months of the summer.
  &ldquo;Village&rdquo; comes into the same category of mock-modest terms as
  &ldquo;cottage&rdquo; when it applies to the millionaire&rsquo;s residence.
  It lies in a fold of hills amid scenery of exceptional beauty. If any
  peasants ever lived in this &ldquo;village,&rdquo; they had long since
  departed. The chateaux were in the possession of Illustrious Members of the
  Great General Staff. The tents of their escorts, guards and servants
  sprinkled the hillside. Lines of motor-cars were parked in the pleasant
  little Place before the very modern Gothic Hotel de Ville, where a band
  played to a select and limited audience on three evenings a week.</p>

  <p>One morning a special train came to the station and a certain person in
  naval uniform alighted and was received with a guard of honor, and welcomed
  by innumerable military gentlemen with long shining swords and stiff
  back-bones.</p>

  <p>Within two hours of his arrival five machines of the Umpty-fourth
  Squadron, carrying a necessarily limited supply of bombs rose from the
  aerodrome and made a bee-line for this pleasant village. They crossed the
  first and second barrages without mishap, reached the open country and,
  disdaining such invitations as loaded troop-trains afforded, they pushed
  their way steadily to the happy valley, fought down the patrols which guarded
  the approaches to their objective and passing in single file immediately
  above a certain chateau, they left that once handsome house a haggard and
  blazing ruin.</p>

  <p>It was an interesting journey for Tam and Billy Best, who formed the crew
  of one machine, but the real interest began on the journey back, a
  circumstance which Tam had to some extent anticipated, for the last half of
  the journey northeastward had been across a country which was only revealed
  in patches.</p>

  <p>Billy Best shouted down the speaking-tube: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got three
  bombs left. Shall I drop &rsquo;em on a train?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam shook his head vigorously. &ldquo;Ma engine&rsquo;s knocking,&rdquo;
  roared his voice, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s a fog gathering&mdash;it would be
  no&rsquo; discreet to annoy the inhabitants.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The engine trouble was developing. He had lost sight of his companions in
  the mist and the ground was now hidden from sight. He consulted his map, his
  watch and his compass. Somewhere beneath him was a big straggling forest
  westward of which was a plain clear of fences and ditches and sunk roads,
  where a landing might be effected without much damage.</p>

  <p>He was some eighty miles behind the active front and if he could make a
  good landing in the fog there was at least a chance that he could put the
  engine right, for Tam was before all things a skilled mechanic.</p>

  <p>He brought his machine lower and lower, searching for the tree-tops, and
  presently he sighted what he knew were the outliers of the forest. Allowing
  himself a margin to clear the solitary trees which were a feature for a mile
  west of the forest, he planed down and made a good landing on a perfectly
  smooth patch of meadow-land which had been reclaimed from the arid
  plateau.</p>

  <p>The fog grew thicker, but this did not distress him. He had a rough idea
  where he had landed and the density of the mist would enable him to finish
  his work without fear of interruption.</p>

  <p>The two went to work to strip that part of the engine which was affected
  and for an hour they toiled incessantly. It was not the first landing which
  Tam had made in enemy country and to some degree it was not the worst. Their
  biggest danger was that his engines had been heard, but against this he put
  the fact that he had shut them off more than a mile from the place where he
  landed. His work finished, he set out to make a reconnaissance. Fastening the
  end of a big ball of string to the undercarriage of the machine, and taking
  another ball in his pocket, he paid out the string. He moved off in the
  direction he judged the road would lie.</p>

  <p>He had finished the first ball, had fastened it and was starting on the
  second when he heard the sound of horses hoofs within a dozen yards of him.
  He crouched down and listened. His knowledge of German was not particularly
  good, but from certain words, and especially the repetition of a certain
  illustrious name, he gathered that the raid had been more or less
  successful.</p>

  <p><a id="pic1"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>The horses passed and the rumble of the wagon they drew rolled away in the
  mist before he continued his progress through the fog. He reached the road,
  took his bearings and compared it with his map, tied a knot in the string so
  that he might judge the distance, and leaving the end on the ground he
  advanced cautiously down the road. The fog blotted out everything, but he had
  no difficulty in keeping to the paved causeway.</p>

  <p>Presently a building loomed ahead. It was a squat cottage which was
  apparently used as an estaminet. The door was fastened, the windows were
  shuttered. Tam consulted his map again. An estaminet was marked west-
  southwest of the forest. This must be it. It looked deserted and yet he had
  an uncanny feeling that it was occupied.</p>

  <p>He made a careful examination of the premises. Behind the cottage was a
  walled yard pierced by a door which had been left open. He slipped his
  automatic pistol from his pocket and stepped in. Access to the house from the
  yard was gained by a small door. He tried it and to his surprise it opened.
  He hesitated. His natural curiosity urged him forward, his as natural caution
  and the knowledge that there was nothing to be gained by continuing what was
  an idle search and a great deal to be lost if the house should be in the
  occupation of German soldiers or a German post, as it probably was, held him
  back.</p>

  <p>The fog would not lift for some time and it was necessary that he should
  know something more about the ground than he did know. There were two roads
  from the forest, one to the north and one to the south, which ran nearly
  parallel, and he was not certain which of the roads he was on. If he was on
  the northern road, then his machine was faced with a deep belt of scrub which
  might make an attempt to rise not only difficult but dangerous. If it was the
  southern road, as the estaminet on his map seemed to indicate, it was plain
  sailing.</p>

  <p>This might or might not be Le Coq d&rsquo;Or. It was up to him to make
  sure.</p>

  <p>He pushed the door open and stepped in with a light tread. He was in a
  room which was undoubtedly the outer room of an estaminet. There was nothing
  in the advertisements on the walls that gave him any information. He stepped
  across the room to a second door, turned the handle gently and opened it.
  Apparently it was untenanted. The only light -came from the back window which
  was half covered by a blanket.</p>

  <p>Tam took-a little electric lamp from his pocket&mdash;you need such things
  in clouds&mdash;and flashed it around the room. He took one glance, then
  stepped back quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come oot of that,&rdquo; he said sharply, &ldquo;come oot quick or
  I&rsquo;ll shoot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p><a id="pic2"
     name="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1305511h-images/Tam-VonTirpitz-02.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>There was a shuffle of feet and a man stepped slowly into the circle of
  light which the electric torch threw.</p>

  <p>To describe him as a scarecrow would be to overstate the attractions of a
  scarecrow. His clothes were rags, his bare knees showed grimly through the
  rents in his trousers, his hands were indistinguishable in hue from the rusty
  blue jacket. His chest was bare, for in place of a shirt he had a strip of
  what was once white sheeting wound in cummerbund fashion about his waist. Hut
  it was the man&rsquo;s face that left Tam speechless, his face and his head.
  His hair and beard were iron-gray, but one-half of his head had been shaved
  and one-half of his beard, the reverse half to that of the shaven portion of
  his head, had been clipped off.</p>

  <p>He peered forward at Tam. &ldquo;English?&rdquo; he said hoarsely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Scots,&rdquo; said Tam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank Gawd. I thought you was one of them Germans.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Between &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;Germans&rdquo; was a long string of
  unnecessary but pardonable words, singularly vivid and sanguine.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re English, I gather,&rdquo; said Tam. &ldquo;Who else is
  here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my own, sir,&rdquo; said the man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me, is this the Coq d&rsquo;Or?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right you are, sir,&rdquo; said the nondescript stranger;
  &ldquo;used to be kept by a Belgium till three days ago. They took him out
  and shot him. He&rsquo;s buried on the other side of the road.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come along wi&rsquo; me,&rdquo; said Tam and led the way back along
  the road, until he came to where the ball of string lay. By its aid he guided
  himself back to the airplane.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Speak softly,&rdquo; said Tam. &ldquo;Who arc ye and what are ye
  doing here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; said Billy, staring at the amazing spectacle,
  &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man grinned. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t very pretty, am I, sir? Name of
  Henry Burton, Port of London, able seaman of the <i>Wapping
  Queen</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But for the Lord&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said Tam, &ldquo;what did ye
  cut yer hair like that for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The eyes of Henry Burton hardened. &ldquo;They did it,&rdquo; he jerked
  his head eastward; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the sort of thing they do to a seaman.
  A U-boat off Ireland, sir. Because we defended ourselves with our
  nine-pounder, they tried us, me and the skipper and another feller, the only
  men left alive after the poor <i>Wapping Queen</i> went down. Said we had no
  right to shoot at a war- ship&mdash;not after she&rsquo;d torpedoed
  ours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam had heard of this barbarous treatment of sailor prisoners. &ldquo;How
  did you come here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I escaped, sir. I&rsquo;ve been six weeks getting across Germany,
  walking by night and sleeping by day. I got to this place and the Belgium hid
  me in the cellar. He was very good to escaped prisoners, that&rsquo;s why
  they shot him. Found him giving food to a French soldier that had got away.
  They didn&rsquo;t think to search the cellar or they&rsquo;d have got me,
  too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam looked at Billy and Billy looked at Tam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Weel?&rdquo; said Tam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t leave him here,&rdquo; said Billy. &ldquo;He can
  take the observer&rsquo;s seat in the cockpit. I&rsquo;ll sit behind
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Henry Burton turned his startled gaze on the two.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! me, sir,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;go up in an airyplane? Not
  me, sir. A ship I understand, and land, but the air I don&rsquo;t understand
  and don&rsquo;t hold with.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mon, ye&rsquo;re mad,&rdquo; said Tam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so mad that I&rsquo;ll go gallivanting about in the air.&rdquo;
  said Mr. Burton; &ldquo;no, I&rsquo;ll be all right, sir. You leave me alone.
  Give me a bit of grub, if you&rsquo;ve got any, and I&rsquo;ll find my way to
  Holland.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll find yeer way back to prison,&rdquo; said Tam.
  &ldquo;You do as ye&rsquo;re told, my mon. Get up into the seat and try it.
  &lsquo;Tis a bonny place and as safe as the Glasgow Limited.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hold with Glasgow nor anybody that sails from that
  port,&rdquo; said the obstinate Mr. Burton, &ldquo;with all due respect to
  you, sir, though from your talk I should say you were Irish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam argued with the man fiercely, but he was adamant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said Billy, approaching the pathetic figure,
  &ldquo;I give you my word that you&rsquo;ll be safe. I am an
  American.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in Americans,&rdquo; said Mr. Burton
  calmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you any brains?&rdquo; demanded the exasperated Billy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Mr. Burton, &ldquo;and 1 want to keep
  &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The fog was growing thinner. Tam knew that he had no time to waste. He was
  sure of his ground and knew that he would make a good getaway. He searched in
  his fusilage and took out a spare map he had of the north of France and
  Belgium.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You understand a chart, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye, sir,&rdquo; said the man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s yeer road. Ye&rsquo;re not on it noo.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He opened the little case in which he kept his emergency rations and
  cleared it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Put those in yeer pocket. They&rsquo;ll keep ye alive for a day or
  two,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I would give ye money but it&rsquo;s no use to
  ye. Besides, I&rsquo;ve got none. Are ye sure ye won&rsquo;t come?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is there anything else I can do for ye?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not asking too much, sir, I&rsquo;d like the loan of
  that little pistol of yours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tam handed over the weapon and explained its mechanism.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I might want it,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s been a
  party of soldiers up and down this road for the last few days looking for me.
  It might be very useful,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully. &ldquo;And if you get
  back and you meet any of my friends&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got no
  relations&mdash;tell them that Henry Burton of the <i>Wapping Queen</i>, late
  of Cabel Street, Whitechapel, was alive and well when last seen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook hands solemnly with the two men and turning, walked back to the
  road and the fog engulfed him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My, it&rsquo;s like sending a man to his death,&rdquo; said Billy
  and he spoke prophetically; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t we club him, Tam, and put him
  in the fusilage?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;d no like to be clubbing a man that is two heads bigger
  than mesel&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Tam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we&mdash;&rdquo; Billy stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>There was a sound of voices, one voice sharp, barking, peremptory and
  menacing. Billy gripped Tarn&rsquo;s arm and they listened. They heard the
  snick of breechblocks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Soldiers,&rdquo; whispered Tam; &ldquo;contact, Billy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He jumped up into the fusilage and Billy Best ran to the propellor. Before
  he could turn it, there was a shot. Tam recognized the sting of his
  automatic. There was another and a yell. Then three rifles crashed together.
  Billy swung the propellor round and with a roar the engine started and slowly
  the big scout machine dragged forward through the mist, gathering speed.</p>

  <p>Tam looked back. He saw a great bulky form blundering through the fog, saw
  it stiffen its arms and the quick flash of another explosion ere it fell
  heavily to the earth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Puir feller,&rdquo; said Tam to himself and turned his whole
  attention to his engine.</p>

  <p>The machine was still on the ground. The pace was increasing, but at any
  moment a tree or a high bush or a fence might leap out of the fog and crash
  him. He waited as long as he dared and then put the nose of the machine up
  and she rose swiftly and steeply. There was a breathless few seconds when a
  tree-top loomed up and vanished beneath them. Tam continued to climb. Such
  was the density of the fog belt that he did not reach blue sky until the
  altimeter showed six thousand feet. Beneath him was an unbroken plain of
  white woolly mist. He looked at his watch. The repairs had taken him longer
  than he had thought, but there were still three or four hours of daylight.
  The fog carried for seventy miles and there was no sign of a break. Tam was
  growing anxious, for he could not risk a landing in a machine which took the
  ground at sixty miles an hour on a country which he knew was broken by
  innumerable small fields.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It will thin out if we go on long enough, Tam,&rdquo; yelled Billy
  encouragingly and Tam grunted.</p>

  <p>He dropped lower into the fog, came down within a hundred feet of the
  ground and narrowly escaped collision with a tall chimney-stack.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was that Lille?&rdquo; roared Billy through the speaking-tube.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A dinna recognize the chimney-stack,&rdquo; said Tam, but his
  sarcasm was wasted, since Billy took him literally.</p>

  <p>The situation was becoming serious when of a sudden, as though some hand
  had cut the fog vertically from top to base, he dived out of the thin layer
  of mist through which he had been flying, into sunlight, and below him was
  the sea.</p>

  <p>There was no sign of land, no sign of ships, but the solution to his
  difficulty was a simple one. He had but to turn, flying low, and set a direct
  course eastward to strike a beach. He turned the machine sharply and planed
  down to within a hundred feet of the sea and steered by compass due east. He
  was farther out to sea than he had believed. He dived again into the wall of
  mist, but the water was plainly visible.</p>

  <p>Then of a sudden Billy Best, who had nothing to do but enjoy the view,
  gripped Tarn&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look, look!&rdquo; he yelled.</p>

  <p>Tam looked down. Right ahead of him and moving across his course was a
  long black ship. At first Tam thought it was a Belgian barge, and then:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A submarine!&rdquo; shouted Billy.</p>

  <p>The boat was awash and as the scout flashed across her Tam saw three men
  in her conning-tower and they were moving with some haste. He might be ten or
  fifty miles from the shore, he might have just sufficient juice to bring his
  machine safely to land, but here was an imperative duty and he swung his
  machine round and roared through the speaking-tube one word, and that word
  was: &ldquo;Bomb!&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Billy took a squint through the bombing-sight and gripped the release as
  Tam dipped down to the water. The bow of the submarine was already under
  water when Billy dropped the first bomb. It fell short by a dozen yards and
  Tam brought the airplane round in a circle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How many have ye?&rdquo; he shouted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two more,&rdquo; said the muffled voice of Billy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stand by,&rdquo; said Tam and dipped again.</p>

  <p>Only the conning-tower was above the water. Billy released the bomb and it
  fell just aft of the disappearing boat, throwing up a great column of water
  which sprayed the wings of the machine.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; said Billy.</p>

  <p>Again Tam turned. It was a race against time. Once the conning-tower was
  under water the chances of a vital hit were small. Tam dropped the machine
  lower still. He was not fifty feet above the last visible portion of the
  U-boat when the bomb dropped true.</p>

  <p>The roar of the explosion sounded even above the noise of the engine. The
  airplane was flung up into the air like a piece of paper. Tam made a
  desperate effort to right her, but the wings were under water before he could
  pancake.</p>

  <p>His first thought was of the submarine. Her bow had risen out of the
  water, so that it stood on end. The sea was covered with a yellow oily
  film.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On behalf of Henry Burton,&rdquo; said Tam, as he watched the hull
  drop out of sight.</p>

  <p>His own position was a perilous one. The sea, however, was calm, and the
  machine floated, though her engines were now under water.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can ye swim fifty miles?&rdquo; asked Tam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fifty-mile swim is one of my hobbies,&rdquo; said Billy.</p>

  <p>He took from his pocket a large stick of candy, broke it exactly in half,
  and handed Tam his portion.</p>

  <p>Tam took it in silence. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a horrible thought,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a horrible thought?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That two flyin&rsquo; men, or one and a half flyin&rsquo;
  men,&rdquo; he corrected, &ldquo;should be drowned eatin&rsquo;
  toffee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you rather be drowned smoking a cigar? Because I&rsquo;ve got
  two.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;ll reserve that for the last agony,&rdquo; said Tam, and
  tested it conventionally. &ldquo;I could have wished that it were a Havana or
  an El Dorado, or one of the expensive brands that the lower-class
  millionaires smoke.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Presently Billy asked again: &ldquo;How far do you think we are from land,
  Tam? Quit fooling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A verra long way, A think,&rdquo; said Tam seriously; &ldquo;that
  U-boat wouldn&rsquo;t have been close in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very foggy,&rdquo; suggested Billy.</p>

  <p>Tam nodded. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s that chance,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>It was after sunset when rescue came. Out of the thin mist grew a big
  black ship, steaming slowly. Tam took his signal pistol from his pocket,
  fitted a cartridge and shot a Verey light into the air. They were near enough
  to see thousands of figures crowding the deck.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a transport,&rdquo; cried Billy; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
  stopping.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, aye,&rdquo; said Tam.</p>

  <p>He had nearly reached the end of his cigar, but what was more important,
  the airplane was exhausting her last units of buoyancy. They saw the boat
  lowered away and the cream of foam as her engines went astern.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gee, Tam, it&rsquo;s been a great day,&rdquo; said Billy;
  &ldquo;bombing von Tirpitz in the morning and his old murder boat in the
  afternoon&mdash;and by jiminy!&rdquo; he stood up at some risk and his fresh
  young voice rose in one joyous yell, &ldquo;A transport, Tam; and look at the
  flag! It&rsquo;s Old Glory. Tam! It&rsquo;s the greatest flag in the world,
  boy! Whoop! Do you see the flag, Tam? The flag that stands for God&rsquo;s
