  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE COMING OF THE STAFF</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Bill came back for long-leave that autumn half, he had
  before him a complicated programme of entertainment. Thomas, the keeper, whom
  he revered more than anyone else in the world, was to take him in the
  afternoon to try for a duck in the big marsh called Alemoor. In the evening
  Hallowe'en was to be celebrated in the nursery with his small brother Peter,
  and he was to be permitted to come down to dinner, and to sit up afterwards
  until ten o'clock. Next day, which was Sunday, would be devoted to wandering
  about with Peter, hearing from him all the appetising home news, and pouring
  into his greedy ears the gossip of the foreign world of school. On Monday
  morning, after a walk with the dogs, he was to motor to London, lunch with
  Aunt Alice, and then, after a noble tea, return to school in time for
  lock-up.</p>

  <p>This seemed to Bill to be all that could be desired in the way of
  excitement. But he did not know just how exciting that long-leave was
  destined to be.</p>

  <p>The first shadow of a cloud appeared after luncheon, when he had changed
  into knickerbockers and Thomas and the dogs were waiting by the gun-room
  door. Bill could not find his own proper stick. It was a long hazel staff,
  given him by the second stalker at Glenmore the year before&mdash;a staff
  rather taller than Bill, a glossy hazel, with a shapely polished crook, and
  without a ferrule, like all good stalking-sticks.</p>

  <p>He hunted for it high and low, but it could not be found. Without it in
  his hand Bill felt that the expedition lacked something vital, and he was not
  prepared to take instead one of his father's shooting-sticks, as Groves, the
  butler, recommended. Nor would he accept a knobbly cane proffered by Peter.
  Feeling a little aggrieved and imperfectly equipped, he rushed out to join
  Thomas. He would cut himself an ashplant in the first hedge.</p>

  <p>In the first half-mile he met two magpies, and this should have told him
  that something was going to happen. It is right to take off your cap to a
  single magpie, or to three, or to five, but never to an even number, for an
  even number means mischief. But Bill, looking out for ashplants, was
  heedless, and had uncovered his head before he remembered the rule.</p>

  <p>Then, as he and Thomas ambled down the lane which led to Alemoor, they
  came upon an old man sitting under a hornbeam.</p>

  <p>This was the second warning, for of course a hornbeam is a mysterious
  tree. Moreover, though there were hornbeams in Bill's garden, they did not
  flourish elsewhere in that countryside. Had Bill been on his guard he would
  have realised that the hornbeam had no business there, and that he had never
  seen it before. But there it was, growing in a grassy patch by the side of
  the lane, and under it sat an old man.</p>

  <p>He was a funny little wizened old man, in a shabby long green overcoat
  which had once been black; and he wore on his head the oldest and tallest and
  greenest bowler hat that ever graced a human head. It was quite as tall as
  the topper which Bill wore at school. Thomas, who had a sharp eye for
  poachers and vagabonds, did not stop to question him, but walked on as if he
  did not see him&mdash;which should have warned Bill that something queer was
  afoot. Also Gyp, the spaniel, and Shawn, the Irish setter, at the sight of
  him dropped their tails between their legs and remembered an engagement a
  long way off.</p>

  <p>But Bill stopped, for he saw that the old man had a bundle under his arm,
  a bundle of ancient umbrellas and odd, ragged sticks.</p>

  <p>The old man smiled at him, and he had eyes as bright and sharp as a
  bird's. He seemed to know what was wanted, for he at once took a stick from
  his bundle. You would not have said that it was the kind of stick that Bill
  was looking for. It was short and heavy, and made of some dark foreign wood;
  and instead of a crook it had a handle shaped like a crescent, cut out of a
  white substance which was neither bone nor ivory. Yet Bill, as soon as he saw
  it, felt that it was the one stick in the world for him.</p>

  <p>"How much?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"One farthing," said the old man, and his voice squeaked like a winter
  wind in a chimney.</p>

  <p>Now a farthing is not a common coin, but Bill happened to have one&mdash;a
  gift from Peter on his arrival that day, along with a brass cannon, five
  empty cartridges, a broken microscope, and a badly-printed,
  brightly-illustrated narrative called <i>Two Villains Foiled</i>. Peter was a
  famous giver.</p>

  <p>A farthing sounded too little, so Bill proffered one of his scanty
  shillings.</p>

  <p>"I said one farthing," said the old man rather snappishly.</p>

  <p>The coin changed hands, and the little old man's wizened face seemed to
  light up with an elfin glee.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a fine stick, young sir," he squeaked; "a noble stick, when you gets
  used to the ways of it."</p>

  <p>Bill had to run to catch up Thomas, who was plodding along with the dogs,
  now returned from their engagement.</p>

  <p>"That's a queer chap&mdash;the old stick-man, I mean," he said.</p>

  <p>"I ain't seen no old man, Maaster Bill," said Thomas. "What be 'ee talkin'
  about?"</p>

  <p>"The fellow back there. I bought this stick from him."</p>

  <p>They both looked back, but there was no sign of any old man in the green
  lane. Indeed, if Bill had not been so absorbed in his purchase, he would have
  noticed that there was no sign of the hornbeam either. The lane ran bare
  between stone walls up to the hill pastures.</p>

  <p>Thomas cast a puzzled glance at the stick.</p>

  <p>"That be a craafty stick, Maaster Bill&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But he said no more, for Bill had shaken it playfully at the dogs. As soon
  as they saw it they went off to keep another urgent engagement&mdash;this
  time apparently with a long-distance hare&mdash;and Thomas was yelling and
  whistling for ten minutes before he brought them to heel.</p>

  <p>It was a soft, grey afternoon, and Bill was stationed beside one of the
  deep dykes on the moor, well in cover of a thorn bush, while Thomas and the
  dogs departed on a circuit to show themselves beyond the big mere, so that
  the duck might move in Bill's direction. It was rather cold, and very wet
  under foot, for a lot of rain had fallen in the past week, and the mere,
  which was usually only a sedgy pond, had now grown to a great expanse of
  shallow flood-water.</p>

  <p>Bill began his vigil in high excitement. He drove his new stick into the
  ground, and used the handle as a seat, while he rested his gun in the
  orthodox way in the crook of his arm. It was a double-barrelled 16-bore, and
  Bill knew that he would be lucky if he got a duck with it; but a duck was to
  him a bird of mystery, true wild game, and he preferred the chance of one to
  the certainty of many rabbits.</p>

  <p>The minutes passed, the grey afternoon sky darkened towards twilight, but
  no duck came. Bill saw a wedge of geese high up in the air and longed to
  salute them. Also he heard snipe, but he could not locate them in the dim
  weather. There seemed to be redshank calling, too, which had no business
  there, for they should have been on the shore marshes. Far away he thought he
  detected the purring noise which Thomas made to stir the duck, but no
  overhead beat of wings followed.</p>

  <p>It was so very quiet down there by the dyke that Bill began to feel eerie.
  The mood of eager anticipation died away, and he grew rather despondent. He
  would have been bored if he had not been slightly awed. He scrambled up the
  bank of the dyke and strained his eyes over the mere between the bare boughs
  of the thorn. He thought he saw duck moving. Yes, he was certain of
  it&mdash;they were coming from the direction of Thomas and the dogs. But they
  were not coming to him, and he realised what was happening. There was far too
  much water on the moor, and the birds, instead of flighting across the mere
  to the boundary slopes, were simply settling on the flood. From the misty
  waters came the rumour of many wildfowl.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE ADVENTURE OF ALEMOOR</h2>

  <p class="first">BILL came back to his wet stand grievously disappointed. He
  did not dare to leave it in case a flight did appear, but he had lost all
  hope. Gone now was the expectation of flourishing triumphantly a mallard, or
  a brace of mallard, before the sceptical eyes of his father and the admiring
  face of Peter. He tried to warm his feet by moving them up and down on the
  squelching turf, but his toes were icy and his boots were leaden. His gun was
  now under his arm, and he was fiddling idly with the handle of the stick, the
  point of which was embedded in the soil.</p>

  <p>He made it revolve, and as it turned he said aloud&mdash;Bill had a trick
  of talking to himself&mdash;"I wish I was in the middle of the big
  flood."</p>

  <p>Then a wonderful thing happened. Bill was not conscious of any movement,
  but suddenly his surroundings were completely changed. He had still his gun
  under his left arm and the stick in his right hand, but instead of standing
  on wet turf he was up to the waist in water.... And all around him were
  duck&mdash;shoveller, pintail, mallard, teal, widgeon, pochard,
  tufted&mdash;and bigger things that might be geese&mdash;swimming or diving
  or just alighting from the air.</p>

  <p>Bill in his confusion understood one thing only, that his wish had been
  granted. He was in the very middle of the flood-water, and his one thought
  was how to take advantage of it.</p>

  <p>He fired right and left at mallard, missing with his first barrel. Then
  the birds rose in alarm and he shoved in fresh cartridges and blazed wildly
  into the brown. His next two shots were at longer range, but he was certain
  that he had hit something. And then the duck vanished in the gloom, and he
  was left alone with the grey waters running out to the shadows.</p>

  <p>He lifted up his voice and shouted wildly for Thomas and the dogs. He had
  got two anyhow&mdash;a mallard drake and a young teal, and he collected them.
  Then he saw something black about six yards off, and wading towards it he
  picked up a second mallard.</p>

  <p>He stopped to listen, but the world had suddenly gone deathly quiet. Not a
  sound could be heard of Thomas whistling or the splashing of Gyp, the
  spaniel. He shouted again and again, but no answer came. The night seemed to
  make a thick curtain which blanketed his voice. Bill's moment of triumph
  began to change into acute fear.</p>

  <p>Presently he discovered something which scared him worse. The flood waters
  were rising. The sluggish river Ale, which fed the mere, would be bringing
  down the rains from the hills. Bill knew what Alemoor could be when the
  floods were really out&mdash;a lake a mile or two in circumference, with
  twenty feet of water on what in summer were dry pastures. He realised very
  plainly that, unless he could get out before the floods deepened, he stood a
  very good chance of being drowned.</p>

  <p>He had often been frightened in his life before, but he had never felt
  such panic as this. The trouble was that he did not know where the deeper
  mere lay&mdash;he had not a notion which was the quickest road to the dry
  land. But even in his fright he remembered his trophies. He had some string
  in his pocket, and he tied the three duck together so that he could hang them
  round his neck. Then he started plunging wildly in the direction from which
  he thought he had come.</p>

  <p>The water was up to his armpits, and the draggled duck nearly choked him.
  Every now and then he would sink to his chin. Then suddenly he found himself
  soused over the head, and all but the last foot of his gun-barrel under
  water.</p>

  <p>Bill, being a wet-bob at school, could swim, but swimming was impossible
  unless he dropped stick and gun, and even in his panic he would not
  relinquish his possessions. He trod water, and managed to struggle a yard or
  two till he found footing again and could get his breath. He was on some kind
  of mound or tussock of grass, and very warily he tried to feel his way
  forward. The ground rose beneath him and he found himself clear above the
  waist.</p>

  <p>He halted for a moment to take a grip upon his fluttering nerves. In front
  of him lay floods, the colour of lead in the near distance and of ink beyond.
  The night had fallen and it would soon be black darkness.</p>

  <p>Worse, the waters were still rising. Where he stood he felt them sucking
  every second a little higher up on his shivering body.... He lost hope and
  cried in a wild panic for Thomas. Then the tears came, unwilling tears, for
  Bill was not given to weeping. He felt horribly feeble, and would have fallen
  had he not leant on the stick, which was now deep beneath him in the quaking
  mire.</p>

  <p>The stick! The stick had brought him there&mdash;could not the stick take
  him back? What had he done with it before? ... He had twirled it and wished.
  He could not think clearly, but surely that was what had happened.... Bill's
  numb fingers with difficulty made the point turn in the mud. "Oh, I wish I
  were with Thomas," he sobbed....</p>

  <p>He was with Thomas. He found himself sitting in about a foot of water,
  with Shawn, the Irish setter, licking his face. Thomas himself was as
  shapeless as a bush in the darkness, but he had taken hold of Bill's arm and
  was helping him to rise.</p>

  <p>"Where in goodness ha' ye been, Maaster Bill?" the astounded keeper
  ejaculated. "Them ducks was tigglin' out to the deep water, and I was feared
  ye wouldn't get a shot. Three on 'em, no less! My word, ye 'ave poonished
  'em."</p>

  <p>"I was in the deep water," said Bill, but he could say no more, for all
  strength seemed suddenly to go from him. He felt himself being lifted in
  Thomas's arms and carried up the bank. After that he was not very clear what
  happened. Thomas had taken his gun from him and relieved him of the ducks,
  but nothing would relax his clutch on the stick.</p>

  <p>The evening's plan of entertainment was not carried out. There were no
  Hallowe'en festivities in the nursery, and Bill did not sit up for dinner.
  How he got home he never knew, but Thomas must have carried or dragged him up
  to the nearest farm, for he had a dim sense of being driven in a farmer's
  gig. He had no chance of exhibiting his bag to the family, even if he had had
  the strength, for he was promptly seized by an agitated mother and plunged
  into a hot bath with mustard in it. Then he was given something hot to drink.
  After that he knew nothing till he awoke late next morning, perfectly well,
  very hungry, but in every limb stiff as a poker.</p>

  <p>He was not allowed to get up until just before luncheon, and, since Peter
  had been haled to church, he was left to his own thoughts. He was glad of
  that, for he wanted to be alone to think things out.</p>

  <p>It was plain that a miracle had happened, a miracle connected with the
  stick. He had wished himself in the middle of the floodwater&mdash;he
  remembered that clearly&mdash;and at the time he had been doing something to
  the stick. What was it? It had been stuck in the ground and he had been
  playing with the handle. Yes, he had it! He had been turning it round when he
  uttered the wish.</p>

  <p>Then the awful moments in the middle of the flood came back to him, but
  now he regarded them without horror. He had done the same thing there. He had
  turned the stick round and spoken his wish, and in a second had found himself
  with Thomas.... There was no doubt about it. Here was magic, and he was its
  master. Bill's mind was better stored with fairy-tales than with Latin and
  Greek, and he remembered many precedents.</p>

  <p>He had a spasm of anxiety about the stick. The family were still at
  church, and he must make sure that it was safe, so he slipped on his
  dressing-gown and tiptoed downstairs to the hall, where he found it in the
  rack. He carried it up with him and hid it in the bottom of his playbox; so
  precious a thing could not be left to the dangerous inquisition of Peter.</p>

  <p>He was very quiet at luncheon, but he ate so heartily and looked so well
  that his mother's fears were dissipated. He was very quiet, too, at tea, and
  to his family's astonishment he volunteered to go to evening church, which
  would give him a chance for reflection. His conduct there was exemplary, for
  while Peter at his side had his usual Sunday attack of St. Vitus's dance,
  Bill sat motionless as a mummy. On the way home his mother commented on it,
  and observed that Lower Chapel seemed to have taught him how to behave. But
  his thoughts during the service had not been devotional.</p>

  <p>The stick lay beside him on the floor, and for a moment he had had a wild
  notion of twisting it during the Litany and disappearing for a few minutes to
  Kamschatka. Then prudence supervened. He must go very cautiously in this
  business, and court no questions. He would take the stick back to school and
  hide it in his room. He had a qualm when he thought what a "floater" it would
  be if a lower boy appeared with it in public. For him no more hours of
  boredom. School would no longer be a place of exile, but a rapturous holiday.
  He might slip home now and then and see what was happening&mdash;he would go
  often to Glenmore&mdash;he would visit any spot on the globe which took his
  fancy. His imagination reeled at the prospect, and he cloaked his chortles of
  delight in a fervent Amen.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLOMON ISLANDS</h2>

  <p class="first">NEXT morning, which was Monday, Bill awoke about an hour
  before dawn. This was not his usual custom, but he had gone to sleep so full
  of exciting thoughts that sleep did not altogether break their continuity. He
  lay for a while thinking. Before he could be quite sure of the powers of the
  new staff he must make another experiment, an experiment in cold blood,
  well-considered, premeditated. There was time for it before the family
  breakfast at nine.</p>

  <p>He put on fives-shoes and a dressing-gown, got the stick out of the
  playbox, and tiptoed downstairs. He heard a housemaid moving in the direction
  of the dining-room and Groves opening the library shutters, but the hall was
  deserted. There was a garden door in the hall, of which the upper part was
  glass and now heavily shuttered. As quietly as he could, Bill undid the
  fastenings, wrestled with the key, and emerged into the foggy winter
  half-light.</p>

  <p>It was bitterly cold, but it seemed to Bill essential that the experiment
  should be made out of doors, for there might be trouble if he appeared
  suddenly in the night-nursery on his return and confronted the eyes of Peter
  or Elsie. So he padded down the lawn to a retired half-moon of shrubbery
  beside the pond. His shoes were soon soaked with hoar-frost, and a passing
  dawn wind made him shiver and draw his dressing-gown around him. He had
  decided where to go, for in this kind of weather he yearned for heat. He
  plunged his stick in the turf.</p>

  <p>"I want to be on the beach in the Solomon Islands," said Bill, and three
  times twisted the handle....</p>

  <p>His eyes seemed to dazzle with an excess of light, and something beat on
  his body like a blast from an open furnace.... Then he realised that he was
  standing on an expanse of blinding white sand, which a lazy blue sea was
  licking. Half a mile out were what looked like reefs, with a creamy crest of
  spindrift. Behind him, at a distance of perhaps two hundred yards, was a belt
  of high green forest out of which stuck a tall feather of palms. A hot wind
  was blowing and tossing the tree-tops, but it only crisped the farther sea
  and did not break the mirror of the lagoon.</p>

  <p>Bill gasped for joy to find his dream fulfilled. He was in the Far
  Pacific, where he had always longed to be. In the forest behind him there
  must be all kinds of wonderful fruits and queer beasts and birds. He
  calculated that he had nearly an hour to spend, and might at any rate
  penetrate the fringes of its green mysteries.</p>

  <p>But in the meantime he was very hot and could not endure the weight of
  winter pyjamas and a winter dressing-gown. Also he longed to bathe in those
  inviting waters. So he shed everything and hopped gaily down to the tide's
  edge, leaving the stick still upright in the sand.</p>

  <p>The sea felt as delicious as it looked, but Bill, though a good swimmer,
  kept near the edge for fear of sharks. This was very different from the chill
  flood-waters of Alemoor. He looked down through blue depths to a floor like
  marble, and the water was a caress. Bill wallowed and splashed, with the
  fresh salt smell, which he loved, in his nostrils.</p>

  <p>By and by he ventured a little farther out, and floated on his back,
  looking up at the pale, hot sky. For a little he was unconscious of the
  passage of time, as he drifted on the aromatic tide. Then he saw a little
  reef close at hand, and was just on the point of striking out for it when he
  cast a glance back towards the shore.</p>

  <p>Bill got the fright of his life, for at the edge of the forest stood
  men&mdash;dark-skinned men&mdash;armed with spears. He had forgotten that
  these islands might have other things in them besides strange fruits and
  birds and beasts.</p>

  <p>They had halted and were looking at his stick, but apparently they had not
  yet seen him. Supposing they got the stick, what on earth would happen? With
  a fluttering heart Bill made for the shore.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was in shallow water the men caught sight of him and moved
  forward. He was perhaps fifty yards from the stick, which cast its long
  morning shadow on the sand, and they were two hundred yards on the farther
  side. At all costs he must get to it first. He sprang out of the sea, and as
  he ran he saw to his horror that the men ran also&mdash;ran in great bounds,
  shouting and brandishing their spears.</p>

  <p>His little naked body scurried up the sand. The fifty yards seemed miles,
  and it was an awful thing to run towards those savage faces and not away from
  them. Bill felt his legs giving way beneath him, as in his nightmares, when
  he had found himself on a railway track with an express approaching and could
  scarcely move. But he ran faster than he thought, and before he knew had laid
  a quivering hand on the stick.</p>

  <p>No time to put on his clothes. He managed to grab his dressing-gown with
  one hand and the stick with the other, and as he twirled the handle a spear
  whizzed by his ear.</p>

  <p>"I want to be home," he gasped, and the next second he stood naked between
  the shrubbery and the pond, clutching his dressing-gown. The Solomon
  Islanders had got his pyjamas and his fives-shoes, and I wonder what they
  made of them!</p>

  <p>The cold of a November morning brought him quickly to his senses. He
  clothed his shivering body in his dressing-gown and ran by devious paths to
  the house. But this time the hall was clearly not for him. Happily the
  gun-room door was unlocked, and he was able to ascend by way of empty
  passages and back-stairs to the nursery floor.</p>

  <p>He did not, however, escape the eagle eye of Elsie, the nurse, who read a
  commination service over a boy who went out of doors imperfectly clad on such
  a morning. She prophesied pneumonia and plumped him into a hot bath.</p>

  <p>Bill applied his tongue to the back of his hand. Yes, it tasted salt, and
  the salt smell was still in his nose. It had not been a dream.... He hugged
  himself in the bath and made strange gurgling sounds of joy. The experiment
  had been brilliantly successful, and the magic of the staff was amply proved.
  But he must go carefully, very carefully. He had suddenly an awful
  reminiscence of fearsome black faces and bloodshot eyes.</p>

  <p>Events that morning did not go according to programme. There was no walk
  with the dogs, for Bill was in disgrace. Elsie wailed for lost pyjamas, of
  which he could give no account. Under cross-examination he was, as the
  newspapers say, reticent. He avoided Peter and spent the time before
  departure in wrapping up his new stick in many layers of brown paper and
  tying it firmly with string. In this way he thought he might safely carry it
  back to school.</p>

  <p>But in the bustle of leaving it was somehow left behind, and Bill only
  discovered his loss when he was half-way to London. The discovery put him
  into a fever of anxiety. He could not go back for it, and there was the awful
  risk that in his absence Peter or Groves or some other interfering person
  might monkey with it. Or it might get lost. Deep gloom settled upon his
  spirit. At luncheon he was so morose that Aunt Alice, who had strong and
  unorthodox views about education, observed that he seemed to be a clear proof
  that the public school system was a failure.</p>

  <p>Without the stick there were none of the delights for Bill over which he
  had gloated in church. His first idea was to have it sent to him, but that
  seemed too risky. In the past various parcels, despatched by rail or post,
  had gone astray. Nor was there the chance of a visit from someone at home,
  for his mother and father and Peter presently went up to London for several
  weeks.</p>

  <p>So Bill wrote to Groves, the butler, a very ill-spelt letter, demanding
  that he should find the brown paper parcel and put it securely in his
  playbox. He enclosed one of his scanty stamps for a reply. It was four days
  before the answer came, and it did something to relieve Bill's anxiety. The
  parcel had been found&mdash;awful thought! in Peter's playbox&mdash;and
  Groves had duly stowed it away as directed. Bill breathed freely again.</p>

  <p>But the last weeks of that half lacked gaiety. His disappointment died
  away, but he had many spasms of anxiety. He counted the days to the Christmas
  holidays.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE ADVENTURE OF GLENMORE</h2>

  <p class="first">ON the 19th day of December Bill returned from school in
  time for luncheon. Never before had he looked forward so wildly to getting
  home again. He greeted his mother with the most perfunctory caress, dodged
  Peter, and rushed upstairs to his play-box. Thank Heaven, the stick was
  safely there! He tore off the brown paper wrappings and carried it down to
  the gun-room, where he put it in a special place beside his 16-bore.</p>

  <p>It being the first day of holiday, according to fashion the afternoon was
  spent in a family walk. It was decided that Bill and Peter should set off
  together and should join the others at a place called the Roman Camp. "Let
  the boys have a chance of being alone," his father said.</p>

  <p>This exactly suited Bill's book, and as they left the dining-room he
  clutched his small brother. "Shrimp," he said in his ear, "you are going to
  have the afternoon of your life."</p>

  <p>It was a bright, mild day, with the leafless woods and the brown
  plough-lands lit by a pale December sun. Peter, as he trotted beside him,
  jerked out breathless enquiries about what Bill proposed to do, and was told
  to wait and see. Their sister's dog had joined them. This was a cairn terrier
  called Catsbane, because of his extraordinary dislike for cats, and he did
  not often honour the boys with his company. He was much beloved by Barbara,
  and Peter felt a certain responsibility for his conduct, and was always
  yelling and whistling him to heel.</p>

  <p>Arrived at a clump of beeches which promised privacy, Bill first swore his
  brother to secrecy with the most awful oaths that he could imagine.</p>

  <p>"Put your arm round my waist and hang on to my belt," he told him. "I'm
  going to take you to have a look at Glenmore."</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly," said Peter. "That only happens in summer, and besides we
  haven't packed yet."</p>

  <p>"Shut up and hold tight," said Bill.</p>

  <p>But at the last moment anxiety for Catsbane overcame Peter; and so it
  befell that as Bill twirled the stick and spoke the necessary words, Peter
  was clutching Catsbane's collar....</p>

  <p>The boys were looking not at the smooth boles of beeches, but at a little
  coppice of rowans and birches above the narrow glen of a hill burn. It was
  Glenmore in very truth. There was the strip of mossy lawn and the whitewashed
  gable-end of the lodge; there to the left, beside the walled garden, was the
  smoking chimney of the head stalker's cottage; there beyond the trees was the
  long lift of brown moorland and the peak of Stob Ghabhar. Stob Ghabhar had
  snow on its summit, which the boys had never seen before. To them Glenmore
  was the true home of the soul, but they knew it only in the glory of late
  summer and early autumn. In its winter dress it seemed for a moment strange.
  Then the sight of an old collie waddling across the lawn gave the connecting
  link.</p>

  <p>"There's Wattie," Peter gasped, and lifted up his voice in an excited
  summons.</p>

  <p>His brother promptly scragged him. "Don't be an ass, Shrimp," he said
  fiercely. "This is a secret, you fathead. This is magic. Nobody must know we
  are here. Come on and explore."</p>

  <p>But Wattie had seen Catsbane, and the two dogs held high converse
  together. In the autumn they had always been friends. Catsbane was a proud
  animal and would have nothing to do with the retrievers or the stable
  terrier, but for some reason or another he was partial to Wattie. The two
  went off down the burnside.</p>

  <p>"Here, this'll never do," said Peter. "Catsbane may not come back till
  to-morrow morning&mdash;he's done it before."</p>

  <p>But there was no help for it, for the dogs had already disappeared in the
  thicket, and the boys were too full of excitement to have much care for the
  future. For an hour&mdash;it must have been an hour, Bill calculated
  afterwards, but it seemed like ten minutes&mdash;they visited their favourite
  haunts. They found the robber's cave in the glen where a raven nested, and
  the pool where Bill had got his first big trout, and the stretch of the river
  from which their father that year had had the 30-pound salmon. Then they
  dipped into the big fir wood which clothed the hillside. There were no
  blaeberries or crowberries now, but there were many woodcock. After that Bill
  had a shot with his catapult at a wicked old blackcock on a peat-stack. Then
  they found Wattie the collie, who had shaken himself loose from Catsbane, and
  induced him to make a third in the party.</p>

  <p>Peter moaned about Catsbane. "What'll we say to Barbara? He's lost
  now&mdash;we'll never get him back."</p>

  <p>But Bill only said, "Confound the beastly pup," and had a shot at a stray
  pheasant.</p>

  <p>All their motions were as stealthy as an Indian's, and the climax of the
  adventure was reached when they shed Wattie, climbed the garden wall, and
  looked in at the window of the keeper's cottage.</p>

  <p>Tea was laid before a bright peat fire in the parlour, so Mrs. Macrae must
  be expecting company. It looked a very good tea, for there were scones and
  pancakes and shortbread and currant loaf and heather honey. Both boys
  suddenly felt famished at the sight.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Macrae always gives me a scone and honey," Peter bleated. "I'm
  hungry. I want one."</p>

  <p>So did Bill. His soul longed for food, but he kept hold of his prudence.
  "We dare not show ourselves," he whispered. "But perhaps we might pinch a
  scone. It would not be stealing, for if Mrs. Macrae saw us she'd say, 'Come
  awa in, laddies, and get a jeely piece.' I'll give you a back, Shrimp, and in
  you get."</p>

  <p>The window was opened, and Peter was hoisted through, falling with a bang
  on a patchwork rug. But he never reached the table, for at that moment the
  parlour door opened and someone entered.</p>

  <p>After that things happened fast. Peter, urged by Bill's anguished whisper,
  turned back to the window and was hauled through by the scruff of the neck. A
  woman's voice was heard crying&mdash;"Mercy on us, it's the bairns!" as the
  culprits darted into the shelter of the gooseberry bushes.</p>

  <p>Bill realised that there was no safety in the garden, so he dragged Peter
  over the wall by the way they had come, thereby seriously damaging a pear
  tree. But they had been observed, and, as they scrambled out of a rose bed,
  they heard cries, and saw Mrs. Macrae appearing round the end of the wall,
  having come through the stable-yard. Also a figure, which looked like Angus
  the river gillie, was running from the same direction.</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but to go. Bill seized Peter with one hand and
  the stick with the other and spoke the words, with Angus not six yards
  away.... As he looked once more at the familiar beech boles, his ears were
  still filled with the cries of an excited woman and the frenzied barking of
  Wattie the collie.</p>

  <p>The two boys, very warm and flustered, and rather scratched about the
  hands and legs, confronted their father and mother and their sister Barbara,
  who was eighteen and very proud.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, hullo!" they heard their father say. "I thought you were hiding
  somewhere hereabouts. You young rascals know how to take cover, for you
  seemed to spring out of the ground. You look as if you had been playing
  football. Better walk home with us and cool down.... Bless my soul, Peter,
  what's that you have got? It's bog myrtle! Where on earth did you find it? I
  have never seen it before in Oxfordshire!"</p>

  <p>Then Barbara raised a ladylike voice. "Oh, Mummie, look at the mess
  they've made of themselves! They've been among the brambles. Peter has two
  holes in his stocking. Just look at Bill's hands!" And she wrinkled her
  finical nose and sniffed.</p>

  <p>Bill kept a diplomatic silence, and Peter, usually garrulous, did the
  same, for his small wrist was in his brother's savage clutch.</p>

  <p>Then Barbara bethought herself of Catsbane. "Where's my dog?" she cried.
  "You know he started out with you. You wretched boys have lost him!"</p>

  <p>There was a great hunt for Catsbane, but of course he could not be found.
  "I know where he is," said Barbara bitterly. "He's gone down to Johnson's
  farm and has probably by this time killed twenty chickens. Or he's at the
  badger's earth in Yewbarrow wood."</p>

  <p>Bill's desperate grip only just prevented Peter from laughing.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE ADVENTURE OF CATSBANE</h2>

  <p class="first">TEA was a difficult meal. Peter was in a state of high
  excitement, gurgling to himself and casting secret conspiratorial glances at
  Bill, which Barbara intercepted. Barbara was in distress about her dog, and
  she read in Peter's behaviour some guilty knowledge of its whereabouts. She
  cross-examined him severely, but Peter only giggled, and Barbara became very
  cross indeed.</p>

  <p>Bill realised that something must be done about Catsbane, and done at
  once. If he were left loose in the Highlands he would be found, and people
  would naturally enquire what had suddenly shifted a cairn terrier five
  hundred miles farther north. So he fled from Peter and sought the darkness of
  the garden, twirled the stick, and wished himself at Glenmore....</p>

  <p>He ought to have wished himself where Catsbane was, but the idea never
  occurred to him. Where he asked to be was the vicinity of the house of
  Hector, the second stalker, which was behind the kennels. He had seen the
  terrier moving in that direction, and it used to be a favourite haunt of
  his.</p>

  <p>He found himself in the midst of a soft flurry of snow. When he had left
  Glenmore several hours earlier it had been fine weather, but the clouds had
  been banking up in the north. Now the snow had come, and since it was falling
  steadily it would be a business to find an inconspicuous white dog. The
  lights were lit in Hector's cottage, and the door was open. Bill snuggled up
  in the darkness against the wall and observed two men standing at the
  threshold. One was Hector himself, and the other looked like Angus, the river
  gillie. The lamplight from within fell on Hector's face, and it was very
  grave.</p>

  <p>"She's bad," Hector was saying. "She's awfu' bad. We maun get the doctor
  or she'll be bye wi' it. The puir thing's greetin' wi' pain. Haste ye, Angus,
  and awa' on your bicycle to Abercailly and bring Dr. Porteous back wi' ye. If
  he's no at name ye maun range the countryside till ye find him. Oh, man,
  hurry! I daurna' leave her, or I'd be off mysel'."</p>

  <p>"But ma bicycle's broke," said Angus glumly. "I ran into a stane last
  nicht, and the front wheel's like a peaseweep's egg."</p>

  <p>"Then awa' up the glen to Jock Rorison, the herd, and borrow his. There's
  nae other bicycle about the place. Oh, man, haste ye, or ye'll be ower
  late."</p>

  <p>Bill saw Angus start off at a trot and Hector turn wearily indoors. He was
  alarmed by the news, for he had been fond of Mrs. Hector, who had often
  stayed him and Peter with oatcakes and jam.... And then suddenly a great idea
  occurred to him. Abercailly was five miles off, and Angus and his bicycle
  would take nearly an hour to reach it in the snow. But he had the staff and
  could be there in a second.... He twirled it and wished himself in Dr.
  Porteous's back garden.</p>

  <p>The doctor knew him by sight, and it would never do to reveal himself. He
  must approach the back door and pretend to be one of the cottagers' boys from
  Glenmore. The darkness and the snow were in his favour. So Bill turned up the
  collar of his jacket and knocked loudly.</p>

  <p>It seemed a long time before Dr. Porteous's housekeeper opened. She peered
  into the night. "Wha is it?" she asked, blinking her eyes.</p>

  <p>Now Bill, who had a good ear, had always prided himself on his command of
  the Scots tongue. This was the moment for its use.</p>

  <p>"It's me," he said, in the lilting tone of the countryside. "I'm frae
  Glenmore. Hector Cameron's wife's lyin' awfu' bad, and they sent me to tell
  the doctor that he maun come at once or she'll dee."</p>

  <p>"Mercy! that's bad news," said the housekeeper. "The doctor's indoors
  haein' his tea. He's had an awfu' hard day, and he'll be sweir to gang out in
  the snaw. But needs must if Ailie Cameron's bad. D'ye ken what the trouble
  is?"</p>

  <p>"I never heard," said Bill, "but she's greetin' sair wi' pain, and Hector
  Cameron's in an awfu' way about it. He said I was to get the doctor at a'
  costs, though I had to look for him ower the hale parish."</p>

  <p>"Is it as bad as that? I'll awa and tell him. Ye can come in and wait by
  the kitchen fire."</p>

  <p>"I think I'll bide here. Ye see, I'm terrible wat."</p>

  <p>A minute later the housekeeper returned. "The doctor will stert in the car
  as sune as he's got his buits on. Wad ye like a piece?"</p>

  <p>"Thank ye, mem," said Bill, "but I had my tea afore I left." And without
  more words he turned into the darkness.</p>

  <p>So far, so good, Bill reflected. Dr. Porteous would be at Glenmore before
  Angus had well started on the herd's bicycle. Bill felt a glow of conscious
  merit, the surprised glow of one who has slipped accidentally into
  virtue.</p>

  <p>Now for Catsbane. Bill's wits had returned to him, and as he turned the
  stick he wished to be beside the dog....</p>

  <p>He found himself in an extraordinary place. He seemed to be high up on a
  hillside, but the snow was falling so fast that he could not discover his
  whereabouts. The ground was a tangle of boulders deep in blaeberries and long
  heather and of old stumps of trees. He could only think that it was the fir
  wood on the slopes of Stob Ghabhar, which had been cut down in the
  summer.</p>

  <p>There beside him was Catsbane. The little dog was furiously busy, trying
  to force his way into a hole below a big stone. Bill could not see him
  properly because of the darkness and the snow. But he could hear him panting,
  and, feeling for him, he discovered the stump of his tail. Bill caught the
  tail and pulled out an excessively dirty and protesting terrier.</p>

  <p>"You dirty little beast," he said. "You're for it, you know. You'll have
  to be washed, and you hate that."</p>

  <p>Catsbane barked furiously.</p>

  <p>"I don't blame you," said Bill, relenting. "You're after a fox, and you
  can't hunt foxes at home."</p>

  <p>So he seized Catsbane by the scruff and twirled the stick, and the two
  found themselves back beside the pond in the garden.</p>

  <p>It was a still, dry night and mild, very different from the tempest of
  Glenmore. Catsbane shook himself vigorously, and as they came into the light
  below the library window Bill saw that he was black with soil and as wet as a
  bath sponge.</p>

  <p>"I've found your dog," he told Barbara as he entered the hall.</p>

  <p>The much-relieved owner seized upon the grimy fragment of terrier and
  clasped it to her breast; but she dropped it hastily. "Catsbane, where on
  earth have you been?" she cried. "You've been on Alemoor and you've been down
  a rabbit-hole, and I believe you've been fighting, for your ear's cut. Oh,
  Daddy!" she added, as her father appeared, "did you ever see such a
  disreputable little dog?"</p>

  <p>Catsbane had shaken himself again and was now standing shivering in the
  glow of the hall fire. Bill's father took him up and looked at him
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"This is the second miracle that has happened to-day," he said. "First you
  boys find bog myrtle, and now Catsbane has discovered peat. He's been rolling
  in it, and there isn't any peat within fifty miles!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; "BEAUTY" AND "BANDS"</h2>

  <p class="first">THREE days later at breakfast Bill's father looked up from
  his letters.</p>

  <p>"Glenmore seems to have become demented," he said. "First I had a wire
  from Mrs. Macrae." He fumbled in his pocket and produced a pink slip.</p>

  <p>"'<i>Is the bairns alright. Macrae.</i>' The honest woman does not waste
  words. I could make nothing of it, and thought it might be a new kind of
  Christmas greeting. But here's the explanation in her letter. It seems that
  Glenmore is haunted, and by such fearsome spectres as Bill and Peter. They
  were seen three nights ago in Mrs. Macrae's best room by Mrs. Macrae herself,
  and afterwards in the garden by Angus as well. She says that Angus was not a
  yard off when they disappeared, and that he saw their faces quite clear and
  could describe what they were wearing. It seems that the whole glen is
  solemnised. I wired at once that the boys were perfectly well, but Mrs.
  Macrae is not satisfied. She thinks it may be a forewarning of coming
  disaster, and she implores me never to take my eyes off them till Hogmanay is
  past."</p>

  <p>Bill's mother looked anxious. "What an extraordinary thing! I always
  thought Mrs. Macrae a pillar of common sense. She hasn't second sight, has
  she?"</p>

  <p>"If she has, I don't suppose Angus has it, and they both saw the ghosts.
  They were solid enough ghosts, for they knocked a stone off the wall and
  broke the branch of a pear tree. A couple of Abercailly boys on the loose!
  Bill, did you know that you had a double in Abercailly?"</p>

  <p>Bill grinned sheepishly and said nothing. He had begun to realise that in
  this business of the magic staff he must walk delicately and provoke no
  questions. Any future enterprise must be carefully thought out in all its
  bearings. He had already passed a self-denying ordinance, and had made no
  experiment since the rescue of Catsbane.</p>

  <p>"Does she say anything about Mrs. Cameron?" he heard his mother ask.</p>

  <p>"Yes. She is not out of danger, but the reports are good. Apparently they
  got her to Abercailly and operated in the nick of time. That was the evening
  they saw the ghosts, and naturally Mrs. Macrae's mind was keyed up for
  marvels. You had better write to her, Jean, and say the boys are all right.
  She will believe you sooner than me."</p>

  <p>Then Barbara, to Bill's disquiet, put in an unwanted oar. "That was the
  evening that Catsbane was lost and came back covered with peat. You remember,
  Daddy? And the boys found bog myrtle!"</p>

  <p>After tea Bill was allowed for a treat to sit in the library and study the
  pictures in the big bird book. His father sat in an armchair with an old
  calf-bound folio on his knee, from which he appeared to be taking notes. From
  time to time he made ejaculations of interest or surprise, and once he said,
  "Bless my soul, what a queer story!"</p>

  <p>Several times he got up to refer to other books among the thousands which
  lined the great room. Then at last he startled Bill out of his contemplation
  of a coloured plate of the red-necked phalarope by dropping the folio on the
  floor. He stood up on the hearth-rug, filled his pipe from a box on the
  mantelpiece, and looked down at Bill.</p>

  <p>"I have just come across a very good story," he said. "Would you like to
  hear it?"</p>

  <p>He took down from a shelf a slim black volume and found a passage. "Read
  that," he said.</p>

  <p>Bill read:</p>

  <p>"<i>Et assumpsi mihi duas virgas, unam vocavi Decorem, et alter am vocavi
  Funiculum; et pavi gregem.</i>"</p>

  <p>"Now have a shot at construing it."</p>

  <p>Bill had a shot, but he did not succeed. Latin was not his strong suit,
  and half the words were unfamiliar.</p>

  <p>His father handed him a Bible. "Look up the seventh verse of the eleventh
  chapter of Zechariah and read."</p>

  <p>Bill read:</p>

  <p>"And I took unto me two staves, the one I called Beauty, and the other I
  called Bands; and I fed the flock."</p>

  <p>"You understand that?" his father said. "The prophet had two staves, one
  called <i>Decor</i> and the other <i>Funiculus</i>; that is 'Beauty' and
  'Bands.' One was for comfort and the other for discipline&mdash;you might say
  one was a walking-stick and the other a schoolmaster's cane. Now the book I
  have been reading&mdash;it is a volume of <i>Acta Sanctorum</i>, the 'Doings
  of the Saints,' and it was written in Germany in the twelfth
  century&mdash;says that these staves were real sticks and that they had
  magical power. They lay in the treasury in the Temple of Jerusalem until the
  Emperor Titus sacked it and carried them off. After that they seem to have
  roamed for centuries about Europe. Charlemagne&mdash;you have heard of
  Charlemagne?&mdash;had one, and the Emperor Justinian had one; but they were
  never long in one place. Sometimes a Pope got hold of them, and sometimes a
  Bishop, and sometimes a King, and sometimes a peasant, but they disappeared
  as soon as they were misused. The point about them was that they were magic
  sticks and would carry their possessor anywhere in the world he wanted to go
  to. But the trouble was that you could not be certain what was their
  particular magic. They were as alike as two peas, but one was <i>Decor</i>
  and the other <i>Funiculus</i>, and if you treated <i>Decor</i> like
  <i>Funiculus</i> it took the huff and disappeared. If it was <i>Decor</i> it
  would take you gallivanting about the earth for your amusement and never
  complain. But if you used it for some big serious job, it was apt to leave
  you in the lurch. <i>Funiculus</i> was just the opposite. It was all right in
  things like battles and rescues and escapes, but if you took it on a pleasure
  trip it would let you down."</p>

  <p>Bill listened with breathless interest. "What happened to the sticks?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"My book says that in its time, that is the twelfth century,
  <i>Funiculus</i> had gone over the horizon, but <i>Decor</i> was believed to
  be in the possession of the Emperor Frederick.... It's a good story, isn't
  it? I dare say it is the origin of all the old witches' broomsticks in the
  fairy tales. But these were broomsticks with wills of their own.... Hullo!
  hullo! it's six o'clock. I must see Thomas about to-morrow's covert
  shoot."</p>

  <p>When his father had left, Bill sat for a long time in meditation. Clearly
  he had got one of the two staves which had come down from the old prophet in
  the Bible and had drifted for two thousand years through the hands of Popes
  and Kings. The question was, which one? Was it <i>Beauty</i> or
  <i>Bands</i>?</p>

  <p>Bill was a conscientious thinker, and set himself to analyse his
  experiences. The adventures of Alemoor and the Solomon Islands had been more
  or less undertaken for his own amusement, and so had the first visit to
  Glenmore. On the other hand, the rescue of Catsbane and the summoning of the
  doctor to Mrs. Cameron had had a distinct flavour of duty. As yet there was
  not enough evidence to decide which staff he had got. It would have been an
  awful business if he had used it wrongly and it had objected; Bill shuddered
  when he remembered the faces of the South Sea Islanders. Perhaps he was being
  allowed a trial trip to test him. On the whole, he decided that this was the
  likeliest explanation. But the time of probation was probably now over, since
  he knew about the staff's peculiarities. He had an eerie feeling that some
  fate had led his father to discover that story in the funny old book.</p>

  <p>Bill found the page in it which his father had marked, but he could make
  nothing of the close black type and the queer Latin. Then he read again the
  passage in Zechariah. For a long time he thought hard, till Groves came in to
  make up the fire and to warn him that his supper was ready. He had reached
  the conclusion that the next experiment must combine somehow the partialities
  of both Beauty and Bands, for he could not afford to make a mistake.</p>

  <p>Next morning he overheard a conversation between his father and his
  mother. His father seemed to be very angry.</p>

  <p>"It is getting simply intolerable. Those disgusting Benisons have been at
  their monkey tricks again. It appears that there was a biggish party at
  Yardley last week-end, to meet the Viceroy, who was at school with the
  General. What did the bright young Benisons do but make a raid in the middle
  of the Saturday night! They managed to burgle the back premises, and flung
  every scrap of food in the house into the moat, leaving an idiotic doggerel
  poem in the butler's pantry. Yardley is ten miles from a town, so you may
  imagine the trouble about the commissariat on the Sunday. The General went
  raving mad, and started out for Wildash with a horsewhip; but he thought
  better of it and turned back. What could he do? They would only laugh at the
  old fellow. He talks about prosecuting; but it won't be easy to bring the
  charge home, for the brutes are pretty clever. I wish to heaven somebody
  would retaliate in kind and give those jokers a taste of their own
  medicine."</p>

  <p>Bill pricked up his ears. He knew all about the Benisons, who five years
  before had bought Wildash from a long-descended bankrupt squire. They were
  his father's nearest neighbours, but there was no commerce between the two
  houses. The elder Benison had made a great deal of money in the City during
  the War, and had brought his flock of glossy sons and over-decorated
  daughters to an old-fashioned place which was not glossy or decorated. They
  were only at Wildash for a few weeks in the winter, but they contrived to
  crowd these weeks with scandals. They had enormous raffish house parties, and
  their chief amusement consisted in playing practical jokes on inoffensive
  neighbours. The countryside detested them, for they spent nothing in the
  village, which was badly neglected, and gave not a penny to local
  purposes.</p>

  <p>At first the sons and daughters had gone out hunting on expensive horses,
  but their manners were so vile that the Master, in a moment of expansion, had
  told them that they were only fit to hunt jackals on jackasses round the
  walls of Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>But they kept the neighbourhood from boredom, for they were the theme of
  endless gossip. Bill had heard all about "them Ben'sons" and their doings
  from his village friends, who were at once horrified and exhilarated by
  beings unlike any gentry they had ever known. That very morning old Noggin,
  the blacksmith, had been recounting the wonders of a dance to be held at
  Wildash on Christmas Eve.</p>

  <p>"They do say, Maaster Bill," Noggin had declared, "as how the young
  gen'men is going to dress themsels up as devils with tails. There can't be no
  blessing on them belltinkerings."</p>

  <p>Noggin was a Primitive Methodist, much given to the use of Scripture
  phrases, but he did not know that the word "belltinkering" came straight down
  from the Baal-worship of the hoariest antiquity.</p>

  <p>Bill fell into a happy muse. Here might be the chance of an adventure
  which <i>Beauty</i> would welcome, and of which <i>Bands</i> would not
  disapprove.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE ADVENTURE OF THE CHRISTMAS
     PARTY&mdash;I</h2>

  <p class="first">THAT afternoon Bill went for a walk through the fields to
  Wildash, which lay two miles off in the valley. The Hall, a massive early
  Georgian building, had a park on three sides of it, but on the fourth it
  snuggled up to the village; indeed, its stables and outhouses abutted on the
  village street. In that street lived, with his mother, a friend of Bill's,
  'Erb by name, with whom he had often gone fishing and bird-nesting. 'Erb was
  pantry boy at the big house, but only when the Benisons were in residence,
  for at other times he was learning to be a carpenter. He slept at the Hall,
  but Bill knew that it was his custom to resort to his mother's cottage for
  tea.</p>

  <p>Bill had tea with 'Erb and sounded him about the Benisons' Christmas
  festivities, on which his friend expanded with round eyes. The family were
  expected at the Hall next day, which was December 24th, and they were
  bringing with them enough guests to fill every bedroom. Mr. Blett, the
  butler, was in London that day with Roberts, the first footman, supervising
  the preparations. On Christmas Eve the party was not to dine until ten
  o'clock, and the revels were to be kept up all night, supper being at the
  hour at which ordinary people breakfasted. 'Erb was full of marvellous
  details about the costumes to be worn, and the escapades which might be
  expected. The dining-room was to be transformed into the similitude of a
  dungeon, with blue lights burning, and&mdash;said 'Erb in awed
  tones&mdash;they were going to drink the wine out of skulls.</p>

  <p>Bill asked about the servants' meal. That wasn't to be forgotten, said
  'Erb. The upper servants were to dine in the housekeeper's room, and the
  lower in the servants' hall, three-quarters of an hour before the main
  dinner. The Benisons, it appeared, did not, on such occasions, rely much on
  their own cookery, and the chief dishes were coming down from London.</p>

  <p>"Most of 'em cold," said 'Erb. "They don't fancy a nice bit of 'ot meat,
  like me. It ain't food they cares for so much as the pop."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Bill asked.</p>

  <p>"Wine," said 'Erb, darkly. "That's what Mr. Blett's looking after. He's
  bringing down loads of it. That's what they drinks mostly. 'A bottle of pop,'
  says Mr. Lionel when he feels nohow. Mr. Reggie he sticks to brandy."</p>

  <p>Bill accompanied 'Erb in his walk up to the Hall in the frosty twilight,
  and, since the family was not at home and Mr. Blett was absent, he was
  allowed indoors. 'Erb was a little nervous about his visitor, until he
  discovered that the kitchen staff were entertaining guests on their own
  account, and that the second footman had gone off on his bicycle to see his
  sweetheart.</p>

  <p>The two boys roamed about the cavernous servants' quarters, which had been
  built in the days when each squire of Wildash sat in Parliament for the
  county, and generously entertained his constituents. He was shown 'Erb's
  cubby-hole behind the main butler's pantry, and was permitted to glance
  inside the great wine-cellars. They seemed ill-stocked, and 'Erb explained
  the reason. "The family don't care for wine&mdash;port and them
  kinds&mdash;what Mr. Blett says is 'wine indeed'&mdash;only for that there
  pop. And Mr. Blett says they don't keep much of it 'ere, for the cellars
  ain't dry enough. That's why he's gone to London." But some of the pop was
  already there, stacked on the pantry floor in wooden boxes with odd marks on
  them.</p>

  <p>Bill made a careful inspection on his own account of the back premises of
  the Hall. He noticed that all the windows were heavily barred, so that it
  would be impossible to climb in or out. He observed, too, with satisfaction,
  that there were keys on all the inner doors and that these keys were on the
  outside.</p>

  <p>He begged to be allowed a glimpse of the rest of the house, and 'Erb
  rather uneasily complied. The passage which led to it did not terminate in an
  ordinary green-baize door as in Bill's own home, but in a solid wooden affair
  which was equipped with lock and key. Beyond this was a small alcove with a
  hatch opening into the dining-room. Clearly, if this door were once barred,
  all communication would be cut off between the back premises and the main
  apartments.</p>

  <p>There was not much to be seen, for the huge pillared hall was littered
  with furniture, which, for some reason, had been turned out of the library.
  But a peep into the dining-room was sensational. 'Erb snapped a switch and
  Bill saw that all the lights were fantastically coloured, and that the big
  chandelier in the centre burned with an unearthly crimson glow. The pictures
  had been taken down and the walls covered with a cloth to resemble rough
  stone, and there was a contraption at one end which looked like a stage.</p>

  <p>'Erb was slightly awed. "Crikey!" he said. "This ain't the place I'd pick
  to eat my meat in. But there's no accounting for the gentry's taste."</p>

  <p>After that Bill was hustled back to humble life. 'Erb was nervous in case
  the kitchen tea-party should break up or the second footman return from his
  love-making. "Nip along, Master Bill," he urged. "There's funny folks in this
  'ouse, and Mr. Blett would have my ears off if he 'eard I'd let anyone
  in."</p>

  <p>So Bill took his leave, and only just in time, for by a rapid retreat into
  a laurel bush he narrowly escaped the returning footman.</p>

  <p>On his way home he paid a visit to another friend, Pobjoy, the
  earth-stopper, who was a brother-in-law of Thomas, his father's keeper. He
  knew that at this hour Pobjoy would be busy in the lee of Wildash Great
  Spinney, and sure enough he found a figure like an ancient gnome, bending
  over his traps at the end of Lemming's Lane. The figure was attended by a
  ferocious mongrel called Jum. But Jum was an ally of Bill's and treated him
  kindly.</p>

  <p>He waited until Pobjoy had finished his task, and then accompanied him to
  his cottage on the other side of the wood. A great plan had suddenly dawned
  upon Bill's mind, and he wanted information. Pobjoy gave it him.</p>

  <p>The Wildash Pig Club was to have its supper in the schoolroom on Christmas
  Eve. It was not a flourishing pig club; indeed, its finances were chronically
  unhealthy, but it clung to its antique custom of an annual feast. Bill knew
  all the members: his own Thomas was one, and Noggin the blacksmith, and
  Lippett the road-man, and Amos Tuck the postman, and Martin the ditcher, and
  the shepherd from Coldeaston, and the under-keeper from Wardsley, and
  Springwell the thatcher. Of this fraternity of gnarled worthies Pobjoy was
  President. None of the Hall servants belonged to the Club. Mr. Benison had
  only bought the house and a few paddocks, and his grooms and chauffeurs did
  not mix in local society.</p>

  <p>Pobjoy was eloquent on the Club's poverty. "I've seen the day, Maaster
  Bill, when twenty lads'd sit down to a smoking loin of pork, and a roast of
  beef, and a great stew of wild-jucks, and a pigeon pie as big as a horse
  trough, and old Squire John'd send down lashins of right strong ale from his
  own buttery. Now, by gob! we're hard put to it to get some cold pig food and
  some of them skimpy little meat pies as Hutt the baker makes. They be hard
  times for us poor folks."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't Mr. Benison help?" Bill asked.</p>

  <p>"Help!" Pobjoy spat savagely. "Them Ben'sons! They keep their own pig club
  up at the Hall, and I wish their guzzling may choke 'em. They take no more
  concern in the parish than a gor-crow that happens over from Alemoor to pick
  up a pullet.... And the beer nowadays!"</p>

  <p>Pobjoy became savagely reminiscent. "That hog-wash from the 'Plough and
  'Arrow' ain't beer, for it don't comfort the innards. A man might drink three
  buckets of it and be none the merrier."</p>

  <p>Bill enquired about the hour of the supper, and was told ten o'clock.</p>

  <p>"The Wardsley lads can't come before.... See here, Maaster Bill, you pass
  that word on to your Thomas. We used to sit down at nine. I don't want Thomas
  to get his shins cold waiting."</p>

  <p>With a new confidence Bill watched Pobjoy swing his traps from his
  shoulder and stamp his feet at his doorstep. He hotly disliked intruders like
  the Benisons, and he had a furious affection for his own people.
  <i>Beauty</i> could not be averse to the joyous enterprise which he
  meditated, and <i>Bands</i> must approve its stern moral purpose. There was a
  lot in the Bible about humbling the proud and exalting the humble.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE ADVENTURE OF THE CHRISTMAS
     PARTY&mdash;II</h2>

  <p class="first">CHRISTMAS EVE was very cold. Up till then there had been a
  mild frost with a wind in the north, but on that afternoon the wind swung
  round to the east and the clouds massed for snow. On Christmas Eve it was the
  custom for Bill to go to bed at the same time as Peter, and with the
  expectation of Santa Claus he usually went without protest. Bill was by this
  time a sceptic on the subject of the visit of the Saint, though Peter was
  still a devout believer. He knew that his mother would come to his bedside
  about eleven to fill his stocking, for he had once been awake and caught her
  in the act.</p>

  <p>All this was as it should be. The period between 9 and 10.30 was going to
  be for him a time of stern endeavour. He had occasional spasms of
  nervousness, which he quieted by reminding himself that whatever happened he
  was perfectly safe, if he only kept his head. Whether his staff were
  <i>Beauty</i> or <i>Bands</i> it could not fail him, since the enterprise
  combined all the purposes of both.</p>

  <p>Bill put on stout knickerbockers and a sweater, for the weather was sharp,
  and at the same time he dared not cumber himself with too many garments. On
  his feet were fives-shoes. Then he twirled the stick and wished himself just
  outside the Hall dining-room windows, and in a second he was standing on
  gravel which was beginning to be powdered with snow.</p>

  <p>The windows were not shuttered, and within a big fire was blazing, which
  gave light enough to reveal a table loaded with dishes, and another
  assortment on a long sideboard. A second sideboard held a forest of bottles
  and glasses, and below it were further bottles in great wine-coolers. There
  were several gramophones going in the bedrooms, and a great deal of laughter
  in one of the upper rooms. The inmates would be preparing for dinner, Bill
  decided, and getting into the fantastic costumes with which rumour had been
  busy.</p>

  <p>Bill padded along the house-back till he reached the servants' quarters.
  He made out the butler's pantry, which he had marked down the evening before
  by the clump of winter-jasmine outside it. That gave him his bearings and
  enabled him to locate the housekeeper's room. In this part of the house the
  windows were all shuttered and barred, and when he tried the main door he
  found it locked. There were sounds of many voices inside&mdash;no doubt, the
  staff assembling for their meal. This, he knew, was to be in two places, the
  servants' hall and the housekeeper's room. He stood and pondered for a moment
  till he remembered the exact lie of these apartments.</p>

  <p>Then he made the magic stick take him inside 'Erb's cubby-hole, as the
  safest base of operations. A second earlier and he would have landed on the
  top of 'Erb, who was just closing the door behind him.</p>

  <p>Bill waited till the footsteps died away in the flagged passage, and then
  stealthily proceeded to reconnoitre. The humbler diners had assembled. He
  listened outside the housekeeper's room, and heard Mrs. Chalk, the
  housekeeper, who was a Seventh Day Baptist, saying grace. He listened outside
  the servants' hall, and heard a cheerful babel of voices, among which he
  thought that he detected 'Erb's. The keys were on the outside of both doors,
  but he did not turn them. Someone might want to leave on an errand and he had
  no need to lock in the staff until his job was done. But he slipped along to
  the outer door of the servants' quarters, and extracted its key, which he
  dropped among the logs in a basket which stood outside the wine cellar.</p>

  <p>There was a clock in the passage which led to the main rooms of the house,
  and its hands pointed to twenty minutes past nine. The servants must finish
  their meal by a quarter to ten if Mr. Blett and the footmen were to be ready
  for dinner. That meant that Bill had under half an hour for his job, which
  was none too much.</p>

  <p>His first business was to visit the butler's pantry to see what champagne
  remained there. There were only two cases, for the contents of the others
  were now in the dining-room. Bill tiptoed along the corridor, past the
  connecting door, which he locked behind him, and entered the dining-room by
  way of the central hall. From the bedrooms upstairs came the sound of
  laughter and human speech, but all the lower part of the house was very
  quiet. The silence was broken only by the crackling of logs in the great hall
  fireplace.</p>

  <p>Bill's heart almost failed him when he snapped the switch and the blue and
  crimson lights blazed from the eerie walls. This was a horrible place, and it
  needed all his resolution to quell his tremors.... But presently he was too
  busy to be afraid. Somehow or other he had to shift several dozen bottles,
  and he looked round for a means of transport. He found it in a dumb-waiter
  from which the upper tray could be removed. This he loaded carefully with
  wine and then wished himself in the Wild-ash schoolroom.</p>

  <p>This was a very humble scene compared with the uncanny grandeur he had
  left. There was a trestle table covered with a rather ragged oil-cloth, and
  on it stood several loaves, a dish of butter, a wedge of cheap cheese, some
  odd-looking plates of meat, and four big brown earthenware jugs of beer. A
  small fire burned in the grate, and a feeble oil lamp revealed the dingy
  walls with their ancient oleographs of royalties. Altogether the scene of the
  Pig Club supper did not suggest revelry.</p>

  <p>Bill arranged the champagne bottles on the table and twirled the stick....
  The Hall dining-room was as he had left it. Three times the tray was loaded
  up and transferred to the schoolroom, till there was not a bottle of any sort
  left behind. Champagne, brandy, liqueurs of many brands, and three decanters
  of port were now making a brave show on the school-room oilcloth. Then he
  transported the two cases of champagne remaining in the butler's pantry. And
  then he paused for a moment to think. The clock on the mantelpiece said
  9.30.</p>

  <p>He had intended only to take the wine. But the recollection of the Pig
  Club's meagre fare suggested an amendment to his plan. He would give them
  some of the eatables also. So the tray was loaded with Strassburg patés, and
  game-pies, and hams and tongues and galantines, and a basket of hot-house
  fruits; and to crown all a cake so rich that Bill's mouth watered at the
  sight of it. But he realised that he must take nothing for himself, or
  <i>Bands</i> would have something to say about it. He was no brigand, but a
  minister of justice.</p>

  <p>The transfer of these delicacies took a full ten minutes. Bill, now back
  in the dining-room, turned off the lights, for the fire gave enough
  illumination. There was very little solid fare left in that place, and
  absolutely nothing to drink. No doubt hot dishes would be forthcoming from
  the kitchen, but the Benisons must make shift without champagne. He did not
  touch a variety of comfits and sweet dishes, for he remembered that the
  Wildash Pig Club were simple souls and would make little of such
  dainties.</p>

  <p>He listened, and heard a clock far away strike the three-quarters. Soon
  there would be movement in the servants' region, though he had made it
  impossible for them to reach the dining-room, since he had hidden the key.
  But the guests seemed to be astir, for he heard steps in the hall. He was
  just about to take his leave when the door opened.</p>

  <p>Bill, crouching behind the table, lingered spell-bound. The newcomer was a
  tall man, and he was dressed to resemble an African witch-doctor&mdash;at
  least, after the first moment of scare, this was Bill's verdict. He had horns
  on his head and a necklace of bones round his neck, his face was horribly
  painted in white and red, and he seemed to be naked except for a loin cloth
  of skins. He closed the door very softly behind him and made no attempt to
  turn on the lights. Evidently he knew his way, for he advanced to the
  sideboard. Bill decided that he was suffering from a great thirst.</p>

  <p>Now Bill had pulled out the biggest wine-cooler from below that sideboard
  in order to extract the bottles, and he had not pushed it back. The visitor
  was feeling along the sideboard top with his face to the door, and, oblivious
  of his danger, he took a step backwards. In a moment an African witch-doctor
  was sitting in six inches of ice and water, wailing like a sea-bird.</p>

  <p>Bill waited no longer. This was an unrehearsed effect, but it was proof
  that the fates recognised the justice of his enterprise.</p>

  <p>The fire in the schoolroom was burning a little more cheerfully. Bill
  turned up the lamp to contemplate his handiwork. The trestle table groaned
  under its load of rich provender, and the bottles made a shining forest about
  it. The shabby oilcloth was completely hidden by them, and the shabbier tin
  plates and broken-handled knives. Bill stirred the fire, and set all the
  chairs he could find in order round the board. At the far end of the room the
  school benches had been piled, and these made a screen behind which he
  ensconced himself. He wanted to see the expression on the faces of the first
  arrivals.</p>

  <p>He was disappointed. The Wildash Pig Club were men of iron, immune from
  nerves and very willing to accept the gifts of a mysterious Providence. When
  they lumbered in, with the slow step of those who have been labouring hard
  all day, and the glory was revealed to them, Pobjoy rose to the occasion. He
  ceremoniously locked the door. Then he sat down in the presidential chair and
  said grace huskily. Then he demanded a corkscrew.</p>

  <p>That Pig Club supper was to remain a hallowed memory, not in Wildash
  alone, but in all the Seven Towns of Alemoor. They drank up all the
  champagne, but not neat, for neat it seemed to them to be but a cold and
  comfortless beverage. With the beer they made a new shandygaff, and with
  brandy and liqueurs they concocted heart-stirring mixtures, worthy to wash
  down food which was a heavenly revelation. Instead of the low mutter of
  casual talk which commonly attended the supper, they soared into Bacchanalian
  happiness. They drank each other's healths with due honours, and the Wardsley
  keeper proposed the toast of Pobjoy, whose poaching instincts he had hitherto
  distrusted, dwelling eloquently on his talents as a sportsman and his worth
  as a citizen. Repeatedly they honoured the memory of old Squire John, with
  whom they somehow connected their good fortune. Men who had not sung since
  their schooldays were moved to melody.</p>

  <p>They did not return soberly to their wives at midnight, as had been their
  custom. The school-mistress next door was kept awake by their revelry far
  into the small hours. When, just before dawn, they emerged into a snowy
  world, the sharp air turned even those seasoned vessels into madcaps.
  Springwell, the thatcher, was found by the Vicar before the morning service
  asleep in the church porch, and Noggin the blacksmith was discovered in his
  own smithy with his head on a heap of iron filings. The Coldeaston shepherd
  was, after much searching, disinterred from a hay shed many miles distant
  from his dwelling, while Martin the ditcher having safely reached his
  cottage, was so ill-inspired as to don his morris-dancer's clothes and caper
  in the village street to the accompaniment of the village church bells.</p>

  <p>Pobjoy alone was unshaken. He marched steadily home, announcing to the
  world that the fly was on the turnip and that he preferred turnip-hoeing to
  any other earthly occupation. But even Pobjoy wept happily for some time on
  Jum's neck.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE ADVENTURE OF UNCLE BOB&mdash;I</h2>

  <p class="first">BILL was snug in bed before his mother appeared at eleven
  o'clock to fill his stocking. He put up a very good imitation of healthful
  slumber, and fortunately she did not notice the heap of wet clothing tumbled
  in a corner. When she had gone, he rose and so disposed of that clothing that
  it should not catch the eye of Elsie in the morning.</p>

  <p>Christmas dawned upon a white world. Bill was wakened by an excited Peter
  displaying the treasures of his stocking, and lay for a little trying to
  reconstruct the events of the past evening. He waited eagerly to hear the
  news of them&mdash;eagerly, but with a little anxiety too. All had gone
  according to plan, but there were the after-effects to reckon with. The
  simple course would have been to seek out Thomas the keeper, who would be
  found in the gun-room preparing for the Christmas shoot. But Bill decided
  that he had better hold himself aloof. The news must come to him&mdash;he
  must not go to seek it.</p>

  <p>So he was a little abstracted at breakfast, though ceremonially grateful
  for his Christmas gifts and inclined to frown on Peter's extravagances. At
  church he felt self-conscious. There was no member of the Pig Club there, and
  he did not know about the Vicar's discovery of the sleeping Springwell in the
  porch, but he suspected that even the most decorous worshippers must have
  spent the morning discussing the doings at Wildash.</p>

  <p>The killing of the Christmas pheasant in the afternoon was as much a part
  of the family ritual as church, and Bill, who from his preoccupation with
  other things, escaped his besetting fault of over-keenness, managed to get
  five to his own 16-bore. As the birds were being collected he realised that
  his father was being told a tale by the beaters, and he could scarcely
  refrain from joining the group. His father's laughter reassured him; that
  must mean that there had been no regrettable incident.</p>

  <p>The story came out at tea. Bill had never seen his father so amused.</p>

  <p>"Best thing I ever heard of! The Benisons had one of their freak parties
  last night, and were laying themselves out for a vulgar jamboree. Some genius
  came along, locked up the servants and pinched all the wine and most of the
  food. Was there ever a finer case of the biter bit? Those brutes got some of
  their own medicine, and I hope they enjoyed it."</p>

  <p>"And that's only half the fun," his father continued. "The same good fairy
  transported the Benisons' provender to the Wildash school-room, and the Pig
  Club, when they arrived for their modest supper, found a feast of fat things.
  Like sensible fellows they asked no questions, but ate it all up. Drank it
  all up, too, with the result that the Pig Club to-day seems to be dispersed
  over the countryside. Old Loveday says that there are still search parties
  out.... I gather they had nothing to do with the plundering of the
  Benisons&mdash;only found the stuff on their supper table and very naturally
  demolished it. Loveday says that every man-jack of them has a water-tight
  alibi, and can account for every minute till he arrived at the schoolroom.
  The Benisons of course are furious, and have turned on the police, but it
  looks as if they could do nothing. I hope to goodness they don't catch the
  sportsman who did the trick. I wish I knew who he was, for I'd like to shake
  hands with him. Hang it all, Mary, the whole country should subscribe to pay
  his fine, if they catch him, and present him with a piece of plate."</p>

  <p>Bill, feeling that some observation was expected from him, enquired if
  Thomas the keeper had attended the supper.</p>

  <p>"Thomas was there," said his father. "He was looking a little pink about
  the gills this afternoon, and drank a lot of water. When I spoke to him he
  only grinned, for with the police court in view Thomas is not going to give
  himself away. But I seemed to detect a holy joy in his eyes."</p>

  <p>The period between tea and dinner on Christmas Day was by custom
  consecrated to reading aloud in the library. Bill scarcely listened to the
  stirring tale of Jim Hawkins, for his soul was bubbling with satisfaction. He
  had brought off a feat for which his father thought a piece of plate a
  fitting recognition. He had executed justice upon the disturbers of the local
  peace. He had given a number of honest men the high moment of their
  lives....</p>

  <p>But one obstinate question remained to disturb his mind. He was not yet
  clear whether his staff was <i>Beauty</i> or <i>Bands</i>, and till he had
  settled that problem he could have no true confidence. Last night's escapade
  had been a suitable task for either.</p>

  <p>When his mother and Barbara had gone up to dress Bill was left alone for a
  few minutes with his father. Now was the chance to see if any enlightenment
  could be got from the old book. He plunged boldly into the subject, and asked
  for more of the tale he had been told three nights before. His father got
  down the folio and looked up the passage.</p>

  <p>"There isn't much more here," he said. "You see, the writer is dealing
  with St. Egbert's contests with the Devil, and only brings in the
  <i>Beauty</i> and <i>Bands</i> story as an illustration."</p>

  <p>"Did the magic staff play tricks with people if they used it wrongly? I
  mean, did it take them to some queer place and then refuse to work, or
  anything like that?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. The staff wasn't mischievous, even if <i>Bands</i> was
  mistaken for <i>Beauty</i> or <i>Beauty</i> for <i>Bands</i>. So far as I can
  make out, if it was offended it merely took the huff and quietly disappeared.
  That must be so&mdash;if it had been otherwise this old fellow would have had
  something to say about the staff putting its owner in the cart. That's just
  the kind of yarn he would have loved."</p>

  <p>Bill went up to dress with his mind at ease.</p>

  <p>After dinner they all listened to the news on the wireless, for they had a
  strong family interest in it. Bill's uncle Bob, his mother's only brother,
  had been a distinguished airman in the War, and was now a great swell in
  civil aviation. He had made several record flights, and was at present
  attempting to fly alone to the Cape and back in a new type of light plane. So
  far he had done brilliantly. He had lowered the time for the outward journey
  by fourteen hours, and was already more than half-way home. He had left Kano
  in Northern Nigeria that morning, said the wireless, and was expected to
  reach the Mediterranean coast that evening. To-morrow he was due to arrive in
  England and preparations were being made to give him a public welcome. To
  Bill, who deeply admired his uncle, the news was the coping stone to a joyous
  day, and he went to bed in high spirits.</p>

  <p>But alas! next morning came a different story. His mother appeared at
  breakfast with a white face and eyes that looked as if she had been crying.
  The papers had come, and there in large type it was written that Captain
  Robert Askew had not reached the coast. Bill's father had already telephoned
  to London and found that the report was true. Uncle Bob and his plane had
  simply vanished. Twelve hours earlier he should have been in Algiers, but
  there was no sign of him. The French air posts had been warned, but the
  Sahara is a biggish area in which to look for a small plane, and Uncle Bob
  had no wireless attachment. The fear was that he had developed engine trouble
  somewhere among those inhospitable sands, and had been forced down. If he
  could not ascend again, he was lost&mdash;lost, maybe, for weeks&mdash;and
  would probably perish. The trouble was that he had not chosen to inform
  anyone about the exact course he meant to take, so he had left no data for a
  rescue party to work on.</p>

  <p>Breakfast was a silent meal. Bill wept a little out of sympathy with his
  mother, and then went out into the garden to think.</p>

  <p>The weather had grown mild again, the snow had disappeared, and the first
  aconites were showing below the trees in the rookery. But Bill had no eyes
  for the garden; he was seeing an infinite solitude of yellow desert with a
  small disconsolate object in the midst of it. He was very fond of Uncle Bob,
  and it was borne in on him that if he did not do something he might never see
  Uncle Bob again. This was a different kind of adventure from any he had
  engaged in before; it was desperately serious, since life was at stake, and
  because it was so serious he was afraid.</p>

  <p>But he saw no other way. If he failed Uncle Bob in his peril he would be
  ashamed of himself all his life.... It would be a longish business, and he
  must make some excuse and get off for the day. Happily he was quit of Peter,
  who was in bed with a violent cold in his head; even in the garden the horns
  of elfland faintly blown announced that Peter was doing good work with a
  pocket handkerchief. Bill got the cook to cut him some sandwiches, and then
  sought out his mother and announced that he wanted to go for a long walk.</p>

  <p>"That's a wise child," said his father. "The best cure for anxiety is to
  stretch your legs. Perhaps we may have better news when you get home."</p>

  <p>His mother kissed the top of his head. She looked so pale and sad that
  Bill's reluctant resolution kindled into a crusading zeal.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE ADVENTURE OF UNCLE BOB&mdash;II</h2>

  <p class="first">IN a glade of a wood about two miles from home, Bill twirled
  his stick and wished himself with his uncle....</p>

  <p>He found himself in a place very unlike the foggy morning Midlands he had
  left. It was cold, colder than at home, the sky was the palest blue, and his
  own shadow was long on the little hills. Funny hummocky little hills they
  were, like sand ridges on the seashore shaped into fantastic patterns by the
  tide. On the top of one of them sat a man with his chin in his right hand,
  looking towards the east, where a great golden sun was climbing the
  heavens.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Bob," said Bill.</p>

  <p>The man, who was dressed in rough overalls, did not turn his head.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Bob," said Bill again.</p>

  <p>This time the head moved round and Bill saw a drawn white face with hollow
  eyes, very different from the robust Uncle Bob he remembered. Apparently the
  man's eyes were less incredulous than his ears, for at the sight of Bill he
  jumped to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he cried, "this is serious. My eyes have gone." He rubbed them
  and peered wildly at the small boy in front of him.</p>

  <p>Bill was scared by his reception. "Uncle Bob," he cried, "don't look like
  that. It's me. It's really me."</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" The voice was as wild as the eyes.</p>

  <p>"Me! Bill! I've come to help you."</p>

  <p>The man groaned and dropped on the grass. "Lord," he moaned, "this is the
  end of things. I'm clean off my head."</p>

  <p>"You're not. It's really me, Bill!" He put out his hand and stroked his
  uncle's arm.</p>

  <p>The man caught him by the shoulder. "Am I mad or dreaming? No! By Jove,
  you feel real. You really are Bill." He sniffed the sleeve of Bill's jacket.
  "That's Harris tweed. You must be real. Where, by all that is marvellous,
  have you come from?"</p>

  <p>"From home."</p>

  <p>"But how?"</p>

  <p>"It's magic," said Bill. "I can't explain, but anyhow I'm here. I've come
  to help you. The papers this morning said that you might have crashed, so I
  came to help you.... Will you have a sandwich?"</p>

  <p>Uncle Bob took a bite of one of Bill's sandwiches and then sat down again
  with his head in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Great Scott!" he cried. "The papers this morning! And that sandwich was
  cut less than an hour ago! Either I'm delirious or it's a blessed
  miracle."</p>

  <p>He was on his feet again, pawing and kneading the boy's shoulders as if
  afraid they would vanish into a mirage.</p>

  <p>"You feel solid enough. And you look like Bill.... Miracle or no, you're
  here at this moment beside me in this blighted desert. Come along and I'll
  show you what has happened."</p>

  <p>He seized the boy's arm and raced him across the sand dunes. Bill noticed
  that Uncle Bob was not very steady on his legs, like a man who was very stiff
  or very tired. They had not gone more than three hundred yards when they came
  on a little plane, the new Phantom Gnat which was the apple of Uncle Bob's
  eye. It did not look like a wreck, for it sat as lightly in that sandy hollow
  as a mayfly on a stream.</p>

  <p>"No, there was no crash," Bill was told. "I made a fair landing, but just
  in time, for there's bad mischief there. Nothing that a good mechanic with
  proper spares couldn't put right in twenty minutes. Only, you see, I haven't
  got the spares&mdash;that's my infernal carelessness. As it is, the thing
  might be scrap-iron for all the use it is to me at present.... Man, I was
  twenty-seven hours ahead of the record when this dashed catastrophe
  happened.... As it is, I'm about twelve hours to the good, if I could get on.
  Only I can't. I'm absolutely and eternally dished. I might as well be down in
  the middle of the Atlantic."</p>

  <p>The sun was getting hotter and brighter, and the glory of quintessential
  light made every sandhill shine like polished gold.</p>

  <p>"I've food and water enough for a couple of days," Uncle Bob went on.
  "After that I perish, for there's not much chance of being picked up, and
  I'll never reach Farakesh." He seemed not to be talking to Bill, but
  communing with himself.</p>

  <p>"Where's Farakesh?" Bill asked.</p>

  <p>Uncle Bob flung a wild arm towards the west.</p>

  <p>"Somewhere out there.... I took my bearings when I landed, but the maps
  for this part of the world are no more use than a sick-headache. Farakesh
  might be fifty miles or it might be a hundred, and on a compass course I'm
  not likely to hit it off&mdash;let alone the chances against slogging the
  distance before my supplies gave out.... And what about you? I don't know how
  you got here, but now you're in the same boat as me, and we're both for
  it."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," said Bill. "Don't worry about me, Uncle Bob. Mother
  was so sad about you this morning ('This morning!' Uncle Bob wailed)&mdash;we
  all were except Peter&mdash;that I had to do something. What's Farakesh?"</p>

  <p>"It's a French post ... Spahis, I believe. I don't think they've any
  planes there, but they're sure to have Citroens and mechanics. They could
  patch me up all right, but I might as well wish for the moon."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Bill felt very old, far older than his uncle.</p>

  <p>"I want you to write a letter, please," he said. "A letter to the French,
  saying what you want."</p>

  <p>"To be picked up by the postman on his rounds, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"No. By me," said Bill. "Don't ask questions, Uncle Bob, for I can't
  explain, but please write the letter. There's no time to waste, if you're to
  beat the record."</p>

  <p>"I'm mad," said Uncle Bob, "undoubtedly mad," and he put his hands to his
  head. But he also ferreted about in the plane and produced a pencil and
  paper. First he wrote a message in English, explaining his whereabouts as
  well as he could and the nature of the help he wanted. Then below he wrote a
  French translation. Then he put it in an envelope and addressed it to the
  Commandant at Farakesh.</p>

  <p>"This is like putting a request for help into a bottle and chucking it
  into the ocean just when you're going to be washed off your raft," he said.
  "Now, you amazing child, what do you propose to do?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to Farakesh," said Bill. "Please don't look round. I promise
  not to be long."</p>

  <p>Bill put a sandhill between himself and the plane and twisted his
  stick.... He found himself in a dusty hollow where a string of horses was
  exercising, with riders who appeared to be dressed in white nightgowns and
  nightcaps. There was a long, low, white building before him with a dome in
  the centre. There was also a group of short dusty palm trees, and a pool of
  dirty green water surrounded by a stone coping, and, on the high ground
  behind, a jungle of thorns intersected by sandy roads.</p>

  <p>That was all that Bill's eyes took in of Farakesh, for he had no time for
  the study of landscape. He marched up to the entrance where a sentry was on
  duty, a man in faded blue uniform whose rifle carried a queer thin kind of
  bayonet.</p>

  <p>"<i>Pour Monsieur le Commandant</i>," said Bill, drawing upon his exiguous
  store of the French tongue.</p>

  <p>The sentry, confronted by a small boy in a tweed suit of knickerbockers, a
  tweed cap and muddy shoes, nearly had a fit. He brought down the butt of his
  rifle with a clang on the stone, and called upon the Virgin and the Saints.
  He cried shrilly for his colleagues, and soon Bill was surrounded by an
  excited group who plied him with questions in a French which he did not
  understand. Then an officer came along and the group stood to attention.</p>

  <p>He was a very lean officer and he was scarcely less excited than the
  sentry. He, too, began a cross-examination, but Bill could not make anything
  of his rapid speech and decided that he had better not try. He only shook his
  head and smiled and pointed to the letter.</p>

  <p>The officer took him by the hand and led him indoors through many
  whitewashed passages to a room where a little grizzled old man sat at a table
  covered with papers. The little old man, who Bill decided must be the
  Commandant, had two lines of medal ribbons on his breast.</p>

  <p>Then followed a vivacious colloquy. Uncle Bob's letter was opened and
  read, and more officers were summoned. "It is without doubt the Capitaine
  Robert Askew," Bill made out that much of the conversation. "But how? But
  why?"</p>

  <p>Bill found himself the object of the acutest interest, and he seemed to be
  referred to as an "<i>enfant merveilleux</i>." He only smiled and nodded.</p>

  <p>Maps were eagerly unrolled. They seemed to know where Uncle Bob was, and a
  spot was marked and calculations made. Bill heard the number
  "<i>soixante-dix</i>" repeated many times and joined to the word
  "<i>kilometres</i>."</p>

  <p>Then the conclave was suddenly broken up. He was taken to a large cool
  room full of long tables, and given food&mdash;a big glass of milk as thick
  as cream which had an odd lemony taste, the best dates he had ever eaten, and
  delicious little thin sugar cakes.</p>

  <p>Then he was led out into the sunshine, where two long squat motor-cars
  were waiting, with very broad wheels. There was an officer and a man in each,
  and an assortment of ironmongery. Bill was packed into the first car, the
  Commandant to his disgust kissed him on both cheeks, and he was whirled into
  the glittering desert. But first an officer had twined a long gauzy white
  cloth round his head, a thing like a turban. Bill realised that a cap suited
  for an Oxfordshire winter was scarcely adequate in a Sahara noon. Bill was to
  remember that journey because of its acute discomfort. Almost at once he felt
  sick, either because of the bumpy ground or the luncheon he had eaten. Also
  he was soon horribly afraid, for never man drove like that French driver.
  They invited jolts which would have smashed most axles, and they coasted
  gaily along the slopes of hills where nothing but the pace prevented the car
  from toppling sideways. Bill clutched at his wits and prayed that it would
  soon be over, and only the memory of Uncle Bob and a lingering scrap of
  prudence kept him from twisting his stick and vanishing.</p>

  <p>By and by they came into deep sand and had to slow down, and Bill's nausea
  diminished; and when at the end of four hours they saw a fire of dry scrub on
  a distant hillock, which Uncle Bob had lit for a mark, he felt his own master
  again. He was pleased that Uncle Bob had lit the fire, for it showed that he
  had some confidence in his nephew.</p>

  <p>Then there were bowings and handshakings and a great deal of rapid French,
  and Uncle Bob and the mechanics were busy with the inside of the engine. A
  fire was made, a little anvil was set up, and for an hour in that blistering
  noontide men hammered and screwed and bored. Then the work was over. Uncle
  Bob climbed into the pilot's seat, and taxied along the sand, and the engine
  proved to be working sweetly. He got out again and shook hands with the
  Frenchmen, and they all made him speeches.</p>

  <p>Bill, foreseeing the end of his duties, had climbed to the top of one of
  the dunes. "Good-bye, Uncle Bob, and good luck," he cried, when he saw that
  all was well.</p>

  <p>Uncle Bob, reawakened to his nephew's presence, exclaimed and began to run
  towards him. So did the Frenchmen. "Bill!" he called. "Come here, Bill!" and
  the others shouted about a miraculous child.</p>

  <p>But Bill felt that further intercourse would be embarrassing. He nipped
  down the far side of the dune and twirled his stick....</p>

  <p>He was standing in Elder's Spinney on sodden turf, while a fine rain was
  filtering through the beeches. The sand of the Sahara was in the crinkles of
  his shoes and knickerbockers and in the corners of his eyes. When he had gone
  half a mile he suddenly remembered that he was still wearing the turban which
  had been given him at Farakesh. This he removed and stuffed into a rabbit
  hole.</p>

  <p>That evening at tea he told the family that there was a rumour in the
  village that Uncle Bob was all right, but he was not believed till the
  wireless confirmed the news. Next morning a late edition of an enterprising
  penny paper announced the safe arrival of Captain Askew at Croydon, and his
  reception by the Under-secretary for Air. He had broken the record by eight
  hours.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE ADVENTURE OF THE IVORY VALLEY&mdash;I</h2>

  <p class="first">THE news of Uncle Bob's success put Bill into a state of
  high exaltation. He felt proud of himself, for, though he owed his
  achievement to the magic stick, he had surely shown boldness in his use of
  it.</p>

  <p>It was one of those hopeless days which mid-winter brings to the English
  Midlands. Rain fell with a dull persistency, and an east wind swirled round
  the manor gables, coming through the gap between the rookery and the tithe
  barn. Bill did not suffer much from cold, but he loved bright weather, and he
  felt himself homesick for yesterday's riot of sunlight. Also he hungered for
  more of Africa. He had been in the Solomon Islands, and had seen there one of
  the countries of his dreams. He had smelt the hot drought of the Sahara and
  looked over its yellow distances. What he wanted now to round off his
  experiences was a tropical forest. Peter was bed-ridden with his cold, and
  after breakfast Bill sat himself by the library fire. He had the day before
  him, and, since it was his family's habit to disregard weather, he would be
  allowed to go off with sandwiches in his pocket to try for snipe on the
  fringes of Alemoor. But Alemoor was not for him. He wanted colour and light
  and mystery.</p>

  <p>He was a great devourer of travel books, and could have reeled off the
  names of many outlandish places. Central Africa had always been one of his
  fancies, partly because his father as a young man had gone there after big
  game. Bill remembered his father's tales&mdash;how he had looked at the
  summit of the Mountains of the Moon from a hundred miles off and thought it a
  thunder-cloud&mdash;how he had first seen the silver cone of Kilimanjaro
  while lost in the waterless bush&mdash;how he had pushed inside the fringes
  of the dark Congo forest. Certain names&mdash;Ruwenzori, Tanganyika,
  Ruanda&mdash;sang in Bill's head like tunes.</p>

  <p>But especially he remembered one of his father's tales which an old hunter
  had told him in Mozambique. He was a grizzled old man called Stubber, and he
  had a withered leg which a lion had once chawed. He had been a famous
  elephant-hunter in his day, and this was his story.</p>

  <p>Somewhere in the mountains was a valley where the elephants went when they
  felt death approaching. They had done this for thousands of years, and the
  place was full of ivory&mdash;such tusks as no hunter had ever looked on. The
  way to it was hard to find, and Stubber had never been there himself, though
  he had often tried to reach it. One or two men had looked at the valley from
  the neighbouring ridges, but had not been able to make their way back to
  it.</p>

  <p>But let a bold man go there, said Stubber, and let him blaze a trail for
  transport, and he had in his hand the fortune of kings. For, said he,
  diamonds are going down in price, and gold isn't what it was, but fine ivory
  will have its market till the crack of doom.</p>

  <p>Bill had no commercial ambitions. <i>Bands</i> would not allow that. He
  got out the big atlas and poured over a map of equatorial Africa. His father
  had not been very clear which mountains Stubber had meant, for the old fellow
  had been so drunk for a week after the tale that he could get no more out of
  him. There seemed to be a good many mountain ranges&mdash;Rudolf, Kenya,
  Kilimanjaro, Ruwenzori, and a lot of volcanoes. His father had said that if
  he had had more time during his hunting trip he would have had a shot at
  finding the Ivory Valley. Why, Bill asked himself, should he not take on the
  job? Stubber had been vague, but the magic staff would know all about it.</p>

  <p>Bill looked out of the library window and watched the rain drifting over
  the lawn. He felt a great longing for Africa. Without more ado he went up to
  his bedroom and got into flannel shorts and a thin shirt; then he put on his
  thickest overcoat and announced to his mother that he was going out for the
  day.</p>

  <p>She made no objection.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you are taking your ulster with you," she said, "for it is very
  cold, and you are usually rather naughty about wrapping up. Don't be a minute
  later than four o'clock in getting back. The Harding children are coming to
  tea, and Peter is in bed, so you will have to be a good boy and help to
  entertain them."</p>

  <p>As Bill dived into the thick cover of Wildash Great Spinney he thought
  with amusement of the Harding children. Two foolish little pigtailed girls!
  He hid his gun and his overcoat among the bracken and stood up to twirl the
  stick in clothes fit only for the hottest July afternoon.</p>

  <p>His first thought was that the staff had misunderstood him. He had
  pictured a valley like a Highland glen, a bright open place with a tumbling
  burn in the midst of it. Instead he found himself in a cavern.</p>

  <p>It was an enormous cavern, at least half a mile broad and a mile or two
  long. It was dark, the sun being not yet high enough to enter it, but Bill
  saw far above him a band of deep violet sky. On all sides were sheer walls of
  rock, black as coal at the foot, but showing a faint pink towards the summit.
  Never had he seen, never had he dreamed of, such tremendous precipices. Even
  a bird would be weary before it surmounted them.</p>

  <p>The floor of the valley seemed to be sand and rock, and there was no
  stream. Indeed, the intense dryness of the place was what first struck him,
  far drier than the Sahara of yesterday. His mouth seemed in a moment to grow
  hot and his lips to grow hard, while he felt an odd difficulty in drawing
  breath.</p>

  <p>But the main thing was the stench. It was awful&mdash;a combination of all
  the worst smells that Bill ever remembered. It afflicted him like a
  toothache; also he felt giddy and a little sick. He sat down, and presently
  jumped up, for on the ground there was something&mdash;something rotting and
  horrible.</p>

  <p>It took all his fortitude to carry on. Holding his nose he looked round
  him. He was close to the lower end of the valley, and the ground was piled
  with gruesome shapes&mdash;heaps of grey, dust-covered skin, which had split
  in parts and showed awful blue decomposing flesh. Out of these masses stuck
  yellow tusks like the bowsprits of ships. He was in a graveyard, an open
  graveyard, where the corpses of great beasts lay like pebbles on a beach.</p>

  <p>He could not stay there, for he was retching with nausea, and he was in
  terror of fainting and falling down among these horrid relics. He must move,
  for a little way ahead he thought he saw what looked like barer ground strewn
  with whitish-grey stones. So he ran, stumbling, picking his way among the
  rotting masses, and now and then slipping on some slimy horror. With one hand
  holding his nose and the other clutching his stick, he managed to get out of
  the lower trough of the valley to a higher level.</p>

  <p>Here the stench began to abate, and in its place came a dry, half-sweet
  smell, like that of an old calf-bound book, or the vaults of the village
  church when summer abated their damp. He realised the meaning of it all. In
  the lower end of the valley were the elephants that had come there recently
  to die, but he was now moving towards the relics of ancient death.</p>

  <p>It was a marvellous place in which he found himself. The sun was getting
  up in the heavens and about half of one side of the rocks was a rosy gold.
  The light was now clear enough to reveal the whole extent of the valley. Bill
  found himself walking in a place exactly like a seashore&mdash;only instead
  of sand there was a fine grey dust, into which myriads of dead elephants had
  crumbled. Everywhere, piled and scattered at random, were things like the
  ribs of old shipwrecked boats.</p>

  <p>Such tusks he had never dreamed of. Some were like the jaw-bones of whales
  which he remembered seeing at coast villages in Scotland. They were black
  with age, but when he scraped with his penknife he revealed the white ivory
  beneath. Some had got a dull yellow colour with queer red ochreous stains. It
  was the size of them more than their number that amazed him, and then he knew
  the reason. The elephants who came here to die must have been the kings of
  the herd, the finest and strongest, who could escape their enemies of the
  forest and find a natural death of old age.</p>

  <p>He could breathe freely now, though there was still that dryness in his
  throat which made him cough. He had no longer any repulsion towards the
  things at his feet. They seemed to him natural and harmless, like the horns
  of deer which hung in the hall and corridors at home.</p>

  <p>As he picked his way through the dust he felt very solemn. He was the
  first mortal that had ever entered this sepulchre. Many had tried for it and
  fought their way up through the desert and jungles, but none had ever trod
  this floor. The thought did not make Bill exult. He felt very much as he had
  felt in church the week before when he attended old Grampound's funeral.</p>

  <p>And then suddenly his mood changed. He looked up at the beetling walls and
  felt himself choking; he was alone here in this pit of death, a prisoner in a
  tomb.</p>

  <p>Bill was not much afraid of ghosts, and this bare silent place was not
  ghostly, for it had no connection with human life. But he felt what, if he
  had known it, the Greeks called "panic," the terror of man in the face of a
  nature which he has not subdued.</p>

  <p>He felt his heart fluttering and something moving in his throat which
  stopped his breath. For a second his eyes dazzled and he almost fainted. Then
  an overpowering desire came upon him to escape, and with that desire a little
  clearness of mind.</p>

  <p>He twirled the staff and wished himself on the top of the cliffs, on the
  containing rim of the valley.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE ADVENTURE OF THE IVORY
     VALLEY&mdash;II</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was suddenly quite cool, and Bill breathed pleasantly
  again.</p>

  <p>He looked back, and there beneath him&mdash;miles beneath him it seemed,
  like a landscape seen through the wrong end of a telescope&mdash;was the
  Ivory Valley. From the height on which he stood it was so distant that the
  bottom seemed only a blur of grey, like the floor of the sea when you look
  down from a boat through deep waters. No one standing on that ridge could
  realise what lay at the foot of the sword-cut. How did the dying beasts
  enter?&mdash;that was what puzzled Bill.</p>

  <p>It was a very wonderful place. At the head of the valley was a huge
  moraine, and beyond it a glistening cap of snow. There were the shoulders and
  summits of other mountains in the same direction, which Bill realised was the
  west. But to east and north a blue plain ran out to the horizon, a plain with
  a shimmering haze in the far distance. It must have been very far below him,
  for in the foreground wave after wave of foot-hills descended to it like a
  cascade.</p>

  <p>Not only the view but the air told Bill how high up he was. It would have
  been chilly, but for the glare of the sun which wrapped him round like a warm
  bath. Bill's tweed cap was not much of a protection, so he used his
  handkerchief to screen his neck.</p>

  <p>Then he took note of his immediate surroundings. He dare not look back
  into the depths of the valley, so he turned to the flat rim of it. There was
  turf here very like Scotland, short mossy turf, with wonderful little
  flowers. But a few yards from the edge a covert began. Bill called it a
  covert to himself, for it should have been a covert, but it was magnified to
  the dimensions of a forest.</p>

  <p>There was heather, real heather, but it grew as tall as birch trees. There
  was bracken of a most miraculous size. There were what looked like
  groundsels, but they had become as big as oaks. It was as if a bit of Scots
  moorland had been swollen into a garden for giants. And there was everywhere
  a delicious aromatic fragrance.</p>

  <p>But what concerned Bill was the geography of the Ivory Valley. How did the
  elephants enter? He felt all the zest of the explorer on the edge of a mighty
  secret. Clearly not at the top, for there was no inlet by the way of the snow
  mountain. Not by the sides, for nothing could descend those glassy rock
  walls. It must be by the foot. Now Bill judged that he was not more than a
  mile from the foot, so he started off to prospect along the rim.</p>

  <p>For the sake of shade he dived into the covert, emerging only when the
  bracken grew too much for him. There were birds in plenty&mdash;one looking
  very like a blackbird with a scarlet breast; and a kind of finch which piped
  divinely. Also there was a multitude of bright moths, a subject of which Bill
  knew nothing. But there was no sign of anything dangerous, though Bill went
  circumspectly, for he remembered his father's tales of mambas and fierce
  bush-buck rams and crouching leopards.</p>

  <p>Presently he was forced back on to the scarp, which had changed its
  character. The turf was gone and the wildwood had crept up and covered it. He
  made his way to the edge in quest of a view. He was very near the bottom end
  of the valley&mdash;that much he realised, but he could not make out any way
  of entrance.</p>

  <p>A few yards more and he discovered it. There was a rift in the containing
  wall, for the ground seemed to sink under his feet. He looked down over
  tree-tops to a V-shaped gap far below him.</p>

  <p>It seemed possible to descend, and Bill, after a moment's hesitation,
  started out. The angle was steep, but not too steep to prevent trees finding
  a footing, and it was through a clinging forest that Bill made his way. He
  began by slithering down a long bank of earth and stones which scarified his
  bare legs. After that he grew bold and took big leaps, calculating to stop
  himself by the trees. In this way he descended about half the distance into
  the gap.</p>

  <p>Then the character of the wood changed. The whole hillside seemed to ooze
  water. Every few yards was a spring and the ground was seamed with tiny
  watercourses. With the water came a different vegetation. The wood took on a
  new character, for it was thicker, wilder, greener, and desperately tangled.
  Asparagus creepers began to festoon the trees, and bright flowers of a
  species quite unknown to Bill clothed the sides of each runnel. Also there
  were thorns, long trailing things which almost tore the shirt and shorts from
  his body. It had become very hot, and the sweat clouded his eyes.</p>

  <p>Still he descended, rolling, slipping, jumping, until he came to a covert
  so thick that he had to crawl with his face almost in the mud. This was the
  place for a tiger-cat or a bush-buck ram, and the thought made Bill increase
  his speed. He was determined to get to the gap, but he held himself ready at
  any moment to twirl the staff.</p>

  <p>The jungle ceased and Bill finished his course on a smooth slope of
  screes. He finished it dramatically, for he rolled the last hundred feet and
  stood up breathless to look about him.</p>

  <p>It was a pass sure enough, the entry into the Ivory Valley. Behind on the
  forest side was a long descending gulley, rolled smooth like an alley in a
  pine wood along which trees have been drawn. By this path the dying elephants
  had ascended from all Equatoria.</p>

  <p>On the valley side there was also a slope, but far steeper and sheerer. It
  was rubbed bare of both vegetation and stones, a long shoot of earth ending
  up among fallen boulders. Bill rubbed his eyes and saw that they were not
  boulders, but the rotting carcases he had already visited. It was like a
  gigantic toboggan run, and the elephants, when they wearily reached the pass,
  must have, with their last strength, glissaded into their sepulchre.</p>

  <p>Very still and solemn was Bill as he looked at this portal of death. Then
  a little way up on the left-hand side something caught his eye. It was a bare
  place, a rocky shelf, and something white lay on it.</p>

  <p>He saw that it was bones, and something told him that they were human.
  This had been the last camp of a pioneer who had found the valley only to
  die. Long ago the bones had been picked clean by bird and beast, and were now
  only to be distinguished by their blanched whiteness from the grey
  screes.</p>

  <p>There was something more there. Bill picked out of the stones five coins.
  They were discoloured and encrusted, but gold beyond doubt. He rubbed them
  and one showed a king's head on it, and another some spidery marks like
  Chinese letters. The dead adventurer must have belonged to a very distant
  generation.</p>

  <p>Bill pocketed them. This was not loot, he felt, but a legitimate find, and
  <i>Bands</i> could not disapprove.</p>

  <p>And then across the gap he saw that which put everything else out of his
  head. It was not a bush-buck ram or a leopard, but something far more
  formidable. A huge animal had come out of the covert. At first Bill thought
  it was a savage, for it squatted on its heels like a human being and beat its
  breast with its arms; also from its mouth came a dreadful throaty muttering,
  like that of some madman in a nightmare.</p>

  <p>The gorilla brooded like some obscene vampire that drew its life from this
  place of death. It had caught sight of Bill and was staring at him with red
  eyes. Then its muttering changed into a howl of rage. With one mighty bound
  it covered half the distance between them.</p>

  <p>Bill did not stay upon the order of his going.</p>

  <p>He sat in the dripping silence of Wildash Great Spinney for a full five
  minutes before the terrible sound had gone out of his ears. He felt very much
  shaken and solemnised, and also very cold. He was glad of his overcoat.</p>

  <p>"La, Master Bill!" Elsie the nurse exclaimed when she saw him. "What have
  you done to your clothes? You look as if you had been clawed by a gorilla."
  In high dudgeon she removed the ragged remains of his shirt and breeches.</p>

  <p>Bill behaved very well at tea. He was quiet and gentle, and played most
  amiably with the Harding children. He was glad to be back among the kindly
  faces of the living, even if they were pig-tailed little girls. He locked the
  five gold coins in his money-box, for they rather frightened him.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; BILL HEARS OF PRINCE ANATOLE</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was still a fortnight before the holidays ended, and
  to the employment of this space of time Bill addressed himself like a usurer.
  The position was not without difficulties.</p>

  <p>First there was Peter. Bill had decided that the discretion of that gay
  youth was not to be trusted. He could not be admitted further into the game,
  for his twittering nerves would certainly betray it. The Glenmore visit had
  convinced Bill of that, for with the utmost difficulty Peter had been
  prevented from blabbing the whole story next morning at breakfast. Threats
  were of no use, physical violence was futile, and the only way was to
  convince Peter that the adventure had been a dream. At Peter's age one is not
  an exact reasoner, and he had come to accept this view, especially as Bill
  had laid himself out to be especially kind to him, and he did not feel in the
  mood to contradict a beneficent brother.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Peter remained a snag. He was devoted to Bill and usually
  shared most of his holiday enterprises. But with Peter dogging his heels Bill
  could have no leisure for the magic staff, for he was resolute not to take
  Peter with him on any further adventures. Yet Bill's heart smote him. Peter
  was a good little chap and would have a dull time of it if Bill immured
  himself all day in the recesses of Alemoor. Besides, the family would ask
  questions&mdash;particularly Barbara, who was Peter's special protector.</p>

  <p>Then there was Uncle Bob. He was being entertained at some big dinner in
  London, and must remain in town for several days; but he had wired at once,
  in reply to the family's congratulations, offering a visit the following
  week. He said he wanted to see them all again, especially Bill. At any other
  time these words would have made Bill carry his head high, but now they only
  embarrassed him.</p>

  <p>For Uncle Bob's appearance would be awkward. He was certain to tell the
  story of Bill's miraculous appearance and heroic conduct. And what was Bill
  to say? He could of course deny it, but he had a dislike of telling lies, and
  he knew that he was not very good at it. As a matter of fact, Uncle Bob had
  decided that the whole episode had been a light-headed dream which
  inexplicably his French rescuers had shared. He was hopelessly puzzled, but
  any other conclusion would have meant that he had lost his reason. He only
  wanted to see Bill to make sure that he had not become a disembodied spirit.
  But a small boy is not, like his elders, under the bondage of a narrow
  reason. Bill was convinced that Uncle Bob must regard his visit as a real, if
  inexplicable, event, and be set on making enquiries.</p>

  <p>A way out appeared just before New Year. At breakfast one morning his
  mother had two announcements to make. Peter and Barbara had been asked to
  stay for a week with Aunt Alice in London. Barbara was joyful, and Peter, who
  had a taste for the pleasures of the metropolis, was not unwilling,
  especially as Aunt Alice was under bond to present him some day with a new
  camera, and he hoped to expedite the gift.</p>

  <p>"Bill, dear," his mother added, "don't you think it would be nice if you
  paid a visit to Grannie? You haven't been to see her for nearly a year, and
  she is getting pretty old, and she is so fond of you."</p>

  <p>She expected a protest, for visits to Grannie were not very popular with
  Bill. Grannie herself was an admitted darling, but she was very old, and very
  deaf, and very blind, and she did not get out of bed until the afternoon. She
  had a very old butler called Backus, who was rather cross, and an old maid
  called Grimes, who was very cross, and an old lame cook, with whom one could
  not take liberties, and an old head-housemaid who wore spectacles. The house,
  which was called Farover, was in a dull part of the next county, and there
  was little for a boy to do there. There was no shooting; if it froze hard
  there was no water near to skate on; there were no ponies; and there was
  nobody to play with except the parson's son, a red-headed urchin whom Bill
  detested.</p>

  <p>But to his mother's surprise Bill made no protest. He said meekly that he
  would rather like to see Grannie again, and that he did not mind if he went
  to Farover for a bit. His mother was so astounded by this renouncement of the
  habits of a lifetime that she asked anxiously if he was quite well. Little
  she knew the sudden exultation in her son's heart.</p>

  <p>For things had turned out unbelievably well. Peter was satisfactorily
  disposed of. The difficult meeting with Uncle Bob was prevented, and Farover
  would give him just that haunt of ancient peace which he needed. At Farover
  there was no one to question your doings, for no one was much interested in
  them. So long as you appeared duly at meals you might spend the intervening
  hours ranging the earth on a broomstick.</p>

  <p>So it was arranged that the car should deposit Bill at Farover the
  following evening after tea. Bill sequestered himself in the nursery and gave
  himself up to the study of a cutting which he had clipped from a picture
  paper much favoured by Barbara. It was all about a certain Prince
  Anatole.</p>

  <p>Bill had one peculiarity which is important for this tale. Every boy,
  apart from whatever success he may attain in games or books, is certain to
  have one hobby in which he is a master&mdash;in which, indeed, he absorbs
  knowledge unconsciously rather than acquires it. One will know everything
  that is to be known about the rigs of ships, another be a specialist on
  locomotives, a third on automobiles, a fourth on birds' nests, others on
  cricket averages, railway speeds, or athletic records.</p>

  <p>Most of Bill's friends were worshippers of speed, either in machines or in
  human beings. They knew all about speed-boats, and aeroplanes, and racing
  cars, and rapid people like Chicago gun-men. From the cinema, the press, and
  popular romances they had equipped themselves with a profound knowledge of
  the ways of racketeers and hi-jackers and "bad men" generally.</p>

  <p>For such things Bill cared not at all. His imagination ranged in more
  ancient pastures, and he was pre-eminently a child of the Old World. He
  revelled in history, and in modern life he liked what carried on the pageant
  of history&mdash;courts and castles and turret stairs, secret doors opening
  on dark lakes, dim cities of the East and crumbling palaces. Bill would not
  have crossed the street to look at the most notorious gangster, but he would
  have welcomed the spectacle of a Usurper, a Pretender, or a King in Exile.
  Chicago said nothing to him, but Samarkand and Stamboul said much. From some
  mysterious cause the Balkans were for him a name to conjure with. I think the
  reason was that he had once read in a book that there was always trouble in
  the Balkans in the spring.</p>

  <p>Now the column he had clipped from Barbara's paper contained some
  fascinating news about the Balkan kingdom of Gracia. It was a very unhappy
  kingdom, for it could not make up its mind what kind of government it wanted.
  The House of Paleologue was on the throne, but King Nicholas the Fifth was
  very old and nearly witless, and the power was in the hands of an ambitious
  Prime Minister called Kuno, who was believed to fancy himself as head of a
  Grach republic. Kuno was of peasant origin and had been a good soldier in the
  war, in which Gracia had suffered heavily from both sides.</p>

  <p>King Nicholas had no children alive, and his heir was his grandson, Prince
  Anatole, a boy of fourteen. According to Barbara's paper, the young Prince's
  life was a difficult one. He was not allowed to live with his grandfather in
  the capital city of Grachovo, but was immured in the castle of Mamizan, forty
  miles off in the mountains. The Grachs were a proud people, but they were
  also hot-headed and fickle, and Kuno seemed to have convinced them that they
  could not go on with a demented King. A republic would have been certain but
  for Prince Anatole, for there was a considerable loyalist party which adhered
  to him. If the boy could be got out of the road then Kuno's ambitions would
  certainly be fulfilled.</p>

  <p>This story took a strong grip on Bill's mind. Here was a boy only a year
  older than himself who was the centre of desperate plots, and whose life must
  be in hourly danger. Bill had a preference for monarchy and wanted Anatole to
  win. But he felt that the odds were against him, a prisoner in a lonely
  castle, with Kuno's guards clanking their rifles at the gate.</p>

  <p>The more he thought about the situation the less he liked it. The figure
  of that solitary child hag-rode his fancy and gave him no peace. Something
  must be done about it, and done at once. He remembered the horrid stories of
  King John and Prince Arthur, and the murdered princes in the Tower.</p>

  <p>All the way to Farover Bill meditated profoundly. He arrived at half-past
  six, and, after greeting his grandmother, was shown his bedroom by the cross
  butler, and given supper in what had once been the nursery. Bill announced
  that he was sleepy and meant to go to bed early. So he was left by Backus
  reading beside his bedroom fire, after strict instructions as to how to turn
  off the electric light.</p>

  <p>Bill did not go to bed. Instead he put on a sweater over his waistcoat,
  for he thought that a Balkan castle in the mountains might be cold. Then a
  little nervously, but with the sense that he was embarking on the high seas
  of romance, he twirled the stick and wished himself with Prince Anatole in
  Mamizan.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF MAMIZAN</h2>

  <p class="first">HE found himself on a slippery roof which was edged by low
  battlements. It was pitch-dark and an icy wind cut through Bill's clothes,
  sweater and all, and froze the marrow in his bones. He took a step and
  promptly sat down hard, and slithered until he was brought up by the parapet.
  There was no sound except the surge of the wind among the gables, the roar of
  an adjacent stream, and the melancholy hooting of a great owl.</p>

  <p>Bill was horribly scared. Had the magic staff made some awful mistake?</p>

  <p>Then he heard another noise, which seemed to be human. Someone close to
  him was weeping&mdash;gulping, at any rate, to choke down tears. Bill felt
  his nerves steady.</p>

  <p>"Hist!" he cried. "Is there anybody there?"</p>

  <p>He got to his feet, put out his hand and touched something solid but soft.
  It was so dark that he could distinguish only a lump of deeper blackness, and
  from that lump the sound came. Yes, beyond doubt, it was sobbing. Somebody
  was crouching there in dire trouble.</p>

  <p>Bill screwed up his courage and poked at the lump. That produced
  developments. The dark mass straightened itself, and even in the blackness
  Bill saw that it was a small human figure.</p>

  <p>It was a human figure in a panic, for its next move seemed to be to try to
  escape. It shuffled and sprawled away from Bill, and it suffered Bill's fate,
  for it slipped upon the steep tiles and was brought up in a heap against the
  parapet.</p>

  <p>To realise that someone is afraid of you is a wonderful cure for your own
  fears. Bill felt suddenly quite brave and calm.</p>

  <p>"Here! stop!" he shouted against the wind. "Don't run away. I won't do you
  any harm."</p>

  <p>For a minute no sound of movement came from the huddled figure. Then a
  voice emerged from it, a small broken voice, which was just loud enough for
  Bill to hear.</p>

  <p>"English!" it said. "It speaks English. Is it a ghost?"</p>

  <p>"It's me," said Bill, "and I'm not a ghost. I've come to help you. Don't
  scurry off again or you'll make me break my neck. You can feel me and see
  that I'm real enough."</p>

  <p>He crawled along the gutter till he could touch the other. He found his
  hand and brought it to his cheek&mdash;an icy little hand.</p>

  <p>"Touch my face," he said, "and you will see that I'm not a ghost. I'm
  English. I've come to help you."</p>

  <p>Then Bill remembered that in his pocket he had an electric torch, a
  Christmas present from Peter. He pressed the catch and made a tiny circle of
  light in the darkness. This revealed a boy of little more than his own age,
  with black hair and pale dirty cheeks. He was dressed in clothes far too
  small for him, and he had torn a great rent in his breeches. His feet and
  legs were bare and blue with cold, and one of his toes was bleeding. He
  looked miserably ill-clad for the place and the weather, for compared with
  his garb Bill's was like a Polar explorer's.</p>

  <p>"You are Prince Anatole, aren't you?" said Bill. He was relieved to find
  that the boy spoke English, for he had forgotten the possibility of their
  having no common tongue.</p>

  <p>"I am Prince Anatole Paleologue," said the boy. He spoke proudly, though
  his teeth were beginning to chatter. "And you?"</p>

  <p>Bill confessed his name. "I've come to help you, if you want me to," he
  said.</p>

  <p>This was different from his expectation, for he had thought to find the
  Prince either in a dungeon or in some place like the House of Lords, whereas
  he apparently abode on the roof-tops like a bird.</p>

  <p>"I say, how do you know English?" was his next question.</p>

  <p>"I was at school in England until a year ago. Marvell's."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm blowed!" Peter was going to Marvell's next year, and half
  Bill's friends had been there.</p>

  <p>"May I ask you a question?" said the boy. He spoke slowly and a little
  primly, as if drawing up his English from a deep well. "How in the name of
  the blessed angels did you get here?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see," said Bill, "I can't quite tell you, for I don't know.
  It's magic&mdash;quite good magic. But the point is that I <i>am</i> here,
  and I've come to help you. Do you mind telling me&mdash;do you usually live
  on this roof?"</p>

  <p>In the glow of the torch the boy's face showed a wan smile.</p>

  <p>"I came here because I was pursued. I am in danger. This is my sanctuary,
  which I have found for myself. The road to it is difficult, for you must
  climb out of the second library window and reach for a rain-pipe, and then
  you climb the pipe, which is not easy if the wind blows."</p>

  <p>"Golly!" said Bill. "That's a job I don't think I would take on. Who's
  after you?"</p>

  <p>The boy shuddered.</p>

  <p>"I don't know ... I have been here for so many months and only twice I
  have been allowed outside the gates. That is why I found the way to the roof,
  for I was tired of being indoors. I have climbed over the whole castle, but
  no one knows it. It was not easy, for they watch me as if I were a bag of
  gold.... To-night before my supper.... I will tell you all&mdash;old Mother
  Linda brings me my supper&mdash;she is the only kind face here, for she was
  my nurse when I was little. To-night Mother Linda did not come, but instead
  there was a terrible row on the grand staircase. I ran out and saw the
  sentries struggling with strange men, rough men like peasants from the
  mountains. I thought it was my friends come to rescue me, but as I looked I
  changed my mind. For I saw that the sentries, after making much noise, let
  themselves be overcome and bound, and that all the time they were laughing
  and joking with their assailants. So I saw that somewhere there was dirty
  work, and I ran to hide myself. One man saw me and followed, but I was too
  quick. I dodged through the armoury and slammed the big library door behind
  me. That door is stiff and hard to open, so I had time to get out of the
  window...."</p>

  <p>Bill wrinkled his brow.</p>

  <p>"I expect that was Kuno's doing."</p>

  <p>"What do you know about Kuno?" the boy asked in a startled voice.</p>

  <p>"I have heard about him. The papers said that he was the man who was
  keeping you here. I tell you what&mdash;he wants to kidnap you and pretend
  that you are lost&mdash;or perhaps dead."</p>

  <p>"That is what I think," said the boy in a small, sad voice. "Here in this
  castle of Mamizan I am within forty miles of my grandfather. Some day I hope
  that my friends will release me. But if I were deep among the hills, then I
  should be buried as if I were in a grave, and my friends would despair."</p>

  <p>"You are jolly well not going to be kidnapped," said Bill. "Cheer up,
  Anatole.... But if we sit here much longer we'll freeze. I tell you
  what&mdash;I feel jolly hungry, and you say you've had no supper. What about
  getting something to eat?"</p>

  <p>"I am horribly empty," said the boy, "but if I go back into the castle I
  will be captured. And besides, Mother Linda will be too scared to think of
  supper."</p>

  <p>"There are other places besides this castle," said Bill. "What's a good
  place for food? Anywhere you like&mdash;I don't mind how far it is."</p>

  <p>"My grandfather's palace in Grachovo is full of good things," said Prince
  Anatole.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but we can't go there and just ask for dinner. Suppose you were
  living in the palace and were hungry and didn't want to make a fuss, what
  would you do?"</p>

  <p>"There is the larder," said the boy. "It is as big as a church and full of
  hams and sausages and pies. And there is the still-room next door, where
  there will be tarts of many fruits, and spiced bread, and jams and sweet
  cakes."</p>

  <p>"That's the place for us," said Bill. "What is the exact address? 'The
  Larder, The Palace, Grachovo'&mdash;is that how you pronounce it? Now look
  here, Anatole. You put your arm round my waist, and when I say 'Go' hold
  tight. We're going out to supper."</p>

  <p>But at that moment a sound fell on their ears which was not the wind. It
  was the sound of something heavy stumbling in the gutter. The two boys
  crowded together, and Bill turned off his torch. The noise grew louder. As it
  chanced, a thin moon at the moment came from behind a bank of clouds, and
  they saw a man's figure silhouetted against the wild sky.</p>

  <p>Bill was enjoying himself. One of the pursuers had found the track of the
  boy at the library window and had discovered the road by the rain-pipe. He
  must be a bold fellow to have undertaken the climb, for he was very big and
  heavy. Bill flicked on the torch and flashed it on him, and a creature was
  revealed as shaggy as a bear, with naked feet, and wearing a sheepskin coat
  with the fleece outside. He cried out in triumph and took a long stride
  towards the boys.</p>

  <p>Waving his torch, Bill scrambled to his feet and yelled like a banshee.
  The man stopped in his tracks, for he saw two boys where he had only expected
  one. Bill saw his face pale and his hand go to his breast to cross
  himself.</p>

  <p>Then the Prince took a hand. What he cried out Bill did not know, for it
  was in a strange tongue, but it sounded awful, and the man took a step
  backward. Clearly the Prince was desperate, for he must have believed that
  capture was imminent, since he had no knowledge of Bill's magic powers.</p>

  <p>"Let us attack him," the boy screamed. "We can fling him from the
  battlements." And indeed the pursuer seemed to be in such a state of panic
  that an attack might have succeeded.</p>

  <p>"No we don't," said Bill. "Let's go to supper. Hold tight, will you?"</p>

  <p>He twisted the stick, and the man of the mountains, shaken by finding two
  yelling maniacs instead of one frightened child, was now bereft of his senses
  by the sudden disappearance of the whole outfit. He tumbled on to his face in
  a swoon of terror.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE ADVENTURE OF THE ROYAL LARDER</h2>

  <p class="first">HALF an hour later the two boys were sitting on a great cask
  of beer, placed endways on the floor of a place which seemed half a church
  crypt and half a corner in the Army and Navy Stores. They had arrived at the
  larder in black darkness which was made comfortable by the smell of bins and
  boxes, and sides of dead animals, and great hams in wicker cases. The air was
  icy cold, but hunger made them forget it, and they fossicked about until on a
  shelf they found what was clearly the remains of the royal dinner. It had
  been an ample dinner, for there were several roast partridges untouched, and
  a pie with only one wedge cut out of it, and the better part of a salmon.</p>

  <p>The boys had no plates or knives or forks or spoons, but each had a
  competent pocket-knife, and with the help of these they proceeded to make a
  messy but satisfying meal. They had nothing in the nature of bread, so
  Anatole suggested a visit to the still-room. The door proved to be locked,
  and the magic staff had to be called into use. Anatole behaved wonderfully
  well about the staff, for he accepted its ministrations and asked no
  questions.</p>

  <p>"We are better here," he observed, "for we cannot be surprised."</p>

  <p>That still-room was full of treasures, and presently they had to desist
  with regret from their feast, for they could eat no more. There were cakes of
  every kind, including a confection somewhere between shortbread and almond
  cake, which fairly ravished Bill's soul. There were tall crystal jars of jam,
  which they spread thick on sponge-cake, and there were small crisp sugar
  biscuits, with which Bill filled his pockets in case of emergencies. Lastly
  they discovered a nest of bottles of bright-coloured syrups, with which they
  washed down their meal. One tasted of aniseed and burned their throats, but
  it sent a pleasant glow through their bodies. When they had finished and had
  perched themselves on the beer barrel they were content and confident once
  more, and Anatole's thin face had some colour in it.</p>

  <p>Bill looked at his watch, and saw that it was half-past ten, well after
  the hour when he should have been in bed.</p>

  <p>"Now for the next step," he said. "I suppose I should be getting you back
  to Mamizan."</p>

  <p>The Prince shivered. "I suppose so. But oh! I hate it ... and I am afraid.
  Perhaps the mountain men will still be there...."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they will. I tell you what. I'd better go first and prospect.
  D'you mind staying here until I come back? I'll leave you my torch&mdash;no,
  I had better take it with me, for I may need it. What's a safe place to land
  at in that castle&mdash;I mean a place where I can find out what is going on
  and not be spotted? You see, I don't know my way about."</p>

  <p>Anatole thought for a moment. "The best place is the alcove at the head of
  the grand staircase where the statues are. It is quite dark, but you can see
  down into the hall, and you are next door to the library and the council
  chamber."</p>

  <p>"Right! I'm off. I'll be back in ten minutes." Bill twirled the stick and
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>He found himself in an alcove which was shadowy, but not dark. There were
  heavy curtains across its entrance, but through them appeared the glow of a
  great illumination. He peeped out and found himself looking at a broad
  landing from which a wide staircase descended. The place blazed with lights,
  and from below came the unsteady flare of torches. At the top of the stairway
  stood an old woman with her back towards him.</p>

  <p>She was a tall old woman with a thing like a little black tea-tray on the
  top of her silver hair, and she was very, very angry. In a voice that
  suggested thunder and avalanches she was upbraiding the people who stood
  below. Answers came from them, stumbling, embarrassed answers. Then she
  turned round, flinging her apron over her head, and Bill could see that she
  was weeping.</p>

  <p>Clearly Mother Linda. It was plain that she was in deep affliction about
  something or somebody. It must be Prince Anatole, who was believed to have
  come to grief.</p>

  <p>She moved away to the right and Bill could peep farther through the
  curtains and even dared to venture to the head of the stairs. He saw men
  below, but they were not of the same type as the monster who had shown
  himself on the roof. They wore some kind of soldier's uniform, and they
  appeared to be in a panic, jabbering to each other and every now and then
  running to what seemed to be the main door of the castle.</p>

  <p>The syrup which had tasted of aniseed must have been a potent cordial, for
  it made Bill's brain very quick. He guessed in a moment what had happened.
  The kidnappers believed that they had scared the Prince into a flight which
  had ended in a fall from the roof, and had fled incontinent. The soldiers
  were now looking for his body among the rocks of the gorge. That was the
  meaning of the torches.</p>

  <p>Bill stole down the staircase until he reached the first angle, whence he
  could see the hall below. There was no one there, but the great door stood
  open, and he saw torches flickering in the windy night and heard the confused
  talk of men.... He ventured a little farther and presently was in the hall
  itself, where the ashes of a fire still smouldered on the cavernous hearth.
  His object was to get out of doors to see what the soldiers were doing; but
  he had not taken two steps across the hall before he pulled up.</p>

  <p>Some of them were coming back. There were two&mdash;one in the uniform of
  a common soldier, but the other a smarter fellow wearing a sword. They looked
  haggard and anxious and their eyes blinked in the bright light of the hall.
  They saw Bill and stopped, staring, in their tracks.</p>

  <p>Then Bill became inspired. He waved his stick and from his lips there came
  a wail of such blood-curdling poignancy that it almost frightened him. It
  certainly frightened the two soldiers, for they babbled like men demented and
  dropped on their knees.</p>

  <p>Bill sped up the stairs again and at the top he encountered Mother Linda.
  He thought that she held out her arms to him, but he had no time to wait, for
  he realised that he must be off. With another eldritch wail he twirled the
  stick, and the old woman and the two terror-stricken soldiers found
  themselves staring into vacancy.</p>

  <p>Anatole was still on the beer barrel, but he had sunk into the hollow
  between it and the wall and was sound asleep.</p>

  <p>"You can't go back to Mamizan," Bill told him, when he was fully awakened.
  "They think you're dead. They took me for your ghost, so I made a bit of a
  row and I left them praying like billy-o. We have got to decide on your next
  move. Why can't you stay here? This is your grandfather's house."</p>

  <p>The boy shook his head sadly. "My grandfather is old and weak and cannot
  protect me. If I were found in the Palace, I would only be sent back to
  Mamizan."</p>

  <p>"Well, haven't you any friends in Grachovo? The papers said there was a
  party behind you. You talked yourself about friends...."</p>

  <p>The boy exclaimed. "Most certainly I have friends. There is, above all,
  Prince Zosimo, who is the leader of the loyalists, and who is the cousin of
  my mother. I will go to him and he will hide me."</p>

  <p>Bill had dropped from the barrel and was stamping about with
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"Hide you be blowed! Don't you see you have got your chance? Kuno will
  give out that you have met with an accident and are dead, and that will mean
  that people will be sorry about you. Then you will suddenly appear, and
  people will be glad and come over to your side. That is the way things happen
  in history. It will be a knock-out blow for the republicans, and old Kuno
  will be in the soup. What is the phrase, 'hoist by his own Packard'?"</p>

  <p>Anatole followed Bill off the barrel. "That is good counsel. Give your
  orders, please. We will go to the palace of Prince Zosimo, which is only a
  quarter of a mile from here. We will go to the Prince's private cabinet."</p>

  <p>A stout man with close-cropped grizzled hair was writing at a table. He
  was in dressing-gown and pyjamas, for he had been about to go to bed, but had
  remembered a letter which should be written at once. He lifted his eyes from
  the paper and saw before him two strangely dressed boys. One of the boys
  carried in his hand a walking-stick.</p>

  <p>Prince Zosimo was a man of action. He took two steps and locked the door;
  then he folded Prince Anatole to his breast.</p>

  <p>"We will speak English," said Anatole a minute later, "which His
  Excellency completely understands. Do not ask me how I have escaped, for that
  must still be a secret. This is my English friend who has helped me. For the
  present call him Beel. Now I will tell you the events of this night."</p>

  <p>Anatole told the story well, and Prince Zosimo listened in growing
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"It is miraculous," he cried. "I will not ask questions, but how, by all
  the holy saints, you contrived to get here from Mamizan in an hour or two I
  do not comprehend.... But let that be. These pigs of republicans are in a
  cleft stick. They must announce your death, my dear Anatole, and who will
  believe their tale of an accident? We must work upon the suspicions of the
  people, who do not approve of the murder of children.... Then we must have an
  epiphany&mdash;a resurrection. In six days falls the festival of St.
  Lampadas, when the King, your grandfather, receives in state the notables of
  Gracia. That will be the fitting occasion.... But let us speak no more of it.
  I will think&mdash;think, and the two of you must go to bed, for you are like
  wraiths from fatigue. In the morning we will summon our friends and make a
  plan."</p>

  <p>So Bill found himself conducted by a tall man-servant to a room which was
  as warm as a green-house with hot pipes, and in which two camp-beds stood
  side by side, each covered with a lambskin quilt. Next door was a bathroom,
  and on the toilet table was laid out a selection from Prince Zosimo's
  brushes.</p>

  <p>"I must be off home," said Bill, when the servant had gone. "Rumple my bed
  as if I had slept in it, and do not let yourself be called before nine
  o'clock. I'll be back by then. Good night, Anatole. Sleep sound."</p>

  <p>It was half an hour after midnight when Bill crawled between the sheets in
  his lonely bedroom at Farover. He felt hungry, so he finished the sugar
  biscuits from the Grachovo larder with which he had filled his pockets.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; THE SECOND ADVENTURE OF MAMIZAN</h2>

  <p class="first">BILL did not wake up until half-past eight, and even then
  Backus, the butler, had to shake him. After that things went badly. His
  grandmother summoned him to her presence, and he had to listen for twenty
  minutes to her enquiries about his family. Backus was slow in getting his
  breakfast, and the sandwiches which he asked for, announcing that he proposed
  to go for a long walk and not be home until tea, were slow in appearing.
  Also, he had to write to his mother, as he had promised, and penmanship for
  Bill was a lengthy business. Happily the weather was fine, inclining to
  frost, so his day's plans were accepted as reasonable. But it was nearly
  half-past ten before, in a corner of the shrubbery, he twirled the staff.</p>

  <p>He had asked to be taken to the bedroom in Prince Zosimo's palace. The
  room was empty, his bed-clothes had been rumpled according to his
  instructions, but there was no sign of Anatole. Outside the air seemed to be
  dark with snow-flakes.</p>

  <p>Bill thought that he remembered the way to Prince Zosimo's cabinet, but he
  was wrong. Very soon he was lost in a labyrinth of passages, and when he
  found a stair it was only a side one, and took him into the back parts of the
  house. He stumbled upon a knot of servants who were gossiping on a landing,
  and his arrival produced a sensation. They surrounded him and questioned him
  in a tongue which he could not comprehend, and all he could do was to utter
  the word "Anatole" in the way in which Prince Zosimo had pronounced it the
  night before. The servants looked scared and nervous, and he could not make
  them understand him. But the situation was saved by the appearance of the
  footman who had first conducted him to his bedroom. He had clearly had his
  orders, for he said something peremptory to the others, bowed to Bill, and
  beckoned him to follow.</p>

  <p>He led him through further labyrinths until they reached the main
  staircase, where Bill recognised his whereabouts. There seemed to be a great
  many servants about, stationed at every corner, and he observed that they
  were all armed. "Queer people, the Grachs!" he reflected. "They let the
  Prince be shut up in a castle by his enemies and do nothing, but when they
  get him again they guard him like the Bank of England." The footman stopped
  at the door of the private cabinet, knocked and entered, while Bill remained
  outside. When he returned he opened the door for Bill, making another low
  bow.</p>

  <p>There were seven people in the room besides Prince Zosimo and Anatole.
  Anatole was sitting in a big chair of state, and his feet did not quite reach
  the ground, while the Prince was at his desk with papers before him. The
  others were mostly elderly men with pleasant faces, and one must have been a
  soldier, for he had a great scar on his forehead. There was only one young
  man, who looked rather like Uncle Bob, his skin was so bountifully
  sunburnt.</p>

  <p>A stool was provided next to Anatole, where Bill very self-consciously sat
  himself. Prince Zosimo had raised his eyebrows at his appearance and shaken
  his head, but he did not look cross.</p>

  <p>For what seemed hours Bill sat on that stool, till his legs cramped. The
  men talked in their own tongue and he could not understand one word. It was a
  funny discussion, for everyone seemed to speak at once, and they shrugged
  their shoulders and spread out their hands and sometimes rose to their feet
  in their excitement. Now and then Prince Zosimo would call for silence and
  say a few words very slowly and solemnly. Anatole did not speak at all.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the conversation passed into French, and everybody spoke in low
  tones, with sidelong glances at the door. Bill did not understand much of
  that either, but now and then he picked up a word. They all seemed to be
  talking about "<i>bouleversements</i>" and "<i>degringolades</i>" and
  "<i>émeutes</i>" and the phrase "<i>coup d'état</i>" often cropped up.</p>

  <p>Then they began to steal away, one by one. They looked at the windows,
  outside which the snow was falling thick, and the weather seemed to give them
  comfort. Bill guessed they were anxious that their presence there should not
  be known, and that they counted on the snowfall to protect them. Prince
  Zosimo went out with the last man, and as he passed Bill he smiled and patted
  him on the shoulder. The two boys were left alone.</p>

  <p>Anatole tumbled off the big chair and seized Bill's hand. He was rather
  pale, but his eyes were glowing.</p>

  <p>"I thought you had failed me," he said. "Why were you so late? What
  happened?"</p>

  <p>Bill explained the cause of his detention at Farover. "I'm most awfully
  sorry I was late. Prince Zosimo isn't suspicious?"</p>

  <p>"He is very suspicious, but I have told him that I cannot answer questions
  yet awhile. This morning I had to tell many lies. I said that you were weary
  and must not be disturbed, and I would let no one into the room. I waited
  until ten o'clock before I obeyed my cousin's summons&mdash;he was almost
  angry, I think&mdash;and I have not yet had breakfast. Presently there will
  be <i>déjeuner</i>. I have told him that your health is delicate and that you
  are still weary. But I beg of you, dear Beel, to tell me of yourself and how
  you came here."</p>

  <p>So Bill told him the whole story of the magic staff. Anatole accepted it
  simply. "It is a gift of God," he said, "sent to make you the saviour of
  Gracia. But it would be well that Prince Zosimo should not know it, for old
  men are unbelieving."</p>

  <p>"It's your turn to tell me what these men were talking about."</p>

  <p>Anatole laughed. "It appears that I am dead. The papers are full of it. I
  fell last night from a high window at Mamizan. The press of our own party has
  black borders to-day. My body, when it is found, will be brought to Grachovo
  and buried in the royal chapel in the Cathedral. I do not know what they will
  put in the coffin. A dog perhaps. Kuno always desired for me the death of a
  dog."</p>

  <p>"Will people believe that yarn?"</p>

  <p>"Some will, but not, I think, many. My death is too convenient for friend
  Kuno's plans. My people will busy themselves in sowing the seeds of
  suspicion. They will spread ugly stories, and in Parliament Kuno will be
  asked many questions. Presently most people will believe him a murderer....
  But there is more than that. It seems that I was to be kidnapped and hidden
  in the mountains, and that this very week there was to be a rising in
  Grachovo, when he would proclaim the republic and force my grandfather to
  abdicate. My death makes that impossible just yet, and gives us time. He
  would have hushed up the whole thing, but Mother Linda was beside herself
  with grief and talked to the peasants, and already the tale runs like
  wildfire. So we are given a little time to prepare our plans. At the Festival
  of St. Lampadas I will return to life.... And then&mdash;we shall see."</p>

  <p>The boy spread out his thin hands, just like Prince Zosimo.</p>

  <p>Bill was thinking hard. He was beginning to realise the amazing power
  which the staff gave him if he handled it properly. This boy trusted him, and
  Bill knew that he must rise to the occasion. He felt himself very old and
  very powerful, so powerful that he was almost frightened.</p>

  <p>At luncheon Prince Zosimo talked to him in beautiful English, and he did
  his best to conduct himself well. It was rather like school, when you went to
  breakfast with the Head Beak. He was aware that the Prince was burning to ask
  him questions, but that Anatole had forbidden it. One piece of news
  interested him deeply.</p>

  <p>"I learn," said the Prince, "that Kuno goes to Mamizan this afternoon in
  spite of the weather. He intends, no doubt, to inform himself about the
  situation there and to cover his tracks."</p>

  <p>"Can't you have him kidnapped?" Bill asked innocently.</p>

  <p>Again the Prince spread out his hands. "Would that we could! But we can
  command no force which could match his guards. Were he but removed from
  Grachovo for the next week, our plans would march fast."</p>

  <p>The two boys were alone for a moment after the meal.</p>

  <p>"I'm off," said Bill. "I'm going to Mamizan to see what Kuno is up to. I
  can't come back to you to-day, for I have to have tea with my grandmother.
  I'll be back to-morrow morning, and I'll try to get here by ten. You must say
  I have gone to bed, and you must keep the key of the door in your pocket.
  Tell the Prince you insist. Dash it all, Anatole, if you're going to be king
  some day, you have a right to your own way."</p>

  <p>Bill had asked to be taken to the alcove on the grand staircase. This time
  it was as dark as a tomb, for there were no lights in the hall, and when he
  peeped out he saw only a great dimness, since the heavy snow was blanketing
  the windows.</p>

  <p>Bill had a long time to wait, and it was very cold. He thought pleasantly
  of the warm fires at Farover, where he was due in an hour or two. He could
  not afford to be late, for his grandmother would be alarmed, and he must
  excite no suspicion in that household. Every now and then he popped out from
  the alcove to get light by which to consult his watch. It was twenty minutes
  past three before there was a stir below, and a ringing of the great bell and
  the sound of loud voices.</p>

  <p>Bill had made up his mind as to his course, but he started out on it with
  a quaking heart. He stole to the staircase head and looked down on a posse of
  soldiers, in the midst of whom was a tall man in civilian clothes and a big
  ulster with a fur collar. He had taken off his fur cap, and revealed a long
  lean head and a face as sharp as a hawk's. He was giving orders, and Bill
  waited until he saw him begin to ascend the staircase. Another civilian
  accompanied him&mdash;his secretary, perhaps&mdash;a fellow in a frock
  coat.</p>

  <p>Bill went slowly down to meet them, keeping his eyes fixed on Kuno and his
  stick firm in his right hand. At the sight of him the ascending party halted,
  and the secretary cried out something. Kuno was staring with eyes which even
  in the gloom seemed very bright and terrible.</p>

  <p>Bill was now only two steps above him. "<i>Mon Général</i>," he said and
  saluted.</p>

  <p>The grim figure looked mystified and then suddenly wrathful. He seemed
  about to lay hands on Bill, but Bill anticipated him. He made himself slip,
  and in falling clutched with his left hand at the belt of Kuno's ulster. Then
  he twirled the stick and spoke a word.</p>

  <p>That word was St. Kilda.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; THE KIDNAPPING OF THE KIDNAPPER</h2>

  <p class="first">A WIND like a knife cut Bill's cheek, and the next second a
  whiff of salt spray blew in his face. He was among the shingle of a beach,
  close to a rough stone jetty, and the Prime Minister of Gracia was grunting
  beside him like a seal on a skerry.</p>

  <p>Bill had read a lot about St. Kilda in the papers&mdash;how it had been
  deserted by its inhabitants and was rarely visited by ships, least of all in
  the winter time. He also remembered from his excursions in Scottish history
  that it had been used as a place of exile for undesirable people. He had
  decided on going there during his meditations in the alcove, but he was a
  little staggered by the reality now that he had reached it.</p>

  <p>For in the fading light of the January afternoon it was the wildest and
  savagest spot that Bill had ever dreamed of. A grey sky hung lowering over a
  grey shore and a tumultuous sea. Behind him rose a steep hill, with at its
  foot what seemed to be a huddle of old stone cottages, but no kindly smoke
  rose from their chimneys. On both sides cliffs hemmed in the bay, and a sheer
  conical rock stuck out of the yeasty waters. Sea birds hung in a cloud over
  the forsaken jetty, and their eldritch cries mingled with the howling of the
  wind. It was very cold, for a south-easter blew straight into the little
  harbour, and the breakers thundered on the beach like falling mountains.</p>

  <p>There was no time to be lost. He had got the most dangerous man in the
  Balkans as his sole companion on an island fifty miles from anywhere. Kuno
  was still grunting and rubbing spindrift from his eyes. He rose to his feet
  blindly like a sleep-walker, and balanced himself unsteadily against the
  gale.</p>

  <p>Bill stealthily withdrew a few paces behind him. He had better get out of
  it, he thought, before his victim realised his presence. The sea-gulls were
  the only safe company for General Kuno, who a minute ago had been the
  autocrat of a considerable state.</p>

  <p>After the Hebridean tempest the library at Farover looked very cosy. Bill
  had not been a minute there before Backus came in to see to the fire. He was
  in a good-humour, for he asked Bill about his day's walk.</p>

  <p>"You're taking tea with her ladyship, Master Bill," he said. "You'd better
  tidy yourself up. I'll be sending up tea in half an hour.... Hadn't you
  better leave that stick of yours in the hall? Her ladyship don't like the
  rooms cluttered up with outdoor things."</p>

  <p>When Backus had gone, Bill sat himself down before the wood fire to warm
  his chilly hands and collect his wits. Life had been very exciting in the
  past few hours....</p>

  <p>Suddenly he was visited by a great compunction.</p>

  <p>Kuno was beyond doubt a villain, but St. Kilda was a pretty severe
  prison-house for the worst of malefactors. And then he remembered that he had
  left the wretched Kuno no means of subsistence. His fur-lined ulster was his
  only protection against the winter blasts. He had no chance of making a fire;
  he had no hope of food unless he ate shell-fish or was lucky enough to knock
  a gull on the head, and that would be pretty beastly fare. With a horrid
  start Bill realised that he had condemned the man to death. In a week the big
  black-backed gulls would be picking his bones on the shore.</p>

  <p>He had been feeling rather pleased with himself, but now he understood
  that he had made an awful blunder. What was to be done? Nothing, except to go
  back to St. Kilda and move Kuno to some more habitable spot. The prospect set
  his heart beating. He was afraid of the man with the bright eyes and the hawk
  face. To move him he must lay hold of him somehow, but Kuno was just as
  likely to lay hold of him and strangle him before he could twirl the
  staff.</p>

  <p>Bill went through a bad five minutes before his mind was made up, and it
  says a good deal for him that he did make it up in the end. His pride helped
  him. He felt that he was having a hand in great affairs and that he must on
  no account show the white feather.</p>

  <p>The weather of St. Kilda had grown worse and Bill arrived in a stiff
  blizzard of sleet. That was all to the good, for it concealed him from the
  man, who was standing with one foot in a bog and one on a boulder,
  alternately calling down maledictions upon fortune and beating his breast
  with his mighty hands.</p>

  <p>Bill had no notion what to do next. He was on higher ground, about two
  yards from Kuno, and his first idea was to steal behind him and grip his leg
  or his ulster-band before he could resist.</p>

  <p>But suddenly Kuno turned round and caught sight of him.</p>

  <p>There must have been something in his eyes, some quaver of fear, which
  gave Bill a plan. For he leapt on the top of a big stone, waved his stick,
  and uttered that eerie wailing which he had practised the day before at
  Mamizan. The big man seemed to shrink and cower.</p>

  <p>Then Bill shouted against the wind in that French of his which was a
  disgrace to the public-school system. "Regard me!" he cried. "I am the Prince
  Anatole of Gracia.... I am the phantom of him you have murdered.... You will
  remain here&mdash;here&mdash;for ever...."</p>

  <p>Bill's foot slipped and he fell off the stone; but fall also did Kuno. The
  big man dropped on his knees and bowed his head to the ground as if he feared
  a blow. His massive shoulders were shaking with some profound emotion.</p>

  <p>Bill had no difficulty in getting hold of the band of his ulster. He
  wished himself in the fir wood on Glenmore, far up the slopes of Stob
  Ghabhar....</p>

  <p>Next moment he was in a different kind of weather. The icy winds had gone
  and a soft drizzling Scots mist shrouded the familiar glen. Kuno was
  sprawling on a patch of wet moss, and Bill slipped behind a fir tree.</p>

  <p>But with the change of scene the terrors of the Prime Minister seemed to
  have gone. He saw Bill, decided that he had to deal with flesh and blood, and
  having always been a man of action he was resolved to grapple with it. Before
  Bill understood what was happening Kuno, with marvellous agility, had sprung
  to his feet and had almost clutched his collar.</p>

  <p>Bill ran for his life. In and out of the fir boles and the dead roots,
  among russet bracken and over patches of blaeberries the chase proceeded. Now
  a man of six foot three in the prime of life is faster than a small boy, and
  Bill realised with horror that he could not put enough distance between
  himself and his pursuer to be able to use his staff.</p>

  <p>His one hope was his knowledge of the ground. Someone had once told him
  that if you were pursued by a bear you should run transversely along a
  hillside, for bears' feet were uncertain on a slope; but that if a bull was
  after you you should run downhill, since bulls had a precarious balance. He
  thought that Kuno was liker a bull than a bear, so he catapulted himself down
  towards the ravine of the burn. Nevertheless he was nearly caught. The
  pursuit was not a yard behind him when he reached the lip of the gorge. But
  the gorge saved him.</p>

  <p>He reached it at a spot where Peter and he, the summer before, had
  prospected an ingenious road to the water's edge. It was a road which a boy
  could take, but not a heavy man. Bill slithered through a patch of dead
  foxgloves, caught at the root of a birch, and swung himself on to a ledge of
  rock. Then he slipped down the channel of a tributary rivulet, and landed on
  a boulder from which he could traverse under an out-jutting crag. The misty
  weather helped him, and when he reached the edge of the big pool where Peter
  had caught his first trout he could hear his adversary cursing far above him
  on the edge of the ravine.</p>

  <p>"That was a close shave," thought Bill. "He'll be right enough there. He
  can stay out all night&mdash;serve him jolly well right, too! And in the
  morning he will see Jock Rorison's cottage."</p>

  <p>About twenty minutes later Bill, having changed his clothes, washed his
  face and hands, and brushed his unruly hair, sat quietly eating muffins in
  his grandmother's sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"What a lovely colour you have got, Bill dear," she said. "You have been
  out walking since breakfast, I hear. Did you get far?"</p>

  <p>"A good bit," said Bill abstractedly. "Yes, I've covered a pretty fair
  amount of country to-day."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; THE ADVENTURE OF GRACHOVO</h2>

  <p class="first">THAT evening Bill developed a heavy cold. He thought it was
  due to the heat of his grandmother's sitting-room after the St. Kilda
  blizzards. But Backus put it down to his coming back in damp clothes. "I
  can't think what you was up to, getting so wet, Master Bill," he grumbled.
  "You comes home nice and dry, and goes out again and gets as wet as a
  spaniel-dog, and there hasn't been a drop of rain here this blessed day."</p>

  <p>Bill snuffled and sneezed at dinner, which he ate in his grandmother's
  company, and thereafter he was packed off to bed. Grimes, his grandmother's
  formidable maid, proceeded to doctor him. He was given two extra blankets,
  had his head wrapped up in a shawl, and was made to drink a beaker of
  ammoniated quinine. He heard ominous mutterings about a temperature. The
  result was a troubled night's rest, from which he woke with the snuffles gone
  but rather limp and miserable. It was his grandmother's orders, conveyed
  through Grimes, that he should stay that day in bed.</p>

  <p>Bill started the day in hope. They were bound to leave him a good deal
  alone; he had his stick beside him under the blankets; and between breakfast
  and luncheon, or between luncheon and tea, when he was assumed to be asleep,
  he might slip off to Grachovo. But he was never left alone. Even when he was
  bidden go to sleep after luncheon, Grimes, who had a mania for doctoring,
  would tiptoe in every ten minutes to have a look at him.</p>

  <p>He had a miserable day. He felt perfectly well, but as restless as a hound
  tied up in a kennel within hearing of the hunting-horn. In the morning he
  tried to read old volumes of Punch, but in the afternoon, when he was tucked
  up to sleep, his mind revolved in an unhappy wheel. He felt himself the
  arbiter of the destinies of Gracia, and yet powerless. What was happening in
  Grachovo now that Kuno was out of action? How would Anatole contrive to
  explain his absence? He had left Anatole in the lurch&mdash;a thought which
  made him hurl the blankets from him. He liked that little chap better than
  any boy he had ever met, and he was now separated from him at the crisis of
  his fortunes.</p>

  <p>He slept a bit after tea, and Grimes was so pleased with his recovery
  that, when she brought in his dinner of soup and minced chicken, she
  announced that he would be allowed to get up next day.</p>

  <p>At half-past eight she put out the lights and left him for the night. Ten
  minutes later Bill arose and donned all the clothes he could find, including
  his winter dressing-gown, for his overcoat was downstairs in the cloak-room.
  Then, having made sure that the house was quiet and that no one was likely to
  visit him till the morning, he twirled the staff and desired to be taken to
  the bedroom in Prince Zosimo's palace.</p>

  <p>The room was dark except for the lamp beside the beds, but the windows
  were lit brightly by a glare from without. One was open, and through it came
  the sound of a terrific clamour from the street below. Snow was no longer
  falling, but it lay on the roof-tops and reflected eerily the illumination
  which flickered and trembled on the winter sky. At the window, with his neck
  craned, stood Anatole. He almost fell out when Bill clapped him on the
  back.</p>

  <p>"Beel, dear Beel! Where have you been?" he cried. "I have been all day
  sick with longing for you."</p>

  <p>"I was ill and they kept me in bed. I say, what's the news?"</p>

  <p>"The news!" cried the boy. "But of the most glorious! Yesterday Kuno
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Bill. "I pinched him. Just at present he's having a
  roughish time in the Highlands."</p>

  <p>Anatole called upon all the saints.</p>

  <p>"It was the manner of his going," he said. "He disappeared in a flash at
  the summons of my phantom. His attendants were mad with fright, and all of
  Mamizan fell on its knees. The tale spread, and presently it reached this
  city. Meantime the people were angry about my murder. The troops whom Kuno's
  lieutenants called out mutinied and joined the loyal party.... This morning
  the regiments in the main barracks followed. Kuno's ministry resigned, and
  all day the courts of my grandfather's Palace have been filled with crowds
  crying evil on Kuno and good fortune to the house of Paleologue. The tale is
  that the Devil came for Kuno and carried him off, and the Grachs, who are a
  religious people, are afraid.... Prince Zosimo has become dictator by
  universal demand. He will be Prime Minister in Kuno's place until the
  elections can be held, and of their result there is no doubt. Gracia has
  become loyal once more, and once more I am its Crown Prince with the people's
  love to support me. And Beel, my darling Beel, to you I owe it all."</p>

  <p>A deeply embarrassed Bill found himself embraced and kissed on both
  cheeks. He realised that Anatole was wearing beautiful clothes.</p>

  <p>"What about Prince Zosimo?" he asked. "Has he been asking questions about
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Happily, no. My kinsman has had other things to think about. But soon he
  must be told all, and it will be a solemn secret in our family. This is not
  the first time that the good God has come to the succour of the
  Paleologues.... Listen. Prince Zosimo has decided that this night the people
  must be informed that I am alive and safe. Otherwise they will certainly seek
  out and crucify every Kunoite in the land. Presently it will be announced
  from the steps of the Parliament House. Then there will be a rush of people
  hither, and I must go out on the balcony to greet them. You, my friend and
  saviour, will stand beside me.... Hush! it begins."</p>

  <p>Suddenly it seemed as if the whole air were filled with bells. Every kind
  of bell from the shrill treble of little churches to the deep bass of the
  great bell of the Cathedral. And as an accompaniment to this tremendous
  carillon there was a wilder sound&mdash;the babble of thousands of human
  voices, which rose now and then to a shout that drowned all else and seemed
  to shake the heavens.</p>

  <p>Anatole was hopping about the room in his excitement.</p>

  <p>"They come! they come!" he cried. "Prince Zosimo will warn us when they
  are here.... At the holy festival of St. Lampadas I will stand at my
  grandfather's side, and Beel, dear Beel, you will stand beside me. I will
  have you made a Prince of Gracia. I will have you given the Golden Star of
  St. Lampadas, which is the highest honour in the land. My grandfather is old,
  and maybe I shall soon sit in his place, with Prince Zosimo as my regent.
  Then you will be my chief counsellor and the support of my house. You will
  not forsake me...."</p>

  <p>The boy broke off, for from the street below came a clamour like the
  falling of great waves. At the same moment Prince Zosimo entered the room. He
  was white with excitement and very grave, and he wore a resplendent uniform.
  He smiled on Bill and took his hand. "I am glad to see you are recovered. I
  fear my duties to-day have not permitted me to enquire about your health."
  Then to Anatole, "Come, my Prince. The moment has arrived to present you to
  your people."</p>

  <p>Bill's head, what between the dregs of the cold and the excitement of the
  occasion, was humming like a top. He hardly heard Anatole whisper as he
  descended the stairs, "To-night I take up my quarters in the royal Palace.
  When you come again you will find me in the Crown Prince's apartments."</p>

  <p>In a daze he entered a huge chamber where many men in uniform were
  congregated and the windows of which were bright as day from the glow
  without. He stumbled on to the balcony holding Anatole's hand.</p>

  <p>Then came a supreme moment of Bill's life. The three stood behind a low
  stone parapet&mdash;Prince Zosimo superb in uniform, Anatole in a suit of
  dark velvet, and he himself in a shabby old dressing-gown with a scarf of his
  house colours round his neck. He looked down upon an ocean of faces, white in
  the glow of arc lights, and a myriad waving hands and banners. Soldiers lined
  the street, and, dense as the throng was, there was no disorder. Every soul
  there seemed to have a grave purpose.</p>

  <p>Anatole stepped forward and held out his hands with a childlike pleading
  gesture. He, too, was very white, but he was smiling. There was a quiver of a
  new brightness, as every soldier drew his sword and raised it to the salute.
  And from the crowd came a cry of welcome which was so passionate and fierce
  that it seemed to beat like a mighty wind on their faces. Bill remembered a
  line of a poem which he had had to learn for repetition&mdash;</p>
  <br>
  <p class="verse">
  "Sounds, as if some great city were one voice<br>
  Around a king returning from the wars."</p>
  <br>

  <p>It was more than he could endure. Another second and he would be howling
  like a dog and making a spectacle of himself before foreigners. He took a
  step backward into the shadow, twirled the staff and wished himself in
  bed.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; THE RESTORATION OF PRINCE ANATOLE</h2>

  <p class="first">BILL had a fresh dose of cold next morning, which was
  perhaps not to be wondered at. Grimes was severe with him and kept him tight
  in bed, threatening to send for the doctor if he were not better in the
  evening.</p>

  <p>For once Bill was content to lie still. The events of the night before had
  been so overwhelming that he wanted to think them over. Besides, he must get
  rid of his cold, for in three days fell the festival of St. Lampadas, which
  was to be the great occasion of his life.</p>

  <p>So he lay very peaceful all day in bed, and did not even attempt to read
  the picture papers which Backus brought him. He lived again in memory through
  every detail of his adventures in Gracia. The pale little boy he had found on
  the roof of Mamizan had been very different from the composed young prince
  who had bowed to the people from Prince Zosimo's balcony. And it had all been
  his doing. He, Bill, had become a king-maker. I am afraid that he almost
  forgot about the staff, and was inclined to think too much of his own
  cleverness.</p>

  <p>The thought of Kuno wandering about Glenmore made him chuckle, so that
  Backus, entering the room with some hot milk, thought he had choked and beat
  him on the back. Whatever happened, Kuno was out of action. Even if he had
  time to get back to Gracia before the day of St. Lampadas, it would only be
  to find himself in imminent danger of lynching. For Kuno Bill cherished a
  hearty dislike, and he hoped that he would somehow come to fisticuffs with
  Angus, the river gillie, who was a good man of his hands.</p>

  <p>In the evening he was so well that he wanted to get up for dinner, but
  this was sternly vetoed. It appeared that Grimes had telephoned to his mother
  and had strict orders to keep him in bed. There was other news from home. It
  was proposed that he should join Barbara and Peter in their visit to Aunt
  Alice in London before going back to school. That would mean leaving Farover
  next day, and his mother suggested fetching him in the car.</p>

  <p>The future suddenly became rather complicated, but there was one comfort.
  Aunt Alice had always allowed him to go off on his own errands, since she
  believed in letting boys find their feet. Alone he had in the past sniffed
  around bird-fanciers' shops in Soho, and spent hours in the Natural History
  Museum. He would find a chance of attending the ceremony of St. Lampadas. But
  first he must see Anatole and get to know the plans for it.</p>

  <p>Next morning even Grimes pronounced him wholly recovered. She brought the
  news that his mother would arrive at eleven o'clock and carry him home for
  luncheon. That meant that his visit to Grachovo must be postponed until the
  afternoon or evening; but there should be no difficulty about it, for home in
  the absence of Peter and Barbara would offer many opportunities of
  retirement. So he spent an hour in his grandmother's room and conducted
  himself so admirably that he was presented with two pounds, just double his
  ordinary tip from that quarter.</p>

  <p>His mother, when she arrived, made a searching inquisition into his state
  of health. She observed that he looked thin and a little tired, and was
  inclined to regret the London plan. But Bill was reassuring. He had never
  felt so well, he said, and he wanted to see Peter and Barbara and Aunt Alice,
  and there were many things he would like to do in town. His grandmother
  reported highly on his behaviour, and Bill left Farover with an aureole of
  virtue about his small head.</p>

  <p>In the car, on the way back, his mother told him about Uncle Bob's visit.
  She repeated the story of his miraculous rescue by the French soldiers, about
  which Bill tried to show an excitement which he could scarcely feel.</p>

  <p>"He was very sorry to miss you, Bill dear," she said. "He is tremendously
  interested in you and asked all kinds of questions. He seemed to be rather
  anxious about you&mdash;I don't know why. He wanted to know if you were quite
  all right&mdash;he asked that again and again until I grew rather
  worried."</p>

  <p>Then she told him the family news. Peter had got his long-promised camera,
  and Barbara had been to a ball and three plays.</p>

  <p>"One afternoon I am going to take Peter and you to a conjuring show at the
  Albemarle Hall. Won't that be fun? You always love conjurors."</p>

  <p>At luncheon his father had more exciting news.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what has come over Glenmore these days," he said. "First
  there was Mrs. Macrae's delusion before Christmas about the boys. She hasn't
  got over that yet. She keeps sending me postcards wanting to be reassured
  about them.... And now an extraordinary thing has happened. Three days ago
  Hector found a queer-looking fellow wandering about the foot of Stob Ghabhar
  when he went out in the morning to shoot hinds. He was a big chap, very well
  dressed, a foreigner who could not speak a word of English, and he was in a
  furious temper. Hector said that if he had not had his rifle he believed he
  would have attacked him. Apparently he had been out all night, and he badly
  wanted food, so Hector took him to breakfast at Angus's cottage. He says he
  ate like a wolf and then made a long speech in an unknown language, and when
  no one understood him grew so violent that the two men had to lock him up and
  send for the police from Abercailly. He was taken off to the Abercailly gaol,
  and now this morning I have a wire from Stormont, the Chief Constable. It
  seems that the fellow talks French and says he is a great swell in some
  foreign country&mdash;a general or something&mdash;but he doesn't appear to
  have any notion how he got to Glenmore. I told Stormont to consult Lanerick,
  who was in the Diplomatic Service and might be able to find out the truth
  about the man.... Fancy a foreign grandee wandering about Stob Ghabhar in
  mid-winter!"</p>

  <p>It was easy enough for Bill to slip off in the afternoon to a corner of
  the park and to transport himself to Gracia. He asked to be taken to the
  Crown Prince's apartments in the royal Palace, and found himself in a
  magnificence of which he had never dreamed&mdash;resembling, he thought, a
  wonderful restaurant in London where he had once had a meal. By a lucky
  chance Anatole was there, and the boys curled up on a great sofa and had an
  hour of excited talk.</p>

  <p>Prince Zosimo was too busy, it appeared, to ask questions about the
  English stranger, and now he, Anatole, was Crown Prince of Gracia and
  responsible to no one. Things were moving miraculously. The Kuno faction had
  melted like snow in thaw, and the true desires of the Grach nation were now
  apparent. Such loyal jubilations Grachovo had never witnessed, and the
  country was, if possible, more enthusiastic than the capital. A telegram had
  come from Kuno from Scotland, "I live. I return." But people had only
  laughed, for there were no Kunoites left except a few hidden in holes and
  corners.</p>

  <p>And then he expounded what would happen on St. Lampadas' Day. The King,
  his grandfather, now better in health, would drive in the royal coach to the
  Cathedral, Anatole by his side, and there would replenish with oil the sacred
  lamp which never went out, and offer gifts on the altar. Then he would return
  in state to the Palace, where, in the great Hall of Audience he would receive
  the leaders of the nation and speak through them to all Gracia.</p>

  <p>The Prince almost danced with excitement.</p>

  <p>"At every step I will be by his side. He will present me to the nobles and
  they will swear fealty with uplifted swords. I shall wear the ancient dress
  of Gracia, which is worn only on high occasions of state, and likewise the
  collar of St. Lampadas. Six of the greatest nobles will attend me, but you,
  Beel, will be by my right hand, as my principal equerry, and you shall wear
  on your breast the Gold Star of St. Lampadas, which is given only to those of
  the highest rank, or to those who have done some great service to
  Gracia."</p>

  <p>"I haven't much in the way of kit," said Bill. He reflected that his best
  suit would look rather shabby amid such magnificence.</p>

  <p>The Prince seized his hand. "Have no fear. You are of my size, and fitting
  clothes have been ordered for you. They will be of white satin, with a mantle
  of purple velvet and a belt of mountain turquoises, for that is the historic
  garb of the Crown Prince's suite on gala days. You shall wear, too, the
  curved sword of a Gracian noble."</p>

  <p>Then he gave Bill explicit instructions. He was to be in his suite in the
  Palace at eleven o'clock, since at noon the procession started for the
  Cathedral. Orders would be issued with respect to him, and he would be
  gazetted to the Prince's staff. Thereafter&mdash;Anatole expanded in happy
  dreams&mdash;his dearest friend and deliverer must not leave him. Between
  them, with the help of the magic staff, they would make Gracia the most
  prosperous and the most peaceful and the happiest of lands.</p>

  <p>He leaped up and kissed him, and somehow this time Bill did not feel
  ashamed.</p>

  <p>That night at dinner his father talked of Bill's future. In these hard
  times everyone must earn his living, and various careers were passed in
  review&mdash;the Army, the Colonial service, Uncle Bob's family business.
  Bill listened with apparent attention, but his mind was far away.</p>

  <p>He was long in getting to sleep. His father had talked about professions,
  and had said that you must begin humbly and work your way up. But if he
  wanted he could be a prince of Gracia, the chief friend of the heir to the
  throne, and in a year or two, perhaps, the chief friend of the King. The day
  after to-morrow he would be wearing wonderful clothes and moving among
  exultant crowds, while soldiers saluted and bands played and cannons boomed.
  Bill saw the prospect as a mixture of all the high occasions he had ever
  witnessed&mdash;the King's opening of Parliament, the scene at Lords after an
  unexpected school victory, service in the College Chapel, Speech Day, the
  Scots Guards pipers, the changing of the guard at St. James's.... He hugged
  himself in his excitement and finally fell asleep with the magic staff firmly
  clutched in his hand.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; THE CROWNING ADVENTURE&mdash;I</h2>

  <p class="first">NEXT morning before going to London Bill looked at the
  newspapers. He had not done this before, for he had forgotten that what so
  enthralled him might also interest the world. The papers were full of the
  doings in Grachovo. There were two or three columns on the foreign page of
  <i>The Times</i>, and <i>The Daily Mail</i> had many photographs, including
  one of Prince Anatole, and a caricature of Kuno.</p>

  <p>He could find no word of Kuno's doings. The man was apparently too proud
  to reveal himself to the police of a foreign country, though he had
  telegraphed to Grachovo. By this time he must know that his immediate game
  was up, but he was not the kind of man to despair. He would return to Gracia,
  and Bill and Anatole and Prince Zosimo would have to keep a sharp eye on his
  future doings.</p>

  <p>On the way to London, as the car passed through the little towns, he saw
  on all the newspaper placards: "<i>Scenes in
  Grachovo</i>"&mdash;"<i>Restoration of the Crown Prince</i>"&mdash;"<i>Defeat
  of Republican Plot</i>." What would the papers say about the ceremony of
  to-morrow? Bill hugged his staff and had a sudden delicious sense of secret
  power.</p>

  <p>During the journey he was in a happy dream. At luncheon he woke up and was
  so urbane that Aunt Alice seemed prepared to revise her views about the
  public school system. Peter babbled happily about his camera and his doings
  in town. Barbara was not present at the meal, for she was lunching with a
  friend.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon Bill went off by himself, for he had much to do. He
  wanted to make Anatole a present, for to-morrow's occasion demanded a gift,
  and he had decided what it should be. His father possessed a sporting rifle,
  a .320 which had long seemed to Bill a most desirable possession. If he could
  provide Anatole with such a weapon his happiness would be complete.</p>

  <p>The trouble was that he only possessed in cash £3 10<i>s.</i>, and he knew
  that a rifle cost far more than that. Casting about for ways and means, he
  remembered the five gold coins he had found in the Ivory Valley. They must be
  valuable, and by their sale he might amass the necessary sum.</p>

  <p>So he made for Pratt's in Piccadilly, into whose medal-filled windows he
  had often stared. He had heard his father say that Pratt's were good people
  to deal with.</p>

  <p>The assistant was courteous and friendly. He looked at the coins, and then
  summoned a colleague, and the two proceeded to rub and clean them, and to
  peer at them through magnifying glasses. He asked Bill where he got them, and
  was told truthfully that they had been found in Africa.</p>

  <p>"You have permission to sell them?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>Bill replied with conviction that they were his very own.</p>

  <p>They were a long while considering them. They asked for time to consult
  certain experts, and proposed that Bill should return two days hence.</p>

  <p>"But I want to sell them now," said Bill. "You see, I want to give a
  birthday present to a great friend, and he ought to have it to-morrow."</p>

  <p>His eagerness was so great and his candour so engaging that a very
  serious-looking old gentleman in spectacles, who had been brought into the
  conclave, was impressed.</p>

  <p>"We could make you a price now," he said. "But I ought to warn you that it
  may not be a fair price. When we have satisfied ourselves on certain points
  we might be able to offer considerably more. What do you say to that?"</p>

  <p>"I want to sell them now," said Bill. "How much can you give me?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we can't go beyond twenty-five pounds."</p>

  <p>"All right! I will take that." The sum seemed to Bill an incredible
  fortune.</p>

  <p>He had to give his name and address and sign a receipt, the terms of which
  were carefully explained to him. Then with a wad of notes in his pocket he
  sought a famous gunshop in Bond Street. He had once been there with his
  father and considered it the most delectable place in the world.</p>

  <p>The price of the rifle proved to be thirty guineas, just a little beyond
  his means. Bill was in such despair that the manager was moved. He asked him
  his name and recognised him as the son of an old customer.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what we can do," he said. "I have a rifle here which has
  been returned because the gentleman died suddenly. It is quite new and has
  never been used, I believe, but you may say it ranks as second-hand. I can
  let you have it for twenty-five pounds."</p>

  <p>So Bill became the possessor of the .320, and had still a little money
  left. He arranged that he would call for it next morning at ten.</p>

  <p>Bill was restless all evening, and went early to bed, for his mother and
  Barbara were dining out. He lay awake for a long time, dreaming of the events
  of the morrow and thinking a good deal about the rifle. Anatole would love
  it. Anatole was doing a lot for him, but then he had done a lot for Anatole.
  There were moments when he felt so proud that he could scarcely lie in
  bed.</p>

  <p>The result was that he was late for breakfast, and had to dress in a great
  hurry. Usually he hated wearing his best clothes, which he was compelled to
  do in London. But now he only wished that they were better. Never mind! In an
  hour or two they would be exchanged for silks and satins.</p>

  <p>He had already got his mother's permission to go out for the day,
  permission the more readily given since Peter was to spend the morning with
  the dentist. Bill had always had the habit of "prowls"&mdash;a family
  word&mdash;and Aunt Alice had supported him in his plea. "Don't coddle
  children," she had said. "The sooner they learn to stand on their own feet
  the better."</p>

  <p>So, with many instructions from his mother to eat a digestible luncheon
  and to be careful in crossing the streets, Bill set out from Portland Place
  clutching his stick.</p>

  <p>He took a bus to Bond Street and collected the rifle. Then he indulged in
  a taxi as far as the Marble Arch. He proposed to find a quiet place in Hyde
  Park from which to make his departure.</p>

  <p>It was a clear frosty morning, and the park was very empty. Bill found a
  spot where nobody was in sight except two small girls and a dog. When they
  had disappeared round the corner of a copse, he twirled the staff and wished
  himself in the Crown Prince's apartments in the Palace of Grachovo.</p>

  <p>Anatole was not there, as he had promised. There was no one in the room,
  and it looked curiously untidy, as if the furniture had been violently moved
  about. Bill was considering his next step when someone entered, and he saw
  that it was the young footman who was Anatole's valet.</p>

  <p>At the sight of Bill the man cried out something and turned and fled.</p>

  <p>Bill heard excited voices outside in the corridor. Then the door was flung
  open and Prince Zosimo entered at a run. He was a very dishevelled Zosimo.
  His short grey hair had not been brushed, and he had certainly not shaved. He
  was dressed in deep black, but his clothes were wrinkled as if he had slept
  in them. He came down on Bill like a whirlwind.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been?" he cried, and his English was so disordered that
  Bill could scarcely follow him. "Where have you come from? Where is the
  King?"</p>

  <p>"The King?" Bill stammered.</p>

  <p>"The King! Anatole is now king. His grandfather died yesterday evening.
  Where is the King of Gracia?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"But you must know," Zosimo almost screamed. "When did you see him
  last?"</p>

  <p>"The day before yesterday," said Bill, trying to collect his wits. "What
  has happened? Oh, tell me!"</p>

  <p>"Happened! He is lost. He has disappeared in the night. The Palace guard
  was relaxed owing to his late Majesty's death. His bedroom was all in
  confusion. There had been a struggle. There is treason abroad. He has been
  carried off by the enemy."</p>

  <p>"Kuno!" Bill cried.</p>

  <p>"Kuno, doubtless. He must have returned, and he must have had his agents
  inside the Palace. The police are even now investigating. But he! But the
  King! At noon he should proceed to the Cathedral and thereafter receive his
  nobles in the Hall of Audience. The sacred lamp must be replenished, and if
  it fails our cause is undone. And you! You! What about you? You must explain
  yourself, child, for you are a mystery."</p>

  <p>All Bill's happy forecasts were shattered. He felt himself destined now to
  something very different from the glittering pageant he had dreamed of. But
  it was anxiety for Anatole that consumed him.</p>

  <p>"Please don't ask about me. I've no time to tell you. Anatole knows
  everything. We must find him."</p>

  <p>"Find him! With all Gracia to search! He may have been taken across the
  border. The Cathedral ceremony has been postponed until three o'clock, but it
  must be held this day, and if the King is not found by three o'clock the
  monarchy falls."</p>

  <p>Zosimo's excitement had the effect of calming Bill. "He will be found," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Do you know where he is hidden?" he was asked furiously.</p>

  <p>"I can find him," said Bill quietly. "Please listen to me, Prince Zosimo,
  and do not ask questions now."</p>

  <p>Bill consulted his shabby watch. "It's a quarter to eleven. If you will
  give me until midday I promise to have Anatole back in this room. But you
  must leave me alone, please. You must lock the door and give me the key."</p>

  <p>"You are mad," Zosimo cried.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am. But I brought Anatole from Mamizan to you, and I got Kuno
  out of the country. If you trust me I will get the King back and shift Kuno
  where he won't bother you. If I don't, you can hang me or shoot me."</p>

  <p>Zosimo did his best to tear his hair.</p>

  <p>"I am plagued with demented children," he moaned. "But I will give you
  till noon."</p>

  <p>He rushed to the door and flung the key at Bill. "There, lock yourself in.
  Till twelve I go to direct the police search, for all Grachovo is being
  combed, but at twelve I return, and then you must satisfy me or suffer."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Bill. "Good luck to you."</p>

  <p>He locked the door and laid the key on a table. He realised that he was in
  for a much graver adventure than any he had hitherto met, but to his surprise
  he did not feel nervous. He was too miserable about Anatole and too angry
  with Kuno. He bitterly regretted that he had been so merciful, and had not
  left the latter on St. Kilda.</p>

  <p>He ordered the staff to carry him to Anatole's side&mdash;ordered it with
  a sick heart, for he feared that he might find Anatole dead.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; THE CROWNING ADVENTURE&mdash;II</h2>

  <p class="first">AT first Bill thought that his worst fears were justified.
  He found himself in a big, dim place, evidently just under the eaves of some
  building. There was a low dormer window on his left hand with every pane
  broken, and outside he saw the sun shining on the tides of a river. Within
  the air was thick with dust and smelt of stale straw and grain. It must be
  the upper floor of some waterside mill. On a heap of straw lay a small figure
  swathed like a mummy. The body was trussed up in sacking, and there was a
  bandage over the eyes and what looked like a gag in the mouth. The figure was
  very still, and Bill in terror laid his ear against its breast. Thank God, it
  still breathed.</p>

  <p>Never had Bill used his stalking knife&mdash;a gift last birthday from his
  father&mdash;to more purpose. He slit the sacking and cut the cords, after
  first removing the gag and the face bandage. Anatole was revealed clad in
  pale-blue silk pyjamas. His eyes were open and staring, and at first there
  was no recognition in them. But he was alive.</p>

  <p>Then a sound fell upon Bill's ear, the sound of heavy snoring. There was
  someone else in the room, someone sleeping in the straw only a few yards
  away.</p>

  <p>He saw that Anatole had now recognised him and was making feeble signs.
  The signs were for caution and silence. Bill put his head to the boy's lips
  and heard him murmur "Kuno."</p>

  <p>Very slowly Anatole began to move. His limbs were cramped, and his face
  was twisted with pain as he moved them, but he made no sound. Gently he
  raised himself until he sat up, and then he clutched Bill's arm, and there
  was terror in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Beel," he whispered, "take me away. They are going to murder
  me...."</p>

  <p>"Not they," said Bill. "Hold my arm, Anatole. I can shift you out of here
  any moment. But we must think. We need not be at the Palace for an hour. Tell
  me, what happened? Yes, hold me as tight as you can. You are quite safe. Now
  very slowly&mdash;I am listening. That hog over there won't wake."</p>

  <p>The boy had now mastered himself, but he still shivered like a frightened
  colt.</p>

  <p>"Kuno," he whispered. "Yesterday he came back. By air, it must have
  been.... My grandfather died suddenly before dinner. That you have heard.
  There was confusion in the Palace, for the discipline had become
  weak&mdash;and there was treachery, which, please God, I will yet discover
  and punish.... I went to bed and slept sound, for I was very weary. The next
  I knew was that I was in the hands of rough men&mdash;mountain men, I think.
  I fought, but I was easily overcome, and I could not cry out, for my head was
  muffled. Then I think I fainted, for I remember nothing until I came to my
  senses in this place. I saw Kuno&mdash;and others. I heard them talk, for
  they did not fear me any more, and spoke openly of their plans."</p>

  <p>"Where are we now?" Bill asked.</p>

  <p>"In Grachovo. By the river side, in a disused warehouse. There are men
  here they call the Water Rats&mdash;secret people who have long defied our
  police. They are Kuno's instruments. This night I am to be taken down the
  river away from Grachovo. They spoke of killing me first, but Kuno forbade
  it. 'Not yet,' he said. But he means to kill me, Beel, and hide my body far
  from Gracia, so that none will ever know my fate.... Oh, take me away! Save
  me, dear Beel, save me!"</p>

  <p>There was an hysterical note in the boy's voice which alarmed Bill. He
  stroked his head and put his arm round his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You are quite safe. Don't be afraid. But you are the King now, you know,
  and must look a bit ahead. We can't leave Kuno here."</p>

  <p>"We will return with a regiment and surround this place." A wholesome
  wrath was entering Anatole's voice.</p>

  <p>"He might escape. Besides, you don't want a big public row just at
  present. It would only stir up the Kunoites. Far better shift the brute to
  some place where he can't get away in a hurry. Our first job is to settle
  with Kuno."</p>

  <p>"But you will not leave me!" Terror was mounting again.</p>

  <p>"Let's both go. He is sleeping pretty sound?"</p>

  <p>"He is very weary. He said that he must have eight hours' sleep, for he
  flew from somewhere far away."</p>

  <p>"All right. Now do exactly as I tell you. Get a firm hold of my braces. We
  are going on a journey."</p>

  <p>Anatole rose staggeringly and balanced himself on his bare feet. Bill
  kicked off his shoes, his best shoes. They were never seen again, and their
  loss led to fierce recriminations from Elsie the nurse.</p>

  <p>The two boys stole across the room to the heap of straw where sprawled the
  figure of a sleeping man. Kuno was still in the clothes which Bill had last
  seen at Glenmore, including the fur-lined overcoat. But someone&mdash;perhaps
  Lanerick, the Lord-Lieutenant of Perthshire&mdash;had given him a knitted
  woollen muffler. To Bill's amusement it was in the colours of his own school.
  The man lay on his side with his face away from the boys, and his breathing
  told them that his slumbers were deep.</p>

  <p>Bill, as he had done before, grasped the belt of Kuno's greatcoat, while
  Anatole held on to his braces. Then with his right hand he twisted the
  staff.</p>

  <p>"I want to be taken to a quiet place near Moscow," he said.</p>

  <p>It was like tumbling into a cold bath. Bill found himself in what looked
  like a snow-covered brickfield. It was grey, biting weather, and the place
  seemed the last word in dreariness, for under the leaden sky the squalid and
  ruinous houses seemed to stretch endlessly.</p>

  <p>Kuno lay on the ground slowly wakening.</p>

  <p>The two boys slipped off to a distance of some yards and watched him as he
  rubbed his eyes and shambled to his feet like a great ox.</p>

  <p>"This is the place for him," said Bill. "He will be at home among the
  Bolshies.... Golly! it's cold. Speak to him, Anatole. Say good-bye
  nicely."</p>

  <p>Anatole, freezing in his silken pyjamas, managed to say a good deal. It
  was in a tongue which Bill did not understand, but its effect on Kuno was
  plain enough. Amazement, fear, and fury chased each other across his
  expressive countenance. The last words of all must have had a special sting,
  for with a roar the big man started towards them.</p>

  <p>"We had better hop it," said Bill. But before he twirled the stick he
  added to the commination service something on his own account, in the most
  abusive French he could compass. It was "<i>Sale bête! maintenant vous l'avez
  pris dans le cou</i>."</p>

  <p>The Palace was beautifully warm, and in his own room the frozen Anatole
  was himself again. He flung himself on Bill and hugged him, and then skipped
  about the floor to get the stiffness out of his legs. "I must have a bath,"
  he cried, "and food, for I am famished." Then he caught sight of a long green
  case on the table. "What is that?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"It's my present to you," said Bill. "I thought you'd like it. It is a
  sporting rifle just like my father's."</p>

  <p>The boys were deep in the examination of its marvels, and Anatole was
  lying flat on a couch sighting it over a cushion, when the hour of midday
  boomed from the Cathedral tower and reminded Bill of his duty. He unlocked
  the door, rang the bell, and summoned a servant.</p>

  <p>"His Majesty requires the attendance of Prince Zosimo," was his order.</p>

  <p>When Zosimo, still dishevelled and grey with care, presented himself, he
  was confronted by his King in fluttering pyjamas holding a small rifle at the
  present.</p>

  <p>"Rejoice, my uncle," said Anatole, "for all is well. The great Beel has
  brought me back, and, as you see, he has armed me. Bid the police cease their
  activities. The Water Rats we will gather up at our leisure. As for friend
  Kuno, the good God has him in keeping. At this moment he is perhaps trying to
  explain to the Soviet officers what he is doing in the suburbs of Moscow. I
  think the task will not be easy."</p>

  <p>Thereafter Bill walked into a romance which was beyond his craziest dream.
  He was given a bath in hot scented water, and though he cordially disliked
  all scents he rather enjoyed it. Then came a little man in white linen who
  begged permission to arrange his hair, and Bill, who did not love barbers,
  submitted as to a high ceremonial. Then a valet dressed him in the clothes
  which had been appointed&mdash;a jacket and breeches of white satin with gold
  buttons, white silk stockings, and wonderful white leather shoes with black
  rosettes, since the Court was in mourning for the dead monarch. Round his
  waist was clasped a belt of fine gold mesh studded with rough turquoises from
  the mountains, and from it was suspended the curved sword of a Gracian noble.
  On his left breast was pinned the gold star of St. Lampadas; it had five
  points set with brilliants, and in the centre was the enamelled figure of
  that saint in his famous act of bearing the lit Lamp of the Temple through
  what appeared to be a cyclone. From his shoulders hung an embroidered cloak
  of purple velvet, and on his head was a peaked cap with an osprey's plume set
  in a jewel of emeralds.</p>

  <p>By all his standards he should have felt a fool, for had he not invariably
  made a scene at home when he was compelled to go to a fancy-dress party? But
  Bill did not feel a fool. I am afraid he felt rather like a hero. He had his
  lunch alone, but, though the lunch was excellent, he ate little, thereby
  obeying one of his mother's injunctions that morning.</p>

  <p>The afternoon passed like a dream. The city was in mourning, but also
  keyed up to a tense excitement. There was no music as they drove in the state
  coaches to the Cathedral through the packed streets, and indeed little sound
  of any kind. The people were waiting until the sacred Lamp was replenished
  and the life of Gracia could begin its new year.</p>

  <p>In the great, dim Cathedral Bill stood a little behind the new King, while
  the organ boomed, and the trebles of the choristers rose with the joy of a
  spring sunrise. Bill had eyes only for Anatole, as he knelt before the altar
  and received from the hands of the Archbishop the sacred oil. This boy, only
  a little older than himself, was taking charge of a nation and dedicating
  himself to a high purpose. Bill forgot all about himself and the magic staff
  and honour and glory. He felt shy and solemn and abashed, and full to the
  brim of good resolutions.</p>

  <p>But when they emerged from the Cathedral the pomp of the world again laid
  hold of him. For now the people of Grachovo seemed to have done with their
  mourning, though the old King lay dead in their midst. They hailed a new King
  and a new world. The national anthem of Gracia rose like a strong wind. The
  band of the Royal Guards played it and a hundred thousand voices joined in.
  Never had Bill heard such music. It was like all the bold songs he
  remembered&mdash;"Rule Britannia" and "Blue Bonnets over the Border" and "Men
  of Harlech"&mdash;blended in one superb defiance. He sat up very stiff in the
  royal carriage and tried not to cry.</p>

  <p>But in the Hall of Audience he did cry, for that was more than flesh and
  blood could bear. There was no King to present the Crown Prince to the
  nobles, for the Crown Prince was now King and had to present himself. When
  Anatole stepped forward, very little and quaint in his Field-Marshal's
  uniform, and in a breaking voice asked for the allegiance of his people,
  there came a shout which made the walls tremble, and a hundred swords flashed
  upwards. The King was so small and so young and had come through so much
  tribulation, that the faces below the dais, many of them grim and scarred,
  melted into a sudden tenderness. There were tears in the Hall of Audience, a
  portent which had not been seen for many a day.</p>

  <p>Said Prince Zosimo, speaking to himself:</p>

  <p>"The monarchy is secure. Nay, Gracia is secure, for she has found an
  authority which she can love."</p>

  <p>An hour later, while Bill was hurrying into his own clothes, Anatole sat
  by him, pale but happy, and with a strange dignity in his face.</p>

  <p>"You will come back soon, dear Beel," he said. "I shall be busy, for now I
  must rule with the aid of my Regency Council, but without you I shall be a
  lonely king."</p>

  <p>Bill arrived in his bedroom in Portland Place about six o'clock. He waited
  there until it was time to dress, for he did not want to talk to anybody.</p>

  <p>"I never heard you come home," his mother told him, when the family met in
  the drawing-room before dinner. "Have you had a good day?"</p>

  <p>Bill nodded. "Good" was scarcely the word he would have chosen. He was
  very quiet all evening, and played draughts with Aunt Alice besides visiting
  Peter in bed. Something tremendous had happened to him, a destiny with which
  he could not quite cope.</p>

  <p>He had been switched to the top of a high mountain, and he wondered how he
  was going to take up his road in the valley again. He felt rather old, and
  yet desperately conscious that he was young and feeble and of no particular
  account. For the first time in his life Bill knew what it was to be
  humble.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; THE GOING OF THE STAFF</h2>

  <p class="first">NEXT morning Bill rose with a cloud on his mind. He had
  slept long and deep and had had no dreams, but as soon as he opened his eyes
  he knew that something was amiss. It was a detestable morning, foggy with a
  slight drizzle, and he dressed in a mood of despondency which he could not
  understand.</p>

  <p>The marvels of yesterday could never happen again. That was the only thing
  about which he was clear. Something must come between him and Anatole, for
  how could an ordinary schoolboy in England, not much respected by his
  masters, keep up his friendship with a far-away King? And yet he liked
  Anatole so much that his eyes filled when he thought of leaving him. And
  Anatole needed him too. He would be very solitary among the old men. And
  there was Kuno ramping among the Bolsheviks. Some day Kuno would come back
  and make trouble.</p>

  <p>But he had still the magic staff. That was his only consolation amid his
  forebodings. He handled it lovingly and it gave him a little comfort.</p>

  <p>At breakfast he did not look at the papers. No doubt they were full of
  yesterday's doings in Grachovo, but he did not want to read them. He
  preferred to keep his memory select and secret like a dream.</p>

  <p>He spent the morning indoors with the now convalescent Peter, making
  believe to be deeply interested in his new camera. Aunt Alice, after her
  fashion, announced that he was an odd boy but had clearly a good heart.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon came the conjuring show at the Albemarle Hall. In the
  past Bill had shown an inordinate appetite for such entertainments, but now
  the idea seemed to him merely silly. What were disappearing donkeys and
  vanishing ladies compared to the performances which he had lately staged? But
  he had to pretend to be enthusiastic, feeling that good manners were required
  from an associate of princes.</p>

  <p>When they reached the door of the hall he had an unpleasant shock. He was
  required to give up his stick and receive a metal check for it. To his
  mother's surprise he protested loudly. "It won't do any harm," he pleaded.
  "It will stay beside me under the seat." But the rule was inexorable and he
  had to surrender it.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid, darling," his mother told him. "That funny stick of
  yours won't be lost. The check is a receipt for it, and they are very
  careful."</p>

  <p>The world had darkened for Bill, and all his forebodings of the morning
  returned. While Peter gurgled and giggled, he spent an hour and a half of
  black misery. This was worse than last half when the stick had been left
  behind at home. He kept his eyes tightly shut, for he could not take the
  slightest interest in the antics on the stage. Happily his mother could not
  see him; she thought that his stillness was due to an intense absorption.</p>

  <p>When the performance came to an end he dragged his mother and Peter
  furiously through the crowd; but they had been near the front of the Hall and
  were slow in reaching the entrance. With his heart in his mouth he pushed up
  to the counter. There was no sign of the man who had given him the check.
  Instead there was a youth who seemed to be new to the business, and who was
  very clumsy in returning the sticks and umbrellas.</p>

  <p>When it came to Bill's turn he was extra slow, and presently announced
  that he could find no No. 229. Bill was almost in tears. His mother, seeing
  his distress, intervened, and sent the youth to look again while other people
  were kept waiting. But the youth came back with the same story. There was no
  duplicate No. 229 or any article corresponding to Bill's description.</p>

  <p>After that he had to be allowed to attend to the others, and Bill waited
  hysterically until the crowd had gone. Then there was a thorough search, and
  Bill and his mother and Peter were allowed to go behind the counter.</p>

  <p>But no No. 229 could be found, and there were no sticks left, only three
  umbrellas.</p>

  <p>Bill was now patently weeping.</p>

  <p>"Never mind, darling," his mother said. "We must go home now, or Aunt
  Alice will be anxious. I promise that your father will come here to-morrow
  and clear up the whole business. Never fear&mdash;the stick will be
  found."</p>

  <p>But Bill had the awful conviction in his heart that it was lost.</p>

  <p>When Bill's father went there next day and cross-examined the wretched
  youth he extracted a curious story. If the staff was lost, so also was the
  keeper of the walking-sticks, for the youth was only his assistant. The
  keeper&mdash;his name was Jukes and he lived in Hammersmith&mdash;had not
  been seen since yesterday afternoon during the performance. Mrs. Jukes had
  come round and made a scene, and that morning the police had been
  informed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jukes, it appeared, was not a very pleasant character, and he had had
  too much beer at luncheon. When the audience had all gone in, he had
  expressed to his assistant his satiety of life.</p>

  <p>The youth's testimony ran as follows:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Jukes, 'e was wavin' his arm something chronic, and carryin' on about
  'ow this was no billet for a man like 'im. He picks up a stick, and I thought
  he was goin' to 'it me. 'Percy, me lad,' says 'e, 'I'm fed up&mdash;fed up to
  the back teeth.' He starts twirling the stick, and says 'e, 'I wish to 'eaven
  I was out of 'ere.' After that I must 'ave come over faint, for when I looks
  again, 'e 'ad 'opped it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Jukes's case is still a puzzle to his bereaved wife and to the police,
  the general idea being that he had levanted to escape the responsibilities of
  his family. But Bill understands only too clearly what happened. Mr. Jukes
  and the staff have gone "out of 'ere," and where that may be neither Bill nor
  I can guess.</p>

  <p>In the miserable weeks that followed Bill reasoned out the matter with
  himself and came to this conclusion. The staff was not <i>Beauty</i>, but
  <i>Bands</i>, and he attributed his loss to the fact that he had been
  thinking too much of his own amusement. He did not believe that <i>Bands</i>
  had republican principles and disliked monarchies. But <i>Bands</i>had come
  to dislike <i>him</i>. He had been too proud and had thought a great deal
  about his own cleverness, when it was the staff that did everything.
  <i>Bands</i> wanted to teach him humility, or perhaps <i>Bands</i>meant well
  and understood that Bill had simply got himself into a position where going
  on was impossible. He had cut in on the road too far ahead, and must now go
  back and retrace the path from the start.</p>

  <p>So Bill wrote to Anatole and told him what had happened, and received in
  return a letter which made him howl, but which also heartened him. Some day
  Bill would come to Grachovo, or if he did not Anatole would come to England,
  for, said the King of Gracia, "We two have gone through so many difficult
  places that fate cannot separate us."</p>

  <p>Bill is very humble nowadays, and at the back of his head he has a faint
  hope that somehow or other and sometime or other the staff may return to him.
  He would even be content if he knew that it was back in the ordinary world,
  though in the possession of someone else, for he cannot bear to think that a
  thing so wonderful should have gone altogether out of human life.</p>

  <p>So he wants me to broadcast this story.</p>

  <p>Let every boy and girl keep a sharp eye on shops where sticks are sold.
  The magic staff is not quite four feet long and about one and a quarter
  inches thick. It is made of a heavy dark red wood, rather like the West
  Indian purpleheart. Its handle is in the shape of a crescent with the horns
  uppermost, made of some white substance which is neither bone nor ivory. If
  anyone sees such a stick, then Bill will give all his worldly wealth for news
  of it.</p>

  <p>Failing that, he would like information about the man who sold it to him.
  He is very old, small and wizened, but his eyes are the brightest you ever
  saw in a human head. He wears a shabby greeny-black overcoat which reaches
  down to his heels, and a tall greeny-black bowler hat. It is possible that
  the stick may have returned to him. So if you meet anyone like him, look
  sharply at his bundle, and if it is there and he is willing to sell, <i>buy,
  buy, buy</i>, or you will regret it all your days. For this purpose it is
  wise always to have a farthing in your pocket, for he won't give change.</p>
