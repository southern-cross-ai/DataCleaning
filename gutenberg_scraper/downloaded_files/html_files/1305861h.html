  <p class="first">
  I REACHED out of bed, and turning down the lamp, tried to sleep. The
  knowledge of the fact that one has, by a single foolish action, placed
  himself on the verge of bankruptcy is scarcely conducive to mental quiet, and
  it was only after what seemed to me hours of wakefulness that I sank into a
  fitful sleep.</p>

  <p>I could not have been dozing more than half an hour when a knock at my
  door aroused me. A knock at such an hour, could only mean one thing to a
  house surgeon, and getting out of bed, I opened the door to admit, as I had
  expected, the night porter.</p>

  <p>"Case just come in, sir," he said tersely. "Dr. Thompson don't think he's
  likely to live."</p>

  <p>"What sort of case?" I asked sharply, for even one liable to end fatally
  did not necessarily require my attention, "and when was he brought in?"</p>

  <p>The porter was rather taken aback at my brusqueness, for amongst my
  subordinates, I believe, I bore a reputation for courtesy.</p>

  <p>"Brought in a few minutes since, sir." said the man. "Came in a cab with a
  policeman. 'Pears as how he was goin' home from his club, and passin' down
  Holborn the horse bolted and came bang against a pillar at the corner of
  Chancery Lane, gent was thrown out of the cab and fell against the kerb."</p>

  <p>By this time I was ready, and after bathing my face to waken me I followed
  the porter down the dimly-lighted corridor that connected my quarters with
  the hospital, along the broad stone-flagged central hall, with its many glass
  doors opening into various wards, till my guide stopped before No. 11, the
  accident ward.</p>

  <p>I entered and softly closed the door behind me. Screened off from the rest
  of the ward, on an operating table, lay the form of a man, who was in evening
  dress, the coat of which had been removed to allow the surgeon to commence
  operations.</p>

  <p>By his side stood the night nurse and Thompson, who nodded as I entered. I
  went nearer to the table and looked into the face. Good God!
  Newton!&mdash;Newton whom I left a few hours before in the bloom of
  health&mdash;and now!</p>

  <p>For the moment I forgot our last interview when I had left my club, a
  ruined man, with the haunting remembrance of Newton, a sympathetic smile on
  his florid face, making a bundle of the notes and bills that I, in the true
  gambler's spirit, had plunged with to recoup the trifling losses of the
  previous evening. The sympathetic smile was part of his stock-in-trade, and
  was the result of long practice. Believing in that ancient fallacy, luck must
  turn, I had plunged and plunged, till I suddenly realized that I had lost
  every penny I had in the world.</p>

  <p>In that evening I had entered the private card room a comparatively
  wealthy man, and had left it with my year's salary mortgaged. I had read of
  such cases, but had always accepted them with a grain of salt. For how, I
  argued, can a man continue to play a losing game! Why does he not desist when
  he finds luck against him? Even now I couldn't say why I hadn't; I only knew
  that I had played doggedly on, expecting my luck to turn.</p>

  <p>In the bitterness of the moment I had said some hard things concerning
  Newton's "luck," which I more than hinted was assisted by the lucky one's
  dexterity. He had retaliated with words that had made me wince; he had told
  me that by such fools as I&mdash;those were his words&mdash;he managed to
  make a living. There were other stinging, maddening things he had said, such
  as only an educated man could have said, but now for the time I forgot his
  insults, forgot that he had ruined me, and only saw the poor battered form
  that lay awaiting my skill.</p>

  <p>"What are the injuries?" I asked, regaining my composure.</p>

  <p>"The scalp wound that you can see," was Thompson's reply. I nodded; one
  could not help but see that ugly gash that stretched across the head from
  eyebrow to ear. "Anything else?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't looked," he answered. "I thought I'd wait till you came. The
  bleeding ceased soon after his arrival. I have had him washed up. Will you
  examine him?"</p>

  <p>I took off my coat, and, rolling up my sleeves, proceeded to inspect the
  wound.</p>

  <p>It was, I could see at first glance, a serious case.</p>

  <p>I ran my finger gingerly along the bare skull that lay exposed till I felt
  a little swelling beneath my fingers; unlike the ordinary bump, it was
  splintered across in two or three directions. I looked up and met Thompson's
  inquiring eyes.</p>

  <p>"Fracture?" was the question.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered slowly. "A small fracture above the brain. Just see if
  there's anything else."</p>

  <p>Carefully and tenderly Thompson passed his hands over the body and limbs
  of the insensible man; "a fractured rib," he muttered, half to himself as
  surgeons are wont to do. "That's nothing; face cut up, evidently from a sharp
  stone&mdash;that's nothing, other limbs seem all right. What are you going to
  do!" This last remark was addressed to me.</p>

  <p>I gave the wound another glance and then decided. "Get the instruments
  ready for trepanning," I said, "it must be done at once, or it will be too
  late. There is, undoubtedly, a compression which must be removed."</p>

  <p>As my assistant and the nurses hastened noiselessly to obey my orders, I
  was left alone with the inanimate form. It was a scene that could not have
  failed to impress the most callous observer.</p>

  <p>The long airy room was just sufficiently lit to allow the attendants to
  move about without injury to limb. The first faint streaks of the dawn were
  struggling through the windows at the farther end of the ward, its ghastly
  light making the flickering night-lamps a bilious yellow. This was no novel
  experience to me; I lived my life amidst these rows of sufferers.</p>

  <p>Even the sweet scented flowers that stood amidst the queer shaped
  instruments on the nursing sister's table were so inseparably associated wilh
  the internal decoration of a hospital, that a visit to the fairest garden
  amidt the most picturesque surroundings had no other effect than to recall
  the scenes of suffering that I had left behind. They were so familiar, too,
  those neat cots with the overhanging pulleys, and the little Scriptural texts
  above each patient's head.</p>

  <p>I looked at Newton. How still he lay! To all intents and purposes dead. I
  had served a long and hard apprenticeship, and suffering and death had long
  ceased to cause me mental pain. There had been a time when the sight of a
  blood-splashed knife had made me feel sick and giddy, and the memory of the
  patient's agonized cries had haunted me through the long hours of the night.
  These times had passed, but in passing they left a few lines on my forehead,
  and had given a tinge of gray to my hair as a souvenir. In spite of practice
  a feeling of pity came over me for this unfortunate man, who had probably
  only a few hours to live.</p>

  <p>His "choker" collar and his white tie had been removed to allow of his
  breathing, and from the front of his dress shirt, crumpled and stained, a
  single brilliant winked and glittered. I turned my head with half a sigh,
  when almost at my feet, I saw what, in the dim light, appeared to be a sack.
  Methodical, even in my abstraction, I stooped, with the intention of removing
  it to the outside of my ward.</p>

  <p>The moment my fingers touched it I realized that what I had taken for a
  sack was a dust-coat&mdash;evidently Newton's.</p>

  <p>I switched on the electric light under which his head had been placed; the
  coat was soiled with that mixture peculiar to London street
  accidents&mdash;mud and blood. As I turned to put the coat with the remainder
  of the clothing on an adjacent locker, something fell from the pocket; it was
  a pocket-book, I bent down and picked it up, and was about to replace it,
  when, like a flash, I remembered that in this book were the bills and notes
  that Newton had won from me the same evening.</p>

  <p>For a moment I stood irresolute.</p>

  <p>Here lay a man on the point of death, a man who had as good as confessed
  that he lived on the wits of fools&mdash;such fools as I. He had not, I knew,
  a single relative in the world, no prying heirs to raise awkward
  questions.</p>

  <p>Half unconsciously, I pressed back the clasp, and opened the flap. Yes.
  there snug and crisp, lay the little roll of notes and papers; in two or
  three places I could see my signature, "Donald Fraser," written at the foot
  of divers bills that spelt ruin to me. What a fool I had been! And what a
  fool I was. Within my grasp lay all that I desired, and who was to know? He
  had left the club at the same time as I. I knew there was only one small
  chance of his recovering; if by that chance he lived, I could restore the
  money, and if he died&mdash;. After all, was not this money mine? Yes, I
  would take it. This episode should be a lesson to me for all lifetime. I
  would never again touch a card.</p>

  <p>Thompson would soon be returning. I refastened the clasp of the book and,
  raising my eyes, I met the fixed gaze of&mdash;Newton! For a moment I was
  speechless; the shock of encountering the glare of those eyes that I had
  thought closed in insensibility, produced a momentary paralysis. For the
  moment I imagined that I had been speaking my thoughts aloud, but recovering
  my mental equilibrium, my professional instincts came to my rescue.</p>

  <p>"You must remain perfectly quiet," I said in a subdued tone; "you have met
  with a bad accident."</p>

  <p>He did not speak, but his eyes rested for a second on the pocket-book, and
  then rose to my face, into which, in spite of a determined effort, and for
  the first time in my life, a blush of guilt was creeping. He evidently
  noticed my distress, and mistaking the cause, he said faintly. "It's all
  right. Fraser, don't trouble, I'm not afraid of your holding these things, I
  know you are straight!"</p>

  <p>The blush deepened, and I tossed the accursed thing that had made me
  forget duty, as a gentleman and a physician, on to the heap of clothing. If
  he was a sharper, what was I, a thief? Had the tables been turned, and he,
  instead of I, been the loser, should I have considered his feelings! I looked
  at Newton; he lay with half-closed eyes, breathing very quickly, and I could
  see he was lapsing again into insensibility. Thompson at this moment came up
  with an apology for keeping me so long; he bore a tray containing the
  instruments. The nurses who accompanied him placed the necessary waters and
  antiseptics in the various basins, and all was ready.</p>

  <p>Thompson looked curiously at the patient.</p>

  <p>"Has he regained consciousness!" he asked, proceeding to divest himself of
  his coat, and fastening back his cuffs.</p>

  <p>"For a short time, yes," I answered. "He is half-conscious now; these
  periods of lucidity are not uncommon in cases of compression." I felt the
  pulse&mdash;it was normal; with a stethoscope I examined the heart, this,
  too, was sound.</p>

  <p>"I shall give him chloroform," I said, by way of explanation, "and
  endeavour to elevate the splintered bone." Newton opened his eyes, and
  glanced from one to the other; at last his inquiring gaze rested on
  Thompson.</p>

  <p>"This is Doctor Thompson," I said, thinking to inspire him with
  confidence; "we are going to operate on you, there will be little or no
  pain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped me with an almost imperceptible movement of his head.</p>

  <p>"I want to talk alone," he said, and there was a suspicious thickness in
  his voice that warned me that any interview would have to be short. "I want
  to talk alone with Dr. Thompson."</p>

  <p>I started in astonishment, for I knew they were not even acquaint ed. "Do
  you mean me?" I asked, thinking that the injury might have affected his
  brain.</p>

  <p>"No, no!" he said almost impatiently, "I mean that gentleman."</p>

  <p>It was a strange request, but I could see that every moment now was
  precious.</p>

  <p>At a motion from me, Thompson took his place by the side of the patient's
  head, and the nurses, with myself, withdrew. Why should he wish to speak to
  Thompson! I could see them from where I stood, the patient speaking slowly
  and evidently painfully, and Thompson's nod of acquiescence. Suddenly the
  conversation came to an end, and beckoning one of the nurses to him, my
  colleague walked to the heap of clothing, and picking up Newton's book,
  placed it in his pocket, and resuming his place by the patient's side,
  continued the conversation.</p>

  <p>Now I knew! Newton had told him of what he had seen when he bad recovered
  from his insensibility. He had called the nurse for a witness and handed the
  book and its contents into my assistant's keeping for safety. To-morrow, the
  whole world&mdash;my world, would know that, in addition to being a ruined
  gambler, Donald Fraser, Doctor of Medicine, had violated the sacred laws of
  humanity, had dishonoured his noble profession, by attempting to rob a
  patient!</p>

  <p>I made my way back to the table. Thompson looked curiously at me, but I
  avoided his glance, and by a mighty effort of will all emotions were hidden
  for a time, and I took my place at his side, not as the man whose reputation
  was at his mercy, but as a surgeon.</p>

  <p>I took up the conical inhaler that lay on the tray and, bending over the
  head of the dying man, for dying now he undoubtedly was, placed it over the
  patient's mouth and nose, and gently shook a few drops of the anaesthetic
  over its porous sides. The sickly, penetrating odour of the chloroform rose
  and, as he felt the first whiff of it in his lungs, Newton opened his eyes
  and, looking at Thompson in a meaning manner, said the one word, "remember"
  Thompson nodded and again glanced from me to the patient, who, closing his
  eyes, was gently inhaling. Now and then, as is usual, when patients are
  sinking under the influence of the chloroform, the breathing for a moment
  ceased, but a slight pressure upon the uninjured side would cause him to
  resume his respiration. After a while, I lifted the eyelids, and gently
  touched the pupils. Yes, he was well under. I handed the inhaler to Thompson
  and, dipping my hands into the antiseptic lotion, I commenced.</p>

  <p>It was a difficult job, even more so than I had anticipated; the fracture
  extended farther than I had thought, but I had not been working long before I
  realized the hopelessness of my task. But, to a surgeon, the adage, "Whilst
  there's life, there's hope," had a special significance, and the fact that to
  all appearance my work would be useless did not deter me from doing my
  utmost.</p>

  <p>The end came very quietly. Thompson, who was administering sufficienly
  small doses of chloroform to keep the patient insensible, suddenly dropped
  the inhaler and, picking up the stethoscope, applied it to the heart. I
  stopped my work and leaned, red-handed, on the table, awaiting his
  decision.</p>

  <p>"You can stop," he said after a while, "he's dead." I took the instrument
  from him and listened. It was as he said! Newton had gone to face his
  Maker.</p>

  <p>Hastly washing and drying my hands, I slipped on my coat, and made my way
  back to my room.</p>

  <p>Now that it was all over, a dreary feeling of my own helplessness came
  over me, and as I drew a basket chair up to the fire that the porter had
  replenished in my absence, I thought of the misery I should have to face on
  the morrow. I glanced at my watch; it was three o'clock. To-morrow, then, was
  to-day. To-day I should die&mdash;the social death. I never realized till
  that minute how dear this little world of mine was to me. The functions that
  I had held up to ridicule as senseless and time-wasting, seemed now to be
  clothed with a dignity and refinement unthought of. The profession I loved so
  well, and God knows, no mother could suffer more at the death of her
  firstborn than I at the thought of severing myself from St, Mark's.</p>

  <p>What a blackguard I was. I fancied I could hear Newton saying, "I can
  trust you, you are straight." I who, even as he spoke, was weighing the
  chances of evading detection. And yet, after all, he could not have meant it,
  otherwise why should he have told Thompson?</p>

  <p>A quick footstep echoed down the corridor, and stopped opposite my door.
  There was a knock. I rose from my chair, and opened the door to Thompson.
  "Come in," I said, closing the door after him. He seated himself, facing me,
  on the opposite side of the fire. I pushed the decanter towards him.</p>

  <p>I hadn't the nerve to open the conversation.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," he said, helping himself to a modest allowance of Burgundy. "I
  owe you an apology for disturbing your rest again, but I have to tell you
  what transpired between this patient and myself." I nodded. I had expected
  something of this, if not so soon, and my hand trembled as I pushed back the
  decanter from its perilous position on the edge of the table, where Thompson,
  with youthful disregard to safety, had left it. It is curious how, in times
  of great trouble, or mental worry, little trifling incidents leave a lasting
  impression on one's mind, and the sight of a decanter placed too near the
  edge of a table has ever since then reminded me of that startling
  interview.</p>

  <p>"I saw when you came into ward," my assistant went on, "that you knew him,
  and you can imagine, knowing this, how surprised I was when he asked for an
  interview with me. I could see that you, too, were a little astonished;
  however, before I had time to recover from my amazement, you were gone, and
  we were left together. The first thing he did was to ask me whether I knew
  anything about law. I told him I did for, as you know, my people are in the
  law, and I was, at first, intended for that stuffy profession. He then asked
  me whether he could dispose of his property without making a will. I told him
  that such a thing was permissible in cases of urgent necessity. 'Such as
  this?' he asked. 'Yes,' I replied, 'this would he a case in which you could
  verbally bequeath your property, providing it was done in the presccnce of
  two disinterested persons.' It was then, at his request, that I called Nurse
  Joyce, and searched among his clothing for a pocket-book. This I found and
  brought to him, and then to my profound astonishment, he said, 'In the
  presence of these witnesses I bequeath this book and its contents
  to&mdash;Doctor Donald Fraser, of St. Mark's Hospital!'" As Thompson said
  this he drew from his pocket the book.</p>

  <p>I had risen to my feet as he commenced his story and stood by the window
  that overlooked the dawn-lit quadrangle of the hospital. I had done this
  partly to hide any show of emotion that may have been evident, partly
  because, in my then condition of mind, I could not remain seated, but as the
  unlooked for, unthought of story of Newton's generosity was laid before me,
  the room swam round, and the figure of Thompson, silhouetted against the
  dancing flames of the fire, became blurred and indistinct. "For me?" I
  managed to gasp.</p>

  <p>"Yes, for you, and he made me promise to hand it to you to-night. 'For,'
  he said, 'there are some papers that I want the doctor to burn.'"</p>

  <p>My fingers closed over the leathern package.</p>

  <p>"He added a very strange sentence," said Thompson. "His last words before
  you came were, 'Tell the doctor the cards were marked.'"</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking Thompson stepped towards the door and, holding it
  open, he looked down, with a perplexed frown. "About those papers," he said,
  "I don't know whether it is irregular to destroy them until the will has been
  proved, but as it was evidently his wish, I suppose you had better burn
  them."</p>

  <p>"I think I had better do so," I answered, closing the door after him and
  turning towards the fire.</p>
