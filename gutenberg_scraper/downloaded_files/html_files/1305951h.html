<h1>A SON OF THE SEA</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>CHAPTER I<br>
WHY TORRE LEIGH WENT TO SEA</h2>
<p>&quot;HIT him again, Torre! harder, oh harder, ever so much!
Mind! he's got a stone! Oh, the great coward!&quot;</p>
<p>Thus shrilled a little girl as she danced, wild with excitement,
around two boys, one considerably the stouter and heavier, who were
doggedly pummelling each other in a secluded spot of garden hidden
from the house by a thick grove of laurels.</p>
<p>As she spoke, the bigger of the combatants paused a minute to
shake his fist at her, and his opponent, a much slighter and
younger lad, seizing his opportunity, rushed in and planted such a
shrewd fist on the other's nose that the blood began to flow pretty
freely. Wild with the pain of the blow, he ran close up to the
other boy, and, when only a foot or so away, with all his strength
hurled a piece of rock he had picked up from a miniature mountain
fernery close at hand. As luck would have it his opponent moved his
head slightly, and the jagged stone, in place of hitting fairly,
and probably killing him, only cut a shallow groove across his
forehead. But in a second his face was streaming with blood. The
little girl screamed with fright and ran away as the lad, wiping
his eyes clear, sprang like a wild cat at the other's throat, got
one arm around it, and bending his head down into chancery punched
it with such hearty goodwill that it was soon of the same colour as
his own, whilst the loud bellowing of the sufferer could be heard
all over the garden.</p>
<p>At this critical moment there appeared on the scene a stout,
bald-headed, elderly gentleman, dragged along rapidly by the little
girl already mentioned. The pair paused as they took in the aspect
of the fight, and the newcomer remarked placidly, as he put up his
<i>pince-nez</i>, &quot;Why, Edie, I thought you told me that Torre
was getting killed! Now, as well as I can make out, I think my
stepson seems in most danger, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, pa, it's all right now,&quot; assented Edie,
cheerfully. &quot;Look, Torre's punching him real good an'
cumfable. That'll learn him to throw cowardly stones
again&mdash;and tie crackers to my cat's tail.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; replied her father, &quot;I really think, my
dear, that I must put a stop to it now, before your mother comes.
Laban's roarings are enough to wake the dead.&quot;</p>
<p>But even as he spoke a voice was heard above the din of battle
that made the pair draw back hurriedly, whilst on to the scene
marched a tall, thin, hard-faced woman, who, catching up a garden
rake that lay handy, commenced at once to belabour the smaller of
the boys.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you wicked villain,&quot; she screamed, &quot;do you
want to murder my poor Labie! Take that (whack) and that! (whack).
Off you go for good, this time. Uncle or no uncle, Torre Leigh,
I've done with you. Go and find a home for yourself where you like.
But stay here to knock poor Laban about in this way you shall
not!&quot; (whack, whack).</p>
<p>Up till now the boy addressed had hung on to his prey like a
bull-dog. But the round of a rake handle, with a furious woman at
the other end to ply it, must take effect in time, so the lad let
go his hold of the enemy, who at once sought protection under his
mother's wing, sobbing and blubbering, and with nose, eyes, and
mouth showing the effects of heavy punishment. Meanwhile Torre
backed away towards his coat lying on the grass behind him&mdash;a
slim, active figure of a fifteen years old lad, with dark curly
hair, brown eyes, oval face, and alert, upright carriage, an
undeniably handsome youngster, showing something of blood and
breeding, too, in the style of him.</p>
<p>His late opponent, now seated beside his mother, who, as she
wiped his damaged face, paused every now and then to abuse Torre,
was fully a couple of years the elder, stout, broad-chested, and of
so light a complexion that even eyelashes and brows looked quite
white, whilst the eyes themselves, of a pale milk-and-water blue,
were shifty, narrow, and too close together.</p>
<p>&quot;Torre,&quot; whispered a voice from the other side of the
laurel bushes, and the boy, pushing through them, found a pair of
soft young arms round his neck, whilst kisses rained on his
discoloured face.</p>
<p>Edith Bovey was only fourteen, but tall for her age, and in
appearance not unlike her cousin, Torre Leigh, possessing the same
rich dark complexion, deep brown eyes, and slim figure. Indeed,
they might have passed for brother and sister anywhere.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm ashamed of you, Torre,&quot; said his uncle in a
matter-of-fact sort of way, belied, however, by a kindly smile.
&quot;You're always in mischief, and always rowing with Laban. What
your aunt will do this time I really don't know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, uncle,&quot; replied Torre, as the three walked
away, &quot;I can't help it. You see, he tied a bunch of crackers
to Mab's tail and set them alight, and nearly drove the poor thing
mad. Then, when I tried to take 'em off he hit me. So, and
so&mdash;why, you see, there was nothing else for it. And, I say,
uncle, you know I've been wanting this long time to leave school
and get away to sea. There's no peace here for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Umph,&quot; said Mr Bovey, irresolutely, &quot;I'd like
you to have another year or two's schooling. Still, it's very
evident you and Laban will never hit it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, uncle,&quot; replied Torre, with a laugh, &quot;we hit
each other. He's always had the best of it, too, till to-day, when
I got a few in that he won't forget in a hurry, I'll bet.&quot;</p>
<p>And the others, although they said nothing, seemed to derive
satisfaction from the idea.</p>
<p>Mr Bovey, after many years spent in business as a wholesale
grocer in Exeter, had retired with a fair competence to a pleasant
house in the village of Newton Pomeroy, on the coast of South
Devon. At that time he was a widower with one child, Edith. Then,
in an unfortunate moment, he married the present Mrs Bovey, a widow
named Freeman, possessing, besides a snug little income derived
from money carefully invested in Consols, a boy by her first
husband.</p>
<p>Mr Bovey's sister, Jane, had married and survived a young army
officer of good family, and when she died she left a legacy to her
brother in the shape of Torre and &pound;100 in trust for him.</p>
<p>Open war had always raged between little Edie Bovey and Laban
Freeman, but on Torre's appearance in the household, very much
against Mrs Bovey's wish, matters became worse. At first Laban
bullied the pair unmercifully, making their young lives a burden to
them, and supported ever by Mrs Bovey, of whom her husband stood in
awe, both as regarded her tongue and her person, the first of which
was sharp and tireless, the latter powerful to masculinity.</p>
<p>As time went on the condition of affairs at &quot;Laurustinus
Lodge&quot; resolved itself into one of unequal but acknowledged
hostility between Mrs Bovey and her son on one side, and Torre and
Edith on the other, with Mr Bovey as a passive well-wisher to the
weaker party, and an ineffective court of appeal to both. Until
to-day the opposition had always scored. Therefore, now, Torre and
Edie felt a qualified delight; nor was the former in any hurry to
remove the stains of battle, albeit the rake-handle so vigorously
applied to the small of his back made him walk with a shortened
strut that seemed triumphant, but was emphatically not so.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose she'll be sending for us presently,&quot;
remarked Mr Bovey after a while. And these few words sensibly
diminished the quiet elation of his young companions, who looked at
each other forebodingly as, with a deep sigh, his uncle continued,
affecting a faintly jocular manner, &quot;Better go to your room,
Torre, and have a wash and a bit of a brush up before the court
opens. It'll be a big trial this time, I expect.&quot;</p>
<p>But, to the surprise of all three, there was no enquiry held as
was usually the case. Only, at dinner, Mrs Bovey's stern features
seemed even harsher and grimmer than ever as she sat next to her
son, whose swelled nose and discoloured eyes presented a notable
contrast to Torre's handsome face, untouched except for a broad
band of diachylon across the forehead where the treacherously flung
stone had left its mark. It was a silent meal, and an uncomfortable
one, made more so from the ill-advised attempts of Mr Bovey to
appear quite at his ease by casting inane little remarks on the
deceptive calm that prevailed. Then, as it suddenly dawned upon him
that perhaps this time he alone was to be the victim, and the
coming night and its inevitable <i>lit de justice</i> cast its
shadow over his soul, he all at once subsided. Towards the close,
however, things livened up a little. Laban Freeman, made bold by
his mother's presence, stretching out under the table, kicked Torre
hard and heavily upon the shin, an attention that the latter
promptly acknowledged by dashing a cup full of hot tea in the
other's face.</p>
<p>&quot;Torre!&quot; exclaimed Mr Bovey in a tone of horror.</p>
<p>&quot;Look what the coward did, uncle,&quot; replied the boy,
pulling up his trousers and showing a nasty red mark on the leg.
&quot;Why can't he fight fairly, or else leave me alone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Even so, sir,&quot; replied Mr Bovey as severely as he
could, &quot;the table is no place to settle your quarrels at. You
had better go to your room.&quot; Torre had risen to leave. But Mrs
Bovey, with an awful smile, remarked, as she got up and signed to
her son, who was roaring with pain and rage, to follow her:
&quot;No, if anybody leaves it must be me and my poor tortured
child. Pray do not disturb your nephew on my account, Mr Bovey. Let
him turn your dining-room into a pigstye, if he likes. Perhaps he
will throw something at me presently. Come along, Labie,
dear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry, uncle,&quot; said Torre, &quot;but it wasn't my
fault. And I'd better go away. You can see it's no use my trying to
live here. It's hard to leave you and Edie, though. I'll go to sea,
uncle, whenever you're ready.&quot;</p>
<p>Torre spoke bravely; but, presently, what with the pain of the
kick and the thought of leaving his uncle and Edie, both of whom he
dearly loved, his lip trembled and the tears rolled down his face.
Then the girl, putting her arms round his neck and her soft cheek
to his, began to cry too, whilst old Bovey scratched his bald head
in perplexity. He was fond of his nephew, and wished much to keep
the lad with him. This, however, he soon saw was a manifest
impossibility. Before next morning he had realised the fact more
strongly than ever.</p>
<p>No one ever knew what he went through during the quiet night
watches, but when he came down to breakfast he looked a ten years'
older man than he had done the day before.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you really made up your mind to go to sea,
Torre?&quot; he asked of the boy later on.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, uncle,&quot; replied Torre, looking up from
&quot;Midshipman Easy,&quot; and certain from the tone of the old
man's voice that his time at Laurustinus Lodge was getting
short.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, uncle. I think I should make a good sailor, and it
seems to be a fine free and easy life, with lots of adventures and
things in it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Umph!&quot; replied old Bovey, doubtfully. &quot;I don't
know much about it. But I should say it was a pretty hard life
myself, with more kicks than ha'pence. Think it over, Torre, my
lad. I can get you a good place in a grocer's business in Plymouth.
There won't be any adventures and stuff of that sort. Still, it's a
good, steady, paying concern. I made money at it. And then, too,
you'll be near me and Edie.&quot;</p>
<p>But the lad's soul revolted at the thought of serving out sugar
and plums, clad perhaps in a white apron, as he had seen the
assistants doing in the very place he knew his uncle had in
mind.</p>
<p>Although he was inland bred, having lived at Wellington under
the shadow of Shropshire's Wrekin, he was not inland born, but, on
the contrary, a son of the sea itself, born on the voyage home from
India, and a love of the sea, although dormant, was instinctive in
him, and needed only opportunity to become a ruling passion.</p>
<p>Yet the two years he had passed within sound of the sea had not
given him any more practical familiarity with the life he was so
eager to follow than if he had seen it for the first time.</p>
<p>Newton Pomeroy boasted a harbour, certainly, but it was a small
one, and strictly in accord with the little coasting trade carried
on there&mdash;a few schooners, slate-laden from Welsh quarries, or
a grimy old brig or two with Cardiff coals, being all there was to
represent the magic and mystery of men's doings in the great deep.
But to Torre, sitting at times on the pier-head, and watching one
of the old tubs transformed by the magic of the moon into a thing
of beauty, her patched sails looking as if they were hollowed out
of great pearls, her rusty sides, chafed rigging, and buckled spars
etherealised by the soft effulgence as she swam slowly along in a
sea of liquid silver, the scene appealed very forcibly, playing on
the natural bent of the boy's mind, filled as it was by a long
course of indiscriminate reading, with a too ready appreciation of
the romantic side of things. And with the romance of the sea Torre
was saturated; dreaming dreams of a wild roving life; of hidden
treasures in lonely wrecks; of &quot;Summer isles of Eden&quot;
peopled by brown men and women, flower-crowned, where tall palms
swayed to the spicy breeze, and the long moan of the breakers on
the circling reef fell faintly on the ear.</p>
<p>But old Bovey only shook his head as Torre enthusiastically
recited whole chapters of Michael Scott and Marryat and Hermann
Melville.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he would reply, &quot;it sounds pretty and
fine. But I doubt there's another side of the story, if somebody'd
only tell it. To my notion, and from the bit I've heard, there's
precious little romance left about a sailor's life, and as for
those tropic smells your writers rave of, why, you'd find it hard
to beat the inside of a big grocer's shop. But there, my boy,&quot;
concluded the old man, &quot;I see you're bent on it, so you shall
have a try anyhow. I've been having a talk with Mr James, whose son
is a sailor. He says the young man served his time in the D. D. and
S. Line; and he also very kindly gave me a note to one of the
owners. So, to-morrow, we'll go up to town and see if we can make
arrangements. According to James, though, it seems a rather
expensive sort of business, this going to sea, what with a premium
and outfit.&quot;</p>
<p>Now that Mrs Bovey and her son had gained the day, the former
treated Torre with the calm toleration of the victor. But Laban,
like the ill-conditioned cub he was, became so profuse in his
taunts, and so triumphant in his rejoicing, that, but for Torre's
wish to avoid making trouble for his uncle, there would assuredly
have been more fights between the pair. As for Edie, she was
inconsolable at the prospect of losing her playmate and protector,
hanging about him and weeping incessantly, until her father said
that she too might come to London and see the last of him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>CHAPTER II<br>
&quot;D. D. AND S.&quot;</h2>
<p>THE office of the Line was in Cornhill, and as Mr Bovey and
Torre entered the long room, many clerks looked up from their books
and grinned comprehendingly whilst the pair were shown into an
inner sanctum where sat one of the partners of the big ship-owning
firm of Messrs Derrick, Deadeye, and Scupper.</p>
<p>The last-named, who received them, was a white-haired, rubicund,
jolly old gentleman, who treated the whole affair as if it were one
of the finest jokes imaginable&mdash;this going to sea.</p>
<p>&quot;Aha,&quot; said he, rubbing his hands together and beaming
on them, &quot;you are just in time. Another week and you'd have
been too late. Now, I can put our young friend into one of our
finest ships at once. And the captain! Well, sir, there are very
few captains like him. He's actually a father to our young
gentlemen. I do assure you that when a vacancy occurs with him, and
it becomes known, we're simply pestered with applications. That's
the vessel, Mr&mdash;ah&mdash;Bovey. What do you think of her,
sir?&quot; And he pointed to a large framed oleograph&mdash;one of
a dozen that hung upon the wall&mdash;representing a noble vessel
tearing along over an intensely blue and white sea, whilst a green
lighthouse forked up over her port bow and a yellow headland over
the other. &quot;That, sir,&quot; continued Mr Scupper,
impressively, &quot;is our A1 clipper ship, the <i>Andromeda</i>,
Captain M'Cutcheon, just entering the harbour of Port Jackson, in
New South Wales.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; replied Mr Bovey, who, with his glasses on, was
scrutinising the picture, &quot;dear me! You don't say so? Yes,
very pretty, I'm sure. She runs the water like a thing
of&mdash;er&mdash;um. Yes, exactly. And then, with a reminiscence
of ships seen at Plymouth long ago, carrying a somewhat similar row
of ports, the old gentleman startled Mr Scupper by demanding
abruptly, &quot;How many guns?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;None, sir, none,&quot; replied the latter, gravely.
&quot;Those painted squares are only for ornament. We're peaceful
traders, you know. And, as the poet says, 'Peace has her victories
as well as war.' Yes; it's a noble profession. That's our
House-flag you see waving from the masthead&mdash;blue ground with
two red D's and an S in it, standing, of course, for Derrick,
Deadeye and Scupper.&quot; Which, by the way, was not the meaning
assigned to those capitals by the 'young gentlemen' of the
line.</p>
<p>It presently appeared that the premium to be paid for the
privilege of sailing as an apprentice&mdash;a word avoided as much
as possible by Mr Scupper, with whom it was all &quot;young
gentlemen&quot; or &quot;midshipmen&quot;&mdash;was &pound;80 for a
term of four years, out of which sum 5s. per annum was to be repaid
to cover cost of washing. For the &pound;80 the firm contracted to
teach the &quot;young gentleman&quot; his profession, feed and
lodge him, doctor him, and in fact do everything they possibly
could except wash for him. Therefore the return of the five
shillings.</p>
<p>Mr Scupper was commendably frank.</p>
<p>&quot;There are,&quot; he said, &quot;firms that charge more
than twice as much per annum, and there are some who charge nothing
at all. But, in the case of the former, their young gentlemen are
let do pretty well as they please, and at the end of their time
hardly know one end of the ship from the other, whilst in the
latter they are allowed to go to the opposite extreme, and, by
consorting with the crew, become quite the reverse of what we
strive to make our&mdash;ah&mdash;midshipmen, that is, officers and
gentlemen.&quot;</p>
<p>This was well delivered. Torre was impressed; so was Mr Bovey.
And the latter, thinking that he could do no better for his nephew,
presently found himself signing an Indenture, and then drawing a
cheque for eighty pounds.</p>
<p>&quot;Nice boy,&quot; said Mr Scupper, paternally pinching
Torre's ear, as the business was concluded. &quot;Shouldn't wonder
if he turns out an honour to the Line. Tell you what I'll do. I'll
give him a note to M'Cutcheon. He lives at Bow. The captain will
advise him about his outfit, and tell him when to be on
board.&quot;</p>
<p>This was kind; and when Torre and his uncle left the office they
both felt as if they had made a friend; whilst Deadeye, presently
entering, remarked to his partner, whose exclusive province the
interviewing was: &quot;Another hard bargain? More trouble than
they're worth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never believe it,&quot; replied Mr Scupper, earnestly.
&quot;They save a man's place. And &pound;80 takes a lot of eating
under the Merchant Shipping Act.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe,&quot; said the other, &quot;but fifty per cent, of
'em never make sailors.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This one will,&quot; replied Mr Scupper, with conviction.
&quot;I've sent him to M'Cutcheon in the <i>Andromeda</i>. A good
captain and a good ship.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bah!&quot; returned the other, &quot;he'd do just as well
in a Geordie brig, and better as an O.S.<sup>1</sup> in any fok'sle
afloat. However, it's your fad. And I suppose, as everybody does
it, we must. But I never cared for the business.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Ordinary Seaman</p>
<p>Deadeye had himself been to sea in the days of his youth.</p>
<p>Torre found Captain M'Cutcheon and his family living in a small
house at Bow, and, presenting his credentials, was looked upon, he
thought, with some curiosity by the Captain and his wife. The
former was a stout, red-cheeked, fair-bearded Scot of about fifty;
the latter, a tall, thin young Englishwoman who nursed a baby, and
seemed delicate.</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay,&quot; remarked M'Cutcheon, as he read Scupper's
note and glanced sharply at Torre's handsome face, &quot;ye'll be
comin' wi' me in the <i>Andromeda</i>. That'll make four o' ye in
the omnibus this trip. I've got a son an' a nephew there too. But
they're auld hands now&mdash;third voyagers.</p>
<p>Outfeet&mdash;ay&mdash;o' course ye'll be needin' one. Best go
to Brown an' Sons in the Minories. They'll tell ye a' that's
necessairy. Be aboord by Monday. There's plenty wants doin'; an'
there's nae mair cats than there's mice to catch. Gude e'en till
ye.&quot;</p>
<p>As Torre took his leave and went out into the narrow little
passage, he thought he heard a feminine laugh, and some reference
that he did not quite catch, to &quot;young
gentlemen-sylors.&quot;</p>
<p>Messrs Brown &amp; Sons Torre and his uncle found particularly
obliging people. There was, it appeared, a stereotyped outfit for
(it was curious how the term would insist on cropping up)
&quot;young gentlemen about to embrace a sea-life.&quot; This was
composed of three suits of uniform&mdash;working suits, suits for
cold weather and suits for hot, white and coloured shirts by the
dozen, caps without number, a revolver in case, with all
accompaniments, a dressing case, toilet soaps, and other articles
&quot;too numerous to mention,&quot; but which filled a big
iron-clamped chest, and were specified by the polite salesman as
being absolutely necessary for all young gentlemen's comfort on
board ship.</p>
<p>Mr Bovey looked astounded as he read the long list and saw the
huge total of the bill.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; he objected, &quot;the boy has plenty of
clothes. Surely some of them would be available at sea?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not unless they're specially made, sir,&quot; replied the
shopman. &quot;The other young gents'd only laugh at 'im if he had
what they call long-shore togs on, sir. All midshipmen, sir, take
one of our outfits. They've got a great name with seamen,
sir.&quot;</p>
<p>Which was quite true, although hardly in the sense the affable
counter-jumper imagined.</p>
<p>One other protest only Mr Bovey made. Seeing an item of
&quot;One dozen best white drill waistcoats, pearl buttons,&quot;
he remarked, &quot;Surely these things are unnecessary for a lad on
board ship?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; was the reply, &quot;quite so. But then
they're not for sea use, sir. Often the young gentlemen on these
crack clippers get invited out, sir, abroad, to swell 'ouses, an' a
white vest looks real nice on an 'ot tropick night.&quot;</p>
<p>This was the old gentleman's last stand. Wishful that Torre
should not be stinted in anything, or be unlike other boys in his
belongings, he submitted to what so many parents and guardians
often submit in the useless and unnecessary spending of scores of
pounds where less than a quarter of the sum would be ample; and in
Torre's case this was the more to be regretted because, by
arrangements at his uncle's second marriage, barring a provision
for Edie at his death, all the old man's fortune went to Mrs Bovey.
At that time the Shrophire Leighs were in flourishing
circumstances, and old Bovey had never imagined any necessity could
arise by which he might wish to provide for his widowed sister and
her boy. More than ever did he feel how foolish those settlements
had been when he saw Torre's few pounds melting away so rapidly,
and knew that without many of the bitter scenes which he dreaded,
he was powerless to make good the shrinkage, as he would willingly
have done, out of his own pocket.</p>
<p>Of course Torre, boy-like, was delighted, especially when his
smart suit of navy-blue cloth with its shining anchor-buttons came
home; and as for Edie, his appearance in uniform for a time, almost
reconciled her to losing him. Neither she nor Torre were aware that
one of the articles of the treaty insisted upon by Mrs Bovey, and
weakly agreed to by her husband, was that Torre should come to
Laurustinus Lodge no more, but stay at London lodgings between his
voyages. This, however, as subsequent events proved, mattered
nothing at all. There was nearly a week for the embryo sailor to
air his new clothes in. And during that time&mdash;the happiest
perhaps of his life, so far&mdash;his uncle took the two children
about to every place of amusement he could think of, despite
impatient letters from Mrs Bovey.</p>
<p>But at last the day came on which Torre had been ordered to
report himself on board, and the three made their way to the
South-West India Docks, where the <i>Andromeda</i> was lying.</p>
<p>After not a little trouble they found her, looking as much as
possible unlike her picture in the Cornhill office. To a sailor's
eye she would have seemed a pretty enough little clipper, although
with promise of proving a wet one. But to their untrained vision
she appeared small and dirty beyond belief, as she lay there, her
decks littered with stores, cargo, and lumber of every description.
Fowls tied in pairs waiting to be cooped and cackling shrilly, pigs
grunting in their sty, masses of vegetables blocking the gangway,
and through all, the angry rattle of a donkey-engine and the shouts
of the lumpers as they received and stowed away cargo, made up a
rather bewildering scene to the visitors.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear me, my boy,&quot; remarked old Bovey, &quot;I hardly
think this can be the ship. Certainly there's the name on her back.
But she's not a bit like the one Mr Scupper showed us. Probably
there are two <i>Andromedas</i>, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now, sir,&quot; said a sharp-spoken, red-whiskered, but
pleasant-faced man in a suit of faded serge, coming up to the party
where they stood on the poop, having made their way on board,
&quot;can I do anything for you&mdash;passengers, I
suppose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, my man,&quot; replied old Bovey, &quot;but I should
like to see the captain, who would doubtless tell us if this is
<i>our Andromeda</i>, and, if so, show us where my nephew's room
is?&quot;</p>
<p>Turning, the man saw Torre's cap with its glittering new band,
and the house-flag worked in silk and gold. Evidently repressing a
strong inclination to laugh, he replied, &quot;Oh, I see, this must
be the new apprentice the captain told me of. I'm the mate. That's
the omnibus, down there on the main deck, where the youngsters
live. And now, my lad,&quot; he continued, &quot;the sooner you get
those togs off and a working suit on, the sooner I'll give you
something to do. I expect you'll find your donkey in the
omnibus.&quot; And the mate rushed away to the hatches, leaving his
hearers quite bewildered.</p>
<p>&quot;Most extraordinary!&quot; exclaimed old Bovey, staring
around. &quot;A donkey and an omnibus! Torre, do you know anything
about the matter? Or is the man mad?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think the omnibus is where I am to live, uncle,&quot;
replied Torre, leading the way towards the little house on the main
deck that the mate had pointed out, &quot;but the donkey's a
puzzler.&quot;</p>
<p>Looking in at the door of the house, Torre caught sight of his
own chest, bulking big in all its bravery of varnish and the bright
black paint of its owner's name, in strong contrast to three other
low-set, rope-handled, bruised and battered, but workmanlike boxes.
Stepping over the tall door-sill, the three entered, and the place
seemed crowded. Mr Bovey glanced about him in dismay. Altogether
there were six bunks, two on each side, one above the other. Two
cupboards and a door took up the fourth side. In the bunks lay
rolled-up mattresses, new and crackling, also bright tin quart-pots
and pannikins.</p>
<p>&quot;What a hole!&quot; exclaimed Mr Bovey.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Torre,&quot; said Edie, &quot;there must be some
mistake, it's only a very little bigger than Carlo's kennel at
home.&quot;</p>
<p>As she spoke a big square-set youngster dressed in a suit of
dirty dungaree and a glengarry cap bundled in amongst them. As his
eye fell on Torre's uniform, he sniffed and grinned, whilst saying
with a strong Scotch accent, &quot;If ye're the new apprentice, the
mate says ye're to start packin' they onions an' carrots awa' under
the boats on the skids. Ye'd better open yer donkey an' pit some
worrkin' claes on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is the&mdash;ah&mdash;room, then?&quot; queried Mr
Bovey, incredulously.</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, this is the 'rume,' sure enough,&quot; replied the
other, grinning more than ever, &quot;where Drive, Distress an'
Starve stows their hard bargains. Dinna ye see the
kists&mdash;donkeys they ca' 'em at sea? An' here,&quot; punching
one of the beds, &quot;is the donkeys' breakfasts. <i>He,&quot;</i>
nodding at Torre, &quot; 'll be one o' Brown an' Sons saxty-five
pund ootfits. <i>His</i> matteras 'll be hair&mdash;ay, I thocht
so. Shavins is just as gude, an' mair eeconomical by a long way.
Ay, ay, sir!&quot; And the speaker, with a yell that made Edie
jump, was off like a shot.</p>
<p>&quot;What a coarse-looking boy,&quot; said Mr Bovey, as Torre,
having unlocked his chest, began to hurriedly turn over its
contents, tossing out uniforms, white shirts and dress-neckties in
the search for something fitted to the business in hand. The
nearest he could find, however, to &quot;worrkin' claes,&quot; just
then, was an Oxford shirt, at seven and sixpence, &quot;as
<i>per</i> account,&quot; and a pair of fine drill trousers with
straps at the bottom for riding, &quot;our own make at fourteen
shillings.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I expect I must get into these, uncle,&quot; said he,
doubtfully. &quot;I don't see any blue things like the other fellow
had on. And I suppose you and Edie had better go. It's no use your
staying now. But I'll come up to the hotel to-night, if I can get
away We sail to-morrow, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>Whilst Mr Bovey and his daughter made their way ashore again,
the old gentleman shook his head more doubtfully than ever as he
said, &quot;Well, Edie, it may be all right. But I must say it's
hardly what I should have expected for the money. I'm afraid, my
dear, that Torre's about to buy his experience too dearly. I ought
to have got somebody who knew to look after him, and enquire into
matters for me. However, I suppose they'll make a sailor of
him&mdash;that's one comfort. But it's an expensive
business.&quot;</p>
<p>Besides the lad Torre had already seen, and who, it seemed, was
the captain's son by a first wife, two others, both Scotch, turned
up at dinner-time. One, Campbell, was about seventeen, the other,
Munro, of nearly the same age; M'Cutcheon was a couple of years
older. And Torre, as they sat and eyed him, passing remarks on his
attire, and grinning at the evident difficulty he found in eating
with his plate on his knees, felt that probably he was booked for a
pretty rough time of it.</p>
<p>Of course there was no table. Torre, on being told that as a
&quot;first voyager&quot; it was his duty, had gone to fetch the
dinner from the galley. There the cook had flung a lump of lean
fresh roast beef and a dozen or so of potatoes, unpeeled, into a
small wooden tub known as a kid. Carrying this to the omnibus, he
had returned for three hook pots, which the cook filled with a
dark, milkless, greasy-looking compound called tea. This, with a
loaf of bread, formed the dinner. Not a very tempting meal perhaps,
but the hearty young appetites left very little remaining for
supper.</p>
<p>Rather to his surprise, Torre was now ordered to wash up the
plates, forks and knives, and to put them carefully away in the
locker or cupboard. He was, it seemed to him, at once installed as
servant to the other three.</p>
<p>Nor that night, when he asked permission of the mate, was he
allowed leave ashore. The <i>Andromeda</i>, too, he learned, was to
go out on the top of the morning's tide, therefore it was quite
possible he would not see his uncle and Edie again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>CHAPTER III<br>
A YOUNG GENTLEMAN-MIDSHIPMAN</h2>
<p>TORRE'S last job was to sweep the decks fore and aft. It was
dark when he finished, and he had then to run sharp for the supper
whilst the other three sat on their chests and looked at him
sourly. So far his day had been a round of ceaseless drudgery. Had
he known how many similar ones were before him he would, likely
enough, have walked ashore and steered due west to the
&quot;Tavistock,&quot; where his uncle was stopping.</p>
<p>At dinner-time he had used a piece of canvas for wiping the
plates with. That had disappeared, and he was at a loss. &quot;Take
one o' yer fine white sarks,&quot; said Campbell, with a laugh.
&quot;It's all the use ye'll ever hae for them.&quot;</p>
<p>In the end Torre was obliged to use a clean new handkerchief,
&quot;best Irish linen at 2s. 6d.&quot;</p>
<p>The three now opened their chests and prepared themselves for
going ashore, there being, apparently, no objection to their doing
so. And Torre was astonished to see the difference in their outfits
and his. Plain suits of blue pilot cloth with bone buttons, knitted
guernseys, and socks and sea-boot stockings, for heavy weather
wear&mdash;dungaree for fine&mdash;flat Scotch caps, and rough
flannel shirts, everything for use, and nothing for ornament.
Perhaps some ten or twelve pounds' worth altogether.</p>
<p>Tired, and feeling dirtier than he had ever done in his life,
Torre made his bed, after a fashion, noticing, as he did so, that
he was the only one who indulged in the luxury of sheets and
pillow-slips. Then, turning in, he blew out the double-spouted oil
lamp that hung from the ceiling, and, whilst feeling very much
inclined to cry, fell asleep and never awoke till a rough hand
shook him, and a rough voice bade him rouse out and go to the
force-pump.</p>
<p>The dawn was just breaking, and already the <i>Andromeda</i>
with a tug ahead of her, was slipping down the river. A chill,
cheerless scene it was, and a cold wind shrilled through the bare
rigging with a hollow harsh note that struck strangely on the lad's
ear as he worked away at the pump-brakes with Munro, whilst the
second mate and some of the men washed the decks.</p>
<p>At Gravesend, he heard some one say, they were to make fast to
the buoys and take powder on board. There, too, the captain and his
passengers would join the <i>Andromeda</i>.</p>
<p>After the decks had been washed down and the usual
breakfast-fetching and scullery business got through, the second
mate, whose name was Phillips, a rough, sulky sort of fellow,
evidently at some time promoted from the forecastle, roared out to
Torre: &quot;Hi, boy, lie aft now, and polish this
brasswork-binnacle, skylight-gratin's, everythin'. Come, sling your
long carcase about, or you'll get shifted!&quot;</p>
<p>Pounded bath-brick and oil were supplied to him by the steward,
a pale, unwholesome-looking man with a pasty fat face, out of which
a great carbuncle of a nose fairly glowed. He spoke with a vile
Glasgow accent, and utterly refused to give Torre any cloths.</p>
<p>&quot;Nae, nae,&quot; said he, &quot;the shep doesna find ye in
ony sic looxurees. Ye maun jist bang aboot for rags o' yer ain.
Brawn an' Co., nae doot, hae providit ye wi' lots o' stuff that's
nae use for aught else ava. Awa' wi' ye noo!&quot; And Torre,
seeing no help for it, tore up one of his shirts to make
&quot;polishers&quot; of. Munro was steering, and the other two
were aloft, busy about something.</p>
<p>As Torre rubbed away at the brass band and boss of the wheel,
Munro asked, &quot;Did ye pay a premium to come to sea,
youngster?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eighty pounds,&quot; replied Torre rather dolefully, as he
looked at his grimy hands and clothes.</p>
<p>&quot;Good Lord!&quot; said the other. &quot;What fools some
folk are, to be sure? Eighty punds for the privilege of bein'
loblolly boy to the sailors!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But surely you paid, too?&quot; asked Torre in
amazement.</p>
<p>&quot;Not one of us,&quot; said the other. &quot;Mair sense an'
less money than ye've got. We're the skipper's apprentices, a'
three of us. First year we got nothin'. Now, this last one, we're
gettin' a pund sterling a month. Pay to come to sea! Not much!
Nobody'll teach ye anythin', here, if they think ye've
money.&quot;</p>
<p>Lamp trimming was Torre's next occupation&mdash;side-lights,
binnacles, riding-lights, the lamps out of the first and second
mates' berth, and his own. And as he sat on the main-hatch
surrounded with these articles, polishing them, cutting their wicks
and filling them with fresh oil, his clothes and hands blacker and
dirtier than ever, the ship arrived at Gravesend; and to his
delight, amongst the first to step on board were his uncle and
Edie, who stared in astonishment as they saw his occupation. Then,
noticing the boy's flush of shame and embarrassment, the old man
said kindly, &quot;They're making you useful, eh, Torre? Can't
begin too soon, you know. I suppose this is only a bit of
preliminary to see what you're made of.&quot;</p>
<p>But Edie was angry, and said, frankly, &quot;Oh, Torre, dear, is
this sailors' work? And look at your hands and face and clothes all
smudgy! Father, won't you speak to the captain about it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's all right, Edie,&quot; said Torre, bravely, but with
a gulp in his throat, &quot;I expect it's what everybody's got to
do when they first come to sea. It isn't nice, certainly. But,
perhaps, it's as well to be able to know how to manage such
matters.&quot;</p>
<p>Not for worlds would he have told them his real thoughts and
feelings, or confessed how his soul loathed these first
experiences, of which, too, something seemed to warn him he had not
yet seen the worst.</p>
<p>The decks were crowded with people; there was no privacy
anywhere. So, presently, Mr Bovey and Edie said good-bye, the
latter kissing Torre heartily before all hands, despite lampblack
and oil. &quot;Good-bye, dear,&quot; she whispered, &quot;I shall
have no one to take my part now against Laban. Oh, Torre, I'll
always think of you and love you. I'll write to Sydney,
and&mdash;and&mdash;&quot; But here poor Edie broke down, and was
led away sobbing by her father, whilst Torre, in not very much
better case, returned to his lamps.</p>
<p>When, or how, the ship eventually got off and down the river,
Torre never knew. He was kept far too busy. All day long it was boy
here and boy there, until his legs were almost too tired to carry
him. He was called to get coals for the cook out of the forepeak;
to help the steward to stow stores away in the lazarette; to feed
the pigs and fowls; in fact, do as much of the menial dirty work of
the ship as one pair of hands could effect.</p>
<p>Off Dungeness the tug left them with a fair wind, and Torre saw
sail made on a ship for the first time; and was taught that his
duty consisted, on such occasions, of pulling and hauling at, and
then coiling up, ropes. That night, on watches being chosen and
set, he found himself in the second mate's&mdash;the starboard
one&mdash;along with Munro, the captain's nephew. The other two
lads were taken by the chief mate.</p>
<p>Munro felt it hard to have a new chum with him, and did not
forget to tell Torre so, after coming down from furling the mizzen
top-gallant sail, where our lad had not been of much use to him. It
was his first journey aloft, and bewildered by the motion, the
height, and the flapping and banging of the sail, he had found it
took most of his time to hold on. Also he lost his cap. In fact,
during the next few days he lost them all, and was obliged to swap
a pair of new boots to Campbell for a glengarry which would not
blow off. Of course this was an imposition, but, as Campbell
remarked drily, &quot;There's a big differ, ye ken, atween sea
prices an' lan' prices.&quot;</p>
<p>So far his companions were not actually brutal towards the
newcomer. But they were very far from kind. Nor did they even
attempt to teach him anything. Indeed, rather the contrary, for if
he asked a question, the probable answer was a jeer, and a scoff to
the effect that gentlemen's sons had no business at sea. Certainly
Torre was unlucky in that his lot should have been cast in company
with specimens of those lower middle-class Scotch boys with regard
to whom it has been popularly said that they serve the same purpose
in the same place as do good intentions. But he had no choice. He
would, however, have done far better as an ordinary seaman in the
forecastle amongst the men, have learnt more, been treated better,
have saved his money, and not been made altogether a scullion and a
rouseabout of. The captain never by any chance deigned to speak to
him. As for the passengers, of whom there were five, they probably
thought it was part of the usual routine&mdash;as it really is,
even in far more important lines than the D. D. and S.&mdash;for
the youngest apprentice to scrub out the officers' berths, feed
pigs, carry coal, trim lamps, be at the nod and beck of the men,
and generally remain in a state of dirt and discomfort, watch in,
watch out. So there was nothing really very unusual or personal to
him, particularly in the menial duties that took up poor Torre's
every minute on board the <i>Andromeda</i>. The other three had
been through it, but without feeling it so keenly, not only because
of constitutional indifference, but by reason of their having all
commenced their sea career together, thus being enabled to divide
the labour. The plain fact of the matter is, that in very many
cases the apprenticing of a boy to the sea is an utter sham, except
in vessels specially devoted to the training of them, and then the
expense is generally prohibitive. And it is nearly time parents and
guardians should know the real state of affairs, and how heavily
they have to pay that their sons and wards may learn the correct
way to clean out a pigstye, trim a lamp-wick, and use a broom and
scrubbing-brush&mdash;all arts, it would seem, absolutely necessary
to the making of an officer in the British Mercantile Marine.</p>
<p>Another thing that embittered Torre's life, as he was living it
now, was the open hostility of Mr Phillips, the second mate.
Although he was careful to keep his hands off the boy, he never
lost an opportunity of using the foulest language he could towards
him. A coarse, rough brute, of a species fortunately becoming rarer
every year, his only aim appeared to be to make the lad like
himself. And as he could neither induce Torre, during this first
probation, to smoke, chew, swear, nor drink, he vowed the youngster
was a softy, and would never make a sailor.</p>
<p>Of course, if Torre had complained to the captain the latter
would probably have interfered. But the lad bore it all silently,
contenting himself with a promise, registered heart-deep, that no
more voyages would he take in the <i>Andromeda</i> if Mr Phillips
was on board her. Often, now, in his watch below, Torre used to
slip into the forecastle, and there some of the men, only too
pleased when they saw how willing the lad was, taught him to splice
and knot; the use of the compass; and to handle a palm and needle.
Fortunately it was some time before this came to the ears of the
captain, who, then, at once stopped these most useful visits, and
gave orders that Torre was to keep to his own quarters when not on
duty.</p>
<p>Still, at every opportunity, the men encouraged and taught him
odds and ends of his profession. They saw that, in spite of all the
disadvantages he laboured under, he loved the sea, and would, in
time, make a sailor. So they took an interest in him, but for
which, during this first passage, he would scarcely have known one
mast from the other. Many boys who have not the faculty for
&quot;picking up&quot; things, and require to have knowledge firmly
but kindly drilled into them before they can hope to comprehend
anything of the vast minuti&aelig; of sea-craft, serve their four
years in hopeless drudgery, are put down, simply from want of a
little teaching, as incurable blockheads, and leave their
profession eminently qualified for a billet as scullion or farmyard
helper.</p>
<p>One of the most distasteful of Torre's many distasteful duties
was, at times, to nurse Mrs M'Cutcheon's baby, for whom, also, he
had to milk a goat every morning.</p>
<p>And still, as has been said, he loved his profession, although
the path to the learning of it had turned out so utterly different
from anything his imagination could have possibly pictured in its
wildest flights. The <i>Andromeda</i>, too, was a fine little
clipper of some 800 tons, composite built, <i>i.e.</i>, wood on an
iron framework, and a &quot;goer.&quot; But she was terribly wet
owing to her length and her lack of beam. Thus for weeks together,
on her main deck, from forecastle-head to break of poop, often
there would be no dry spot visible. She was deep, too, and
M'Cutcheon drove her along for all she was worth whenever he got
the chance. He had a reputation for fast passages, and was always
trying to make records. Also, a believer in studding-sails, just
then going out of fashion as not paying for wear and tear of gear,
he kept the crew box-hauling them about day and night in light
winds.</p>
<p>But when, at odd times, Torre would run out to the
flying-jiboom-end, and, holding on by the royal stay, look in at
the great towering, outstretched mass of snow-white cloths piling
their full and graceful curves, tier above tier, from the big
courses to the tiny skysail reeling against the blue, as the
clipper rose her sharp bows and carried them yearning along before
dropping into the creaming swirl again, he thought that nowhere in
the world could be seen a more gallant or captivating spectacle.
And the sailor's heart of him throbbed with delight as he rose and
fell with the taper spar, standing there solitary, swaying to the
jubilant motion of the beautiful fabric as it came roaring and
foaming at him with that infinite majesty of motion only possessed
by a ship going free, and with everything drawing from the crowning
skysails to the flights of triangular staysails between her masts,
and the stu'nsails reaching far out on either side. This was the
sort of thing that made Torre's soul happy, and compensated for not
a few hours during which, engaged in one or other of his many
squalid occupations, his spirit nearly failed him.</p>
<p>So far, and they were now running their Easting down with the
Roaring Forties and a mountainous sea behind them, nothing had
occurred to break the monotony of the passage. Now three incidents
happened, one at least of which helped to make matters easier for
Torre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br>
THE DEATH OF THE DANE</h2>
<p>&quot;BOY,&quot; said the second mate to Torre one morning, as
the latter was busy feeding the fowls, &quot;jump up and jockey the
gaff, and reeve those signal-halliards. Look sharp now!&quot;</p>
<p>This, perhaps, is one of the most dangerous jobs that can be
given on board ship, even to an old and practised seaman, let alone
a &quot;first voyager.&quot; It meant climbing out some thirty feet
to the end of a swaying spar which, projecting at almost an acute
angle from the mast, has nothing except a few ropes such as vangs,
lifts, etc., to steady it.</p>
<p>Luckily, the captain was near, and, happening to hear the order,
at once put his veto on it, and told the second to send somebody
else.</p>
<p>Looking very ill-pleased, Phillips called a Dane, Svenson by
name, and gave him the errand.</p>
<p>The seaman, an elderly, grizzled, stolid fellow, looked first at
the second mate, then at the spar, and seemed about to make some
remark. But, thinking better of it, he took the end of the
halliards and slowly began to ascend the mizzen-rigging.</p>
<p>It was a bright sunshiny day, and the <i>Andromeda</i>, running
before more than half a gale and showing nothing to it above her
upper topsails, was foaming majestically along over the great
combers, one minute sliding up a rounded glassy slope, the next
settling down with a roaring and hissing of white smother between
the lofty furrows, down, down, till, losing the wind, her topsails
gave a flap, becalmed in that deep ravine. Then, rising once more,
she would hang poised on the very summit of a wave for just so much
time as enabled one to look around before the descent began.</p>
<p>Away on the port quarter was a small barque showing only her
lower topsails, and a forestay-sail to the gale blowing in her
teeth. Evidently she was making pretty heavy weather of it, and
taking lots of water on board. So long did she stay out of sight,
indeed, between the sea-mountains, that those watching oft and
again wondered whether she had not foundered. But always she
re-emerged, thrashing away into the head-sea, the fore part of her
hull hardly discernible for the big masses of spray and foam that
broke over it. From her gaff flew a string of bright flags, the
American ensign on top, giving a needed flash of colour to her
naked spars and rigging as she tossed and stormed like a cork
amongst the vast abysses.</p>
<p>Right aft at the <i>Andromeda's</i> taffrail stood a group of
passengers alternately watching the barque and the flocks of Mother
Carey's chickens and mollyauks which, together with a couple of
huge albatrosses, were fluttering and crying hoarsely in the ship's
wake.</p>
<p>Torre had finished his fowl-feeding. Overhead, Svenson had
succeeded in crawling out to the peak of the gaff, whence, having
rove the halliards, he overhauled them on deck where Phillips was
busy in bending on the &quot;Answering Pennant,&quot; whilst the
captain stood close by with the signal book in his hand.</p>
<p>As Torre looked at the Dane, still clinging to the extreme end
of the spar, the man at the wheel, minding the distant ship more
than his helm, let the <i>Andromeda</i> a trifle up in the wind, so
that a big following comber, in place of breaking under the stern,
hit her a tremendous smack on the quarter, bursting in spray across
the poop and giving the gaff such a sudden violent jerk as shook
Svenson from his precarious hold and flung him rods out to sea. In
a minute all was confusion. &quot;Man overboard!&quot; roared the
helmsman, whilst a passenger cut adrift and flung over two life
buoys.</p>
<p>&quot;Down with your helm!&quot; shouted Phillips, suddenly
losing his head. &quot;Port main braces here, some of you!&quot; he
continued, running for'ard.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep all fast!&quot; thundered the captain to the men as
they raced along the deck. &quot;Up aloft a hand and don't let him
out of sight! Let go your topsail-halliards fore and aft! Clew up
foresail and mainsail! Lively there, my boys! Now then, main and
cross-jack yards round! Let her come! Brace up the foreyard! There,
eediot!&quot; he remarked to the second mate, &quot;that's the way
to heave a ship to! Did ye want to sweep oor decks? &quot;All this
passed in less time than it has taken to tell it; and the
<i>Andromeda</i> lay to, dry enough, but with a tremendous banging
and clattering of canvas up aloft.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Svenson could be seen, as the ship rose, swimming
strongly towards her. Although volunteers to man a boat were in
plenty, it was impossible, so the captain said, to launch one in
such a sea; also the chances were that, encumbered by his heavy
boots and clothing, the man must sink in any case long before help
could reach him.</p>
<p>Every soul in the ship was now standing aft eagerly staring, as
she lifted, towards the black mass of birds that showed the
swimmer's whereabouts. Repeatedly, too, the men urged that a boat
be lowered. But the captain would not hear of it.</p>
<p>&quot;My God!&quot; exclaimed someone presently, &quot;he's
turned, and is swimming away from us!&quot; And in a minute a hail
from the mizzen-royal yard confirmed the fact.</p>
<p>&quot;It's them birds,&quot; said the boatswain, his
mahogany-hued face paling. &quot;They're peckin' oot his een! Hech,
sirs, but yon's a crool sicht! He's better dead! An' him thinkin'
he's mekkin' straight for us?&quot;</p>
<p>A low groan went up from both watches, and the captain and the
mate turned away from the awful scene.</p>
<p>One of the passengers was an Australian squatter returning home;
a tall, stout, big-bearded man, very popular with the crew, to
whom, now and then, he would smuggle forward a bottle of rum, or
fill his pockets with cabin bread for them.</p>
<p>&quot;Good God, men!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;wouldn't it be
better to put him out of his misery. You won't lower a boat,
captain?&quot;</p>
<p>The latter shook his head. &quot;It would only be to lose her
and every man in her,&quot; said he.</p>
<p>&quot;Then,&quot; replied Mr Barker, &quot;if you'll let me,
I'll shoot him. I'm a dead shot. Look! isn't anything before that?
And he may keep it up for hours yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Another low groan arose from the men as they now saw the Dane,
apparently as strong as ever, swimming with one hand, but still in
the wrong direction, whilst with the other he buffeted and struck
at his merciless tormentors, swooping at him with fierce screams,
audible even above the slatting canvas and the rush of the great
seas that at times poured over the fok'sle-head. Without waiting
for an answer to his appeal, Mr Barker ran below, and in another
minute appeared with an express rifle. Putting it to his shoulder,
and waiting for a second of comparative steadiness, he fired. But
the heave of the deck threw his aim out; and in place of hitting
the swimmer, a great albatross soared up and fell back, flapping
the water with broken wings.</p>
<p>&quot;Try again, sir,&quot; said a man.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Mr Barker, his lip twitching with
emotion, &quot;I see I can't make certain on such bad footing. I
may only wound him, and so increase his agony.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why,&quot; exclaimed some one at this moment,
&quot;there's a boat making for him!&quot;</p>
<p>In the excitement of the drama acting out before their eyes,
nobody had taken any notice of the barque. Now, looking round, they
saw that she had shifted her helm and run down on their starboard
quarter. Then, heaving to, had lowered a boat which with six men in
her was pulling swiftly towards the swimmer.</p>
<p>&quot;Hooray!&quot; shouted one of the <i>Andromeda's</i> crew
in a deep salty note, &quot;there's a Yankee Chrischun on board o'
that little hooker! If he'd ha' been with us, we'd not been a
shipmate short, you bet!&quot; M'Cutcheon turned scarlet as he
heard this, and noticed how the passengers glanced askance at
him.</p>
<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; remarked another man, a shaggy-haired,
wild-looking customer, as he pointed to the approaching boat, now,
as it seemed, standing upright on her bows, now sitting completely
out of water on her stern, &quot;an' what'll them brave boys think
on us as wasn't game enough to make our skipper put a boat over?
Oh, the bullies! I'm fair 'shamed to be an Englishman!&quot; And
the fellow brought his shut fist savagely down on the rail.</p>
<p>&quot;Silence!&quot; roared Phillips; &quot;stow that long
tongue of yours!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Silence yerself,&quot; retorted the man, with a nasty look
in his eyes and a hand wandering towards his sheath-knife.
&quot;Silence yerself, ye d&mdash;d greaser! How'd you, or yer
skipper, like to jockey that gaff, now, eh? I reckon ye'd soon be
where poor Hans is.&quot;</p>
<p>The men were greatly excited, and some very free talk was being
indulged in when, all at once, the swimmer, with the boat not more
than a hundred yards from him, suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>&quot;He's gone!&quot; shouted one.</p>
<p>&quot;No, there his head shows again!&quot; roared another,
pointing.</p>
<p>But it was only the black body of a mollyauk; and the barque's
boat was tossing and tumbling over the very spot to which, all
along, the thick flock of birds had directed them.</p>
<p>For awhile they lingered. Then they pulled back towards their
own vessel. As they passed the <i>Andromeda</i> the whole of the
latter's crew tumbled into the fore-rigging, utterly regardless of
orders calling them to the braces, and gave three rousing cheers,
acknowledged by the man at the boat's steering-oar by as many waves
of his sou-wester.</p>
<p>&quot;He'll have a nice job getting his boat aboard again,&quot;
remarked Phillips to the chief officer, as the men, at last, and
sulkily enough, came to the topsail halliards.</p>
<p>&quot;Tshee!&quot; sneered the man who had before spoken,
overhearing this, &quot;there's a sailor got charge of that
ship&mdash;not a soger.&quot; And the mate very wisely took no
notice of the insult to his own captain.</p>
<p>And as they mastheaded their yards, and set their courses, and
brought the <i>Andromeda</i> before the wind, during which
operation she repeatedly filled her decks, they saw that the
stranger had indeed picked up her boat, and that&mdash;significant
fact&mdash;not only were her signals hauled down, but that, when
the <i>Andromeda</i> dipped her own ensign, the Stars and Stripes
stood out motionless to the gale, whilst the brave little ship,
turning her head once more to wind and sea, battered away again
upon her course.</p>
<p>&quot;Bully for 'em!&quot; exclaimed a sailor loudly, as the
starboard watch came aft to get a pull on the crossjack braces.
&quot;She don't want to have nothin' to say to us! An' she won't
bid us good-bye. Wot a flamin' hinsult! But, by God, they're men,
those Yanks!&quot;</p>
<p>This matter lost Captain M'Cutcheon prestige fore and aft,
everyone feeling acutely the slur that the American had thrown upon
the ship by her smart piece of work, unavailing though it had been.
Certainly the captain had acted according to his best judgment and
conscientiously, and nothing more would have been heard of the
affair if the barque had not so completely demonstrated the
possibility of saving the man's life had steps been taken in time.
Actually, the catastrophe in the first place was the result of the
helmsman's inattention. If he had not let the ship fall off and
then brought her to so suddenly, poor Hans would never have been
slung to his doom from the peak like a potato from a stick. And
Torre fully appreciated his own narrow escape from a similar fate;
for, undoubtedly, the captain's interference had saved his life. A
few days after this, another disaster overtook the
<i>Andromeda</i>. Running heavily under her fore and main lower
topsails and a mizzen and fore topmast staysail, she broached to
and swept her decks.</p>
<p>Torre had just turned in when, all at once, the ship seemed to
stand still, there was a sound as of some huge weight falling on
her decks, and she quivered from stem to stern.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; remarked Munro sleepily, &quot;she's taken a sea
on board that time!&quot; And so she had; for, even as he spoke,
the omnibus windows were darkened by a big body of water that made
its way in over the wash-board and through every crevice until the
lower bunks were afloat. Then they felt the ship heel slowly over,
until Torre, in his bunk, had to hang on like a parrot to stop
himself from pitching out across Munro on the opposite side.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; shouted the latter, &quot;she's turning turtle,
and we canna get oot. Lord ha' maircy upon us, puir
sinners!&quot;</p>
<p>Then they heard a terrific banging and thundering of canvas, and
slowly, very slowly, the ship became nearly upright again, the
water cleared away, and the pair, forcing the door open, rushed on
deck.</p>
<p>It was a clear night; but it was blowing a gale. The
<i>Andromeda</i>, who had been running with the sea on her quarter,
was now hove to, head to wind and sea, and making dismal weather of
it. All her topsail sheets had been let fly to stop her from going
over, and the racket was indescribable; whilst green combers rushed
thundering aft along the deck, bursting even into the saloon,
already half full of water. Here and there dim forms came and went
with hoarse cries and shoutings. Torre, hanging to the fife-rail
round the mainmast, looked on for a minute or two bewildered, and
up to his waist in boiling foam. Then, following Munro's example,
he clawed his way aft on to the poop, nearly getting his legs
broken by a harness cask which had washed adrift.</p>
<p>To his utter astonishment he saw the poop swept bare. The wheel
was gone, so were the skylights, binnacle, companion, everything.
Making for'ard again, Torre found one watch clewing up and furling
the topsails, whilst others were getting a tarpaulin ready to lash
in the mizzen-rigging, and sails to cover the yawning holes in the
poop deck where the skylights had stood. Whilst doing his best to
help, he was sent away by the mate to trim and light a riding-lamp
to use with the spare compass.</p>
<p>Not until towards morning did he hear that both of the helmsmen
had gone with the wheel; that the second mate's leg was broken; and
the captain's face badly cut by the hood of the companion.</p>
<p>Desolate and storm-swept, indeed, did the ship look when dawn at
last broke, as she lay to under a storm-staysail forward and the
tarpaulin aft, the only remnants visible of all her huge pile of
fine-weather canvas. Her decks were afloat with a raffle of gear,
spare spars, hencoops full of drowned fowls, pots and pans out of
the galley, seamen's dunnage from the forecastle. Through her
rigging the gale blew with a stern, steady, threatening hum; over
the bows, at intervals, green seas were pouring. The galley fire
was out; and the two pigs who had managed to escape from their pen
were crouched in it. A monstrous grey sea curved its rolling hills
up to a lowering grey sky. It was bitterly cold, for they were in
46&deg; south. Aloft, the slack running gear stood out in bights;
on the yards were heaped sodden masses of canvas. From their davits
the two quarter boats hung in bunches of splintered planks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>CHAPTER V<br>
BROACHING CARGO</h2>
<p>THE fact of the second mate being laid by the heels was a
distinct gain to Torre, who felt but little sympathy for his
tyrant's plight, and hailed live advent of M'Cutcheon junior in
Phillips's place with heartfelt satisfaction.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the <i>Andromeda's</i> crew were not
too well fed. Few sailors' forecastles, even in these latter days,
are noted for plenty, although, undoubtedly, the average quality is
better than of old. But in the <i>Andromeda's</i> case,
unfortunately, Messrs Derrick, Deadeye and Scupper had allowed
Captain M'Cutcheon a lump sum to &quot;find&quot; the crew with.
Consequently the provisions he had been able to provide, and at the
same time make a few pounds for himself, were not altogether what
the Board of Trade might have approved. In fact some of the stuff
came well under the description of</p>
<p class="poem">&quot;High old Gover'ment stores<br>
That had been to war with the Boers,<br>
And sailed the waves to free the slaves on Africa's burnin'
shores!<br>
Game old Gover'ment tack,<br>
That had fought with the Brown and the Black,<br>
And now was agoin' to finish its days in the belly of Merchant
Jack.&quot;</p>
<p>For the first few weeks there had been a lot of growling, but
the majority of the crew, being foreigners, &quot;knuckled
under&quot; submissively&mdash;or appeared to do so, when they,
after one or two remonstrances, perceived the hopelessness of
redress&mdash;and ate their rusty pork, mahogany-textured
&quot;salt-horse,&quot; and frowsy biscuit in silence without
further complaint</p>
<p>&quot;That's the beauty o' Dutchmen,&quot; remarked M'Cutcheon
to his son. &quot;They'll eat maist anythin'! Mind, Jock, when ye
come to be a master, yersel, to always pick your crew of 'em. Gude
sailor-men, too, are they; an', aboon a', they've deegestions like
an ostreedge. See till 'em, hoo weel they've settled doun after the
first grummle or twa! An' ye ken, Jock, that chandler Bobstay's
victual is, as ane micht say, auld.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An' stinkin', an' hard as the hobs o' hell, an' salt as
Lot's wife!&quot; added the acting-second mate with a grin.
&quot;D'ye think I had nane o' it whiles in the omnibus? Ye're not
earnin' an ower gude name for the firm, father; although,
certainly, ye canna mak them a much waur ane than they've gotten
a'ready.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hoots!&quot; exclaimed M'Cutcheon, &quot;less talk out o'
ye! Gang for'ard an' set that fore-topmast stuns'l, shipshape this
time, or I'll disrate ye.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs M'Cutcheon, whose parents kept a butcher's shop in the Mile
End Road, rarely opened her lips to anybody. She was so impressed
by the obligations of her position as the captain's wife, that she
declined to run any risk of compromising it by the slightest
appearance of familiarity with the officers or
apprentices&mdash;even though her stepson was now one of the
former. So, beyond a sharp admonition now and then as to the manner
in which he was to hold the &quot;biby&quot; she was too lazy to
nurse herself, and for which her husband was too mean to hire a
maid, Torre gained nothing by this, his most hated duty of all.</p>
<p>The loss of three able seamen had so grievously weakened the
<i>Andromeda's</i> crew, however, that presently Torre found
himself gradually being made more use of. He learned to take his
trick at the wheel, represented, since the smash, by four
hand-spikes lashed crossways to the boss of the tiller. Also, he
was aloft much more than formerly; and the fowls being dead, and
the pigs slaughtered, rendered further services towards them
unnecessary. Even on the coarse fare supplied in the omnibus or,
perhaps, actually because of it, and an ever sharpened appetite,
the boy grew stronger and stouter in amazing fashion. Still, as a
&quot;first voyager,&quot; to his share fell all the most dirty and
disagreeable work of the ship, together with the uncomfortable
knowledge that, unless changes took place in the <i>personnel</i>
of the omnibus, the next trip, and possibly the next alo, might
find him still the latest comer, and still doomed to the menial
servitude of fetch and carry, rub and polish, dragging coals, and
feeding and cleaning stock. And the idea troubled the boy not a
little.</p>
<p>One night, emboldened by the settled look of the weather, and
the fine breeze that sung so steadily after her, the second mate,
perhaps thinking to surprise his father, loosed and set the double
fore, main, and mizzen topgallant'sls, under which increased area
of canvas the ship tore along with her lee-rail at times almost
level with the water, and a sound aloft as if a whole gale was now
booming in the bellies of the fresh sails.</p>
<p>It was four bells&mdash;ten o'clock&mdash;in the first watch.
And though heartily wishing he had left well alone, young
M'Cutcheon determined to carry on until twelve o'clock before
taking the extra canvas off her. But in about another hour the wind
increased to such an extent that, even to his eye, it became
manifest that, if he did not at once reduce the pressure on his
spars, he would lose some of them. To add to his trouble, the mate,
aroused by the increased list, and the sound of rushing water
outside his cabin door, came on the poop and, after calling him all
the Scotch idiots he could think of, ordered him to at once turn
the hands up and shorten sail.</p>
<p>Torre was sent to rouse out the watch below. To his surprise
there was a light in the forecastle, and not only the watch below
but the one on deck were there. A light was burning, too; and some
one was singing a song.</p>
<p>But at Torre's summons the lamp was dowsed, and the crowd
stumbled out on deck. By this time the upper topgallant yards were
on their caps, with the canvas wildly flapping and
banging&mdash;the apprentices having let go the halliards.</p>
<p>As soon as they appeared, Torre perceived at once that both
watches were hopelessly drunk. There was not a sober man amongst
them. Some one let go the upper fore-topsail halliards, and some
one the main. Losing their footing, the men skulldragged about in
the lee scuppers amongst the water, whilst Mr Sinclair, the chief
mate, roared like a bull at them, enforcing his words with oaths
and kicks. But they only jeered at him. Very quickly now, the
captain came on deck, just in time to see three of the topgallant
sails laughing at him through ominous and ever-widening rents.</p>
<p>Of course they put the helm up and kept away, but too late to
save the canvas. And the scene, with the crew helpless, or only
just sensible enough to be mischievous in letting go things that
should be kept fast; the whipping and slatting of the ragged sails
aloft; the shouts of the passengers, who had volunteered to assist
when they learned how matters stood; together with the bawling of
the drunken seamen, and the fall inboard of big seas at intervals,
was something to remember. As for the captain, he just stood and
&quot;swoor at lairge&quot;; whilst, with the help of the
sailmaker, carpenter, cook, steward, and apprentices, after hours
of hard work the ship was snugged, and once more kept on her
course.</p>
<p>At daybreak the fore-hatch was taken off and an exploring party
sent below. Their report again brought M'Cutcheon himself on the
scene. The <i>Andromeda</i>, not being a full ship, one could walk
almost erect over the cargo fore and aft. And the havoc that had
been played with the latter was terrible. Cases of tinned meats,
fish, milk, biscuits, sweets, vegetables, etc., etc., lay almost
everywhere in dozens and scores, all partially or wholly emptied.
Apparently, however, the cargo-broachers had only within the last
day or two succeeded in finding spirits; for though there were lots
of rifled casks of bottled Lager beer, whose effect upon such
seasoned stomachs would be about equal to toast and water, only a
couple of cases of strong drink were broken into. These contained
Marie Brizard rum of the finest quality, mild but strong, and were
evidently accountable for the fiasco of the preceding night.</p>
<p>This morning the men stood sulkily about, watching the boatswain
and his aides as they kept adding to the pile of
&quot;empties&quot; gradually accumulating on deck. Nothing had
been thrown overboard. And at this the mate was inwardly jubilant.
For missing cargo he would have been held responsible. But here was
proof as to the correctness of his tally in London. The men knew
this as well as he did. But Mr Sinclair was rather a favourite.</p>
<p>At last the tale seemed complete. It reached from galley to
forecastle-head, packed high as the bulwarks&mdash;all cases and
casks that had contained eatables or drinkables. Boxes of
jewellery&mdash;gold and silver watches and chains&mdash;and
clothing had been opened, but fastened carefully down again with
their contents untouched. The men had been foraging for empty
stomachs, not for their pockets.</p>
<p>The passengers stood by, rather interested. They had more than
once been in the forecastle at meal times. And more than once had
conveyed saloon remnants thither under cover of darkness.</p>
<p>&quot;If I were to put such stuff on the table of my men's hut
at Ngori, they'd throw it to the dogs!&quot; had exclaimed
Barker.</p>
<p>He was the only returning Australian. The other four were more
or less unhealthy young persons taking the round voyage for their
bodies' sake. And they all watched curiously as the red face of the
captain grew redder and redder, and his thick apoplectic neck
visibly swelled and rolled over his shirt collar whilst he tried
vainly to control his passion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, both watches, port and starboard, looked on
apparently without interest, puffing at their pipes, but showing in
their unsteady limbs, unkempt hair, salt-sodden faces and bloodshot
eyes very plainly the result of their late debauch&mdash;an
unsavoury enough seeming crowd, in proportion of three foreign to
one British. At last M'Cutcheon turned to them.</p>
<p>&quot;D'ye see yon?&quot; he asked, sternly pointing to the
pile.</p>
<p>Some one laughed; and a German replied defiantly, &quot;Yah! und
ver good dey vos. Mein Gott, subbose ve no ged 'em, ve die mit
sdarvation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>I'll</i> starve ye, ye meeserable villain!&quot; burst
out the captain furiously. &quot;I'll see that ye'll get what ye've
been workin' for&mdash;sax months' hard labour in Darlinghurst, the
meenit we reach Sydney. Nae satisfied wi' my gude victuals, ye must
gang awa an' brak cargy to fill yer tarry bellies wi'! Ma
conscience! but I'll work ye up, lads, for this bit spree! I'll tak
it oot o' ye! I'll let ye ken that Jock M'Cutcheon's na to be jokit
wi' in sic fashin' as ye've been attemptin'! I'll stap yer ploys
frae this oot&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, give us a rest,&quot; interrupted a sailor, &quot;an
talk English. Why, yer wuss nor a bloomin' Dutchman yerself! If yer
hadn't starved us on yer blasted old stores, which was part o' the
same lot as was in the <i>Hark</i> when she run ashore, why, we'd
ha' left yer cargo alone. Git out, ye bloomin'
sailor-killer!&quot;</p>
<p>As M'Cutcheon stood, actually gasping at this salute, another
man took up the parable. Altogether a superior sort of customer,
this, who spoke with a rather refined accent, and who, in spite of
the traces of the recent &quot;spree,&quot; was evidently a smart
and fairly educated seaman&mdash;probably a mate forced to ship
before the mast, as so many certificated men have to do in these
days.</p>
<p>&quot;Look here, Captain,&quot; said he, &quot;there's not the
least doubt we've done wrong (M'Cutcheon snorted angrily), and that
you can get us six months in Sydney gaol, if you like. But I, for
one, know Sydney well. And I also know Captain Brown, of the Marine
Board, and other folk who have to do with seafaring matters. And I
think, when we show the Magistrate specimens of the stuff you've
been trying to feed us on, that, if he doesn't say at once this
business serves you right, he'll, anyhow, let us off easy. Also I
have friends, journalists in the City, and I'll take care that a
fair sample of our rations goes to each of their offices. I suppose
you know what that means? We may go to gaol, Captain, but you'll
get such a showing up as you'll remember all your days, I can tell
you that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ye scoondrel,&quot; roared the Captain, shaking his fist
at him, &quot;so ye're the ringleader! A broken man, maist likely,
wi' a met's or, mebbe, a skipper's certeefiket in yer kist. Pit the
airns on him, bo'sun, an' bring him aft. I'll hae no domd
sea-lawyers runnin' loose aboord ma ship.&quot;</p>
<p>But as the boatswain advanced, dangling a pair of great rusty
handcuffs, a dozen sheath knives flashed out and he stopped short.
Three of the men, too, who had rushed into the forecastle, appeared
handling revolvers as if they knew how to use them. The passengers,
except Barker, beat a hasty retreat aft. The cause of the
demonstration alone remained unmoved, smoking calmly, and leaning
against the windlass.</p>
<p>But, presently, throwing his pipe overboard, he said, &quot;Put
those things up, boys, or they'll be calling it mutiny, or some
such rot. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the Old Man don't
think it's something of the sort already, to judge by his looks.
I'm perfectly willing to go aft&mdash;if he'll only lock me up in
the store-room.&quot; And so saying, he advanced and offered his
hands for the cuffs, and was led away, and confined in a spare
berth next to the second mate's.</p>
<p>&quot;Now then, lads!&quot; exclaimed Mr Sinclair briskly,
seeing that the skipper, whose empurpled face had become mottled
with white patches at the sight of so much cold steel, remained
silent, &quot;Now then, lads! Turn to and get all that stuff below
again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is the skipper goin' to give us that six months chokee
when he gits to Sydney?&quot; asked one.</p>
<p>&quot;<i>Oui</i>,&quot; chimed in a Frenchman angrily, &quot;is
it dat ve come to ze preezon <i>parce que</i> ve veel our
<i>estomacs</i>, zat 'e sall kip, vat you call 'im, hempty?
<i>Sacre nom</i>! 'E is von big vool if 'e tink ve vork no more
only for preezon!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's it, Frenchy,&quot; confirmed the first speaker, as
low polyglot growls of assent went around. &quot;Is we to go to
gaol in Sydney?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the captain, having got over his
momentary qualm, &quot;an' for as long as I can mak' them gie it
ye.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then sail yer cussed ship there!&quot; answered the man,
turning and entering the forecastle, followed immediately by the
rest of the crew.</p>
<p>Then ensued a curious state of affairs. The men's food was
stopped. But they did not seem to mind. The weather was very cold,
and it could be seen that with a couple of oil drums they had
constructed a sort of stove in the forecastle, fed, of course, by
coals of which, from the situation of the fore-peak, they were
enabled to procure any quantity. New sails ought to have been bent
in place of the three topgallant sails; but in the prevailing heavy
weather, and with so few hands, this was out of the question. Also,
the captain and his mates had to take their trick at the wheel.
Running as the <i>Andromeda</i> was, with a high following sea, it
was not safe to trust an apprentice to steer alone; so, what with a
man at the lee-wheel, now and again, intervals were short between
wheels and look-outs. Indeed, it was almost trick and
tie,<sup>1</sup> especially o' nights. Thinking it safer to get his
lower topgallant sails off, the skipper had them stowed, a task
that gave his scratch crew all they knew how to perform; for,
considering her size, the Andromeda's sails were very heavy. She
could have carried them, and the other ones too, easily just then.
And the passage was being spoiled,&mdash;a maddening reflection to
M'Cutcheon, and one that prevented him from taking the upper
topsails and mainsail off his ship, as he might have yet done in
time. Whilst the apprentices and the boatswain, sailmaker and
carpenter, etc., were at work aloft, the men lounged about for'ard,
smoking, and freely criticising the proceedings. What they were
living on puzzled the captain.</p>
<p class="note"><sup>1</sup> From wheel to look-out and back again
without a rest.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm thinkin', Mr Sinclair,&quot; said he, &quot;that we'll
hae to search the fok'sle. They must ha' proveesions hid there.
They canna get at the cargy again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; replied the mate; &quot;I was down to-day,
and nothing's been disturbed. They won't pick that new lock on the
hatch very easily. I suppose they have a store of stuff hidden away
under their bunks, or somewhere. They may have foreseen and
provided against their supplies being stopped.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you insist on searching their quarters there'll be
bloodshed,&quot; remarked Mr Barker bluntly. &quot;And,
Captain,&quot; he added, &quot;I speak for the rest of the
passengers when I say that some arrangement should be come to. We
don't want to spend more time than can be helped pottering about
the Southern Ocean in this style.&quot;</p>
<p>The skipper looked at him dourly. He himself was getting very
tired of taking so active a part in working the ship. But he had
been robbed, scared, and defied by his men, a matter he could in no
way make up his mind to stomach. If he could but sight a warship!
But, as he knew, few of them had any business in these latitudes.
Well, at all risks, he must try and manage, at least as far as
Adelaide. Yes, the latter port for choice! Reflection had told him
that his prisoner might, as he promised, make matters uncomfortable
for him in Sydney. He had seen a specimen of ships' stores produced
in a Colonial police court once before, and the accompanying
comments had been unpleasant to listen to. But he saw no way out of
his present dilemma.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, baby and brasswork, alike, were neglected in these
days, so far, at least, as Torre was concerned. He was kept, like
everybody else, constantly going about other business.</p>
<p>As Mr Sinclair guessed, the men had a reserve of food. But this
was getting low, and indeed they were anxiously considering the
advisableness of helping themselves by force, when what might have
been foreseen happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br>
OF A BABY AND A POT OF PAINT</h2>
<p>SUDDENLY, during the last hour of the middle watch, the wind
which had blown so long and so steadily either on the quarter or
right aft, hauled abeam, and thence dead ahead, hardening into a
gale before Mr Sinclair could even get his yards braced for'ard.
And presently, the <i>Andromeda</i> began, with so much sail upon
her, to make tremendously bad weather of it. Foresail, mainsail,
and upper topsails must come off her or the masts must go. Already
the tough Kauri pine sticks were buckling like fishing rods, whilst
big seas in ceaseless procession broke high above her bows and
rolled six feet deep to the saloon doors, and over them, swamping
the whole place for the second time that passage.</p>
<p>In the forecastle the men lay in their bunks smoking, and
staring stolidly at the bubbling seething water as it flowed in and
out. Here the din and riot were indescribable as the ship lifted
her bows to the shock of the waves that made her reel and stagger
as they hit her, first on one side then on the other, or bounded
over her in foaming cascades of greenness, whilst she buried
herself until she hid the clew of the foretopmast staysail.</p>
<p>Aft stood the captain and the passengers, amongst the latter of
whom Barker was the only one who understood the full gravity of the
situation.</p>
<p>With her swept poop where, over the apertures left by the
missing skylights, spare sails had been fastened; rude wheel,
meat-safe instead of shining binnacle, and what brasswork was left
around the mizzen green with verdigris, the <i>Andromeda</i> looked
like a craft that had already suffered shipwreck. Aloft, too, the
roughly stowed sails lay in shapeless heaps upon the yards, ropes
blew out in curves to the wind that roared with the voice of a
thousand bulls into the cavities of the great courses, threatening
every moment to tear their tacks and sheets out of the deck, now
nearly waist high in water fore and aft.</p>
<p>Very grim looked M'Cutcheon as he watched his straining spars
and labouring ship.</p>
<p>&quot;For twa preens,&quot; muttered he at length, &quot;I'd up
hellum an' rin awa before it.&quot; And he tugged at his beard
vigorously.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Captain,&quot; said Barker, who had been conversing
with his fellow passengers, and felt that the time had now come to
&quot;talk straight,&quot; &quot;this is a losing game you're
playing. Nor does it suit us. And it's all your own fault. If you'd
fed your men properly they wouldn't have broached the cargo.
However, Mr Sinclair tells us that the outside value of the stuff
consumed is about &pound;100. And, although by rights the loss
should come out of your pocket, still, to get clear of this most
uncomfortable ship, we are willing to subscribe the amount amongst
ourselves, provided you agree to give up any idea of prosecuting
the men.&quot;</p>
<p>Now Mr Barker was, as the Captain knew, not only a very wealthy
man, but a man possessing a good deal of influence in Sydney; thus
his plainly stated view of the case rather staggered him. For a
minute he tried to stand on his dignity and assert himself. But the
attempt was a failure; and, with a bad enough grace, he gave in,
saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>&quot;Weel, it's hard to hae sic a crowd o' thieves get the
better o' me. An' but for ye passengers, an' the wife an' bairn,
I'd jist hang it oot till a' was blue!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just so,&quot; replied the squatter drily, &quot;but I
have business awaiting me in Sydney, and I can plainly see that, if
you don't do something, we'll either have the ship dismasted, or
worse; possibly the crew taking charge into the bargain. Better let
Mr Sinclair go and tell them that&mdash;or stay, I'll have a talk
with that man in the lock-up. The best plan will be, then, to let
him go to his shipmates.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do what ye like, sir,&quot; replied M'Cutcheon, sulkily
enough, &quot;as ye've got the whole thing planned oot, ye may as
well feenish it.&quot;</p>
<p>So, presently, after a few words with Eastmore, the prisoner, Mr
Barker sent him for'ard; and in a short time the men could be seen
wading about, and so obviously waiting for orders, that Mr Sinclair
very soon had them at work clewing up the main-sail and snugging
the <i>Andromeda</i> down to her lower topsails.</p>
<p>The head-wind only lasted twenty-four hours before drawing aft
again as suddenly as it had shifted at first; and then, to make up
for lost time, the Captain piled the canvas on until the log showed
thirteen, and the noise of her going was like that of an express
train with the rattle and the roaring of it.</p>
<p>In this southerly weather, spite of his expensive outfit, Torre
could not find enough clothes to keep himself warm. Thin merino
underclothing in place of good honest stout flannel, and blue serge
instead of pilot cloth, all undoubtedly the best of its kind, but
more suitable for Singapore or Calcutta than the lee-side of a poop
or on a royal yardarm in forty-five South latitude. But of his
stock of fine clothes, actually, by this time, little remained
except a few suits of uniform which he never, so far as he could
see, would have a chance to wear. His dress waistcoats and white
and fancy shirts had been either swapped away for something warm
and useful in the shape of flannel under-vests and drawers and
woollen comforters, a &quot;backed&quot; waistcoat, canvas
trousers, or similar articles that would stand wear, or been
converted, along with his sheets, into lamp-cleaners and
brasswork-polishers.</p>
<p>As to any attempt that was ever made to teach him something of
the science of navigation, he might as well have been in the
forecastle itself. Now peace reigned on board once more&mdash;once
more it was &quot;biby&quot; and brasswork; scrubbing, coaling, and
waiting on his messmates. Also Phillips was fast getting well
again, his leg having made a good cure.</p>
<p>Horribly tired was poor Torre of that slobbering crying mite of
Scotch-Cockney humanity who seemed to delight in pulling his hair
or digging its fingers into his eyes as he, often in vain, strove
to soothe its querulous shrieks, whilst its mother watched him from
her lounge chair. The boy, too, felt it an indignity thus to be
made into a nurse, and often his wrath and shame were near getting
the better of him. One day they actually did so. The
&quot;biby&quot; had been more than usually fractious; and its
mother had spoken sharply to Torre before the passengers and the
grinning man at the wheel, until the lad's face burned again, and
bitter tears forced themselves into his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Chucka dam biby all overboard an' see heem swim-a,&quot;
whispered the helmsman, a Greek with whom, as with the rest of the
crew, Torre was a prime favourite.</p>
<p>But the lad felt no animosity towards the child, and redoubled
his vain efforts to keep it quiet. The captain, surly and
ill-tempered, as he always was now, happened just then to come on
deck, and disturbed by the shrill yells of the infant, flung an
oath at Torre as he passed him, bidding him at the same time, to
&quot;stap the bairn fra greetin'.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;E's doin' it a purpus, John,&quot; complained Mrs
M'Cutcheon from her seat. &quot;Nothin' 'll mike me believe but
what he's pinchin' of the little dear. It's always the best o'
bibys when I've got it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then,&quot; said Torre suddenly and desperately, as he
stepped forward and put the child on her lap, &quot;take it, ma'am,
and keep it. I didn't come to sea to learn how to nurse. My uncle
paid &pound;80 for me to learn my profession. My indentures said
nothing about nursing babies. And I'll do no more of it.&quot; And
turning, he walked off the poop, leaving the parents struck dumb
with astonishment, the passengers laughing in pleased approval, and
&quot;Jack the Greek&quot; swearing jubilantly in soft sibilant
whispers to himself. Ten minutes afterwards Torre could be seen,
suspended in a bowline, far away aloft, tarring down the main-royal
stay. But during the remainder of his short term on the
<i>Andromeda</i>, although they hazed the boy by keeping him in a
continual plaster of tar and grease, he was never again told to
&quot;get a wash and a clean shirt, and go and take the
baby.&quot;</p>
<p>It was on the ninety-fifth day from leaving London that the
<i>Andromeda</i>, one beautiful forenoon, entered the Heads of Port
Jackson in tow of the <i>Commodore</i>. But of the scenery of the
world-famed harbour, Torre saw nothing as, until the ship berthed,
he was inside a four hundred gallon bread-tank, handing bucketfuls
of evilsmelling, broken-up biscuit through the man-hole to the
second steward, who emptied them to the Port Jackson sharks. The
skipper was getting rid of the remnant of forecastle stores; and
the tugboat men grinned as they saw the clipper's muddy brown wake;
and made uncomplimentary allusions to the House-flag, and
&quot;limejuice hookers,&quot; that should have caused M'Cutcheon's
ears to tingle.</p>
<p>Thus, when Torre, wet through to the skin, and half-choked,
emerged from his prison, the <i>Andromeda</i> was abreast of Fort
Denison, and turning in for Circular Quay.</p>
<p>Of course the passengers went ashore at once; the health-seekers
rapturously glad to be rid of their physician, and swearing that
the biggest mail steamer afloat would hardly be big enough to hold
them for the return trip, although M'Cutcheon gently hinted at a
possible forfeiture of passage money if such a thing should happen.
But they laughed him to scorn. They would sue Derrick, Deadeye and
Scupper for sending them with a man who not only nearly wrecked the
ship and condemned them to a miserable existence by lamp light;
but, into the bargain, almost made the crew mutiny by his greed,
thus costing them &pound;20 each! They'd see all about it! They'd
talk to the agents! Besides, the owners had said seventy days at
the outside! And here were ninety-six! And, too, they had been fed
in a most beastly way, considering the amount of passage money,
etc., etc. And so these young men, having arrayed themselves in a
new suit apiece, with linen like proof armour reaching from
fingertips to ear-lobe, and tanned boots of the latest fashion;
after giving the captain a bit of their mind, hung silver-mounted
crook-sticks over their arms, turned up the bottoms of their
trousers, and marched ashore to explore &quot;The Kawlinies,&quot;
leaving the skipper in a decidedly uncomfortable state.</p>
<p>But Barker only laughed. &quot;I don't expect you'll ever see or
hear of 'em again,&quot; said he. &quot;The trip's done them a lot
of good. But they won't go back with you. I wouldn't myself, in
their place. The <i>Andromeda's</i> no passenger ship. Take my
advice, Captain, do without 'em, and advise the firm to. Also,
don't be so fond of foreigners. And, in any case, feed your men
better, or I'll be hearing of you in trouble one of these days.
Well, so long!&quot;</p>
<p>Before this, the squatter had told Torre, to whom he had taken a
great fancy, especially since the nursing incident, that if ever he
wanted a friend he'd find one at Ngori.</p>
<p>&quot;Bourke's the town. Station's twenty miles away. I don't
suppose you'll ever find your way there, as you're indentured for
four years to this low-down firm. Still, one never can tell,
especially in this country, the curious fashion in which extremes
may meet. So don't forget, my boy&mdash;John Barker, Ngori, Bourke.
It's a far cry from here&mdash;over 500 miles. Still, as I say, one
never knows.&quot;</p>
<p>Captain M'Cutcheon, once his sails were unbent, lost no time in
offering his crew their discharges; which they accepted to a man.
The usual paragraphs about the passage had appeared in the shipping
news of the daily papers&mdash;curt matter-of-fact notices copied
from entries in the log book, and furnished by the skipper himself.
But he had some knowledge of the dreadful rapacity of the reporter
for anything sensational; and he feared the man Eastmore might be
tempted to give a full account of the whole business, not only of
his failure to attempt the rescue of the Dane, but of the cargo
broaching and the cause of it. In which case he knew at least three
newspapers who would serve it up to their readers in columns with
all the pomp of displayed headings and &quot;leaded out&quot; type.
Therefore, it seemed good to him to pay off the crew at once
almost, giving them at the same time, ignorant that he was
compounding a felony, a gentle reminder that, if they did not hold
their tongues about the cargo, Darlinghurst gaol might still be
their end. Of the passengers he had no dread. Barker had promised
that he would keep their mouths shut. And, although in this case,
unknown to the captain, the squatter had done the same by Eastmore.
The fact was, that Barker, in the first place, above all things,
hated publicity of the kind a Sunday paper or a weekly free-lance
would bestow on him as a local and well-known man; and that, into
the bargain, the agents of the <i>Andromeda</i>, Messrs Moore,
Devine and Co., were personal friends and customers of his own.</p>
<p>In harbour it is the custom on almost all vessels of any size or
reputation, to have an apprentice at the gangway to give
information to visitors, or to warn loafers away. This post is
generally taken in turn, and is looked upon as a welcome break in
the usual routine. But when Torre's turn came, and, for the first
time since joining, he had arrayed himself in his uniform, he was
brusquely told by Phillips, now about again, albeit with a crutch,
&quot;to come out o' that, and get aloft and scrape down the
mizzen-royal mast.&quot;</p>
<p>The Captain was standing close to, and for a moment Torre
thought of appealing. But, just then, catching M'Cutcheon's eye, he
saw that such a course would be worse than useless; realised, too,
that by his refusal to nurse the baby, he had made the
<i>Andromeda</i>, henceforth, a harder home than ever for himself;
and that between the second mate and the captain his life would
hardly be worth living. But he set his teeth resolutely, and
yielding his place to Munro, went into the omnibus, threw off his
useless finery, and shinned aloft with a scraper round his neck and
a feeling of bitter resentment at his heart.</p>
<p>A few days after this, being ashore on an errand, he met
Eastmore, so well dressed and so smart-looking that Torre hardly
knew him. &quot;Well, how's the baby now?&quot; said the sailor
laughing. &quot;I suppose they'll haze you a bit for that mutiny of
yours, eh? Why, it was a lot worse than our little shine. You ought
to leave that ship, Leigh. You'll never do much good in
her&mdash;especially as that brute Phillips is on his legs
again.&quot;</p>
<p>With all this Torre cordially agreed. And when Eastmore said
that he was going to give up the sea for a time and take a billet
that had been offered him in the country, the boy at once asked if
he could not go with him. But Eastmore would not hear of it.
&quot;No,&quot; said he, &quot;it's no use breaking your indentures
in that fashion, and probably forfeiting the premium. Suffer it,
and sit tight till you get home; and then insist on a shift to
another ship. You can't change for the worse. And if you've any
friends, why, just let them give the owners a hint that you didn't
pay &pound;80 to be made a general servant of. You'd be better off
in every way as an ordinary seaman in a fok'sle. That is, if you
must stick to the sea. You bet, I wouldn't use it myself if I could
help it! But, worse luck, I can't keep away from it altogether.
I've left good billets to go back to such picnics as we had on this
trip. Well, so long, youngster. Keep a stiff upper lip and you'll
pan out all right yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Eastmore was a good-looking man of about thirty-five, or so; one
of those amongst the <i>Andromeda's</i> crew who had always been
foremost in offering to show Torre anything he could. And, as the
boy watched him move off amongst the crowd, that same upper lip
quivered ominously, and he had half a mind to throw down the parcel
he was carrying and run after Eastmore and entreat again to be
allowed to accompany him. But, by an effort, restraining himself,
he went on board the ship, the very sight of which was becoming
hateful to him.</p>
<p>Next morning he was ordered aloft to paint the crossjack yard.
He took with him a large heavy pot of paint, and, making it fast by
its lanyard to the jackstay, he commenced on the starboard yardarm
and worked inboard. Presently, the second mate limping along,
looked up and shouted &quot;Hi, you little devil, you've left a
couple o' 'holidays' there already. If I could only get to you, I'd
shove the brush down your throat! Wait&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>But, here, the lanyard of the big paint pot either worked itself
out of the clove hitch by which it was fastened, or carried
away&mdash;Torre never knew how. And as he gazed down at the hated
face with its fringe of coarse black whisker, and the piggish eyes
so much too close together, he suddenly saw a thick white stream
descend and completely blot the features out, followed a second
later by the heavy pot which, hitting the second mate fairly on top
of the poll, levelled him to the deck.</p>
<p>Luckily there was nobody about. The sail-maker and carpenter
were at work for'ard, and the other apprentices scraping iron-rust
below. For a minute Torre hesitated, then, having made up his mind,
he ran in, slipped down a backstay, and jumped ashore just as Mrs
M'Cutcheon, emerging from the companion, stood staring in
astonishment at the sight of the second mate who, sitting up, was
spitting paint out of his mouth and vainly striving to scrape his
eyes clear of it, whilst from a cut in his head blood flowed
plentifully and mixed with the white plastering on his hair.</p>
<p>Like a dingo Torre doubled amongst the lumpers and cargo that
littered the quay, and running past the Sailor's Home, presently
found himself through the Argyle Cut and nearly abreast of the
Observatory. Here he steadied, and coming to one of those steep
streets that lead to the waterside at short intervals all along
this part of Sydney and form a <i>cul de sac</i> with wharves at
the far end, walked swiftly down it.</p>
<p>At the foot of it jetties ran out, and alongside them lay
steamers busily taking in and discharging cargo. Finding he was
blocked to right and left, Torre scuttled up the gangway of the
first boat he came to. Her decks were crowded with people; steam
winches were rattling; 'scape pipes roaring; noise and confusion
everywhere. Glancing back towards the street, he caught sight of
M'Cutcheon junior and the carpenter coming along at a trot. In
desperation he slipped into the empty forecastle and crawled under
one of the lower bunks. Another few minutes and he heard bells
ringing; then, after a pause, he felt the vessel slowly moving,
whilst the sound of cheering fell on his ears. Evidently the
steamer was under way. But Torre never stirred. Another hour, and
some men entered; plates and knives and forks clattered; a smell of
beefsteak and onions filled the place; and a voice that sounded
familiar remarked, &quot;We're passin' the Sow an' Pigs. Larst time
I seen 'em, a week or two agone, I wos in a bloomin' limejuicer,
an' as near as a dam gettin' chokee out of her, too!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sam!&quot; exclaimed Torre, popping his head up alongside
the speaker.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, bli' me!&quot; shouted the other, nearly falling off
the chest on which he sat, &quot;if 'taint the young baby-pincher
from the <i>Andromedary</i>! Now what the blazes brings you
here?&quot; pulling Torre up as he spoke, and giving him a seat
beside him.</p>
<p>Whereupon Torre told his story, interrupted by roars of laughter
from the watch as he related the episode of the painting of the
second mate.</p>
<p>&quot;You're right enough here, sonny,&quot; remarked
Sam&mdash;the man who on the <i>Andromeda</i> had been so liberal
with his remarks when Svenson fell overboard. &quot;But ye'll have
to git off at Adelaide. Boys ain't wanted on these here coasters.
Now turn to and fill yer belly. I'll bet it'll be the best feed
ye've had since leavin' the Big Smoke.&quot;</p>
<p>And so it proved, for the seamen of the <i>Yatala</i> lived
better than the saloon passengers of the <i>Andromeda</i> had
done.</p>
<p>By the time the meal was over, the electric lights were turned
on; and Sam, saying to Torre, &quot;You'd better keep pretty close,
because stowaways ain't not to say popular in this line,&quot; went
away, returning presently, with a mattress and some bedding.</p>
<p>&quot;There,&quot; said he, &quot;I shook them things out o' the
steerage. There ain't many passengers this trip. Sling 'em into
that spare bunk, sonny, and 'ave a snooze. The chaps is all right
uns; an' I've give the nod to 'em. But if any disremembers, an'
gits at all inquisitious, just you say, says you, &quot;I'm Sam the
Sailor's young nevvy,' says you. 'An' if you don't mind yer eye,
uncle'll put it in a curous sort of a sling for ye.' It's my
look-out now. Draw them curtins so's to keep the light outer yer
face, an' there y'are&mdash;snug as a bloomin' 'possum in a
'ole.&quot;</p>
<p>But it was some time before Torre could fall asleep. The change
in his prospects had been such a sudden and a radical one that he
had had no leisure to think it over. All he possessed in the world,
apparently, was the suit of paint-stained dungaree he wore, and in
the jacket pocket of which was the last letter received that day
from his uncle, enclosing one from Edie. Perhaps of all the
thoughts that flitted through Torre's brain as he lay in his bunk,
the predominant one was thankfulness at being clear of the
<i>Andromeda</i>. From his father, probably, he had inherited, with
his good looks, all the instincts of a gentleman, and the menial
drudgery of which his life had been made up for the last four
months held for him a repulsion and disgust that nothing would ever
induce him to undergo again. But, in spite of all, he still loved
the sea, and was loth to give up all idea of it as a profession. To
return home to his uncle, even if he had felt so inclined, he knew
would be useless whilst his aunt lived. Premium and outfit must
have swallowed all, or more than all, of his little capital. No,
decidedly, there was no going back! One good effect of the time
passed upon the <i>Andromeda</i> was that it had knocked a deal of
the dreamy romance entailed by much reading of sea-novels out of
the boy's mind. And he was young, strong, active and plucky, all
fine possessions to begin life with, even if one has made a mull at
starting. Not an ideal boy, or a faultless one by any means, but
still, a very fair specimen as they are made in these days; and, as
one likes to think, no whit inferior to those of long ago whose
fathers drew bow at Cre&ccedil;y and Agincourt; or, later, singed
the Spaniards' beards; or, later still, sternly faced the Mutiny;
or died in Crimean trenches.</p>
<p>Evidently, in Torre's case, it was useless to make plans; so,
after a while, fully recognising this, he gave up thinking, and,
turning over, fell asleep with the rush of the <i>Yatala's</i> bow
wave against his ears and the regular thump thump of her engines
seemingly at his feet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br>
&quot;BRALGA.&quot;</h2>
<p>AWAKING, Torre found it was broad daylight, and Sam and his
watch at breakfast.</p>
<p>The men greeted him kindly, and after a good wash he joined
them. Through the forecastle doors he could see the steerage
passengers' sitting and lounging about the decks; further aft, the
bridge, with above its canvas &quot;dodgers&quot; or wind screens,
the gilt-banded cap of an officer.</p>
<p>As Sam smoked his pipe before turning in, Torre took counsel
with him. The <i>Yatala</i>, it seemed, was bound for Fremantle, in
Western Australia. But Sam did not advise Torre to go on there,
even if his presence could be kept a secret. It would be too risky,
he thought. Besides, there was nothing to do for a boy ashore in
the Western Colony.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell ye what,&quot; said Sam at last; &quot;ye says ye
won't go home, although, from Adelaide, it mightn't be hard to get
a passidge as or'nary seaman. An' ye wants to folly the trade, ye
says,&mdash;which it's a darn poor one! Well, I thinks it's more'n
likely, as presen'ly the <i>Andromedary</i> 'll come roun' to
Adelaide to load up. An' that wouldn't suit. Now the bes' thing as
you can do, in my idea, is to git a job up the bush a bit&mdash;not
too far away&mdash;till the <i>Yatala</i>, 'ere, comes back from
Western Australia, which'll be a month or six weeks good. I've got
a cousin as is skipper on a schooner runnin' roun' to Wallaroo for
copper ore. He'll be in the Port by then, an' I'll see if I can't
get ye a billet with 'im. Ye'll larn more there in a week than
you'd larn in six months deep water. No use writin' 'ome fer money,
eh?&quot;</p>
<p>Whereupon Torre explained.</p>
<p>&quot;Bli' me!&quot; exclaimed Sam, &quot;ef that don't beat
all! One&mdash;'undred&mdash;an' a good many odd pounds to come to
sea! Oh h&mdash;ll! So 'elp me Jimmie Johnson if there ain't
some&mdash;ijiots in this world! But there,&quot; he continued
hastily, seeing Torre's cheeks flush, &quot;it's no use cryin'
arter spilled milk. Ye'll 'ave to go on the coast. An' it ain't
bad, if the work is a bit rough. An' ye'll larn. Which is the main
point. In that bloomin' starvation limejuicer ye'd serve yer four
year an' not be fit to make a long splice without havin' as many
lumps in it as there's in a fathom o' chain cable! Ay, ay, you
travel up Mount Barker, or Strathalbyn way&mdash;the cockies there
is harvestin' 'bout now&mdash;an' git a job for a few weeks, till
ye sees by the papers as the <i>Yatala's</i> in agen. Then down ye
comes; an', meanwhile, I'll have matters fixed up with Jim Turner
on the <i>Lass o' Gowrie</i>. I'll bet ye won't be many trips afore
ye'll be gittin' yer six quid a month as well as any ov 'em. Then,
bimebye, ye can pass fer second, or only mate&mdash;'avin', as is
easy seen, the needcessery edication. Then sling canvas and go fer
steam, till, lo an' beold yer! in a few year ye'll be able ter run
a boat on yer own hook.&quot;</p>
<p>And Sam, having thus settled the question of Torre's future
satisfactorily, lay back and sucked at his pipe. He was rather a
wild-looking customer, middle-aged, with harsh, furrowed face, and
grizzly hair that stuck up like a millet broom all round a bare
patch on his poll; whilst a great curved nose met a moustache that
sprung fiercely out straight and rigid, a good eight inches.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a pity,&quot; he went on presently, &quot;as Eastmore
didn't take ye with 'im for a spell. 'E's a daisy, is Jack! There
ain't no flies on 'im! 'E's got a Master's ticket, too, 'e 'as.
That's twice I bin shipmates with 'im. Larst time 'e was mate o'
the <i>Orinoco</i>, tramp, tradin' to Bahie an' Walloperaiser.
Steam or sail, it's all the same to 'im! 'E'll stay away for a
spell. But 'e's boun' to come back agin. I bin up the Bush, too.
Lots o' times. All over these here Colonies. It's right enough fer
a change. Now, young un, you go to Mount Barker. There's a cocky
there I worked fer. 'E's got a couple o' fine gals&mdash;darters.
'E's a bloomin' Dutchman; Carl Becke's 'is name. Sez you, 'Sam the
Sailor sent me.' That'll be good enough. You bet! I grubbed forty
acres fer 'im at a quid an acre. Well, 'e 'adn't got the stuff. So
I sez, 'Well, ole chap,' I sez, 'give us Dagmar there, or Louisa,
either'll do; an' we'll cry quits.' But altho' I b'lieve as the ole
man was willin', the gals only larfed, an' sez as they wanted
somethin' a bit fresher an' younger like. Well, I had to stop with
'em till the corn was ripe; an' I 'elped to pull it, an' 'usk it,
an' take it to market, all fer nix, afore I got my forty quid. But
I didn't mind. I was linin' my ribs fer next voyage. Why, I must
ha' put a couple o' inches o' fat over the kidneys that
spell!&quot; And Sam chuckled as he extinguished his pipe and
rolled into his bunk.</p>
<p>Finding matters thus settled for him, Torre saw nothing better
than to concur without question. This pleased Sam mightily; and
through the day he found means to procure a suit of tweeds, old,
certainly, but a good fit for the boy, and far better than the
light dungarees he had run away in. Also he brought him a soft felt
hat and a pair of blucher boots in place of Torre's cap and sand
shoes. Probably he got them from one of the steerage passengers in
exchange for tobacco; or he might have bought them. Nor did his
kindness end here, for, procuring a pair of blankets from
somewhere, he showed Torre how to roll them up, like a swag, with
straps to go over his shoulders and a piece of canvas to protect
them from the wet. Also, the night they turned up the Port Adelaide
River, he brought the boy an old and dirty one pound note and five
shillings in silver.</p>
<p>&quot;An' now,&quot; said he, stopping Torre's heartfelt thanks
with a deprecatory curse, &quot; 'bout eight bells we'll be
alongside the wharf. Last train fer the City leaves 'bout ten. It
ain't no distance. But you clear out to the station right away an'
ketch it. In the City you go to Pablo Frank's
rest'rent&mdash;corner o' Light's Square&mdash;got that in yer nut?
Right! Well, you tell Pablo as Sam the Sailor's roun' about these
diggin's agen, an'll look 'im up bimebye. Likewise, as he's to give
ye anythin' you wants in the way o' tucker, an' put ye on the track
for Mount Barker. There's a coach. But it's dear; an' the tramp'll
do ye no 'arm. We'll be shovin' out cargo all night, I reckon; an'
as I'm donkey-man, mebbe there won't be much time for yarnin', an'
I'll say 'So long!' at oncest.&quot; And the kind-hearted sailor
wrung Torre's hand and went away to see his steam winch clear for
action, leaving the boy with lumps in his throat, and eyes in which
glittered very appreciable moisture.</p>
<p>As he rolled his blankets together, another man came off the
dark deck and put a handful of silver on the swag, saying,
&quot;Here y'are, sonny! We bin makin' a bit ov a tarpaulin-muster
amongst us. We can't let Sam, d'ye see, have things all his own
way. This is just a few bob to help yer on the wallaby. An' mind,
when ye comes back, an' the same crowd's in this fok'sle, ye're
heartily welcome to a passidge. An' tell Pablo if he don't put ye
up to rights, as Bill Johnson'll bash his bloomin' 'ead in for him
next time he sees him. Well, so long, sonny. Keep a stiff upper lip
on ye.&quot; And away he went. Truly these were the kindest people
Torre had met since he left Newton Pomeroy. And as, presently, the
<i>Yatala</i> made fast and was boarded by a gang of stevedores,
unperceived he jumped ashore, glad to have escaped the fate of a
detected stowaway, and yet with a heavy feeling at his heart as he
gazed back at the big bulk of the steamer, her deck thronged with
dark figures, and her derricks already fishing cargo out of her
hatches. It seemed like leaving his last refuge; and, for awhile,
as he tramped along, he felt lonely. But he was glad to breathe the
cool fresh air and stretch his legs once more after his four days'
confinement. And, gradually, his courage returning, a not
unpleasant sense of freedom and adventure came upon him, imparting
vigour to his step and warmth to his heart as he made for the
railway station.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahi!&quot; exclaimed Pablo Frank, a dark-faced, but not
ill-natured looking Spaniard, &quot;So senhor Sam de Sailor come
again, eh? Oh, yase; ver' well. Why cert'n'ly. Me an' Sam chipmet
once&mdash;twicest&mdash;tree time. Ver' good man, Sam. Yase,
<i>amigo</i>, suppa, bet, brikfest. Why cert'n'ly. Ah-ha, de
<i>Yatla</i>! Me know? Ver' nice chip. Ah dat rocque, Pill Yohnson.
<i>Si, si</i>. Me know. Ah-ha, you tek de swac to de boosh on de
<i>estancia</i> for to get job! Si?&quot;</p>
<p>Whilst talking, Pablo was busy laying one of the many small
tables in the long room of the restaurant, nearly deserted at this
late hour, and soon had a suitable meal set before Torre,
chattering away whilst the lad ate, about his seafaring days, but
evincing little curiosity as to his visitor's business. Then, as
Torre finished, he took him upstairs and showed him into a small
but clean room, promising to give him an early call, as Torre had
said he would start at sunrise. It was the month of February, and
Sam had advised him always to get the best part of his journey over
before the great heat of the day came on, during which travelling
on foot is not to be thought of.</p>
<p>True to his word, Pablo aroused him whilst it was yet dark.
Descending, he found, early as it was, a smoking hot breakfast of
sausages and mashed potatoes awaiting him. But when it came to
payment, Pablo indignantly refused.</p>
<p>&quot;No! no! no!&quot; said he, shaking his head furiously,
&quot;Sam an' Pill knock-a me de 'ead if I teks 'im. Bimbi dey come
an' dey pay pe-lenty. Why cert'n'ly! You bet! Com' long, me show de
vay.&quot; And snatching up a bag, Pablo took Torre to the top of
Hindley Street and gave him precise directions for clearing the
city and gaining the Mount Lofty road. Then handing him the parcel,
he said, &quot;Tucka&mdash;must 'ave 'im on de vallabie, eh? You
bet! <i>Addios</i>&mdash;goot bye, <i>se&ntilde;hor</i>. You come
back bimbi, pe-lenty money. Why, cert'n'ly, <i>vay a usted con
dios</i>!&quot; and with a farewell wave of his hand he ran back to
his shop.</p>
<p>The sun was just rising as Torre left the last of the trim
suburban villas behind him, and entered the park-like country that
slopes up to the spurs of the Mount Lofty ranges. It was a lovely
morning with a cool breeze blowing, and Torre, excited both by the
novelty of the scene and his own strange feeling of utter
independence, tramped quickly along, always ascending, until, after
an hour or two, the day getting unpleasantly hot, he turned off the
road and rested under the shadow of some trees. Here, tired by the
unusual exercise, he fell asleep, and when he awoke the sun was
high. He felt hungry, too, and was glad to have recourse to Pablo's
bag, which he found well stocked with cheese, sausages, scones, a
couple of raw onions, and some biscuits. Making a good meal, washed
down with water from a neighbouring creek, Torre essayed a fresh
start. But he was stiff; his feet felt as if they were swollen to
twice their size; his swag, light as it was, seemed to burn through
his coat, and the weight of his bag of provisions was well nigh
intolerable. And the sun shone down mercilessly upon the white
dusty road. Evidently &quot;swagging it&quot; was not all cakes and
ale. But manfully persevering, he trudged along, not without many a
wistful glance to where above the tree tops rose puffs of feathery
smoke, telling of the railway; until, presently, to his joy, a man
overtaking him in a spring cart, offered him a lift.</p>
<p>His new friend turned out to be a German&mdash;a farmer from
near a place called Hahndorf. He looked curiously at Torre, but
said little until the latter asked him if he knew the Beckes.</p>
<p>&quot;Yaze,&quot; said he, &quot;I knows dem veil. Bud dey is
nod ad Mound Barker no more. Dey vas zold oop by a sdoregeeber in
de City. Den Becke and his vamily dey go do Yankalilla, und from
dere dey go again oop de goast. Bort Augusta vays, I
dink.&quot;</p>
<p>This was bad news for Torre; and he told the man that he had
expected work there. But the other shook his head saying, &quot;Id
is hardt to get a shob now. I regollekt veil dat Sam de Sailor. He
vas goot bushman&mdash;vence, dig, plough, anytinks. Bud a
new-ghum, as you, an' a boy, doo, geds nodings onless you 'ave der
eggsberience.&quot;</p>
<p>And Torre felt that this was probably only too true.</p>
<p>&quot;De varmers is boor,&quot; the other continued, &quot;by de
bat zeazon, und dey gannot avvord to bay labour. Bud if you dravel
do de zheep sdadions, dere you ged a shob bretty zoon, berhabs. Do
night you gomes mit me 'ome und sdays.&quot;</p>
<p>After an hour or two's travel, the farmer turned off the main
road; and in another mile they came to a cleared space in the bush
in which stood a bark-roofed, barn-like hut. At the door a
fairhaired, blue-eyed woman, surrounded by a swarm of fair-haired
blue-eyed children stood and stared shyly at the stranger. The
housewife could not speak a word of English, but she smiled her
welcome at Torre, and he soon made himself at home with the
children. There he first tasted damper, and coffee made from
roasted corn. Evidently they were desperately poor, these people,
and though, when morning came, they pressed him to stay another day
he refused, and set off along the track without any very definite
idea of where he was going, except that he thought he would like to
find one of the sheep stations his late host had mentioned, and
imagined he might perhaps come across one. At midday, feeling
thirsty, he left the road and descended into a deep gully which
gave promise of water. But it was dry and he felt thirstier than
ever. So he followed it for a mile or so when, seeing a branch
gully, he took to that for a good distance until, at last, to his
joy, he heard the sound of falling water. Hastening, he all at once
came out upon a steep, grassy slope, at the foot of which, bordered
by ti-tree, ran a creek. Soon quenching his thirst, he lay down in
the grateful shade and made a good meal. Just as he finished he
heard a voice at the water's edge. Cautiously peeping from his
cover, he saw a very tall, thin man with a swag upon his shoulders
and a little book in his hand, walking along the bank. And as he
approached, Torre heard him say to himself in a high-pitched
voice:&mdash;&quot;Now there! What I wants to know is where's the
conneckshun? Iron's iron, all the world over. But irony! Now what's
irony&mdash;'a kind o' satire,' it says 'ere&mdash;got to do with
it? They both sounds alike&mdash;iurn, iurny. The only thing's the
extry letter. Well it just knocks me bandy for a langwidge. Iron!
Well, let's see if we can rise the colour of another sorter
metal.&quot;</p>
<p>And as he came abreast of Torre, the traveller threw his swag
off his shoulder, and, first putting the little book carefully away
in his pocket, he unstrapped from the top of the bundle a short
shovel and a round tin dish. Then, closely scrutinising the creek
banks, he chose a spot, and, filling the dish with earth and gravel
and water, began, to the watcher's great perplexity, to wash it
carefully, keeping part of the dish in the stream whilst shaking it
from side to side, and allowing the water to gradually carry away
the larger and heavier particles until only a little remained.
Then, putting on a pair of spectacles, he stared long and fixedly
at the residuum; washed away another portion, then another, then
straightened himself, saying, &quot;Black sand, an' nothin' but
black sand! Not a colour, not a speck! Darn such a country! It's as
delusioning as the English langwidge!&quot;</p>
<p>As he turned, Torre saw a big, round, brown, hairless face
seamed with innumerable wrinkles from amongst which, as he took off
his spectacles, shone a pair of restless small blue eyes. His nose
was fleshy but prominent, his mouth large, with full sensuous lips,
showing a good set of teeth, and his hair fell in a thick grizzled
mass on to the collar of his coat. He walked with a noticeable limp
or, rather, dragging of one leg, and was altogether a striking
figure to come upon in such a spot.</p>
<p>Presently, as Torre recalled talks in the <i>Andromeda's</i>
forecastle amongst those of the crew who had been gold-seeking, he
became convinced that the stranger was also searching for traces of
the precious metal. Meanwhile, the latter was methodically washing
dish after dish without result. And, at last, rising, he threw the
basin down with an oath and an exclamation of disgust.
&quot;'Tain't no use!&quot; said he, coiling himself, as it were,
on to his swag and proceeding to fill a short wooden pipe. &quot;I
don't say but what there's a bit 'ere an' there. But it's that
patchy as it ud take a life-time to hit on it. Gar! I'll clear down
the river agin. Darn South Australia an' all the Crow
Eaters<sup>1</sup> in it! It's a pore country fer tucker; the
squatters is as mean as workus skilly; the settlers is nex' door to
starvin,' an' thinks as much of a pum'kin as if't were a pig, an'
of a pannakin o' flour as if't were gold dust. Yah!&quot; And he
puffed away at his pipe in meditative silence.</p>
<p class="quote"><sup>1</sup> Nickname sometimes given to South
Australians. Similarly Banamen to Queenslanders; Gumsuckers to
Victorians; Cornstalks to New South Welshmen.&mdash;AUTHOR.</p>
<p>Presently, Torre, picking up his swag, came out of his shelter
amongst the ti-trees, approaching the stranger from behind, and
getting close to him before a breaking stick betrayed his
presence.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sonny,&quot; said the traveller, turning his head at
the sound, but showing no surprise, &quot;an' what might you be
doin' so fur away from yer mammy? Prospectin'? Whalin'?
Bushed?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I'm just travelling around,&quot; replied Torre
indifferently, as he sat down.</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay, I see,&quot; replied the other as his big face
puckered all over into creases; &quot;just rovin' fer yer 'ealth's
sake, as it might be. Well, as I was just tellin' Bralga, you might
ha' chosen a wuss country&mdash;but you'd ha' had a h&mdash;ll of a
job. What ship did ye clear from?&quot;</p>
<p>Then Torre told him as much as he thought fit, winding up by
confessing that he did not know which way to turn.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, fer a kiddy, you've got a 'eart like a
bullock,&quot; said the man admiringly as Torre finished; &quot;put
it there, ole chap,&quot; and as he spoke he extended a great brown
hand. &quot;My name's Bralga,&quot; he continued, &quot;leastways,
that's what I'm called on my own <i>towri</i>&mdash;runnin', one
might say, from the Murray Bend to the Culgoa. Ye see, I'm long an'
lank like a Native Companion, which is a bird as the blacks calls
bralga. As fer the 'riginal name I've a'most forgot it myself. An'
it don't matter nohow&mdash;the very cod in the cricks knows
Bralga, and never tries to git away when they see who's holdin' the
line. But I'm off my <i>towri</i><sup>1</sup> now. Thought I'd see
a little o' the world, an' crossed into Crow Eater Land. An' I've
been mostly hungry ever since. Got any tucker? Right! Now we'll
light a fire an' boil the billy. You get the sticks gathered, an'
I'll get the water, which is only fair, seein' as you're sich a
rank new chum. No, hold on!&quot; he suddenly amended as he hoisted
his great length up, &quot;you're findin' the tucker. I'll gather
the wood, an' you'll fill the billy. Fair's fair if y'are a
chummy.&quot;</p>
<p class="quote"><sup>1</sup> Towri: native name for the run or
district of a tribe, from which it never departs.&mdash;AUTHOR.</p>
<p>Now Torre's provisions were at their last ebb; and Braga's
contribution only consisted of a Johnny-cake, two days old, tough
and leathery, some tea and sugar, and a piece of rusty-looking
bacon. Torre, who had just eaten, only drank a little tea. But
Bralga made such a clean sweep that, after he had finished, a mouse
would have found nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said he, as he rather ruefully shook out the
empty bags, &quot;I've made a beast o' myself; an' we're brokers.
But I ain't had a square feed fer a week. If we were on the River,
now, all we'd ha' to do 'ud be to drop in a hook an' up comes a big
cod; shove a lump of 'im in the billy, an' in about an hour, out it
turns, white an' flaky, an' there y'are! But 'ere!&quot; and he
snorted contemptuously as he surveyed the shallow stream.</p>
<p>&quot;Know nobody up the country, I spouse?&quot; he asked
presently.</p>
<p>&quot;Not about here,&quot; replied Torre. &quot;But there's a
gentleman called Barker, one of our passengers, who told me to come
and see him if I ever was near the station. It's not far from
Bourke.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jack Barker, o' Ngoro,&quot; replied the other. &quot;Ay,
I knows 'im. 'Tain't a bad shop, Ngoro, either&mdash;meat, flour,
tea an' sugar, an' sometimes, if the storekeeper's in a good
temper, a stick o' back. It's in my ole <i>towri</i>. An' I'm
thinking' o' makin' back that way. I bin in Crow Eaters' Land long
enough. You might as well come too. Jack Barkers' find yer a job if
he said so. You bet!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But it must be a very long way from here?&quot; replied
Torre.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, a tidy step,&quot; said Bralga; &quot;say a couple
o' thousand mile, if ye keeps to the River. But that's nothin'. The
walks' do ye good. Got any sugar?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Torre, &quot;I never thought of it, nor
of tea either!&quot;</p>
<p>The other laughed. &quot;Money, I mean,&quot; said he.
&quot;I've been stony this six months&mdash;spent my last tanner
for back at Morgan. Had to cadge it ever since. Only got about a
prideful left now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I've some money,&quot; replied Torre; over two pounds
altogether.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good Lord!&quot; exclaimed his companion, &quot;enough to
travel to the Gulf o' Carpentaria like bloomin' swells on, let
alone to Bourke! Why, you couldn't spend it if ye tried, once you
get on the River.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What river?&quot; asked Torre.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, the Murray, o' course,&quot; replied Bralga.
&quot;The Murray as runs up bimebye inter the Darling, an' then
inter the Baron and Farrago right away into Queensland.<sup>1</sup>
An' ye keep along it, cutting' off a bend 'ere an' another un
there, camping' o' nights under the big gums, with the stars
a-looking' down at ye, an' the native bears a-grunting', an' the
flowing' o' the river fifty feet below in yer ears. An' stations in
plenty all along where ye calls fer yer bit o' damper-dust; an'
there's whips o' pigweed growing', which is better nor the best
cabbage; an' there's fish, sweet an' fresh, fer the grill on the
coals, or fer billing' in the billy, such as never was sold in
Leaden' all markets. Common' down, I 'ad a gun. But I swopped 'err
to a cove in Wentworth. She was a rum un fer ducks&mdash;80 yards.
All the way I lived on game an' fish. In the 'eat o' the day I
setter camp; an' go on by moonlight. If it rained I 'ad my tent
ready to pitch. Ay, the wallaby's right enough if yer ain't
fretting' an' written' an' runnin' 'ere an' there looking' fer
work.&quot;</p>
<p class="quote"><sup>1</sup> Braga's physical geography, like that
of most Australian nomads, is at fault here. The Baron and Farrago
are tributaries of the Darling, which in its turn joins the
Murray.&mdash;AUTHOR.</p>
<p>&quot;And do you never work?&quot; asked Torre in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; was the reply, &quot;I ain't done much these
last few years. What's the good? Wages ain't with 'avin'! Tucker ye
can mostly git fer the asking'! Sometimes I takes a stand in the
shearing' season, an' the cherub I gist then does fer clothes an' a
knobbier or two. But since these machines come in, I ain't done
much wool chopping'! This season I'll be too late fer the Darling'
sheds. Might git a cut in, though, somewhere this side. Most in
general I travels hatter. But I've sorter tuck a fancy to the cut
o' yer gibe, an' if ye likes to come 'long, I'll see ye safe an'
sound into Ngoro station yard in lesson four months.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hatter?&quot; queried Torre without directly
answering.</p>
<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; replied Bralga, &quot;I can't find the meaning'
in dic', here, but it means in Bush talk without a mate&mdash;on
yer own bottom.&quot;</p>
<p>Picking up the little volume, Torre saw that it was a cheap
dictionary, giving, at the outside, no more than a couple of
definitions to each word.</p>
<p>&quot;It's improving',&quot; remarked Bralga with pride,
&quot;an' it's puzzling' as well, in parts. I've worked through 'em
as fur as 'I.' Ye see, my dedication was rather neglected when I
was a kiddy. Now I'm doin' what I can to make up fer it. An' I
don't mind tellin' ye, too, that if I sees ye through to Barker's,
I'll expect' as ye'll lend me a hand now an' agin wig' some o' the
three-decker words as this dic' don't give no pronouncing
of.&quot;</p>
<p>Torre laughed. But the idea of learning something of the country
by walking through it leisurely, appealed to him. And, still, there
was his promise to his friends on the <i>Yatala</i>.</p>
<p>&quot;Toss!&quot; exclaimed Bralga seeing his indecision;
&quot;heads fer the Bush, tails fer the Sea. As I told ye, I'm
stony, flyblown, a lime burner without a cent, or I'd lend ye a
bob.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; replied Torre, producing a shilling,
&quot;let it be as you say.&quot; And as he spoke, up went the
coin, falling between them. &quot;It's a head,&quot; cried
Torre.</p>
<p>&quot;Right,&quot; said Bralga, rising. &quot;What's yer
name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Torre Leigh,&quot; answered the lad, spelling each
word.</p>
<p>&quot;Right again,&quot; replied the other, hoisting up his
swag. &quot;Bralga, Torre an' How'll start from Crow Eaters' Land
to the country o' the Cornstalks. First stage is six mile, an'
that'll bring us to a coccyx's hut where we git a handful o' flour
an', mebbe, a bit o' pork fer supper. Ay, bring the dish along.
It'll come in handy fer mixing the damper-dust&mdash;flour, ye
savvy. Darn the shovel! We'll leave that fer the nex' prospecting'
party. Easy does it, sonny, fer Jordan is a 'arid road to travel,
don't yer know.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br>
&quot;BLOODED TO THE OPEN AND THE SKY&quot;</h2>
<p>AND now for Torre commenced an extraordinary time of open-air
wandering&mdash;for such it was, although making steadily in the
one direction. But the twistings and turnings were so numerous as
to render their track almost a zigzag until they struck the Murray
at a place called Mannum. These deviations were not so much a
matter of necessity, but rather owing to Bralga's attention to
commissariat supplies taking him off the track to stations and
isolated settlers' houses. Torre had wished to pay for the food at
these places, but his companion scouted the notion.</p>
<p>&quot;There's two things only as ye can't ginerally git fer the
askin',&quot; said he, &quot;an' them's baccy or a nobbler.
Therefore, it's allers advisable to 'ave a few bob in resarve. Ye
don't smoke, nor ye don't drink. But I does both&mdash;on a strick
medium princible. I'm one o' the Co. So to speak, I'm the Workin'
Pardner. I looks out fer the tucker. Right! Then, o' course, ye'll
have to look out fer the lugzuries. Fair's only fair, ain't
it?&quot; and Torre was quite willing that things should be so
arranged.</p>
<p>Thus Bralga, on making a station, would empty the flour, tea,
and sugar bags, and, marching up to the store, generally return
with a fresh supply, and, into the bargain, often a shoulder of
mutton. Then, passing a bush store, or through a little township,
Torre would buy a cake or two of tobacco; and, if there was a
public-house in the place, pay for a couple of nobblers of rum for
his companion. And after such occasions, the latter would, as the
queerly assorted pair tramped along, relate strange stories and
legends of Bush and Camp life that made the miles slip past almost
unnoticed. Then, Torre's feet sometimes failing, they would camp in
some deep shady bend, where giant coolabahs spread their gnarled
branches a hundred feet aloft, and dark, whispering sheoaks seemed
to answer the murmuring of the stream below them, gliding by in the
shadow of its tall banks where the martins built. Now and again,
curious-looking, stern-wheeled steamers would pass up and down, in
the former case laden with stores for far western stations, in the
latter, towing barges wool-laden for the tall ships at Port
Adelaide. At times, as Bralga told Torre, when the rivers were
exceptionally high, these boats penetrated as far inland as
Brewarrina, or even to Walgett on the Barwon. But, on the other
hand, by reason of a sudden fall in the stream and ensuing rainless
seasons, they occasionally found themselves stuck up in shallow
ponds for months together, unable to move either way. In one or two
cases indeed, in such circumstances, the passage from Bourke to
Milang had taken nearly two years.</p>
<p>On these days of &quot;spell&quot; Torre passed much of his time
in the water, whilst Bralga fished for the cod he so loved. Other
travellers they met, too, running the river down, nomads who
brought all the news from the districts intervening between them
and the burning western plains. Of these, some were mounted men,
generally with a led pack-horse, whose talk was mostly of the
shearing; the state of the tracks as regarded grass and water;
horse-racing; the superiority of Wolseley machines to hand-shears;
and the possibility of a general strike of Bush labourers. The
footmen's talk took other directions: the quantity and quality of
rations at the different stations <i>en route</i>, the
&quot;hungriness&quot; of some and the liberality of others; the
prices of bushwork; Protection and Free-trade; the necessity, or
otherwise, of Colonial Federation; and the general deterioration of
the squatter from a swagman's point of view. And everybody, horse
and foot, knew Bralga, and left their own camps to interview him,
treating him with an admiring respect that puzzled Torre, until
later on the mystery was solved. So that, around their fire were
often gathered a score of nomads yarning and exchanging news,
whilst Torre listened with interest. Some of the crowd were
undoubtedly rough customers; but none of them ever offered to
interfere with the lad in any way. Amongst them, now and again,
turned up sailors who, tired of the Bush, were making back to the
sea again. As one of them put it, &quot;The country's all right fer
a spell. But, somehow, arter a bit, a feller gits a fancy fer a
sniff o' salt water oncest more. Ay, o' course, ye've got yer all
night in, an' whips o' tucker&mdash;on a good station; an' yer quid
a week, wet an' dry, an' not too many bosses a-hazin' of yer
around. An', well, it wasn't half a bad sort o' game&mdash;still,
ye see, well, 'tain't easy to give a reason fer leavin' it. It's
somethin' in the blood, I reckon&mdash;want o' salt, mebbe, that
runs a feller back to the ole
pully-hauly&mdash;ay&mdash;ay&mdash;sir&mdash;damn-yer-eyes life
agin.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yer a fool, Bill Adams,&quot; remarked Bralga. &quot;When
I seen ye last yer was a gentleman ox-conductor on Billeroy. 'Bout
eight o'clock ye began to yoke yer bullocks up. Then ye took 'em
fer a constitooshinal inter the paddocks fer a load o' firewood;
back agin at four, an' turns out fer the day. Good table ye 'ad,
too, in the station 'ut, an' Yankee Sam fer cook. An' then yer not
satisfied, but must go back to be chipped at, an' nagged at, an'
bossed, an' robbed o' yer night's rest, an' p'raps drownded inter
the bargain. Salt! why, dammit, if ye want salt, can't ye do like
the sheep an' cattle does&mdash;lick rock?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Bralga,&quot; replied the other in an aggrieved tone,
as the laughter ceased, &quot;yer knows as it's much the same wi'
yerself, ashore 'ere. Ain't yer allers on the roam, roam, roam? Did
ye ever stop a month in the one place? Ain't it up one side o' the
rivers an' down t'other all the year roun', wi', p'raps, a shed
through the season, just fer curiosity to see wot work's like. I
won't say nothin' 'bout whalin' nor sundownin'&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quit, ye blamed tenderfoot,&quot; here interrupted an
American who formed part of the audience, &quot;afore ye get more'n
ye'll be able to hump fer a month.&quot;</p>
<p>But the warning came too late. Bralga's long arm had shot out
and grasped the sailor by the throat, and, whilst still seated, its
owner was shaking him to and fro till his teeth rattled again.
Although a stout, well-made fellow, he seemed almost helpless in
that terrible clutch, as Bralga, puffing calmly at his pipe,
uncoiled to his full height, and, still shaking, remarked:
&quot;Now, young feller, I won't hit ye, because yer don't know yer
cumpn'y. But you'll 'ave to learn manners. I thought as most people
knowed better'n to insult Bralga. Apariently there's one or two
left yet as don't. Now go an' set down like a good little boy; an',
when ye gits back to sea, don't leave it no more till ye've got
some sense, which means as ye'll find a sailor's grave.&quot; With
which exhortation he suddenly gave the man a twist and a jerk that
threw him like a stick a dozen yards away.</p>
<p>Never before had Torre suspected the immense strength concealed
in that loose slouching body; or that, as appeared presently, his
companion was the acknowledged pugilistic champion of those inland
parts, a fact peculiarly entitling him to the deference and homage
of their rough and often lawless nomads, to all of whom he was
known by a reputation gained from many a fierce battle at shearers'
hut or bush shanty.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the luckless sailor who had so foolishly drawn down
Bralga's resentment, had picked himself up and slunk off to his own
camp, whilst the conversation around the fire turned to discussing
the famous fight last year between Bralga and Paroo Billy at Avon
Downs.</p>
<p>But there were other times when Torre and Bralga had their camp
to themselves o' nights; and then, whilst the latter pored by the
firelight over his beloved &quot;dic,&quot; the lad would lie
silently watching the great throbbing stars as they peeped down at
him through the arching foliage. And, presently, his companion,
tiring, would put his book aside, and fill his pipe, and yarn until
the Cross scaling the southern sky warned them to their odoriferous
gum-leaf couches.</p>
<p>Some nights the mosquitoes were very bad and bit Torre
unmercifully. At first, on these occasions, Bralga used to pitch
the tent and light a fire of smouldering cow-dung in it. This would
expel every mosquito, and allow Torre to sleep in peace. As for
Bralga himself, he never slept under cover unless it rained. Nor
did the mosquitoes appear to bother him in the least. But for his
young companion he was always thoughtful, seeming to take a
pleasure in devising little matters for his comfort. However,
presently, Torre protested, and determining to take his chance
outside again, was speedily &quot;blooded to the open and the
sky.&quot; Then, envying the thick clouds that Bralga puffed
defiantly into the buzzing hordes, and mindful of second mate
Phillips's distasteful and obligatory lessons when he had made him
light his pipe o' nights and carry it to him on the
<i>Andromeda's</i> poop, he bought materials at a station store,
and thenceforward became a regular smoker, much to Bralga's
pleasure; for your pipe-lover, as a rule, likes a companion who
also indulges. And in spite of the &quot;pernicious habit,&quot;
under the new life&mdash;the constant exercise, and early rising,
and bathing, together with the wholesome fare&mdash;Torre broadened
out wonderfully, gained strength, and became hardy to a degree that
surprised Bralga. And the latter, presently, discovering that the
lad knew nothing whatever of the &quot;noble art,&quot; insisted on
giving him lessons which, as the old man possessed no mean amount
of science at the game, were valuable.</p>
<p>One night, getting into camp rather late, Torre, gathering dead
wood out of the long grass, gathered at the same time a long black
snake with a red belly which at once, coiling round his naked arm,
struck deeply just under the elbow.</p>
<p>It was nearly dark; still not so dark but that Torre could see
to tightly grasp the reptile below the head with his other hand,
thus forcing him to unclose his jaws. He had of late heard many
snake stories, and thought he remembered that this species was a
particularly venomous one. But, after the first shock and sudden
thrill of fear, he felt calm enough as he walked up to where Bralga
had already started a fire, and explained matters without a tremor
in his voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said Bralga to all appearance utterly
unconcerned, &quot;nipped ye, did 'e? Hobjected to be taken fer
firewood, eh? 'Old 'im tight now, sonny, while I de-cap-it-hates
'im.&quot; And drawing his sharp sheath knife, with one snick he
cut the snake's head off under the spot where Torre's fingers
gripped, and placed it carefully on the blazing small wood. Then,
unwinding the coils, he threw the body away, talking all the time
in matter of fact fashion, spite of a heart lying heavy as lead in
his breast. Then, always deliberately, he took a piece of cord from
his pocket and tightly tied it round the arm above the two red
marks, plainly visible on the brown skin. Then, pulling the flesh
up between his finger and thumb, he suddenly gave two rapid flashes
with his knife across it, and almost before Torre could feel the
pain, the other was sucking the wound with might and main. This
treatment he kept up until the place ceased bleeding. Then said he,
&quot;Now, sonny, I think that'll do. How d'ye feel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pretty fairly,&quot; replied Torre, who, now the reaction
had set in, was trembling as with cold. &quot;It was venomous,
wasn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, better to make sure,&quot; replied Bralga
diplomatically. &quot;I'm dead set agin all snakes me-self, an'
specially agin black uns. Still, I have 'eard as they ain't so bad
as brown uns. However, we mus' be joggin'. Tapoloro's up the river,
'bout a mile an' a arf. I knows ole Peter Robson. He's boun' to
'ave somethin', if it's only a drop o' whisky. Come along as slippy
as ye can.&quot; But, ere the mile was nearly finished, Torre began
to get drowsy and staggered in his stride, whilst things seemed to
blaze in the darkness before his eyes. Feeling how he lagged,
Bralga suddenly stooped, and lifting him up on to his shoulders,
and telling him to put his arms around his neck and hang on like a
'possum, started off at a quick run. And then Torre knew that the
case must be serious.</p>
<p>His next sensation was of feeling something burning his throat.
Then a voice said, &quot;There, that's enough brandy, you old
heathen. You think, like all other ignoramuses, that it's a cure
when it's merely a stimulant. All the spirits in Australia wouldn't
have saved him if you hadn't done what you did; and, possibly, if I
hadn't happened to have Muller's strychnine remedy, and known how
to use it. But he's all right now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By gum, then,&quot; replied Bralga's voice shaky with
emotion, &quot;it was a tight squeak. An' I wouldn't have 'ad
anythin' 'appen to the kid fer more'n I can say. I promised to see
'im safe to Barker's o' Ngori, in the fust place. An', in the
second place, I've tuk a real likin' to 'im. 'E's that plucky an'
cheerful on the road, an' 'elpful, too, when I'm a-studyin', you
wouldn't believe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, still at 'dic,' Bralga?&quot; said the other,
laughing; &quot;I thought you'd got through it long ago. Why, you
were at 'G' when you passed last time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An' now I'm only at 'K,' replied Bralga. &quot;Even wi' my
mate's 'elp, it's turble difficult work, what wi' the pronouncin's
an' meanin's, an' 'untin' backard an' for'ard fer words as like as
two peas in the sound, but all different in the spellin'!&quot;</p>
<p>Sitting up, Torre saw that he was on a couch in a comfortable
room well lit by kerosene lamps. On a table were decanters, and a
small case containing a bottle and a hypodermic syringe. By his
side stood Bralga, his wrinkled face paler than Torre had imagined
possible, and a short, stout, grey-whiskered, keen-eyed man who
nodded kindly at him, as he looked down at his swollen and
blackened arm, and said, &quot;That's all right, my boy. Don't be
scared. Bralga, here, had most of the poison out before he brought
you up. You'll do nicely. All the same, he might have known better
than to let a new chum pick up sticks in a river bend after
sundown.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I oughter, I oughter, Mr Robson!&quot; exclaimed Bralga
contritely, &quot;but I never gave it a thought!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; replied Mr Robson, &quot;take another nip, and
get away to your camp. The boy can stay here until he's fit again,
which won't be to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right y'are, sir,&quot; replied
Bralga.&mdash;&quot;Good-night, Torre,&quot; he continued, taking
one of the boy's hands in his; &quot;it'll be lonely enough without
ye down there. But I'm only thankful as it's no wuss, an' that I'm
leavin' ye in such good cump'ny.&quot;</p>
<p>Presently, Mr Robson's housekeeper brought in a basin of hot
broth for Torre who, feeling better, but a good deal shaken,
heartily thanked the squatter for his kindness.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; replied the other, &quot;if you will take to
roaming through the country in such a fashion you must expect
accidents, you know. Bralga's a good enough fellow&mdash;as
actually most of the old hands are,&mdash;but still, one would
think, hardly a companion for a youngster like you. What do you
want to get to Barker's for?&quot;</p>
<p>Then Torre told his story, to which the other listened without
comment.</p>
<p>&quot;Umph,&quot; he said at last, as the boy finished,
&quot;you're bringing your pigs to a nice market early. Look here,
you'd better go back to your ship again, before it's too late. I'll
see that you reach it safely, if you'll make up your mind. As I
remarked before, Bralga's not a bad sort. Still, when all's said
and done, an old hand, and a notoriously idle fellow&mdash;almost a
whaler in fact&mdash;is not the best company possible for any
boy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's been very kind indeed to me, sir,&quot; replied
Torre, &quot;and I have no wish to leave him and return to the
ship. The second mate would make things rather too lively for me
there. I like the Bush, and will try and get Mr Barker to keep me
at Ngori. Thank you very much for your offer, but, all the same,
I'll stick to Bralga. And what, if you please, is an 'old
hand'?&quot;</p>
<p>For a minute Mr Robson hesitated. Then said he, &quot;Well, I
don't see why I shouldn't tell you. Bralga's one of those who, in
the early days, left his country for his country's good; was, in
fact, sent out here as a prisoner, and passed years in leg irons,
as you may see for yourself by his walk. Mind you, his character's
fair enough now, if he'd only drop whaling, that is, loafing along
the rivers, and depending on the settlers for rations which,
together with an occasional fight, and a rare spell at the
shearing, is all I ever knew him do. No, I've got nothing actually
bad against him. But, there, if you're determined not to return to
your ship, you might do worse than go to Ngori&mdash;even with
Bralga. Evidently your mind's made up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite,&quot; replied Torre, to whom, indeed, the fact of
his companion's having been transported rather added, than
otherwise, to the interest and liking, if not actual affection,
that the lad was beginning to feel for him, thus producing an
exactly opposite effect to the one that perhaps Mr Robson had
reckoned on.</p>
<p>It was three days before Torre was declared to be little worse
for his adventure, and fit to take the wallaby track again. Mr
Robson said no more except in his rough and ready way to wish him
well. But the old Scotch house-keeper upon whom, by reason of his
handsome face and winning ways, Torre had made a great impression,
openly lamented his going, and loaded him with delicacies from her
store-room.</p>
<p>His stay at Tapoloro had been marked by the utmost kindness on
the part of its inmates; and yet it is questionable whether Torre
did not feel glad in his heart to be back to the utter freedom of
the Bush; to the tramps by day along the broad river; the resting
in shady bends; the nightly yarns and pipes around the camp fire,
diversified by doses of &quot;dic&quot; amongst whose wordy
labyrinths Bralga groped blindly, and with a heartfelt, expressed
admiration for the ripe erudition and scholarship that, here and
there, helped to make his path a little clearer.</p>
<p>And if Torre was pleased, Bralga was overjoyed; so much so,
indeed, that on reaching Wentworth, where the noble river they had
followed for so long is joined by the far-reaching Darling coming
down through the heart of the great dry West, he expended the five
shillings he had received from a party of amateur fishermen for a
couple of big cod, to such effect that, about midnight, as he did
not return to the camp, Torre was fain to go in search of him
through the town. For some time he looked in vain. But at last he
found him, put for safe keeping in the lock-up, &quot;full as a
tick,&quot; as the policeman phrased it. And, even then, being, it
appeared, favorably known in the place, and with nothing previously
against him, he emerged in the morning with a simple caution.</p>
<p>&quot;No resistance?&quot; had queried the Police Magistrate,
looking up at the tall powerful figure. &quot;None, yer
worship,&quot; had replied the Senior Sergeant gratefully, as he
reflected on what might have been. &quot;He jest come like a lamb
when I asked him. Said ut woos a case a snakebite he woos father
recovering' from, or somethin' a the kind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Snake-juice, more likely,&quot; said the Police Magistrate
with a grim smile; and, pleased with his wit, he let the culprit
off.</p>
<p>Shortly after this Torre picked up a dog, lame, and probably
abandoned by some drover. &quot;Stumpy,&quot; as he was named,
owing to the condition of his tail, proved an acquisition to the
party. &quot;A Scotch coolie,&quot; <sup>1</sup> Bralga remarked,
&quot;an' a well-bred un at that. We've been wanting' a Co. Now
Stumpy'll do fer it.&quot;</p>
<p class="quote"><sup>1</sup> Always &quot;coolie,&quot; in Bush
talk, not collie.</p>
<p>About this time, Torre, scanning a weekly newspaper given him by
a nomad, saw in the shipping news that the <i>Andromeda</i> had
indeed gone round to Port Adelaide to load for home, as he had been
told on board the <i>Yalata</i> was very probable. And he
congratulated himself on not having made back as, ere he met
Bralga, he had half thought of doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br>
AT NGORI</h2>
<p>&quot;Now, you chaps,&quot; remarked a man, riding up to their
camp one morning, just as the billy was boiling, &quot;if you want
a job, I'll give you one. You've got a dingo, I see,&quot; casting,
as he spoke, an appreciative look at Stumpy&mdash;by this, a sleek,
well-groomed dog. &quot;If you like,&quot; he continued, &quot;you
can have a flock o' sheep. I've got 20,000; takin' 'em up the
Warrego to Cunnamulla. Twenty-five shillin's a week, the best o'
tucker, an' a long job.&quot;</p>
<p>Bralga, to whom Torre had, since his talk with Mr Robson, held
forth more than once on the advisableness of doing something to
show people that they were not merely whalers or
sundowners,&mdash;<i>anglice</i>, loafers&mdash;looked at the lad
and, seeing by his face that acceptance would please him, drawled
out rather unwillingly, &quot;Where's the jumbucks? An' when does
ye want us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They'll camp about here to-night,&quot; replied the other,
&quot;but I'm short-handed; an' if you like to leave your swags
with the dray when it comes up, an' then go back and give us help
in, why, I'll be obliged; and we'll call it a day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's fair enough,&quot; replied Bralga with a sigh;
&quot;we'll be there.&quot;</p>
<p>And now began another entirely new experience for Torre. All day
long he and Bralga and Stumpy coaxed and drove their mob of some
2000 sheep along the dusty roads, spelling in the heat for a few
hours; and then on again into camp, where the cook and reporter had
tents pitched and supper ready. Then, when the whole 20,000 had
arrived and were all &quot;boxed,&quot; i.e., mixed in one great
woolly heap, generally in the angle of a fence, or a river bend,
regular watches were set of a couple of hours each; big fires lit
at intervals so as to encircle the recumbent mass; and a sentinel
kept moving quietly about seeing that no stragglers were feeding
out, and ready to stop a rush induced by a 'possum, or other
trespasser amongst the sheep. Then, in the morning, the 20,000 were
split up into mobs, each marching off along the track, with its
attendant drovers carrying their water-bags and lunch. Six miles a
day was the average pace of travel. Nor could one choose a shady
spot, or make on to the river at pleasure. Indeed, from the latter
they were at times many miles away. Eyes and mouth, too, were
nearly always full of dust, clouds of which, kicked up by the
sheep, were ever in the air. The country, also, away from the
frontage, seemed little better than a desert, and the travelling
stock route&mdash;upon which they were by law compelled to keep
their charges&mdash;the barest of all. No, decidedly, it was not a
very pleasant business, this droving. And, although Bralga never
grumbled, Torre knew that he was pining for independence. But the
boy was earning his first money. And with the aid of Stumpy, was
doing it well. Therefore he was proud and satisfied, although he
came, in time, to hate the sight and smell of sheep. The 20,000
were split into ten detachments of 2000 each, snailing along the
flat country just within sight of each other. And when they camped
during the great heat, the drovers, picking out a shade, camped
also; some sleeping, others reading, others playing euchre. But the
flies, ants, and mosquitoes made all life, both human and animal,
more or less a burden. Actually, the sheep were the best off, for,
clustered around the trunks of trees like heaps of bees they stuck
their heads under each others' bellies, presenting impenetrable
fleeces to the pests.</p>
<p>Torre had been with the sheep a month or so, when one day the
man in charge asked him if he could ride, as the reporter was
leaving him.</p>
<p>As it happened, Torre had now and then ridden a little at Newton
Pomeroy and, therefore, felt justified in replying that he
could.</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; replied the &quot;Boss.&quot; &quot;In
the morning you can go on and report Meringle. Tell 'em we'll be on
the run Tuesday night.&quot;</p>
<p>Torre was overjoyed at his release from tramping at sheeps'
tails; but Bralga looked concerned. &quot;Now mind,&quot; said the
latter, &quot;these 'ere hosses ain't like them at 'ome. Ye'll 'ave
to be careful, or ye'll be gittin' somethin' as'll astonish ye.
Still, if ye can manage it, it's better'n drovin'. An' it'll look
better when ye goes to report Ngori, which is right on the track
we're takin'! I'm chuckin' it up, too, when I gits that
far.&quot;</p>
<p>So, in the morning, Torre, saddling-up a horse, mounted. It
happened to be a young colt, and frisky. And the lad, excited and
eager, stuck both spurs into its flanks, and the next moment was
lying on his back looking up at a ring of laughing faces around
him.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, I thought you said you could ride?&quot; said the
Boss. &quot;A quiet thing, too; well, never mind. Take those hooks
off, an' try him again.&quot; And Torre, a good deal sobered, but
not hurt, divesting himself of his spurs, sedately climbed into the
saddle and started away, very deliberately this time, on his twenty
mile ride, returning in the evening, sore enough, but pleased with
his new occupation, and with having found the station and delivered
his report successfully. Another man with a dog had joined Bralga,
for whom Stumpy worked willingly, so that both had easier times
than when one dog did all the work.</p>
<p>In a few weeks Torre learned to ride very well; his reporting
taking him away from the sheep sometimes for a couple of days, when
the stations he had to warn of their approach, and thus enable the
squatters to convoy the travellers through their own flocks, were a
considerable distance ahead. At last the eventful day arrived on
which he was to report Ngori; and attired in spotless moleskin
riding-pants, a dark blue regatta shirt, with silk tie of the same
colour drawn through a carved quandong stone, soft felt hat and
white puggaree, polished leggings and boots, and all his horse's
furniture shining, Torre set forth, as handsome and smart a lad as
the Australian Bush held, on his ten mile ride to the homestead
that he had travelled so far to see.</p>
<p>The road was good, and he cantered along through the scrubby
flat country, now mulga, now gidyea, now brigalow, with grassy
plains and lignum swamps between; smoking and singing by turns;
raising flocks of long-legged bralgas solemnly hunting for frogs,
and crying with a noise of bugles as they flew awkwardly and
heavily away; galahs that made the paddocks look pink as they fed
on the nardoo seeds and screamed shrill defiance at him, whilst
startled mobs of emus ran waddling across his path from under the
quandong trees whose fruit glowed in the morning sun like round
spots of scarlet flame. By and bye, the white station buildings
caught his eye away to the right; and, turning off the road and
entering the home paddocks, he was soon in a spacious yard enclosed
on three sides by substantial out-buildings, on the fourth by the
homestead&mdash;a handsome stone house half-embowered in
foliage.</p>
<p>In the yard a thick-set, cross-looking man was standing.
Dismounting, Torre walked up to him and asked for Mr Barker.</p>
<p>Eyeing the boy with evident disfavour, the person replied
curtly, &quot;He isn't here. What's the matter? Sheep report, eh?
Oh, damn all travelling sheep&mdash;and flash reporters too! All
right. I'll send someone out to pilot you through.&quot;</p>
<p>Torre was lingering, rather taken aback at his reception, when,
all at once, he caught sight of a face he was sure he knew at the
door of one of the offices. Walking over, he called out, &quot;Is
that you, Eastmore?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's my name,&quot; said the man addressed, coming
forward and glancing sharply at Torre. As he looked, recognition
dawned in his eyes, and he exclaimed, &quot;I'm hanged if it isn't
young Leigh of the <i>Andromeda</i>! Well, upon my word, if this
isn't a go! Queer country, Australia? Hang your horse up,
sonny-boy, and come right in. Never mind that brute yonder. For two
pins I'd put a head on him before I go. Barker? Why, bless you,
Barker and Mrs Barker and the girls are just about Colombo now,
bound for old England again. The station's sold, worse luck. That's
the new manager. I gave him a month's notice first week he was
here. Got a fortnight to run. Well, call me a nigger, but it does
one good to see you! What price Mrs Captain's baby, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>By this time Torre was seated in a comfortable room, a foaming
glass of hop beer in his hands, with Eastmore alternately asking
questions and giving scraps of his own story. And from this it
appeared that Mr Barker, finding him qualified for the billet, had
engaged him, even before they reached Sydney, as book and
store-keeper for Ngori. Then, after a few months, Mrs Barker,
feeling rather unwell, was ordered a sea trip. Then came an offer
for the station at a very high figure, which was accepted&mdash;Mr
Barker giving Eastmore the option of staying with the new owner,
whose promise to that effect he had obtained, or of going to
another of his stations in Queensland. Eastmore had chosen to
remain where he was. But the purchaser, in place of living at Ngori
himself, had sent up as manager a person with whom Eastmore could
not get on at all.</p>
<p>&quot;A good place too, Leigh,&quot; said he regretfully;
&quot;none better. A fair salary, lots of riding, not too much to
do, and a trip to Bourke now and again. Lonely? Well, yes, perhaps
it is. But that's inevitable in these out-of-the-way parts.
However, I won't bother about another billet in the Bush. I'm off
to sea again. You'd better come too. There's nothing in front of
you at this life. Not that there's much at sea, either. It's almost
six of one and half a dozen of the other. But you say you don't
like sheep. Well, then, it's no use staying&mdash;not a bit. I
think I can get a ship straightaway in Sydney&mdash;as skipper or
mate, I mean. What do you say? Think it over, and I'll run my horse
up, and ride back to camp with you. <i>He</i> won't interfere. I
had to threaten to punch his head last week. There are Phillipses
ashore as well as at sea.&quot;</p>
<p>Just then &quot;he&quot; came up, scowling sullenly, and wanted
to know with many oaths whether Torre meant to loaf around all
day.</p>
<p>&quot;Friend of mine, Mr Watkins,&quot; said Eastmore, &quot;and
a friend of Mr Barker's, too. Mr Leigh,&mdash;Mr Watkins. A lord's
son, Mr Watkins, from the old country,&quot; he continued airily.
&quot;I'm thinking of going back with him to manage his estates.
And&mdash;&quot; but Mr Watkins, muttering something angrily to
himself, walked away.</p>
<p>&quot;No use losing temper twice with cattle of that sort,
Leigh,&quot; remarked Eastmore. &quot;I find light chaff produces
more effect than anything else on the type&mdash;the bovine,
mulish, uneducated, and would-be brutal sort of man.&quot;</p>
<p>Torre was very much disappointed at finding Mr Barker away.
Still it was some consolation, this meeting with Eastmore, to whom,
as they presently rode along, he told the story of his trip.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you've had a long walk,&quot; commented Eastmore,
&quot;but one that evidently hasn't done you any harm. Still, even
if Mr Barker had been there, I'm afraid he couldn't have done much
for you, if you dislike stock. And there's nothing particularly
remunerative in wandering about the country. I think you'd better
take my advice and come with me. If I get a ship I'll take care you
go too&mdash;as ordinary seaman, for a trip or so, till you know a
little. If I don't get on the quarter-deck, why, then, we must both
go into the fok'sle. By jove! that was a go in the
<i>Andromeda</i>, wasn't it? Of course you can finish this droving
business, if you decide to come. My time isn't up for a fortnight
yet. It'll take you all that to get to Cunnamulla. Then you could
catch the coach to Bourke and meet me there. I have almost
&pound;30, which is a good deal, when you know your
Australia.&quot;</p>
<p>Torre was not long in making up his mind. He liked Eastmore,
with his pleasant face, and frank, happy-go-lucky manner of
treating things. Indeed, ever since the <i>Andromeda</i> affair,
Torre had made a sort of hero of him, and this, joined to the
other's evident and&mdash;to the boy&mdash;flattering desire for
his company, together with his disappointment at missing Mr Barker,
determined him to accept Eastmore's offer.</p>
<p>Certainly he was sorry to leave Bralga. But then, as Eastmore
put it, he couldn't be wandering over the country all his life.
Then, too, Eastmore had a shipmaster's
&quot;ticket&quot;&mdash;proof quite sufficient to Torre that he
was a man worth following. So, ere the latter left him, nearly in
sight of the travelling sheep camp, Torre had promised to meet him
in Bourke, at an hotel that Eastmore named.</p>
<p>By now, the 20,000 had left the Darling, and, running the Culgoa
up, were just branching off through Ngori, and then across a patch
of arid country on to the Warrego at Enngonia, and so to their
destination. These final stages turned out the roughest on the
whole trip. For Torre, long hot rides on nearly knocked-up horses
that tried his patience and endurance to the utmost; for the
drovers, bad stages and scarcity of water and feed, thus making
double watches necessary to keep the sheep from getting off camp at
nights, whilst during the day they could hardly be kicked along, so
weak did the majority become.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm jack on it!&quot; remarked Bralga, more than once.
&quot;Back to the runnin' water fer me, as soon's we deliver. An'
as, Torre, it seems we must dissolve pardners, the sooner it comes
the better. I'm sorry to lose ye, boy, fer we got on rale well
together. But I ain't a-goin' to whip the cat over it, knowin' as
it ud be outer all reason expectin' ye to stay potterin' about wi'
me. I'll be a hatter agen along the bends, soon's I blew this
cheque I've got comin'. If I ain't due fer a bit av a bust arter
swallerin' a matter o' three months' dust, I'd like to know the
reason. Any'ow, if I've done ye no good, no one can't say as I done
yer any harm, 'cept in the matter o' that snake, which was purely a
bit o' bad luck. All the same, I'm going to 'ave a squint at yer
new mate. An' I'll take a ride in to Bourke, special, in state, as
one o' Cobb and Co.'s passingers.&quot;</p>
<p>So, when delivery day came at last, and the sheep, less than
their original number by many hundreds, were duly counted, and the
men's cheques paid over, Torre and Bralga started on their last
short tramp into Cunnamulla township. And there, taking coach, they
crossed the border back into New South Wales, behind four horses,
and in due course arrived at Bourke, the capital of the North-West.
A wide spreading town on the banks of the Darling, flat as a
billiard table; the home of the heat-wave; whence the camel trains
start for the still drier and more barren lands further out; a
place where extreme seasons meet, with its 120&deg; in a summer
shade to its 34&deg; in winter; almost wrecked at times by fierce
floods; at others, forcing its people to flee in terror from the
perishing fury of the sun.</p>
<p>As the coach dashed up to the Post Office, Torre saw Eastmore
evidently on the look-out for him; and the three presently
adjourned for drinks, Bralga and Torre a little abashed by his
spick and span appearance contrasted with their own weatherbeaten
toggery. Torre, as yet, seldom touched spirits; although, on the
<i>Andromeda</i>, when ill-clad and suffering from the cold in the
Southern Ocean, he had at times taken his allowance of rum. But on
this occasion nothing would serve Bralga but champagne, in a magnum
of which the trio drank each other's healths. Then, seeing that
Bralga meant to lose no time in beginning his &quot;bust,&quot;
Eastmore took Torre to get some needed clothes and a
portmanteau.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll be off in the morning,&quot; said he; &quot;I've had
enough of Bourke. Been waiting two days. Train starts at 8 A.M. You
must be tired. I've got a room for you next to mine. So, perhaps,
you'd better take all this dunnage up to it, and have a bath and a
fresh rig-out.&quot;</p>
<p>This was good advice; and when Torre descended, dressed in his
new clothes, Eastmore hardly recognised him, so great was the
alteration effected by clean linen and well-fitting tweeds.</p>
<p>&quot;You see,&quot; remarked Eastmore, when Torre said
something about expense, &quot;pulling a poor mouth's bad economy,
if you can possibly help it&mdash;especially in this country where
you're apt to be taken right away at your own valuation. I've been
up the ladder, and down at the bottom of it&mdash;I wasn't at the
bottom, by any means, in the <i>Andromeda</i>&mdash;and I've always
found it the best policy, if you want anything, to keep an eye to
appearances. The chances are that if you look smart and shipshape,
people will ask you to accept what, otherwise, they'd laugh at the
idea of giving you if you went down on your knees for it to
'em.&quot;</p>
<p>Bright and early in the morning, Torre was up and searching the
house for Bralga. But he was nowhere to be found. The barman said
he had gone to his room at midnight &quot;with a bloomin' skinful
o' all sorts.&quot; But although the bed had been slept in, it was
empty now. So, as the hotel waggonette with their luggage upon it
was at the door, waiting to take them to the railway station, Torre
reluctantly gave up all hope of being able to say good-bye to his
old mate.</p>
<p>But, as they entered the station, the first man they saw was
Bralga in clean new moles and blue shirt, alert and cheery, with
Stumpy at his heels.</p>
<p>And he laughed, apparently well-pleased, as Torre told him of
his ineffectual search.</p>
<p>&quot;Thought I might be in quod again, eh?&quot; said he.
&quot;Surely ye didn't think I'd git real tight, an' ye makin'
tracks so soon! Not much, you bet! But my! ain't we a toff this
mornin'! See 'ere,&quot; he continued, lugging out a small parcel
wrapped in brown paper and intricately bound with stout twine,
&quot;'ere's somethin' as might come in 'andy one o' these days.
It's the ole Dic. An' when ye looks at it, now an' agen, it'll
mebbe remind ye o' Bralga. So long, lad, so long! Good-bye an' good
luck!&quot; And Torre, looking back as they steamed out of the
station, could see the tall stooping figure waving his hat from the
edge of the platform whilst the train was in sight.</p>
<p>It was a long and wearisome journey, occupying all that day and
night, until on the early morning of the next day the train drew
into the Redfern station in the capital of New South Wales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>CHAPTER X<br>
TO THE ISLANDS FOR COPRA</h2>
<p>EASTMORE was a cosmopolitan in the widest sense of the word, and
his talents were as varied as the characters he had played. By
turns sailor, miner, journalist, bushman and explorer, his was a
most curious and attractive, if somewhat unsatisfying personality.
About forty years of age, he was tall and well-built, with pleasant
features, albeit the cheek-bones were rather too prominent, and the
eyes in colour of that dull, lustreless black that is apt to lend a
lifeless expression to a face. Still, with his frank smile, assured
carriage, small peaked beard and moustache, just showing signs of
grey, he would have been anywhere considered a good-looking man. Of
his past he never spoke. That he was an Englishman was pretty
certain; that he was an insatiable rover was quite so. Indeed he
seemed at home in most parts of the world, and knew and could talk
about people in them after that minute fashion which is the surest
test of all of a man's having been, and seen, and done. Here in
Sydney, for instance, Torre quickly discovered that part, at least,
of his threat to the captain of the <i>Andromeda</i> was no vain
one, for with pressmen of all degrees he appeared to be hail fellow
well met.</p>
<p>&quot;I tried journalism myself here once,&quot; he remarked to
Torre; &quot;but things were dull, and I found it impossible to get
constant employment on any newspaper. You see&mdash;&mdash;Oh, how
d'ye do, Tomlinson,&quot; interrupting himself to return the
salutation of a clever-faced, brown-bearded, spectacled man who
passed. &quot;That's the editor of the <i>Nomad</i>&quot; he
continued, &quot;a weekly paper whose pink cover you may see
anywhere between Nyngan and the Nile. It consists mainly of
paragraphs cleverly seasoned&mdash;often with pepper&mdash;and at
times served up hot, and hot on the edge of a libel action.
Tomlinson's the man I should have asked to help me with M'Cutcheon,
if necessary. The <i>Nomad's</i> done yeoman's service before now
by exposing abuses and slaying shams&mdash;and has suffered for
it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Eastmore!&quot; exclaimed a stout, dark-whiskered,
but somewhat absorbed-looking man, meeting the pair, &quot;where on
earth did <i>you</i> spring from? Sea or land, eh? A pile, at
length, or merely a sufficiency?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not even the last, Jenkins,&quot; replied the other,
laughing heartily. &quot;Nor ever has been, nor ever will be, I
fear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Umph,&quot; said Jenkins, thoughtfully, &quot;I expect
that's about the truth,&quot; and he peered inquisitively at Torre.
&quot;But you haven't told me of yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, in answer to your first question,&quot; said
Eastmore, &quot;I'm from the land last&mdash;the far Western New
South Wales country. Tired of that; and now I'm on the look-out for
a ship in which to test luck on the other element.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Curious place, the middle of Pitt Street, in which to find
one,&quot; replied Jenkins, putting up an eyeglass and staring
around. &quot;Now <i>I'm</i> looking for something far more in
evidence&mdash;a drink. Come and join me with your young friend,
and then, perhaps, unlikely as you may think it, it is just
possible I may be able to help you in your quest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Eastmore, &quot;as the sun's a good bit
over the fore-yard arm, I suppose we may fairly do so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know what copra is?&quot; asked Jenkins presently,
as they sat in the smoking-room of the Empire.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; replied Eastmore; &quot;made lots of it.
Why do you ask?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because, until this morning, I had not the faintest
conception of what it might be&mdash;thought, indeed, that it was a
new kind of gum, or glue, or a substitute for india-rubber. I
wasn't quite sure which. Anyhow, I had to write an article on the
subject for to-morrow's paper. Of course, I might have gone to the
Public Library and found something there to suit the case. But I
like my facts at first hand, if possible. So, finding from a man
that copra was simply coco-nut, dried in the sun, and exported from
the South Sea Islands, I made my way to a shipping firm I know of
near Circular Quay, and there got all the information I
wanted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, well?&quot; asked Eastmore impatiently. &quot;Where's
the point of the joke?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're always in such a deuced hurry,&quot; retorted the
other. &quot;You make one forget the gist of one's story.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An article for that old rag of yours,&quot; replied
Eastmore.</p>
<p>&quot;Not a bit of it,&quot; said Jenkins chuckling. &quot;It
was a ship for you. You see, whilst I was talking about copra with
one of the partners&mdash;a personal friend by the
way&mdash;another of them came in saying, 'What had we better do
about a skipper for the <i>Aniwa?'</i>&mdash;I remember the name
because a fellow was killed and eaten there the other day; and one
of our men, writing about the affair, put the place in Matabeleland
instead of the New Hebrides, where it should be. Not that it
mattered much. Still, it's interesting as showing the necessity for
having reliable data, even in a newspaper article.
And&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>But here, seeing that Eastmore was sitting back, puffing
resignedly at his cigar, and showing no further sign of interest,
Jenkins abruptly took up the thread of his story in a more
energetic voice. &quot;'Well,' said the other partner, 'if there
are none about that we know, I suppose we'd better advertise in the
<i>Standard</i> to-morrow. That'll bring a shoal of 'em to the
office.' See, Eastmore? Now, if I give you a note to my friend, Mr
Fibre of Fibre, Coir and Trepang, why, it may possibly save them
the price of an advertisement in that 'old rag' you mentioned just
now. Come round to my diggings in Elizabeth Street, and I'll write
it for you at once. I don't in the least know what the <i>Aniwa</i>
is. She may be a barque, or a cutter, or a steamer, or a raft. But
I suppose it's all the same to you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Every bit,&quot; replied Eastmore. &quot;And, anyhow it's
a decent firm, I've heard, and a liberal. Also, I'm sure I'm much
obliged to you, Jenkins, although you do back and fill so
confoundedly before beginning to steer a course.&quot;</p>
<p>Jenkins' letter, coupled with Eastmore's satisfactory
credentials, had the effect of making the latter, before many more
hours, Master of the <i>Aniwa</i>, a fine little brig of some 400
tons, bound first to the Gilbert Islands, where the owners had a
copra station, and then back to the New Hebrides and Solomons,
there to form other stations; as they intended to go in almost
exclusively for copra, instead of the general Island produce which
had hitherto engaged their attention.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it might have been something bigger,&quot; remarked
Eastmore to Torre, as the pair boarded the tug to go out to the
brig, then lying in Johnston's Bay. &quot;But she's not a
bad-looking craft. And it's the easiest rig going, in my opinion,
to handle. She'll hold as much copra as we can get, I daresay. The
firm have given me a free hand, so I'll ship a fair crew. I've been
thinking what to do with you, Leigh. Perhaps the best plan will be
for you to sign in the regular way as an ordinary seaman. But you
shall pass as my cousin, and live aft. There's lots of room,
evidently. I'll have a mate, of course, and a second mate and
carpenter combined, if I can pick one up. That'll make four aft.
Yes, she's a nice little boat. To look at her you'd take her for
700 tons at the least.&quot;</p>
<p>The <i>Aniwa</i> was nearly new, built of Tasmanian hardwood,
and with her knees and stanchions so close together as to resemble
a grove of timber. Not an iron bolt or rail had been used in her
construction. Everything was of copper. Her clipper lines gave
promise of speed; and her tall spars of Oregon pine, tapering away
to skysail poles, and crossed, not only by double topsail, but
double topgallant yards&mdash;the latter somewhat unusual in craft
of her size&mdash;made her look larger than she really was. On deck
everything was up to date. The ground tackle worked by a powerful
capstan in place of a windlass; she carried her side lights for'ard
in towerlets of iron, domed with copper, instead of unsheltered
screens, and aft; her anchors were a new patent, both flukes
fitting into the stocks, and the pair not taking up as much room as
one of the old sort; she carried four splendid boats whose
davit-falls were self-unhooking; and by the metallic clicking of
her block-sheaves it was easy to tell they were all fitted with
patent rollers. The forecastle&mdash;a house on deck&mdash;was
comfortably furnished with curtained bunks, and a broad seat cut
into lockers ran underneath them all around. There were also
cupboards here and there about the walls. Next came the galley,
containing a fine range, tiled floor, and table. For'ard of
everything was a scuttle with steps leading into a lower forecastle
in which were bunks, but of a much rougher description than those
above.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect these are for the 'boys,'&quot; said Eastmore.
&quot;We'll have to get some for boating copra, you know. And, take
her altogether, I don't think I ever saw a better found little
ship.&quot;</p>
<p>Right aft, in front of the raised and railed-in poop which, with
a broad alley-way running around it, reached nearly to the open
space where stood a handsome wheel and binnacle, was a windowless,
square structure, evidently, from its massive timbers, of great
strength. The door was fastened by a broad iron bar and a heavy
Chubb lock. Torre inspected this curiously, but without being able
to guess its use.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the trade-house,&quot; explained Eastmore, &quot;and
will be filled presently with all sorts of stuff, cloth, calico,
tomahawks, knives, axes, bright-coloured kerchiefs, scents, etc.,
etc., to barter for copra. Square gin used to be the chief medium
when I was down there some years ago. But although the niggers are
as fond of it as ever, its introduction is prohibited now except by
missionaries, to be used as medicine. It makes too much fight, and
also gives the natives an appetite for 'long pig'&mdash;human
flesh&mdash;at least so 'Missi' says.&quot;</p>
<p>All this time the <i>Aniwa</i> had been towing towards her new
berth at one of the Pyrmont wharves where she was to take in a
couple of hundred tons of provisions and necessaries generally for
trading stations.</p>
<p>Torre had often been on the point of writing home since so
unceremoniously leaving the <i>Andromeda</i>. But he had always
deferred doing so until the time arrived that he could say
something definite about his future, other than that he was a mere
wanderer in the Australian Bush. Now, however, the <i>Andromeda</i>
had sailed from Adelaide on her return passage. Nor, so far as
Eastmore could discover from cautious inquiries, had any orders
been left behind respecting her runaway apprentice. Derrick,
Deadeye and Scupper were large winners over the transaction, and
would probably, Eastmore imagined, refuse to take him back on any
terms now that he had voluntarily broken his indentures. Still,
Torre did not think it safe to call at the ship's agents for any
letters that might be lying there. Instead, he wrote a full account
to his uncle of all that had befallen him; and then, with an easier
mind, went about his work on the <i>Aniwa</i>&mdash;now nearly
ready for sea. With one exception, the brig's crew were all
British. The mate, Mr Brewer, an elderly man with a wife and family
in a Sydney suburb, was a quiet, decent seafarer, who, having,
after twenty years of the life, retired to a little home put
together bit by bit, had been forced to take once more to his old
profession, by the failure of a bank in which his hard-earned money
was invested.</p>
<p>The second mate, Mr Curtis, was a smart young fellow, a native
of Dover, who, leaving big ships, had already made a few trips to
&quot;the Islands,&quot; and round about the coast. And, although
not a carpenter, he was handy enough with tools to prove very
useful. He, too, had tempted fortune on the Westralian gold fields,
and often the recital of the hardships he underwent there would
make a watch pass away quickly for Torre, who, as the captain's
cousin, found himself looked upon with some degree of consideration
in spite of his inferior O.S. rating. This did not, however,
prevent the lad working hard at both the practice and theory of his
profession, making such progress under the willing tutorship of all
hands on board, that, long before the voyage came to its dismal
finish, Eastmore considered he would be able to take charge of the
deck if necessary.</p>
<p>More than once whilst the <i>Aniwa</i> lay taking in cargo, the
<i>Yatala</i> had made an appearance. But when Torre boarded her on
the lookout for his friends of that stowaway trip, he found the
original crew scattered, and their places filled with
strangers.</p>
<p>And, just at this time, he came across an unexpected memento of
Bralga. Packing his kit for the voyage, he picked up the little
dictionary wrapped in paper and tightly bound with string.
Something moved him to open it; and inside between the leaves he
found ten neatly folded one pound notes. And, as he fell to
thinking on the invariable kindness and patience of the old man
with whom he had tramped so many miles; his good temper, and cheery
optimism in all sorts of depressing circumstances, crowned at the
last by this act of generosity which, Torre knew, must have left
him with little or nothing; the lad's eyes filled with tears, and
there arose in him pleasant memories of shaded river bends, with
the scent of gum bloom, and the long stretches of shining water,
and the murmur of the breeze in the sheoaks that dipped their
branches in the stream; and of the wild gipsy life he had led
whilst being &quot;blooded to the open and the sky&quot; of the far
inland Australian Bush.</p>
<p>Very pleasant was Torre's life now. Never, since the day the
brig had cast off her towline outside of Sydney Heads, and spread
her lofty canvas to a fair wind, had he once regretted returning to
the sea. His so squalid and unhappy experiences in the
<i>Andromeda</i> seemed to him like a bad dream when compared with
those in this bright little vessel where the food was good and
plentiful, the men contented; whilst their officers, with the
wisdom born of knowledge, forebore to pull the strings of
discipline absurdly tight, nor attempted to imitate big ship
fashions.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Mr Fibre, a kind-faced old man with whom
Eastmore had made his arrangements for Torre's berthing aft, at the
same time explaining why he thought an assumed relationship
necessary, had taken some notice of the lad, remarking that, if he
showed himself as smart and diligent as Captain Eastmore
represented him to be, it should not be very long before he
obtained a higher rating. Also, one day, he brought on board a
sextant and a Norrie's Epitome and gave them to him. And, now, half
Torre's watch below was passed in study, and to such good purpose
that, very shortly, he was able, not only to take a meridian
altitude, but also a lunar or stellar observation by which to
correct the chronometer, whilst, at the same time, the mates took
care to thoroughly ground him in practical seamanship. Thus,
altogether, the lad was happy and contented, learning more in one
week than he had done during his four months on the Andromeda. Of
course there were still brass-work to clean, decks to sweep, and
odd jobs to do. But, always, if he happened to get a little
behindhand, some one would stay and help him. These were part of
his duties as an O.S. Here, the steward attended to the lamps; and
the cook hauled his own coal. He took his wheel and look-out
regularly, fair weather or foul, and raced aloft like an acrobat
when the word was given to shorten sail.</p>
<p>&quot;You'll do all right,&quot; Eastmore said once, &quot;if
you stick to the sea, and don't take to wandering any more across
country with old hands. I've a good mind to steady down myself;
especially if I got a bigger vessel. Still, there's that gold on
the Mambare, in New Guinea, that they were talking about when we
left Sydney. There may be piles up there. And there's not much to
be got at this! I'm a rolling stone. But you'd better quit rolling
whilst there's time, and stay at something permanent.&quot; And
Torre could see that, early as it was, his captain's mind was
already busy with fresh schemes of roving.</p>
<p>The one foreigner on board was the cook, a very fat German,
named Schneider; a good-tempered, jolly little man, as broad as he
was long. It was his first trip to the Islands; and a favourite
joke with the men was to feel his fat legs and arms, and poke him
in his well-covered ribs, whilst gravely warning him to keep inside
the galley and not let any natives see him, or inevitably they
would, by hook or by crook, kidnap and turn him into &quot;long
pig.&quot; To all of which chaff he would reply with almost the
whole of his available stock of English: &quot;Oh, yas, ver' nice!
Oh, yas, ver' nice! You bets! My word!&quot;</p>
<p>They were now sailing nearly through the centre of Oceania; and
day by day before Torre's delighted gaze rose green islands,
sometimes almost alone, at others in groups, through whose midst
the <i>Aniwa</i> threaded her way to the frequent accompaniment of
the leadsman's cry. Since leaving the Australian coast, barring a
few squalls, it had been a fine weather, fair wind passage. They
had passed the New Hebrides, amidst which lay their return work,
sighting nearly the whole group, scattered like a handful of
emeralds over the dark blue sea&mdash;some towering 2000 feet,
others almost level with the water&mdash;when, one morning, Torre,
doing something aloft, caught a glimpse of six black dots broad on
the weather beam. Thinking they might be porpoises, he went on with
his work. But looking again, he still saw them coming steadily
along, with none of the leaping motions of the &quot;sea
pigs.&quot; The <i>Aniwa</i>, before a light breeze on the quarter,
was doing six knots; and Torre, puzzled, hailed the deck. The mate,
however, could see nothing from there, and brought his glass into
the mizzen-top. Taking one glance he descended; and Torre, to his
further surprise, heard the order to clew up foresail and mainsail,
let go topsail and topgallant halliards, and lay the fore yards
aback; thus heaving the brig to.</p>
<p>They had passed Cape Cumberland, on Espiritu Santo, two days
ago, and but for a few atolls the way lay clear to Santa Cruz,
nearly one hundred miles away. Thus, as Torre descended the
rigging, not the remotest suspicion of the truth entered his mind.
And even when told that the black dots, now rapidly gaining, were
the heads of men swimming, he was incredulous. But, in less than
another hour, they were alongside, and six great, stalwart,
copper-coloured savages hauled themselves inboard, mother-naked
except for necklaces and anklets of shells; whilst boars' tusks
were thrust through the lobes of the ears, and several had round
pieces of polished tortoise shell inserted athwart the
nose-cartilage. They were not by any means prepossessing looking
customers, their bodies stained with red paint&mdash;that even so
much salt water had been unable wholly to wash out&mdash;and
gleaming black eyes that stared fiercely around, although their
owners were so weak that they were forced to sit down every few
minutes. One of them spoke almost as much, but far more forcible
English than Schneider; and from him, eked out by a liberal use of
signs, it was learned that he and his companions were Santo men;
that four days ago their canoe had been blown out to sea in a
squall as they were fishing off the island. They tried vainly to
right it. But at last it sank. No land was in sight. And they had
kept swimming night and day in the direction they imagined Santo to
lie. This was the fifth day.</p>
<p>They ate and drank voraciously, regarding Schneider, who brought
them food, with the greatest admiration, feeling his body exactly
as his shipmates had done, and making excited remarks to each
other, whilst Schneider, evidently none too comfortable, backed
into his galley muttering &quot;Ver' nice! ver' nice!&quot; but not
as if he meant it. Considering the time they had been in the water,
and the continuous swimming, they were in wonderful condition.
They, Eastmore said, must have been blown out towards the
Louisiades, and were making back again, keeping a course, however,
that would have just cleared Vanua Lava, to the northward of
Santo.</p>
<p>&quot;They're a bad lot, the Santos,&quot; remarked Mr Brewer,
the mate, &quot;even on the West Coast, and in spite of the
missionaries. But these fellows are East Coasters, I think. Reg'lar
man-eaters! See how their eyes snap when they reckon up poor old
Schneider.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Eastmore, &quot;I'm not going to take
them back now. They'll make a boat's crew, perhaps. Give them some
slops out of the trade if they'll wear them.&quot;</p>
<p>But they would not wear shirts and trousers; and preferred to
make their own loin-cloths of some bright-patterned
&quot;Manchester&quot; in which they proudly strutted about the
deck, darting truculent looks hither and thither. Ultimately, to
the great discomfort of Schneider, they squatted before the
galley-door, smoking out of new clay pipes&mdash;instruments whose
use they showed themselves quite familiar with.</p>
<p>About this time, the glass falling rather suddenly, and Eastmore
deciding to &quot;snug down,&quot; the &quot;Santos&quot; proved
themselves willing enough, and pulled and hauled, and even went
aloft, imitating, monkey-like, all they saw the men doing, but
still appreciably helping. Meanwhile, the sky had darkened, except
for one spot in the South&mdash;a long, green, evil-seeming streak
which, as the heavens grew blacker and blacker, looked perfectly
ghastly. Already the brig was stripped to her topsails and
foresail. Eastmore now took the upper topsails off her, and close
reefed the fore course, keeping the mizzen staysail set aft and the
fore-topmast one for'ard. By this the wind had quite died away, and
the green streak seemed gradually broadening and growing deeper and
more vivid in colour. Low thunder-mutterings, too, broke the
silence, and sharp flashes pierced the southern sky. &quot;Dambad!
Ohverymuchmoredambad,&quot; remarked the English-speaking Santo
man, whom the sailors, with their quick appreciation of the fitness
of things, had named &quot;Snooks,&quot; waving his arms aloft in
the fast fading light.</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay,&quot; remarked Eastmore to Brewer, the heathen's
right enough. But we can't be much snugger, and it'll take more
than that to swamp her. The main thing we've got to look out for is
a sudden shift to the nor'ard. Stand by the topsail-sheets there,
some of you! Leigh, come to the lee wheel. Mr Brewer, see that the
braces are all clear, and hands at them. Perhaps a couple had
better get aloft, fore and aft, and frap the sails down with spare
gaskets.&quot;</p>
<p>By the time this had been done it was black as a starless
midnight. Even the broad green streak was shut out by the thick
curtain that hung over all. Both thunder and lightning had ceased.
Air and sea held a great stifling silence. The <i>Aniwa's</i> men
hung about in groups, the sweat trickling off their faces, and
their clothes wet through with it. The brig had lost steerage way.
It was only three o'clock in the afternoon, but the binnacle and
sidelights were lit, for you could not see your hand in front of
you. It was trying work, this waiting for the unexpected to happen.
Even the Santo men felt it. &quot;Oh, baddambad!&quot; muttered
Snooks from where they crouched in a body close to the break of the
little poop.</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up, do, you croaking owl!&quot; exclaimed Mr Curtis,
viciously; &quot;you weren't born to be drowned, anyhow!&quot;</p>
<p>As he spoke, all the western horizon suddenly showed a lurid red
as of the reflection of a great bushfire; whilst, to the south, the
darkness lifted like a drop scene on a stage, revealing a sickly
green sky with a trimming of white underneath it, and from that
quarter there now came a faint swell that set the <i>Aniwa</i>
rolling. In a few minutes the motion increased to such a degree as
made it difficult to hold on to anything. There was just enough
light by now to show the brig sweeping her decks with the Santos,
never giving them a moment's respite in which to get a hold on pin
or gear. Presently the red western clouds parted, and a great
coppery, angry sun looked out through the rift. In the south pale
lightnings began to play on the green sky with its snow-fringed
base. Nature seemed to be steadily concentrating her forces against
the rolling <i>Aniwa</i>.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish to goodness something would happen!&quot; exclaimed
Eastmore, as he swung out to a tremendous lurch, like a hand-lead
from the main-rigging, to which he was hanging.</p>
<p>&quot;At last!&quot; said Mr Brewer. &quot;There she
roars!&quot; pointing, as he spoke, to the white water astern
coming up like an express train, and with the noise of a hundred
howling gales all lashed together.</p>
<p>&quot;And, by heavens!&quot; exclaimed Eastmore, staring under
the sun, &quot;here's another. Did ever anyone see the like of
that? Keep the yards square, Mr Brewer, the Southerly'll catch us
first. If it doesn't we're broken merchants!&quot;</p>
<p>Breathlessly all hands watched the two tornadoes one astern, the
other on the beam, racing up to the brig with such a deafening,
hungry roar as made any talk impossible. One, the western wall of
water, was like blood with the dull red sunshine; the other, from
astern, came on pallid in the glare of lightning playing around its
crests out of the hideous green cloud sweeping along with it. And
as they gazed, the men of the <i>Aniwa</i> felt bewildered and
terrified, whilst the brig flung them wildly to and fro as if
herself gone crazy with fear.</p>
<p>But Eastmore was right; and the southerly hurricane struck them
first. The limp topsails blew out with loud reports, and the brig
lay over till her lee bulwarks were deep under water. Had the beam
storm struck her at this moment nothing could have saved the brig
from instantly foundering. But, luckily, whilst yet the driving
smother was still a couple of hundred yards away, the <i>Aniwa</i>
righted. There was a momentary lull, and &quot;Port braces!&quot;
roared Eastmore, &quot;For your lives, men!&quot; The yards swung
round in a twinkling. &quot;Luff!&quot; And close-hauled, with her
bows now to sea and wind, the brig was tossed like a feather amidst
the meeting waters, whilst overhead the wind roared and yelled as
if with rage at her escape. Big seas leapt on board, filling her
from rail to rail, thundering aft over the poop, and streaming in
torrents over the stern. Torre and the man at the weather-helm
secured by bowlines were up to their waists. The crew were in the
rigging. And all the time, below them, water fought water, and wind
fought wind for possession of their prey.</p>
<p>&quot;Topsail sheets?&quot; roared the mate once, in question to
the captain beside him, flattened into the main rigging, as the
<i>Aniwa</i>, labouring heavily under the weight of three big
following seas, heeled slowly over and over as if she never meant
to stop till she had turned turtle.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep all fast!&quot; roared Eastmore back again through
the clouds of flying spindrift and stinging water, although, even
then, with their legs and arms rove through the rattlines, they
were looking straight down at the white cauldron outboard on the
opposite side. &quot;I think the worst's over now!&quot;</p>
<p>And, even as he spoke, the brig rose, shaking herself, a
streaming, forlorn, draggled thing, it is true, but victorious, as
she slipped over the further boundary of the battlefield into what
was, by comparison, a calm and windless space.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; remarked Eastmore, as he and his two mates got
down from their perch, &quot;I've seen some curious things in my
sea-life, and been in some tight places. But I don't think I ever
had a twenty minutes quite like that before! Grog ho! Mr Curtis,
you may tell the men. Then set the foresail and upper topsails, and
send those Santo fellows aft to bale the cabin out. Some water got
down. I think you'll find them in the lower fok'sle. I saw Snooks's
head pop up through the scuttle half an hour ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br>
OF THE BIG WHITE KILLING AT KULOA</h2>
<p>JUST a fortnight after the gale, the <i>Aniwa</i> lay at rest in
a land-locked lagoon. All around were coco palms and pandanus
trees. Nowhere near Makoora was there any high land in view.
Indeed, over the tops of the trees, away outside, were visible tops
of more trees, looking, so flat and low were the islands, as if
they grew directly out of the water. But a long way off could be
seen the dim hazy blue of hilly Banabon and Nawado. Just in front
of the brig was a native village, compact, each house adjoining its
neighbour in a half circle. A little further along shone the white
buildings of a mission station and a church. Atolls everywhere, and
none more than twenty feet above sea level.</p>
<p>Before the vessel dropped her anchor, Fibre and Co.'s agent was
on board, accompanied by his wife,&mdash;a native woman belonging
to Tanna&mdash;and three half-caste children. The agent's name was
Brown, an Irish-American, and originally a runaway sailor. He had
grievances. &quot;It's been a bad season, Cap,&quot; said he;
&quot;nut scarce an' niggers lazy. I ain't got more'n forty ton o'
copra at the outside. The beggars are gettin' too knowin' by half
in these parts since the missions came. Darn me if I they don't
turn up their noses at good stuff because it ain't got a crack
maker's name on it! Now, yesterday, a feller comes for an
axe&mdash;bringing some watered copra fer swap. Well, I seen it was
right, spite o' the extry weight, so I gets an axe out o' the store
an' gives it to 'im. Well, he looks it all over carefully. Then he
says: 'No good this one. Want Merkin
axe&mdash;Collins-Massy-too-tets axe'&mdash;meanin', o' course,
Massachusetts. An', darn me, if I 'adn't got to chuck a couple o'
yards o' calico in to make up! Why I kin do miles better down to
Tanna, where my ole woman belongs, or any o' the other islands. But
these Gilberts&mdash;yah! Better shift us, Cap. If you don't, I
guess I'll chuck the contract.&quot;</p>
<p>The speaker was a stout, red-faced man with a short beard just
beginning to turn grey; and, judging from what could be seen, his
whole body, from neck to finger tips, was one mass of artistic
tattooing. His wife, a powerful-looking, pleasant-featured,
coffee-coloured woman, was fully clothed in print jacket and skirt,
and wore small tortoise shell ornaments in her ears. The children
were fine healthy youngsters, who took a great fancy to Torre, and
made friends with him at once.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello!&quot; said Brown, presently, as he caught sight of
Snooks and his companions. &quot;Who you got there? Santo men, eh?
Well, they're worse'n the Tannas. Beggars wanted to make 'long pig'
o' me oncest! An', by gum, they nearly did it! Let's see if I can
patter to 'em any.&quot;</p>
<p>But they seemed to understand very little of Brown's
questioning. &quot;They're East siders,&quot; said the latter at
last. &quot;I can talk about ten o' the West side languages. But
what can ye do with a people that's got so many lingoes that one
village can't understand its neighbours five miles away? That's
what makes 'em fight like they does, I guess. These jokers are
pretty wild. Eat you without banany paste, or any other luxury, if
they got the chanst. Guess, Cap, ye'll have to take 'em back, or
ye'll be had up fer blackbirdin'! You musn't look crooked at a
nigger now; not, by Jehosophat! if he's clubbin' of ye! Swim! You
bet! Oncest, comin' across from Frisco, we met thirteen of 'em.
They'd been blown away from Oahu, an' been swimming a week then.
Goin' strong they were, too; an' if we 'adn't picked 'em up, I do
believe they'd ha' fetched the continent of America in due
time.&quot; And Mr Brown replenished his glass from the bottle of
whisky that Eastmore had produced.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you take your lot back?&quot; asked the latter.</p>
<p>&quot;You may gamble we didn't,&quot; was the reply. &quot;It
was in the old days before the Recruiting Act. We was bound for
Manilla. An' anyhow, we didn't care a dump for the Queensland, nor
any other gov'ment. I ain't sure what the Ole Man got from Johnnie
Spaniard fer his pick-ups. But seein' I was only greaser o' the
Yank, an' my whack come to a couple o' hundred dollars, it must ha'
been somethin' 'andsome. But them days is gone now. I'm jack on
havin' any truck with niggers arter the almighty doin' I got with
Stevens in the Daphne&mdash;three years bloomin' 'ard. By gum, if
it 'ad bin me I'd ha' kep 'all full an' let them Santos swim till
they busted. Darn their black skins, if it wasn't fer my ole donah
here, Sam Brown's bones ud ha' pointed arrers an' spears a good few
year agone. But when you picks Moll up fer a squid you lays her
down again fer a shark, right away! Well, Cap, if ye'll send your
boats ashore fer the nut, I'll be there. Meantime, as I see 'Holy
Joe' a-comin', an' me an' 'im don't square yards nohow, I'll quit.
He gives me a pain each time, that feller does.&quot; And droning
through his nose,</p>
<p class="poem">&quot;The livelong night we've toiled in vain,<br>
But at Thy gracious word,<br>
I will let down the net again,<br>
Do Thou Thy will, O Lord,&quot;</p>
<p>this curious customer gathered his family together and got down
the gangway, pausing as the mission boat approached to remark with
a knowing wink, &quot;You kin gamble every time, Cap, on the net
business with 'Missi,' an' everythin' that comes into it's
fish&mdash;from a pig to a nut.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I don't know but what he's right&mdash;at least in
many cases,&quot; commented Eastmore, gazing with evident disfavour
at the man in white clothes and solar topee who now stepped on
board.</p>
<p>Before even he saluted the captain, the new comer's eyes lit
upon &quot;Snooks&quot; and his comrades amongst the crowd of Line
islanders, and with a suspicious look he said abruptly, &quot;Where
did you get those boys from, Captain?&quot;</p>
<p>His face softened, however, as Eastmore curtly explained; and
remarking, &quot;Well, you'll have to take the poor creatures home
again to their own village, mind&mdash;wherever that may be. Of
course I shall report the occurrence to the next man o' war that
visits us,&quot; he began to enquire into the details of the cargo
the <i>Aniwa</i> had brought him. Then, turning to Snooks who, a
head taller than his brethren, stood near, the Rev. gentleman said
in a blander voice than he had yet used, &quot;Well, my poor
fellow, I hope the glad tidings of great joy have already reached
you from some of my brethren!&quot;</p>
<p>Snooks stared and, shaking his head, recited his unfailing
parrot-like formula, &quot;Ohbaddambad!&quot; and as an
afterthought added, &quot;Go to h&mdash;ll; you no good! Too dam
lean!&quot; thus almost exhausting the vocabulary evidently taught
him by some mischievous sailor or beach-comber. But when, on seeing
the missionary's look of indignation, he added all in one breath,
&quot;AnmaytheLord'avemercyonyoursoulforeveran'eversobeitamen,&quot;
the mirth of the bystanders found full vent in shouts of laughter;
whilst, with an angry glance around, &quot;Missi&quot; got over the
side and was pulled ashore to the sound of a hymn sung by his
boat's crew.</p>
<p>There was, however, no sense of the comic in Snooks, for he
glared fiercely at the laughing faces about him; and, after a few
words to his mates, they all retired to their favourite spot in
front of one of the galley doors, and there sat and watched poor
Schneider with speculative, unwinking black eyes, silent except for
an unanimous grunt as he now and again stepped outside to wipe his
fat wet face and arms with his sweat-rag.</p>
<p>Nalouna was a really pretty girl of about fourteen, daughter of
a chief, and herself and her father both belonged to
&quot;Missi's&quot; flock. Torre and she met one day at Brown's
house and were introduced by the trader in his own peculiar way.
&quot;Here, young un,&quot; said he to Torre, &quot;what d'ye think
o' this for a titter? Pass on a dark night without any shovin',
wouldn't she? An' see, Nelly, here's a smart lad for ye to go
sweetheartin' with.&quot;</p>
<p>The girl looked shyly at Torre out of lustrous dark eyes set in
an oval face of rich golden brown; and, as if she found the
inspection satisfactory, laughed through a pair of ripe lips
showing unstained ivory between them, and held out her hand to
him.</p>
<p>&quot;That means as she's fairly well pleased, I reckon,&quot;
said Brown. &quot;An' that, if you like, you can be right bower
with Miss Nelly. But no hanky-panky, mind, or you'll have Holy Joe
down on ye like a thousand o' bricks, to say nothin' of her ole
man.&quot;</p>
<p>And, after this, Nalouna and Torre met very often. And they went
for long moonlight walks amongst the plantations surrounding the
lagoon that filled the centre of the island or, in reality, atoll,
for Makoora was, like the rest of the group, but a circular strip
of coral. Or the pair would pass in Nalouna's canoe out through the
reef entrance to leeward and, pulling to another islet a mile away,
pay a visit to its village, there to be received with songs and
flowers by its hospitable people, also offers of <i>teiparu</i>
jam, made from a sort of gooseberry, together with hot bread fruit,
pork, and, for drink, <i>karak</i>i fresh from the cocoa's
flower-stalk.</p>
<p>Torre was, or thought he was, honestly in love with the pretty
island maiden who, on her part, seemed equally smitten with her
sailor sweetheart; and, o' nights, haunted the <i>Aniwa</i> in her
canoe till Torre could join her, when the pair would pull away not
to return sometimes till near morning. Nalouna's father seemed to
take little or no notice of this courtship. But &quot;Missi,&quot;
when he heard of it, was terribly annoyed, and in his intolerant
manner remonstrated with Eastmore. Nalouna, it seemed, was one of
his favourite pupils, and he intended to train her as an assistant.
But Eastmore only laughed, saying it was no business of his. If
Torre did his work through the day, he could go where he liked o'
nights. Marry the girl? Yes, why not, if he wished, and so give
&quot;Missi&quot; another assistant.</p>
<p>As for Torre he was, during these halcyon times, simply
revelling in his first love story, and had long made up his mind
that the <i>Aniwa</i> should sail without him. And as he and
Nalouna on hot Sunday afternoons lay under the rustling palms and
pandanus listening to the crooning of the ever-near sea, whilst she
with deft fingers wove a coronal of those little pink flowers that
grow in the rich volcanic soil, and placed it on his curly hair; or
out in their canoe, rocked by the sea breeze, stopped paddling and
watched the great tropic stars throbbing in the soft blue
overheard, and the phosphorescent water running, as it seemed, in
waves of shimmering refulgence half way up the dark masses of
vegetation that formed their atoll, whilst each to each whispered
the old changeless story, then all the romance of bygone days
surged back to the lad's heart. His idyll was complete. No more
wanderings, no more ocean hardships; here with Nalouna would he
spend his life in peace, counting friends, profession, everything,
well lost for love.</p>
<p>And thus it happened that when the <i>Aniwa</i> was once more
ready for sea, Torre was not to be found.</p>
<p>At first Eastmore laughed; then, as the searchers returned
without the absconder, he grew angry. Nalouna, the picture of
innocence and conscious prettiness, denied absolutely in her broken
English any knowledge of the runaway.</p>
<p>&quot;I ain't been here two year for nothin',&quot; said Sam
Brown who, with his family and chattels, was on board the brig
bound for a new station. &quot;An', you bet, I knows the nature o'
these heathen down to the ground. Moll (to his wife), you go and
bring that hussy off again. She knows where the kid is. An' I knows
how to make her tell us.&quot;</p>
<p>And, presently, Mrs Brown returning with Nalouna, Sam took the
latter to the trade-house. There he tried to tempt her with various
articles. But she only looked pertly and defiantly at him as he
coaxed and persuaded her in her own tongue to give up the secret of
Torre's hiding-place. Still, she made no sign except contemptuously
to push aside in turn combs, knives, rolls of print, brooches, and
similar &quot;Brummagem&quot; trash.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, swim out!&quot; exclaimed Eastmore, impatiently,
&quot;The girl's as tight as wax. There's one native, at least,
Brown, whose nature you don't know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll be darned if there is,&quot; replied Brown, with a
twinkle in his small blue eyes, &quot;an' a feemel's least of all.
What's in this case, now?&quot; (as he pulled out a large wooden
box from amongst the trade). &quot;Somethin' perticklerly fetchin'
by the look on it. Ye see, Cap, I expect the young un's been givin'
her an' her old man most o' the truck we got here. It must be
somethin' re-churchy,' as the Wee Wees<sup>1</sup> say, as'll
perdooce any impression. Ah, here we are! Just you wait till I fix
this up. If it don't bring her to her bearin's, then call Sam Brown
a Dutchman.&quot;</p>
<p class="quote"><sup>1</sup> French.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, look sharp,&quot; replied Eastmore as the other
unpacked a gorgeous mirror, &quot;or I'll turn the dashed island
upside down and see if he's on the bottom of it.&quot;</p>
<p>Rapidly, and with a practised hand, getting the gilded supports
in place, Brown set the oval sheet of glass swinging between them,
and mounted a great gilt eagle on top of all. Then at its base, on
each side, he stuck, on pins provided for them, a couple of figures
representing knights in armour with mace and sword; lightly rubbed
the lot with a kerchief, and held it up for Nalouna to see her face
in.</p>
<p>Smiling, she stared with gleaming eyes for a minute at her own
reflection, then muttered a few words to the tempter, who, rising
with a grim smile, said, &quot;That done the trick. What did I tell
ye. Come along, afore she changes her mind. She's got the toughest
one in the whole o' the Line Islands. Darn my rags if I'd ha'
believed it without seein'!&quot;</p>
<p>It was dark, but with a rising moon, as Eastmore, Brown, and
three seamen, leaving the <i>Aniwa</i> hove short and her topsails
loosed, entered one of the largest huts in the compact row that
lined the beach facing the lagoon. Nalouna, bearing her precious
mirror, accompanied them. But she came no further than the
door.</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Brown, &quot;hold her there till we
see whether she's given us the straight tip, or whether it's an
almighty sell. That there bit o' shoddy an' glass is worth a ton o'
nut, I guess; an' as I'm 'sponsible, I want to see if it's a square
deal afore she clears.&quot;</p>
<p>The place was empty inside. But Brown, lighting a candle, held
it up to the thatched roof, presently, his keen eye detected a spot
that looked as if the palm leaves had been recently disturbed.
Pulling at this, they came readily away in handfuls, revealing the
fact that it was but a false ceiling. Mounting on a seaman's back,
Brown thrust his head and shoulders inside and groped about, whilst
around him fell a curious litter of stuff&mdash;bits of iron and
copper, some carpenters' tools, empty bottles, an old flint musket,
a cutlass, and other odds and ends, doubtless filched, before his
conversion, from passing vessels by the master of the house.</p>
<p>Soon a yell of triumph announced a find of another sort; and a
protruding leg being seized by Eastmore and the others, with a long
pull and a strong one down came Torre bare-headed, wet through with
sweat, covered with dust and dead leaves, and looking remarkably
foolish as he blinked at the light.</p>
<p>&quot;Come, my son,&quot; said Brown, soothingly, in reply to
some half-choked curses,&quot; an' see who put ye away. An' for
what price.&quot;</p>
<p>And Torre, forced outside, saw by the bright moonlight under
whose beams they two had so often exchanged their vows, Nalouna
holding the glittering mirror clasped with both arms to her breast.
Her head was bent down; but, presently, as if constrained by the
intent gaze Torre fixed upon her, she suddenly looked him full in
the face; another minute, and a cry of remorse burst from her; she
threw the mirror at his feet, and wrenching herself free from the
sailor who held her, rushed sobbing into the bush.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>&quot;Heave an' bust her, bullies! Heave an' break her out!
Anchor's off the ground, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay, Mr Brewer, starboard fore-topsail braces, sir.
Head sheets over to port, there! Mr Curtis, swing your after-yards.
Leigh, jump into the apron with the hand-lead and give us the
water!&quot;</p>
<p>And thus, to the creaking of yards, the cheep-cheep of braces
through their blocks, the shouts of the men, and his own long chant
of &quot;Quarter less&mdash;eight! And a half&mdash;seven! No
bottom at ten fathoms!&quot; ended poor Torre's idyll.</p>
<p>And neither fore nor aft was ever a word spoken to remind him of
his foolish escapade.</p>
<p>&quot;She give him away, all right,&quot; was all that Brown
remarked to Eastmore. &quot;But the Queen o' the Cannible Hilands
couldn't ha' stud agin that lookin' glass, let alone Nalouna.
Jumpin' Jehosophat! I reckon she's a rale parrygin, considerin';
an' if I 'adn't ha' got Moll, there, I don't know but what I
wouldn't have a shot fer 'er myself.&quot;</p>
<p>But the captain only laughed and said shortly, &quot;Well, well,
he's young, and 'll soon get over his first fit of calf-love.
There's no harm done&mdash;good, in fact. Like whooping-cough, or
the measles, the sooner a youngster's got rid of his first flush of
emotional romance&mdash;brown or white&mdash;the better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;M'h,&quot; answered Brown, perhaps not comprehending, or
doubtful.</p>
<p>The <i>Aniwa</i> took fair weather and light winds with her
through Micronesia, until, running down the East side of Espiritu
Santo, she had to beat up the eight miles of St Phillip's Bay, into
which Eastmore put with the double intention of landing Snooks and
Co. and getting fresh water.</p>
<p>But neither that redoubtable individual nor his companions could
be persuaded at any price to go ashore. Nor did they seem to
understand a solitary word of the other natives' language. These
latter tried to come on board in numbers, but Eastmore made them
keep away by means of sharp hints from the business ends of
boarding pikes. Great, strapping, fierce-looking fellows they were;
painted all colours, and armed with bows and arrows, and old Tower
muskets and Sniders; flaunting whole cocks' tails in their bushy
hair, casting hungry, arrogant glances around; whose room seemed
infinitely more desirable than their company.</p>
<p>&quot;Dambadohdambad!&quot; was all Snooks had to say as he
pointed to the shore, and, picking up a stick, went through a
pantomimic process of gnawing, as at a bone, which was realistic
enough. Therefore, as it was plain his native heath was not in this
quarter, Eastmore determined to run down the eastern coast of the
island and find it, if possible.</p>
<p>Coming out of St Phillips, the <i>Aniwa</i> met a three-masted,
white-painted steamer, under sail alone, entering the bay.</p>
<p>She proved to be H.M.S. <i>Pathfinder</i> on a cruise, looking
for reefs; taking soundings; punishing evildoers, and patrolling
the group generally.</p>
<p>&quot;I think those chaps are Kuloa Bay men, by the cut of
them,&quot; said the lieutenant who boarded the <i>Aniwa</i>.
&quot;Better try down there. Only keep your weather eye lifting,
for they're a rum lot.&quot;</p>
<p>The naval man, as it proved, had guessed correctly, for as the
<i>Aniwa</i> opened out Kuloa, Snooks and his mates showed signs of
interest and recognition; and when yet a couple of miles away, all
except the former suddenly took headers off the bows and swam for
the land.</p>
<p>Snooks explained that he had merely sent them to herald their
coming as friends. Whereupon Eastmore served out to each man a
revolver and a Winchester rifle, put the boarding pikes handy, and
erected amidships, and all around the <i>Aniwa's</i> rail, a patent
of his own, composed of three strains of barbed wire. In these
latter days many vessels went into the Island trade unarmed except
for a rusty pistol, hanging in the captain's berth. But Fibre and
Co. took no risks on their ships. And as this was a practically
unvisited part of Santo, Eastmore thought it wise to do the same.
If he had, alas! only persevered in his precautions there might
never have been a big killing at Kuloa.</p>
<p>Snooks viewed these offensive preparations with equanimity, and
by signs protested that his people were the most peaceful and
harmless in the wide world. Then, sampling the barbed wire by
kicking it to try its strength, he hastily examined his naked toes
and howled out his never failing, and on this occasion, at least,
quite appropriate assertion, much to the amusement of Schneider,
whose fat sides shook as he exclaimed, &quot;Oh yas, ver' nice! You
bets! Dam goot!&quot;</p>
<p>Rather to Eastmore's surprise, only a few canoes came off, as
the anchor was let go in about twelve fathoms, and half a mile from
shore. And their occupants, after a short conversation with Snooks,
made no attempt to come on board, and contented themselves with
handing up gifts of pork and pigs, bananas, yams, and sweet
potatoes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Torre, whose natural good sense had some time since
led him to the conclusion that he had been saved from making an
irretrievable mess of things, grateful also for the forbearance of
his shipmates, gazed with delight at the snow-white beaches running
up to meet the thick-growing woodlands that, in turn, changed into
mountain masses rugged and broken, but without a bare patch, so
covered were they with greenery to the very summits of their five
thousand feet; whilst, here and there, amidst the wondrous
fertility of vegetation, a bright, almost perpendicular gleam
betokened where some waterfall worked its way through the curtain
of vines with which Nature had draped alike both gully and
precipice.</p>
<p>The harbour was a fine one, nearly land-locked, and with that
great desideratum hereabouts, moderate soundings and good
holding-ground. An ideal site for a copra station! And so Brown
evidently thought. During the passage he had conversed much with
Snooks, who had promised that if the trader established himself at
Kuloa, he could procure him in a month enough copra to load the
<i>Aniwa</i> to her hatches.</p>
<p>&quot;Tanna's full up,&quot; said he, arguing the point with
Eastmore. &quot;So's most o' the other islands. Traders cuttin'
each other's throats, an' 'Missi' encouragin' of 'em. It's the same
way on Santo, here, at the other side. This side's got a bad name,
an' 'Missi' don't like it any more'n the traders. But I don't mind
so long's the nut's there. Me an' Moll an' the kids 'll chanst it,
I reckon. You can stop a bit, Cap, just to see fair play, and give
us a hand to shove a store up. An' when you comes back from the
Solomons you can gamble I'll have a heap o' copra for
you.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown was no new chum; and, though rather doubtful, Eastmore, in
the end, let him have his own way. A chief was interviewed, a patch
of land bought, and with great apparent good will, the natives
helped to erect a store, dwelling-house, and a shelter-shed for the
copra.</p>
<p>Nothing indeed could be friendlier than their attitude, and
Brown, in his own words, began to think that he &quot;had struck a
patch&quot;&mdash;not a very easy matter in these days of
competition, and with trading firms springing up like mushrooms.
Snooks and the other five were especially eager and willing to do
everything in their power to help matters on, and formed themselves
into a boat's crew which, in charge of Torre, plied between ship
and store. Curtis, the second mate, was builder-in-chief, and under
his directions, the rough timber that had been put on board the
<i>Aniwa</i> for just such purposes rapidly assumed shape. Curtis
was a smart, brown-faced young man of about four and twenty, with a
fair short moustache lying close along his lip. He held a mate's
certificate; and of him this history has yet much to relate. After
awhile, as the houses neared completion, Eastmore allowed him and
Torre, with one or two other seamen, to sleep ashore.</p>
<p>Whilst at work clearing a garden, and fencing the trading
station in, the natives painted themselves black nearly all over,
leaving the nose alone red. And this particular tribe seemed more
civilised than any other Curtis, Eastmore, Brown, or the rest of
the <i>Aniwas</i> who had aforetime used the Islands, remembered
seeing. They kept their villages cleaner, built better houses, made
a sort of unglazed pottery, and cultivated large patches of yams,
cassava, etc., etc. Their boats and fishing nets, too, were
artistically fashioned, and they appeared especially friendly, and
anxious to be on good terms with their visitors.</p>
<p>Even Schneider lost his original fear of this mild-mannered
people and at times ventured ashore, and felt rather flattered than
otherwise when the whole village turned out to survey him in
open-mouthed admiration of so much adipose tissue.</p>
<p>By this the buildings were nearly finished, and the store
filled, not only with what Brown had brought from Makoora, but much
fresh stuff from the <i>Aniwa</i>. Under the trader's tutelage,
also, many men were hard at work cutting and curing cocoa-nuts, of
which the supply seemed inexhaustible.</p>
<p>To mark the completion of the station a great festival was
decided upon, to which, as a matter of course, the crew of the
<i>Aniwa</i> were bidden. The feast was at first spread in the
copra store, a long building of posts twelve feet high, interlaced
with bamboos; bearing a thatched roof reaching to the ground, and
floored with rough boards. Roast pigs, fowls and fish, with heaps
of yam and grated coconut kneaded into a paste with the milk of the
latter, formed the menu. But such crowds arrived from another
village, close to, that every thing had to be taken out and put
under a big banyan tree that overshadowed the state-house, or hall
of council, in which palavers were held. Here, long planks placed
on trestles served as tables for those who cared to use them. But
the majority of the guests squatted on the ground in the light of
torches of coir soaked in fish oil and stuck on tall staves of
iron-wood fixed in the ground in the shape of a great circle.</p>
<p>Eastmore had allowed all but two of the men to come ashore. He
and Brewer remained on board. And such was the fatal confidence now
felt in the Santos after nearly a month's constant association and
intercourse, that no one dreamt of going armed to the friendly
festival. Even Brown, suspicious and alert as he was, had for some
time put aside his generally constant companions, a pair of Colt's
Navy revolvers. Truly it was a case of <i>quem deus vult perdere
prius dementat</i>!</p>
<p>Kava is not a pleasant drink, even if one doesn't see it brewed.
But British Jack will drink most things, and the <i>Aniwas</i> were
no exception to the rule. And beside each sailor sat his native
sweetheart, ready to fill his coco-nut shell directly it was
emptied. After supper came a dance in which hundreds of women and
men, hideously painted, kept time to the beating of a drum five
feet long, played upon with two sticks. The scene was a curious
one; and Torre and Curtis, who had strolled away from the crowd
with its noise, heat, and smell, stood and looked on from the
darkened doorway of the council house.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was an almost dead silence; and, presently, three
booming notes were struck on another, and evidently larger drum,
whose echoes rolled back in muffled thunder from the mountains.
Doubtless, this was a signal; for ere the reverberations had
ceased, the pair of watchers in the gloom heard a volley of
diabolical yells, saw clubs lifting and descending in the glaring
circle of torches, and instinctively felt that the doom of those
who implicitly trust the savage Man of Colour was upon them. Then,
still watching, fascinated, they heard shots and saw the crowd
scatter right and left, disclosing a woman in its midst with a
smoking pistol in each hand, and three children clinging to her
skirts and legs. At her feet lay a man; other prostrate figures
were spread out around her. Crack! crack! crack! She was firing
into the thick&mdash;and at each report a native fell or screamed.
It was Molly Brown, the Tanna woman, who, more suspicious than her
dead husband, had come to the feast with his discarded revolvers.
Torre made a step forward at the sight. But Curtis, grasping him by
the shoulder, exclaimed hoarsely: &quot;Too late! And it serves us
all damned well right! My God! What a woman! Look!&quot;</p>
<p>And Torre, looking, saw that Molly, having discharged her
pistols, had been brought to her knees by an arrow buried almost up
to its feathers in her breast, and was now striving with uplifted
arms to ward off from the children the murderous dripping clubs
that were falling thickly on the group as the enraged savages tore
each other away from the victims in their eagerness to strike.</p>
<p>The lad nearly fainted at the sight, and felt sick, and would
have fallen but for Curtis's sustaining arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's climb up into the boot,&quot; whispered the latter.
&quot;I suppose we'd better put it off as long as possible. And
it's about the last place they'll ever think of looking in for
us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The ship!&quot; gasped Torre. &quot;Couldn't we make a
dash for her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The ship!&quot; echoed Curtis bitterly. &quot;The skipper
and the rest of 'em are like those poor chaps out there, before
this. I saw Snooks and the other five go off in our boat an hour
ago. Said they were taking a message from the chief to invite the
skipper to come ashore for a short time. Oh, a pretty little plot
it's been from the very beginning! Idiots! Asses! Serves us right!
Now then, up you get. A miracle may happen, but it'll take the
shape of long pig, most likely.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>CHAPTER XII<br>
FROM CANNIBAL LAND TO BOHEMIA</h2>
<p>FROM the front of one end of the council house, which was also
used for kava making, protruded a structure in shape something
between the bow of a ship and an immense boot. Once Curtis and
Torre had climbed up one of the carved pillars that supported the
roof&mdash;some twenty feet or so&mdash;and discovered that the
affair was cleverly made of stout bamboo lashed together with
sennit, painted, lined with mats, and thatched. Apparently its only
use was that of ornament. But it made a very secure hiding-place,
whence, by peering under the eaves, the pair could see much of what
was going on whilst themselves hidden.</p>
<p>And in a very few minutes they had swarmed up the pillar, and,
trembling with excitement, were looking out from the
&quot;boot&quot; on the scene beneath them. Some of the natives
were running about cutting the throats of the dead men, of whom,
including Brown, there were six. Others were busy lashing the
bodies to poles by feet and hands, ready to carry away. Many, it
could be seen in the dancing torchlight, were at the beach. And
from these, all at once, a roar of triumph proceeded, upon hearing
which more men ran with poles. Presently they re-appeared bearing
on their shoulders four corpses. One of these was laid just
opposite where Torre and Curtis crouched with beating hearts, and
bodies reeking with sweat. And as he suddenly recognised it for
Eastmore's, Torre groaned aloud, whilst his companion muttered hot
curses to himself. Their own dead&mdash;killed by Molly&mdash;and
numbering four, they carried off first amidst the wailing of the
women and the beating of many drums. Molly and her children and the
others, all tied to poles, were now borne away in similar fashion
on men's shoulders, Snooks apparently counting and identifying them
as they passed. One body, however, they left so much in shadow as
made it impossible to see whose it was. And now it became very
evident that Torre and his companion were missed, for many of the
savages rushed up to the new station; others seized torches and
searched the bush; and some looked into the council house. But the
great bare place was useless for concealment, and these last
withdrew at once. Meanwhile, a crowd had taken up the solitary man
left behind by the bearers of the dead, and placed him upon a rude
sort of stone altar, many of which were to be seen about the
village, and whose use Torre had often wondered at.</p>
<p>To their astonishment the friends saw that it was Schneider,
and, though alive, bound so as to be unable to stir hand or foot.
But his bonds were soon cut, the natives thronging around, whilst
some stripped him mother-naked, and others offered him bowls of
kava, and others again tried to stuff balls of grated yam and
cocoa-nut into his mouth. Then they crowned him with wreaths of
scarlet hibiscus blossoms and many-coloured crotons, and danced
about him, yelling at the top of their voices as the poor
bewildered wretch sat on the broad stone, and gazed stupidly from
side to side.</p>
<p>Louder and louder grew the noise of the great drums, denser and
denser the crowds, as from other villages the people came pouring
in, eager to assist at the great festival which had been arranged
so cunningly, and with so much forethought and
patience&mdash;presumably by Snooks, who now seemed to take the
part of a sort of master of the ceremonies, gorgeous in angular
stripings of red, white, and black paint, and carrying one of the
<i>Aniwa's</i> boarding pikes over his shoulder. Soon, from the
cook-house, behind where they lay, to Torre and Curtis came the
smell of roasting flesh, hot and steamy on the steamy air. And,
presently, great half-cooked joints were brought in on plantain
leaves laid over shallow wooden trenchers, whose significance the
shuddering and horrified watchers knew only too well.</p>
<p>There must have been fully a thousand savages present at that
appalling feast, the fruit of that big white killing of which the
memory yet <i>nae e nda piliwakini</i>&mdash;&quot;sits with legs
crossed&quot;&mdash;in the Kuloa district. And as fast as the
terrible portions appeared, so almost were they consumed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, even as they ate and drank, and danced and yelled,
the wretched Schneider, his white skin shining in strong contrast
to the dark masses around him, was the central object of interest.
A dozen at a time the cannibals would pass their hands admiringly
over his plump body, and then make room for others. Once he stood
up and seemed about to jump off his pedestal, but Snooks dragged
him down again and threatened him with a club.</p>
<p>And by and bye the dawn came, and the east flushed crimson, and
the sun rose on the lovely island and the blue sea, and showed to
the hollow-eyed watchers on death, the <i>Aniwa</i> riding
peacefully at her anchors; the new trading station just there on
the hill; the blood-stained ground with many gorged savages prone
here and there in groups; and Schneider, mercifully senseless with
the floods of kava that had been poured into him, again bound, and
lying at the foot of the stone altar.</p>
<p>The smoke of much terrible cooking still floated greasy on the
morning air as Torre and Curtis looked at each other's pallid
features, and crouched as low as possible amongst the mats, afraid
to stir lest some sudden creak of their cage should betray them and
send them to join that naked white figure yonder at the altar under
the pandanus. For this reason they dared not close their tired eyes
for a minute, or disturb the legions of sand-flies and mosquitoes
that, as the sun grew stronger, swarmed into their shelter and
preyed upon and tortured them almost beyond endurance. &quot;Could
we hang it out till to-night,&quot; whispered Curtis, &quot;we
might get down to the beach and collar a canoe. If only the
<i>Pathfinder</i> would put in!&quot;</p>
<p>But Torre only shook his head. His heart was sick for the good
friend he had lost in such a direful manner. Moreover, a fierce
wild lust for the blood of at least one of the cowardly,
treacherous murderers had taken possession of his soul; and he had
quite made up his mind that, if they were discovered, he would kill
Snooks and then die satisfied.</p>
<p>All that terrible day they lay there watching the natives, as
bodies of them looted the <i>Aniwa</i>. At first they used their
canoes to transport the plunder ashore. But, about midday, a strong
breeze setting in from the sea, they, led by Snooks and his mates,
hove the anchor up and, getting the topsails loosed, let the brig
drive right on to the beach, which she took with good way on her
and the loss of her topmasts. And there she stuck, nearly on her
beam-ends, bumping heavily, a sight to sadden a sailor's heart.</p>
<p>Schneider, again untied, was now placed in a small mat-covered
pen, and constantly tempted to eat and drink by attendants who,
when he refused, endeavoured by force to cram him with every island
delicacy they could think of. Nor were the two refugees forgotten,
for parties were at intervals coming and going from the bush, which
they must have searched for miles in every direction.</p>
<p>As the day wore on, the council house below them grew full of
noisy youths who for some hours were busy chewing the roots of the
pepper-tree and spitting it out again into dishes, thus preparing
kava for the night's feast. All the trade from the store, too, was
brought down and piled in a heap just inside the big house, ready,
apparently, for distribution. And to their almost utter despair,
Torre and Curtis, watching through little holes in the mats, made
with their sheath-knives, saw that a strong guard armed with spears
and clubs was set over the treasure. So close were they that the
fugitives scarcely dared to breathe for fear of attracting the
attention of two in particular who were leaning against the very
pillar by which they had ascended into the &quot;boot.&quot;
Towards evening the smoke began once more to pour from the
cookhouse; and Schneider was brought forth, set upon the altar and
crowned, this time with crotons only, whilst the natives danced
around him to the sound of drums. Apparently, so far as the two
could make out, the poor wretch was half stupefied with kava, or
fright, for, smiling idiotically, he beat time to the drums with a
hand on each naked knee, and it required very little imagination to
hear him muttering, &quot;Ver' nice! Ver' nice!&quot;</p>
<p>As the sun set, torches were lit, and the Chief of Kuloa,
terrible in paint and cocks' feathers, and with a great white shell
bound on to his head, approached Schneider, accompanied by Snooks
who bore a ship's wooden bucket, and a long butcher's knife.
Evidently the climax of the poor cook's fate was close at hand. But
the guard below, contrary to the hopes of the watchers, only stood
on stumps and trade-boxes to get a better view of the ceremony.</p>
<p>Torre and Curtis had seen enough of horrors, and they drew their
heads in beneath the sago leaf thatch. Suddenly the drums ceased
beating; the dancers their yells. Then terrible screams pierced the
night, startling the hidden ones till their refuge creaked and
swayed ominously. The screaming still continuing, Torre, moved by
an ungovernable impulse, peered out again, noticing that Curtis had
done the same.</p>
<p>Schneider, he saw, had, at last realising his fate and the
presence of his executioner, sprung from the altar, and was
struggling and screaming in the strong grasp of four men who were
bearing him, two to the legs, two to the arms, back to the
sacrificial stones across which, despite his efforts, they laid him
belly downwards. Then Snooks, handing the knife to the Chief, held
the bucket under the doomed man's throat whilst the other bent his
head back. But here, Torre, trembling and half fainting, sank down
with such a noise that Curtis gripped him hard and swore in
whispers, even as the victim's cries changed to a horrid, gurgling,
choking sound that made Torre stop his ears with his fingers.
Presently the drums struck up; and when he looked again, men were
carrying towards the cookhouse something that hung from a pole,
white, with great red blotches all over it plain in the
torchlight.</p>
<p>The pair were weak for want of food, and their tongues and
throats were parched. Torre, especially, felt ill and shaken. And
now, drawing his sheath-knife, he whispered huskily to Curtis that
he meant to make a dash for it, and at least kill one, or, perhaps,
two, of the bloodthirsty villains. Anything, he added, was better
than enduring another day of torture. The guard had scattered a
little, and were drinking kava, and gazing longingly at the
feasters, already beginning operations.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait a little longer,&quot; pleaded Curtis; &quot;those
brutes at the door will be off for their whack directly. It's no
use throwing a chance away. Then I'm with you. Hello! What's up
now?&quot; As he spoke, a tremendous hubbub arose of yells, shrieks
and groans, as from every side through the scrub came a rush of
warriors spearing, clubbing, and mercilessly slaughtering the
unarmed and surprised Kuloans who ran wildly hither and thither in
their attempts to escape.</p>
<p>There was, it seemed, to be a black as well as a white killing
that night at Kuloa. Already the guard at the council-house
entrance had gone, mingled with the struggling mass from which the
noise of clubbing sounded like that made at a carpet-beating
contractor's.</p>
<p>The torches had long been extinguished, and as the roar of the
battle&mdash;or rather massacre, for such it was&mdash;rolled first
one way, then the other, Curtis said, &quot;Now, Leigh! Now for
it!&quot; And getting stiffly out of the boot he slid down the
pillar, closely followed by Torre, who nearly fell, so cramped were
his limbs, as, reaching the bottom, he set foot on something soft.
By the light of an expiring torch he saw it was the corpse of a man
with his head smashed like an eggshell. Almost mechanically picking
up a long spear from beside the body he joined Curtis. It was only
some three hundred yards or so to the beach and the boats and
liberty. Between them and it were isolated groups of yelling,
pounding savages. But they kept safely outside of these, and had
nearly gained the beach when, to their dismay, they saw that a
similar means of escape having occurred to the Kuloans, many of
them had also rushed the canoes, and, pursued by the foe, were
struggling along the water's edge.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep to the right,&quot; whispered Curtis, &quot;there
seems less hell over there! Passing the stranded <i>Aniwa</i> with
her white sails glimmering faint and ghastly as she bumped heavily
at intervals with the incoming tide, the two got to the water and
searched along it for a canoe&mdash;anything that would bear them
away from that place of blood and horror.</p>
<p>Another minute or two, and they almost ran against a big native
who was striving frantically to shove an outrigger canoe down the
shelving bank of coral and shells. But it was too heavy for him,
and, hearing their crunching steps, he turned to face them. Torre
was ahead and could see nothing but a tall dark figure, its arm
upraised menacingly. Thoroughly desperate, and grasping the long
slender spear with both hands, he suddenly gave point and ran in,
experiencing an indescribable thrill of astonishment and fear as he
felt it slip smoothly through the man's body&mdash;right through
and out at the other side. The transfixed savage stood upright a
full minute, Torre heard a weapon drop clinking on the coral, and
then, exclaiming &quot;Oh, baddambad!&quot; his opponent reeled and
fell heavily.</p>
<p>&quot;Bully for you!&quot; muttered Curtis as, stumbling up with
his knife in his hand, he heard the familiar formula. &quot;It's
that beast Snooks! Gooddamgood!&quot; And, striking a match, he
held the flame down, showing the fierce painted face of the traitor
convulsed with agony as he writhed and twisted, impaled on half the
length of the tough spear tipped with human bone.</p>
<p>And, all at once, Torre felt happier than he had done since
seeing poor Eastmore's dead face staring up at him from under the
carrying pole.</p>
<p>&quot;He's got his medicine all right,&quot; continued Curtis
gleefully; &quot;the treacherous brute knows us, too! I don't like
to hit a man down, or I'd put this knife between his ribs and 'mak
siccar.' But unless he's got a cat's lives, he's no better off now
than Brewer and the poor skipper. Come along, Leigh. That canoe's
too big for us.&quot;</p>
<p>Further up the beach they found another and a smaller one which,
launching without difficulty and hoisting the square sail of
matting, soon took them well into the bay. But they were not yet
out of danger, for a few boats full of Kuloans were about; and once
they narrowly escaped collision with a big war canoe filled with
men that was lying off watching the red glow that presently began
to crimson sea and sky and show where their homes were blazing.
Without a doubt, retribution had surely and swiftly overtaken this
bloodthirsty and treacherous people. Fairly knocked up, Torre lay
down in the canoe. Fortunately, Curtis presently discovered a big
bunch of dried bananas and a bamboo bucket full of fresh water, a
find more valuable to them, just then, than its weight in gold
would have been, for, the wind falling light, they had to take to
the paddles. Towards morning, however, it breezed up again and at
dawn they found themselves clear of the bay. But, still, in plain
sight at its head rose a column of black smoke against the fast
purpling sky in token that even yet the work of destruction was not
ended.</p>
<p>&quot;A clean sweep!&quot; remarked Curtis, as he sat at the
steering-oar. &quot;But was there ever such luck? If that other mob
hadn't come down our cake was dough to a certainty. Phew! it makes
me sweat again to think of it. Leigh, it does me real good, old
chap, to recollect the shipshape fashion in which you skewered
Snooks. And what fits those other fellows must have
got&mdash;nearly wiped out I should imagine! Say, Leigh, how did it
feel when you shoved the spear through that beast?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh! horrible!&quot; replied Torre with a shiver. &quot;I
felt as sick for the moment, and till I knew it was Snooks, as I
did when they were murdering poor old Schneider.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By God!&quot; said Curtis, &quot;that was a terrible
affair! If ever I'm skipper of a craft in these seas, and find
niggers swimming after her, I'll take poor Brown's advice and let
'em swim. How on earth a man like that, who said he never trusted
any native, came to be caught napping, I can't conceive. And the
woman! What a brick she was! Of course it was all a put-up job from
the first, with Snooks for the boss of it. Slack off your sheet a
bit, lad, and please the Lord we'll be safe on board the
<i>Pathfinder</i> to-night, if she hasn't left the bay.&quot;</p>
<p>But luck was with them, and rounding Cape Quiros with a fair
wind, late that night they were telling their story to the
Commander of the warship in the Bay of St Phillip.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the latter, &quot;we'll go round at once.
But, from your account, there's not much to be done. The other
tribe, who came just in the nick of time to save you, are probably
men from the hills whom it would be only labour lost to think of
following. And, in any case, they don't want
punishment&mdash;rather the reverse. All the same, if they'd caught
you, they'd have eaten you. I warned your Captain to be careful.
But it's always the same old story. And then we get hauled over the
coals in the Australian papers. Well, youngster, (to Torre) I'm
glad, anyhow, that you accounted for the ringleader.</p>
<p>But, now that he was safe, Torre quite broke down. The horrors
he had witnessed, combined with his own narrow escape, and perhaps
the island malaria, proved too much for him, and an hour after
boarding the <i>Pathfinder</i> he was in a high fever, and raving
alternately of Eastmore, Schneider, and Snooks. The ship's surgeon,
however, was unremitting in his attentions, and our hero wanted for
nothing that skilled help could give. Curtis, as beseemed his
maturer years and more vigorous frame, stood their terrible
experience better. But even he was very sick when the re-action
took place, and although able to get about, constant retching, and
an utter distaste for food, that lasted several days, reduced him
nearly to a skeleton.</p>
<p>On arriving, late the next day, at Kuloa, the
<i>Pathfinder's</i> people found nothing but heaps of smoking
ruins. Not a living thing was visible. But amongst the still hot
embers of the cookhouse and council-chamber, they saw great piles
of calcined human bones with here a leg and there an arm sticking
up not entirely consumed. Without a doubt, the attacking party had
collected the killed and badly wounded and throwing them into the
two buildings had set the latter on fire. A more complete
catastrophe it would indeed have been hard to imagine, for the
village and its inhabitants were virtually exterminated. Also,
before leaving, the conquerors had fired the brig which, bilged and
burnt to the water's edge, looked a hopeless, melancholy object
that one wished the sea would, in pity, take to itself and hide the
splintered spars and charred hull of the once smart and graceful
<i>Aniwa</i> fathoms deep amongst its coral groves. As there was
nothing for her to do, the man o' war at once sailed for the
Loyalty Group, at which islands she had to call ere leaving for
Sydney.</p>
<p>Long before the Australian coast hove in sight, Torre was again
well and hearty. And so taken was he with the life on board the
<i>Pathfinder</i> that, but for Curtis, he might have joined the
Service.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't be a fool,&quot; said the latter, when Torre spoke
about the matter, &quot;it's right enough here, and in a small
craft like this. But wait till they draft you on to one of the big
ironclads&mdash;and you don't know the minute that might
happen&mdash;and then you'll find the difference. Drill and sweat,
sweat and drill, it is with them. Scrub and paint and holystone;
and your hand going to your cap thirty times an hour. Besides,
you're stuck in harbour nine months out of the year, almost, in the
so-called cruisers of the Australian Squadron. No, no, Leigh! It's
all right if you enter the navy up the after-gangway. But to go
into it late, and through the hawse-pipes is, for a lad of some
education, as you are, a fatal mistake. Stick to the Red Ensign, my
boy. You've had rather a rough time, certainly. But perhaps there's
better in store.&quot;</p>
<p>So Torre took his friend's advice, and had no cause in years to
come to regret having done so.</p>
<p>In the Capital the news of the <i>Aniwa</i> massacre made a
stir. And the survivors were besieged at their quarters&mdash;the
&quot;Seamen's Home&quot;&mdash;by quite a crowd of people, anxious
to hear their story which, of course, appeared in all the
newspapers, illustrated, mostly, by such portraits of the officers
and crew as could be procured. Amongst the earliest callers was
Jenkins, who listened with horrified interest to the account of
Eastmore's fate.</p>
<p>As soon as they landed, Curtis and Torre had reported themselves
at Messrs Fibre and Co.'s office, where they were very kindly
received, and their wages paid up to the day of their arrival in
Sydney.</p>
<p>The <i>Aniwa</i>, it appeared, was fully insured at the time of
her loss. But, notwithstanding this, the senior partner was
evidently genuinely sorry for the sad end of her people, and
especially for Eastmore and Brewer. &quot;As for you, my lad,&quot;
he said to Torre, &quot;whenever you are ready I'll give you
another berth. And the same with you, Mr Curtis. But,&quot; he
added, &quot;from what I hear, you'll be able to afford a good
spell ashore, if you wish it.&quot;</p>
<p>What he meant they soon discovered. The Sydney people are
nothing if not generous. And whilst the interest aroused by the
<i>Aniwa</i> tragedy was at its height, somebody opened a
subscription for the two survivors and the family of Mr
Brewer&mdash;the only married man of the crew&mdash;with such good
results that, shortly, Torre and Curtis found themselves in
possession of &pound;100 each, and numerous offers of employment;
whilst the widow and her children received three times that amount.
But there seemed no present hurry. And Curtis, who had friends in
Goulburn, went there for a short stay; whilst Jenkins, who in his
quiet way was sincerely grieved at Eastmore's death, took Torre to
his bachelor establishment, and introduced him to many old friends
of the dead adventurer, Bohemians like Eastmore himself, the
majority of them, amongst whom Jenkins, from being in regular work,
was regarded as a sort of superior anomaly. They were a curiously
mixed lot that Torre met here&mdash;sailors, bushmen, educated
labourers, diggers, sheep and cattle men. Or rather, in their time,
they had been one or other, or all of these by turns. And now,
tired for a while of a roving life, they &quot;knocked out&quot;
some sort of a living in the Capital, by the aid of their
experiences, and pen and ink and pencil&mdash;one week perhaps
&quot;stone broke,&quot; the next with two or three pounds in their
pockets. But, in spite of all, generally contriving to keep up a
decent appearance, and never at a loss for a pipe of tobacco or a
nip of whisky. And, now and again, one would be missed for weeks
and months together, nobody but an editor or two, perhaps, knowing
his whereabouts; or an occasional published sketch now and then to
show that he was still alive. Then one day, Brown would reappear
and mention casually that he'd been doing a bit of droving &quot;up
Queensland way;&quot; or fencing, or ring-barking on some far back
station; or prospecting for gold in Westralia. Similarly, Smith
would bring his mate's or master's &quot;ticket&quot; into use, and
return to the sea for a few trips up and down the coast. If he
could get a billet aft, all the better. If not, he would &quot;take
the fok'sle for it.&quot;</p>
<p>And the talk of these men interested Torre immensely. They had,
in their time, done so much, and seen so much, and gathered so very
little except experience; and they talked so freely and openly
about themselves and their prospects, and seemed so careless of
what might happen to them at present or in the future that, as he
listened, he could almost fancy himself surrounded by many
Eastmores.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br>
AN A. B. ON THE <i>MARY ROBINSON</i></h2>
<p>&quot;I'VE got some news for you,&quot; remarked old Fibre to
Torre one morning; &quot;first, here are a couple of English
letters that the <i>Andromeda's</i> agent sent to me. It appears
they have only just discovered your identity with that of the
runaway apprentice.</p>
<p>I don't suppose they'll bother their heads about the matter. But
the <i>Andromeda</i> herself was signalled as being off Gabo this
morning. And if M'Cutcheon learns you are here, he might, just out
of spite, take proceedings against you for absconding from the
service of the firm. You see, they didn't get as much work out of
you as they expected. About the worst that could happen would be to
send you back on board her again. But you don't wish
that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; continued the old man, as he laughed at
Torre's decided negative, &quot;I think you had better get away for
awhile. The <i>Andromeda's</i> stay will be short. She's only going
to discharge, and then off to Newcastle and load coals for China.
Three weeks or a month here at the outside. Now I'm sending a lot
of stuff up to a sugar plantation on the Clarence that I've an
interest in&mdash;machinery and bricks and so on. The <i>Mary
Robinson</i> sails tomorrow or the next day. She's only a ketch.
Three men and a skipper, a dog, a rooster, a magpie, and a cat,
form the crew. It will be a new experience for you, and a valuable
one in a way. I'm going to rate you as an A. B. at &pound;6 per
month. I'd make you mate, but I can't afford to lose the insurance
through your not having a certificate of any kind. Pity you're not
out of your time! The <i>Mary's</i> lying at the foot of Erskine
Street. You might go on board after you've read your letters, and
have a talk with old Billy Horn. I fancy he wants another hand
besides yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>Both letters were from Edie, and of course written long before
she could have received Torre's, posted on the eve of his departure
for his last tragic trip. Edie's letters dealt mainly with the
uncomfortable state of things at Laurustinus Lodge, in which
Torre's departure, it seemed, had made no change except to direct
Mrs Bovey's animosity towards herself. Laban, too, was a bigger
torment and nuisance than ever, now Torre was no longer there to
defend her. But as the former was shortly to leave school and be
articled to a solicitor in Exeter, Edie thought matters might then
be better. In the second letter was news. Mr Bovey's health had
been so bad that the doctors had ordered him to Madeira for the
winter. Mrs Bovey and Edie were to go too. &quot;Thank
goodness,&quot; wrote the girl, &quot;Laban stays behind!&quot; But
afterwards, at the end, was a postscript, &quot;Oh, Torre, after
all, he is coming. Mrs Bovey refused altogether to stir without
him. In any case, there would have been little pleasure in the
change for poor father unless he and I could have gone away
together. But now that Laban is to come, it will be simply awful. I
do wish you were here, dear. Father would write, but he is not so
well to-day. Oh, Torre, how sorry I am to miss you! Where will you
go to in London? What will you do? And your ship must be just
getting ready for home now. Couldn't you ask the captain to call at
Madeira? We should&mdash;father and I&mdash;so love to see you
again.&quot;</p>
<p>Torre's brow darkened as he turned back and read some account of
Mrs Bovey's &quot;goings on&quot; towards his uncle and Edie.
&quot;She's trying to kill him and drive the girl away
altogether,&quot; he muttered. &quot;What a beast she is! Still, if
I were there, I could do nothing except make matters worse, and
they must be at Madeira long ago; but if I ever get my hands on
Master Laban I'll give him something more than he got last time we
met.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now, what are you looking so fierce for, and talking to
yourself in that unnatural manner about?&quot; asked Jenkins,
coming into the room; and Torre, feeling the want of somebody to
tell things to, and knowing how kind and helpful a heart beat under
the rather listless, insouciant exterior of his journalist friend,
told Jenkins his home-story.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; remarked the latter, &quot;I don't see that
you can do anything&mdash;just yet, anyhow. It would be of no use
your going to them; in fact you're better away. Of course it's a
pity the poor girl should be tormented by a jealous stepmother and
her cub. Pretty, you say&mdash;and fifteen. Umph! Well, you know,
you're hardly of a marrying age yet, either of you, although it may
come to that eventually, when the father&mdash;who seems by way of
being a weak-minded, poor sort of creature&mdash;dies. Always kind
to you. Yes, no doubt, but don't look for anything else from him.
That woman will take care that neither yourself nor the girl will
get much of the old chap's money. In fact it's probably all settled
upon herself now. Best thing you can do is to keep in touch with
them as much as possible and wait to see how matters turn out,
whilst pushing along in your profession.&quot;</p>
<p>This seemed good advice, and Torre who really had had some vague
notion of drawing his money out of the Bank in which Mr Fibre had
placed it and rushing off to Madeira to thrash Laban and rescue his
uncle and Edie, thought better of it, and, instead, went to look at
the <i>Mary Robinson</i>.</p>
<p>Going along Erskine Street, he saw a man he knew leaning against
a post with his hands in his pockets, and slowly masticating a quid
of tobacco, the pavement at his feet showing signs of a prolonged
stand.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Sam, old man,&quot; said Torre, halting, &quot;how
are you getting along now?&quot;</p>
<p>The man addressed turned a lack lustre eye on the lad, but gave
no signs of recognition.</p>
<p>&quot;Why,&quot; said Torre, &quot;surely I haven't changed that
much? Don't you remember me on the <i>Andromeda</i>, nursing the
baby, loblolly boy; and then stowing away on board the
<i>Yatala</i>?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, bli' me?&quot; exclaimed Sam, the Sailor, after a
prolonged scrutiny, and half bashfully extending a great, hairy,
tattooed paw, as he discharged cargo from his cheek. &quot;Now, I
reckernizes yer. But that growed, an' stout, an' strong! Why, on'y
yestiddy I was a-readin' in a noospaper 'bout a young chap gettin'
near scoffed by the niggers down in the Islands; an' I sez to
myself, I sez, a-lookin' at the pitchers, 'Well,' I sez, 'to the
best o' my belief that's the kid's name as I was shipmates with on
the 'ungry <i>Andromedary</i>. Poor Jack Eastmore I knows fer
certing, 'I sez, 'but the pitcher's too old an' 'ard lookin' for
the young 'un's.' &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was me right enough, Sam,&quot; replied Torre, his
heart warming to the man who had given him such ready and willing
help a year ago. &quot;Come and have a drink and a yarn. I've got
plenty of time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So've I,&quot; replied Sam, as he straightened himself up
with wonderful alacrity and followed Torre into a private bar,
close to; &quot;too darned much. I was just a-chewin'
bumpers<sup>1</sup> as you walked up, an' thinkin' which boat I
could best cadge a feed off.&quot;</p>
<p class="quote"><sup>1</sup> Cigar stumps.</p>
<p>&quot;Phew!&quot; whistled Torre. &quot;Spree, Sam?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On'y a small 'un,&quot; replied the other, deprecatingly,
as he poured his beer down. &quot;Six notes outer the Koonoowarra.
I got took down fer three by a speiler as I was a-makin' fer the
Home. Then, in spite, I swamped the rest at the 'Blue Anchor'
yonder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay,&quot; replied Torre, as a matter of course,
&quot;and now you're stoney and looking for a ship.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's so, sir,&quot; said Sam, as Torre handed him a cake
of tobacco to fill his empty pipe.</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind the handle, Sam, just yet, anyhow. I'm only
rated A.B. like yourself,&quot; said Torre, &quot;and on a little
boat, too. I was just going to have a look at her when I saw you.
Do you know the <i>Mary Robinson</i>, Sam?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Old Billy Horn's ketch?&quot; replied Sam. &quot;Ay, I
knows 'er, an' 'er skipper as well. Good sort, Billy, at bottom. A
bit cranky, though, a-top, till you gets the run of 'im.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, look here,&quot; said Torre, &quot;we're going up to
the Clarence. I think she's a man short. Now you rip along to Fibre
and Co.'s in York Street&mdash;Fibre, Coir and Trepang&mdash;and
give Mr Fibre this bit of a note for me. And I fancy, somehow, that
we'll be shipmates again. You did me a good turn once, Sam, and I
mean to return it if possible. The wages are &pound;6 per month. I
suppose you'd like to come.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would a duck swim?&quot; replied Sam, taking the pencilled
leaf from Torre.</p>
<p>&quot;And take this half sovereign,&quot; continued the latter,
as he finished his glass and went out. &quot;If you get the berth,
I expect I'll see you on board the <i>Mary</i>, presently. But,
anyhow, whether you do, or whether you don't, come down after
you've had a feed, because I'm bound to run you in
somewhere.&quot;</p>
<p>Sam thanked him and swung off up the street, a different man
altogether to the one Torre had found.</p>
<p>The latter was now seventeen, very big for his age, and had
already contracted the two habits, common to most seamen, of
drinking and smoking&mdash;in his case both in very strict
moderation. And, considering his opportunities, it would have been
a miracle if he had not done so. But from many points of view Torre
was not an immaculate boy. There are none. At times, even, under
the influence of excitement, he swore, and swore hard. Most seamen
do. He had never been a goody-goody boy in his best days, either.
But he was a warm-hearted, frank, truthful one; quick, ready, and
determined-looking beyond his years. His personal appearance, too,
had so much changed that Sam might well have been excused for not
recognising him. Tall, and filling out fast into manhood, he
carried himself, in notable contrast to the majority of sailors,
quite erect. And the matter of the <i>Aniwa</i>, perhaps it was,
that had brought a some what hard look upon the dark, resolute,
young face that, as its owner stepped along in his well-fitting
suit of blue serge, tanned boots, and spotless linen, made many a
buxom Jewess in that region of stale fruit and fish, tar, smoke,
steam, and waterside smells, stare after him out of softening bold
black eyes. But Torre heeded not regard of women. The memory of
Nalouna's pretty face and graceful winning ways still abode with
him.</p>
<p>He found the <i>Mary Robinson</i> wedged in between a floating
dummy pier and a 6000 ton ocean steamer. She was taking cargo from
a big stack on the wharf; and Torre for a while stood watching the
men, who, their hands protected by leathern shields, deftly caught
the bricks, two at a time in a ten foot throw, and passed them to
their mates below. The <i>Mary</i> was a curious looking craft to
Torre's eyes, the rig being strange to him. She might have been of
some sixty tons burden. For'ard, she reared, stayed bolt upright, a
very lofty lower and topmast. Aft was a very much smaller mast,
carrying only a trysail or jigger, and looking out of all
proportion to its towering fellow for'ard, on which, in addition to
a square topsail and top gallant sail, she mounted a shifting lower
yard which, when not in use, could be housed up and down the mast.
The sail for this was set from the deck, and with her three head
sails on a bowsprit that could be run in or forked out at pleasure,
must, Torre imagined, give her an overcrowded look for'ard.</p>
<p>On the fore-topmast truck shone brightly a gilded cock; from the
smaller mast floated a parti-coloured pennant. A fine retriever
basked near the after-scuttle, upon which a very large
&quot;British Game&quot; representative of the rooster aloft
perched, and lazily watched a low-set, brown, lean man dressed in a
white shirt rolled above the elbows, trousers of rusty black, and a
hard bowler hat. This individual was peeling potatoes, whilst a
magpie sat on the edge of a bucket, and one minute whistled various
tunes with exceeding sweetness, and the next snapped at the dog and
made profane remarks. Amidships was a galley, so small that one
might well make a single step through between the doors. Everything
about her was as clean as clockwork, from the brass banding of the
little wheel to the snow-white of her flush deck. She had a clipper
bow with a figure-head of an olive-faced woman in blue petticoats
which swept gracefully into the curve of the stem. Her stern was
half square, and fancifully embellished with painted flowers such
as only grow in dreams.</p>
<p>As Torre at length stepped on board, chanticleer gave a sleepy
crow, the magpie snapped at his legs, and the dog lifted his head
and looked at him. The man went on with his work.</p>
<p>&quot;Captain Horn?&quot; asked Torre tentatively, for he knew
something of coasting ways.</p>
<p>&quot;That's me,&quot; replied the other without raising his
eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;All right, then,&quot; said Torre briskly, &quot;I've come
down from the office&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No use rushin' things,&quot; interrupted the other,
without looking up. &quot;Tell the Boss we can't git off till
mornin's tide, not if the Angel Gabriel was to come along an' hurry
us through.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; replied Torre, laughing, &quot;I know nothing
about that. I was only going to say that I'm sailing with you, this
trip, if you'll take me.&quot;</p>
<p>Then the man at last lifted his face&mdash;a lean, sharp,
wrinkled, weather-beaten face, clean-shaved but for a heavy
grizzled moustache&mdash;and looked Torre all over from a pair of
small, deep-set blue eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;You've made a mistake, sir,&quot; he answered presently,
nodding towards the great steamer, &quot;but an excusable one in a
landsman. That's the <i>Haurotowa's</i> gangway round t'other
side.&quot; And he fell to work again at his potatoes.</p>
<p>For a minute Torre felt annoyed and angry, but he knew it would
not do to lose his temper, so he replied quietly, after a pause:
&quot;I'm not looking for the steamer; I'm looking for the <i>Mary
Robinson</i>, and I've found her. My name's Leigh. I was with
Eastmore in the <i>Aniwa</i>. Mr Fibre told me to come and see you.
Now I've seen you; and I'm going back to him&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why the blazes couldn't you say you was a mate o'
Jack Eastmore's?&quot; suddenly broke in the man as, starting up,
he wiped his hands on a big red handkerchief and held one out to
Torre. &quot;I thought ye was one o' them snipsnapper clerks from
the office, or else a cussed tide-waiter a-thinkin' he cud take a
rise outer ole Billy Horn! Why, I was with poor Jack in the
<i>Durham Castle</i> ten years ago, when he was only a greaser.
An', oh! wow! wow! what an endin'! Come along, young feller, an'
'ave a nip,&quot; he continued, leading the way into the cabin,
whilst the magpie flew on to Torre's shoulder and nibbled gently at
his ear, and muttered to herself.</p>
<p>&quot;I was just peelin' a few spuds to make a bit o' scous for
dinner,&quot; the skipper went on. &quot;An' so you're comin' for a
trip, eh? Well, there's no big ship style about us, y'know. Trick
an' tie, it is, 'ere&mdash;wheel an' lookout&mdash;lookout an'
wheel. Sartainly, 'Bo'sun'&mdash;that's the dog&mdash;takes a watch
now an' agen in fine weather. But Mag, an' Bolivar&mdash;the
rooster&mdash;an' Turnips&mdash;that's the cat, yonder on the
locker&mdash;is only idlers. Still, we're fair an' cumfable,&quot;
concluded the old fellow, evidently anxious to make up for his
earlier incivility, as he produced a big square bottle of rum and a
couple of glasses, disturbing in the process a huge brindled tom
cat who, yawning, arched his back and walked slowly up the
stairs.</p>
<p>The cabin was larger than Torre had expected. A single tier of
wide and curtained bunks ran along both sides of it; a swinging
lamp hung from the deck. The floor was covered with oil-cloth;
framed oleographs from Christmas supplements of newspapers hung on
the walls over the bunks. A clock ticked at one end. There were
also lockers and cupboards, and a recess to hang dripping oilskins
in, with a sort of well in the bottom of it to catch the water from
them. All very complete and natty and shipshape. And Torre's saying
so pleased her skipper.</p>
<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; he said, &quot;we're the smallest o' the push o'
barques, brigs, schooners, an ketches as Fibre an' Co. owns. But we
ain't the slowest, nor the dirtiest, nor the wettest. An' we can
find our way in an' out, an' round about, where plenty o' them
can't without goin' overland. Ketch, they calls her, but
topsail-schooner's the rating as properly belongs.&quot;</p>
<p>And, now, finding the skipper in such a good humour, Torre took
the opportunity to speak a word in favour of Sam, at the same time
telling of his kindness to him when a stowaway on the
<i>Yatala</i>.</p>
<p>&quot;Fancy I've seen the chap,&quot; remarked Horn. &quot;If
I'm not mistaken, he were once in the <i>Lady Mary</i>, one o' our
barques. Well, all right. I'll want a couple b'sides yourself and
the mate&mdash;that's him in the hold stowin' bricks&mdash;an' this
Sam might as well make one of 'em. We're both qualified for
coasting v'y'ges within the boundaries o' the colony&mdash;Mat
Bacon and me. I don't generally carry more'n a couple 'sides
ourselves. But, this trip, I'll take an 'extry hand,' cause
there'll be some heavy discharging when we get up the river, an'
nobody to do it 'ceptin' the ship's company. Well, I must go an'
get that scous ready, or Mat'll be forced to eat bricks. Remember
we tows down early in the mornin'.&quot;</p>
<p>On deck they found Sam with a letter from Mr Fibre, asking the
skipper to take him, if possible.</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said the latter as he read it, &quot;I
guess ye'd better come up to the Shipping Office an' sign, both o'
ye&mdash;say, 'bout three this arternoon. I'll be there. And if ye
knows of another chap anywhere as wants to ship, why, ye can bring
him along too.&quot; And, with this, the old man returned to his
potatoes.</p>
<p>Sam, it appeared, owed a pound at the boarding house, where his
bag and other belongings were kept in default. This sum Torre gave
him, and as he would be able to draw an advance for another couple
or so, his affairs seemed satisfactorily settled, and our young
sailor felt that he had not done a bad morning's work. It was,
however, he presently found, not quite finished yet.</p>
<p>On his way back to Jenkin's rooms, he met a man, named Harris,
who wrote stories for one or two of the weekly newspapers, and with
whose talk and personality Torre had been rather pleased. Just now,
Harris was looking, he thought, somewhat despondent; and upon the
former's asking him the reason, he told him. Said he, &quot;Well,
the fact of the matter is, I've been roaming about all day looking
for a permanent billet. I'm about full up of Sydney and the
precarious sort of livelihood one earns by literary work. Of course
I found nothing, and I suppose I seem rather glum, eh? And
now,&quot; he continued, &quot;I've made up my mind to be off up
the Bush, fencing, or droving, or something. Or, I've got a mate's
certificate; and I'm jiggered if the sea isn't better than this!
I'll quit, and get away, as I said, to the Islands or up the Bush
again, and leave ink-slinging alone for a spell. Never able to
knock that off altogether, you know. It's worse than ever smoking
or drinking could possibly be!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on!&quot; exclaimed Torre suddenly, and remembering
the mate's certificate, as the other turned to go. &quot;Did I hear
you say you'd been to sea?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eight years,&quot; replied Harris with a laugh, &quot;in
almost every craft you could name.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Torre, &quot;I'm going a trip
to-morrow&mdash;A.B. on a ketch, to the Clarence. I believe there's
another hand wanted. How would that suit you, if you really wish to
get away?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To a T.,&quot; answered the other promptly, &quot;and much
obliged to you for the show. I've got an old discharge or two. And,
anyhow, I expect I could get a permit, if needed. But, of course, I
might pass on my ticket. Only, you see, a fellow don't care about
putting that in to ship before the stick on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right,&quot; said Torre, &quot;only I must get on the
telephone somewhere, and try and ring old Horn up at Fibre's wharf.
I think I noticed a wire to a steamboat company's office close to
the <i>Mary Robinson</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's an instrument in here,&quot; replied Harris,
leading the way into a shop; &quot;I know the people; and we'll
soon find out. Let's see, Fibre's&mdash;oh! the next wharf must be
the A.B.N. Co's., No. 678; I daresay they'll call across to the
ketch.&quot;</p>
<p>And in a few minutes came back the satisfactory answer,
&quot;Horn says, 'Right! Shipping Office at three. Bring him
along.&quot; And so, all unconscious, Harris put his foot on one of
Fortune's narrow tracks. He was very pleased, and laughed as Torre
told him about the ketch and her crew. &quot;I know the sort of
thing,&quot; said he. &quot;Jack cooks the breakfast whilst Bill
takes the wheel, and skipper washes down. I've been there before
and enjoyed it. We'll wet this business. Come along.&quot;</p>
<p>But Torre refused, saying that he had already drunk as much that
day as he intended to.</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; replied Harris, &quot;I'll save the bob.
I only had half-a-crown to my name, anyhow. See you at the 'Smoke'
to-night I suppose&mdash;its Saturday, you know. I'll go home now,
and pack a bag and get a few things together for the trip. Hope
it'll be a long one.&quot;</p>
<p>Torre's preparations were soon made; for he, too, only took a
round-bottomed bag to place at the foot of his bunk, knowing that a
chest would take up more room than could be spared in the little
hooker. And duly, in the afternoon, he and Harris and Sam signed on
the ketch <i>Mary Robinson's</i> Articles in presence of skipper
and Shipping Master.</p>
<p>That evening there was a rather larger attendance than usual at
Jenkin's rooms, for the report had got about that Torre and Harris
were going away in a canoe together round the coast, and the news
interested the Bohemians. And when they heard how commonplace the
affair really was, some disappointment was shown. &quot;Still, you
know,&quot; remarked a man to Harris, &quot;there may be copy in
it. One never knows what may happen to even a sketch in these
days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very, very true,&quot; put in an artist visitor, quick to
detect the slip. &quot;One never does! It may bring a guinea, or
only ten bob.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All the same, Fairbairn's right,&quot; insisted another
gravely. &quot;One never does know what may happen, afloat or
ashore, to a man, even in these commonplace days. For instance, I
went out for a walk in Cooktown one morning, fully intending to
come South by the steamer at night; and that day week I was eating
boiled dog and grass, and potting niggers on the Palmer diggings.
So our friends may have adventures before we see them again. Well,
here's luck to 'em! And no more cannibals, Leigh!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I fancy, somehow,&quot; remarked a jovial, stout man, who
wrote Indian stories and was, when a reviewer wished to be
complimentary, called, in consequence, &quot;The Australian
Kipling.&quot; &quot;I fancy, somehow,&quot; said he, &quot;that
there will be adventures. Leigh was evidently born into 'em. And if
Harris doesn't act as a drawback, they'll get blown out to sea, or
wrecked on a desert island and build brick houses out of the cargo;
or discover a&mdash;a&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, leave!&quot; laughed the artist, &quot;Your
imagination's too limited. Why not say they'll marry cockies'
daughters on the Clarence, and settle down on the river and grow
sugar?&quot;</p>
<p>There was music, too, this night, both banjo and piano; and some
of the men sang well; so that it was far into the small hours ere
Torre and Harris got a cab and took their traps to the <i>Mary
Robinson</i>.</p>
<p>Late as it was, they found only Sam on board. The skipper and
the mate were still ashore&mdash;both at the latter's house, across
the water in Balmain. So the pair, making their beds, turned in,
never waking till daylight, by which time Sam had already lit the
galley fire and made coffee. And before the sun rose, the
<i>Mary</i>, in the embrace of a little, dirty, rattletrap of a
tug, was hurrying past the still sleeping ships and out into the
harbour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br>
BY THE SKIN OF THEIR TEETH</h2>
<p>A HOT day broke as they passed Fort Denison; and then Horn told
the tug to let go, for the wind was fair, and he could get out just
as fast &quot;on his own.&quot;</p>
<p>Abreast of Watson's Bay, Bolivar came from his roost under the
top-gallant forecastle and greeted sunrise; Mag hopped out of her
cage and perched on the boom, and whistled &quot;Polly Put the
Kettle On;&quot; Bo'sun sniffed round the galley where Harris was
frying chops and rashers of bacon; and Turnips, after his morning
toilet, came and rubbed himself amiably against Torre's legs at the
wheel. The mate and Sam were washing and scrubbing the brick dust
off the deck about the hatchway, whilst the skipper sat near Torre,
smoking a before-breakfast pipe and watching the sails.</p>
<p>&quot;Takes just a mite o' weather hellum, don't 'er?&quot; he
asked. And on Torre's replying that such was the fact, he
continued, &quot;They all does it wi' this rig. But spite o' that,
they're handy little boats. This ain't 'er best point o' sailin',
though. Quarterly wind's what she likes. It's too fur aft now. Ay,
keep 'er as she goes. Hello! 'ere's a inward-bounder in tow o'
<i>Goole No. 1</i>., an' with a long hawser.&quot;</p>
<p>And Torre, looking a little to the left, and towards the Heads,
saw a full-rigged ship, her yards braced to the wind, that, even
before he distinguished her House-flag, he knew to be the
<i>Andromeda</i>. At the same moment, almost, Sam also made her
out, and shouted to him, &quot;<i>Andromedary</i> ahoy!&quot;</p>
<p>Then an idea seized Torre, and he said to the old skipper,
&quot;Do you mind my keeping away a couple or three points, and
running close past her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sartainly not,&quot; replied the latter, &quot;keep away
as many as ye want, only don't set us ashore on Middle Head
yonder.&quot;</p>
<p>So Torre put his helm up and edged so close into the track of
the approaching tug that she screamed at him through her siren to
be off. But Torre, who was a born helmsman, had, long ere this,
<i>felt</i> the <i>Mary</i>, and knew exactly what he could do with
her. And although the old skipper looked a little uneasy, he never
moved or stopped smoking, as <i>Goole No. 1</i>., with much
objurgation, hissing, straining and snorting, went by, carrying the
tow line, now in a bight, now rigid as an iron bar.</p>
<p>There was a group of men on the <i>Andromeda's</i> bows, and one
of them, leaning over, roared, &quot;What d'ye mean, ye blasted
farmers&mdash;nearly making us let go our line?&quot; And the
speaker, in whom Torre at a glance recognised Phillips, shook his
fist at the <i>Mary</i>.</p>
<p>Old Horn removed his pipe to reply; but Sam was before him.
Jumping on the skylight and taking a double sight at the speaker
along spread fingers, he yelled, &quot;Git <i>out</i>, ye sneakin'
greaser! Garn fer a hungry ship! Oh! come out on 'er boys, afore
she kills yer dead! Bli' me! but she made a bloomin' skelinton of
me! Yah!&quot; And as she slowly drew by, Phillips' eyes met
Torre's, but without a sign of recognition in them, although, from
his angry words and gestures, he certainly knew Sam. Over the rail
amidships looked Mr Sinclair, with Munro and Campbell. And the
former Sam passed with a touch of the cap and loud, &quot;Good day,
sir; 'ope I see yer well!&quot;</p>
<p>To this the mate waved his hand, and the youngsters laughed. But
no one uttered the name of the helmsman, looking full up at them
with a host of bitter memories at his heart.</p>
<p>Over the rail aft gazed M'Cutcheon, purple-faced with passion,
as Torre remembered him more than once. &quot;Hello, farmer!&quot;
shouted Sam again, &quot;how's yer cargo this trip? Drownded any
more Dutchmen? Who's a nussin' o' the biby? Scotch an' hungry! An'
no sailor!&quot;</p>
<p>Exactly as Phillips had done, M'Cutcheon shook his fist at Sam,
and Torre could see, by the broad grin on his face, how the pilot,
who stood near, was enjoying the fun.</p>
<p>&quot;You can use a ship's wheel, young man,&quot; remarked the
skipper, as the ketch passed under the <i>Andromeda's</i> stern and
kept away again for the ocean entrance between the Heads. &quot;I
s'pose you an' Sam knowd 'er, and wanted the chance o' tellin' 'em
so, eh?&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Something of the sort,&quot; said Torre, smiling;
&quot;you see, we were shipmates together on her. I used to nurse
the Captain's baby aft, and haul coals for the cook, whilst Sam was
broaching cargo for'ard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haw! haw!&quot; laughed the old man, &quot;I knows! I used
to sail in them lime-juicers oncest. Some of 'em's fair to
middlin', an' a few's real good, but the biggest part of 'em's
simply h&mdash;ll. Now you git yer tucker, whiles I shoots her
through the Heads.&quot;</p>
<p>They ate on deck under the shade of a tarpaulin, for the sun was
hot already, with a nasty sullen sort of haze about him that, to
Torre, looked like wind. Rounding the rugged North Head, the ketch
was kept well inshore until abreast of Narrabeen, when she stood
out a little to make room for a coasting steamer with her funnel
stuck right aft, her nose cocked inquiringly in the air, and her
stern nearly awash. She was black all over except in one spot. Her
bridge, boats, masts, decks, men&mdash;all were black; but,
amidships, on the black hull, glared a ragged patch of bright red,
forming such a contrast to the black rest of her as to look almost
like flame as she surged along, a squalid, dingy blot against the
brown cliffs and the emerald green of the water.</p>
<p>&quot;The ole <i>Wild Duck</i> from Newcastle with coals,&quot;
commented Horn. &quot;Fifty year since she first smelled the briny,
if it's a week! Plates like brown paper; crowns o' her bilers all
burned away, an' the fire-bars only fit fer toothpicks. Sink me, if
I'd swap billets with Denny Mitchell, an' chuck his steam-tank in
to boot! An' her hands is never clean&mdash;black ship, black men.
An' presen'ly, one fine day, down they goes lumpus in thirty
fathom, an' gits the coal-dust washed outer their skins an'
souls.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with the yards checked, the <i>Mary</i> slid along
past a low stretch of far-reaching sandy beach. All hands had lit
their pipes. The mate was helping Harris to prepare dinner, the
former hard at work on a plum-pudding, the latter peeling potatoes
and vegetables, of which the dinghy was half-full; whilst in the
squat, motherly-looking boat amidships hung a sheep and a quarter
of fresh beef. Torre, for his own satisfaction, had been aloft
for'ard overhauling things, and now, with Sam, sat sewing a couple
of cloths into an old topsail. The skipper steered with Mag on his
shoulder, and Torre, pausing to refill his pipe, smiled as he
glanced over the homely scene, accentuated by the hospitable smoke
that poured from the little cook-house funnel; by Bolivar perched
on the skylight, and with half-closed eyes digesting his breakfast;
by Bo'sun and Turnips fast asleep in each other's arms in the
sunshine.</p>
<p>The mate, Mat Bacon, was a steady-going, elderly man, rather
taciturn, with a pleasant, grey-bearded, round face. Before joining
the <i>Mary</i> he had been boatswain of coasting steamers, but
finding it difficult to save money for the wife and six little
Bacons ashore, by reason of being so constantly in and out of port,
and the temptation of an ever open bar, he had returned to canvas,
and had now been two years in the <i>Mary</i>. He had also, it
appeared, &quot;turned steady,&quot; and was even putting a few
pounds together to buy a house of his own with.</p>
<p>&quot;Mat,&quot; remarked the skipper presently as the mate
relieved him for a spell, &quot;we're a-goin' to have a snifter
from the east'ard; an' we're deep, an' we're stiff. I been pipin'
'er these last couple o' hours, an' she's like one o' them wimmen
what you sees around the Block as can't stoop to lace their shoes
for fear o' somethin' carryin' away astern.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bricks ain't too lively,&quot; replied Mat as he watched
the water to leeward, out of which, as the breeze freshened, one
could dip a bucketful comfortably, and without leaning too far
over.</p>
<p>&quot; 'Bout as lively as salt or railway iron,&quot; remarked
Sam. &quot;An' this little hooker's got as many ov 'em in her gut
as she can carry&mdash;an' mebbe a few over!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just five ton too many,&quot; acquiesced Mat placidly,
&quot;but the Boss, there, <i>would</i> stack 'em into
'er.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sons,&quot; replied old Horn, lifting up his nose
and smelling around exactly like a dog on a faint scent, &quot;deep
or no deep, I ain't goin' to chanst it. Keep 'er away, Mat, an'
we'll lie snug to-night inside Barranjoey. She may have more'n she
can do with, or she mayn't. That's my picnic. All the same, we'll
sink the kellick on black mud an' gravel this good night of our
Lord. So make a dead fair wind of it, an' chanst the
ducks!&quot;</p>
<p>So the helm was put up, and the <i>Mary</i>, that evening, with
wind and sea just moderate, rounded into the estuary of the
Hawkesbury, and dropped anchor in a little bay sheltered by high
cliffs from any gale, blow it never so fiercely.</p>
<p>And here, long ere night fell, she was joined by a whole
mosquito-fleet of little coasters, driven by instinct to seek
refuge ere the gale had even begun to show its intention. Only a
steady easterly breeze at present. But men had noted the morning
haze, and although, without barometers or any other scientific
appliances, a long acquaintance with coastal weather signs, not to
mention certain bodily phenomena, warned them infallibly that ere
they could get inside the Heads of Port Jackson, furious winds and
seas would be their share.</p>
<p>&quot;My belly was a-rumblin' all night,&quot; remarked one
visitor to the <i>Mary</i>, &quot;an' that's a sure sign wi' me o'
easterly messers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My 'ead's been a-givin' of me jip this larst couple o'
days,&quot; said another; &quot;an' bunyins an' corns! O Lor! Only
three days out from Port Macquarie I says to the mate, 'Bill,' says
I, 'we're in fer a easterly snorter. I reckon we'd bes' run fer
Barranjoey an' lie snug till she does what she's got ter do.' But
Bill he only laughs. Howsomever, when I sees the 'aze over the sun
an' feels my toes an' 'ead achin' that much as never was, I cracks
on an' comes right in. An' whether she snorts or whether she don't,
here stops the <i>Annie</i> till that there 'aze clears
away.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus visiting skippers from ketches and fore-and-afters,
homeward bound, sculling themselves on board the <i>Mary</i> with
perhaps a square bottle of gin, or a couple of fowls, or a
&quot;quarter o' spuds,&quot; or a couple of pounds of butter, or
some honey and juicy maize-cobs, and a fine ham with which to pay
their respects to &quot;ole Billy Horn o' Fibre's <i>Mary
Robinson</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>They were for the most part, these coasting captains, an
elderly, keen-eyed, weather-beaten lot; not, perhaps, possessing
amongst them all, more than just as much knowledge of scientific
navigation as would enable them to take a meridian altitude. But,
on the other hand, their local knowledge was tremendous and,
chiefly because of this, they held their &quot;certificates of
servitude.&quot; Every inlet and creek and beach and promontory,
large or small, they had a name for, and could tell you the depths
of water about it and the snug spots in which to take shelter; and
the coasting lights from Cape Howe on the Victorian boundary to
Cape Byron on that of Queensland were as familiar to them as their
own binnacle lamps. Even when bush fires made the land nothing but
one mass of smoke, they seemed able to smell their way along it,
and they hardly ever came to grief. Some of them owned their
crafts; others like Horn sailed them for small colonial shipping
companies. But, by all these seamen of the Australian coast,
Torre's skipper was held in universal respect for the reason that
he had proved himself able to sail his boat faster, make her carry
as much cargo as a larger one, and was the oldest Captain of the
crowd, not in years but in command. Hence, the gilded rooster at
the topmast truck.</p>
<p>That night the easterly commenced to &quot;snort&quot; in
earnest. Long ere morning it was blowing a gale; by midday it had
become a hurricane before which a large topsail schooner, wanting
her jibboom and fore-topmast, came scudding for shelter like a
frightened rabbit into a burrow.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the <i>Alert</i>&quot; remarked old Horn. &quot;An'
when Jimmy Thompson with a couple o' hundred ton under his foot,
runs away from wind, it means blowin'.&quot;</p>
<p>And blow it did, until even inside that well-protected refuge,
the small craft pitched and tumbled at the anchor like mad things.
The gale lasted three days, during the greater part of which the
crew of the <i>Mary Robinson</i> kept below, one man taking a
turn-about anchor-watch to see that the ground tackle held. The
rest played euchre, overhauled their clothes, and helped each other
in the galley. Torre, in his leisure, worked away at his
&quot;Norrie&quot; and &quot;Ainslie,&quot; and Harris at the MS.
of a long sea-story, which he wrote with indelible pencil in
exercise-books, and kept in an oilskin bag.</p>
<p>The morning of the fourth day dawned clear and bright, and,
spite of the big seas outside, the clinkety-clank of many little
windlasses told that the fleet was getting under weigh.</p>
<p>&quot;Mat's right about them bricks,&quot; remarked the skipper,
as ocean saluted the <i>Mary's</i> appearance with a comber that
half swamped her, carried Bo'sun off his feet, and drenched dog and
crew impartially, whilst an indignant gurgling protest from
Bolivar's refuge under the forecastle told of salt water there
also. &quot;But,&quot; continued the old man, as he wiped his
smarting eyes on his fingers, &quot;I wasn't a-goin' to leave 'em
behind, arter blowin' to the Boss as I cud ha' took half as many
agen. Darn this head wind! Fer two pins I'd run back an' wait till
it shifts.&quot;</p>
<p>As it happened, however, the <i>Mary</i> was the only one of the
lot bound to the Nor'ard. And old Horn, disliking the notion of
returning in sight of the fleet, kept pegging away into a cross
sea, and against the wind which had hauled dead ahead, and, though
light, was enough to keep the sea up and make things the very
reverse of comfortable. Cooking of any sort was almost impossible,
the water washing knee high through the galley and into the stove;
and although constantly tacking, the ketch's progress was slow in
the extreme. Luckily, both air and water were warm; and despite
their constant soakings, no one felt any the worse. Then, one
night, the wind shifted and commenced to blow great guns off the
land. Therefore the skipper at once hove the <i>Mary</i> to under
her fore-topsail and a bit of her jigger. And, now, although dry,
her drift was so considerable that presently the coast was
completely lost sight of. This, of course, was annoying, but not
serious. As the <i>Mary's</i> leeway was due East, all that had to
be done, when a chance offered, was to steer back due West and pick
up the land again. Nothing could be simpler than that.</p>
<p>For several days this sort of thing went on. The fresh beef and
the sheep were long ago finished. And, worst of all, their supply
of salted provisions and bread was getting low; when, Torre, one
afternoon on deck by himself, looking out over the great seas that
lifted their roaring crests high above the mastheads to the
lowering sky, caught sight of a sail far away abeam. Now they
wanted to speak a ship rather urgently; for in a couple of day's,
at the outside, &quot;tucker&quot; on the ketch would be a thing of
the past. As it was, not only the pets were beginning to feel
hungry at meal times, but their masters also. Thus, Torre, getting
hold of the skipper's long telescope&mdash;spunyarn-parcelled, and
capped at each end with canvas, around which Turk's heads were
worked&mdash;stared eagerly enough through it at the distant fleck
of white that now was, now was not.</p>
<p>As the day wore on and the vessels drew nearer, or rather, as
the quick drift of the ketch brought her nearer, it could be seen
that the stranger was a barque under the rags alone of her two
lower topsails and fore-topmast staysail, fluttering from yards and
stay respectively. But, otherwise, she appeared sound enough.</p>
<p>&quot;A derelik fer a dollar!&quot; exclaimed the old skipper
with his bushy eyebrows bent like a penthouse over the telescope.
&quot;Either that, or all hands is drunk.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, night came on with a wild sea still running. Going
for'ard for something, it suddenly struck Torre that the
<i>Mary</i> was lower in the water there than she had any business
to be. Also a dull rumbling noise reached his ears from below the
fore-hatch, audible even above the roaring and screaming of the
gale. Was it imagination, he wondered, or only the continuous thump
of the seas against the bows? Stooping, he listened intently. No,
decidedly something was wrong there underneath him. And surely she
had not always been down by the head in such pig-like fashion!</p>
<p>Suddenly the meaning of that curious, grinding, swashing noise
below broke upon him. The bricks had worked loose, or some of them,
and had probably started a butt, through which the <i>Mary</i> was
taking in enough water to sink her before morning. And as he
realised what this meant, a cold sweat broke out all over him. But
he soon recovered his self-possession, and, after listening again,
and taking another look outboard, attentively watching both rise
and fall, he turned to walk aft. Bo'sun, who, with Bolivar, lived
under the little forecastle, set up a long, dismal howl as he heard
the retreating footsteps, and Torre, lifting the canvas curtain
that sheltered the entrance, the dog emerged and bolted aft like a
shot, presently followed by the rooster, running and jumping
awkwardly with outstretched neck, and wings that flapped and beat
on the ankle-deep water. Never had the animals before shown any
desire to leave their snug quarters at such an hour&mdash;for it
was now nearly dark.</p>
<p>In the cabin he found Sam and the skipper playing euchre; the
mate mending an old sea-boot; and Harris poring over his MS. Supper
had been scanty enough&mdash;only, indeed, biscuits and tea, and
not too much of either. But all their pipes were in full blast.</p>
<p>&quot;What d'ye think o' that fer a hand,&quot; said the
captain, holding his cards over his shoulder for Torre to see,
&quot;with hearts trumps?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A.1,&quot; replied Torre. &quot;All the same, I wish one
of you would bring a light while I sound the well.&quot;
&quot;Ay,&quot; said the skipper sharply, as he played his right
bower and the mate looked up from his boot, &quot;of course. But
she sucked dry as a bone this mornin'!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know she did,&quot; replied Torre, &quot;only I'm
doubtful of her doing it now, and I'd like to make sure. Will you
come, Harris?&quot;</p>
<p>At that moment down the companion flopped Bolivar, followed more
sedately by the dog, at which incursion the magpie cursed them
both, and Turnips hissed venomously just for form's sake.</p>
<p>&quot;Well!&quot; exclaimed the skipper, playing his last card
and shouting, &quot;Euchre&mdash;game!&quot; at his opponent.
&quot;What's the meanin' o' this? Dogs an' poultry's barred the
saloon. Is there a mutiny springin' up in the fok'sle, or is it
hunger a-drivin' the pore things aft. Lord knows, I could do with a
beefsteak and ingins myself just at this minute!&quot; Then Torre,
filling his pipe, told his suspicions.</p>
<p>The skipper's brown face paled a little as he listened, but he
made no remark, only rose and put on his sou'wester and oilskins,
an example imitated in silence by the rest. With a steady hand Sam
lit the riding-light, whilst Torre got the sounding rod. The sky
was bright as the men came on' deck, but the wind blew hard as
ever, and from where they stood, looking for'ard, they could hear
the slop-slop-slop of water breaking over pretty continuously.
&quot;Four feet!&quot; said the skipper, unable to repress a groan
as he examined the wet rod whilst Sam held the light; &quot;this
mornin' it was four inches!&quot;</p>
<p>Then he went for'ard with Torre. Even since the latter's absence
it seemed to him that the little craft was deeper, and certainly,
more water was coming on board, nearly each rising comber leaving
part of its crest on deck.</p>
<p>Presently, shipping the brakes in the tiny pump, they worked for
an hour in spells of two, but they only lowered the water six
inches. It was coming in nearly as fast as they pumped it out.
&quot;We might try a sail,&quot; suggested Torre, &quot;over the
bows and under her bottom.&quot;</p>
<p>And with infinite difficulty and danger they at last got a spare
foresail passed right round the <i>Mary</i>, but it made little
difference, and it soon became evident that the ketch was doomed.
So they got the 'midship boat ready, stowing their little
possessions, the scant remainder of their provisions, and so forth,
in her, all the time looking doubtfully up at the big combers that
roared expectant around them.</p>
<p>By reason of their continuous work through the night they had
forgotten all about the vessel sighted the preceding day, but at
dawn Torre discovered her some two miles away to leeward across the
heaving wastes of foam-tipped greyness, with the tattered sails
still flaring from their yards; a lump of a barque, painted slate
colour, with white and black ports. Through the glass which, in
spite of its homely looks, was a powerful one, Torre made out that
a British Ensign, Jack downwards, was flying half-way up her
signal-halliards; but not a soul, as she rolled her decks over to
his view, could be seen about them.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd sooner be there than here,&quot; said a voice at his
shoulder, and turning, Torre saw Harris. &quot;Here, certainly, is
'copy' of a kind,&quot; continued the latter, shivering&mdash;for
the morning was raw, and breakfast had been a mere
pretext&mdash;&quot;because most surely this thing's going back, or
rather down, on us. I don't believe she'll last another couple of
hours. It's on the whole a blue lookout. But I say, Leigh, don't
you think we stand a show of getting on board that
barque?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Old man's going to have a try,&quot; replied Torre.
&quot;See, they're loosing the staysail. Can't bring her to the
wind, or she'd swamp us in one act.&quot;</p>
<p>A little fore and aft canvas increased the ketch's drift so
rapidly, that in a short time it was obvious she would be almost
alongside the barque. The <i>Mary's</i> decks were now awash all
over, and the pounding noise below had increased in violence.</p>
<p>&quot;Them cussed bricks!&quot; exclaimed Sam, &quot;they've all
broked up, and is knockin' fits out on 'er at every kick. See
anybody on the barque?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a soul,&quot; replied Torre, his eye again glued to
the glass. &quot;Yes, by heaven, there is though! A
woman!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A wo-man!&quot; exclaimed Sam, as he peered under the
sharp of his hand, in a tone of disgust. &quot;Is that all? Then
our cake's about dough! Ay; I seen the flap av 'er petticoat when
the barque ruz that last time.&quot;</p>
<p>All hands were standing aft, watching the stranger&mdash;their
last chance, if indeed it could be called one&mdash;and the female
figure now plainly visible, standing near the wheel, as every
heaving sea bore the forlorn looking vessel up, rolled her slowly
over till her decks sloped steeply, and then hid her as she sank
behind its crest. As far as could be seen, with the exception of
the sails, she was sound both aloft and in her hull, the latter
showing a fine high lead-coloured, painted-port side running to the
pink composition at her bends that told of the iron ship. She
carried double topsail and topgallant yards; and but for the
flogging remnants for'ard, the rest of her canvas seemed securely
stowed. Now and again a wave would hit her amidships and send a
great storm of spray arching clear over her. Inexpressibly lonely
and pathetic to Torre, seemed the sight of that solitary figure,
standing motionless under the reversed ensign of distress.</p>
<p>Half tide rock, as she now was, the motion of the ketch was so
erratic and troublesome, that minutes elapsed ere Torre could get
the telescope steady enough to gain even a fleeting glimpse of the
woman's features. But, presently, as borne up by a huge comber, the
<i>Mary</i> hung for a second or two on its summit, there swum into
the object glass, the fair pale face of a young girl with long
brown hair sweeping away before the wind, and a pair of white hands
clutching the spokes of the wheel.</p>
<p>The vision was gone as rapidly as it came, hidden behind a great
mound of opaque billow. But as he put the glass aside, Torre's
heart beat faster, and he turned with an involuntary gesture of
appeal to his companions who stood around, hanging on to the
rigging, alternately watching the barque, and their own vessel
whose forecastle-head now only showed out of the water at
intervals.</p>
<p>Sam and the skipper chewed stolidly on their quids. The mate
stared straight ahead with a vacant far away look in his eyes.
Perhaps he was thinking of &quot;the missus an' the kids&quot; in
distant Balmain. Harris, his dark features showing darker through
his salt-encrusted skin, was holding Bo'sun with one hand, for the
dog was barking wildly at the strange vessel, and seemed on the
point of jumping overboard. Within the partial shelter of the
companion crouched Bolivar and Turnips&mdash;feathers and fur alike
rippling in the wind, whilst Mag had crept into the pocket of her
master's pea-jacket, whence, with protruding head she gave at times
a dismal croak. None of them, beast or bird, would stay below,
although, as yet, the cabin was dry and warm.</p>
<p>&quot;The boat, Captain?&quot; shouted Torre.</p>
<p>But the skipper shook his head as he shouted back, &quot;I doubt
whether she'll live. She ain't new, by chalks! I'm a-waitin' to see
how close we'll hit the barque. I'm thinkin' we'll go well to
leu'ard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She won't last much longer,&quot; said Sam. &quot;My tip's
to take the boat an' try to pull up lee side o' the ship, an' let
ketch an' bricks go to ole Nick. Presen'ly, afore yer knows where
y'are, she'll sink like a grinestun under our feet.&quot;</p>
<p>But the old skipper seemed loth to desert his vessel. With
twinkling eyes he stared aloft at the gilded fowl, letting his gaze
travel down to the half-submerged hull, pitching wearily, and as if
every pitch was to be her last. Already the boat was moving on her
chocks under the beat of a sea that had just rolled over the
decks.</p>
<p>&quot;Come along,&quot; said Harris, moving towards her,
&quot;let's have a try for something, anyhow. I'm tired! And I
reckon there's a chance for a big salvage as well as for Davy
Jones.&quot;</p>
<p>The word &quot;salvage&quot; seemed to have some effect on old
Horn, for, with a relaxing of his set expression, he too made
towards the boat, carrying Turnips in his arms, whilst Torre, after
one more long look at the barque, followed with Bolivar.</p>
<p>The lee-rail of the vessel was, by this, under water; and three
getting into the boat, the other two with very little exertion
shoved her down the sloping deck and jumped in.</p>
<p>&quot;Goodbye, ole <i>Mary</i>,&quot; exclaimed the skipper, as
he stumbled aft to the tiller, &quot;I'll never see your likes
agen. Ketch, they allers called ye, but topsail schooner's the name
as belonged. An' a good 'un at that! The pride o' the coast an' the
daddy o' the fleet&mdash;so long, ole gal!&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>CHAPTER XV<br>
A DAUGHTER OF THE SEA</h2>
<p>WITH wind and sea behind her, it took all old Horn's skill to
keep the fat-bowed boat from being swamped as they drove down
towards the barque.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't put her alongside in this sea,&quot; said the
skipper to Torre, who was pulling the after oar; &quot;she'll smash
like a hegg-shell. I'll shove her round the bows an' try to get to
leu'ard. An' then, it's a green lemon to a carriage factory as we
don't fetch her never no more, amen!&quot;</p>
<p>And, indeed, as they neared the vessel, and the boat was one
moment borne high on a level with her deck, the next down till her
pink bottom and grey topsides with their black and white streak
towered like a cliff above them, the odds seemed all in favour of
the green lemon.</p>
<p>As they pulled round the bows, they saw her name in big white
letters on her lead-coloured paint&mdash;<i>Enchantress</i>.</p>
<p>&quot;We're leakin' like a bloomin' sieve!&quot; shouted Sam,
paddling in water up to his ankles as he pulled.</p>
<p>&quot;I told ye she wasn't no chicken,&quot; remarked the
skipper, &quot;but ye would chance her. Better ha' stuck to the ole
hooker&mdash;bricks an' all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're goners, now, all right,&quot; said the mate, bending
fiercely to his oar as the boat shot round the tossing bows, and to
the lee-side of the <i>Enchantress</i>.</p>
<p>As he spoke, fake upon fake, a coil of stout line settled over
his head; and, looking up, they beheld upon the barque's forecastle
the figure of the girl who had flung it.</p>
<p>She shouted something, but the wind bore it away from their
ears. Suddenly, Bolivar, with a wild but valorous scream, shot up
into the air towards the barque. But the gale was too much for him,
and he was blown back into the water, Torre presently picking him
up, draggled and dripping, but still defiant, out of the crest of a
comber.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the girl had made her end fast, as also had the men
in the boat, in which the water was now up to their knees. It
seemed as if, despite their constant baling, she must presently
sink, so fast the sea came in through her opening seams.</p>
<p>If ever poor wretches were tantalised it was they, a hundred
feet away from apparent safety; and there they tossed hungry,
thirsty, and drowning slowly. Presently, they saw the girl dragging
at and coiling down a small hawser. She evidently mistrusted the
strength of the rope she had just hove to them. They watched her as
they baled, working with fiery energy, her head bare, and her hair
now tucked into a great heap at back and top of it.</p>
<p>Presently, she motioned them to haul in. And very carefully, and
with eyes glued to the straining, jerking rope, they pulled
themselves by it as near as they dared to the crushing walls of
iron that now crouched almost to their own level, now flung
themselves thundering and streaming on high.</p>
<p>&quot;Come up all I said afore!&quot; exclaimed Sam, as he saw
the bowline on the small coir hawser that, after many a pause and
check, at last slipped along the first line. &quot;She's a right
'un, she is! A sailor's gal that, you bet! If any feller kin
'possum along this, an' on board to 'elp 'er, why, we might save
our skins yet. Balin' ain't no good,&quot; continued he, throwing
off his coat and long seaboots; &quot;the darned boat's half full
a'ready. S'pose we hauls 'longside she'll be mashed like a bug. But
if I kin git on board and give the gal a hand, I dessay we'll
manage.&quot;</p>
<p>As he talked, Sam had been making the bowline smaller, intending
to get into it. But now Torre interfered, saying, &quot;I've got a
better chance of reaching the barque, Sam, than you. I'm a bit
lighter. I think where there's so much depending on it, we oughtn't
to take any risks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, perhaps you're right,&quot; replied Sam. &quot;The
lighter weight the better chance. No doubt on it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's an impossible thing to do,&quot; suddenly cried old
Horn. &quot;The boy shan't go! D'ye think anybody can stop on
that!&quot; pointing, as he spoke, to the surging coir that for a
minute, as the ship plucked the boat towards her with a windward
roll, stood rigid as a bar of steel, and then, as she wallowed back
again, was submerged fathoms deep in the boiling brine.</p>
<p>Mat and Harris said nothing. But from the expression on their
faces they were evidently of the skipper's opinion. Not that,
apparently, it mattered much. Their time seemed close at hand, for
the water in the boat was rising rapidly. And if they were all
doomed to perish like this within touch of safety, why, as well die
at once. That was what their faces said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know, but arter all,&quot; Sam doubtfully
remarked, as Torre stripped off boots and jacket, &quot;that a
heavier weight mightn't be best. 'Owever, ye can but try. Yer as
active as a cat; an' us old uns is stiff an' slow. See, I'll bend
these halliards on to the bowline, an' slack away 'cordin' as ye
wants it. An' she'll have the gumption to look out fer 'er end, you
bet! Now, lads, haul 'er up as close as we dar'! Wait till she
surges! Now's yer time!&quot;</p>
<p>And with a glance at the slim figure on the forecastle-head,
already handling the smaller line, Torre swung off hand over hand
up the tautened coir, making such good way that he got fully twenty
feet along the rope before the slackening of it warned him of the
impending plunge. Another moment, and as he gripped the line with
his legs, the water closed over his head&mdash;it seemed for weeks.
Then, just as he felt that he must let go to ease his bursting
lungs or die, he was plucked up panting and gasping to resume his
terrible journey. He could spare no instant to look ahead, but with
aching wrists and smarting eyes, his body still quivering from the
jerk of the straightening hawser, he managed to work himself along
and up, a gentle tugging at his waist helping him in the struggle,
with the thought of whose hands held the rope that did it, and of
whose eyes were watching him from above. His forward progress
scarcely, this time, appeared to last a second ere he was plunged
into those black depths, again to re-emerge feeling as weak and
helpless as a kitten, whilst the pain in his wrists and head grew
insupportable. Yet he strove mechanically to drag himself forward.
Lights blazed before his eyes, taking strange shapes that jarred
upon his throbbing brain. Better to let go and die, he thought,
than suffer like this! And let go he knew he must at the next
plunge. His legs hung like lead, and would be powerless to draw
themselves up and clasp the rope any more. Already he felt the
downward heave, and speculated curiously whether he would be
drowned before he could be dragged into the boat. And he settled in
his mind that he certainly would; and that, probably, his body
would jam between hawser and bowline, making a nasty sight when
doubled over and hanging limp, as each recurring jerk brought it to
the surface. It was all a mistake. He had thought it at the
time&mdash;that putting the bowline round the hawser. It gave a
fellow no show. It would have been far better simply knotted
loosely round his waist. Then she&mdash;but no, the weight would
have been too much for her. Still, it was hard to have to look so
ugly&mdash;like a dead fish in a net. Ugh! But, anyhow, he'd wait
for the plunge before letting go.</p>
<p>As these thoughts flashed across his brain, Torre suddenly felt
his arms grasped by hands that dragged at and vainly strove to lift
his weight off them, whilst a despairing voice screamed in his ear
&quot;Help me, oh, help me! or it will be too late!&quot;</p>
<p>The sound of that voice seemed to give him a new lease of life;
and, opening his eyes and looking up, he found himself so nearly at
the ship's rail that the girl, who, with a rope knotted around her
waist, leaned perilously out over it, could, by stooping, just
reach far enough to put her hands beneath his stretched and rigid
arms.</p>
<p>The ship was giving her downward roll towards the boat. But so
far had he mechanically progressed before exhausted nature put the
brake on, that he dipped only to the waist. Still, so weak was he
that, but for her cry, and the look in those eyes gazing
terror-stricken into his own, he would have been assuredly plucked
off. But the sight put fresh vigour and energy into him, and as the
ship rose again, drawing himself up, helped by the warm, soft touch
of those little hands that seemed to send the blood speeding
through his veins in thrills of fresh strength, he at last grasped
the chain that ran along the rail and rolled underneath it on to
the deck, hearing, as he did so, the roaring cheer of his mates in
the boat below him, standing deep in the water with their lives a
question of minutes. He was spent, breathless from hunger and
thirst, and the sea had stripped off his shirt, leaving him naked
to the waist, and showing his skin all scarred and bleeding. But
that glimpse of those others acted on him with more power than the
mouthfuls from the flask of strong brandy that the girl was
pressing into his hands.</p>
<p>&quot;God be thanked!&quot; she exclaimed, as she saw the colour
return to his cheeks, energy and purpose to his eyes. &quot;Brave!
brave! I feared you could never last! And now the others! What can
we do for them?&quot;</p>
<p>But Torre knew exactly what to do; and with a single glance at
the deep grey eyes and sweet face, and a few hurried earnest words
of thanks, he set to work.</p>
<p>First, he took the hawser from where it was fastened to the
bitts, and re-fastened it to the head of an iron crane, or derrick,
used for swinging the anchors inboard. Then, galloping aft, he
snatched a life-buoy from the taffrail. Then, reeving the end of
the rope which had been attached to his bowline through a
notched-block hitched to the fore-stay, he bent on his buoy and
gave the signal to haul in.</p>
<p>Those in the boat, by means of their halliards, easily did this,
the incline of the hawser being now so much more abrupt.</p>
<p>Mat&mdash;the man with the wife and children&mdash;was the first
one to get into the buoy. The pair on the barque watched him being
pressed and pushed, unwilling, by the rest. But they made him go.
Hauling his part taut through a leading block, Torre took it to a
small capstan on the forecastle-head, shipped a bar, and, giving
the end to the girl to take in slack, he hove away with a wary eye
on the buoy and its occupant. But except a good ducking, there was
no trouble for Mat, and he was soon inboard and giving a hand.
Harris and Sam, the former clutching Bolivar, the latter with
Bo'sun, came next. Last of all arrived the old skipper with, in one
pocket, a saturated cat, in the other, a half drowned magpie. With
so much weight out of her, the boat allowed the hawser to sag, also
there was no one to ease away the guy-line, and the skipper made
the worst trip of all, except, of course, Torre.</p>
<p>When Sam arrived safely, the girl had gone aft. She now returned
with a shirt and coat for Torre, and more brandy. The first thing
old Horn did, when he got his breath, was to run up to windward.
But there was no <i>Mary</i> to be seen. The last remnant of her
was the boat, now with the water brimming over her gunwale. The
skipper winked hard as he came back and took Torre's hand, whilst
his salt-encrusted, weather-worn face worked and twitched
curiously. For a moment he was silent. Then said he: &quot;My lad,
you an' this brave lass atween you ha' saved our lives. I never
seen anythin' like it, an' never will agen. It was a lucky day fer
us as you shipped on the ketch (topsail schooner was the name as
rightly belonged). An' me a-takin' of ye fer a dashed tide-waiter,
or a counterjumper!&quot;</p>
<p>The rest also tendered their congratulations and thanks to Torre
and the girl, who blushed and simply said how glad she was to see
them. Torre, now it was all over, began to feel the terrible strain
of the past hour. Quick to perceive this, the girl, putting her
hand timidly on his sleeve, said: &quot;Won't you come into the
cabin and lie down? And you must all be hungry and tired. Come, and
I'll get you something to eat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right you are, dearie,&quot; replied the old skipper, whom
the spirit had made a little loquacious, &quot;an' thank ye kindly,
for we're starvin' men. But is there nobody on board but yer own
pritty self?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No one,&quot; said the girl, leading the way aft. &quot;My
father was captain. He died two months ago. We came from San
Francisco, bound to Sydney. The mate was a Norwegian, and the
second mate a Swede. All the men in the fok'sle were foreigners,
mostly Greeks and Italians. A week ago the barometer fell suddenly,
and the men shortened sail. It blew tremendously and carried away
those sails you see there. When the weather got fine, and they were
about getting up fresh sails, they saw smoke coming from the
after-hatchway. As they took the hatches off, flames burst out. It
was night time. A panic seized them, and, without trying to
extinguish the fire, they lowered the boats. I was below in my
berth putting a few things together, and when I came on deck they
were gone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay,&quot; growled Sam bitterly, &quot;just what you'd
expec' from a lot o' Dagoes. But the fire, Miss?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When I found it was no use screaming to them,&quot; she
replied simply, &quot;I got a few buckets of water and put it out.
It was only a bundle of sails and some bales of oakum stowed away
on the fresh water-tanks. One of the men had been down for
something and let a match drop, I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, upon my word!&quot; exclaimed Harris, &quot;if that
doesn't beat everything. But come, Leigh, I daresay,
Miss&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Darnell,&quot; supplemented the girl.</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Darnell will show us a berth in which you can lie
down and rest for a while. It's our turn to work now, you
know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He shall have my father's cabin,&quot; said the girl,
showing them into a fine large state-room furnished with a swinging
cot and other sea luxuries in the way of furniture. And, presently,
Miss Darnell, returning, brought a bottle of arnica, and showed
Torre where he could find a change of clothes. But so stiff and
sore and bruised was he that, after a good wash, he unwillingly
enough found himself obliged to lie on the settee. There he dozed
off for a few minutes, awaking with a start to see that the girl
had drawn a chair to his side and was holding a basin of hot soup
ready for him.</p>
<p>&quot;I can get up quite well, thank you,&quot; said Torre,
feeling uncomfortable in the new sensation of being waited upon by
a pretty girl. But as he made the attempt he could not suppress a
groan from the pain of his swollen wrists.</p>
<p>The girl uttered an exclamation as she caught sight of them,
and, putting the soup down, hurried away to return presently with
soft bandages and some cooling lotion. And as she steeped the linen
and bound it around the strained sinews with deft, light touches,
Torre had time to take a good look at her.</p>
<p>Rather above the medium height, with a fine shapely form and
graceful carriage added to a peculiarly attractive and winsome
face, May Darnell's chief features were undoubtedly her hair and
her eyes. The former, now carefully plaited and coiled around her
head, shone like a ripe horse chestnut peering through its
half-opened husk in gleams of burnished brown and dark gold; whilst
from under the broad forehead shone deep, calm, grey eyes, which in
excitement, as Torre had seen, could sparkle and flash expressively
with their owner's emotion. Her cheeks were rather pale, but with
transient flushes that quickly came and went, and her mouth would
have been commonplace but for a short upper lip that showed a
glimpse of white teeth, and when she smiled sent two bewitching
dimples fluttering to each corner of it.</p>
<p>&quot;Now please drink your broth,&quot; she said, as she
finished her bandaging; &quot;the others are having something to
eat, and then they are going to get new sails up and bend them; for
the glass is very low still, and the gale seems
increasing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You talk like a sailor,&quot; said Torre smiling, as he
sipped his soup.</p>
<p>&quot;Little wonder,&quot; she replied, &quot;I was with my dear
father three voyages.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You saved my life,&quot; remarked Torre, somewhat
inconsequently, &quot;and I haven't thanked you for that,
yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did all I could, which was not much,&quot; replied the
girl, as a wave of sudden scarlet swept over her face; &quot;if you
had let go, I should never have been able to hold you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The very touch of your hands seemed to put new strength
and vigour into me,&quot; said Torre. &quot;Oh yes, very certainly,
but for you, not only myself, but the rest of us, yonder, would now
be fathoms deep amongst the fishes. And now, I suppose,&quot;
continued Torre, &quot;we shall sail the <i>Enchantress</i> to
Sydney, and I'll never see you any more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>Can</i> you take her there?&quot; asked the girl.
&quot;You came out of such a small vessel that I thought&mdash;I
thought&mdash;she stopped embarrassed.</p>
<p>&quot;That we were only fishermen, perhaps,&quot; put in Torre
laughing, &quot;or a lot of farmers got afloat by accident. But I
daresay Harris and myself know enough of navigation to get the
barque to her port safely, for all that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is Mr Harris the one who took the books from around his
body, and was so pleased when he found they were dry?&quot; asked
the girl, with her dimples working.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Torre gravely, &quot;that's a novel
he's writing. It'll be a very fine story.&quot;</p>
<p>She looked more puzzled than ever, as she said presently,
&quot;And you're quite a&mdash;quite young yet, are you
not?&quot;</p>
<p>Torre blushed as he replied in remonstrant voice, &quot;I'm
nearly eighteen. And I'm sure you're not very much more.
Besides,&quot; he added grandly, &quot;at sea we don't count age by
years.&quot;</p>
<p>At this she laughed outright, with a sound as of sweet bells in
the laugh of her that was very pleasant to hear.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you any relations in the colonies?&quot; asked Torre
presently, as, after taking the empty basin away, May&mdash;he
called her so to himself already, having discovered the name on a
large framed photograph that hung close to his bed&mdash;brought in
a tray covered with dainties&mdash;cold tongue, potted ham, fish,
and a couple of bottles of beer. With her came Harris in somebody
else's clothes, which were a lamentable misfit. Otherwise, he
looked well and ready for service, and behaved himself as a
gentleman in a drawing-room where ladies were present.</p>
<p>&quot;The wind's getting up stronger than ever, Leigh,&quot;
said he, &quot;but we've found a couple of spare topsails and a
staysail, and are going to bend them and keep the barque hove to.
The glass is down to 28&deg; 27&quot;. And that's no joke, you
know. She's only got six inches of water in her&mdash;as tight as a
new drum. You just lie quiet, old man, and take it easy. I'm
sure&quot;&mdash;with a low bow to the girl, which brought his
already too short trousers nearly up to his knees, and showed a
long stretch of white stocking on each leg&mdash;&quot;you couldn't
be in better hands. We've set the lower-main tops'l,&quot; he added
as he turned to go, &quot;and you'll find her a lot steadier for
it. I discovered a sextant, too, in one of the berths and got an
observation just now. Roughly, we're 300 miles off the coast. How
we must have travelled in the poor little <i>Mary</i>,
eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He seems nice,&quot; remarked May Darnell, &quot;and he
talks like a sailor. But sailors don't write books. Nor do any I've
ever seen before carry dogs and fowls and things to sea with
them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's an all right chap,&quot; replied Torre with a jealous
inflexion in his voice that made the girl smile. &quot;And
everybody writes books nowadays, you know. But you haven't answered
my question yet about relations?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only an uncle on my mother's side,&quot; she replied.
&quot;And he lives far away from Sydney on a station. But I've only
seen him twice. He seemed very kind. He was in London about two
years ago; and the <i>Enchantress</i>, as we all thought, being
berthed for Sydney, he intended returning with us. However, when
her destination was altered to Valparaiso, he sailed in another
ship called the <i>Andromeda</i>!'</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, oh!&quot; suddenly exclaimed Torre, who, without much
interest in what she was saying&mdash;for uncles didn't count in
his ego&mdash;had been watching those pretty hands cutting his food
into dainty pieces that he could fork up without pain to his
wrists. &quot;And, please, what was your uncle's name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;John Barker,&quot; replied May, &quot;but I forget the
name of his station. Are those bandages too tight?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a bit,&quot; replied Torre, &quot;but it's funny how
things turn out, isn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>And, as he ate, he told her about his visit to Ngori, and how
the Barkers had sold it and gone.</p>
<p>&quot;Then,&quot; said she, as he finished, with a quiver in her
voice, and a little sob, &quot;I haven't a friend left. My mother
has been dead some years&mdash;and father&mdash;oh, my dear father,
how could you leave me all alone?&quot; And the tears sprang to her
eyes, whilst Torre in great distress, and with a boyish
impulsiveness and daring that became him well, taking her hand,
exclaimed, &quot;Never mind, dear May. Don't cry. You can't be
alone when you've got me.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br>
PUBLIC CHARACTERS</h2>
<p>WHEN, late in the afternoon, and after a good sleep, Torre went
on deck he found the <i>Enchantress</i> hove to under a lower
main-topsail and a fore-topmast-stay-sail, and making fine weather
of it, hardly wetting her decks. But the gale still blew from the
same quarter with unabated vigour and spite. And Torre, as he stood
near the lashed wheel and stared out over the ceaseless procession
of great waves marching in endless ranks, threatening, roaring,
sullen, breaking in thunder against the ship only to hurl harmless
spindrift at her mastheads; as he watched these, and listened to
the shrill steady yelling of the wind through the rigging, he
thanked God in his heart for their almost miraculous escape from
the sinking <i>Mary</i> and from the crazy boat. Sam was on the
poop. The rest were asleep. The reversed Ensign had been hauled
down, and all the running gear tautened; yards braced to the wind;
every sail looked to, and its gaskets re-passed. And now, Torre
found himself appreciatively gazing along the decks of a fine
clipper barque of some 1200 tons, with high, sheltering bulwarks,
teak decking fore and aft, iron lower masts, and yards able to
spread, from the squareness of them, a great show of canvas. All
her furniture, such as wheel, binnacle, skylights, deckhouses,
capstans, etc., etc., were solidly handsome, and Torre guessed
that, even in these days of depreciated &quot;sailers,&quot; the
<i>Enchantress</i> was a very valuable ship.</p>
<p>&quot;An' jist to think o' them cussed Dagoes a-runnin' away an'
leavin' of 'er like they did!&quot; said Sam, rolling up with a
short pipe, bowl down, between his teeth, but from which, in spite
of that precaution, the gale robbed, now and then, live sparks and
sent them flying to leeward. &quot;Well, well, it's bin a good
thing fer us, an' I expec' there's salwage outer this job. She's a
rale slap-up sort ov a ship. One comfut, them jokers as cleared out
in sich a hurry, an' leavin' the gal to drownd an' burn, is pritty
well drownded themselves now&mdash;an' p'raps burnin', too,&quot;
he added reflectively. &quot;Would ye believe it? They must ha'
hopped outer their bunks, by the look o' things in the fok'sle, an'
straight into the boat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shall we be able to work her home, Sam?&quot; asked
Torre.</p>
<p>&quot;Under short canvas,&quot; replied Sam, &quot;I reckon we
oughter. She's chuck full o' patents. Patent capstings an' patent
winches, an' sich, as 'elps to make pully-hauley come light. But
bli' me!&quot; he exclaimed suddenly, staring at Torre with a sort
of unbelieving wonder in his eyes, &quot;who cud ha' thought as the
kiddy we stowed away in the ole <i>Yatala</i> that time would ha'
med the man you's gettin'! When I see yer a-grippin' an' a-clawin'
an' a-hangin' to that there coir like a shot 'possum to a gum limb,
I sez to meself, sez I, ' 'E's a goner, poor chap! I ought to ha'
took an' did it, an' not run 'im on to tackle sich a contrak, which
was only fit for a man growed!' I sez. But,&quot; continued Sam
with energy, &quot;there's many a man growed couldn't ha' done it,
nor wouldn't ha' had the 'eart nor the stummick to start at it. An'
I was proud as a dog with a tin tail or a bloomin' coach with five
wheels when I seen you done it. An' when the young lady arsted me
why we sent the youngest of us on that perilous hexpadition I up
and sez: 'Why, Miss,' sez I, 'beggin' yer pardin, because 'e was
the best man we had.' An', you bet, she's a brick every
time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She is,&quot; exclaimed Torre, immensely pleased, as he
shook Sam by the hand, &quot;and you're another!&quot;</p>
<p>Under the break of the poop, snug and sheltered from wind and
spray, were the rest of the castaway crew of the <i>Mary
Robinson</i>, sleeping off their fatigues on full stomachs; Bolivar
and Mag each perched on the weatherboard at the cabin door, heads
tucked away under their wings; Bo'sun coiled up on a grating with,
as usual, Turnips between his legs purring softly in his
dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;A rum lot,&quot; commented Sam, as he and Torre walked
for'ard; &quot;bli' me, if that ere dog didn't hang on to me like a
Crischun when we was comin' through the smother, an' took his
duckin's when we went under without a whimper, although I were
werry near losing him oncest. Pore ole skipper! He's got 'em all,
anyhow, if he has lost the <i>Mary</i>. Gates o' Heving, how proud
he was o' them there square yards which 'adn't never oughter ha'
been!&quot;</p>
<p>The gale took two days to blow itself out By that time they were
in Lat. S. 32.20&quot;, Long. E. 180.15&quot;, or some 450 miles to
the eastward of their port. But the wind coming from the
north-east, they presently set topsails and lower topgallant-sails.
And as even under that short canvas the <i>Enchantress</i> reeled
off eight knots, it was considered wise, weak-handed as they were,
to err on the side of safety. They kept no regular watch. But there
was always a man on the lookout besides the one at the wheel. The
balance of them slept about the decks anywhere, ready for a call.
As if to make up for former bad usage, however, the weather
remained beautifully fine. Harris and Torre checked each other in
their calculations, and there was no recognised skipper. It was a
majority crew. And the system worked well, perhaps because there
happened to occur no crisis which might severely have taxed its
capabilities. In a few days Torre was himself again physically,
mentally he was head over heels in love with May Darnell. But, for
the matter of that, so were all hands from old Horn to Turnips, and
they were all her most humble servants, rushing at a word to do her
bidding, but oftener anticipating it. Never was princess ashore
better served and loved than this pale-faced princess at sea.
Torre, as Sam put it, was undoubtedly &quot;the Right Bower.&quot;
And May ruled him, now, with a matronly protective air that
maddened him, now, with a maidenly confidence that enchanted him.
She had her sad moments, too, when, with wet eyes, and quivering
lips, she shut herself up in her berth; and then her subjects trod
lightly and spoke in hushed accents, for they knew she was thinking
of her father, the dead Captain, and feeling her loneliness in the
world. But more often o' nights she would sing to them, and play on
the cottage piano in the saloon, old songs&mdash;songs of love, and
war, and the sea&mdash;until Sam and the skipper and Mat, listening
down the open skylight, would furtively rub tarry knuckles into
watery eyes under cover of the darkness, and vow to each other, in
hoarse, salty whispers, that it was &quot;slap-up, A. 1,
copper-bottomed an' enuff to melt the 'eart of a
grinestun.&quot;</p>
<p>These three fought rather shy of the saloon, which was a fine
sea-parlour enough, with its carpets and lounges, panelled walls
and swinging trays, Rochester lamps, and spirited paintings of
other clippers belonging to the same line as the
<i>Enchantress</i>.</p>
<p>But Torre and Harris appreciated the luxury of it, and felt at
home there, delighting in their meals at the hand of its mistress,
always fresh and dainty, and always ready to welcome them with a
smile and a glance of heartfelt friendliness out of those wonderful
grey eyes of hers.</p>
<p>Harris had long ago &quot;sacked&quot; his heroine in
&quot;Watch Ahoy!&quot; and substituted May; and with such success
that the book bade fair to become all May and little else. But
Torre was not jealous now, for quite lately Harris had confided to
him a tendresse of long standing that he had formed for a little
girl who worked as a typewriter in a government office in
Sydney.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted her to marry me long ago,&quot; said Harris,
&quot;but Annie's got some sense. 'How can we do it on ten
shillings a week?' said she. 'That's my income. And I'm afraid
yours, take it all the year round, isn't much more. No, it would be
madness to marry. You must wait until I get a rise, or till you
write a successful book!' That's what she said,&quot; concluded
Harris with a sigh; &quot;and&mdash;you know&mdash;well, I'm afraid
I'll die a bachelor.&quot;</p>
<p>Long ere this, Torre had told May the story of his life since
leaving his comfortless home with the Boveys, omitting, however, as
may be judged, any reference to Nalouna. And May, as she listened,
breathless and shuddering, with him in the &quot;boot&quot; at the
Kuloan village, followed in sympathetic interest his wanderings
with Bralga through the heart of Australia, or laughed at his
earliest experiences of all as &quot;a young gentleman&quot; on
board the <i>Andromeda</i>, could not help feeling that this
handsome, masterful, big-limbed lad who spoke so well, and upon
whose features at times sat an expression of resolute gravity
beyond his years, was to all intents and purposes more of a man
than other men with age and beards in their favour.</p>
<p>Besides, the girl felt a proprietary interest in Torre ever
since, by the clutch of her small hands and the sound of her voice
in his closing ears, she had called him back from the roaring wells
of death to effort and life.</p>
<p>Therefore, these two were fast friends, if nothing more, in a
very short time; and, in return for his own, May Darnell's simple
story was soon told. Born at Deal, her earliest recollections were
of the sea and ships. When she was only thirteen her mother died,
and Captain Darnell, with no near relatives of his own, and the
only ones belonging to his wife being in Australia, thought the
best thing he could do was to send his little daughter to a
boarding school between trips. And there she stayed till she was
sixteen, when he took her to sea with him. Until this last most
unhappy voyage, May had never known a sorrow. Secure in the care of
an indulgent father, and loving the sea very dearly, she had been
perfectly happy, so happy that the Fates had thought it time to
interfere. Then, her father, rising from a sick bed, rather than
let his ship sail without him, had taken her to San Francisco, his
health appearing to improve on the trip. At that place, the crew
deserting, a nondescript lot had been shipped. A week out and the
Captain had suffered a relapse, only lingering a few days before
the end came. He was buried in the usual manner. But, and May's
voice grew tremulous as she came to this part of her story, and her
eyes filled with tears, something must have been neglected, for
during three days, the corpse followed the ship upright in its
hammock-shroud. All the time a gale of wind was blowing dead ahead,
and the sight so demoralised the crew that they were fit for little
afterwards. They said there was a judgment on the ship; and at the
very first spurt of flame from the after-hatch, officers and men
had rushed wildly for the boats. A sad story of superstition and
cowardice combined, but not by any means a solitary one of its kind
in the curious records of ocean.</p>
<p>The crew had taken little or nothing in the boats with them in
the shape of provisions or water, and must, Torre supposed, have
inevitably perished in the furious gale that sprung up almost
directly they left the vessel. Her father, added May, held a share
in the <i>Enchantress</i>, but to what extent she was ignorant.
Also, she had heard him say that the cargo was a valuable
one&mdash;worth forty or fifty thousand pounds.</p>
<p>One day, jogging away under short canvas, they were overtaken by
a great white steamer that hoisted signals, and wanted to know if
she could help them. In reply they hoisted their number and asked
to be reported. A hurried council had been held whilst the steamer
was yet far astern, and a resolution come to that, as they were
getting along very well, no assistance, if offered, should be
accepted. The crew of the <i>Enchantress</i> wanted to take her in
themselves, and as none of them were in any particular hurry, the
weather seemed set fine, and they expected to make the land in a
couple of days, it was determined to risk it, so they had their
answer ready.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the <i>Warrimoo</i>&mdash;'Frisco mailboat,&quot;
remarked old Horn. &quot;Either her or the <i>Miowera</i>. Can't
mistake 'em, with their white wall-sides, an' yaller, black-topped
stack, set square like a factory chimbley. She'll report us in
Sydney all right to-morrow afternoon 'bout three o'clock; but that
won't ease the Boss's mind much as to what's gone with the
<i>Mary</i>. They'll ha' gived us all up fer lost afore this,
though, I 'spect. Ay, she were insured pritty well, I'm
sartain,&quot; continued he, in answer to a question from Torre,
&quot;but insurance don't build a boat like her over agen. If we
gets anythin' outer this business, I'll not be takin' any more sea.
I swallered enough salt water on that there trip from the boat to
last my old karkuss the rest av its days. Yah, I kin feel it
a-rumblin' in my belly yet!&quot;</p>
<p>The steamer turned out to be the <i>Warrimoo</i>, and as she
passed at a distance of about three quarters of a mile, Torre, and
May also, little dreamed that they had a friend on board her who at
that very moment was saying to the first officer: &quot;Well, I
wish you could have stopped; the Captain of that vessel's my
brother-in-law. I was coming out in her one trip. However, I
suppose she'll be in port presently.&quot; &quot;Well, seems to
me,&quot; replied the other, laughing, &quot;that she ain't in any
partic'lar, express, gilt-edged hurry. Should reckon he waan't a
very slick skipper as runs her, or else there's something crooked
in the deal. However, he says he's all serene, and we've got the
mails, an' must make this raft snort, as it is, to rise to time.
Should like to oblige, but you'll be seein' your relation in a
week, if he don't crack on too much.&quot; And the Yankee
chief-mate turned away to continue his flirtation with one of the
lady members of a theatrical company who, as they expressed it,
&quot;were coming across to see if they could rake in any beans at
the Anti-podes.&quot;</p>
<p>One effect of this business, however, was that, as on the second
day after the <i>Warrimoo's</i> passing, and whilst the
<i>Enchantress</i> was leisurely making in to sight the Heads of
Port Jackson, a stain of smoke appeared on the horizon, and
presently a big tugboat was churning and foaming abreast of her.
The consignees, it seemed, were getting anxious over the prolonged
passage, and on the American steamer reporting their vessel under
short canvas in such weather, they feared something was wrong, and
sent the Commodore to look for and bring her in.</p>
<p>It is doubtful, however, whether anybody was glad to see her.
Torre certainly was not. The last week had passed so pleasantly;
everything was so comfortable; it had been a regular deep-water
picnic; and now he would probably lose May, certainly lose the
constant companionship in which he had begun to so thoroughly
rejoice. As for the rest, they had nothing particular to do; plenty
of good things to eat and drink, a fine ship under foot, which they
had been instrumental in saving, and a possible large reward to
look forward to for doing so. Therefore, when the Captain of the
tug roared for a line no one rushed, in big ship fashion, to heave
him one; and he was about to repeat his demand, astonished at such
apathy, not less than at such a meagre show of canvas twenty miles
from land on a fine summer morning, when old Horn poked his head
over the rail and sang out, &quot;How do, Jim? What's all the row
about? Don't know whether we're justified in takin' steam so fer
out, 'specially as I'm exempt.&quot;</p>
<p>The tug skipper's open mouth opened still wider at this; but,
presently recovering, he said, &quot;Why, Billy Horn, we thought
you was drowned in the ketch. Did ye all get picked up, then, by
this sleepy limejuicer?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She warn't a ketch,&quot; replied the old Captain testily,
&quot;an' you knows it, Jim Schofield. An' we didn't get picked up.
We picked up. An' we left the ole <i>Mary</i> fer a swap.&quot;</p>
<p>At this moment Bolivar flapped on to the rail with a loud,
sturdy, cock-a-doodle-doo; and through an open port Bo'sun pushed
his big head inquiringly as if to ask what all the laughter was
about. Torre stood at the wheel. May was below; and Sam and Mat had
joined old Horn at the gangway.</p>
<p>&quot;Where's the Captain, Billy?&quot; asked the tug man,
glancing along their faces, &quot;I can't stop foolin' 'ere all
day. I'm glad you're right, o' course&mdash;an' that's Mat Bacon,
ain't it? How's things, Mat?&mdash;but look slippy an' sling us a
line. Ain't there any skipper, or what's up, at all?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're all skippers, Jimmy,&quot; replied old Horn.
&quot;Everybody's ekal on board this ship. It's a lim'ted li'b'lety
kump'ny. She's a salwage&mdash;a fair an' square salwage. An' we're
the salwagees. Now d'ye tumble? An' here's yer line. An' hook on as
soon as ye likes. But just send us a couple o' hands over to 'elp
stow that canvas. We're short, as you can see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right y'are,&quot; said the other, &quot;you shall have
'em. But my wig! ain't this a go! 'Ere's the Boss comes to me in a
'ell of a flurry an' sez, 'Skipper,' 'e sez, 'rip along outside fer
twenty or thirty mile,' 'e sez, 'an' see if ye can pick up a lump
ov a painted-port barque called the <i>Enchantress</i>. Weld an'
Co.,' sez 'e, 'the agents, is in a devil of a scot sence the
'Merican boat reported 'avin' seen 'er under topsails with a fine
fair wind a-blowin', an' 'er a fortnight overdue.' An,' lo an'
be'old yer, away I comes hotfoot,&quot; continued the tug Captain,
shaking with suppressed laughter, &quot;on'y to find ole Billy Horn
an' the dog, an' the bloomin' rooster&mdash;an', ay, by God! the
magpie&mdash;an' two or three more haristocrats o' shellbacks in
charge as salwagees! Well, don't it beat the world! You bet it
does!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I should smile!&quot; promptly replied Mag, who had
perched on the old skipper's shoulder whilst the other was
speaking.</p>
<p>Shortly after this, the pilot came on board, and was every whit
as much tickled by the story as the tug skipper had been. And all
of them looked with interest and admiration at May, whilst not
forgetting to congratulate Torre on his plucky conduct.</p>
<p>That afternoon they anchored in Neutral Bay, and were boarded a
little later by a good many people to whom the evening newspapers
had already given a garbled version of the affair. Amongst the
visitors were Mr Fibre, Curtis, Jenkins, and to Torre's and May's
surprise and relief, Mr Barker who, with his family, had arrived in
the <i>Warrimoo</i> the day before. The squatter was very pleased
to see Torre again, and carried his niece and the latter ashore at
once to his hotel; whilst Fibre took hold on the business of seeing
that the interests of the salvors were properly protected, pending
legal decision. The others stayed on board the <i>Enchantress</i>,
with the exception of Harris and Mat, the former of whom hurried
off to visit his sweetheart, and the mate to his family at
Balmain.</p>
<p>Mr Barker, who had liked Eastmore and was genuinely shocked at
his fate of which, however, he had already heard, asked Torre to
tell the story of his tramp to Ngori and his later adventures to
himself, his wife, and daughters&mdash;a nice motherly woman and
two handsome jolly girls already engaged, one to a wealthy
squatter, the other to a city doctor&mdash;and who all three took
to the young sailor, so that amongst them, both he and May at once
felt quite at home.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people,&quot; commented the squatter, as Torre
finished, &quot;can't find adventures even when they go and look
for them. Others can't walk down the street without running up
against 'em. You're one of that sort, evidently. And I fancy, too,
that you stand to make some money out of this last one. However, we
shall see presently. Yes, perhaps you'd better go to your friend's
and dress; but be sure to come back and dine. Bring Mr Jenkins with
you too; and your shipmate, Harris, if you can find him; and we'll
all go to the theatre afterwards.&quot;</p>
<p>And now commenced for Torre a very pleasant time indeed. The
Barkers had taken a house at Manly, and Torre was so constantly
there that it was like a home for him. Indeed, he was pressed to
take up his quarters there altogether, but, afraid of encroaching,
he returned to his old room at Jenkins', where the Bohemians met o'
Saturday nights and made much of him, and pressed him jocularly to
lose no time in setting forth again to make more copy for them. Of
course they had, all of them, tried their hands, both artistic and
literary, at the <i>Enchantress</i> episode, with the result that
Torre was become quite a feature of Sydney; and had even been
congratulated by Vice-royalty itself. Also, he was presently to
receive, at the hands of the same august personage, the gold medal
of the New South Wales Life Saving Association. More, the
enthusiastic public of the Colony had declared with one voice that
he should, in due course, marry May Darnell. Letters appeared in
the newspapers advocating the measure, and showing how cheaply the
young couple could keep house. Often the correspondent enclosed a
sum of money as the nucleus of a fund whose interest was to be
devoted to helping Torre on in his profession. All the country
over, an admiring interest in himself and May sprang up and grew
steadily, much to their distress, both disliking so much notoriety
but finding it impossible to ignore the kindly intentioned folk,
who seemed determined to have a finger in their future. The
presentation of the medal took place in the great hall of the city,
which was crammed to suffocation, and the affair passed off very
successfully. Torre made a little modest speech in which he took
occasion to refer to his companions who, all four, at the same
time, received silver medals and a money present as well. It had
never occurred to Torre, in his few sentences deprecating so much
praise being given to himself, and asking that some of it be
shifted from his shoulders on to those of his shipmates, to mention
May. In such a place and before such crowds of people the thing
would have been distasteful to him. And, in any case, he knew that
she, as well as himself, had already had quite enough of this
well-meant publicity. But others thought differently, for no sooner
had Torre finished, than every one saw that old Horn was in heavy
labour with a delivery of words. Rising from his seat on the
platform where Harris had in vain tried to secure him, and
producing a great handkerchief, he first wiped his face carefully
all over, and advancing a few steps, shouted at the top of his
voice in a succession of sea-roars audible almost in the street
outside :&mdash;</p>
<p>&quot;Ladies an' gents 'ere to-night, there's been a lot o' soft
soapin' an' jammin' goin' on among us, but some one's been forgot.
Fair play's fair play, ain't it? (Shouts of delighted assent.) Well
then, I've only got to put one leetle question to you. Wheer would
any one ov us ha' been if a sartain young lady (I won't mention no
names, as I'm told,&quot; glaring at Harris, &quot;that it ain't
manners. An' any'ow, I 'ope such won't be needful). Wheer, I says
agin, would us ha' been now if 'er 'adn't hove us that line as we
was slippin' away to loo'ard, like a banany skin down a gutter, eh?
That's what I wants to know.&quot; (Hear! hear! and immense
applause.) Encouraged, the old sailor came further forward still,
and shaking a horny finger at the audience, continued: &quot;An'
who, I wants to know, when the young 'un was 'bout clewed up, an'
swingin' like a monkey on a fore t'gallant stay over them bilin',
roarin' combers, skreeked in his ear-hole to pluck up 'eart, an'
twisted her purty leetle 'ands aroun' his waist? An' I wants to
know&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>But he got no further, for the three thousand people simply
roared as one man at that last pathetic touch, whilst the old
skipper, still shaking his crooked finger at them, was pulled back
to his seat by Harris. Mutilated though it was, it undoubtedly
remained the speech of the evening. And when the Mayor called for
three cheers for &quot;The Young Lady,&quot; they were given with
an enthusiasm that seemed to shake the vast building, and satisfied
even old Horn. But Mr Fibre whispered to his neighbour, who
happened to be Mr Barker, &quot;Old ass! There goes five thousand
at least off the salvage money!&quot;</p>
<p>He thought that such a public confession of assistance in saving
the <i>Enchantress</i> by one on board of her, would have helped to
invalidate very materially the salvage claim. Wherein, however,
ultimately, he was proved not to be correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br>
SOME CITY SAVAGES</h2>
<p>THE usual gathering that night at Jenkins' was larger than ever.
Torre, coming in late with Mr Barker, was hailed from all parts of
the smoke-cloud by voices imitative of old Horn's &quot;What I
wants to know;&quot; and allusions to &quot;a monkey on a
thingumbob stay.&quot; Torre's companion was well known to more
than one man in the room, and therefore received a hearty welcome
to Bohemia. Not a few there could talk stock and station and
pastoral business generally, and knew almost as much about it as Mr
Barker; therefore the squatter was in no danger of being bored by
literary shop, and enjoyed the experience mightily. Suddenly,
amidst a chorus of surprised &quot;Hello's!&quot; a policeman put
his white-helmeted head into the room, and peered cautiously about
him.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry to throuble yez, gints,&quot; said he doubtfully,
&quot;but if there's wan o' ye as is called Lay here, it's afther
lukkin' for him that Oi am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No Lays here, my man,&quot; replied somebody, &quot;nor
Pays either. Perhaps though it's a whis-kay you're after.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Brennan?&quot; asked Jenkins, who knew him,
&quot;that's you? What business are you on now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jist this, sorr,&quot; replied the officer, producing a
document and handing it over, &quot;an' if ye can help me to dhrop
across the person mintioned therein Oi'll be obligated. Oi'm
towld&mdash;from inforrmation resaved, sorr&mdash;as it's loikely
it's here Oi'd be afther foinding him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Leigh!&quot; exclaimed Jenkins in surprise as he
glanced at the paper, &quot;this is a warrant taken out for your
apprehension, on a charge of absconding from your indentured
service. It is issued by Alexander M'Cutcheon, Master of the ship
<i>Andromeda</i>, and seems all thoroughly in order. But, Brennan,
you should have known better than to choose such a time for serving
it on one of my friends.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Begob, thin, sorr,&quot; replied the other apologetically,
&quot;if Oi'd knowed it was a frind o' yourn, Oi'd ha' let the
Sargint sarve his own dhirty warrant, so Oi wud! But he sez to me
(thank ye koindly, sorr, but Oi'll take it nate) sez he, 'Jist run
up to 61,' sez he, 'Brinnan, an' see if ye can dishcover an owner
for this piece o' paper, bekase Oi've to get back to the station at
oncest,' sez he.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, nonsense, Brennan,&quot; replied Jenkins sharply,
&quot;you must have known these were my rooms. Take the thing away
and let Goulburn serve it himself. I did him a good turn once, and
I suppose he didn't care about coming up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Loike enough, sorr,&quot; replied Brennan, &quot;an' shure
its plazed Oi'll be to obligate ye, Misther Jinkins, seein' as it's
besht to kape on the roight soide o' ye newspaper gints (the laste
taste o' wather wid it this toime, sorr) as there's no tellin' what
ye moight be sayin' about us poor bhoys in the foorce. Thank ye,
gintlemin, an' a good night to yez.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; remarked Mr Barker, &quot;that's only staved
off. But I didn't think old M'Cutcheon would be such a
fool.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's the second mate who's at the bottom of it, I
expect!&quot; said Torre, his face on fire; indignant and
humiliated at the petty spite that must have prompted such a
proceeding at such a time.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't trouble yourself, my lad,&quot; said Mr Barker
kindly, &quot;I had to interfere once before to bring Captain
M'Cutcheon to reason, and I fancy I can manage our old friend
again. Anyhow, I conceive it to be more of the owners' business
than the skipper's.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied a young barrister who happened to be
there that night, &quot;I think not. Captain stands in <i>loco
parentis</i>, don't you see? and if he really insists on having
Leigh back, he'll get him. Penal offence, I'm afraid, absconding
from an indentured apprenticeship. And he only lacks a few months
of being out of his time? It's a pity. But doubtless the matter can
be arranged.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll have a try, at any rate,&quot; replied Barker;
&quot;of course the warrant will have to take effect, but I don't
mind laying odds that there'll be no appearance from the
ship.&quot;</p>
<p>There were no takers, but much pleasure was expressed at this
view of the case, and all sorts of professional assistance
volunteered, literary, artistic and legal&mdash;the barrister
aforesaid declaring himself as only too pleased to take up the
matter, if necessary, and put it through from the Water Police
Court to the Supreme one, and thence to the Privy Council.</p>
<p>&quot;Capital bit of practice it would be, too,&quot; he
remarked with a longing sigh as he puffed at his pipe; &quot;and
practice is exactly what a good many of us want just now. No
curious little incidents happened on the passage out, I suppose,
Leigh,&quot; he continued, &quot;that would bear working up against
M'Cutcheon and Company. I only ask because it appears to me that
incident follows as naturally and surely in your wake as night does
day.&quot;</p>
<p>Torre laughed at this and looked at Mr Barker, but left the
query unanswered.</p>
<p>Next morning the squatter, taking Torre with him, went to see
his friend, the agent of the <i>Andromeda</i>.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't be bothered with M'Cutcheon any more,&quot;
concluded Mr Barker, after briefly narrating some happenings of the
outward passage that we are already acquainted with, &quot;but I
will not have my young friend here worried into Court if I can stop
it. You can put the screw on the Captain, Moore, and tell him that
unless&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Captain M'Cutcheon to see you, sir,&quot; announced a
clerk at this moment.</p>
<p>Mr Moore grinned and looked at Barker.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes; show him in,&quot; said the latter. And presently
in walked Torre's old skipper to whom the irate squatter at once
and abruptly put the question:&mdash;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you going to appear against your late apprentice,
Leigh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; replied M'Cutcheon stormily, &quot;an' sae ye're
mixin' yerself up in my beesness agen, Mister Barker? An' what for
should I no appear, gin it pleases me to dae't? Ye're a' makkin' a
wonnerfu' clamjamfry aboot the puir feckless airticle. But when we
get him on boord the ship I'll be takkin' some o' the stairch oot
o' him, I'm thinkin'! The domm'd young scoondrel to assault my
officer an' then rin awa in siclike fashion! My feth, when they
send him doun frae the Coort I'm afeard his skin an' the eend o' a
rope'll be vera closely acquent,&quot; and the Captain showed his
teeth.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not afraid of any such thing!&quot; all at once
exclaimed Torre, rising, tall and broad and sturdy, and glancing at
the skipper with a very unfriendly eye.</p>
<p>And still, as the other gaped in surprise at the speaker, he
evidently did not know him, for he presently went on: &quot;Weel,
if you're any relation o' the lad's, a' I've got to say
is&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, skipper,&quot; said Mr Moore, laughing, &quot;he must
have changed a lot if you don't know it's Leigh himself. Don't look
much like a subject for a rope's end, does he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; remarked Barker, who also could not forbear
laughing at the amazed expression of the Captain's face as he
stared disbelievingly at Torre, &quot;I thought it better to bring
him, so that he might hear the understanding I hope we are
presently coming to. Now, in the first place, did the owners
instruct you to go so far as applying for a warrant? From what I
know of them&mdash;no offence to you, Moore&mdash;I should think
they'd rather say, 'A good riddance; we've got the premium!'
&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was told to use my ain discretion in the matter,&quot;
replied the skipper sulkily, &quot;an' it doesna seem to strike ye
that the firrum ha' lost his sairvices for the time. Pairsonally
I'm nae carin' muckle gin I never see him ony mair, but as ye'll
obsairve there's ithers to conseeder in the matter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Captain,&quot; put in Mr Moore with scant ceremony,
for a shipmaster, more or less, was of precious little account in
the office of big merchants like Moore, Devine and Co., &quot;my
time's money. Mr Barker, here, has told me in confidence, of
course, about certain things that occurred during the outward
passage, and intimated his intention&mdash;if you persist in
appearing to your warrant&mdash;of making them public through the
press. Also of instituting an action against you for condoning a
felony in respect to that cargo-broaching business. You had no
right whatever, as you may recollect I told you afterwards, to take
that money from the passengers and let the crew go free. Of course,
as agents for your firm, we're anxious to do our best for you, and
my advice is that you agree not to trouble your late apprentice any
more. From what I hear, he has done very well indeed for himself
since he left you; is in good hands now, and will probably in a few
years be master of a ship himself.&quot;</p>
<p>But still M'Cutcheon, although distinctly perturbed and
impressed, hesitated. The real fact of the matter was that he would
not have gone to the trouble he had done if fifty paint pots had
been emptied over Phillips, or all his apprentices cleared out in a
body, and for himself he had by this time quite forgiven Torre his
refusal to nurse the baby. But Mrs M'Cutcheon had neither forgotten
nor forgiven, and she it was who had persistently egged her husband
on in the affair. She was nothing if not spiteful, and she
desperately wanted to show Torre that she had power to revenge what
she considered a personal insult of a very terrible character
offered to her before the passengers.</p>
<p>Thus her husband was in a quandary.</p>
<p>Quarrel with his agents he dare not. It meant very likely the
loss of his berth to do so. Quarrel with Barker and provoke all
manner of reprisals he was equally loth to do. But to return and
confess to his wife that he had been beaten, he was perhaps more
unwilling than all to do, she having developed a tongue whose
length and sharpness he alone was aware of. So he sat and scratched
his head, and perspired freely, gazing helplessly at the others
who, on their part, naturally enough put his hesitation down to
spite and stubbornness.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you brought out Mr Leigh's indentures?&quot; suddenly
inquired Moore.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I hae na them wi' me,&quot; replied M'Cutcheon
sullenly.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, you silly man!&quot; exclaimed the agent,
&quot;that's the first thing you'd be asked for in Court. Well,
upon my word! And you have the cheek to take out warrants for
people!&quot;</p>
<p>Now, whether this assertion was a fact or not, M'Cutcheon was
ignorant; so, actually, was Moore. But the skipper saw his way at
last, and his face, to the puzzlement of the others, grew bright
and hopeful. He had a good and valid excuse, after all, to present
to his better half.</p>
<p>&quot;A'richt,&quot; he said suddenly, seizing a pen, &quot;I'll
take it on my ain shouthers to give him a free discharge. Dom a'
owners' apprentices! They're a nuisance!&quot; And, with this, he
hastily dashed off a note to the effect that Messrs Derrick,
Deadeye and Scupper forebore any claim they might hold over their
apprentice at present or henceforward; inserting at Mr Moore's
suggestion, also, a note of Torre's service on board the Andromeda.
The paper was signed by both Moore and Barker as witnesses, and
Torre gave a sigh of relief as it was handed to him. Whilst
M'Cutcheon, with a curt &quot;Guid mornin', sirs,&quot; left the
room.</p>
<p>&quot;Caved in all at once, didn't he?&quot; laughed Moore.
&quot;There's something in the background that we know nothing
about. But, anyhow, that's settled. Mr Leigh can appear if he's
called upon, but nobody else will. And now,&quot; he continued,
turning to Torre, with whose appearance he seemed rather taken,
&quot;I've got an offer to make you. You want nine months of your
time running out, it seems. If you like you can sign on as third
mate of a ship we have here waiting for wool. She'll be, probably
between this port and filling up at Adelaide, a good six months
yet. Then, if you wish, you can go home in her and pass the Board
in London. How will that suit you? Oh! I should tell you that Mr
Fibre was here the other day and spoke very handsomely of you,
regretting that he had no vessel in at present. He seems to think,
by the way, that your share in the salvage money will be something
considerable. But I fancy the case won't be decided here. It will
have to go home to the Admiralty Court. I shouldn't wonder if
you're not there about the same time.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Moore's offer was a kind one, and Torre accepted it
thankfully. He could, it appeared, be put on the
<i>Cumberland's</i> Articles at once, although the vessel herself
was in dry dock.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, Leigh, it's just possible,&quot; remarked Mr
Barker as they left the office, &quot;that this salvage money may
be enough to enable you to give up the sea altogether, should you
wish to do so. Of course, it is too soon to speculate on any
certain amount. Still, I shouldn't wonder if it turned out to be a
good few thousands of pounds.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And even then I don't think I should leave the sea,&quot;
replied Torre. &quot;I'd like to sail a ship, and have an interest
in her too. I could do that if I had capital. But I expect,
by-and-bye, that I'll go into steam. I've begun to read up a bit
already. Perhaps my highest ambition is to be Captain of one of the
big liners.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I don't see why you shouldn't realise it,&quot;
replied Mr Barker. &quot;Goodness knows you've plenty of
time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should like to send poor old Bralga something,&quot;
said Torre presently. &quot;I shall never forget that money in the
dictionary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see what can be done for the old rogue,&quot; said
Mr Barker thoughtfully. &quot;He's never happier than when whaling
along the bends of the rivers without a penny. I'll tell you what
you might do, though. You'd break his heart if you sent the money
back. But you could send that portrait of yourself&mdash;the black
and white one that Spurritt did&mdash;together with a full
assortment of hooks and lines, all shapes and sizes, and a new
'dic.' Send the parcel to Peter Robson of Tapoloro&mdash;the man
who fixed you up after that snake business&mdash;and he'll see that
Bralga gets it. And won't he be a proud old scamp that
day?&quot;</p>
<p>Curiously enough, not long after this, and just as Torre had
despatched his consignment, augmented by a good double-barrelled
breech-loader and a supply of ammunition, both he and Mr Barker had
occasion to remember Bralga, and be grateful for certain lessons
given by him in those same river bends. The pair had been spending
the evening on board a big steel steamer whose Captain was a cousin
of Mr Barker's. The vessel was lying at the foot of Margaret
Street, and they were hurrying <i>via</i> Church Hill to catch the
last boat for Manly.</p>
<p>Half-way along the Hill they met a &quot;push,&quot; consisting
of some half dozen larrikins who proceeded to &quot;deal it
out&quot; to them in the most approved fashion.</p>
<p>Sydney, at any time, is a badly-lighted city. It is especially
so in the vicinity mentioned, and the &quot;push&quot; was upon
Torre and his companion almost before they saw them. It was
composed of young men between eighteen and twenty, and one, making
a grab at Mr Barker's watch-chain, was promptly knocked head over
heels with a stiff left hander from Torre, who, with his back to a
wall, took the brunt of the assault.</p>
<p>Mr Barker was stout and easily winded, had also partaken fully
of the S.S. <i>Crozet's</i> hospitality, and was, therefore, not
capable of doing much more than valiantly poking at the enemy with
his umbrella, and shouting, &quot;Hi, police! fire!&quot; But Torre
drove right and left amongst them with such effect that soon cries
arose of &quot;Stowsh 'im!&quot; &quot;Git some metal an' plug
'im!&quot;</p>
<p>Luckily there were no stones handy, but presently a big fellow
running up made a hit at Torre with a heavy stick, which, had it
taken effect, would probably have ended his seafaring or any other
career. Luckily, Mr Barker interposed his umbrella, breaking the
fierce blow which, even then, catching Torre on the shoulder,
nearly brought him to the ground. But the next moment, jumping out,
he executed a favourite trick of Bralga's that the latter had
taught him for just such an occasion. Drawing back his foot, he
kicked the ruffian on the knee, and as he leant over with a howl of
pain, Torre's fist shot out and &quot;landed&quot; him on the nose
with such force that he came down full length on the pavement, his
head hitting it a crack perfectly audible above the volleys of
oaths and yells by which his companions encouraged each other.
Still, matters were decidedly unpromising. Mr Barker, his umbrella
broken, had been beaten to his knees, and one of the larrikins was
attempting to garrotte him, whilst another was busy at his pockets.
Hearing an agonised gurgle, Torre, free for a moment after his
victory, turned just in time to send the strangler to the ground by
a well-directed blow between the eyes. Then, quickly putting his
arm over the stooping fellow's neck, he punched away at his face
until he roared, &quot;Gorblime! O, Gorblime!&quot; in a voice that
echoed along the deserted streets. By this time one of the
&quot;push&quot; had returned from a spot, where, some distance
away, the kerbing was being taken up, with a supply of their
favourite weapon&mdash;blue metal. And this soon began to fly.
Torre was nearly stunned by a piece that hit him on the temple, as
the cowardly brutes stood and pelted at short range. Mr Barker had
not recovered enough from the effect of his choking to be able to
make a run for it; and yet Torre could see, nearly equidistant from
where he stood, the lamps of two big hostelries, the
&quot;Grosvenor&quot; and &quot;Petty's&quot;; and realised that
their only chance was to reach one or the other of them.</p>
<p>As yet he had uttered no cry for help, but, as the stones came
thicker and thicker, he suddenly yelled &quot;Police!&quot; at the
top of his voice. At that moment the Post Office clock chimed
eleven, and catching sight of some dark forms issuing from
&quot;Petty's,&quot; he shouted again, feebly seconded by his
companion.</p>
<p>The big fellow on the ground, now recovering consciousness,
tried to creep away. But Torre, suddenly conceiving an idea, and
calling on Barker to help him, first jumped on the brute to keep
him quiet, and then with the squatter's assistance, raised him to
his feet and used him as a shield, against the hail of stones,
that, as with Torre's arms round his throat and Barker's round his
knees they could feel plumping into their shelter who, at every hit
faintly groaned, &quot;Gorblime!&quot;</p>
<p>Very luckily, they had behind them an angle formed by two dead
walls, and, but for the cover afforded by these, it would doubtless
have gone hard with them. There was no moon, but the stars gave
light enough for their assailants to take very fair aim; also their
missiles did not always hit the feebly struggling shield. However,
just as matters began to look desperate, a rattle of feet was
heard, and three or four men burst upon the larrikins, whilst a
voice familiar to Torre shouted, &quot;Give it 'em boys! Break the
beggars up!&quot;</p>
<p>But the push did not wait, and, delivering a last shower of
metal at their assailants, scattered and fled, as Curtis&mdash;for
he it was who, with some friends, emerging from &quot;Petty's&quot;
at &quot;shut up time,&quot; had heard Torre's cries for
help&mdash;came up. Not till then did Torre and his companion
release the fellow they held who, falling to the ground, was
promptly sat upon by Mr Barker.</p>
<p>Presently, as Torre was explaining matters, a constable strolled
on to the scene and placidly wanted to know what all the row was
about. Then Mr Barker gave him a bit of his mind in such fashion
that the officer began to realise that if he didn't shift himself,
he might lose his jacket. So, using his whistle, in a curiously
short space of time two others appeared. Then a sub-inspector
arrived who took all their names and addresses, and opined that the
larrikin in custody had got &quot;more than he could carry.&quot;
Indeed, an ambulance stretcher had to be procured before he could
be moved; and then only to the hospital, groaning dismally at every
bump.</p>
<p>&quot;I know him,&quot; said the sub-inspector cheerfully, as
they wheeled their prisoner under a lamp; &quot;he's the leader of
the 'Rock's push.' But he's got a dingbat that'll stop him from
leading anything for a very long time. You two gents had better put
up at the hotel to-night, I expect, seeing you've lost the last
boat, and got a bit mauled into the bargain.&quot;</p>
<p>So, with Curtis, who decided to do likewise, they went in and
had a wash and something to eat and drink, and their cuts and
bruises looked to.</p>
<p>&quot;By gad, sir,&quot; said Mr Barker to Curtis, &quot;it
would have been a case with us if you hadn't turned up. I'm
convinced the police never would.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's said,&quot; replied the other, &quot;that they're
very scared of this particular push, and give them a wide berth, if
possible. It was the greatest chance in the world my being here.
Some Goulburn friends and I had strolled down from the Tivoli to
this place, where they're staying. Of course we heard the row going
on, but there were a lot of people drinking and talking, and
somebody said, 'Oh, it's only the pushes on the war path, having a
go in amongst themselves.' So, naturally, we didn't bother. Then
eleven struck, and when I got outside I heard a voice I was almost
certain was Leigh's, and I ran back and mustered up my crowd. And
jolly glad I am, too! Why, these brutes, Leigh, are nearly as bad
as the Santo men, aren't they? But that was a lovely idea of making
the beggar into a cover for you. I'm blessed if he'll get over it
in a hurry.&quot;</p>
<p>And Curtis was right, for it was three weeks before the often
remanded case came on, and William Porter, alias
&quot;Slinger,&quot; &quot;The Kid,&quot; &quot;Dead-bird,&quot;
and a dozen other titles, was sent up for three years
&quot;hard,&quot; a sentence which took any starch out of him that
might have remained; for he scarcely mustered voice enough to
mutter with a dazed look at the magistrate, his inevitable
&quot;Gorblime!&quot; Mr Barker and Torre were complimented on
their resistance and capture; and in return the former mentioned
that, in spite of its being an illegal act, he always intended,
henceforth, to carry a revolver when out after dark. To which the
Stipendiary Magistrate who knew him, whispered, &quot;Fool not to
have done it before, Barker. I always do.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br>
THIRD OF THE <i>CUMBERLAND</i></h2>
<p>Shortly after his encounter with the &quot;push,&quot; Torre
received letters from both Edie and his uncle, dated from Funchal.
The latter wrote in a querulous strain, complaining of Torre's
leaving his ship; and the waste of so much money, and hinting
plainly that there was no hope of pecuniary help to come. In fact
Mrs Bovey's hand was visible throughout the letter, and
emphatically so in the postscript in her own writing which ran:
&quot;You have disgraced yourself and us too. We want nothing more
to do with you, and both Mr Bovey and myself and son hope we may
never set eyes on you again. And you may trust me to see that you
never get another penny from us.&quot; (Which considering that
Torre's outfit and indenture money were strictly his own, was, to
say the least, a cool way of stating matters.) Then she went on to
say, &quot;I always knew&mdash;and Mr Bovey is now forced to quite
agree with me&mdash;that you would never do any good for yourself
in the world. Disobedient, wilful, quarrelsome boys, never thrive.
All your life you will be, in spite of the generous start Mr Bovey
gave you, a scapegrace and a wanderer, and to that fate we leave
you.&quot;</p>
<p>In her letter Edie said that Mr Bovey had now fallen so
completely under the control of his wife as to be even more of a
mere cypher than ever. His health, too, was not much improved; and
there had been some talk of their going on to either the Cape or
Australia in search of the drier atmosphere that his disease
required. She said little about herself, or her stepmother and her
son. But Torre could, reading between the lines, see that the
girl's life must be well nigh intolerable. &quot;Laban,&quot; she
wrote, &quot;does nothing but lounge about and smoke and drink and
gamble. He has made the acquaintance of a Spanish Count who has his
yacht here&mdash;at least he says it is his&mdash;but it seems to
me to be owned by several &quot;noblemen&quot; of different
nationalities who make themselves at home with us, and win the
money that Laban gets from his mother who is very much impressed by
the long titles of these people, and seems unable to see their
personal uncleanliness and most disagreeable habits. Our house is
called the Casa San Marino and, as I write, there are three
Spanish, Portuguese, or Italian grandees (I really am not sure what
they are) drinking brandy, and smoking cigars, and winning the
foolish fellow's money whilst poor dear papa dozes, regardless of
everything, in his chair, and Mrs Bovey smirks and looks on with
pride. Of course I may be mistaken, but I cannot take these men at
their own value, nor the dirty little steamer that lies close under
our windows as a pleasure yacht. One of the men, Don Sebastian del
Ojos de Corrientes, has invited us all, as some poor return for our
hospitality, to visit his estates in Uruguay; and I verily believe
he will persuade Mrs Bovey to go. Oh, how I do hate that greasy,
unclean creature! I think, dear, you did quite right to run away
from the <i>Andromeda</i> and the miserable menial work they put
you to. I haven't forgotten how, when we said goodbye to you, you
were all over lampblack and oil. I must smuggle this letter to the
post as I am forbidden to write. Mrs Bovey read papa's letter to
you, and told him beforehand what to say. But, oh! Torre, I should
like to see you. Perhaps if we come to Australia we may yet
meet.&quot;</p>
<p>There was much in Edie's letter to give Torre food for
reflection. And Mr Barker, to whom he showed it, quite agreed with
the latter's opinion that the Bovey's had fallen in with a party of
adventurers. &quot;It's bad for the girl, of course,&quot; said Mr
Barker, &quot;but I don't see how you can do anything&mdash;just
yet, at any rate. She's only sixteen, and, unless you kidnap her,
perfectly out of your reach or control in any way, even if you were
on the spot, which you are not. Have patience, and you may be able
to attend to this business later. At present you've other fish to
fry.&quot;</p>
<p>And so Torre had, undoubtedly, if not quite in the sense that
his friend meant. In these days, before joining the
<i>Cumberland</i>&mdash;of which, to his great pleasure, he
presently heard Curtis had been appointed mate&mdash;May Darnell's
deep grey eyes and winsome face had found ample time to complete
the work begun on the <i>Enchantress</i>. And on the girl's part
there was no difficulty; for, when Torre told her of his love she
frankly confessed that he was more to her than any one else in the
world. And when May Darnell said a thing like that she meant it
with her whole heart and soul. Thus, the wish of the people of New
South Wales, who were still sending in their subscriptions to help
carry it into effect, seemed in a fair way to be realised. May was
eighteen, Torre half a year older; and the pair, being practically
alone in the world, did not see why they should not get married at
once. But here motherly Mrs Barker intervened. An engagement she
did not mind. Of anything else, however, she would not hear. True,
she had married her Jack when both of them were even younger than
Torre and May, but that wasn't a case in point. 'To begin with,
they were Natives; and the Australian-born folk often married very
early'&mdash;too early she thought now. She had (shaking a finger
at her husband) seen lots of men since that she liked better than
Jack, and couldn't have them because she was already tied up and
done for. Then they both had plenty of money, which
also&mdash;though these young people mightn't think it&mdash;made a
difference. She didn't believe in long engagements, certainly. All
the same, her niece wasn't going to marry for at least two more
years, by which time Torre might reasonably hope to be able to keep
a wife and family. &quot;Which means, I suppose,&quot; she
concluded, &quot;in the long run, as you're both so fond of the
sea, a ship to live in&mdash;not by a long way my own idea of
comfort.&quot;</p>
<p>But Mrs Barker's interference ended there, and Torre and May
were much together in those weeks by the sea. The Fairy Bower knew
them, and Rock Lily and Narrabeen, and all the pleasant spots
around; for Torre, after the fight on Church Hill, had gone to live
altogether in the fine house fronting the Ocean Beach that the
Barkers had taken for the summer, and before going up country again
to a big station the squatter had bought near Forbes.</p>
<p>And May, though at times grieving sadly enough for the loss of
that father who, until now, had been all in all to her, still let
her youth and health have sway, and these, fostered by the sweet
accompaniments of a first love, made the girl almost beautiful.
And, also, when Torre complained of her aunt's tyranny, she soothed
him, and dutifully tried to make him see the wisdom of
waiting&mdash;a matter that, nevertheless, heretofore, she had not
been particularly impressed with herself.</p>
<p>&quot;I really do think, Torre,&quot; she said, in one of their
talks, &quot;that what with my poor father's share in the
<i>Enchantress</i>, and your salvage money, and the subscription
people are collecting&mdash;which I don't like the idea of taking
at all&mdash;we shall be presently quite well off. And you must
'hustle around,' as the American mate we had once used to say, and
get a ship, so that I can come with you, and look after
you&mdash;second mate, chief, and then Captain. And I'm sure, with
our money, there'd be no trouble in getting a billet once you had
your certificate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I imagine I should like a steamer best, dearest,&quot;
replied Torre, &quot;and you know I've been reading up pretty
constantly of late. The big companies don't often care about the
captains taking their wives with them, but, if one has a share in
the vessel or a few hundreds in the concern itself I think that
makes a difference. But in any case, May, I'm not going to wait
until I'm a skipper before we get married. That would be too rich a
joke.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I think chief would be about fair,&quot; replied May
meditatively. &quot;Can you do chief's work, Torre&mdash;correct
your chronometers by lunar observations, find the bearing of a
cyclone centre, and all that sort of thing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think so,&quot; replied Torre; &quot;in fact, I've gone
through lots of Masters' papers without any trouble. But I must get
really practical work. I half wish the <i>Cumberland</i> would lose
everything above the lowermasts going home.&quot; And he
laughed.</p>
<p>It was curious talk, as Mr Barker, catching fragments of it now
and again, told his wife, for a pair of engaged lovers. But Mrs
Barker only laughed and said, &quot;Why, what's the matter with it?
You don't think they're going to do their billing and cooing before
us, do you? Depend upon it there's plenty of that at odd times.
They've got lots of sentiment about them. In their way I think
they're practical too. May's a born sailor; so's Torre. They'd
never settle down on dry land with comfort. And if their joint
imagination can picture nothing better but sailing the sea in
company, why then, Jack, it's a harmless ambition, and one that
should not be hard to reach. I like that boy,&quot; continued the
good lady, &quot;although perhaps just the least bit too grave and
cool for his age. But I suppose the way he's had to shift for
himself and the rough times he's gone through account for that.
And, if he wasn't a sailor, and had taken to our Bella or Agnes,
before they were fixed up, I'd have been pleased enough. However,
as it is, May can have a home with us till he's got one to take her
to&mdash;a ship, I suppose, is their highest notion of home. Just
fancy, Jack!&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Barker laughed. &quot;Sounds funny,&quot; he assented.
&quot;Still, I only wish I could shove the fellow along faster. It
does seem such a crawl to have to wait years perhaps before a
capable youngster like that can be master of a vessel. Both Curtis
and old Fibre say that he'll be fit to take charge of one after
another twelve months or so at sea. I owe him something, too, for
the way he stood up for me against that push of larrikins. It's all
very fine, Jane, making light of it as he does, but if it hadn't
been for him you'd have been a widow, my dear, and on the lookout
for another victim.&quot;</p>
<p>For reply his wife came over and kissed him. Then, said she,
&quot;Jack, I suppose we've got plenty of money, haven't
we?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lots, old woman,&quot; said her husband, affectionately
pinching her yet round and unwrinkled cheek. &quot;When you
gammoned sick at Ngori, and made me sell the place so that you
could go home and see the Queen, we made a clear &pound;60,000.
Well, that's all to the good yet after buying Stockman's
Valley.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I've been thinking,&quot; she replied; &quot;why not
buy Torre a ship and have done with it?&quot;</p>
<p>Her husband started; then he laughed. &quot;Well,&quot; said he,
&quot;after all, you can't beat a woman when she does make up her
mind to do the thing properly. Have you any notion what one of the
things cost?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not the remotest,&quot; answered Mrs Barker; &quot;but not
so very much I should imagine&mdash;empty, of course.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No more have I,&quot; said her husband; but I'm blessed if
I don't ask Moore the first time I see him. I have an idea, though,
that a good one isn't to be picked up for a song. However, my dear,
you're a clever woman, and I'll speak to Moore about it. And now
you'd better call the two sailors in off the beach. It's getting
late, and I think they've had time enough to talk about logarithms
and latitudes and things. Bella and Aggie are asleep long
ago.&quot;</p>
<p>The <i>Enchantress</i> still lay at anchor at Neutral Bay with
old Horn, Mat, and Sam on board her. But presently came a
communication from the owners in which, whilst intimating their
perfect readiness to pay fair salvage, they asked that the cargo be
discharged and the ship sent home wool-laden as primarily intended.
In exchange for this concession they offered to insure the vessel
and her present cargo up to half of the full estimated value, in
the names of the salvors, or agents they might appoint in
Sydney.</p>
<p>This, after much advice and discussion was agreed to, and thus
it seemed very probable that the <i>Enchantress</i> and the
<i>Cumberland</i> might be sailing for London about the same
time.</p>
<p>The latter vessel was out of dock long since, and taking in
deadweight in the shape of lead and copper ore, tallow, etc., etc.
Torre found, on joining her, which he did when May and the Barkers
went away to Stockman's Valley, a large steel ship of 1800 tons,
built almost exclusively for a cargo-carrier, and possessing very
little passenger accommodation. Curtis was already in charge, and
he told Torre that, as yet, he did not know of any Captain having
been appointed.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, no; she's not exactly a beauty,&quot; replied his
friend in answer to a remark of Torre's, &quot;but she's as strong
as a castle. Look at the thickness of her plates. If she got on a
reef she'd break it up, instead of being the other way about. By
the way, I want you to overhaul everything aloft from lift-eyes to
brace-pennants. I don't like the look of some of that wire. There's
a bo'sun&mdash;a real good man&mdash;and three A.B's. aboard. I'll
be busy seeing the stiffening taken in; besides it's time you did
something. Can't be always a celebrity, you know. It doesn't pay.
Oh, I say,&quot; continued Curtis, as he and Torre paced the broad
decks, and the latter noted the massiveness of everything on board
from the steel-rounded turtle-back aft to the steel, spike-like,
stumpy bowsprit and jibboom in one for'ard, &quot;Oh, I say, I
heard Mr Barker asking Mr Moore the other day in an off-hand way if
he had a ship he could sell him. Well, Moore said he had. 'There's
the <i>Cumberland</i>,' said he, 'we bought her simply because we
wanted a bottom at the moment, and she was for sale cheap.
Otherwise, we're not shipowners.' 'Why,' said Barker, 'that's the
very thing. That's the ship young Leigh's already on. What's her
figure?' 'Oh,' replied Moore in a joking sort of way, 'take her for
seven thousand as she stands.'</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; continued Curtis, laughing, &quot;old Barker
considered a bit; then, says he, 'Moore, I drew &quot;Carbine&quot;
in Tattersall's Big Sweep on the Melbourne Cup yesterday. Therefore
I can afford to pay for my fancy. And in any case, sweep or no
sweep, I should have done it.' And, with that, he whips out his
cheque-book and asks for a pen. 'Hold on, man,' cries Moore, 'I
thought it was only a joke. What in blazes do you want a ship for?
The <i>Cumberland's</i> not a station, remember.' 'I know that,'
says Barker impatiently, 'but the old woman and myself have made up
our minds to do something for Leigh, straight away. What with
examinations and service, and one thing and another, it'll be
years, probably, before he'll have a ship of his own. Besides,
there's a girl in the case, and if he gets this <i>Cumberland</i>,
don't you see they'll have a home to go to at once.'</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Curtis, &quot;Moore simply roared. I was
sitting in the small office close to them, and they knew I could
hear, so he called me in and asked me to explain things. And, of
course, I had to tell the old chap that matters couldn't be done
like that at this time of day. Nobody would insure the ship; an
unqualified man wouldn't be allowed to take a crew to sea; no
merchants would trust him with their property, and so on, and so
on. But Barker was a good deal disappointed, and swore it was hard
lines a man couldn't do as he liked with his own. Still, you know,
you are a lucky beggar to have a fellow willing to plank down a pot
of money like that for you. Shows what Barker'll do when he takes a
fancy to a chap. I suppose you don't know that he got me this
billet. And, if I can pass for Master this time at home, old
Fibre's promised me the <i>Gladiator</i>&mdash;you've seen
her&mdash;2000 ton steamer. New Caledonia and Fiji. All through
Barker, of course, but you were the beginning of it. If it hadn't
been for you I'd never have met Barker and should be pottering
about the coast still in some little dug out or other, very
likely.&quot;</p>
<p>Torre was deeply touched by what Curtis told him. And now he
knew why Mrs Barker, before they went, had asked him so seriously
whether he had quite made up his mind to stick to the sea, begging
him to think it over carefully and give her an answer next morning.
Also hinting that, should he alter his views, she would not only
abate a year of the two fixed for his marriage, but promise him a
small station, well-stocked, as a start for a land life. And then
May and he had discussed the question together, ultimately deciding
in favour of the sea they both loved so well.</p>
<p>&quot;It's no use, Jack,&quot; said Mrs Barker to her husband;
&quot;they've made up their minds. Of course we could give them the
money, but that won't do. They wouldn't know what use to put it to
at present. The only thing is to keep an eye on them and see how
they get along. Meanwhile, I'm going to take May about with me and
show her other men. Now Bella and Agnes are both so soon to be
married, I shall have time for a trip to Melbourne and Hobart after
I've seen you safe at the Valley. Serve young Leigh right if he
loses her. He that will not when he may&mdash;you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Keep your hair on, dear,&quot; had replied Mr Barker,
laughing, &quot;and fly around as much as you like, and trot out
the pick of your paddocks; but I'll bet you a new dress for the Cup
against a penny whistle that you don't make that sea-girl forget
her sea-boy.&quot;</p>
<p>To Torre's great surprise, although the matter came about
naturally enough, the new Captain of the <i>Cumberland</i> turned
out to be no other than Mr Sinclair, ex-chief officer of the
<i>Andromeda</i>, who, tired of waiting for promotion with D. D.
&amp; S., had applied to Mr Moore for a berth. Sinclair had always
been friendly to Torre, although the latter, not being in his
watch, saw little of him in the now old days of his first voyage.
And, at any rate, he was a first class seaman and a gentleman;
therefore, both Torre and Curtis were very pleased, Likewise, the
latter did not forget to give the Captain a true and particular
account of Torre's doings of late; and on the <i>Aniwa</i> trip,
leaving him much impressed thereby, but not altogether
astonished.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought,&quot; he remarked, as he laughingly told the
incident to Curtis, &quot;the day I saw him coolly plump that baby
back into Mrs M'Cutcheon's arms and declare a mutiny, that he'd
make a splash one way or the other. I'm glad it seems to be the
right one. But what a pity he lost so much time! He'd be almost
going up now for his mate's exam.&quot; &quot;That's all right,
sir,&quot; replied Curtis, &quot;he'll pull that up and be running
a ship of his own whilst we're still wages-men.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hope so, and good luck to him, I'm sure,&quot; said the
skipper kindly; &quot;I always liked the lad. That brute Phillips
would have ruined him. Still, you know, although his clearing out
seems to have proved exceptionally lucky in his case, in another's
it might mean going altogether to the dogs.&quot;</p>
<p>Torre had a notion of getting Harris on the <i>Cumberland</i> as
second, but when he applied to Mr Fibre, he was told that his
friend was already booked in that capacity for the
<i>Enchantress</i>; with old Horn&mdash;despite his weariness of
the sea&mdash;as boatswain, and Sam and Mat before the mast, all
determined on seeing their salvage safe home. No wonder that Torre,
as he saw his friends rising up the rigging one after the other,
felt just a little sore at being left behind on the shear-pole.
Still, when he came to think of his compensations he ceased
fretting. As well he might; for, besides the &pound;100 banked by
Mr Fibre, the collected money, now that the last lists were in, was
found to amount to a little over &pound;500&mdash;invested by the
former gentleman and a co-trustee until it should be wanted for
himself and May. Then, too, there was his share of the
<i>Enchantress</i> to come. And, to boot, also, ever first in his
thoughts and dreams and air castles, the possession of sweet and
winsome May Darnell's love. &quot;Yes, certainly,&quot; as Jenkins
concisely remarked, he might consider himself &quot;a lucky
dog.&quot;</p>
<p>Torre seldom missed one of the Bohemian &quot;Smokes.&quot; And,
as they only took place on Saturday nights, they never interfered
with his work which was pretty constant; for actually the
<i>Cumberland's</i> running and much of her standing gear were
unreliable&mdash;an inestimable advantage to him, at least, if not
to the owners, in the way of practice and usage with the more
intricate forms of cutting, fitting and splicing. Thus, he often
appeared at Jenkins' with tarry hands. He came there one night to
look for a second mate, but there were no seamen available just
then.</p>
<p>&quot;Jackson might have gone,&quot; said Jenkins, &quot;but he
went up country, yesterday, fossicking. His new book, 'The Profit
of Endeavour,' didn't gee, and he's slung literature in
disgust&mdash;for a while. Then there's Manning&mdash;you met
him&mdash;police court reporter for the <i>Evening Comet</i>. Had
to put the cases into rhyme, you know. He had a mate's certificate.
Got sick of the flimsy and went away with a gang scrub-cutting on
the Bogan. No, all our seafarers have cleared, I believe.&quot;</p>
<p>About this time came to Torre a letter written in a boy's round
hand, and with the post-mark of Bourke.</p>
<p>&quot;<span class="letter">Honoured and Respected Mate,&quot; it
ran, &quot;I hope these few words will find you well as it leaves
me in Camp at present for which thank God. I received your welcome
presents with the greatest of Pleasure. The Dictionary especially
is right up to the Knocker, and I have fossicked up most all these
words in it. Likewise the picture shows as you have growed most
wonderful big. Times is none too good since I seen you, Fish being
scarce and River low. The Gun is a allright one, and I killed a
Duck with her at eighty yards. I seen in some papers that Mr Parker
of Tabletop give me that you was near eat by Cannibals which would
have been worse nor the Snake. I have never had no more Mates. Nor
do not want none. You was a Real First Class One. But them is hard
to get. I was sorry to hear about the Ngori Storekeeper&mdash;him
as you went along with&mdash;getting killed and eat. He did not
seem a bad Sort. I hope you are not forgitten to Use your Props as
I shown you. I have given up the Game, but it always comes in Handy
when a Fellow thinks he knows more as You does. This is a Splendid
Dic. and I will not run short of Reading all the rest of my Life
till I Peg Out. Wishing You Luck wherever you goes, and Hoping as
this Letter will find You in Safety and Please excuse any Words as
I have not drafted out right as my Eyes is none too Good as you

<p><span class="letter">&quot;Yours to Command,</span></p>
<p><span class="letter">&quot;BRALGA.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="letter">&quot;P.S.&mdash;Poor old Stumpy picked up
a bait and got poisoned and died,&quot;</span></p>
<p>And Torre, knowing and appreciating the trouble and time this
epistle must have cost his former mate, answered it at once,
begging him to go to Mr Barker at Stockman's Valley, as the latter
had promised he should have rations and liberty to camp anywhere
along the bends of the Lachlan that ran for thirty miles through
his station. But the old man could not be induced to leave his old
towri any more. The trip he took into Crow Eater Land had cured him
of wandering further than from boundary to boundary along the
Darling and the Warrego&mdash;&quot;up one side of the river and
down the other.&quot;</p>
<p>Until there came a day when a ration-carrier of Tapoloro found
him fast asleep with the sleep that stops all wanderers some time
or other. He died as he had lived&mdash;alone. And Mr Robson had
him buried decently in one of the great shady river-elbows he loved
so well and haunted so long, under a big coolabah out of reach of
the flood water and overlooking a long broad reach that, now,
steamboat men and nomads call &quot;Bralga's Bend.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX<br>
&quot;COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!&quot;</h2>
<p>MEANWHILE, the <i>Cumberland</i>, was rapidly taking in her
cargo; and finding that she would be able to fill up at Newcastle,
Moore, Devine and Co., decided to send her to that port, in place
of Adelaide. A second mate had been appointed, a nephew of Mr
Devine's, who had passed a local Marine Board Examination after two
attempts. His name was Pike. He had served his time with a London
firm, and seemed to know very little about his business, so far as
could be judged at this early stage. Captain Sinclair would have
preferred a better man, but might have given offence by saying so.
Also, as he told Curtis, having Torre and a good boatswain to fall
back upon, it did not so much matter.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Mrs Barker and May came to Sydney on their way
to Melbourne, and visited the <i>Cumberland</i> at Circular Quay.
Torre had a good berth to himself, and the two women amused
themselves by decorating and making it look homely. Nor was Curtis
forgotten, Mr Barker having presented him with a very fine sextant
and a pair of binoculars as memorials of that night on Church Hill.
May, too, went on board the <i>Enchantress</i>, now also filling
up, and saw all her old friends there, forgetting nobody. Old Horn
had wished, it appeared, to take his pets with him, but the Captain
had objected to &quot;Bo'sun.&quot; So, although legally, if not
actually, part owner of the ship, Horn had sensibly given in, and
was leaving the dog ashore. Bolivar, Turnips, and Mag, however,
were to go. Both vessels, it was thought, would be able to get away
within a week of each other, and were timed to arrive for the
February sales in London.</p>
<p>Of course, Torre and May were a great deal together during these
last few days. And they went down to their old Manly resorts, and
also to theatres and amusements, behaving, as Mrs Barker said,
exactly like an old married couple.</p>
<p>&quot;You won't marry your cousin now, Leigh,&quot; whispered
Jenkins, whom they met once in King Street. &quot;Still, I think
you ought to try and rescue her from that Spanish gang you told me
about&mdash;to say nothing of your old uncle.&quot;</p>
<p>Torre thought so too, and so did May. But all their thinking
could resolve no feasible plan to that end. Torre had already lost
too much time to go himself, even if his presence would be of any
effect, which was more than doubtful. Besides, he had heard no
further from Edie, and perhaps they were all on their way by this
to the Cape, or Australia, or even to those <i>chateaux en
Espagne</i> in Uruguay, of which there had been mention.</p>
<p>May approved of the <i>Cumberland</i> on the whole. &quot;You
can see,&quot; was her verdict, &quot;that she isn't a flier like
the old <i>Enchantress</i>, who will start a week behind you and be
at home a fortnight ahead. But still, she's a fine ship, and a dry
and a comfortable one. And oh, Torre, I wish I were going with you.
The station is nice, and the horses and everything very pleasant,
of course. Still, it's not the sea. There was some talk, you know,
of my going in the <i>Enchantress</i>; but it came to nothing, the
Barkers thinking that 'my interests,' whatever they mean by that,
will be as well looked after as if I were there. And they are the
only friends I have now except you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are the dearest people in the world,&quot; replied
Torre. &quot;But she might be a little less hard upon us in the
matter of time. Two years! Ugh! And I'm twenty in
January.&quot;</p>
<p>May laughed, dimpling so bewitchingly that Torre kissed her
there and then, although somebody might have been looking down the
cabin skylight, for all he knew.</p>
<p>&quot;You speak as if it were two hundred in place of
twenty,&quot; she replied, still laughing and blushing, for Torre
was not usually given to public caressing. &quot;Still, it does
seem long to me,&quot; she continued frankly, &quot;although I
suppose aunt is right.&quot;</p>
<p>Torre made no reply, but stood gazing at her with eyes that were
good substitutes for speech. A tall, slim figure of a girl, dressed
all in white, with patches of cardinal ribbons here and there about
her, and a little straw hat, perched, somehow, on the topmost coil
of glossy hair; the love-light shining in those steadfast beautiful
eyes, and a rosy flush tinting the smoothly rounded
cheeks&mdash;just the least tanned now by the kisses of the western
sun. And Curtis, glancing in off the quarter-deck, smiled and
muttered to himself, as memory recalled another very different
scene. &quot;That's more like the real thing! Black's black, and
yellow's yellow; but white and red's the champion
mixture!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now then,&quot; said Mrs Barker, suddenly fussing out of
Torre's berth, &quot;you know, May, we must catch the mail at five.
So I'll give you ten minutes to say goodbye in. If you'd been
sensible people instead of sea-struck ones, there'd be no need of a
goodbye at all. But there, there, I won't growl. You can go and
look at your room now&mdash;I have cupboards at home twice the size
of it&mdash;whilst I go and see Mr Curtis.&quot;</p>
<p>But Torre, getting in her way, took hold of her hands, and
stooping, kissed her pleasant motherly face, and thanked her in
such terms for all she had done for him and May, as made her eyes
twinkle moistly, and need drying before joining Mr Curtis out there
on the sunny deck, whilst Torre and May went into the former's
berth for their last farewell.</p>
<p>That same night the <i>Cumberland</i> was towed up the coast to
Newcastle, and three weeks later she was leaving
&quot;Nobby's&quot; astern, making South again to get round New
Zealand.</p>
<p>Torre was placed in the second mate's watch, and soon discovered
that young Mr Pike was not to be trusted. He meant well perhaps,
still his knowledge was far from equal to his will. But the worst
of it was his being thin-skinned, and resentful of kindly intended
hints; so that, once or twice, he made a mess of things, and had
his watch openly jeering, which is a dangerous state of matters at
the commencement of a passage.</p>
<p>As May had remarked, the <i>Cumberland</i> was &quot;no
flier;&quot; but she was immensely square aloft, spreading great
spaces of canvas from the twelve double yards and big steel lower
ones that sent the massive bulk of her along at an average ten with
the wind on either quarter. Her crew was the usual mixture that
obtains nowadays; only, in this case, mostly German with a
sprinkling of Danes, Swedes, and British. The boatswain was a
capital man, a native of Liverpool&mdash;tall, thin, wiry, and
active as a cat. He had served in the Royal Navy, too, and kept a
good hold on his men. The only trouble seemed likely to be with
Pike; and, by dint of careful watching, Captain Sinclair thought he
might improve; although, as Pugh the boatswain put it concisely,
&quot;If a man don't know how, an' gammons he does, an' is too big
to be set right quietly, why then, the sooner he's broke, afore
mischief comes, the better.&quot; This was in confidence to Torre,
and after Pike had insisted on hauling home the weather sheet of a
topgallant-sail before the lee one. The Captain was on deck, and
swore a little, which was contrary to his usual custom, being on
the whole, for a sailor, a remarkably clean-mouthed man. But the
provocation was certainly excessive, as all seafarers who read will
at once admit. To have an officer in a responsible position who
clearly demonstrates such appalling ignorance of the A.B.C. of his
profession, is unpleasant. Some captains would have disrated Mr
Pike, there and then. But, as has been shown, there were reasons
why patience might be exercised. The aggravating thing about it
was, that on being remonstrated with in respect to this and similar
muddles, the one answer was invariably given: &quot;We always used
to do it that way in the <i>Hampden</i>.&quot; Which was the ship
he had served his time in.</p>
<p>This presently became a regular watchword, and if anything went
wrong a gruff, and often a foreign, voice might be heard to
derisively mutter, &quot;Ve vos alvays do 'im zo in der
<i>Hambden!</i>&quot;</p>
<p>To Torre it was a delightful sensation, this being at sea with,
once more, a wide sweep of deck under foot, and overhead a mass of
tapering spars and maze of rigging.</p>
<p>The <i>Aniwa</i> and the <i>Mary Robinson</i> had been well
enough in their way, of course. But, still, it was a small way, and
his heart warmed to the old <i>Cumberland</i> as she ploughed along
with decks dry as a nut, fore and aft, in a sea that would have
half swamped even the <i>Andromeda</i>, and glanced at the
comfortable scene inboard&mdash;the men at work, here and there
making chafing gear; passing new lashings for the spare spars, and
such like preparation for coarse southerly weather that might be
expected presently. Aloft, he knew matters were in perfect order
for they had been seen to under his own and Pugh's eye; the heavy
sails, too, were bent, so that there really was not much to do
except just set that amount of work going that wise officers know
is absolutely necessary to keep the men out of mischief.</p>
<p>Some captains seem to take a pleasure in constantly seeing their
men on deck, appearing to grudge them their afternoon below; and,
even in high latitudes, setting them to holystone, scrub paintwork,
and beat iron rust off chains and anchors with a ship perhaps
making heavy weather of it under short canvas, whilst the spindrift
freezes on their oilskins, and the wind cuts their skin like a
knife. These are the captains who have trouble with their crews.
Then sometimes the latter run amok amongst the afterguard, and the
public, quite unable to judge of the merits of the case, simply
exclaim, &quot;Oh, what brutes those sailors are!&quot;</p>
<p>But Sinclair was a different sort of man, and although this was
his first command, gave himself no airs and his men no hazing.
Pike, however, made him uneasy. So, presently, this fine breezy
morning, with the Snares somewhere on the port bow, and the
<i>Cumberland</i> under topgallant-sails roaring along in great
style, carrying the wind nearly aft, the Captain called Torre,
smoking an after-breakfast pipe before turning in, and asked him to
keep a stricter look out in his watch than he might otherwise be
inclined to do.</p>
<p>&quot;You see,&quot; said he, &quot;the bo'sun sleeps in all
night, and although, of course, I'm up and down a good deal, still
I don't want to be on deck all the time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; replied Torre, coming straight to the
point, &quot;I know. But he won't be told. And if I take charge
before the men it will make things bad for him. I've tried to save
him more than once or twice, but it's of no use.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the skipper, &quot;I can't run the risk
of losing sails and spars, perhaps, even the ship herself, through
a duffer like that. He comes between me and my rest. Something must
be done with him. Why, if you hadn't awakened me the other night to
take sail off her we'd have lost our sticks, sure as a gun! And
then I suppose it would be, 'That's the way we did in the
<i>Hampden!</i>&quot;</p>
<p>Torre grinned, but made no reply, and the Captain walked away,
apparently making up his mind to do what many men would have done
long ago. Something, however, occurred that same night to settle
the matter permanently.</p>
<p>Towards twelve o'clock the weather thickened, whilst the wind
dropped. Torre found the Captain on deck with Mr Curtis who was now
waiting for his relief&mdash;Pike, always a bad riser, but more
particularly so at night. The wheel had been relieved some time by
one of the two English sailors in the starboard watch when the
second mate at last staggered aft, not thoroughly awake even
then.</p>
<p>&quot;Nice relief this!&quot; growled Curtis; &quot;nearly one
bell! Keep her as she goes, and if there's any change in the
weather call the Captain.&quot; And the mate went off to his bed,
followed presently by the skipper. Mr Pike, after a sleepy look at
the binnacle, flopped on to a hen coop. Then, feeling himself
dozing off, got up again and began to walk up and down. Torre was
doing the same on the lee side; for, of late, he never addressed
the second mate except when actually obliged to, so highly had the
other resented any attempt at help, however delicately
tendered.</p>
<p>The night was pleasant though hazy. The upper topgallant-sails
were stowed, and the <i>Cumberland</i> was jogging comfortably
along at about eight. The decks and rigging were wet with dew; all
the fore part of the ship in darkness; a dull murmur of wind aloft
meeting canvas and soughing amongst gear; a mellow spot of yellow
right aft where the binnacle lamps showed up a section of the
gleaming wheel; all around, the vast immensity of ocean heaving in
tall dark furrows that seemed always trying to blot out the dull
gray wake as the ship rose and fell with rhythmic noises upon their
crests and sent them rolling aft with gurgling roarings and
bubblings capped now and then with phosphorescent flashes dimly
visible through the surrounding thickness. Crossjack and spanker
were both furled; but, to a great extent, the foresail hid anything
directly ahead from the sight of those aft.</p>
<p>&quot;This smother's thickening, and it's getting colder,&quot;
muttered Torre. &quot;Wonder if there can be any ice
about?&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, from the look-out man on the forecastle-head came a
wild quick yell of, &quot;Bright light right ahead, sir,&quot; that
made him jump a foot off the deck.</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay, all right,&quot; replied Mr Pike drowsily, craning
his neck to peer. But Torre ran forward as hard as he could go.</p>
<p>&quot;Steamer's mast-head light, sir,&quot; said the man.
&quot;Just slipped out o' the mist suddent like, an' give me a
scare.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My God!&quot; exclaimed Torre all at once, as the pair
stood and watched, &quot;he doesn't see us! He'll be slap into us
in another five minutes! Hard a port!&quot; he bellowed aft, but
there was no change in the <i>Cumberland's</i> course, and now a
red eye and a green one showed dull under the white which seemed to
almost overhang the ship's jibboom.</p>
<p>&quot;Hard a port!&quot; shouted the look-out man again and
again as he fled from the impending shock. But by this time Torre
had raced to the wheel, and pushing the man there aside, with all
his might he hove it up, up, hard up, whilst hurling bad bitter
words at the second mate.</p>
<p>A minute&mdash;two&mdash;breathless expectant minutes, during
each second of which he waited with set lips to hear and feel the
grinding crash heralding destruction&mdash;and then the ship,
answering her helm, swung away like a newly broken colt from his
shadow; whilst, with a mighty roar of steam-siren, a great towering
mass hurtled by so closely that agonised ears could almost swear
steel sides were kissing steel sides, and her wave, as she vanished
astern, made the <i>Cumberland</i> reel and stagger as if a big sea
had hit her amidships.</p>
<p>&quot;Go to your berth, Mr Pike,&quot; said the Captain who had
run up in his pyjamas, and his voice choked as he spoke, &quot;and
consider yourself relieved from duty as officer of a
watch.&quot;</p>
<p>And this time the second mate, whose very teeth they could hear
rattling from sheer terror, turned and went without a word of
explanation or protest.</p>
<p>&quot;Why the devil didn't you port, Clements?&quot; asked
Torre, as he brought the <i>Cumberland</i> to her course again.
&quot;Didn't you hear me roaring like any bull?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly I did, sir,&quot; answered the seaman in an
aggrieved but shaky voice, &quot;but that thing as has just gone
below, he says, 'Keep on your course, Clements;' says he, 'it's
only a steamer. Steamers always are regarded as wessels with a fair
wind,' says he, 'an' mus' git out of our way.' All the same,&quot;
continued the man turning, as the Captain gave a groan of disgust,
and addressing him, &quot;I was just goin' to up helium on my own
account, when Mr Leigh comes a-rushin' like a bloomin' tiger an'
near knocks me overboard. Obey orders you know, sir, if you breaks
owners.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not blaming you, my man,&quot; said the Captain.
&quot;Still, if it wasn't for Mr Leigh&mdash;who for the future
will take the second mate's place&mdash;you'd ha' been sleeping
with the fishes to-night instead of in your bunk. Check those
fore-yards a little, Mr Leigh, if you please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay, sir,&quot; said Torre. &quot;Starboard fore braces
there, the watch!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My heavens! A nice sort of a shave!&quot; exclaimed Mr
Curtis, when he came on deck and found only Torre there, and was
told what had happened. &quot;No wonder I had a bad dream! And yet
you know,&quot; he presently added, &quot;the fellow was correct
enough as far as he went, only he didn't allow for the possibility
of the steamer not seeing us. Four years at sea, I suppose,
cleaning brasswork and trimming lamps, and then hurriedly crammed
parrot-wise to pass the Board. But, by gad, he gave us a narrow
squeak for it! Makes me shiver to think of the thing. Said nothing
about the <i>Hampden</i>, did he? Well, perhaps it will knock some
of the conceit out of him. I know the skipper doesn't want to be
too hard on the chap, so I'll take him in my watch, with a third's
rating, if the Old Man'll consent.&quot; And thus Torre became
second mate of the <i>Cumberland</i>, vice Pike.</p>
<p>The latter was a young man of about twenty-two, with a dull
heavy sort of face, and an unfortunate manner, who evidently had
come on board in the full assurance, that, as an owner's nephew, he
would be able to do pretty well as he liked; but the narrow escape
of being sent headlong to the bottom by the steamer, knocked a lot
of the starch out of him; and when presently, both Captain Sinclair
and Mr Curtis had talked to him kindly but forcibly, and shown him
how utterly ignorant he was, and how lamentably incompetent to have
charge of life and property, he came out of the sulks he had
thought proper to clothe himself with, and promised to try and
improve under the mate's tuition. All the same, good men and fair
as the pair were, they were but human; and, on the whole, it was
very very lucky indeed for Mr Pike that he happened to be Mr
Devine's nephew. And he never forgave Torre who, he imagined, had,
as he phrased it, &quot;been trying to do him bad&quot; from the
very beginning.</p>
<p>A few days after this delivery from the tender mercies of a
Union steamer and an incapable officer, they spoke an American
schooner, four-masted, and the prettiest craft imaginable. Painted
a dark green, with a narrow white band that brought out and
emphasised her tremendous sheer, running from the eyes of her in a
graceful and gradual sloping to the waist, then curving up again to
the taffrail, forming one great sweep from which, tall and stately
rose her masts&mdash;square on the fore, and schooner-rigged on the
other three&mdash;so level that you could have stretched a tape
along their trucks without finding an inch difference in their
heights. Her bows though sharp, were full, shooting out to stout
bowsprit and long lancing boom as if part of them, then flaring
back suddenly into the run as a fish's head does into its body. It
was a bright, sunny, cold day, and with the wind about a couple of
points free, she came along, her wide breadths of spotless cotton,
from the fore skysail that floated far above the
<i>Cumberland's</i> main-royal to snowy staysails, flying topsails,
and great main, mizzen and jigger wings, creaseless, and gleaming
when the sun caught them, like plates of shining silver.</p>
<p>&quot;Great Jehosophat!&quot; exclaimed Pugh. &quot;Ain't that
Yank style all over, yachting off the Horn in a cotton dress! But
what a picture!&quot; Curtis, who had a kodak, as the vessels
approached each other, &quot;snapped&quot; her two or three times;
and all along the <i>Cumberland's</i> rail men, mostly indifferent
to such sights, stared in pleasure at the beautiful creature as she
danced like some graceful sea-fairy within hailing distance,
forming the strongest imaginable contrast to the big steel bulk of
the <i>Cumberland</i> with her groves of heavy spars, endless maze
of rigging; sturdy deck-houses with the tall funnel of the
donkey-engine sticking up between them, resembling an emaciated
steamer's smoke stack; and her straight stem curving into a
beak-like projection under the spiky, stumpy, bowsprit. There
seemed to be a crowd of men on the schooner, and they handled her
like a toy, although it could be seen, as she backed her fore-yards
and lay broadside on to the <i>Cumberland</i>, that she was
deceptively big&mdash;light and graceful though she looked.</p>
<p>&quot;A thousand tons, ay, and over,&quot; remarked Mr Curtis as
his eye ranged along the great length of her, seeming to overlap
the <i>Cumberland</i>.</p>
<p>&quot;Nearer sixteen hundred,&quot; said the Captain; &quot;why,
she's loftier and longer than we are! Schooner ahoy! What
schooner's that?&quot; he hailed. &quot;This is the
<i>Cumberland</i>, of Sydney, bound for London.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<i>Julia M. Lane</i>, of Portland, Maine, U.S.,&quot;
replied a short, stout, sandy-goateed man, standing on the rail of
the schooner, waving his hat in salutation, and speaking in a
strong nasal tone. &quot;Seen any ice yet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;None,&quot; replied Captain Sinclair. &quot;Have
you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Piles <i>an'</i> piles!&quot; returned the other
emphatically. &quot;Came darned near gittin' squashed like a rotten
melon under a nigger's foot. We're bound to Puget for lumber, an'
then raound to Sydney. Keep your eye a-liftin' for them pesky
bergs. So long!&quot;</p>
<p>Then forward went her fore-yards again, and as the sails filled,
she leaned gently over, dipped her bows till the glistening
scroll-work around them streamed, and danced gaily away over the
choppy sea coming up steely blue and bitter cold to meet her from
the Antarctic Ocean, whilst the &quot;Stars and Bars&quot;
fluttered up and down from her lofty gaff in salute to the Red
Ensign.</p>
<p>&quot;Surely the prettiest ship in the world!&quot; exclaimed
Torre, moved to the sailor's soul of him by the sight, as he
watched the snowy cloud melting away astern.</p>
<p>&quot;Werry pritty, sir,&quot; replied the bo'sun with a grin,
&quot;but dam wet! Like as not her crowd don't know what it is to
have a dry skin. Web-toed, too, I 'spects most of 'em. Lumbermen
generally is. An' see her loaded! Down to her chain-plates; an'
half-way up the rigging with a deck cargo o' deals&mdash;deals in
the cuddy, deals a-pokin' into the fok'sle bunks, deals builded up
round masts an' galley an' boats. Still, just now, there's no
denyin' her's a pritty pictur'! Although, at sea, like some other
places, prittiness and cumfut is meanin's as don't allers sail in
cump'ny.&quot;</p>
<p>A few days later they saw their first ice, and came very near
feeling it into the bargain. And so thick and close did it
presently become, that they had to put the <i>Cumberland</i> under
very short canvas and grope their way through it as best they
might. Never before had such masses been known to come so far
North; and although, fortunately, it was mostly in the form of
isolated and lofty bergs, there were times when it seemed as if the
ship would never get clear any more. And once they had to fasten on
to one to escape being crushed by another that came swooping down
straight for them, and, missing, smashed to pieces against their
protection&mdash;a big fellow, long and low and broad, upon whose
sides the thick plates of the <i>Cumberland</i> ground ominously.
There were clusters of bergs; and double lines of them, forming
avenues adown which they sailed in fear and trembling of a <i>cul
de sac</i>. Their number appeared endless, and they were all bound
northabout as if bent on attacking and quenching &quot;The Land of
Fire&quot; itself. It was a dreadfully nervous and trying time to
both officers and men on the <i>Cumberland</i>, so close and deadly
was the peril which, for nearly a week, encompassed them by day and
by night. And, one night, right in the middle of the crowd, moving
very cautiously and very slowly down an ice-lane formed of barns
and haystacks and church-steeples and towers and fortresses around
whose frozen bases the water washed with hollow roarings in and out
of deep caves, and from whose summits, at intervals, great lumps
fell splashing spray and &quot;nuggets&quot; that clinked on frozen
decks like volleys of glass bottles, they saw lights coming to meet
them. There was just room, and no more, for the two ships&mdash;the
stranger, a Hull barque with her jibboom and foretopmast
wanting&mdash;to pass each other in the sort of canal formed by
opposing bergs, with not more than fifty yards to spare between
them.</p>
<p>&quot;What's this Ah'm getting into?&quot; hailed the
Yorkshireman doubtfully.</p>
<p>&quot;A devil of a mess ahead,&quot; replied Curtis. &quot;How
is it behind you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The damndest raffle o' stoof Ah've seed in forty year o'
the sea!&quot; shouted the other. &quot;Lost ma spars, an' tooch
an' go for ma ship, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can we help you in any way?&quot; asked Captain Sinclair
as the vessels forged past.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; shouted the other, &quot;ye'll have a' ye can do
to help yourself ere ye win clear. One thing, ye've got the wind
free, an' Ah've been nigh close-jammed the whole time.&quot;</p>
<p>But fate was kind to them, and that very morning they found the
ice had scattered and shifted so much before a fresh Easterly
breeze that the water ahead was comparatively open, and free enough
not only to allow making sail, but to do with one man at the con on
the fore-topsail yard, in place of all hands day and night about
the ship. They were round the Horn now, too, and the weather soon
got milder as they made their northing. And one morning watch,
Torre, keeping it, was startled by a cry from the look-out of,
&quot;Landt right ahead!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are you giving us, Hans?&quot; he asked, running
for'ard, and peering into the darkness, already streaked with
dawning. &quot;There's no land within a thousand miles of us.
You've been asleep and dreamt it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Veil den,&quot; replied Hans stolidly, &quot;I dit hear in
mein treams von bick shout vrom der vowl&mdash;der
cocg&mdash;rooster&mdash;how you galls 'im? Zo if id is nod landt,
it mays be a schip mit der vowl on him; bud I zee no
lichts.&quot;</p>
<p>Nor did Torre. But as he stared, there suddenly rose on the air
a shrill, long sustained cry that he could almost have sworn to be
Bolivar's by the volume and the power of it.</p>
<p>&quot;Yah,&quot; said Hans, &quot;I never hear roosder shout zo
loudt in all mein lives bevore. Id is ein schip. I zee der loom of
her. Bud how ve gatches her I knows nod.&quot;</p>
<p>Torre returned aft and stood by the wheel, taking the other
ship's bearings, and then kept away a couple of points. There was a
light but steady breeze, and he had the <i>Cumberland</i> under
everything she possessed in the way of sail cloth. But she was not
doing more than about seven. It took half a gale to get her top out
of her. So Hans' wonder was excusable. As, however, the day broke,
with chanticleer still crowing most lustily, they saw that the
sounds proceeded from a big painted port barque on the weather bow,
stripped to her fore and main lower topsails and a couple of
staysails, and with her royal yards down.</p>
<p>&quot;The <i>Enchantress!</i>&quot; exclaimed Torre before the
glass had been at his eye a moment; &quot;but what's the matter, I
wonder? She looks all right, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is there a farmyard anywhere about, Leigh?&quot; suddenly
asked Mr Curtis, popping out of the companion, &quot;or was I
dreaming? Hello!&quot; as he caught sight of the barque,
&quot;who's mad now? Where's the weather that rig's for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's my salvage ship,&quot; said Torre, laughing heartily,
&quot;and I must say they're taking good care of her. Do you hear
that crow? Well that's Bolivar, Horn's rooster, I've told you of.
Hans was so impressed that he thought there must be land somewhere
handy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By gad, I don't wonder at it,&quot; replied Mr Curtis.
&quot;I had my port open and the noise came right through, and must
have woke me. Hang me, but she's a flier! See how, even now, she's
almost holding her own with us. Man, but an Aberdeen model, if only
in steel, takes a lot of beating! But I must have a look at the
glass and call the skipper. We'll be within talking distance
presently.&quot;</p>
<p>As he gazed at the barque, Torre's thoughts ran on the first
occasion of his seeing her, and of how strange it seemed, this
meeting here in mid-ocean of every one engaged in that business,
every one, that was, except his May. His sailor instinct, however,
soon banished all such retrospect, as his eye searched the horizon
for some sign of the coming storm. But it looked a beautiful clear
morning, and when Sinclair came on deck he was as fully surprised
as his officers had been.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="XX" id="XX"></a>CHAPTER XX<br>
A MID-SEA MADMAN AND SOME SECOND MATES</h2>
<p>&quot;WHO'S got the <i>Enchantress</i>, Leigh?&quot; asked
Captain Sinclair as he stared through his binoculars, evidently
much puzzled by her appearance.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know, sir,&quot; replied Torre, also looking
through his glasses, &quot;but my friend Harris is second, and I
know the bo'sun and a couple of the foremast hands. I can see them
all now. I expect that tall dark man, standing near the wheel, is
the Captain,&quot; he continued. &quot;But what's he waving his
arms to us for? I'm afraid there's something wrong on board her,
sir,&quot; continued Torre, &quot;I see Harris beckoning from
behind the foremast.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Luff, my lad, luff!&quot; said the Captain to the
helmsman. &quot;By heavens,&quot; he added, &quot;if she had her
upper topsails set we'd never catch her! There, steady
so!&quot;</p>
<p>As the <i>Cumberland</i> approached, the tall man, who was
evidently the Captain of the <i>Enchantress</i>, walked to the rail
and in a loud deep voice, distinctly audible, shouted out without
preamble, &quot;The Lord hath worked great things for us. Prepare
to meet His wrath, even as I have done through His infinite mercy
and loving kindness in warning me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay,&quot; shouted Sinclair, after a look of
astonishment at the others, &quot;where's the wind coming from,
sir?&quot;</p>
<p>To this there was no reply for a minute or two. The vessels were
now exactly abreast, and so close that Torre could easily see Sam
and Mat and old Horn amongst a group of men for'ard. But not a soul
of them opened his mouth, and it appeared to Torre that they
watched their Captain with an intensity that left no time for
anything else.</p>
<p>&quot;Let go your topsail halliards fore and aft, Mr
Leigh,&quot; all at once said Sinclair, &quot;and haul up mainsail
and crossjack. There's something amiss there, and I'd like to see
what's the matter.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the other skipper, a tall, thin, sallow faced man with
long black beard and whiskers, was staring wildly at the
<i>Cumberland</i>, and at intervals waving his arms on high, or
shaking his fist at the men for'ard.</p>
<p>&quot;What does your glass tell you, sir?&quot; asked Sinclair
presently.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha, ha,&quot; laughed the other with a maniacal flourish,
&quot;the Lord is my glass! He it is Who watches over me! Last
night His Angel appeared at the side of my bed and said, 'Francis
Maybury, I have preserved thee from the perils of ice, and now I
will do the same by those of storm. The winds shall blow, and the
bitter waters arise in their might to destroy thee. But, I, even I,
will save my faithful servant from destruction. Prepare, therefore,
for the wrath to come. Punish thy disobedient people, should they
refuse to obey thee, and hold fast to the Lord God, thou redeemed
one whom He hath delivered from the merciless rage of the sea.'
&quot; And, as he spoke, with wild gestures and rolling staring
eyes, he suddenly whipped a revolver out of each pocket of his
pilot coat and pointed them first at the helmsman, who crouched low
with deprecating gestures, and then at the men for'ard, who fled
for shelter behind masts, spars, and houses.</p>
<p>From the lower fore-topsail yard arm swung a gasket, made up to
within about a couple of feet of the yard. Taking aim at the small
bunch of line, as the pistol cracked, the watchers saw the gasket
jerk aloft and fall over on the after side of the yard. A wonderful
shot under the circumstances, and one that made those on the
<i>Cumberland</i> instinctively draw back as the mad Captain
laughed and flourished his weapon towards them.</p>
<p>&quot;This is serious,&quot; remarked Curtis, &quot;and I can
see the butt of another pistol sticking out of his breast pocket.
But, good Lord, what shooting! I hope he won't take a fancy to make
holes in us. Listen! He's at it again.&quot;</p>
<p>At this moment Pugh came aft with an iron bolt around which was
tightly tied a piece of paper. It had, the boatswain explained,
just been thrown on board. It proved to be a letter from Harris:
&quot;The Captain's mad,&quot; it ran; &quot;the last week in the
ice was too much for him. He's threatened to shoot the first man
who speaks to any of you. And he can shoot. The mate's locked up in
his berth for wanting to make sail. One of the men has his arm
broken by a bullet for laughing whilst at the wheel. We're in a
mess! For God's sake stand by us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All very fine,&quot; said Captain Sinclair as he finished,
&quot;but he doesn't suggest much. Of course I won't leave them if
I can help it. Still, I don't quite see what's to be
done.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Strip your ship, sir,&quot; shouted the maniac, suddenly
coming to the rail again, &quot;strip your ship, if you would avoid
the wrath to come, before the Angel of the Lord sweeps over the
face of the waters, and sea and sky become as one. Then come to me,
and we will offer sweet and living sacrifices to the Lord. I have
neither bullocks nor goats, but there are sheep
and&quot;&mdash;with a glance at Bolivar, who was sunning himself
on the galley&mdash;&quot;a great fowl. Therefore, do you clew up
and stow, whilst I prepare the altar. So shall we be made clean in
the sight of the Lord.&quot; And as he finished, he walked down the
poop ladder, still holding his pistols, and gave some orders.</p>
<p>&quot;Religious mania with a dash of homicide chucked in,&quot;
said Curtis, &quot;and if you'll allow me, Captain Sinclair, I
think I can manage it. Evidently we can do nothing here; but give
me Leigh and a boat's crew, and we'll go on board. You and the rest
can be shortening sail as if in obedience to his request. And,
well, it'll be hard if we can't secure the poor beggar. He won't be
so suspicious of us, you see, sir, as of his own men.&quot;</p>
<p>The Captain pondered doubtfully, and looked long around and
aloft; but the weather was simply perfect&mdash;blue sky and blue
water, all flooded with bright warm sunshine. The breeze had
lightened considerably within the last hour, and the two vessels
lay within fifty yards of each other, rolling lightly on the gentle
swell; one stripped for a stern encounter with wind and sea, the
other with her courses hauled up, yards on their caps, and a
general air about her of undecided preparation.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like it,&quot; the Captain presently replied;
&quot;I don't want to run the risk of losing my officers at the
hands of a madman, and be left alone. Still, I suppose common
humanity demands that something be done. I will keep Leigh with me.
You, Mr Curtis, can take Pugh and the four Englishmen and see what
you can do; but for God's sake be careful.&quot;</p>
<p>Torre was loth to lose his chance, but the Captain was firm.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said he, &quot;I daresay you'd do just as well
as the mate. Still, he's an older and more experienced man, and if
anything happens, people won't be able to say I didn't take that
into consideration. I don't like this business at all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lower away the gig,&quot; called Curtis, coming up just
then from the saloon with a bulge in each pocket. &quot;I've got
your pistol as well as my own,&quot; he whispered to Torre,
&quot;but I don't think there'll be any shooting. However, I feel
better with 'em.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to send a boat,&quot; hailed Captain Sinclair to
the other, &quot;and as soon as I get the ship snugged, I'll
follow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay,&quot; returned the Captain of the
<i>Enchantress</i>, standing at the head of the poop ladder,
&quot;come in the Lord's name, and before His anger overtakes and
crushes us.&quot;</p>
<p>The excitement on board the <i>Cumberland</i>, even amongst the
phlegmatic foreigners, was by this time intense, as they, in
accordance with instructions, slowly and temporarily rolled up and
made fast the sails, with long pauses to look down at the barque's
decks.</p>
<p>Curtis's instructions to his men were brief. &quot;Keep as close
as you can to the skipper and me, and when I sing out, then rush
him,&quot; was all he said.</p>
<p>Leaving a man in the boat, he and the other four clambered up
the ladder that had been thrown over and stepped on deck.</p>
<p>As he did so, the Captain advanced towards him, saying,
&quot;Excuse me, sir, for receiving you with armed hands, but I
have had much trouble with my crew. They doubt my Message to them,
sent to me direct from Heaven; and I believe would confine me by
force if they could. But ever since the Angel's first appearance,
four nights ago, sir, I have never closed my eyes. I had just
determined on making an example of some of the unbelievers when you
came in sight. And I am delighted that your Captain has consented
to listen to and profit by the Message. You see, I shall soon have
the altar ready, and there are two sheep in yonder pen.&quot;</p>
<p>He spoke collectedly enough, in a melancholy and rather refined
voice, but Curtis could see the mad fires smouldering in the black,
deep-sunken eyes whose quick suspicious glances roved from one face
to another. Nor, for a moment, did he relinquish the grip of his
pistols, nor allow any one to come behind him, backing quietly away
as Curtis or Pugh made a careless advance. The crew, or most of
them, were busy getting four empty iron tanks squared side by side
on the main-hatchway.</p>
<p>&quot;Not what I could have wished,&quot; said the Captain,
following Curtis's eye, &quot;but the Lord will overlook such
shortcomings on the part of poor sailor men. Will he not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure I hope so, sir,&quot; replied Curtis, &quot;but
is there nothing we can do to help you till our Captain
comes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, yes, of course, I was almost forgetting,&quot;
replied the other, as he frowned sternly at Pugh who had tried to
unconcernedly pass him, &quot;I want you to kill my second
mate&mdash;that dark-looking man there,&quot; and he pointed to
Harris who was watching him out of the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Curtis without a minute's
hesitation; &quot;what's he done, sir?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Told me,&quot; replied the other fiercely, &quot;that he
had a share in this ship&mdash;the Lord's ship, consecrated by
Himself through me, His unworthy servant, to His own use. And there
are others also guilty of the same blasphemous assertions. We will
kill them all. I meant to shoot him and the mate to-day. But last
night the Angel forbade me, saying they would meet death shortly at
the hands of others. Without a doubt you were sent for that very
purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I expect so,&quot; said Curtis. &quot;All right, sir, lend
me your pistols, and I'll soon polish those unbelievers
off.&quot;</p>
<p>Hitherto he had never been able to get closer to the madman than
three or four yards. Now he fearlessly stepped towards him, keeping
his eyes sternly fixed on the other's shifty gaze and with hands
outstretched to receive the weapons.</p>
<p>It was a bold thing to do; but Curtis was a bold man, and also
tired of the business, and wishful to end it.</p>
<p>At first the Captain drew back almost to the door of the saloon,
followed, however, closely by Curtis. Then he stopped and held out
his pistols, saying, &quot;Yes, I'll trust you. But promise that
the unbelievers and scoffers, they who claim the Lord's ship for
their own, shall be cut off.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Curtis as his grasp closed on the other's
wrists, and he shouted, &quot;Pugh!&quot;</p>
<p>But the boatswain and the rest were not near enough, and the
Captain struggled desperately to free himself. One of the pistols
fell to the deck. The hand that held the other Curtis had twisted
inwards; and as Pugh, rushing up, flung himself on the Captain,
there was a muffled explosion, the latter suddenly ceased to offer
any resistance and went down heavily, dragging Curtis and the
boatswain with him.</p>
<p>&quot;Take the irons off the mate, Horn!&quot; shouted Harris,
&quot;and bring them here! Quick!&quot;</p>
<p>But when they were brought, there was no need of them. The
Captain lay huddled up quietly in a corner, staring with wide-open
glassy eyes at those who held him.</p>
<p>&quot;Why,&quot; exclaimed Pugh, hurriedly taking his hands
away, &quot;he's shot. Look at the blood!&quot; Curtis, who was
kneeling on him, got up and, putting his arm under the body, lifted
it into a sitting position, disclosing, as he did so, a burnt patch
on the coat just over the breast from which blood was oozing.</p>
<p>All at once the dying man gave a gasp; a flicker of life came
into his eyes, and muttering, &quot;The Angel of the Lord told . .
.&quot; his head fell back, the legs stiffened out, and all was
finished.</p>
<p>&quot;A good seaman and a kind-hearted gentleman,&quot; said
Harris with a sob in his throat, as he rose from his knees,
&quot;before those narrow shaves in the ice sent his mind
astray.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Amen to that,&quot; said an elderly, grey-headed man who
had just joined the group. &quot;For four days we have all been in
terror of our lives,&quot; he continued, &quot;but I have no grudge
against him for it. Poor chap he's at rest, now, anyhow.&quot;</p>
<p>It was the mate who spoke. &quot;My name's Patterson,&quot; he
said to Curtis; &quot;the skipper put me in irons and sent me to my
berth for questioning the reality of his vision. I believe if you
had not appeared, sir, he would have killed me before
long.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think so too,&quot; replied Curtis drily, &quot;and
others. However, sir, you are Captain now. Perhaps I had better
take you and Mr Harris there on board the <i>Cumberland</i> for a
while. I know Captain Sinclair will be anxious to see
you.&quot;</p>
<p>So Mr Patterson and Harris, carrying with them the official log
of the <i>Enchantress</i>, went with Curtis, and wrote the book up,
and had it signed by Captain Sinclair and his chief officer. Then,
with Torre, they returned to where, by now, on a grating, sewn up
in canvas, with the Red Ensign over them, lay the remains of the
ill-fated master ready for burial.</p>
<p>The sun was low as Sinclair read, &quot;Man that is born of a
woman hath but a short time to live and is full of misery. . . . In
the midst of life we are in death. . . . Forasmuch as it hath
pleased Almighty God of His great mercy to take unto Himself the
soul of our dear brother here departed, we therefore commit his
body to the deep: in sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to
eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;</p>
<p>The ships were nearly alongside each other, their flags half
mast, and their bells tolling; along the <i>Cumberland's</i> rail
her company stood bareheaded; around the gangway of the
<i>Enchantress</i> was grouped her crew, genuinely sorry, to judge
by their faces, at the miserable end of one who, without doubt,
until the responsibility of those ice-bound nights and days proved
too much for his mind, was, as Harris had said, &quot;a good seaman
and a kind-hearted gentleman.&quot; And what better epitaph could
any sailor wish for?</p>
<p>&quot;Bli' me, sir,&quot; said Sam, as he wrung Torre's hand,
&quot;I can stand a lot, but this larst week's knocked me an' all
of us outer time. Poor ole skipper, I bears 'im no grutch, but he
<i>was</i> wearin'. An', lor, there weren't no gittin' next anigh
'im! He cud hit a feller in the dark. Why, 'e plunked Bill Jones in
the arm fer only grinnin' whilst he was tellin' us o' the Messidge
what the Hangel fetched 'im. An' Bill stannin' behind me! An' it
were in the first watch&mdash;four bells an' black's a dawg's
mouth! Gates o' heaven, he cud shoot!&quot;</p>
<p>Then old Horn had his say, and brought Turnips and Mag for
inspection. &quot;I am,&quot; he remarked, &quot;gittin' too old in
the horn to be made a targit of. So I was ter'ble glad to see ye,
sir, turnin' up in the nick o' time to save my skin an' our
salwage; fer I reckon he'd ha' sacriwised ship, cargy, an' all
'ands afore he'd finished. An' still he were a gen'leman ivery
hinch ov 'im. An' he treated us like gen'lemen right up to this
larst week. We 'ad a rotten nasty time, ye see, sir, in the hice;
an' that knocked 'im. If he'd been a bad skipper somethin' strikes
me as we'd had him overboard afore this&mdash;long afore this. But,
ye see, him roundin' on us wi' his Messidge all ov a suddent, the
way he done, took us fair aback. An' he cud shoot. By
gum!&quot;</p>
<p>And, presently, in the saloon so familiar to Torre, a health was
quietly drunk to the new Captain, and good wishes interchanged for
a prosperous passage home.</p>
<p>But as the <i>Cumberlands</i> regained their ship, Torre could
not forbear looking apprehensively around. He had not forgotten the
re-appearing of his betrothed's father&mdash;dead Captain Darnell.
But, on this occasion, the sailmaker had apparently done his work
thoroughly, for there was no hideously bobbing object in view to
send superstitious panic careering through men's souls.</p>
<p>And already the <i>Enchantress</i> was beginning to let fall and
sheet home; with Harris, as chief mate now, on the forecastle-head,
and old Horn, as second, aft, closely attended by Mag. But there
was no singing or shouting. Poor Captain Maybury's death, and the
manner of it, had cast a gloom over the ship, so that even the
topsail yards were mastheaded to nothing more than a low throaty
rumble as the men walked the halliards along the deck.</p>
<p>Already the <i>Cumberland</i> had set sail again and drawn
ahead. But she had not gone a mile before the barque came gliding
along like a racehorse, overhauling and passing her with the
greatest ease. Her men were crossing royal yards, and she looked a
fine sight as she slid along before the gentle breeze with a little
mound of white water curling up at her sharp forefoot, every sail
doing its proper work, and every yard trimmed to an exact angle
with its fellow. All along her chequered side could be seen great
streaks and scratches where bergs had hugged her to their rough
bosoms. Otherwise she had suffered nowhere.</p>
<p>&quot;As much a dandy clipper, in her way, as the Yank we met
the other day,&quot; remarked Curtis. &quot;Poor chap! poor chap! I
wonder what would have come of it all if we hadn't taken a hand in
the game. He had them fairly cowed. Well, I suppose it couldn't be
helped. He'd ha' shot me if I hadn't twisted his arm. Anyhow, it's
an ill wind that blows&mdash;you know the rest. And there's the new
skipper going to speak us. He can handle her, anyhow. That's one
comfort.&quot;</p>
<p>Putting his helm up, Captain Patterson swung his fore-yards and
came as close alongside as he could.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you once more, very much,&quot; he shouted, taking
off his hat to the little group on the <i>Cumberland's</i> poop.
&quot;We may meet again before we reach London.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not much chance,&quot; replied Sinclair, &quot;unless you
give us a tow. You sail like a steamer. Fare you well!&quot; And
the half-mast ensigns dipped, whilst the yards came round again
amidst a chorus of goodbyes and waving of hats, as the clipper
turned on her heel and, sheeting home her royals, drew away so fast
that, when the afternoon watch came on deck, a white cloud-like
patch on the horizon alone remained to tell of the ocean tragedy so
lately enacted.</p>
<p>Pike, in his rating of third mate, had for some time apparently
been doing his best to improve himself under Curtis's tuition. He
had also applied to be transferred to the <i>Enchantress</i> as
second in place of Harris; but Captain Sinclair could not see his
way clear to recommend him for a post in another vessel that he did
not consider him fit to hold upon his own. So, presently, Mr Pike
grew sulky again, and made himself disagreeable, especially to
Torre whom he regarded as his supplanter.</p>
<p>Although far from being a pugnacious young man, the latter, but
for his knowledge that Captain Sinclair was disposed to overlook
much in Pike's conduct, and to do his best for his owner's nephew,
was sorely tempted more than once to try and thump some sense into
the other's stupid head, as the only way of stopping his long
tongue from wagging so freely at his expense.</p>
<p>Reduced though he was, Pike seemed to have got the better
completely of his earlier feelings of shame, and to consider that
his relationship gave him the right to openly and freely criticise
the working of the ship, and particularly Torre's share in it.
Curtis was scarcely a fit subject to stand this kind of thing. Nor
was Torre who was duty-perfect in most things that pertained to
working his watch; and who, if he were at a loss on any little
practical point, was not ashamed to ask Pugh&mdash;a fact, this
latter, made much of by Pike.</p>
<p>But Captain Sinclair, although, in most respects, a determined
man, with a very strict sense of duty, was, on this matter of his
useless ex-second mate, more or less undecided and over-lenient. Mr
Devine had confided his nephew specially to the Captain's care, and
asked for his good offices towards him. And Sinclair had promised,
little thinking that he was committing himself to the charge of an
ill-conditioned, incompetent incubus; one who, however, possessed a
capital record endorsed on his Indentures by the firm with which he
had served his time; a fact that naturally gave his uncle great
hopes of his future.</p>
<p>Thus, all parties, except perhaps Pike, were relieved when,
presently, the latter's permanent unfitness for ever pursuing the
profession of a sailor was proved beyond doubt.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a green light on the port bow, sir,&quot; remarked
Pike one night to Mr Curtis, as, almost in the same instant, the
look-out man shouted, &quot;Red light two points on the port bow,
sir!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now that's curious,&quot; remarked the mate. &quot;Which
is it to be, Pike? Can't very well be both, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Green,&quot; persisted Pike after another long stare.
&quot;Man for'ard's colour-blind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Red, I say,&quot; replied Curtis, &quot;and it strikes me,
young fellow, that the boot's on the other foot. Didn't they test
you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course they did,&quot; answered the other sulkily,
&quot;or I couldn't have passed, could I?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then,&quot; retorted Curtis, &quot;you fluked
through by chance. That's a red light, and there's only one
visible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a green light,&quot; replied the other doggedly.</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Curtis pleasantly; &quot;only it's a
good thing to discover your trouble in time before any mischief
comes of it. I fancy your seafaring days are done,
anyhow.&quot;</p>
<p>And so it proved, for when, next day, he picked up green wool
and swore it was red, and <i>vice versa</i>, the fact was
established beyond doubt that he was very badly colour-blind; and,
as such, a distinct danger at sea in any capacity whatever.</p>
<p>&quot;I've known similar cases,&quot; remarked the Captain,
&quot;but very very rare ones, where men have passed in spite of
the defect. I wonder, in the old days&mdash;not so long ago
either&mdash;how many a good ship's gone to the bottom from the
very same unsuspected cause? However, in this instance, as you may
perhaps guess, it's a weight off my mind. I'll have him examined
professionally in London, just for his uncle's satisfaction. All
the same, eyes or no eyes, he'd never have made a sailor.&quot;</p>
<p>So Mr Pike, convinced at last, and after all, perhaps not very
much against his will, took no further interest in anything or
anybody, and quietly subsided into a passenger, which position, as
Pugh remarked, &quot;fitted him to a bloomin' T.&quot;</p>
<p>They caught the S. E. Trades early but light; and for days and
nights together they sailed along without starting a rope-yarn,
<i>anglice</i>, touching braces or halliards. And during this time
Torre read and studied steadily, at the same time applying himself
so thoroughly to the practical part of things, that at last Pugh,
the best seaman on board, swore that he could teach him nothing
more. Captain Sinclair, too, who was a scientific navigator,
learned in the law of storms, deviations of the compass, and
stellar, lunar and solar observations, gave him lessons and hints
invaluable; whilst Curtis, who knew a good deal about steam, and
had laid in a stock of books on the subject, read it up with him to
their mutual profit. Thus, altogether, now that Pike was quietened,
a pleasanter ship fore and aft than the <i>Cumberland</i> it would
have been difficult to find. Moore, Devine and Co., as became
Australian owners, had victualled her well and liberally. In the
forecastle the motto was &quot;Plenty but no waste.&quot; Swallow
and Ariell's white biscuits, butter, pickles, Adelaide jams,
Rockhampton preserved meat, and pies or puddings of Mildura dried
fruits three times a week, made up a table such as few sailing
ships possessed. And the cook, a Frenchman, called
&quot;Louis,&quot; took a pride in showing what he could do with
such varied material. &quot;Darn my rags,&quot; said one of the
English A.B's., &quot;if it ain't a treat to git 'old on a lump o'
salt 'orse or a pint o' pea soup now an' agin fer a change. Fat an'
bilious we're girtin' wi' this high livin' that I never seen the
likes of afore at sea&mdash;an' I ain't no chicken at the game. So
help me, but a feller as wouldn't jump to a call, night or day, fer
owners as feeds him up in sich style ain't wuth kickin'.&quot;</p>
<p>And every night, for those who cared about it, there was
&quot;Grog ho!&quot; which, however, only a few went aft for. The
modern merchant seaman has in this respect, undergone a radical
change and is&mdash;the majority of him at any rate&mdash;no longer
the drunken careless creature of the novelist, but a steady-going,
generally sober customer, with, as like as not, a Savings' Bank
pass-book; tailor-made clothes and white shirts in his chest; and,
often, a gold watch and chain to wear with them. One of the
<i>Cumberland's</i> A.B's. owned a cottage and an allotment of
ground in a Sydney suburb for which he received ten shillings a
week; another owned a share in a Johnstone's Bay fishing boat, and
so on, and so on; whilst almost any of them, although perhaps, not
averse to a &quot;nip&quot; or a glass of beer, or two or three now
and again, would have utterly scouted the notion of going on a
&quot;spree&quot; after the old immemorial ascribed fashion. But
then, as a rule, you won't find the British sailor man under
canvas. He has gone into steam, and left his bunks in the sailors'
forecastles to the foreigner&mdash;&quot;Dutchmen and Dagoes.&quot;
In the steamer, cargo or passenger, he gets better fed, better
paid, better treated in every way than in the average sailing ship,
of which the <i>Cumberland</i> represented one out of a thousand,
and the <i>Andromeda</i> the balance. In the steamer it is
&quot;Coffee in the morning and no fore-royal,&quot; i.e., no going
aloft to speak of; no crawling up slippery rattlines o' stormy
nights, and laying out on swaying footropes along slippery yards,
whilst iron-hard ridges of canvas bang and flap at Jack's head, and
reef-points flog his numbed fingers. No; British Merchant Jack has
learned a little sense within the last ten years, and has almost
entirely deserted the deep water &quot;lime-juicers,&quot; and
cheerfully made way for Hans and Carl, Diego and Luigi, grimy
stolid persons who commend themselves to the British shipmaster by
their submissiveness to all sorts of curious treatment, and possess
an accommodating appetite to which the worst provisions obtainable
as condemned stores never seem to come amiss. Still, there have
been occasions on which those same skippers would have given their
right arms for the certainty that their crews would answer to a
call in plain English, even if only with a growl.</p>
<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; said Pugh one day to Torre, &quot;this is my
last v'yge in a sailer. The skipper's promised to take me in the
steamer he's a-goin' to get. An' if you'll take my advice, sir,
you'll sling it, too, as soon as you done another year or so. There
ain't nothin' in it, fore nor aft. What's a secon'
mate&mdash;beggin' your pardon, sir&mdash;in mos' ships, but an
inwidious sort of an officer which isn't neither fish, fowl, nor
good red 'errin'. A 'greaser' they calls him, and, 'a sailors'
loblolly boy.' He's bullied by the skipper an' mate, an' ain't
respected by the men. If there's any dirty work to be done, he's
the one it falls on. I'm talkin' o' the general run o' sailin'
ships. And the 'arder he works the less he's thought on. The secon'
mate on a big steamer's a gentleman. 'E's a bloomin' Hearl an' a
Dook rolled together by comparison. Lor! the secon' mates I've
seed! Why him&mdash;that Pike&mdash;ain't a patch on some of 'em
for general uselessness. An' I've seed a few&mdash;a werry
few&mdash;A wunners. But I was wi' one in the <i>Mary Hopkins</i>,
a hot ship, too, as was the dead finish. He come aboard in a bell
topper, an' carryin' of a white humberella to keep the sun
off&mdash;it was at Singapore. He weared gloves, too, an' a collar
like a mast-coat. The secon' we'd brought wi' us from Boston had
been took ill&mdash;belayin' pin fever, caught from the
mate&mdash;an' 'ad to go to the 'ospital. A poor useless
creetur&mdash;one o' them London firm's 'ard bargains, same's that
Pike. An' 'im havin' the cheek to ship in a Yankee Packet! Good
lor!&quot; And Pugh chuckled for a minute to himself as he paused
to let Torre take in the full enormity of the thing.
&quot;Well,&quot; continued the boatswain, &quot;he got done bad o'
course&mdash;knocked about like a paper man in a gale o' wind. An'
this other fellow comes in his place. Skipper an' mate was both
ashore at the Police Court fixin' things up in respec' o' that
there belayin' pin business. But, as we heard arter, the skipper
goes first to the Shippin' Office and arsts for a secon' mate.
Whips of 'em, you bet! But the Old Man was detarmined to get one as
knowed a little this time. So he arsts each as they come
up&mdash;says he, arter a few other questions&mdash;'Waal, mister,'
says he, 'kin you, s'posin the needcessity comes on suddent, kin
you make a hurlyquecurlyque accordin' to Cocker? 'Cause if you
can't, you're no darned good to me?'</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Mr Leigh, none o' them toes the mark except this
joker as just come aboard, like I was tellin' ye, wi' the
humbereller an' gloves; an' he says, bold as brass, 'Why cert'nly,'
says he, 'made dozens of 'em.'</p>
<p>&quot;The h&mdash;ll you hev!' says the skipper, a bit
flabbergasted hisself. 'Waal then, you go on board, right away, an'
fix one up ready for me by time I get back.' An' the Old Man winks
at the mate as much as to say 'We're a-goin' to have some fun, I
guess, with this 'ere tenderfoot.'</p>
<p>&quot;Well, o' course, we thought he was a passinger.</p>
<p>But all of a suddent he furls his humberella an' roars like a
bull calf: 'Now then you loafin', hadjective, hadjective
gentlemen-shellbacks! I'm your new secon' mate! Rouse along now!
All the rope in the ship on deck&mdash;every inch of it. Bo'sun,
where are you? Look sharp, now, an' no tricks.' Well,&quot;
continued Pugh, grinning at the recollection, &quot;I wasn't bo'sun
then. But the fellow, as was nat'-rally looked a bit doubtful. An'
says he, 'The Captain's ashore; an'&mdash;' 'I knows that,' says
the other, catchin' of 'im up quickly, 'an' I'm aboard, an' if you
don't obey orders I'll shake the liver outer you!' An' he makes a
step for'ard&mdash;a big broad-shouldered, red-'eaded customer as
would ha' eaten the bo'sun in one hact. So at last we turns to an'
gits up coil arter coil, dozens an' dozens of 'em. An' he makes us
carry the rope&mdash;bolt an' rattlin', big an' small,&mdash;aloft,
an' lead it back'ard an' for'ard, an' for'ard an' back'ard, an'
upen' down, an' crissways an' crossways atween her masts till she
looked like a bloomin' spider's web. Such a hurrah's nest you never
seen in all your born days! An' he wasn't satisfied till the last
strand in the ship were expended. Then he walks up an' down wi' a
big seegar in his mouth a-smilin' to hisself, an' watchin' fer the
skipper's boat. An' when the Old Man did come he meets him at the
gangway where he stud starin' an' starin' aloft as if he cudn't
believe his own eyesight. 'An',' says the Old Man at last, 'What,'
says he, 'is this hadjective, hadjective, blanky-blanky, blank mess
you've made outer my ship?' An' says the other fellow, touchin' his
'at, werry perlite, 'That, sir,' says he, 'is the hurlyquecurlyque
as you hordered. Not quite accordin' to Cocker, I'm sorry to say,
but as near as I cud git it with the materials to 'and.'
&quot;Well, the Old Man stares fer a minnit, an' then he busts out
a-larfin', an', says he, 'I think you'll do, Mister. I'll give you
a show, anyhow. Take it all down an' put it away agen. It's as near
bein' a hurlyquecurlyque as I'm earin' about.'</p>
<p>&quot;There was no flies on that secon' mate,&quot; continued
Pugh. &quot;An' he was a fust class sailor-man all over; so he'd
stan' no nonsense aft, an', bein' open an' willin' to thump any two
men for'ard, he got on A 1. But the best o' the joke was its bein'
all a lark. You see, sir, the <i>Mary Hopkins</i> had got a real
bad name about them parts fer a hot ship. An' this chap talkin'
about her, one day some of his swell friends makes him a bet, an' a
heavy one, as he's not game to take the place o' the secon' mate as
is lyin' bashed up in the 'ospital. Well, this gent&mdash;who's
owner an' skipper himself of a fine topsail-schooner yacht then
lyin' in the harbour&mdash;takes the wager, leavin' word for her to
come on round to Hong Kong where we was bound. She got there before
us, though; an' we'd no sooner dropped anchor than a dandy boat
like a man-o'-war's pulls alongside; an' says our big secon' mate,
calm an' cool: 'Goodbye, Captain,' says he, 'sorry to leave you.
Had a real good time, an' I've won a couple o' hundred over you.
'Ere, bo'sun, 'ere's a tenner fer the men&mdash;very good crowd
indeed.' An' as skipper an' mate stan's wi' their mouths open an'
their heyes a-bulgin', up jumps a young feller in brass-bound togs,
an' touches his cap wi' 'Gig's alongside, Sir Charles, if you
please!' An' 'All right,' says the Baronite&mdash;fer that's what
he was. 'Come an' have a glass o' wine, Captain, wi' me to-night to
meet some friends,' says he, 'I'm a-stayin' at the
&quot;Horiental.&quot; ' An' orf he goes, an' we never sees him no
more&mdash;the toffiest, jolliest, darin'est secon' mate I ever
come acrost. Tain't a new yarn,&quot; concluded Pugh, &quot;an'
you'll hear it told lots o' roads, but I was there, an' ought to
know the rights of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI<br>
THE SPANISH YACHT</h2>
<p>ONE morning, in about 20&deg; South, those on the
<i>Cumberland</i> espied a faint stain of smoke athwart the sky
right astern. But it was past noon ere they made the vessel out to
be a small, white-painted, paddle-wheel steamer that came panting,
puffing, and churning along just a little faster than they were
sailing themselves. At last with feeble puffs, as if rendered quite
breathless by the hoarse roarings of her long chase, she caught
them and chunked alongside with four or five people on her bridge
all chattering at once. She was a Spanish gun boat&mdash;a dirty,
ill-kept, sloppy, old tub armed with four or five guns that might
have been at Trafalgar, so obsolete were they and their
furniture.</p>
<p>&quot;De sip!&quot; hailed an officer in a dingy, white drill
suit ornamented with big silver buttons.</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay,&quot; said Captain Sinclair, &quot;what's the
matter with you?&quot; Then came a babel of which no one could make
sense at all.</p>
<p>&quot;Sop! sop!&quot; screamed some one presently from her
bridge, waving his arms furiously.</p>
<p>&quot;He means 'stop' I suppose,&quot; said Curtis, laughing,
&quot;but they've got the worst lot of English amongst them that I
ever heard. Hoist the Ensign, Mr Leigh, for fear they fire upon us
and hurt themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is there anybody on board can speak a little
Spanish?&quot; asked Sinclair as the row recommenced,</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose we must be civil, as they've saluted the
flag.&quot;</p>
<p>And, indeed, the gaudy flag of Old Castille had promptly been
lowered and raised again as the Red Ensign fluttered up the
halliards to the <i>Cumberland's</i> gaff-end.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sir,&quot; replied Pugh, &quot;I knows a few words,
but I'm doubtful about bein' able to carry on very long wi'
'em.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right!&quot; said the Captain, &quot;it doesn't matter
much, I daresay. Make your stock go as far as you can.&quot;</p>
<p>So Pugh, getting on to the rail, roared &quot;<i>El
Capitan!</i>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yash! yash! yash! <i>si! si!</i>&quot; replied a very
excited little man, slapping his breast repeatedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, all right&mdash;<i>Tres bueno</i>&quot; said Pugh;
&quot;keep cool! There's no hurry!&quot; And then in a breath:
&quot;<i>Quien es buenos dias amigos vaya mi dios mil gracias
demonio no entiende</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There,&quot; said the boatswain, &quot;that's about the
length o' my line, I do believe. It only means, 'What do you want?
Sorry we can't understand. Good-day, and many thanks,' or something
like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it's a word long enough to mean a lot,&quot;
remarked Torre, &quot;and it seems to have tickled the Dons a good
deal more than a broadside would have done.&quot; And, indeed, fore
and aft the gunboat all hands were simply shrieking with laughter,
the sallow crew for'ard actually rolling on the deck in ecstacies
of merriment.</p>
<p>&quot;You must have said something you didn't quite mean
to,&quot; laughed Curtis.</p>
<p>&quot;What I meant to say, sir,&quot; replied the boatswain,
&quot;was to the effeck that, as we couldn't make out what they
wanted, why the next best thing was to say good-day an' up helium.
But o' course you can't expec' them dirty garlic-eatin' furriners
to take a 'int.&quot; And Pugh withdrew in dudgeon, remarking that
he &quot;hadn't done as well by lengths as the quartermaster o' the
old <i>Resolution</i>.&quot;</p>
<p>But the Spaniard seemed to have had enough of it, for he
presently did &quot;up helium,&quot; and with a profusion of bows
and smiles, and another salute, chunked away to the westward.</p>
<p>&quot;Couldn't have been anything very important,&quot; said
Curtis philosophically, &quot;and, if they'd wanted to tell us that
the British Empire had been swallowed up by an earthquake, we
should be just as wise as we are now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I don't suppose it mattered much,&quot; acquiesced
Torre, &quot;although they did seem so excited over their news,
whatever it was.&quot;</p>
<p>But Torre was wrong, so far as regarded himself at any rate. It
would have interested him to know that the Spaniard had asked if
anything had been seen of a large fore-and-aft schooner-yacht,
painted green with a gold stripe, that a party of sea-thieves had
lately stolen out of the harbour of Funchal, leaving their own
worthless vessel in its place. The yacht, it appeared, belonged to
a Spanish nobleman who had been cruising about the islands. And,
strange to say, these desperadoes had either kidnapped or persuaded
an English family living near Funchal to accompany them in the
stolen vessel. Matter, this, to have given Torre some food for
thought, had greater lingual proficiency existed between the
<i>Cumberland</i> and His most Catholic Majesty of Spain's
war-ship, <i>Nostra Senhora del Carmen</i>.</p>
<p>&quot;What did you mean, bo'sun,&quot; asked Torre later on,
&quot;by mentioning the quartermaster of the <i>Resolution</i>; and
that you hadn't done as well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lor' bless you, sir,&quot; replied Pugh, laughing;
&quot;did you never hear the yarn? This hincident wi' them Spanish
coves made me think ov it&mdash;only the Q.M. knowed even less o'
the lingo than I did. But what I said as made 'em go into
highstrikes o' larfin' that way I can't think. Well, about the
<i>Resolution</i>, it's a old Sarvice yarn as was told long afore I
joined Johnny War as a nipper o' twelve. You see, sir, the frigate
lost her main-yard in the Bay, a-goin' out to the China station.
Well, the commander had a spar on board that he cud make do on a
pinch; but knowing there was a good dockyard at Cadiz he drops in
there on chance of gettin' fitted quicker'n an' better'n he cud ha'
done it hisself. But, misfortunately, jist the same as it might be
us, this evenin', there was none of the officers cud parlez vous a
word o' Spanish. At last and at long, however, amongst the ship's
company they finds a quartermaster who wolunteers to make the
dockyard man understand what's wanted. So they brings him along;
and he opens out, losing no time:&mdash;</p>
<p>&quot; 'Squarey-cum-squarey,' says he, 'roundey-cum-roundey; one
mainyardy for John Ingliteray?'</p>
<p>&quot; 'No <i>entiende, se&ntilde;or</i>,' says the Spaniard,
grinnin' an' bowin'&mdash;meaning, o' course, as he couldn't
understand such gibberidge. So back goes the noble Q.M. to the
Captain, and, says he, 'He reckons, sir, as it couldn't be done in
ten days.'</p>
<p>&quot; 'Oh, nonsense,' says the skipper, 'I can't wait. Must
make our own do.'</p>
<p>&quot;But ever after,&quot; concluded Pugh, &quot;that
quartermaster had a fine character for Spanish, which is more'n
I'll have, I'm frightened.&quot;</p>
<p>When, the next morning at eight bells, Torre came on deck, he
found the ship becalmed, and all hands staring at a fore-and-aft
schooner that lay barely half a mile away, with her topsails
stowed; but fore and mainsails hauled down and lying in heaps
across their booms, whilst a jib and staysail hung all in a ruck
along the stays, as if the halliards had been let go and then
hurriedly left. She was very deep, and rolled sluggish and dead to
the gentle heave of the sea.</p>
<p>&quot;A fine little boat,&quot; remarked the Captain, putting
down his glass. &quot;Seems to me as if she was half full of water,
though. Anyway, there's nobody visible on her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not much sign of a change, sir,&quot; said Torre, who had
been staring at her through his glass, &quot;and there might be
something worth saving. She looks above the general cut of a vessel
you'd expect to see about here&mdash;small traders from the Cape to
St Helena or the Brazils.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, well, yes,&quot; replied Sinclair, &quot;if you like,
you and the bo'sun and a couple of hands can take the gig and pull
across to her. As you say, there may be something worth saving.
She's a pretty thing, too,&quot; he continued, peering through the
glass again, &quot;but she never came out of a British
yard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hello! Another Spanisher or Portugee!&quot; exclaimed
Pugh, as the gig pulled round the stern, and its occupants saw the
name &quot;<i>Ysabel</i>&quot; in gilt letters surrounded by scroll
work. &quot;But, by jingo, she ain't got long to float! All the
salwage we'll git won't do us much good.&quot;</p>
<p>And, indeed, the schooner was settling so fast that, without any
trouble, the men stepped from the boat on to her rail. She was of
about 150 tons burden, flush fore and aft, and her deck furniture
of the finest and best&mdash;skylights, companion, and even galley
and forward-house, being of some heavy, bright, polished wood like
mahogany, clamped with brasswork, and the two latter lit by
brass-bound bullseyes of stained glass. Her wheel and binnacle were
actual works of art; whilst the brass belaying pins around the
mainmast each represented a curiously moulded snake or lizard.</p>
<p>&quot;Pah!&quot; exclaimed the intolerant Pugh, as he took it
all in at a glance, &quot;looks more like a bloomin' chapel nor a
ship. That's the wust o' them furriners&mdash;they must have their
religion allus a-stickin' out. See that there brass crooshifix on
the hub o' the wheel, well, that's what they prays to in a
calm&mdash;goes down on their marrers an' says, 'Blow, good Sent
Antonio,' they says, 'an' blow the sticks outen her!' Then,
presen'ly, when it comes on a reg'lar roarin' snifter the tune
changes to 'Gently, gently, dear, good Sent Antonio! What for you
blow like that? We was only gammon.' I'll bet, now,&quot; continued
the boatswain, kicking heavily against the companion door, &quot;as
down below's chock full o' pitchers o' Sents o' all sorts an'
sizes, an' that you kin still smell the stink o' the hincense they
burns to 'em. This is one o' them swell religious yachts belongin'
to a Dook or a Hearl, like enough.&quot; But here he broke off
abruptly, jumping back as if he had trodden on a snake.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the matter, now?&quot; asked Torre.</p>
<p>&quot;Didn't you hear it, sir,&quot; replied Pugh;
&quot;somebody's knockin' in there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One of the Saints you've been insulting, bo'sun,&quot;
returned Torre with a laugh.</p>
<p>But the boatswain was already pulling at the sliding hood of the
companion.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, it's fastened wi' nails,&quot; he shouted presently;
&quot;now can ye hear the knockin'?&quot; And, sure enough,
everybody plainly could&mdash;a dull, quick, hammering sound,
apparently coming from the saloon below.</p>
<p>&quot;There's somebody there, all right!&quot; exclaimed Torre.
&quot;Quick, lads, never mind the companion! Rouse the mainsail off
the skylight, and let's try and open that.&quot;</p>
<p>This was soon done, and the skylight&mdash;a V-shaped, mahogany
frame set with coloured glass of great thickness protected by
chased bars of flat copper&mdash;exposed to view. But this also was
found to be carefully secured by big six inch spike nails driven
almost to their heads in the tough wood.</p>
<p>&quot;Somethin' fishy here,&quot; said the boatswain, as the
knocking still continued; &quot;an', by God, we've got to look
slippy! See, she's dipping her nose into it! Another twenty minutes
an' it's all u.p. with her! Run for'ard, a hand, an' git one o'
them big capstan bars&mdash;bring a couple while you're about
it.&quot;</p>
<p>Using these and a long iron bolt somebody found, the cover was
soon battered and prised off, only, however, showing the excited
workers against time, three steps leading into a small apartment
fitted up as a smoking-room. Out of this a solid door of mahogany,
locked on their side, led into the main saloon. Light came in
through glass lozenges let into the deck. Luckily, for it would
have taken an hour to batter down the door, Torre picked up a key
lying on the carpet and at once unlocked it and peered in with the
boatswain's head over his shoulder. But the sickening close air
that rushed out made them both draw back hastily. Lamps they had
seen were burning dimly inside, and by their light, when they again
looked, they perceived a woman sitting on the floor with a bottle
in her hand, still beating monotonously on the richly decorated
panelling of the mainmast, whilst a man seemed to be asleep on a
velvet covered lounge close by. As they stared, from behind the
mast rushed a wild-eyed figure, pale, with a mop of tangled, sandy
hair, that cried shrilly, &quot;Save me! save me! the ship's
sinking!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; retorted Pugh, &quot;we knows that! An',
anyhow, you ain't the only one what wants savin', aperiently. Let
'im go, sir,&quot; as Torre tried to stop what, as refreshed by the
outer air, the lamps burned up, they saw was a stout, young man
with a white flabby face around which grew a fringe of light
whiskers, and whose every feature betokened craven fear. &quot;Let
'im go, sir,&quot; said Pugh; &quot;'e won't commit soosancide
afore we hike this lady-drummer an' t'other 'un up. What did I say
about pitchers an' haltars an' sich?&quot; continued the boatswain,
as he lifted the woman from the floor, whilst Torre went over to
the man on the couch. And glancing around, he saw that not only did
paintings, mostly of saints and martyrs, cover the polished
panellings, but that at the far end of the cabin an immense
crucifix stood upright against an altar-piece of white marble.</p>
<p>But there was little time to examine things and as a cry from
the deck was passed down to them of &quot;Look sharp! She's sinking
by the head!&quot; Pugh caught up the woman and undeterred by her
screams bundled her up the steps; whilst Torre, finding the man
insensible and very light, carried him bodily to the boat. And none
too soon, for they had scarcely got a cable's length away before
the schooner gave a plunge for'ard, lifted a little aft, and then
slowly settled down quite upright. As the trucks of her lofty
topmasts disappeared and Torre turned to look at the rescued ones,
an exclamation broke from him when he recognised in the
sharp-faced, gray-haired woman, his aunt, Mrs Bovey. Like a flash
it dawned upon him that the young man must be Laban, and the old
one, lying in the bows with his head in the woman's lap, his
uncle.</p>
<p>A strange meeting truly!</p>
<p>But where was Edie? Could there be any one else on board? And he
blanched at the thought, as he sharply put the question to Mrs
Bovey who was staring with scared eyes at the spot lately occupied
by the schooner.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no one,&quot; she answered miserably; &quot;my
stepdaughter was with us, but they took her away in the boat when
they left us to drown. Oh!&quot; she exclaimed vindictively, with
something of the old fire coming into her eyes, &quot;if I ever get
hold of that Don Sebastian, I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;&mdash;&quot; and
she choked with passion at the thought.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes, mar, you'll do a lot, won't you?&quot; put in the
flabby youth sneeringly; &quot;if it hadn't been for you, we'd
never ha' been coaxed on board that infernal boat, or lost Edie,
and left to drown like rats in a drain. You an' your Spanish nobles
with their estates in South America, and their gold and diamond
mines!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And who drank with them, and gambled with them, and lost
my money to them, I'd like to know, only a soft fool like
you?&quot; retorted Mrs Bovey fiercely, in the sharp angry tone
that Torre knew so well.</p>
<p>&quot;But the other lady?&quot; he interposed anxiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, young man,&quot; replied his aunt, in a voice that
made Pugh grin, &quot;she's gone with Don Sebastian and the rest of
'em. And that's an end of it, I suppose. They, however, left us
only yesterday morning, so they can't be very far away. The brutes,
to desert us like that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They was, marm,&quot; put in Pugh gravely, &quot;all out,
to desart a lady in that fashion. An' if it 'adn't been for your
drummin', marm, you'd all ha' been at the bottom by now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very likely, my good man,&quot; replied Mrs Bovey almost
complacently. &quot;Mr Bovey, here, as you see, is helpless, and my
son equally so.&quot;</p>
<p>By this time they were alongside, and Torre, leaving the others
to the care of the steward, carried his uncle into his own berth
and tried to revive him by small doses of spirit. The poor old man
was wasted to a mere shadow of his former stout and rotund figure,
and when at last he opened his eyes, it was evident that his mind
wandered, for he babbled of Newton Pomeroy, Edie, and Torre
himself, after a fashion that brought tears to the latter's
eyes.</p>
<p>But, presently, Mrs Bovey came in, asking rather sharply why her
husband had been taken there.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, aunt,&quot; replied Torre, &quot;as you didn't seem
to care much what became of him, I thought I'd better see what I
could do myself. You've lost Edie, apparently. And now you don't
appear to trouble a great deal whether you lose your husband or
not, into the bargain.&quot;</p>
<p>For a moment Mrs Bovey stared in bewildered surprise at the
tall, handsome young fellow who dared to speak to her in such
fashion. But soon recovering herself, she said coldly, &quot;I
thought when first I heard your voice that there was something
familiarly unpleasant about it. You are Torre Leigh, poor Mr
Bovey's scapegrace nephew, who used to make mine and my poor son's
lives miserable, and wound up by running away from his employers. I
remember writing to say that I knew you would never do any good for
yourself. And I request that you will not address me as 'aunt.'
&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, all right, Mrs Bovey,&quot; returned Torre pleasantly;
&quot;and as for the other matter, perhaps I've done as well as
your son, judging at least from what you said to him in the boat
just now; and who, I see, from the way he bolted out of the
schooner's cabin, and left his mother to shift for herself, is in
nowise altered from the cur he was as a boy. But now, madam,&quot;
and Torre's voice grew stern, and his dark eyes glittered
ominously, &quot;I must ask you for some news of my cousin. Where
is Edie? Between you and your precious cub you have, I truly
believe, worried and tormented this poor old man to his death. And
I am not by any means certain that it has not been by your
connivance and with your consent that his daughter has been
kidnapped, or possibly worse. You will please remember, madam, that
I am no longer a boy and at your mercy; also that I am an officer
on board this ship; that the captain and mate are my personal
friends; and if you won't tell me the whole story, we'll find means
to make you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you will, will you?&quot; retorted Mrs Bovey
scornfully, but with an uneasy look around. &quot;And how will you
do it? Flog me, eh? Torture me, eh? Starve me, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not at all, madam,&quot; replied Torre. &quot;We won't
touch you. But we'll tie a rope round Mr Laban's waist, and tow him
behind the ship. And sharks are numerous hereabouts.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs Bovey turned pale. Torre guessed that, in spite of her hard
words, she still idolized her son; and that, remembering the
everlasting feud between them as lads, she would well believe him
capable of doing what he threatened. Hence his bit of bounce. Which
might have succeeded or might not. But an unexpected incident
turned the scale. As Torre stood looking sternly at Mrs Bovey, he
saw her face change, and, turning, found that; his uncle had worked
himself to a sitting posture in the bunk, and was gazing at them
with eyes of recognition. Perhaps he had heard and understood some
of their conversation, for he said weakly, but in the old kind
voice, as Torre grasped his outstretched hand, &quot;That's you,
isn't it, my lad? She's a bad woman, Torre. She made me write that
cruel letter to you. Oh, yes, I remember. A bad woman, Torre. And
now she's killed your little Edie. She's gone; we'll never see her
any more, my boy. A bad, hard woman, Torre!&quot; And the tears ran
down the old man's face as he finished speaking, and falling back
on the pillow began to wander again.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a lie!&quot; exclaimed Mrs Bovey sulkily, and
thoroughly frightened into the bargain by the look on Torre's
face&mdash;for the latter really half believed, now, that there had
been foul play somewhere. &quot;It's a lie. I'm sure the girl's
safe enough. I was shamefully deceived myself by Don Sebastian and
his companions. The Don was paying attentions to Edie, and,
considering the state of her father's health, and other matters, I
thought that perhaps she might do worse than marry a nobleman,
although he was a foreigner. So, when Don Sebastian invited us all
to visit his estates in South America, I agreed without hesitation.
The vessel they arrived at Funchal in, it appeared, was not large
enough to accommodate all of us. So, as the Don informed us, it was
sold, and the <i>Ysabel</i> bought from the Duke of Medina Sidonia.
From what I heard on board I know that the yacht, which was laid up
for a time, was stolen and the two men left in charge of her killed
and their bodies thrown overboard. But not until we had been a week
at sea did we discover that we were in the power of a gang of
ruffians and murderers; for then, the Don, throwing off all
disguise, openly declared his intention of taking Edie with him and
leaving us to sink on the <i>Ysabel</i>, into which he bored holes
and secured us, as you saw. He knew that a ship would be sent after
him, and intended with the yacht's boat to reach the South American
coast. I believe also that there was a very large sum of money on
board the yacht, and to steal this had been their first motive in
coming to Madeira. Then, when Don Sebastian fell in love with Edie
he thought he might as well kill two birds with the one
stone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And yet you have the heart to say, knowing what company
the poor girl is in,&quot; exclaimed Torre indignantly, &quot;that
she's 'safe enough.' Why, you haven't got the common feeling of a
woman about you! The plain fact of the matter, I expect, is, so
eager were you to get rid of her, that you absolutely flung her at
that Spanish cut-throat's head. No wonder my uncle says you killed
her! And yourself and your son saw him take her away without a word
of protest! Oh, a nice pair! I'm almost sorry I ever thought of
pulling over to the yacht!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We had no chance to protest,&quot; retorted Mrs Bovey,
with a glance of hatred. &quot;The three of us were below, when
suddenly we heard a great knocking on deck. Then Edie screamed two
or three times; and when we tried to get out we couldn't. Then,
after a while, the Don came to one of the little round windows and
shouted to us that we might now begin to say our prayers, because
in a few hours we should be at the bottom, and that we were to take
good care of everything in the cabin and not let too much water
come in. We thought at first he was joking. But, presently, we saw
the boat sailing away from us. Still, we didn't believe we were
sinking until, during the night, we were obliged to shut the little
windows to stop the water from flooding the cabin. At last,
thinking I heard steps overhead, I took up an empty bottle and
began to knock on the mast.&quot;</p>
<p>But Torre hardly listened. His thoughts were with Edie, and he
ground his teeth and stamped his foot with rage and pity at his own
impotence for help in her terrible plight. Then, taking no further
notice of his aunt, he went straight to Captain Sinclair and told
him the story.</p>
<p>&quot;I shouldn't wonder if that's what the gunboat wanted to
ask us about,&quot; commented the captain. &quot;Poor young lady!
It's a hard case. But what can we do? Here we are without as much
wind as would lift a lace veil. And even if we had a breeze and
could go in pursuit, the chances are we'd miss the boat. All the
same, I'd have a go for it, notwithstanding the passage, heaven
knows, bids fair to be long enough as it is. Thundering curious,
Leigh, that you should have found these relations of yours in such
a fix. Gad, you only got them out just in time! And, anyhow, I'm
afraid your uncle isn't going to last much longer. Old lady looks
as if she had a will of her own.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Too much will altogether,&quot; replied Torre gloomily, as
he stared up at the flattened sails hanging limply from their
yards, and swore under his breath&mdash;for he was in a hot rage
with thoughts and fears that burned within him like coals of fire.
Thus, when Laban Freeman, having heard from his mother who the
second mate of the <i>Cumberland</i> was, sauntered up and with a
condescending smile on his smug, bloated face offered his hand to
Torre, the latter struck it fiercely from him, and with a stare of
utter disdain and contempt walked away.</p>
<p>&quot;And sarve him right, the swab,&quot; chuckled Pugh;
&quot;he bolted like a bloomin' rabbit, and left his old mar to
work out her own salwation. An' if so be as her is a bit of a
tartar, I 'spect she's been an all right un to him.&quot;</p>
<p>And, presently, as the story got wind of how Mrs Bovey had tried
to force her step-daughter into marrying &quot;a dirty Dago,&quot;
and with that end in view, had actually allowed herself to be
persuaded into going for a cruise with a whole gang of them, the
pair found &quot;cold shoulder&quot; their portion fore and aft on
board the <i>Cumberland</i>. Even Pike, who was pining for company,
gave Laban no encouragement in the advances the other made to
him.</p>
<p>As for Mrs Bovey, she kept pretty closely to her cabin, in
attendance on her husband, whose flickering life grew lower almost
hourly. Nor did he ever regain sufficient possession of his senses
to recognise Torre ere that last hot breathless morning when he
died. And Torre mourned very sincerely for the poor, weak old man
who had always been kind to him as much as lay in the power of one
so dominated by the stronger-willed woman who called him husband,
but showed no grief, nor pretended to any at his loss. So they
buried him.</p>
<p>And the calm still held, and the heat drove the pitch out of the
deck-seams, and turned the water in the scuttle-butt thick and warm
and slimy, and the standing rigging grey, and blistered the paint,
even through the awnings, making men pant like thirsty dogs, and
sending Torre nearly crazy with horrible thoughts of that open boat
lying in the eye of the pitiless, scorching sun, perhaps not more
than fifty miles away; possibly only just over the flat, gleaming
ring of the horizon yonder. Poor Edie! poor dear Edie! his loving
little playmate come to such a pass! Adrift in this weather in a
small boat with a pack of scoundrels! No, it would not bear
thinking of! But there are thoughts that will not let themselves be
put away; and the young fellow's face grew strangely drawn and
haggard during these terrible days with the intrusion of them.</p>
<p>With his aunt he held no communication whatever. Indeed, both
she and her son kept well out of Torre's path, so menacing was his
expression when it fell on either of them. And on board ship, of
all places in the world, it is perhaps the most difficult for
people to escape from each other except by walking overboard.
Therefore the pair, mother and son, were not at all comfortable;
for, although the seaman of to-day is little more superstitious
than the average landsman, still, there were not wanting those
amongst the crew of the <i>Cumberland</i> who muttered
&quot;Jonahs!&quot; and in the privacy of their fok'sle cursed Mrs
Bovey and Laban as primary causes of that tormenting calm and heat,
so that black and unfriendly looks were their portion from the men.
And, although the captain and Curtis were polite enough to their
guests, they sympathised with their young shipmate far too much to
render their politeness other than of that chilly, negative
description that hurts. Besides, a calm at sea, when unduly
prolonged, like a drought on a station, renders all hands and the
cook ill-tempered, and the best friends abrupt and curt in their
communications. So that outsiders, and more especially obnoxious
outsiders, are apt to be regarded as intruders, and treated as
such. Thus the weather also indirectly helped to make Mrs Bovey and
her son feel very far from at home on the <i>Cumberland</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br>
&quot;GOOD-BYE, FARE YOU WELL&quot;</h2>
<p>BUT most things have an end; and so it proved with the calm. One
night, at sundown, sun and glass went down together, and all hands
started to work with a will to shorten sail for the expected blow.
Anything was better than the inaction of the last week, during
which Torre at least had eaten his heart out in impotent wrath and
weariness. By the time they had the vessel under her lower topsails
the heavens were black as pitch; so black that the men coming down
from the hot yards felt about with their feet like blind people as
they descended the hot rattlines, and stumbled against each other
as they fumbled along the hot decks, groping for and coiling up the
running gear. Suddenly came a tremendous crash of thunder, and from
the copper domes of her big steel lighthouses on the break of the
forecastle to her taffrail, the <i>Cumberland</i> flamed again with
a white intense blaze that made everything for just a second as
bright as strong sunlight could have done, and caused her men to
stagger and shut their eyes to the blinding brilliancy of it, then
feel themselves hurriedly to make sure they were unhurt, and stare
hopelessly into the woolly blackness in an attempt to discover
whether their sight was gone or not. And the curious thing about
this illumination was that from half-way up her lower-masts all was
dark as ever. It seemed quite unlike ordinary lightning, resembling
more a sheet of snow-white flame that had passed completely and
harmlessly along her decks fore and aft. Five minutes more of
anxious waiting and suspense, and then suddenly, as if a trap-door
in some riverbed had been opened above and directly over the ship,
down poured a roaring mass of water&mdash;falling not in drops but
in thick heavy sheets, drumming on thirsty decks and woodwork, and
almost beating to their knees the men who already stood up to their
knees in it. Scuppers were powerless to carry off such a deluge,
and with much trouble, and not before the water was four feet deep
on the main deck, some of the large ports were got open, through
which it poured as through the cleft bank of a dam. Then all of a
sudden the fall ceased in instantaneous uncanny fashion, as if the
trap-door had been slammed down, and at once stillness reigned
again, broken only by the drippings from drenched sails and the
choking gurgles of the scuppers.</p>
<p>&quot;Next!&quot; muttered the boatswain, shaking himself, as
with all hands he stood on the quarter-deck. &quot;This is another
five minnit hinterlood, I presoome. Wind, I s'pose, 'll be the next
hact of the drammer. But where from, when all's as black as the
Herl o' Hell's ridin' boots, it's 'ard to say! Is that you, Mr
Leigh?&quot; as a step descended the poop ladder.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, bo'sun,&quot; replied Torre. &quot;Stand by your
starboard braces some of you, and the others lie aft and clew up
the mizzen topsail and stow it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Glass still a-fallin', sir?&quot; asked Pugh, in the low
undertone that all men spoke in, if they spoke at all.</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, bo'sun,&quot; said Torre in a hoarse whisper.</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay, sir,&quot; muttered the other sympathisingly, for
he knew exactly what Torre was thinking about. &quot;I'm afraid
it'll be a case wi' her. There's a blow comin' that no open boat as
ever was built 'll be able to stan' agen. The only chanst is that
they've been picked up.&quot;</p>
<p>The last man was scarcely off the yard when a light puff took
the fore and main topsails aback. It was the first wind for ten
days, and it struck their wet faces as if it came out of an
oven.</p>
<p>Hardly were the yards trimmed than the sails were again
flattened into the mast, the wind seeming to shift all round the
compass. Away to the southwest there could be now heard a
continuous low moaning like the sound of breakers afar off on a
quiet night crooning against a coral reef.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank heaven!&quot; said Captain Sinclair. &quot;At last
we know where we're to get it from! I thought it never was going to
make up its mind. Brace up on the port tack to meet it, Mr Leigh;
set the mizzen staysail, and send another man to the
wheel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's getting clearer away to the south'ard,&quot; remarked
Torre to the bo'sun.</p>
<p>&quot;That ain't light, sir,&quot; replied the other grimly,
&quot;it's the reflection o' the white 'orses a-gallopin', as you
sees, a-comin' roarin' an' tearin' an' foamin' to try an' scoff us
in a single mouthful, as one might put it. Good lor', what a sea!
Hold on, sir, she'll be near on her beam-ends when it hits her.
Hold on all!&quot; he roared along the decks, only a minute before
that dull moaning, becoming louder and louder, suddenly burst into
a thunderous tumult of raging wind and wave that seemed at one
bound to leap on to the <i>Cumberland</i>, trusting in that mad and
furious onset to whelm and destroy her instantly. Over, over, over,
reeled the ship till the water poured in floods over her rail,
louder and shriller shrieked the wind through the rigging; great
masses of flying foam and spindrift hurtled clean across her hull
from windward, making a sort of phantasmal glimmer in the darkness
that helped to render the devilish rancour of wind and sea more
shocking, as the storm actually screamed and yelled with what
sounded, to the terrified crew hanging on for dear life, like the
veritable voice of some huge demon of the air.</p>
<p>Salt, or coals, or railway iron, or even wheat, or perhaps
anything but the lively and immovable wool she carried, and the
chances are that the ship would never have recovered herself as she
presently did, coming up slowly but surely right in the face of the
sea-fury that hurled itself at her with that first awful voice
split up now into a thousand strident shoutings and bellowings, and
lifted her great bows triumphantly to their attack, careless of
resounding shocks that made her whole fabric tremble and shudder.
An heroic sentient being indeed does a ship appear that emerges
victor and scatheless from such a battle as for half an hour the
<i>Cumberland</i> fought against an elemental charge that no man
there had ever seen the like of before.</p>
<p>All that night and next day the gale raged, but with nothing
near its first fury, nor was it felt to any appreciable extent, for
the yards had been squared, and foresail and upper topsails set,
and the <i>Cumberland</i> now ran before wind and sea fast to the
northward.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry, Leigh,&quot; the captain had said to Torre,
&quot;but in such weather it would be useless to search for the
boat, even if she were still afloat, which is more than doubtful.
Nor have we the slightest notion in which direction to steer. You
see, she's just as likely to be ahead as astern, to port as to
starboard. If the wind had come light, I'd have kept my promise and
run over nearly to the South American coast on spec. But
now!&quot;</p>
<p>And Torre knew that Captain Sinclair was not only correct in his
deductions, but quite hopeless as to the safety of the boat and its
people. So with a heavy heart he went about his work, feeling in
some sort as if he had seen Edie murdered before his eyes.</p>
<p>Strong winds carried the <i>Cumberland</i> to about 10&deg;
North, when, gradually breaking off and drawing ahead, they
resolved themselves into steady North East trades.</p>
<p>Of course the Boveys had been unable to save a thing from the
<i>Ysabel</i>; but it seemed that they really had taken very little
luggage of any kind with them, so hurried was their departure. Don
Sebastian, so Sinclair gathered, had represented the trip as merely
a short excursion, lasting no more than a week or so at the
outside, and they had gone aboard the yacht, which was moored just
below their villa, at midnight, helped up her sides by hands fresh
from the murder of the two unfortunate seamen who had charge. A big
religious festival was in progress at Funchal just then, presided
over by the Duke of Medina Sidonia in person, and thus they sailed
unmolested and unchallenged. And Mrs Bovey also volunteered the
statement that her stepdaughter, far from being in any way coerced,
was very pleased to leave the island. Don Sebastian, she
represented, too, as a person of most engaging manners and handsome
presence, between whom and Edie there had at least been friendship,
if nothing more. Indeed, it appeared that it was almost solely on
the girl's account that Mrs Bovey had been induced to make the
trip, hoping that the outcome of it might be a brilliant alliance
between Edie and the alleged Spanish noble. Thus the widow, on more
than one occasion, to Sinclair listening gravely and without
comment, as she went on to bewail the wickedness of the plot to
which they had been made victims; concluding always by warning the
captain against Torre, whose conduct she assured him was primarily
responsible for the death of her poor husband. She certainly wept
when told of the almost inevitable fate of the boat and those in
her, but this appearance of sorrow was curiously discounted by her
son, who blurted, &quot;Well, then, mar, you've got the five
hundred a year after all!&quot;</p>
<p>And then it transpired that by the terms of Mr Bovey's will,
drawn up at the time of his marriage with the widow Freeman, Edie
was to have had that sum paid out of the estate, otherwise settled
wholly on his wife. But in case of his daughter's death, or on her
making a marriage that should render such provision unnecessary, it
was to revert to Mrs Bovey.</p>
<p>This discovery set Sinclair thinking, and though he was
unwilling to believe that the woman had deliberately laid herself
out to bring about the former contingency, still he was pretty sure
that she had urged and hounded the poor girl on to receive the
attentions of a man whom she hated. And although he said nothing to
Torre about the matter, he hereafter shunned Mrs Bovey, and had as
little to say to her as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;Get your best Spanish ready again, bo'sun,&quot; said
Curtis one day in the tail of the trades, &quot;for if I'm not
mistaken, here's our friend the gunboat tubbing along after us once
more.&quot; Pugh grinned as he stared astern to where under a smoke
wreath something gleamed white against the blue background.
&quot;No, thankee, sir,&quot; said he, &quot;my wocabulary ain't
hextensive enough for another go. An' they mus' be lion 'earted men
to dar' tackle us agin, arter what I give 'em larst time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's the gunboat, right enough,&quot; said the captain, as
he got her in his glass. &quot;And she wants another talk,
evidently. Or else it's the King of Spain's birthday, for she's got
half the Code flying.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe, sir, she's heard something of the boat, or picked
up somebody belonging to her!&quot; said Curtis.</p>
<p>&quot;By Jove,&quot; replied the captain, &quot;I'd forgotten!
So she may. But, even then, Curtis, I don't see how she knows it
can affect us in any way. Unless she's got the girl. What a chance
that would be! Where's Leigh? Below? Oh, well, let him sleep. He's
had worry enough over the business already. And, yes, you may back
your foreyards or she won't catch us till night. I'm rather
curious. Pity we're none of us dabs at any lingo except our
own.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Boveys, sir,&quot; suggested Curtis, &quot;may have
enough of the language to find out what the Spaniard
wants&mdash;the Cub, especially, seems to have chummed up a good
deal with those villains of the <i>Ysabel</i>.&quot; And on Laban
being applied to, he declared, sure enough, that he had acquired a
sufficient smattering of Spanish to make himself a rough and ready
interpreter.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful morning, with a light warm breeze blowing,
before which the water rippled into wavelets sparkling in the sun.
Flying fish by the hundred took their jerky aerial flight and fell
spattering back into the sea; porpoises plunged and leapt in
uncouth frolicsome play around the bows, and ocean seemed to smile
a great, warm, cheerful smile as the asthmatic cough of the
gunboat's high-pressure engines drew nearer and more near.</p>
<p>Mrs Bovey sat close to her son, who was somewhat nervously
fingering a Spanish &quot;conversation&quot; book, for which,
however, as it proved, there was to be no use.</p>
<p>As the <i>Nostra Senhora del Carmen</i> approached, it was
observed that her black funnel was coated with a thick crust of
salt, and that her paddle boxes showed ugly rents in them. But the
significance of this was lost in the extraordinary spectacle her
forward deck presented as she drew alongside the <i>Cumberland</i>.
To a stout iron bar running right across it were fettered by heavy
irons around waist and ankle six ruffianly-looking men at sight of
whom Mrs Bovey, who had risen from her seat and walked over to the
rail, uttered a little cry and hurriedly drew back, whilst her son
stared open-mouthed and open-eyed as the six lifted their manacled
hands in momentary wonder and dismay when they recognised the
features of their supposed victims.</p>
<p>&quot;By G&mdash;d, they've got 'em, I do believe!&quot;
exclaimed Curtis in his excitement; &quot;but where's the girl?
Yes, by the Holy Sailor, there's a lady coming up on to the bridge
now! It must be she!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hoorore!&quot; all at once shouted somebody on the main
deck, and in a trice a great cheer arose that awoke Torre and
brought him on the scene in a very short time. &quot;It's her, I'll
swear, Mr Leigh, sir!&quot; exclaimed the bo'sun, pointing and
waving his cap as Torre stared at the tall slight figure on the
bridge and then rushed on to the poop.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that Edie?&quot; he exclaimed, roughly shaking the
still motionless Laban by the shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes&mdash;yes,&quot; stammered the other, apparently
unable to take his eyes off the prisoners, who, now recovered from
their astonishment, jeered at him with insulting words and
gestures. &quot;It's Edie, of course; and number three, counting
from here, is the Don.&quot;</p>
<p>As he spoke, his mother ran to the side with a double-barrelled
gun in her hand, which she aimed full at the latter, who screamed
and dragged himself along the bar amidst his equally terrified
companions, whilst the Spanish sailors scattered right and left.
Luckily the captain was close to her, and rushing up he snatched
the weapon, which she had taken out of his own room, from the
infuriated woman, who thereupon abused him in unmeasured terms and
was presently haled to her berth and locked up, still raving.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Spaniards had got a boat into the water and, with
Edie, had pulled round to the starboard gangway, where Torre met
and introduced himself to her, seeing much in the dark face and
eyes, sensitive lips and firmly rounded chin, to remind him of his
little playmate of long ago. She looked well, too, in spite of a
certain sadness of expression; she was also an undeniably pretty,
almost beautiful girl. And as Torre walked up to the captain
holding her by the hand, he felt proud of her, and his heart was
light within him for the relief and joy of her rescue.</p>
<p>Actually, the man o' war had fallen in with the <i>Ysabel's</i>
boat on the second day after leaving the <i>Cumberland</i>, and
whilst making towards the coast. There had been a scuffle, also, in
which two of the band had been so badly hurt that they died almost
at once. But Edie had been well cared for. Indeed, they had rigged
up a sort of canvas shelter for her, and treated her with some show
of respect as their leader's future wife. She was to have been
compelled to marry Don Sebastian on their arrival at Paranagua.
That worthy's name and title, by the way, was only one of a dozen
aliases. He was a tenfold murderer; an escaped convict; in fact, a
felon of the first water, pre-eminent even amongst the felon crew
he led, everyone of whom was utterly certain of the garotte.</p>
<p>After seizing the boat, the <i>Senhora</i> had called at
Trinidad, and then making homeward been caught in the same
hurricane that the <i>Cumberland</i> weathered so nobly, and driven
many leagues out of her course. Would, indeed, but for the merciful
interposition of &quot;Our Lady of the Sea,&quot; have certainly
gone to the bottom. All this from the Spanish officers and Edie,
who interpreted fluently, and was evidently an object of much
admiration to them. In honour of the occasion champagne had been
opened, and it and talk flowed at the saloon table. Edie had
grieved for her father, of whose death and that of the others she
had felt assured. And she was astonished beyond measure to hear not
only that Mr Bovey had been rescued to die on the
<i>Cumberland</i>, but that his wife and her son were even now on
board.</p>
<p>&quot;They have been worse than unkind to me, Torre,&quot; she
said. &quot;But when I saw those wretches fastening them up in the
Ysabel to drown slowly, whilst wagering amongst themselves how long
it would take for her to sink, I freely forgave them. As for poor
dear father his days were numbered; he was for long intervals
unconscious, knowing nobody, and I had taught myself to look
forward to his release from misery as almost a desirable thing. But
not in that way! Not in that way! And, oh, I can't express to you
how happy it has made me to know that although he may not have been
aware of it, he had you with him at the last. Even his wife, cold
and selfish as she is, must have felt grateful for such a wonderful
rescue from such a death.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She didn't show it then, Edie, I can assure you,&quot;
replied Torre, smiling a little, &quot;nor did the Cub, as they
call him here. Took it, indeed, very much as a matter of
course.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will never go back and live with them, Torre,&quot; said
the girl. &quot;Do you know, at times I almost feel wicked enough
to think that Mrs Bovey wants the money poor father left me. Surely
she has enough of her own.&quot;</p>
<p>And then for the first time Torre heard of what Captain Sinclair
had already discovered. And his jaw set and his eyes glittered
ominously as he listened, whilst Edie went on to tell him of the
persecution she had been exposed to in the matter of the ci-devant
Don Sebastian; and how at last she was decoyed on board the yacht
by a pretence that the doctor had ordered her father to be taken a
sea trip at once, for which purpose, Mrs Bovey told her, Don
Sebastian had kindly offered his vessel. The Don himself, she
learnt from the same source, in place of accompanying them, was
going to the other side of the island. And only too pleased to be
free of him, she consented without demur.</p>
<p>&quot;I have an idea, Miss Bovey,&quot; said Curtis, presently,
as he listened. &quot;Let us get rid of the pair&mdash;if our
Spanish friends will take them. I don't think they'll be sorry to
go. And I'm certain we shan't mind losing them. In any case, of
course, we should keep you, but it will be more comfortable for you
without them. And that woman's not safe. Another minute and she'd
have riddled the Don with buckshot. I'm really half sorry, now I've
heard your story, that the skipper didn't let her do it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A capital notion, Mr Curtis,&quot; said Torre eagerly.
&quot;If you'll ask these Spaniards, Edie, I think I can answer for
Laban and his mother.&quot;</p>
<p>And presently it was so arranged, mother and son being well
pleased to be clear of the <i>Cumberland</i>. Mrs Bovey, in
particular, gloating over the notion of being able to watch the
captivity of her late confederate&mdash;the man she had tried to
make a tool of, but who had turned the tables on her with such
almost fatal effect. She said no word of farewell to either Edie or
Torre, but got into the boat with a grim, expectant, satisfied
expression, as of one who sees a dear wish realised and proceeds to
the enjoyment of it.</p>
<p>After a ceremonious farewell, the Spanish officers took their
departure, and amidst a volley of cheers the gunboat's paddles
revolved; the chained <i>ladrones</i> howled and clanked their
fetters, watched greedily from the bridge by a woman who appeared
to have eyes for nothing else, whilst with a sigh of relief Torre
turned to Edie, saying, &quot;I hope, dear, you'll never see those
two any more. You shall come and live with May and me on board our
ship.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Torre,&quot; replied Edie, &quot;but if it's
all the same to you, I think I prefer dry land. Come into your
berth, you big, grave, engaged-to-be-married man, and tell me all
about your May, and everything that has been doing and
happening.&quot; They talked all through Torre's watch below, and
Edie looked curiously at the enlarged and framed photograph of May
Darnell that hung at the foot of Torre's bunk, and praised the
face, which she could well afford to do, seeing that it was not
nearly as pretty as her own with its rich, dark colouring and
regular features. Still, even in the cold photo, the rare beauty of
the eyes seemed to light up the whole picture. And Edie hit the
mark when she said it was a comely face, and a face that grew and
gained on one the more it was looked at. They had much to talk of,
these two so strangely met; and, day by day, Torre was glad to see
the girl becoming more cheerful and losing the sad, wistful look
that had been the first thing to strike him in her expression. And
presently he began to see that all direction of her future would be
taken out of his hands by Curtis, who had fallen head over heels in
love with Edie, and whose suit seemed to be prospering. Torre was
pleased, for he knew what a good and genuine fellow the chief mate
was&mdash;&quot;white all through,&quot; as Pugh put it. Feeling in
<i>loco parentis</i>, he would, without scruple, have interfered
had it been somebody he could not approve of.</p>
<p>But in his friend's case there was no call for interference, and
Torre, with the rest of the ship, looked on sympathetically enough
till the crisis came, and he was told as a great secret by Edie
what for a long time had been very patent to all hands except the
pair themselves.</p>
<p>They had struck English ground that very day&mdash;not with the
ship, but with the deep sea lead which had brought some of it to
upper air in the shape of white sand and small shells, letting them
know they really were in the Fairway of the English Channel, and
groping their track correctly through the thick fog. This, however,
presently cleared, and off Plymouth they took a tug and practically
finished a not uneventful voyage.</p>
<p>The <i>Enchantress</i>, they found, had arrived a fortnight
before them; and proceedings were about to commence in the
Admiralty Court with regard to the salvage claims. A heap of
letters, many of them from May, made Torre happy. Edie went home
with Captain Sinclair to his mother, who lived at Stoke Newington.
Curtis and she, it had been settled, were to be married as soon as
he passed his examination for Master. Edie wished him to leave the
sea. They would be able to live, she said, quietly on her money.
But Curtis, although not loving the sea for its own sake like Torre
and May, could not see his way to do this. So Edie gave in,
somewhat consoled by the reflection that when he took command of
the promised steamer of Fibre and Co.'s, the trips would be short,
and that she might often accompany him if she wished.</p>
<p>In a week or so Torre went up and passed. The <i>viva voce</i>
examiner was a rather crusty old captain who regarded the majority
of second mates with suspicion, looking hard at their cuffs, and
noting how often they opened watches in whose cases might be
concealed hints respecting the reeving of Spanish burtons, or the
cunningly devised question anent the upper side of a lower-brace
block.</p>
<p>But soon discovering that in Torre he had different metal to
deal with, he went at him <i>con amore</i>, forgetting quite when
to stop. That morning he had sent four young men back to sea for
six months more practice. It was near his lunch time, and he had
made up his mind to serve Torre in the same way. Instead, he became
interested, and wandered away from the &quot;Rule of the Road&quot;
to unshipping a rudder, management of ground tackle, etc., etc. The
former was an operation which Torre, although describing correctly,
admitted he had never seen; but, considering his somewhat limited
experience, he passed a very good chief officer's <i>viva voce</i>
in addition to a second mate's.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the examiner, at length consulting his
watch with a start of surprise, &quot;you've done very well indeed,
sir,&mdash;and ruined my lunch. If you were up for chief mate, and
you had got through the clerical part, I certainly should have
passed you here. You'll have no trouble whatever when your time
entitles you to come up again for another certificate. With decent
luck you'll be Master in a couple or three years. And you evidently
are fond of the sea. I wish some of the other people who come here
and torment me were so too.&quot;</p>
<p>A week later Curtis also passed for Master, with a supplementary
pass in steam. And shortly afterwards he and Edie were married and
went away to the Lakes for their honeymoon, Torre taking his place
on board the <i>Cumberland</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Enchantress</i> had gone into a private dock, a good way
up the river. But, one day, Harris and Sam and old Horn travelled
to the South West India Dock half beside themselves with excitement
and eagerness to discharge the great news they were laden with.
Torre caught sight of them whilst they were yet some distance
away&mdash;Harris well ahead, the others waddling and rolling in
his wake. All three, as soon as they saw him standing at the main
hatchway of the <i>Cumberland</i>, took off their hats and waved
them and roared at him, whilst Harris broke into a run and,
disdaining gangways, leapt the rail and exclaimed breathlessly,
&quot;Three each for us, old chap! And FOUR for you! Such
luck!&quot; and then he got hold of Torre's hand and began to shake
it frantically.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, what's the matter now?&quot; laughed Torre, although
with a shrewd guess at the news. &quot;Three&mdash;four,
what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thousan' pounds!&quot; panted the others, arriving
simultaneously and reaching in turns for Torre's hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Salvage awards just out,&quot; said Harris, beaming with
smiles and speaking very distinctly and slowly. &quot;Four thousand
pounds for you; three thousand each for the rest of us, and the
same for Fibre and Co. Case never went into Court at all, my boy.
Settled by mutual consent. And I think it's liberal, don't
you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Much more than I expected,&quot; replied Torre as he
placed decanters on the table. &quot;You'll all be able now to come
home with me as passengers in the <i>Cumberland</i>,&quot; he added
half jokingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Eh? what!&quot; exclaimed Harris staring, with a glass
arrested at his lips. &quot;No thank you! Mail steamer for us, I
think. What d'you say, Horn?&quot;</p>
<p>Old Horn smiled till all his brown, lean face seemed a mass of
leathery wrinkles. &quot;Three&mdash;thousan'&mdash;poun's!&quot;
said he very slowly and lovingly, &quot;An' to go back in a blasted
lime-juicer! No, Mister Leigh, sir. That there <i>Enchantress</i>
give me a bellyful o' win' jammers. Sartainly, she've paid for it.
But onless ye makes a pint of it, I'm for gittin' home as quick as
steam can take me. Ye see, sir, I'm not as young as I was, an' the
sooner I gits settled in a leetle cottage I knows on in Balmain,
close to Mat Bacon's, the better for my 'ealth. There's a garden
an' a fowl run an' a flagstaff an' a fine view o' the Harbour. But,
as I says, if ye makes&mdash;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said Torre, laughing, &quot;I was only
joking, old friend. Get away as soon as you can and have a
well-earned rest for the remainder of your days. Where's
Mat?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was coming with us,&quot; replied the old man, drawing
a long breath of relief on finding that his loyalty to Torre was,
after all, not to be put to the test in such a disagreeable
fashion, &quot;only he ain't very well. Fust thing he does,
carryin' on like any bloomin' Dook, he telegrafts a couple o'
hundred poun's to the ole woman in Balmain. Then he takes his
passidge in the nex' steamer. Then he gits too full to walk or talk
or wink. So we has to leave 'im. But he'll be down bimebye to see
ye, sir. Bolivar an' Turnips an' Mag is all well. An' glad they'll
be to git away outer these fogs an' the everlastin' drizzle an'
slush.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, Leigh,&quot; broke in Harris impatiently,
&quot;surely you'll come with us? Fancy a second mate with a
fortune! Why, it's an anomaly&mdash;an utter absurdity! It's
worse&mdash;a crime!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not a fortune,&quot; replied Torre. &quot;And surely
you don't think I'd throw up my profession for a few thousand
pounds, do you? Just as I've got a fair start after all my
troubles?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite mad!&quot; exclaimed Harris. &quot;Raving!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; laughed Torre, &quot;that's a matter of
opinion. I'm never so happy as when at sea. It must have got into
my soul when I was born, I suppose. And, after all, it hasn't
served me so very badly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All the more reason then for leaving the treacherous thing
before it turns on you,&quot; urged Harris. &quot;For my part I
hardly like trusting it to take me back again to Annie.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the book?&quot; asked Torre.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I'd almost forgotten that,&quot; replied Harris
naively. &quot;Anyhow, I daresay it'll keep until after the
honeymoon. Probably we shall settle down on a bit of ground in the
country. Annie's great on poultry-farming and dairying and bees and
things. And how about yourselves, Torre?&quot; he added
significantly.</p>
<p>&quot;Stettle down at sea, the pair of us,&quot; replied Torre
decidedly, and affecting not to hear the muttered reference his
friend made to Gladesville.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p class="quote"><sup>1</sup> A lunatic asylum near Sydney.</p>
<p>&quot;And what are you going to do with your pile, Sam?&quot;
asked Torre.</p>
<p>&quot;Bli me, sir, but I 'ardly knows just yit,&quot; replied
Sam grinning, &quot;'cept that there ain't no more deep water fer
this child. Not much! I was thinkin' 'bout startin' to run a bit ov
a pub, only I'm scared o' bein' too good a customer meself. But,
arter all, I reckon it'll be a tug. Mat's arst me to go mates in
the spec. An' there's room in Port Jackson fer another good boat.
An',&quot; concluded he emphatically, &quot;wotever we does, you
kin pound on us not to forgit him as all our luck comes
through.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Sam,&quot; replied Torre, &quot;but all that
was only chance. And there was no chance work about what you did
for the poor runaway kiddy who came to you on board the old
<i>Yatala!</i>&quot;</p>
<p>So, in a few more days, Torre saw his old mates of the <i>Mary
Robinson</i> off in the R.M.S. <i>Orizaba</i>, bound back again for
the shores of sunny New South Wales. And presently, the
<i>Cumberland</i> herself spread her great wings and started on the
long stretch round Good Hope. And she carried, too, in spite of all
precedent, a newly married chief officer and his wife. But Captain
Sinclair knew it was safe to accord this privilege to Curtis.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>&quot;Gabo Island; passed ship <i>Cumberland</i> from London to
Sydney. Asks to be reported 'all well,' &quot; was the message
that, many weeks later, met some anxious eyes as they scanned the
daily newspaper.</p>
<p>And thus it happened that whilst the Heads of Port Jackson lay
still a good eighty miles to the northward, and long before she
could be expected in the usual order of things, there hove in sight
a big double-funnelled boat steaming straight for the ship.</p>
<p>&quot;Can't be a tug yet, surely,&quot; said the captain.
&quot;They never run down this far. And she's like a fair with
flags!&quot; he added, staring through his glass.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Torre,&quot; exclaimed Mrs Curtis, who stood near,
radiant with health and happiness, &quot;if it should be May coming
to meet you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nonsense, Edie,&quot; replied Torre, laughing, but
nevertheless with a hopeful face and beating heart. &quot;That
would be too much to expect so far out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By jingo, I see dresses fluttering, anyhow!&quot; said
Curtis, putting down his binoculars and glancing quizzically at
Torre. &quot;And, my word, how they're sending her!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our House-flag at the steamer's foremast, sir,&quot; all
at once said Torre to the captain.</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay, Mr Leigh,&quot; laughed Sinclair, &quot;and unless
I'm very much mistaken, your House-flag aft! Mr Curtis, get all the
light canvas off the ship. Mr Leigh, hoist the Ensign and
House-flag, and send some hands to rig the starboard
gangway.&quot;</p>
<p>As the boat, a large and powerful screw-tug, approached, and the
<i>Cumberland</i> lay to and backed her yards for her, a whole
crowd of familiar faces could be seen amidst the waving of hats,
bunting, and handkerchiefs. Aft stood Mr Moore and Barker, and Mrs
Barker and May. On the bridge alongside Mat Bacon, who was
evidently the captain, were Harris and Sam and old Horn, shouting
themselves hoarse as they recognised Torre. And of all people in
the world with a tenacious hatred of the sea, rather limp, but
mustering energy enough to flourish an umbrella wildly, was
Jenkins.</p>
<p>And presently, up the <i>Cumberland's</i> weather-worn side they
came, received by her officers in full fig at the gangway in
regular big ship style, whilst Pugh and all hands looked on with
much interest from the main deck. &quot;Eighty-four days,
captain,&quot; said Mr Moore, shaking Sinclair's hand.
&quot;Splendid passage, sir! Didn't believe it was in
her!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Torre, how you have grown!&quot; exclaimed Mrs
Barker, bestowing a hearty maternal kiss upon him.</p>
<p>And so they all crowded round with congratulations and
welcomings, making it difficult for Torre to escape to where May
stood a little distance away.</p>
<p>But, at last, slipping out of the group, he joined his
sweetheart. And as he marked with delight how the dear face blushed
rosy red at his approach, and then as quickly grew pale again with
emotion, Torre hesitated for a moment as he took her hand half
timidly, almost unable to credit that a rough sailor like himself
should have any claim or share to such a dainty bit of female
perfection as this one appeared. But when he saw the love light
shining in those deep grey eyes he had so often dreamt of during
lonely sea-watches, and noted the trembling of the scarlet lips so
often pressed to his, he plucked up courage, and clasping her in
his arms, took toll of them again and again, unperceived for a
moment by any of the rest.</p>
<p>Then old Horn, catching sight of them, suddenly roared
&quot;Hooroar fer a sailor an' a sailor's sweetheart!&quot; and
Edie, glancing across, swooped down on May, and, unheeding Torre's
protest, haled her away to her own state-room &quot;for a good
talk.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind, my boy,&quot; said Mr Barker, &quot;you'll
have lots of time for that sort of thing presently. I've got news
for you. The missus has let down the slip-rails, removed the
embargo, you know. She sees it's no use hanging on for that other
twelve months. So you can order the parson and trimmings as soon as
you like. With your peculiar notions I suppose you'll be married in
an open boat outside the Heads, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>But Torre was too happy to listen to the old squatter's chaff,
and as the tug caught hold of the <i>Cumberland</i>, and began to
drag her homeward he dived below for another minute's sight of
May.</p>
<p>And here I will leave my son of the sea, young, sanguine,
prosperous; happy with his friends around him; on the point of
realising his dearest hope; and of still continuing in his loved
profession.</p>
<p>Faithfully I have endeavoured to take my readers through the
early years of a career that may be fairly termed one of incident
and worthy of record. Yet not by any means an impossible one;
inasmuch as for almost every scene and character in the little
drama, no resort to fiction has been necessary.</p>
<p>So for awhile, in the words of the fine old chanty that will
ring round the world's seas whilst ever the Red Ensign flies from
sailers' peak, and British Merchant Jack still finds a home in
British forecastles, &quot;Good-bye, fare you well.&quot;</p>
