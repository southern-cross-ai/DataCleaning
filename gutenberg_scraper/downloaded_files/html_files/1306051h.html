  <p class="first">MR HERBERT FALLOWILL made his final entry on a square card
  almost covered with his neat and microscopic writing, took up the dead end of
  his cigar from the edge of the ash-tray and lit it. He was a square-built
  man, clean-shaven, except for a fiery moustache, and his reddish hair ran
  back from a forehead that was high and bald.</p>

  <p>'You leave for Queenstown to-night?' he said, and the thin-lipped woman
  who bore his name nodded.</p>

  <p>'The passports?'</p>

  <p>'Yours is in the name of "Clancy",' he said. 'Mine is fixed. I shall leave
  as arranged by the <i>Aquitania</i>. You'll meet me at the apartment on 44th
  Street&mdash;I shall be there at eleven-fifteen. This is the
  time-table&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He fixed a pair of pince-nez on his thick nose and consulted the card.</p>

  <p>'At nine o'clock Dorford will give me the cheque; at nine- thirty it will
  be cashed, and I shall move to Southampton&mdash;quick! I have relay cars
  waiting at Guildford and Winchester. The <i>Aquitania</i> leaves dock at
  twelve-thirty&mdash;I shall make it, with time to spare. The old man will not
  expect to see me again on the Saturday or Sunday because I've told him I'm
  going away. Monday is a holiday and the banks are closed. The earliest he can
  discover anything is by Tuesday morning.'</p>

  <p>She took out the cigarette she was smoking and blew a cloud to the
  ceiling.</p>

  <p>'That old man is certainly dippy!' she said, shaking her head.</p>

  <p>Mr Fallowill smiled indulgently.</p>

  <p>'There never was a pure scientist that wasn't,' he said. 'Only so very few
  of 'em have the stuff.'</p>

  <p>Professor Dorford had no illusions about himself. Business of all kinds
  worried him, and he accounted himself fortunate that, after a succession of
  incompetents, heaven had sent him a most capable middle-aged secretary, who
  combined an exceptional knowledge of finance with a capacity for knowing just
  what the Professor would say in answer to people who pester a rich man with
  requests for subscriptions or charitable assistance.</p>

  <p>He would have gone farther and favoured his secretary with a power of
  attorney which would enable him to draw small cheques for the tradespeople,
  but here Gwenn Dorford, a nineteen-year-old graduate, put her small foot down
  very firmly.</p>

  <p>'My dear lamb!' she said, and when the Professor was addressed as a dear
  lamb in that tone of voice, he invariably shivered.</p>

  <p>'Fallowill is a most excellent man,' he protested feebly.</p>

  <p>'I don't like Mr Fallowill, and I loathe his wife,' said Gwenn, 'but I
  realize that I may be prejudiced&mdash;and, after all, a woman can be a good
  wife and still be a cat to everybody else. Mr Spooner, the bank manager,
  says&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Spooner is an interfering jackanapes,' said the Professor testily. 'I am
  seriously thinking of taking my account away from the Gresham Bank.
  To&mdash;er&mdash;impugn Fallowill's&mdash;er&mdash;honour is monstrous! He
  had letters from eminent people in Australia and the United States.'</p>

  <p>Nobody knew better than Gwenn Dorford that her father had not verified
  these excellent references, but she did not press the matter to an
  argument.</p>

  <p>She did, however, tell Johnny Brest for the fortieth time, and for the
  fortieth time Johnny sympathised with her. But then, Johnny would. He was
  tactful, as became an officer in the Public Prosecutor's department and a
  lawyer at that; he was sympathetic, because&mdash;Gwenn was very pretty and
  he carried her portrait in his cigarette case.</p>

  <p>'He may be all right,' he said. 'I went over to New Scotland yard and
  tried to find out whether anything was known about him&mdash;he is quite a
  stranger to police headquarters.'</p>

  <p>'I don't wish him to become acquainted through us,' she said firmly. 'He
  may be the nicest man in the world, but the way daddy trusts him makes my
  hair stand up! And now, Johnny, you can take me a long drive in your pot
  boiler.'</p>

  <p>Johnny Brest was the owner of a steam car, because that was the only kind
  of car he could afford to buy. Not that such machines are cheap. They were
  certainly rare in England&mdash;so rare that, when one was offered for sale
  by auction, Johnny, who had drifted into the rooms out of curiosity, heard
  the car offered at so ridiculously low a figure that, in a moment of
  recklessness, he bid, and found himself the proprietor of a machine that
  nobody understood. It was only then that he discovered the secret of its
  propulsion.</p>

  <p>Mr Fallowill watched the noiseless white car slip down the drive and
  disappear from view, as he had watched it scores of times. He felt easier in
  his mind when the antagonistic daughter of his employer was away from the
  house, and more especially was he relieved that afternoon.</p>

  <p>Returning to his desk, he cleared off his correspondence and went in
  search of Professor Dorford. The Professor looked up as his secretary
  entered. He was a grey, bent man with a vague manner and a trick of ignoring
  the immediate. Fallowill said of him, with truth, that he lived from three
  days to ten years behind his time, and certainly it was the fact that most
  days were gone before John Dorford was aware that they had arrived.</p>

  <p>'Ah, Fallowill! Come in, come in, please. Will you get on to Sir Roland
  Field&mdash;Cambridge 99 or 999&mdash;or perhaps it is some other
  number&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Cambridge 9714,' said the secretary.</p>

  <p>'Of course! I was sure you would remember. Will you be so good as to ask
  him if I am&mdash;er&mdash;mad in supposing that the sodium lines disappeared
  from the spectrum this morning? It is an extraordinary fact, my dear
  Fallowill, that when I was making a very superficial examination of the sun's
  spectrum, those lines appeared and disappeared, and finally vanished
  altogether for the space of twelve minutes!'</p>

  <p>Fallowill inclined his head and adopted the requisite expression of
  amazement. The peculiarities of the sun's spectrum meant nothing to him.
  Inwardly he cursed his employer's dislike of the telephone, for he knew his
  own limitations, and a scientific discussion on a long-distance wire was
  beyond him.</p>

  <p>'Certainly, sir. Did you think any more about the matter I mentioned to
  you?'</p>

  <p>The Professor scratched his head in perplexity.</p>

  <p>'The matter&mdash;now what was that, Fallowill?'</p>

  <p>'The question of transferring your balance to the Wales and Western
  bank.'</p>

  <p>Professor Dorford sighed&mdash;he always sighed when money was a subject
  of discussion.</p>

  <p>'Yes, yes, of course, Fallowill. I quite agree, and I shall certainly act
  on your advice. I will make the transfer&mdash;when?'</p>

  <p>'Saturday is the end of the month!' suggested Fallowill.</p>

  <p>Even Gwenn paid a grudging acknowledgement to Mr Fallowill's financial
  genius, and justly so. For, in various names and in divers countries, he had
  so manipulated the finances of confiding investors that it had been necessary
  from time to time to make startling changes in his appearance. And now he had
  rendered the Professor an immense service. Foreseeing the industrial slump,
  he had induced his employer to turn all but his government stock into
  money.</p>

  <p>'Saturday? Yes,' said the Professor. 'When is Saturday?'</p>

  <p>'To-morrow,' replied the other. 'Brighton Rails are down to three. We got
  out of those in time! I was calculating to-day that, if you hadn't started
  selling when I suggested, you would have been eight thousand to the bad. You
  can't make a mistake by holding the cash instead. Short term loans pay very
  little interest, but you have the money to jump into the market when it
  strikes bottom.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly,' murmured Mr Dorford agreeably. 'I'm greatly obliged to you,
  Fallowill. And now will you get Sir Roland?'</p>

  <p>Waiting for the call to come through, the sturdy secretary marshalled his
  knowledge of the spectrum. He knew that when the rays of the sun passed
  through a prism it threw bands of variegated light on a screen. He knew that
  there was a more complicated apparatus which showed in the rainbow hue bright
  and dark lines which indicated the presence in the sun of certain elements.
  To keep pace with his employer's requirements, he had struggled through
  various text-books on the subject, and knew, therefore, that sodium was one
  of the more important of the solar elements.</p>

  <p>It was some time before he got his call through to Sir Roland, and that
  aged gentleman, who shared his fellow scientist's dislike of the telephone,
  was in his most irritable mood.</p>

  <p>'What's that? Sodium&mdash;who wants sodium? Is it Dorford himself? What
  do you want, my good fellow?'</p>

  <p>'The Professor wishes to know if you have observed the absence of sodium
  lines in the spectrum,' said the patient Fallowill.</p>

  <p>'No, I haven't,' snapped the other. 'Nor has he! You've made a mistake.
  Get back and tell him to write!'</p>

  <p>Crash! went the telephone receiver, and Fallowill went back to his
  employer to report the result of the conversation. Professor Dorford rubbed
  his chin nervously.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps I was wrong,' he said. 'It may have been some trick of eyesight,
  but certainly the sodium lines disappeared at eleven-sixteen this
  morning.'</p>

  <p>'Remarkable, sir,' said Fallowill politely.</p>

  <p>He lived in West Kensington, and travelled home by tube. His mind was so
  occupied with the possibilities which to-morrow held that, although he read
  his evening newspaper, he did not comprehend a single word until his eye was
  held by a headline: <span class="smcap">'Extraordinary Traffic Block.'</span>
  And then the figures '11.15' arrested him.</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">At 11.15 this morning a most extraordinary traffic block
  occurred in the heart of the City. By an amazing coincidence, three
  motor-buses stopped of their own accord in the narrowest part of Cheapside,
  and could not be moved for a quarter of an hour. As it was the rush hour, the
  street was soon filled with stationary cars. This in itself might not have
  been remarkable, but the same phenomenon was witnessed in the Strand, on
  Ludgate Hill and in other parts of the City.</p><br>

  <p>He was waiting on the platform for the car to slow into South Kensington
  Station when the conductor, whom he knew by sight, looked at the paper he was
  carrying.</p>

  <p>`Queer thing, that traffic stoppage,' he said. 'It happened down
  here.'</p>

  <p>'On the tubes?' asked Fallowill in surprise, and the man nodded.</p>

  <p>'Yes, we slowed down and all the lights went out. Somebody told me that it
  was a magnetic storm. I know the telegraph lines weren't working.'</p>

  <p>'Queer,' agreed Fallowill, and went home to help his wife pack.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">GWENN DORFORD did not as a rule see her father before the
  lunch hour. He was an early riser, and usually closeted himself in his study
  until midday, and it was a rule of the establishment that he should not be
  interrupted. She was passing his room an hour before lunch and, seeing the
  door open, looked in. The Professor was standing at the window, his hands in
  his pockets, staring moodily into the sunlit street.</p>

  <p>'Good morning, daddy. Aren't you working?'</p>

  <p>He looked round with a start.</p>

  <p>'No, no, my dear,' he said a little nervously. 'I'm&mdash;er&mdash;not
  working. I'm going out. Who is that?' He stared past her. 'Oh, it is you,
  Johnny&mdash;Come in, come in. Are you staying to lunch?'</p>

  <p>'I'm taking Gwenn to Hampton Court,' said Johnny Brest.</p>

  <p>'So you are! Of course, I remember.'</p>

  <p>Dorford looked at his watch, and for some remarkable reason the girl felt
  a little twinge of alarm.</p>

  <p>'Where is Mr Fallowill?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Gone to the bank,' said the Professor a little huskily. 'And, Gwenn, the
  sodium lines are gone again. Remarkable! Sodium has disappeared from the
  sun!'</p>

  <p>'Why has Mr Fallowill gone to the bank?' she asked, not interested for the
  moment in sodium and its eccentricities.</p>

  <p>The Professor looked appealingly to the young man.</p>

  <p>'I think I have been rather a fool, Gwenn. It is extraordinary that I
  should think so, but I do. Though I'm sure Fallowill is as honest as the day,
  but&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'What have you done?' she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>'I've given him&mdash;er&mdash;a cheque for eighty-four thousand
  pounds&mdash;he is transferring my account,' said the Professor, and the hand
  that went up to his mouth was shaking. 'You see, I have a whole lot of fluid
  capital, and Fallowill thought that it would be better in another bank.'</p>

  <p>She gasped.</p>

  <p>'You've given him the cheque? But will Mr Spooner pay?'</p>

  <p>'I wrote a letter also. Spooner telephoned up to ask if it was all right,
  and I said yes.'</p>

  <p>'To what bank was it to be paid, Mr Dorford?'</p>

  <p>'The Wales and Western.'</p>

  <p>'We can easily find out,' said Johnny, and took up the telephone. He
  jerked the hook for a long rime, and then: 'Your phone is out of order.'</p>

  <p>'I know.' The Professor nodded. 'I tried to get the bank five minutes
  ago.'</p>

  <p>He was still looking out of the window, his mind apparently concentrated
  on the fruitless efforts of a chauffeur to start a car on the opposite side
  of the road.</p>

  <p>'That is strange,' he said.</p>

  <p>'But, father, why don't you drive round to the bank and ask?'</p>

  <p>'I thought of doing that,' he said. 'In fact, I've sent Mary to get a
  taxi, and here she is.'</p>

  <p>A hot and flustered housemaid appeared in the doorway.</p>

  <p>'None of the taxis are going, sir,' she gasped.</p>

  <p>'Going? What do you mean?'</p>

  <p>'The street's full of cabs and cars and they're all standing still! They
  can't move them, sir. And if you please, sir, none of the telephones are
  working... a man told me the electric lights have gone too...'</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">WITH a large wad of American bills in his inside pocket, Mr
  Fallowill moved out of town, exercising that caution which experience had
  taught him was profitable. An annoyed traffic policeman might make all the
  difference between the success and failure of his scheme. Once beyond Barnes
  and out of Kingston, he stepped on the accelerator and the big car roared
  along the Portsmouth road at sixty miles an hour. Beyond Cobham there was a
  hill to negotiate, and, reaching the crest, he turned the car at full speed
  down the steep slope.</p>

  <p>And then he heard something and frowned. The engine had stopped, and the
  car was running downhill under its own weight and impetus. If he had any
  doubt, it was settled when he came to the foot of the slope. A slight rise a
  hundred yards along slowed the car, and he had to put on the brakes to
  prevent the machine from running backwards. Fortunately, there was a wayside
  inn within a hundred yards, and, after making an ineffectual effort to
  restart the machine, he walked to the hostel.</p>

  <p>To his relief, he saw a telephone wire connecting the house with the main
  lines.</p>

  <p>'I want to telephone to Guildford&mdash;' he began.</p>

  <p>The landlord shook his head.</p>

  <p>'The 'phone is out of order,' he said. 'At least, it was a minute or two
  ago when I tried to get a call through to Esher.'</p>

  <p>Fallowill's heart sank.</p>

  <p>'Where is the nearest?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'There isn't one within six miles,' said the landlord. 'What is the
  matter?'</p>

  <p>'My car has broken down, and it is absolutely necessary that I should be
  in Southampton in two hours,' said Fallowill.</p>

  <p>He was desperate, but he must risk giving a clue to the police that would
  lead them eventually to Southampton. Then, to his relief:</p>

  <p>'I have an old flivver here that'll run you into Guildford. You will be
  able to hire a car from there,' said the landlord, and Fallowill could have
  fallen on his neck. At Guildford the relief car was waiting, thanks to his
  foresight.</p>

  <p>He followed his host out into the yard, where a dilapidated machine stood
  underneath a shed, and together they pushed the car into the stable yard,
  whilst a hastily summoned youth struggled into his coat.</p>

  <p>'Take this gentleman to Guildford. Where did you leave your machine,
  sir?'</p>

  <p>'At the bottom of the hill.'</p>

  <p>'I'll have it brought up,' said the landlord. 'You can call for it on your
  way back.'</p>

  <p>The youth dropped into the driver's seat and Fallowill followed.</p>

  <p>'I can't get her to start!' said the surprised chauffeur a few minutes
  later.</p>

  <p>Neither self-starter nor handle had the slightest effect, and after a
  quarter of an hour Fallowill, white-faced and shaken, stepped to the
  ground.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">MANY strange things happened that day. The streets and roads
  of England were littered with useless motor-cars. Every electric train, above
  and below ground, had come to a standstill, and from the black tunnels of
  darkened tube stations poured processions of frightened passengers.</p>

  <p>Johnny Brest drove his steam car along Whitehall. The sight was amazing.
  Motor-cars, motor-buses, great lorries, tiny motor-cycles, stood derelict,
  and the pavements were crowded with their passengers.</p>

  <p>Nowhere was there a telephone or telegraph working, he learnt from the
  technical expert, who, with the police chiefs, had been summoned to a
  conference at the Home Office.</p>

  <p>And then Johnny saw on his chief's table a big magnet, and wondered who
  had brought it there.</p>

  <p>'Look at this!' said the chief, and, picking up the magnet, held it
  against a little desk-knife.</p>

  <p>'What is the matter?' asked Johnny in perplexity. 'It doesn't seem to be
  attracting the steel.'</p>

  <p>'It has lost its properties, for some extraordinary reason,' said the
  chief. 'That is why the streets are filled with standing cars. Every piece of
  metal in the world has become demagnetized!'</p>

  <p>For a long time the young man could not grasp the significance of this
  simple statement.</p>

  <p>'We have had electric storms before,' said the technical expert. 'Storms
  which, for some reason or other, have disorganised telegraphic communication.
  But this is something worse. Electricity, as created and applied by man for
  his service, has ceased to exist. Communication throughout the country has
  practically stopped.'</p>

  <p>'But the railways are working.'</p>

  <p>The other smiled.</p>

  <p>'They are certainly working,' he said drily. 'Trains are being flagged
  from station to station, and since the telegraph service is out of order,
  trains will be restricted to two or three a day on the main lines until we
  can organise some method of signalling by semaphore. There isn't an aeroplane
  in the sky&mdash;the London-Paris service went out of action at ten- forty-
  five, and we can only hope that the London-Paris machines got down without
  mishap&mdash;there is no means of knowing.'</p>

  <p>Later, they were to learn that ships were feeling their way into port,
  their compasses having ceased to function. Even the gyroscope compass, which
  depended upon a little electric motor, was valueless under the new and
  strange conditions.</p>

  <p>On the Sunday the Cabinet, which had dispersed for the week- end, reached
  town, the Premier coming down from Yorkshire by a special train, which took
  twenty-six hours to do the journey. The Home Secretary, more fortunately
  placed, came up from Devizes on a steam trolley.</p>

  <p>No newspapers appeared on the Sunday&mdash;everybody depended upon
  electric current for its motive power, and the great power works were out of
  action. Only the streets which were lit by gas had any illumination. On the
  Monday morning a steam-driven press issued the momentous tidings.</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">The scientists have discovered that an extraordinary
  revolution is taking place in the sun. The sodium lines have disappeared from
  the spectrum, and it is an astonishing fact that, for some reason which
  cannot be understood by 	the cleverest brains in the world, sodium has been
  absorbed by some other element, the sun's spectrum revealing amazing chemical
  changes in the sun's composition. A limited mail service will be carried on
  by steam tractors, and the Minister of Transport is mobilising all the horses
  in the country to augment the main railroads, and every effort is being made
  to secure the food supply. The country must, however, reconcile itself to the
  possibility that what we know and call electricity, as applied to the service
  of mankind, may never return to use during the lifetime of the present
  generation. Fortunately, very few of our collieries are equipped for electric
  hauling, and all, with the exception of a dozen, are working at full speed to
  cope with the increased demands of the gas plants.</p><br>

  <p>On the Monday, when the Stock Exchange was opened, scenes of the wildest
  excitement were witnessed. The oil market suffered the most extraordinary
  collapse in its history, despite the warnings which were displayed, that all
  heavy locomotion was practically unaffected by the sun's eccentricity. Rail
  shares jumped on the rumour that a new method of light signalling had been
  successfully adopted on the Western region. But the most sensational advance
  of all was in the gas market. Here stocks soared to undreamt-of prices.</p>

  <p>It was humanly impossible to learn what was happening in other parts of
  the globe. Cable and radio communication were suspended.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">PROFESSOR DORFORD was a beggar. Before him stretched such a
  vista as would have reduced an ordinary man to despair, but in the new world
  problem his own personal misfortune was so insignificant that it was lost to
  sight.</p>

  <p>On the fourth night of the solar disaster, Johnny Brest called to give the
  latest news.</p>

  <p>'Fallowill is still in the country,' he said. 'A car was stranded on the
  Portsmouth Road, near the Red Lion, on the day the juice went west, and the
  landlord identified the man&mdash;luckily, I stopped at the inn to get water
  for my magnificent machine&mdash;I was offered a thousand pounds for it
  to-day, by the way.'</p>

  <p>'You think he will be found?' asked the girl quickly.</p>

  <p>'Certain&mdash;he is hiding in the neighbourhood of Guildford. I suppose
  it will make a big difference to the Professor if the money cannot be
  recovered?'</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>'At present he is so absorbed in that wretched sodium that he doesn't
  realise that he is ruined,' she said. 'Listen!'</p>

  <p>From the study came the sound of a booming voice.</p>

  <p>`Sir Roland Field,' she said. He came&mdash;don't laugh, Johnny&mdash;by
  steam-roller! There are no trains from Cambridge.'</p>

  <p>'There is no doubt,' Professor Dorford was saying at that moment with some
  satisfaction, 'that the only places unaffected by this solar disturbance are
  the wild villages of Africa.'</p>

  <p>'But why sodium?' boomed Sir Roland.</p>

  <p>He was an irascible old man, who regarded this phenomenon of nature as a
  direct affront to himself.</p>

  <p>'Why sodium, my good friend? If the iron had gone from the sun, or the
  magnesium, or any other infernal element, I could understand, but why sodium?
  What the devil has sodium got to do with electrical energy?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' admitted Dorford.</p>

  <p>'Of course you don't know!' roared the old gentleman. 'It's an absurdity!
  There isn't a scientist in the world who will not tell you that it is an
  absurdity! Now, if it were iron or nickel...'</p>

  <p>'Is it not possible,' interrupted Professor Dorford, 'that the
  disappearance of sodium brought about through, let us say, such a chemical
  conversion as we see every day in our laboratories, may have&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'No, sir, it isn't possible!' bellowed Sir Roland.</p>

  <p>Johnny listened and grinned. He was a busy man. His steam car was one of
  the most popular means of locomotion in the country. Attached by his chief to
  the Intelligence Department of the War Office&mdash;for the troops were under
  arms everywhere, guarding the food markets, and augmenting the police, on
  whom the darkened towns of England threw an additional burden&mdash;he had
  little leisure.</p>

  <p>The next day he was on his way to Winchester with despatches to the
  officer commanding the troops. It was a glorious afternoon, and, peering up
  at the unclouded brilliance of the sun, he found it hard to believe that that
  bright friend of the world had played so low a trick upon humanity.</p>

  <p>Eight miles from Winchester he saw the gleam of a little river on his
  right and a huddle of squat factory buildings, and wondered who had laid down
  an industrial plant in the heart of the smiling countryside. And then he saw
  a figure walking in the shade of a hedge. It might have been a tramp, so
  dusty and begrimed was Mr Fallowill, for the fear of detection had kept him
  to the woods and the hedges.</p>

  <p>As he had realised the immense advantages which the failure of the
  telegraph and mechanical propulsion gave to him, he had grown bolder. No
  message could warn the police of the towns through which he passed, no swift
  cars could overtake him. His wife, he guessed, was on the seas and safe; he
  himself was sufficiently ingenious to devise methods of escape. He touched
  the pad of crisp papers in his breast pocket and smiled.</p>

  <p>And then he heard the soft purr of the steam car and whipped round. As
  Johnny jumped to the ground, the man turned and, leaping a hedge, ran across
  the fields toward the little river.</p>

  <p>Instantly John Brest was in pursuit. He was younger, more athletic, but
  the man out-distanced him rapidly. Fallowill reached the river's edge and
  looked round for some method of crossing. He could not swim, and there was no
  boat. Hesitating, he looked around. A few hundred yards along the river was
  some sort of factory building, and, crossing the stream a little way down,
  was a thick cable supported on either bank by iron trestles.</p>

  <p>Darting along the tow-path he gained the first support, climbed, and,
  catching the cable, went hand over hand across the river.</p>

  <p>By the time the pursuer reached the trestle, Fallowill was across. Johnny
  watched him; saw him reach out his hand to grip the second trestle.</p>

  <p>There was no scream, no sound, only a flicker of white light, and
  Fallowill dropped to the ground a bundle of smoking clothes.</p>

  <p>When John Brest, swimming the stream, came up to him, he was dead, and the
  packet of notes in his pocket was singed brown. For he had crossed by a power
  cable at the very moment that scientists the world over saw the sodium lines
  come back to the spectrum of the sun.</p>
