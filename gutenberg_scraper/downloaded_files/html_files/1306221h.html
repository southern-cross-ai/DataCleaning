  <br>

  <p class="first">I DREAMED I was walking on the parapet of heaven. The
  parapet of heaven was rather like the &ldquo;parade&rdquo; of a small seaside
  town.</p>

  <p>There were a wall, a strip of pavement, and a road running parallel.
  Leaning over the wall and looking down into a void in which, through mists
  and dimly, one saw a pale green world turning, were a number of old saints.
  Their robes were rather grimy and ragged, and generally they bore a happy but
  neglected appearance. With their elbows on the parapet they gazed
  abstractedly at the world below, and they were smoking short clay pipes; from
  the rank aroma that came to my nostrils I guessed they were smoking shag.</p>

  <p>Presently I saw another and older saint come shuffling in his sandaled
  feet across the roadway; under one arm he held an immense mortar and in his
  hand he carried a large porcelain pestle&hellip;. Depositing the mortar
  between his feet, he took from his robes a large blue diamond that sparkled
  dazzlingly in the sunlight.</p>

  <p>This he put at the bottom of his mortar. and hammered at the diamond until
  it was crushed into small pieces&hellip;.</p>

  <p>When he had finished, each of the old saints took a handful of the powder
  and threw it into space, and leaning over I saw the dust of it, like an
  iridescent cloud, sinking out of sight. And as I looked, the world came
  nearer, and I saw the dust settling on the face of it. And I saw human men
  searching, as distinctly as though I were standing by their side. Presently
  one human found a speck, and his frenzied shouts brought hundreds and
  thousands of other humans to him, and they put the speck of dust in a large
  golden box and they built a church around it.</p>

  <p>And in another part of the earth another speck was found, and those who
  discovered it erected a university in honor of its discovery. Where a third
  speck was found by a searcher a hospital was erected, and a new science grew
  into being. And this thing went on day after day, and year after year, it
  seemed, for time had no dimension, and as I looked, centuries passed in a
  flash.</p>

  <p>But every time a speck was discovered and a church or a synagogue was
  built about it, the old saints roared with laughter until the tears rolled
  down their lined faces.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is the joke?&rdquo; I asked one of the saintly men, and as he
  dried his eyes he explained.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You saw yon diamond old Harry was grinding? Well, that is THE
  TRUTH. You saw him grind it up into fine dust?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw that,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but what is the
  joke?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The joke!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was convulsed with laughter and could not speak for a long time, and
  then he said:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is the joke&mdash;every man on earth who finds a speck thinks
  has the whole!&rdquo;</p>
