<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<hr class="tenth">
<p><span class="aa">Mr. Henry Ling Roth</span>, the translator
and editor of this work, has brought before the public the
complete narrative of an event which, at the period of its
occurrence, attracted great attention throughout the civilized
world. It is therefore the more surprising that, amid the
numerous collections of Voyages and Travels published during the
last century, this Voyage to the South Seas, full of interest as
it is, has not received the full attention of the English
translator until now. The discovery of a practically new
hemisphere in the Southern Seas, and the progress of settlement
there having been the theme of a long series of histories in the
several languages of Europe, it is unnecessary to tread in so
beaten a track by the recital of occurrences of which few can be
ignorant; but at the same time no account of Australasian
exploration would be complete without a general reference to the
great work performed prior to the discoveries of the French, with
which this work deals.</p>
<p>In the year 1642 an expedition was fitted out by the
Governor-General of the Netherlands-India, Antony van Diemen, for
the purpose of exploring the Coast of the Australian Continent,
which had been sighted by previous adventurers, the command being
entrusted to Abel Jansen Tasman. Entering the Pacific from the
Indian Ocean, Tasman's energy was rewarded first of all by the
discovery of land which, as-the Navigator's Journal states, "had
not before been known to any European, and was named Van Diemen's
Land in honour of the Governor-General who sent us out to make
discoveries." Tasman followed up this important discovery by
sighting the coast of a mountainous country, which he named
Staaten Land, in honour of the States-General of Holland, this
being more than a century later named New Zealand by Captain
Cook. It is generally acknowledged that after Tasman's there is
no record of any other vessel visiting this part of the Southern
Seas until the arrival of Captain Cook, who in 1769, after
observing the transit of Venus at Otaheite, first sighted the
Coast of New Zealand. Cook's explorations of that country far
surpassed those of his predecessor Tasman; for whereas Cook took
every advantage of coming into contact with the natives and
gaining information with regard to the country, it is an admitted
fact that Tasman never landed on the shores of New Zealand at
all, contenting himself with sailing arid anchoring off the
coast. Cook's visit was undoubtedly the most important that has
ever been made to New Zealand, if only the geography of the
country is taken into consideration; and all other extracts from
the accounts of explorers who followed up to the time of the
settlement and formation of a European Government have added but
little to the geographical information for which he is
responsible. In fact, Cook himself states in the account of his
first voyage, that the situation of few parts of the world is
better ascertained than that of at least a portion of the coasts
of New Zealand investigated by him &gt; and in connection with
the voyage treated of in this work, this statement, is confirmed
by the testimony of Crozet, Marion's lieutenant, who says: "As
soon as I obtained information of the Voyage of Cook, I carefully
compared the chart I had prepared of that part of the coast of
New Zealand along which we had coasted with that prepared by
Captain Cook and his officers. I found it of an exactitude and of
a thoroughness of detail which astonished me beyond all power of
expression. I think therefore that I cannot do better than to lay
down our track off New Zealand on the chart prepared by the
celebrated English navigator."</p>
<p>Following closely in the wake of Captain Cook, and, in fact,
having intercourse with the natives at the same time as the
English expedition, was Captain de Surville, in command of the
French vessel, <i>St. Jean Baptiste</i>, This explorer had been
despatched from France on a secret expedition, which fitted out
at great expense, and from which extraordinary results were
anticipated. De Surville was, however, singularly unfortunate,
and added little intelligence to the information then available
with regard to the exploration of the great Southern Lands.</p>
<p>Having so far traced the course of discovery to the period of
the visit of M. Marion du Fresne, the account of which, together
with the report of Cook's Voyage, was the means of turning the
attention of Europeans to the importance of those lands, which at
the present time form one of the brightest portions of the
British Empire, it may be well to refer to the issue of the work
dealing with the results of Marion's Voyage. The first account of
the expedition was published in Paris in 1783, under the title of
"A New Voyage to the South Seas, commenced under the Orders of M.
Marion." The work was compiled and edited from the papers of M.
Crozet by the Abbé Rochon, himself a distinguished traveller, and
appeared under the privilege of the French Academy, the entry of
the book in the Academy's Register having been made on the 11th
May, 1782. Some doubts appear to exist, however, as to whether or
not a second, or even a third, edition was subsequently issued.
Opinions upon the subject are varied, which fact renders it
difficult to arrive at a definite conclusion. Whilst it is upheld
by most eminent students of Australasian Bibliography, both in
England and France, that only one edition of the work has been
published, viz. that of 1783, it is strange that in Professor
Craik's work, entitled "The New Zealanders," forming one of the
series of the Library of Entertaining Knowledge, and published in
1830, it is stated that in addition to the first edition, there
appeared in 1791 a volume containing an account of the Abbé
Rochon's own voyage to Madagascar and the East Indies, which was
reprinted in 1802, with the addition of two other volumes, in the
last of which appears a second narrative of the voyage of Marion,
in most respects copied from the former, but with a few new
remarks interspersed. Dr. Thomson, the author of "The Story of
New Zealand," published in 1859, in a bibliography relating to
that country, which forms an appendix to the work, refers to
three editions as having been issued. After comparing these
statements and inspecting the Abbé Rochon's work, there appears
be be no confirmation of the fact that the original edition was
ever reprinted&mdash;although extracts have in many instances
been embodied in various collections of voyages. It may be that
the authors of the two works above referred to have been misled
by the publication of the Abbé Rochon's works in 1791 and 1802,
which contained the results of his own voyages.</p>
<p>The Voyage of Marion de Fresne, or Crozet's Voyage, as it is
otherwise known, was performed during the year 1771, and is a
modest account of the exploration of a party of Frenchmen which
went in search of the great land which, in those days, was
supposed to exist somewhere in the Southern Ocean, It embraces an
account of the discoveries made in Van Diemen's Land and New
Zealand, the various troubles the party met with, the massacre of
part of the expedition, including the Commander, by the Maories,
the sojourn at the Ladrone Islands, and the final arrival at the
Philippines, all of which incidents are graphically described. If
the book at the present day can hardly lay claim to a scientific
character from a geographical point of view, it can confidently
be recommended as one of surpassing interest.</p>
<p>In the translation the spirit of the French text has been
strictly adhered to, and the explanations added by Mr. Ling Roth
greatly enhance the value of the work. The results of the
expedition affecting two important portions of the British Empire
cannot fail to be of interest not only to every British subject,
but more especially to the historical student. The former may
care to learn something of the history of discovery in the
Southern Seas, whilst the latter will, doubtless, find a deep
attraction in tracing the origin of the formation of Colonies
which, a century ago, kept alive a spirit of rivalry amongst the
representatives of the British and of the French Nations.</p>

"The gentleman had an opportunity of seeing the operation of
<i>amoco</i>, or tattooing, performed upon the face of a young
man of Tekokee's tribe. He lay upon his back, with his head
resting upon the knees of the operator, who sat upon the ground,
and for whose guidance the intended form of the amoco had been
previously traced in black lines upon the patient's face. The
point of the tattooing chisel was about half a quarter of an inch
wide; it was made of the wing-bone of an albatross, and fastened
in a transverse wooden handle. Before, each incision, the
instrument was dipped in a calabash of charcoal and water, and
then laid on the part and lightly struck with a bit of stick not
larger than a common pencil. As the lines of the <i>amoco</i>
became more contracted, a narrower instrument was used. Though
the blood gushed out at every puncture, the patient bore the
operation with perfect composure, and whatever the pain might
have been at the time, the inflammation that followed and
continued for many days was quite frightful.". (Major R. A.
Cruise, Journal, p. 136.) Owing to the inflammation of his face,
the patient is unable to chew his food, and hence the necessity
of feeding him on liquid food.<br>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<hr class="tenth">
<p><span class="aa">The</span> origin of the expedition described
in this work was due to the desire on the part of the French
Government to return to his native land a Taïtian, named
<i>Aoutourou</i> (<i>Mayoa</i>), whom Bougainville had brought
with him to Europe as a human curiosity in 1769. This South Sea
Islander had been sent to the Mauritius together with
instructions to the Governor of that French dependency to forward
him to his destination. Marion du Fresne, the chief of the
expedition about to be described, was then a well-to-do resident
at the Ile de France, and he volunteered, as is related, to take
<i>Aoutourou</i> to his home.</p>
<p>Nicholas Thomas Marion du Fresne was born at Saint Malo in
1729. His family is at the present day represented by the
Boismena family at Saint Malo, and there is supposed to be a
branch, name unknown, in Nantes. The following extract from the
registers of the Etat Civil de Saint Malo, obtained through the
kindness of the British Vice-Consul the Hon. E. Henniker Major,
relating to his baptism is interesting:</p>
<p>"Nicholas Thomas Marion, son of Nicholas and of Jaquette
Pilvesse his wife, was baptised by me, the undersigned, on the
twenty-second of December, 1729. Jacques Poitevin was godfather,
and Catherine Mathays was godmother. The godfather and father
have signed:</p>
<p align="right" style="margin-right:1cm;"><span class=
"uu">Jacques Poitevin,<br>
Nicholas Marion</span>,<br>
(Signed) <span class="uu">F. Pain</span>, <i>Baptisavi.</i>"</p>
<p>Marion entered the French navy, became a lieutenant on a
frigate in 1746, and a captain of a fire-ship in 1766. He was
also made a Knight of the order of Saint Louis. Previously he had
commanded the vessel which took the celebrated astronomer, A. G.
Pingré (1711-1796) to Rodriguez island in 1760 to observe the
transit of Venus there. Captain Marion was known as "an extremely
intelligent man, a good strategist, a good all-round man, and one
in whom implicit confidence could be placed." It was natural that
a wealthy man with such renown would have his offer graciously
received by the Governor of the Mauritius. At the time the
expedition was about to start the astronomer and traveller Alexis
Marie de Rochon was on a visit to the island. He had gone there
with Kerguelen to take part in the latter's second voyage, but
not agreeing with his views, he declined to go further. The
Governor of the island, M. Poivre, at first wished Rochon under
the circumstances to go with M. Marion, but afterwards, in hopes
of reconciling Captain Kerguelen and the Abbé Rochon, he
positively refused the latter his permission to start with M.
Marion. It is probable that to this circumstance we are indebted
for the published account of the expedition, for Rochon edited it
from the log of M. Crozet, one of the officers, who took charge
of the <i>Mascarin</i> on the death of Marion, and who met with
well-deserved promotion on his return to France. Associated with
Marion was an officer known as the Chevalier Duclesmeur. This man
distinguished himself on his return to Europe in the squadron
under the command of Touche-Tréville.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Vice-Admiral Touche-Tréville, born
1745, died on board the <i>Bucentaure</i> 19 August, 1804. He
commanded the <i>Hermione</i> in her successful withstanding of
the English frigate <i>Isis</i> in 1780; he was taken prisoner by
Commodore Elphinstone at the mouth of the Chesapeake in 1782, and
taken to England. He returned to France in 1783, and again
commanded vessels successfully against the English.]</p>
<p>It was Captain Duclesmeur who assumed command of the whole
expedition on the death of M. Marion. He was also, it appears,
wounded by the natives of Tasmania, and the way in which he
successfully withdrew the expedition from its dangerous position
at the Bay of Islands is greatly to his credit. The great object
of the expedition, apart from that of returning the wandering
Taïtian, was the discovery of lands in the Antarctic Ocean, but
this object appears to have been brought to a sudden end by the
unfortunate collision between the two vessels which formed the
expedition. The <i>Castries</i>, which appears to have suffered
most, although she afterwards occasionally outsailed her consort,
has been blamed for being the cause of this change of view, but
M. Rochon asserts that Marion must have had other ideas not known
to us for so completely changing his original object.</p>
<p>In the appendix will be found M. Rochon's views of the
massacre which cost Captain Marion his life, and which he
attributes to hostile acts committed by the vessel commanded by
M. de Surville. He adds: "The desertion of a negro belonging to
Marion might have contributed to the rising of the islanders,
already shocked by the flogging inflicted on one of their
companions; for although it is said that the savage who had
stolen a sword out of the gun room went without punishment,
Duclesmeur states the savage was put in irons and that his
companions swam off" threatening to wreak vengeance on Marion."
Either cause may in itself have been sufficient to rouse the
natives, or we may not be wrong in inferring that a severe breach
of the "tabu" must have been the origin of the mischief, for
these early voyagers appear to have known nothing whatever of
that remarkable custom in New Zealand or elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the account of his second voyage Captain Cook says the
account of M. Marion's expedition had not been made public in
1776, and "did not come to my knowledge in time enough to afford
me any advantage." He had been told at the Cape by Baron
Plattenberg, the Governor, in November, 1772, that Captain Marion
had started, but that was all. On his return from his second
voyage, March, 1775, he met Captain Crozet at the Cape and says
of him: "He seemed to be a man possessed of the true spirit of
discovery, and to have abilities. In a very obliging manner he
communicated to me a chart, wherein were delineated not only his
own discoveries, but also those of Captain Kerguelen. . . . .
Besides this land . . . . Captain Marion . . . . discovered six
islands which were high and barren. These, together with some
islands lying between the line and the southern tropic in the
Pacific Ocean, were the principal discoveries made in this
voyage, the account of which we were told was ready for
publication."</p>
<p>In this translation of Rochon's work there are many references
to geology, botany, and zoology, which at the present day it is
quite hopeless to attempt to describe correctly, and the editor
is therefore all the more indebted to Mr. F. W. Rudler of the
Royal School of Mines, to Mr. W. Botting Hemsley of Kew, and Mr.
W. Eagle Clarke of Edinburgh, for kind help in the translation of
respective technical details.</p>
<p>Of the two maps specially draughted for this translation, one,
showing the general route of the expedition, has been prepared
from Crozet's log, under the kind superintendence of M. J.
Renaud, Hydrographer-in-Chief to the French Admiralty; the second
one, showing the movements of the expedition in the Bay of
Islands, where Marion was killed, the editor has prepared from
Crozet's two charts in the Naval Archives at Paris.</p>
<p>In the selection of the Illustrations the editor is much
indebted to Mr. Walter Clark, who has kindly placed at his
disposal negatives of the plates of the articles illustrated from
the Science and Art Museum, Edinburgh, and more especially to Mr.
Ch. H. Read, of the British Museum, who has enabled him to lay
before the reader a few illustrations of some of the choicest
works of Maori Art.</p>

<h3>CROZET'S VOYAGE.</h3>
<hr class="tenth">
<p><span class="aa">In</span> the course of his voyage round the
World in 1768 and 1769, M. De Bougainville had brought to France
a native of Taïty, an island in the South Seas. This Indian was
the object of much interest in Paris on account of his frankness
and of his excellent natural qualities. The Government sent him
to the Isle of France with orders to the Administrators there to
take measures to secure his return to his native country.</p>
<p>M. Marion du Fresne, the Master of a
Fireship,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> and a smart sea-officer, seized
the opportunity to distinguish himself by making a new voyage and
by making discoveries in little-known seas. He offered to carry
the Indian to his native country at his own cost. He asked for
one of the King's storeships to be attached to his own vessel,
offering to pay all the expenses of the expedition himself.</p>
<div class="foot">[<b>1</b> As a fireship is almost a thing of
the past, and therefore almost unknown to the present generation,
a short description of this class of vessel, kindly given me by
Mr. R. C. Leslie, author of "Sea Wings," etc., will be of
interest to the reader: "The fireship was certainly a distinct
class of vessel in our navy as far back as 1684, and from Marion
being spoken of as <i>lieutenant de brûlot</i>, there can be no
doubt that the French (who in most things connected with the
material of their navy were ahead of us) also had a class of
vessel in their navy specially rated and fitted up as
'Fireships.' From a draught of one I have by me, these fireships
were from 90 to 100 feet long, by 14 feet in beam, with a draught
of 10 feet, and they must have been from 200 to 300 tons. They
were armed with 20 guns upon a 'spar' or uncovered upper deck
like a corvette, while the main deck, or that which answered to a
frigate's main deck, had eight ports on either side, besides one
upon each quarter aft, much larger, and called the sally port,
having two large upright doors opening outward. This large port
was used as a means of escape by those of her officers and crew
in their boat who remained on board until the last moment to sail
her among the enemies' ships, and then to light the slow matches
connected with powder trains, etc., by which the ship was set in
a blaze, and ultimately blew up, scattering the combustibles,
fireballs, and langrel shot, with which she was freighted, among
the enemies' ships, which were mostly attacked in this way when
anchored at night in an open roadstead. One very marked feature
in the construction of these fireships was that the eight
main-deck ports on each side were <i>let down</i> in place of
opening upwards like an ordinary gunport, so that when open the
port lid (Fig. 1) helped to conduct the flames, etc., in an
<i>upward</i> direction, instead of towards the sea, as they
would have done if hinged from above, like the ordinary gunport
(Fig. 2). Fireships were also provided with what werecalled
fire-trunks or wooden funnels placed under the shrouds to carry
up the flames to the masts and</div>

"Fig01-2"></a><img alt="" src="1306431h-images/Fig01-2.jpg"></div>
<div class="foot">rigging. No doubt the command of these vessels
was given to the smartest and most intrepid among the younger
officers of those days, just as to-day the command of a fast
torpedo boat would be, if sent upon a night attack upon a fleet
of large ironclads."]</div>
<br>
<div class="insertr"><a name="Fig03" id="Fig03"></a><img alt=""
src="1306431h-images/Fig03.jpg"></div>
<div>The Administrators <sup><b>[2]</b></sup> of the Isle of
France advanced him the necessary sums for the armament of these
two vessels, and M. Marion gave surety for the payment of these
loans. Although by this arrangement the whole expedition came
under the control of M. Marion, the Governor of the Colony gave
him the fullest instructions concerning the lands he was to go in
search of and on the physical and moral observations he was to
make in the course of his voyage. It was proposed he should
advance sufficiently to the south in order to try and discover
the islands, or the continent, which it was supposed were to be
found in this southern portion of our globe, the Governor of the
Isles of France and Bourbon being particularly anxious that the
most northerly portions of this supposed land should be
discovered, as they would be nearer to the colonies and under a
more temperate climate than the more southern portions. He hoped
they would find timber for masts, and a variety of necessaries
which the Isle of France, so far distant from any chief seaport,
could only obtain at the expense of great trouble and cost. The
Governor pointed out to M. Marion that during the season which
commences in November and ends in April it was impossible for the
ships of the Isle of France to be employed usefully; that they
had to be laid up in port, where they were not even safe from
storms, and that they remained there at an expense to the colony;
that this stormy season at the Isle of France was the most
favourable for starting and exploring the southern lands, and
that great advantage would accrue to the Isles of France and
Bourbon from the discovery of these lands. M. Marion thoroughly
understood the soundness of these views and desired most eagerly
to acquire glory in making discoveries which he foresaw might
give a new career to the colony in which he owned property.</div>
<br>
<div class="foot">[<b>2</b> The Governor of the Isle of France
was then Pierre Poivre, 1719-1786. He was a great traveller, and
established the first French Agency in Cochin China. During his
travels he was three times taken prisoner by the English, and on
the decline of the Compagnie des Indes he retired into private
life. From this retirement he was called away to govern the
Mauritius, which post he appears to have fulfilled with the
greatest benefit to the island, personally leaving the island as
poor as he entered it. It was probably to his initiative that
Marion's expedition was so anxious to collect new industrial
plants for the Isle of France.]</div>
<p>The Court of France had just sent M. de Kerguelen
<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> to the Isle of France with permission to
visit this part of the world, and if possible to complete by his
discoveries a knowledge of the earth in all its inhabited or
habitable parts. It was important in order to carry out the views
of the Court on this point to interest M. Marion in them, for he
was leaving at a time of the year apparently more favourable than
that in which M. de Kerguelen could depart, and who was moreover
to attempt his discoveries by quite a different route.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Kerguelen-Tremarec, 1734-1796. He was
sent on two Arctic and two Antarctic expeditions, and in the
course of the first of the latter discovered Kerguelen land. This
land Cook afterwards re-discovered and was inclined to call it
Desolation Island. Kerguelen was also sent by Louis XV. on a
mission to England to report on naval construction. On his return
from his second expedition he was charged with various
indiscretions and imprisoned at Saumur. He left the Isle of
France on 16th January, 1772, and on 18th October, 1773,
respectively on his two Antarctic expeditions.]</p>
<p>In consequence of these arrangements, M. Marion chose the most
experienced officers in the Colony, and he engaged me as one of
them to ship as his second in command.</p>
<p>The native of Taïty, named <i>Mayoa</i>, embarked with M.
Marion on the 18th October, 1771. The two vessels, namely the
<i>Mascarin</i> commanded by M. Marion, and the <i>Marquis de
Castries</i> commanded by the Chevalier Duclesmeur, first of all
put into port at the Isle of Bourbon. The Indian was there
attacked by small-pox, of which he had probably taken the germs
with him from the Isle of France, where this epidemic was making
cruel ravages at the time of the departure of the vessels.</p>
<p>For fear of introducing into the island a disease which is
looked upon as almost as dangerous as the plague, M. Marion was
obliged to depart from the Isle of Bourbon, and anchored in the
Bay of Fort Dauphin in Madagascar, in order to let the disease
run its course, and so as not to carry it with him to the Cape of
Good Hope, where he was obliged to go in order to complete his
outfit. However, on the morning of our anchoring in the Bay of
Port Dauphin, the Taïtian died, and an affidavit recording his
death was made.</p>
<p>The chief object of the expedition having thus become void by
the death of the Indian whom we were to carry back to his native
country, it would perhaps have been more proper under the
circumstances to have taken the vessels back to the Isle of
France, and there to have paid them off for employment in some
other object. But M. Marion's desire to make useful discoveries,
and to distinguish himself by a new voyage, overbore all other
considerations.</p>
<p>We therefore started for the Cape of Good Hope, where in a few
days we completed the provisioning of the two ships for an
eighteen months' cruise. This being accomplished, we set sail
from the roadstead on the 28th of December, 1771, and at eleven
o'clock in the morning M. Marion directed his course towards the
South in order to discover the Southern Lands.</p>
<p>This search had already occupied M. Losier-Bouvet, who in 1737
saw a Cape which he named <i>Cape Circumcision</i>. But the land
discovered by this able navigator was apparently not the same
where Captain Gonneville had touched in
1503.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The route followed by M. Bouvet
indicated to M. Marion that he must look for these lands to the
east of the meridian, which passes through Madagascar.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Binot Paulmier de Gonneville, a French
navigator, who discovered some land never properly charted, and
which was by the way also for a long time supposed to be a
portion of Madagascar. He departed from Honfleur in 1503,
returning with an Indian Chiefs son named Essomeric. On his
return he was captured by an English Corsair, and did not get
back to France till 1505. His crew declined to return to the
Indian's country with the chiefs son, and it was a descendant of
this Essomeric who in 1663 published in Paris an account of
Gonneville's voyage. M. Margry lately made the discovery that the
land visited by Gonneville was on the coast of Brazil. Bouvet de
Losier, who was sent in command of the frigates <i>Aigle</i> and
<i>La Marie</i> to search for Gonneville's land, discovered
Bouvet Island (S. lat. 54° 50', and E. long. Paris 4°) on 1st
January, 1739 (not 1737). Captain Lindsay in the Swan saw the
island in 1808, and Captain Norris of the <i>Sprightly</i> was
the first to land there (16th December, 1825). The latter named
it Liverpool Island, but which name it has of course not
retained.]</p>
<p>Nothing remarkable happened from our departure from the Cape
of Good Hope until the 7th January, 1772, when our latitude
observations showed us that we were in the parallel of the
islands <i>Dina</i> and <i>Marzeven</i>, These islands are marked
on the charts of Van Ceulen <sup><b>[2]</b></sup> in lat. 40 to
41, and I do not know why our modern hydrographers do not mention
them, for they should not ignore that several Dutch vessels knew
them thoroughly, and I have even been assured that these islands
are well wooded and watered.<sup><b>[3]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Jean Van Keulen and afterwards Gerard
Van Keulen were Dutch hydrographers, who were chiefly known by
their excellent marine charts.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>3</b> With regard to these two islands, which
only appear on Keulen's chart and have since not been heard of,
it seems strange that so late as 1820 an English captain should
have tried to make them. See p. 18, Goodridge's Narrative of a
Voyage to the South Seas, London, 1832. It is, however, not at
all improbable that these islands are identical with the Marion
Group.]</p>
<p>Our longitude by reckoning was, on the 7th of January, 20° 43'
east of Paris. Next morning we saw a large number of gulls, and
the sight of these birds showed us we were not far from the
islands we have just mentioned. The sea had changed much: it was
rough now with a violent wind. We left these parts on the morning
of the 9th January, considering that the search for the Southern
continent should alone occupy our attention. On the 11th I took a
latitude observation, 45° 46'; the reckoning for the longitude
was 28° 46' east of Paris. Although in the Southern Hemisphere
the month of January corresponds to the month of July in the
Northern Hemisphere, yet we experienced the severest cold in the
height of summer and in a climate which appeared to be placed in
the temperate zone. As snow fell almost the whole time we were in
these parts, we could not attribute the cold we suffered to any
sudden change of weather.</p>
<p>On the 12th January we saw some <i>poules
mauves</i>,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> gulls,
sea-wolves,<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> and sea-weed. At six o'clock in
the evening M. Marion sounded and at 130 fathoms there was no
bottom. At eight o'clock in the evening we clewed the mainsail
and continued during the night under the two maintop-sails and
the fore-sails. The sea was fairly fine and the weather was
foggy. I noticed that at sundown the gulls and other birds flew
towards the east and east-south-east, a fact which announced
lands in that direction.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Probably a variety of gull.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Probably fur seals.]</p>

<h4><span class="aa">Discovery of Southern Islands.</span></h4>
<p>At six o'clock in the morning of the 13th January we saw,
returning from the west, gulls, <i>poules mauves</i>, and some
other birds, which never fly far from land. We continued our
east-south-east course and saw many sea-wolves and much seaweed,
with which the sea was covered. On sounding we found no bottom at
130 fathoms.</p>
<p>At two o'clock in the afternoon we were surrounded by a fairly
thick mist and we also had some rain. The sea was fine and
smooth, but there was a swell from the west. At four o'clock the
wind freshened. We unreefed the main-sail and the sea once more
changed. At half-past four we sighted land which extended four to
five leagues from west-south-west to west-north-west. As the fog
was thick and we might be mistaken, we sounded and found bottom
at 80 fathoms, with coarse sand mixed with coral. At the same
time we saw also very clearly more land to the north.</p>
<p>Continuing our course and following the bearing of the first
land, the centre of the middle portion of which was to the west
of us, we found we had coasted along it three leagues further
during the night: we had in fact followed its lay until we saw it
behind us. Before seeing it I had noticed that from midnight
until four o'clock in the morning, the sea had been smooth and
calm, as if it were sheltered by land, and was shallow. As soon
as we had sighted this first land, which now remained behind us,
I took bearings and hastened to sketch the view for fear that the
fog would not let us see it for any length of time. We only saw
about six or seven leagues of its side view, but we did not see
it end to the W.N.W. nor to the S.E., so that it is quite
possible this land may extend very far, and may possibly form a
part of a southern continent. The land appeared to rise very
high, covered with mountains doubled and trebled one on top of
the other. Suddenly the fog robbed us of our view. M. Marion
named it <i>Terre d'Espérance</i> (Land of Hope), because its
discovery flattered us with the hope of finding the southern
continent we were in search of. It was too foggy for us to find
out whether the country was covered with vegetation or whether it
was inhabited.</p>
<p>At the sight of these lands to the west and north, and all the
more as we appeared to see land towards the south-east, M. Marion
feared to be caught in a bay, and directed his course to the
north. The wind then rose and the sea became very rough, and
although we tried hard to pass this island to leeward, we were
ultimately forced to pass it to windward. Before the bad weather
set in I had taken bearings, and had drawn a sketch of the
island, the north-western portion of which we had not seen. In
sailing along this island I noticed a cove on its north-eastern
part, in which there appeared to be a large cavern; around this
cave we could see a multitude of large white spots, which in the
distance looked like flocks of sheep. <sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Had
time permitted it, we thought we might have found anchorage
opposite this cove. I believed I saw a waterfall coming down the
mountains. In doubling the island we discovered three islets, of
which two were in a recess formed by the shore, and the third was
at its most northern point. This island appeared barren, and was
about seven or eight leagues in circumference, and without
vegetation, its shore fairly secure and without danger. M. Marion
called it <i>L'île de la Caverne</i> (Cavern Island). These two
southern lands <sup><b>[2]</b></sup> are situated in lat. S. 46°
45', and long. 34° 31' E. of Paris, and half a degree to the east
of the route followed by Bouvet in search of the lands of
Gonneville.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The <i>Challenger</i> noticed these
spots, and found them to be large patches of moss.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> This group of islands is now known as
Marion Islands, and has been described in the <i>Challenger</i>
Reports, Narrative, Vol. I. Part I.]</p>
<p>On the morning of the 14th January we returned to look for the
first Land of Hope, which we had discovered the night before, and
which the mist, together with the wind, had prevented us knowing
better. We approached to within six leagues, and sounded again,
finding bottom at 80 fathoms, with fine sand mixed with detritus
of shells. On approaching the land, I noticed on its north-east
side a cove formed by low and abrupt points. We were not
sufficiently close to be able to ascertain whether this land was
wooded: it was covered with mist, but it appeared very green to
us; the mountains were very high, and the tops were covered with
snow. These mountains are high enough to be visible at sea 12
leagues off. We were about to look for an anchorage in the cove
before us, and to survey this land, when, while preparing to
sound, our two vessels ran foul of each other. The
<i>Castries</i> lost her bowsprit and fore-sails. We lost our
mizen-mast, the taffrail of our poop, our starboard gallery, and
several hen-coops. This accident quite upset our plans, but
luckily the wind had fallen and the sea was now quiet. We sent
three small masts to the <i>Castries</i> with carpenters to rig
them up. The repairs occupied us three days, during which we had
favourable weather, but the wind having then become very violent,
we abandoned our discovery, and continued our voyage along the
46th south parallel.</p>
<p>I cannot help remarking here that the thick and almost
continued fogs which reign in these parts are a very great
hindrance to those in quest of discoveries, and render navigation
extremely dangerous, and considering the state of the
<i>Castries</i>, we dared not venture further
south.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Having seen the mountains of the Land
of Hope covered with snow, it was most probable that a few
degrees further south we would have been surrounded with ice, as
was the case with M. Bouvet.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> See Introduction.]</p>
<p>Since we sighted the first lands, which we were now leaving
behind us, we met incessantly with kelp, gulls, divers, penguins,
and sea wolves. Up to the 24th of January, when we saw some of
the new lands, we had nothing but fog, rain, and excessive cold.
These lands appeared first of all to be two islands and I drew a
sketch of them eight leagues off"; later on they looked like two
capes, and we thought we could see that they were joined by land.
A moment later fog and night deprived us of the view. They are
situated in 46° 5' lat. S. and in long. 42° E. of Paris by dead
reckoning. M. Marion called them the <i>Iles Froids</i> (Cold
Islands).<sup><b>[2]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Now called Hog and Apostles
Islands.]</p>
<p>We made little headway during the night, and keeping together,
and in the same parts, proposed to make a better survey of the
lands in the morning; but on the 23rd we lost sight of them. We
had apparently wandered during the night, the weather being foggy
and rainy, and we found ourselves in one of those currents which
run strongly north and south.</p>
<p>The same day, 23rd January, we changed our course to the east.
The <i>Castries</i>, which followed us, signalled that land was
in sight. It turned out to be a very high island, which appeared
to me to end in a big cape. I took bearings to E.S.E. at a
distance of about ten or twelve leagues.. We tacked about in
order to get near to this land, but when we were about six or
seven leagues off a thick mist came down, and, lasting about
twelve hours, robbed us of the view. M. Marion did what he could
in order to get near the land, but our crews could only work with
difficulty on account of the continual rain and cold, for they
were not sufficiently warmly clad to withstand a climate in which
the summer is much severer than is the winter on the shores of
France. A big iceberg which we saw on that day, at about five
o'clock in the evening, can give one an idea of the cold we
experienced.</p>
<p>At three o'clock in the morning of the 24th we saw again the
same island which we had first discovered the previous day. There
was little wind at the time, the sea was however rough, but it
was less misty. M. Marion ordered us to approach it and
circumnavigate it. I saw the island very distinctly at two
leagues off. It was round and so high that in fine weather it
could be seen 20 leagues off. The summit of the mountains was
covered with snow.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock in the morning we perceived to the S.E.
another island, which appeared to me even higher than the one
along which we were coasting. This island was also round, more
mountainous, but smaller than the first island; we called it
<i>Ile Aride</i> (Barren Island). These two islands lie East and
West of each other at a distance of about nine leagues from cape
to cape. At eleven o'clock M. Marion had a boat lowered and
ordered me into it in order to go and take possession, in the
name of the King, of the larger of the two islands, which is
situated in latitude 46° 30' S. lat., and by reckoning long. 43°
E. of Paris. M. Marion called the island the <i>Prise de
Possession</i>. This was the sixth island which we had discovered
in these southern regions.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>

known as the Crozet Islands, and has likewise been described in
the <i>Challenger</i> Reports.]</p>

<h4><span class="aa">Landing at one of the Austral
Islands.&mdash;Observations taken on this Island.</span></h4>
<p>My first care-on setting foot on shore was to deposit,
according to custom, the bottle, which contained an account of
the act of taking possession, on the top of a pyramid about 50
feet above sea-level and formed of large rocks piled one on top
of the other. The spot where I landed was absolutely stony. I
mounted an eminence from whence I saw snow lying in several
valleys: the land seemed barren and was covered with a very fine
small grass. I found several of those coarse plants which are
called <i>ficoïdes</i>, very much like those which are so common
at the Cape of Good Hope. On returning to the shore, I noticed a
small rush resembling grass and some amaranthus; the rocks were
covered with moss and lichens; the shore was covered with a sort
of rush about a foot high, very similar to that which is found at
the Cape of Good Hope. The sea-weed around the shore was of an
extraordinary size and had very large leaves. I could not find a
single tree or shrub on the island, and I did not remain long
enough to find fresh water, but appearances seemed to indicate
that it could be found in the valleys which I had perceived from
the eminence I had climbed.</p>

Group, enveloped in Mist, seen from H.M.S.</span>
<i>Challenger</i></small></p>
<br>
<p>As this island is continually exposed to the ravages of the
stormy westerly winds which blow throughout the year in these
regions, it does not appear to be habitable. I only found
sea-wolves, penguins, petrels, <i>envergues</i>, cormorants,
divers, and every variety of aquatic bird which navigators meet
with in the open sea when they double the Cape of Good Hope.
These animals, which had never seen men before, were quiet and
allowed themselves to be captured by hand. The female birds
quietly hatched their eggs, others fed their little ones, and the
sea-wolves continued their bounds and their games without seeming
the least scared by our presence.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see a white pigeon, which had no doubt
strayed from some neighbouring land, and it seemed to me one
might well argue that we were not far off from a big country
which produces the proper seed-food for this bird. Meeting with a
very big iceberg in the middle of this temperate zone helps to
support this opinion. The route taken by M. Bouvet could now no
longer stand in the way of our looking for the lands of
Gonneville in these regions. I have already observed that M.
Bouvet after having discovered Cape Circumcision in lat. 55° was
obliged to alter his course northwards and was unable to continue
his search beyond the 32° E. of Paris. From this point he had
gone northward to strike the Isle of France.</p>
<p>Our position was now favourable for the discovery of the
southern continent if only we could have advanced in a
south-easterly direction; but unfortunately the state of the
<i>Castries</i> since she was dismasted did not allow M. Marion
to follow out his otherwise well-matured plans.</p>

<h4><span class="aa">Continuation of the Voyage.</span></h4>
<p>After leaving the island <i>Prise de Possession</i>, we
followed latitudes 46° and 47°, and were in a continual fog,
which was so thick that we were frequently obliged to fire off
our cannons in order to save ourselves from collision. It
frequently happened that we could not see the quarterdeck motions
from the forecastle. Seaweed, penguins, sea-wolves, and gulls
with grey stripes were seen every day.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of February we were in lat. 47° 22' S. and 62° long
E. [of Paris], that is to say, 1° 18' to the north of the
southern lands (discovered on the 13th of the same month by the
King's store-ships <i>La Fortune</i> and <i>Le Gros
Ventre</i>),<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> and thirty-one days after our
first discoveries in this part of the world. Had it not been for
the accident to the <i>Castries</i>, we should have touched them
more to westward, and there is every reason to believe that we
would have found the lands seen by Gonneville, which must be more
to the west and of easier approach than those seen by MM. de
Kerguelen and de Saint Alouarn.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> The
sea-wolves, the sea-weed, the birds we saw every day, and the
thick fog we met with when the wind was in the north, informed us
of a neighbouring land to the south of our track. On the 10th
February we were in lat. 45° 36' S. by dead reckoning, in long.
81° 30'. On taking lunars I found we were nearly in longitude 90°
E. of Paris. On that day we changed our course and directed our
route towards the southern portion of New Holland known as Van
Diemen's Land. We met with nothing remarkable until we sighted
this country on the 3rd of March. I calculated we were then in
lat. 42° 56' S. and long. 146° 20' E. of Paris.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The land here referred to is Kerguelen
Island, and the two ships named were those under Kerguelen's
command.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> St. Alouarn was one of Kerguelen's
lieutenants.]</p>
<p>The chart will give an exact idea of the track we followed
until we anchored in the sound named by Abel Tasman <i>Frederic
Henry Bay</i>, and which according to this navigator is situated
in lat. 43° 10' south.</p>

<h4><span class="aa">Anchoring off Van Diemen's Land, Description
of the Country, Observations upon its Inhabitants.</span></h4>
<p>As soon as we had anchored, in 22 fathoms, on a grey sandy
bottom, we lowered the boats and quickly perceived about thirty
men seated on the shore. This part of New Holland
<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> promised us much from the beauty of the
landscape which met our view. From the fires and smokes which we
had seen day and night, we inferred that the country was thickly
populated.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> It was thought, until Bass's discovery
in 1798, that Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) formed part of New
Holland (Australia).]</p>
<p>The next morning the gigs and longboat were sent ashore armed,
and some of the officers, marines, and sailors landed without any
opposition. The aborigines showed themselves agreeable to our
landing, collected firewood and made a sort of pile. They then
offered the new arrivals some dry lighted boughs and appeared to
invite them to set fire to the pile. We did not understand what
they meant by this ceremony, but we lighted the pile; the savages
did not appear at all astonished at this, and they remained round
us without making either any friendly or hostile demonstrations.
Their women and children were with them. The men as well as the
women were of ordinary height, black, with woolly hair, and men
and women were all equally naked. Some of the women carried their
children on their backs, fastened by a rush cord. The men were
all armed with pointed staves and with stones, which appeared to
us to have cutting edges similar to iron axe-heads.</p>
<p>We noticed that these savages had generally small bilious
eyes, full mouths, very white teeth, and flattened noses; their
hair, like that of the wool of Kaffirs, tied in peppercorn knots
[<i>noués par pelotons</i>] and powdered with red ochre; the men
had small natural parts and were not circumcized. Several amongst
them had a sort of cicatrice on the skin on the chest. They
appeared in general to be thin, fairly well made, with broad
chests, and the shoulders well thrown back. Their language seemed
to us very hard and they seemed to draw their voices from the
bottom of the throat.</p>
<p>We endeavoured to gain their good will by means of presents,
but they rejected with disdain all that we offered, even iron,
looking-glasses, handkerchiefs, and pieces of cloth. They were
shown fowls and ducks, brought from the vessel, in order to make
them understand that we wished to buy the like from them. They
took these animals, which by their action they showed to be
unknown to them, and threw them angrily away. We had been
examining these savages for about an hour when M. Marion landed.
One savage stepped out of the group and offered him, the same as
previously to the others, a firebrand, in order to light a little
wood pile. The Commander, thinking that this was a ceremony
intended to prove that he had come with pacific intentions, did
not hesitate to light the pile, but it immediately appeared that
this was all wrong, and that the acceptance of the brand was an
acceptance of a defiance, or a declaration of war.</p>
<p>As soon as the pile was lighted, the savages retired
precipitately on to a hillock, from which they threw a shower of
stones, by which M. Marion, as well as an officer who was with
him, was wounded. We immediately returned the fire and
re-embarked. The gigs and longboats coasted along with the object
of landing in the middle of the bay on a spot we had sighted
where there was no neighbouring height from which those who
landed could be molested. The savages then sent their women and
children into the woods and followed the boats along the shore,
and when we wished to land they opposed our doing so. One of them
uttered a fearful cry, and the whole mob immediately threw their
pointed sticks [spears] at us, by means of one of which a black
servant was wounded in the leg; the wound was not serious, and
the ease with which it was cured proved that these wooden
javelins were not poisoned. As soon as they had thrown their
javelins we answered by a fusilade, which wounded several, and
killed one of them, whereupon they immediately fled into the
woods, howling fearfully, and carrying with them those who, being
wounded, could not follow them. Fifteen men armed with guns
followed them up, and found at the outskirts of the forest one of
the savages dying from the gunshot wound he had received. This
man was five feet three inches high, and had his chest gashed
like that of the Mozambique Kaffirs; he seemed black, but on
washing him we found that his natural colour was reddish, and
that it was only smoke and dirt that made him look so dark.</p>
<p>After the flight of the savages M. Marion sent two well-armed
and officered detachments to look for fresh water and timber
suitable for re-masting the <i>Castries</i>. The detachments
scoured two leagues inland without meeting with either
inhabitants, fresh water, or the timber.</p>
<p>We remained six days in Frederic Henry Bay, during which time
we did not cease making vain search for fresh water. The land
here is sandy like that at the Cape of Good Hope; it is covered
with brushwood and small trees, from most of which the bark had
been torn by the savages, who make use of it for cooking their
shellfish. We found traces of fire everywhere, and the ground
seemed covered with ashes. In the midst of these trees despoiled
of their bark and mostly burnt at the foot we noticed a sort of
pine not so high as ours, which appeared well preserved, probably
because the savages gained something useful from it, and
therefore did not maltreat it as they did the others. It seemed
to us that in going further away from the sea-coast and thus
penetrating deeper inland, we should find these same pines in the
valleys, but tall and thick enough for making into ships'
masts.</p>
<p>In those parts from which the vegetation had not been burnt
off, the soil was covered with grass and brake, similar to that
in Europe, and also with sorrel. There was little game, and we
presumed that the fires made by the savages in this place had
driven them inland. Our hunters met a tiger cat, and found
several holes like those in a warren; they killed some ravens
similar to those in France, some blackbirds, thrushes, turtle
doves, a parrokeet resembling a South American one in plumage
with white beak. They killed all sorts of sea-birds, especially
pelicans, and a black bird with red beak and feet, and which Abel
Tasman mentions in his journal.</p>
<p>The climate of this southern portion of New Holland seemed
very cold to us, although we were there in the middle of summer,
and we could not understand how the natives could exist there in
their naked state. What appeared more extraordinary to us was
that we found no indication of houses, only some break-winds,
rudely formed of branches of trees, with traces of fires near
them. By the considerable heaps of shells which we met with from
time to time, we judged that the ordinary nourishment of the
savages consisted of mussels, pinna or wing shell, scallops,
chama or heart cockles, and other similar shellfish.</p>
<p>We caught <i>chats-de-mer</i>, red fish like gurnets, cod,
wrass, large quantities of very big rays, and many small fishes
which were new to us. Our sailors caught many cray-fish,
lobsters, and very big crabs; the oysters were very good and
abundant. The collectors picked up star-fish, sea-urchins,
scallops with long and spiny scales, <i>rouleaux, olives,
cornets</i>, and several rare and very beautiful shells.</p>
<p>During our sojourn in this bay I made several longitudinal
observations and found it to be situated in longitude 143° E. of
Paris. I observed its latitude at 42° 50' and took bearings.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that in coasting along Van Diemen's Land we
met with very bad weather on the western coast, but on the
eastern coast we found a clearer sky and more tractable
winds.</p>

<h4><span class="aa">Departure from New Holland for New
Zealand.</span></h4>
<p>M. Marion, seeing that we were losing time in looking for
water in a country as wild as its inhabitants, decided to set
sail for New Zealand, where he hoped to find the water we were in
want of, the necessary timbers for re-masting the <i>Castries</i>
and the possibility of caulking the <i>Mascarin</i>, which was
leaking badly.</p>
<p>On the 10th March [1772], we cleared Frederic Henry Bay and
set sail for New Zealand, where we arrived on the 24th of the
same month, without anything remarkable having occurred in the
meanwhile.</p>
<p>New Zealand was discovered by Abel Tasman in 1642, but this
Dutch navigator had in fact only discovered one particular spot.
This portion of the southern lands has been visited lately by
Captain Cook and M. de Surville. It is a strange coincidence that
an English and a French vessel should have approached this
country at the same time. M. de Surville had been in a bight,
which he called Lauriston Bay, while the celebrated Captain Cook
bore down on the two points which form the entrance to the very
bay in which the Frenchmen were anchored and which he for his
part called Double Bay. It is very surprising that Captain Cook
did not learn from the savages of New Zealand, whose language he
understood, of the arrival on these shores of a French transport,
as he had moreover anchored once 20 leagues to the south and once
8 leagues to the north of the French vessel.</p>
<p>As soon as I obtained information of the voyage of the
Englishman, I carefully compared the chart I had prepared of that
part of the coast of New Zealand along which we had coasted with
that prepared by Captain Cook and his officers. I found it of an
exactitude and of a thoroughness of detail which astonished me
beyond all powers of expression, and I doubt much whether the
charts of our own French coasts are laid down with greater
precision. I think therefore that I cannot do better than to lay
down our track off New Zealand on the chart prepared by this
celebrated English navigator. We landed at the foot of the high
mountain named on this chart Mount Egmont. We named it
<i>Mascarin Peak</i>, after our vessel. This peak is situated in
latitude 39° 6' S. and 164½°E. of Paris. Captain Cook fixes this
peak a few degrees more to the east.</p>
<p>We took this mountain for the cape which forms the Southern
entry of Massacre Bay, to which Tasman gives an extent of 40
leagues.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> We approached to within a league
and a half of the shore, in order to reconnoitre, and saw some
men and several fires. This mountain appeared to rise from the
sea, and we judged it to be as high as the Peak of Teneriffe. The
coast here is very steep, and we found a coral and stony bottom
at 80 fathoms, about a league from land. M. Marion, fearing to be
windbound here, stood off, and on 31st of March we returned to
take bearings in latitude 36° 30'. From there we coasted along,
sailing towards the north in quest of the Isles of the Three
Kings.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> The coast could be approached
closely, there being deep water all along, and we sailed about
one to three leagues off and found bottom at 26 to 40
fathoms.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Mount Egmont, in S. lat. 39° 18', and
E. long. 174° 5', is on the east coast of North Island, whereas
Massacre Bay, now generally known as Golden Bay, in S. lat. 40°
45', and E. long. 172° 45', is on the north coast of Middle
Island. Marion's Expedition did not know of Cook's Straits or of
the division of the country into islands.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Discovered by Tasman in 1642 in S. lat.
32° 5', and E. long. 172° 0'.]</p>
<p>While sailing along we were often attacked by squalls from the
N. to the W. which obliged us to stand off. Finally on the 4th of
April, at 9 o'clock in the morning, we perceived the islands,
which from their position we judged to be those of the Three
Kings. On the evening of the 5th of April, when we were close to
these islands, we were again troubled with squalls, which,
obliged us to stand off. On the morning of the 13th we got to
within a league of the islands and saw several men, who in the
distance looked very tall. We noticed several groves of bushes
which looked pleasant, but we were unable to discover the stream
mentioned by Abel Tasman nor even a good landing place. All these
islands may perhaps cover together an extent of about four
leagues; the biggest was grassy and appeared inhabited; the
others, six in number, were only barren and steep rocks.</p>
<p>Having made several vain attempts to land on the largest of
these islands, we returned to the mainland about ten to twelve
leagues off. On the 15th of April we made for land at the N.E.
point of New Zealand, and to which Captain Cook in his charts
gives the name of <i>Cape Maria Van Diemen</i>. We dropped anchor
on the 16th in a cove situated in the most northern part of New
Zealand, but where the ground did not hold well. We immediately
sent a boat on shore in search of water at a spot where there
appeared to be the mouth of a stream, but hardly had the boat
reached the shore when a violent wind arose and the sea became
very rough. The vessels dragged their anchors and we were both
obliged to drop a second anchor. The boat had much difficulty in
regaining the ship, and for fear of accident we had it hauled up
at once. We then spent a very uncomfortable night. At daybreak
the two ships were driving on to the land, so that we were
obliged to set sail and abandon our cables and anchors. The wind
was in the N.E., and should it have veered to the North, we
should have had great difficulty in getting out of this cove.</p>
<p>After having tacked about to get clear of the shore, we
returned to this same cove on the 26th and picked up our cables
and anchors. On the 27th we got out again in search of a better
anchorage. 1 noticed that along this shore there was a current of
a league an hour, which during flood tide has an easterly course.
On getting out we tacked to East and South. On 3rd May we sent a
boat ashore to the east of a cape, which we called Cape
<i>Quarré</i> on account of its shape, and which Captain Cook
called Cape <i>Brett</i>.</p>
<p>When about two leagues off this cape we saw three canoes
approaching us. There was little wind at the time and the sea was
calm. One of the canoes, containing nine men, came close to the
ship; so we made signs to the men to come on board, and sent them
several nicknacks to encourage them. They came with some
uneasiness and appeared not to be quite without fear when
climbing the ship's side. M. Marion showed them into the chart
room and gave them some bread, first of all he ate some, and then
they followed suit. The liquor which was given them they drank
with every sign of disgust. They were induced to take off their
cloths, and instead of these shirts and trousers were given them,
which they seemed to put on with pleasure. We showed them various
implements such as axes, chisels, and adzes. They appeared very
anxious to possess these, and made use of them at once in order
to let us see that they understood their use; these articles
being given them, they went off shortly afterwards highly
satisfied with their reception. As soon as they had got some
distance away from the ship, we saw them take off their shirts
and trousers in order to put on their former clothing, putting
aside those we had given them. They then approached the other
canoes, of which the occupants had not dared to accost us; they
seemed to reassure the latter (and to be inducing them to go and
see us), who then came on board without showing the slightest
signs of fear or distrust. There were two women amongst them; we
gave them some biscuits and some other nicknacks.</p>
<p>In the evening the wind having risen, the canoes returned
ashore, but five or six of these savages remained on board of
their own free-will. We gave them food and drink, they even
supped with us, and ate with good appetite of all our dishes, but
they declined to drink our wine or our liquor. They slept on
board, we arranged beds for them in the saloon, and they slept
well without showing the slightest distrust. They were, however,
watched during the whole night. Amongst these savages their was
one of their chiefs named <i>Tacouri</i>, of whom we shall have
occasion to speak later on, and who showed great uneasiness every
time the vessel turned from the shore in tacking about while
waiting for the boat which had gone ashore in the morning.</p>
<p>The boat returned at eleven o'clock at night, and the officer
in charge reported having found a bay round which there was a
very considerable village which extended considerably inland, and
where there appeared to be a good port, cultivated lands, fresh
water, and wood. On the 4th of May, M. Marion sent two boats
ashore, and we obtained the services of one of the savages to go
with them and to point out to our people the places where they
could water. The savage went willingly, and the boat started in
quest of this cove. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon the boats
returned with the water, and the officers reported having found
good anchorage in this bay at 19 and 20 fathoms. They brought
with them two other savages besides the one who had piloted them,
and reported they had been received on shore by a large number of
canoes, in which there were many men and women who were very
friendly. That same day we anchored amongst the islands, and
remained at anchor there until the 11th of the said month, when
we sailed for a safer port which our boats had discovered on the
6th, but which, on account of contrary winds, we had been unable
to get into sooner. Captain Cook has called this port the <i>Bay
of Islands</i>.</p>

<h3>SOJOURN ON THE NORTHERN PORTION OF NEW ZEALAND, CALLED
EAKENOMAOUVÉ BY THE ABORIGINES.</h3>
<a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>
<h4><span class="aa">Description of the Country and Notes on its
Inhabitants</span>.</h4>
<p>On the 12th of May, 1772, the vessels being safely anchored,
and the weather being fine, M. Marion erected tents on an island
in the middle of the harbour, where there was wood and water,
where there was a suitable cove opposite to the vessel, and
whither he had the sick transported, and where he picketed a
guard. The aborigines call this island
<i>Motouara</i>.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Dr. Thomson (Story of New Zealand, vol.
i. p. 233) says the sick were landed on Te-Wai-iti, and not on
Motu-Arohia, but he does not give his authority for the
statement.]</p>
<p>We had hardly anchored before a large number of canoes came
off and brought us a quantity of fish, and which they explained
they had caught expressly for us. At first we did not know how to
talk to these savages, but by chance I bethought me of a
vocabulary of the island of Ta'ity which had been given me by the
superintendent of the Isle of France. I read several words of
this list, and I saw with the greatest surprise that the savages
understood me perfectly.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> I soon saw that the
language of this country was absolutely the same as that of the
island of Taïty more than 600 leagues distant from New Zealand.
On the approach of night the canoes retired, leaving on board
eight or ten savages who remained the whole night with us just as
though they were our comrades and had known us a long time.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> It will be remembered Captain Cook made
a similar discovery by means of a native of Taïty whom he had
brought with him.]</p>
<p>Next morning being very fine many canoes came along filled
with savages, who brought us their children and their daughters,
all coming unarmed and with the greatest confidence. On arriving
at the vessel, they commenced singing out
<i>Taro</i>,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> the name they give to ships'
biscuit. We gave small pieces to every one, and that with the
greatest economy, for they were such great eaters and so numerous
that if we had given them according to their appetite, they would
soon have consumed our provisions; they brought large quantities
of fish, for which we gave them glass trinkets and pieces of iron
in exchange. In these early days they were content with old nails
two or three inches long, but later on they became more
particular and in exchange for their fish demanded nails four or
five inches in length. Their object in asking for these nails was
to make small wood chisels of them. As soon as they had obtained
a piece of iron, they took it to one of the sailors and by signs
engaged him to sharpen it on the millstone; they always took care
to reserve some fish wherewith to pay the sailor for his trouble.
The ship was full of these savages, who appeared very gentle and
even affectionate. Little by little they came to know the
officers and called them by their names. We only allowed the
chiefs, the women and the girls to enter the chart room. The
chiefs were distinguished by the feathers of egrets or of other
aquatic birds stuck in their hair on the top of their head. The
married women were distinguished by a sort of straw plait which
confined their hair on the top of the head; the girls had no such
distinctive mark, their hair hanging naturally over their neck
without anything to bind it.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Native edible root.]</p>
<p>It was the savages themselves who pointed out these
distinctions and who gave us to understand by signs that we must
not touch the married women, but that we might with perfect
freedom make advances to the girls. It was in fact not possible
to find any more approachable.</p>
<p>As soon as we discovered these distinctions, we passed the
word round the two ships so that every one might be circumspect
with regard to the married women, and thereby preserve the good
understanding with savages who appeared so amiable, and not to
cause them to be ill-affected towards us. The facility with which
the girls were approached was the cause that we never had the
slightest trouble with the savages on account of their women
during the whole time we lived amongst these people.</p>
<p>I remarked with great astonishment that amongst the savages
who boarded the vessels in the early days there were three kinds
of men, of which those who appeared to be the true aborigines
were yellowish-white and the biggest of them all, their mean
height five foot nine to ten inches, and their hair black, glossy
and straight; others were more swarthy and not quite so tall,
their hair slightly frizzled [? curled]; finally there were true
negroes with woolly heads, not so tall as the others but
generally broader in the chest. The former have very little beard
and the negroes have very much.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> These observations are very correct.
There are two distinct races among the Maories, the black or
Papuan, and the yellow or the Malayo-Polynesian.]</p>
<p>The observations I made on these people during the following
days on shore fully confirmed the correctness of my first remark.
Generally speaking, these three kinds of men are handsome and
well formed, with good heads, large eyes, well-proportioned
aquiline noses and well-proportioned mouths, beautiful and very
white teeth, muscular bodies, vigorous arms, strong hands, broad
chests, extremely loud voices, small stomach, almost hairless
well-proportioned but slightly gross legs, broad feet, and the
toes well spread out.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Darwin, who visited the Bay of Islands
in December, 1835, makes a comparison between the appearances of
the New Zealanders and the Taïtians very unfavourable to the
former.]</p>
<p>The women are not so good-looking on close examination; they
have generally a bad figure, are short, very thick in the waist,
with voluminous mammae, coarse thighs and legs, and are of a very
amorous temperament, while on the contrary the men are very
indifferent in this respect.</p>
<p>When we became well acquainted with the savages, they invited
us to land and visit them in their village, the which we did. I
disembarked with M. Marion, well armed and with a detachment of
soldiers. We first of all wandered along a portion of the bay,
where we counted 20 villages, composed of a number of houses, and
large enough to lodge 400 people in every one. The smallest
village would hold at least 200 inhabitants.</p>
<p>We entered several of the villages. From the moment we set
foot on shore, the savages came unarmed to meet us with their
women and children. We made friendly overtures to each other, and
we offered them little gifts which seemed to please them much.
The chiefs of some of these villages were most pressing with
their invitations to go with them and we followed them.</p>

<h4><span class="aa">Description of the Villages of the Northern
Portion of New Zealand.</span></h4>
<p>All the villages are situated on steep cliffs jutting out into
the sea, and we noticed that where the inclination of the ground
was not great, it had been made steep by hand. We had much
difficulty in climbing up, and the savages had often to help us
by holding our hands. On arrival at the top, we found first of
all a palisade formed of piles, driven straight and deeply into
the ground, seven or eight feet high, and the ground well beaten
down and grassed at the foot of the palisades. Then followed a
ditch about six feet broad, and about five to six feet deep, but
this ditch was only placed on the land side, where an enemy might
approach. There was then a second palisade, which, like the
first, served to enclose the whole village into an oblong shape.
The entrance gates are not placed opposite each other. After
entering the first circuit one has to go further along a narrow
path to look for the entrance through the second palisade. The
gates are very small.</p>

<br>
<p>From that side from which they fear attacks they have a sort
of outworks, equally well palisaded and surrounded by ditches,
and which will hold four hundred to five hundred men. This work
is only a palisaded oblong and is placed outside the village to
act as a defence to the entrance. Inside the village, at the side
of the gate, there is a sort of timber platform, about 25 feet
high, the posts being about 18 to 20 inches in diameter and sunk
solidly in the ground. The people climb on to this sort of
advance fort by means of a post with footsteps cut into it. A
considerable collection of stones and short javelins is always
kept up there, and when they fear an attack, they picket the
sentinels there. The platforms are roomy enough to hold fifteen
or twenty fighting men. These two outworks are generally placed
at the outermost gate, and help to defend it as well as to
prevent the ditch being crossed.</p>
<p>The interior of the village is composed of two rows of houses
ranged side by side along the two sides of the palisades which
form the enclosure, and every house is furnished with a
penthouse, which serves as a kitchen. The savages eat their food
under these sheds and never take a meal inside the house. The
space which divides the two rows of houses, and which is more or
less roomy, according to the lay of the ground, serves as a sort
of parade ground, and extends the whole length of the village.
This parade ground is raised about a foot higher than the
surrounding ground on which the houses stand. It is raised by
means of soil brought there and beaten down; no grass is to be
seen on it and the whole place is kept extremely clean. This
whole space between the two rows of houses is only occupied by
three public buildings, of which the first and nearest to the
village gate is the general magazine of arms. A little distance
off is the food storehouse, and still further the storehouse for
nets, all the implements used in fishing, as well as all the
necessary material for making the nets, etc. At about the
extremity of the village there are some large posts set up in the
form of gallows, where the provisions are dried before being
placed in the stores.</p>
<p>In the centre of this parade ground there is a piece of wooden
sculpture representing a hideous figure very badly carved, on
which one can only recognize a rude head, eyes, a great mouth,
very much like the jaws of a toad and out of which protrudes an
immoderately long tongue. All the other portions of the body are
still more shapeless, with the exception of the genital parts;
occasionally of one sex, occasionally of the other, which are
represented in greater detail. This piece of carving is part of a
huge pile sunk deeply into the ground.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Pl-3" id="Pl-3"></a><img alt="" src=
"1306431h-images/Pl-3.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>PLATE 3.</small></p>
<br>
<p>We entered with the chiefs into the first magazine where the
arms are stored; we found a surprisingly large quantity of small
wooden spears, some simply with sharpened points, others carved
in the form of serpents' tongues, and these carvings continued
for the length of a foot from the tip of the javelin, others
furnished with very sharp points made from the bones of the
whale. We also found bludgeons or clubs made of some very hard
wood and of ribs of the whale which are still harder; spears
which seemed made on the model of our ancient halberds for
spearing at one end and clubbing at the other, these lances being
all of a very hard wood and fairly well carved; tomahawks of
stone or of bones of whale, the tomahawks being highly polished,
well sharpened and neatly carved; sticks furnished at one
extremity with knotted cord for throwing darts in the same way as
we throw stones with slings; and some varieties of battle-axes in
hard wood and fairly well designed for killing people.</p>
<p>In this same magazine we found a collection of their common
implements, such as axes, adzes, chisels made of various very
hard stones such as jade, granite, and basalt. The magazines are
generally about 20 to 25 feet long by 10 to 12 broad. In the
interior there is a row of posts which support the ridgeboard of
the roof. The savages arranged their arms round these posts like
a stand of arms according to variety.</p>
<p>In the second magazine, where the savages keep their food in
common, we found sacks of potatoes, bundles of suspended
fern-root, various testaceous fishes, cooked, drawn from the
shell and threaded on blades of rushes and hung up; a large
quantity of fragments of big fish of every variety, cooked,
wrapped up in packets in fern leaf and hung up, and an abundance
of very large calabashes always kept full of water for village
use. This storehouse is almost as big and of the same shape as
the magazine house.</p>
<p>The third storehouse contains the rope, fishing lines, the
flax for making rope, thread and rushes for making string, an
immense quantity of fishhooks of every size from the smallest to
the largest, stones cut to serve as lead weights, and pieces of
wood cut to serve as floats. In this warehouse they keep all the
paddles of their war canoes; it is there that they make their
nets, and when they have finished one they carry it to the
extremity of the village, or every net in the form of a seine to
a separate cabin.</p>
<p>These public storehouses as well as the private houses are
made of timber, well squared and fastened by mortise and tenon
and pinned together; they are generally oblong in form; instead
of planks for the walls of their houses, they make use of
well-made straw matting, which they ply doubled or trebled one on
top of the other, and which shelter them from wind and rain. The
straw mattings also serve as roofs to the houses, but in this
case they are made of a sort of very hard grass which grows in
the marshes, and which the natives manipulate with great skill.
Every house has only one door about three feet high and two feet
broad, which they close from the inside by means of a latch very
much like the iron one which we use in France for closing our
gates. Above the door there is a small window about two feet
square furnished with a rush trellis; inside the house there is
no flooring, but they take the precaution to raise the soil about
a foot and beat it down well so as to avoid damp. In every house
there is a square of boards well joined together about six feet
long and two feet broad; on these planks are laid seven or eight
inches of grass or fern leaves well dried, and upon which they
sleep. They have no other beds. In the middle of the house there
is always a small fire to drive out the dampness. These houses
are very small, being for the most part not more than seven or
eight feet long by five or six feet broad. The houses of the
chiefs are larger; they are ornamented with pieces of carved
wood, and the posts in the interior are also carved. The only
furniture we found in these houses were fishhooks of
mother-of-pearl and of wood and bone, nets, fishing lines, some
calabashes full of water, stone implements such as we had seen in
the common store-houses, mantles and other clothing hanging on
the partition.</p>
<p>The whole of the villages which we saw during our two months'
stay in the Bay of Islands appeared to be constructed on the same
plan without any well-defined differences. The construction and
form of the private houses as well as those of the chiefs were
the same in all the villages; they were all palisaded and placed
on high cliffs. At the extremity of every village and on the
point which jutted furthest into the sea there was a public place
of accommodation for all the inhabitants.</p>

<h4><span class="aa">The Food of the Inhabitants of the North of
New Zealand.</span></h4>
<p>We were extremely well received by the savages. They came in
mobs on to the vessels and appeared there every day, and we went
similarly to their villages and into their houses with the
greatest security. This naturally gave us every facility for
seeing how these people fed themselves, what were their
occupations, their works, their industry, and even their
amusements.</p>
<p>We have already noticed that the basis of the food of these
people is the root of a fern absolutely similar to ours, with the
sole difference that in some places the New Zealand fern has a
much bigger and longer root and its fronds grow to greater
length.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The New Zealand fern is <i>Pteris
aquilina</i>, var. <i>esculenta</i>, and the European species is
<i>Pteris aquilina</i>. The difference is thus very slight. See
Figs. 17 and 18.]</p>
<p>Having pulled up the root they dry it for several days in the
air and sun. When they wish to eat it they hold it before the
fire, roast it lightly, pound it between two stones, and when in
this state they chew it in order to obtain the juices, which to
me appeared farinaceous; when they have nothing else to eat, they
eat even the woody fibre; but when they have fish or shellfish or
some other dish, they only chew the root and reject the
fibre.</p>
<p>These people live also principally on fish and on shellfish;
they eat quail, ducks and other aquatic birds which abound in
their country, also various species of birds, dogs, rats, and
finally they eat their enemies.</p>
<div class="insertl"><a name="Fig05" id="Fig05"></a><img alt=""
src="1306431h-images/Fig05.jpg"></div>
<p>The New Zealanders have no vessel in which to cook their meat;
the general custom in all the villages we visited was to cook the
meat and fish in a sort of subterranean oven. In every kitchen
there is a hole one and a half feet deep and two feet in
diameter; on the bottom of the hole they place stones, on the
stones they place wood which they light, on this wood they place
a layer of flat stones which they make red hot, and on these
latter stones they place the meat or fish which they desire to
cook.</p>
<p>They also live on potatoes and gourds, which they cook in the
same way as their meat. Their habits in eating are dirty.</p>
<p>I have also seen them eat a sort of green gum which they like
immensely, but I was not able to find out the tree from which
they obtained it. Some of us ate of this by letting it drop in
our mouths. We all found it very heating.</p>
<p>We also remarked that the savages eat regularly twice a day,
once in the morning, the other time at sunset. As they are all
strong, hardy, big, well-formed, and with good constitution, one
concludes that their food is very healthy, and I think it well to
repeat here that fern root forms the basis of their food.</p>
<div class="insertr"><a name="Fig06" id="Fig06"></a><img alt=""
src="1306431h-images/Fig06.jpg"></div>
<p>Generally speaking they appeared to me to be great eaters;
when they came on board our vessel, we could not satisfy them
sufficiently with the biscuit which they liked immensely. When
the sailors were eating they would approach them in order to get
a portion of their soup and of their salt meat. The sailors used
to give them the remains on their platters, which the savages
took care to clean out thoroughly; they were very fond of fat and
even of tallow. I have even seen them take the tallow from the
sounding lead or tallow otherwise used in the ship and eat it as
a tasty morsel. They were very partial to sugar; they drank tea
and coffee with us, and liked our drinks according as they were
more or less sweetened. They showed great repugnance for wine,
and especially for strong liquors; they do not like salt and do
not eat it. They drink a great deal of water, and when I saw them
very thirsty, I used to think that this desire to be continually
drinking was caused by their dry food, the fern root.</p>

<a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>
<h4><span class="aa">The Clothing of the Savages of the North of
New Zealand.</span></h4>
<p>The savages in this part of the world never wear any
head-dress; they tie their hair into a tuft on the top of their
heads with a piece of cord or plaits of grass, and then cut it
oflf in the form of a round brush an inch or two above the cord;
for want of scissors for this operation they make use of a shell
the edges of which they sharpen. The men and women rub fish oil
into their hair and powder it with crushed red ochre. Many of
them only powder the tuft, and the chiefs adorn their heads with
white plumes.</p>
<p>The married women arrange their hair the same as the men » the
girls allow their hair to fall naturally on their necks, and cut
it so that it does not grow below the shoulders.</p>
<p>Young women paint their lips black, which is no doubt done in
order the better to show off the whiteness of their teeth.</p>
<p>The ears of the men are pierced like those of the women, and
they all equally adorn them with mother-of-pearl and lustrous
shells, or with feathers, or with small dogbones.</p>
<p>Some wear round their necks pieces of jade of a very fine
green of various forms joined together, engraved or carved. Some
of this jade glitters very much. They sometimes wear
mother-of-pearl, pieces of wood, or bundles of feathers.</p>
<p>The women wear necklaces made like rosaries, composed of
broken pieces of equal lengths of white teeth alternately with
black irregular tubes; others wear necklaces made of small very
hard black stones of a fruit which I do not know.</p>
<p>Men and women wear a mantle on their shoulders, held up by
means of a plait round the neck, and which hangs down as far as
the waist. These mantles are made of a small piece of coarse
stuff, without seam, and made for this purpose only: they just
exactly cover the shoulders and the back, and leave the chest and
stomach uncovered.</p>
<p>Besides this mantle, they have a sort of cloth of the same
material, which envelopes the waist and thighs, and hangs as far
as the calf of the leg. This second garment is, like the first,
common to both men and women; it is bound and held round the
waist by a belt about four fingers wide. These belts are
sometimes made of the same material, and sometimes of plaited
rushes.</p>
<p>They have invented another sort of garment which is in fact a
waterproof mantle. This mantle is made of very coarse flax, of
which the fairly long ends stick out above the tissue; the side
of the material thus bristling with long strings, like skin with
the hair on, the savages put on the outside to receive the rain,
which thus runs off as from a roof. The mantle is long, and
covers almost the whole body.</p>
<div class="insertr"><a name="Fig07" id="Fig07"></a><img alt=""
src="1306431h-images/Fig07.jpg"></div>
<p>The chiefs are distinguished from the rest of the people by
mantles and loincloths of finer tissue. I noticed that only the
chiefs had very nicely worked mantles, with very fine thongs of
dogskin adroitly twisted close together, with the colours
arranged symmetrically, and having the appearance of consisting
of a single skin. They put the hair inside touching their skin
when it is cold, and outside when it is warm. But the most
striking way discovered by the chiefs of these savages to
distinguish themselves has been to engrave (tatu) their face and
buttocks in the most hideous manner: they draw designs by means
of small pricks on the forehead, cheeks, and even the nose, and
as the blood runs out they rub powdered charcoal into the outer
skins, and which cannot be effaced. They study to invent designs
which make them look horrible and give them a most fearful look.
All these designs on the faces of the various chiefs are very
varied, but the designs on the buttocks are always the same: on
these parts they trace in equally indelible marks a very neat
spiral line, of which the first point is on the centre of the
most fleshy part, and successively embraces the whole
circumference.</p>
<p>They have also on both hands two little black engravings drawn
very correctly in the form of an "S." The chiefs were very
pleased to show us all the tatuings on their bodies, and seemed
even proud and conceited about them.</p>

<a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>
<h4><span class="aa">The Arts of the Savages in the North of New
Zealand.</span></h4>
<p>The arts of these savage people are almost confined to four
objects: to procure sufficient nourishment, a simple lodging
against the inclemencies of the climate, the garments necessary
in a climate colder than appears consistent with the position of
their islands, and finally, to fortify themselves and to insure
themselves against invasions by their fellows, and even to attack
and destroy the latter.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned that the fern root is the basis of
their food. This root naturally grows very deep in the soil, and
in order to dig it up they have invented a sort of pointed spade
very much like a lever pointed at one end, to which they have
fixed transversely a piece of wood, strongly bound with cord,
which serves as footpiece, while they work the lever at the other
end with their arms, to send it deeply into the ground, and are
thus enabled to raise large clods. As this lever has only a
certain breadth at the end which is pushed into the ground, two
men join together to work it to lift the same clod. This sort of
spade very much resembles a stilt on which the step is placed at
about two and a half feet from the bottom.</p>
<div class="insertl"><a name="Fig08" id="Fig08"></a><img alt=""
src="1306431h-images/Fig08.jpg"></div>
<p>These people have already made a start in the art of
agriculture. They cultivate a few small fields of potatoes
similar to those of the Two Indies, they also cultivate gourds,
which they eat when they are small and tender, and when they are
ripe they take out inside, dry them, and make use of them for
carrying and conserving water. Some of their calabashes will hold
as much as from ten to twelve pints of water.</p>
<p>They also cultivate an aloes-pite and a sort of
<i>reed</i>,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> which, when ripe, furnishes
them, after retting, with thread to make their cloth, and cords
for various uses. In the cultivation of these crops they make use
of the same instrument of which I have just spoken, sharpened and
trimmed so as to form a sort of spade. It seemed to me that they
confined their whole agriculture to two or three objects. They
have no knowledge of any sort of grain and, excepting some small
fields planted with potatoes, gourds, aloes-pite, and very small
flax, the whole country appeared to me to be lying fallow, and
producing only the wild natural growths. I saw nothing which
might be taken for an orchard, and I did not even meet with the
least fruit, either wild or cultivated.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> By this is here probably meant the New
Zealand flax.]</p>
<div class="insertr"><a name="Fig09" id="Fig09"></a><img alt=""
src="1306431h-images/Fig09.jpg"></div>
<p>As fish, after the fern root, forms their staple food, their
arts are particularly directed towards all that concerns fishery.
Without iron, or any other metal, they make hooks of all sizes
out of mother-of-pearl and various other shells, all worked with
great skill. Their fishing lines, as well as their nets of every
description, are knotted with the same adroitness as those of the
cleverest fisherman of our seaports; they manufacture seines five
hundred feet long; and for want of corks to hold up the net, they
make use of a very light white wood, and for lead to weigh it
down, they make use of very heavy round pebbles enclosed in a
network sheath which runs along the bottom of the seine.</p>
<p>They manufacture their seines of reeds and a sort of
well-twisted thread, coloured red with fish oil. The knots of
these seines are exactly similar to those of our nets.</p>
<p>All the villages situated in the middle of the Bay of Islands,
where we anchored, possessed a considerable number of canoes.
These boats, which were dug-outs, appeared to be generally well
made, with lines calculated for speed, well worked, and more or
less carved. The majority of the canoes were 20 to 25 feet long
by two and a half to three feet broad. Their principal use is for
fishing, and every canoe ordinarily carries seven or eight
men.</p>
<p>Besides these boats, which appeared to be private property,
every village possesses in common two or three big war canoes for
attacking purposes. I measured one of them which was seventy feet
long by six feet broad and four deep, made of the body of a
single tree trunk, the two sides of which were raised by means of
planks skilfully sewn on, the sewing well caulked, and the whole
canoe painted red by the aid of oil. These war canoes have
carved, and very high, poops and prows.</p>
<p>The savages make use of paddles instead of oars; these paddles
are of most perfect cut, and so shaped as to add by the
elasticity of the blade to the force of the stroke. In certain
points these paddles might serve as models to the boatmen of our
ports. The paddles of the chiefs, who ordinarily command the
canoes, are nicely carved on the back.</p>
<p>What is astonishing in the arts of the savages, in the
construction of their boats, of their paddles, in their carvings,
in fact in all their works, is that they have no iron nor any
other metal which can take its place; as a consequence they have
none of the tools which our workmen make use of. In lieu thereof
they have very hard stones sharpened and formed like iron axes,
chisels, and adzes. The stones they chiefly use for this purpose
are jade and basalt. It is no doubt a great art to be able to
substitute for iron materials so raw and so varied. However, this
art is common to all savages known in different parts of the
globe, and the tools of the Australians are exactly the same as
those which have been found in New Guinea, in New Holland,
amongst the islanders of the South Seas, and finally amongst the
inhabitants of America when that part of the world was first
discovered.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> It is even probable that before
the discovery of iron and of the method of smelting it, so as to
adapt it to our uses, the primitive inhabitants of the earth, the
forefathers of all those nations of to-day who have made the
greatest advances in the arts, commenced by making use of stone
tools. It is probable that they made use of these rude tools for
a long time and perhaps for centuries.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> When these words were written,
travellers were not in the habit of making minute examination of
the weapons, etc., of savages. While all savages make use of
stone in some shape or other for their implements and weapons,
there is a vast difference between the palaeolithic form almost
as found in nature as made use of by the Tasmanian and the
neolithic highly finished article produced by the New
Zealander.]</p>
<p>The boats of New Zealand are all built of a splendid cedar
with which the country abounds. By following M. du Hamel's
<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> method for obtaining the specific weights
of wood, I found that the New Zealand cedar when freshly cut did
not weigh above a pound and a half more per cubic foot than the
best quality of Riga pine.</p>

<div class="insertr"><a name="Fig10-11" id=
"Fig10-11"></a><img alt="" src="1306431h-images/Fig10-11.jpg"></div>
<p>I have already mentioned that the savages feed on shellfish.
The procuring of this sort of nourishment does not call forth any
special art, and the women and girls go daily to collect it off
the rocks in the sea. For this purpose they put on a rush apron
made like matting to save their petticoats from the sea-water;
round their waists they carry a rush basket, into which they
collect the shellfish and carry it to their villages. These
savages know of no other method of capturing game than the net
and the running noose; with these they catch quail, wild ducks, a
very large species of wood pigeon, and several other kinds of
birds of which I shall speak later on. They do not know the use
of the bow and arrow.</p>
<p>I have already spoken of the arts of the Austral savages in
the formation and arrangement of their villages, in the
construction of their public storehouses and of their private
dwellings. The arts employed in the manufacture of their garments
cover a large number of objects. They cultivate flax and know how
to ret it. After retting they beat it in order to detach the hard
or woody portion, they then comb their thread with combs made of
large sea-shells, and lastly they have a sort of crude and simple
wheel and distaff for spinning their thread. They make also a
thread of five or six strands of hair which is very strong.
Finally they have a method of working which seems to be the
commencement of that followed by our weavers, and by which they
make cloth of very close tissue and of good wear.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to estimate the immeasurable distance
there exists between the rude industries of the savages and those
which amongst enlightened nations serve their wants and their
luxuries. It is impossible to imagine the trouble and the
enormous loss of time savages suffer from the imperfection of
their arts; one must perhaps have seen the insufficiency and the
fatiguing efforts of these industries of early man, emerging as
it were from the hands of nature, in order to be sensible how
grateful we ought to feel towards those who by their labours from
century to century have so perfected all our arts.</p>
<p>The savages of New Zealand live in a continual state of
warfare; their palisaded villages, surrounded by ditches and
situated on very high cliffs, prove that they fear their enemies
and are always on the defensive. This continual state of warfare
has inclined their labour towards the manufacture of every
species of implement useful for destroying their fellows, and has
brought about the use of stone, wood, and bones of animals to
that end. Their tomahawks are of stone, generally of basalt, and
sometimes of jade. Their lances, their javelins, and their pikes
are made of a very hard and heavy wood; their clubs or bludgeons
are made of wood and of the bones of whales; their war trumpets
are of wood and give out a very disagreeable sound similar to
that of shepherds' horns. All these murderous instruments are
carved and worked with care, and the savages possess large
quantities of them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless all their arms are ridiculous and contemptible
when opposed to men armed in European fashion: fifty fusiliers
with sufficient ammunition, and who might have to revenge
themselves on these people, could without danger destroy them
like wild beasts and entirely exterminate them.</p>
<p>Besides these destructive instruments they have two or three
varieties of flutes from which they extract fairly sweet but at
the same time discordant sounds by breathing into them with their
nostrils. I have heard them play on these instruments, especially
in the evening when they were locked up in their villages, and it
appeared to me they sometimes dance to the sound of the
flutes.</p>

<h4><span class="aa">The Religion of the Savages of the Northern
Part of New Zealand.</span></h4>
<p>We did not remain long enough in New Zealand, and I was always
too much occupied with the wants of our vessels, to be able to
acquire satisfactory notions regarding the worship and belief of
the savages. I have, however, sufficient grounds for believing
that they have some religion, and these are as follow:</p>
<p>1. They have in their language a word which expresses the
Divinity; they call it <i>Ea-Toue</i>, a name which describes one
who makes the earth tremble.</p>
<p>2. When they were asked questions on this subject, they raised
their eyes and hands towards heaven with demonstrations of
respect and fear, which indicated their belief in a Supreme
Being.</p>
<p>3. I have already said that in the middle of every village
there is a carved figure which appears to represent the tutelary
god of the village. In their private houses are to be found
similar figures like little idols placed in positions of honour.
Several savages carried similar figures carved in jade or in wood
round their necks. These figures are simply hideous, they nearly
all have an immoderately long tongue and have a fearful look, and
if these images represent their divinity, they prove that the
people regard him as an evil being. It is possible that in their
opinion all these figures only represent the demon authors of
evil which differ from the Divinity.</p>
<p>4. I noticed that the savages who came to sleep on board our
vessels were in the habit of communing with themselves in the
middle of the night, to sit up and mumble a few words which
resembled a prayer in which they answered one another and
appeared to chant. This sort of prayer generally lasted eight or
ten minutes.</p>
<p>5. If there were any savages on board our vessels when we went
to prayers, they did not appear astonished; they took up the
attitude of the sailors, and appeared to join in their
prayers.</p>

<h4><span class="aa">Continuation of Observations and of various
Events which took place during our Stay in the Bay of Islands in
New Zealand.</span></h4>
<p>A few days after our arrival in the Bay of Islands M. Marion
made several journeys along the coast, and even into the interior
of the country, in search of suitable timber for making masts for
the <i>Castries</i>, and in these excursions the savages
accompanied him everywhere. On the 23rd of May M. Marion
discovered a forest of magnificent cedars about two leagues
inland, and within reach of a bay about a league and a half
distant from our vessels.</p>
<p>We immediately made a settlement there. We sent thither
two-thirds of our crews with axes, tools, and all the necessary
apparatus, not only for cutting down the trees and making masts
thereof, but also to smooth a road over three small hills and
across a marsh, which had to be traversed in order to bring the
masts to the sea-shore.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Dr. Thomson writing in 1859,
eighty-seven years after the event, says: "Part of the cut down
tree and the road made to drag it along still remain, and was
pointed out to me as the road of Marion" (Story of New Zealand,
vol. i. p. 235).]</p>
<p>We established barracks in communication with the settlement
on the shore nearest to the place where we had our workshop; to
this post our vessels sent daily boats laden with provisions for
the workmen who were hutted two leagues inland.</p>
<p>We had three posts on land. One was on the island
<i>Moutouara</i> in the middle of the bay, where we had our sick
under tents, our forge where we made the iron bands for the
re-masting of the <i>Castries</i>, and also our empty casks, with
the coopers, for it was on that island that we obtained our
water. This post was guarded by an officer, with ten armed men,
and the surgeons at the service of the sick. A second post was on
the sea-shore of the mainland, a league and a half from our
vessels, which served as store and as point of communication with
our carpenters' workshop situated two leagues further off, in the
middle of the forest. These two latter posts were equally under
the command of officers, who had armed men under them in order to
guard our goods.</p>
<p>The savages were always amongst us at our settlements and on
board our vessels, and in exchange for nails they furnished us
with fish, quail, wood-pigeons, and wild duck; they ate with our
sailors and helped them in their labours; and every time they set
to work, the result was very noticeable, for they were extremely
strong, and their help relieved our crews very much.</p>
<p>Our young men, attracted by the winning ways of the savages,
and by the friendliness of their daughters, overran the villages
every day, even making journeys inland to hunt the ducks, and
taking with them the savages, who carried them across marshes and
rivers as easily as a man would carry a child.</p>
<p>It sometimes happened that they strayed very far so as to get
among savages of another canton, and to find there villages very
much bigger than those in our bay. There they found men with
whiter skins, who received them very well, and they occasionally
returned in the middle of the night through the forests,
accompanied by a mob of savages, who carried them when they were
fatigued.</p>
<p>In spite of these proofs of friendship on the part of the
savages, we were always a little on our guard, and our boats
never went ashore without being well armed; neither did we allow
the savages to come on board our vessels when they were armed.
But at last confidence was established to that pitch that M.
Marion gave orders that the whale boats and gigs going ashore
should be disarmed. I did all that I possibly could to get this
order rescinded, and in spite of the winning ways of the savages,
I never forgot that our predecessor, Abel Tasman, had named
Massacre Bay that bay where he had land-fallen in New Zealand. We
did not know that Capt. Cook had visited it since, and had made
an entire survey; neither did we then know that he had found the
people cannibals, and that he was to be killed in the same bay in
which we were now anchored.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Cook was killed in the Hawaiian
Islands, and not in this bay.]</p>
<div class="insertl"><a name="Fig12-13" id=
"Fig12-13"></a><img alt="" src="1306431h-images/Fig12-13.jpg"></div>
<p>It is very surprising that savages, who in the preceding year
had seen and traded with a French and an English
vessel,<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> and who must necessarily have
obtained from these ships iron, cloth, and other European goods,
should never have allowed us to notice anything about this, and
should never have given us to understand that they had seen other
vessels besides our own. It is true that the goods we gave them
daily were never seen again by us, nor did we see any traces of
them in overrunning their villages and on visiting their
houses.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> De Surville's and Cook's vessels are
those referred to here.]</p>
<p>Lulled into a feeling of the greatest security, it was M.
Marion's greatest happiness to live in the very midst of these
savages. When he was on board, the council chamber was full of
them; he fondled them and with the help of the Taïty vocabulary
he tried to make himself understood. He overwhelmed them with
presents. They on their part recognized perfectly that M. Marion
was the chief of the two vessels; they knew that he liked turbot,
and every day they brought him some very fine ones. Whenever he
showed a desire for anything, he always found them at his orders.
Whenever he went ashore, all the savages accompanied him as
though it were a day of feasting, and with joyful demonstrations;
the women, the girls, and even the children petted him. They all
called him by name.</p>
<p>So great was the confidence established that <i>Tacouri</i>,
the previously-mentioned chief of the largest village, brought
his son on board to M. Marion, aged about fourteen years, whom he
appeared to love very much, and whom he even allowed to pass the
night in the ship.</p>
<p>When three of M. Marion's slaves deserted in a canoe, which
sank on reaching the shore, <i>Tacouri</i> had those who had not
been drowned arrested, and sent them back to M. Marion.</p>

<br>
<p>One day a savage entered by the port hole of the
powder-magazine and stole a sword; he was discovered, made to
come on deck, and was denounced to the chief, who severely
reprimanded him, and who begged that he should be put in irons
just like a sailor. The thief was however sent away without
punishment.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> See remarks of l'Abbé Rochon in the
Introduction.]</p>
<p>We had become so familiar with these men that nearly all the
officers had particular friends amongst them, who served them and
accompanied them everywhere; had we departed about this time, we
would have brought to Europe the most favourable accounts of
these savages; we would have painted them in our relations with
them as the most affable, the most humane, and the most
hospitable people on the face of the earth. From our accounts
philosophers fond of praising primitive man would have triumphed
in seeing the speculations of their studies confirmed by the
accounts of travellers whom they would have recommended as worthy
of belief. But we would all of us have been in the wrong.</p>
<p>On the 8th of June M. Marion had landed, accompanied by a mob
of savages as usual. He was received with greater demonstrations
of friendship than ever; the chiefs assembled and by common
accord appointed him Grand Chief of the country, and they stuck
in his hair on the top of his head the four white plumes which
serve to distinguish chiefs. He returned on board more pleased
with the savages than ever.</p>
<p>While this was going on the young savage for whom I had grown
to have a great affection, who came to see me every day and who
showed great attachment towards me, paid me a visit; he was a
fine young man, well made, with a sweet expression and always
smiling. On this particular day he appeared sorrowful in a way in
which I had never seen him before. He brought me as a present
some arms, implements, and ornaments of a very beautiful jade
which I had expressed a desire to possess. I wished to pay him
for these things with iron implements and red handkerchiefs,
which I knew would please him, but he refused them. I wished to
make him take back his jade, but he would not. I offered him
something to eat, he refused again and went away very
sorrowfully. I never saw him afterwards.</p>
<p>Some other savages, friends of our officers and accustomed to
come and visit them every day, disappeared at this time, but we
did not pay sufficient attention to the fact. We had been
thirty-three days in the Bay of Islands and lived on the very
best of terms with the savages, who appeared to us to be the best
people one could possibly meet with; we spread into the country
every day in order to reconnoitre, to study its productions and
see if we could discover any metals or other objects fit for
commerce, M. Marion had sometimes gone very far in his gig, and
had visited various bays inhabited by other savages, all of whom
had received him well.</p>
<p>On the 12th June at two o'clock in the afternoon, M. Marion
landed in his gig armed with a dozen men, taking with him two
young officers MM. de Vaudricourt and Le Houx, and a volunteer
and master-at-arms, altogether sixteen people. The above-named
<i>Tacouri</i>, the chief of the largest village, another chief,
and five or six savages who were on board, accompanied M. Marion,
whose object was to go and eat oysters and run the seine at the
foot of the chiefs village.</p>
<p>At nightfall M. Marion did not return to sleep at his usual
hour. No one returned from the gig, but none of us were alarmed,
as the hospitality of these savages was so well known to us that
we did not distrust them in the least. We merely thought that M.
Marion and his followers were remaining to sleep on land in our
huts in order to be nearer in the morning to the workshops, two
leagues inland, where the masts of the <i>Castries</i> were being
made. The masts were approaching completion, and part of the
materials had already been transported close to the shore, the
savages helping us every day with these fatiguing transports.</p>
<div class="insertr"><a name="Fig14-15" id=
"Fig14-15"></a><img alt="" src="1306431h-images/Fig14-15.jpg"></div>
<p>The next morning, the 13th June, the <i>Castries</i> sent the
longboat ashore for wood and water for the day's consumption, it
being customary for the two vessels to send alternately every day
for common wants. At nine o'clock, however, a man was seen
swimming towards the vessels, and a boat was immediately lowered
to help him and bring him on board. This man was one of the
longboat's crew, who alone had saved 1 himself from the massacre
of his comrades&mdash; murdered by the savages. He had two
spear-wounds in his side and had been badly hurt. He stated that
when the longboat landed at seven o'clock in the morning, the
savages had appeared on the shore without arms and with their
usual demonstrations of friendship, that they had even as was
customary carried such sailors who were afraid to wet their feet
on their shoulders from the boat to the shore, that they had
shown themselves as good fellows as hitherto, but that when the
sailors had separated one from another in order to pick up their
bundles of wood, the savages attacked them furiously, in bands of
eight or ten for every sailor, with tomahawks, clubs, and spears,
and so murdered them. As for himself, as he had only to do with
two or three savages, he at first defended himself and received
two spear-wounds, but seeing other savages approach, he had run
off and hidden himself in the brushwood. From there he had seen
his comrades killed, and how that the savages having killed them,
stripped them, cut open their stomachs, and commenced hacking
them to pieces. He then started to reach the vessel by
swimming.</p>
<p>After such a fearful account we doubted no longer that M.
Marion and the sixteen men in the gig, of whom we had no news,
had suffered the same fate as the eleven men of the longboat.</p>
<p>The officers who still remained on board immediately met
together in order to consult about saving the three stations we
had on land.</p>
<p>The <i>Mascarin's</i> longboat, well armed with an officer and
a detachment of soldiers commanded by a sergeant, was immediately
despatched ashore. The officer had instructions to search the
length of the coast for the gig of M. Marion and for the
longboat, but he was above all instructed to warn the stations
and to go first to the landing place nearest to the mastyard in
order to carry the greatest help to this station with the news of
what had happened. The officer discovered the longboat of the
<i>Castries</i> and M. Marion's gig stranded together at the foot
of <i>Tacouri's</i> village and surrounded by savages armed with
axes, swords, and muskets which they had taken from the two boats
after having slaughtered our people.</p>
<p>In order not to lose any time, the officer did not stop at
this place, where he might easily have scattered the savages and
retaken the boats, for he feared lest he might be too late to
arrive in time at the mastyard station, and he stuck to his
orders to carry prompt help thither with news of the tragic
events of the morning and of the day before.</p>
<p>Fortunately I was at the station, having passed the night
there. I had not slept, but without knowing anything of the
massacre of M. Marion, I had kept a good watch. I was on a little
hill and occupied in directing the transport of our masts, when
about two o'clock in the afternoon I saw a detachment marching
towards us in good order with bayonets fixed, which I recognized
at a distance, on account of their brightness, as not being the
ordinary arms of the ship.</p>
<p>I understood at once that this detachment had come to give us
news of something wrong. In order not to frighten our men, as
soon as the sergeant, who was at the head, was within hailing
distance, I ordered him to stop, and I alone approached so as to
ascertain what was the matter. As soon as I heard his report, I
ordered the detachment to preserve silence and marched with them
to the station.</p>
<div class="insertr"><a name="Fig16" id="Fig16"></a><img alt=""
src="1306431h-images/Fig16.jpg"></div>
<p>I immediately stopped all work and had the implements and arms
collected, the muskets charged, and divided amongst the sailors
all that they could carry away. I had a hole dug in one of the
barracks in order to bury the rest. I then had the hut pulled
down and burnt, so that the few implements and utensils which I
had buried, as not being able to carry away with me, might be
hidden under the ashes.</p>
<p>Our men knew nothing of the misfortunes which had overtaken M.
Marion and their comrades, for it was necessary that they should
not lose their heads if we were to get out of the trouble. We
were surrounded by armed savages whom I had only then perceived
when the detachment joined us and after the sergeant had made his
report. The assembled savages occupied the surrounding
heights.</p>
<p>The detachment, now reinforced by the sailors armed with
muskets, I divided into two divisions; one division headed by the
sergeant led the way, the sailors carrying the implements and
other effects following in the centre, and I followed in the rear
with the other half. We were about sixty men. We passed several
mobs of savages, of whom the various chiefs repeated frequently
the sad words, "<i>Tacouri maté Marion</i>, that is to say, "The
chief Tacouri has killed Marion." It was the intention of the
chiefs to frighten us, for we had learned that amongst them when
a chief is killed in a quarrel, all is lost for his
followers.</p>
<p>We thus marched two leagues to the sea-shore, where the
longboats awaited us, without having been harassed by the
savages, who contented themselves with following alongside and
frequently repeating that Marion was dead and eaten. There were
in the detachment several good marksmen, who, hearing that M.
Marion was killed, were burning to avenge his death and
frequently asked my permission to break the heads of those chiefs
who appeared to threaten us. This was, however, not the time to
occupy ourselves with vengeance. In the state in which we were
then, the death of a single man would have been an irreparable
loss, and had we lost several, the two vessels might never have
left New Zealand. We had besides a third station, that of the
sick, which had still to be placed in safety. I accordingly
restrained the ardour of our men, and prohibited them from
firing, promising to give their vengeance full play at a more
favourable opportunity.</p>
<p>When we arrived at our longboat, the savages began to press us
more closely. I ordered the burdened sailors to embark first,
then addressing one of the savage chiefs, I fixed a peg in the
ground ten paces from him, and gave him to understand that if a
single savage crossed the line of the peg I should shoot him with
my carbine, which I raised in apparent readiness for action. I
told them in threatening tones to sit down. The chief repeated my
order quietly to his people, and immediately the savages, about a
thousand strong, sat down.</p>
<p>I made all our people embark, which took long enough, because
there was much baggage to put in the longboat, and the boat when
loaded could not be launched easily, and we were obliged to wade
into the water in order to start her. I was the last to embark,
and as soon as I had entered the water, the savages rose <i>en
masse</i>, crossed the marked line, and uttering their war cry,
threw wooden spears and stones at us, which did harm to nobody.
They burned our huts on the bank, and threatened us with their
arms, which they beat together, uttering fearful yells. As soon
as I got into the boat, I had the grapnel raised and so arranged
the men that they should not interfere with the oarsmen. The boat
was so over-loaded that I was obliged to stand up in the stern
with the arm of the rudder between my legs. I did not intend to
fire a single shot, but intended to re join the vessel promptly
in order to send the longboat to <i>Moutouaro</i> Island, and
there relieve the invalid station, our forge and cooperage.</p>
<p>As we began to get away from the shore the cries and threats
of the savages increased to such an extent that our departure
looked like a retreat, and the savages entered the water as
though determined to attack us. Much to my regret I found it
advisable and necessary for our safety that I should make these
unhappy people understand the superiority of our arms. I had the
rowing stopped, and ordered four fusiliers to fire at the chiefs,
who appeared more excited and animated than all the others. Every
shot told, and this fusilade continued some minutes. The savages
saw their chiefs and comrades fall in the most senseless manner,
they could not understand how they could be killed by arms which
did not touch them like their tomahawks and
clubs.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> At every shot they re-doubled their
cries and threats; they were most horribly excited, and as they
remained on the shore like a flock of sheep, we might indeed have
killed every man of them had I desired to continue the firing;
but after having killed many more than I wished to, we rowed on
to the vessel, while the savages did not leave off shouting.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> This statement sounds strange when we
remember that for more than a month the natives had opportunities
of seeing wild fowl killed with guns.]</p>
<p>As soon as I arrived on board the <i>Mascarin</i>, I
despatched the longboat to relieve the sick station. I sent a
detachment commanded by an officer with orders to send on board
all the sick, the surgeon's assistants, and all the utensils of
our hospital, to pull down the tents, to make an entrenchment
with our casks round the forge for the night, to picket an
advance sentinel on the side towards the village which was on the
same island, to keep a good watch and to take every precaution
against a surprise, for I feared some attack by the savages on
our forging establishment, where the iron would very likely tempt
them. At the same time I arranged with the officer in charge for
signals during the night, and promised to send him prompt
assistance in case of attack.</p>
<p>The sick were happily brought on board without accident
towards eleven o'clock at night. The savages prowled round about
the post, but seeing our people well on guard, they dared not
make an attack, having failed to surprise them.</p>
<p>The next morning, the 14th June, I sent a second detachment
with a couple of officers on to the island. We had not as yet
sufficient wood and water on board to enable us to continue our
voyage, and after our experience with the savages, we should have
had much difficulty in raising these stores on the mainland.</p>
<p>The island <i>Moutouaro</i>, placed as it was in the middle of
the harbour close to our vessels, gave us as much wood as we
wanted and there was a fresh water spring for filling our casks;
but as there was on this island a village of about three hundred
savages, who might be in a position to trouble us, I instructed
the officer in charge of the station that in case the aborigines
were disposed to be troublesome, he should unite all his forces,
attack the village, and clear the whole island of them, so as to
insure our water supply.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the savages appeared armed close to the
station, and made threatening demonstrations as though defying
our men to fight them. Our men immediately prepared to receive
them, marched upon them with bayonets fixed, but without firing;
for the savages fled into their village, where they made a firm
stand, uttering fearful yells.</p>
<p><i>Malou</i>, the chief of the village, who was one of those
with whom we had lived most familiarly, was accompanied by five
or six other chiefs or principal fighting men from other
villages; they were intensely excited, and incited, by their
voices and the movement of their arms, the young fighting men to
advance upon us, but these dared not.</p>
<p>Our men in battle array arrived within pistol shot of the gate
of the village; there they commenced firing, killing six chiefs,
whereupon the whole of the fighting men fled across the village
in order to get to their canoes. The detachment pursued them with
the bayonet, killed about fifty, overthrew some of the others in
the water, and set fire to the village. By this means we became
masters of the island. We merely had one man severely wounded by
a spear which struck him in the upper part of the nose in the
corner of the eye.</p>
<p>After this expedition we re-embarked our forge, our iron, and
our casks, and I had the whole station withdrawn. I then had the
ferns on the island cut down, for fear the savages might hide in
them and surprise us, for they grew six feet high and very thick.
I had the dead savages buried, leaving one hand sticking up out
of the ground in order to let the savages see that we did not eat
our enemies. I had recommended our officers to make an effort to
bring us some savages alive, and to try and catch some young
people of both sexes or children; I had even promised the
soldiers and sailors 50 piastres for every living savage they
might bring me; but the islanders had taken the precaution before
the battle to place their women and children in safety by
carrying them over to the mainland. Our soldiers attempted to
stop and bind such of the wounded as could not flee, but these
wretches were furious and bit like wild beasts, others broke the
cords with which they were bound just as though they were thread,
so that it was not possible for us to secure even one.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the <i>Castries</i> was still wanting
bowsprit and mizenmast, and it was quite out of the question to
go and fetch the beautiful cedar (Kauri pine) masts which we had
found on the mainland, and which had cost us so much infinite
trouble to get out of the forest where we had cut them down. We
therefore rigged up some jury-masts as best we could.</p>
<p>We still wanted seven hundred barrels of water and seventy
cords of firewood for the two vessels, and as we only had one
longboat for this work, we completed it bit by bit in the course
of a month, sending the longboat to the island every day to get
wood and water alternately. The workers were always accompanied
by a detachment which returned on board every night.</p>
<p>One day when the longboat remained longer than usual, the
savages crossed over to the island in large numbers on that side
where they could not be seen. The sentinel posted on a piece of
rising ground saw a man with a hat and dressed like a sailor
approaching him; but this man walked like one who sneaks along
and does not wish to be observed. The sentinel called out to him
to stop, but it was a savage, who, not understanding him,
continued to advance. The sentinel recognized the disguise, fired
and shot the man. Immediately a multitude of savages were seen to
approach; the detachment advanced, chased them, and several which
were killed were found dressed in the clothes of the officers and
sailors they had previously murdered; the rest of the savages
re-embarked in their canoes, and after this useless attempt they
did not again molest us.</p>
<p>From the day on which M. Marion disappeared, we could see from
the vessels every movement of the savages who had retired to the
mountain strongholds; we could clearly distinguish their
sentinels posted on the highest parts, and from whence they
notified to their friends the least of our proceedings. Their
eyes were always turned towards us, and we could distinctly hear
the calls of the sentinels who answered one another with a most
surprisingly powerful voice. During the night they signalled by
means of fires.</p>
<p>When the savages appeared in mobs within gunshot of our
artillery, we now and then fired a cannon ball at them,
especially during the night, in order to let them know that we
were on the alert; but as they always kept out of cannon shot
they never experienced the effect, and it was to be feared that
they would become so emboldened as to despise our artillery.</p>
<p>One of the canoes, in which there were eight or ten men,
passed one day within gunshot of the <i>Castries</i>, which cut
the canoe in two by means of a cannon ball and killed some of the
savages, the others regaining the land by swimming.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile we were not sure of the fate of M. Marion, of
the two officers who accompanied him ashore on the 12th of June,
nor of the fourteen sailors he had taken with him in his gig,
partly to row and partly to draw the seine. We only knew, from
the account of the sailor who had escaped the massacre of the
boatmen the following day, that the eleven men killed in this
horrible treachery had had their stomachs cut open after being
killed, and their bodies quartered and distributed amongst the
savages who had massacred them. The sailor who had been fortunate
enough to escape had observed this horrible scene through the
brushwood, where he had concealed himself.</p>
<p>In order to throw some light on the fate of M. Marion, and on
that of his companions in misfortune, I sent the longboat with
trustworthy officers and a strong detachment to the village of
<i>Tacouri</i>, who the savages told us had killed M. Marion,
where we knew he had been fishing, accompanied by this same
<i>Tacouri</i>, and where we had seen his gig, as well as the
longboat, stranded and surrounded by armed savages. I instructed
the officers to make the most minute search, first of all in the
place where we had seen the stranded boats, and then to enter the
village, to force it if it was defended, to exterminate the
inhabitants, to rummage scrupulously through all their public
buildings and private houses, to pick up whatever they could find
having belonged to M. Marion or to his companions in misfortune,
so as to be able to confirm their death by an official report, to
wind up by setting fire to the village, and by carrying off the
big war canoes which were hauled up at the foot of the village
thereof, or by burning them in case they could not tow them
away.</p>
<p>The longboat left well armed with swivel guns and
blunderbusses, and landed first of all at the place where we had
seen our stranded boats. These were no more, the savages having
burned them in order to extract the iron. The detachment then
marched in good order on to <i>Tacouri's</i> village. Traitors
are cowards in New Zealand the same as elsewhere: Tacouri had
fled: he was seen afar off out of gunshot range, having on his
shoulders M. Marion's mantle, which was made of English cloth of
two colours, scarlet and blue. His village was abandoned, and
only a few old men remained who had not been able to follow their
fugitive comrades, and who were seen sitting quietly in front of
their houses. Our men wished to take them captive. One of them
without appearing to get excited struck one of our soldiers with
a javelin which he had by him. Our men killed him, but no harm
was done to the others, who were left in the village. The men
rummaged all the houses carefully. They found in <i>Tacouri's</i>
kitchen the skull of a man who had only been cooked a few days
before, some pieces of flesh were still hanging on to it, and on
these we could trace the marks of the cannibal's teeth. They also
found a piece of a human thigh fixed to a wooden skewer and
three-parts eaten.</p>
<p>In another house they found the body of a shirt which was
recognized as having belonged to M. Marion. The neck of the shirt
was all bloody and there were three or four blood-bespattered
holes in the side. In other houses they found part of the clothes
and the pistols of young M. de Vaudricourt, who had accompanied
M. Marion on the fatal fishing excursion; finally were found the
arms of the longboat and a heap of rags from the clothes of our
unfortunate sailors.</p>
<p>After having made a thorough visitation of the village and
having collected all the proofs of the assassination of M. Marion
and of his companions, and also the arms and articles abandoned
by the savages, fire was set to the houses and the whole village
reduced to ashes. While this was going on the detachment noticed
that the islanders were leaving a neighbouring village very much
better fortified than the others, belonging to a chief named
<i>Piquioré</i>, who was the accomplice of <i>Tacouri</i>. The
detachment immediately marched on to this village but found it
completely deserted. The houses were visited, and as in the
former village, several articles from our boats and shreds of
clothing from our massacred people were found. Among others in
<i>Piquioré's</i> kitchen they found human entrails, recognized
as such by one of our surgeons, cleaned and cooked. This village
was also reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>On their return our people launched two war canoes and towed
them to the vessel. We took out planks and wood, which might
prove useful; but as we could not take the body on board, which
was about sixty feet long, it was burned.</p>
<p>As soon as we had confirmed the death of M. Marion, we
searched in his papers for any of his plans for the continuation
of the voyage, but we only found some very detailed notes in the
form of instructions from the Governor of the Isle of France,
which, leaving M. Marion to his own operations and researches,
merely indicated the best method of making the observations, of
directing them towards objects which might prove most useful to
our colonies, and generally towards the advancement of human
knowledge.</p>
<p>The two ships' staffs having been assembled, we found that we
had lost our best sailors, that the <i>Castries</i> had but three
anchors, three cables, and her longboat; that the masts of this
vessel, being formed of a collection of small material, could not
have the same strength as if they had been made of suitable
timber; that we had many sick on board; and finally that we had
provisions for eight or nine months only, even supposing that all
we had was in good preservation.</p>
<p>It was in consequence decided by common consent that we should
proceed with our journey in the South Seas according to M.
Marion's intentions; but that, without searching for distant
lands, we should confine ourselves to reconnoitering the islands
of Rotterdam and Amsterdam, where we might procure fresh
provisions, that from thence we should sail for the Iles la
Borne, or Marianne Islands, in order to get to the Philippines,
where we might get a cargo and thence return to the Isle of
France.</p>
<p>This plan being decided upon, we completed our stores of wood
and water; we took possession in the King's name of the Island of
New Zealand, which the Aborigines called <i>Eakénomaouvé</i>, and
which M. Marion had called <i>France Australe</i>; and we
prepared to leave the bay to which M. Marion had given his name,
for he had discovered it in his gig. Captain Cook had called it
on his chart the Bay of Islands, and we named it on leaving
Treachery Bay. It is situated in S. latitude 35° 10' and 174°
longitude to the E. of the meridian of Paris. The magnetic
variation is 12° N.E.</p>
<p>Before leaving New Zealand I shall give an account of my
general observations on the manners of its inhabitants, of which
I have already given some details in the course of this
narrative. I shall then speak of that which I was able to observe
regarding the physical aspect of the country and of the different
products of its soil.</p>

<h4><span class="aa">General Observations on the Manners and
Customs of the Inhabitants of the Northern Portion of New
Zealand.</span></h4>
<p>After what had happened to us, and the investigations we had
made, we could not doubt that the savages of this part of New
Zealand were cannibals. Mr. Cook, the English Captain, who had
visited them shortly before us, learned from them themselves that
they only ate their enemies, and our sailor who had escaped from
the longboat had been the sorrowful witness of the cruelty with
which these aborigines divided amongst themselves the bodies of
those whom they had killed. It is to be presumed that they
regarded as enemies all strangers, even those of their own island
who lived at a distance from their village. This barbarous custom
seems to me common to all savages who are found scattered in the
different corners of the earth; but when I remember the
interesting demonstrations of friendship which these
Australasians had manifested towards us, unaltered for
thirty-three consecutive days, in order to butcher us on the
thirty-fourth, I cannot believe that there can be on the face of
the earth greater traitors than these savages. I can affirm that
not even on the slightest occasion had these savages any reason
to complain of us. The friendship which they showed us was
carried to the extremest familiarity; the chiefs on boarding our
vessels entered our rooms without ceremony, and slept on our
beds, examining all our furniture piece by piece; they asked
about the meanings of our pictures, and of our mirrors, of which
they of course understood nothing. Indeed, they spent whole days
with us with the greatest demonstrations of friendship and of
confidence. Two days before murdering him they had of their free
will proclaimed M. Marion Grand Chief, and on the day on which
they had decided to murder him and his companions, in order to
feast on them afterwards, they brought him some very fine turbots
as a present.</p>
<p>Here then we have a picture of these primitive men, so
extolled by those who do not know them, and who attribute
gratuitously to them more virtues and less vices than possessed
by men whom they are pleased to call artificial, because forsooth
education has perfected their reason. For my part I maintain that
there is amongst all the animals of the creation none more
ferocious and dangerous for human beings than the primitive and
savage man, and I had much rather meet a lion or a tiger, because
I should then know what to do, than one of these men. I speak
according to my experience. Having been occupied with the art of
navigation ever since my childhood, I have never been able to
enjoy that happy ease which permits of those studies and
contemplations by means of which philosophers improve their
minds; but I have traversed the greater part of the globe, and I
have seen everywhere that when reason is not assisted and
perfectioned by good laws, or by a good education, it becomes the
prey of force or of treachery, equally as much so among primitive
men as amongst animals, and I conclude that reason without
culture is but a brutal instinct.</p>
<p>During the whole time that we lived in a sort of confidence
with these primitive men I had endeavoured to study their
characters, and I succeeded in doing so as much as was possible
considering the difficulties we had in understanding each other
through an imperfect vocabulary, of which several words were
different to those in their dialect. I had made myself familiar
with several chiefs and with young and old men, and they had
easily become so towards me. Every day I probed their
inclinations and inquired into the capacity of the lights of
their reason; I understood that they only had a faint idea of a
Supreme Being and of some subsidiary invisible creatures, that
they were somewhat afraid of these latter and prayed frequently
to them, that the object of these prayers was to become the
conquerors and butchers of their enemies, that every family
considered itself independent and stranger to the others, that
they had no other law, no other police, and almost no other
instinct, but that which was necessary for self-preservation.
They were more contented when we gave them sugar, bread or meat
than when we made them presents of useful articles such as axes,
chisels or other implements.</p>
<p>At times I endeavoured to arouse their curiosity. I even
sometimes imitated them in order to discover the workings of
their souls, but I only found wicked children, and all the more
dangerous, for being as they were stronger and even hardier than
the generality of men. Within the space of a quarter of an hour,
I have seen them pass from the most silly joy to the darkest
sorrow, from calmness to fury, and return as suddenly to
immoderate laughter. I have seen them turn and turn about,
sweetly affectionate, hard and threatening, never long in the
same temper, but always dangerous and treacherous.</p>
<p>In accordance with the results of such observations repeated
day after day for thirty-three days, I always mistrusted them and
always noted with the acutest sorrow how M. Marion took these
savages into his confidence, a confidence to which at last he
fell a victim in spite of my most serious representations.</p>
<p>One can easily conceive how it is, that amongst a people like
that of New Zealand, which are in a state of continual warfare,
separated by little doubly palisaded villages surrounded by
ditches, and built on almost inaccessible heights, the fighting
man holds the first place. We did not notice amongst them any
distinction save for the purposes of war. Those only met with
consideration who best knew how to use a tomahawk or to handle
the club or lance.</p>
<p>Only those amongst the fighting men who have committed acts of
ferocity or treason have the right to wear four plumes in their
hair, to tatu the skin of their face, their buttocks, and their
hands, and which is considered amongst them as the highest
distinction. There is no doubt that in order to arrive at the
pre-eminence of such complete tatuing a man must have killed and
eaten many of his fellows.</p>
<br>

"1306431h-images/Pl-5.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>PLATE 5.</small></p>
<br>
<p>When an ordinary man, woman, or child dies, the corpse is
thrown into the sea; but a fighting man is buried, and on the
hillock which covers his corpse spears and javelins are stuck as
trophies.</p>
<p>A country inhabited by a people which only respect the art of
destroying their fellows, cannot be thickly populated, and so it
appeared to me that the interior of the country was uninhabited,
and that a population was only to be found on the coast along the
harbours. At our first anchorage we found a large village
abandoned and destroyed, and although I sometimes climbed high
mountains, in order to get a view of the country, I could only
find dwellings on the sea-coast. A people which frequently fight,
and amongst whom the conqueror eats the conquered, are the most
destructive people that can possibly exist. Nevertheless these
ferocious men love dancing, and their dancing is of the most
lascivious character; they frequently danced on the deck of our
vessels, and they danced so heavily that we were afraid they
would break through the deck. In dancing they sing alternately
warlike and lascivious songs.</p>
<p>The two sexes do not know shame, and although they are half
clothed against the cold, they go about quite naked without
ceremony when they no longer fear it.</p>
<p>The men show great indifference towards the women, and make
them do all the domestic and laborious work. The women collect in
the fields the bundles of fern root pulled up by the men; they
carry water from the foot of the mountains up to the villages;
they alone collect the mussels and other shell-fish on the
sea-shore; they alone do the cooking, prepare the dishes and
serve them to the men without eating with them; they are in fact
in that state of degradation which makes them the servants rather
than the companions of their husbands.</p>
<p>The women in general are not so well made as the men, and no
doubt it is the laborious works to which they are subjected which
makes them thick and misshapen. Nevertheless I did see some young
women who were pretty. They seemed to be good mothers and showed
affection for their offspring. I have often seen them play with
the children, caress them, chew the fern root, pick out the
stringy parts, and then take it out of their mouth in order to
put it into that of their nurslings.</p>
<p>The men were also very fond of and kind to their children. The
chief <i>Tacouri</i> sometimes brought his son on board; he was
about fourteen years of age with a pretty face, and the father
seemed to love him very much.</p>
<p>When their relations die, they mourn for them several days.
Mourning consists in scratching the face and all parts of the
body to express sorrow, in assembling in the house of the defunct
to weep and utter cries of despair, in recounting his deeds and
howling at the end of every account.</p>
<p>On the whole I did not see many children. One has to associate
with them for a long time before one can become acquainted with
their manners, laws and customs. At sight of these big, hardy and
well-made men, one suspects that they do not preserve those
children who are born sickly or deformed.</p>
<p>I noticed that the men and women attain to a great age, that
they preserve up to the most advanced age all their hair, which
does not whiten much, and their teeth are more used up than
spoilt. We did not find any traces showing them to be subject to
small-pox or venereal diseases; they are generally slovenly and
wash but little, but neither pock mark nor cicatrice is to be
seen on their skins. There were, however, amongst our crews
several sailors who suffered from the usual diseases, which they
communicated to the people of the country.</p>
<p>It is no doubt surprising that we should have found at this
comer of the earth, in islands unknown until the present day, and
cut off from all communication with other parts of the globe,
three varieties of man: whites, blacks, and yellows. It is most
certain that the whites are the aborigines. Their colour is
generally speaking like that of the people of Southern Europe,
and I saw several who had red hair.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Amongst
them there were some who were as white as our sailors, and we
often saw on our ships a tall young man five feet eleven inches
high, who by his colour and features might easily have passed for
an European. I saw a girl, fifteen or sixteen years of age, as
white as our French women. Various occurrences in navigation
might have transferred the blacks of New Holland to New Zealand,
which are about 300 leagues distant, but which may not always
have been so far off. New Holland, the largest island we know Of,
has certainly been peopled by the blacks of New Guinea, from
which it is only separated by a strait as broad as a river. These
negroes transported to New Zealand have no doubt allied
themselves with the women of the country, and from these
alliances have no doubt sprung the yellow people we see at the
present day.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> In these cases the red colour of the
hair is probably produced by washing in wood ashes, etc.]</p>
<p>It is to be observed that, in almost all the islands which
extend from Formosa and the Philippines as far as New Zealand in
this great Archipelago, which occupies an area of more than
fifteen hundred leagues in length between the seas of China, the
Indies and Africa, on one side, and those of America on the
other, we find everywhere a prodigious mixture of men of
different colour and cast, whites, especially negroes and the
yellows. The shores of Formosa are inhabited by Chinese, the
interior of the island by half-savage blacks; the shores of Luzon
and the majority of the other Philippine Islands are inhabited by
Malay colonies, and their interiors, the forests and the
mountains, by true wild aborigines. The same holds good of
Borneo, where woolly-headed negroes are found; the same with
regard to the Malaccas, New Guinea, Timor, New Holland, and
finally New Zealand. Perhaps we shall find the same mixture in
the Austral lands which the French and English are this day vying
with each other in their attempts to discover. What is most
singular is that our navigators have quite recently found the
same mixtures even as far as the middle of the South Sea in the
island of Taïty.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was a time when New Zealand communicated with
the island of Taïty, from which it is at present separated by a
sea with no bottom and more than six hundred leagues in extent.
At New Zealand we found the same language as that of Taïty, with
a few differences in a small number of words, and there is much
resemblance between these two peoples so widely separated at the
present day.</p>
<p>I am not disinclined to believe that America was peopled by
New Zealand, the Austral lands and the islands of the South Sea.
I find a striking resemblance amongst the manners and customs of
savages of these different parts of the globe: the same men
almost beardless and cannibals, the same arms, the same utensils,
the same cut of clothes, habitations, and boats; the same
indifference towards the women, the same manner of making them do
all the most laborious work. Those who have a good knowledge of
the languages of these people will perhaps find greater analogy.
The chapter which follows may perhaps give additional evidence in
favour of the conjecture. <sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>

<h4><span class="aa">Physical Observations on New Zealand and on
some of its Natural Productions.</span></h4>
<p>Seamen are generally not sufficiently well educated to be able
to report, in the accounts of their voyages, on the sometimes
very interesting objects they meet with in the countries they
overrun, especially on unknown regions and peoples which they
discover for the first time. To be able to journey usefully one
should have a knowledge of all our arts and a smattering at least
of natural history, and a little of that philosophy so necessary
for studying without prejudice the mind and the opinions of
primitive man, the varieties and the immensity of the works of
creation, and the slow revolutions and even the agitations of
nature in different portions of our planet.</p>
<p>When Captain Cook, who on his corvette has just completed one
of the most interesting voyages ever made since the time of
Magellan, and who, by an astonishing succession of discoveries
and by incredible labour, has merited from his country and the
human race generally the position of being ranked amongst the
most celebrated navigators, was sent by England to the South
Seas, three scientific men, Messrs. Banks, Solander, and Green,
were given him as companions. These three learned men, associated
with the great seaman, have drawn from this splendid but
laborious voyage all that it was possible to do for the
advancement of human knowledge.</p>
<p>When we were despatched from the Isle of France in October,
1771, for the journey of which I am now giving an account, M.
l'Abbé Rochon, of the Academy of Sciences, as well as M.
Commerson,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> a learned naturalist, were to
have started with us. The former had already rendered important
services to navigation by determining the position of several
islands and reefs situated between the Isles of France and
Bourbon and the Coromandel and Malabar coasts; he had also,
conjointly with an officer of great distinction, M. le Chevalier
de Fromelin, ship's captain, his relation and friend, just saved
the vessel <i>Le Berrier</i> from missing the Isle of France by
correcting the ship's reckonings, by means of very precise
longitudinal observations, which reckonings had an error of more
than a hundred leagues, ascribed solely to the currents. The
latter had collected an immense quantity of plants during M. de
Bougainville's voyage round the world. M. Poivre, the Governor of
the Isle of France, had engaged these two scientific men to
accompany us; but fortunately for them this clever and virtuous
administrator, who was ceaselessly occupied with all that which
might contribute to the progress of science and to the advantage
of navigation, was not able to overcome the obstacles which
ultimately prevented their departure&mdash;obstacles which
consisted in another mission which was considered more important.
M. Marion and I were all the more grieved at this as we were
about to open up an absolutely new route for entering into the
South Seas, and an astronomer furnished with good instruments and
with an excellent chronometer by the celebrated Ferdinand
Berthoud,<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> would have made our voyage
infinitely more useful.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Philibert Commerson, a French botanist,
who died at the Isle of France, 1773. There is a curious story
relating to his botanical valet, who followed him round the
world, and who was discovered by the natives of Taïty to be a
woman.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> The chronometer maker, born in
Neuchatel 1725, died at Paris 1807.]</p>
<p>After the partial survey I had made of the productions of New
Holland, and especially of those of New Zealand, I often had
cause to regret that these two learned men had not been able to
embark with us. I feel perfectly sure I have not been able to see
as with their eyes; but encouraged by the hope of indulgence
towards a traveller, who after all is only a seaman, I will
relate ingenuously and in good faith that which has struck me
most.</p>
<p>Having been accustomed during a long succession of voyages in
all parts of the world to read in the great book of Nature, and
to note above all her most striking scenes, I first of all
observed that the mass of the land of New Zealand looked like a
great range of mountains, which might formerly have formed a
portion of some great continent. The various highest peaks of
this range were for the most part covered with snow. On its
western shore there is not the slightest appearance of a
plain&mdash;it is rocky; the land is much broken, without coves,
havens or ports, and appears but little inhabited. From the sea
we could not sight any estuaries.</p>
<p>The eastern coast, which faces the South Sea, is more cut up
with a multitude of islands, bays and harbours, and it seems that
all the rivers coming from the mountains have their course and
run into the sea on this side. One sees plains which look
delicious and appear to be well wooded.</p>
<p>In overrunning this part one finds everywhere volcanic traces,
lava mixed with scoriæ, basalt or compact lava, pumice stone,
blocks of that black glass which is known only to be the result
of volcanic fusion [obsidian], baked earths in a friable form
like tripoli, and others less friable and more mixed. Might not
the subterranean fire, which formerly burned and vitrified so
much matter in New Zealand, have also by several shocks detached
this island from New Holland or from the Austral lands or from
some other continent? According to South Sea travellers all the
lands, which extend from New Zealand from south latitude 47° to
the equator, and from the equator to the north of Japan, and from
thence to the 40° north latitude, are after all only islands, so
that this vast portion of our globe, which extends North and
South for eighteen hundred leagues, resembles a ruin. We find
everywhere traces of extinct or active volcanoes close to one
another. This immense space which bounds our entire planet to the
east and to the south appears to be the abode of fire: it seems
that there Nature has placed her formidable workshops, and her
efforts for ages past have changed and during bur days still
change the face of this part of the earth, make it tremble
without ceasing, break it up by depressions and terrible
explosions, and make it totter under the feet of the unfortunate
inhabitants. It is not without good cause that the islanders of
Taïty and the savages of New Zealand agree in calling the
Divinity the "One who shakes the earth." People so widely
separated and without a knowledge of the art of navigation do not
speak the same language unless they were once the same people and
inhabited perhaps the same continent, of which the volcanic
shocks have only spared us the mountains and their savage
inhabitants, and who by means of their former easy
intercommunication are now mixed black and white. In this great
portion of the earth so long unknown to Europe and so little
known at this day, how many physical revolutions may not have
been occasioned by successive volcanic eruptions? How many
cities, empires, nations, may have disappeared from the face of
the earth and abandoned their abode to the element which now
covers them, like the city of Callao, which was covered and
engulphed by the sea on the night of the 28th October, 1747? We
are assured that on the coast of Peru some years ago a fairly
considerable rock was discovered which is composed of an immense
mass of petrified human bones, as though the sea had formerly
covered a vast cemetery, of which the corpses petrified under the
waters appear to-day in the form of a rock. This fact supports my
conjecture regarding the existence of submerged countries between
New Zealand and Taïty, etc. I shall not be astonished if those
navigators, now occupied with the discovery of an Austral
Continent, should find at the Antarctic Pole nothing but islands,
being the summits of the mountains which have escaped from
volcanic shocks and have been separated from plains which may
formerly have surrounded them. There they will surely find people
absolutely similar to those of New Zealand.</p>
<p>In my wanderings on the land which surrounds the Bay of
Islands I found here and there blocks of white marble, of red
jasper, ideous marble which suggests that there exists in this
island some marine deposit around the nucleus of the ancient rock
of granite, the base of which appears to be gabbro laminated and
more or less black, containing a white substance which is
pulverulent and dull in some, but brilliant and solid in others;
crystallized quartz, firestone, flint, chalcedonic agates,
pebbles crystallized in the interior, others translucent and
similar to those which one finds in India on the Malabar coast.
In the first bay in which we anchored, and where we lost our
anchors, I found a spring of very soft water running out of the
rock, and whose waters appeared to me to be capable of producing
petrifaction. I picked up the remains of a petrified crab, some
pebbles of which the kernel was very hard, and of which the outer
layers folded like leaves had not yet acquired the same hardness,
although of a strong nature.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> I found masses
of flints formed into very large blocks, being bound together by
a hard natural cement.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> Finally we found
everywhere a very beautiful red ochre indicating the ferruginous
nature of the soil.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Probably concretions with concentric
coats shelling off the outside.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> A siliceous conglomerate perhaps like
the well-known Hertfordshire Pudding-stone.]</p>
<p>Although it appears that jade is very common in New Zealand,
for the savages have nearly all tomahawks, chisels, engraved
images, and ear ornaments made thereof, yet I was not able to see
the place where they obtain it; I do not know whether they find
it in the rivers like pebbles or whether Nature has placed it in
quarries.<sup><b>[3]</b></sup> This jade is of a beautiful
semi-transparent green, and of a deeper hue than that of the jade
known to other parts of the world; sparkling pieces are sometimes
found which are of a very pleasing variant colour. The New
Zealanders carve all their implements with jade, which is one of
the hardest stones.<sup><b>[4]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>3</b> It is found in old rocks, probably
metamorphic, on the west coast of South Island.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>4</b> There are plenty of works on the
geology of particular districts of New Zealand. Hochstetter's
Physical Geography, Geology, and Natural History is very good,
but out of date. There is a capital sketch of the Geology of the
Islands in the Handbook of New Zealand, by Sir James Hector, but
it is short; the section on Economic Minerals is fuller. But a
better sketch, entitled Outline of the Geology of New Zealand,
appeared in the Detailed Catalogue and Guide to the Geological
Exhibits (New Zealand Court, Colonial and Indian Exhibition,
1886) by Sir James Hector. It contains a good coloured geological
map, and is regarded as the most convenient work of reference on
the subject.]</p>
<p>The country which surrounds the Bay of Islands is a charming
mixture of plains and slopes, valleys and mountains. Wherever the
country is not covered with forest, it is covered with ferns;
those which grow on the sea-coast and on the mountains are not
much higher than those of France, but those which grow in the
dales and at the foot of the mountains are the large ferns which
the savages prefer on account of their roots, which are as thick
as one's thumb, and which form the basis of their
nourishment.</p>
<p>Their forests contain a fairly large variety of trees, amongst
which I recognized a very beautiful strong-smelling myrtle thirty
to forty feet high, <i>Guaiacum</i> [sic] <i>atherosperma</i>,
and several redwood trees, one of which resembles the
small-leaved <i>bois de nattes à petites feuilles</i> [mysine] of
the Isles of France and Bourbon. We obtained from this good knees
for repairing our vessels. But the tree which prevails most in
all the forests is the olive-leaved cedar [<i>Dammara
australis</i>, the Kauri pine]. I have had cedars of this variety
cut down whose trunks were more than a hundred feet long, from
the ground to the lowest branches, and fifty-two inches in
diameter. The trees are very resinous; the resin is white and
transparent, and gives out an agreeable smell like incense when
burnt. It appeared to me that this cedar is the commonest and
highest tree of the country; its wood is elastic, and I judged it
very suitable for making ships' masts.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> " . . . the famous Kauri pine. I
measured one of these noble trees, and found it thirty-one feet
in circumference above the roots. There was another close by,
which I did not see, thirty-three feet; and I heard of one no
less than forty feet. These trees are remarkable for their smooth
cylindrical boles, which run up to a height of sixty and even
ninety feet, with a nearly equal diameter, and without a single
branch. The crown of branches at the summit is out of all
proportion small to the trunk; and the leaves are likewise small
compared with the branches. The forest was here almost composed
of the Kauri; and the largest trees, from the parallelism of
their sides, stood up like gigantic columns of wood" (Darwin's
Voyage, 24th Dec. 1835).]</p>
<p>In some parts the forests are very free from obstructions, in
others the ground is covered with shrubbery, some of which is
thorny, and with a very common vine which climbs to the top of
the very highest trees.</p>
<p>Although we were in New Zealand in the months of June and
July, which months are the coldest in this southern portion of
the world, I did not see a single tree shed its leaves. The
forests were quite as green as they are in France in the middle
of summer; nevertheless there were occasional light frosts, and
in the morning I have seen the water of the marshes frozen over
to a thickness of two or three lines, but the sun melted this
thin ice within an hour of its rising. I did not see any snow
fall in the plains, but I have noticed it on the highest
mountains. I also noticed that the rains generally came from the
E. and N.E., which is contrary to the direction they come from in
our French climate.</p>
<p>The marshes are full of rushes and of <i>Hibertia</i>(?). On
stony ground, on slopes which are not broken up, we found a
variety of <i>Hoheria</i> in large quantities, from which these
savages extract a very beautiful silken thread, a cyprus-leaved
tithymale [sic] resembling a shrub, different sorts of
<i>Epacris, Solanum, Aviculare</i>, and a very pretty golden
immortelle. In the neighbourhood of the sea we found very tasty
celery, also <i>Oxalis magellanica</i>, a kind of large leaved
water-cress,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> and the same variety of
<i>morel</i> which is eaten in Madagascar and in the Isle of
France. We ate a good deal of these plants, which abound in the
country, and the eating of which had a very salutary effect on
our scurvied people when the good terms on which we lived with
the savages allowed us to gather them every day. The savages
expressed great astonishment at seeing us eat these
herbs.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Water-cress, <i>Nasturtium
officinale</i>, is believed to have been introduced long after
this date.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> For information regarding vegetable
food of New Zealanders, see Colenso on the Vegetable Food of the
Ancient New Zealanders in Transactions New Zealand Institute,
vol. xiii.]</p>
<p>I formed a garden on <i>Moutouaro</i> Island, in which I sowed
the seed of all sorts of vegetables, stones and the pips of our
fruits, wheat, millet, maize, and in fact every variety of grain
which I had brought from the Cape of Good Hope; everything
succeeded admirably, several of the grains sprouted and appeared
above ground, and the wheat especially grew with surprising
vigour.</p>
<p>The soil is excellent for vegetation.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> In
those parts where I was obliged to stir the ground, in making the
road for transporting our masts, I found it to consist of a black
vegetable soil down to a depth of five to six feet, without any
other admixture. At this depth the soil was mixed with small
stones and more especially with small translucent pebbles.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> "New Zealand is favoured by one great
natural advantage: namely, that the inhabitants can never perish
from famine. The whole country abounds with fern; and the roots
of this plant, if not very palatable, yet contain much nutriment.
A native can always subsist on these, and on the shell-fish,
which are abundant on all parts of the sea-coast. . . . The whole
scene, in spite of its green colour, had rather a desolate
aspect. The sight of so much fern impresses the mind with an idea
of sterility: this, however, is not correct; for wherever the
fern grows thick and breast high, the land by tillage becomes
productive" (Darwin's Voyage, 23rd Dec. 1835).]</p>
<p>The garden on <i>Moutouaro</i> Island alone was not sufficient
to satisfy my desires; I planted stones and pips wherever I
went&mdash;in the plains, in the glens, on the slopes, and even
on the mountains; I also sowed everywhere a few of the different
varieties of grain, and most of the officers did the same. We
tried in vain to get the savages to grow some, and explained to
them the use of the wheat, of the other elementary grains and of
the quality of the fruits of which we showed them the stones. But
they had no more mind for this than
brutes.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> "At one place we found a number of
people collected round an object which seemed to attract general
attention, and which they told us, when we entered the circle,
was tabooed. It proved to be a plant of the common English pea,
and had been growing about two months. The seed that produced it
had been found in the <i>Coromandel</i>; it was fenced round with
little sticks, and the greatest care appeared to be taken of it"
(R. A. Cruise, Journal, p. 211).<br>
<br>
"The excellent plants left by Captain Cook, viz. cabbages,
turnips, parsnips, carrots, etc., etc., are still numerous, but
very much degenerated; and a great part of the country is overrun
with cowitch, which the natives gave Marion the credit of having
left among them" (Ibid. p. 315).<br>
<br>
"In many places I noticed several sorts of weeds, which, like the
rats, I was forced to own as countrymen. A leek has overrun whole
districts, and will prove very troublesome, but it was imported
as a favour by a French vessel. The common dock is also widely
disseminated, and will, I fear, for ever remain a proof of the
rascality of an Englishman, who sold the seeds for those of the
tobacco plant" (Darwin's Voyage, 24th Dec. 1835).]</p>
<p>In several places I found very good potters' clay, and our
master gunner, a very ingenious man, rigged up a potter's reel,
on which in the presence of the savages he made several vessels,
porringers and plates, and even baked them under the very eyes of
the savages. Some of his essays succeeded perfectly, and he gave
the articles to the savages who had seen them turned and baked,
but I doubt whether they will profit by such an industry as this,
which would afford them a thousand conveniences.</p>
<p>The only quadrupeds I saw in this country were dogs and rats.
The dogs are a sort of domesticated fox, quite black or white,
very low on the legs, straight ears, thick tail, long body, full
jaws but more pointed than that of the fox, and uttering the same
cry; they do not bark like our dogs. These animals are only fed
on fish, and it appears that the savages only raise them for
food. Some were taken on board our vessels, but it was impossible
to domesticate them like our dogs, they were always treacherous
and bit us frequently. They would have been dangerous to keep
where poultry was raised or had to be protected; they would
destroy them just like true foxes. The rats are of the same
species as those we have in our fields and
forests.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Both dogs and rats were introduced, and
not indigenous to the island. "It is said the common Norway rat,
in the short space of two years, annihilated in this northern end
of the island, the New Zealand species" (Darwin's Voyage, 24th
Dec 1835).]</p>
<p>We had on board our vessels some pigs from the Cape of Good
Hope, some sheep and kids, the sight of which caused the greatest
astonishment to the savages every time they came on board. They
looked upon these animals with the greatest surprise, proving
that they have not the like in their country. They had also never
seen domestic fowls and ducks, and were very much astonished to
see them in the coops. They have absolutely no other domestic
animal than the dog.</p>
<p>In the marshes are found wild duck, teal, and blue fowl
similar to but darker in hue than those of Madagascar, the
Indies, and China. In the forests there are very beautiful wood
pigeons about the size of a pullet, their sparkling blue and gold
plumage is magnificent. These birds make splendid game. In the
same forests are to be found very big parrots with black and
variegated blue and red plumage, lories and a small variety of
the latter with a very beautiful plumage similar to that of the
lories of the island of Gola.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Seven species of duck and eight of
parrots are peculiar to New Zealand.]</p>
<p>The newly discovered lands abound with parson birds,
starlings, pipits, the very common quail with the same plumage as
our own but bigger, native robins of different colours, and birds
like wagtails and wheatears.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> There are no wagtails or wheatears in
New Zealand.]</p>
<p>On the sea-coast one meets with many curlews, snipe,
cormorants, black and white egrets similar to those of France,
and a very beautiful black bird of the size of a sea-snipe, with
bright red beak and feet.<sup><b>[3]</b></sup> With the exception
of the egrets, whose flesh is very dry, all these birds are good
to eat. The <i>envergures</i>, which the sailors call velvet
cuffs, and grey and white gulls, are too dry, tough and oily to
be eaten.<sup><b>[4]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>3</b> Probably the black stilt.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>4</b> For the birds of New Zealand, see Sir
W. L. Buller's Birds of New Zealand, 2 vols. 4to. 1888. A
splendid work.]</p>
<p>From the day of our first landing I noticed that all the birds
of this country were tame and allowed themselves to be approached
so closely that they could be killed with stones and sticks; but
when our young men had fired at them for a few days, the game
became wild, although the savages could still approach closely,
while they fled our sportsmen from afar off.</p>
<p>Fish are very abundant on this coast of New Zealand, and
splendid <i>barbots</i>, mullet, and conger-eels are caught, as
well as incredible quantities of mackerel much bigger than those
from the coasts of France, but very good; many <i>balistes</i> of
various colours, codfish in smaller quantities, two varieties of
red fish like the gurnet which I have not met with elsewhere, and
of which one variety is of about the size of a cod. All these
fish are good to eat. It appears that migratory fish are to be
met with on the coasts at different seasons of the year, and I am
convinced that the fishery must be much more abundant in the
straits which separate the two big islands of this country. In
the rocks which fringe the coasts many lobsters, crabs, and
shellfish of every variety are to be met with and similar to
those which we found in Frederic Henry Bay in Van Diemen's
Land.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>

<p>We found neither penguins nor sea-wolves on this coast. Out at
sea at some distance from the land many whales and white
porpoises were seen, all of which could be hunted.</p>

<h4><span class="aa">Departure from New Zealand, Continuation of
the Voyage in the South Seas.</span></h4>
<p>On the 14th July we left Treachery Bay, named Bay of Islands
on the chart by Captain Cook, and steered in a north-easterly
direction into the South Sea. The wind was in the S.E. From the
16th to the 21st of July the wind varied from N.E. to N.W., and
we experienced violent winds and a very heavy sea. Up to the 25th
the wind blew from the S.W. We found the winds variable and often
contrary until we had crossed the tropic of Capricorn. We then
met with a clear sky and calm sea and wind from the S.E. to E.
Having arrived at 20° S. latitude and longitude 185° E. of Paris,
we directed our course towards the east in search of the islands
Rotterdam and Amsterdam, which are marked on the chart in the
same latitude. We navigated with the greatest care in order not
to pass these islands in the night. On the 6th of August we saw
land ahead of us and approached it to within two leagues. The
coast seemed fringed with breakers. We saw clearly a chain of
low-lying islands, which looked like beds of broken coral, on
which Nature had planted a few coco-nut palms; the wind and
current forced us on to the coast, but we searched in vain for an
anchorage, the weather being bad and the sea rough. We stood off
for the night, proposing to return in the morning and look for a
roadstead.</p>
<p>On examining the excellent work of President de
Brosses,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> which I always had near me, I
understood that the islands before us were not those of Rotterdam
and Amsterdam which we were in search of, but a chain of coral
islands to the north of the said islands. Having sounded several
times without finding bottom, I changed the course for the north.
When we were in sight of these rocks, we were in latitude 20° 9'
S., and our longitude by reckoning was 182° E. of Paris, the
variation being 11° 45' N.E. The islands of Rotterdam and
Amsterdam should be placed in latitude 21° 80' as indicated on
the chart.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Charles de Brosses, 1709-1777. The
first President of the Bourgogne Parliament, and a well-known
historian. The work referred to here is his <i>Histoire des
navigations aux Terres Australes</i>, 2 vols. 4to. Paris,
1756.]</p>
<p>In going north, we observed at daybreak on the 12th of August
an island which I have not found on any chart, and I named it
<i>Ile du point du jour</i> (Daybreak Island). It appeared to me
an arid, steep, mountainous peak, surrounded by rocks, more
especially on the south side, where they look very much like
boats. I calculated it to be about five leagues in circumference.
It is situated in 16° S. latitude, and according to our reckoning
182° 30' E. of Paris. On passing the island I found magnetic
variation to be 8° 30' N.E.</p>
<p>The sight of this island did not cause us to deviate from our
course. We had the finest of weather, with the wind E.S.E. On the
23rd August we crossed the line at 176° 43' E. longitude. From
this point to the 8° N. latitude the variation was 10° to the
N.E. The wind blew continuously from the S.E. From the time we
saw the last islands we unceasingly met with land birds.</p>
<p>After the 28th of August, from N. latitude 8° to 13°, the wind
veered about from W. to N. and to S.E. We now had very little
wind, and the scurvy was playing havoc with our sailors, few
being left in a state fit to work. This disease had made its
appearance when we entered the tropics and had since then made
rapid progress.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of September we changed our course to the W., the
wind being constant from N.E. to E. We had rain occasionally, and
continued to meet with indications of the neighbourhood of land
until we sighted the island of Guam, the largest of the Marianne
Islands,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> on the 20th of September 1772, and
where we anchored on the 27th of the same month.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> So named in 1668, after Maria Anna of
Austria, widow of Philip IV. of Spain. Magellan, who discovered
the islands on 6th March, 1521, called them the Islas de los
Ladrones, on account of the thieving propensities of the natives,
who were, however, probably not worse in this respect than most
of the Pacific islanders. This group has been frequently
described, and amongst other voyagers who visited it were
Cavendish, 1588; Dampier, 1686 and 1705; Wallis, 1768; and
Freycinet in 1829 (Voyage autour du Monde, Paris, 4to. vol. ii.
part i. Historique). Dumont D'Urville visited it in 1828 and
1838. The Marianne islanders are Malayo-Polynesians, and skulls
dug out of an ancient burial-ground on Guam show the same
characteristics as those of the present aborigines (see
Quatrefages and Hamy: Crania Ethnica, p. 455).]</p>

<h3>ANCHORAGE AT THE ISLAND OF GUAM.</h3>

<h4><span class="aa">Description of the Country, and of the
Spanish Colony there.</span></h4>
<p>We were much thwarted by winds on our land-fall at the island
of Guam. After having beat to windward several days, the pilots
came on board and steered us into the port, where we anchored in
twenty fathoms on a mud bottom, the surface of which is covered
with broken shells.</p>
<p>The harbour is situated on the western side, and almost in the
middle of the island. It is bounded on the south by a tongue of
land running two leagues out into the sea, and on the north by a
reef of similar length, which almost surrounds it. The entrance
is very narrow, and protected by a brick battery, which the
Spaniards call St. Louis, mounted with eight bronze
twelve-pounders of an old pattern. The harbour is capable of
holding four vessels, sheltered from all winds except those from
the south-east, which never blow but feebly in these parts. It is
dangerous to enter without pilots, because of the numerous rocks
and coral reefs. It is situated in N. latitude 13° 26', and
longitude 141° 30' E. of Paris; the magnetic variation being 70°
N.E.</p>

<br>
<small>PLATE 6.</small></p>
<br>
<p>The chief settlement, which the Spaniards call the town of
Agana, is situated four leagues to the north of the harbour on
the sea-coast, at the foot of some low mountains, in a beautiful
country full of springs, and watered by a small, very clear, and
good brook. The Commandant of the island lives there. The streets
of the town are laid out in straight lines, the private houses
are for the most part built solidly of wood, raised on piles,
about three feet above the level of the ground, and most of them
are roofed with shingles, or with tiles, the rest with palm
leaves. There is a beautiful church highly decorated according to
Spanish custom. The Commandant's house is spacious and well
built. The former residence of the Jesuits, now occupied by the
St. Augustine brotherhood, is spacious and convenient; but the
former Jesuits' College, built for the education of the Indians,
is not inhabited, their successors, the St. Augustines, having
removed the college to a building near their convent. There is a
barracks capable of lodging a garrison of five hundred men, and
there is the King's fine large magazine. All these public
buildings are built of brick and tile. The island of Guam is the
only island in the vast extent of the South Sea, sprinkled as it
is with innumerable islands, which has a European built town, a
church, fortifications, and a civilized population.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the town of Agana, we were received with a
great deal of civility by M. Tobias, the Commandant. We explained
to him that our crews were suffering from scurvy, and I asked him
for help, which was all the more pressing, as on our arrival we
had not more than fifteen men fit for duty in both vessels
together. This honourable and humane Commandant began by sending
on board a quantity of provisions consisting of fresh meat,
vegetables, and fruits, especially of oranges and citrons. He
gave up to our use the former Jesuits' College, he even allowed
us to station a guard to keep order, and he very civilly insisted
that the officers of the two vessels should, during our stay at
his island, make use of no other table than his own. We accepted
with pleasure such very generous offers, which were made with the
best possible grace. We had our unfortunate scurvy-stricken
fellows brought on shore, and only left sufficient men in the
vessels as were absolutely necessary for guarding them, and M.
Tobias moreover furnished both vessels gratuitously with
twenty-five Indians each as servants. With the abundant help we
thus received from M. Tobias our sailors recovered rapidly.</p>
<p>In the whole extent of these seas there is no other harbour
where weary navigators can re-establish their health more quickly
or where they can obtain better or more abundant refreshment. The
island of Guam appeared a terrestrial paradise to us; the air was
excellent, the water was very good, the vegetables and fruits
perfect, the mobs of cattle as well as those of goats and pigs
innumerable, while there was no end to the quantity of
poultry.</p>
<p>However, things were not always so plentiful in Guam. When
Magellan discovered it in 1521, together with eight other
important islands lying to the north,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> and a
multitude of very much smaller islands, forming the little
archipelago known first of all as the Ladrones and afterwards as
the Mariannes Group, these islands, which were thickly inhabited,
could only offer fish, bananas, coco-nuts, and breadfruit as
refreshments to travellers, and these were only procurable by
means of force against the arrows and blades of their savage
inhabitants. The Spaniards brought from America the first stock
of animals, of every variety of poultry, of the plants or
fruit-seeds, as well as of the vegetables we find at the present
day.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> When Magellan departed from Guam on the
9th March, Master Andrew, of Bristol, the only Englishman in his
fleet, died there (Guillemard's Life of Ferd. Magellan, London,
1890, p. 226).]</p>
<p>But this abundance, due to the care and genius of Europeans,
has cost humanity very dear. The Ladrones, and especially Guam,
were thickly populated when discovered, and it is said that on
the shores of Guam alone 20,000 inhabitants could be counted.
These men were wild savages, and, like all the islanders of the
South Sea, owing to the fact that they did not recognize any
rights of property, they were great
thieves.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The Marianne Islanders were perhaps not
more given to petty pilfering from strangers than most of the
South Sea Islanders. Cook had great trouble with regard to
pilfering throughout his cruises, and La Perouse was not more
fortunate, especially at Easter Island.]</p>
<p>But they were so savage and so incapable of supporting the
yoke of civilization that the Spainards who undertook to subdue
them so as to make Christians of them saw their population
annihilate itself so to speak within the course of two centuries.
Under the reign of their missionaries the wild islanders were
finally obliged to give way to the superiority of Spanish arms,
and after having for a long time defended by cruel wars their
right to exist like savage beasts, according to their free
instinct, they gave themselves up to a despair of which there is
no other example on the face of the earth. They induced their
women to take drinks which caused abortion and to have no more
children, rather than to leave behind them children who,
according to the ideas of liberty entertained by these savage
beings, would no longer be free. Such violent resolves, so
contrary to the wishes of Nature, were followed up by a
stubbornness in the nine Marianne Islands sufficient to reduce
the population of the whole archipelago, which was 60,000 at the
time of the discovery, to eight or nine hundred souls. About
twenty years ago the scattered remnants of this population were
gathered together by the Spaniards on to the island of Guam,
where, during the last few years, by means of wise although tardy
precautions of a Government perhaps best adapted to the climate
of these islands and to the genius of the people, the population
has commenced to increase.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> It was not until 1695 that the
islanders were finally subdued by the Spaniards and nominally
converted to Christianity. They seem to have made a plucky
resistance. A good account of the islands, of the customs and
arts of the aborigines, and of the wars which led to their
subjection, is to be found in the Histoire des Iles Marianes,
12mo. 433 pp. Paris, 1700, by Chas. Le Gobien, S.J., the great
Chinese missionary.]</p>
<p>The present remains of the former great population are
descended from those Indians who, having attached themselves to
the service of the Spaniards and especially to that of the
missionaries, have allowed themselves to be domesticated by the
mildness of the present government. All the others have
disappeared without leaving any posterity.</p>
<p>The present population consists of about fifteen hundred
Indians, They are happy under the government of a wise man, who
has the good sense to see that religion is given to man for his
happiness, even on earth, and not for his annoyance. It was with
the greatest satisfaction that I saw this worthy and honourable
man's only care was for the good of his island and that he never
showed his authority except for the benefit of the Indians who
serve him. Under such a Commandant even the monks appeared
tolerant to me. The five or six Spaniards who have various
subordinate posts under the chief conform perfectly to his
views.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Anson's account of the Ladrones or
Marianne Islands, where he landed in 1742, on Tinian Island,
runs: "They were formerly most of them well inhabited, and, even
not sixty years ago, the three principal islands Guam, Rota, and
Tinian together, are said to have contained above fifty thousand
people. But since that time Tinian hath been entirely
depopulated, and only two or three hundred Indians have been left
at Rota, to cultivate for the island of Guam; so that now no more
than Guam can properly be said to be inhabited. This island of
Guam is the only settlement of the Spaniards; here they keep a
Governor and garrison, and here the Manilla ship generally
touches for refreshment in her passage from Acapulco to the
Philippines. It is estimated to be about thirty leagues in
circumference, and contains by the Spanish accounts near four
thousand inhabitants, of which a thousand are said to live in the
city of San Ignatio de Agana, where the Governor generally
resides, and where the houses are represented as considerable,
being built with stone and timber and covered with tiles, a very
uncommon fabric for these warm climates and savage countries.
Besides this city, there are upon the islands thirteen or
fourteen villages. As this is a post of some consequence on
account of the refreshment it yields to the Manilla ship, there
are two castles on the sea-shore: one is the Castle of St.
Angelo, which lies near the road, where the Manilla ship usually
anchors, and is but an insignificant fortress, mounting only five
guns, eight-pounders; the other is the Castle of St. Louis, which
is N. E. from St. Angelo, and four leagues distant, and is
intended to protect the road where a small vessel anchors, which
arrives here every other year, from Manilla. This fort mounts the
same number of guns as the former. And besides these forts, there
is a battery of five pieces of cannon on an eminence near the
sea-shore. The Spanish troops employed on this island consist of
three companies of foot, from forty to fifty men each; and this
is the principal strength the Governor has to depend on; for he
cannot rely on any assistance from the Indian inhabitants, being
generally upon ill terms with them, and so apprehensive of them,
that he has debarred them the use of fire-arms or lances." He
complains that there are no good roadsteads at these islands
(Anson's Voyage, London, 4to. 1748, pp. 337, 338).]</p>
<p>The greatest order reigns in Agana, and the country is really
a delightful abode. Besides Agana there are twenty-one small
Indian settlements round the islands, all on the sea-coast, and
composed of five or six families each, who cultivate grain crops
and vegetables, and occupy themselves with fishing.</p>
<p>The centre of the island still lies in its virgin state. The
trees are not very high, but they are suitable for the building
of houses and boats. The forests generally are very dense. Long
ago the Spaniards cleared spaces of land for pastoral purposes.
No other nation possessing colonies in the tropics appears to
have laid themselves out like the Spaniards for the formation of
savannahs. The whole art of this rural operation consists in
making small clearings, which are only separated from each other
by bushes and clumps of trees, simply cleared and cleaned of
every variety of underwood. The Spaniards sow the clearings with
varieties of grass seeds suitable for pasturage.</p>
<p>These savannahs, being shaded on all sides, always retain
their freshness, and give shelter to the cattle against the sun
and the great heat of the day. Vast prairies entirely cleared are
not a success in the Torrid Zone, and cattle transferred from a
colder climate only find the pasturage hard and burned by the
power of the sun, being without any shade; and in cases where
they are not able to rest during the greater heat of the day,
they infallibly perish.</p>
<p>The cattle formerly transported from America to the savannahs
of Guam and the other Ladrone Islands have multiplied without
end. These animals have run wild, and now, when one wishes to eat
them, one has either to shoot them or take them by lassooing. I
noticed that the Guam cattle are generally white, with black
ears, without any variety of colour, but with big frames and well
nourished, and their flesh is very good to eat.</p>
<p>The forests are also full of goats, pigs, and poultry, of
which the first stock was brought over by the Spaniards. All
these animals have run wild, and can only be obtained by shooting
or running them down, or by lassooing. Their flesh is
excellent.</p>
<p>Some time ago, M. Tobias brought over from the Philippines
some stags and hinds, which have begun to multiply in the forest.
These deer are as big as ours, but their coat is different. In
Guam, from the month of December to May, the deer has a very
long, thick, and grey coat; the hair is very thick round the neck
of the animal, and forms a sort of hanging cravatte. In the month
of May the deer puts on its summer coat, which is utterly
different from that borne in winter. The hair is then
fawn-coloured and almost yellow, smooth, and brilliant; there are
three black stripes on its back, between which there are white
stars, and one would say that it is not the same animal.</p>
<p>On the cleared lands and even in the interior of the forests
an extraordinary quantity of turtle-doves, parrots, thrushes and
blackbirds are met with.</p>
<p>Amongst the indigenous trees of the country one notices
especially the coco-nut and the breadfruit trees. I observed
three varieties of coco-nut palms: firstly the big common coconut
palm similar to that which is found throughout the Indies, whose
fruit furnishes a very pleasant, refreshing, anti-scorbutic milk,
and spirit, oil, and a strong thread suitable for making Up into
twine, and even into ship's cables. Secondly the coco-nut palm,
which may be called of medium size, because it does not grow so
high as the other one, and whose nut, deprived of its fibrous
husk and tender shell, is eaten like the heart of the artichoke,
which it resembles. Finally, the black coco-nut, which does not
grow above eight or ten feet high at most, although it grows much
quicker than the common coco-nut palm, and the fruit of which is
perfectly round and of the size of a six-pounder cannon ball; the
flesh of this nut is much thicker and more delicate than that of
the common coco-nut; spirit, oil, and thread are made from it in
greater quantities than the others. The leaves of all three
coco-nut palms are equally suitable for thatching houses and
making mats.</p>
<p>The breadfruit tree is one of the most beautiful vegetable
productions of Nature. It is a tall tree, of which the strong
trunk grows straight upwards; its bark is perfectly smooth like
that of our beeches. The branches do not start from the trunk
until about the height of ten or twelve feet; they grow
alternately, as do also the leaves. These leaves are generally
eighteen inches to two feet long, very deeply indented like those
of our French fig trees; they are stiff, thick, and of a very
beautiful green, and form excellent food for cattle. With such a
foliage the breadfruit tree affords the most perfect shelter. The
fruit grows on the branches from the axil of the leaves, and
attains the size of a <i>cantaloupe</i> melon, but more oval, and
generally eight to ten inches long; it has a stalk proportioned
to its size, and exactly resembles the jackfruit, which is known
to all those who have journeyed to the Indies. Like the jackfruit
it is covered with a thick skin, which is somewhat thorny, but of
which the points are coarse, short, and blunted; its flower also
resembles that of the jackfruit, but its pulp is different. That
of the breadfruit tree is farinaceous, and of a taste which
pleases all, even of those who eat it for the first
time.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> This fruit is one of the most useful
presents which Nature has given to man, and it seems
extraordinary that Nature should only have placed the tree which
produces it in the islands of the South Seas. It tastes exactly
like bread, has the same nutritive properties, supplies its place
in every respect, and has a fragrant and delicious odour which
our cleverest bakers will never be able to impart to our
bread.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> This account of the flavour of the
breadfruit is exaggerated. Capt. Cook found it insipid.]</p>
<p>It is consequently very pleasant for the fortunate inhabitant
of these islands, to be assured of his daily bread; to nourish
himself he has only to cull it and eat it, and that too without
any of the troubles attaching to ploughing the field, sowing the
grain, hoeing, harvesting, threshing, winnowing, grinding,
kneading, or baking.</p>
<p>The fruit can be eaten when it has attained its full size, but
though it be still green. In this stage the islanders cook it
before eating; they take off its knotty rind and cut it in slices
like pieces of bread. When they wish to preserve it, they cut it
in round slices, and in this very thin sea-biscuit form they dry
it in the sun or in the oven. This natural biscuit preserves its
quality for years, and very much better than does our ships'
biscuit. Our sailors ate it green, slightly grilled; they also
made their soup of it; they had no other bread, and we attributed
the quick recovery of those suffering from scurvy to the
breadfruit diet. To this diet the inhabitants have always
attributed anti-scorbutic properties.</p>
<p>When this fruit is ripe, it becomes yellow and soft, its odour
is more fragrant, but it loses its farinaceous taste and becomes
insipid. At this stage it has no longer the same properties as
before; it is now laxative and heating; its pulp no longer takes
the place of bread, and it has little to recommend it. Some of
the breadfruit trees bear the male fruit and the others bear
female fruit. In the latter, which are rare, the seed consists of
shell-less stones enveloped in a simple almost cylindrical
pellicle of about the size of a chestnut but longer. When ripe
these stones make up for the uselessness of the pulp; they are
cooked and eaten like chestnuts, having the same taste.</p>
<p>As the male breadfruit tree is the most useful, but has no
seed, it is propagated by the Indians by making slight incisions
in the roots, from which shoots spring up; these are transplanted
together with a piece of the original root which has produced
them.</p>
<p>It is very desirable that such a very useful tree should
spread all over the earth. That there were some already in the
Isle of France I knew well, thanks to M. Poivre, who during his
administration collected with the greatest success all the most
useful productions from the four comers of the globe. But as I
was desirous of making common property of, and of multiplying as
quickly as possible, such a very precious tree, I determined to
fill a case of these plants in Guam and so to transport more to
the Isle of France, thus placing the Governors in a position to
encourage its planting in our other colonies, where the
breadfruit tree alone without cultivation might furnish a very
good food-substance, at least to our unhappy slaves. But I did
not succeed as I had desired, and all but two of the plants
perished.</p>
<p>The forests of Guam are full of guavas, several varieties of
bananas, citrons, lemons, sweet, bitter and mandarin oranges, and
breadfruits. The fruit of all these trees, which I presume are
not indigenous to the island, but have been introduced by the
Spaniards, are now-a-days so plentiful that they only cost the
trouble of picking, and one finds them everywhere.</p>
<p>The sea-coast and the skirts of the forests are covered with a
large variety of the caper tree. These small trees are indigenous
to the soil. The Spaniards assure me that the nine Ladrone
Islands were full of them when discovered, and that, like the
breadfruit tree, they have been transplanted from here to the
Philippines. Like the citrons, orange trees, and several other
indigenous shrubs, these caper bushes flower all the year round,
forming ravishing scenes; they exhale a pleasant odour, which
makes a walk in the fields and in the forests very delicious.</p>
<p>Bananas are found throughout the world between the tropics and
as far as the Cape of Good Hope in latitude 33° S. As several
travellers have described them and their varieties, I will not
repeat the descriptions here, but I noticed at Guam two varieties
which deserve attention, and which I believe are peculiar to the
Marianne Islands as well as to the Philippines, where the
Spaniards assure me they have them also.</p>
<p>The first species is a dwarf banana, which does not grow
higher than three feet; in its leaves, which are in proportion to
its height, as well as in the substance of its trunk and in its
flower, it resembles the generality of all banana trees, but its
fruit is different, and very superior in taste to all the bananas
known in other parts of the world. It produces a very thick
perfectly round stalk, carrying five or six hundred fruits
pressed closely together, every fruit about the size of an almost
round nut, and covered with a very fine skin which yellows or
reddens in ripening, for it is of either colour, and which is
easily separated from the enclosed pulp. This fruit has not the
fault common to other bananas of being clammy or dry; it is
watery, with a very delicious taste, slightly acid, and scented.
It is very superior, even to the little yellow banana known in
the East Indies as the <i>Gengi</i> fig, which is truly delicate,
but the one of which I am now speaking is beyond compare the best
banana that I have ever eaten. This excellent fruit ought
certainly to be transplanted into all our tropical colonies, and
it certainly deserves the preference to all other varieties of
banana, quite as much for its diminutiveness as for the
excellence of its fruit, and should be cultivated in our
hot-houses, where until now only the bad variety has been grown,
and the fruit of which is not even eaten there where Nature
originally placed it.</p>
<p>The second species is a wild variety, which grows taller than
any of the others, and of which the trunk is thicker, it has also
a more uncultivated appearance. Its leaves and flowers resemble
those of all bananas, and its fruit is not edible, being nothing
more than a mass of grain bound together by a very poor pulp
which has a sharp and disagreeable taste. The trunk of this wild
banana is of the greatest use to those who cut it down and steep
it, on account of the quantity of thread which it furnishes. The
entire trunk consists of nothing more than a mass of very long
and strong threads, and of which the Indians make cloth, cord,
and even cables for the galleons of
Acapulco.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> This wild banana is locally called
abaca. The Spaniards, who have put such cables to the proof,
maintain that, the thickness being equal, they are stronger than
the hempen European cables, and resist the action of wind and
salt-water better, especially for the bow anchor. This variety of
banana has already been largely propagated at the Isle of France,
and deserves to be transplanted to all our colonies. It is well
known that bananas can be propagated without end and without
cultivation. The <i>abaca</i> multiplies still more rapidly, and
every trunk one year old gives ten to twelve pounds of thread
suitable for making into rope.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Acapul[c]o, a beautiful land-locked
harbour in Mexico (N. lat. 16° 50', W. long. 99° 52'), which for
many years after its discovery was the point of annual departure
of the Spanish Treasure Fleet to the Philippines. Although for a
time it fell into decay, it still remains an important port on
the Pacific coast of America.]</p>
<p>The rivers of Guam, which after all are only brooks, or
torrents, abound in fish. During their convalescence, our sailors
amused themselves by fishing, and caught eels, mullets, gobys,
and a sort of carp. All these fish are excellent, but the Indians
do not eat them, preferring salt-water fish, which are generally
very inferior in quality to the fresh-water ones. It is true that
the abundance of meat, vegetables, and fruit is so great in Guam,
and the Spanish Commandant provided us with them so generously,
that during the whole stay we hardly thought of getting any
sea-fish.</p>
<p>There is, besides, some inconvenience in a preference for
salt-water fish. Among those which are caught on the coast of
Guam, as in all the Marianne Islands, there are some which are
very unwholesome, for they nourish themselves on the little
polypes, which form the coral. It appears that these sea-insects,
like the sea-galleys and sea-nettles, have some caustic property
which is imparted to the fishes, and the fishes have a coralline
taste which betrays their poisonous properties. The Indians know
which are unwholesome, but it is better not to eat any sea-fish
at all. This, however, does not hold good with the sea-turtles
which are caught on the coasts of Guam. They are very good and as
big as those of the island of Ascension, but the Spaniards and
Indians do not eat them. I collected sufficient to form a good
supply during our journey to the Philippines.</p>

<h4><span class="aa">The Agriculture and Arts of the Guam
Indians.</span></h4>
<p>Before the arrival of M. Tobias, the Indians did not occupy
themselves with any sort of cultivation on a large scale, for the
galleons brought thither the requisite flour for the bread of the
missionaries and of the garrison; but the Jesuits, who were in
charge of the mission, cultivated a few fruit trees and
vegetables, while the Indians lived on breadfruit and
sea-fish.</p>
<p>The new Commandant, believing that one of the best measures
for re-establishing the almost annihilated population of the
Mariannes, reduced to a mere handful of inhabitants collected
together at Guam, would be by making the little colony into an
agricultural one, introduced the cultivation of rice, maize,
indigo, cotton, cacao, and sugar cane, all of which have
succeeded very well. The cultivation of maize especially gives
incredible results. It is common to find on the maize fields
plants twelve feet high, with eight to ten cobs, nine to ten
inches long, well stocked with good nourishing grain. The Indian
reduces the maize to flour and makes bread of it.</p>
<p>M. Tobias has also established cotton mills and salt pans on
his island; in a word, he has awakened industry in this little
people, whom he could not better civilize than by procuring them
new gratifications and wants and tastes for industry.</p>
<p>His views have led him to establish a public free school for
the Indian children, where they are taught reading, writing, and
arithmetic, and vocal and instrumental music. There is a school
for the boys and a separate one for the girls. It was always a
new and pleasant surprise to us when we attended divine service
on Sundays and holidays to find the church full of musicians, and
to hear all the instruments in tune and time.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of this wise man all the Indians have
become agriculturists. Every family has its property, which is
divided into gardens, orchards, and ploughed or spade-worked
fields. Every variety of European vegetables, especially
delicious melons, and the very refreshing water-melons, are found
in these gardens. Ships wishing to provision will find cabbages
and gourds in very large quantities.</p>
<p>The orchards are full of mangoes and pine apples, and every
fruit tree of which I have spoken is to be found in the fields
and right up into the forests; but the cultivated trees give the
best and most abundant fruit, especially as regards the mangoes,
which have been brought from Manilla, and are of a very superior
quality. The mango is one of the best fruits in the world and one
can eat many of them without being inconvenienced!</p>
<p>In order to set the example in agricultural matters the
Commandant has himself laid out some very pleasant gardens; he
has had avenues of coco-nut palms and breadfruit trees four deep
planted along the sea-shore round the town, and in public spaces,
and these avenues have made Agana an enchanting place.</p>
<p>To facilitate work in connection with cultivation and land
transport, the Government has built good roads and has imported
horses from Manilla, and donkeys and even mules from Acapulco.
The Indians have been taught to break-in cattle and to use them
as draughts, and as the variety of cattle are big and strong,
they make very fine teams. The Indians have more particularly
succeeded in accustoming the cattle to carry them, the same as
horses do, and there are no Indians who have not several riding
beasts on which they ride when making a journey into the interior
of the islands and on whom they saddle their baggage. In their
method of breaking-in they follow the Malabar custom; they pierce
the nostril of the beast and pass the end of a cord through it,
and by means of this cord, to which the cattle get accustomed in
a fortnight, they are led about as easily as horses by their
bridles.</p>
<p>The art of cultivation in its turn causes the birth of the art
of the smith, of the wheelwright, of the joiner and carpenter.
The Indians of Guam have learnt all these trades and follow them
with great skill; they make bricks and lime, and are even good
masons.</p>
<p>In establishing the useful arts on his island M. Tobias has
not neglected that particular one which is unfortunately
necessary for safety and defence: and he has formed an Indian
militia two hundred strong, which wears a uniform and is well
paid. The militiamen are under the command of four Spanish
captains. The other officers are mostly mestizos and Indians from
the Philippines. I thought these troops performed their duties
well; but the Commandant, regarding indolence as one of the
greatest disadvantages of life, has continued his men as
cultivators without in the least interfering with their daily
duties, employing them in cultivating certain lands which he has
divided off under the title of Royal Demesnes. The soldiers thus
plough, sow, and harvest the lands, the produce of which serves
to nourish them, and being thus always occupied, they are happy
and well contented with the rice, or the bread made from the
maize, which they have themselves cultivated and harvested.</p>
<p>In acquiring new knowledge by their contact with civilization,
the islanders have at the same time preserved perfectly the art
of making canoes received from their forefathers. In this respect
they had nothing new to learn. It is quite certain that the
invention of the form of their craft would do honour to any
boatbuilder amongst the most advanced maritime people. This form
has not been copied from any model, for it differs from all those
which have been given to sea-going vessels by any of the known
peoples in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>The Indians being of one nationality, but divided up amongst
nine very thickly populated islands, and separated from one
another by considerable distances within an extent of about six
degrees, naturally require good boats wherewith to
inter-communicate. As the islands are situated in a row running
north and south, and as the wind blows from the east almost all
the year round, it is an advantage that their boats should have
no stern. Their boats are therefore built with bows at each end,
so that they never require to be turned round, The prevailing
winds blow sometimes very violently in squalls, and the islanders
have found out how to provide against this inconvenience, for
they furnish their boats with outriggers, which will uphold them
against the stiffest breezes and the biggest waves. These canoes,
always having the wind on one side, are built flat on that, the
windward, side and rounding on the lee side, which, being more
under water, requires a more suitable surface for cutting through
the water. The mast is never placed in the middle of the boat,
but on the curved lee side, so that the mast is, so to speak,
between the boat and the outrigger. The weight of the mast thus
causes the side to list, and with all the more ease, since the
windward side of the boat being flat offers less resistance.
Nothing is so simple or so well devised as these boats, which the
Indians call <i>proas</i>.</p>
<p>The outrigger is composed of four pieces of wood, built oblong
in form, and of which the longest side is set parallel with the
round side of the boat. At the beam ends of the outrigger is
fixed a large piece of very light wood cut in the shape of a
canoe. This piece of wood floats on the water and opposes such
resistance to the efforts of the strongest breezes as to prevent
the upsetting of the boat; the arms of the outrigger are fixed at
right angles into the upper planks of the boat, and strongly tied
on to the planks on the windward side. Three pieces of wood cross
the framework and make it firmer, and two other longer pieces
which cross the framework transversely, that is, parallel with
the boat and its outrigger, help to bind the whole firmly
together. A narrow plank is placed along the lee rail to prevent
the water entering the boat, and fixes still more securely in
their position the arms of the outrigger, which it does by
covering its whole length.</p>
<p>On the arms of the outrigger and partly on the lee rail, the
Indians rig up a platform, which is again a source of strength,
and acts as a sort of counter-weight to the boat. The boatmen and
the passengers sit on this platform and the cargo is placed
there.</p>
<p>The mast is of bamboo and is consequently very light. It is
let into a socket on the lee side of the bottom of the boat. Two
stays from each end of the boat keep it in its place, a shroud
holds it on the windward side and another on the leeward side;
the latter is lashed to the framework of the outrigger, and the
mast is further shored up by a bamboo fixed in the middle of the
outrigger.</p>
<p>The boat is furnished with a triangular mat sail, furnished
with a yard and boom. The boom is supported at its base in the
boat by a semicircular socket; there is one of these at either
end of the boat. When the Indians, troubled by contrary winds,
wish to tack about, they run the end of the boom along the flat
side of the boat, and fix it in the opposite socket at the other
end; then in changing the boom, end for end, the stern of the
boat becomes its prow, and the tack is accomplished. When the
wind is too strong and the Indians wish to shorten sail, they
simply roll it round the boom, and so diminish the exposed
surface.</p>
<p>The boat I observed was forty feet long by three broad; the
bottom was made of a single hollow tree, in the form of a big
canoe; its sides raised a couple of inches by means of planks and
sewn together with bark of trees and caulked with a mixture of
coco-nut oil and quicklime. Their sides were joined by
cross-pieces, which served as seats. These boats have no bridge,
neither have they any rudder; an Indian squatted at the end of
the boat governs it with a very broad-bladed paddle.</p>
<p>I made a short passage in one of these proas when the wind was
fresh, and estimated its speed at three leagues an hour. The
islanders assured me that with a very strong wind they could go
five leagues an hour, but that such speed was rarely attained.
These proas are therefore the best sailers amongst the small
sea-going craft known, and are very ingeniously constructed. It
appeared to me that those of Guam are not quite safe at sea, for
a wave might detach the outrigger or break it, and the boat would
then capsize or founder; but I have been assured that the Indians
are such good swimmers, and so experienced in their art of
navigation, that when a boat capsizes through the loss of its
outrigger, they have sufficient skill to right it in the open
sea, and they never lose more than their cargo. It has been found
possible elsewhere to give the proas greater solidity, preserving
at the same ' time their form and swiftness, and boats uniting
these advantages are found on the coast of Cochin
China.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Dumont D'Urville (Voy. de l'Astrolabe,
vol. v. p. 262) mentions on his first visit to the Marianne
Islands, May, 1828, that the natives were then no longer able to
make these canoes, and those from the Carolines, constructed on
like principle, were used instead. Vice-Admiral E. Paris, who was
a midshipman with D'Urville, tells me (Aug. 1888) this statement
is quite correct. For the best description of these proas, see
Appendix, where Anson's detailed account, with plan, is given.
Captain Woodes Rogers, who visited Guam in 1710, was so pleased
as a seaman with the speed and handiness of the proas of Guam,
that he carried one of them to London, thinking it might be worth
fitting up there as a curiosity on the Canal in St. James's Park
(R.C. Leslie, Life Aboard a British Privateer, London,
1889).]</p>

<h4><span class="aa">Continuation of various Observations made at
Guam.</span></h4>
<p>According to the estimates of the Spaniards, the island of
Guam is about forty leagues in circumference. From the seashore
it rises by. very slow degrees towards its centre, but it is not
mountainous. The inhabitants maintain that the soil is everywhere
good and fertile, with the exception of the northern portion,
which forms a peninsula, and is only slightly watered, the rest
of the island being well watered, and one cannot go a league in
any direction without coming across a stream. Towards the
interior of the country, east and south of Agana, there are many
fresh-water springs issuing out of the rocks, and which form at
intervals pools of clear water, which, being shaded by bushy
trees, maintain a most refreshing coolness in spite of the great
heat of the climate.</p>
<p>The island is studded with picturesque and delicious scenes.
In my promenades it often happened that I came across these
enchanting places where Nature had made all, and the hand of man
none of, the arrangements. It was not possible to feel bored,
everything was arranged for the happiness of the man who loves
solitude, verdure, shade, freshness, the smell of flowers,
crystalline water springing from a rock and falling in cascades;
who enjoys the songs of numberless birds, and glimpses of
scenery, coco-nuts, breadfruits, oranges, citrons, and an
infinity of wild fruits found equally on trees with their
flowers, and growing in that charming irregularity in which art
has never been able to imitate Nature. It was only with regret
that I could leave such delicious places, for I could have spent
my whole life there. Between these delightful spots and the
sea-coast there is an open space, about two hundred fathoms
broad, consisting of sand mixed with coral, which appears to have
been abandoned by the sea, or to have emerged from its bosom by
the effect of some volcanic shock or upheaval. These lands
consist of a series of valleys perfectly filled up with coral,
and which appear to have been formerly the beds of marine
currents. One has to pass three or four of these dales one after
another before arriving at the vegetable soil of the island on
the skirts of the forest. All this space is full of uncultivated
growth, of caper trees and coco-nut palms, which thrive well in
the midst of the coral.</p>
<p>It appeared to me that the greater part of the rocks around
Agana are granitic; the pebbles which are found on the seashore
are crystallized inside. I noticed that amongst the small
pyramidal crystals enclosed in these pebbles there were some
which were yellow and red, like topazes and rubies.</p>
<p>The Guam islanders are such as they were depicted by Magellan:
short in stature, ugly enough, black, and generally scabby,
although they bathe frequently. The women are generally
beautiful, well made, and with a red skin. Both men and women
have very long hair. Through civilization this small people have
become hospitable, honest, and peaceful; at the same time they
have adopted a vice unknown to their ancestors, for the men are
slightly given to drunkenness, and will drink a great deal of
coco-nut spirit. They love music and dancing, but do not care
much about work. They are passionately fond of cock-fighting. On
Sundays and holidays they assemble after service at the door of
the church, every man bringing his cock to fight that of another,
and every man bets on his own bird.</p>
<p>The Guam Mission is at the present day in the hands of the St.
Augustines, who have replaced the Jesuits, and there are five of
the brotherhood attached to the Mission. One of them is appointed
to the parish of Agana, three of them are divided between
different parishes among other tribes in the Island, and the
fifth inhabits the Island of Saipan, which is ten leagues to the
north of Guam, and where a small population has been located.</p>
<p>These good monks thoroughly second the views of M. Tobias for
the welfare of his beloved Indians. I cannot repeat too often, in
praise of this excellent man, that he has no other ambition than
that of making his islanders happy; and that he is happy himself
because he succeeds in all his views. The Indians look upon him
and love him as a father. He has often repeated to me that he
should like to finish his days in Guam, calling my attention to
the fact that in no other part of the world could he be happier,
since he had the satisfaction of seeing a small tribe confided to
his care, in the enjoyment of a very good climate and of an
abundance of all the productions of the
earth.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> La Perouse, who was in Manilla from
28th Feb. to 9th April, 1787, says (Voyage Round the World, 3
vols. 8vo. London, 1807): "I saw at Manilla that upright and
virtuous Governor of the Ladrones, M. Tobias, who, unhappily for
his repose, has been too much celebrated by Abbé Raynal. I saw
him persecuted by the monks, who, representing him as a wretch,
destitute of piety, have alienated the affections of his wife,
who has even demanded to be separated from him, that she might
not live with a pretended reprobate, and all the fanatics have
applauded her resolution. M. Tobias is lieutenant-colonel of the
regiment which forms the garrison at Manilla, and is known to be
the best officer in the country; yet the Governor has ordered
that his appointments, which are considerable, should be paid to
this pious wife, leaving him only twenty-six dollars per month
for his own subsistence and that of his son. This brave soldier,
reduced to despair, was waiting for a proper opportunity to quit
the colony in order to obtain justice" (vol. ii. ch. v. p. 285).
When Dumont D'Urville visited Guam in 1828, he found every sign
of a rapid decay, but on his second visit, ten years later, under
a new Governor, it seemed to have recovered somewhat.]</p>
<p>We had landed with more than two hundred sick men at Guam, and
we had not lost a single one of them; all had completely
recovered within the space of a month, in spite of the almost
continual rains we had to put up with, until towards the middle
of October. The northern monsoon, which commenced at this period,
brought us fine weather and a clear sky, and we profited by the
occasion to repair our vessels.</p>
<p>During our abode at Guam I noticed that at the change of the
moon the sea grew very rough for two or three days. After a rest
of about two months, we were disposed to profit by the N.E.
monsoon in order to get to the Philippine Islands. On the 18th of
November we took on board both our vessels abundant provisions,
so generously furnished us by M. Tobias; these consisted of beef,
pigs, goats, poultry, vegetables and fruit of every description.
We had paid four piastres for the bullocks, but were not allowed
to pay for any other provisions. M. Tobias furnished us with a
pilot to guide us into the Philippine Archipelago.</p>

<h4><span class="aa">Departure from the Island of Guam and
Continuation of our Journey to the Philippine
Islands.</span></h4>
<p>We left Agana with deep regret on the 19th of November, but
with a good north-easterly wind, and our sailors, who were in
better health than they would have been even in leaving a French
port, called the island a terrestrial paradise. Our course lay W.
by a quarter N.W. in order to get into the Strait of San
Bernardino, which is the ordinary course for galleons on
returning from Acapulco to Manilla. On the 20th, at two o'clock
in the afternoon, the <i>Mascarin</i> sprang a leak forward,
below the lower deck in the starboard bow, which we were unable
to stop, and she made water at the rate of six inches an hour.
During the whole of our journey from Guam until we sighted
Catandûanes, to the east of Luzon, and to the north of the
Straits of San Bernardino, we had easterly and north-easterly
winds; when the wind was in the east, we had fine weather and a
calm sea; and when the wind was in the north, we had strong
squalls, rain, and a heavy sea, and thunder and lightning.</p>
<p>On the 27th and 28th of November we had spread but little
sail, on account of the rough weather, and we kept head to wind
during two nights, because, according to our reckoning and to the
Spanish Chart of Father Mourillo, we should have been on the
coast of the Isle of Luzon since the 27th; by M. d'Après'
<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> chart we were, according to our reckoning,
five leagues off at noon on the 28th. However that may be, and
although the horizon was very clear, we did not discover land
that day, and we kept head to wind again on the night of the 28th
and 29th. It seems that there is a strong easterly current in the
different straits in the stretch of sea which separates the
Philippines from the Marianne Islands.</p>

in Paris, which was a sort of depôt for charts and the
dissemination of information relating to the Indies.]</p>
<p>At daybreak on the 29th we made land without being able to
distinguish it well; the tide was making and the waves made a
noise like that of breakers. At six o'clock in the morning we
sighted distinctly the northern part of the island of
Catanduanes, which appeared to me to be ten leagues off. This
part of the island is high, mountainous, and covered with trees.
At seven o'clock, we sighted the easternmost point of Luzon,
called Montafou on the charts, then the little island of San
Bernardino, which appeared to be barren and surrounded with
breakers, and which at eight o'clock in the morning was three
leagues off to the S.S.E. This island is three hundred and
seventy-seven leagues distant from Guam, and according to my
observation it is situated in latitude 12° 44' N. and longitude
121° 13' east of Paris; magnetic variation was 1° N.E. On
entering the straits, we saw the Island of Samar very clearly, it
appeared to be low, rocky, covered with trees, and surrounded by
islets.</p>
<p>We did not see Cape Spiritto Santo, which is the N.E. point of
the island of Samar, where the galleons returning from Acapulco
land during the S.E. monsoon. It was at this cape that M. Anson
established his quarters for his attack on the Manilla galleon,
which he had the good fortune to take in June, 1743.
<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> On the 26th of August, 1742, Captain
Anson sent a cutter on shore at the island of Tinian, not far
from Guam. Here his ship, the <i>Centurion</i>, was refitted, and
from here she re-started on her memorable voyage when she took
the Spanish galleon <i>Nostra Seigniora de Cabadonga</i>. See
Anson's Voyage, 4to. London, 1748, p. 304.]</p>
<p>The Island of San Bernardino is situated in the middle of the
straits bounded to the north by the S.E. point of Luzon, and the
N.E. point of Samar Island; the channel is four leagues broad
here, and six leagues broad between the cape of Samar Island and
the Island of San Bernardino. With the winds of the northern
monsoon we entered the north channel by coasting along Bulusan,
on the Island of Luzon. The galleons which enter this strait
during the S.W. monsoon pass through the channel between Samar
and San Bernardino.</p>
<p>As soon as we had passed this little island, which we left on
our S.E., we encountered such a very strong south-westerly
current that we could hardly manage our vessels. In coasting
along Luzon we saw to the west of San Bernardino the settlement
of Bulusan, in which I noticed a big building which might be a
church. We hoisted our ensign, and were immediately answered by
the Spaniards. This coast is pleasant to look at, with easily
accessible sand coves and several fresh-water creeks.</p>
<p>At two o'clock we found ourselves two leagues off the northern
point of the Island of Capul. This island is the only one on the
whole route off which we could, so to speak, anchor in the open
sea. The bottom for three leagues gave us very unequal soundings,
but we found it good at 70 to 35 fathoms, although we did not
begin to reach it until the Island of San Bernardino was five
leagues to our N.E. At the same time the islands of the Cape of
Bulusan were to the N. of us, and the northern point of Capul was
to our S. We found no bottom when the same point was four leagues
E.S.E. of us.</p>
<p>During the night we had little wind and less current. On the
30th November we continued our journey up the mid channel between
the Island of Ticao and Luzon. In passing the head of the north
of Ticao I noticed the settlement of Colentas, which appeared to
be tolerably large. The church was especially striking.
Throughout this journey we did not find bottom at one hundred
fathoms, and we passed, on the north of the Island of Luzon, the
beautiful port Sol-Sogou, of which the Island of Bagatao forms
the entrance. As soon as we had passed the little islands at the
N. of Ticao, we made for the S.E. point of the Island of Bourias,
which we coasted for a league, leaving the northern point of
Masbate Island, which is three times as big, about two leagues to
the south.</p>
<p>The passage amongst these islands could not possibly be more
beautiful; there is no danger and one can beat about everywhere,
although it is true there is no bottom except close to the
shores. On the I St of December the wind fell, and with it came
rain and thunder, and we made little progress. On the 2nd, the
sea having calmed down, we saw the little Island of Bancou five
leagues to the W.S.W. At one o'clock, having sighted the Island
of Marindonqué, we steered W.S.W. in order to coast the southern
point, and so avoid striking the Two Hermanas, or the Two
Sisters, which are on the N.W. of Bancou Island. In this passage,
which is about five leagues broad, the currents carried us
rapidly along on to the island of Mindoro, but we recovered by
tacking about. The southern point of Marindonqué is terminated by
a large islet. On coasting the eastern side of this island we
found, at two leagues from the coast, three islets, which the
Spaniards have named the Viregos, the Viceroys, which we doubled
a league off.</p>
<p>On leaving these islands, we had been obliged to tack, so that
we might go N.N.W. and N.W. in order to gain Point Galbau, on the
Island of Luzon, and pass between Calampau and Green Island.
Calms, rains and squalls followed alternately. On the 3rd
December we reached the coast of Luzon, and passed between this
island and Green Island. I noticed that the latter island has
breakers on the S.E. side, and I should prefer the
two-leagues-wide passage between Luzon and Green Island to that
which appears bigger between the latter island and Mindoro. The
latter passage is endangered by several islets, although it is
said that this is the passage used by the galleons on their way
from Manilla through the Straits of San Bernardino to Acapulco.
Since we arrived in the Philippine Archipelago I have observed
that there was no magnetic variation. All these islands are well
wooded, look pleasant, and have plenty of streams.</p>
<p>On the 4th of December, having doubled Green Island, and the
wind having veered to the S.E., we steered for Mindoro, passing
the southern point of the Island of Maricaban a league off. In
the afternoon we had a clear view of Callavitte Point, to the N.
of Mindoro, the coast of Luzon, San-Jago Point, Taal Lagoon, and
Loubang, and the Goats and Fortune Islands. Contrary winds
detained us in this passage, which is not without its dangers.
During the night, in spite of the strong S.E. currents which
carried us on to the dangerous islands of Ambil, Loubang and the
Goats, we safely passed Fortune Island a league off to the W.</p>
<p>The next morning, the 5th of December, we had to tack about to
gain the entrance to Manilla Bay. We had anchored the night
before on a good thirty fathom black sand bottom outside the
Island of Marivelles, about two leagues off. After experiencing
three calm days and three days with contrary winds, we entered
the bay by the southern passage of Marivelles Island, and
anchored on the 8th in Port Cavitte, in a three-and-a-half fathom
mud bottom. There we met the Spanish frigate Venus, commanded by
M. Langara,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> who was preparing to return to
Spain <i>viâ</i> the Cape of Good Hope. We also found the
galleons <i>St. Joseph</i> and <i>St. Charles</i>, with several
other craft and galleys.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Don Juan de Langara, 1730-1800, was a
Spanish Admiral, who distinguished himself greatly at the battle
of St. Vincent in 1780, where he was taken prisoner by Admiral
Rodney.]</p>

<h3>ANCHORAGE IN MANILLA BAY.</h3>
<a name="ch-25" id="ch-25"></a>
<h4><span class="aa">Description of Port Cavitte and of what we
did there.</span></h4>
<p>Manilla Bay is almost quite round; it is about seven leagues
across in every direction, and twenty leagues in circumference
from point to point. It has a S.E. aspect. Marivelles Island is
situated in the middle of the entrance, and is half a league
broad by two long, and forms N. and S. passages. Both these
passages are equally good. The passage on the S., which appears
to be broadest, is somewhat contracted by two islets, or rocks,
one of which, called Le Fraisé, is on the Luzon side, and the
other, called Monja, is close to Marivelles Island. On this
island the Spaniards have established an Indian post to give
notice of vessels in search of the entrance to the harbour. When
they see a ship, they hoist a flag, discharge a mortar, and some
of them immediately take a boat for Cavitte and Manilla, to give
notice of what they have sighted. The distance from Marivelles to
Cavitte is about seven leagues.</p>
<p>This port is situated in the S.E. comer of the bay; it is
horseshoe in form, and will hold twelve ships, which are safe on
a mud bottom. It is defended by a large battery and a small
fort.</p>
<p>The Spaniards have established a staff of officers here, under
the orders of a commandant, called a Castillano; they have a
major, an adjutant, a sub-adjutant and a commander of artillery,
and three hundred men in garrison. There is also an arsenal with
all its workshops surrounded by walls, magazines and a dockyard.
On the tongue of land on the W. side of the port there is a
fairly big village, peopled by sailors and every description of
Indian workmen employed in the repairing and careening of
vessels. The village contains about a thousand souls and has
three churches. The city of Manilla is situated three leagues and
a half from Cavitte, and almost in the middle of the eastern
portion of the bay.</p>
<p>After having paid the necessary visits at Cavitte, and having
taken proper precautions in the port for the safety of our
vessels, we went to Manilla, to the Governor-General, who
received us extremely well and afforded us all the help we asked
for to enable us to repair our vessels. From the palace of the
Governor we went to that of the Archbishop, who received us with
every possible mark of kindness. We then made the other customary
visits to the members of the Royal Audience, to the principal
officers of the place, and to the chief citizens.</p>
<p>A few days afterwards I took up my abode in a suburb which is
called Saint Croix, where strangers generally lodge.
Communication between the land and our ships by means of boats
was so easy, that our work did not suffer in the slightest by our
establishment in this Manilla suburb. In the meanwhile I did not
lose a moment in stopping the <i>Mascarin's</i> leak, which had
sprung during our journey from Guam.</p>
<p>Having dismantled this storeship, and having cleared away some
of the sheathing in search of the leak, I found that the vessel
required far greater repairs than I had at first thought
necessary. Her examination being completed, it was decided to
refit her, which I did at once, changing some rotten planks, some
essential portions of her bows, and a large topmast, which were
past service. But all these repairs took a long while to do,
because our best sailors deserted day by day, and because the
native Indian workmen do not work quickly.</p>
<p>On the 15th February, 1773, the <i>Castries</i>, entirely
remasted and careened, commanded by Chevalier Duclesmeur, weighed
anchor in Manilla Bay in order to profit by the N.E. monsoon to
return to the Isle of France, the deserters being replaced by
twenty Indian sailors. I remained behind to complete the
refitting and re-equipping of the <i>Mascarin</i>, which was done
on the last day of February.</p>
<p>On the 1st of March I cleared Port Cavitte, and anchored at
the mouth of the Manilla river in four and a half fathoms with a
mud bottom. This anchorage is a mile away from the mouth of the
river, and formed by two stone jetties which extend three cables'
lengths from the shore. I approached close to the city, for at
this season of the year no squalls are to be feared, so as to be
able to ship my stores more promptly and at less cost. I made
several attempts to get back my deserted sailors, but I perceived
clearly that they had been seduced from their duties, they as
well as those of the <i>Castries</i>, and even those of the
Spanish frigate, which had been obliged to leave the bay on its
return to Spain with fifty Indian sailors to replace the same
number of Spanish sailors whom the Governor was suspected of
having prevailed upon to desert, and who had all put in an
appearance at Cavitte the morning after the departure of the
frigate. I was obliged to give way to superior force, and engaged
thirty Indian boatmen to replace my deserters. They demanded, as
a condition of their engagement, that I should give them two
months' pay in advance. I was forced to concede this demand, and
some of them then deserted with their pay. They might perhaps all
have deserted, had I not on my part, in engaging them, taken the
precaution to retain them on board, and not allowing them to land
again unless they left another man as substitute.</p>
<p>On the 8th of March all my stores were on board. I had said
good-bye to the Governor and to everybody in the place, and I
only awaited a favourable wind to weigh anchor and return to the
Isle of France. Before leaving this harbour I will here note down
my observations on Manilla, and on the colony of which it is the
capital.</p>

<h4><span class="aa">Observations made at Manilla, the Capital of
the Philippines.</span></h4>
<p>The city of Manilla is one of the most beautiful that
Europeans have built in the East Indies; its houses are all of
stone, with tile roofs and they are big, comfortable and well
ventilated. The streets of Manilla are broad and perfectly
straight; there are five principal streets, which divide the city
lengthwise, and about ten which divide it broadways. The form of
the city is that of an oblong, surrounded by walls and ditches,
and defended on the side of the river by a badly-planned citadel,
which is about to be pulled down and rebuilt. The city walls are
flanked by a bastion at every one of the four angles. There are
at Manilla eight principal churches, with an open place in front
of every one; they are all beautiful, large and very richly
decorated. The Cathedral is a building which would grace any of
our chief European cities, and has just been rebuilt by an
Italian Theatin,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> who is an able architect.
The two rows of columns which support the vaults of the nave and
of the aisles are of magnificent marble, so also are the columns
of the portal, the altars, the steps and the pavement. These
marbles are obtained from local quarries, are of great variety,
and are of the greatest beauty. The space in front of the
Cathedral is very large, and is the finest in the city.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> A regular order of clergy established
at Rome in 1524, but which does not appear to have spread much
beyond Italy and France.]</p>
<p>On one side the Palace of the Governor is flanked by the
Cathedral, on the other by the Town Hall. The Town Hall is very
beautiful. At the extremity of the place in front of the
Cathedral a large barracks is being constructed, and which is to
be capable of lodging eight thousand troops.</p>
<p>Private houses, as well as public buildings, are all one story
high. Spaniards never live on the ground floor, on account of the
dampness, but they occupy the first floor instead. The heat of
the climate has induced them to build very large apartments, with
verandahs running right round the outside, so as to keep out the
sun; the windows form part of the verandahs, and the daylight
only enters the rooms by means of the doors which open out on to
these verandahs. The ground floor serves as a storehouse, and to
prevent the rising of moisture from the soil its surface is
raised a foot, by means of a bed of charcoal; then sand or gravel
is placed on the top of this bed, which is finally paved with
stone or brick laid with mortar.</p>
<p>As the country is very subject to earthquakes, the houses,
although built of stone, are strengthened with large posts of
wood or iron fixed perpendicularly in the ground, rising to the
top of the wall-plates, and built within the walls, so that they
cannot be seen, and then crossed on every floor by master
girders, strongly bound together and bolted by wooden keys, and
which 80 consolidate the whole building.</p>
<p>Manilla is built on the mouth of a beautiful river, which
flows from a lake, called by the Spaniards <i>Lagonne-de-bay</i>,
and which is situated five leagues inland. Forty streams flow
into this lake, which is twenty leagues in circumference, and
around which there are as many villages as streams. The Manilla
river is the only one which flows out of the lake. It is covered
with boats, bringing to the city every sort of provision from the
forty agricultural tribes established on the lake shores.</p>
<p>The suburbs are bigger and more thickly populated than the
city itself; they are separated from it by a river, across which
a beautiful bridge has been thrown. The Minondo suburb is more
especially inhabited by half-breeds, Chinese and Indians, who are
for the most part gold and silversmiths, and all of them
workpeople.</p>
<p>The Saint Croix suburb is inhabited by Spanish merchants, by
foreigners of all nations, and by Chinese half-breeds. This
quarter is the most agreeable one in the country, because the
houses, which are quite as fine as those of the city, are built
on the river bank, and thereby they enjoy all the conveniences
and pleasantness due to such a position.</p>
<p>In spite of such advantages, the city is badly situated, being
placed between two intercommunicating volcanoes, and of which the
interiors, being always active, are evidently preparing its ruin.
These two volcanoes are those of the Lagonne-ed-Taal and of Monte
Albay, When one burns, the other smokes. I shall speak later on
of the former of these volcanoes, which, to me at least, appeared
a most singular one.</p>
<div class="insertl"><a name="Fig20" id="Fig20"></a><img alt=""
src="1306431h-images/Fig20.jpg"></div>
<p>Until the shocks from the volcanoes shall decide its fate,
Manilla remains the capital of the Spanish establishments in the
Philippines. Here reside the Governor, who is called the
Captain-General and President of the Royal Audience. Don Simon de
Auda filled this office when I arrived at Manilla. This Governor
had previously been a member of the Royal Audience, and when the
English, at the end of the last war, took
Manilla,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> he escaped from the city before the
surrender, placed himself at the head of the Indians of the
province of Pampague, and, without regard to the capitulation of
the city, he is said to have succeeded in confining the English
within their conquest, starving equally the conquerors and the
conquered. Noticing that the Chinese established outside the city
walls were furnishing provisions to English and Spaniards alike,
he butchered them, putting more than ten thousand to the sword.
It seemed to me however that the Spaniards in general considered
the efforts of this councillor to be more harmful than
advantageous to the welfare of the Spanish colony. The English,
harassed by the Indians under Don Simon de Auda, had on their
part armed and raised other provinces of Luzon, so as to oppose
Indian to Indian, and this sort of civil war did more harm to the
colony than even the capture of Manilla by the English.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Manilla was taken by assault by the
English on 6th October, 1762. A full account of the capture is to
be found in the "London Gazette" of 19th April, 1763, which
contains General Draper's account of the siege. The land force
employed was 2300; the fleet was unable to act, owing to bad
weather.]</p>
<p>However this may be, Don Simon de Auda returned to Spain after
the peace, was rewarded for his zeal by being made Privy
Councillor of Castile, and was sent back to Manilla as
Governor-General of the Philippines. Since his arrival in his
province he has started a number of important projects, but
difficult to be carried out at one and the same time. He has
started considerable fortifications in various parts of the city,
very large barracks, dykes at the mouth of the river, a powder
mill, smelting furnaces and forges to work the iron mines, and a
number of other useful works, which might have succeeded better
had they been started in due succession.</p>
<div class="insertr"><a name="Fig21" id="Fig21"></a><img alt=""
src="1306431h-images/Fig21.jpg"></div>
<p>The Philippine Archipelago contains fourteen principal
islands, the government of which is divided into twenty-seven
provinces, which are governed by <i>alcades</i> under the orders
of the Governor-Captain-General. All these islands are thickly
populated, the estimated population being about three million.
These islands extend from the tenth to the twenty-third degree N.
latitude, and vary in breadth from about forty leagues at the
north head of Luzon up to two hundred leagues from the south of
the S.E. point of Mindanao, to the S.W. point of Paragoa. They
are all fertile and rich in natural products. But although the
Spaniards have been established here for more than two hundred
years, they have not yet succeeded in making themselves masters
of the islands. They have no foothold on Paragoa, which is almost
eighty leagues long, nor on the adjacent small islands; they only
possess a few acres on the big island of Mindanao, which is two
hundred leagues in circumference, nor are they yet fully
acquainted with the interior of the Island of Luzon, where they
have their chief settlement, namely, the city of Manilla. Luzon
is the largest of these islands, being a hundred and forty
leagues long from Cape Bojador to Bulusan Point, which is the
most northerly point, and about forty leagues broad. In the
northern part of Luzon, near the province of Ilocos, there are
some aborigines with whom the Spaniards have never been able to
establish communication. It is believed that these people are the
descendants of Chinese, who, having been shipwrecked on these
shores, have established themselves in the mountains of this part
of the island. It is said that some Indians know the routes by
which access is gained to this people, and that they have been
well received by them; but it is in the interest of these Indians
to withhold the knowledge from the Spaniards, on account of their
great trade profits with these people, who lack many things and
have only provisions and gold.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when the Spaniards established themselves
in the Philippines, these islands were inhabited by two varieties
of man,&mdash;by the aborigines, mostly black, and by the Malays,
of reddish hue. The former inhabited, and still occupy the
forests, the mountains, and the centre of the islands; they are
still wild, and the Spaniards up to now have not been able to
subdue nor to civilize them. The latter were established along
the coasts, and were colonies formerly transplanted from Sumatra,
Malacca, Borneo and other Malay islands. These latter, in taking
the country, have driven the aborigines into the interior. It was
these inhabitants of the shores that the Spaniards subdued on
arrival, and whose missionaries have converted them to
Christianity. These islanders possessed a government, a
civilization, and some arts, and they had kings whose families
the Spaniards destroyed one by one. They have preserved their old
language, and there are only a few Indians in the neighbourhood
of Manilla who speak Spanish. The missionaries on arriving in the
country are first of all obliged to learn the Indian tongue,
which varies according to the different islands. Two different
languages are distinguished, the others being only dialects, the
<i>Tagale</i> language, which is that spoken in Luzon and the
adjacent islands, and the <i>Bissaïe</i>, which is the language
of the northern islanders. There are many varieties among the
inhabitants of these islands.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> At the south
of Luzon, Negro Island is so called on account of the nature of
its inhabitants, whose hair is woolly, and who speak a language
which is not met with outside their country. In the neighbouring
islands the Spaniards met with men who tatued the body like
nearly all the inhabitants of the South Seas as far as New
Zealand. It seems that all these people were good navigators, and
that various occurrences in the course of navigation have carried
them from one island to another, and have mixed them up in a
singular manner. It sometimes still happens that crafts are
brought by storms to the southern portion of the Philippine
Archipelago, containing men who are complete savages, whom it has
been impossible to civilize, who speak a language which has no
affinity with any language spoken in the Philippines, and whose
habitat is not discoverable.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> This division of the people into that
of Tagala and of Bissaya (more correctly Vissaya) is a very rough
and ready one, and, according to our present knowledge, not
accurate. The Tagalas are a very important branch of the Malays,
and the Vissayas a lesser but still important branch of the same.
Prof. Blumentritt (Versuch einer Ethnographie der Philipinen,
Ergänzungsheft 67 Petermann's Mitth. 1882) has given a very
complete description of the natives (aboriginals and others)
inhabiting this group.]</p>

<small>PLATE 8.</small></p>
<br>
<p>I had an opportunity of seeing some aboriginal savages of
Luzon, whom some Spanish Indians had brought in of their own free
will.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> They were very black, with woolly
hair, short in stature, but robust and sinewy, and very ugly.
Their whole clothing consisted in a girdle of bark, feather
bracelets on the forearm, a crown of feathers on the head, like
all the savages of the South Seas, a quiver full of arrows on the
back and a bow in the hand. They looked very wild, and were much
astonished with all that they saw. Accustomed to the silence of
the forest, the slightest, noise seemed to alarm them, and they
were continually looking about in the most uneasy manner. The
Spaniards treated them well, but it seemed to me that they
preferred their liberty to all the beautiful presents in silk and
cotton clothing which the Governor-General gave them. The habits
of these savages vary according to the different islands. In some
every family lives together, and forms a small society separated
from all the rest of humanity; in others every individual lives
alone in the forests with his mate. Amongst the former there are
some who construct huts in the centre of clumps of trees, where
they retire at night time, and often change the site. The
Spaniards thought for a long time that there lived on the island
of Mindoro a tribe of savages who had tails like monkeys, but
after many inquiries this belief was found to be
false.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> This old mistake proves,
nevertheless, that in the early days of the discovery the
Spaniards were struck with the varieties of the human race they
met with in this Archipelago.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The aborigines are described by
Blumentritt as mentioned above.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> If I read Prof. Terrien de Lacouperie
aright (Formosa Notes, Journ. Roy. Asiatic Society, Vol. XIX.
Part IV. July, 1887, p. 453), when he refers to the reports of
the tailed men of Formosa, he appears to think that because among
the Naga tribes men are said to have been discovered so late as
the year "1873 with tails about eighteen inches long, made of
wood," etc., the old report from Formosa may yet be verified, and
supposing the report be verified, its author will then be
favoured by posterity with a belief denied him by his
contemporaries. But on this subject it will be as well to repeat
Dr. Tylor's remarks: "European travellers have tried to
rationalize the stories of tailed men which they meet with in
Africa and the East. Thus Dr. Krapf points to a leather appendage
worn behind from the girdle by the Wakamba, and remarks: 'It is
no wonder that people say there are men with tails in the
interior of Africa,' and other writers have called attention to
hanging mats or waist-cloths, fly-flappers, or artificial tails
worn for ornament, as having made their wearers liable to be
mistaken at a distance for tailed men. But these apparently silly
myths have often a real ethnological significance, deeper at any
rate than such a trivial blunder. When an ethnologist meets in
any district with the story of tailed men, he ought to look for a
despised tribe of aborigines, outcasts, or heretics, living near
or among a dominant population, who look upon them as beasts, and
furnish them with tails accordingly. Although the aboriginal
Miau-tsze, or 'children of the soil,' come down from time to time
into Canton to trade, the Chinese still firmly believe them to
have short tails like monkeys; the half-civilized Malays describe
the ruder forest tribes as tailed men; the Moslem nations of
Africa tell the same story of the Niam-Niam of the interior. The
outcast race of the Cagots, about the Pyrennees, were said to be
born with tails; and in Spain the mediaeval superstition still
survives that the Jews have tails, like the devil, as they say"
(Primitive Culture, 2nd ed. vol. i. pp. 383-4).]</p>
<p>The Indians subdued by the Spaniards are very swarthy; they
are generally short, with very glossy hair, flat face, eyes
something like the Chinese, and the nose short and flattened. The
mixture of Indians with Spaniards and Chinese has produced many
mestizos, so that in the neighbourhood of Manilla the Indians no
longer resemble those at a distance, being very much whiter, and
one sees amongst the Indian female population young girls who are
as white and as pretty as Spaniards, and others who have all the
traits of the Chinese. There are very few European women to be
seen at Manilla. The Spaniards have taken Indian women to wife,
and the children produced by these marriages have in the second
generation turned out as white as Spaniards.</p>
<p>Through all these times the Indians have been well treated by
their conquerors, who have not been allowed to make slaves of
them. They have thus preserved their original Malay clothes, with
a few changes in the cut of the sarong, which is slightly
European in form. Their dress consists of a large pair of
drawers, in blue or crimson silk, and a shirt, generally of
Chinese linen very fine and very white. This shirt, which hangs
over the drawers like a tunic, is very often
embroidered.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>

<p>"In his account of the murder of the Frenchmen in New Zealand,
M. Crozet does not give any explanation as to the cause of this
unhappy affair. It is, however, quite impossible to conceive the
existence of monsters who would, in cold blood and without any
provocation, murder strangers, to whom they had extended their
hospitality. I know well enough that these savages are cannibals,
but there is a great difference between the exercise of this
execrable custom of eating up their enemies and the treason of
which they are accused.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The good Abbé appears to think that in
no case would the natives have been the aggressors. But John
Rutherford tells us that the vessel on which' he escaped from his
ten years' captivity among the Maories was to have been taken,
without provocation, by the Maories. His words are: "The chiefs
now consulted together, and resolved that, if the ship came in,
they would take her and murder the crew. Next morning she was
observed to be much nearer than she had been the night before;
but the chiefs were still afraid that she would not come in, and
therefore agreed that I should be sent on board on purpose to
decoy her to the land, which I promised to do" (Prof. Craik's The
New Zealanders, in Library of Entertaining Knowledge, p.
275).]</p>
<p>"Europeans! these savages know the superiority of your arms
and their own impotence to punish you, for your unjust acts,
otherwise than by surprise. Their perfidious caresses, instead of
seducing you, should keep you on the alert. Is it natural, is it
possible, that strangers, whose presence astonishes and
intimidates them, should gain the affections of a people in the
course of a single month, even when the former do not in any way
abuse their powers? This reflection alone should have sufficed to
save M. Marion. But where are the men who are able to appreciate
justly what they are told from the moment their vanity is
flattered and their smallest whim gratified. The unfortunate M.
Marion, who was received with every mark of veneration and
welcome for thirty-three days, was very far from imagining that
he was giving up himself, as well as part of his crew, to the
irreconcilable enemies of Europeans. We must acknowledge that
these people had to revenge themselves for the very severe
treatment they had suffered at the hands of a French ship,
commanded by M. de Surville, two years before the arrival of M.
Marion at this island. Here are the facts. On his voyage from
Pondichery to Peru, M. de Surville touched at New Zealand, and,
in hopes of re-establishing the health of his crew, as well as of
obtaining fresh provisions, he dropped anchor in a bay S. lat.
34° 41'.</p>
<br>

<br>
<small><span class="aa">A Flying Proa. See Appendix
II</span>.</small></p>
<br>
<p>"When M. de Surville went ashore, a chief came to him in his
gig, and boarding it in confidence, and with a friendly
disposition, asked M. de Surville for his gun. The latter only
gave him his sword. The chief immediately ran to show it to a
body of Indians which stood at some distance from the shore, and
seemed alarmed at M. de Surville's numerous following. The
Indians were armed, and held dog-skins and bundles of grass in
their hands, and which they continually raised and lowered. The
chief in an excited and Ipud voice seemed to allay their fears,
and from that moment a trade was established between the people
and the vessel's crew, which brought useful refreshments for the
re-establishment of the health of the latter. Unfortunately this
trade only lasted from the 17th to the 31st December, 1769. The
removal of a boat was the cause of the rupture of the bond of
friendship between the people and the Europeans. After a violent
gale, which he experienced on this coast, M. de Surville noticed
one of his boats stranded on the shore; but when he found time to
send to fetch it, all that could be found was the rope and the
trail of the boat which had been dragged into and hidden in some
creek,&mdash;for the trail was followed without success. M. de
Surville, wishing to punish the islanders for taking away his
boat, made signs to some Indians who were near their canoes, to
come to him. One of them ran to him, and was immediately arrested
and taken on board; the other Indians fled, and one of their
canoes was taken and the others burned; their huts were also set
fire to, and thus having brought terror and desolation to this
village, M. de Surville left the island, without foreseeing that
the terrible chastisement he had inflicted would have the saddest
consequences for all those Europeans who should have the
misfortune to follow him. The Indian who was taken captive was
named <i>Naginoui</i>; he was recognized by the ship's surgeon as
a chief who had generously placed his hut at the disposal of the
crew's sick hands, and of having given them every help and food
in his power, without wishing to receive the slightest reward.
And it should be well noted that he gave this assistance at a
very critical time; for, on account of the violence of the wind,
the boat which was taking the sick on board was obliged to anchor
at this chiefs village for the three days that the storm
lasted.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> It would no doubt have been possible
to obtain from this Indian some information regarding the
products of his country and the customs of his countrymen; but
the only reference we find in the ship's log is one giving the
date of the Indian's death on the 12th March, 1770, while in
sight of the Island of Juan Fernandez.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The forbearance of this chief may be
gauged from the fact that it was customary amongst the Maories to
make lawful prizes of all shipwrecks (B. Burns' Brief Narrative
of New Zealand Chief, Kendal, 1848, p. 17).]</p>
<p>"May we here be permitted to record reflections which draw
from us an expression of feeling we are unable to suppress.</p>
<p>"Geographical knowledge and commercial advantages in these
distant countries are, it seems, even in our times, bought at the
price of human life. It is in ranging the earth that we learn to
know it, and it is in hopes of getting a few more superfluities
for Europe that we water the soil which produces them with the
blood of its inhabitants. We forget that the land inhabited by
these savages belongs to them quite as much as the land we
inhabit belongs to us. They are almost similar to children,
without weapons, without light; and if these children, to whom
property of any kind is almost unknown, commit any theft, the
importance of which they do not understand, we employ violence to
force them to denounce the guilty party. If we are unable to
obtain this knowledge by violence, we make chance reprisals; and
often, as we have just seen, these reprisals fall on the heads of
those savages who fear European barbarism least, on those who
have treated us generously, on those who think they are right in
relying on our gratitude, that feeling which all nations agree in
regarding as sacred. If the savages appear round our buildings in
numbers large enough to cause anxiety, they are fired upon, and
by the death of a few of their countrymen, they are taught the
power of our fire-arms; then, finally wounded by these outrages,
they make use of treachery, the sole defence remaining them in
their weakness, in order to disgust those Europeans who come
troubling their rest, and their vengeance knows no mercy. We call
them treacherous and cowards, because they do not come forward
and attack artillery and bayonets with wooden clubs and arrows
pointed with fish-bones.</p>
<p>"Europeans are much too strong, and savages much too weak, for
us to look upon the latter as the aggressors. Europeans, who
dress so very much alike, who have the same sort of ships, the
same weapons, and more especially the same general customs,
appear to them as one and the same nation. French, English, Dutch
and Spaniards are often punished for one another, and perhaps up
to now no one has really deserved to have been mistaken by the
savages for belonging to any other nation than to that of the
first oppressors.</p>
<p>"Europeans have no right to offer violence to savages except
in procuring what is necessary, and except they are refused the
necessary in exchange for what they offer; but such refusal has
not yet been met with. They ought all the more to be indulgent
towards savages, to treat them with justice, and even to be
lenient towards them, because savages have not the light to see
the extent of the evil they may do. Further, it is the Europeans
who go in quest of them, who expose them to the temptation of
committing the crimes, and who themselves go prepared to commit
all the cruel deeds which may become necessary. Hence although
they may only do that which is necessary in self-defence, it can
never be said that they are innocent.</p>
<p>"What have the voyages, so much glorified by Europeans,
brought to these shores ? A few more crimes than already existed,
and always avenged by fresh crimes, and for which a few useful
animals, or a few seeds left by Europeans are, after all, but a
poor expiation, and which will not compensate, for a long time,
the evil the Europeans have done, nor the contagion Europeans
have spread."</p>

<h4><a name="ch-29" id="ch-29"><i>B</i></a>.&mdash;<span class=
"aa">Native Accounts of the Massacre</span>.</h4>
<p>Dr. Thomson, after giving a very condensed account of the
massacre, continues: "Such is the French account of Marion's
massacre; the native version I accidentally heard on a singular
occasion. During the winter quarter of 1851, the French corvette
<i>L'Alcmène</i>, thirty-two guns, Commander Count d'Harcourt,
was totally wrecked, and ten lives lost, on the west coast of New
Zealand, the opposite side of the island, but only fifty miles
distant from the place of Marion's massacre. As several men were
severely wounded when the ship foundered, the Governor requested
me to go and assist their transit across the country to Auckland.
When so employed, I awoke one night, and saw a crowd of New
Zealanders talking earnestly around a fire. There were then
upwards of a hundred French sailors, and nearly two hundred
natives, plunged in sleep in the open air all about. Hearing the
name of Marion mentioned, I pretended to sleep, and listened to
the conversation. From many words, I gathered that, long ago, two
vessels commanded by Marion, belonging to the same nation as the
shipwrecked sailors, visited the Bay of Islands, and that a
strong friendship sprang up between both races; and that they
planted the garlic, which flavours the milk, butter and flesh of
cows fed in that district. Before the Wewis [<i>oui-oui-s</i>],
as the French are now called, departed, they violated sacred
places, cooked food with tapued wood, and put two chiefs in
irons; that, in revenge, their ancestors killed Marion and
several of his crew, and in the same spirit the French burned
villages and shot many New Zealanders.</p>
<p>"From inquiries made on the spot in 1853, the above narrative
and the reason for Marion's murder are, I believe, correct. No
man was then alive at the Bay of Islands who had witnessed the
affair, and only two old men were acquainted with the particulars
of it, although his name was familiar to all. According to the
native story, the French, not they, were the aggressors" (The
Story of New Zealand, London, 1859, vol. i. pp. 234-5).</p>
<p>Major Richard A. Cruise (Journ. New Zealand, London, 1824, p.
44) gives the following account of the massacre, from the Maori
side, fifty years after its occurrence:</p>
<p>"During the time the gentlemen were rowing to the shore, Kokro
pointed out the spot where Captain Cook had been attacked by the
natives; and gave a minute detail of the massacre of the crew of
Marion's ship. He said that the natives, exasperated against the
French Captain for having burned two of their villages,
determined on revenge; and concealing every hostile disposition
towards him and his people, pointed out a place to haul the
seine, and offered to assist the sailors in doing so. The
arrangement of the plot accorded with the treachery of the
proffered kindness. Next to every white man was placed a
New-Zealander; and when all hands were busy pulling the net, a
sudden and furious attack was made upon the unsuspecting and
defenceless Europeans, and every one of them was murdered."</p>
<p>It will be observed that neither of these accounts agree as to
the cause of the attack on the Frenchmen; Major Cruise says it
was due to the destruction of two Maori villages, and Dr. Thomson
ascribes it to violation of sacred places, etc.</p>
<p>It is, of course, only natural that the Maories should
maintain that the French were the aggressors, but Englishmen,
above all men, before blaming their neighbours, should bear in
mind their own difficulties in the South Seas.</p>

<h4><span class="aa">Anson's Description of the Outriggers of the
Marianne Islanders</span>. (Anson's Voyages, London, 4to. 1748,
pp. 340-342.) See Accompanying Plate.</h4>
<p>"The name of flying proa given to these vessels is owing to
the swiftness with which they sail. Of this the Spaniards assert
such stories as appear altogether incredible to those who have
never seen these vessels move, nor are they the only people who
relate these extraordinary tales of their celerity. For those who
shall have the curiosity to inquire at the dock at Portsmouth,
about a trial made there some years since with a very imperfect
one built at that place, will meet with accounts not less
wonderful than any the Spaniards have related. However, from some
rude estimations made by us of the velocity with which they
crossed the horizon at a distance, while we lay at Tinian, I
cannot help believing, that with a brisk trade-wind they will run
near twenty miles an hour; which, though greatly short of what
the Spaniards report of them, is yet a prodigious degree of
swiftness. But let us give a distinct idea of its figure.</p>
<p>"The construction of this proa is a direct contradiction to
the practice of all the rest of mankind. For as the rest of the
world make the head of their vessels different from the stern,
but the two sides alike; the proa, on the contrary, has her head
and stern exactly alike, but her two sides very different; the
side intended to be always the lee side being flat;
<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> whilst the windward side is built rounding,
in the manner of other vessels. And, to prevent her oversetting,
which from her small breadth, and the straight run of her leeward
side would, without this precaution, infallibly happen, there is
a frame laid oat from her to windward to the end of which is
fastened a log, fashioned into the shape of a small boat, and
made hollow. The weight of the frame is intended to balance the
proa, and the small boat is by its buoyancy (as it is always in
the water) to prevent her oversetting to windward, and this frame
is usually called an outrigger. The body of the proa (at least of
that we took) is made of two pieces of wood joined endways, and
sewed together with bark, for there is no iron used in her
construction. She is about two inches thick at the bottom, which
at the gunwale is reduced to less than one. The dimensions of
each part will be better known from the uprights and plans
contained in the annexed plate, which were drawn from an exact
mensuration; these I shall endeavour to explain as minutely and
distinctly as I can.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Crozet says the exact reverse of this.
See p. 94.]</p>
<p>"Fig. 1 represents the proa with her sail set, as she appears
when seen from the leeward.</p>
<p>"Fig. 2 is a view of her from the head, with the outrigger to
the windward.</p>
<p>"Fig. 3 is the plan of the whole; where AB is the lee side of
the proa; CD the windward side; EFGH the outrigger, or frame,
laid out to windward; KL the boat at the end of it; MNPQ two
braces from the head and stern to steady the frame; RS a thin
plank placed to windward, to prevent the proa from shipping water
and for a seat to the Indian who bales, and sometimes goods are
carried upon it; I is the part of the middle outrigger, on which
the mast is fixed. The mast itself is supported (Fig. 2) by the
shore, CD, and by the shroud, EF, and by two stays, one of which
may be seen in Fig. i, marked CD, the other is hid by the sail.
The sail, EFG, in Fig. i, is made of matting, and the mast, yard,
boom, and outriggers are all made of bamboo. The heel of the yard
is always lodged in one of the sockets, T or V, Fig. 3, according
to the tack the proa goes on; and when she alters her tack, they
bear away a little to bring her stern up to the wind, then, by
easing the halyard and raising the yard, and carrying the heel of
it along the lee side of the proa, they fix it in the opposite
socket; whilst the boom at the same time, by letting fly the
sheet, M, and haling the sheet, N, Fig. 1, shifts into a contrary
situation to what it had before, and that which was the stern of
the proa now becomes the head, and she is trimmed on the other
tack. When it is necessary to reef or furl the sail, this is done
by rolling it round the boom. The proa generally carries six or
seven Indians; two of which are placed in the head or stern, who
steer the vessel alternately with a paddle, according to the tack
she goes on, he in the stem being the steersman; the other
Indians are employed either in baling out the water which she
accidentally ships, or in setting and trimming the sail. From the
description of these vessels it is sufficiently obvious, how
dexterously they are fitted for ranging this collection of
islands called the Ladrones. Since these islands bear nearly all
N. and S. of each other, and are all within the limits of the
trade wind, the proas, by sailing most excellently on a wind, and
with either end foremost, can run from one of these islands to
the other and back again only by shifting the sail, without ever
putting about; and by the flatness of their leeside and their
small breadth, they are capable of lying much nearer the wind
than any other vessel hitherto known, and thereby have an
advantage which no vessels that go large can ever pretend to. The
advantage I mean is that of running with a velocity nearly as
great, and perhaps sometimes greater, than that with which the
wind blows."</p>
<p>[Although the drawing shows pulley blocks in use on this proa,
there is no reference to them in the text, nor do the islanders
appear to know their use.]</p>

<br>
<h4><span class="aa">A Brief Reference to the Literature Relating
To New Zealand.</span></h4>
<h5><span class="aa">By James R. Boosé, Librarian of the Royal
Colonial Institute.</span></h5>
<p>Unlike the literature relating to China, when in the year 513
B.C. during the dynasty of T'sin, in order to eradicate the
traditions of the subjugated kingdoms, it was ordered "that all
the records in charge of the historiographers be burned, and that
those who make mention of the past so as to blame the present be
put to death along with their relatives; and that whosoever shall
not have burned their books within thirty days of the issuing of
the ordinance, be branded and sent to labour for four years on
the Wall," the literature regarding New Zealand has fortunately
not suffered in a similar manner. It is therefore possible to
obtain an unbroken record of the history of the Colony from such
works as have from time to time been issued from the press.</p>
<p>In this short chapter it is in no way proposed to set forth a
complete bibliography of works relating to New Zealand, more
especially as there is in existence the excellent one compiled by
Mr. J. Collier, Librarian of the General Assembly Library at
Wellington, which was published two years ago, and which deals in
a most complete manner with the various epochs in the history of
New Zealand. Taking into consideration the existence of this
valuable work, it is simply the writer's intention to submit a
brief reference to the principal publications relating to New
Zealand which have appeared since our first acquaintance with the
Colony to the present time.</p>
<p>Although the actual settlement of New Zealand is an event of
recent date, the literature connected with it is remarkably
extensive and varied. The first and by far the most arduous duty
of the writer was to determine upon a plan of his work, selecting
and excluding names, determining their relative value. and
deciding what proportion of the space at his command could be
spared for individual mention. An idea of the extent of this work
may be gained when it is stated that the bibliography of Mr.
Collier occupies 235 pages of closely printed matter relating to
events in the history of the Colony extending from the year 1642
to 1889. As further evidence of the immensity of this literature
a bibliography appeared in the second volume of Dr. Thomson's
"Story of New Zealand," published in 1859, which the author
states contains "Ninety volumes and two hundred pamphlets, and
nearly a hundredweight of Parliamentary Papers." Having
summarized this vast array of literature, it will be necessary,
in order to consider the various stages in the history of New
Zealand, to divide the subject into five periods, mentioning only
the principal works regarding each as a guide to the student of
New Zealand afiairs. These periods have been: (i) The discovery
and early visits of the Europeans, (2) The period of
Civilization, including accounts of the native inhabitants,
together with the labours of the Missionaries, (3) The
Colonization of the Country, (4) The New Zealand War, and (5) The
History of the Colony generally, including its gradual progress
and its present position as an important portion of the British
Empire. Setting aside the claims set up for the discovery of New
Zealand anterior to the voyage of Abel Jansen Tasman, but which
have no substantiation, we find that the first account of that
Navigator's discoveries was published in Dutch during the year
1674, and during that ever memorable century which has been
appropriately termed the Century of Companies, on account of the
British, the French, the Spaniards, and the Dutch, having
simultaneously recognized the great principle of co-operation in
the furtherance of commercial enterprise. Although Tasman did not
land upon the shores of New Zealand, he nevertheless proved to
the world the existence in the Southern Seas of an important
territory. It is an extraordinary fact, however, that the only
?iccount of this voyage, in the performance of which Tasmania and
New Zealand were discovered, that the world possessed for more
than a century after its termination, was a curtailed abridgment
previously referred to, which was published at Amsterdam, and an
abstract of a more extended kind accompanied with charts and
views, included in Valentyn's Dutch work on the East Indian
Possessions of the Company. In 1771, however, a manuscript
journal of Tasman's, written by his own hand, was brought to
England by "a person unknown," and offered for sale to Sir Joseph
Banks, who, having established its authenticity, purchased it,
and subsequently lent it to Captain (afterwards Admiral) Burney,
who embodied it in the third volume of his important Collection
of Voyages to the South Seas. At Sir Joseph Banks's death his
library was bequeathed to the British Museum, where Tasman's
original journal is still to be found. Doubts having been raised
as to the genuineness of the journal. Captain Burney, in the
introduction to his work, discusses at length the question of its
authenticity, and conclusively proves that it possesses every
mark of originality. The literature describing the exploits of
the later discoverers would require a volume for a mere summary,
but the following collections of voyages, in addition to those of
Burney, may be regarded as bearing upon the discovery of and
early voyages to New Zealand. The collections of Dr. John Harris
(1764), M. Charles de Brosses' Histoire des Navigations aux
Terres Australes (1756), Callander's Terra Australis Cognita, or
Voyages to the Southern Hemisphere (1766-68), which is an English
translation of the preceding work with additions, and Alexander
Dalrymple's Collection, published in, 1770-71. Coming to a later
date, the next work of importance, and one which has ever held
the highest position in the history of maritime discovery, was
the account of the voyage of Captain Cook, who visited New
Zealand after leaving the Society Islands in 1769, published in
Dr. Hawkesworth's Collection of Voyages (1773), and for which
work the compiler received from Government £6000. For the
remaining works dealing with this period may be mentioned the
voyage of M. de Surville, and that of M. Marion du Fresne, which
was compiled by the Abbé Rochon from the papers of M. Crozet,
Marion's Lieutenant.</p>
<p>Turning now to the second period, viz. the Period of
Civilization, a large number of works may with advantage be
consulted.</p>
<p>During this period religion was a very potent influence in the
settlement of the country. It bestowed upon New Zealand the
services of a zealous, devoted band of missionaries, who, with
unfaltering courage, forced their way into the interior. The
accounts of their experiences, together with descriptions of the
aboriginal inhabitants, form a large collection, but the
following may be mentioned: John Savage's Account of New Zealand
(1807); Nicholas's Narrative of a Voyage to New Zealand, 1817;
Kendall and Lee's Grammar and Vocabulary of the Language of New
Zealand, 1820; Jules de Blosseville's Mémoire Géographique sur la
Nouvelle Zélande, 1826. The New Zealanders, written by G. L.
Craik, and containing the history of John Rutherford, a sailor,
supposed to have been detained among the natives for a
considerable number of years, of which work part is stated to
have been written by Lord Brougham. Yate's account of New
Zealand, and of the formation of the Church Missionary Society's
Mission in the Northern Island (1835), the contents being the
result of personal observation during a residence there of seven
years. J. S. Polack's New Zealand: a Narrative of Travels and
Adventures (1838), together with a second work by the same
Author, entitled Manners and Customs of the New Zealanders,
published in 1840. In 1841 Dieffenbach's New Zealand and its
Native Population appeared, under the auspices of the Aborigines
Protection Society. W. Browns, New Zealand and its Aborigines
(1845). The New Zealanders Illustrated, by George French Angas,
containing sixty coloured plates, with descriptions, appeared in
1847, followed in the same year by Savage Life and Scenes in
Australia and New Zealand, by the same author. Buddle's
Aborigines of New Zealand (1851); Edward Shortland's Southern
Districts of New Zealand (1854), which was compiled from the
notes of a journal written during part of the years 1843-4,
during which the author was employed in the service of the
Colonial Government as a Protector of the Aborigines, and
Traditions and Superstitions of the New Zealanders (1856) by the
same author. In 1855 one of the most important books in
connection with the History of the Aborigines of New Zealand was
published, having been written by Sir George Grey, and entitled
Polynesian Mythology and Ancient Traditional History of the New
Zealand Race. For studying the ancient history of the Maori no
better work could be consulted. In the preface the author
describes how he came to collect the legends. It may be mentioned
that Sir George Grey at this period made a collection of New
Zealand Books and Pamphlets to the extent of 311 Printed Volumes
and 223 Manuscripts, all in the Maori language, which were
subsequently presented by him to the South African Public Library
at Cape Town, where they at present are located, and form part of
the Grey Collection. Owing to the generosity of Sir George Grey,
the Auckland Public Library possesses a valuable collection of
South African literature, which would doubtless prove of great
value to the Cape Library. In commenting upon his various gifts
to these two libraries. Sir George Grey appears to have
recognized that the donations should have been reversed; for he
says in the preface to the second edition of Polynesian
Mythology, "I must seem to have made an injudicious arrangement
regarding the place of deposit of great historical treasures." If
it were possible for those two libraries to effect an exchange,
the residents of both Colonies would benefit by the possession of
many valuable documents regarding the early history of their
individual portions of the Empire.</p>
<p>Another work which should not be omitted from a selection of
works under this heading is Judge Maning's Old New Zealand; a
tale of the good old times, which was published in 1863, and
contains a description of old Maori life and manners. This book
was reprinted in 1876, with an introduction by the Earl of
Pembroke. Nor must mention be omitted of Mr. John White's works,
which include Te Rou, or the Maori at Home (1874), and his
complete and exhaustive work consisting of four volumes, the
first of which appeared in 1887. The work was compiled under the
direction of the Government of New Zealand. There are, of course,
many other works which may with advantage be referred to,
including those of the Rev. R. Taylor, W. Colenso, the Rev. J.
Buller, the Rev. Dr. Williams, Bishop of Waiapu, Lady Martin, and
Mr. J. C. Johnston, all of which contain valuable information
with regard to the customs and habits of the Maoris and the
history of the various missionary efforts in the Colony.</p>
<p>In dealing with the third period, it will be necessary to
refer to the time known as that of the Company period, during
which the colonisation of the Colony took place upon an extended
scale. A large number of works have found their way into
circulation, but the following may be considered the more
important: J. W. Lang's New Zealand in 1839, which contains four
letters addressed to Lord Durham as Chairman of the New Zealand
Land Company, in which he urged that the Company ought to make
way for a National Colony, and made the extraordinary declaration
that the church missionaries had actually been the principals in
the grand conspiracy of the European inhabitants to rob and
plunder the natives of their land. A work entitled The
Colonisation of New Zealand, being a brief history of The New
Zealand Company of London (1840); The Reports of the Directors of
the New Zealand Company (1840), which gives a sketch of the
Associations merged in the Company and of the formation of the
Company, with a statement of its principles; A Narrative of a
Residence in New Zealand, by Charles Heaphy, who was Draftsman to
the New Zealand Company (1842); An Account of the Settlements of
the New Zealand Company, by the Hon. H. W. (afterwards Lord)
Petre (1842); Petition of the New Zealand Company presented to
the House of Commons, by Joseph Somes, M.P., the Governor of the
Company (1845), which contains a history of the Colony up to that
date; E. J. Wakefield's Adventures in New Zealand from 1839-44,
together with a volume of fifteen coloured plates; The New
Zealand Question, by L. A. Chamerovzow (1848); Edward Gibbon
Wakefield's View of the Art of Colonisation (1849), which
contains an exposition of the principles on which the New Zealand
Company's and the Canterbury Association's Settlements were
founded; The Canterbury Papers (1851) consisting of information
concerning the principles, objects, plans and proceedings of the
founders of the Settlement of Canterbury; W. Swainson's New
Zealand, consisting of Lectures on the Colonisation of New
Zealand (1856); C. W. Adams' A Spring in the Canterbury
Settlement; and F. Fuller's Five Years' Residence in New Zealand
(1859), with Observations on Colonisation.</p>
<p>The next period, and one which may be referred to with regret,
relates to the war in New Zealand, and among other works the
following supply sufficient information on all questions
regarding its cause and the operations of the contending forces
during the years 1860-61. The first work published upon this
subject was that of the Rev. T. Gilbert, entitled New Zealand
Settlers and Soldiers, or the War in Taranaki. Sir J. E.
Alexander issued, in 1862, a work entitled Incidents of the Maori
War, and ten years later the same author gave a detailed account
of the war under the title of Bush Fighting in New Zealand, in
the preface to which he states that he has introduced the name of
every officer, non-commissioned officer, or private sentinel,
soldier or sailor he could discover who is mentioned in any
despatch or report of a creditable action. Swainson's New Zealand
and the War also appeared in 1862. In 1864 the present Under
Secretary of State for India published an interesting account of
the war, entitled The Maori King, or the Story of our Quarrel
with the Natives of New Zealand. At that time Sir John Gorst was
in the service of the New Zealand Government as Commissioner of
the Waikato District. Two years later a book appeared under the
title of The War in New Zealand, written by William Fox, whose
long and valuable services to the Colony have been recognized by
Her Majesty by the bestowal upon him of a Knight Commandership of
the Order of St. Michael and St. George. The preface to this work
contains so full a description of the services of this eminent
Colonist that extracts from it are worthy . of reproduction. It
runs as follows: " I have been a Colonist of New Zealand almost
from its foundation as a Colony. I have been a member of the
Legislature for many years, and during a great part of the
present struggle I filled the offices of Colonial Secretary and
Native Minister. I have probably had better opportunities of
obtaining accurate information and observing-current events in
the Colony than any other person. . . . In describing the
operations of the military campaigns, I have relied for the main
facts chiefly on the despatches of General Cameron or of his
subordinate officers who may have reported to him. I have also
referred to the contemporary reports of the correspondents of the
local newspapers. I am myself acquainted, more or less, with all
the country in which operations were carried on; and as regards
the Northern campaign, I have visited all the places where the
principal engagements occurred, many of them several times, and
most of them in company of officers who were in the engagements,
and described them to me on the spot." The remaining work upon
this subject, which may with advantage be consulted, is T. W.
Gudgeon's Reminiscences of the War in New Zealand, which was not
published until 1879. The author had exceptional opportunities
for gaining information, having held the position of Lieutenant
and Quartermaster of the Colonial Forces.</p>
<p>The last and, from a general point of view, the most
important, section of this brief chapter is that relating to the
history of the Colony in connexion with its rise, progress and
present position as one of the most important portions of the
Colonial Empire of Great Britain. The selection of a few of the
chief works regarding this subject from the immense stock of
literature extending over so long a period is a difficult and
arduous undertaking. The following works, however, may be put
forth as dealing with the questions affecting the general
history, government, and commercial position of the Colony: Major
Cruise's Journal of a Ten Months' Residence in New Zealand
(1824); James Busby's Our Colonial Empire and the Case of New
Zealand (1866), in which, in addition to dealing with the
question of the grant of Responsible Government, the author
explains and illustrates the true relations of the British
Colonies to the Mother Country; Charles Terry's New Zealand and
its Advantages and Prospects as a British Colony (1842); the New
Zealand Portfolio, by H. S. Chapman (1843)'; Ernest Dieffenbach's
Travels in New Zealand (1843), which work Hochstetter says
comprises numerous geological observations relative to the North
Island particularly, and asserts that (in 1867) it was one of the
best books on New Zealand; Mr. Brodie's Remarks on the Past and
Present of New Zealand (1845); Dr. S. M. D. Martin's New Zealand
(1845). The author of this work was at one time editor of the
Auckland Gazette, and was one of the signers of a letter to Lord
Stanley, intimating the intention of settlers at the Bay of
Islands to emigrate to an island in the Pacific for the purpose
of forming a permanent settlement. An Account of the Settlement
of New Plymouth, by Charles Hursthouse (1849); G. B. Earp's New
Zealand (1853); T. Cholmondeley's Ultima Thule, or Thoughts
Suggested by a Residence in New Zealand (1854); E. B. Fitton's
New Zealand (1856); C. Hursthouse's New Zealand, the Britain of
the South (1857); Dr. George Bennett's Gatherings of a Naturalist
in Australasia (1860); Sir William Martin's Taranaki Question
(1860); Edwin Hodder's Memoirs of New Zealand Life (1862); F. von
Hochstetter's New Zealand; its Physical Geography, Geology, and
Natural History (1867); Sir Walter Butler's History of the Birds
of New Zealand (1888); Alexander Kennedy's New Zealand (1873):
James Adam's Twenty-five Years of Emigrant Life in New Zealand
(1874); Alexander Bathgate's Colonial Experiences (1874); A Story
of New Zealand Life, published in 1881; the Rev. J. Buller's
Forty Years in New Zealand (1878), in the Appendix of which a
lecture entitled "New Zealand, the Future England of the Southern
Hemisphere," appears; B. Wells' History of Taranaki (1878); Sir
J. Hector's Handbook of New Zealand, of which four editions have
appeared, extending over the years 1879-1886; John Bathgate's New
Zealand, its Resources and Prospects (1880); John Buchanan's
Indigenous Grasses of New Zealand (1880); J. Coutts Crawford's
Recollections of Travel in New Zealand (1880); Dr. J. Logan
Campbell's Poenamo, or Sketches of the Early Days of New Zealand
(1881); John Bradshaw's New Zealand as it is (1883); H. Bramall's
Mineral Resources of New Zealand (1883); W. S. Green's High Alps
of New Zealand (1883); G. W. Rusden's History of New Zealand
(1883); G. W. Griffin's New Zealand&mdash;Her Commerce and
Resources (1884); J. H. Kerry-Nicholls' King Country (1884); W.
Gisborne's New Zealand Rulers and Statesmen (1886), which is a
biographical history of the Colony from its foundation, written
by a former Member of the House of Representatives and a
Responsible Minister of the Colony, who in 1888 published a
further work entitled The Colony of New Zealand, its History,
etc.; The Handbook of New Zealand Mines (1887); J. Bradshaw's New
Zealand of To-day (1888); Sir James Hector's Phormium Tenax as a
Fibrous Plant (1889); T. Kirk's Forest Flora of New Zealand
(1889), containing 157 plates; The Picturesque Atlas of
Australasia, edited by Dr. Andrew Garran, which is illustrated
with many New Zealand Scenes and accompanying letterpress; Dr.
Murray Moore's New Zealand for the Emigrant, Invalid, and Tourist
(1890); and Edward Wakefield's New Zealand after Fifty Years
(1890).</p>
<p>Such is a brief summary of the principal works which it is
suggested may prove of value to the student of New Zealand
affairs. It is not, however, in any way intended by the writer to
claim that such works only shall be consulted, for there are
many, probably of equal importance, which have been omitted
solely on account of the limited amount of space available. For
instance, there are important publications in pamphlet form
containing discussions of special subjects, matters of history,
ethnology, and other departments of inquiry incident to the
respective portions of the Colony, and descriptive of
contemporary adventure and research. It would not be right,
however, to close this chapter without referring to the
Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute, a society which has
rendered invaluable service in diffusing information upon all
questions affecting the Colonisation and Progress of the Colony.
The several papers included in its proceedings have been
contributed by the most eminent men connected with New Zealand,
prominent amongst whom may be mentioned Sir James Hector, who has
performed the duties of editor since the foundation of the
Institute in 1868, and whose long and brilliant efforts in the
cause of science have secured for him both fame and honours in
this country.</p>
