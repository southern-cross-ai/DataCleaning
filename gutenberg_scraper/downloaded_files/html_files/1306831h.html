  <h2><a id="pre"
     name="pre"></a>PREFACE FROM 2<small>ND</small> EDITION</h2>

  <p class="first">THIS volume, that originally appeared as a Second Series to
  <i>Historic Oddities and Strange Events</i>, is now issued under a new title
  which describes the peculiar nature of the majority of its contents. Several
  of the articles are concerned with the history of mysticism, a phase of human
  nature that deserves careful and close study. Mysticism is the outbreak in
  man of a spiritual element which cannot be ignored, cannot be wholly
  suppressed, and is man's noblest element when rightly directed and balanced.
  It is capable of regulation, but unregulated, it may become even a
  mischievous faculty.</p>

  <p>When the Jews are being expelled from Russia, and are regarded with bitter
  hostility in other parts of Eastern Europe, the article on the accusations
  brought against them may prove not uninstructive reading.</p>

  <p>There is political as well as religious and racial fanaticism, and the
  story of the "Poisoned Parsnips" illustrates the readiness with which false
  accusations against political enemies are made and accepted without
  examination. "Jean Aymon" exhibits the same unscrupulousness where religious
  passions are concerned. The curious episode to "The Northern Raphael" shows
  the craving after notoriety that characterises so much of sentimental,
  hysterical piety.<br>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; A SWISS PASSION PLAY</h2>

  <p class="first">WE are a little surprised, and perhaps a little shocked, at
  the illiberality of the Swiss Government, in even such Protestant cantons as
  Geneva, Zürich, and Berne, in forbidding the performances on their ground of
  the "Salvation Army," and think that such conduct is not in accordance with
  Protestant liberty of judgment and democratic independence. But the
  experiences gone through in Switzerland as in Germany of the confusion and
  mischief sometimes wrought by fanaticism, we will not say justify, but in a
  measure explain, the objection the Government has to a recrudescence of
  religious mysticism in its more flagrant forms. The following story
  exemplifies the extravagance to which such spiritual exaltation runs
  occasionally&mdash;fortunately only occasionally.</p>

  <p>About eight miles from Schaffhausen, a little way on one side of the road
  to Winterthür, in a valley, lies the insignificant hamlet of Wildisbuch, its
  meadows overshadowed by leafy walnut trees. The hamlet is in the parish of
  Trüllikon. Here, at the beginning of this century, in a farmhouse, standing
  by itself, lived John Peter, a widower, with several of his children. He had
  but one son, Caspar, married in 1812, and divorced from his wife; he was,
  however, blessed with five daughters&mdash;Barbara, married to a blacksmith
  in Trüllikon; Susanna, Elizabeth, Magdalena married to John Moser, a
  shoemaker; and Margaretta, born in 1794, his youngest, and favourite child.
  Not long after the birth of Margaretta, her mother died, and thenceforth the
  child was the object of the tenderest and most devoted solicitude to her
  sisters and to her father. Margaretta grew up to be a remarkable child. At
  school she distinguished herself by her aptitude in learning, and in church
  by the devotion with which she followed the tedious Zwinglian service. The
  pastor who prepared her for confirmation was struck by her enthusiasm and
  eagerness to know about religion. She was clearly an imaginative person, and
  to one constituted as she was, the barnlike church, destitute of every
  element of beauty, studiously made as hideous as a perverse fancy could
  scheme, and the sacred functions reduced to utter dreariness, with every
  element of devotion bled out of them, were incapable of satisfying the
  internal spiritual fire that consumed her.</p>

  <p>There is in every human soul a divine aspiration, a tension after the
  invisible and spiritual, in some more developed than in others, in certain
  souls existing only in that rudimentary condition in which, it is said, feet
  are found in the eel, and eyes in the oyster, but in others it is a
  predominating faculty, a veritable passion. Unless this faculty be given
  legitimate scope, be disciplined and guided, it breaks forth in abnormal and
  unhealthy manifestations. We know what is the result when the regular action
  of the pores of the skin is prevented, or the circulation of the blood is
  impeded. Fever and hallucination ensue. So is it with the spiritual life in
  man. If that be not given free passage for healthy discharge of its activity,
  it will resolve itself into fanaticism, that is to say it will assume a
  diseased form of manifestation.</p>

  <p>Margaretta was far ahead of her father, brother and sisters in
  intellectual culture, and in moral force of character. Susanna, the second
  daughter of John Peter, was an amiable, industrious, young woman, without
  independence of character. The third daughter, Elizabeth, was a quiet girl,
  rather dull in brain; Barbara was married when Margaretta was only nine, and
  Magdalena not long after; neither of them, however, escaped the influence of
  their youngest sister, who dominated over their wills almost as completely as
  she did over those of her two unmarried sisters, with whom she consorted
  daily.</p>

  <p>How great her power over her sisters was may be judged from what they
  declared in after years in prison, and from what they endured for her
  sake.</p>

  <p>Barbara, the eldest, professed to the prison chaplain in Zürich, in 1823,
  "I am satisfied that God worked in mighty power, and in grace through
  Margaret, up to the hour of her death." The father himself declared after the
  ruin of his family and the death of two of his daughters, "I am assured that
  my youngest daughter was set apart by God for some extraordinary
  purpose."</p>

  <p>When Margaret was six, she was able to read her Bible, and would summon
  the family about her to listen to her lectures out of the sacred volume. She
  would also at the same time pray with great ardour, and exhort her father and
  sisters to lead God-fearing lives. When she read the narrative of the
  Passion, she was unable to refrain from tears; her emotion communicated
  itself to all assembled round her, and the whole family sobbed and prayed
  aloud. She was a veritable "ministering child" to her household in all things
  spiritual. As she had been born at Christmas, it was thought that this very
  fact indicated some special privilege and grace accorded to her. In 1811,
  when aged seventeen, she received her first communion and edified all the
  church with the unction and exaltation of soul with which she presented
  herself at the table. In after years the pastor of Trüllikon said of her,
  "Unquestionably Margaretta was the cleverest of the family. She often came to
  thank me for the instructions I had given her in spiritual things. Her
  promises to observe all I had taught her were most fervent. I had the best
  hopes for her, although I observed somewhat of extravagance in her.
  Margaretta speedily obtained an absolute supremacy in her father's house. All
  must do what she ordered. Her will expressed by word of mouth, or by letter
  when absent, was obeyed as the will of God."</p>

  <p>In personal appearance Margaretta was engaging. She was finely moulded,
  had a well-proportioned body, a long neck on which her head was held very
  upright; large, grey-blue eyes, fair hair, a lofty, well-arched brow. The
  nose was well-shaped, but the chin and mouth were somewhat coarse.</p>

  <p>In 1816, her mother's brother, a small farmer at Rudolfingen, invited her
  to come and manage his house for him. She went, and was of the utmost
  assistance. Everything prospered under her hand. Her uncle thought that she
  had brought the blessing of the Almighty on both his house and his land.</p>

  <p>Whilst at Rudolfingen, the holy maiden was brought in contact with the
  Pietists of Schaffhausen. She attended their prayer-meetings and expositions
  of Scripture. This deepened her religious convictions, and produced a
  depression in her manner that struck her sisters when she visited them. In
  answer to their inquiries why she was reserved and melancholy, she replied
  that God was revealing Himself to her more and more every day, so that she
  became daily more conscious of her own sinfulness. If this had really been
  the case it would have saved her from what ensued, but this sense of her own
  sinfulness was a mere phrase, that meant actually an overweening
  self-consciousness. She endured only about a twelve month of the pietistic
  exercises at Schaffhausen, and then felt a call to preach, testify and
  prophesy herself, instead of sitting at the feet of others. Accordingly, she
  threw up her place with her uncle, and returned to Wildisbuch, in March,
  1817, when she began operations as a revivalist.</p>

  <p>The paternal household was now somewhat enlarged. The old farmer had taken
  on a hand to help him in field and stable, called Heinrich Ernst, and a young
  woman as maid called Margaret Jäggli. Ernst was a faithful, amiable young
  fellow whom old Peters thoroughly trusted, and he became devoted heart and
  soul to the family. Margaret Jäggli was a person of very indifferent
  character, who, for her immoralities, had been turned out of her native
  village. She was subject to epileptic fits, which she supposed were
  possession by the devil, and she came to the farm of the Peter's family in
  hopes of being there cured by the prayers of the saintly Margaretta.</p>

  <p>Another inmate of the house was Ursula Kündig, who entered it at the age
  of nineteen, and lived there as a veritable maid-of-all-work, though paid no
  wages. This damsel was of the sweetest, gentlest disposition. Her parish
  pastor gave testimony to her, "She was always so good that even
  scandal-mongers were unable to find occasion for slander in her conduct." Her
  countenance was full of intelligence, purity, and had in it a nobility above
  her birth and education. Her home had been unhappy; she had been engaged to
  be married to a young man, but finding that he did not care for her, and
  sought only her small property, she broke off the engagement, to her father's
  great annoyance. It was owing to a quarrel at home relative to this, that she
  went to Wildisbuch to entreat Margaretta Peter to be "her spiritual guide
  through life into eternity." Ursula had at first only paid occasional visits
  to Wildisbuch, but gradually these visits became long, and finally she took
  up her residence in the house. The soul of the unhappy girl was as wax in the
  hands of the saint, whom she venerated with intensest admiration as the Elect
  of the Lord; and she professed her unshaken conviction "that Christ revealed
  Himself in the flesh through her, and that through her many thousands of
  souls were saved." The house at Wildisbuch became thenceforth a great
  gathering place for all the spiritually-minded in the neighbourhood, who
  desired instruction, guidance, enlightenment, and Margaretta, the high
  priestess of mysticism to all such as could find no satisfaction for the
  deepest hunger of their souls in the Zwinglian services of their parish
  church.</p>

  <p>Man is composed of two parts; he has a spiritual nature which he shares
  with the angels, and an animal nature that he possesses in common with the
  beasts. There is in him, consequently, a double tendency, one to the
  indefinite, unconfined, spiritual; the other to the limited, sensible and
  material. The religious history of all times shows us this higher nature
  striving after emancipation from the law of the body, and never succeeding in
  accomplishing the escape, always falling back, like Dædalus, into
  destruction, when attempting to defy the laws of nature and soar too near to
  the ineffable light. The mysticism of the old heathen world, the mysticism of
  the Gnostic sects, the mysticism of mediæval heretics, almost invariably
  resolved itself into orgies of licentiousness. God has bound soul and body
  together, and an attempt to dissociate them in religion is fatally doomed to
  ruin.</p>

  <p>The incarnation of the Son of God was the indissoluble union of Spirit
  with form as the basis of true religion. Thenceforth, Spirit was no more to
  be dissociated from matter, authority from a visible Church, grace from a
  sacramental sign, morality from a fixed law. All the great revolts against
  Catholicism in the middle-ages, were more or less revolts against this
  principle and were reversions to pure spiritualism. The Reformation was taken
  advantage of for the mystic aspirations of men to run riot. Individual
  emotion became the supreme and sole criticism of right and wrong, of truth
  and falsehood, and sole authority to which submission must be tendered.</p>

  <p>In the autumn of 1817, Margaretta of Wildisbuch met a woman who was also
  remarkable in her way, and the head of another revivalist movement. This was
  Julianne von Krüdner; about whom a word must now be said.</p>

  <p>Julianne was born in 1766, at Riga, the daughter of a noble and wealthy
  family. Her father visited Paris and took the child with him, where she made
  the acquaintance of the rationalistic and speculative spirits of French
  society, before the Revolution. In a Voltairean atmosphere, the little
  Julianne grew up without religious faith or moral principle. At the age of
  fourteen she was married to a man much older than herself, the Baron von
  Krüdner, Russian Ambassador at Venice. There her notorious immoralities
  resulted in a separation, and Julianne was obliged to return to her father's
  house at Riga. This did not satisfy her love of pleasure and vanity, and she
  went to St. Petersburg and then to Paris, where she threw herself into every
  sort of dissipation. She wrote a novel, "Valérie," in which she frankly
  admitted that woman, when young, must give herself up to pleasure, then take
  up with art, and finally, when nothing else was left her, devote herself to
  religion. At the age of forty she had already entered on this final phase.
  She went to Berlin, was admitted to companionship with the Queen, Louise, and
  endeavoured to "convert" her. The sweet, holy queen required no conversion,
  and the Baroness von Krüdner was obliged to leave Berlin. She wandered
  thenceforth from place to place, was now in Paris, then in Geneva, and then
  in Germany. At Karlsruhe she met Jung-Stilling; and thenceforth threw herself
  heart and soul into the pietistic revival. Her mission now was&mdash;so she
  conceived&mdash;to preach the Gospel to the poor. In 1814 she obtained access
  to the Russian Court, where her prophecies and exhortations produced such an
  effect on the spirit of the Czar, Alexander I., that he entreated her to
  accompany him to Paris. She did so, and held spiritual conferences and prayer
  meetings in the French capital. Alexander soon tired of her, and she departed
  to Basel, where she won to her the Genevan Pastor Empeytaz and the Basel
  Professor Lachenal. Her meetings for revival, which were largely attended,
  caused general excitement, but led to many domestic quarrels, so that the
  city council gave her notice to leave the town. She then made a pilgrimage
  along the Rhine, but her proceedings were everywhere objected to by the
  police and town authorities, and she was sent back under police supervision
  first to Leipzig, and thence into Russia.</p>

  <p>Thence in 1824 she departed for the Crimea, where she had resolved to
  start a colony on the plan of the Moravian settlements, and there died before
  accomplishing her intention.</p>

  <p>It was in 1817, when she was conducting her apostolic progress along the
  Rhine, that she and Margaretta of Wildisbuch met. Apparently the latter made
  a deeper impression on the excitable baroness than had the holy Julianne on
  Margaretta. The two aruspices did not laugh when they met, for they were both
  in deadly earnest, and had not the smallest suspicion that they were deluding
  themselves first, and then others.</p>

  <p>The meeting with the Krüdner had a double effect. In the first place, the
  holy Julianne, when forced to leave the neighbourhood by the unregenerate
  police, commended her disciples to the blessed Margaret; and, in the second
  place, the latter had the shrewdness to perceive, that, if she was to play
  anything like the part of her fellow-apostle, she must acquire a little more
  education. Consequently Margaret took pains to write grammatically, and to
  spell correctly.</p>

  <p>The result of the commendation by Saint Julianne of her disciples to
  Margaret was that thenceforth a regular pilgrimage set in to Wildisbuch of
  devout persons in landaus and buggies, on horse and on foot.</p>

  <p>Some additional actors in the drama must now be introduced.</p>

  <p>Magdalena Peter, the fourth daughter of John Peter, was married to the
  cobbler, John Moser. The influence of Margaret speedily made itself felt in
  their house. At first Moser's old mother lived with the couple, along with
  Conrad, John Moser's younger brother. The first token of the conversion of
  Moser and his wife was that they kicked the old mother out of the house,
  because she was worldly and void of "saving grace." Conrad was a plodding,
  hard-working lad, very useful, and therefore not to be dispensed with. The
  chosen vessels finding he did not sympathise with them, and finding him too
  valuable to be done without, starved him till he yielded to their fancies,
  saw visions, and professed himself "saved." Barbara, also, married to the
  blacksmith Baumann, was next converted, and brought all her spiritual
  artillery to bear on the blacksmith, but in vain. He let her go her own way,
  but he would have nothing himself to say to the great spiritual revival in
  the house of the Peters. Barbara, not finding a kindred soul in her husband,
  had taken up with a man of like soaring piety, a tailor, named Hablützel.</p>

  <p>Another person who comes into this story is Jacob Ganz, a tailor, who had
  been mixed up with the movement at Basel under Julianne the Holy.</p>

  <p>Margaret's brother Caspar was a man of infamous character; he was
  separated from his wife, whom he had treated with brutality; had become the
  father of an illegitimate child, and now loafed about the country preaching
  the Gospel.</p>

  <p>Ganz, the tailor, had thrown aside his shears, and constituted himself a
  roving preacher. In one of his apostolic tours he had made the acquaintance
  of Saint Margaret, and had been deeply impressed by her. He had an elect
  disciple at Illnau, in the Kempthal, south of Winterthür. This was a
  shoemaker named Jacob Morf, a married man, aged thirty; small, with a head
  like a pumpkin. To this shoemaker Ganz spoke with enthusiasm of the spiritual
  elevation of the holy Margaret, and Morf was filled with a lively desire of
  seeing and hearing her.</p>

  <p>Margaretta seems after a while to have wearied of the monotony of life in
  her father's house, or else the spirit within her drove her abroad to carry
  her light into the many dark corners of her native canton. She resolved to be
  like Ganz, a roving apostle. Sometimes she started on her missionary journeys
  alone, sometimes along with her sister Elizabeth, who submitted to her with
  blind and stanch obedience, or else with Ursula Kündig. These journeys began
  in 1820, and extended as far Zürich and along the shores of that lovely lake.
  In May of the same year she visited Illnau, where she was received with
  enthusiasm by the faithful, who assembled in the house of a certain Ruegg,
  and there for the first time she met with Jacob Morf. The acquaintance then
  begun soon quickened into friendship. When a few weeks later he went to
  Schaffhausen to purchase leather, he turned aside to Wildisbuch. After this
  his visits there became not only frequent, but were protracted.</p>

  <p>Margaret was the greatest comfort to him in his troubled state of soul.
  She described to him the searchings and anxieties she had undergone, so that
  he cried "for very joy that he had encountered one who had gone through the
  same experience as himself."</p>

  <p>In November, 1820, Margaret took up her abode for some time in the house
  of a disciple, Caspar Notz, near Zürich, and made it the centre whence she
  started on a series of missionary excursions. Here also gathered the elect
  out of Zürich to hear her expound Scripture, and pray. And hither also came
  the cobbler Morf seeking ease for his troubled soul, and on occasions stayed
  in the house there with her for a week at a time. At last his wife, the
  worthy Regula Morf, came from Illnau to find her husband, and persuaded him
  to return with her to his cobbling at home.</p>

  <p>At the end of January in 1821, Margaret visited Illnau again, and drew
  away after her the bewitched Jacob, who followed her all the way home, to
  Wildisbuch, and remained at her father's house ten days further.</p>

  <p>On Ascension Day following, he was again with her, and then she revealed
  to him that it was the will of heaven that they should ascend together,
  without tasting death, into the mansions of the blessed, and were to occupy
  one throne together for all eternity. Throughout this year, when the cobbler,
  Jacob, was not at Wildisbuch, or Saint Margaretta at Illnau, the pair were
  writing incessantly to each other, and their correspondence is still
  preserved in the archives of Zürich. Here is a specimen of the style of the
  holy Margaret. "My dear child! your dear letter filled me with joy. O, my
  dear child, how gladly would I tell you how it fares with me! When we parted,
  I was forced to go aside where none might see, to relieve my heart with
  tears. O, my heart, I cannot describe to you the distress into which I fell.
  I lay as one senseless for an hour. For anguish of heart I could not go home,
  such unspeakable pains did I suffer! My former separation from you was but a
  shadow of this parting. O, why are you so unutterably dear to me, &amp;c.,"
  and then a flow of sickly, pious twaddle that makes the gorge rise.</p>

  <p>Regula Morf read this letter and shook her head over it. She had shaken
  her head over another letter received by her husband a month earlier, in
  which the holy damsel had written: "O, how great is my love! It is stronger
  than death. O, how dear are you to me. I could hug you to my heart a thousand
  times." And had scribbled on the margin, "These words are for your eye
  alone." However, Regula saw them, shook her head and told her husband that
  the letter seemed to her unenlightened mind to be very much like a
  love-letter. "Nothing of the sort," answered the cobbler, "it speaks of
  spiritual affection only."</p>

  <p>We must now pass over a trait in the life of the holy maid which is to the
  last degree unedifying, but which is merely another exemplification of that
  truth which the history of mysticism enforces in every age, that spiritual
  exaltation runs naturally, inevitably, into licentiousness, unless held in
  the iron bands of discipline to the moral law. A mystic is a law to himself.
  He bows before no exterior authority. However much he may transgress the code
  laid down by religion, he feels no compunction, no scruples, for his heart
  condemns him not. It was so with the holy Margaret. Her lapse or lapses in no
  way roused her to a sense of sin, but served only to drive her further
  forward on the mad career of self-righteous exaltation.</p>

  <p>She had disappeared for many months from her father's house, along with
  her sister Elizabeth. The police had inquired as to their whereabouts of old
  John Peter, but he had given them no information as to where his daughters
  were. He professed not to know. He was threatened unless they were produced
  by a certain day that he would be fined. The police were sent in search in
  every direction but the right one.</p>

  <p>Suddenly in the night of January 11th, 1823, the sisters re-appeared,
  Margaret, white, weak, and prostrate with sickness.</p>

  <p>A fortnight after her return, Jacob Morf was again at Wildisbuch, as he
  said afterwards before court, "led thither because assured by Margaret that
  they were to ascend together to heaven without dying."</p>

  <p>From this time forward, Margaretta's conduct went into another phase.
  Instead of resuming her pilgrim's staff and travelling round the country
  preaching the Gospel, she remained all day in one room with her sister
  Elizabeth, the shutters closed, reading the Bible, meditating, and praying,
  and writing letters to her "dear child" Jacob. The transgressions she had
  committed were crosses laid on her shoulder by God. "Oh! why," she wrote in
  one of her epistles, "did my Heavenly Father choose <i>that</i> from all
  eternity in His providence for me? There were thousands upon thousands of
  other crosses He might have laid on me. But He elected that one which would
  be heaviest for me, heavier than all the persecutions to which I am subjected
  by the devil, and which all but overthrow me. From the foundation of the
  world He has never so tried any of His saints as He has us. It gives joy to
  all the host of heaven when we suffer to the end." Again, "the greater the
  humiliation and shame we undergo, and have to endure from our enemies here
  below"&mdash;consider, brought on herself by her own scandalous
  conduct&mdash;"the more unspeakable our glorification in heaven."</p>

  <p>In the evening, Margaretta would come downstairs and receive visitors, and
  preach and prophesy to them. The entire house was given over to religious
  ecstasy that intensified as Easter approached. Every now and then the saint
  assembled the household and exhorted them to watch and pray, for a great
  trial of their faith was at hand. Once she asked them whether they were ready
  to lay down their lives for Christ. One day she said, in the spirit of
  prophecy, "Behold! I see the host of Satan drawing nearer and nearer to
  encompass me. He strives to overcome me. Let me alone that I may fight him."
  Then she flung her arms about and struck in the air with her open hands.</p>

  <p>The idea grew in her that the world was in danger, that the devil was
  gaining supremacy over it, and would carry all souls into captivity once
  more, and that she&mdash;and almost only she&mdash;stood in his way and was
  protecting the world of men against his power.</p>

  <p>For years she had exercised her authority, that grew with every year, over
  everyone in the house, and not a soul there had thought of resisting her, of
  evading the commands she laid on them, of questioning her word.</p>

  <p>The house was closed against all but the very elect. The pastor of the
  parish, as "worldly," was not suffered to cross the threshold. At a tap, the
  door was opened, and those deemed worthy were admitted, and the door hastily
  barred and bolted behind them. Everything was viewed in a spiritual light.
  One evening Ursula Kündig and Margaretta Jäggli were sitting spinning near
  the stove. Suddenly there was a pop. A knot in the pine-logs in the stove had
  exploded. But up sprang Jäggli, threw over her spinning-wheel, and shrieked
  out&mdash;"Hearken! Satan is banging at the window. He wants me. He will
  fetch me!" She fell convulsed on the floor, foaming at the mouth. Margaret,
  the saint, was summoned. The writhing girl shrieked out, "Pray for me! Save
  me! Fight for my soul!" and Margaretta at once began her spiritual exercises
  to ban the evil spirit from the afflicted and possessed servant maid. She
  beat with her hands in the air, cried out, "Depart, thou murderer of souls,
  accursed one, to hell-fire. Wilt thou try to rob me of my sheep that was
  lost? My sheep&mdash;whom I have pledged myself to save?"</p>

  <p>One day, the maid had a specially bad epileptic fit. Around her bed stood
  old John Peter, Elizabeth and Susanna, Ursula Kündig, and John Moser, as well
  as the saint. Margaret was fighting with the Evil One with her fists and her
  cries, when John Moser fell into ecstasy and saw a vision. His account shall
  be given in his own words: "I saw Christ and Satan, and the latter held a
  book open before Christ and bade Him see how many claims he had on the soul
  of Jäggli. The book was scored diagonally with red lines on all the pages. I
  saw this distinctly, and therefore concluded that the account was cancelled.
  Then I saw all the saints in heaven snatch the book away, and tear it into a
  thousand pieces that fell down in a rain."</p>

  <p>But Satan was not to be defeated and driven away so easily. He had made
  himself a nest, so Margaret stated, under the roof of the house, and only a
  desperate effort of faith and contest with spiritual arms could expel him.
  For this Armageddon she bade all prepare. It is hardly necessary to add that
  it could not be fought without the presence of the dearly beloved Jacob. She
  wrote to him and invited him to come to the great and final struggle with the
  devil and all his host, and the obedient cobbler girded his loins and
  hastened to Wildisbuch, where he arrived on Saturday the 8th March, 1823.</p>

  <p>On Monday, in answer, probably, to her summons, came also John Moser and
  his brother Conrad. Then also Margaret's own and only brother, Caspar.</p>

  <p>Before proceeding to the climax of this story we may well pause to ask
  whether the heroine was in her senses or not; whether she set the avalanche
  in motion that overwhelmed herself and her house, with deliberation and
  consciousness as to the end to which she was aiming. The woman was no vulgar
  impostor; she deceived herself to her own destruction. In her senses, so far,
  she had set plainly before her the object to which she was about to hurry her
  dupes, but her reason and intelligence were smothered under her overweening
  self-esteem, that had grown like a great spiritual cancer, till it had sapped
  common-sense, and all natural affection, even the very instinct of
  self-preservation. Before her diseased eyes, the salvation of the whole world
  depended on herself. If she failed in her struggle with the evil principle,
  all mankind fell under the bondage of Satan; but she could not fail&mdash;she
  was all-powerful, exalted above every chance of failure in the battle, just
  as she was exalted above every lapse in virtue, do what she might, which to
  the ordinary sense of mankind is immoral. Every mystic does not go as far as
  Margaret Peter, happily, but all take some strides along that road that leads
  to self-deification and <i>anomia</i>. In Margaret's conduct, in preparation
  for the final tragedy, there was a good deal of shrewd calculation; she led
  up to it by a long isolation and envelopment of herself and her doings in
  mystery; and she called her chosen disciples to witness it. Each stage in the
  drama was calculated to produce a certain effect, and she measured her
  influence over her creatures before she advanced another step. On Monday all
  were assembled and in expectation; Armageddon was to be fought, but when the
  battle would begin, and how it would be carried through, were unknown.
  Tuesday arrived; some of the household went about their daily work, the rest
  were gathered together in the room where Margaret was, lost in silent prayer.
  Every now and then the hush in the darkened room was broken by a wail of the
  saint: "I am sore straitened! I am in anguish!&mdash;but I refresh my soul at
  the prospect of the coming exaltation!" or, "My struggle with Satan is
  severe. He strives to retain the souls which I will wrest from his hold; some
  have been for two hundred, even three hundred years in his power."</p>

  <p>One can imagine the scene&mdash;the effect produced on those assembled
  about the pale, striving ecstatic. All who were present afterwards testified
  that on the Tuesday and the following days they hardly left the room, hardly
  allowed themselves time to snatch a hasty meal, so full of expectation were
  they that some great and awful event was about to take place. The holy
  enthusiasm was general, and if one or two, such as old Peter and his son,
  Caspar, were less magnetised than the rest, they were far removed from the
  thought of in any way contesting the will of the prophetess, or putting the
  smallest impediment in the way of her accomplishing what she desired.</p>

  <p>When evening came, she ascended to an upper room, followed by the whole
  company, and there she declared, "Lo! I see Satan and his first-born floating
  in the air. They are dispersing their emissaries to all corners of the earth
  to summon their armies together." Elizabeth, somewhat tired of playing a
  passive part, added, "Yes&mdash;I see them also." Then the holy maid relapsed
  into her mysterious silence. After waiting another hour, all went to bed,
  seeing that nothing further would happen that night. Next day, Wednesday, she
  summoned the household into her bedroom; seated on her bed, she bade them all
  kneel down and pray to the Lord to strengthen her hands for the great
  contest. They continued striving in prayer till noon, and then, feeling
  hungry, all went downstairs to get some food. When they had stilled their
  appetites, Margaret was again seized by the spirit of prophecy, and declared,
  "The Lord has revealed to me what will happen in the latter days. The son of
  Napoleon" (that poor, feeble mortal the Duke of Reichstadt) "will appear
  before the world as anti-Christ, and will strive to bring the world over to
  his side. He will undergo a great conflict; but what will be the result is
  not shown me at the present moment; but I am promised a spiritual token of
  this revelation." And the token followed. The dearly-loved Jacob, John Moser,
  and Ursula Kündig cried out that they saw two evil spirits, one in the form
  of Napoleon, pass into Margaret Jäggli, and the other, in that of his son,
  enter into Elizabeth. Whereupon Elizabeth, possessed by the spirit of that
  poor, little, sickly Duke of Reichstadt, began to march about the room and
  assume a haughty, military air. Thereupon the prophetess wrestled in spirit
  and overcame these devils and expelled them. Thereat Elizabeth gave up her
  military flourishes.</p>

  <p>From daybreak on the following day the blessed Margaret "had again a
  desperate struggle," but without the assistance of the household, which was
  summoned to take their share in the battle in the afternoon only. She bade
  them follow her to the upper chamber, and a procession ascended the steep
  stairs, consisting of Margaret, followed by Elizabeth and Susanna Peter,
  Ursula Kündig and Jäggli, the old father and his son, Caspar, the
  serving-man, Heinrich Ernst, then Jacob Morf, John Moser, and the rear was
  brought up by the young Conrad. As soon as the prophetess had taken her seat
  on the bed, she declared, "Last night it was revealed to me that you are all
  of you to unite with me in the battle with the devil, lest he should conquer
  Christ. I must strive, lest your souls and those of so many, many others
  should be lost. Come, then! strive with me; but first of all, kneel down, lay
  your faces in the dust and pray." Thereupon, all prostrated themselves on the
  floor and prayed in silence. Presently the prophetess exclaimed from her
  throne on the bed, "The hour is come in which the conflict must take place,
  so that Christ may gather together His Church, and contend with anti-Christ.
  After Christ has assembled His Church, 1260 days will elapse, and then
  anti-Christ will appear in human form, and with sweet and enticing words will
  strive to seduce the elect; but all true Christians will hold aloof." After a
  pause, she said solemnly, "In verity, anti-Christ is already among us."</p>

  <p>Then with a leap she was off the bed, turning her eyes about, throwing up
  her hands, rushing about the room, striking the chairs and clothes-boxes with
  her fists, crying, "The scoundrel, the murderer of souls!" And, finding a
  hammer, she began to beat the wall with it.</p>

  <p>The company looked on in breathless amaze. But the epileptic Jäggli went
  into convulsions, writhed on the ground, groaned, shrieked and wrung her
  hands. Then the holy Margaretta cried, "I see in spirit the old Napoleon
  gathering a mighty host, and marching against me. The contest will be
  terrible. You must wrestle unto blood. Go! fly! fetch me axes, clubs,
  whatever you can find. Bar the doors, curtain all the windows in the house,
  and close every shutter."</p>

  <p>Whilst her commands were being fulfilled in all haste, and the required
  weapons were sought out, John Moser, who remained behind, saw the room
  "filled with a dazzling glory, such as no tongue could describe," and wept
  for joy. The excitement had already mounted to visionary ecstasy. It was five
  o'clock when the weapons were brought upstairs. The holy Margaretta was then
  seated on her bed, wringing her hands, and crying to all to pray, "Help!
  help! all of you, that Christ may not be overcome in me. Strike, smite,
  cleave&mdash;everywhere, on all sides&mdash;the floor, the walls! It is the
  will of God! smite on till I bid you stay. Smite and lose your lives if need
  be."</p>

  <p>It was a wonder that lives were not lost in the extraordinary scene that
  ensued; the room was full of men and women; there were ten of them armed with
  hatchets, crowbars, clubs, pick-axes, raining blows on walls and floors, on
  chairs, tables, cupboards and chests. This lasted for three hours. Margaret
  remained on the bed, encouraging the party to continue; when any arm flagged
  she singled out the weary person, and exhorted him, as he loved his soul, to
  fight more valiantly and utterly defeat and destroy the devil. "Strike him!
  cut him down! the old adversary! the arch-fiend! whoso loseth his life shall
  find it. Fear nothing! smite till your blood runs down as sweat. There he is
  in yonder corner; now at him," and Elizabeth served as her echo, "Smite!
  strike on! He is a murderer, he is the young Napoleon, the coming
  anti-Christ, who entered into me and almost destroyed me."</p>

  <p>This lasted, as already said, for three hours. The room was full of dust.
  The warriors steamed with their exertions, and the sweat rolled off them.
  Never had men and women fought with greater enthusiasm. The battle of Don
  Quixote against the wind-mills was nothing to this. What blows and wounds the
  devil and the young Duke of Reichstadt obtained is unrecorded, but walls and
  floor and furniture in the room were wrecked; indeed pitchfork and axe had
  broken down one wall of the house and exposed what went on inside to the eyes
  of a gaping crowd that had assembled without, amazed at the riot that went on
  in the house that was regarded as a very sanctuary of religion.</p>

  <p>No sooner did the saint behold the faces of the crowd outside than she
  shrieked forth, "Behold them! the enemies of God! the host of Satan, coming
  on! But fear them not, we shall overcome."</p>

  <p>At last the combatants were no longer able to raise their arms or maintain
  themselves on their feet. Then Margaret exclaimed, "The victory is won!
  follow me!" She led them downstairs into the common sitting-room, where
  close-drawn curtains and fastened shutters excluded the rude gaze of the
  profane. Here a rushlight was kindled, and by its light the battle continued
  with an alteration in the tactics.</p>

  <p>In complete indifference to the mob that surrounded the house and
  clamoured at the door for admission, the saint ordered all to throw
  themselves on the ground and thank heaven for the victory they had won. Then,
  after a pause of more than an hour the same scene began again, and that it
  could recommence is evidence how much a man can do and endure, when possessed
  by a holy craze.</p>

  <p>It was afterwards supposed that the whole pious community was drunk with
  schnaps; but with injustice. Their stomachs were empty; it was their brains
  that were drunk.</p>

  <p>The holy Margaret, standing in the midst of the prostrate worshippers, now
  ordered them to beat themselves with their fists on their heads and breasts,
  and they obeyed. Elizabeth yelled, "O, Margaret! Do thou strike me! Let me
  die for Christ."</p>

  <p>Thereupon the holy one struck her sister repeatedly with her fists, so
  that Elizabeth cried out with pain, "Bear it!" exclaimed Margaret; "It is the
  wrath of God!"</p>

  <p>The prima-donna of the whole comedy in the meanwhile looked well about her
  to see that none of the actors spared themselves. When she saw anyone slack
  in his self-chastisement, she called to him to redouble his blows. As the old
  man did not exhibit quite sufficient enthusiasm in self-torture, she cried,
  "Father, you do not beat yourself sufficiently!" and then began to batter him
  with her own fists. The ill-treated old man groaned under her blows, but she
  cheered him with, "I am only driving out the old Adam, father! It does not
  hurt you," and redoubled her pommelling of his head and back. Then out went
  the light.</p>

  <p>All this while the crowd listened and passed remarks outside. No one would
  interfere, as it was no one's duty to interfere. Tidings of what was going on
  did, however, reach the amtmann of the parish, but he was an underling, and
  did not care to meddle without higher authority, so sent word to the amtmann
  of the district. This latter called to him his secretary, his constable and a
  policeman, and reached the house of the Peter's family at ten o'clock. In his
  report to the police at Zürich he says: "On the 13th about 10 o'clock at
  night I reached Wildisbuch, and then heard that the noise in the house of the
  Peter's family had ceased, that all lights were out, and that no one was
  stirring. I thought it advisable not to disturb this tranquillity, so left
  orders that the house should be watched," and then he went into the house of
  a neighbour. At midnight, the policeman who had been left on guard came to
  announce that there was a renewal of disturbance in the house of the Peters.
  The amtmann went to the spot and heard muffled cries of "Save us! have mercy
  on us! Strike away! he is a murderer! spare him not!" and a trampling, and a
  sound of blows, "as though falling on soft bodies." The amtmann knocked at
  the window and ordered those within to admit him. As no attention was paid to
  his commands, he bade the constable break open the house door. This was done,
  but the sitting-room door was now found to be fast barred. The constable then
  ascended to the upper room and saw in what a condition of wreckage it was. He
  descended and informed the amtmann of what he had seen. Again the window was
  knocked at, and orders were repeated that the door should be opened. No
  notice was taken of this; whereupon the worthy magistrate broke in a pane of
  glass, and thrust a candle through the window into the room.</p>

  <p>"I now went to the opened window, and observed four or five men standing
  with their backs against the door. Another lay as dead on the floor. At a
  little distance was a coil of human beings, men and women, lying in a heap on
  the floor, beside them a woman on her knees beating the rest, and crying out
  at every blow, 'Lord, have mercy!' Finally, near the stove was another
  similar group."</p>

  <p>The amtmann now ordered the sitting-room door to be broken open. Conrad
  Moser, who had offered to open to the magistrate, was rebuked by the saint,
  who cried out to him: "What, will you give admission to the devil?"</p>

  <p>"The men," says the magistrate in his report, "offered resistance excited
  thereto by the women, who continued screaming. The holy Margaret especially
  distinguished herself, and was on her knees vigorously beating another woman
  who lay flat on the floor on her face. A second group consisted of a coil of
  two men and two women lying on the floor, the head of one woman on the body
  of a man, and the head of a man on that of a girl. The rest staggered to
  their feet one after another. I tried remonstrances, but they were unavailing
  in the hubbub. Then I ordered the old Peter to be removed from the room.
  Thereupon men and women flung themselves upon him, in spite of all our
  assurances that no harm would be done him. With difficulty we got him out of
  the room, with all the rest hanging on him, so that he was thrown on the
  floor, and the rest clinging to him tumbled over him in a heap. I repeated my
  remonstrance, and insisted on silence, but without avail. When old Peter
  prepared to answer, the holy Margaret stayed him with, 'Father, make no
  reply. Pray!' All then recommenced the uproar. Margaret cried out: 'Let us
  all die! I will die for Christ!' Others called out, 'Lord, save us!' and
  others, 'Have mercy on us!'"</p>

  <p>The amtmann gave orders that the police were to divide the party and keep
  guard over some in the kitchen, and the rest in the sitting-room, through the
  night, and not to allow them to speak to each other. The latter order was,
  however, more than the police could execute. In spite of all their efforts,
  Margaretta and the others continued to exhort and comfort one another through
  the night.</p>

  <p>Next morning each was brought before the magistrate and subjected to
  examination. All were sullen, resolute, and convinced that they were doing
  God's will. As the holy Margaretta was led away from examination, she said to
  Ursula and the servant Heinrich, "The world opposes, but can not frustrate my
  work."</p>

  <p>Her words came true, the world was too slow in its movements. The amtmann
  did not send in his report to the authorities of Zürich till the 16th,
  whereupon it was taken into consideration, and orders were transmitted to him
  that Margaret and Elizabeth were to be sent to an asylum. It was then too
  late.</p>

  <p>After the investigation, the amtmann required the cobbler, John Morf, to
  march home to Illnau, John and Conrad Moser to return to their home, and
  Ursula Kündig to be sent back to her father. This command was not properly
  executed. Ursula remained, and though John Moser obeyed, he was prepared to
  return to the holy Margaret directly he was summoned.</p>

  <p>As soon as the high priestess had come out of the room where she had been
  examined by the amtmann, she went to her own bed-chamber, where boards had
  been laid over the gaps between the rafters broken by the axes and picks,
  during the night. Elizabeth, Susanna, Ursula, and the maid sat or stood round
  her and prayed.</p>

  <p>At eight o'clock, the father and his son, Caspar, rejoined her, also her
  eldest sister, Barbara, arrived from Trüllikon. The servant, Heinrich, formed
  one more in the re-assembled community, and the ensuing night was passed in
  prayer and spiritual exercises. These were not conducted in quiet. To the
  exhortations of Margaret, both Elizabeth and the housemaid entreated that the
  devil might be beaten out of them. But now Ursula interfered, as the poor
  girl Elizabeth had been badly bruised in her bosom by the blows she had
  received on the preceding night. When the Saturday morning dawned, Margaret
  stood up on her bed and said, "I see the many souls seeking salvation through
  me. They must be assisted; would that a sword were in my hand that I might
  fight for them." A little later she said, with a sigh of relief, "The Lamb
  has conquered. Go to your work."</p>

  <p>Tranquillity lasted for but a few hours. Magdalena, Moser's wife, had
  arrived, together with her husband and Conrad. The only one missing was the
  dearly beloved Jacob, who was far on his way homeward to Illnau and his
  hardly used wife, Regula.</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock, the old father, his five daughters, his son, the two
  brothers, John and Conrad Moser, Ursula Kündig, the maid Jäggli, and the man
  Heinrich Ernst, twelve in all, were assembled in the upper room.</p>

  <p>Margaret and Elizabeth sat side by side on the bed, the latter half
  stupified, looking fixedly before her, Margaret, however, in a condition of
  violent nervous surrexitation. Many of the weapons used in wrecking the
  furniture lay about; among these were the large hammer, and an iron wedge
  used for splitting wood. All there assembled felt that something
  extraordinary was about to happen. They had everyone passed the line that
  divides healthy common-sense from mania.</p>

  <p>Margaretta now solemnly announced, "I have given a pledge for many souls
  that Satan may not have them. Among these is the soul of my brother Caspar.
  But I cannot conquer in the strife for him without the shedding of blood."
  Thereupon she bade all present recommence beating themselves with their
  fists, so as to expel the devil, and they executed her orders with wildest
  fanaticism.</p>

  <p>The holy maid now laid hold of the iron wedge, drew her brother Caspar to
  her, and said, "Behold, the Evil One is striving to possess thy soul!" and
  thereupon she began to strike him on head and breast with the wedge. Caspar
  staggered back; she pursued him, striking him and cutting his head open, so
  that he was covered with blood. As he afterwards declared, he had not the
  smallest thought of resistance; the power to oppose her seemed to be taken
  from him. At length, half stunned, he fell to the ground, and was carried to
  his bed by his father and the maid Jäggli. The old man no more returned
  upstairs, consequently he was not present at the terrible scene that ensued.
  But he took no steps to prevent it. Not only so, but he warded off all
  interruption from without. Whilst he was below, someone knocked at the door.
  At that moment Susanna was in the room with him, and he bade her inquire who
  was without. The man gave his name as Elias Vogal, a mason, and asked leave
  to come in. Old Peter refused, as he said the surgeon was within. Elias
  endeavoured to push his way in but was resisted, and the door barred against
  him. Vogel went away, and meeting a policeman told him what had taken place,
  and added that he had noticed blood-stains on the sleeves of both old Peter
  and Susanna. The policeman, thinking that Peter's lie was truth, and that the
  surgeon was really in the house, and had been bleeding the half-crazy people
  there, took no further notice of what he had heard, and went his way.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the upper room the comedy had been changed into a ghastly
  tragedy. As soon as the wounded Caspar had been removed, the three sisters,
  Barbara, Magdalena, and Susanna left the room, the two latter, however, only
  for a short while. Then the holy Margaret said to those who remained with
  her, "To-day is a day of great events. The contest has been long and must now
  be decided. Blood must flow. I see the spirit of my mother calling to me to
  offer up my life." After a pause she said, "And you&mdash;all&mdash;are you
  ready to give your lives?" They all responded eagerly that they were. Then
  said Margaret, "No, no; I see you will not readily die. But I&mdash;I must
  die."</p>

  <p>Thereupon Elizabeth exclaimed, "I will gladly die for the saving of the
  souls of my brother and father. Strike me dead, strike me dead!" Then she
  threw herself on the bed and began to batter her head with a wooden
  mallet.</p>

  <p>"It has been revealed to me," said Margaret, "that Elizabeth will
  sacrifice herself." Then taking up the iron hammer, she struck her sister on
  the head. At once a spiritual fury seized on all the elect souls, and seizing
  weapons they began to beat the poor girl to death. Margaret in her mania
  struck at random about her, and wounded both John Moser and Ursula Kündig.
  Then she suddenly caught the latter by the wrist and bade her kill Elizabeth
  with the iron wedge. Ursula shrank back, "I cannot! I love her too dearly!"
  "You must," screamed the saint; "it is ordained." "I am ready to die" moaned
  Elizabeth. "I cannot! I cannot!" cried Ursula. "You must," shouted Margaret.
  "I will raise my sister again, and I also will rise again after three days.
  May God strengthen your arm."</p>

  <p>As though a demoniacal influence flowed out of the holy maid, and maddened
  those about her, all were again seized with frenzy. John Moser snatched the
  hammer out of her hand, and smote the prostrate girl with it again, and yet
  again, on head and bosom and shoulders. Susanna brought down a crow-bar
  across her body, the servant-man Heinrich belaboured her with a fragment of
  the floor planking, and Ursula, swept away by the current, beat in her skull
  with the wedge. Throughout the turmoil, the holy maid yelled: "God strengthen
  your arms! Ursula, strike home! Die for Christ, Elizabeth!" The last words
  heard from the martyred girl were an exclamation of resignation to the will
  of God, as expressed by her sister.</p>

  <p>One would have supposed that when the life was thus battered out of the
  unfortunate victim, the murderers would have come to their senses and been
  filled with terror and remorse. But it was not so. Margaret sat beside the
  body of her murdered sister, the blaze of spiritual ecstasy in her eyes, the
  blood-stained hammer in her right hand, terrible in her inflexible
  determination, and in the demoniacal energy which was to possess her to the
  last breath she drew. Her bosom heaved, her body quivered, but her voice was
  firm and her tone authoritative, as she said, "More blood must flow. I have
  pledged myself for the saving of many souls. I must die now. You must crucify
  me." John Moser and Ursula, shivering with horror, entreated, "O do not
  demand that of us." She replied, "It is better that I should die than that
  thousands of souls should perish."</p>

  <p>So saying she struck herself with the hammer on the left temple. Then she
  held out the weapon to John Moser, and ordered him and Ursula to batter her
  with it. Both hesitated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"What!" cried Margaret turning to her favourite disciple, "will you not do
  this? Strike and may God brace your arm!" Moser and Ursula now struck her
  with the hammer, but not so as to stun her.</p>

  <p>"And now," said she with raised voice, "crucify me! You, Ursula, must do
  the deed."</p>

  <p>"I cannot! I cannot!" sobbed the wretched girl.</p>

  <p>"What! will you withdraw your hand from the work of God, now the hour
  approaches? You will be responsible for all the souls that will be lost,
  unless you fulfil what I have appointed you to do."</p>

  <p>"But O! not I&mdash;!" pleaded Ursula.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;you. If the police authorities had executed me, it would not
  have fallen to you to do this, but now it is for you to accomplish the work.
  Go, Susan, and fetch nails, and the rest of you make ready the cross."</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Heinrich, the man-servant, frightened at what had taken
  place, and not wishing to have anything more to do with the horrible scene in
  the upper chamber, had gone quietly down into the wood-house, and was making
  stakes for the vines. There Susanna found him, and asked him for nails,
  telling him for what they were designed. He composedly picked her out nails
  of suitable length, and then resumed his work of making vine stakes. Susanna
  re-ascended to the upper room, and found Margaret extended on the bed beside
  the body of Elizabeth, with the arms, breast, and feet resting on blocks of
  wood, arranged, whilst Susanna was absent, by John Moser and Ursula, under
  her in the fashion of a cross.</p>

  <p>Then began the horrible act of crucifixion, which is only conceivable as
  an outburst of religious mania, depriving all who took part in it of every
  feeling of humanity, and degrading them to the level of beasts of prey. At
  the subsequent trial, both Ursula and John Moser described their condition as
  one of spiritual intoxication.</p>

  <p>The hands and feet of the victim were nailed to the blocks of wood. Then
  Ursula's head swam, and she drew back. Again Margaret called her to continue
  her horrible work. "Go on! go on! God strengthen your arm. I will raise
  Elizabeth from the dead, and rise myself in three days." Nails were driven
  through both elbows and also through the breasts of Margaret; not for one
  moment did the victim express pain, nor did her courage fail her. No Indian
  at the stake endured the cruel ingenuity of his tormentors with more stoicism
  than did this young woman bear the martyrdom she had invoked for herself. She
  impressed her murderers with the idea that she was endowed with supernatural
  strength. It could not be otherwise, for what she endured was beyond the
  measure of human strength. That in the place of human endurance she was
  possessed with the Berserker strength of the <i>furor religiosus</i>, was
  what these ignorant peasants could not possibly know. Conrad Moser could
  barely support himself from fainting, sick and horror-struck at the scene. He
  exclaimed, "Is not this enough?" His brother, John, standing at the foot of
  the bed, looked into space with glassy eyes. Ursula, bathed in tears, was
  bowed over the victim. Magdalena Moser had taken no active part in the
  crucifixion; she remained the whole time, weeping, leaning against a
  chest.</p>

  <p>The dying woman smiled. "I feel no pain. Be yourselves strong," she
  whispered. "Now, drive a nail or a knife through my heart."</p>

  <p>Ursula endeavoured to do as bidden, but her hand shook and the knife was
  bent. "Beat in my skull!" this was the last word spoken by Margaret. In their
  madness Conrad Moser and Ursula Kündig obeyed, one with the crowbar, the
  other with the hammer.</p>

  <p>It was noon when the sacrifice was accomplished&mdash;dinner-time.
  Accordingly, all descended to the sitting-room, where the meal that Margaret
  Jäggli had been in the meantime preparing was served and eaten.</p>

  <p>They had scarce finished before a policeman entered with a paper for old
  Peter to sign, in which he made himself answerable to produce his daughters
  before the magistrates when and where required. He signed it with composure,
  "I declare that I will cause my daughters, if in good health, to appear
  before the Upper Amtsmann in Andelfingen when so required." Then the
  policeman departed without a suspicion that the two girls were lying dead in
  the room above. On Sunday the 16th, the servant Heinrich was sent on
  horseback to Illnau to summon Jacob Morf to come to Wildisbuch and witness a
  great miracle. Jacob came there with Heinrich, but was not told the
  circumstances of the crucifixion till he reached the house. When he heard
  what had happened, he was frightened almost out of his few wits, and when
  taken upstairs to see the bodies, he fainted away. Nothing&mdash;no
  representations would induce him to remain for the miraculous resurrection,
  and he hastened back to Illnau, where he took to his bed. In his alarm and
  horror he sent for the pastor, and told him what he had seen.</p>

  <p>But the rest of the holy community remained stead-fast in their faith. On
  the night of Sunday before Monday morning broke, Ursula Kündig and the
  servant man Heinrich went upstairs with pincers and drew out the nails that
  transfixed Margaretta. When asked their reason for so doing, at the
  subsequent trial, they said that they supposed this would facilitate
  Margaretta's resurrection. <i>Sanctus furor</i> had made way for <i>sancta
  simplicitas</i>.</p>

  <p>The night of Monday to Tuesday was spent in prayer and Scripture-reading
  in the upper chamber, and eager expectation of the promised miracle, which
  never took place. The catastrophe could no longer be concealed. Something
  must be done. On Tuesday, old John Peter pulled on his jacket and walked to
  Trüllikon to inform the pastor that his daughter Elizabeth had died on the
  Saturday at 10 a.m., and his daughter Margaretta at noon of the same day.</p>

  <p>We need say little more. On Dec. 3rd, 1823, the trial of all incriminated
  in this frightful tragedy took place at Zürich and sentence was pronounced on
  the following day. Ursula Kündig was sentenced to sixteen years'
  imprisonment, Conrad Moser and John Peter to eight years, Susanna Peter and
  John Moser to six years, Heinrich Ernst to four years, Jacob Morf to three,
  Margaret Jäggli to two years, Barbara Baumann and Casper Peter to one year,
  and Magdalena Moser to six months with hard labour. The house at Wildisbuch
  was ordered to be levelled with the dust, the plough drawn over the
  foundation, and that no house should again be erected on the spot.</p>

  <p>Before the destruction, however, a pilgrimage of Pietists and believers in
  Margaret Peter had visited the scene of her death, and many had been the
  exclamations of admiration at her conduct. "Oh, that it had been I who had
  died!" "Oh, how many souls must she have delivered!" and the like. <i>Magna
  est stultitia et prævalebit.</i></p>

  <p>At a time like the present, when there is a wave of warm, mystic fever
  sweeping over the country, and carrying away with it thousands of ignorant
  and impetuous souls, it is well that the story&mdash;repulsive though it
  be&mdash;should be brought into notice, as a warning of what this spiritual
  excitement may lead to&mdash;not, indeed, again, maybe, into bloodshed. It is
  far more likely to lead to, as it has persistently, in every similar
  outbreak, into moral disorders, the record of which, in the case of
  Margaretta Peter, we have passed over almost without a word.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; A NORTHERN RAPHAEL</h2>

  <p class="first">HERE and there in the galleries of North Germany and Russia
  may be seen paintings of delicacy and purity, delicacy of colour and purity
  of design, the author of which was Gerhard von Kügelgen. The majority of his
  paintings are in private hands; but an Apollo, holding the dying Hyacinthus
  in his arms, is in the possession of the German Emperor; Moses on Horeb is in
  the gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts at Dresden; a St. Cæcilia and an
  Adonis, painted in 1794 and 1795, were purchased by the Earl of Bristol; a
  Holy Family is in the Gallery at Cassel; and some of the sacred subjects have
  found their way into churches.</p>

  <p>In 1772, the wife of Franz Kügelgen, a merchant of Bacharach on the Rhine,
  presented her husband with twin sons, the elder of whom by fifteen minutes is
  the subject of this notice. His brother was named Karl. Their resemblance was
  so great that even their mother found a difficulty in their early childhood
  in distinguishing one from the other.</p>

  <p>Bacharach was in the Electorate of Cologne, and when the
  Archbishop-Elector, Maximilian Franz, learned that the twins were fond of
  art, in 1791 he very liberally gave them a handsome sum of money to enable
  them to visit Rome and there prosecute their studies.</p>

  <p>Gerhard was at once fascinated by the statuary in the Vatican, and by the
  pictures of Raphael. The ambition of his life thenceforward was to combine
  the beauty of modelling of the human form that he saw in the Græco-Roman
  statues with the beauty of colour that he recognised in Raphael's canvases.
  Karl, on the other hand, devoted himself to landscapes.</p>

  <p>In 1795 the brothers separated, Gerhard that he might visit Munich.
  Thence, in the autumn, he went to Riga with a friend, and there he remained
  rather over two years, and painted and disposed of some fifty-four pictures.
  Then he painted in St. Petersburg and Revel, and finally settled into married
  life and regular work at Dresden in 1806. There he became a general
  favourite, not only on account of his artistic genius, but also because of
  the fascination of his modest and genial manner. He was honoured by the
  Court, and respected by everyone for his virtues. Orders flowed in on him,
  and his paintings commanded good prices. The king of Saxony ennobled him,
  that is to say, raised him out of the bürger-stand, by giving him the
  privilege of writing a <i>Von</i> before his patronymic.</p>

  <p>Having received an order from Riga for a large altar picture, he bought a
  vineyard on the banks of the Elbe, commanding a charming prospect of the
  river and the distant blue Bohemian mountains. Here he resolved to erect a
  country house for the summer, with a large studio lighted from the north. The
  construction of this residence was to him a great pleasure and occupation. In
  November, 1819, he wrote to his brother, "My house shall be to us a veritable
  fairy palace, in which to dwell till the time comes, when through a little,
  narrow and dark door we pass through into that great habitation of the
  Heavenly Father in which are many mansions, and where our whole family will
  be re-united. Should it please God to call me away, then Lily (his wife) will
  find this an agreeable dower-house, in which she can supervise the education
  of the children, as the distance from the town is only an hour's walk."</p>

  <p>The words were written, perhaps, without much thought, but they
  foreshadowed a terrible catastrophe. Kügelgen would pass, before his fairy
  palace was ready to receive him, through that little, narrow door into the
  heavenly mansions.</p>

  <p>The holy week of 1820 found him in a condition of singularly deep
  religious emotion. He was a Catholic, but had, nevertheless, allowed his son
  to be confirmed by a Protestant pastor. The ceremony had greatly affected
  him, and he said to a friend, who was struck at the intensity of his feeling,
  "I know I shall never be as happy again till I reach Heaven."</p>

  <p>On March 27th, on the very day of the confirmation, he went in the
  afternoon a walk by himself to his vineyard, to look at his buildings. He
  invited one of his pupils to accompany him, but the young man had some
  engagement and declined.</p>

  <p>At 5 p.m. he was at the new house, where he paid the workmen, gave some
  instructions, and pointed out where he would do some planting, so as to
  enchance the picturesqueness of the spot. At some time between six and seven
  he left, to walk back to Dresden, along the road from Bautzen.</p>

  <p>Every one who has been at the Saxon capital knows that road. The right
  bank of the Elbe above Dresden rises in picturesque heights covered with
  gardens and vineyards, from the river, and about a mile from the bridge is
  the Linkes Bad, with its pleasant gardens, theatre, music and baths. That
  road is one of the most charming, and, therefore, the most frequented outside
  the capital. On the evening in question the Easter moon was shining.</p>

  <p>Kügelgen did not return home. His wife sent his son, the just confirmed
  boy, aged 17 years, to the new house, to inquire for her husband. The boy
  learned there that he had left some hours before. He returned home, and found
  that still his father had not come in. The police were communicated with, and
  the night was spent in inquiries and search, but all in vain. On the
  following morning, at 9 a.m., as the boy was traversing the same road, along
  with a gensdarme, he deemed it well to explore a footpath beside the river,
  which was overflown by the Elbe, and there, finally, amongst some reeds they
  discovered the dead body of the artist, stripped of his clothes to his shirt
  and drawers, lying on his face.</p>

  <p>Gerhard von Kügelgen had been murdered. His features were cut and bruised,
  his left temple and jaw were broken. Footsteps, as of two persons, were
  traceable through the river mud and across a field to the highway. Apparently
  the artist had been murdered on the road, then carried or dragged to the
  path, stripped there, and then cast among the rushes. About twenty-four paces
  from where he lay, between him and the highway, his cap was found.</p>

  <p>The excitement, the alarm, aroused in Dresden was immense. Not only was
  Kügelgen universally respected, but everyone was in dismay at the thought
  that his own safety was jeopardised, if a murder such as this could be
  perpetrated on the open road, within a few paces of the gates. Indeed, the
  place where the crime was committed was but a hundred strides from the Linkes
  Bad, one of the most popular resorts of the Dresdeners.</p>

  <p>It was now remembered that only a few months before, near the same spot,
  another murder had been committed, that had remained undiscovered. In that
  case the victim had been a poor carpenter's apprentice.</p>

  <p>On the same day as the body of Kügelgen was found, the Government offered
  a sum equal to £150 for the discovery of the murderer. A little later, some
  children found among the rubbish, outside the Black Gate of the Dresdener
  Vorstadt, a blue cloth cloak, folded up and buried under some stones. It was
  recognised as having belonged to Kügelgen. Moreover, in the pocket was the
  little "Thomas-à-Kempis" he always carried about with him.</p>

  <p>It was concluded that the murderer had not ventured to bring all the
  clothing of Kügelgen into the town, through the gate, and had, therefore,
  hidden portions in places whence he could remove them one by one, unobserved.
  The murderer was, undoubtedly, an inhabitant of the city.</p>

  <p>From March 29th to April 4th the police remained without any clue,
  although a description of the garments worn by the murdered man, and of his
  watch, was posted up at every corner, and sent round to the nearest towns and
  villages.</p>

  <p>The workmen who had been engaged on Kügelgen's house were brought before
  the police. They had left after his departure, and had received money from
  him; but they were discharged, as there was no evidence against them.</p>

  <p>As no light seemed to fall on this mysterious case, the police looked up
  the circumstances of the previous murder. On December 29th, 1819, a carrier
  on the highroad had found a body on the way. It was ascertained to be that of
  a carpenter's apprentice, named Winter. His skull had been broken in. Not a
  trace of the murderer was found; not even footprints had been observed.
  However, it was learned that the wife of a labourer had been attacked almost
  at the same spot, on the 28th December, by a man wearing a military cap and
  cloak; and she had only escaped him by the approach of a carriage, the sound
  of the wheels having alarmed him, and induced him to fly. He had fled in the
  direction of the Black Gate and the barracks.</p>

  <p>The anxiety of the Dresdeners seemed justified. There was some murderous
  ruffian inhabiting the Vorstadt, who hovered about the gates, waylaying, not
  wealthy men only, but poor charwomen and apprentices.</p>

  <p>The military cloak and cap, the direction taken by the assailant in his
  flight, gave a sort of clue&mdash;and the police suspected that the murderer
  must be sought among the soldiers.</p>

  <p>On April 4th two Jewish pawnbrokers appeared before the police, and handed
  over a silver watch which had been left with them at 9 a.m. on the 20th
  March&mdash;that is to say on the morning after the murder of
  Kügelgen&mdash;and which agreed with the advertised description of the
  artist's lost watch. It was identified at once. The man who had pawned it,
  the Jews said, wore the uniform of an artillery soldier.</p>

  <p>At the request of the civil authorities, the military officers held an
  inquisition in the barracks. All the artillery soldiers were made to pass
  before the Jew brokers, but they were unable to identify the man who had
  deposited the watch with them. Somewhat later in the day one of these Jews,
  as he was going through the street, saw a man in civil dress, whom he thought
  he recognised as the fellow who had given him the watch. He went up to him at
  once and spoke about the watch. The man at first acknowledged that he had
  pawned one, then denied, and threatened the Jew when he persevered in
  clinging to him. A gendarme came up, and hearing what the controversy was
  about, arrested the man, who gave his name as Fischer, a gunner.</p>

  <p>Fischer was at once examined, and he doggedly refused to allow that he had
  given up a watch to the Jew.</p>

  <p>Suspicion against him was deepened by his declaring that he had heard
  nothing of the murder&mdash;a matter of general talk in Dresden&mdash;and
  that he had not seen the notices with the offer of reward for the discovery
  of the murderer. On the following day, April 5th, however, he admitted having
  pawned the watch, which he pretended to have found outside the Black Gate. A
  few hours later he withdrew this confession, saying that he was so bewildered
  with the questions put to him, and so alarmed at his arrest, that he did not
  well know what he said. It was observed that Fischer was a man of very low
  intellectual power.</p>

  <p>The same day he was invested in his uniform, and presented before the
  pawnbrokers. Both unanimously declared that he was <i>not</i> the man who had
  entered their shop and deposited the watch with them. They both declared that
  though Fischer had the same height and general build as the man in question,
  and the same fair hair, yet that the face was different.</p>

  <p>With this, the case against Fischer broke down; nevertheless, though he
  had been handed over by the military authorities to the civil power, he
  remained under arrest. The public was convinced of his guilt, and the police
  hoped by keeping him in prison to draw from him later some information which
  might prove serviceable.</p>

  <p>And, in fact, after he had been a fortnight under arrest, he volunteered a
  statement. He was conducted at once before the magistrate, and confessed that
  he had murdered Von Kügelgen. He, however, stoutly denied having laid hands
  on the carpenter Winter. Nevertheless, on the way back to his cell he told
  his gaoler that he had committed this murder as well. Next day he was again
  brought before the magistrate, and confessed to both murders. He was taken to
  the spots where the two corpses had been found, and there he renewed his
  confession, though without entering into any details.</p>

  <p>But on the next morning, April 21, he begged to be again heard, and he
  then asserted that his former confessions were false. He had confessed merely
  because he was weary of his imprisonment and the poor food he was given, and
  decided to die. When spoken to by the magistrates seriously, and remonstrated
  with for his contradictions, he cried out that he was innocent. Let them
  torture him as much as they pleased, he wished to die.</p>

  <p>But hardly was he back in his prison than he told the gaoler that it was
  true that he was the murderer of both Kügelgen and Winter. Again he confessed
  before the magistrate, and again, on the 27th, withdrew his confession and
  protested his innocence.</p>

  <p>On the 21st April a new element in the case came to light, that perplexed
  the question not a little.</p>

  <p>A Jewish pawnbroker, Löbel Graff, announced that on February 3, 1820, he
  had received from the gunner Kaltofen, a green coat, and on the 4th April a
  dark-blue cloth coat, stained with spots of oil, also a pair of cloth
  trousers. As both coats seemed to him suspicious, and to resemble those
  described in the advertisements, he had questioned Kaltofen about them, but
  had received equivocal answers, and Kaltofen at last admitted that he had
  bought them from the gunner Fischer.</p>

  <p>John Gottfried Kaltofen was a young man of 24 years, servant to one of the
  officers, and therefore did not live in the barracks. He was now taken up.
  His manner and appearance were in his favour. He was frank, and at once
  admitted that he had disposed of the two coats to Graff, and that he had
  bought them of Fischer. On confrontation with the latter he repeated what he
  had said. Fischer fell into confusion, denied all knowledge of Kaltofen,
  protested his innocence, and denied the sale of the coats, one of which had
  in the meantime been identified as having belonged to Winter, and the other
  to Kügelgen.</p>

  <p>On April 27th a search was made in the lodgings of Kaltofen, and three
  keys were found there, hidden away, and these proved to have belonged to
  Kügelgen. At first Kaltofen declared that he knew nothing of these keys, but
  afterwards said that he remembered on consideration that he had found them in
  the pocket of the blue coat he had purchased from Fischer, and had put them
  away before disposing of the coat, and had given them no further thought. Not
  many minutes after Fischer had been sent back to prison, he begged to be
  brought before the magistrate again, and now admitted that it was quite true
  that he had sold both coats to Kaltofen.</p>

  <p>Whilst this confession was being taken down, however, he again hesitated,
  broke down, and denied having sold them to Kaltofen, or any one else. "I
  can't say anything more," he cried out; "my head is dazed."</p>

  <p>By this statement he remained, protesting his innocence, and he declared
  that he had only confessed his guilt because he was afraid of ill-treatment
  in the prison if he continued to assert his innocence. It must be remembered
  that the gaolers were as convinced of his guilt as were the public of
  Dresden; and it is noticeable that under pressure from them Fischer always
  acknowledged his guilt; whereas, when before the magistrates he was ready to
  proclaim that he was innocent. At this time it was part of the duty of a
  gaoler, or was supposed to be such, to use every possible effort to bring a
  prisoner to confession. And now, on April 27th, a third gunner appeared on
  the scene. His name was Kiessling, and he asked the magistrate to take down
  his statement, which was to the effect that Kaltofen, who had been
  discharged, had admitted to him that he had murdered Kügelgen with a cudgel,
  and that he had still got some of his garments hidden in his lodgings.
  But&mdash;so said Kiessling&mdash;Kaltofen had jauntily said he would lay it
  all on Fischer. Kiessling, moreover, produced a pair of boots, that he said
  Kaltofen had left with him to be re-soled, as he was regimental shoemaker.
  And these boots were at once recognised as having been those worn by Kügelgen
  when he was murdered.</p>

  <p>Kaltofen was at once re-arrested, and brought into confrontation with
  Kiessling. He retained his composure, and said that it was quite true that he
  had given a pair of boots to Kiessling to re-sole, but they were a pair that
  he had bought in the market. But, in the meantime, another investigation of
  his lodgings had been made, and a number of articles found that had certainly
  belonged to the murdered men, Winter and Kügelgen. They were ranged on the
  table, together with the pair of boots confided to Kiessling, and Kaltofen
  was shown them. Hitherto, the young man had displayed phlegmatic composure,
  and an openness of manner that had impressed all who saw him in his favour.
  His intelligence, had, moreover, contrasted favourably with that of Fischer.
  But the sight of all these articles, produced before him, staggered Kaltofen,
  and, losing his presence of mind, he turned in a fury upon his comrade, the
  shoemaker, and swore at him for having betrayed his confidence. Only after he
  had poured forth a torrent of abuse, could the magistrate bring him to say
  anything about the charge, and then&mdash;still hot and panting from his
  onslaught on Kiessling&mdash;he admitted that he, not Fischer, was the
  murderer in both cases. Fischer, he said, was wholly innocent, not only of
  participation in, but of knowledge of the crimes. The summary of his
  confession, oft repeated and never withdrawn, was as follows:&mdash;Being in
  need of money, he had gone outside the town thrice in one week, at the end of
  December, 1819, with the intent of murdering and robbing the first person he
  could attack with security. For this purpose, he had provided himself with a
  cudgel under his cloak. On the 29th December he selected Winter as his first
  victim. He allowed him to pass, then stole after him, and suddenly dealt him
  a blow on the back of his head, before the young man turned to see who was
  following him. Winter dropped, whereupon he, Kaltofen, had struck him twice
  again on the head. Then he divested his victim of collar, coat, hat,
  kerchief, watch, and a little money&mdash;not more than four shillings in
  English coins, and a few tools. He was engaged on pulling off his boots and
  trousers, when he was alarmed by hearing the tramp of horses and the sound of
  wheels, and he ran off across the fields with his spoil. He got Kiessling to
  dispose of the hat for him, the other articles he himself sold to Jews.
  Whether it was he also who assaulted the poor woman we are not informed. In
  like manner Kaltofen proceeded with Kügelgen. He was again in want of money.
  He had been gambling, and had lost what little he had. On the Monday in Holy
  Week, 1820, he took his cudgel again and went out along the Bautzen Road. The
  moon shone brightly, and he met a gentleman walking slowly towards Dresden,
  in a blue cloak. He allowed him to pass, then followed him. As a woman was
  walking in the same direction, but at a quicker rate, he delayed his purpose
  till she had disappeared behind the first houses of the suburb. Then he
  hastened on, walking lightly, and springing up behind Kügelgen, struck him on
  the right temple with his cudgel from behind. Kügelgen fell without uttering
  a cry. Kaltofen at once seized him by the collar and dragged him across a
  field to the edge of the river. There he dealt him several additional blows,
  and then proceeded to strip him. Whilst thus engaged, he remembered that the
  dead man had dropped his walking-stick on the high road when first struck.
  Kaltofen at once desisted from what he was about, to return to the road and
  recover the walking-stick. On coming back to his victim, he thought there was
  still life in him; Kügelgen was moving and endeavouring to rise. Whereupon,
  with his cudgel, Kaltofen repeatedly struck him, till all signs of life
  disappeared. He now completed his work of spoliation, pulled off the boots,
  untied the neckerchief, and ransacked the pockets. He found in addition to
  the watch the sum of about half-a-guinea. He then stole away among the rushes
  till he reached the Linkes Bad, where he returned to the main road. He
  concealed the cloak at the Black Gate, but carried the rest of his plunder to
  his lodgings.</p>

  <p>His confession was confirmed by several circumstances. Kiessling was again
  required to repeat what he had heard from Kaltofen, and the story as told by
  him agreed exactly with that now confessed by the murderer. Kiessling added
  that Kaltofen had told him he was puzzled to account for Fischer's
  self-examination, as he knew that the man had nothing to do with the murder.
  A third examination of Kaltofen's lodgings resulted in the discovery of all
  the rest of the murdered man's effects. Moreover, when Kaltofen was
  confronted with the two Jews who had taken the silver watch on the 24th, they
  immediately recognised him as the man who had disposed of it to them.</p>

  <p>Finally, he confessed to having been associated with Kiessling in two
  robberies, one of which was a burglarious attack on his own master.</p>

  <p>The case was made out clearly enough against Kaltofen, and it seemed
  equally clear that Fischer was innocent. Moreover, from the 24th April
  onwards, Fischer never swerved from his protestation of complete innocence.
  When questioned why he had confessed himself guilty, he said that he had been
  pressed to do so by the gaoler, who had several times fastened him for a
  whole night into the stocks, and had threatened him with severer measures
  unless he admitted his guilt. The gaoler admitted having so treated Fischer
  once, but Fischer insisted that he had been thus tortured on two consecutive
  nights.</p>

  <p>It was ascertained that Fischer had not only known about the murder of
  Kügelgen, but had attended his funeral, and yet he had pretended entire, or
  almost entire, ignorance when first arrested. When asked to explain this, he
  replied that he was so frightened that he took refuge in lies. That he was a
  dull-minded, extremely ignorant man, was obvious to the judges and to all who
  had to do with him; he was aged thirty, and had spent thirteen years in the
  army, had conducted himself well, but had never been trusted with any
  important duties on account of his stupidity. He had a dull eye, and a heavy
  countenance. Kaltofen, on the other hand, was a good-looking, well-built
  young fellow, of twenty-four, with a bright, intelligent face; his education
  was above what was ordinary in his class. It was precisely this that had
  excited in him vanity, and craving for pleasures and amusements which he
  could not afford. His obliging manners, his trimness, and cheerfulness, had
  made him a favourite with the officers.</p>

  <p>As already intimated, he was fond of play, and it was this that had
  induced him to commit his murders. He admitted that he had felt little or no
  compunction, and he said frankly that it was as well for society that he was
  taken, otherwise the death of Kügelgen would have been followed by others. He
  spoke of the crimes he had committed with openness and indifference, and
  maintained this condition of callousness to the end. It seems to have been
  customary on several occasions for the Lutheran pastors who attended the last
  hours of criminals to publish their opinions as to the manner in which they
  prepared for death, and their ideas as to the motives for the crimes
  committed, an eminently indecent proceeding to our notions. In this case, the
  chaplain who attended on Kaltofen rushed into the priest after the execution.
  He said, "Play may have occasioned that want of feeling which will commit the
  most atrocious crime, without compunction, for the gratification of a
  temporary requirement. Kaltofen, without being rude and rough towards his
  fellows, but on the contrary obliging and courteous, came to regard them with
  brutal indifference." Only twice did he feel any twinge of conscience, he
  said, once before his first murder, and again at the funeral of his second
  victim, which he attended. The criminal was now known, had confessed, and had
  confessed that he had no accomplice. Moreover, he declared that Fischer was
  wholly innocent. Not a single particle of evidence was forthcoming to
  incriminate Fischer, apart from his own retracted confessions. Nevertheless
  he was not liberated.</p>

  <p>The police could not believe that Kaltofen had been without an accomplice.
  There were stabs in the face and body of Kügelgen, and Kaltofen had professed
  to have used no other weapon than a cudgel. The murderer said that he had
  dragged the body over the field to the rushes, and it was agreed that there
  must have been evidence of this dragging. Some witnesses had, indeed, said
  they had seen such, but others protested that there were footprints as of two
  men. This, however, could be explained by Kaltofen's admission that he had
  gone back to the road for the walking-stick.</p>

  <p>Then, again, Fischer, when interrogated, had given particulars which
  agreed with the circumstances in a remarkable manner. He was asked to explain
  this. "Well," said he, "he had heard a good deal of talk about the murders,
  and he was miserable at the thought of spending long years in prison, and so
  had confessed." When asked how he knew the particulars of the murder of
  Winter, he said that he had been helped to it by the gaoler. He had said
  first, "I went to his left side"&mdash;whereupon the gaoler had said, "Surely
  you are wrong, it was on the right," thereat Fischer had corrected himself
  and said, "Yes, of course&mdash;on the right."</p>

  <p>The case was now ready for final sentence, and for this purpose all the
  depositions were forwarded on September 12th to the Judicial Court at
  Leipzig. But, before judgment was pronounced, the depositions were hastily
  sent for back to Dresden&mdash;for, in the meantime, the case had passed into
  a new phase. On October 5th, the gaoler&mdash;the same man who had brought
  about the confession of Fischer&mdash;announced that Kaltofen had confided to
  him that Fischer really had been his accomplice in both the murders. Kaltofen
  at once was summoned before the magistrate, and he calmly, and with emphasis,
  declared that Fischer had assisted him on both occasions, and that he had not
  allowed this before, because he and Fischer had sworn that neither would
  betray the other. Fischer had never mentioned his name, and he had
  accordingly done his utmost to exculpate Fischer.</p>

  <p>According to his account, he and Fischer had been walking together on the
  morning of March 26th, between 9 and 10, when they planned a murder together
  for the following day. However, there was rebutting evidence to the effect
  that on the morning in question Fischer had been on guard, at the hour named,
  before the powder magazine; he had not been released till noon. Other
  statements of Kaltofen proved to be equally untrue.</p>

  <p>What could have induced Kaltofen to deliberately charge a comrade in arms
  with participation in the crime, if he were guiltless? There was no apparent
  motive. He could gain no reprieve by it. It did not greatly diminish his own
  guilt.</p>

  <p>It was necessary to enter into as close investigation as was possible into
  the whereabouts of Fischer at the time of the two murders. It was not found
  possible to determine where he was at the time when Winter was killed, but
  some of his comrades swore that on March 27th he had been present at the
  roll-call at 6 p.m., and had come into barrack before the second roll-call at
  half-past eight. The murder of Kügelgen had taken place at eight o'clock, and
  the distance between the barrack and the spot where it had been committed was
  3487 paces, which would take a man about 25 minutes to traverse. If, as his
  comrades asserted, Fischer had come in shortly after eight, then it was quite
  impossible that he could have been present when Kügelgen was murdered; but
  not great reliance can be placed on the testimony of soldiers as to the hour
  at which a comrade came into barrack just seven months before on a given
  day.</p>

  <p>The case was perplexing. The counsel for Fischer&mdash;his name was
  Eisenstück&mdash;took a bold line of defence. He charged the gaoler with
  having manipulated Kaltofen, as he had Fischer. This gaoler's self-esteem was
  wounded by the discovery that Kaltofen and not Fischer was the murderer, and
  his credit was damaged by the proceedings which showed that he had goaded an
  unhappy man, confided to his care, into charging himself with a crime he had
  never committed. Eisenstück asserted that this new charge was fabricated in
  the prison by the gaoler in concert with Kaltofen for his own justification.
  But, whatever may be thought of the character and conduct of this turnkey, it
  is difficult to understand how he could prevail on a cool-headed man like
  Kaltofen thus to take on himself the additional guilt of perjury, and such
  perjury as risked the life of an innocent man. Kaltofen never withdrew this
  assertion that Fischer was an accomplice. He persisted in it to his last
  breath.</p>

  <p>The depositions were again sent to the faculty at Leipzig, on Dec. 18th,
  to give judgment on the following points.</p>

  <p>1. The examination of the body of Kügelgen had revealed stabs made with a
  sharp, two-edged instrument, as well as blows dealt by a blunt weapon.
  Kaltofen would admit that he had used no other instrument than a cudgel.</p>

  <p>2. It would have been a difficult matter for one man to drag a dead body
  from the road to the bed of rushes, without leaving unmistakable traces on
  the field traversed; and such were not, for certain, found. It was therefore
  more probable that the dead man had been carried by two persons to the place
  where found.</p>

  <p>It must be observed that crowds poured out of Dresden to see the place
  where the body lay as soon as it was known that Kügelgen had been discovered,
  and consequently no accurate and early examination of tracks across the field
  had been made.</p>

  <p>3. That it would have been difficult for Kaltofen alone to strip the body.
  This may be doubted; it would be difficult possibly, but not impossible,
  whilst the body was flexible.</p>

  <p>4. A witness had said that she had met two men outside the Black Gate on
  the evening of the 27th March, of whom one was wrapped in a cloak and seemed
  to be carrying something under it. We should much like to know when the woman
  gave this evidence. Unfortunately, that is what is not told us.</p>

  <p>5. Kaltofen, in a letter to his parents, had stated that he had an
  accomplice, but had not named him.</p>

  <p>These were the points that made it appear that Kaltofen had an accomplice.
  An accomplice in some of his crimes he had&mdash;Kiessling.</p>

  <p>There were other points that made it appear that Fischer had assisted him
  in the murders.</p>

  <p>6. Fischer's denial that he knew anything about the murder of Kügelgen
  when he was arrested, whereas it was established that he had attended the
  funeral of the murdered man.</p>

  <p>7. His repeated confessions that he had assisted at the murders, and his
  acquaintance with the particulars and with the localities.</p>

  <p>8. Kaltofen's asseverations that Fischer was his associate in the
  murders.</p>

  <p>In favour of Fischer it may be said that his conduct in the army had for
  thirteen years been uniformly good, and there was no evidence that he had
  been in any way guilty of dishonesty. Nor was he a man of extravagant habits
  like Kaltofen, needing money for his pleasures. He was a simple, inoffensive,
  and very stupid man. His confessions lose all their effect when we consider
  how they were extorted from him by undue influence.</p>

  <p>Against Kaltofen's later accusation must be set his repeated declaration,
  during six months, that Fischer was innocent. Not only this, but his
  assertion in confidence to Kiessling that he was puzzled what could have
  induced Fischer to avow himself guilty of a crime, of which
  he&mdash;Kaltofen&mdash;knew him to be innocent. When Kiessling gave this
  evidence on April 24th, Kaltofen did not deny that he had said this, but flew
  into a paroxysm of fury with his comrade for betraying their private
  conversation.</p>

  <p>Again, not a single article appertaining to either of the murdered men was
  found with Fischer. All had been traced, without exception, to Kaltofen. It
  was the latter who had concealed Kügelgen's coat, and had given his watch to
  the Jews. It was he who had got Kiessling to dispose of Winter's hat for him,
  and had given the boots of the last victim to Kiessling to be repaired.</p>

  <p>On January 4th, 1821, the Court at Leipzig issued its judgment; that
  Kaltofen, on account of two murders committed and confessed, was to be put to
  death on the wheel; "but that John George Fischer be discharged on account of
  lack of evidence of complicity in the murders." The gaoler was discharged his
  office.</p>

  <p>Kaltofen appealed against the sentence, but in vain. The sentence was
  confirmed. The ground of his appeal was, that he was not alone guilty. The
  King commuted the penalty of the wheel into execution by the sword.</p>

  <p>The sentence of the court produced the liveliest commotion in Dresden. The
  feeling against Fischer was strong and general; the gaoler had but
  represented the universal opinion. Fischer&mdash;who had confessed to the
  murder&mdash;Fischer, whom Kaltofen protested was as deeply stained in crime
  as himself, was to go scot free. The police authorities did not carry out the
  sentence of discharge in its integrity; they indeed released him from prison,
  but placed him under police supervision, and he was discharged from the
  Artillery on the plea that he had forsworn himself. The pastor Jaspis was
  entrusted with the preparation of Kaltofen for death; and we know pretty well
  what passed between him and the condemned man, as he had the indecency to
  publish it to the world. Jaspis had, indeed, visited him in prison when he
  was first arrested, and then Kaltofen had asserted that he had committed the
  murders entirely unassisted. On Jaspis remarking to him in April, 1820, that
  there were circumstances that rendered this eminently improbable, Kaltofen
  cut him short with the answer, "I was by myself." Afterwards, when he had
  changed his note, Jaspis reminded him of his previous declaration, but
  Kaltofen pretended not to remember ever having made it.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of his days, Kaltofen was profoundly agitated, and was
  very restless. When Jaspis gave him a book of prayers and meditations for
  such as were in trouble, he put it from him, and said the book was
  unsuitable, and was adapted only to the innocent. He had visitors who
  combined piety with inquisitiveness, and came to discuss with him the state
  of his soul. Kaltofen's vanity was inflamed, and he was delighted to pose
  before these zealots. When he heard that Jaspis had preached about him in the
  Kreuz Kirche on the Sunday before his execution, he was greatly gratified,
  and said, "He would really like to hear what had been said about him."</p>

  <p>Jaspis thereupon produced his sermon, and read it over to the wretched
  man&mdash;but tells us that even the most touching portions of the address
  failed to awake any genuine compunction in his soul. Unless he could play the
  saint, before company, he was cold and indifferent. His great vanity,
  however, was hurt at the thought that his assertion was disbelieved, that
  Fischer was his associate in his crimes. He was always eager and inquisitive
  to know what rumours circulated in the town concerning him, and was gratified
  to think that he was the topic of the general conversation.</p>

  <p>On the night before his execution he slept soundly for five hours, and
  then lit his pipe and smoked composedly. His condition was, however, not one
  of bluntness of sense, for he manifested considerable readiness and
  consciousness up to the last. He had drawn up a dying address which he handed
  to pastor Jaspis, and on which he evidently placed great importance, as when
  his first copy had caught fire when he was drying it, he set to work to
  compose a second. He knew his man&mdash;Jaspis&mdash;and was sure he would
  publish it after the execution. The paper was a rigmarole in which he posed
  to the world.</p>

  <p>On reaching the market-place where the execution was to take place, he
  repeated his confession, but on this occasion without mention of a
  confederate. His composure gave way, and he began to sob. On reaching the
  scaffold, however, the sight of the vast crowd assembled to see him die
  restored to him some of his composure, as it pleased his vanity; but he again
  broke down, as he made his last confession to the Lutheran pastor. His voice
  trembled, and the sweat broke out on his brow. Then he sprang up and shouted,
  so that all could hear&mdash;"Gentlemen, Fischer deserved the same punishment
  as myself." In another moment his head fell from his body.</p>

  <p>The words had been audible throughout the market-place by everyone. Who
  could doubt that his last words were true?</p>

  <p>Fischer happened that very day (July 12th) to be in Dresden. He had been
  seen, and had been recognised.</p>

  <p>He had come to Dresden to see his counsel, and ask him to use his
  influence to obtain his complete discharge from police supervision, and
  restoration to his rights as an honest man and a soldier, with a claim to a
  pension.</p>

  <p>A vast crowd of people rolled from the place of execution to the house of
  Eisenstück, shouting, and threatening to tear Fischer to pieces.</p>

  <p>But Eisenstück was not the man to be terrified. He summoned a carriage,
  entered it along with Fischer, and drove slowly, with the utmost composure,
  through the angry crowd.</p>

  <p>On August 26th, 1822, by command of the king, Fischer's name was replaced
  in the army list, and he received his complete discharge from all the
  consequences of the accusations made against him. He was guaranteed his
  pension for his "faithful services through 16 years, and in the campaigns of
  1813, 1814, and 1815, in which he had conducted himself to the approval of
  all his officers."</p>

  <p>How are we to explain the conduct of Kaltofen? The simplest way is to
  admit that he spoke the truth; but against this is to be opposed his denial
  that Fischer was guilty during the first six months that he was under arrest.
  And it is impossible to believe that Fischer was guilty, on the sole
  testimony of Kaltofen, without any confirmatory evidence.</p>

  <p>It is rather to be supposed that the inordinate vanity of the young
  culprit induced him to persist in denouncing his innocent brother gunner, so
  as to throw off his own shoulders some of the burden of that crime, which, he
  felt, made him hateful in the eyes of his fellow-citizens, and perhaps to
  induce them to regard him as misled by an older man, more hardened and
  experienced in crime, thus arousing their pity and sympathy in place of their
  disgust.</p>

  <p>Jaspis, the pastor, did not himself believe in the criminality of Fischer,
  and proposes a solution which he gives conjecturally only. He suggests that
  Kaltofen was misled by the confession of Fischer into the belief that he
  really had committed a murder or two, though not those of Winter and
  Kügelgen, and that when he declared on the scaffold that "Fischer deserved to
  die as much as himself," he spoke under this conviction. This explanation is
  untenable, for the miserable man had repeatedly charged Fischer with
  assisting him in committing these two particular crimes. The explanation must
  be found in his self-conceit and eagerness to present himself in the best and
  most affecting light before the public. And he gained his point to some
  extent. The mob believed him, pitied him, became sentimental over him, wept
  tears at his death, and cursed the unfortunate Fischer. The apparent piety,
  the mock heroics, the graceful attitudes, and the good looks of the murderer
  had won their sympathies, and the general opinion of the vulgar was that they
  had assisted at the sublimation of a saint to the seventh heaven, and not at
  the well-deserved execution of a peculiarly heartless and brutal
  murderer.</p>

  <p>A month had hardly passed since Kaltofen's execution before Dresden was
  shocked to hear of another murder&mdash;on this occasion by a young woman. On
  August 12th, 1821, this person, who had been in a state of excitement ever
  since the edifying death of Kaltofen, invited to her house a young girl, just
  engaged to be married, and deliberately murdered her; then marched off to the
  police and confessed her crime&mdash;the nature of which she did not
  disguise. She desired to make the same affecting and edifying end as
  Kaltofen. Above all, she wanted to get herself talked about by all the mouths
  in Dresden. The police on visiting her house found the murdered girl lying on
  the bed. On the door in large letters the murderer had inscribed the date of
  Kaltofen's martyrdom, July 12th, and she had committed her crime on the same
  day one month after, desirous to share his glory.</p>

  <p>Such was one consequence of this execution. A small farce also succeeded
  it. Influenced by the general excitement provoked by the murder of Kügelgen,
  the Jews had assembled and agreed, should any of them be able to discover the
  murderer, that they would decline the £150 offered by Government for
  information that might lead to the apprehension of the guilty. But Hirschel
  Mendel, the Jew who had produced the watch, put in his claim; whereupon Löbel
  Graff, who had produced the coat, put in a counter claim. This occasioned a
  lawsuit between the two Jews for the money. A compromise was finally patched
  up, by which each received half.</p>

  <p>Gerhard von Kügelgen had been buried in the Catholic cemetery at Dresden
  on Maundy Thursday evening by moonlight. A great procession of art students
  attended the funeral cortège with lighted torches, and an oration was
  pronounced over his grave by his friend Councillor Böttiger.</p>

  <p>His tomb may still be seen in the cemetery; on it is inscribed:&mdash;</p>

  <p>FRANZ GERHARD VON KÜGELGEN. Born 6 Feb., 1772. Died 27 March, 1820.</p>

  <p>On the other side is the text, St. John xiv. 27.</p>

  <p>Kügelgen left behind him two sons and a daughter. The eldest son, Wilhelm,
  pursued his father's profession as an artist, and the Emperor of Russia sent
  an annual grant of money to assist him in his studies. There is a pleasant
  book, published anonymously by him, "An Old Man's Youthful Reminiscences,"
  the first edition of which was issued in 1870, and which had reached its
  eighth edition in 1876.</p>

  <p>Kügelgen's twin brother, Karl Ferdinand, after spending some years in St.
  Petersburg and in Livonia, settled at Reval, and died in 1832. He was the
  author of a "Picturesque Journey in the Crimea," published in 1823.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE POISONED PARSNIPS</h2>

  <p class="first">AT the time when the banished Bourbons were wandering about
  Europe seeking temporary asylums, during the period of Napoleon's supremacy,
  a story circulated in 1804 relative to an attempt made in Warsaw, which then
  belonged to Prussia, upon the life of the Royal Family then residing there.
  It was said that a plot had been formed, that was well nigh successful, to
  kill Louis XVIII., his wife, the Duke and Duchess of Angoulême, and such of
  the Court as sat at the Royal table, with a dish of poisoned parsnips. It
  was, moreover, whispered that at the bottom of the plot was no other than
  Napoleon himself, who sought to remove out of his way the legitimate
  claimants to the Gallic throne.</p>

  <p>The article in which the account of the attempt was made public was in the
  <i>London Courier</i> for August 20th, 1804, from which we will now take the
  leading facts.</p>

  <p>The Royal Family was living in Warsaw. Napoleon Bonaparte employed an
  agent of the name of Galon Boyer at Warsaw to keep an eye on them, and this
  man, it was reported, had engaged assassins at the instigation of Napoleon to
  poison Louis XVIII. and the rest of the Royal Family. The <i>Courier</i> of
  August 21st, 1804, says: "Some of the daily papers, which were not over
  anxious to discredit the conspiracy imputed to Mr. Drake,[1] affect to throw
  some doubt upon the account of the attempt upon the lives of the Royal Family
  at Warsaw. They seem to think that had Bonaparte desired such a plan, he
  could have executed it with more secrecy and effect. Undoubtedly his plans of
  assassination have hitherto been more successful, because his hapless victims
  were within his power&mdash;his wounded soldiers at Jaffa, Toussaint
  L'Ouverture, Pichegru, and the Duke D'Enghien. He could send his bloodhounds
  into Germany to seize his prey; but Warsaw was too remote for him; he was
  under the necessity of having recourse to less open means of sending his
  assassins to act secretly. But it is deemed extraordinary that the diabolical
  attempt should have failed. Why is it extraordinary that a beneficent
  Providence should interpose to save the life of a just prince? Have we not
  had signal instances of that interposition in this country? For the accuracy
  of the account we published yesterday, we pledge ourselves[2] that the
  fullest details, authenticated by all Louis XVIII.'s Ministers&mdash;by the
  venerable Archbishop of Rheims&mdash;by the Abbé Edgeworth, who administered
  the last consolation of religion to Louis the XVI., have been received in
  this country. All those persons were present when the poisoned preparation
  was analysed by very eminent physicians, <i>who are the subjects of the King
  of Prussia</i>.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[1] Drake was envoy of the British Government at Munich;
  he and Spencer Smith, Chargé d'Affaires at Würtemberg, were accused by
  Napoleon of being at the bottom of a counter revolution, and an attempt to
  obtain his assassination. It was true that Drake and Smith were in
  correspondence with parties in France with the object of securing Hagenau and
  Strassburgo and throwing discord among the troops of the Republic, but they
  never for a moment thought of obtaining the assassination of the First
  Consul, as far as we can judge from their correspondence that fell into the
  hands of the French police.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[2] Unfortunately the British Museum file is imperfect,
  and does not contain the Number for August 20th.</p>

  <p>"The two wretches who attempted to corrupt the poor Frenchman were openly
  protected by the French Consul or Commercial Agent.</p>

  <p>"The Prussian Governor would not suffer them to be arrested in order that
  their guilt or innocence might be legally investigated. Is it to be believed
  that had there been no foundation for the charge against them, the French
  agent would have afforded them less open protection, and thereby strengthened
  the charge brought against them? If they were protected and paid by the
  French agent, is it probable that he paid them out of his own pocket,
  employed them in such a plot of his own accord, and without order and
  instructions from his own Government, from Bonaparte? Besides, did not the
  President Hoym acknowledge his fears that some attempt would be made upon the
  life of Louis the XVIII.?</p>

  <p>"The accounts transmitted to this country were sent from Warsaw one hour
  after the king had set out for Grodno."</p>

  <p>The <i>Courier</i> for August 24th, 1804, has the following
  note:&mdash;"We have another strong fact which is no slight evidence in our
  minds of Bonaparte's guilt. The plot against Louis the XVIII. was to be
  executed at the end of July&mdash;it would be known about the beginning of
  August. At that very period Bonaparte prohibits the importation of all
  foreign journals without exception&mdash;that is, of all the means by which
  the people could be informed of the diabolical deed. Why does he issue this
  prohibition at the present moment, or why does he issue it at all? Fouché
  says in his justification of it that it is to prevent our knowing when the
  expedition sails. Have we ever received any news about the expedition from
  the French papers? No, no! the prohibition was with a view to the bloody
  scene to be acted at Warsaw."</p>

  <p>The <i>Courier</i> of August 22nd contained full particulars. We will now
  tell the whole story, from beginning to end, first of all as dressed out by
  the fancy of Legitimists, and then according to the real facts of the case as
  far as known.</p>

  <p>Napoleon, it will be remembered, had been appointed First Consul for life
  on August 2nd, 1802, but the Republic came to an end, and the French Empire
  was established by the Senate on May 18th, 1804.</p>

  <p>It was supposed&mdash;and we can excuse the excitement and intoxication of
  wrath in the minds of all adherents of the Bourbons which could suppose
  it&mdash;that Napoleon, who was thus refounding the Empire of Charlemagne,
  desired to secure the stability of this new throne by sweeping out of his way
  the legitimate claimants to that of France. The whole legend of the attempt
  to assassinate Louis XVIII. by means of a dish of poisoned parsnips is given
  us in complete form by the author of a life of that prince twenty years after
  the event.[3] It is to this effect:</p>

  <p>When the King (Louis XVIII.) was preparing for his journey from Warsaw to
  Grodno an atrocious attempt to assassinate him was brought to light, which
  leaves no manner of doubt that it was the purpose of those who were the
  secret movers in the plot to remove by poison both the King and Queen and
  also the Duke of Angoulême and his wife. Two delegates of Napoleon had been
  in Warsaw seeking for a man who could execute the plan. A certain Coulon
  appeared most adapted to their purpose, a man indigent and eager for money.
  He had previously been in the service of one of the emigré nobles, and had
  access to the kitchen of the Royal Family.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[3] A. de Beauchamp, Vie de Louis XVIII. Paris, 1824.</p>

  <p>The agents of Napoleon gave Coulon drink, and as he became friendly and
  lively under the influence of punch, they communicated to him their scheme,
  and promised him money, the payment of his debts, and to effect his escape if
  he would be their faithful servant in the intrigue. Coulon pretended to yield
  to their solicitations, and a rendezvous was appointed where the plans were
  to be matured. But no sooner was Coulon at liberty than he went to his former
  master, the Baron de Milleville, master of horse to the Queen, and told him
  all. The Baron sought the Duc de Pienne, first gentleman of the Royal
  household, and he on receiving the information communicated it to the Count
  d'Avaray, Minister of Louis XVIII. Coulon received orders to pretend to be
  ready to carry on the plot. He did this with reluctance, but he did it. He
  told the agents of Napoleon that he was in their hands and would blindly
  execute their orders. They treated him now to champagne, and revealed to him
  the details of the attempt. He was to get into the kitchen of the Royal
  household, and was to pour the contents of a packet they gave him into one of
  the pots in which the dinner for the Royal table was being cooked. Coulon
  then demanded an instalment of his pay, and asked to be given 400 louis d'or.
  One of the agents then turned to the other and asked if he thought Boyer
  would be disposed to advance so much&mdash;this was Galon Boyer, the head
  agent sent purposely to Warsaw as spy on the Royal Family, and the principal
  mover in the attempt.</p>

  <p>The other agent replied that Boyer was not at the moment in Warsaw, but he
  would be back in a couple of days. Coulon stuck to his point, like a clever
  rascal, and refused to do anything till he felt gold in his palm, and he was
  bidden wait till Boyer had been communicated with. He was appointed another
  meeting on the moors at Novawies outside the city.</p>

  <p>As, next evening, Coulon was on his way to the place named, he observed
  that he was followed by a man. Suddenly out of the corn growing beside the
  road started a second. They were the agents. They paid him a few dollars,
  promised to provide handsomely for him in France, by giving him 400 louis
  d'or and a situation under Government; and handed him a bottle of liquor that
  was to stimulate his courage at the crucial moment, and also a paper packet
  that contained three parsnips, that had been scooped out and filled with
  poison. These he was to insinuate into one of the pots cooking for dinner,
  and induce the cook to overlook what he had done, and serve them up to the
  Royal Family.</p>

  <p>The King then lived in a chateau at Lazienki, about a mile out of Warsaw.
  Thither hastened Coulon as fast as his legs could carry him, and he committed
  the parsnips to the Baron de Milleville. The Count d'Avaray and the
  Archbishop of Rheims put their seals on the parcel; after that the parsnips
  had first been shown to the Prussian authorities, and they had been asked in
  all form to attest the production of the poisoned roots, and to order the
  arrest of the two agents of Napoleon, and to confront them with
  Coulon&mdash;and had declined. Louis, when informed of the attempt, showed
  his wonted composure. He wrote immediately to the Prussian President, Von
  Hoym, and requested him to visit him at Lazienki, and consult what was to be
  done.</p>

  <p>Herr Von Hoym did not answer; nor did he go to the King, but communicated
  with his superiors. Finally there arrived a diplomatic reply declining to
  interfere in the matter, as it was the concern of the police to investigate
  it, and it should be taken up in the ordinary way.</p>

  <p>Thereupon the King requested that Coulon and his wife should be secured,
  and that specialists should be appointed who, along with the Royal physician,
  might examine the parsnips alleged to be poisoned.</p>

  <p>But the Prussian Courts declined again to take any steps. The policy of
  the Prussian Cabinet under Count Haugwitz was favourable to a French
  alliance, and the King of Prussia was among the first of the greater Powers
  which had formally recognised the French Emperor. On condition that the
  French troops occupying Hanover should not be augmented, and that war, if it
  broke out with Russia, should be so carried on as not to inconvenience and
  sweep over Prussian territory, Prussia had undertaken to observe a strict
  neutrality. In return for these concessions, which were of great moment to
  Napoleon, he openly proclaimed his intention to augment the strength of
  Prussia, and it was hoped at Berlin that the price paid would be the
  incorporation of Hanover with Prussia.</p>

  <p>At this moment, consequently, the Prussian Government was most unwilling
  to meddle in an investigation which threatened to lead to revelations most
  compromising to the character of Napoleon, and most inconvenient for
  itself.</p>

  <p>As the Prussian courts would not take up the matter of the parsnips, a
  private investigation was made by the Count d'Avaray, with the Royal
  physician, Dr. Lefèvre, and the Warsaw physician, Dr. Gagatkiewicz, together
  with the Apothecary Guidel and a certain Dr. Bergozoni. The seals were broken
  in their presence, and the three roots were examined. It was ascertained that
  they were stuffed with a mixture of white, yellow, and red arsenic. This
  having been ascertained, and a statement of the fact duly drawn up, and
  signed, the president of the police, Herr von Tilly, was communicated with.
  He, however, declined to interfere, as had the President von Hoym. "Thus,"
  says M. Beauchamp, "one court shuffled the matter off on another, backwards
  and forwards, so as not to have to decide on the matter, a specimen of the
  results of the system adopted at this time by the Prussian Cabinet."</p>

  <p>No other means of investigation remained but for Count d'Avaray to have
  the matter gone into by the court of the exiled King. They examined Coulon,
  who held firmly to his story as told to the Baron de Milleville, and all
  present were convinced that he spoke the truth.</p>

  <p>As the King could obtain no justice from the hands of Prussia, he suffered
  the story to be made public in order that the opinion of all honourable men
  in Europe might be expressed on the conduct of both Napoleon and of the
  Prussian Ministry. "The impression made," says M. Beauchamp, "especially in
  England, was deep. Men recalled Bonaparte's former crimes that had been
  proved&mdash;the poisoning at Jaffa, the&mdash;at the time&mdash;very fresh
  indignation provoked by the murder of the Count de Frotté, of Pichegru, of
  Captain Wright, of the Duke d'Enghien, of Toussaint l'Ouverture; they
  recalled the lack of success he had experienced in demanding of Louis XVIII.
  a formal renunciation of his claims, and weighed well the determination of
  his character. Even the refusal of the Prussian courts to go into the charge
  (for if it had been investigated they must needs have pronounced judgment on
  it)&mdash;encouraged suspicion. Hardly an English newspaper did not condemn
  Napoleon as the instigator of an attempt that providentially failed."</p>

  <p>Such is the legend as formulated by M. de Beauchamp. Fortunately there
  exists documentary evidence in the archives of the courts at Berlin that
  gives an altogether different complexion to the story, and entirely clears
  the name of Napoleon from stain of complicity in this matter. It throws,
  moreover, a light, by no means favourable, on those of the Legitimist party
  clustered about the fallen monarch.</p>

  <p>Louis XVIII., obliged to fly from one land to another before the forces of
  Napoleon, was staying for a while at Warsaw, in the year 1804, under the
  incognito of the Count de l'Isle. His misfortunes had not broken his spirit
  or diminished his pretensions. He was surrounded by a little court in spite
  of his incognito; and as this little court had no affairs of State to
  transact, it played a niggling game at petty intrigue. This court consisted
  of the Count d'Avaray, the Archbishop of Rheims, the Duke de Pienne, the
  Marquis de Bonney, the Duke d'Avré de Croy, the Count de la Chapelle, the
  Counts Damas Crux and Stephen de Damas, and the Abbés Edgeworth and Frimont.
  Louis had assured Napoleon he would rather eat black bread than resign his
  pretensions. At Warsaw he maintained his pretensions to the full, but did not
  eat black bread; he kept a very respectable kitchen. The close alliance
  between Prussia and France forced him to leave Warsaw and migrate into
  Russia.</p>

  <p>At this time there lived in Warsaw a certain Jean Coulon, son of a small
  shopkeeper at Lyons, who had led an adventurous life. At the age of nine he
  had run away from home and attached himself to a wandering dramatic company;
  then had gone into service to a wigmaker, and had lived for three years at
  Barcelona at his handicraft. But wigs were going out of fashion, and he threw
  up an unprofitable trade, and enlisted in a legion of emigrés, but in
  consequence of some quarrel with a Spaniard was handed over to the Spanish
  authorities. He purchased his pardon by enlisting in the Spanish army, but
  deserted and joined the French Republican troops, was in the battle of Novi,
  ran away, and joined the corps raised at Naples by Cardinal Ruffo. When this
  corps was dispersed, he went back to Spain, again enlisted, and was shipped
  for St. Lucia. The vessel in which he was, was captured by an English
  cruiser, and he was taken into Plymouth and sent up to Dartmoor as prisoner
  of war. After two years he was exchanged and was shipped to Cuxhaven. Thence
  he went to Altona, where he asked the intervention of the Duke d'Avré in his
  favour. The Duke recommended him to the Countess de l'Isle, and he was taken
  into the service of her master of horse, the Baron de Milleville, and came to
  Warsaw in September, 1803. There he married, left his service and set up a
  café and billiard room that was frequented by the retainers and servants of
  the emigré nobility that hovered about the King and Queen. He was then aged
  32, could speak Italian and Spanish as well as French, and was a thorough
  soldier of fortune, impecunious, loving pleasure, and wholly without
  principles, political or religious.</p>

  <p>The French Chargé d'Affaires at Warsaw was Galon Boyer; he does not appear
  in the documents relative to the <i>Affaire Coulon</i>, not because the
  Prussian Government shirked its duty, but because he was in no way mixed up
  with the matter of the parsnips. It is quite true that, as M. de Beauchamp
  asserts, the Court of Louis XVIII. did endeavour to involve the Prussian
  authorities in the investigation, but it was in such a manner that it was not
  possible for them to act. On July 23rd, when the Count de l'Isle was
  determined to leave Warsaw, Count d'Avaray called on the President von Hoym,
  and told him in mysterious language that he was aware of a conspiracy in
  which were involved several Frenchmen and as many as a dozen Poles that
  sought the life of his august master. Herr von Hoym doubted. He asked for the
  grounds of this assertion, and was promised full particulars that same
  evening at eight o'clock. At the hour appointed, the Count appeared
  breathless before him, and declared that now he was prepared with a complete
  disclosure. However, he told nothing, and postponed the revelation to 10
  o'clock. Then Avaray informed him that the keeper of the Café Coulon had been
  hired by some strangers to meet him that same night on the road to Novawies,
  to plan with him the murder, by poison, of the Count de l'Isle. The whole
  story seemed suspicious to von Hoym. It was now too late for him to send
  police to watch the spot where the meeting was to take place, which he might
  have done had d'Avaray condescended to tell him in time, two hours earlier.
  He asked d'Avaray where Coulon lived that he might send for him, and the
  Count professed he did not know the address.</p>

  <p>Next day Count d'Avaray read to the President von Hoym a document, which
  he said had been drawn up by members of the court of the Count de l'Isle,
  showed him a paper that contained twelve small parsnips, and requested him to
  subscribe the document and seal the parcel of parsnips. Naturally, the
  President declined to do this. He had not seen Coulon, he did not know from
  whom Coulon had received the parcel, and he mistrusted the whole story.
  However, he requested that he might be furnished with an exact description of
  the two mysterious strangers, and when he had received it, communicated with
  the police, and had inquiry made for them in and about Warsaw. No one had
  seen or heard of any persons answering to the description.</p>

  <p>Presently the Marquis de Bonney arrived to request the President, in the
  name of the Count de l'Isle, to have the parsnips examined by specialists. He
  declined to do so.</p>

  <p>On July 26th, the Count d'Avaray appeared before the head of the Police,
  the President von Tilly, and showed him an attestation made by several
  doctors that they had examined three parsnips that had been shown them, and
  they had found in them a paste composed of arsenic and orpiment. Von Tilly
  thought the whole story so questionable that he refused to meddle with it.
  Moreover, a notary of Warsaw, who had been requested to take down Coulon's
  statement, had declined to testify to the genuineness of the confession,
  probably because, as Coulon afterwards insinuated, he had been helped to make
  it consistent by those who questioned him.</p>

  <p>Louis XVIII. left Warsaw on July 30, and as the rumour spread that
  Coulon's wife had bought some arsenic a week before at an apothecary's shop
  in the place, the police inspector ordered her arrest. She was questioned and
  declared that she had, indeed, bought some rat poison, without the knowledge
  of her husband. Coulon was now taken up and questioned, and he pretended that
  he had given his wife orders to buy the rat poison, because he was plagued
  with vermin in the house.</p>

  <p>Then the authorities in Warsaw sent all the documents relating to this
  matter, including the <i>procès verbal</i> drawn up by the courtiers of Louis
  XVIII., to Berlin, and asked for further instructions.</p>

  <p>According to this <i>procès verbal</i> Coulon had confessed as follows: On
  the 20th July two strangers had entered his billiard room, and had assured
  him that, if he were disposed to make his fortune, they could help him to it.
  They made him promise silence, and threatened him with death if he disclosed
  what they said. After he had sworn fidelity and secrecy, they told him that
  he was required to throw something into the pot in which the soup was being
  prepared for the King's table. For so doing they would pay him 400 louis
  d'or. Coulon considered a moment; then the strangers promised they would
  provide a situation for his wife in France. After that one of them said to
  his fellow in Italian, "We must be off. We have no time to lose." Next day,
  in the evening, a third stranger appeared at his door, called him forth into
  the street, walked about with him through the streets of old and new Warsaw,
  till he was thoroughly bewildered, and did not know where he was, and,
  finally, entered with him a house, where he saw the two strangers who had
  been with him previously. Champagne was brought on the table, and they all
  drank, and one of the strangers became tipsy. When Coulon promised to do what
  was required of him, he was told to secure some of the mutton-chops that were
  being prepared for the Royal table, and to manipulate them with the powder
  that was to be given him. That the cook might not notice what he was about,
  he was to treat him to large draughts of brandy. Coulon agreed, but asked
  first to touch the 400 louis d'or. Then the tipsy man shouted out, "That is
  all right, but will Boyer consent to it?" The other stranger tried to check
  him, and said, "What are you saying? Boyer is not here, he has gone out of
  town and will not be back for a couple of days." After Coulon had insisted on
  prepayment, he had been put off till the next evening, when he was to meet
  the strangers at 11 o'clock on the road to Novawies. There he was to receive
  money, and the powder for the King. He was then given one ducat, and led home
  at one o'clock in the morning. On the following night, at 11 o'clock, he went
  on the way to Novawies, and then followed what we have already given from the
  story of the man, as recorded by M. de Beauchamp. He received from the men a
  packet containing the parsnips, and some money&mdash;only six dollars. They
  put a kerchief under the earth beneath a tree, and bade him, if he had
  accomplished his task, come to the tree and remove the kerchief, as a token
  to them; if, however, he failed, the kerchief was to be left undisturbed. The
  tree he had marked well, it was the forty-fifth along the road to Novawies. A
  small end of the kerchief peeped out from under the soil. The strangers had
  then given him a bottle of liqueur to stimulate his courage for the
  undertaking.</p>

  <p>After that Coulon was left alone, he said that he staggered homewards, but
  felt so faint that he would have fallen to the ground had not a Prussian
  officer, who came by, noticed his condition and helped him home. At the
  conclusion of the <i>procès verbal</i> came an exact description of the
  conspirators. Such was the document produced originally by the Count
  d'Avaray, and we can hardly wonder that, on hearing it, the Prussian civil
  and police authorities had hesitated about taking action. The so-called
  confession of Coulon seemed to them to be a rhodomontade got up for the
  purpose of obtaining money out of the ex-King and his Court.</p>

  <p>From Berlin orders were sent to Warsaw to have the matter thoroughly
  sifted. Coulon and his wife were now again subjected to examination. He
  adhered at first to his story, but when he endeavoured to explain the
  purchase of the arsenic, and to fit it into his previous tale, he involved
  himself in contradictions.</p>

  <p>The President at this point addressed him gravely, and warned him of the
  consequences. His story compromised the French chargé d'affaires, M. Galon
  Boyer, and this could not be allowed to be passed over without a very
  searching examination that must inevitably reveal the truth. Coulon was
  staggered, and hastily asked how matters would stand with him if he told the
  truth. Then, after a little hesitation, he admitted that "he thought before
  the departure of the Count de l'Isle he would obtain for himself a sum of
  money, with which to escape out of his difficulties. He had reckoned on
  making 100 ducats out of this affair." He now told quite a different tale.
  With the departure of the court of the emigrés, he would lose his clientelle,
  and he was concerned because he owed money for the café and billiard table.
  He had therefore invented the whole story in hopes of imposing on the court
  and getting from them a little subvention. But he said he had been dragged on
  further than he intended by the Count d'Avaray, who had swallowed his lie
  with avidity, and had urged him to go on with the intrigue so as to produce
  evidence against the conspirators.</p>

  <p>That was why he had made up the figment of the meeting with the strangers
  on the road and their gift to him of the parsnips, which he admitted that he
  had himself scooped out and filled with the rat poison paste he had bought at
  the apothecary's.</p>

  <p>So far so good. What he now said was precisely what the cool heads of the
  Prussian authorities had believed from the first. But Coulon did not adhere
  to this second confession. After a few days in prison he professed his desire
  to make another. He was brought before the magistrate, and now he said that
  the whole story was got up by the Count d'Avaray, M. de Milleville, and
  others of the surroundings of the exiled King, for the purpose of creating an
  outbreak of disgust in Europe against Napoleon, and of bringing about a
  revolt in France. He declared that he had been promised a pension of six
  ducats monthly, that when he gave his evidence M. de Milleville had paid him
  35 ducats, and that he had been taken into the service, along with his wife,
  of the ex-Queen, as reward for what he had done.</p>

  <p>There were several particulars which gave colour to this last version of
  Coulon's story. It was true that he had been given some money by Milleville;
  it was perhaps true that in their eagerness to prove a case of attempted
  assassination, some of those who conducted the inquiry had helped him to
  correct certain discrepancies in his narrative. Then, again, it was
  remarkable that, although the Count d'Avaray knew about the projected murder,
  he would not tell the Prussian President the facts till 10 o'clock at night,
  when it was too late to send the police to observe the pretended meeting on
  the Novawies road; and when Herr von Hoym asked for directions as to where
  Coulon lived that the police might be sent to arrest him on his return, and
  during his absence to search the house, the Count had pretended to be unable
  to say where Coulon lived. It was also true that de Milleville had repeatedly
  visited Coulon's house during the course of the intrigue, and that it was
  immediately after Coulon had been at Milleville's house that his wife was
  sent to buy the rat poison.</p>

  <p>Coulon pretended to have heard M. de Milleville say that "This affair
  might cause a complete change in the situation in France, when tidings of
  what had been done were published." Moreover, he said that he had been
  despatched to the Archbishop of Rheim's with the message "Le coup est
  manqué."</p>

  <p>But it is impossible to believe that the emigré court can have fabricated
  such a plot by which to cast on the name of Napoleon the stain of attempted
  assassination. The whole story reads like the clumsy invention of a vulgar
  adventurer. Coulon's second confession is obviously that of his true motives.
  He was in debt, he was losing his clientelle by the departure of the Count,
  and it is precisely what such a scoundrel would do, to invent a lie whereby
  to enlist their sympathies for himself, and obtain from them some pecuniary
  acknowledgment for services he pretended to have rendered. The little court
  was to blame in its gullibility. Its blind hatred of Napoleon led it to
  believe such a gross and palpable lie, and, if doubts arose in any of their
  minds as to the verity of the tale told them, they suppressed them.</p>

  <p>Coulon was found guilty by the court and was sentenced to five years'
  imprisonment. The judgment of the court was that he had acted in concert with
  certain members of the retinue of the Count de l'Isle, but it refrained from
  naming them.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE MURDER OF FATHER THOMAS IN DAMASCUS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE remarkable case we are about to relate awoke great
  interest and excitement throughout three quarters of the world, and stirred
  up that hatred of the Jews which had been laid asleep after the persecutions
  of the Middle Ages, just at the time when in all European lands the
  emancipation of the Jew was being recognised as an act of justice. At the
  time the circumstances were imperfectly known, or were laid before the public
  in such a partial light that it was difficult to form a correct judgment upon
  them. Since then, a good deal of light has been thrown on the incident, and
  it is possible to arrive at a conclusion concerning the murder with more
  unbiased mind and with fuller information than was possible at the time.</p>

  <p>The Latin convents of Syria stand under the immediate jurisdiction of the
  Pope, and are, for the most part, supplied with recruits from Italy. They are
  very serviceable to travellers, whom they receive with genial hospitality,
  and without distinction of creed. They are nurseries of culture and of
  industry. Every monk and friar is required to exercise a profession or trade,
  and the old charge against monks of being drones is in no way applicable to
  the busy members of the religious orders in Palestine.</p>

  <p>In the Capuchin Convent at Damascus dwelt, in 1840, a friar named Father
  Thomas, a Sardinian by birth. For thirty-three years he had lived there, and
  had acted as physician and surgeon, attending to whoever called for his
  services, Mussulman or Christian, Turk, Jew or Frank alike. He set limbs,
  dosed with quinine for fever, and vaccinated against smallpox. Being well
  known and trusted, he was in constant practice, and his practice brought him,
  or, at all events, his order, a handsome annual income. His manners were,
  unfortunately, not amiable. He was curt, even rude, and somewhat dictatorial;
  his manners impressed as authoritative in the sickroom, but were resented in
  the market-place as insolent.</p>

  <p>On February 5th, 1840, Father Thomas disappeared, together with his
  servant, a lay brother who always attended him. This disappearance caused
  great commotion in Damascus.</p>

  <p>France has been considered in the East as the protector of Christians of
  the Latin confession. The French Consul, the Count Ratti-Menton, considered
  it his duty to investigate the matter.</p>

  <p>Father Thomas had been seen to enter the Jews' quarter. Several Israelites
  admitted having seen him there. No one saw him leave it: consequently, it was
  concluded he had disappeared, been made away with, there. As none but Jews
  occupied the Ghetto, it was argued that Father Thomas had been murdered by
  Israelites. That was settled as a preliminary. But in the meantime the
  Austrian Consul had been making investigation as well as the Count
  Ratti-Menton, and he had obtained information that Father Thomas and his
  servant had been noticed engaged in a violent quarrel and contest of words
  with some Mohammedans of the lowest class, in the market-place. No weight was
  attached to this, and the French Consul pursued his investigations in the
  Jews' quarter, and in that quarter alone.</p>

  <p>Sheriff Pacha was Governor of Syria, and Count Ratti-Menton required him
  to allow of his using every means at his disposal for the discovery of the
  criminal. He also requested the Austrian Consul to allow a domiciliary
  visitation of all the Jews' houses, the Austrian Government being regarded as
  the protector of the Hebrews. In both cases consent was given, and the search
  was begun with zeal.</p>

  <p>Then a Turk, named Mohammed-el-Telli, who was in prison for non-payment of
  taxes, sent word to the French Consul that, if he would obtain his release,
  he would give such information as would lead to the discovery of the murderer
  or murderers. He received his freedom, and denounced, in return, several
  Jews' houses as suspicious. Count Ratti-Menton at the head of a troop of
  soldiers and workmen, and a rabble assembled in the street, invaded all these
  houses, and explored them from attic to cellar.</p>

  <p>One of the first names given by Mohammed-el-Telli was that of a Jewish
  barber, Negrin. He gave a confused and contradictory account of himself, but
  absolutely denied having any knowledge of the murder. In vain were every
  means used during three days at the French Consulate to bring him to a
  confession; after that he was handed over to the Turkish authorities. They
  had him bastinadoed, then tortured. During his torture, Mohammed-el-Telli was
  at his side urging him to make a clean breast. Unable to endure his
  sufferings longer, the barbar declared his readiness to tell all. Whether
  what he said was based on reports circulating in the town, or was put into
  his mouth by his tormentors, we cannot tell. According to his story, on the
  evening of February the 5th a servant of David Arari summoned him into his
  house. He found the master of the house along with six other Israelitish
  rabbis and merchants, to wit, Aaron and Isaac Arari, Mussa Abul Afia, Moses
  Salonichi, and Joseph Laniado. In a corner of the room lay or leaned against
  the wall Father Thomas, gagged and bound hand and foot. The merchants urged
  Negrin to murder the Capuchin in their presence, but he stedfastly refused to
  do so. Finally finding him inflexible, they bought his silence with 600
  piastres (hardly £6) and dismissed him.</p>

  <p>Thereupon, the governor ordered the arrest of David Arari and the other
  Jews named, all of whom were the richest merchants in the town&mdash;at all
  events the richest Jewish merchants. They, with one consent, solemnly
  protested their innocence. They, also, were subjected to the bastinado; but
  as most of them were aged men, and it was feared that they might succumb
  under the blows, after a few lashes had been administered, they were raised
  from the ground and subjected to other tortures. For thirty-six hours the
  unhappy men were forced to stand upright, and were prevented from sleeping.
  They still persisted in denial, whereupon some of them were again beaten. At
  the twentieth blow they fainted. The French Consul complained that the
  beating was inefficient&mdash;so the Austrian Consul reported, and at his
  instigation they were again bastinadoed, but again without bringing them to
  confession.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, David Arari's servant, Murad-el-Fallat, was arrested, the
  man who was said to have been sent for the barber. He was dealt with more
  sharply than the others. He was beaten most cruelly, and to heighten his pain
  cold water was poured over his bruised and mangled flesh. Under the anguish
  he confessed that he had indeed been sent for the barber.</p>

  <p>That was an insufficient confession. He was threatened with the bastinado
  again, and promised his release if he would reveal all he knew. Thereupon he
  repeated the story of the barber, with additions of his own. He and Negrin,
  said he, had by command of the seven rich merchants put the Father to death,
  and had then cut up the body and hidden the remains in a remote water
  conduit.</p>

  <p>The barber, threatened with fresh tortures, confessed to the murder.</p>

  <p>Count Ratti-Menton explored the conduit where the two men pretended the
  mutilated body was concealed, in the presence of the servant and barber, both
  of whom were in such a condition through the barbarous treatment to which
  they had been subjected, that they could not walk, and had to be carried to
  the spot. And actually there some bones were found, together with a cap. A
  surgeon pronounced that these were human bones. It was at once concluded that
  these were the remains of Father Thomas, and as such were solemnly buried in
  the cemetery of the Capuchin Convent.</p>

  <p>David Arari's servant. Murad-el-Fallet, had related that the blood of
  Father Thomas had been collected in a copper vessel and drawn off and
  distributed among the Jews for religious purposes. It was an old and
  favourite belief among the ignorant that the Jews drank the blood of
  Christians at Easter, or mingled it with the Paschal unleavened dough. At the
  same time the rumour spread that the rich Hebrew Picciotto, a young man,
  nephew of the Austrian Consul at Aleppo, had sent his uncle a bottle of
  blood.</p>

  <p>The seven merchants were led before the bones that had been discovered.
  They persisted in the declaration of their innocence. From this time forward,
  all scruple as to their treatment vanished, and they were tortured with
  diabolical barbarity. They received the bastinado again, they were burned
  where their flesh was tenderest with red hot pincers. Red hot wires were
  passed through their flesh. A German traveller, present at the time, declares
  that the first to acknowledge the truth of the charge was brought to do so by
  immersing him after all these torments for several hours in ice cold water;
  after which the other six were lashed with a scourge made of hippopotamus
  hide, till half unconscious, and streaming with blood, they were ready to
  admit whatever their tormentors strove to worry out of them.</p>

  <p>The Protestant missionary, Wildon Pieritz, in his account enumerates the
  sufferings to which these unhappy men were subjected.</p>

  <p>They were, 1st, bastinadoed.</p>

  <p>2nd. Plunged in large vessels of cold water.</p>

  <p>3rd. Placed under pressure till their eyes started out of their
  sockets.</p>

  <p>4th. Their flesh, where most sensitive, was twisted and nipped till they
  went almost mad with agony.</p>

  <p>5th. They were forced to stand upright for three whole days, and not
  suffered even to lean against a wall. Those who fell with exhaustion were
  goaded to rise again by the bayonets of the guard.</p>

  <p>6th. They were dragged about by their ears, so that they were torn and
  bled.</p>

  <p>7th. Thorns were driven up the quick of their nails on fingers and
  toes.</p>

  <p>8th. Their beards were singed off, so that the skin was scorched and
  blistered.</p>

  <p>9th. Flames were put under their noses so as to burn their nostrils.</p>

  <p>The French Consul&mdash;let his name go down to posterity steeped in
  ignominy&mdash;Count Ratti-Menton, was not yet satisfied. He was bent on
  finding the vials filled with the blood. Each of the seven questioned said he
  had not got one, but had given his vial to another. The last, Mussa Abul
  Afia, unable to endure his torments any longer, gave way, and professed his
  willingness to turn Mussulman. Nevertheless, he was again subjected to the
  scourge, and whipped till he named another confederate&mdash;the Chief Rabbi
  Jacob Antibi, as the man to whom the blood had been committed. Mussa's
  confession, committed to writing, was as follows:&mdash;"I am
  <i>commanded</i> to say what I know relative to the murder of Father Thomas,
  and why I have submitted to become a Mussulman. It is, therefore, my duty to
  declare the truth. Jacob Antibi, Chief Rabbi, about a fortnight before the
  event, said to me&mdash;'You know that according to our religion we must have
  blood. I have already arranged with David Arari, to obtain it in the house of
  one of our people, and you must be present and bring me the blood.' I replied
  that I had not the nerve to see blood flow; whereupon, the Chief Rabbi
  answered that I could stand in the ante-chamber, and I would find Moses
  Salonichi and Joseph Laniado there. I then consented. On the 10th of the
  month, Achach, about an hour and a half before sun-down, as I was on my way
  to the synagogue, I met David Arari, who said to me: 'Come along to my house,
  you are wanted there.' I replied that I would come as soon as I had ended my
  prayers. 'No, no&mdash;come immediately!' he said. I obeyed. Then he told me
  that Father Thomas was in his house, and that he was to be sacrificed that
  evening. We went to his house. There we entered a newly-furnished apartment.
  Father Thomas lay bound in the midst of all there assembled. After sunset we
  adjourned to an unfurnished chamber, where David cut the throat of the monk.
  Aaron and Isaac Arari finished him. The blood was caught in a vat and then
  poured into a bottle, which was to be taken to the Chief Rabbi Jacob. I took
  the bottle and went to him. I found him in his court waiting for me. When he
  saw me enter, he retreated to his cabinet, and I followed him thither,
  saying, 'Here, I bring you what you desired.' He took the bottle and put it
  behind a book-case. Then I went home. I have forgotten to say that, when I
  left Arari's house, the body was undisturbed. I heard David and his brother
  say that they had made a bad choice of a victim, as Father Thomas was a
  priest, and a well-known individual, and would therefore be sought for, high
  and low. They answered that there was no fear, no one would betray what had
  taken place. The clothing would be now burnt, the body cut to pieces, and
  conveyed by the servants to the conduit, and what remained would be concealed
  under some secret stairs. I knew nothing about the servant of Father Thomas.
  The Wednesday following, I met David, Isaac, and Joseph Arari, near the shop
  of Bahal. Isaac asked David how all had gone on. David replied that all was
  done that was necessary, and that there was no cause for fear. As they began
  to talk together privately, I withdrew, as I was not one who associated with
  the wealthiest of the Jews, and the Arari were of that class. The blood is
  required by the Jews for the preparation of the Paschal bread. They have been
  often accused of the same, and been condemned on that account. They have a
  book called Serir Hadurut (no such a book really exists) which concerns this
  matter; now that the light of Islam has shone on me, I place myself under the
  protection of those who hold the power in their hands."</p>

  <p>Such was his confession. The French Consul, unable to find the blood, was
  bent on discovering more criminals; and the servant of David Arari, after
  further pressure, was ready to give further particulars. He said that, after
  the Father had been murdered, he was sent to a rich Israelite, Marad Farhi,
  to invite him to slaughter the servant of the Capuchin friar in the same way
  as his master had been slaughtered. When he took the message, he found the
  young merchant, Isaac Picciotto, present, and delivered his message before
  him. Next day this Picciotto and four other Jews, Marad Farhi, Meir, and
  Assan Farhi, and Aaron Stamboli, all men of wealth, came to his master's
  house, and informed David Arari that they had together murdered the
  Capuchin's serving-man in the house of Meir Farhi. On another occasion this
  same witness, Murad-el-Fallat, said that the murder of the servant took place
  in the house of David Arari; but no importance was attached in this
  remarkable case to contradictions in the evidence.</p>

  <p>Picciotto, as son of a former Austrian Consul, a nephew of the Consul at
  Aleppo, was able to take refuge under the protection of Merlato, the Austrian
  Consul at Damascus. On the demand of Count Ratti-Menton, he was placed on his
  trial, but proved an <i>alibi</i>; on the evening in question, he and his
  wife had been visiting an English gentleman, Mr. George Macson.</p>

  <p>Arari's servant now extended his revelations. He said that he had been
  present at the murder of the attendant on the Capuchin. This man had been
  bound and put to death by seven Jews, namely, by the four already mentioned,
  young Picciotto, Jacob Abul Afia, and Joseph Menachem Farhi.</p>

  <p>The French Consul was dissatisfied that Picciotto should escape. He
  demanded of the Austrian Consul that he should be delivered over to the
  Mussulman Court to be tortured like the rest into confession. The Austrian
  Consul was in a difficult position. He stood alone over against a fanatical
  Christian and an embittered Mohammedan mob, and in resistance to the Egyptian
  Government and the representative of France. But he did not hesitate, he
  absolutely refused to surrender Picciotto. The general excitement was now
  directed against the Consul; he was subjected to suspicion as a favourer of
  the murderers, as even incriminated in the murder. His house was surrounded
  by spies, and every one who entered or left it was an object of mistrust.</p>

  <p>All Damascus was in agitation; everyone sought to bring some evidence
  forward to help on the case against the Jews. According to one account,
  thirty-three&mdash;according to the report of the Austrian Consul,
  sixty-three Jewish children, of from four to ten years old, were seized,
  thrown into prison and tortured, to extract information from them as to the
  whereabouts of their parents and relations&mdash;those charged with the
  murder of the servant, and who had fled and concealed themselves. Those
  witnesses who had appeared before the court to testify to the innocence of
  the accused, were arrested, and treated with Oriental barbarity. Because
  Farach Katasch and Isaac Javoh had declared that they had seen Father Thomas
  on the day of the murder in another quarter of the town than the Ghetto, they
  were put to the torture. Isaac Javoh said he had seen Father Thomas on the
  road to Salachia, two miles from the Jews' quarter, and had there spoken to
  him. He was racked, and died on the rack.</p>

  <p>A boy admitted that he had noticed Father Thomas and his servant in
  another part of the town. For so saying, he was beaten with such barbarity
  that he died twenty-four hours after. A Jewish account from Beyrut says: "A
  Jew dedicated himself to martyrdom for the sanctity of the ever-blessed Name.
  He went before the Governor, and said to him, 'Is this justice you do? It is
  a slander that we employ blood for our Paschal bread; and that it is so is
  known to all civilized governments. You say that the barber, who is a Jew,
  confessed it. I reply that he did so only under the stress of torture. Very
  likely the Father was murdered by Christians or by Turks.' The Governor, and
  the dragoman of the French Consul, Baudin by name, retorted, 'What! you dare
  to charge the murder on Turks or Christians?' and he was ordered to be beaten
  and tortured to death. He was barbarously scourged and hideously tormented,
  and urged all the while to confess the truth. But he cried ever, 'Hear, O
  Israel! The Lord thy God is one Lord!' and so crying he died."</p>

  <p>As the second murder, according to one account, was committed in the house
  of Meir Farhi, Count Ratti-Menton had the water conduits and drains torn up
  all round it, and in the drain near them was found a heap of bones, a bit of
  flesh, and a fragment of leather&mdash;according to one account a portion of
  a shoe, according to that of the Austrian Consul, a portion of a girdle. It
  had&mdash;supposing it to have belonged to the murdered man&mdash;been
  soaking for a month in the drain, nevertheless, the brother of the servant
  who had disappeared identified it as having belonged to the murdered man! Dr.
  Massari, Italian physician to Sheriff Pacha, and Dr. Rinaldo, a doctor
  practising in Damascus, declared that the bones were human remains, but they
  were examined by Dr. Yograssi, who proved them to be&mdash;sheep bones. One
  may judge from this what reliance can be placed on the assumption that the
  first collection of bones that were given Christian burial were those of a
  man, and of Father Thomas. As for the bit of flesh, it was thought to be a
  piece of liver, but whether of a human being or of a beast was uncertain or
  unascertained. The Jews' houses were now subjected to search. Count
  Ratti-Menton swept through the streets at the head of twenty sbirri, entering
  and ransacking houses at his own caprice, the Jews' houses first of all, and
  then such houses of Christians as were supposed to be open as a harbour of
  shelter to the persecuted Israelites. Thus one night he rushed not only into
  the house of, but even the women's bedrooms of a merchant, Aiub, who stood
  under Austrian protection, hunting after secreted Jews, an outrage, in
  popular opinion, even in the East.</p>

  <p>The Jews charged with the murder of the servant had not been secured. The
  greater number of the well-to-do Hebrews had fled the town. A hue-and-cry was
  set up, and the country round was searched. Their families were taken up and
  tortured into confessing where they were. A German traveller then in Damascus
  says that the prisons were crowded with unfortunates, and that the pen
  refuses to detail the torments to which they were subjected to wring from
  them the information required. The wife of Meir Farhi and their child were
  imprisoned, and the child bastinadoed before its mother's eyes. At the three
  hundredth blow the mother's heart gave way, and she betrayed the hiding-place
  of her husband. He was seized. The hippopotamus scourge was flourished over
  his head, and knowing what his fellows had suffered, he confessed himself
  guilty. Assan Farhi, who was caught in his hiding-place, was imprisoned for a
  week in the French Consulate, and then delivered over to Turkish justice.
  Bastinado and the rack convinced him of his guilt, but he found means to
  despatch from his dungeon a letter to Ibrahim Pacha protesting his
  innocence.</p>

  <p>It is as impossible as it is unnecessary to follow the story of the
  persecution in all its details. The circumstances have been given by various
  hands, and as names are not always recorded, it is not always possible to
  distinguish whether single cases are recorded by different writers with
  slight variations, or whether they are reporting different incidents in the
  long story.</p>

  <p>The porter of the Jews' quarters, a man of sixty, died under bastinado, to
  which he was subjected for no other crime than not confessing that he had
  seen the murdered men enter the Ghetto.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, whilst this chase after those accused of the second
  murder was going on, the seven merchants who had confessed to the murder of
  the Father had been lying in prison recovering from their wounds and bruises.
  As they recovered, the sense of their innocence became stronger in them than
  fear for the future and consideration of the past. They withdrew their
  confessions. Again were they beaten and tormented. Thenceforth they remained
  stedfast. Two of the seven, David Arari, aged eighty and Joseph Laniado, not
  much younger, died of their sufferings. Laniado had protested that he could
  bring evidence&mdash;the unimpeachable evidence of Christian merchants at
  Khasbin&mdash;that he had been with them at the time when it was pretended he
  had been engaged on the murder. But he died before these witnesses reached
  Damascus. Then Count Ratti-Menton pressed for the execution of the rest.</p>

  <p>So stood matters when Herr von Hailbronner, whose report on the whole case
  is both fullest and most reliable, for the sequence of events, arrived in
  Damascus. He took pains to collect all the most authentic information he
  could on every particular.</p>

  <p>Damascus was in the wildest commotion. All classes of the people were in a
  condition of fanatic excitement. The suffering caused by the pressure of the
  Egyptian government of Mohamed Ali, the threat of an Oriental war, the plague
  which had broken out in Syria, the quarantine, impeding all trade, were
  matters that were thrust into the background by the all-engrossing story of
  the murder and the persecution of the Jews.</p>

  <p>The condition of the Hebrews in Damascus became daily more precarious. The
  old antagonism, jealousy of their riches, hatred caused by extortionate
  usury, were roused and armed for revenge. The barber, though he had confessed
  that he was guilty of the murder, was allowed to go scot-free, because he had
  betrayed his confederates. What an encouragement was offered to the rabble to
  indulge in false witness against rich Jews, whose wealth was coveted!</p>

  <p>Mohamed Ali's government desired nothing better than the confiscation of
  their goods. A pack of ruffians sought occasion to extract money out of this
  persecution by bribes, or to purchase pardon for past offences by denouncing
  the innocent.</p>

  <p>It is well at this point to look a little closer at the French Consul, the
  Count Ratti-Menton. On him rests the guilt of this iniquitous proceeding,
  rather than on the Mussulman judges. He had been twice bankrupt when French
  Consul in Sicily. Then he had been sent as Consul to Tiflis, where his
  conduct had been so disreputable, that on the representation of the Russian
  Government he had been recalled. He had then been appointed Consul at
  Damascus. In spite of all this, and the discredit with which his conduct with
  regard to the Jews, on account of the murder of Father Thomas, had covered
  him, his part was warmly taken up by the Ultramontane Press, and the French
  Government did its utmost to shield him. M. Thiers even warmly defended him.
  The credit of France was thought to be at stake, and it was deemed advisable
  to stand by the agent of France, and make out a case for him as best might
  be.</p>

  <p>It is quite possible, it is probable, that he was thoroughly convinced
  that the Jews were guilty, but that does not justify his mode of procedure.
  It is possible also that bribes may&mdash;as was said&mdash;have been offered
  him by the Jews if he would desist from his persecution, but that he refused
  these bribes shows that he was either not an unredeemed rascal, or that he
  conceived he had gone too far to withdraw.</p>

  <p>The Turkish and Egyptian authorities acted as always has been and will be
  their manner, after their nature, and in their own interest. We expect of
  them nothing else, but that the representative of one of the most enlightened
  nations of Europe, a man professing himself to be a Christian, and civilized,
  a member of a noble house, should hound on the ignorant and superstitious,
  and give rein to all the worst passions of an Oriental rabble, against a
  helpless and harmless race, that has been oppressed, and ill-treated, and
  slandered for centuries, is never to be looked over and forgiven. The name of
  Ratti-Menton must go down branded to posterity; and it is to be regretted
  that M. Thiers should have allowed his love of his country to so carry him
  away as to induce him to throw the shield over a man of whose guilt he must
  have been perfectly aware, having full information in his hands. This shows
  us to what an extent Gallic vanity will blind the Gallic eye to the plain
  principles of truth and right.</p>

  <p>Ratti-Menton had his agents to assist him&mdash;Baudin, chief of his
  bureau at the Consulate; Francois Salins, a native of Aleppo, who acted as
  interpreter, spy, and guard to the Consulate; Father Tosti, a French
  Lazarist, who, according to the Austrian Consul, "seemed to find in this case
  an opportunity for avenging on the race the death of his Divine Master; also
  a Christian Arab, Sehibli Ayub, a man of bad character, who was well received
  by Ratti-Menton, because of his keenness as spy, and readiness as
  denunciator.</p>

  <p>What followed now passes all belief. After that countless poor Jews had
  been accused, beaten, tortured, and killed, it occurred to the judges that it
  would be as well to ascertain the motive for the crime. It had been said by
  those who had confessed that the Pater and his servant had been put to death
  in order to obtain their blood to mingle with the dough for the Paschal
  wafer. The disappearance of the two men took place on February 5th. Easter
  fell that year on April 18th, so that the blood would have to be preserved
  two months and a half. That was an inconsequence which neither the French
  Consul nor the Egyptian authorities stooped to consider. Orders were issued
  that the Talmud and other sacred books of the Jews should be explored to see
  whether, or rather where in them, the order was given that human blood should
  be mingled with the Paschal dough. When no such commands could be discovered,
  it was concluded that the editions presented for examination were purposely
  falsified.</p>

  <p>Now, there were distinct indications pointing in quite another direction,
  which, if followed, might have elucidated the case, and revealed the actual
  criminals. But these indications were in no case followed. Wildon Pieritz, an
  Evangelical Missionary, then in Damascus, as well as the Austrian Consul,
  agree in stating that three days before the disappearance of Father Thomas he
  was seen in violent altercation with a Turkish mule-driver, who was heard to
  swear he would be the death of the priest. The altercation was so violent
  that the servant of Father Thomas seized the mule-driver by the throat and
  maltreated him so that blood flowed&mdash;probably from his nose. Father
  Thomas lost his temper and cursed the mussulman and his religion. The scene
  created great commotion, and a number of Turks were very angry, amongst them
  was one, a merchant, Abu Yekhyeh, who distinguished himself. Wildon Pieritz
  in a letter to the <i>Journal de Smyrne</i> on May 14th, 1840, declares that
  when the news of the disappearance of Father Thomas began to excite
  attention, this merchant, Abu Yekhyeh, hanged himself.</p>

  <p>We may well inquire how it was that none of these facts came to be
  noticed. The answer is to hand. Every witness that gave evidence which might
  exculpate the accused Jews, and turn attention in another direction, was
  beaten and tortured, consequently, those who could have revealed the truth
  were afraid to do so.</p>

  <p>Even among the Mohammedans complaints arose that the French Consul was
  acting in contravention to their law, and a feeling gradually grew that a
  great injustice was being committed&mdash;that the Jews were innocent. Few
  dared allow this in the first fever of popular excitement, but nevertheless
  it awoke and spread.</p>

  <p>At first the Austrian Consul had been subjected not to annoyance only, but
  to danger of life, so violent had been the popular feeling against him
  because of the protection he accorded to one of the accused. Fortunately Herr
  Merlato was a man of pluck. He was an old soldier who had distinguished
  himself as a marine officer. He not only resolutely protected young
  Picciotto, but he did his utmost to hinder the proceedings of Ratti-Menton;
  he invoked the assistance of the representatives of the other European
  Powers, and finally every Consul, except the French, agreed to unite with him
  in representations to their governments of the iniquitous proceedings of
  Ratti-Menton, and to use their influence with the Egyptian authorities to
  obtain the release of the unhappy accused.</p>

  <p>The bastinadoes and tortures now ceased. Merlato obtained the release of
  several of those who were in confinement; and finally the only Jews who
  remained in prison were the brothers Arari, Mussa Salonichi, and the renegade
  Abul Afia. Of the supposed murderers of the servant only the brothers Farhi
  were still held in chains.</p>

  <p>Matters were in this condition when the news of what had taken place at
  Damascus reached Europe and set all the Jews in commotion. Every effort was
  made by them, in Vienna, Leipzig, Paris and London, indeed in all the great
  cities of Europe, to convince the public of the absurdity of the charge, and
  to urge the governments to interfere in behalf of the sufferers.</p>

  <p>Finally all the representatives of the European governments at Alexandria,
  with the exception of the French, remonstrated with Mohamed Ali. They
  demanded that the investigation should be begun <i>de novo</i>; the French
  Consul-General, M. Cochelet, alone objected. But the action of the Jews of
  Europe had more influence with Mohamed Pacha than the representations of the
  Consuls. The house of Rothschild had taken the matter up, and Sir Moses
  Montefiore started from London, and M. Cremieux from Paris as a diplomatic
  embassy to the Viceroy at Alexandria to convince him, by such means as is
  most efficacious to an Oriental despot, of the innocence of the accused at
  Damascus.</p>

  <p>The arguments these delegates employed were so extremely satisfactory to
  the mind of Mohamed Pacha, that he quashed the charges against the Jews of
  Damascus, in spite of the vehement protest of M. Cochelet, the representative
  of France. When the Viceroy issued a firman ordering the incarcerated Jews to
  be discharged as innocent and suffered to abide in peace, M. Cochelet strove
  in vain to have the firman qualified or altered into a pardon.</p>

  <p>Thus ended one of the most scandalous cases of this century. Unfortunate,
  innocent men were tortured and put to death for a crime that had never been
  proved. That the two Europeans had been murdered was merely matter of
  conjecture. No bodies had been found. There was no evidence worth a rush
  against the accused, and no motive adduced deserving of grave consideration.
  "What inhumanities were committed during the eight months of this
  persecution," wrote Herr Von Hailbronner, "will never be wholly known. But it
  must call up a blush of shame in the face of an European to remember that
  Europeans provoked, favoured and stimulated it to the last."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; SOME ACCUSATIONS AGAINST JEWS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE story just given of the atrocious treatment of the Jews
  of Damascus on a false accusation naturally leads to a brief sketch of their
  treatment in the Middle Ages on similar charges. Not, indeed, that we can
  deal with all of the outrages committed on the sons of Abraham, Isaac, and
  Jacob&mdash;that would require volumes&mdash;but only notice some of those
  which they have had to suffer on the same or analogous false charges.</p>

  <p>These false accusations range under three heads:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. They have been charged with poisoning the wells when there has been an
  outbreak of plague and malignant fever.</p>

  <p>2. They have been charged with stealing the Host and with stabbing it.</p>

  <p>3. Lastly, with having committed murders in order to possess themselves of
  Christian blood, to mingle with the dough wherewith to make their Paschal
  cakes.</p>

  <p>We will leave the first case on one side altogether, and as we have
  already considered one instance&mdash;not by any means the last case of such
  an accusation levied against them in Europe&mdash;we will take it before we
  come to the instances of their being accused of stealing the Host.</p>

  <p>But <i>why</i> should they be supposed to require Christian blood? One
  theory was that by common participation in it, the Jewish community was
  closer bound together; another, that it had a salutary medicinal effect. That
  is to say, having made up their minds in the Middle Ages that Jews did
  sacrifice human beings and drink their blood, they beat about for the
  explanation, and caught at any wild theory that was proposed.[4]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[4] Antonius Bonfinius: Rer. Hungaricarum Dec., v. 1., 3,
  gives <i>four</i> reasons. Thomas Cantipratensis, Lib. II., c. 29, gives
  another and preposterous one, not to be quoted even in Latin.</p>

  <p>John Dubravius in his Bohemian History, under the year 1305, relates: "On
  Good Friday the Jews committed an atrocious crime against a Christian man,
  for they stretched him naked to a cross in a concealed place, and then,
  standing round, spat on him, beat him, and did all they could to him which is
  recorded of their having done to Christ. This atrocious act was avenged by
  the people of Prague upon the Jews, with newly-invented punishments, and of
  their property that was confiscated, a monument was erected." But there were
  cases earlier than this. Perhaps the earliest is that of S. William of
  Norwich, in 1144; next, S. Richard of Paris, 1179; then S. Henry of
  Weissemburg, in Alsace, in 1220; then S. Hugh of Lincoln, in 1255, the case
  of which is recorded by Matthew Paris. A woman at Lincoln lost her son, a
  child eight years old. He was found in a well near a Jew's house. The Jew was
  arrested, and promised his life if he would accuse his brethren of the
  murder. He did so, but was hanged nevertheless. On this accusation ninety-two
  of the richest Jews in Lincoln were arrested, their goods seized to replenish
  the exhausted Royal exchequer; eighteen were hung forthwith, the rest were
  reserved in the Tower of London for a similar fate, but escaped through the
  intervention of the Franciscans, who, says Matthew Paris, were bribed by the
  Jews of England to obtain their release. On May 15th, 1256, thirty-five of
  the wretched Jews were released. We are not told what became of the remaining
  thirty-nine, whether they had been discharged as innocent, or died in prison.
  The story of little Hugh has been charmingly told in Chaucer's Canterbury
  Tales.</p>

  <p>A girl of seven years was found murdered at Pforzheim, in 1271; the Jews
  were accused, mobbed, maltreated, and executed. In 1286, a boy, name unknown,
  disappeared in Munich, with the same results to the Jews. In 1292, a boy of
  nine, at Constance&mdash;same results. In 1303 "the perfidious Jews,
  accustomed to the shedding of Christian blood," says Siffrid, priest of
  Meisen, in 1307, "cruelly murdered a certain scholar, named Conrad, son of a
  knight of Weissensee, in Thuringia, after that they had tortured him, cut all
  his sinews, and opened his veins. This took place before Easter. The
  Almighty, who is glorious in His Saints, however did not suffer the murder of
  the innocent boy to remain concealed, but destroyed the murderers, and
  adorned the martyrdom of their innocent victim with miracles. For when the
  said Jews had taken the body of the lad to many places in Thuringia to bury
  it secretly, by God's disposition they were always foiled in their attempt to
  make away with it. Wherefore, returning to Weissensee, they hung it to a
  vine. Then the truth having been revealed, the soldiers rushed out of the
  castle, and the citizens rose together with the common people, headed by
  Frederick, son of Albert Landgrave of Thuringia, and killed the Jews
  tumultuously."</p>

  <p>The story of St. Werner, the boy murdered by the Jews in 1287, at Wesel,
  on the Rhine, and buried at Bacharach, is well known. The lovely chapel
  erected over his body is now a ruin. But Werner was not the only boy martyred
  by the Jews on the Rhine. Another was St. Johanettus of Siegburg.</p>

  <p>St. Andrew of Heiligenwasser, near Innsbrück, is another case, in 1462;
  St. Ludwig of Ravensburg, in 1429, again another. Six boys were said to have
  been murdered by Jews at Ratisborn, in 1486; and several cases come to us out
  of Spanish history. In Poland, in 1598, in the village of Swinarzew, near
  Lositz, lived a peasant, Matthias Petrenioff, with his wife, Anna. They had
  several children, among them a boy named Adalbert. One day in Holy Week the
  boy was in the fields ploughing with his father. In the evening he was sent
  home, but instead of going home directly, he turned aside to visit the
  village of Woznik, in which lived a Jew, Mark, who owned a pawnshop, and had
  some mills. The son of Mark, named Aaron, and the son-in-law, Isaac, overtook
  the boy as they were returning to Wosnik in their cart and took him up into
  it.</p>

  <p>As the child did not return home, his father went in search of him, and
  hearing that he had been seen in the cart between the two Jews, he went to
  the house of Mark and inquired for him. Mark's wife said she had not seen
  him. The peasant now became frightened. He remembered the stories that
  floated about concerning the murder of Christian children by Jews, and
  concluded that his boy had been put to death by Mark and his co-religionists.
  At length the body of the child was discovered in a pond, probably gnawed by
  rats&mdash;but the marks on the body were at once supposed to be due to the
  weapons of the Jews. Immense excitement reigned in the district, and finally
  two servants of the Jews, both Christians, one Athanasia, belonging to the
  Greek Church, and another, Christina, a Latin, confessed that their masters
  had murdered the boy. He had been concealed in a cellar till the eve of the
  Passover, when the chief Jews of the district had been assembled, and the boy
  had been bled to death in their presence. The blood was put into small phials
  and each Jew provided with one at least. This led to a general arrest of the
  Jews, when the rack produced the requisite confession. Isaac, son-in-law of
  Mark, in whose house the butchery was said to have taken place, declared
  under torture that the Jews partook of the blood of Christians in bread, and
  also in wine, but he professed to be unable to account for the custom.
  Filled, however, with remorse for having thus falsely accused his people and
  his relatives, he hung himself in prison. Mark and Aaron were condemned to be
  torn to pieces alive; and, of course, the usual spoliation ensued. We have
  the account of this atrocious judicial murder from the pen of a Jesuit,
  Szembeck, who extracted the particulars from the acts of the court of Lublin,
  in which the case was tried, and from those drawn up by order of the bishop
  of the diocese of Luz, in which the murder occurred, and who obtained or
  sanctioned a canonization of the boy-martyr.</p>

  <p>Another still more famous case is that of S. Simeon, of Trent, in 1475,
  very full details of which are given in the Acta Sanctorum of the
  Bollandists, as the victim was formally canonized by Pope Benedict XIV., and
  the Roman Martyrology asserts the murder by the Jews in these
  terms:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"At Trent (on March 24th) the martyrdom of S. Simeon, a little child,
  cruelly slain by the Jews, who was glorified afterwards by several
  miracles."</p>

  <p>The story as told and approved at the canonization was as follows: On
  Tuesday, in Holy Week, 1475, the Jews met to prepare for the approaching
  Passover, in the house of one of their number, named Samuel; and it was
  agreed between three of them, Samuel, Tobias, and Angelus, that a child
  should be crucified, as an act of revenge against the Christians who cruelly
  maltreated them. Their difficulty, however, was how to get one. Samuel
  sounded his servant Lazarus, and attempted to bribe him into procuring one,
  but the suggestion so scared the fellow that he ran away. On the Thursday,
  Tobias undertook to get the boy, and going out in the evening, whilst the
  people were in church, he prowled about till he found a child sitting on the
  threshold of his father's door, aged twenty-nine months, and named Simeon.
  The Jew began to coax the little fellow to follow him, and the boy, after
  being lured away, was led to the house of Samuel, whence during the night he
  was conveyed to the synagogue, where he was bled to death, and his body
  pierced with awls.</p>

  <p>All Friday the parents sought their son, but found him not. The Jews,
  alarmed at the proceedings of the magistrates, who had taken the matter up,
  consulted together what was to be done. It was resolved to put the body back
  into its clothes and throw it into the stream that ran under Samuel's window,
  but which was there crossed by a grating. Tobias was to go to the bishop and
  magistrates and inform them that a child's body was entangled in the grate.
  This was done. Thereupon John de Salis, the bishop, and James de Sporo, the
  governor, went to see the spot, had the body removed, and conveyed to the
  cathedral. As, according to popular superstition, blood was supposed to flow
  from the wound when a murderer drew near, the officers of justice were
  cautioned to observe the crowds as they passed.</p>

  <p>It was declared that blood exuded as Tobias approached. On the strength of
  this, the house of Samuel and the synagogue were examined, and it is asserted
  that blood and other traces of the butchery were found. The most eminent
  physicians were called to investigate the condition of the corpse, and they
  pronounced that the child had been strangled, and that the wounds were due to
  stabs. The popular voice now accusing the Jews, the magistrates seized on
  them and threw them into prison, and on the accusation of a renegade more
  than five of the Jews were sentenced to death. They were broken on the wheel
  and then burnt. The body of the child is enshrined at Trent, and a basin of
  the blood preserved as a relic in the cathedral.</p>

  <p>This must suffice for instances of accusations of murder for religious
  purposes brought against the Jews, in every case false. Another charge
  brought against them was Sacrilege. Fleury in his Ecclesiastical History
  gives one instance. "In the little town of Pulca, in Passau, a layman found a
  bloody Host before the house of a Jew, lying in the street upon some straw.
  The people thought that this Host was consecrated, and washed it and took it
  to the priest, that it might be taken to the church, where a crowd of
  devotees assembled, concluding that the blood had flowed miraculously from
  wounds dealt it by the Jews. On this supposition, and without any other
  examination, or any other judicial procedure, the Christians fell on the
  Jews, and killed several of them; but wiser heads judged that this was rather
  for the sake of pillage than to avenge a sacrilege. This conjecture was
  justified by a similar event, that took place a little while before at
  Neuburg, in the same diocese, where a certain clerk placed an unconsecrated
  Host steeped in blood in a church, but confessed afterwards before the bishop
  that he had dipped this Host in blood for the purpose of raising hostility
  against the Jews."[5]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[5] Fleury, Hist. Eccl., vi. p. 110.</p>

  <p>In 1290, a Jew named Jonathan was accused in Paris of having thrown a Host
  into the Seine. It floated. Then he stabbed it with his knife, and blood
  flowed. The Jew was burnt alive, and the people clamored for a general
  persecution of the Hebrews.</p>

  <p>In Bavaria, in 1337, at Dechendorf, some Hosts were discovered which the
  Jews had stabbed. The unhappy Hebrews were burnt alive.</p>

  <p>In 1326, a Jew convert, a favourite of Count William the Good, of
  Flanders, was accused of having struck an image of the Madonna, which
  thereupon bled. The Jew was tortured, but denied the accusation. Then he was
  challenged to a duel by a fanatic. He, wholly unaccustomed to the use of
  weapons, succumbed. That sufficed to prove his guilt. He was burnt.</p>

  <p>In 1351, a Jew convert was accused, at Brussels, of having pretended, on
  three occasions, to communicate, in order that he might send the Hosts to his
  brethren at Cologne, who stabbed them, and blood flowed.</p>

  <p>The traveller who has been in Brussels must certainly have noticed the
  painted windows all down the nave of S. Gudule, in the side aisles, to left
  and right. They represent, in glowing colours, the story of the miraculous
  Hosts preserved in the chancel to the north of the choir, where seven red
  lamps burn perpetually before them.</p>

  <p>The story is as follows: In 1370, a rich Jew of Enghien bribed a converted
  Hebrew, named John of Louvain, for 60 pieces of gold, to steal for him some
  Hosts from the Chapel of S. Catherine. Hardly, however, had the Jew,
  Jonathan, received the wafers, before he was attacked by robbers and
  murdered. His wife, alarmed, and thinking that his death was due to the
  sacrilege, resolved to get rid of the wafers. It may have been remarked in
  the stories of murders by Jews, that they were represented as finding great
  difficulty in getting rid of the dead bodies. In these stories of sacrilege,
  no less difficulty was encountered in causing the disappearance of the Hosts.
  Moreover, the Jews invariably proceeded in the most roundabout and clumsy
  way, inviting discovery. The widow of the murdered Jonathan conveyed the
  Hosts to the synagogue at Brussels. There, on Good Friday, the Jews took
  advantage of the Hosts to stab them with their knives, in mockery of Christ
  and the Christian religion. But blood squirted from the transfixed wafers. In
  terror, they also resolved to get rid of the miraculous Hosts, and found no
  better means of so doing than bribing a renegade Jewess, named Catharine, to
  carry them to Cologne. They promised her twenty pieces of gold for her pains.
  She took the Hosts, but, troubled in conscience, revealed what she had
  undertaken to her confessor. The ecclesiastical authorities were informed,
  Catherine was arrested, imprisoned, and confessed. All the Jews dwelling in
  Brussels were taken up and tortured; but in spite of all torture refused to
  acknowledge their guilt. However, a chaplain of the prince, a man named Jean
  Morelli, pretended to have overheard a converted Jew say, "Why do not these
  dogs make a clean breast? They know that they are guilty." This man was that
  John of Louvain who had procured the theft of the wafers. He was seized. He
  at once confessed his participation in the crime. That sufficed. All the
  accused, he himself included, were condemned to death. They were executed
  with hideous cruelty; after having had their flesh torn off by red-hot
  pinchers, they were attached to stakes and burnt alive, on the Vigil of the
  Ascension, 1370. Every year a solemn procession of the Saint Sacrement de
  Miracle commemorates this atrocity, or the miracle which led to it.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, there exists no doubt whatever as to the horrible execution
  of the Jews on the false charge of having stolen the Hosts, but there is very
  good reason for disbelieving altogether the story of the miracle of the
  bleeding Hosts.</p>

  <p>Now, it is somewhat remarkable that not a word is said about this miracle
  before 1435, that is to say, for 65 years, by any writer of the period and of
  the country. The very first mention of it is found in a Papal bull of that
  date, addressed to the Dean and Chapter of S. Gudule, relative to a petition
  made by them that, as they wanted money for the erection of a chapel to
  contain these Hosts, indulgences might be granted to those who would
  contribute thereto. The Pope granted their request.</p>

  <p>Now, it so happens that the official archives at Brussels contains two
  documents of the date, 1370, relative to this trial. The first of these is
  the register of the accounts of the receiver-general of the Duke of Brabant.
  In that are the items of expenditure for the burning of these Jews, a
  receipt, and the text is as follows: "Item, recepta de bonis dictorum
  judeorum, postquam combusti fuerant circa ascensionem Domini lxx, quæ
  defamata fuerant de sacramentis punicè et furtivè acceptis." That is to say,
  that a certain sum flowed into the Duke's exchequer from the goods of the
  Jews, burnt for having "guiltily and furtively obtained the Hosts." "Punice"
  is an odd word, but its signification is clear enough. Now, in 1581, on May
  1st, the magistrates of Brussels forbade the exercise of the Catholic
  religion, in a proclamation in which, when mentioning certain frauds
  committed by the Roman Church, they speak of "The Sacrament of the Miracle,
  which," say they, "by documentary evidence can be proved never to have bled
  nor to have been stabbed." No question&mdash;they had seen this entry in
  which no mention is made of the stabbing&mdash;no allusion made to the
  bleeding. Moreover, in the same archives is the contemporary episcopal letter
  addressed to the Dean of S. Gudule on the subject of these Hosts. In this
  document there is no mention made by the bishop of the stabbing or of the
  miracle. It is stated that the Hosts were obtained by the Jews in order that
  they might insult and outrage them. It is curious that the letter should not
  specify their having done this, and done it effectually, with their knives
  and daggers. Most assuredly, also, had there been any suspicion of a miracle,
  the bishop would have referred to it in the letter relative to the custody of
  these very Hosts.</p>

  <p>After the whole fable of the stabbing and bleeding had grown up, no doubt
  applied to these Hosts from a preceding case of accusation against Jews, that
  of 1351, less than thirty years before, it was thought advisable, if not
  necessary, to produce some evidence in favour of the story; but as no such
  evidence was obtainable, it was manufactured in a very ingenious manner. The
  entry in the register of accounts was published by the Père Ydens, after a
  notary had been required to collate the text. This notary&mdash;his name was
  Van Asbroek&mdash;gave his testimony that he had made an exact and literal
  transcript of the entry. What he and the Père Ydens gave as their exact,
  literal transcript was "recepta de bonis dictorum Judoeorum ... quæ defamata
  fuerant de sacramen<i>to puncto</i> et furtive accep<i>to</i>." Ingenious,
  but disingenuous. In the first place they altered "sacramentis" from plural
  into singular, and then, the adverb <i>punicè</i>, "guiltily," into
  <i>puncto</i>, stabbed.</p>

  <p>Subsequently, Father Ydens and his notary have been quoted and requoted as
  authoritative witnesses. However, the document is now in the Archives at
  Brussels, and has been lithographed from a photograph for the examination of
  such as have not the means of obtaining access to the original.[6] The last
  jubilee of this apocryphal miracle was celebrated at Brussels in July,
  1870.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE COBURG MAUSOLEUM</h2>

  <p class="first">AT the east end of the garden of the Ducal residence of
  Coburg is a small, tastefully constructed mausoleum, adorned with allegorical
  subjects, in which are laid the remains of the deceased dukes. Near the
  mausoleum rise a stately oak, a clump of rhododendron, a cluster of acacias,
  and a group of yews and weeping-willows.</p>

  <p>The mausoleum is hidden from the palace by a plantation of young
  pines.</p>

  <p>The Castle of Coburg is one of the most interesting and best preserved in
  Germany. It stands on a height, above the little town, and contains much rich
  wood-carving of the 15th and 16th centuries. Below the height, but a little
  above the town, is the more modern residence of the Dukes Ehrenburg, erected
  in 1626 by the Italian architect Bonallisso, and finished in 1693. It has
  that character of perverse revolt against picturesqueness that marked all the
  edifices of the period. It has been restored, not in the best style, at the
  worst possible epoch, 1816. The south front remains least altered; it is
  adorned with a handsome gateway, over which is the inscription, "Fried
  ernährt, Unfried verzehrt"&mdash;not easily rendered in English:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Peace doth cherish&mdash; Strife makes perish."</p>

  <p>The princes of Coburg by their worth and kindly behaviour have for a
  century drawn to them the hearts of their subjects, and hardly a princely
  house in Germany is, and has been, more respected and loved.</p>

  <p>Duke Franz died shortly after the battle of Jena. During his reign, by his
  thrift, geniality, and love of justice he had won to his person the
  affections of his people, though they resented the despotic character of his
  government under his Minister Kretschmann. He was twice married, but left
  issue only by the second wife, Augusta, a princess of Reuss, who inherited
  the piety and virtues which seem to be inrooted in that worthy house.</p>

  <p>Only a few weeks after her return from Brussels, where she had seen her
  son, recently crowned King of the Belgians, did the Duchess Augusta of
  Sachsen-Coburg die in her seventy-sixth year, November 16th, 1831. The
  admiration and love this admirable princess had inspired drew crowds to visit
  the body, as it lay in state in the residence at Coburg, prior to the
  funeral, which took place on the 19th, before day-break, by the light of
  torches. The funeral was attended by men and women of all classes eager to
  express their attachment to the deceased, and respect for the family. A great
  deal was said, and fabled, concerning this funeral. It was told and believed
  that the Dowager Duchess had been laid in the family vault adorned with her
  diamond rings and richest necklaces. She was the mother of kings, and the
  vulgar believed that every royal and princely house with which she was allied
  had contributed some jewel towards the decoration of her body.</p>

  <p>Her eldest son, Ernst I., succeeded his father in 1806 as Duke of
  Sachsen-Coburg-Saalfeld, and in 1826 became Duke of Sachsen-Coburg-Gotha. The
  second son, Ferdinand, married in 1816 the wealthiest heiress of Hungary, the
  Princess Rohary, and his son, Ferdinand, became in 1836 King of Portugal, and
  his grandson, Ferdinand, by his second son, is the present reigning Prince of
  Bulgaria.</p>

  <p>The third son, Leopold, married Charlotte, only daughter of George IV. of
  England, and in 1831 became King of the Belgians. Of the five daughters, the
  eldest was married to the Grand-Duke Constantine of Russia, the second
  married the Duke of Kent, in 1818, and was the mother of our Queen, Victoria.
  The third married Duke Alexander of Würtemberg.</p>

  <p>Among those who were present at the funeral of the Duchess Augusta was a
  Bavarian, named Andreas Stubenrauch, an artisan then at Coburg. He was the
  son of an armourer, followed his father's profession, and had settled at
  Coburg as locksmith. He was a peculiarly ugly man, with low but broad brow,
  dark-brown bristly hair, heavy eyebrows and small cunning grey eyes. His nose
  was a snub, very broad with huge nostrils, his complexion was pale; he had a
  large mouth, and big drooping underlip. His short stature, his lack of
  proportion in build, and his uncomely features, gave him the appearance of a
  half-witted man. But though he was not clever he was by no means a fool. His
  character was in accordance with his appearance. He was a sullen,
  ill-conditioned, intemperate man.</p>

  <p>Stubenrauch had been one of the crowd that had passed by the bed on which
  the Duchess lay in state, and had cast covetous eyes at the jewellery with
  which the body was adorned. He had also attended the funeral, and had come to
  the conclusion that the Duchess was buried with all the precious articles he
  had noticed about her, as exposed to view before the burial, and with a great
  deal more, which popular gossip asserted to have been laid in the coffin with
  her.</p>

  <p>The thought of all this waste of wealth clung to his mind, and Stubenrauch
  resolved to enter the mausoleum and rob the body. The position of the vault
  suited his plans, far removed and concealed from the palace, and he made
  little account of locks and bars, which were likely to prove small hindrances
  to an accomplished locksmith.</p>

  <p>To carry his plan into execution, he resolved on choosing the night of
  August 18-19, 1832. On this evening he sat drinking in a low tavern till 10
  o'clock, when he left, returned to his lodgings, where he collected the tools
  he believed he would require, a candle and flint and steel, and then betook
  himself to the mausoleum.</p>

  <p>In the first place, he found it necessary to climb over a wall of boards
  that encircled the portion of the grounds where was the mausoleum, and then,
  when he stood before the building, he found that to effect an entrance would
  take him more time and give him more work than he had anticipated.</p>

  <p>The mausoleum was closed by an iron gate formed of strong bars eight feet
  high, radiating from a centre in a sort of semicircle and armed with sharp
  spikes. He found it impossible to open the lock, and he was therefore obliged
  to climb over the gate, regardless of the danger of tearing himself on the
  barbs. There was but a small space between the spikes and the arch of the
  entrance, but through this he managed to squeeze his way, and so reach the
  interior of the building, without doing himself any injury.</p>

  <p>Here he found a double stout oaken door in the floor that gave access to
  the vault. The two valves were so closely dovetailed into one another and
  fitted so exactly, that he found the utmost difficulty in getting a tool
  between them. He tried his false keys in vain on the lock, and for a long
  time his efforts to prise the lock open with a lever were equally futile. At
  length by means of a wedge he succeeded in breaking a way through the
  junction of the doors, into which he could insert a bar, and then he heaved
  at one valve with all his might, throwing his weight on the lever. It took
  him fully an hour before he could break open the door. Midnight struck as the
  valve, grating on its hinges, was thrown back. But now a new and unexpected
  difficulty presented itself. There was no flight of steps descending into the
  vault, as he had anticipated, and he did not know the depth of the lower
  pavement from where he stooped, and he was afraid to light a candle and let
  it down to explore the distance.</p>

  <p>But Stubenrauch was not a man to be dismayed by difficulties. He climbed
  back over the iron-spiked gates into the open air, and sought out a long and
  stout pole, with which to sound the depth, so as to know what measures he was
  to take to descend. Going into the Ducal orchard, he pulled up a pole to
  which a fruit tree was tied, and dragged it to the mausoleum, and with
  considerable difficulty got it through the gateway, which he again surmounted
  with caution and without injury to himself.</p>

  <p>Then, leaning over the opening, holding the pole in both hands, he
  endeavoured to feel the depth of the vault. In so doing he lost his balance,
  and the weight of the pole dragged him down, and he fell between two coffins
  some twelve feet below the floor of the upper chamber. There he lay for some
  little while unconscious, stunned by his fall. When he came to himself, he
  sat up, felt about with his hands to ascertain where he was, and considered
  what next should be done.</p>

  <p>Without a moment's thought as to how he was to escape from his position,
  about the possibility of which he was not in the smallest doubt, knowing as
  he did his own agility and readiness with expedients, he set to work to
  accomplish his undertaking. With composure Stubenrauch now struck a light and
  kindled the candle. When he had done this, he examined the interior of the
  vault, and the coffins he found there, so as to select the right one. Those
  of the Duchess Augusta and her husband the late Duke were very much alike, so
  much so that the ruffian had some difficulty in deciding which was the right
  one. He chose, however, correctly that which seemed freshest, and he tore off
  it the black cover. Under this he found the coffin very solid, fastened by
  two locks, which were so rusted that his tools would not turn in them. He had
  not his iron bar and other implements with him now; they were above on the
  floor of the upper chamber. With great difficulty he succeeded at length in
  breaking one of the hinges, and he was then able to snap the lower lock,
  whereas that at the top resisted all his efforts. However, the broken hinge
  and lock enabled him to lift the lid sufficiently for him to look inside. Now
  he hoped to be able to insert his hand, and remove all the jewellery he
  supposed was laid there with the dead lady. To his grievous disappointment he
  saw nothing save the fading remains of the Duchess, covered with a glimmering
  white mould, that seemed to him to be phosphorescent. The body was in black
  velvet, the white luminous hands crossed over the breast. Stubenrauch was not
  the man to feel either respect for the dead or fear of aught supernatural.
  With both hands he sustained the heavy lid of the coffin as he peered in, and
  the necessity for using both to support the weight prevented his profane hand
  from being laid on the remains of an august and pious princess. Stubenrauch
  did indeed try more than once to sustain the lid with one hand, that he might
  grope with the other for the treasures he fancied must be concealed there,
  but the moment he removed one hand the lid crashed down.</p>

  <p>Disappointed in his expectations, Stubenrauch now replaced the cover, and
  began to consider how he might escape. But now&mdash;and now only&mdash;did
  he discover that it was not possible for him to get out of the vault into
  which he had fallen. The pole on which he had placed his confidence was too
  short to reach to the opening above. Every effort made by Stubenrauch to
  scramble out failed. He was caught in a trap&mdash;and what a trap! Nemesis
  had fallen on the ruffian at once, on the scene of his crime, and condemned
  him to betray himself.</p>

  <p>Although now for the first time deadly fear came over him, as he afterward
  asserted, it was fear because he anticipated punishment from men, not any
  dread of the wrath of the spirits of those into whose domain he had entered.
  When he had convinced himself that escape was quite impossible, he submitted
  to the inevitable, lay down between the two coffins and tried to go to sleep;
  but, as he himself admitted, he was not able to sleep soundly.</p>

  <p>Morning broke&mdash;it was Sunday, and a special festival at Coburg, for
  it was the twenty-fifth anniversary of the accession of the Duke, so that the
  town was in lively commotion, and park and palace were also in a stir.</p>

  <p>Stubenrauch sat up and waited in hopes of hearing someone draw near who
  could release him. About 9 o'clock in the morning he heard steps on the
  gravel, and at once began to shout for assistance.</p>

  <p>The person who had approached ran away in alarm, declaring that strange
  and unearthly noises issued from the Ducal mausoleum. The guard was apprised,
  but would not at first believe the report. At length one of the sentinels was
  despatched to the spot, and he returned speedily with the tidings that there
  certainly was a man in the vault. He had peered through the grating at the
  entrance and had seen the door broken open and a crowbar and other articles
  lying about.</p>

  <p>The gate was now opened, and Stubenrauch removed in the midst of an
  assembled crowd of angry and dismayed spectators. He was removed to prison,
  tried, and condemned to eighteen months with hard labour.</p>

  <p>That is not the end of the story. After his discharge, Stubenrauch never
  settled into regular work. In 1836 he was taken up for theft, and again on
  the same charge in 1844. In the year 1854 he was discovered dead in a little
  wood near his home; between the fingers of his right hand was a pinch of
  snuff, and in his left hand a pistol with which he had blown out his own
  brains. In his pockets were found a purse and a brandy bottle, both
  empty.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; JEAN AYMON</h2>

  <p class="first">JEAN AYMON was born in Dauphiné, in 1661, of Catholic
  parents. He studied in the college of Grenoble. His family, loving him,
  neglected nothing which might contribute to the improvement of his mind, and
  the professors of Grenoble laboured to perfect their intelligent pupil in
  mathematics, languages, and history.</p>

  <p>From Grenoble, Aymon betook himself to Turin, where he studied theology
  and philosophy. But there was one thing neither parents nor professors were
  able to implant in the young man&mdash;a conscience. He was thoroughly well
  versed in all the intricacies of moral theology and the subtleties of the
  school-men; he regarded crime and sin as something deadly indeed, but deadly
  only to other persons. Theft was a mortal sin to every one but himself. Truth
  was a virtue to be strictly inculcated, but not to be practised in his own
  case.</p>

  <p>His parents, thinking he would grow out of this obliquity of moral vision,
  persisted in their scheme of education for the lad&mdash;probably the very
  worst which, with his peculiar bent of mind, they could have chosen for him.
  Having finished his studies at Turin, his evil star led him to Rome, where
  his talents soon drew attention to him, and Hercules de Berzet, Bishop of
  Saint Jean de Maurienne, in Savoy, named him chaplain, and had him ordained,
  by brief of Innocent XI., before the age fixed by the Council of Trent,
  "because of the probity of his life, his virtues and other
  merits!"&mdash;such were the reasons.</p>

  <p>Shortly after his installation as chaplain to the bishop, his patron
  entrusted him with a delicate case. De Berzet had lately been deep in an
  intrigue to obtain a cardinal's hat. He had been disappointed, and he was
  either bent on revenge, or, perhaps, hoped to frighten the Pope into giving
  him that which he had solicited in vain. He set to work, raking up all the
  scandal of the Papal household, and acting the spy upon all the movements of
  the familiars of the court. After a very little while, this worthy prelate
  had succeeded in gathering together enough material to make all the ears in
  Europe tingle, and this was put into the hands of the young priest to work
  into form for publication.</p>

  <p>As Aymon looked through these scandalous memoirs, he made his own
  reflections. "The publication of this will raise a storm, undoubtedly; but
  the first who will perish in it will be my patron, and all who sail in his
  boat." Aymon noticed that M. de Camus, Bishop of Grenoble, was most
  compromised by the papers in his hands, and would be most interested in their
  suppression. Aymon, without hesitation, tied up the bundle, put it in his
  pocket, and presented himself before the bishop, ready to make them over to
  him for a consideration. He was well received, as may be supposed, and in
  return for the papers was given a living in the diocese. But this did not
  satisfy the restless spirit of Aymon; he had imbibed a taste for intrigue,
  and there was no place like the Eternal City for indulging this taste. He
  was, moreover, dissatisfied with his benefice, and expected greater rewards
  for the service he had done to the Church. Innocent XI. received him well,
  and in 1687 appointed him his protonotary. Further he did not advance. At the
  Papal Court he made his observations, and whether it was that he was felt to
  be somewhat of a spy, or through some intrigue, his star began to set, when
  Aymon, too well aware that a falling man may sink very low, suddenly fled
  from Rome, crossed the border into Switzerland, and in a few days was a
  convert to the straitest sect of the Calvinists. But the Swiss are poor, and
  their ministers are in comfortable, though not lucrative positions. Holland
  was the paradise of Calvinism, and to Holland Aymon repaired. Here he
  obtained a cure of importance, and married a lady of rank.</p>

  <p>But even now, Aymon was not satisfied. Among the Protestants of the Low
  Countries there are no bishops, and no man can soar higher than the pulpit of
  a parish church. Aymon was convinced that he had climbed as high as he could
  in the Church of Calvin, and that he had a soul for something higher still.
  His next step was extraordinary enough. He wrote in December, 1705, to M.
  Clement, of the Bibliothèque du Roi, at Paris, stating that he had in his
  possession the "Herbal" of the celebrated Paul Hermann, in forty folio
  volumes, and that he offered it to the King for 3200 livres, a trifle over
  what it had cost him. He added that he was a renegade priest, who had sought
  rest in Protestantism, but had found none&mdash;nay! he had discovered it to
  be a hot-bed of every kind of vice, and that he yearned for the Church of his
  baptism. He hinted that he had made some discoveries of the utmost political
  importance, and that he would communicate them to the King if he could be
  provided with a passport.</p>

  <p>Clement made inquiries of the superintendent of the Jardin-Royal as to the
  expediency of purchasing the "Herbal," and received a reply in the
  negative.</p>

  <p>Aymon wrote again, saying little more of the "Herbal," and developing his
  schemes. He said that he had State secrets to confide to the Ministers of the
  Crown, besides which, he volunteered to compose a large and important work on
  the state of Protestantism, "full of proofs so authentic, and so numerous,
  that, if given to the light of day, as I purpose, it would probably not only
  restrain all those who meditate seceding from the Roman Church, but also
  would persuade all those, who are not blinded by their passions, to return to
  the Catholic faith."</p>

  <p>Clement, uncertain what to answer, showed these letters to some clergy of
  his acquaintance, and, acting on their advice, he presented them to M. de
  Pontchartrain, who communicated the proposal of Aymon to the King.</p>

  <p>A passport was immediately granted, and Aymon left Holland, assuring his
  congregation that he was going for a little while to Constantinople on
  important matters of religion.</p>

  <p>On his arrival in Paris, he presented himself before M. Clement, to assure
  him of the fervour of his zeal and the earnestness of his conversion. Clement
  received him cordially, and took him to Versailles to see M. de
  Pontchartrain. In this interview Aymon made great promises of being
  serviceable to the Church and to the State, by the revelations he was about
  to make; but M. de Pontchartrain treated his protestations very lightly, and
  handed him over to the Cardinal de Noailles, Archbishop of Paris.</p>

  <p>The conference with the cardinal was long. The archbishop addressed a
  homily to the repentant sinner, who listened with hands crossed on his
  breast, his eyes bent to earth, and his cheeks suffused with tears. Aymon
  sighed forth that he had quitted the camp of the Amalekites for ever, and
  that he was determined to turn against them their own weapons. Clement, who
  was present, now stepped forward and reminded the prelate that Aymon had
  abandoned a lucrative situation, at the dictates of conscience, and that
  though he might, of course, expect to be rewarded hereafter, still that
  remuneration in this life would not interfere with these future prospects.
  The cardinal quite approved of this sentiment, and promised to see what he
  could do for the convert. In the meantime, he wished Aymon to spend a retreat
  in some religious house, where he could meditate on the error of his past
  life, and expiate, as far as in him lay, his late delinquencies by rigorous
  penances. Aymon thanked the cardinal for thus, unasked, granting him the
  request which was uppermost in his thoughts, and then begged to be allowed
  the use of the Royal Library, in which to pursue his theological researches,
  and to examine the documents which were necessary for the execution of his
  design of writing a triumphant vindication of the Catholic faith, and a
  complete exposure of the abominations of Protestantism. M. Clement readily
  accorded this, at the request of the archbishop, and Jean Aymon was sent to
  the seminary of the Missions Etrangères.</p>

  <p>Aymon now appeared as a model penitent. He spent a considerable part of
  the night in prayer before the altar, he was punctual in his attendance on
  all the public exercises of religion, and his conversation, morning, noon,
  and night, was on the errors and disorders of the Calvinist Church. When not
  engaged in devotions, he was at the library, where he was indefatigable in
  his research among manuscripts which could throw light on the subject upon
  which he was engaged. Indeed, his enthusiasm and his zeal for discoveries
  wearied the assistants. Clement himself was occupied upon the catalogues, and
  was unable to dance attendance on Aymon; and the assistants soon learned to
  regard him as a bookworm who would keep them on the run, supplying him with
  fresh materials, if they did not leave him to do pretty much what he
  liked.</p>

  <p>Time passed, and Aymon heard no more of the reward promised by the
  cardinal. He began to murmur, and to pour his complaints into the reluctant
  ear of Clement, who soon became so tired of hearing them, that the appearance
  of Aymon's discontented face in the library was a signal for him to plead
  business and hurry into another apartment. Aymon declared that he should most
  positively publish nothing till the king or the cardinal made up to him the
  losses he had endured by resigning his post in Holland.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, to Clement's great relief, Aymon disappeared from the
  library. At first he was satisfied to be freed from him, and made no
  inquiries; but after a while, hearing that he had also left the Missions
  Etrangères, he made search for the missing man. He was nowhere to be
  found.</p>

  <p>About this time Aymon's congregation at the Hague were gratified by the
  return of their pastor, not much bronzed by exposure to the sun of
  Constantinople, certainly, but with his trunks well-stocked with valuable
  MSS.</p>

  <p>A little while after, M. Clement received the following note from a French
  agent resident at the Hague:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Information is required relative to a certain Aymon, who says that he was
  chaplain to M. le Cardinal de Camus, and apostolic protonotary. After having
  lived some while at the Hague, whither he had come from Switzerland, where he
  had embraced the so-called Reformed religion, he disappeared, and it was
  ascertained that he was at Paris, whither he had taken an Arabic Koran in
  MS., which he had stolen from a bookseller at the Hague. He has only lately
  returned, laden with spoils&mdash;thefts, one would rather say, which he must
  have made at Paris, where he has been spending five or six months in some
  publicity.... He has with him the Acts of the last Council of Jerusalem held
  by the Greeks on the subject of Transubstantiation, and some other documents
  supposed to be stolen from the Bibliothèque du Roi. The man has powerful
  supporters in this country.&mdash;March 10, 1707."</p>

  <p>The "Council of Jerusalem" was one of the most valuable MSS. of the
  library&mdash;and it was in the hands of Aymon! Clement flew to the cabinet
  where this inestimable treasure was preserved under lock and key. The cabinet
  was safely enough locked&mdash;but alas! the MS. was no longer there.</p>

  <p>A few days after, Clement heard that Aymon had crossed the frontier with
  several heavy boxes, which, on inquiry, proved to be full of books. What
  volumes were they? The collections in the Royal Library consisted of 12,500
  MSS. The whole had to be gone through. It was soon ascertained that another
  missing book was the original Italian despatches and letters of Carlo
  Visconti, Apostolic Nuncio at the Council of Trent.</p>

  <p>There was no time to be lost. Clement wrote to the Hague to claim the
  stolen volumes, and to institute legal proceedings for their recovery, before
  the collection could be dispersed, and he appointed, with full powers,
  William de Voys, bookseller at the Hague, to seize the two volumes said to be
  in the possession of Aymon.</p>

  <p>A little while after some more MSS. volumes were missed; they were "The
  Italian Letters of Prospero S Croce, Nuncio of Pius IV," "The Embassy of the
  Bishop of Angoulême to Rome in 1560-4," "Le Registre des taxes de la
  Chancellerie Romaine," "Dialogo politico sopra i tumulti di Francia," nine
  Chinese MSS., a copy of the Gospels of high antiquity in uncial characters,
  another copy of the Gospels, no less valuable, and the Epistles of S. Paul,
  also very ancient.</p>

  <p>Shortly after this, two Swiss, passing through the Hague, were shown by
  Aymon some MSS. which agreed with those mentioned as lost from the Royal
  Library; but besides these, they saw numerous loose sheets, inscribed with
  letters of gold, and apparently belonging to a MS. of the Bible. Clement had
  now to go through each MS. in the library and find what had been subtracted
  from them. Fourteen sheets were gone from the celebrated Bible of S. Denys.
  From the Pauline Epistles and Apocalypse, a MS. of the seventh century, and
  one of the most valuable treasures of the library, thirty-five sheets had
  been cut. There were other losses of less importance.</p>

  <p>Whilst Clement was making these discoveries, De Voys brought an action
  against Aymon for the recovery of the "Council of Jerusalem" and the "Letters
  of Visconti."</p>

  <p>Jean Aymon was not, however, a man to be despoiled of what he had once
  got. He knew his position perfectly, and he knew the temper of those around
  him. He was well aware that in order to gain his cause he had only to excite
  popular passion. His judges were enemies to both France and Catholicism, he
  had but to make them believe that a plot was formed against him by French
  Papists for obtaining possession of certain MSS. which he had, and which
  contained a harvest of scandals and revelations overwhelming to Catholics,
  and he knew that his cause was safe.</p>

  <p>He accordingly published a defence, bearing the following
  title:&mdash;"Letter of the Sieur Aymon, Minister of the Holy Gospel, to M.
  N., Professor of Theology, to inform people of honour and savants of the
  extraordinary frauds of certain Papistical doctors and of the vast efforts
  they are now making, along with some perverted Protestants, who are striving
  together to ruin, by their impostures, the Sieur Aymon, and to deprive him of
  several MSS., &amp;c."&mdash;La Haye, dated 1707. Aymon in his pamphlet took
  high moral ground. He was not pleading his own cause. Persecuted, hunted down
  by Papists, by enemies of the Republic and of the religion of Christ, he
  scorned their calumnies and despised their rage. He would bow under the
  storm, he would endure the persecution cheerfully&mdash;for "Blessed are
  those that are persecuted for righteousness' sake;" but higher interests were
  at stake than his own fair fame. For himself he cared little; for the
  Protestant faith he cared everything. If the Papists obtained their suit,
  they would wrest from his grasp documents most compromising to themselves.
  They would leave no stone unturned to secure them&mdash;they <i>dare
  not</i>leave them in the hands of a Protestant pastor. Their story of the
  "Acts of the Council of Jerusalem" was false. They said that it had been
  obtained by Olier de Nanteuil, Ambassador of France at Constantinople, in
  1672, and had been transmitted to Paris, where Arnauld had seen and made use
  of it in preparing his great work on the "Perpetuity of the Faith." They
  further said that the Bibliothèque du Roi had obtained it in 1696. On the
  other hand, Aymon asserted that Arnauld had falsified the text in his
  treatise on the "Perpetuity of the Faith," and that, not daring to let his
  fraud appear, he had never given the MS. to the Royal Library, but had
  committed it to a Benedictine monk of S. Maur, who had assisted him in
  falsifying it and making an incorrect translation. This monk would never have
  surrendered the MS. but that conscience had given him no rest till he had
  transmitted it to one who would know how to use it aright. He, Aymon, had
  solemnly promised never to divulge the name of this monk, and even though he
  and the Protestant cause were to suffer for it, that promise should be held
  sacred. He challenged the library of the King to prove its claim to the
  "Council of Jerusalem!" All books in the Bibliothèque du Roi have the seal of
  the library on them. This volume had three seals&mdash;that of the Sultan,
  that of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, and that of Olier de Nanteuil; but he
  defied any one to see the library mark on its cover, or on any of its sheets.
  Aymon wound up his audacious pamphlet by prophesying that the Papists of
  France would not be satisfied with this claim, but would advance many others,
  for they knew that in his hands were documents of the utmost importance to
  them to conceal. Aymon was too clever for Clement: he had mixed up truth with
  fiction in such a way that the points which Clement had to admit tended to
  make even those who were not bigoted hesitate about condemning Aymon.</p>

  <p>Clement replied to this letter by stating the whole story of Aymon's
  deception of the Cardinal de Noailles and others. With regard to the "Council
  of Jerusalem," it was false that it had ever been in a Benedicient monastery.
  "It is true," he said, "that in the Monastery of S. Germain-des-Prés there
  are documents relating to the controversies between the Catholics and Greek
  schismatics, but they are all in French." He produced an attestation, signed
  by the prior, to the effect that the MS. in question had never been within
  the walls of his monastery. Clement was obliged to allow that a Benedictine
  monk had been employed by Arnauld to translate the text of the Council; he
  even found him out, his name was Michel Foucquère; he was still alive, and
  the librarian made him affirm in writing that he had restored the volume, on
  the completion of his translation, to Dom Luc d'Achery. Clement sent a copy
  of the register in the library, which related how and when the volume had
  come into the possession of the King. It was true that it bore no library
  seal, but that was through an oversight.</p>

  <p>Aymon wrote a second pamphlet, exposing Clement more completely, pointing
  out the concessions he was obliged to make, and finally, in indignant terms,
  hurling back on him the base assertion made to injure him in the eyes of an
  enlightened Protestant public, that he had ever treated with the government
  or clergy of Paris relative to a secession to the ranks of Popery. But that
  he had been to Paris; that he had met the Cardinal Archbishop, he admitted;
  but on what ground? He had met him and twenty-four prelates besides, gathered
  in solemn conclave, and had lifted up his voice in testimony against them;
  had disputed with them, and, with the Word of God in his mouth, had put them
  all to silence! No idea of his ever leaving the reformed faith had ever
  entered his head. No! he had been on a mission to the Papists of France, to
  open their eyes and to convert them.</p>

  <p>The news of the robbery had, however, reached the ears of the King, Louis
  XIV., and he instructed M. de Torcy to demand on the part of Government the
  restitution of the stolen MSS. M. de Torcy first wrote to a M. Hennequin at
  Rotterdam, who replied that Aymon had justified himself before the Council of
  State from the imputations cast upon him. He had been interrogated, not upon
  the theft committed in Paris, but on his journey to France. Aymon had proved
  that this expedition had been undertaken with excellent intentions, and had
  been attended with supreme success, since he had returned laden with
  manuscripts the publication of which would cause the greatest confusion in
  the Catholic camp. Hennequin added, that after having been deprived of his
  stipend, as suspected, on it having been ascertained that he had visited
  Paris instead of Constantinople, Aymon, having cleared his character, had
  recovered it. Such was the first result of the intervention of Louis XIV. in
  this affair.</p>

  <p>"The stamp of the Royal Library is on all the MSS., except the 'Council of
  Jerusalem,'" said Clement. "Let the judges insist on examining the books in
  the possession of Aymon, and all doubt as to the theft will be removed."</p>

  <p>But this the judges refused to do.</p>

  <p>It was pretended that Aymon was persecuted; it was the duty of the
  Netherland Government to protect a subject from persecution. He had made
  discovries, and the Catholics dreaded the publication of his discoveries,
  therefore a deep plot had been laid to ruin him.</p>

  <p>Aymon had now formed around him a powerful party, and the Calvinist
  preachers took his side unanimously. It was enough to read the titles of the
  books stolen to be certain that they contained curious details on the affairs
  which agitated Catholics and Protestants from the sixteenth century.</p>

  <p>All that the Dutch authorities cared for now was to find some excuse for
  retaining these important papers, and the inquiry was mainly directed to the
  proceedings of Aymon in France. If, as it was said, he had gone thither to
  abjure Calvinism and betray his brethren, he deserved reprimand, but if, on
  the other hand, he had penetrated the camp of the enemy to defy it, and to
  witness a good confession in the heart of the foe, he deserved a crown.
  Clement, to display Aymon in his true colours, acting on the advice of the
  Minister, sent copies of Aymon's letters. It was not thought that the good
  faith of the French administration would be doubted. Aymon swore that the
  letters were not his own, but that they had been fabricated by the
  Government; and he offered to stake his head on the truth of what he said. At
  the same time he dared De Torcy to produce the originals.</p>

  <p>He had guessed aright: he knew exactly how far he could go. The Dutch
  court actually questioned the good faith of these copies, and demanded the
  originals. This, as Aymon had expected, was taken by De Torcy as an insult,
  and all further communication on the subject was abruptly stopped. It was a
  clever move of Aymon. He inverted by one bold stroke the relative positions
  of himself and his accuser: the judges at the Hague required M. de Torcy to
  re-establish his own honour before proceeding with the question of Aymon's
  culpability. In short, they supposed that one of the Ministers of the Crown,
  for the sake of ruining a Protestant refugee, had deliberately committed
  forgery.</p>

  <p>The matter was dropped. After a while Aymon published translations of some
  of the MSS. in his possession, and those who had expected great results were
  disappointed. In the meantime poor Clement died, heart-broken at the losses
  of the library committed to his care.</p>

  <p>At last the Dutch Government, after the publication of Aymon's book, and
  after renewed negotiation, restored the "Council of Jerusalem" to the
  Bibliothèque du Roi. It still bears traces of the mutilations and additions
  of Aymon.</p>

  <p>In 1710, the imposter published the letters of Prospero S. Croce, which he
  said he had copied in the Vatican, but which he had in fact stolen from the
  Royal Library. In 1716 he published other stolen papers. Clement was
  succeeded by the Abbé de Targny, who made vain attempts to recover the lost
  treasures. The Abbé Bignon succeeded De Targny, and he discovered fresh
  losses. Aymon had stolen Arabic books as well as Greek and Italian MSS. There
  was no chance of recovering the lost works through the courts of law, and
  Bignon contented himself with writing to Holland, England, and Germany to
  inquire whether any of the MSS. had been bought there.</p>

  <p>The Baron von Stocks wrote to say that he had purchased some leaves of the
  Epistles of S. Paul, some pages of the S. Denis Bible, and an Arabic volume
  from Aymon for a hundred florins, and that he would return them to the
  library for that sum. They were recovered in March, 1720.</p>

  <p>About the same time Mr. Bentley, librarian to the King of England,
  announced that some more of the pages from the Epistles of S. Paul were in
  Lord Harley's library; and that the Duke of Sunderland had purchased various
  MSS. at the Hague from Aymon. In giving this information to the Abbé Bignon,
  Mr. Bentley entreated him not to mention the source of his information. M. de
  Bozé thereupon resolved to visit England and endeavour to recover the MSS.
  But he was detained by various causes.</p>

  <p>In 1729, Earl Middleton offered, on the part of Lord Harley, to return the
  thirty-four leaves of the Epistles in his possession, asking only in return
  an acknowledgment sealed with the grand seal. Cardinal Fleury, finding that
  the Royal signature could hardly be employed for such a purpose, wrote in the
  King's name a letter to the Earl of Oxford of a flattering nature, and the
  lost MSS. were restored in September, 1729.</p>

  <p>Those in the Sunderland collection have not, I believe, been returned.</p>

  <p>And what became of Aymon? In 1718 he inhabited the Chateau of Riswyck.
  Thence he sent to the brothers Wetstein, publishers at Amsterdam, the proofs
  of his edition of the letters of Visconti. It appeared in 1719 in two 12mo
  volumes, under the title "Lettres, Anecdotes, et Mémoires historiques du
  nonce Visconti, Cardinel Préconisé et Ministre Secret de Pie IV. et de ses
  créatures." The date of his death is not known.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE PATARINES OF MILAN</h2>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">IN the eleventh century, nearly all the clergy in the north
  of Italy were married.[7] It was the same in Sicily, and it had been the same
  in Rome,[8] but there the authority and presence of the Popes had sufficed to
  convert open marriage into secret concubinage.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[7] "Cuncti fere cum publicis uxoribus ... ducebant
  vitam." "Et ipsi, ut cernitur, sicut laici, palam uxores
  ducunt."&mdash;<i>Andr. Strum. "Vit. Arialdi."</i> "Quis clericorum non esset
  uxoratus vel concubinarius?"&mdash;<i>Andr. Strum. "Vit. S. Joan.
  Gualberti."</i></p>

  <p class="footnote">[8] "Coeperunt ipsi presbyteri et diacones laicorum more
  uxores ducere suscepsosque filios hæredes relinquere. Nonnulli etiam
  episcoporum verecund â omni contemptâ, cum uxoribus domo simul in unâ
  habitare."&mdash;<i>Victor Papa "in Dialog."</i></p>

  <p>But concubinage did not in those times mean exactly what it means now. A
  <i>concubina</i> was an <i>uxor</i> in an inferior degree; the woman was
  married in both cases with the ring and religious rite, but the children of
  the concubine could not inherit legally the possessions of their father. When
  priests were without wives, concubines were tolerated wives without the legal
  status of wives, lest on the death of the priest his children should claim
  and alienate to their own use property belonging to the Church. In noble and
  royal families it was sometimes the same, lest estates should be dismembered.
  On the death of a wife, her place was occupied by a concubine, and the sons
  of the latter could not dispute inheritance with the sons of the former. Nor
  did the Church look sternly on the concubine. In the first Toledian Council a
  canon was passed with regard to communicating those who had one wife or one
  concubine;&mdash;such were not to be excluded from the Lord's Table,[9] so
  long only as each man had but one wife or concubine, and the union was
  perpetual.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[9] "Qui unius mulieris, aut uxoris, aut concubinæ (ut ei
  placuerit) sit conjunctione contentus."&mdash;1st Conc. of Toledo, can. 17.
  "Hæ quippe, licet nec uxoribus, nec Reginarum decore et privilegiis
  gaudebant, erant tamen veræ uxores," say the Bollandist Fathers, and add,
  that it is a vulgar error "Concubinæ appellationem solis iis tribuere, quæ
  corporis sui usum uni viro commodant, nullo interim legitimo nexu
  devinctæ."&mdash;Acta SS., Jun. T. L. p. 178.</p>

  <p>But, though concubinage was universal among the clergy in Italy, at Milan
  the priests openly, boldly claimed for their wives a position as honourable
  as could be accorded them; and they asserted without fear of contradiction
  that their privilege had received the sanction of the great Ambrose himself.
  Married bishops had been common, and saintly married prelates not unknown.
  St. Severus of Ravenna had a wife and daughter, and though the late
  biographer asserts that he lived with his wife as with a sister after he
  became a bishop, this statement is probably made to get over an awkward
  fact.[10] When he was about to die, he went to the tomb where his wife and
  daughter lay, and had the stone removed. Then he addressed them
  thus&mdash;"My dear ones, with whom I lived so long in love, make room for
  me, for this is my grave, and in death we shall not be divided." Thereupon he
  descended into the grave, laid himself between his wife and daughter, and
  died. St. Heribert, Archbishop of Milan, had been a married man with a wife
  esteemed for her virtues.[11]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[10] It is the same with St. Gregory, Nyssen, Baronius,
  Alban, Butler, and other modern Hagiographers make this assertion boldly, but
  there is not a shadow of evidence, in any ancient authorities for his life,
  that this was the case.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[11] "Hic Archiepiscopus habuit uxorem nobilem mulierem;
  quæ donavit dotem suam monasterii S. Dionysii, quæ usque hodie Uxoria
  dicitur."&mdash;<i>Calvaneus Fiamma, sub ann. 1040.</i></p>

  <p>By all accounts, friendly and hostile, the Lombard priests were married
  openly, legally, with religious rite, exchange of ring, and notarial deed.
  There was no shame felt, no supposition entertained that such was an
  offence.[12]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[12] "Nec vos terreat," writes St. Peter Damiani to the
  wives of the clergy "quod forte, non dicam fidei, sed perfidiæ vos annulus
  subarrhavit; quod rata et monimenta dotalia notarius quasi matrimonii jure
  conscripserit: quod juramentum ad confirmandam quodammodo conjugii copulam
  utrinque processit. Ignorantes quia pro uniuscujusque fugaci voluptate
  concubitus mlle annorum negotiantur incendium."</p>

  <p>How was this inveterate custom to be broken through? How the open, honest
  marriage to be perverted into clandestine union? For to abolish it wholly was
  beyond the power of the Popes and Councils. It was in vain to appeal to the
  bishops, they sympathised with their clergy. It was in vain to invoke the
  secular arm; the emperors, the podestas, supported the parish-priests in
  their contumacious adherence to immemorial privilege.</p>

  <p>To carry through the reform on which they were bent, to utterly abolish
  the marriage of the clergy, the appeal must be made to the people.</p>

  <p>In Milan this was practicable, for the laity, at least the lower rabble,
  were deeply tinged with Patarinism, and bore a grudge against the clergy, who
  had been foremost in bringing the luckless heretics to the rack and the
  flames; and one of the most cherished doctrines of the Patarines was the
  unlawfulness of marriage. What if this anti-connubial prejudice could be
  enlisted by the strict reformers of the Church, and turned to expend its fury
  on the clergy who refused to listen to the expostulations of the Holy
  Father?</p>

  <p>The Patarines, whom the Popes were about to enlist in their cause against
  the Ambrosian clergy, already swarmed in Italy. Of their origin and tenets we
  must say a word.</p>

  <p>It is a curious fact that, instead of Paganism affecting Christianity in
  the earliest ages of the Church, it was Christianity which affected Paganism,
  and that not the Greek and Roman idolatry, which was rotten through and
  through, but the far subtler and more mystical heathenism of Syria, Egypt,
  Persia, and Mesopotamia. The numerous Gnostic sects, so called from their
  claim to be the possessors of the true <i>gnosis</i>, or knowledge of wisdom,
  were not, save in the rarest cases, of Christian origin. They were Pagan
  philosophical schools which had adopted and incorporated various Christian
  ideas. They worked up Biblical names and notions into the strange new creeds
  they devised, and, according as they blended more or less of Christian
  teaching with their own, they drew to themselves disciples of various
  tempers. Manes, who flourished in the middle of the third century, a
  temporary and nominal convert to the Gospel, blended some of these elder
  Gnostic systems with the Persian doctrines of Zoroaster, added to a somewhat
  larger element of Christianity than his predecessors had chosen to adopt. His
  doctrines spread and gained an extensive and lasting hold on the minds of
  men, suppressed repeatedly, but never disappearing wholly, adopting fresh
  names, emerging in new countries, exhibiting an irrepressible vitality, which
  confounded the Popes and Churchmen from the third to the tenth centuries.</p>

  <p>The tradition of Western Manicheism breaks off about the sixth century;
  but in the East, under the name of Paulicians, the adherents of Manichean
  doctrines endured savage persecutions during two whole centuries, and spread,
  as they fled from the sword and stake in the East, over Europe, entering it
  in two streams&mdash;one by Bulgaria, Servia, and Croatia, to break out in
  the wild fanaticism of the Taborites under Zisca of the Flail; the other, by
  way of the sea, inundating northern Italy and Provence. In Piedmont it
  obtained the name of Patarinism; in Provence, of Albigensianism.</p>

  <p>With Oriental Manicheism, the Patarines and Albigenses of the West held
  that there were two co-equal conflicting principles of good and evil; that
  matter was eternal, and waged everlasting war against spirit. Their moral
  life was strict and severe. They fasted, dressed in coarse clothing, and
  hardly, reluctantly suffered marriage to the weaker, inferior disciples. It
  was absolutely forbidden to those who were, or esteemed themselves to be,
  perfect.</p>

  <p>Already, in Milan, St Heribert, the married archbishop, had kindled fires,
  and cast these denouncers of wedlock into them. In 1031 the heretics held the
  castle of Montforte, in the diocese of Asti. They were questioned: they
  declared themselves ready to witness to their faith by their blood. They
  esteemed virginity, and lived in chastity with their wives, never touched
  meat, and prayed incessantly. They had their goods in common. Their castle
  stood a siege. It was at length captured by the Archbishop. In the
  market-place were raised a cross on one side, a blazing pyre on the other.
  The Patarines were brought forth, commanded to cast themselves before the
  cross, confess themselves to be heretics, or plunge into the flames. A few
  knelt to the cross; the greater number covered their faces, rushed into the
  fire, and were consumed.[13]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[13] Landulf Sen. ii. c. 27.</p>

  <p>St. Augustine, in his book on Heresies, had already described these
  heretics. He, who had been involved in the fascinating wiles of Manicheism,
  could not be ignorant of them. He calls them Paternians, or Venustians, and
  says that they regarded the flesh as the work of the devil&mdash;that is, of
  the evil principle, because made of matter.</p>

  <p>In the eleventh century, in Lombardy, they are called Patarines, Patrins,
  or Cathari. Muratori says that they derived their name from the part of the
  town of Milan in which they swarmed, near the Contrada di Patari; but it is
  more probable that the quarter was called after them.</p>

  <p>In 1074 Gregory VII. in solemn conclave will bless them altogether, by
  name, as the champions of the Holy See, and of the Truth; in 1179 Alexander
  III. will anathematise them altogether, as heretics meet to be burned.
  Frederick II., when seeking reconciliation with Honorius III. and Gregory
  IX., will be never weary of offering hecatombs of Patarines, in token of his
  orthodoxy.</p>

  <p>Ariald, a native of Cuzago, a village near Milan, of ignoble birth, in
  deacon's orders, was chosen for the dangerous expedient of enlisting the
  Patarine heretics against the orthodox but relaxed clergy of that city.
  Milan, said a proverb, was famous for its clergy; Ravenna for its churches.
  In morals, in learning, in exact observance of their religious duties, the
  clergy of Milan were prominent among the priests of Lombardy. But they were
  all married. The Popes could expect no support from the Archbishop, Guido
  Vavasour; none from the Emperor Henry IV., then a child. Ariald was a
  woman-hater from infancy, deeply tinged with Patarinism. We are told that
  even as a little boy the sight of his sisters was odious to him.[14] He began
  to preach in Milan in 1057, and the populace was at once set on fire[15] by
  his sermons. They applauded vociferously his declaration that the married
  clergy were no longer to be treated as priests, but as "the enemies of God,
  and the deceivers of souls."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[14] For authorities we have Andrew of Vallombrosa,
  <i>d.</i> A.D. 1170, a disciple of Ariald. He was a native of Parma. He
  afterwards went to Florence, where he was mixed up with the riots occasioned
  by St. John Gualberto in 1063. He joined the Order of Vallombrosa, and became
  Abbot of Strumi. At least, I judge, and so do the Bollandists, that Andrew of
  Vallombrosa and Andrew of Strumi are the same.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[15] "Plebs fere universa sic est accensa."</p>

  <p>Then up rose from among the mob a clerk named Landulf, a man of loud voice
  and vehement gesture, and offered to join Ariald in his crusade. The crowd,
  or, at least, a part of it, enthusiastically cheered; another part of the
  audience, disapproving, deeming it an explosion of long-suppressed
  Manicheism, which would meet with stern repression, thought it prudent to
  withdraw.</p>

  <p>A layman of fortune, named Nazarius, offered his substance to advance the
  cause, and his house as a harbour for its apostles.</p>

  <p>The sermon was followed by a tumult. The whole city was in an uproar, and
  the married clergy were threatened or maltreated by the mob. Guido Vavasour
  de Velati, the Archbishop, was obliged to interfere. He summoned Ariald and
  Landulf before him, and remonstrated. "It is unseemly for a priest to
  denounce priests. It is impolitic for him to stir up tumult against his
  brethren. Let not brothers condemn brothers, for whose salvation Christ
  died." Then turning to Landulf, "Why do not you return to your own wife and
  children whom you have deserted, and live with them as heretofore, and set an
  example of peace and order? Cast the beam out of thine own eye, before thou
  pluckest motes out of the eyes of thy brethren. If they have done wrong,
  reprove them privately, but do not storm against them before all the people."
  He concluded by affirming the lawfulness of priests marrying, and insisted on
  the cessation of the contest.[16] Ariald obstinately refused to desist.
  "Private expostulation is in vain. As for obstinate disorders you apply fire
  and steel, so for this abuse we must have recourse to desperate
  remedies."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[16] "Hæc cum Guido placide dixisset; eo finem orationis
  dixerit, ut sacerdotibus fas esset dicere uxores ducere."&mdash;<i>Alicatus,
  "Vit. Arialdi."</i></p>

  <p>He left the Archbishop to renew his appeals to the people. But dreading
  lest Guido should use force to restrain him, Ariald invoked the support of
  Anselm de Badagio, Bishop of Lucca, and received promise of his countenance
  and advocacy at Rome.</p>

  <p>Guido Vavasour had succeeded the married Archbishop Heribert in 1040. His
  election had not satisfied the people, who had chosen, and proposed for
  consecration, four priests, one of whom the nobles were expected to select.
  But the nobles rejected the popular candidates, and set up in their place
  Guido Vavasour, and his nomination was ratified by the Emperor and by the
  Pope. He was afterwards, as we shall see, charged with having bribed Henry
  III. to give him the See, but was acquitted of the charge, which was
  denounced as unfounded by Leo IX. in 1059. The people, in token of their
  resentment, refused to be present at the first mass he sang. "He is a country
  bumpkin," said they. "Faugh! he smells of the cow-house."[17] Consequently
  there was simmering discontent against the Archbishop for Ariald to work
  upon; he could unite the lower people, whose wishes had been disregarded by
  the nobles, with the Patarines, who had been haled before ecclesiastical
  courts for their heresy, in one common insurrection against the clergy and
  the pontiff.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[17] Arnulf., Gesta Archiepisc. Mediol. ap. Pertz, x. p.
  17.</p>

  <p>According to Landulf the elder, a strong partisan of the Archbishop,
  another element of discontent was united to those above enumerated. The
  clergy of Milan had oppressed the country people. The Church had estates
  outside of Milan, vine and olive yards and corn-fields. The clergy had been
  harsh in exacting feudal rights and legal dues.</p>

  <p>Ariald, as a native of a country village, knew the temper of the peasants,
  and their readiness to resent these extortions. Ariald worked upon the
  country-folk; Landulf, rich and noble, and eloquent in speech, on the town
  rabble; and the two mobs united against the common enemy.</p>

  <p>Anselm de Badagio, priest and popular preacher at Milan, had been mixed up
  with Landulf and Ariald in the controversy relative to clerical marriage; but
  to stop his mouth the Archbishop had given him the bishopric of Lucca, in
  1057, and had supplied his place as preacher at Milan by seven deacons.
  Landulf the elder relates that these deacons preached with such success that
  Anselm, in a fit of jealousy, returned to Milan to listen to their sermons,
  and scornfully exclaimed, "They may become preachers, but they must first put
  away their wives."</p>

  <p>According to the same authority, Ariald bore a grudge against the
  Archbishop for having had occasion to rebuke him on account of some
  irregularity of which he had been guilty. But Landulf the elder is not to be
  trusted implicitly; he is as bigoted on one side as is Andrew of Strumi on
  the other.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the priests and their wives were exposed to every sort of
  violence, and "a great horror fell on the Ambrosian clergy." The poor women
  were torn from their husbands, and driven from the city; the priests who
  refused to be separated from their companions were interdicted from the
  altar.[18]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[18] "Sic ab eodem populo sunt persecuta et deleta
  (clericorum connubia) ut nullus existeret quin aut cogeretur tantum nefas
  dimittere, vel ad altare non accedere."&mdash;<i>Andr. Strum.</i></p>

  <p>Landulf was sent to Rome to report progress, and obtain confirmation of
  the proceedings of the party from the Pope. He reached Piacenza, but was
  unable to proceed farther; he was knocked down, and finding the way barred by
  the enemies of his party, returned to Milan. Ariald then started, and eluding
  his adversaries, arrived safely at Rome. He presented himself before Pope
  Stephen X., who was under the influence of Hildebrand, and, therefore,
  disposed to receive him with favour. Stephen bade him return to Milan,
  prosecute the holy war, and, if need be, shed his blood in the sacred
  cause.</p>

  <p>The appeal to Rome was necessary, as the Archbishop and a large party of
  the citizens, together with all the clergy, had denounced Ariald and Landulf
  as Patarines. The fact was notorious that the secret and suspected Manichees
  in Milan were now holding up their heads and defying those who had hitherto
  controlled them. The Manichees suddenly found that from proscribed heretics
  they had been exalted into champions of orthodoxy. It was a satisfactory
  change for those who had been persecuted to become persecutors, and turn
  their former tyrants into victims. But now, to the confusion and dismay of
  the clergy, they found themselves betrayed by the Pope, and at the mercy of
  those who had old wrongs to resent. Fortified with the blessing of the Pope
  on his work, his orthodoxy triumphantly established by the supreme authority,
  Ariald rushed back to Milan, accompanied by papal legates to protect him, and
  proclaim his mission as divine. He was unmeasured in his denunciations.
  Dissension fast ripened into civil war. Ariald, at the head of a roaring mob,
  swept the clergy together into a church, and producing a paper which bound
  all of them by oath to put away their wives, endeavoured to enforce their
  subscription.</p>

  <p>A priest, maddened to resentment, struck the demagogue in the mouth. This
  was the signal for a general tumult. The adherents of Ariald rushed through
  the streets, the alarm bells pealed, the populace gathered from all quarters,
  and a general hunting down of the married clergy ensued.</p>

  <p>"How can the blind lead the blind?" preached Landulf Cotta. "Let these
  Simoniacs, these Nicolaitans be despised. You who wish to have salvation from
  the Lord, drive them from their functions; esteem their sacrifices as dogs'
  dung (<i>canina stercora</i>)! Confiscate their goods, and every one of you
  take what he likes![19] We can imagine the results of such license given to
  the lowest rabble. The nobles, over-awed, dared not interfere.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[19] Arnulf., <i>Gesta Ep. Mediol.</i> ap. Pertz, x. p.
  18. It is necessary not to confound Landulf Cotta, the demagogue, with
  Landulf the elder, the historian, and Landulf the younger, the disciple and
  biographer of Ariald.</p>

  <p>Nor were the clergy of the city alone exposed to this popular persecution.
  The preachers roved round the country, creating riots everywhere. This led to
  retaliation, but retaliation of a feeble, harmless sort. A chapel built by
  Ariald on his paternal estate was pulled down; and the married clergy
  resentfully talked of barking his chestnut trees and breaking down his vines,
  but thought better of it, and refrained.</p>

  <p>A more serious attempt at revenge was the act of a private individual.
  Landulf Cotta was praying in a church, when a priest aimed at him with a
  sword, but without seriously hurting him. A cripple at the church door caught
  the flying would-be assassin; a crowd assembled, and Landulf with difficulty
  extricated the priest alive from their hands.</p>

  <p>Ariald and Cotta now began to denounce those who had bought their cures of
  souls, or had paid fees on their institution to them. They stimulated the
  people to put down simony, as they had put down concubinage. "Cursed is he
  that withholdeth his hand from blood!" was the fiery peroration of a sermon
  on this subject by Ariald.</p>

  <p>"Landulf Cotta," says Arnulf, "being master of the lay folk, made them
  swear to combat both simony and concubinage. Presently he forced this oath on
  the clergy. From this time forward he was constantly followed by a crowd of
  men and women, who watched around him night and day. He despised the
  churches, and rejected priests as well as their functions, under pretext that
  they were defiled with simony. They were called Patari, that is to say,
  beggars, because the greater part of them belonged to the lowest
  orders."[20]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[20] Ap. Pertz, l.c., pp. 19, 20.</p>

  <p>"What shall we do?" asked a large party at Milan. "This Ariald tells us
  that if we receive the Holy Sacrament from married or simoniacal priests, we
  eat our own damnation. We cannot live without sacraments, and he has driven
  all the priests out of Milan."</p>

  <p>The parties were so divided, that those who held with Ariald would not
  receive sacraments from the priests, the heavenly gift on their altars they
  esteemed as "dogs' dung;" they would not even join with them, or those who
  adhered to them, in prayer. "One house was all faithful," says Andrew of
  Strumi; "the next all unfaithful. In the third, the mother and one son were
  believing, but the father and the other son were unbelieving; so that the
  whole city was a scene of confusion and contention."</p>

  <p>In 1058 Guido assembled a synod at Fontanetum near Novara, and summoned
  Ariald and Landulf Cotta to attend it. The synod awaited their arrival for
  three days, and as they did not come, excommunicated them as
  contumacious.</p>

  <p>Landulf the younger, the biographer of Ariald, says that Pope Stephen X.
  reversed the sentence of the synod; but this account does not agree with what
  is related by Arnulf. Landulf the elder confounds the dates, and places the
  synod in the reign of Alexander II., and says that the Pope adopted a middle
  course, and sent ambassadors to Milan to investigate the matter. Bonizo of
  Sutri says the same. All agree that Hildebrand was one of these
  commissioners. Hildebrand was therefore able to judge on the spot of the
  results of an appeal to the passions of the people. It is the severest
  condemnation to his conduct in 1073, to know for certain that he had seen the
  working of the power he afterwards called out. He then saw how great was that
  power; he must have been cruelly, recklessly, wickedly indifferent to the
  crimes which accompanied its invocation. Landulf the elder says that the
  second commissary was Anselm of Lucca, whilst Bonizo speaks indifferently of
  the "bishops <i>a latere</i>" as constituting the deputation. Guido was not
  in Milan when it arrived, he did not dare to venture his person in the midst
  of the people. The ambassadors were received with the utmost respect; they
  took on themselves to brand the Archbishop as a simoniac and a schismatic,
  and, according to Landulf, to do many other things which they were not
  authorised by the Pope to do; so that the dissension, so far from being
  allayed by their visit, only waxed more furious.</p>

  <p>At the end of the year 1058, or the beginning of 1059, the Pope sent Peter
  Damiani, the harsh Bishop of Ostia, and Anselm, Bishop of Lucca, on a new
  embassy to Milan.[21] They were received with respect by the Archbishop and
  clergy; but the pride of the Milanese of all ranks was wounded by seeing the
  Bishop of Ostia enthroned in the middle, with Anselm of Lucca, the suffragan
  of Milan, upon his right, and their Archbishop degraded to the left of the
  Legate, and seated on a stool at his feet. Milan assembled at the ringing of
  the bells in all the churches, and the summons of an enormous brazen trumpet
  which shrieked through the streets. The fickle people asked if the Church of
  St. Ambrose was to be trodden under the foot of the Roman Pontiff. "I was
  threatened with death," wrote Peter Damiani to Hildebrand, "and many assured
  me that there were persons panting for my blood. It is not necessary for me
  to repeat all the remarks the people made on this occasion."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[21] We have a full account of this embassy in a letter
  of St. Peter Damiani to the Archdeacon Hildebrand (Petri Dam. <i>Opp.</i>
  iii; <i>Opusc.</i> v. p. 37), besides the accounts by Bonizo, Arnulf, and
  Landulf the elder.</p>

  <p>But Peter Damiani was not the man to be daunted at a popular outbreak. He
  placidly mounted the ambone, and asserted boldly the supreme jurisdiction of
  the chair of St. Peter. "The Roman Church is the mother, that of Ambrose is
  the daughter. St. Ambrose always recognised that mistress. Study the sacred
  books, and hold us as liars, if you do not find that it is as I have
  said."</p>

  <p>Then the charges against the clergy were investigated by the legates, and
  not a single clerk in Milan was found who had not paid a fee on his
  ordination; "for that was the custom, and the charge was fixed," says the
  Bishop of Ostia. Here was a difficulty. He could not deprive every priest and
  deacon in Milan, and leave the great city without pastors. He was therefore
  obliged to content his zeal with exacting from the bishops a promise that
  ordination in future should be made gratuitously; and the Archbishop was
  constrained to deposit on the altar a paper in which he pronounced his own
  excommunication, in the event of his relaxing his rigour in suppressing the
  heresy of the Simoniacs and Nicolaitans, by which latter name those who
  insisted on the lawfulness of clerical marriage were described.</p>

  <p>To make atonement for the past, the Archbishop was required to do penance
  for one hundred years, but to pay money into the papal treasury in acquittal
  of each year; which, to our simple understanding, looks almost as scandalous
  a traffic as imposing a fee on all clergy ordained. But then, in the one case
  the money went into the pocket of the bishops, and in the other into that of
  the Pope.</p>

  <p>The clergy who had paid a certain sum were to be put to penance for five
  years; those who had paid more, for ten (also to be compensated by a payment
  to Rome!), and to make pilgrimages to Rome or Tours. After having
  accomplished this penance they were to receive again the insignia of their
  offices.</p>

  <p>Then Peter Damiani re-imposed on the clergy the oaths forced on them by
  Ariald, and departed.</p>

  <p>The Milanese contemporary historian, Arnulf, exclaims, "Who has bewitched
  you, ye foolish Milanese? Yesterday you made loud outcries for the priority
  of a see, and now you trouble the whole organisation of the Church. You are
  gnats swallowing camels. You say, perhaps, Rome must be honoured because of
  the Apostle. Well, but the memory of St. Ambrose should deliver Milan from
  such an affront as has been inflicted on her. In future it will be said that
  Milan is subject to Rome."[22]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[22] Pertz, x. p. 21.</p>

  <p>Guido attended a council held in Rome (April 1059), shortly after this
  visitation. Ariald also was present, to accuse the Archbishop of favouring
  simony and concubinage. The legates had dealt too leniently with the scandal.
  Guido was defended by his suffragans of Asti, Novara, Turin, Vercelli, Alba,
  Lodi, and Brescia. "Mad bulls, they," says Bonizo; and Ariald was forced to
  retire, covered with confusion. The Council pronounced a decree that no mercy
  should be shown to the simoniacal and married clergy.[23] An encyclical was
  addressed by Nicholas II. to all Christendom, informing it that the Council
  had passed thirteen canons, one of which prevented a layman from assisting at
  a mass said by a priest who had a concubine or a <i>subintroducta mulier</i>.
  Priests, deacons, and sub-deacons who should take "publicly" a concubine, or
  not send away those with whom they lived, were to be inhibited from
  exercising all ministerial acts and receiving ecclesiastical dues.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[23] "Nulla misericordia habenda est."</p>

  <p>On the return of the bishops to their sees, one only of them, Adelmann of
  Brescia, ventured to publish these decrees. He was nearly torn to pieces by
  his clergy; an act of violence which greatly furthered the cause of the
  Patarines.[24]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[24] Bonizo. It is deserving of remark that Bonizo, an
  ardent supporter of Hildebrand and the reforming party, calls that Papal
  party by the name of <i>Patari</i>, thus showing that it was really made up
  of the Manichean heretics.</p>

  <p>In the same year Pope Nicholas sent legates into different countries to
  execute, or attempt to execute, the decrees passed against simony and
  concubinage&mdash;as clerical marriage was called. Peter Damiani travelled
  through several cities of Italy to exhort the clergy to celibacy, and
  especially to press this matter on the bishops. Peter Damiani was not
  satisfied with the conduct of the Pope in assuming a stern attitude towards
  the priests, but overlooking the fact that the bishops were themselves guilty
  of the same offence. A letter from him to the Pope exists, in which he
  exhorts him to be a second Phinehas (Numb. xxv. 7), and deal severely with
  the bishops, without which no real reform could be affected.[25]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[25] <i>Opp.</i> t. iii.; <i>Opusc.</i> xiii. p. 188.</p>

  <p>Anselm de Badagio, Bishop of Lucca, the instigator of Landulf and Ariald,
  or at least their staunch supporter, was summoned on the death of Nicholas to
  occupy the throne of St. Peter, under the title of Alexander II. But his
  election was contested, and Cadalus, an anti-Pope, was chosen by a Council of
  German and Lombard prelates assembled at Basle. The contests which ensued
  between the rival Pontiffs and their adherents distracted attention from the
  question of clerical marriage, and the clergy recalled their wives.</p>

  <p>In 1063, in Florence, similar troubles occurred. The instigator of these
  was St. John Gualberto, founder of the Vallombrosian Order. The offence there
  was rather simony than concubinage.</p>

  <p>The custom of giving fees to those who appointed to benefices had become
  inveterate, and in many cases had degenerated into the purchase of them. A
  Pope could not assume the tiara without a lavish largess to the Roman
  populace. A bishop could not grasp his pastoral staff without paying heavy
  sums to the Emperor and to the Pope. The former payment was denounced as
  simony, the latter was exacted as an obligation. But under some of the
  Emperors the bishoprics were sold to the highest bidder. What was customary
  on promotion to a bishopric became customary on acceptance of lesser
  benefices, and no priest could assume a spiritual charge without paying a
  bounty to the episcopal treasury. When a bishop had bought his throne, he was
  rarely indisposed to sell the benefices in his gift, and to recoup a
  scandalous outlay by an equally scandalous traffic. The Bishop of Florence
  was thought by St. John Gualberto to have bought the see. He was a Pavian,
  Peter Mediabardi. His father came to Florence to visit his son. The
  Florentines took advantage of the unguarded simplicity of the old man to
  extract the desired secret from him.[26]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[26] "Cui Florentini clam insidiantes tentando dicere
  coeperunt," &amp;c.... "ille utpote simplicissimus homo coepit jurejurando
  dicere," &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Andrew of Genoa</i>, c. 62.</p>

  <p>"Master Teulo," said they, "had you a large sum to pay to the King for
  your son's elevation?"</p>

  <p>"By the body of St. Syrus," answered the father, "you cannot get a
  millstone out of the King's house without paying for it."</p>

  <p>"Then what did you pay?" asked the Florentines greedily.[27]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[27] "Alacres et avidi rem scisitari."</p>

  <p>"By the body of St. Syrus!" replied the old man, "not less than three
  thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>No sooner was the unguarded avowal made, than it was spread through the
  city by the enemies of the bishop.[28]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[28] For the account of what follows, in addition to the
  biography by Andrew of Strumi, we have the <i>Dialogues</i> of Desiderius of
  Monte Cassino, lib. iii.</p>

  <p>St. John Gualberto took up the quarrel. He appeared in Florence, where he
  had a monastery dedicated to St. Salvius, and began vehemently to denounce
  the prelate as a simoniac, and therefore a heretic. His monks, fired by his
  zeal, spread through the city, and exhorted the people to refuse to accept
  the sacramental acts of their bishop and resist his authority.</p>

  <p>The people broke out into tumult. The bishop appealed to the secular arm
  to arrest the disorder, and officers were sent to coerce the monks of St.
  Salvius. They broke into the monastery at night, sought Gualberto, but,
  unable to find him, maltreated the monks. One received a blow on his forehead
  which laid bare the bone, and another had his nose and lips gashed with a
  sword. The monks were stripped, and the monastery fired. The abbot rolled
  himself in an old cloak extracted from under a bed, where it had been cast as
  ragged, and awaited day, when the wounds and tears of the fraternity might be
  exhibited to a sympathising and excitable people. Nor were they disappointed.
  At daybreak all the town was gathered around the dilapidated monastery, and
  people were eagerly mopping up the sacred blood that had been shed, with
  their napkins, thinking that they secured valuable relics. Sympathy with the
  injured was fanned into frenzied abhorrence of the persecutor.</p>

  <p>St. John Gualberto appeared on the scene, blazing with the desire of
  martyrdom,[29] and congratulated the sufferers on having become confessors of
  Christ. "Now are ye true monks! But why did ye suffer without me?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[29] "Martyrii flagrans amore."&mdash;<i>Andr.
  Strum.</i></p>

  <p>The secular clergy of Florence were, it is asserted, deeply tainted with
  the same vice as their bishop. They had all paid fees at their institution,
  or had bought their benefices. They lived in private houses, and were for the
  most part married. Some were even suspected to be of immoral life.[30]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[30] "Quis clericorum propriis et paternis rebus
  solummodo non studebat? Qui potius inveniretur, proh dolor! qui non esset
  uxoratus vel concubinarius? De simoniâ quid dicam? Omnes pene ecclesiasticos
  ordines hæc mortifera bellua devoraverat, ut, qui ejus morsum evaserit, rarus
  inveniretur."&mdash;<i>Andr. Strum.</i></p>

  <p>But the preaching of the Saint, the wounds of the monks, converted some of
  the clergy. Those who were convinced by their appeals, and those who were
  wearied of their wives, threw themselves into the party of Gualberto, and
  clubbed together in common life.[31]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[31] "Exemplo vero ipsius et admonitionibus delicati
  clerici, spretis connubiis, coeperunt simul in ecclesiis stare, et communem
  ducere vitam."&mdash;Atto Pistor., <i>Vit. S. Joan. Gualb.</i></p>

  <p>The Vallombrosian monks appealed to Pope Alexander II. against the
  bishop,[32] their thirst for martyrdom whetted not quenched.[33] If the Pope
  desired it, they would try the ordeal of fire to prove their charge.
  Hildebrand, then only sub-deacon, but a power in the councils of the Pope,
  urged on their case, and demanded the deposition of the bishop. But
  Alexander, himself among the most resolute opponents of simony, felt that
  there was no case. There was no evidence, save the prattle of an old man over
  his wine-cups. He refused the petition of the monks, and was supported by the
  vast majority of the bishops&mdash;there were over a hundred present.[34]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[32] For what follows, in addition to the above-quoted
  authorities, we have Berthold's <i>Chronicle</i> from 1054 to 1100; Pertz,
  <i>Mon. Sacr.</i> v. pp. 264-326.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[33] "Securiores de corona, quam jam gustaverant,

  <p class="footnote">[34] "Favebat enim maxima pars Episcoporum parti Petri,
  et omnes pene erant monachis adversi."&mdash;<i>Andr. Strum.</i></p>

  <p>Even St. Peter Damiani, generally unmeasured in his invectives against
  simony, wrote to moderate the frantic zeal of the Vallombrosian monks, which
  he denounced as unreasonable, intemperate, unjust.</p>

  <p>But the refusal of the Pope to gratify their resentment did not quell the
  vehemence of the monks and the faction adverse to the bishop. The city was in
  a condition of chronic insubordination and occasional rioting. Godfrey Duke
  of Tuscany was obliged to interfere; and the monks were driven from their
  monastery of St. Salvi, and compelled to retire to that of St. Settimo
  outside of the gates.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, Pope Alexander visited Florence. The monks piled up a
  couple of bonfires, and offered to pass between them in proof of the truth of
  their allegation. He refused to permit the ordeal, and withdrew, leaving the
  bishop unconvicted, and therefore unrebuked.</p>

  <p>The clergy of Florence now determined to demand of the bishop that he
  should either go through the ordeal himself, or suffer the monks to do so. As
  they went to the palace, the people hooted them: "Go, ye heretics, to a
  heretic! You who have driven Christ out of the city! You who adore Simon
  Magus as your God!"</p>

  <p>The bishop sullenly refused; he would neither establish his innocence in
  the fire, nor suffer the monks to convict him by the ordeal.</p>

  <p>The Podesta of Florence then, with a high hand, drove from the town the
  clergy who had joined the monastic faction. They went forth on the first
  Saturday in Lent, 1067, amidst a sympathising crowd, composed mostly of
  women,[35] who tore off their veils, and with hair scattered wildly over
  their faces, threw themselves down in the road before the confessors, crying,
  "Alas! alas! O Christ, Thou art expelled this city, and how dost Thou leave
  us desolate? Thou art not tolerated here, and how can we live without Thee?
  Thou canst not dwell with Simon Magus. O holy Peter, didst thou once overcome
  Simon? and now dost thou permit him to have the mastery? We deemed him bound
  and writhing in infernal flames, and lo! he is loose, and risen again to thy
  dishonour."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[35] "Maxime feminarum."</p>

  <p>And the men said to one another, "Let us set fire to this accursed city,
  which hates Christ."[36]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[36] "Et nos, viri fratres, civitatem hanc incendamus
  atque cum parvulis et uxoribus nostris, quocumque Christus ierit, secum
  camus. Si Christiani sumus, Christum sequamur."&mdash;<i>Andr. Strum.</i></p>

  <p>The secular clergy were in dismay; denounced, deserted, threatened by the
  people, they sang no psalms, offered no masses. Unable to endure their
  position, they again visited the bishop, and entreated him to sanction the
  ordeal of fire. He refused, and requested the priests not to countenance such
  an unauthorised venture, should it be made. But the whole town was bent on
  seeing this ordeal tried, and on the Wednesday following, the populace poured
  to the monastery of St. Settimo. Two piles of sticks were heaped near the
  monastery gate, measuring ten feet long by five wide, and four and a half
  feet high. Between them lay a path the length of an arm in width.</p>

  <p>Litanies were chanted whilst the piles were reared, and then the monks
  proceeded to elect one who was to undergo the fire. The lot fell on a priest
  named Peter, and St. John Gualberto ordered him at once to the altar to say
  mass. All assisted with great devotion, the people crying with excitement. At
  the <i>Agnus Dei</i> four monks, one with the crucifix, another with holy
  water, the third with twelve lighted tapers, the fourth with a full censer,
  proceeded to the pyres, and set them both on fire.</p>

  <p>This threw the people into an ecstasy of excitement, and the voice of the
  priest was drowned in the clamour of their tongues. The priest finished mass,
  and laid aside his chasuble. Holding the cross, in alb and stole and maniple,
  he came forth, followed by St. John Gualberto and the monks, chanting.
  Suddenly a silence fell on the tossing concourse, and a monk appointed by the
  abbot stood forth, and in a clear voice said to the people, "Men, brethren,
  and sisters! we do this for the salvation of your souls, that henceforth ye
  may learn to avoid the leprosy of simony, which has infected nearly the whole
  world; for the crime of simony is so great, that beside it every other crime
  is as nothing."</p>

  <p>The two piles were burning vigorously. The priest Peter prayed, "Lord
  Christ, I beseech Thee, if Peter of Pavia, called Bishop of Florence, has
  obtained the episcopal throne by money, do Thou assist me in this terrible
  ordeal, and deliver me from being burned, as of old Thou didst deliver the
  three children in the midst of the burning furnace." Then, giving the
  brethren the kiss of peace, he stepped fearlessly between the burning pyres,
  and came forth on the farther side uninjured.</p>

  <p>His linen alb, his silken stole and maniple, were unburnt. He would have
  again rushed through the flames in the excess of his confidence, but was
  prevented by the pious vehemence of the people, who surrounded him, kissed
  his feet, clung to his vestments, and would have crushed him to death in
  their eagerness to touch and see him, had he not been rescued by the strong
  arms of burly monks.</p>

  <p>In after years he told, and talked himself into believing, that as he
  passed through the fire, his maniple fell off. Discovering his loss ere he
  emerged, he turned back, and deliberately picked it up. But of this nothing
  was said at the time.[37]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[37] It is not mentioned in the epistle of the
  Florentines to the Pope, narrating the ordeal and supposed miracle, which is
  given by Andrew of Strumi and Atto of Pistoja.</p>

  <p>A letter was then drawn up, appealing to the Pope in the most vehement
  terms, to deliver the sheep of the Florentine flock from the ravening wolf
  who shepherded them, and urging him, not obscurely, to use force if need be,
  and compel by his troops the evacuation of the Florentine episcopal throne.
  Peter of Pavia, the bishop, a man of gentle character, yielded to the storm.
  He withdrew from Florence, and was succeeded by another Peter, whom the
  people called Peter the Catholic, to distinguish him from the Simoniac. But
  Muratori adduces evidence that the former continued to be recognised by the
  Pope some time after his supposed degradation. Thus ended the schism of
  Florence in the entire triumph of the Patarines. Hildebrand was not
  unobservant; he proved afterwards not to be forgetful of the lesson taught by
  this schism,&mdash;the utilization of the rude mob as a powerful engine in
  the hands of the fanatical or designing. It bore its fruit in the canons of
  1074.</p>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">ANSELMO DE BADAGIO, Bishop of Lucca, had succeeded Nicholas
  II. to the Papal throne in 1061. Cadalus of Parma had been chosen by the
  German and Lombard prelates on October 28th, and he assumed the name of
  Honorius II. But no Roman Cardinal was present to sanction this election.
  Cadalus was acknowledged by all the simoniacal and married clergy, when he
  entered Italy; but the Princess Beatrice and the Duke of Tuscany prevented
  him from advancing to Rome. From Parma Cadalus excommunicated Alexander, and
  from Rome, Alexander banned Honorius. The cause of Alexander was that of the
  Patarines, but the question of marriage and simony paled before the more
  glaring one, of which of the rival claimants was the actual Pope.</p>

  <p>The voice of Landulf Cotta was silenced. A terrible cancer had consumed
  the tongue which had kept Milan for six years in a blaze of faction. But his
  room was speedily filled by a more implacable adversary of the married
  clergy&mdash;his brother, Herlembald, a stern, able soldier. An event in
  Herlembald's early life had embittered his heart against the less rigid
  clergy. His plighted bride had behaved lightly with a priest. He was just
  returned from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, his zeal kindled to enthusiasm. He
  went to Rome, where he was well received by Alexander II. He came for
  authority to use his sword for the Patarines. The sectaries in Milan had said
  to him, "We desire to deliver the Church, besieged and degraded by the
  married priests; do thou deliver by the law of the sword, we will do so by
  the law of God." Alexander II., in a public consistory, created Herlembald
  "Defender of the Church," gave him the sacred banner of St. Peter, and bade
  him go back to Milan and shed blood&mdash;his, if necessary, those of the
  anti-Patarines certainly&mdash;in this miserable quarrel.</p>

  <p>The result was that the Patarines were filled with new zeal, and lost all
  compunction at shedding blood and pillaging houses. Herlembald established
  himself in a large mansion, which he fortified and filled with mercenaries;
  over it waved the consecrated banner of St. Peter. From this stronghold he
  issued forth to assail the obnoxious clergy. They were dragged from their
  altars and consigned to shame and insult. The services of the Church, the
  celebration of the sacraments, were suspended, or administered only by the
  one or two priests who adhered to the Patari. It is said that, in order to
  keep his rude soldiery in pay, Herlembald made every clerk take a solemn oath
  that he had ever kept innocence, and would wholly abstain from marriage or
  concubinage. Those who could not, or would not, take this oath were expelled
  the city, and their whole property confiscated to support the standing corps
  of hireling ruffians maintained by the Crusader. The lowest rabble, poor
  artisans and ass-drivers, furtively placed female ornaments in the chambers
  of the priests, and then, attacking their houses, dragged them out and
  plundered their property. By 1064, when a synod was held at Mantua by the
  Pope, Milan was purged of "Simoniacs and Nicolaitans," and the clergy who
  remained were gathered together into a house to live in common, under
  rule.</p>

  <p>Guido of Milan and all the Lombard prelates attended that important synod,
  which saw the triumph of Alexander, his reconciliation with the Emperor, and
  the general abandonment of the anti-Pope, Cadalus.</p>

  <p>In the following year, Henry IV. was under the tutelage of Adalbert of
  Bremen; he had escaped from Anno, Archbishop of Cologne, who had favoured the
  strict faction and Alexander II. The situation in Lombardy changed
  simultaneously. Herlembald had assumed a power, an authority higher than that
  of the archbishop, whom he refused to recognise, and denounced as a heretic.
  Guido, weary of the nine years of strife he had endured, relieved from the
  fear of interference from Germany, resolved on an attempt to throw off the
  hateful yoke. The churches of Milan were for the most part without pastors.
  The married clergy had been expelled, and there were none to take their
  place. The Archbishop had been an obedient penitent for five years,
  compromising his one hundred years of penitence by payments into the Papal
  treasury; but as the cause of Alexander declined, his contrition languished,
  died out; and he resumed his demands for fees at ordinations and
  institutions, at least so clamoured Ariald and Herlembald in the ears of
  Rome.</p>

  <p>A party in Milan had long resented the despotism of the "Law of God and
  the law of the sword" of Ariald and Herlembald, and an effort was made to
  break it, with the sanction, no doubt, of the Archbishop. A large body of the
  citizens rose, "headed," says Andrew of Strumi, "by the sons of the priests,"
  and attacked the church and house of Ariald, but, unable to find him,
  contented themselves with wrecking the buildings. Thereupon Herlembald swept
  down at the head of his mercenaries, surrounded the crowd, and hewed them to
  pieces to the last man, "like the vilest cattle."[38]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[38] Hæc ut nobilis Herembaldus ceterique Fideles
  audiere, sumptis armis, in audacem plebem et temerariam irruere; quos
  protinus exterminavere omnes, quasi essent vilissimæ pecudes,"&mdash;<i>Andr.
  Strum.</i></p>

  <p>Guido, the Archbishop, now acted with resolution, and boldly took up the
  cause of the married clergy. Having heard that two priests of Monza, infected
  with Patarinism, had turned their wives out of their houses, he ordered the
  arrest of the priests, and punished them with imprisonment in the castle of
  Lecco. On hearing this, the Patarines flew to arms, and swarmed out of Milan
  after Ariald, who bore the banner of St. Peter, as Herlembald was absent at
  Rome. They met the mounted servants of the Archbishop near Monza, surprised
  them, and wrested from them a promise to surrender the priests. Three days
  after, the curates were delivered up. Ariald, at the head of the people, met
  them outside the gates, received them with enthusiasm, crying, "See, these
  are the brave martyrs of Christ!" and escorted them to a church, where they
  intoned a triumphant <i>Te Deum</i>.</p>

  <p>Herlembald returned from Rome to Milan with a bull of excommunication
  fulminated by the Pope against the Archbishop. Guido summoned the Milanese to
  assemble in the cathedral church on the vigil of Pentecost.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the Patarines were torn into factions on a subtle point
  mooted by Ariald. That demagogue had ventured to assail in a sermon the
  venerable custom of the Milanese, which required them to fast during the
  Rogation days. Was he greater than St. Ambrose? Did he despise the authority
  of the great doctor? On this awful subject the Patarines divided, and with
  the division lost their strength.</p>

  <p>Neither Herlembald nor Ariald seems to have been prepared for the bold
  action of the Archbishop. On the appointed day the cathedral was filled with
  substantial citizens and nobles. Herlembald missed the wolfish eyes, ragged
  hair, and hollow cheeks of his sectaries, and, fearing danger, leaped over
  the chancel rails, and took up his position near the altar. The Archbishop
  mounted the ambone with the bull of excommunication in his hand. "See!" he
  exclaimed, "this is the result of the turbulence of these demagogues, Ariald
  and Herlembald. This city, out of reverence to St. Ambrose, has never obeyed
  the Roman Church. Shall we be crushed? Take away out of the land of the
  living these disturbers of the public peace who labour day and night to rob
  us of our ancient liberties."</p>

  <p>He was interrupted by a shout of "Let them be killed." Guido paused, and
  then cried out, "All who honour and cleave to St. Ambrose, leave the church,
  that we may know who are our adversaries." Instantly from the doors rolled
  out the dense crowd, seven hundred in number, according to the estimation of
  Andrew, the biographer of Ariald. Only twelve men were left within who stood
  firm to the Patarine cause. Ariald had, in the meantime, taken refuge in the
  choir beside Herlembald. The clergy selected Ariald, the laity Herlembald,
  for their victims. Ariald was dragged from the church, severely wounded.
  Herlembald escaped better; using his truncheon, he beat off his assailants
  till he had climbed to a place of safety, whence he could not be easily
  dislodged.</p>

  <p>As night fell, the Patarines gathered, stormed, and pillaged the palace of
  the Archbishop, and, bursting into the church, liberated Herlembald. Guido
  hardly escaped on horseback, sorely maltreated in the tumult. His adherents
  fled like smoke before the tempest. Ariald was found bleeding and faint, and
  was conveyed by the multitude in triumph to the church of St. Sepolcro. Then
  Herlembald called to the roaring mob to be still. "Let us ask Master Ariald
  whose house is to be first given up to sack."</p>

  <p>But Ariald earnestly dissuaded from further violence, and entreated the
  vehement dictator to spare the lives and property of their enemies.</p>

  <p>The surprise to the Archbishop's party was, however, temporary only. By
  morning they had rallied, and the city was again in their hands. Guido
  published an interdict against Milan, which was to remain in force as long as
  it harboured Ariald. No mass was said, no bells rang, the church doors were
  bolted and barred. Ariald was secretly removed by some of his friends to the
  village of St. Victor, where also Herlembald had been constrained to take
  refuge with a party of mercenaries. Thence they made their way to Pavia and
  to Padua, where they hoped to obtain a boat, and escape to Rome. But the
  whole country was up against them, and Herlembald was obliged to disband his
  soldiers, and attempt to escape in disguise. Ariald was left with a priest
  whose acquaintance Herlembald had made in Jerusalem. But a priest was the
  last person likely to secrete the tyrant and persecutor of the clergy. He
  treacherously sent word to the Archbishop, and Ariald was taken by the
  servants of Olivia, the niece of Guido, and conveyed to an island on the Lago
  Maggiore. He was handed over to the cruel mercies of two married priests, who
  directed his murder with cold-blooded heartlessness, if we may trust the
  gossips picked up later. His ears, nose and lips were cut off. He was asked
  if he would acknowledge Guido for archbishop. "As long as my tongue can
  speak," he replied, "I will not." The servants of Olivia tore out his tongue;
  he was beaten by the two savage priests, and when he fainted, was flung into
  the calm waters of the lovely lake. Andrew of Vallombrosa, or Strumi,
  followed in his trace, and hung about the neighbourhood till he heard from a
  peasant the awful story. He sought the mangled body.[39] It was found and
  transported to Milan on the feast of the Ascension following. For ten days it
  was exposed in the church of St. Ambrose, that all might venerate it, and was
  finally disposed in the convent of St. Celsus. In the memory of man, never
  had such a crowd been seen. The Archbishop deemed it prudent to retire, and
  Herlembald profited by his absence to recover his power, and make the people
  swear to avenge the martyr, and unite to the death for the "good cause." The
  events in Milan had their counterpart in the other cities of Lombardy,
  especially at Cremona, where the bishopric had been obtained by Arnulf,
  nephew of Guido of Milan. In that city, twelve men, headed by one
  Christopher, took the Patarine oath to fight the married clergy; the people
  joined them, and forced their oath on the bishop-elect before he was
  ordained. But, as in 1067, he seized a Patarine priest, a sedition broke out,
  in which the bishop was seriously injured. The inhabitants of Cremona, after
  Easter, sent ambassadors to the Pope, and received from him a reply, given by
  Bonizo, exhorting them not to allow a priest, deacon or sub-deacon, suspected
  of concubinage or simony, to hold a benefice or execute his ministry. The
  consequence of this letter was that all suspected clerks were excluded from
  their offices; and shortly after, the same course was followed at Piacenza.
  Asti, Lodi, and Ravenna also threw in their lot with the Patarines.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[39] Ariald was murdered on June 27, 1065. Andrew of
  Strumi says 1066; but he followed the Florentine computation&mdash;he had
  been a priest of Florence&mdash;which made the year begin on March 25.</p>

  <p>In 1067, Alexander II. sent legates to Milan to settle the disturbances
  therein. Adalbert of Bremen had fallen, and again the Papal party were in the
  ascendant. The fortunes of Milan fluctuated with the politics of those who
  held the regency in the minority of Henry IV.</p>

  <p>Guido, now advanced in years, and weary of ruling so turbulent a diocese,
  determined to vacate a see which he had held for twenty-seven years; the last
  ten of incessant civil war. He burdened it with a pension to himself, and
  then made it over to Godfrey, the sub-deacon, along with the pastoral staff
  and ring. Godfrey crossed the Alps, took the oath of allegiance to the
  Emperor, promised to use his utmost endeavours to exterminate the Patarines,
  and to deliver Herlembald alive into the hands of the Emperor, laden with
  chains. Friend and foe, without scruple, designate the followers of the Papal
  policy as Patarines; it is therefore startling, a few years later, when the
  Popes had carried their point, to find them insisting on the luckless
  Patarines being given in wholesale hecatombs to the flames, as damnable
  heretics. It was an ungracious return for the battle these heretics had
  fought under the banner of St. Peter.</p>

  <p>But Herlembald refused to acknowledge Godfrey, he devastated the country
  with fire and sword wherever Godfrey was acknowledged, and created such havoc
  that not a day passed in the holy Lenten fast without the effusion of much
  Christian blood. Finally, Herlembald drove the archbishop-elect to take
  refuge in the strong fortress of Castiglione. Guido, not receiving his
  pension, annulled his resignation, and resumed his state. But he unwisely
  trusted to the good faith of Herlembald; he was seized,[40] and shut up in a
  monastery till his death, which took place August 23, 1071.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[40] "Gloriosus hac vice delusus," says Arnulf.</p>

  <p>The year before this, 1070, Adelheid, Margravine of Turin, mother-in-law
  of the young Emperor, attacked the Patarines, and burnt the cities of Lodi
  and Asti. On March 19, 1071, as Herlembald was besieging Castiglione, a
  terrible conflagration broke out in Milan, and consumed a great part of the
  city and several of the stateliest churches. Whilst the army of Herlembald
  was agitated by the report of the fire, Godfrey burst out of Castiglione, and
  almost routed the besiegers. Before the death of Guido, Herlembald, with the
  sanction of the Pope, had set up a certain Otto to be Archbishop, nominated
  by himself and the Papal legate, without consulting the electors of Milan or
  the Emperor, January 6, A.D. 1072.</p>

  <p>Otto was but a youth, just admitted into holy orders, likely to prove a
  pliant tool in the strong hand of the dictator. It was the Feast of the
  Epiphany, and the streets were thronged with people, when the news leaked out
  that an archbishop had been chosen, and was now holding the customary banquet
  after election in the archiepiscopal palace.</p>

  <p>The people were furious, rose and attacked the house, hunted the youthful
  prelate out of an attic, where he had taken refuge, dragged him by his legs
  and arms into the church, and compelled him to swear to renounce his dignity.
  The Roman legate hardly escaped with his robes torn.</p>

  <p>Herlembald, who had been surprised, recovered the upper hand in Milan on
  the morrow, but not in the open country, which was swept by the imperial
  troops. The suffragan bishops of Lombardy assembled at Novara directly they
  heard of what had taken place in Milan, and consecrated Godfrey as their
  archbishop.</p>

  <p>Otto appealed to Rome (January, 1072), and a few weeks later the Pope
  assembled a synod, and absolved Otto of his oath extorted from him at Milan,
  acknowledged him as archbishop, and struck Godfrey with interdict. Alexander
  II. died April 21, 1073, and the tiara rested on the brows of the great
  Hildebrand.</p>

  <p>On June 24, Hildebrand, now Gregory VII., wrote to the Margravine Beatrice
  to abstain from all relations with the excommunicated bishops of Lombardy; on
  June 28, to William, Bishop of Pavia, to oppose the usurper, the
  excommunicate Godfrey of Milan; on July 1, to all the faithful of Lombardy to
  refrain from that false bishop, who lay under the apostolic ban. From Capua,
  on September 27, he wrote to Herlembald, exhorting him to fight valiantly,
  and hold out Milan against the usurper Godfrey. Again, on October 9, to
  Herlembald, bidding him be of good courage; he hoped to detach the young
  Emperor from the party of Godfrey, and bade him receive amicably those who,
  with true sentiments of contrition, came over to the Patarine, that is, the
  Papal side.</p>

  <p>On March 10, 1074, Gregory held one of the most important synods, not of
  his reign only, but ever held by any Pope. The acts of this assembly have
  been lost or suppressed, but its most important decisions were summed up in a
  letter from Gregory to the Bishop of Constance. This letter has not been
  printed in the Registrum; but fortunately it has been preserved by two
  contemporary writers, Paul of Bernried, and Bernold of Constance, the latter
  of whom has supplied a detailed apology for the law of celibacy promulgated
  in that synod. Gregory absolutely forbade all priests sullied with the
  <i>crimen fornicationis</i>, which embraced legitimate marriage, either to
  say a mass or to serve at one; and the people were strictly enjoined to shun
  their churches and their sacraments; and when the bishops were remiss, he
  exhorted them themselves to enforce the pontifical sentence.[41]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[41] "Audivimus quod quidam Episcoporum apud vos
  commorantium, aut sacerdotes, et diaconi, et subdiaconi, mulieribus
  commisceantur aut consentiant aut negligant. His præcipimus vos nullo modo
  obedire, vel illorum præceptis consentire, sicut ipsi apostolicæ sedis
  præceptis non obediunt neque auctoritati sanctorum patrum consentiunt."
  "Quapropter ad omnes de quorum fide et devotione confidimus nunc convertimur,
  rogantes vos et apostolicâ auctoritate admonentes ut quidquid Episcopi dehinc
  loquantur aut taceant, vos officium eorum quos aut simoniace promotos et
  ordinatos aut in crimine fornicationis jacentes cognoveritis, nullatenus
  recipiatis."&mdash;Letter to the Franconians (Baluze, <i>Misc.</i> vii. p.
  125).</p>

  <p>The results shall be described in the words of a contemporary historian,
  Sigebert of Gemblours. "Many," says he, "seeing in this prohibition to hear a
  mass said by a married priest a manifest contradiction to the doctrine of the
  Fathers, who believed that the efficacy of sacrament, such as baptism,
  chrism, and the Body and Blood of Christ, is independent of the dignity of
  the minister, thence resulted a grievous scandal; never, perhaps, even in the
  time of the great heresies, was the Church divided by a greater schism. Some
  did not abandon their simony, others disguised their avarice under a more
  acceptable name; what they boasted they had given gratuitously, they in
  reality sold; very few preserved continence. Some through greed of lucre, or
  sentiments of pride, simulated chastity, but many added false oaths and
  numerous adulteries to their debaucheries. The laity seized the opportunity
  to rise against the clerical order, and to excuse themselves for disobedience
  to the Church. They profaned the holy mysteries, administering baptism
  themselves, and using the wax out of their ears as chrism. They refused on
  their death-beds to receive the <i>viaticum</i> from the married priests;
  they would not even be buried by them. Some went so far as to trample under
  foot the Host, and pour out the precious Blood consecrated by married
  priests."[42]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[42] Pertz, viii. p. 362.</p>

  <p>The affairs of the church of Milan continued in the same unsatisfactory
  condition. The contest between the Patarines and their adversaries had taken
  greater dimensions. The question which divided them was now less that of the
  marriage of the clergy than which of the rival archbishops was to be
  acknowledged. Godfrey was supported by the Emperor, Otto by the Pope. The
  parties were about even; neither Godfrey nor Otto could maintain himself in
  Milan; the former fortified himself in the castle of Brebbio, the latter
  resided at Rome. Henry IV., in spite of all the admonitions of the Pope,
  persisted in supporting the cause of Godfrey. Milan was thus without a
  pastor. The suffragan bishops wished to execute their episcopal functions in
  the city, and to consecrate the holy oils for the benediction of the fonts at
  Whitsuntide. Herlembald, when one of the bishops had sent chrism into the
  city for the purpose, poured it out on the ground and stamped on it, because
  it had been consecrated by an excommunicated prelate.</p>

  <p>In March, 1075, another conflagration broke out in the city, and raged
  with even greater violence than the fire of 1071. Herlembald had again poured
  forth the oils, as he had the year before; and had ordered Leutprand, a
  priest, as Easter came, to proceed to the consecration of chrism. This
  innovation roused the alarm of the Milanese; the subsequent conflagration
  convinced them that it was abhorrent to heaven. All the adversaries of the
  Patarines assembled outside the city, and swore to preserve intact the
  privileges of St. Ambrose, and to receive only the bishop nominated or
  approved by the King. Then, entering the city, they fell unexpectedly on the
  Patarines. Leutprand was taken and mutilated, his ears and nose were cut off.
  The standard of St. Peter was draggled in the dust, and Herlembald fell with
  it, cut down by a noble, Arnold de Rauda. Every insult was heaped on the body
  of the "Defender of the Church," and the sacred banner was trampled under
  foot.</p>

  <p>Messengers were sent to Henry IV. to announce the triumph, and to ask him
  to appoint a new Archbishop of Milan. Henry was so rejoiced at the victory,
  that he abandoned Godfrey, and promised the Milanese a worthy prelate. His
  choice fell on Tebald, a Milanese sub-deacon in his Court.</p>

  <p>Pope Urban II. canonised Herlembald. Ariald seems never to have been
  formally enrolled among the saints, but he received honours as a saint at
  Milan, and has been admitted into several Italian Martyrologies, and into the
  collection of the Bollandists. Baronius wisely expunged Herlembald and Ariald
  from the Roman Martyrology; nevertheless, the disgraceful fact remains, that
  the ruffian Herlembald has been canonised by Papal bull.</p>

  <p>The seeds of fresh discord remained. Leutprand, or Liprand, the priest,
  was curate of the Church of St. Paul;[43] having suffered mutilation in the
  riot, he was regarded in the light of a Patarine confessor. But no outbreak
  took place till the death of Anselm IV., Archbishop of Milan (September 30,
  1101), at Constantinople, where he was on his way with the Crusaders to the
  Holy Land. His vicar, the Greek, Peter Chrysolaus, Bishop of Savonia, whom
  the Lombards called Grossulani, perhaps because of the coarse habit he wore
  (more probably as a corruption for Chrysolaus), had been left in charge of
  the see of Milan. On the news of the death of the Archbishop reaching that
  city, the Primicerius convoked the electors to choose a successor. The vote
  fell on Landulf, Ordinary of Milan; but he was not yet returned from
  Jerusalem, whither he had gone as a crusader. Grossulani declared the
  election informal. Thereupon the Abbot of St. Dionysius, at the head of a
  large party of the electors, chose Peter Grossulani. There is no evidence of
  his having used bribery in any form; but he may have acted unjustly in
  cancelling the election of Landulf. It is, however, fair to observe that
  Landulf, on his return, supported Grossulani; consequently, it is probable
  that the latter acted strictly in accordance with law and precedent.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[43] The life of Liprand was written by Landulf the
  younger, his sister's son, in his <i>Hist. Mediolan.</i> 1095-1137.</p>

  <p>But the election displeased Liprand and the remains of the Patarines. They
  appealed to Rome, but Grossulani, supported by the Countess Matilda and St.
  Bernard, abbot of Vallombrosa, overcame their objections. Pope Paschal II.
  ratified the election, and sent the pall to the Archbishop. Ardericus de
  Carinate had been sent to Rome on behalf of Grossulani. The people came out
  of the gates, on his approach, to learn the result. Ardericus, hanging the
  pall across his umbrella (<i>protensi virga</i>), waved it over his head,
  shouting, "Ecco la stola! Ecco la stola!" (Here is the pall!) and led the way
  into the cathedral, whither Grossulani also hastened, and ascending the
  pulpit in his pontifical habit, placed the coveted insignia about his
  neck.</p>

  <p>Liprand was not satisfied. By means of private agitation, he disturbed the
  tranquillity of public feeling, and the Archbishop, to calm the minds of the
  populace, was obliged to convoke a provincial synod at Milan (1103), in
  which, in the presence of his suffragans, the clergy and the people, he said,
  "If anyone has a charge to make against me, let him speak openly at the
  present time, or he shall not be heard."</p>

  <p>Liprand would not appear before the council and formally make charge, but
  he mounted the pulpit in the Church of St. Paul and preached against the
  Archbishop as a simoniac. He declared his readiness to prove his charge by
  the ordeal of fire. The bishops assembled in council refused to suffer the
  attempt to be made.</p>

  <p>However, Liprand was not deterred. "Look at my amputated nose and ears!"
  he cried, "I am a confessor for Christ. I will try the ordeal by fire to
  substantiate my charge. Grossulani is a simoniac, by gift of hand, gift of
  tongue, and gift of homage." And he gave his wolf-skin cloak and some bottles
  of wine in exchange for wood, which the crowd carried off and heaped up in a
  great pile against the wall of the monastery of St. Ambrogio. The Archbishop
  sent his servants, and they overturned the stack, and scattered the wood.
  Then the crowd of "boys and girls, men and women," poured through the main
  streets, roaring, "Away with Grossulani, away with him!" and clamoured around
  the doors of the archiepiscopal palace, so that Grossulani, fearing for his
  life, said, "Be it so, let the fellow try the fire, or let him leave Milan."
  His servants with difficulty appeased the people, by promising that the
  ordeal should be undergone on the following Palm Sunday evening. "I will not
  leave the city," said Liprand; "but now I have no money for buying wood, and
  I will not sell my books, as I keep them for my nephew Landulf, now at
  school." So the magistrates of the city prepared a pile of billets of oak
  wood.</p>

  <p>On the appointed day Liprand, barefooted, in sackcloth, bearing a cross,
  went to the Church of Saints Gervasius and Protasius and sung mass.
  Grossulani also, bearing a cross, entered the same church and mounted the
  pulpit, attended by Ariald de Marignano, and Berard, Judge of Asti. Silence
  being made, and Liprand having taken his place barefooted "on the marble
  stone at the entrance to the choir, containing an image of Hercules,"
  Grossulani addressed the people; "Listen, and I will silence this man in
  three words." Then turning to Liprand, he asked, "You have charged me with
  being a simoniac. To whom have I given anything? Answer me."</p>

  <p>Liprand, raising his eyes to the pulpit, pointed to those who occupied it
  and said, "Look at those three great devils, who think to confound me by
  their wit and wealth.[44] I appeal to the judgment of God."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[44] "Proposuisti quod ego sum simoniacus per munus a
  manu. Modo die: cui dedi; Tunc presbyter super populum oculos aperuit, et
  digitum ad eos, qui stabunt in pulpito, extendit, dicens, Videte tres
  grandissimos diabolos, qui per ingenium et pecuniam suam putant me
  confundere."</p>

  <p>Grossulani said, "But I ask what act of simony do you lay to my
  charge?"</p>

  <p>Liprand answered, "Do you answer me, What is the lightest form of
  simony?"</p>

  <p>The Archbishop, after some consideration, answered, "To refrain from
  deposing a simoniac."</p>

  <p>"And I say that is simony which consists in deposing an abbot from his
  abbacy, a bishop from his bishopric, and an archbishop from his
  archbishopric."[45]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[45] It is very evident from this discussion that
  Grossulani was innocent of true simony; the whole charge against him was due
  to his having quashed the election of Landulf, and thus of having deposed,
  after a fashion, "an archbishop from his archbishopric."</p>

  <p>The people became impatient, and began to shout, "Come out, come out to
  the ordeal!" Then Liprand "jumped down from the stone, containing the image
  of Hercules," and went forth accompanied by the multitude to the field where
  the pyre was made. There arose then a difficulty about the form of oath to be
  administered. Liprand, seeing that there was some hesitation, said, "Let me
  manage it, and see if I do not satisfy you all!" Whereupon he took hold of
  the hood of the Archbishop and shook it, and said in a loud voice, "That
  Grossulani, who is under this hood, he, and no other, has obtained the
  archbishopric of Milan simoniacally, by gift of hand, gift of tongue, and
  gift of service. And I, who enter on this ordeal, swear that I have used no
  charm, or incantation, or witchcraft."</p>

  <p>The Archbishop, unwilling to remain, remounted his horse and rode to the
  Church of St. John "ad concham," but Ariald of Marignano remained to see that
  the ordeal was rightly carried out. When the pile was lighted, he said to the
  priest, "In heaven's name, return to your duty, and do not rush on certain
  death." But Liprand answered, "Get thee behind me, Satan," and signing
  himself, and blessing the fire with consecrated water, he rushed through the
  flames, barefooted, in sackcloth cassock and silk chasuble. He came out on
  the other side uninjured; a sudden draught had parted the flames as he
  entered, and when he emerged his feet were not burnt, nor was his silk
  chasuble scorched.</p>

  <p>The people shouted at the miracle, and Grossulani was obliged to fly from
  the city.</p>

  <p>It was soon rumoured, however, that Liprand was suffering from a scorched
  hand and an injured foot. It was in vain for his friends to assure the people
  that his hand had been burnt when he was throwing the holy water on the
  flames before he entered them, and that his foot was injured not by the fire,
  but by the hoof of a horse as he emerged from the flames. One part of the mob
  began to clamour against Liprand that he was an impostor, the other to exalt
  him as a saint, and the streets became the scene of riot and bloodshed. At
  this juncture Landulf of Vereglate, who had been just elected to the vacant
  see, arrived from Jerusalem, and finding that the Archbishop had fled the
  city, he appealed to the people to cease from their riots, and promised to
  have Grossulani deposed, or at least the charges brought against him properly
  investigated at Rome. The tumults were with difficulty allayed, and the
  Archbishop, Landulf, and Liprand went to Rome (A.D. 1103). A Synod was
  convened and Liprand brought his vague accusations of simony against the
  Archbishop. Landulf refused to support him, so that it is hardly probable
  that he can have felt himself aggrieved by the conduct of Grossulani.
  Liprand, being unable to substantiate his charge of simony, was obliged to
  change the nature of his accusation, and charged the Archbishop with having
  forced him to submit to the ordeal of fire. The Pope and the Synod required
  the Archbishop to clear himself by oath; accordingly Grossulani did so, in
  the following terms: "I, Grossulani, by the grace of God Archbishop, did not
  force Liprand to enter the fire." Azo, Bishop of Acqui, and Arderic, Bishop
  of Lodi, took the oath with him; at the same time the pastoral staff slipped
  from the hands of the Archbishop and fell on the floor, a sign, the
  biographer of Liprand says, that he forswore himself.[46]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[46] It is evident from the account of Landulf the
  younger himself, that the Archbishop did not force the priest to enter on the
  ordeal.</p>

  <p>The Archbishop withdrew his authority confirmed by the Holy See, and he
  returned to Milan, where he was well received.</p>

  <p>The Archbishop took an unworthy opportunity, in 1110, of ridding the city
  of the presence of Liprand for that priest having taken into his house and
  cured a certain Herebert of Bruzano, an enemy of the Archbishop, who was ill
  with fever. Grossulani deprived Liprand of his benefice, and the priest
  retired into the Valteline. Troubles broke out in Milan between the two
  parties, which produced civil war, and the Archbishop was driven out of the
  city, whereupon Liprand returned to it. The friends of Grossulani persuaded
  him to visit Jerusalem, and he started, after having appointed Arderic,
  Bishop of Lodi, his vicar (A.D. 1111). During his absence both parties united
  to reject him, and they elected Jordano of Cliva in his room (Jan. 1, A.D.
  1112). Mainnard, Archbishop of Turin, hastened to Rome, and received the pall
  from the Pope, on condition that it should not be worn for six months. But
  the rumours having spread that Grossulani was returning from Jerusalem,
  Mainnard came to Milan, and placed the pall on the altar of St. Ambrose,
  whence Jordano took it and laid it about his shoulders.</p>

  <p>On the return of Grossulani, civil war broke out again between the two
  factions, which ended in both Archbishops being summoned to Rome in 1116; and
  the Pope ordered Grossulani to return to his bishopric of Savonia, and
  confirmed Jordano in the archbishopric of Milan. But before this Liprand had
  died 3rd January, 1113. His sanctity was almost immediately attested by a
  miracle, in spite of the disparagement of his virtues by the party of the
  Archbishop Grossulani; for a certain knight of Piacenza, having swallowed a
  fish-bone which stuck in his throat, in sleep saw the priest appear to him
  and touch his throat, whereupon a violent fit of coughing ensued, in which
  the bone was ejected; this was considered quite sufficient to establish the
  claim of Liprand to be regarded as a saint.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE ANABAPTISTS OF MÜNSTER</h2>

  <p class="first">TO the year 1524 Münster, the capital of Westphalia, had
  remained faithful to the religion which S. Swibert, coadjutor of S.
  Willibrord, first Bishop of Utrecht, had brought to it in the 7th century.
  But then Lutheranism was introduced into it.</p>

  <p>Frederick von Wied at that time occupied the Episcopal throne. He was
  brother to Hermann, Archbishop of Cologne, who was afterwards deprived for
  his secession to Lutheranism.</p>

  <p>The religious revolution in the Westphalian capital at its commencement
  presents the same symptoms which characterised the beginning of the
  Reformation elsewhere. The town council were prepared to hail it as a means
  of overthrowing the Episcopal authority, and establishing the municipal power
  as supreme in the city.</p>

  <p>Already the State of Juliers had embraced the new religion, and faith had
  been shaken in Osnabrück, Minden, and Paderborn, when the first symptoms
  appeared in Münster.</p>

  <p>Four priests, the incumbents of the parishes of St. Lambert, St. Ludger,
  St. Martin, and the Lieb-Frau Church, commonly called Ueberwasser, declared
  for the Reform. The contemporary historian, Kerssenbroeck, an eye-witness of
  all he describes, says of them, "They indulged in the most violent abuse of
  the clergy, they cursed good works, assured their auditors that such works
  would not receive the smallest recompense, and permitted every one to give
  way to all the excesses of so-called Evangelical liberty."[47] They stirred
  up their hearers against the religious orders, and the people clamoured daily
  at the gates of the monasteries and nunneries, insisting on being given food;
  and the monks and nuns were too much frightened to refuse those whom impunity
  rendered daily more exacting.[48] On the night of the 22nd March, 1525, they
  attacked the rich convent of nuns at Nizink, with intentions of pillaging it.
  They failed in this attempt, and the ringleaders were seized and led before
  the magistrates, followed by an excited and tumultuous crowd of men and
  women, "evangelically disposed," as the chronicler says. Hoping to ally the
  effervescence, the magistrates asked the cause of complaint against the nuns
  of Nizink, and then came out the true reason, for which religious prejudice
  had served as a cloak. They complained that the monks and nuns exercised
  professions to the prejudice of the artisans; and they demanded of the
  magistracy that their looms should be broken, the religious forbidden to work
  at trades, and their superabundant goods to be distributed among the poor.
  The orators of the band declared in conclusion "that if the magistrates
  refused to grant these requests, the people would disregard their orders,
  displace them by force of arms, and put in their stead men trustworthy and
  loyal, and devoted to the interests of the citizens."[49] Alarmed at these
  threats, the magistrates yielded, and promised to take every measure
  satisfactory to the insurgents.[50] On the 25th May, accordingly, the Friars
  of St. Francis and the nuns of Nizink were ordered to give up their looms and
  accounts. The friars yielded, but the ladies stoutly refused. The
  magistrates, however, had all the looms carried away, whilst a mob howled at
  the gates, and agitators, excited by the four renegade priests, ran about the
  town stirring up the people against the religious. "All the worst
  characters," says the old chronicler, "joined the rioters; the curious came
  to swell the crowd, and people of means shut themselves into their
  houses."[51] For Johann Groeten, the orator of the band, now proclaimed that
  having emptied the strong boxes of the monks and nuns, they would despoil all
  those whose fortunes exceeded two thousand ducats.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[47] Kerssenbroeck, p. 114.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[48] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 115.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[49] Kerssenbroeck, p. 116.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[50] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 117.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[51] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 120.</p>

  <p>The rioters next marched to the town hall, where the senators sat
  trembling, and they demanded the immediate confirmation of a petition in
  thirty-four articles that had been drawn up for them by their leaders. At the
  same time the mob announced that unless their petition was granted they would
  execute its requirements with their own hands.</p>

  <p>It asked that the canons of the cathedral should be required to pay the
  debts of the bishop deceased; that criminal jurisdiction should be withdrawn
  from the hands of the clergy; that the monks and nuns should be forbidden to
  exercise any manufacture, to dry grain, make linen, and rear cattle; that the
  burden of taxation should be shared by the clergy; that rectors should not be
  allowed to appoint or dismiss their curates without consent of the parish;
  that lawsuits should not be allowed to be protracted beyond six weeks; that
  beer licences should be abolished, and tolls on the bridges done away with;
  that monks and nuns should be allowed free permission to leave their
  religious societies and return to the world; that the property of religious
  houses should be sold and distributed amongst the needy, and that the
  municipality should allow them enough for their subsistence; that the
  Carmelites, the Augustinians, and the Dominicans should be suppressed; that
  pious foundations for masses for the repose of souls should be confiscated;
  and that people should be allowed to marry in Lent and Advent. The
  magistrates yielded at once, and promised to endeavour to get the consent of
  the other estates of the diocese to the legalising of these articles.[52]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[52] Kerssenbroeck, p. 126.</p>

  <p>On the morrow of the Ascension, 1525, the magistrates closed the gates of
  the town, and betook themselves to the clergy of the chapter to request them
  to accept the thirty-four articles. The canons refused at first, but, in fear
  of the people, they consented, but wrote to the bishop to tell him what had
  taken place, and to urge him to act with promptitude, and not to forget that
  the rights and privileges of the Church were in jeopardy.</p>

  <p>It was one of the misfortunes in Germany, as it was in France, that the
  clergy were exempt from taxation. This precipitated the Revolution in France,
  and aroused the people against the clergy; and in Germany it served as a
  strong motive for the adoption of the Reformation.</p>

  <p>The canons now fled the town, protesting that their signatures had been
  wrested from them by violence, and that they withdrew their consent to the
  articles. The inferior clergy remained at their post, and exhibited great
  energy and decision. They deprived Lubert Causen, minister of St. Martins,
  one of the most zealous fautors of Lutheranism in Münster, and the head of
  the reforming party. When his parishioners objected, a packet of love-letters
  he had written to several girls in the town, and amongst others some to a
  young woman of respectable position whom he had seduced, came to light, and
  were read in the Senate. The reformer had in his letters used scriptural
  texts to excuse and justify the most shameless libertinage.[53] Johann Tante,
  preacher at St. Lambert, and Gottfried Reining, of Ueberwasser, were also
  deprived. As for the Lutheran preacher at St. Ludger, Johann Fink, "his mouth
  was stopped by the gift of a fat prebendal stall, and from that moment he
  entirely lost his zeal for the gospel of Wittenberg, and never uttered
  another word against the Catholic religion."[54]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[53] Kerssenbroeck, p. 128.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[54] <i>Ibid.</i></p>

  <p>By means of the mediation of the Archbishop of Cologne, a reconciliation
  was effected. The articles were abolished and the signatures annulled, and
  the members of the chapter returned to Münster, which had felt their absence
  by the decrease in trade, and the inconstant people "showed at least as much
  joy at their return as they had shown hatred at their departure."[55]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[55] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 138.</p>

  <p>There can be no question but that the Reformation in Germany was provoked
  to a large extent by abuses and corruptions in the Church. To a much larger
  extent it was a revolt against the Papacy which had weakened and numbed the
  powers of the Empire throughout the Middle Ages from the time of the Emperor
  Henry IV. But chiefly as a social and political movement it was the revolt of
  municipalities against the authority of collegiate bodies of clergy and the
  temporal jurisdiction of prince-bishops, or of grand dukes and margraves and
  electors favouring the change because it allowed them at a sweep to
  confiscate vast properties and melt down tons of chalices and reliquaries
  into coin.</p>

  <p>In Münster lived a draper, Bernhard Knipperdolling by name, who assembled
  the malcontents in his house, or in a tavern, and poured forth in their ears
  his sarcasms against the Pope, the bishops, the clergy and the Church. He was
  well known for his dangerous influence, and the bishop, Frederic von Wied,
  arrested him as he passed near his residence at Vecht. The people of Münster,
  exasperated at the news of the captivity of their favourite, obliged the
  magistrates and the chapter to ask the bishop to release him. Frederick von
  Wied yielded with reluctance, using these prophetic words, "I consent, but I
  fear that this man will turn everything in Münster and the whole diocese
  upside down." Knipperdolling left prison, after having taken an oath to keep
  the peace; but on his return to Münster he registered a vow that he would
  terribly revenge his incarceration and would make the diocese pay as many
  ducats as his captivity had cost him hellers.[56]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[56] Kerssenbroeck, p. 143.</p>

  <p>There was another man in Münster destined to exercise a fatal influence on
  the unfortunate city. This was a priest named Bernard Rottmann.[57] As a
  child he had been chorister at St. Maurice's Church at Münster, where his
  exquisite voice had attracted notice. He was educated in the choir school,
  then went to Mainz, where in 1524 he took his Master's degree, and returning
  to Münster, was ordained priest in 1529. He was then given the lectureship of
  the church in which, as a boy, he had sung so sweetly. He shortly exhibited a
  leaning towards Lutheranism, and the canons of St. Maurice, who had placed
  great hopes on the young preacher, thinking that he acted from inexperience
  and without bad intent, gave him a paternal reprimand, and provided him with
  funds to go to the University of Cologne, and study there dogmatic and
  controversial theology; at the same time undertaking to retain Rottmann in
  the receipt of his salary as lecturer, and to this they added a handsome
  pension to assist him in his studies.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[57] <i>Ibid.</i> 148; Latin edition, p. 1517-9; Dorpius,
  f. 391 a.</p>

  <p>The young man received this money, and then, instead of going to Cologne,
  betook himself to Wittenberg, where he attached himself to Melancthon. On his
  return to Münster, the canons, unaware of the fraud that had been played upon
  them, reinstated Rottmann in the pulpit. He was too crafty to publish his new
  tenets in his discourses, and thus to insure the loss of his situation, but
  he employed his secret influence in society to spread Lutheranism. After a
  while, when he considered his party strong enough to support him, he threw
  off the mask, and preached boldly against the priests and the bishops, and
  certain doctrines of the Catholic Church. The more violent he became in his
  attacks, the more personal and caustic in his language, the greater grew the
  throng of people to hear him. Then he preached against Confession, which he
  called "the disturber of consciences," and contrasted it with Justification
  by Faith only, which set consciences at ease; he preached against good works,
  against the obligation to observe the moral law, and assured his hearers that
  grace was freely imputed to them, live as they liked, and that the Gospel
  afforded them entire freedom from all restraints. "The shameless dissolution
  which now began to spread through the town," says Kerssenbroeck, "proved that
  the mob adopted the belief in the impunity of sin; all those who were ruined
  in pocket, hoping to get the possessions of others, joined the party of
  innovators, and Rottmann was extolled by them to the skies."[58]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[58] Kerssenbroeck, p. 152.</p>

  <p>The Senate forbade the citizens to attend Rottmann's sermons, but their
  orders were disregarded. The populace declared that Master Bernard was the
  only preacher of the true Gospel, and they covered with slander and abuse
  those who strove to oppose his seductive doctrine. "Some of the episcopal
  councillors, however," says the historian, "favoured the innovator. The
  private secretary of the bishop, Leonhard Mosz, encouraged him secretly, and
  promised him his support in the event of danger."[59]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[59] Kerssenbroeck, p. 152.</p>

  <p>But the faithful clergy informed the bishop of the scandal, and before
  Mosz and others could interfere, a sentence of deprivation was pronounced
  against him.</p>

  <p>Rottmann, startled by this decisive measure, wrote a series of letters to
  Frederick von Wied, which have been preserved by Kerssenbroeck, in which he
  pretended that he had been calumniated before "the best and most just of
  bishops," and excused himself, instead of boldly and frankly announcing his
  secession from the Catholic Church. In reply, the bishop ordered him to quit
  Münster, and charged his councillors to announce to him that his case would
  be submitted to the next synod. Rottmann then wrote to the councillors a
  letter which exhibits his duplicity in a clearer light. Frederick von Wied,
  hearing of this letter, ordered the recalcitrant preacher to quit the convent
  adjoining the church of St. Maurice, and to leave the town. Rottmann
  thereupon took refuge in the house of Knipperdolling and his companions.
  Under the protection of these turbulent men, the young preacher assumed a
  bolder line, and wrote to the bishop demanding a public discussion, and
  announcing that shortly his doctrine would be published in a pamphlet, and
  thus be popularised.</p>

  <p>On the 23rd of January, 1532, Rottmann's profession of faith appeared,
  addressed in the form of a letter to the clergy of Münster.[60] Like all the
  professions of faith of the period, it consisted chiefly of a string of
  negations, with a few positive statements retained from the Catholic creed on
  God, the Incarnation, &amp;c. He denied the special authority of the
  priesthood, reduced the Sacraments to signs, going thereby beyond Luther;
  rejected doctrines of the Eucharistic Sacrifice, Purgatory, the intercession
  of saints, and the use of images, pilgrimages, vows, benedictions, and the
  like. It would certainly have been more appropriately designated a Confession
  of Disbelief. This pamphlet was widely circulated amongst the people, and the
  party of Lutheran malcontents, headed by Knipperdolling, and Herman Bispink,
  a coiner and forger of title-deeds, grew in power, in numbers, and in
  audacity.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[60] Kerssenbroeck, p. 165 <i>et seq.</i>; Latin edition,
  Mencken, p. 1520-8: Sleidan, French tr., p. 406.</p>

  <p>On the 23rd of February, 1532, Knipperdolling and his associates assembled
  the populace early, and carried Rottmann in triumph to the church of St.
  Lambert. Finding the doors shut, they mounted the preacher on a wooden pulpit
  before the bone-house. The Reformer then addressed the people on the
  necessity of proclaiming evangelical liberty and of destroying idolatry; of
  overthrowing images and the Host preserved in the tabernacles. His doctrine
  might be summed up in two words: liberty for the Evangelicals to do what they
  liked, and compulsion for the Catholics. The sermon produced a tremendous
  effect; before it was concluded the rioters rushed towards the different
  churches, burst open the doors, tore down the altars, reliquaries, statues;
  and the Sacrament was taken from the tabernacles and trampled under foot. The
  cathedral alone, defended by massive gates, escaped their fury.[61]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[61] Kerssenbroeck, p. 185; Bullinger, "Adversus
  Anabaptist." lib. ii. c. 8.</p>

  <p>Proud of this achievement, the insurgents defied all authority, secular
  and ecclesiastical, and installed Bernhard Rottmann as preacher and pastor of
  the Evangelical religion in St. Lambert's Church. "Thenceforth," says the
  Münster contemporary historian, "it may well be understood that they did not
  limit themselves to simple tumults, but that murders, pillage, and the
  overthrow of all public order followed. The success of this first enterprise
  had rendered the leaders masters of the city."</p>

  <p>Bishop Frederick von Wied felt that his power was at an end. He was a man
  with no very strong religious zeal or moral courage. He resigned his dignity
  in the sacristy of the church of Werne, reserving to himself a yearly income
  of 2,000 florins. Duke Eric of Brunswick, Prince of Grubenhagen, Bishop of
  Paderborn and Osnabrück, was elected in his room. The nomination of Eric
  irritated the Lutheran party. He was a man zealous for his religion, and with
  powerful relations. Rottmann at once sent him his twenty-nine articles, and
  the artisans of Münster, who had embraced the cause of Rottmann, handed in a
  petition to the magistrates (April 16th, 1532) to request that compulsion
  might be used to force every one to become Lutheran, "because it seems to
  us," said they, "that this doctrine is in all points and entirely conformable
  to the Gospel, whilst that which is taught by the rest of the clergy is
  absurd, and ought to be rejected."[62] The bishop-elect wrote to the
  magistrates, insisting on the dismissal of Rottmann, but in their answer they
  not only declined to obey, but offered an apology for his conduct.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[62] Kerssenbroeck, pp. 189-90.</p>

  <p>The bishop wrote again, but received no answer. Wishing to use every means
  of conciliation, before adopting forcible measures, he sent a deputation to
  Münster to demand the expulsion of the preacher, but without success.</p>

  <p>The people, becoming more insubordinate, determined to take possession of
  other churches. One of the most important is the church of Unsere Lieb-frau,
  or Ueberwasser, a church whose beautiful tower and choir attract the
  admiration of the traveller visiting Münster. This church and parish depended
  on the convent of Ueberwasser; the rector was a man of zeal and power, a Dr.
  Martin, who was peculiarly obnoxious to the Lutheran party. A deputation was
  sent to the abbess, Ida von Merfelt, to insist on the dismissal of the rector
  and the substitution of an Evangelical preacher.[63] The lady was a woman of
  courage; she recommended the deputation to return to their shops and to
  attend to their own business, and announced that Dr. Martin should stay at
  his post; and stay he did, for a time.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[63] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 203.</p>

  <p>The bishop was resolved to try force of arms, when suddenly he died, May
  9th, 1532, after having drunk a goblet of wine. Several writers of the period
  state that it was poisoned. A modern historian says he died of excess of
  drink&mdash;on what authority I do not know.[64] He had brought down upon
  himself the dislike of the Lutherans for having vigorously suppressed the
  reforming movement in Paderborn. The history of that movement in this other
  Westphalian diocese is too suggestive to be passed over. In 1527 the Elector
  John Frederick of Saxony passed through Paderborn and ordered his Lutheran
  preachers to address the people in the streets through the windows of the
  house in which he lodged, as the clergy refused them the use of the churches.
  Next year the agitation began by a quarrel between some of the young citizens
  and the servants of the chapter, and ended in the plundering and devastation
  of the cathedral and the residences of the canons. The leader of the
  Evangelical party in Paderborn was Johann Molner of Buren, a man who had been
  expelled from the city in 1531 for murder and adultery; he left, taking with
  him as his mistress the wife of the man he had murdered, and retired to
  Soest, "where," says a contemporary writer, Daniel von Soest, "he did not
  remain satisfied with this woman only." He returned to Paderborn as a burning
  and shining gospel light, and led the iconoclastic riot. Duke Philip of
  Grubenhagen supported his brother, and the town was forced to pay 2,000
  gulden for the damage done, and to promise to pay damages if any further
  mischief took place, and this so cooled the zeal of the citizens of Paderborn
  for the Gospel that it died out.[65]</p>

  <p>The chapter retired to Ludwigshausen for the purpose of electing the
  successor to Bishop Eric, who had only occupied the see three months; their
  choice fell on Francis von Waldeck, Bishop of Minden, and then of Osnabrück.
  The choice was not fortunate; it was dictated by the exigencies of the times,
  which required a man of rank and power to occupy the vacant throne, so as to
  reduce the disorder by force of arms. Francis of Waldeck was all this, but
  the canons were not at that time aware that he had himself strong leanings
  towards Lutheranism; and after he became Bishop of Münster he would have
  readily changed the religion of the place, had it not been that such a
  proceeding would, under the circumstances, have involved the loss of his
  income as prince-bishop. Later, when the disturbances were at an end, he
  proposed to the Estates the establishment of Lutheranism and the suppression
  of Catholicism, as we shall see in the sequel. He even joined the Smalkald
  union of the Protestant princes against the Catholics in 1544.</p>

  <p>With sentiments so favourable to the Reform, the new bishop would have
  yielded everything to the agitators, had they not assumed a threatening
  attitude, and menaced his temporal position and revenue, which were the only
  things connected with the office for which he cared.</p>

  <p>The inferior clergy of Münster wrote energetically to him on his
  appointment, complaining of the innovations which succeeded each other with
  rapidity in the town. "The Lutheran party," said they in this letter, "are
  growing daily more invasive and insolent," and they implored the bishop to
  protect their rights and liberty of conscience against the tyranny of the new
  party, who, not content with worshipping God in their own way, refused
  toleration to others, outraged their feelings by violating all they held most
  sacred, and disturbed their services by unseemly interruptions.</p>

  <p>Francis of Waldeck renewed the orders of his predecessor. The senate
  acknowledged the receipt of his letter, and promised to answer it on a future
  occasion.</p>

  <p>However, the warmest partisans of Rottmann were resolved to carry matters
  to a climax, and at once to overthrow both the episcopal and the civil
  authority. Knipperdolling persuaded the butcher Modersohn and the skinner
  Redekker that, as provosts of their guilds, they were entitled to convene the
  members of their trades without the intervention of the magistrates. These
  two men accordingly convoked the people for the 1st July.[66] The assembly
  was numerously attended, and opened tumultuously. When silence was obtained,
  a certain Johann Windemuller rose and proclaimed the purpose of the
  convention. "The affair is one of importance," said he; "we have to maintain
  the glory of God, our eternal welfare, the happiness of all our
  fellow-citizens, and the development of our franchises; all these things
  depend on the sacred ecclesiastical liberty announced to us by the worthy
  Rottmann. We must conclude an alliance against the oppressors of the Gospel,
  that the doctrine of Rottmann, which is incontestably the true one, may be
  protected." These words produced such enthusiasm, that the audience shouted
  with one voice that "they would defend Rottmann and his doctrine to their
  last farthing, and the last drop of their blood." Some of those present, by
  their silence, expressed their displeasure, but a draper named Johann
  Mennemann had the courage to raise his voice against the proposal. A furious
  band at once attacked him with their fists, crying out that the enemies of
  the pure Gospel must be destroyed; "already the bold draper was menaced with
  their daggers, when one of his friends succeeded in effecting his escape from
  the popular rage." However, he was obliged to appear before the heads of the
  guilds and answer for his opposition. Mennemann replied, that in weighty
  matters concerning the welfare of the commonwealth, tumultuous proceedings
  were not likely to produce good resolutions, and that he advised the
  separation of the corporations, that the questions might be maturely
  considered and properly weighed.[67]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[66] Kerssenbroeck, p. 207; Dorpius, f. 391 b. 392.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[67] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 208.</p>

  <p>The corporations of trades now appointed twenty-six individuals, in
  addition to the provosts, to decide on measures adapted to carry out the
  resolution. This committee decided "that one religion alone should be taught
  in the town for the future and for ever after;" and that "if any opposition
  was offered by the magistrates, the whole body of the citizens should be
  appealed to."[68]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[68] Kerssenbroeck, p. 209.</p>

  <p>These decisions were presented to the senate on the 11th July, which
  replied that they were willing not to separate themselves from evangelical
  truth, but that they were not yet satisfied on which side it was to be found,
  and that they would ask the bishop to send them learned theologians who
  should investigate the matter.</p>

  <p>This reply irritated Rottmann, Knipperdolling, and their followers. On the
  12th July fresh messengers were sent to the Rath (senate) to know whether it
  might be reckoned upon. The answer was equivocal. A third deputation insisted
  on an answer of "Yes" or "No," and threatened a general rising of the people
  unless their demands were acceded to.[69] The magistrates, in alarm, promised
  their adhesion to the wishes of the insurgents, who demanded at once that
  "sincere preachers of the pure Gospel" should be installed in every church of
  Münster. The councillors accordingly issued orders to all the clergy of the
  city to adopt the articles of Bernard Rottmann, or to refute them by
  scriptural arguments, or they must expect the Council to proceed against them
  with the extremest rigour of the law.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[69] <i>Ibid.</i> pp. 210, 211.</p>

  <p>Then, to place the seal on their cowardly conduct, they wrote to the
  prince-bishop on the 25th, to excuse themselves of complicity in the
  institution of Rottmann, but at the same time they undertook the defence of
  the Reformer, and assured the bishop that his doctrine was sound and
  irrefutable. At the same time they opened a communication with the Landgrave
  Philip of Hesse, asking that bulwark of the Reformation to protect them.
  Philip wrote back, promising his intervention, but warning them not to make
  the Gospel an excuse for revolt and disorder, and not to imagine that
  Christian liberty allowed them to seize on all the property of the Church. At
  the same time he wrote to the prince-bishop to urge upon him not to deprive
  the good and simple people of Münster of their evangelical preachers.[70]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[70] Kerssenbroeck, pp. 213-23.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the seditious members of the town guilds grew impatient;
  and on the 6th August they sent a deputation to the town council reminding it
  of its promise, and insisting on the immediate deprivation of all the
  Catholic clergy. The magistrates sought to gain time, but the deputation
  threatened them with the people taking the law into their own hands,
  rejecting the authority of the council, and electing another set of
  magistrates.</p>

  <p>"The Rath, on hearing this," says Kerssenbroeck, "were filled with alarm,
  and they considered it expedient to yield, in part at least, to the populace,
  and to deprive the clergy of their rights, rather than to expose themselves
  rashly to the greatest dangers."[71]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[71] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 272.</p>

  <p>They resolved therefore to forbid the Catholic clergy the use of the
  pulpits of the churches, and to address the people in any form. This was done
  at once, and all ceremonies "contrary to the pure word of God" were
  abolished, and the faithful in the different parishes were required to
  receive and maintain the new pastors commissioned by the burgomaster and
  corporation to minister to them in things divine.</p>

  <p>On the 10th August, a crowd, headed by Rottmann, the preacher Brixius, and
  Knipperdolling, fell upon the churches and completed the work of devastation
  which had been begun in February. The Cathedral and the Church of Ueberwasser
  alone escaped their Vandalism, because the fanatics were afraid of arousing
  too strong an opposition. The same day the celebration of mass and communion
  in one kind were forbidden under the severest penalties; the priests were
  driven out of their churches, and Rottmann, Brixius, Glandorp, Rolle,
  Wertheim, and Gottfried Ninnhoven, Lutheran preachers, were intruded in their
  room.[72]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[72] <i>Ibid.</i> pp. 228-34.</p>

  <p>The peace among these new apostles of the true Gospel was, however,
  subject to danger. Pastor Brixius had fallen in love with the sister of
  Pastor Rottmann, and the appearance of the girl proved to every one that the
  lovers had not waited for the ceremony of marriage. Rottmann insisted on this
  brother pastor marrying the young woman to repair the scandal. But no sooner
  was the bride introduced into the parsonage of St. Martin, of which Brixius
  was in possession, than the first wife of the evangelical minister arrived in
  Münster with her two children. Brixius was obliged to send away the new wife,
  but a coldness ensued between him and Rottmann; "however, fearing to cause
  dissension amongst their adherents by an open quarrel, they came to some
  arrangement, and Brixius retained his situation."[73]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[73] Kerssenbroeck, pp. 228, 229.</p>

  <p>These acts of violence and scandals had inspired many of the citizens with
  alarm. Those who were able sent their goods out of the town; the nuns of
  Ueberwasser despatched their title-deeds and sacred vessels to a place of
  safety. Several of the wealthy citizens and senators, who would not give up
  their religion, deserted Münster, and settled elsewhere. The two
  burgomasters, Ebroin Drost and Willebrand Plonies, resigned their offices and
  left the city never to return.[74] The provosts of the guilds next insisted
  on the severe repression of all Catholic usages and the performance of
  sacraments by the priests; they went further, and insisted on belief in the
  sacrifice of the altar and adoration of the Host being made penal. The clergy
  wrote to the bishop imploring his aid, and assuring him that their position
  was daily becoming more intolerable; but Francis of Waldeck recommended
  patience, and promised his aid when it lay in his power to assist them.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[74] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 230.</p>

  <p>On the 17th September, 1532, he convoked the nobles of the principality at
  Wollbeck, gave them an account of the condition of Münster, and conjured them
  to assist him in suppressing the rebellion.[75] The nobles replied, that
  before adopting violent measures, it would be advisable to attempt a
  reconciliation. Eight commissioners were chosen from amongst the barons, who
  wrote to the magistrates, and requested them to send their deputies to
  Wollbeck on Monday, September 23rd, "so as to come to some decision on what
  is necessary for the welfare of the republic." The envoys of the city
  appeared, and after the opening of the assembly, the grand marshal of the
  diocese described the condition of the city, and declared that if it pursued
  its course of disobedience, the nobility were prepared to assist their prince
  in re-establishing order. The delegates were given eight days to frame an
  answer. The agitation in Münster during these days was great. The evangelical
  preachers lost no time in exciting the people. The deputies returned to the
  conference with a vague answer that the best way to settle the differences
  would be to submit them to competent and enlightened judges; and so the
  matter dropped.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[75] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 248 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>The bishop's officers now captured a herd of fat cattle belonging to some
  citizens of Münster, which were on their way to Cologne, and refused to
  surrender them till the preachers of disaffection were sent away.[76]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[76] Kerssenbroeck, pp. 268-9.</p>

  <p>The party of Rottmann and Knipperdolling now required the town council to
  raise 500 soldiers for the defence of the town, should it be attacked by the
  prince-bishop&mdash;to strike 2000 ducats in copper for the payment of the
  mercenaries, such money to circulate in Münster alone&mdash;to order the
  sentinels to forbid egress to the Catholic clergy, should they attempt to
  fly&mdash;and to impose on the Catholic clergy a tax of 4000 florins a month
  for the support of the troops. As the clergy had been deprived of their
  benefices, forbidden to preach and minister the sacraments, this additional
  act of persecution was intolerable in its injustice. The senate accepted
  these requisitions with some abatement&mdash;the number of soldiers was
  reduced to 300.[77]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[77] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 279 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>The bishop, finding that the confiscation of the oxen had not produced the
  required results, adopted another expedient which proved equally ineffectual.
  He closed all the roads by his cavalry, declared the city in a state of
  blockade, and forbade the peasantry taking provisions into Münster. The
  artizans then marched out and took the necessary food; they paid for it, but
  threatened the peasants with spoliation without repayment, unless they
  frequented the market with their goods as usual. This menace produced its
  effect; Münster continued to be provisioned as before.[78]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[78] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 283 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>Proud of their success, the innovators attacked Ueberwasser Church, and
  ordered the abbess to dismiss the Catholic clergy who ministered there, and
  to replace them by Gospel preachers. She declined peremptorily, and the mob
  then drove the priests out of the church and presbytery, and instituted
  Lutherans in their place.[79]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[79] <i>Ibid.</i> pp. 284, 285.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the decrees of the senate, the priests continued their
  exhortations and their ministrations in such churches as the Evangelicals
  were unable to supply with pastors, of whom there was a lack. Brixius, the
  bigamist minister of St. Martin's, having found in one of them a monk
  preaching to a crowd of women, rushed up into the pulpit, crying out that the
  man was telling them lies; "but," says Kerssenbroeck, "the devotees
  surrounded the unfortunate orator, beat him with their fists, slippers,
  wooden shoes and staves, so that he fled the church, his face and body black
  and blue." Probably these women bore him a grudge also for his treatment of
  Rottmann's sister, which was no secret. "Furious at this, he went next day to
  exhibit the traces of the combat to the senate, entreating them to revenge
  the outrage he had received&mdash;he a minister of the Holy Gospel; but, for
  the first time, the magistrates showed some sense, and declared that they
  would not meddle in the matter, because the guilty persons were too numerous,
  and that some indulgence ought to be shown to the fair sex."[80]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[80] Kerssenbroeck, p. 330.</p>

  <p>The town council now sent deputies to the Protestant princes, Dukes Ernest
  and Francis of Lüneburg, the Landgrave Philip of Hesse, and Count Philip of
  Waldeck, brother of the prince-bishop, to promise the adhesion of the city to
  the Smalkald union, and to request their assistance against their bishop. The
  situation was singular. The city sought assistance of the Protestant union
  against their prince, desiring to overthrow his power, under the plea that he
  was a Catholic bishop. And the bishop, at heart a Lutheran, and utterly
  indifferent to his religious position and responsibilities, was determined to
  coerce his subjects into obedience, that he might retain his rank and revenue
  as prince, intending, when the city returned to its obedience, to shake off
  his episcopal office, to Lutheranize his subjects, and remain their sovereign
  prince, and possibly transform the ecclesiastical into a hereditary
  principality, the appanage of a family of which he would be the founder. He
  had already provided himself with a concubine, Anna Pölmann, by whom he had
  children.</p>

  <p>Whilst the senate was engaged in treating with the Protestant princes,
  negotiations continued with the bishop, at the diets convoked successively at
  Dulmen and Wollbeck, but they were as fruitless as before. The deputies
  separated on the 9th December, agreeing to meet again on the 21st of the same
  month.</p>

  <p>At this time there arrived in Münster a formal refutation of the theses of
  Rottmann, by John of Deventer, provincial of the Franciscans at Cologne.[81]
  The magistrates had repeatedly complained that "the refusal of the Catholics
  to reply to Bernard Rottmann was the sole cause of all the evil." At the same
  time they had forbidden the Catholic clergy to preach or to make use of the
  press in Münster. This answer came like a surprise upon them. It was carried
  by the foes of the clergy to the magistrates. The news of the appearance of
  this counterblast created the wildest excitement. "The citizens, assembled in
  great crowds, ran about the streets to hear what was being said. Some
  announced that the victory would remain with Rottmann, others declared that
  he would never recover the blow."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[81] Kerssenbroeck, p. 332.</p>

  <p>The provosts of the guilds hastily drew up a petition to the senate to
  expel the clergy from the town, and to confiscate their goods; but the
  magistrates refused to comply with this requisition, which would have at once
  stirred up civil war.[82]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[82] <i>Ibid.</i> pp. 335-7.</p>

  <p>Rottmann mounted the pulpit on St. Andrew's day, and declared that on the
  following Sunday he would refute the arguments of John of Deventer.
  Accordingly, on the day appointed, he preached to an immense crowd, taking
  for his text the words of St. Paul (Rom. xiii. 12), "The night is far spent,
  the day is at hand." The sermon was not an answer to the arguments of John of
  Deventer, but a furious attack upon the Pope and Catholicism. Knipperdolling
  also informed the people that he would rather have his children killed and
  cooked and served up for dinner than surrender his evangelical principles and
  return to the errors of the past.[83]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[83] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 338.</p>

  <p>On the 21st December, 1532, Francis of Waldeck assembled the diet of the
  principality, and asked its advice as to the advisability of proclaiming war
  against Münster, should the city persist in its obstinacy.[84] The clergy and
  nobles replied that, according to immemorial custom, the prince must engage
  in war at his own cost, and that they were too heavily burdened with taxes
  for the Turkish war to enable them to undertake fresh charges. Francis of
  Waldeck reminded them that he was obliged to pay a pension of 2000 florins to
  his predecessor, Frederick von Wied, and he affirmed that he also was not in
  a condition to have recourse to arms.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[84] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 340 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>Whilst the prince, his barons and canons were deliberating, Rottmann had
  assumed the ecclesiastical dictatorship in the cathedral city, and had
  ordered, on his sole authority, the suppression of the observance of
  fast-days.</p>

  <p>The spirit of opposition and protestation that had been evoked already
  manifested itself in strange excesses. "Some of the Evangelicals refused to
  have the bread put into their mouths at Communion," says Kerssenbroeck, "but
  insisted on helping themselves from the table, or they stained themselves in
  taking long draughts at the large chalices. It is even said that some placed
  the bread in large soup tureens, and poured the wine upon it, and took it out
  with spoons and forks, so that they might communicate in both kinds at one
  and the same moment."[85]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[85] Kerssenbroeck, p. 347.</p>

  <p>The Reformer of Münster began to entertain and to express doubts as to the
  validity of the baptism of infants, which he considered had not the warrant
  of Holy Scripture. Melancthon wrote urgently to him, imploring him not to
  create dissensions in the Evangelical Church by disturbing the arrangement
  many wise men had agreed upon. "We have enemies enough," added Melancthon;
  "they will be rejoiced to see us tearing each other and destroying one
  another.... I speak with good intention, and I take the liberty of giving my
  advice, because I am devoted to you and to the Church."[86]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[86] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 348.</p>

  <p>Luther wrote as well, not to Rottmann, but to the magistrates of Münster,
  praising their love of the Gospel, and urging them to beware of being drawn
  away by the damnable errors of the Sacramentarians, Zwinglians, <i>aliorumque
  schwermerorum</i>.[87] The senators received this apostolic epistle with the
  utmost respect and reverence imaginable; they communicated it to Rottmann and
  his colleagues, and ordered them to obey it. But the senate had long lost its
  authority; and this injunction was disregarded.[88] "Disorder and infidelity
  made progress; the idle, rogues, spendthrifts, thieves, and ruined persons
  swelled the crowd of Evangelists."[89]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[87] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 349.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[88] Kerssenbroeck, p. 351.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[89] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 351.</p>

  <p>However, it was not enough to have introduced the new religion, to satisfy
  the Evangelicals the Catholics must be completely deprived of the exercise of
  their religion. In spite of every hindrance, mass had been celebrated every
  Sunday in the cathedral. All the parish churches had been deprived of their
  priests, but the minster remained in the hands of the Catholics. As Christmas
  approached, many men and women prepared by fasting, alms, and confession, to
  make their communion at the cathedral on the festival of the Nativity.</p>

  <p>The magistrates, hearing of their design, forbade them communicating,
  offering, as an excuse, that it would cause scandal to the partisans of the
  Reform. They also published a decree forbidding baptisms to be performed
  elsewhere than in the parish churches; so as to force the faithful to bring
  their children to the ministrations of men whom they regarded with aversion
  as heretics and apostates.[90]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[90] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 353.</p>

  <p>No envoys from the capital attended the reunion of the chambers at
  Wollbeck on the 20th December. But Münster sent a letter expressing a hope
  that the difference between the city and the prince might be terminated by
  mediation.</p>

  <p>This letter gave the diet a chance of escaping from its very difficult
  position of enforcing the rule of the prince without money to pay the
  soldiers. The diet undertook to lay the suggestion before the prince-bishop,
  and to transmit his reply to the envoys of Münster.</p>

  <p>Francis of Waldeck then quitted his diocese of Minden, and betook himself
  to Telgte,[91] a little town about four miles from Münster, where he was to
  receive the oath of allegiance and homage of his subjects in the
  principality. The estates assembled at Wollbeck, and all the leading nobles
  and clergy of the diocese hastened to Telgte and assembled around their
  sovereign on the same day. A letter was at once addressed to the senate of
  Münster by the assembled estates, urging it to send deputies to Telgte, the
  following morning, at eight o'clock, to labour together with them at the
  re-establishment of peace.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[91] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 354 <i>et seq.</i> Sleidan, French
  tr. p. 407.</p>

  <p>The deputies did not appear; the senate addressed to the diet, instead, a
  letter of excuses. The estates at once replied that in the interest of peace,
  they regretted the obstinacy with which the senate had refused to send
  deputies to Telgte; but that this had not prevented them from supplicating
  the bishop to yield to their wishes; and that they were glad to announce that
  he was ready to submit the mutual differences to the arbitration of two
  princes of the Empire, one to be named by himself, the other by the city of
  Münster. And until the arbitration took place, the prince-bishop would
  provisionally suspend all measures of severity, on condition that the ancient
  usages should be restored in the churches, the preachers should cease to
  innovate, and that the imprisoned vassals of the bishop should be
  released.</p>

  <p>This missive was sent into the town on the 25th; the magistrates
  represented to the bearer "that it would be scandalous to occupy themselves
  with temporal affairs on Christmas-day," and on this pretext they persuaded
  him to remain till the morrow in Münster. Then orders were given for the
  gates of the town to be closed, and egress to be forbidden to every one.</p>

  <p>Having taken these precautions, the magistrates assembled the provosts of
  the guilds, and held with them a conference, which terminated shortly before
  nine o'clock the same evening; after which the subaltern officers of the
  senate were sent round to rap at every door, and order the citizens to
  assemble at midnight, before the town-hall. A nocturnal expedition had been
  resolved upon; but the movement in the town had excited the alarm of the
  Catholics, who, thinking that a general massacre of those who adhered to the
  old religion was in contemplation, hid themselves in drains and cellars and
  chimneys.</p>

  <p>Arms were brought out of the arsenal, cannons were mounted, waggons were
  laden with powder, shot, beams, planks and ladders. At the appointed hour,
  the crowd, armed in various fashions, assembled before the Rath-haus.[92] The
  magistrates and provosts then selected six hundred trusty Evangelicals, and
  united them to a band of three hundred mercenaries and a small troop of
  horse. The rest were dispersed upon the ramparts and were recommended to keep
  watch; then it was announced to the party in marching order that they were to
  hasten stealthily to Telgte and capture the prince-bishop, his councillors,
  the barons, and all the members of the estates then assembled in that little
  town.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[92] Kerssenbroeck, p. 358 <i>et seq.</i> Sleidan, French
  tr. p. 408. Sleidan also gives the number as 900; Dorpius, f. 392 b.</p>

  <p>However, the diet, surprised at not seeing their messenger return,
  conceived a slight suspicion. Whether he feared that his person was in danger
  so near Münster is not known, but fortunately for himself, the prince, that
  same evening, left Telgte for his castle of Iburg. The members of the diet,
  after long waiting, sent some men along the road to the capital to ascertain
  whether their messenger was within sight. These men returned, saying that the
  gates of Münster were closed and that no one was to be seen stirring.</p>

  <p>The fact was singular, not to say suspicious, and a troop of horse was
  ordered to make a reconnaissance in the direction of Münster. It was already
  late at night, so, having given the order, the members of the diet retired to
  their beds. The horse soldiers beat the country, found all quiet, withdrew
  some planks from a bridge over the Werse, between Telgte and Münster, to
  intercept the passage, and then returned to their quarters, for the night was
  bitterly cold. On surmounting a hill, crowned by a gibbet, they, however,
  turned once more and looked over the plain towards the city. A profound
  silence reigned; but a number of what they believed to be will-o'-the-wisps
  flitted here and there over the dark ground. As, according to popular
  superstition in Westphalia, these little lights are to be seen in great
  abundance at Yuletide, the horsemen paid no attention to them, but continued
  their return. These lights, mistaken for marsh fires, were in fact the
  burning matches of the arquebuses carried by those engaged in the sortie. On
  their return to Telgte, the horse soldiers retired to their quarters, and in
  half-an-hour all the inhabitants of the town were fast asleep.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the men of Münster advanced, replaced the bridge over the
  Werse, traversed the plain, and reached Telgte at two o'clock in the morning.
  They at once occupied all the streets, according to a plan concerted
  beforehand, then invaded the houses, and captured the members of the diet,
  clergy, nobles and commons. Three only of the cathedral chapter escaped in
  their night shirts with bare feet across the frozen river Ems. The
  Münsterians, having laid their hands on all the money, jewels, seals, and
  gold chains they could find, retreated as rapidly as they had advanced,
  carrying off with them their captives and the booty, but disappointed in not
  having secured the person of the prince. They entered the cathedral city in
  triumph on the morning of the 26th December, highly elated at their success,
  and nothing doubting that with such hostages in their hands, they would be
  able to dictate their own terms to the sovereign.</p>

  <p>But the expedition of Telgte had made a great sensation in the empire.
  Francis of Waldeck addressed himself to all the members of the Germanic body,
  and appealed especially to his metropolitan, the Elector of Cologne, for
  assistance, and also to the Dukes of Cleves and Gueldres. The elector wrote
  at once to Münster in terms the most pressing, because some of his own
  councillors were among the prisoners. He received an evasive answer. The
  Protestant princes of the Smalkald league even addressed letters to the
  senate, blaming energetically their high-handed proceeding. Philip Melancthon
  also wrote a letter of mingled remonstrance and entreaty.[93] The only result
  of their appeals was the restoration to the prisoners of their money and the
  jewels taken from them.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[93] Kerssenbroeck, p. 368.</p>

  <p>John von Wyck, syndic of Bremen, was despatched by the senate of Münster
  to the Landgrave Philip of Hesse, to ask him to undertake the office of
  mediator between them and their prince. The Landgrave readily accepted the
  invitation, and Francis of Waldeck was equally ready to admit his mediation,
  as he was himself, as has been already stated, a Lutheran at heart. The
  people of Münster, finding that the bishop was eager for a pacific
  settlement, insisted on the payment of the value of the oxen he had
  confiscated, as a preliminary, before the subject of differences was entered
  upon. The prince-bishop consented, paid 450 florins, and allowed the
  Landgrave of Hesse to draw up sixteen articles of treaty, which met with the
  approval of both the senate and himself.</p>

  <p>The terms of the agreement were as follows:[94]&mdash;</p>

  <p>I. The prince-bishop was to offer no violence to the inhabitants of
  Münster in anything touching religion. "The people of Münster shall keep the
  pure Word of God," said the article; "it shall be preached to them, without
  any human additions by their preachers, in the six parish churches. These
  same preachers shall minister the sacraments and order their services and
  ceremonies as they please. The citizens shall submit in religious matters to
  the judgment of the magistrates alone, till the questions at issue are
  decided by a General Council."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[94] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 392 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>II. The Catholics were to exercise their religion freely in the cathedral
  and in the capitular churches not included in the preceding article, <i>until
  Divine Providence should order otherwise</i>. The Lutheran ministers were
  forbidden to attack the Catholics, their dogmas and rights, <i>unless the
  Word of God imperiously required it</i>;&mdash;a clause opening a door to any
  amount of abuse. As the speciality of Protestantism of every sort consists in
  negation, it would be impossible for an Evangelical pastor to hold his
  position without denouncing what he disbelieved.</p>

  <p>Article III. interdicted mutual recriminations. Article IV., in strange
  contradiction with Article I., declared that the town of Münster should obey
  the prince-bishop as legitimate sovereign in matters spiritual and temporal.
  The bishop in the Vth Article promised to respect the privileges of the
  subject.</p>

  <p>The VIth Article forbade any one making an arbitrary use of the Word of
  God to justify refusal of obedience to the magistrates. Article VII. reserved
  to the clergy their revenues, with the exception of the six parish churches,
  of which the revenues were to be employed for the maintenance of the
  Evangelical pastors. By the VIIIth Article the senate promised not to
  interfere with the collation to benefices not in their hands by right. The
  IXth Article allowed the citizens to deprive their pastors in the Lutheran
  churches, without the intervention of the bishop. The rest of the Articles
  secured a general amnesty, permission to the refugees to return, and to the
  imprisoned members of the diet to obtain their freedom.</p>

  <p>This treaty was fair enough in its general provisions. If, as was the
  case, a large number of the citizens were disposed to adopt Lutheranism, no
  power on earth had any right to constrain them, and they might justly claim
  the free exercise of their religion. But there were suspicious clauses
  inserted in the 1st and 2nd Articles which pointed to the renewal of
  animosity and the re-opening of the whole question.</p>

  <p>This treaty was signed on the 14th February, 1533, by Philip of Hesse, as
  mediator, Francis, Count of Waldeck, Prince and Bishop of Münster, the
  members of chapter, the representatives of the nobles of the principality,
  and the burgomasters and senators of Münster, together with those of the
  towns of Coesfeld and Warendorf, in their own name and in behalf of the other
  towns of the diocese. The captive estates were liberated on the 18th
  February. How the magistrates and town kept the other requirements of the
  treaty we shall soon see.</p>

  <p>The senate having been constituted supreme authority in spiritual things
  by the Lutheran party, now undertook the organisation of the Evangelical
  Church in the city; and a few days after the treaty had been signed, it
  published an "Evangelical Constitution," consisting of ten articles, for the
  government of the new Church.[95]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[95] Kerssenbroeck, p. 398 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>The 8th article had a threatening aspect. "The ministers of the Divine
  Word shall use their utmost endeavours to gain souls to the true faith, and
  to direct them in the ways of perfection. <i>As for those who shall refuse to
  accept the pure doctrine</i>, and those who shall blaspheme and be guilty of
  public crimes, the senate will employ against them all the rigour of the
  laws, and the sword of justice."</p>

  <p>Rottmann was appointed by the magistrates Superintendent of the Lutheran
  Church in Münster, a function bearing a certain resemblance to that of a
  bishop.[96] Then, thinking that a bishop should be the husband of one wife at
  least, Rottmann married the widow of Johann Vigers, late syndic of Münster.
  "She was a person of bad character," says Kerssenbroeck, "whom Rottmann had
  inspired during her husband's life with Evangelical principles and an
  adulterous love."[97] It is asserted, with what truth it is impossible at
  this distance of time to decide, that Vigers was drowned in his bath at Ems,
  in a fit, and that his wife allowed him to perish without attempting to save
  him. Anyhow, no sooner was he dead, than she returned full speed to Münster
  and married her lover.[98]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[98] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 404.</p>

  <p>The reformer and his adherents had been given their own way, and the
  senate hoped they would rest satisfied, and that tranquillity would be
  re-established in the city. But their hopes were doomed to disappointment.
  Certain people, if given an inch, insist on taking an ell; of these people
  Rottmann was one. Excited by him, the Evangelicals of the town complained
  that the magistrates had treated the Papists with too great leniency, that
  the clergy had not been expelled and their goods confiscated according to the
  original programme. It was decided tumultuously that the elections must be
  anticipated; and on the 3rd March, the people deposed the magistrates and
  elected in their room the leaders of the extreme reforming party.[99]
  Knipperdolling was of their number; only four of the former magistrates were
  allowed to retain office, and these were men whom they could trust. Hermann
  Tilbeck and Kaspar Judenfeld were named burgomasters; Heinrich Modersohn and
  Heinrich Redekker were chosen provosts or tribunes of the people.[100]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[99] Kerssenbroeck, p. 404.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[100] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 405.</p>

  <p>Next to the senate came the turn of the parishes. On the 17th March, under
  the direction of Rottmann, the people proceeded to appoint the ministers to
  the churches in the town. Their choice was not happy; it fell on those most
  unqualified to exercise a salutary influence, and restrain the excitement of
  a mob already become nearly ungovernable.[101]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[101] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 406.</p>

  <p>The new senate endeavoured to strengthen the Evangelical cause by uniting
  the other towns of the diocese in a common bond of resistance. They invited
  these towns to send their deputies to meet those of the capital at a little
  inn between Münster and Coesfeld, on the 20th March. The assembly took place;
  but so far from the other cities agreeing to support Münster, their deputies
  read those of the capital a severe lecture, and refused to throw off their
  old religion and their allegiance to the bishop.[102]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[102] Kerssenbroeck, p. 407 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>On the 24th March, 1533, the burgomaster Tilbeck, accompanied by the
  citizen Kerbink, went to Ueberwasser, summoned the abbess before him, and
  ordered her to maintain at the expense of the abbey the preachers lately
  appointed to the church in connection with the convent. She was forced to
  submit.[103]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[103] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 413.</p>

  <p>On the 27th of the same month one of the preachers invaded the church of
  St. Ledger, still in the hands of the Catholics, at the head of his
  congregation, broke open the tabernacle, drew out the Host, broke it, and
  blowing the fragments into the air, screamed to the assembled multitude,
  "Look at your good God flying away."</p>

  <p>The same day the treaty was violated towards the Franciscans. Some of the
  senators ordered them to quit their convent, their habit, and their order,
  unless they desired still more rigorous treatment, "because the magistrates
  were resolved to make the Church flourish again in her ancient purity, and
  because they wanted to convert the convent into a school."[104]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[104] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 413.</p>

  <p>The superior replied that he and his brethren followed strictly the rule
  of their founder, and that this house belonged to them by right of
  succession, and that they were no charge to the town. He said that if a
  building was needed for an Evangelical school, he was ready to surrender to
  the magistrates a portion of the convent buildings; all he asked in return
  was that he and his brethren should be allowed to live in tranquillity. This
  proposal saved the Franciscans for a time. The Evangelical school was
  established in their convent, "but at the end of a month it had fallen into
  complete disorder, whereas the old Papist school had not lost one of its
  pupils, and was as flourishing as ever."[105]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[105] Kerssenbroeck, p. 415.</p>

  <p>Whilst the senators menaced the monasteries, Knipperdolling and his friend
  Gerhardt Kibbenbroeck pillaged the church of S. Lambert. Scarcely a day now
  passed without some fresh act of violence done to the Catholics, or Vandalism
  perpetrated on the churches.</p>

  <p>On the 5th April the prior and monks of Bispinkhoff were forbidden by the
  magistrates to hear confessions in their own church. The same day the
  Lutherans broke the altar and images in the church of Ueberwasser, and
  scraped the paintings off the walls.</p>

  <p>On Palm Sunday, April 6th,[106] at Ueberwasser, some of the nuns, urged by
  the preachers in their church, cast off their vows, and joining the people,
  chanted the 7th verse of the 124th Psalm according to Luther's
  translation&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Der Strich ist entzwei, Und wir sind frei."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[106] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 416.</p>

  <p>"The snare is broken, and we are delivered;" and then they received
  Communion with the pastors.</p>

  <p>On the 7th the mob pillaged the church of the Servites, and defaced it.
  Next day the Franciscans, who had made the wafers for the Holy Sacrament for
  the churches in the diocese, were forbidden to make them any more. On the 9th
  Knipperdolling, heading a party of the reformed, broke into the cathedral
  during the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, rushed up to the altar, and
  drove away the priest, exclaiming, "Greedy fop, haven't you eaten enough good
  Gods yet?" Two days later the magistrates ordered the chapter to surrender
  into their hands their title deeds and sacred vessels. On the 14th, Belkot,
  head of the city tribunal of Münster, entered the church of S. Ledger, and
  carried off all its chalices, patens, and ciboriums, whilst others who
  accompanied him destroyed the altars, paintings, and statuary, and profaned
  the church in the most disgusting manner. The unhappy Catholics, unable to
  resist, uttered loud lamentations, and did not refrain from calling the
  perpetrators of the outrage "robbers and sacrilegious," for which they were
  summoned before the magistrates, and threatened with imprisonment unless they
  apologised.[107]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[107] Kerssenbroeck 417.</p>

  <p>As the news of the conversion of the city of Münster to the Gospel spread,
  strangers came to it from all parts, to hear and to learn, as they gave out,
  pure Evangelical truth.</p>

  <p>Amongst these adventurers was a man destined to play a terribly prominent
  part in the great drama that was about to be enacted at Münster. This was
  John Bockelson, a tailor, a native of Leyden, in Holland. He had quitted his
  country and his wife secretly to hear Rottmann. He entered Münster on the
  25th July, and lodged with a citizen named Hermann Ramers. Having been
  instructed in the Gospel according to Luther, he went to preach in Osnabrück,
  but from thence he was driven. He then returned to his own home. There he
  became an Anabaptist, under the instruction of John Matthisson, who sent him
  with Gerrit Buchbinder as apostles of the sect to Westphalia in the month of
  November, 1533.</p>

  <p>The time had now arrived when the Lutheran party, which had so
  tyrannically treated the Catholics in the city of Münster, was itself to be
  despotically put down and trampled upon by a sect which sprang from its own
  womb.</p>

  <p>Rottmann had for some while been wavering in his adhesion to
  Lutheranism.[108] He doubted first, and then disbelieved in the Real
  Presence, which Luther insisted upon. He thought that the reformation of the
  Wittenberg doctor was not sufficiently thoroughgoing in the matter of
  ceremonial; then he doubted the scriptural authority for the baptism of
  infants. Two preachers, Heinrich Rott and Herman Strapedius, fell in with his
  views. The former had been a monk at Haarlem, but had become a Lutheran
  preacher. He regarded the baptism of infants as one of those things which are
  indifferent to salvation. Strapedius was more decided; he preached against
  infant baptism as an abomination in the sight of God. He was named by the
  people preacher at S. Lambert's, the head church of the city, in spite of the
  opposition of the authorities.[109]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[108] Kerssenbroeck, p. 429 <i>et seq.</i>; Sleidan,
  French tr. p. 409; Bullinger, "Adv. Anabapt.," 116, ii. c. 8.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[109] Kerssenbroeck, pp. 431, 432; Dorp., f. 322-3.</p>

  <p>The Lutheran senate of Münster, which a few months previously had been
  elected enthusiastically by the people, now felt that before these fiery
  preachers, drifting into Anabaptism, their power was in as precarious a
  position as was that of those whom they had supplanted. Alarmed at the rapid
  extension of the new forms of disbelief, they twice forbade Rottmann to
  preach against the baptism of infants and the Real Presence, and ordered him
  to conform in his teaching to authorised Lutheran doctrine. He treated their
  orders with contempt. Then they summoned him before them: he appeared, but on
  leaving the Rath-haus, preached in the square to the people with redoubled
  violence.</p>

  <p>The senate, at their wits' end, ordered a public discussion between
  Rottmann and the orthodox Lutherans, represented by Hermann Busch. The
  discussion took place before the city Rath, and the senate decided that Busch
  had gained the day, and they therefore forbade all innovation in the
  administration of baptism and the Lord's Supper.</p>

  <p>Rottmann and his colleague disregarded the monition, and continued their
  sermons against the rags of Popery which still disfigured the Lutheran
  Church. Several of the ministers in the town, whether from conviction or from
  interest, finding that their congregations drained away to the churches where
  the stronger-spiced doctrine was preached, joined the movement. It was simply
  a carrying of negation beyond the pillars of Hercules planted by Luther.
  Luther had denied of the sum total of Catholic dogmas, say ten, and had
  retained ten. The Anabaptist denied two more, and retained only eight. On the
  10th August a tumultuous scene took place in the church of S. Giles.[110] A
  Dutch preacher began declaiming against baptism of children. Johann
  Windemoller, ex-senator, a vehement opponent of Anabaptist disintegration of
  Lutheran doctrine, who was in the congregation, rushed up the pulpit stairs,
  and pulled the preacher down, exclaiming, "Scoundrel! how dare you take upon
  you the office of preacher&mdash;you who, a few years ago, were thrust into
  the iron-collar, and branded on the cheek for your crimes? Do you think I do
  not know your antecedents? You talk of virtue, you gibbet-bird? You who are
  guilty of so many crimes and impieties? Go along with you, take your doctrine
  and your brand elsewhere."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[110] Kerssenbroeck, p. 434.</p>

  <p>Windemoller was about to turn the pastor out of the church, when a number
  of women, who had joined the Anabaptist party, fell, howling, upon
  Windemoller, crying that he wanted to deprive them of the saving Gospel and
  Word of Truth, and they would have strangled him had he not beat a
  precipitate retreat. The same afternoon, some citizens who brought their
  children to this church to be baptized were driven from the doors with shouts
  of derision.</p>

  <p>The magistrates played a trump card, and ordered Rottmann to leave the
  town, together with the ministers who followed his teaching.[111] Bernard
  Rottmann replied much in the same strain as he had answered the bishop,
  stating that his doctrine was strictly conformable to the pure word of God,
  and that he demanded a public discussion, in which his doctrines might be
  tested by Scripture alone, without human additions. Finally he protested that
  he would not abstain from preaching, nor desert his flock, whether the senate
  persisted in its sentence or not. Five ministers signed this defiant
  letter&mdash;Rottmann, Johann Clopris, Heinrich Roll, Gottfried Strahl, and
  Denis Vinnius. These men at once hastened to collect the heads of the
  corporations and provosts together, and urge them to take their part against
  the Rath. They were quite prepared to do so, and the magistrates yielded on
  condition that Bernard and his following of preachers should abstain from
  speaking on the disputed questions of infant baptism and the Eucharist.
  Rottmann consented, in his own name and in that of his friends, in a paper
  dated October 3rd, 1533.[112] The senate was, however, well aware that its
  power was tottering to its fall, and that the preachers had not the remotest
  intention of fulfilling their engagement. They saw that these men were
  gradually absorbing into themselves the supreme authority in the city, and
  that a magistracy which opposed them could at any moment be by them dismissed
  their office. In alarm they wrote to the prince-bishop, and sent him
  messengers to lay before him the precarious condition of the affairs in the
  capital, imploring him to consider the imminence of the peril, and to send
  them learned theologians who could combat the spread of erroneous doctrine,
  and introduce those conformable to the pure word of God.[113]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[111] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 436.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[112] Kerssenbroeck, pp. 437-9.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[113] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 441.</p>

  <p>It was a singular state of affairs indeed. The magistrates had appealed to
  the pure word of God, as understood by Luther, against Catholicism, and now
  the Anabaptists appealed to the same oracle, with equal confidence against
  Lutheranism; the two parties leaned on the same support&mdash;who was to
  decide which party Scripture upheld?</p>

  <p>The answer of Francis of Waldeck was such as might have been expected from
  a man endowed with some common sense. He reminded the magistrates that it was
  their own fault if things had come to such a pass; he feared that now the
  evil had gained the upper hand, and that gentleness was out of place; a
  decided face could alone secure to the magistrates moral authority. He was
  ready to support them if they would maintain their allegiance for the future.
  He would send them a learned theologian, Dr. Heinrich Mumpert, prior of the
  Franciscans of Bispinkhoff, to preach against error in the cathedral.</p>

  <p>The senate was in a dilemma. They had no wish to return to Catholicism,
  and they dreaded the progress of schism. They stood on an inclined plane.
  Above was the rock of an infallible authority; below, faith shelved into an
  abyss of negation they shrank from fathoming. If they looked back, they saw
  Catholicism; if they looked forward, they beheld the dissolution of all
  positive belief. Like all timorous men they shrank from either alternative,
  and attempted for a little longer to maintain their slippery position. They
  declined the offer of the Catholic doctor, and turned to the Landgrave Philip
  of Hesse for assistance. The Landgrave at once acceded to the request of the
  magistrates, and sent them Theodore Fabricius and Johann Melsinger,
  guaranteeing to their senate their orthodoxy.[114]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[114] Kerssenbroeck, p. 443; Sleidan, p. 410; Dorpius, f.
  393 b.</p>

  <p>While these preachers were on their way, disorder increased in Münster.
  The faction of Rottmann grew apace, and spread into the Convent of
  Ueberwasser, where the nuns were daily compelled to hear the harangues of two
  zealous Evangelical pastors, who exerted themselves strenuously to demolish
  the faith of the sisters down to the point fixed as the limit of negation by
  Luther. But these pastors having become infected with Rottmann's views,
  continued the work of destruction, and lowered the temple of faith two
  additional stages.</p>

  <p>The result of these sermons on the excitable nuns was that the majority
  broke out into revolt, and refused to observe abstinence and practise
  self-mortification; and proclaimed their intention of returning to the world
  and marrying. The bishop wrote to them, imploring them to consider that they
  were all of them members of noble families, and that they must be careful in
  no way to dishonour their families by scandalous behaviour. The mutineers
  seemed disposed to yield, but we shall presently see that their submission
  was only temporary.[115]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[115] Kerssenbroeck, p. 443.</p>

  <p>On the 15th October, the senate wrote to the bishop, and informed him that
  they would not permit the prior Mumpert to preach in the cathedral.[116] They
  acknowledged that according to the treaty of Telgte, the city had consented
  to allow the Catholics the use of the cathedral, "until such time as the Lord
  shall dispose otherwise," but, they said, at the time of the conclusion of
  the treaty, there was no preacher at the minster; which was true, for the
  Catholic clergy had been forbidden the use of the pulpit; and they declared
  that "in all good conscience, they could not permit the institution of one
  whose doctrine and manner of life were not conformable to the gospel."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[116] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 444.</p>

  <p>Francis of Waldeck, without paying attention to this refusal, ordered
  Mumpert to preach and celebrate the Eucharist in the cathedral church, on
  Sunday, 26th October, 1533. The prior obeyed. The fury of the Evangelicals
  was without limits; and in a second letter, more insolent than the first, the
  magistrates told the bishop that "they would not suffer a fanatical friar to
  come and teach error to the people." The bishop's sole reply was a command to
  the prior to continue his course.</p>

  <p>At this moment the learned divines sent by Philip of Hesse arrived in the
  city, and hearing of the sermons in the minster, to which the people flocked,
  and which were likely to produce a counter current in a Catholic direction,
  they insisted, as a preliminary to their mission, that the mouth of the
  Catholic preacher should be stopped. "We pray you," said they to the
  magistrates, "to forbid this man permission to reside in the town, lest our
  pure doctrine be choked by his abominable sermons. An authority claiming to
  be Christian should not tolerate such a scandal."</p>

  <p>The senate hastened to satisfy the Hessian theologians, by not merely
  ordering the Catholic preacher to leave the city, but by outlawing him, so
  that he was obliged in haste to fly a place where his life might be taken by
  any unscrupulous persons with impunity.[117]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[117] Kerssenbroeck, p. 444 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>Francis of Waldeck, justly irritated, wrote to Philip of Hesse,
  remonstrating at the interference of his commissioners in the affairs of
  another man's principality.[118] The Landgrave replied that, so far from
  deserving reproach, he merited thanks for having sent to Münster two divines
  of the first class, who would preach there the pure Word of God, and would
  strangle the monster of Anabaptism. With the outlawry of the Catholic
  preacher, the struggle between Catholicism and Lutheranism closed; the
  struggle for the future was to be between Lutheranism and Anabaptism; a
  struggle desperate on the part of the Lutherans, for what basis had they for
  operation? The Catholics had an intrenched position in the authority of a
  Church, which they claimed to be invested with divine inerrancy, by
  commission from Christ; but the Lutheran and Anabaptist fought over the pages
  of the Bible, each claiming Scripture as on his side. It was a war within a
  camp, to decide which should pitch the other outside the rampart of the
  letter.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[118] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 457 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>Fabricius and Melsinger fought for Infant Baptism and the Real Presence,
  Rottmann and Strapedius against both. "Do you call this the body and blood of
  Christ?" exclaimed Master Bernard one day, whilst he was distributing the
  Sacrament; and flinging it on the ground, he continued, "Were it so, it would
  get up from the ground and mount the altar of itself without my help. Know by
  this that neither the body nor blood of Christ are here."[119]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[119] Dorpius, f. 394.</p>

  <p>Peter Wyrthemius, a Lutheran preacher, was interrupted, when he attempted
  to preach, by the shouts and jeers of the Anabaptists, and was at last driven
  from his pulpit.</p>

  <p>Rottmann kept his promise not to preach Anabaptist doctrine in the pulpit,
  but he printed and circulated a number of tracts and pamphlets, and held
  meetings in private houses for the purpose of disseminating his views.[120]
  His reputation increased rapidly, and extended afar. Disciples came from
  Holland, Brabant, and Friesland, to place themselves under his direction;
  women even confided to him the custody of their children.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[120] Kerssenbroeck, p. 448.</p>

  <p>The most lively anxiety inspired the senate to make another attempt to
  regain their supremacy in the direction of affairs.</p>

  <p>On the 3rd or 4th November, the heads of the guilds and the provosts and
  patricians of the city were assembled to deliberate, and it was resolved that
  Rottmann and his colleagues should be expelled the town and the diocese; and
  to remove from them the excuse that they feared arrest when they quitted the
  walls of Münster, the magistrates obtained for them a safe-conduct, signed by
  the bishop and the upper chapter.[121]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[121] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 449.</p>

  <p>Next day, the magistrates and chief citizens reassembled in the market
  square, and voted that "not only should the Anabaptist preachers be exiled,
  but also those of the magistrates who had supported them; and that this
  sentence should receive immediate execution."[122]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[122] Kerssenbroeck, p. 450 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>This was too sweeping a measure to pass without provoking resistance. The
  burgomaster, Tilbeck, who felt that the blow was aimed at himself, exclaimed,
  angrily: "Is this the reward I receive for having prudently governed the
  republic? But we will not suffer the innocent to be oppressed, and we shall
  treat you in such a manner as will calm your insolence."</p>

  <p>These words gave the signal for an open rupture.</p>

  <p>Knipperdolling and Hermann Krampe, both members of the senate, drew their
  swords and ranged themselves beside the burgomaster, calling the people to
  arms. The mob at once rushed upon the senators. The servants of the chapter
  and the clergy in the cathedral close, hastened carrying arms to the
  assistance of the magistrates. Both parties sought a place of defence, each
  anticipating an attack. The Lutherans occupied the Rath-haus and barricaded
  the doors. The Anabaptists retired behind the strong walls of the cemetery of
  St. Lambert. The night was spent by both parties under arms, and a fight
  appeared imminent on the morrow. Then the syndic Johann von Wyck persuaded
  the frightened senate to moderate their sentence, and hurrying to the
  Anabaptists, he urged them to be reconciled to the magistrates. An agreement
  was finally concluded, whereby Rottmann was forbidden for the future to
  preach, and every one was to be allowed to believe what he liked, and to
  disbelieve what he chose.</p>

  <p>Master Bernard, however, evaded his obligation by holding meetings in
  private houses at night, to which his followers were summoned by the
  discharge of a gun.[123] Considering that it was now necessary that his
  adherents should have their articles of belief, or rather of disbelief, as a
  bond of union and of distinction between themselves and the Lutherans, he
  drew up a profession of faith in nineteen articles. That which he had
  published nine months before was antiquated, and represented the creed of the
  Lutheran faction, against which he was now at variance.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[123] Kerssenbroeck, p. 453 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>This second creed contained the following propositions:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The baptism of children is abominable before God.</p>

  <p>The habitual ceremonies used at baptism are the work of the devil and of
  the Pope, who is Antichrist.</p>

  <p>The consecrated Host is the great Baal.</p>

  <p>A Christian (that is, a member of Rottmann's sect) does not set foot in
  the religious assemblies of the impious (<i>i.e.</i>, of the Catholics and
  Lutherans).</p>

  <p>He holds no communication and has no relations with them; he is not bound
  to obey their authorities; he has nothing in common with their tribunals; nor
  does he unite with them in marriage.</p>

  <p>The Sabbath was instituted by the Lord God, and there is no scriptural
  warrant for transferring the obligation to the Sunday.</p>

  <p>Papists and Lutherans are to be regarded as equally infamous, and those
  who give faith to the inventions of priests are veritable pagans.</p>

  <p>During fourteen centuries there have been no true Christians. Christ was
  the last priest; the apostles did not enjoy the priestly office.</p>

  <p>Jesus Christ did not derive His human nature from Mary.[124]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[124] This is corroborated by the Acta, Handlungen,
  &amp;c., fol. 385. "<i>The Preachers</i>: Do you believe that Christ received
  His flesh off the flesh of Mary, by the operation of the Holy Ghost? <i>John
  of Leyden</i>: No; such is not the teaching of Scripture." And he explained
  that if the flesh had been taken from Mary, it must have been sinful, for she
  was not immaculate.</p>

  <p>Every marriage concluded before re-baptism is invalid.</p>

  <p>Faith in Christ must precede baptism.</p>

  <p>Wives shall call their husbands lords.</p>

  <p>Usury is forbidden.</p>

  <p>The faithful shall possess all things in common.</p>

  <p>The publication of this formulary of faith, if such it may be called,
  which is a string of negative propositions, increased the alarm of the more
  sober citizens, who, feeling the insecurity of property and life under a
  powerless magistracy, prepared to leave the town. Many fled and left their
  Lutheranism behind them. Lening, one of the preachers sent by the Landgrave
  of Hesse, ran away.</p>

  <p>Fabricius had more courage. He preached energetically against Rottmann,
  assisted by Dr. Johann Westermann, a Lutheran theologian of Lippe.[125]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[125] Kerssenbroeck, p. 456; Sleidan, p. 411.</p>

  <p>According to Kerssenbroeck, however, half the town followed by the
  Anabaptist leader, and brought their goods and money to lay them at his feet.
  Those who had nothing of their own, in a body joined the society which
  proclaimed community of goods.</p>

  <p>The bishop again wrote to the magistrates, urging them to permit the
  Catholic preacher, Mumpert, the use of the cathedral pulpit, but the senate
  refused, and continued their vain efforts to build their theological system
  on a slide. At their request, Fabricius and Westermann drew up (November 28,
  1533) a symbol of belief in opposition to that formulated by Rottmann, and it
  was read and adopted by the Lutherans in the Church of St. Lambert. A large
  number of the people gave in their adhesion to this last and newest creed,
  and the magistrates, emboldened thereby, made a descent upon the house of the
  ex-superintendent, and confiscated his private press, with which he had
  printed his tracts.[126]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[126] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 456.</p>

  <p>It was then that the two apostles, Buchbinder and Bockelson, sent by
  Matthisson into Westphalia, appeared in the city. They remained there only
  four days, during which they re-baptised the preachers and several of their
  adepts, and then retired prophesying their speedy return and the advent of
  the reign of grace.</p>

  <p>Rottmann, highly exasperated against Fabricius for having drawn up his
  counter-creed, went on the 30th November to the churchyard of St. Lambert,
  and standing in an elevated situation, preached to the people on his own new
  creed, whilst Fabricius was discoursing within to his congregation on his own
  profession of faith.</p>

  <p>When service was over Fabricius came out, and was immediately attacked by
  Rottmann with injurious expressions, which, however, so exasperated the
  congregation of the Lutheran, that they fell upon the late superintendent of
  the Evangelical Church, and threatened him with their sticks and fists.</p>

  <p>On the 1st December, Fabricius complained in the pulpit of the insult he
  had received, and appealed to the people to judge between his doctrine and
  that of Master Bernard by the difference there was between their respective
  behaviour.[127]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[127] Kerssenbroeck, p. 461.</p>

  <p>A new Anabaptist orator now appeared on the stage; he was a blacksmith's
  apprentice, named Johann Schroeder. On the 8th December he occupied the
  position in the cemetery of St. Lambert from which Rottmann had been forced
  to fly, and defied the Lutherans to oppose him with the pure Word of God. He
  denounced them as still in darkness, as wrapped in the trappings of Popery,
  and as enemies to the Gospel of Christ and Evangelical liberty. Then he dared
  Fabricius to meet him in a public discussion, and prove his doctrine by the
  text of Scripture.[128]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[128] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 461.</p>

  <p>The magistrates resolved on one more attempt to arrest the disorder. On
  the 11th November they informed Rottmann that, unless he immediately left the
  city, they would decree his outlawry. Rottmann sent a message to them in
  reply, "That he would not go; that he was not afraid; and that exile was to
  him an empty word, for, wherever he was, the heavenly Father would cover him
  with His wings." He took no further notice of the order, except only that he
  instituted a bodyguard of armed citizens to accompany him wherever he went.
  On the Sunday following, December 14th, he betook himself, surrounded by his
  guard, to the church of the Servites, where he intended to preach. But
  finding the doors locked, he placed himself under a lime-tree near the
  building and pronounced his discourse, without any one venturing to lay a
  hand upon him.[129]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[129] Kerssenbroeck, p. 163; Dorpius, f. 394 a.</p>

  <p>The magistrates were equally unsuccessful in silencing the blacksmith
  Schroeder. This man, having preached again on the 15th December, was taken by
  the police and thrown into prison. Next day the members of the Blacksmiths'
  Guild marched to the Rath-haus, armed with their hammers and with bars of
  iron, to demand the release of their comrade. A violent dispute arose between
  the senators and the exasperated artisans. The former declared that
  Schroeder, whose trade was to shoe horses and not to preach, had deserved
  death for having incited to sedition. The reply of the blacksmiths was very
  similar to that made by the senate to the bishop when he ordered the
  expulsion of Rottmann. "Schroeder," said they, "has been urged on by love of
  truth, and he has preached with so much zeal that he has made himself hoarse.
  He has been guilty neither of murder nor of any crime worthy of death. How
  dare you maltreat this one who has given edifying instruction to his fellow
  citizens? Must nothing be done without your authorisation?" Upon the heels of
  the arguments came menaces. The senate yielded again, and promised to release
  Schroeder on the morrow.</p>

  <p>"Not to-morrow," shouted the blacksmiths; "restore our comrade to us
  immediately, or we will burst open the prison doors."</p>

  <p>The magistrates bowed to the storm, taking, however, the worse than
  useless precaution of making Schroeder swear, before they knocked off his
  chains, that he would not attempt to revenge on them his captivity.[130]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[130] Kerssenbroeck, p. 464.</p>

  <p>On the 21st December, Rottmann resumed the use of his pulpit in the church
  of the Servites, treating the orders of the senate with supreme contempt.
  Westermann, tired of a struggle with the swelling tide, deserted Münster,
  leaving Fabricius alone to fight against the growing power of the
  Anabaptists.</p>

  <p>The year 1534 opened under gloomy auspices at Münster. In the first few
  days of January, the new sect dealt the Lutherans the same measure these
  latter had dealt the Catholics a twelvemonth before. They invaded their
  churches and disturbed divine worship.</p>

  <p>Fabricius attacked Rottmann violently in a sermon preached on the 4th
  January, and offered to have a public discussion with him on the moot points
  of doctrine. The senate accepted the proposition with transport, but Rottmann
  refused. "Not," said he, "that I am afraid of entering the lists against this
  Lutheran, but that men are so corrupt that they would certainly condemn that
  side which had for its support right and the word of Scripture."[131]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[131] <i>Ibid.</i> pp. 466, 467.</p>

  <p>On the same day that Rottmann sent in his refusal, a band of women
  tumultuously entered the town-hall and demanded that "the miserable foreign
  vagabond Fabricius, who could not even speak the dialect of the country, and
  who, inspired by an evil spirit, preaches all kinds of absurdities in a
  tongue scarcely intelligible, should be driven out of the city. Set in his
  place the worthy Rottmann," said the women; "he is prudent, eloquent,
  instructed in every kind of knowledge, and he can speak our language. Grant
  us this favour, Herrn Burgmeistern, and we will pray God for you." The
  burgomasters requested the ladies not to meddle with matters that concerned
  them not, but to return to their families and kitchens. This invitation drove
  them into a paroxysm of rage, and they shouted at the top of their shrill
  voices: "Here are fine burgomasters! They are neglecting the interests of the
  town! Here are tender fathers of their country who attend to nothing! You are
  worse than murderers, for <i>they</i> kill the body, but
  <i>you</i>assassinate souls by depriving them of the Evangelical Word which
  is their nourishment." The women then retired, but returned next day
  reinforced by others, and among them were six nuns who had deserted the
  convent of Ueberwasser and exhibited greater violence than the rest.</p>

  <p>The women entered the hall where the senators were sitting and demanded
  peremptorily that Rottmann should be instituted to the church of St. Lambert.
  They were turned out of the hall without much ceremony, but they waited the
  exit of the magistrates when their session was at an end; then they
  bespattered them with cow and horse dung, and cursed them as Papists. "At
  first you favoured our holy enterprise, but you have returned to Popery like
  dogs to their vomit. Since you have devoured the good Hessian God which
  Fabricius offers you in communion, you oppress the pure Word of God. To the
  gallows, to the gallows with you all!" The senators fled to their houses,
  pursued by the women, covered with filth, and deafened by their
  yells.[132]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[132] Kerssenbroeck, p. 468.</p>

  <p>Rottmann and his colleagues exercised an extraordinary influence over the
  people; they persuaded the rich ladies and citizens' wives of substance to
  sell their goods, give up their jewels, and cast everything they had into a
  common fund. The prompt submission of so many proves that the number of
  fanatics who were sincere in their convictions was considerable. These
  proceedings led to estrangement in families. Kerssenbroeck relates that the
  wife of one of the senators, named Wardemann, having been rebaptised by
  Rottmann, "was so vigorously confirmed in her faith by her husband, who had
  been informed by a servant maid of the circumstance, that she could not walk
  for several weeks." Other women, who had given up their jewels and money to
  Rottmann, were also severely chastised by their husbands.[133]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[133] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 472.</p>

  <p>The magistrates, afraid to touch Rottmann's person, hoped to weaken him by
  dismissing his assistants. They therefore, on the 15th January, 1534, ordered
  their officers to take the Anabaptist preachers, Clopris, Roll, and Strahl,
  and to turn them out of the town, with orders never to re-enter it. The
  mandate was executed; but the ministers returned by another gate, and were
  conducted in triumph to their parsonages by the whole body of the
  Anabaptists.[134]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[134] Kerssenbroeck, p. 473.</p>

  <p>The fugitive nuns of Ueberwasser, to the number of eight, were re-baptised
  by Rottmann on the 11th January, and became some of his most devoted
  adherents. Their conduct in the sequel was characterised by the most
  shameless lubricity.</p>

  <p>The prince-bishop at this time published a decree against the Anabaptists,
  outlawed Rottmann and five other preachers of that sect in Münster, and
  ordered his officers to check the spread of the schism through the other
  towns of his principality.</p>

  <p>On the 23rd January, Rottmann having noticed some Catholics and Lutherans
  amongst his audience in the church of the Servites, abruptly stopped his
  sermon, saying that it was not meet to cast the pearls of the new revelation
  before swine.[135] Then he descended from the pulpit, and refused to remount
  it again. But probably the real cause of this sudden cessation was, that the
  views of the leader were undergoing a third change, and he was unwilling to
  announce his new doctrine to an audience of which all were not prepared to
  receive it. He continued to assemble the faithful in private houses, and to
  hold daily assemblies, in which they were initiated into the further
  mysteries of his revelation. In every parish a house was provided for the
  purpose, and none were admitted without a pass-word. In these gatherings the
  mystic was able to give full development to his views without the restraint
  of an only partially sympathising audience.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[135] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 476.</p>

  <p>On the evening of the 28th January, at seven o'clock, the Anabaptists
  stretched chains across the streets, assembled in armed bands, closed the
  city gates, and placed sentinels in all directions. A terrible anxiety
  reigned in the city. The Lutherans remained up and awake all night, a prey to
  fear, with their doors and windows barricaded, waiting to see what these
  preparations signified. The night passed, broken only by the tramp of the
  sectarian fanatics, and lighted by the glare of their torches.</p>

  <p>Dawn broke and nothing further had taken place, when suddenly two men,
  dressed like prophets, with long ragged beards, ample garments, and flowing
  mantles, staff in hand paced through the town solemnly, up one street and
  down another, raising their eyes to heaven, sighing, and then looking down
  with an expression of compassion on the multitude, which bowed before them
  and saluted them as Enoch and Elias. After having traversed the greater part
  of the town, the two men entered the door of Knipperdolling's house.[136]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[136] Kerssenbroeck, p. 476.</p>

  <p>The names of these prophets were John Matthisson and John Bockelson. The
  first was the chief of the Anabaptist sect in Holland. The part which the
  second was destined to play in Münster demands that his antecedents should be
  more fully given. Bockelson was the bastard son of Bockel, bailiff of the
  Hague, and a certain Adelhaid, daughter of a serf of the Lord of Zoelcken, in
  the diocese of Münster. This Adelhaid purchased her liberty afterwards and
  married her seducer. John was brought up at Leyden, where he was apprenticed
  to a tailor. He visited England, Portugal, and Lubeck, and returned to Leyden
  in his twenty-first year. He then married the widow of a boatman, who
  presented him with two sons. John Bockelson was endowed by nature with a
  ready wit and with a retentive memory. He amused himself by learning nearly
  the whole of the Bible by heart, and by composing obscene verses and plays.
  In addition to his business of tailoring, he opened a public-house under the
  sign of "The Three Herrings," which became a haunt of women of bad repute.
  The passion for change came over Bockelson after leading this sort of life
  for a while, and he visited Münster in 1533, as we have already seen, and
  thence passed to Osnabrück, from which place he was expelled. After wandering
  about Westphalia for a while he returned to Leyden. Next year, in company
  with Matthisson, the head of the Anabaptists, he visited Münster, which the
  latter declared prophetically was destined to be the new Jerusalem, the
  capital of a regenerate world, where the millennial kingdom was to be set
  up.[137]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[137] Kerssenbroeck, part ii. p. 51 <i>et seq.</i>;
  Heresbach, p. 31; Hast, p. 324.</p>

  <p>The two adventurers reached their destination on the 13th January, and
  Knipperdolling received them into his house. Some of the preachers were
  informed of their arrival, but were required to keep the matter secret till
  the time ordained of God should come for their revealing themselves to the
  world.</p>

  <p>A council was being held in the house of Knipperdolling, when the prophets
  entered it after having finished their peregrination of the town. Rottmann,
  Roll, Clopris, Strapedius, Vinnius, and Strahl were engaged in a warm
  discussion. Some of the party were of opinion that the moment had arrived,
  now that all the Anabaptists were under arms, for a general purification of
  the city by the massacre or expulsion of Catholics and Lutherans; the others
  thought that the hour of vengeance had not yet struck, and that the day of
  the Lord must not be antedated. The quarrel was appeased by the appearance of
  the two prophets, who were hailed as messengers sent from heaven to announce
  the will of God. Then Matthisson and his companion knelt down and wept, and
  having meditated some moments, they uttered their decision in voices broken
  by sobs. "The time for cleansing the threshing-floor of the Lord is not yet
  come. The slaughter of the ungodly must be delayed, that souls may be
  gathered in, and that souls may be formed and educated in houses set apart,
  and not in churches which were lately filled with idols. But," said they in
  conclusion, "the day of the Lord is at hand."</p>

  <p>These words reconciled the council. On the evening of the 29th, the
  Anabaptists laid aside their arms and returned to their homes.[138] The
  events of the night had utterly dispelled the last traces of courage in the
  magistrates; they did not venture to notice the threatening aspect of the
  armed fanatics, or to remonstrate with them for barricading the streets. To
  avert all possible danger from themselves was their only object; and to
  effect this they published an act of toleration, permitting every man to
  worship God and perform his public and private devotions as he thought
  proper.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[138] Kerssenbroeck, part i. p. 477 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>The power of Rottmann had become so great, through the events just
  recorded, that a false prophecy did not serve to upset his authority. On the
  6th February, at the head of a troop of his admirers, he invaded the Church
  of Ueberwasser, "to prevent the Evangelical flame kindled in the hearts of
  the nuns from dying out."[139] Having summoned all the sisters into the
  church, he mounted the pulpit and preached to them a sermon on matrimony, in
  which he denounced convents and monasteries, in which the most imperious laws
  of nature were left unfulfilled, and "he urged the nuns to labour heartily
  for the propagation of the human race;" and then he completely turned the
  heads of the young women, by announcing to them with an inspired air, that
  their convent would fall at midnight, and would bury beneath its ruins every
  one who was found within its walls. "This salutary announcement has been made
  to me," said he, "by one of the prophets now present in this town, and the
  Heavenly Father has also favoured me with a direct and special revelation to
  the same effect."[140]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[139] Kerssenbroeck, p. 479.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[140] Hast, p. 329 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>This was enough to complete the conversion of the nuns, already shaken in
  their faith by the sermons they had been compelled to listen to for some time
  past. In vain did the Abbess Ida and two other sisters implore them to remain
  and despise the prophecy. The infatuated women, in paroxysms of fear and
  excitement, fled the convent and took refuge in the house of Rottmann, where
  they changed their clothes, and then ran about the town uttering cries of
  joy.</p>

  <p>The prophecy of Rottmann had been repeated by one to another throughout
  Münster. No one slept that night. Crowds poured down the streets in the
  direction of Ueberwasser, and the square in front of the convent was densely
  packed with breathless spectators, awaiting the ruin of the house.</p>

  <p>Midnight tolled from the cathedral tower. The crowd waited another hour.
  It struck one, and the convent had not fallen. Master Bernard was not the man
  to be disconcerted by so small a matter. "Prophecies," cried he, "are always
  conditional. Jonah foretold that Nineveh should be destroyed in forty days,
  but since the inhabitants repented, it remained standing. The same has taken
  place here. Nearly all the nuns have repented, have quitted their cloister
  and their habit, have renounced their vows&mdash;thus the anger of the
  Heavenly Father has been allayed."[141]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[141] Kerssenbroeck, p. 479.</p>

  <p>The preacher Roll was next seized with prophetic inspiration. He ran
  through the town, foaming at the mouth, his eyes rolling, his hair and
  garments in disorder, his face haggard, uttering at one moment inarticulate
  howls, and at another, exhortations to the impenitent to turn and be saved,
  for that the day of the Lord was at hand.[142]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[142] Dorpius, p. 394.</p>

  <p>A young girl of eighteen, the daughter of a tailor named Gregory Zumberge,
  was next seized. "On the 8th February she was possessed with a sort of
  oratorical fury, and she preached with fire and extraordinary volubility
  before an astonished crowd."</p>

  <p>The same day the spirit fell on Knipperdolling and Bockelson; they ran
  about the streets with bare heads and uplifted eyes, repeating incessantly in
  shrill tones, "Repent, repent, repent, ye sinners; woe, woe!" Having reached
  the market-place, they fell into one another's arms before a crowd of
  citizens and artizans who ran up from all directions. At the same moment, the
  tailor, Gregory Zumberge, father of the preaching damsel, arrived with his
  hair flying, his arms extended, his face contorted, and a wild light playing
  in his eyes, and cried, "Lift up your heads, O men, O dear brothers! I see
  the majesty of God in the clouds, and Jesus waving the standard of victory.
  Woe to ye impious ones who have resisted the truth! Repent, repent! I see the
  Heavenly Father surrounded by thousands of angels menacing you with
  destruction! Be converted! the great and terrible day of the Lord is come....
  God will truly purge His floor, and burn the chaff with unquenchable fire....
  Renounce your evil ways and adopt the sign of the New Convenant, if you wish
  to escape the wrath of the Lord."</p>

  <p>"It is impossible," says the oft-quoted writer, who was eye-witness in the
  town of all he describes, "impossible to imagine the gestures and antics
  which accompanied this discourse. Now the tailor leaped about on the stones
  and seemed as though about to fly; then he turned his head with extraordinary
  rapidity, beating his hands together, and looking up to heaven and then down
  to earth. Then, all at once, an expression of despair came over his face, and
  he fell on the pavement in the form of a cross, and rolled in the mud. A good
  number of us young fellows were there," continues Kerssenbroeck, "much
  astonished at their howling, and looking attentively at the sky to see if
  there really was anything extraordinary to be seen there; but not
  distinguishing anything we began to make fun of the illuminati, and this
  decided them to retire to the house of Knipperdolling."[143]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[143] Kerssenbroeck, p. 483.</p>

  <p>There a new scene commenced. The ecstatics left doors and windows wide
  open, that all that passed within might be seen and heard by the dense crowd
  which packed the street without. Those in the street saw Knipperdolling place
  himself in a corner, his face to the wall, and carry on in broken accents a
  familiar conversation with God the Father. At one moment he was seen to be
  listening, then to be replying, making the strangest gestures. This went on
  for some time, till another actor appeared. This was a blind Scottish beggar,
  very tall and gaunt&mdash;a zealous Anabaptist. He was fantastically dressed
  in rags, and wore high-heeled boots to add to his stature. Although blind, he
  ran about exclaiming that he saw strange visions in the sky. This was enough
  to attract a crowd, which followed him to the corner of the König's Strasse,
  when, just as he was exclaiming, "Alas, alas! Heaven is going this instant to
  fall!" he tumbled over a dung-heap which was in his way. This accident woke
  him from his ecstasy, and he picked himself up in great confusion, and never
  prophesied again.[144]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[144] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 479.</p>

  <p>But his place was speedily supplied by another man named Jodocus
  Culenburg, who, in order to convey himself with greater rapidity whither the
  Spirit called him, rode about the town on a horse, announcing in every street
  that he heard the peal of the Last Trumpet. Several women also were taken
  with the prophetic spirit, and one, named Timmermann, declared that "the King
  of Heaven was about to appear like a lightning-flash, and would re-establish
  Jerusalem." Another woman, whose cries and calls to repentance had caused her
  to lose her voice, ran about with a bell attached to her girdle, urging the
  bystanders with expressive gestures to join the number of the elect and be
  saved.[145]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[145] Kerssenbroeck, p. 484.</p>

  <p>These fantastic scenes had made a profound impression on many of the
  citizens of Münster. A nervous affection accompanying mystic excitement is
  always infectious. The agitation of minds and consciences became general; men
  and women had trances, prayed in public, screamed, had visions, and fell into
  cataleptic fits. In those days people knew nothing of physical and
  psychological causes; the general excitement was attributed by them to
  supernatural agency. It was simply a question whether these signs were
  produced by the devil or by the Spirit of God. The Catholics attributed the
  signs to the agency of Satan; the Lutherans were in nervous uncertainty. Were
  they resisting God or the devil? Fear lest they should be found in the ranks
  of those fighting against the Holy Spirit drew off numbers of the timorous
  and most conscientious to swell the ranks of the mystical sect. Münster was
  exhibiting on a large scale what is reproduced in our own land in many a
  Wesleyan and Ranter revival meeting.</p>

  <p>The time had now come, thought Rottmann, for the destruction of the
  enemies of God. Secret notice was sent to the different Anabaptist
  congregations to be prepared to strike the blow on the 9th of February.
  Accordingly, early in the morning, 500 fanatics seized on the gates of the
  city, the Rath-haus, and the arms it contained; cannons were planted in the
  chapel of St. Michael, the tower of St. Lambert's church, and in the market
  place; barricades of stones, barrels, and benches from the church were thrown
  up. The common danger united Catholics and Lutherans; they saw clearly that
  the intention of their adversaries was either to massacre them, or to drive
  them out of the town. They retreated in haste to the Ueberwasser quarter, and
  took up their position in the cemetery, planted cannons, placed bodies of
  armed men in the tower of the cathedral, and retook two of the city gates.
  They also arrested several of the senators who had joined the Anabaptist
  sect, but they had not the courage to lay their hands on the burgomaster,
  Tilbeck, who was also of that party. Two of the preachers, Strahl and
  Vinnius, were caught, and were lodged in the tower of Ueberwasser
  church.[146]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[146] Dorpius, f. 394.</p>

  <p>Messages were sent to the villages and towns around announcing the state
  of affairs, and imploring assistance. The magistrates even wrote in the
  stress of their terror to the prince-bishop, asking him to come speedily to
  their rescue from a position of imminent peril. Francis of Waldeck at once
  replied by letter, promising to march with the utmost rapidity to Münster,
  and demanding that one of the gates might be opened to admit him. This letter
  was taken to Hermann Tilbeck; but the burgomaster, intent on securing the
  triumph of the fanatics, with whom he was in league, suppressed the letter,
  and did not mention either its arrival or its contents to the senate. He,
  however, informed the Anabaptists of their danger, and urged them to come to
  terms with the Lutherans as speedily as possible.</p>

  <p>At the same time the pastor, Fabricius, unable to restrain his religious
  prejudices, even in the face of danger, sped among the Lutheran ranks,
  inciting his followers against the Catholics, and urging them to make terms
  with the fanatics rather than submit to the bishop. "Beware," said he, "lest,
  in the event of your gaining a victory, the Papists should recover their
  power, for it is they who are the real cause of all these evils and
  disorders."[147]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[147] Kerssenbroeck, p. 405 <i>et seq.</i> Montfort.,
  "Tumult. Anabap.," p. 15 <i>et seq.</i>; Bullinger, lib. ii. c. 8.</p>

  <p>Whilst the preacher was sowing discord in the ranks of the party of order,
  Rottmann and the two prophets, Matthisson and Bockelson, roused the
  enthusiasm of their disciples to the highest pitch, by announcing to them a
  glorious victory, and that the Father would render His elect invulnerable
  before the weapons of their adversaries.</p>

  <p>The Anabaptist women ran about the streets making the most extraordinary
  contortions and prodigious leaps, crying out that they saw the Lord
  surrounded by a host of angels coming to exterminate the worshippers of
  Baal.</p>

  <p>Thus passed the night. At daybreak Knipperdolling recommenced his course
  through the streets, uttering his doleful wail of "Repent, repent! woe, woe!"
  Approaching too near the churchyard wall of Ueberwasser, he was taken and
  thrown into the tower with Strahl and Vinnius.</p>

  <p>At eight o'clock the drossar of Wollbeck arrived at the head of a troop of
  armed peasants to reinforce the party of order, and several ecclesiastics
  entered the town to inform the magistrates that the prince-bishop was
  approaching at the head of his cavalry.</p>

  <p>Before the lapse of many hours the city might have been pacified and order
  re-established, had it not been for the efforts of Tilbeck the burgomaster,
  and Fabricius the divine. Mistrust of their allies had now fully gained
  possession of the Lutherans, and the burgomaster took advantage of the
  hesitation to dismiss the drossar of Wollbeck and his armed band, and to send
  to the prince, declining his aid. By his advice, also, the Anabaptists agreed
  to lay down their arms and make a covenant with the senate for the
  establishment of harmony. Hostages were given on either side and the
  prisoners were liberated. Peace was finally concluded on these conditions:
  1st. That faith should be absolutely free. 2nd. That each party should
  support the other. 3rd. That all should obey the magistrates.</p>

  <p>The treaty having been signed, the two armed bodies separated, the cannons
  were fired into the air, the drossar of Wollbeck and the ecclesiastics
  withdrew, with grief at their hearts, predicting the approaching ruin of
  Münster. The prince-bishop was near the town with his troops when the fatal
  news was brought him. He shed tears of mortification, turned his horse and
  departed.[148]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[148] Same authorities; Sleidan, p. 411.</p>

  <p>Peace was secured for the moment by this treaty, but order was not
  re-established. No sooner had the armed Anabaptists quitted the market-place
  than it swarmed with women who had received from Rottmann the sign of the New
  Covenant. "The madness of the pagan bacchantes," says the eye-witness of
  these scenes, Kerssenbroeck,[149] "cannot have surpassed that of these women.
  It is impossible to imagine a more terrible, crazy, indecent, and ridiculous
  exhibition than they made. Their conduct was so frenzied that one might have
  supposed them to be the furies of the poets. Some had their hair disordered,
  others ran about almost naked, without the least sense of shame; others again
  made prodigious gambles, others flung themselves on the ground with arms
  extended in the shape of a cross; then rose, clapped their hands, knelt down,
  and cried with all their might, invoking the Father, rolling their eyes,
  grinding their teeth, foaming at the mouth, beating their breasts, weeping,
  laughing, howling, and uttering the most strange inarticulate sounds....
  Their words were stranger than their gestures. Some implored grace and light
  for us, others besought that we might be struck with blindness and damnation.
  All pretended that they saw in heaven some strange sights; they saw the
  Father descending to judge their holy cause, myriads of angels, clouds of
  blood, black and blue fires falling upon the city, and above the clouds a
  rider mounted on a white horse, brandishing his sword against the impenitent
  who refused to turn from their evil ways.... But the scene was constantly
  varying. Kneeling on the ground, and turning their eyes in one direction,
  they all at once exclaimed together, with joined hands, 'O Father! Father! O
  most excellent King of Zion, spare the people!' Then they repeated these
  words for some while, raising the pitch of their voices, till they attained
  to such a shriek that a host of pigs could not have produced a louder noise
  when assembled on market-day.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[149] Kerssenbroeck, p. 495 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>"There was on the gable of one of the houses in the market-place a
  weathercock of a peculiar form, lately gilt, which just then caught the sun's
  rays and blazed with light. This weathercock caused the error of the women.
  They mistook it for the most excellent King of Zion. One of the citizens
  discovering the cause, climbed the roof of the house and removed this new
  sort of majesty. A calm at once succeeded to the uproar; ashamed and full of
  confusion, the visionaries dispersed and returned to their homes.
  Unfortunately the lesson did not restore them to their senses."</p>

  <p>Shortly after the treaty was signed, the burgomaster, Tilbeck, openly
  joined the Anabaptists, and was rebaptised with all his family by
  Rottmann.[150]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[150] Kerssenbroeck, p. 496.</p>

  <p>The more sensible and prudent citizens, including nearly all the Catholics
  and a good number of Lutherans, being well aware that the treaty was, in
  fact, a surrender of all authority into the hands of the fanatics, deserted
  the town in great numbers, carrying with them all their valuables. The
  emigration began on 12th February. The Anabaptists ordered that neither
  weapons nor victuals should be carried out of the gates, and appointed a
  guard to examine the effects of all those who left the city. The emigration
  was so extensive, that in a few days several quarters of the town were
  entirely depopulated.[151]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[151] Kerssenbroeck; Dorpius, ff. 394-5.</p>

  <p>Then Rottmann addressed a circular letter to the Anabaptists of all the
  neighbouring towns to come and fill the deserted mansions from which the
  apostates had fallen. "The Father has sent me several prophets," said he,
  "full of His Spirit and endowed with exalted sanctity; they teach the pure
  word of God, without human additions, and with sublime eloquence. Come then,
  with your wives and children, if you hope for eternal salvation; come to the
  holy Jerusalem, to Zion, and to the new temple of Solomon. Come and assist us
  to re-establish the true worship of God, and to banish idolatry. Leave your
  worldly goods behind, you will find here a sufficiency, and in heaven a
  treasure."[152]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[152] <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 502; Mencken, p. 1545.</p>

  <p>In response to this appeal, the Anabaptists streamed into the city from
  all quarters, from Holland, Friesland, Brabant, Hesse, Osnabrück, and from
  the neighbouring towns, where the magistrates exerted themselves to suppress
  a sect which they saw imperilled the safety of the commonwealth.</p>

  <p>In a short while the deserted houses were peopled by these fanatics.
  Bernhard Krechting, pastor of Gildehaus, arrived at the head of a large
  portion of his parishioners. Hermann Regewart, the ex-Lutheran preacher of
  Warendorf, sought a home in the new Jerusalem. Rich and well-born persons,
  bitten with the madness, arrived, such were Peter Schwering and his wife, the
  wealthiest citizens of Coesfeld; Werner von Scheiffort, a country gentleman;
  the Lady von Becke with her three daughters, of whom the two eldest were
  broken nuns, and the youngest was betrothed to the Lord of Dörlö; and the
  Grograff of Schoppingen, Heinrich Krechting, with his wife, his children, and
  a number of the inhabitants of that town, with carts laden with their
  effects. The Grograff took up his abode in Kerssenbroeck's house, along with
  his family and servants, and, as the chronicler bitterly remarks, he took
  care to occupy the best part of the mansion.[153]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[153] Kerssenbroeck, p. 503.</p>

  <p>Amongst those who escaped from the town were the syndic, Von Wyck, who had
  led the opposition against the bishop, and the burgomaster, Caspar Judenfeld.
  The latter retired to Hamm and was left unmolested, but Von Wyck had played
  too conspicuous a part to escape so easily. By the orders of the
  prince-bishop he was arrested and executed at Vastenau.[154]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[154] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 505.</p>

  <p>Münster now became the theatre of the wildest orgies ever perpetrated
  under the name of religion. It is apparently a law that mysticism should
  rapidly pass from the stage of asceticism into that of licence. At any rate,
  such has been the invariable succession of stages in every mystic society
  that is allowed unchecked to follow its own course. In the Roman Church those
  thus psychologically affected are locked up in convents. The religious
  passion verges so closely on the sexual passion that a slight additional
  pressure given to it bursts the partition, and both are confused in a frenzy
  of religious debauch. The Anabaptist fanatics were rapidly approaching this
  stage. The prophet Matthisson led the way by instituting a second baptism,
  administered only to the inner circle of the elect, which was called the
  baptism of fire.</p>

  <p>The adepts were sworn to secrecy, and refused to explain the mode of
  administration. But public curiosity was aroused, and by learning the
  password, some were enabled to slip into the assembly and see what took
  place. Amongst these was a woman who was an acquaintance of Kerssenbroeck,
  and from whose lips he had an account of the rite. "Matthisson," says he,
  "secretly assembled the initiated of both sexes during the night, in the vast
  mansion of Knipperdolling. When all were assembled, the prophet placed
  himself under a copper chandelier, hung in the centre of the ceiling, lighted
  with three tapers." He then made an instruction on the new revelation of the
  Divine will, which he pretended had been made to him, and the assembly became
  a scene of frantic orgies too horrible to be described.</p>

  <p>The assemblies in which these abominations were perpetrated, prepared the
  way for the utter subversion of all the laws of decency and morality, which
  followed in the course of a few months.</p>

  <p>When Carnival arrived, a grand anti-Catholic procession was organised, to
  incite afresh the hostility of the people to the ancient Church, its rites
  and ceremonies. First, a company of maskers dressed like monks, nuns, and
  priests in their sacred vestments, led the way, capering and singing ribald
  songs. Then followed a great chariot, drawn by six men in the habits of the
  religious orders. On the box sat a fellow dressed as a bishop, with mitre and
  crosier, scourging on the labouring monks and friars. On the car was a man
  represented as dying, with a priest leaning over him, a huge pair of
  spectacles on his nose, administering to the sick man the last sacraments of
  the Church, and addressing him in the most absurd manner, loudly, that the
  bystanders might hear and laugh at his farcical parody of the most sacred
  things of the old religion. The next car was drawn by a man dressed as a
  priest in surplice and stole. The other cars contained groups suitable for
  turning into ridicule devotion to saints, belief in purgatory, the mass,
  &amp;c.[155]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[155] Kerssenbroeck, p. 509.</p>

  <p>The prophets now decided that it was necessary to be prepared in the event
  of a siege. They, therefore, commissioned the preacher Roll to visit Holland
  and raise the Anabaptists there, urge them to arm and to march to the defence
  of the New Jerusalem. Roll started from Münster on the 21st of February, but
  the Spanish Government in the Netherlands, alarmed at what was taking place
  in the capital of Westphalia, ordered a strict watch to be kept on the
  movements of the fanatics, and Roll was seized and executed at Utrecht.</p>

  <p>The next step taken by the prophets was to discharge the members of the
  senate from the performance of their office, because they had been elected
  "according to the flesh," and to choose to fill their room another body of
  men "elected according to the Spirit." Bernard Knipperdolling and Gerhardt
  Kippenbroeck, both drapers, were appointed burgomasters.</p>

  <p>One of the first acts of the new magistrates was to forbid the removal of
  furniture, articles of food, and money from the town, and to permit a general
  pillage of all the churches and convents in the city. The Anabaptist mob
  first attacked the religious houses, and carried off all the sacred vessels,
  the gold, the silver, and the vestments. Then they visited the chapel of St.
  Anthony, outside the gate of St. Maurice, and after having sacked it
  completely, they tore it down. They burnt the church of St. Maurice, then
  fell upon the church of St. Ledger, but had not the patience to complete its
  demolition. Thence they betook themselves to the cathedral, broke it open,
  and destroyed altars, with their beautiful sculptured and painted oak
  retables, miracles of delicate workmanship and Gothic beauty, the choir
  stalls, statues, paintings, frescoes, stained glass, organ, vestments, and
  carried off the chalices and ciboriums. The great clock, the pride of
  Münster, as that of Strasburg is of the Alsatian capital, was broken to
  pieces with hammers. A valuable collection of MSS., collected by the poet
  Rudolf Lange, and presented to the minister, together with the rest of the
  volumes in the library, were burned. Two noble paintings, one of the Blessed
  Virgin, the other of St. John the Baptist, on panel, by Franco, were split up
  and turned into seats for privies to the guard-house near the Jews' cemetery.
  The heads and arms were broken off the statues that could not be
  overthrown&mdash;statues of apostles, prophets, and sibyls, which decorated
  the interior of the cathedral and the neighbouring square. The tabernacle was
  broken open, and the Blessed Sacrament was danced and stamped on. The font
  was shattered with crowbars, in token of the abhorrence borne by the fanatics
  to infant baptism; the tombs of the bishops and canons were destroyed, and
  the bodies torn from their graves, and their dust was scattered to the
  winds.[156]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[156] Kerssenbroeck, p. 510; Sleidan, p. 411; Dorpius, f.
  395.</p>

  <p>But whilst this was taking place in Münster, Francis von Waldeck was
  preparing for war. On the 23rd February he held a meeting at Telgte to
  consolidate plans, and now from all sides assistance came. The Elector of
  Cologne, the Duke of Cleves, even the Landgrave of Hesse, now exasperated at
  the ill-success of his endeavours to establish tranquillity and to effect a
  compromise, the Duke of Brunswick, the Regent of Brabant, the Counts of Lippe
  and Berntheim, and many other nobles and cities sent soldiers, artillery, and
  munitions.</p>

  <p>The bishop appointed the generals and principal officers, then he made all
  the soldiers take an oath of fidelity to himself, and concluded with them an
  agreement, consisting of the following ten articles:</p>

  <p>1. The soldiers are to be faithful to the prince, and to obey their
  officers.</p>

  <p>2. The towns, arms, and munitions taken in war shall belong to the
  prince.</p>

  <p>3. If, after the capture of the city, the prince-bishop permits its
  pillage by the troops, he shall not be obliged to pay them any
  prize-money.</p>

  <p>4. If the pillage be accorded, the town hall is not to be touched.</p>

  <p>5. The prince shall have half the plunder.</p>

  <p>6. The nobles, canons, and those who have escaped from the city shall be
  allowed the first bid for their articles when offered for sale.</p>

  <p>7. No fixtures shall be removed by the soldiery.</p>

  <p>8. After the capture of the town, the custody of the gates and ramparts
  shall be confided to those whom the prince-bishop shall appoint.</p>

  <p>9. The city taken, and its pillage permitted, the soldiers shall be
  allowed eight days for distribution and sale of the plunder. The soldiers
  shall receive their pay with punctuality.</p>

  <p>10. The heads of the revolt shall, as far as possible, be taken alive and
  delivered up to the bishop for a recompense.[157]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[157] Kerssenbroeck, p. 513 <i>et seq.</i> Sleidan, lib.
  x. pp. 412-3; Heresbach, p. 36.</p>

  <p>The Anabaptists were not afraid at these preparations; they made ready
  vigorously for the defence of the New Zion. As a preliminary, a body of five
  hundred burnt the convent of St. Maurice, outside the city gates, and
  levelled all the houses of the suburbs, which obscured the view, and might
  serve as cover for the besiegers.</p>

  <p>On the 26th February Matthisson preached in the afternoon to a
  congregation summoned by the discharge of a culverin. At the end of the
  sermon he assumed an inspired air, and announced that he had an important
  revelation to communicate. Having arrested the attention of his hearers, he
  said in a solemn tone, "The Father requires the purification of the New
  Jerusalem and of His temple; for our republic, which has begun so
  prosperously, cannot grow and endure if a prey to the confusion produced by
  the presence of impious sects. My advice is that we kill without further
  delay the Lutherans, the Papists, and all those who have not the right faith,
  that there may remain in Zion but one body, one society, which is truly
  Christian, and which can offer to the Father a pure and well-pleasing
  worship. There is but one way of preserving the faithful from the contagion
  of the impious, and that is to sweep them off the face of the earth. Nothing
  is easier than the execution of this scheme. We form the majority in a strong
  city, abundantly supplied with all necessaries; there is nothing to fear from
  within or from without."[158]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[158] Kerssenbroeck, p. 516.</p>

  <p>This suggestion would have been carried into immediate execution by the
  frenzied sectarians, had it not been for the intervention of Knipperdolling,
  who, fearing that a general massacre of Lutherans and Catholics would combine
  the forces of the Smalkald union and of the Imperialists against the city,
  urgently insisted on milder measures. "Let us be content," said he, "with
  driving, to-morrow, out of the city those miserable creatures who refuse the
  sign of the New Covenant; thus shall we thoroughly purge the floor of the
  Lord, and nothing that is impure will remain in the New Jerusalem."[159]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[159] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 517; Sleidan, p. 412.</p>

  <p>This advice was accepted, and it was unanimously decided that the morrow
  should witness the expulsion of Catholics and Lutherans. The 27th February
  was a bitterly cold day. A hard frost had set in, the north wind blew,
  cutting to the bone all exposed to the blast, the country was white with
  snow, and the streams were crusted over with ice. At every gate was a double
  guard; the squares were thronged with armed fanatics, and in and out among
  them passed the prophets, staff in hand, uttering maledictions on the Lord's
  enemies, and words of encouragement to those sealed on their brows and
  hands.</p>

  <p>Matthisson sought out those who did not belong to the sect, and with
  menacing gestures and flaring eyes called them to repentance before the door
  was shut. "Turn ye, turn ye, sinners," he cried in his harsh tones. "Judgment
  is preparing for you. The elements are in league against you; your iniquities
  have made nature rise to scourge you. The sword of the Lord's anger is hung
  above your heads. Turn, ye sinners, and receive the sign of our alliance,
  that ye be not cast out from the chosen people!" Then he flung himself down
  in the great square, and called on the Father; and lying with arms extended
  on the frozen ground, and his face pinched with cold turned towards the sky,
  he fell into a trance. The Anabaptists knelt around him, and lifting their
  hands to heaven besought the Father to reveal His will by the mouth of the
  prophet whom He had sent.</p>

  <p>Then Matthisson, slowly returning from his ecstasy, like one awaking out
  of a dream, said, "This is the will and order of the Father: the miscreants,
  unless they be converted and be baptised, must be expelled this place. This
  holy city shall be purified of all that is unclean, for the conversation of
  the ungodly corrupts and defiles the people of God. Away with the sons of
  Esau! this place, this New Zion, this habitation belongs to the sons of
  Jacob, to the true Israel."</p>

  <p>The enthusiasm of Matthisson communicated itself to the assembly. The
  Anabaptists separated to sweep the streets, sword and pike in hand, and drove
  the ungodly beyond their walls, shouting, "The lot is ours; the tares must be
  gathered from among the wheat; the goats from the sheep; the unholy from the
  godly; away, away!" Doors were burst open, and the fanatics invaded every
  house, driving before them men, women, and children, from garret and cellar,
  wherever concealed, in spite of their cries and entreaties. Men of all
  professions, men and women of every age were banished; they were not allowed
  to take anything with them. The sword of the Lord was brandished against
  them; the hale and the infirm, the master and the servant, none were spared.
  Those who lagged were beaten; those who were sick and unable to fly were
  carried to the market-place to be rebaptised by Rottmann.</p>

  <p>Through the gates streamed the terrified crowd, shivering, half clothed,
  mothers clasping their babes to their breasts, children sustaining between
  them their aged parents, all blue with cold, as the fierce wind thick strewn
  with sleet rushed upon them at the corners, and over the bare plain without
  the city walls, growling and cruel, as though it too were wrought up into
  religious frenzy, and came as an auxiliary to the savage work.</p>

  <p>Thousands traversed the frozen plans, uncertain whither to fly for refuge,
  uttering piteous cries, lamentations, or low moans; whilst from the walls of
  the heavenly city thundered a salvo of joy, and the Anabaptists shouted,
  because the Lord's day of vengeance had come, and the millennium was set up
  on earth.</p>

  <p>"Never," says Kerssenbroeck, "never did I see anything more afflicting.
  The women carried their naked nurslings in their arms, and in vain sought
  rags wherewith to clothe them; miserable children, hanging to their fathers'
  coats, ran barefooted, uttering piercing cries; old people, bent by age,
  tottered along calling down God's vengeance on their persecutors; lastly,
  some sick women driven from their beds during the pangs of maternity fell in
  labour in the snow, deprived of all human succour."[160]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[160] Kerssenbroeck, p. 5222.</p>

  <p>Amongst those expelled was Fabricius, the Lutheran divine, who escaped in
  disguise. He was so greatly hated by the sectarians, that had he been
  recognised, he would not have been suffered to quit the city alive.</p>

  <p>The Frau Werneche, a rich lady, too stout to walk, and unable to find a
  conveyance, was obliged to remain in Münster. Rottmann insisted on her
  receiving the sign of the New Covenant.</p>

  <p>"I have been baptised already, as were my ancestors," said the good woman.
  Rottmann replied that if she persisted in her impiety she must be slain with
  the sword, lest the wrath of the Father should be kindled against the Holy
  City. The poor lady, who had no desire for martyrdom, cried out, impatiently,
  "Well, then, be it so! baptise me in the name of all the devils of hell, for
  I have already been baptised in the name of God." Rottmann, not very
  particular, administered the rite, and the stout lady remained in
  Münster.</p>

  <p>The apostle now sent letters into all the country, announcing the glad
  tidings of the approaching reign of Christ on earth, and inviting the
  Anabaptists of the neighbourhood to flock into Zion. One of these epistles of
  Rottmann has been preserved.[161]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[161] Kerssenbroeck, p. 520; Dorpius, f. 395.</p>

  <p>"Bernard, servant of Jesus Christ in His Church of Münster, salutes
  affectionately his very dear brother Henry Schlachtschap. Grace and peace
  from God, and the strength of the Holy Spirit, be with you and with all the
  faithful.</p>

  <p>"Dear Brother in Christ,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The marvellous works of God are so great and so diverse that it would not
  be possible for me to describe them all, had I a hundred tongues. I am,
  therefore, unable to do so with my single pen. The Lord has splendidly
  assisted us. He has delivered us out of the hands of our enemies, and has
  driven them from the city. Seized by a panic terror, they fled in multitudes.
  This is the beginning of what the Lord announced by His prophets&mdash;that
  all the saints would assemble in this New Zion. These prophets have charged
  me to write to you, that you may order all the brethren to hasten to us with
  all the gold and silver they can collect; as for their other goods, let them
  be left to the sisters, who will dispose of them, and then join us here also.
  Beware of doing anything after the flesh; do all in the Spirit. The rest by
  word of mouth. Health in the Lord."</p>

  <p>This appeal had all the more success because several executions had taken
  place at Wollbeck and Bevergern and other places, together with confiscation
  of goods, and this had struck alarm into the Anabaptists scattered throughout
  the principality. Numbers, therefore, answered the appeal, and went up, as
  the tribes of the Lord, to Jerusalem, out of Leyden, Coesfeld, Warendorf, and
  Gröningen. The vacated houses were re-occupied, the Münster Baptists
  selecting for themselves the best. Knipperdolling, Kippenbroeck, and others,
  took possession of the residences of the canons; servants installed
  themselves in the dwellings of their masters as if they were their own; and
  the deserted monasteries were given up as hostels to receive the influx from
  the country, till houses could be provided for them.[162]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[162] Kerssenbroeck, p. 523.</p>

  <p>On the 28th February, Francis von Waldeck left Telgte at the head of his
  army and invested the capital. Batteries were planted, seven camps were
  established for the infantry, and six for the cavalry around Münster. These
  camps were in connection with one another, for mutual support in the event of
  a sortie, and were rapidly fortified.</p>

  <p>Thus began the siege which was to last sixteen months minus four days,
  during which a multitude of untrained, undisciplined fanatics, commanded by a
  Dutch tailor-innkeeper, held out against a numerous and well-armed force. But
  there was an element of strength in the besieged that lacked in the
  besiegers. Those within the walls were members of a vast confraternity, which
  ramified over Germany, Switzerland, and the Low Countries, its members bound
  together by a common enthusiasm, in more or less direct relation with the
  chiefs who commanded in the Westphalian capital. In spite of the siege, news
  from without was constantly brought into the city, and messengers were sent
  out to stir up the members of the society in other countries and provinces to
  rise and march to the relief of the city which, they all believed, was
  destined to be their religious capital. The Münster brothers looked for a
  speedy deliverance wrought by the efficacy of the arms of their brothers in
  Holland, Juliers, Cleves, and Brabant. The Low Countries swarmed with
  Anabaptists who had organised communities in Amsterdam, Leyden, Utrecht,
  Haarlem, Antwerp, and Ghent; they had arms stored in cellars and garrets, and
  waited only the proper moment to rise in a body, massacre their opponents,
  and deliver the Holy City. Several attempts to rise were made, but the
  vigilance of the Spanish Government in the Netherlands prevented the rising;
  and the hopes of the besieged were never realised.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the army of the prince-bishop was composed of
  mercenaries, of soldiers from different provinces and principalities,
  speaking different dialects, with different interests, and differing also in
  faith. The Lutheran troops would not cordially unite with the Catholics, and
  the latter mistrusted their Protestant allies, whose sympathies they believed
  lay with the Anabaptist besieged. And the head of the whole army was a
  Catholic prelate with Lutheran proclivities, who knew nothing of war, had an
  empty purse, and desired to reduce his own subjects by the aid of foreign
  mercenaries, with little expense to himself, and damage to his subjects.</p>

  <p>The Anabaptists organised their defence with prudence. They elected
  captains and standard-bearers, and divided all the citizens capable of
  bearing arms into regiments and companies. Every one was given his place and
  his functions, and it was decided that the magistrates should be required to
  mount guard when it came to their turn. Boys were drilled and taught the use
  of the arquebus; women prepared brands steeped in pitch and sulphur to fling
  at the enemy, and they melted lead from the roofs into bullets. Mines were
  dug and charged with powder, fresh bastions were thrown up, and curtains were
  erected before the gates, into which were built the tombs and sarcophagi of
  the bishops and canons.[163]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[163] Kerssenbroeck, p. 531 <i>et seq.</i>; Hast, p.
  344.</p>

  <p>The newly-elected senate, though composed of the most zealous Anabaptists,
  was powerless before Matthisson. A sect governed by the inspiration of the
  moment, professing to be guided by the Spirit speaking through the mouths of
  prophets, ready to spring into the maddest excesses at the dictates of
  visionaries, could not long submit to the government of a magistracy whose
  power was temporal. The way was rapidly preparing for the establishment of a
  spiritual despotism.</p>

  <p>It was in vain for the senate to pass an order without the sanction of
  Matthisson, in vain for them to attempt resistance to the execution of his
  mandates. One day he announced that it was the will of the Father that all
  the goods of the citizens who had fled, or had been expelled, should be
  collected into one place, that they might be distributed amongst the saints,
  as every man had need. He thereupon despatched men to bring together all that
  was left behind in the city by the refugees, and convey the articles to
  houses which he designated in every parish. He was promptly obeyed. Garments,
  linen, beds, furniture, crockery, food, wine&mdash;everything was brought
  away in carts. The jewels, the gold, and the silver, were deposited in the
  chancery. Then the prophet ordered three days of prayer to be instituted,
  "that God might reveal to him the persons chosen by Him to keep guard over
  the accumulated treasure."[164]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[164] Kerssenbroeck; Dorpius, f. 395.</p>

  <p>When the three days were at an end, Matthisson announced that the Father
  had indicated to him seven individuals who were to be the deacons to serve
  tables in the New Jerusalem. He therefore appointed the men to distribute out
  of the common store to those who needed that which would satisfy their
  necessities.[165]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[165] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 585.</p>

  <p>It must not, however, be supposed that, with the expulsion of the impious
  from the holy city, all opposition had disappeared. A very considerable
  number of citizens, shopkeepers, and merchants, rather than desert their
  houses, abandon their goods to pillage, and lose their trade, had consented
  to be re-baptised. The reign of the prophets was becoming to them daily more
  irksome. A blacksmith, named Hubert Rüscher, or Trutling, had the courage to
  oppose Matthisson, to charge him with being a false prophet, and an
  impostor.[166] The prophet, feeling the danger of his position, saw that a
  measure, decided and terrible, must be adopted to suppress the murmurs, and
  frighten those who desired to shake off his yoke. "Judgment must begin at the
  house of God," said Matthisson; and he ordered the immediate execution of the
  smith. Tilbeck, the burgomaster, and Redecker, a magistrate, interposed, but
  were, by order of the prophet, cast into prison. Then Bockelson, bursting
  through the crowd, announced with frantic gesture that the Father had
  commissioned him to slay with the sword he bore all those who withstood the
  will of Heaven as interpreted by the prophets whom He had sent. Then
  brandishing his weapon, he rushed upon the blacksmith, but Matthisson
  forestalled him, by running his halbert through the body of the unfortunate
  man. Finding that he still breathed, he despatched him with a carbine,
  crying, "So perish all who are guilty of similar crimes." Then, at his
  command, the multitude chanted a hymn of praise, and dispersed, silent and
  trembling, to their homes.[167]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[166] Kerssenbroeck, p. 535 <i>et seq.</i>; Monfortius,
  p. 19; Sleidan and Dorpius call the man Truteling; Sleidan, p. 412; Dorpius,
  f. 395 b.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[167] Monfortius, p. 19.</p>

  <p>Matthisson took immediate advantage of the power this bold stroke had
  given him to deal another blow. When the treasure of the enemies of Zion had
  been confided to the care of deacons, the faithful had kept their own goods.
  But this was to be no longer tolerated. The prophet issued a decree,
  requiring all, old and young, male and female, under pain of death, to bring
  all their possessions in gold and silver, under whatever form it might be,
  into the treasury; "Because," said he, "such things profit not the true
  Christian."</p>

  <p>The majority of the citizens obeyed, in fear and trembling; but many
  buried their vessels and ornaments of precious metal, and declared that they
  possessed no jewels.[168] However, the amount of money, chains, rings,
  brooches, and cups, brought together was very considerable. It was placed in
  the chancery, and confided to four of Matthisson's most devoted
  adherents.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[168] Kerssenbroeck, p. 538.</p>

  <p>A few days after, he summoned all the inhabitants into the Cathedral
  square, where, in a long discourse, he announced that the wrath of God was
  excited against those who had allowed themselves to be rebaptised on the 26th
  of February, out of human considerations, because they did not desire to
  leave their homes and their effects, or out of fear; and he advised them all
  to betake themselves to the church of St. Lambert, to entreat the Father to
  pardon them for having lied to the Holy Ghost, and soiled by their presence
  the city of the children of God; "and if the Father does not remit your
  offence," concluded he in a loud and terrible voice, "you must perish by the
  sword of the Just One."</p>

  <p>In an agony of terror, the unfortunate citizens crowded the church, and
  the doors were fastened behind them. They passed several hours within,
  weeping, groaning, and deploring their lot, a prey to inexpressible
  terror.[169]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[169] Kerssenbroeck, p. 539.</p>

  <p>At length Matthisson entered, accompanied by armed men, and the prisoners,
  supposing they were about to be slaughtered, fell at his feet and embraced
  his knees, entreating him, with tears, as the favourite of God, to mediate
  with Him and obtain their pardon. The prophet replied that he must consult
  the Father; he knelt down, and fell into an ecstasy. After a few moments he
  rose, leaped with joy, and declared that the Father, though greatly
  irritated, had granted his prayer, and suffered the penitents to live. Then
  the poor creatures were purified, hymns of praise were sung, and they were
  pronounced admitted into the household of the true Israel. The doors were
  thrown open, and they were allowed to disperse.</p>

  <p>On the 15th of March, a new decree appeared, forbidding the faithful to
  possess, read, or look at any books except the Bible, and requiring all the
  books, in print or MS., and all legal documents that were found in the town,
  to be brought to the Cathedral square, and there to be consigned to the
  flames. Thus perished many a treasure of inappreciable value.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the appeal of Rottmann to the Anabaptists of the Low
  Countries to come and deliver Zion had produced its effect. Thousands
  assembled in the neighbourhood of Amsterdam, crossed the Zuyder Zee, landed
  at Zwoll, and marched towards Münster, pillaging and burning churches and
  convents. But Baron Schenk von Teutenburg, imperial lieutenant, met them,
  utterly routed them, cut to pieces a large number, and made many
  prisoners.[170]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[170] Kerssenbroeck, pp. 541, 542; Bullinger, ii. c.
  10.</p>

  <p>The prophets of Münster, warned of their advance, but ignorant of their
  dispersion, reckoned on an approaching deliverance, and continued their
  follies. On Good Friday, April 3, 1534, they organised a general festival,
  with bells pealing, and a mock procession carrying candles. The treaty
  concluded with the prince-bishop, through the intervention of Philip of
  Hesse, was attached to the tail of an old horse, and the beast was driven out
  of the gate of St. Maurice in the direction of the enemy's camp.[171]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[171] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 542.</p>

  <p>Easter approached, and with it great things were expected. A rumour
  circulated that a mighty deliverance of Israel would be wrought on the Feast
  of the Resurrection. Whether Matthisson started the report or was carried
  away by it, it is impossible to decide; but it is certain that, on the eve,
  he announced in an access of enthusiasm, after a trance, that he had received
  orders from the Father to put to flight the armies of the aliens with a
  handful of true believers.[172]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[172] <i>Ibid.</i>, 542; Hast, p. 348.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, on the morrow, carrying a halbert, he headed a few zealots
  who shared his confidence; the gate of St. Ludgar was thrown open, and he
  rushed forth with his followers upon the army of the prince-bishop; whilst
  the ramparts were crowded by the inhabitants of Münster, shouting and
  praying, and expecting to see a miracle wrought in his favour. But he had not
  advanced very far before a troop of the enemy surrounded his little band,
  and, in spite of a desperate resistance, he and his companions were cut to
  pieces.[173]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[173] Kerssenbroeck, 542; Sleidan, p. 413; Bullinger,
  lib. ii. c. 9; Heresbach, p. 138; Buissierre, p. 310.</p>

  <p>John Bockelson, seeing that the confidence of the Anabaptists was shaken
  by the failure of this prediction and the fall of the great prophet, lost not
  a moment in establishing his own supremacy. He called all the people
  together, and declared to them that Matthisson had died by the just judgment
  of God, because he had disobeyed the commandment of the Father to go forth
  with a very small handful, and because he had relied on his own strength
  instead of on Divine aid. "But," added he, "he neglected all those
  precautions he ought to have taken, solemn prayer and fasting, after the
  example of Judith; and he forgot that victory is in the hands of God; he was
  proud and vain, therefore was he forsaken of the Lord. His terrible end was
  revealed to me eight days ago by the Holy Ghost; for, as I was sleeping in
  the house of Knipperdolling, after having meditated on the Divine Law,
  Matthisson appeared to me pierced through by the lance of an armed man, with
  all his bowels gushing forth. Then was I frightened beyond measure at this
  terrible spectacle; but the armed man said to me, 'Fear not, well-beloved son
  of the Father, but be faithful to thy calling, for the judgment of God will
  fall upon Matthisson; and when he is dead, marry his widow.' These words cast
  me into profound amazement, for I have already a legitimate wife at Leyden.
  Nevertheless, that I might have a witness worthy of confidence to this
  extraordinary revelation, I trusted the secret to Knipperdolling; he is
  present, let him be brought forth."[174]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[174] Kerssenbroeck, p. 543; Montfort., p. 24.</p>

  <p>Thereupon Knipperdolling stepped forward and declared by oath that
  Bockelson had spoken the truth, and he mentioned the place, the day, and the
  hour when the revelation was confided to him.</p>

  <p>From that moment Bockelson passed with the people not only as a prophet,
  but as a favourite of Heaven, one specially chosen of the Father, and was
  held in far higher estimation, accordingly, than had been the fallen prophet.
  He was seized with inspiration. On the 9th of April, he declared that "the
  Father ordered, under pain of incurring his dire wrath, that every exalted
  thing should be laid low, and that the work was to begin at the church
  steeples." Consequently three architects of the town were ordered to demolish
  them. They succeeded in pulling down all the spires in Münster. That of
  Ueberwasser church was singularly beautiful. It was reduced to a stump; and
  the modern visitor to the ancient Westphalian capital has cause to deplore
  its loss. The towers were only saved to be used as positions for cannon to
  play upon the besiegers.[175]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[175] Bullinger, ii. c. 8; Sleidan, p. 271; Dorpius, f.
  396.</p>

  <p>Bockelson had another vision, which served to consolidate his power. "The
  Father," said he, "had appeared to him, and had commanded him to appoint
  Knipperdolling to be the executioner of the new republic."</p>

  <p>This was not precisely satisfactory to Knipperdolling; he aimed at a
  higher office, but he dissembled his irritation, and accepted the sword
  offered him by John of Leyden with apparent transports of joy.[176] Four
  under-executioners were named to assist him, and to accompany him wherever he
  went.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[176] Kerssenbroeck, p. 545; Heresbach, p. 139; Sleidan,
  p. 413; Dorpius, f. 396.</p>

  <p>The nomination of Knipperdolling was the prelude to other important
  changes. Bockelson aspired to exercise absolute power, without opposition or
  control. To arrive at his ends, a wild prophetic scene was enacted. He ran,
  during the night, through the streets of Münster stark naked, uttering howls
  and crying, "Ye men of Israel who inhabit this holy Zion! fear the Lord, and
  repent for your past lives. Turn ye, turn ye! The glorious King of Zion,
  surrounded by multitudes of angels, is about to descend and judge the world,
  at the peal of His terrible trumpet. Turn, ye blind ones, and be converted."
  [177]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[177] Kerssenbroeck, p. 596; Monfort, pp. 25, 26;
  Heresbach, p. 99 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>Exhausted with his run and his shouts, and satisfied with having
  thoroughly alarmed the inhabitants, he returned to the house of
  Knipperdolling, who was also in a paroxysm of inspiration, foaming, leaping,
  rolling on the ground, and performing many other extravagant actions.
  Bockelson, on entering, cast himself down in a corner and pretended to have
  lost the power of speech; and as the crowd, assembled round him, asked him
  the meaning of what had taken place, he signed to them to bring him tablets,
  on which he wrote, "By the order of the Father, I remain dumb for three
  days."</p>

  <p>At the expiration of this period he convoked the people, and declared to
  them that the Father had revealed to him that Israel must have a new
  constitution, with new laws and new magistrates, divinely appointed. The
  former magistracy had been elected by men, but the new one was to be
  designated by the Holy Ghost. Bockelson then dissolved the senate, and, as
  the mouthpiece of God, he declared the names of the new officers, to the
  number of twelve, who were to bear the title of The Elders of the Tribes of
  Israel, in whose hands all power, temporal and spiritual, was to be placed.
  Those appointed were, as might have been expected, the prophet's most devoted
  adherents.[178] Hermann Tilbeck, the old burgomaster, was brought out of
  prison, and it was announced to him that he was to be of the number of
  elders; but perhaps a little cooled in this enthusiasm by his sojourn in
  chains, he burst into tears, and in accents of humility prayed, "Oh, Father!
  I am not worthy so great an honour; give me strength and light to govern with
  wisdom."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[178] Dorpius, f. 396 b.</p>

  <p>Rottmann, who, since the arrival of the prophet, had played but a
  subordinate part, judged the occasion favourable for thrusting himself into
  prominence. He therefore preached a long sermon, in which he declared that
  God was the author of the new constitution, and then, calling the elders
  before him by name, he committed to each a drawn sword, with the words,
  "Receive with this weapon the right of life or death, which the Father has
  ordered me to confer upon you, and use the sword conformably to the Lord's
  will." Then the proceedings closed with the multitude singing the <i>Gloria
  in excelsis</i> in German, on their knees.</p>

  <p>The senate resigned its functions without apparent regret or opposition,
  and the twelve elders assumed the plenitude of power. They abolished the laws
  and formulated new ones, published edicts, resolved difficulties, judged
  causes, subject to no control save the will of the prophet; but that will
  they regarded as identical with the Divine will, as superior to all law, and
  every one obeyed its smallest requirements.</p>

  <p>Immediately after the installation of the government, an edict in ten
  parts was published.[179] The first part, divided into thirteen articles,
  contained the moral law; the second part, in thirty-three articles, contained
  the civil law.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[179] Kerssenbroeck, pt. ii. pp. 1-9; Monfortius, pp. 26,
  27; Hast, p, 352 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>The first part forbade thirteen crimes under pain of death: blasphemy,
  disobedience, adultery, impurity, avarice, theft, fraud, lying and slander,
  idle conversation, disputes, anger, envy, and discontent against the
  government.</p>

  <p>The second part required every citizen to conform his life and belief to
  the Word of God; to fulfil exactly his duties to others and to the State. It
  ordered a strict system of vigilance against night surprises by the enemy,
  and required one of the elders to sit in rotation every day as judge to try
  cases brought before him; also, that whatsoever was decided by the elders as
  necessary for the welfare of the New Jerusalem should be announced to the
  assembly-general of Israel, by the prophet John of Leyden, servant of the
  Most High; that Bernard Knipperdolling, the executioner, should denounce to
  the elders the crimes committed within the holy city; and that he might
  exercise his office with greater security he was never to go forth
  unaccompanied by his four assistants.</p>

  <p>It ordered that henceforth repasts should be taken publicly and in common;
  that every one should accept what was set before him, should eat it modestly,
  in silence; that the brothers and the sisters should eat at separate tables;
  and that, during the meal, portions of the Old Testament should be read to
  them.</p>

  <p>The next articles named the individuals who were to execute the offices of
  butcher, shoemaker, smith, tailor, brewer, and the like, to the Lord's
  people. Two articles forbade the introduction of new fashions, and the
  wearing of garments with holes in them. Article XXIX. ordered every stranger
  belonging to another religion, who should enter the city of Münster, to be
  examined by Knipperdolling. No communication of any sort with strangers was
  permitted to the children of Zion.</p>

  <p>Article XXXII. forbade, under pain of death, desertion from the military
  service, or exchange of companies without the sanction of the elders.</p>

  <p>Article XXXIII. required that in the event of a decease, all the goods and
  chattels of the defunct should be taken to Knipperdolling, who would convey
  them to the elders, and they would distribute them as they judged
  fitting.</p>

  <p>That some of these provisions were indicative of great prudence is not to
  be doubted. All food having been seized upon and being served out publicly to
  all the citizens alike, and in moderation, the capabilities of prolonging the
  defence were greatly increased; and the military dictatorship and strict
  discipline within the city maintained by the prophet, enabled the Anabaptists
  to preserve an invulnerable front to an enemy torn by faction and with
  divided responsibilities.</p>

  <p>To increase the disaffection and party strife in the hostile camp, the
  people of Münster sent arrows amongst the besiegers, to which were attached
  letters, one of which has been preserved by Kerssenbroeck.[180] It is an
  exhortation to the enemy to beware lest by attacking the people of the Lord,
  who held to the pure Word of God, they should be regarded by him as in league
  with Antichrist, and urging them to repentance.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[180] Kerssenbroeck, pt. ii. p. 9.</p>

  <p>Besiegers and besieged heaped on each other reciprocal insults, exhibiting
  themselves to one another in postures more expressive of contempt than
  decent.[181]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[181] <i>Ibid.</i> pp. 11, 12.</p>

  <p>A chimney-sweep, named William Bast, had about this time a vision ordering
  him to burn the cities of the ungodly. Bast announced his mission to the
  elders and to the prophet, and was bidden go forth in the Lord's name. He
  accordingly left Münster, eluded the vigilance of the enemy's sentinals, and
  reached Wollbeck, where was the powder magazine of the Episcopal army. He
  fired several houses, and the flames spread, but were fortunately
  extinguished before they reached the powder. Bast had escaped to
  Dreusteindorf, where also he attempted to execute his mission, but was
  caught, brought back to Wollbeck, and burnt alive.</p>

  <p>In the meantime various sorties had taken place, in which the besiegers
  suffered, being caught off their guard. On May 22nd, the prince-bishop,
  finding the siege much more serious than he had anticipated, began to bombard
  the town; but as fast as the walls gave way, they were repaired by the women
  and children at night.</p>

  <p>A general assault was resolved on for the 26th May; of this the besieged
  were forewarned by their spies. Unfortunately for the investing army, the
  soldiers of Guelders got drunk on the preceding day in anticipation of their
  victory, and marched reeling and shouting against the city as the dusk closed
  in. The Anabaptists manned the walls, and easily repulsed their tipsy
  assailants; but in the meantime the rest of the army, observing the march of
  the men of Guelders, and hearing the discharge of firearms, rushed to their
  assistance, without order; the Münsterians rallied, repulsed them with great
  carnage, and they fled in confusion to the camp. The Anabaptists had only
  lost two officers and eight soldiers in the fray; and their success convinced
  them that they were under the special providence of God, which had rendered
  them invincible.[182] They, therefore, repaired their walls with energy,
  erected several additional bastions, and continued their sorties.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[182] Kerssenbroeck, pp. 15, 16; Sleidan, p. 413.</p>

  <p>On the 30th May, a party of the fanatics issued from a subterraneous
  passage upon the sentinels opposite the Judenfeld gate, spiked nineteen
  cannon, and laid a train of gunpowder from the store, which they reached, to
  the mouth of their passage. The troops stationed within sight marched hastily
  to repulse the sortie, when the train was fired, the store exploded, and a
  large number of soldiers were destroyed.[183]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[183] Kerssenbroeck, pp. 15, 16.</p>

  <p>The prince-bishop next adopted an antiquated expedient, which proved
  singularly inefficacious. He raised a huge bank against the walls, by
  requisitioning the services of the peasants of the country round. The
  besieged poured a shower of bullets amongst the unfortunate labourers, who
  perished in great numbers, and the mole remained unfinished.[184]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[184] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 21.</p>

  <p>Francis of Waldeck, discouraged, and at the end of his resources, sent his
  deputies to the Diet of Neuss on the 25th June, to announce to the Archbishop
  of Cologne and the Duke of Juliers his failures, and to ask for additional
  troops. The two princes replied that they would not abandon their ally in his
  difficulties, and they promised to bear a part of the cost of the siege,
  advanced 40,000 florins for the purchase of gunpowder, promised to despatch
  forces to his assistance, and sent at once prudent advisers.[185] The prince
  was, in fact, utterly incompetent as a general and incompetent as a bishop.
  The pastoral staff has a crook at the head and a spike at the bottom.
  Liturgiologists assure us that this signifies the mode in which a bishop
  should exercise discipline&mdash;the gentle he should restrain or direct with
  mercy, the rebellious he should treat with severity. To the former he should
  be lenient, with the latter prompt. Francis of Waldeck wielded gracefully and
  effectively neither end of his staff.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[185] Hast, p. 357; Sleidan, p. 413.</p>

  <p>He shortly incurred a risk, and but for the fidelity of one of his
  subjects in Münster, he would have fallen a victim to assassination.</p>

  <p>A young Anabaptist maiden, named Hilla Phnicon, of singular beauty,
  conceived the notion that she had been called by God to be the Judith of this
  new Bethulia, and was to take the head from off the shoulders of the great,
  soft, bungling Holophernes, Francis of Waldeck.[186]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[186] Kerssenbroeck, p. 26 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>Rottmann, Bockelson, and Knipperdolling encouraged the girl in her
  delusion, and urged her not to resist the inspirations of the Father.
  Accordingly, on the 16th June, Hilla dressed herself in the most beautiful
  robes she could procure, adorned her hair with pearls, and her arms with
  bracelets, selecting from the treasury of the city whatever articles she
  judged most conducive to the end; the treasury being for the purpose placed
  at her disposal by order of the prophet. Furnished with a linen shirt steeped
  in deadly poison, which she had herself made, as an offering to the prince,
  she left Münster, and delivered herself up into the hands of the drossar of
  Wollbeck, who, after having dispoiled her of her jewels, questioned her as to
  her object in deserting the city. She replied with the utmost composure, that
  she was a native of Holland, and that she had lived in Münster with her
  husband, till the change of religion had so disgusted her that she could
  endure it no longer, and that she had fled on the first opportunity, and that
  her husband would follow her on a suitable occasion. "It is to ask pardon for
  him that I am come," said she; "and he will be able to indicate to his
  highness a means of entering the city without loss."</p>

  <p>The perfect self-possession of the lady convinced the drossar of her
  sincerity, and he promised to introduce her to the prince at Iburg within two
  days. Everything seemed to favour the adventuress; but an unexpected event
  occurred on the 18th, the day appointed for the audience, which spoiled the
  plot.</p>

  <p>The secret had been badly kept, and it was a matter of conversation, hope,
  and prayer in Münster. A citizen named Ramers, who had remained in the city,
  and had been rebaptised rather than lose his business and give up his house
  to pillage, having heard of it, escaped from the town on the 18th, and
  revealed the projects of Hilla to one of the generals of the besieging army.
  The unfortunate young woman was thereupon put to the question, and confessed.
  She was conducted to Bevergern and decapitated. At the moment when she was
  being prepared for execution, she assured the bystanders that they would not
  be able to take her life, for the prophet John "chosen friend of the Father,
  had assured her that she would return safe and sound to Zion."</p>

  <p>The bishop sent for Ramers, provided for his necessities, and ordered that
  his house and goods should be spared in the event of the capture of
  Münster.</p>

  <p>As soon as one danger disappeared, another rose up in its place. The
  letters attached to arrows fired by the Anabaptists into the hostile camp, as
  well as their secret agents, had wrought their effect. The Lutheran
  auxiliaries from Meissen complained that they were called to fight against
  the friends of the Gospel, and on the night of the 30th June they deserted in
  a body.[187] Other soldiers escaped into Münster and offered their arms to
  the Anabaptists. Disaffection was widely spread. Disorder, misunderstandings,
  and ill-concealed hatred reigned in the camp. The besieged reckoned among
  their assailants numerous and warm friends, and were regularly informed of
  all the projects of the general. Their emissaries bearing letters to the
  Anabaptists in other territories easily traversed the ranks of the investing
  army, and when they had accomplished their mission they returned with equal
  ease to the gates of Münster, which opened to receive them.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[187] Kerssenbroeck, p. 36.</p>

  <p>One of the soldiers of the Episcopal army, who had taken refuge in
  Münster, was lodged in the house of Knipperdolling, in which also dwelt John
  Bockleson. The deserter observed that the Leyden prophet was wont to leave
  his bedroom at night, and he ventured to watch his conduct and satisfy
  himself that it was not what it ought to be.[188] He mentioned to others what
  he had observed. The scandal would soon get wind. One only way remained to
  cut it short. John Bockleson consulted with Rottmann and the other preachers,
  and urged that polygamy should be not only sanctioned but enjoined on the
  elect.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[188] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 38; H. Montfort., p. 28.</p>

  <p>Some of those present having objected to this new doctrine, the prophet
  cast his mantle and the New Testament on the ground, and solemnly swore that
  this which he enjoined was the direct revelation of the Almighty. He
  threatened the recalcitrant ministers, and at last, half-persuaded and wholly
  frightened, they withdrew their objections; and he appointed the pastors
  three days in which to preach polygamy to the people.[189] The new doctrine
  having been ventilated, an assembly of the people was called, and it was
  formerly laid down by the prophet as the will of God, that every man was to
  have as many wives as he wanted.[190]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[190] Kerssenbroeck, p. 38.</p>

  <p>The result of this new step was to bring about a reaction which for a
  moment threatened the prophet's domination with downfall.</p>

  <p>On the 30th July, Heinrich Mollenhecke, a blacksmith, supported by two
  hundred citizens, burghers and artisans, declared openly that he was resolved
  to put down the new masters of Münster, and to restore everything upon the
  ancient footing. With the assistance of his companions, he captured
  Bockleson, Knipperdolling, and the preachers Rottmann, Schlachtscap, Clopris,
  and Vinnius, and cast them into prison. Then a council was held, and it was
  resolved that the gates should be opened to the bishop, the old magistracy
  should be restored, and the exiled burgesses should be recalled, and their
  property restored to them: and that all this should be done <i>on the
  morrow</i>. Had it been done on the spot we should have heard no more of John
  of Leyden. The delay saved him and ruined the reactionary party. It allowed
  time for his adherents to muster.[191] Mollenhecke and his party, when they
  met on the following morning to execute their design, were attacked and
  surrounded by a multitude of fanatics headed by Heinrich Redecker. The
  blacksmith had succeeded in collecting only a handful. "No pen can describe
  the rage with which their adversaries fell upon them, and the refinements of
  cruelty to which they became victims. After having overwhelmed them with
  blows and curses, they were imprisoned, but they continued inflicting upon
  them such horrible tortures that the majority of these unfortunates would
  have a thousand times preferred death."[192] Ninety-one were ordered to
  instant execution. Twenty-five were shot, the other sixty-six were
  decapitated by Knipperdolling to economize powder, and lest the sound of the
  discharge of firearms within the city should lead the besiegers to believe
  that fighting was going on in the streets. Some had their heads cut off,
  others were tied to a tree and shot, others again were cut asunder at the
  waist, and others were slowly mutilated. Knipperdolling himself executed the
  men, so many every day, in the presence of the prophet, till all were
  slain.[193]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[193] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 41; Dorpius, f. 536 b.</p>

  <p>"The partisans of the emancipation of the flesh having thus obtained the
  mastery in Münster," says the eye-witness, "it was impossible, a few days
  later, to discover in the capital of Westphalia the last and feeble traces of
  modesty, chastity, and self-restraint."</p>

  <p>Three men, John [OE]chinckfeld, Henry Arnheim, and Hermann Bispinck,
  having, however, the hardihood to assert that they still believed that
  Christian marriage consisted in the union of one man with one woman, were
  decapitated by order of John of Leyden.[194]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[194] H. Montfort., p. 29; C. Heresbach, p. 42.</p>

  <p>With the death of these men disappeared every attempt at resistance.</p>

  <p>The horrors which were perpetrated in Münster under the name of religious
  liberty almost exceed belief. The most frantic licence and savage debauchery
  were practised. The prophet took two wives, besides his favourite sultana,
  the beautiful Divara, widow of Matthisson, and his lawful wife at Leyden.
  These were soon discovered to be too few, and the harem swelled
  daily.[195]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[195] Kerssenbroeck, p. 42. Dorpius confirms the horrible
  account given by Kerssenbroeck from what he saw himself, f. 498.</p>

  <p>"We must draw a veil," says Kerssenbroeck, "over what took place, for we
  should scandalise our readers were we to relate in detail the outrageous
  scenes of immorality which took place in the town, and the villanies which
  these maniacs committed to satisfy their abominable lusts. They were no more
  human beings, they were foul and furious beasts. The hideous word <i>Spiritus
  meus concupiscit carnem tuam</i> was in every mouth; those who resisted these
  magic words were shut up in the convent of Rosenthal; and if they persisted
  in their obstinacy after exhortation, their heads were cut off. In one day
  four were simultaneously executed on this account. On another occasion a
  woman was sentenced to be decapitated, after childbirth, for having
  complained of her husband having taken to himself a second wife."[196]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[196] Kerssenbroeck, p. 43 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>Henry Schlachtscap preached that no man after the Ascension of Christ had
  lived in true matrimony, if he had contracted marriage on account of beauty,
  wealth, family, and similar causes, for that true marriage consisted solely
  in that which was instigated by the Spirit.</p>

  <p>A new prophet now appeared upon the scene, named Dusentscheuer, a native
  of Warendorf. He rushed into the market-place uttering piercing cries, and
  performing such extraordinary antics that a crowd was speedily gathered
  around him.</p>

  <p>Then, addressing himself to the multitude, he exclaimed, "Christian
  brothers, the celestial Father has revealed to me, and has commanded me to
  announce to you, that John Bockelson of Leyden, the saint and prophet of God,
  must be king of the whole earth; his authority will extend over emperors,
  kings, princes, and all the powers of the world; he will be the chief
  authority; and none shall arise above him. He will occupy the throne of his
  father David, and will carry the sceptre till the Lord reclaims it from
  him."[197]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[197] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 47; Sleidan, p. 419; Bullinger,
  lib. ii. p. 56; Montfort., p. 31; Heresbach, pp. 136-7, "Historia von d.
  Münsterischen Widerteuffer," f. 328 b; Dorpius, f. 397.</p>

  <p>Bockelson and the twelve elders were present. A profound silence reigned
  in the assembly. Dusentscheuer, advancing to the elders, demanded their
  swords of office; they surrendered them into his hands; he placed eleven at
  the feet of Bockelson, and put the twelfth into his hand,
  saying&mdash;"Receive the sword of justice, and with it the power to
  subjugate all nations. Use it so that thou mayst be able to give a good
  account thereof to Christ, when He shall come to judge the quick and the
  dead."[198] Then drawing from his pocket a phial of fragrant oil, he poured
  it over the tailor's head, pronouncing solemnly the words, "I consecrate thee
  in the presence of thy people, in the name of God, and by His command, and I
  proclaim thee king of the new Zion." When the unction was performed,
  Bockelson cast himself in the dust and exclaimed, "O Father! I have neither
  years, nor wisdom, nor experience, necessary for such sovereignty; I appeal
  to Thy grace, I implore Thy assistance and Thy all-powerful protection!...
  Send down upon me, therefore, Thy divine wisdom. May Thy glorious throne
  descend on me, may it dwell with me, may it illumine my labours; then shall I
  be able to accomplish Thy will and Thy good pleasure, and thus shall I be
  able to govern Thy people with equity and justice."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[198] Kerssenbroeck, p. 43 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>Then, turning himself towards the crowd, Bockelson declared that he had
  long known by revelation the glory that was to be his, but he had never
  mentioned it, lest he should be deemed ambitious, but had awaited in patience
  and humility the accomplishment of God's holy will. He concluded by saying
  that, destined by the Father to reign over the whole world, he would use the
  sword, and slay all those who should venture to oppose him.[199]</p>

  <p>Nevertheless murmurs of disapprobation were heard. "What!" thundered the
  Leyden tailor, "you dare to resist the designs of God! Know then, that even
  were you all to oppose me, I should nevertheless become king of the whole
  earth, and that my royalty, which begins now in this spot, will last
  eternally."</p>

  <p>The new prophet Dusentscheuer and the other preachers harangued the people
  during three consecutive days on the new revelation, read to the people the
  23rd chapter of Jeremiah and the 27th of Ezekiel, and announced that in the
  King John the prophecies of the old seers were accomplished, for that he was
  the new David whom God had promised to raise up in the latter days. They also
  read aloud the 13th chapter of St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans, and
  accompanied the lecture with commentaries on the necessity and divine
  obligation of submission to authority.[199]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[199] Kerssenbroeck, p. 47; and the authors before
  quoted.</p>

  <p>At the expiration of these three days, Dusentscheuer requested John of
  Leyden to complete the spoliation of the inhabitants, so that everything they
  possessed might be placed in a common fund. "It has been revealed to me,"
  said he, "that the Father is violently irritated against the men and women
  because they have abused grievously their food and drink and clothing. The
  Father requires for the future, that no one of either sex shall retain more
  than two complete suits and four shirts; the rest must be collected and
  placed in security. It is the will of the Lord that the provisions of beef
  and pork found in every house shall also be seized and be consecrated to the
  general use."[200]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[200] Kerssenbroeck, p. 49.</p>

  <p>The order was promptly obeyed. Eighty-three large waggons were laden with
  confiscated clothes, and all the provisions found in the city were brought to
  the king, who confided the care and apportionment of them to
  Dusentscheuer.</p>

  <p>Bockelson now organised his court with splendour. He appointed his
  officers, chamberlain, stewards, marshals, and equerries, in imitation of the
  Court of the Emperor and Princes of Germany. Rottmann was named his chaplain;
  Andrew von Coesfeld, director of police; Hermann Tilbeck, grand-marshal;
  Henry Krechting, chancellor; Christopher Waldeck, the bishop's son, who had
  fallen into his power, was in derision made one of the pages; and a privy
  council of four, composed of Bernard Krechting, Henry Redecker, and two
  others of inferior note, was instituted under the presidency of Christian
  Kerkering. John had also a grand-master of the kitchen, a cup-bearer, taster,
  carver, gentlemen of the bedchamber, &amp;c.[201]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[201] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 55 Montfort., pp. 31-3; Sleidan, p.
  418; Bullinger, p. 57; Heresbach, pp. 137-8.</p>

  <p>But John Bockelson not only desired to be surrounded by a court; he
  determined also to display all the personal splendour of royalty.
  Accordingly, at his order, two crowns of pure gold were made, one royal, the
  other imperial, encrusted with jewels. Around his neck hung a gold chain
  enriched with precious stones, from which depended a globe of the same metal
  transfixed by two swords, one of gold, the other of silver. The globe was
  surmounted by a cross which bore the inscription, "Ein König der
  Gerechtigkeit über all" (a King of Righteousness over all). His sceptre,
  spurs, baldrick and scabbard were also of gold, and his fingers blazed with
  diamonds. On one of the rings, which was exceedingly massive, was cut, "Der
  König in dem nyen Tempel furet dit zeichen vur sein Exempel" (the King of the
  new Temple bears this symbol as his token). The royal garments were
  magnificent, of crimson and purple, and costly stuffs of velvet, silk, and
  gold and silver damask, with superb lace cuffs and collars, and his mantle
  lined with costly furs. The elders, the prophets, and the preachers followed
  suit, and exchanged their sad-coloured garments for robes of honour in gay
  colours. The small house of Knipperdolling no longer contented the
  tailor-king; he therefore furnished, and moved into, a handsome mansion
  belonging to the noble family of Von Büren. The house next door was converted
  into the palace of his queens, and was adorned with royal splendour. A door
  of communication, broken through the partition wall, allowed King John to
  visit his wives at all hours.</p>

  <p>He now took to himself thirteen additional wives, and a large train of
  concubines. Among his sixteen legitimate wives was a daughter of
  Knipperdolling. Divara of Haarlem remained the head queen, though she was the
  oldest. The rest were all under twenty, and were the most beautiful girls of
  Münster. They all bore the title of queens, but Divara alone had a court,
  officers, and bodyguard, habited in a livery of chestnut brown and green; the
  livery of the king being scarlet and blue.[202]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[202] Kerssenbroeck, p. 55 <i>et seq.</i>; and the
  authors above cited. Kerssenbroeck gives long details of the dress,
  ornaments, and manner of life of the king; also "Historia von d.
  Münsterischen Widerteuffer," f. 329.</p>

  <p>The king usually had his meals with his wives, and during the repasts he
  examined them with great attention, feasting his eyes on their beauty. The
  names of the sixteen queens were inscribed on a tablet on which the king,
  after dinner, designated the lady who had attracted his favour.[203]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[203] Kerssenbroeck gives the names of all the wives
  except one, which he conceals charitably, as the poor child&mdash;she was
  very young&mdash;fell ill, but recovered, and was living respectably after
  the siege with her relatives in the city.</p>

  <p>The King of Zion had abolished the names of the days of the weeks, and had
  replaced them by the seven first letters of the alphabet. He ordered that
  whenever a child was born in the town, it should be announced to him, and
  then he gave it a name, whose initial letter corresponded with the letter of
  the day on which it entered the world. But, as Kerssenbroeck observes, the
  debauchery which reigned in Münster had the result of diminishing the births,
  so that the number of children born during the latter part of the siege was
  extraordinarily small.</p>

  <p>Bockelson had only two children by all his wives, and both were daughters.
  Divara was the first to give birth; the event took place on a Sunday,
  designated by the letter A; it was given the name of Averall (for
  Ueberall&mdash;Above all); the second child, born on Monday, was called
  Blydam (the Blythe).[204]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[204] Kerssenbroeck, p. 59.</p>

  <p>Thrice in the week Bockelson sat in judgment in the market-place on a
  throne decked in purple silk, and richly adorned with gold. He betook himself
  to this place of audience with great pomp. A band of musical instruments
  headed the pageant, then followed the councillors in purple, and the
  grand-marshal with the white wand in his hand. John, wearing the royal
  insignia, mounted on a white horse, splendidly caparisoned, followed between
  two pages fantastically dressed, one bearing a Bible, the other a naked
  sword, symbols of the spiritual and temporal jurisdiction exercised by his
  majesty. The bodyguard surrounded his royal person, to keep off the crowd and
  to protect him from danger. Knipperdolling, Rottmann, the secretary Puthmann,
  and the chancellor Krechting followed; then the executioner and his four
  assistants, a train of courtiers, and servants closed the procession. The
  whole ceremony was as regal, as punctiliously observed, as at a royal court
  where the traditions date from many centuries.[205]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[205] Kerssenbroeck, p. 62; H. Montfort., p. 33; Hast, p.
  363 <i>et seq.</i>; Sleidan, p. 415; "Historia von de Münsterischen
  Widerteuffer," f. 328 b.</p>

  <p>When the king reached the market-place, a squire held the horse, he slowly
  mounted the steps of the throne, and inclining his sceptre, announced the
  opening of the audience.</p>

  <p>Then the plaintiffs approached, prostrated themselves flat upon the ground
  twice, and spoke. The majority of the cases were matrimonial complaints,
  often exceedingly indecent; "the greatest abominations formulated in the most
  hideously cynical terms before the most cynical of judges." Capital
  sentences, or penalties little less severe, were pronounced against
  insubordinate wives.[206]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[206] Kerssenbroeck. Sleidan says, "Almost every case and
  complaint brought before him concerned married people and divorces. For
  nothing was more frequent, so that persons who had lived together for many
  long years now separated for the first time."&mdash;p. 415-6.</p>

  <p>The same ceremonial was observed whenever his majesty went to hear the
  preaching in the market-square, with the sole exception, that on this
  occasion he was accompanied by the sixteen queens, magnificently dressed.
  Queen Divara rode a palfrey caparisoned in furs, led by a page; the court and
  the fifteen other queens followed on foot. On reaching the market-place, the
  ladies entered a house opposite the throne, and assisted at the sermon,
  sitting at the windows.</p>

  <p>The pulpit and the throne were side by side; a long broad platform united
  them. When the sermon was concluded, the king, his queens, court, ministers,
  and the preacher, assembled on the platform and danced to the strains of the
  royal band.</p>

  <p>It was from this platform that King John, as sovereign pontiff, blessed
  polygamous marriages, saying to the brides and the bridegrooms, "What God
  hath joined let no man put asunder; go, act according to the divine law, be
  fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth." This sanction was necessary
  for the validity of these unions.</p>

  <p>John, wishing to exercise all the prerogatives of royalty, struck coins of
  various values, bearing on one side the inscription, "Das Wort is Fleisch
  geworden und wohnet unter uns" (The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us);
  or "Wer nicht gebohren ist aus Wasser und Geist der kann nicht
  eingehen&mdash;" the rest on the reverse&mdash;"In das Reich Gottes. Den es
  ist nur ein rechter König über alle, ein Gott, ein Glaube, eine Tauffe" (who
  is not born of Water and the Spirit, cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.
  For there is only one true King over all, one God, one Faith, one Baptism).
  And in the middle, "Münster, 1534."</p>

  <p>Whilst the city of Münster was thus passing from a republic to a monarchy,
  the siege continued; but the besiegers made no progress. Refugees informed
  the prince-bishop of what had taken place within the walls.</p>

  <p>On the 25th August he assembled the captains and the princes and nobles
  who had come into the camp to observe the proceedings, to request them to
  advise him how to put an end to all these horrors and abominations. It was
  proposed that a deputation should be sent into the town to propose a
  capitulation on equitable terms; and in the event of a refusal to offer a
  general assault.[207]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[207] Kerssenbroeck, p. 65 <i>et seq.</i>; Montfort., pp.
  27, 28.</p>

  <p>On the 28th August an armistice of three hours' duration was concluded,
  and the deputation obtained a safe-conduct authorising them to enter the
  city. But instead of being brought before the inhabitants of the town, to
  whom they were commissioned to make the propositions, they were introduced to
  the presence of Bockelson and his court.</p>

  <p>The envoys informed King John of the terms proposed by the bishop. They
  were extremely liberal. He promised a general amnesty if the place were
  surrendered, and arms laid down.</p>

  <p>King John replied haughtily, that he did not need the clemency of the
  prince-bishop, for that he stood strengthened by the almighty and
  irresistible power of God. "It is your pretended bishop," said he, "who is an
  impious and obstinate rebel, he who makes war without previous declaration
  against the faithful servants of the celestial Father. Never will I lay down
  my arms which I have taken up for the defence of the Gospel; never in
  cowardly fashion will I surrender my capital: on the contrary, I know how to
  defend it, even to the last drop of my blood, if the honour of God requires
  it."[208]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[208] Kerssenbroeck, p. 21.</p>

  <p>The bishop, when he learnt that his deputies had been refused permission
  to address the citizens, attached letters, sealed with his Episcopal seal, to
  arrows, which were shot into the town. In these letters he promised a general
  pardon to all those who would leave the party of the Anabaptists, and escape
  from the town before the following Thursday.</p>

  <p>But Bockelson forbade, on pain of death, any one touching or opening one
  of these letters, and ordered the instant decapitation of man, woman, or
  child who testified anxiety to leave Münster.</p>

  <p>The bishop and the princes resolved on attempting an assault without
  further delay. John of Leyden received information of their purpose through
  his spies. He at once mounted his white horse, convoked the people, and
  announced to them that the Father had revealed to him the day and hour of the
  projected attack; he appointed his post to every man, gave employment to the
  women and children, and displayed, at this critical moment, the zeal, energy,
  and readiness which would have done credit to a veteran general.[209]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[209] Kerssenbroeck, p. 68.</p>

  <p>The assault was preluded by a bombardment of three days. The battlements
  yielded, breaches were effected in the walls, the roofs of the houses were
  shattered, the battered gates gave way, and all promised success. But the
  besieged neglected no precaution. During the night the walls were repaired
  and the gates strengthened. Women laboured under the orders of the competent
  directors during the hours of darkness, thus allowing their husbands to take
  their requisite repose. They carried stones and the munitions of war to the
  ramparts, and learning to handle the cross-bow, they succeeded in committing
  no inconsiderable amount of execution among the ranks of the Episcopal army.
  Other women prepared lime and boiling pitch "to cook the bishop's soup for
  him."[210] On the 31st August, at daybreak, the roar of the Hessian devil, as
  a large cannon belonging to the Landgrave Philip was called, gave the signal.
  Instantly the city was assaulted in six places. The ditches were filled,
  petards were placed under the gates, the palisades were torn down, and
  ladders were planted. But however vigorous might be the attack, the defence
  was no less vigorous. Those on the walls threw down the ladders with all upon
  them, and they fell bruised and mangled into the fosse, the heads of those
  who had reached the battlements were crushed with stones and cudgels, and
  their hands, clasping the parapet, were hacked off. Women hurled stones upon
  the besiegers, and enveloped them in boiling pitch, quicklime, and blazing
  sulphur.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[210] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 70.</p>

  <p>Repulsed, they returned to the charge eight or ten times, but always in
  vain. The whole day was consumed in ineffectual assaults, and when the red
  sun went down in the west, the clarions pealed the retreat, and the army,
  dispirited and bearing with it a train of wounded, withdrew, leaving the
  ground strewn with dead.</p>

  <p>Had the Anabaptists made a night assault, the defeat and dispersion of the
  Episcopal troops would have been completed. But instead, they sang a hymn and
  spent the night in banqueting.</p>

  <p>The prince-bishop, despondent and at his wits' end for money, called his
  officers to a consultation on the 3rd September, and it was unanimously
  resolved to turn the investment into an effective blockade. This resolution
  was submitted to the electors of Cologne and Saxony, the Duke of Cleves, and
  the Landgrave of Hesse, and these princes approved of the design of Francis
  von Waldeck.</p>

  <p>It was determined to raise seven redoubts, united by ramparts and a ditch,
  around the city, so as completely to close it, and prevent the exit of the
  besieged and the entrance of provisions. It was decided that the defence of
  this circle of forts should be confided to a sufficient number of tried
  soldiers, and that the rest of the army should be dismissed.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, on the 7th September, all the labourers of the country round
  were engaged, under the direction of the engineer Wilkin von Stedingen, in
  raising the walls and digging the trenches. The work was carried on with
  vigour by relays of peasants; nevertheless, the undertaking was on so great a
  scale, that several months must elapse before it could be completed.[211]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[211] Kerssenbroeck, p. 75 <i>et seq.</i>; Heresbach, p.
  132.</p>

  <p>The cost of this terrible siege had already risen to 600,000 florins, the
  treasury was empty, and the country could bear no further taxes. Francis of
  Waldeck appealed to the Elector Palatine, the Electors of Cologne, Mainz, and
  Trèves, to give help and subsidies; he had recourse also to the princes and
  nobles of the Upper and Lower Rhine; and it was decided that a diet should
  assemble on the 13th December, 1534, to make arrangements for the complete
  subjugation of the insurgent fanatics. All the princes, Catholic and
  Protestant, trembled for their crowns, for the Anabaptist sect ramified
  throughout the country, and if John of Leyden were successful in Münster,
  they might expect similar risings in their own principalities.[212]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[212] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 75; Bussierre, p. 372; Hast, p.
  366.</p>

  <p>Whilst the preparations for the blockade were in progress, John Bockelson,
  inflated with pride, placed no bounds to his prodigality, his display, and
  his despotism. He frequently pronounced sentences of death. Thus Elizabeth
  Holschers was decapitated for having refused her husband what he demanded of
  her; Catherine of Osnabrück underwent the same sentence for having told one
  of the preachers that he was building his doctrines upon the sand; Catherine
  Knockenbecher lost her head for having taken two husbands. Polygamy was
  permitted, but polyandry was regarded as an unpardonable offence.[213]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[213] Kerssenbroeck, p. 75; Bussierre, p. 372.</p>

  <p>However, the people chafed at the tyranny they were subjected to, and
  murmurs, low and threatening, continued to make themselves heard; whereupon,
  by King John's order, Dusentscheuer announced from the pulpit, "that all
  those who should for the future have doubts in the verities taught them, and
  who should venture to blame the king whom the Father had given them, would be
  given over to the anointed of the Lord to be extirpated out of Israel,
  decapitated by the headsman, and condemned to eternal oblivion."</p>

  <p>Amongst those who viewed with envy the rise and splendour of the
  tailor-king was Knipperdolling. He had opened his home to the prophet, had
  patronised him, introduced him to the people of Münster, and now the draper
  was eclipsed by the glory of the tailor. Thinking that the time was come for
  him to assume the pre-eminence, he made an attempt to dethrone Bockelson.</p>

  <p>On the 12th of September he was seized with the spirit of prophecy, became
  as one possessed, rushed through the town howling, foaming at the mouth,
  making prodigious leaps and extravagant gestures, and crying in every street,
  "Repent! repent!" After having carried on these antics for some time,
  Knipperdolling dashed into the market-place, cast himself down on the ground,
  and fell into an ecstasy.</p>

  <p>The people clustered around him, wondering what new revelation was about
  to be made, and the king, who was then holding audience, looked on uneasily
  at the crowd drifting from his throne towards his lieutenant-general, whose
  object he was unable to divine, as this performance had not been concerted
  between them.</p>

  <p>He was not left long in uncertainty, for Knipperdolling, rising from the
  ground with livid face, scrambled up the back of a sturdy artisan standing
  near, and crawled on all fours "like a dog," says Sleidan, over the heads of
  the throng, breathing in their faces, and exclaiming, "The celestial Father
  has sanctified thee; receive the Holy Ghost." Then he anointed the eyes of
  some blind men with his spittle, saying, "Let sight be given you."
  Undiscomfited by the failure of this attempt to perform a miracle, he
  prophesied that he would die and rise again in three days; and he indicated a
  corner of the market-place where this was to occur. Then making his way
  towards the throne, he began to dance in the most grotesque and indecent
  manner before the king, shouting contemptuously, "Often have I danced thus
  before my mistresses, now the celestial Father has ordered me to perform
  these dances before my king."[214]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[214] Kerssenbroeck, p. 81 <i>et seq.</i>; Sleidan, p.
  416.</p>

  <p>John was highly displeased at this performance; and he ran down the steps
  of his throne to interrupt him. But Knipperdolling nimbly leaped upon the
  dais, seated himself in the place of majesty, and cried out, "The Spirit of
  God impels me: John Bockelson is king according to the flesh, I am king
  according to the Spirit; the two Testaments must be abolished and extirpated.
  Man must cease from obeying terrestrial laws; henceforth he shall obey only
  the inspirations of the Spirit and the instincts of nature."</p>

  <p>John of Leyden sprang at him, dragged him from the throne, beat his head
  with his golden sceptre, and administering a kick to the rear of his
  lieutenant, sent him flying head over heels from the platform, and then
  calmly enthroning himself, he gave orders for the removal and imprisonment of
  the rebel.</p>

  <p>He was obeyed.[215]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[215] Kerssenbroeck, Hast p. 366.</p>

  <p>Knipperdolling, left to cool in the dungeon, felt that his only chance of
  life was to submit. He therefore sent his humble apology to the king, and
  assured him that he had been possessed by an evil spirit, which had driven
  him, against his judgment and conscience, into revolt. "And," said he, "last
  night the Father revealed to me that one must venerate the royal majesty, and
  that John is destined to reign over the whole earth."</p>

  <p>He was at once released, for Bockelson needed him, and the failure of this
  attempt only secured the king's hold over him. He sent him a letter of
  pardon, concluding with the royal signature in this eccentric
  fashion:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"In fide persiste salvus Carnis curam agit Deus. Johannes Leydanus.
  Potentia Dei, robur meum."[216]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[216] Persist secure in Faith. God takes care of the
  Flesh. John of Leyden. The Power of God is my strength.</p>

  <p>Another event took place at Münster, which distracted the thoughts of the
  people from the events of the siege, and the attempt of Knipperdolling to
  dethrone the king.</p>

  <p>The prophet Dusentscheuer, on the same day, the 12th September, sought the
  King of Zion in his palace, and said to him with an inspired air, "This is
  the commandment of the Lord to me: Go and say unto the chief of Israel, that
  he shall prepare on the Mount Zion (that is, the cathedral square) a great
  supper for all Christian brethren and sisters, and after supper he shall
  commission the teachers of my Word to go forth to the four quarters of the
  world, that they may teach all men the way of my righteousness, and that they
  may be brought into my fold."</p>

  <p>The king accepted the message with respect, and gave orders for its
  immediate execution.</p>

  <p>On the 13th September, Dusentscheuer called together the elect, traversing
  the streets playing upon a flute. At noon 1700 men, capable of bearing arms,
  400 old men and children, and 5000 women assembled on Mount Zion.</p>

  <p>Bockelson left his palace, habited in a scarlet tunic over which was cast
  a cloth of silver mantle, on his head was his crown, and his sceptre was in
  his right hand. Thirty-two knights, magnificently dressed, served as his
  bodyguard. Then came Queen Divara and the rest of the wives of the court.</p>

  <p>When the king had taken his place, the Grand Marshal Tilbeck made the
  people sit down. Tables had been arranged along the sides of the great square
  under the trees, with an open space in the centre.</p>

  <p>When all were seated, the king and his familiars distributed food to those
  invited. They were given first boiled beef and roots, then ham with other
  vegetables, and finally roast meat. When the plates had been removed, thin
  round cakes of fine wheat flour were brought in large baskets, and John,
  calling the faithful up before him, communicated them with the bread, saying,
  "Take and eat this, and show forth the Lord's death." Divara followed,
  holding the chalice in her jewelled hands; she made the communicants drink
  from it, repeating the words to each, "Drink this, and show forth the Lord's
  death." Then all sang the <i>Gloria in excelsis</i> in German, and this
  fantastic parody of the communion was over. Bockelson now ordered all his
  subjects to arrange themselves in a circle, and he demanded if they would
  faithfully obey the Word of God. All having assented, Dusentscheuer mounted
  the pulpit and said, "The Father has revealed to me the names of twenty-seven
  apostles who are to be sent into every part of the world; they will spread
  everywhere the pure doctrine of the celestial kingdom, and the Lord will
  cover them with the shadow of His wings, so that not a hair of their head
  shall be injured. And when they shall arrive at a place where the authorities
  refuse to receive the Gospel, there they shall leave a florin in gold, they
  shall shake off the dust of their garments, and shall go to another place."
  Then the prophet designated the chosen apostles&mdash;he saw himself of the
  number&mdash;and he added, "Go ye into all the cities and preach the Word of
  God." The twenty-seven stepped forward, and the king, mounting the pulpit,
  exhorted the people to prepare for a grand sortie.[217]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[217] Kerssenbroeck, p. 86; Montfort., p. 34; Dorpius, f.

  Zeitung" at 4,000, f. 329. This authority adds that the communicants
  distributed the sacrament they had received amongst themselves saying,
  "Brother and sister, take and eat thereof. As Christ gave Himself for me, so
  will I give myself for thee. And as the corn-wheat is baked into one, and the
  grape branches are pressed into one, so we being many are one." Also, "Letter
  of the Bishop to the Electors of Cologne," <i>ibid.</i> p. 390.</p>

  <p>The banquet was over for the people; but John, his wives and court, and
  those who had been on guard upon the walls, to the number of 500, now sat
  down.</p>

  <p>The second banquet was much more costly than the first. In the midst of
  the feast, Bockelson, rising, said that he had received an order from the
  Father to go round and inspect the guests. He accordingly examined those
  present, and recognising amongst them a soldier of the Episcopal army, who
  had been made prisoner, he confronted him sternly, and asked&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Friend, what is thy faith?"</p>

  <p>"My faith," replied the soldier, who was half drunk, "is to drink and make
  love."</p>

  <p>"How didst thou dare to come in, not having on the wedding garment?" asked
  the king, in a voice of thunder.</p>

  <p>"I did not come of my own accord to this debauch,"[218] answered the
  prisoner; "I was brought here by main force."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[218] The expression used was somewhat
  broad&mdash;Hurenhochzeit.</p>

  <p>At these words, the king, transported with rage, drew his sword and smote
  off the head of the unfortunate reveller.</p>

  <p>The night was spent in dancing.[219]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[219] Kerssenbroeck, p. 88 <i>et seq.</i>; Heresbach, p.
  139; Dorp. f. 398.</p>

  <p>Whilst the king was eating and drinking, the twenty-seven apostles were
  taking a tender farewell of their 124 legitimate wives,[220] and making their
  preparations to depart.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[220] Evidence of Heinrich Graess. Dorpius says that the
  number of apostles was twenty-eight, and gives their names and the places to
  which they were sent, f. 398.</p>

  <p>When all was ready, they returned to Mount Zion; Bockelson ascended the
  pulpit, and gave them their mission in the following terms:&mdash;"Go,
  prepare the way; we will follow. Cast your florin of gold at the feet of
  those who despise you, that it may serve as a testimony against them, and
  they shall be slain, all the sort of them, or shall bow their necks to our
  rule."</p>

  <p>Then the gates were thrown open, and the apostles went forth, north and
  south, and east and west. The blockade was not complete, and they succeeded
  in traversing the lines of the enemy.</p>

  <p>However, the prince-bishop notified to the governors of the towns in his
  principality to watch them and arrest them, should they attempt to
  disseminate their peculiar doctrines.[221]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[221] Kerssenbroeck, p. 89 <i>et seq.</i>; Heresbach, pp.

  417-8; Hast, p. 368; "Historia v. d. Münst. Widerteuffer." p. 329 a.</p>

  <p>We shall have to follow these men, and see the results of their mission,
  before we continue the history of the siege of Münster. In fact, on their
  expedition and their success, as John Bockelson probably felt, everything
  depended. As soon as the city was completely enclosed no food could enter:
  already it was becoming scarce; therefore an attack on the Episcopal army
  from the flank was most essential to success; the palisades and ramparts
  recently erected sufficiently defending the enemy against surprises and
  sorties from the town.</p>

  <p>Seven of the apostles went to Osnabrück, six to Coesfeld, five to
  Warendorf, and eight, amongst whom was Dusentscheuer himself, betook
  themselves to Soest.[222]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[222] For the acts of these apostles, Kerssenbroeck, p.
  92 <i>et seq.</i>; Menck. p. 1574; Montfort., p. 36 <i>et seq.</i>; Sleidan,
  p. 418; Bullinger, lib. ii. c. 10; Heresbach, p. 149.</p>

  <p>On entering Soest, Dusentscheuer and his fellow-apostles opened their
  mission by a public frenzied appeal to repentance. Then, hearing that the
  senate had assembled, they entered the hall and preached to the city
  councillors in so noisy a fashion that the magistrates were obliged to
  suspend their deliberations. The burgomaster having asked them who they were,
  and why they entered the town-hall unsummoned and unannounced, "We are sent
  by the king of the New Zion, and by order of God to preach the Gospel," was
  the reply of Dusentscheuer; "and to execute this mission we need neither
  passports nor permission. The kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence, and the
  violent take it by storm." "Very well," said the burgomaster collectedly.
  "Guards, remove the preachers and throw them into prison." A few days after
  several of them lost their heads on the block.</p>

  <p>John Clopris, at the head of four evangelists, entered Warendorf. They
  took up their abode in the house of an Anabaptist named Erpo, one of the
  magistrates of the town, and began to preach and prophesy in the streets. The
  first day they rebaptised fifty persons. Clopris preached with such fervour
  and persuasive eloquence, that the whole town followed him; the senate
  received the sign of the covenant in a body, and this was followed by a
  rebaptism of half the population.</p>

  <p>Alarmed at what was taking place, and afraid of a diversion in his rear,
  Francis of Waldeck wrote to the magistrates ordering them to give up the
  apostles of error. They refused, and the prince at once invested the town and
  bombarded it. The magistrates sent offers of capitulation, which the prince
  rejected; they asked to retain their arms and their franchises. Francis of
  Waldeck insisted on unconditional surrender, and they were constrained to
  yield. Some of the senators and citizens who had repented of their craze, or
  who had taken no part in the movement, seized the apostles and conducted them
  to the town-hall. Clopris and his fellows cast down their florins of gold and
  declared that they shook off the dust of their feet against the traitors, and
  that they would carry the pure Word of God and the living Gospel elsewhere;
  but escape was not permitted, and they were delivered over to the
  prince-bishop.</p>

  <p>Francis of Waldeck at once placed sentinels in the streets, ordered every
  citizen to deliver up his weapons, took the title-deeds of the city, withdrew
  its franchises, and executed four of the apostles and three of the
  ringleaders of the senators. Clopris was sent to Cologne, and was burnt there
  on the 1st February, 1535, by the Elector. The bishop then raised a fortress
  to command the town, and placed in it a garrison to keep the Warendorfians in
  order. Seventeen years after, the greater part of the franchises were
  restored, and all the rest in 1555.</p>

  <p>The apostles of the east, under Julius Frisius, were arrested at Coesfeld,
  and were executed.[223]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[223] The "Newe Zeitung v. d. Widerteuffer. zu Münster,"
  f. 329 b, 330 a, gives a summary of the confessions of these men, and their
  account of the condition of affairs in the city. They said that every man
  there had five, six, seven, or eight wives, and that every girl over the age
  of twelve was forced to marry; that if one wife showed resentment against
  another, or jealousy, or complained, she was sentenced by the king to
  death.</p>

  <p>Those of the north reached Osnabrück. Denis Vinnius was at their head.
  They entered the house of a certain Otto Spiecher, whom they believed to be
  of their persuasion, and they laid at his feet their gold florins bearing the
  title and superscription of King John, as tokens of their mission. Spiecher
  picked up the gold pieces, pocketed them, and then informed his visitors that
  he did not belong to their sect, and that the only salvation for their necks
  would be reticence on the subject of their mission.</p>

  <p>But this was advice Vinnius and his fellow-fanatics were by no means
  disposed to accept. They ran forth into the streets and market-place,
  yelling, dancing, foaming, and calling to repentance. Then Vinnius, having
  collected a crowd, preached to them the setting up of the Millennial kingdom
  at Münster. Thereupon the city-guard arrived with orders from the
  burgomaster, arrested the missionaries, and carried them off to the
  Goat-tower, where they shut them in, and barred fast the doors.[224]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[224] Kerssenbroeck, p. 100 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>The rabble showed signs of violence, threatened, blustered, armed
  themselves with axes and hammers, and vowed they would batter open the
  prison-gates unless the true ministers of God's Word, pure from all human
  additions, were set at liberty. The magistrates replied with great firmness
  that the first man who attempted to force the doors should be shot, and no
  one caring to be the first man, though very urgent to his neighbours to lead
  the assault, the mob sang a psalm and dispersed, and the ministers were left
  to console themselves with the promises of Dusentscheuer that not a hair of
  their head should fall.</p>

  <p>A messenger was sent by the magistrates post haste to the prince-bishop,
  and before morning the evangelists were in his grasp at Iburg.</p>

  <p>As they were led past Francis of Waldeck, one of them, Heinrich Graess,
  exclaimed in Latin, "Has not the prince power to release the captive?" and
  the prince, disposed in his favour, sent for him. Graess then confessed that
  the whole affair was a mixture of fanaticism and imposture, the ingredients
  being mixed in pretty equal proportions, and promised, if his life were
  spared, to abandon Anabaptism, and, what was more to the point, to prove an
  Ahitophel to the Absalom in Zion.</p>

  <p>Graess was pardoned, Strahl died in prison, the other four were brought to
  the block.</p>

  <p>Graess was the sole surviving apostle of the seventy-seven, and the
  miserable failure of their mission had rudely shaken out of him all belief in
  its divine character, and he became as zealous in unmasking Anabaptism as he
  had been enthusiastic in its propagation.</p>

  <p>There is no reason to believe that the man was an unprincipled traitor. On
  the contrary, he appears to have been thoroughly in earnest as long as he
  believed in his mission, but his confidence had been shaken before he left
  the city, and the signal collapse of the mission sufficed to convince him of
  his previous error, and make him resolute to oppose it.</p>

  <p>Laden with chains, he was brought to the gates of Münster one dark night
  and there abandoned. In the morning he was recognised by the sentinels, and
  was brought into the city, and led in triumph before the king, by a vast
  concourse chanting German hymns.[225]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[225] Kerssenbroeck, p. 103 <i>et seq.</i>; Montfort.,
  pp. 40- 1; Hast p. 368.</p>

  <p>And thus he accounted for his presence:&mdash;"I was last night at Iburg
  in a dark dungeon, when suddenly a brilliant light filled my prison, and I
  saw before me an angel of God, who took me by the hand and led me forth, and
  delivered me from the death which has befallen all my companions, and which
  the ungodly determined to inflict on me upon the morrow. The angel
  transported me asleep to the gate of Münster, and that none may doubt my
  story, lo! the chains, wherewith I was laden by the enemies of Israel, still
  encumber me."</p>

  <p>Some of the courtiers doubted the miracle, but not so the people, and the
  king gave implicit credence to his word, or perhaps thought the event capable
  of a very simple explanation, which had been magnified and rendered
  supernatural by the heated fancy of the mystic.</p>

  <p>Graess became the idol of the people and the favourite of Bockelson. The
  king passed a ring upon his finger, and covered him with a robe of
  distinction, half grey, half green&mdash;the first the symbol of persistence,
  the other typical of gratitude to God.[226] Graess profited by his position
  to closely observe all that transpired of the royal schemes.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[226] Montfort., p. 40.</p>

  <p>John Bockelson became more and more tyrannical and sanguinary. He hung a
  starving child, aged ten, for having stolen some turnips. A woman lost her
  head for having spit in the face of a preacher of the Gospel. An Episcopal
  soldier having been taken, the king exhorted him to embrace the pure Word of
  God, freed from the traditions of men. The prisoner having had the audacity
  to reply that the pure Gospel as practised in the city seemed to him to be
  adultery, fornication, and all uncleanness; the king, foaming with rage,
  hacked off his head with his own hand.[227]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[227] Kerssenbroeck, p. 110.</p>

  <p>Provisions became scarce in Münster, and the inhabitants were driven to
  consume horse-flesh; and the powder ran short in the magazine.</p>

  <p>The Diet of Coblenz assembled on the 13th December. The envoys of the
  Elector Palatine, the prince-bishops of Maintz, Cologne, and of Trier, the
  princes and nobles of the Upper and Lower Rhine and of Westphalia appeared.
  Francis of Waldeck, unable to be present in person, sent deputies to
  represent him.[228]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[228] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 114.</p>

  <p>These deputies having announced that the cost of the siege had already
  amounted to 700,000 florins, besought the assembled princes to combine to
  terminate this disastrous war. A long deliberation followed, and the
  principle was admitted that as the establishment of an Anabaptist kingdom in
  Münster would be a disaster affecting the whole empire, it was just that the
  bishop should not be obliged to bear the whole expenses of the reduction of
  Münster. The Elector John Frederick of Saxony, though not belonging to the
  three circles convoked, through his deputies sent to the Diet, promised to
  take part in the extirpation of the heretics.[229] It was finally agreed that
  the bishop should be supplied with 300 horse soldiers, 3000 infantry, and
  that an experienced General, Count Ulrich von Ueberstein, should command them
  and take the general conduct of the war.[230]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[229] <i>Ibid.</i>; Sleidan, p. 419; Heresbach, p.
  132.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[230] Sleidan, p. 419.</p>

  <p>The monthly subsidy of 15,000 florins was also promised to be contributed
  till the fall of Münster. It was also agreed that the prince-bishop should be
  guaranteed the integrity of his domains; that each prince, Catholic or
  Protestant, should use his utmost endeavours to extirpate Anabaptism from his
  estates; that the Bishop of Münster should request Ferdinand, King of the
  Romans, and the seven Electors, to meet on the 4th April, at Worms, to
  consult with those then assembled at Worms on measures to crush the
  rebellion, to divide the cost of the war, and to punish the leaders of the
  revolt at Münster.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the Diet addressed a letter to the guilty city, summoning it to
  surrender at discretion, unless it were prepared to resist the combined
  effort of all estates of the empire.</p>

  <p>But if the princes were combining against the Anabaptist New Jerusalem,
  the sectarians were in agitation, and were arming to march to its relief from
  all sides, from Leyden, Freisland, Amsterdam, Deventer, from Brabant and
  Strassburg.</p>

  <p>The Anabaptists of Deventer were on the point of rising and massacring the
  "unbelievers" in this city, and then marching on Münster, when the plot was
  discovered, and the four ringleaders were executed. The vigilance of the
  Regent of the Netherlands prevented the adherents of the mystic sect, who
  were then very numerous, from rolling in a wave upon Westphalia, and sweeping
  the undisciplined Episcopal army away and consolidating the power of their
  pontiff-king.</p>

  <p>It was towards the Low Countries that John of Leyden looked with
  impatience. When would the expected delivery come out of the west? Why were
  not the thousands and tens of thousands of the sons of Israel rising from
  their fens, joined by trained bands from the cities, marching by the light of
  blazing cities, singing the songs of Zion?</p>

  <p>Graess offered the king to hie to the Low Countries and rouse the faithful
  seed. "The Father," said he, "has ordered me to gather together the brethren
  dispersed at Wesel, at Deventer, at Amsterdam, and in Lower Germany; to form
  of them a mighty army that shall deliver this city and smite asunder the
  enemies of Israel. I will accomplish this mission with joy in the interest of
  the faithful. I fear no danger, since I go to fulfil the will of God, and I
  am sure that our brethren, when they know our extremity, and that it is the
  will of their king, will rise and hasten to the relief."[231]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[231] Montfort., p. 40; Kerssenbroeck, p. 104 <i>et
  seq.</i>; Hast, p. 368.</p>

  <p>John Bockelson was satisfied; he furnished Graess with letters of credit,
  sealed with the royal signet. The letters were couched in the following
  terms:&mdash;"We, John, King of Righteousness in the new Temple, and servant
  of the Most High, do you to wit by these presents, that the bearer of these
  letters, Heinrich Graess, prophet illumined by the celestial Father, is sent
  by us to assemble, for the increase of our realm, our brethren dispersed
  abroad throughout the German lands. He will make them to hear the words of
  life, and he will execute the commandments which he has received from God and
  from us. We therefore order and demand of all those who belong to our kingdom
  to confide in him as in ourselves. Given at Münster, city of God, and sealed
  with our signet, in the twenty-sixth year of our age and the second of our
  reign, the second day of the first month, in the year 1535 after the nativity
  of Jesus Christ, Son of God."</p>

  <p>Graess, furnished with this letter and with 300 florins from the treasury,
  left the city, and betook himself direct to Iburg, which he reached on the
  vigil of the Epiphany;[232] and appeared before the bishop, told him the
  whole project, the names of the principal members of the sect at Wesel,
  Amsterdam, Leyden, &amp;c., the places where their arms were deposited, and
  their plan of a general rising and massacring their enemies on a preconcerted
  day.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[232] Montfort., p. 40.</p>

  <p>The bishop sent dispatches at once to the Duke of Juliers and the
  Governors of the Low Countries to warn them to be on their guard. They
  replied, requesting his assistance in suppressing the insurrection; and as
  the most effectual aid he could render would be to send Graess, he
  commissioned him to visit Wesel, and arrest the execution of the project.</p>

  <p>Graess at once betook himself to Wesel, where he denounced the ringleaders
  and indicated the places where their arms and ammunition were secreted in
  enormous quantities. A tumult broke out; but the Duke of Juliers entered
  Wesel on the 5th April (1535), at the head of some squadrons of cavalry,
  seized the ringleaders, who were members of the principal houses in the place
  and of the senate, and on the 13th executed six of them. The rest were
  compelled to do penance in white sheets, were deprived of their arms, and put
  under close surveillance.</p>

  <p>Another division of the Anabaptists attempted to gain possession of
  Leyden, but were discomfited, fifteen of the principal men of the party were
  executed, and five of the women most distinguished for their fanaticism were
  drowned, amongst whom was the original wife of John Bockelson.[233]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[233] Hast, p. 370; Bussierre, p. 403.</p>

  <p>In Gröningen, the partisans of the sect were numerous; orders reached them
  from the king to rise and massacre the magistrates, and march to the relief
  of the invested city. As the Anabaptists there were not all disposed to
  recognise the royalty of John of Leyden, an altercation broke out between
  them, and the attempt failed; but rising and marching under Peter Shomacker,
  their prophet, they were defeated on January 24th, by the Baron of
  Leutenburg, and the prophet was executed.</p>

  <p>We must now return to what took place in the town of Münster at the
  opening of the year 1535.</p>

  <p>Bockelson inaugurated that year by publishing, on January 2nd, an edict in
  twenty-eight Articles. It was addressed "To all lovers of the Truth and the
  Divine Righteousness, learned in and ignorant of the mysteries of God, to let
  them know how those Christians ought to live or act who are fighting under
  the banner of Justice, as true Israelites of the new Temple predestined for
  long ages, announced by the mouths of all the holy prophets, founded in the
  power of the Holy Ghost, by Christ and his Apostles, and finally established
  by John, the righteous King, seated on the throne of David."</p>

  <p>The Articles were to this effect:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"1. In this new temple there was to be only one king to rule over the
  people of God.</p>

  <p>2. This king was to be a minister of righteousness, and to bear the sword
  of justice.</p>

  <p>3. None of the subjects were to desert their allotted places.</p>

  <p>4. None were to interpret Holy Scripture wrongfully.</p>

  <p>5. Should a prophet arise teaching anything contrary to the plain letter
  of Holy Scripture, he was to be avoided.</p>

  <p>6. Drunkenness, avarice, fornication, and adultery were forbidden.</p>

  <p>7. Rebellion to be punished with death.</p>

  <p>8. Duels to be suppressed.</p>

  <p>9. Calumny forbidden.</p>

  <p>10. Egress from the camp forbidden without permission.</p>

  <p>11. Any one absenting himself from his wife for three days, without leave
  from his officer, the wife to take another husband.</p>

  <p>12. Approaching the enemy's sentinels without leave forbidden.</p>

  <p>13. All violence forbidden among the elect.</p>

  <p>14. Spoil taken from the enemy to go into a common fund.</p>

  <p>15. No renegade to be re-admitted.</p>

  <p>16. Caution to be observed in admitting a Christian into one society who
  leaves another.</p>

  <p>17. Converts not to be repelled.</p>

  <p>18. Any desiring to live at peace with the Christians, in trade,
  friendship, and by treaty, not to be rejected.</p>

  <p>19. Permission given to dealers and traders to traffic with the elect.</p>

  <p>20. No Christian to oppose and revolt against any Gentile magistrate,
  except the servants of the bishops and the monks.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[234] Kerssenbroeck, p. 132 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>The object Bockelson had in view in issuing this edict was to produce a
  diversion in his favour among the Lutherans. He already felt the danger he
  was in, from a coalescence of Catholics and Protestants, and he hoped by
  temperate proclamations and protestations of his adhesion to the Bible, and
  the Bible only, as his authority, to dispose them, if not to make common
  cause with him, at least to withdraw their assistance from the common enemy,
  the Catholic bishop.</p>

  <p>For the same object he sent letters on the 13th January to the Landgrave
  of Hesse, and with them a book called "The Restitution" (Von der
  Wiederbringung), intended to place Anabaptism in a favourable light.[235]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[235] Kerssenbroeck, p. 128; Sleidan, p. 420; Hast, p.
  373 <i>et seq.</i>; "Acta, Handlungen," &amp;c., f. 365 b. The king's letter
  began "Leve Lips" ("Dear Phil").</p>

  <p>The Landgrave replied at length, rebuking the fanatics for their
  rebellion, for their profligacy, and for their heresy in teaching that man
  had a free will.[236]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[236] Sleidan, p. 421.</p>

  <p>This reply irritated the Anabaptists, and they wrote to him again, to
  prove that they clave to the pure Word of God, freed from all doctrines and
  traditions of men, and that they followed the direct inspiration of God
  through their prophet. They also retorted on Philip with some effect. The
  Landgrave, said they, had no right to censure them for attacking their
  bishop, for he had done precisely the same in his own dominions. He had
  expelled all the religious from their convents, and had appropriated their
  lands; he had re-established the Duke of Wurtemburg in opposition to the will
  of the Emperor; he had changed the religion of his subjects, and was unable
  to allege, as his authority for thus acting, the direct orders of Heaven,
  transmitted to him by the prophets of the living God. They might have
  retorted upon the Landgrave also, the charge of immorality, but they forbore;
  their object was to persuade the champion of the Protestant cause to favour
  them, not to exasperate him by driving the <i>tu quoque</i> too deep
  home.</p>

  <p>With this letter was sent a treatise by Rottmann, entitled, "On the Secret
  Significance of Scripture."</p>

  <p>Philip of Hesse wavered. He wrote once more; and after having attempted to
  excuse himself for those things wherewith he had been reproached, he said,
  "If the thing depended on me only, you would not have to plead in vain your
  <i>just</i> cause, and you would obtain all that you demand; but you ought
  ere this to have addressed the princes of the empire, instead of taking the
  law into your own hands; flying to arms, erecting a kingdom, electing a king,
  and sending prophets and apostles abroad to stir up the towns and the people.
  Nevertheless, it is possible that even now your demands may be favourably
  listened to, if you recall on equitable conditions those whom you have driven
  out of the town and despoiled of their goods, and restore your ancient
  constitutions and your former authorities."[237]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[237] Kerssenbroeck, p. 129; Sleidan, p. 421.</p>

  <p>Luther now thundered out of Wittemberg. Sleidan epitomises this treatise.
  Five Hessian ministers also issued an answer to the doctrine of the
  Anabaptists of Münster, which was probably drawn up for them by Luther
  himself, or was at least submitted to him for his approval, for it is
  published among his German works.[238] It is full of invective and argument
  in about equal doses. A passage or two only can be quoted here:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Since you are led astray by the devil into such blasphemous error, drunk
  and utterly imprisoned you wish, as is Satan's way, to make yourselves into
  angels of light, and to paint in brightness and colour your devilish doings.
  For the devil will be no devil, but a holy angel, yea, even God himself, and
  his works, however bad they may be before God and all the world, he will have
  unrebuked, and himself be honoured and reverenced as the Most Holy. For that
  purpose he and you, his obedient disciples, use Holy Scripture as all
  heretics have ever done."[239]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[238] Luth. "Sämmtliche Werke," Wittenb. 1545-51, ii. ff.
  367-375; "Von der Teuffelischen Secte d. Widerteuffer. zu Münster."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[239] <i>Ibid.</i> f. 367.</p>

  <p>"What shall I say? You let all the world see that you understand far less
  about the kingdom of Christ than did the Jews, who blame you for your want of
  understanding, and yet none spoke or believed more ignorantly of that same
  kingdom than they. For the Scripture and the prophets point to Messiah,
  through whom all was to be fulfilled, and this the Jews also believed. But
  you want to make it point to your Tailor-King, to the great disgrace and
  mockery of Christ, our only true King, Saviour, and Redeemer."[240]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[240] <i>Ibid.</i> f. 369.</p>

  <p>But this was the grievous rub with the Reformer&mdash;that the Anabaptist
  had gone a step beyond himself. "You have cast away all that Dr. Martin
  Luther taught you, and yet it is from him that you have received, next to
  God, all sound learning out of the Scripture; you have given another
  definition of faith, after your new fashion, with various additional
  articles, so that you have not only darkened, but have utterly annihilated
  the value of saving faith."[241]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[241] <i>Ibid.</i> f. 373.</p>

  <p>In a treatise of Justus Menius, published with Luther's approval, and with
  a preface by him, "On the Spirit of the Anabaptists," it is angrily
  complained, that these sectaries bring against the Lutheran Church the
  following charges:&mdash;"First, that our churches are idol-temples, since
  God dwelleth not in temples made with hands. Secondly, that we do not preach
  the truth, and have true Divine worship therein. Thirdly, that our preachers
  are sinners, and are therefore unfit to teach others. Fourthly, that the
  common people do not mend their morals by our preaching." All which charges
  Justus Menius answers as well as he can, sword in one hand against the
  Papists, trowel in the other patching up the walls of his Jerusalem.[242]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[242] <i>Ibid.</i> ii. ff. 298-325.</p>

  <p>Melancthon also wrote against the Anabaptist book, combating all its
  propositions, and to do so falling back on the maxim, <i>Abusus non tollit
  substantiam</i>, a maxim completely ignored by the Reformers when they
  attacked the Catholics.[243] Thus the new sect fought Lutheranism with
  precisely the same weapons wherewith the Lutherans had fought the Church; and
  the Lutherans, to maintain their ground, were obliged to take refuge in the
  authority of the Church and tradition&mdash;positions they had assailed
  formerly, and to use arguments they had previously rejected.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[243] <i>Ibid.</i> ii. ff. 334-363. Melancthon says that
  things had come to such a pass in Münster, that no child knew who was its
  father, brother, or sister.</p>

  <p>In the treatise of the five Hessian divines, drawn up by Philip of Hesse's
  orders, the errors of the Anabaptists are epitomised and condemned; they are
  as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"1. They do not believe that men are justified by faith only, but by faith
  and works conjointly.</p>

  <p>2. They refer the redemption of Christ alone to the fall of Adam, and to
  its consequences on those born of him.</p>

  <p>3. They hold community of goods.</p>

  <p>4. They blame Martin Luther as having taught nothing about good works.</p>

  <p>5. They proclaim the freedom of man's will.</p>

  <p>6. They reject infant baptism.</p>

  <p>7. They take the Bible alone, uninterpreted by any commentary.</p>

  <p>8. They declare for plurality of wives.</p>

  <p>9. They do not correctly teach the Incarnation of Christ."[244]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[244] "Acta Handlung." &amp;c. f. 366 a.</p>

  <p>This "Kurtze: und in der eile gestelte Antwort," is signed by John Campis,

  <p>It was high time that the siege should come to an end, so every one said;
  but every one had said the same for the last twelve months, and Münster held
  out notwithstanding.</p>

  <p>An ultimatum was sent into the city by the general in command, offering
  the inhabitants liberal terms if they would surrender, and warning them that,
  in case of refusal, the city would be taken by storm, and would be delivered
  over to plunder.[245] No answer was made to the letter; nevertheless, it
  produced a profound impression on the citizens, who were already suffering
  from want of victuals. A party was formed which resolved to seize the person
  of the king, and to open the gates and make terms with the bishop.[246]
  Bockelson, hearing of the plot, assembled the whole of the population in the
  cathedral square, and solemnly announced to them by revelation from the
  Father that at Easter the siege would be raised, and the city experience a
  wonderful deliverance. He also divided the town into twelve portions, and
  placed at the head of each a duke of his own creation, charged with the
  suppression of treason and the protection of the gates. Each duke was
  provided with twenty-four guards for the defence of his person, and the
  infliction of punishment on those citizens who proved restive under the rule
  of the King of Zion.[247] These dukes were promised the government of the
  empire, when the kingdoms of Germany became the kingdom of John of Leyden.
  Denecker, a grocer, was Duke of Saxony; Moer, the tailor, Duke of Brunswick;
  the Kerkerings were appointed to reign over Westphalia; Redecker, the
  cobbler, to bear rule in Juliers and Cleves. John Palk was created Duke of
  Guelders and Utrecht; Edinck was to be supreme in Brabant and Holland; Faust,
  a coppersmith, in Mainz and Cologne; Henry Kock was to be Duke of Trier;
  Ratterberg to be Duke of Bremen, Werden, and Minden; Reininck took his title
  from Hildesheim and Magdeburg; and Nicolas Strip from Frisia and Gröningen.
  As these men were for the most part butchers, blacksmiths, tailors, and
  shoemakers, their titles, ducal coronets and mantles, and the prospect of
  governing, turned their heads, and made them zealous tools in the hands of
  Bockelson.</p>

  <p>The king made one more attempt to rouse the country. He issued letters
  offering the pillage of the whole world to all those who would join the
  standard. But the bishop was informed of the preparation of these missives by
  a Danish soldier in Münster; he was much alarmed, as his
  <i>lantzknechts</i>were ready to sell their services to the highest bidder.
  He therefore pressed on the circumvallation of the city, kept a vigilant
  guard, and captured every emissary sent forth to distribute these tempting
  offers. On the 11th February, 1535, the moat, mound, and palisade around the
  city were complete; and it was thenceforth impossible for access to or egress
  from the city to be effected without the knowledge of the prince and his
  generals. The unfortunate people of Münster discovered attempting to escape
  were by the king's orders decapitated. Many men and women perished thus;
  amongst them was a mistress of Knipperdolling named Dreyer, who, weary of her
  life, fled, but was caught and delivered over to the executioner. When her
  turn came, the headsman hesitated. Knipperdolling, perceiving it, took from
  him the sword, and without changing colour smote off her head. "The Father,"
  said he, "irresistibly inspired me to this, and I have thus become, without
  willing it or knowing it, an instrument of vengeance in the hands of the
  Lord."[248]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[248] Kerssenbroeck, p. 148.</p>

  <p>The legitimate wife of Knipperdolling, for having disparaged polygamy,
  escaped death with difficulty; she was sentenced to do public penance,
  kneeling in the great square, in the midst of the people, with a naked sword
  in her hands.[249]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[249] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 149.</p>

  <p>Easter came, the time of the promised delivery, and the armies of the
  faithful from Holland and Friesland and Brabant had not arrived. The position
  of Bockelson became embarrassing. He extricated himself from the dilemma with
  characteristic effrontery. During six days he remained in his own house,
  invisible to every one. At the expiration of the time he issued forth,
  assembled the people on Mount Zion, and informed them that the deliverance
  predicted of the Father <i>had</i> taken place, but that it was a deliverance
  different in kind from what they had anticipated. "The Father," said he, "has
  laid on my shoulders the iniquities of the Israelites. I have been bowed down
  under their burden, and was well-nigh crushed beneath their weight. Now, by
  the grace of the Lord, health has been restored to me, and you have been all
  released from your sins. This spiritual deliverance is the most excellent of
  all, and must precede that which is purely exterior and temporal. Wait,
  therefore, patiently, it is promised and it will arrive, if you do not fall
  back into your sins, but maintain your confidence in God, who never deserts
  His chosen people, though He may subject them to trials and tribulations, to
  prove their constancy."[250] One would fain believe that John Bockelson was
  in earnest, and the subject of religious infatuation, like his subjects, but
  after this it is impossible to so regard him.</p>

  <p>The princes, when separating after the assembly of Coblenz, had agreed to
  reassemble on the 4th of April. Ferdinand, King of the Romans, convoked all
  the Estates of the empire to meet on that day at Worms. The deputies of
  several towns protested against the decisions taken at Coblenz without their
  participation, and the deliberations were at the outset very tumultuous. An
  understanding was at length arrived at, and a monthly subsidy of 20,000
  florins for five months was agreed upon, to maintain the efficacy of the
  investment of Münster. But before separating, a final effort to obtain a
  pacific termination to the war was resolved upon, and the burgomasters of
  Frankfort and Nürnberg were sent as a deputation into the city. This attempt
  proved as sterile as all those previously essayed. "We have nothing in common
  with the Roman empire," answered the chiefs of Zion; "for that empire is the
  fourth beast whereof Daniel prophesied. We have set up again the kingdom of
  Israel, by the Father's command, and we engage you to abstain for the future
  from assailing this realm, as you fear the wrath of God and eternal
  damnation."[251]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[251] Kerssenbroeck, p. 155; Hast, 394.</p>

  <p>The famine in Münster now became terrible. Cats, rats, dogs, and horses
  were eaten; the starving people attempted various expedients to satisfy their
  craving hunger. They ate leather, wood, even cow-dung dried in the sun, the
  bark of trees, and candles. Corpses lately buried were dug up during the
  night and secretly devoured. Mothers even ate their children. "Terrible
  maladies," says Kerssenbroeck, "the consequence of famine, aggravated the
  position of the inhabitants of the town; their flesh decomposed, they rotted
  living, their skin became livid, their lips retreated; their eyes, fixed and
  round, seemed ready to start out of their orbits; they wandered about,
  haggard, hideous, like mummies, and died by hundreds in the streets. The
  king, to prevent infection, had the bodies cast into large common ditches,
  whence the starving withdrew them furtively to devour them. Night and day the
  houses and streets re-echoed with tears, cries, and moans;&mdash;men, women,
  old men, and children sank into the darkest despair."[252]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[252] Kerssenbroeck, p. 157 <i>et seq.</i>; Heresbach,
  pp. 151, 152; Hast, p. 395; Montfort., p. 46.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the general famine, John of Leyden lived in abundance. His
  storehouses, into which the victuals found in every house had been collected,
  supplied his own table and that of his immediate followers. His revelry and
  pomp were unabated, whilst his deluded subjects died of want around
  him.[253]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[253] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 157.</p>

  <p>When starvation was at its worst, a letter from Heinrich Graess circulated
  in the town, informing the people that his miraculous escape had been a
  fable, and that he had rejected the follies of Anabaptism, disgusted at the
  extravagance to which it had led its votaries, and assuring them that their
  king was an impostor, exploiting to his advantage the credulity of an
  infatuated mob.[254]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[254] Montfort., p. 47.</p>

  <p>This letter produced an effect which made the king tremble. He summoned
  his disciples before him, reproached them for putting the hand to the plough
  and turning back, and gave leave to all those whose faith wavered to go out
  from the city. "As for me," said he, "I shall remain here, even if I remain
  alone with the angels which the Father will not fail to send to aid me to
  defend this place."[255]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[255] Kerssenbroeck, p. 161.</p>

  <p>When the king had given permission to leave the city, numbers of every age
  and sex poured through the gates, leaving behind only the most fanatical who
  were resolved to conquer or die with John of Leyden.</p>

  <p>Outside the city walls extended a trampled and desolate tract to the fosse
  and earthworks of the besiegers, strewn with the ruins of houses and of
  farmsteads. The unfortunate creatures escaping from Zion, wasted and haggard
  like spectres, spread over this devastated region. The investing army drove
  them back towards the city, unwilling to allow the rebels to protract the
  siege by disembarrassing themselves of all the useless mouths in the place.
  They refused, however, to re-enter the walls, and remained in the Königreich,
  as this desert tract was called, to the number of 900, living on roots and
  grass, for four weeks, lying on the bare earth. Some were too feeble to walk,
  and crawled about on all fours; their hunger was so terrible that they filled
  their mouths with sand, earth, or leaves, and died choked, in terrible
  convulsions. Night and day their moans, howls, and cries ascended. The
  children presented a yet more deplorable spectacle; they implored their
  mothers to give them something to eat, and they, poor creatures, could only
  answer them with tears and sobs; often they approached the lines of the camp,
  and sought to excite the compassion of the soldiers.</p>

  <p>The General in command, Graff Ueberstein, sent information, on April 22nd,
  to the bishop, who was ill in his castle at Wollbeck, and asked what was to
  be done with these unfortunates who were perishing in the Königreich. The
  bishop shed tears, and protested his sorrow at the sufferings of the poor
  wretches, but did not venture to give orders for their removal, without
  consulting the Duke of Cleves and the Elector of Cologne. Thus much precious
  time was lost, and only on the 28th May, a month after, were the starving
  wretches permitted to leave the Königreich, upon the following terms: 1st.
  That they should be transported to the neighbouring town of Diekhausen, where
  they should be examined, and those who were guilty among them executed; 2nd.
  That the rest should be pardoned and dispersed in different places, after
  having undertaken to renounce Anabaptism, and to abstain from negotiations,
  open or secret, with their comrades in the beleagured city.[256] These
  conditions having been made, the refugees were transported on tumbrils and in
  carts to Diekhausen, at a foot's pace, their excessive exhaustion rendering
  them incapable of bearing more rapid motion. They numbered 200; 700 had
  perished of famine between the lines of the investing army and the walls of
  the besieged town. On the 30th May, those found guilty of prominent
  participation in the revolt were executed.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[256] Kerssenbroeck, pp. 161-8.</p>

  <p>The prince-bishop might have spared his tears and sent loaves. His
  hesitation and want of genuine sympathy with the starving unfortunates serve
  to mark his character as not only weak, but selfish and cowardly.</p>

  <p>Whilst this was taking place outside the walls of Münster, John van Gheel,
  an emissary of Bockelson, was actively engaged in rousing the Anabaptists of
  Amsterdam. Having insinuated himself into the good graces of the Princess
  Mary, regent of the Netherlands, he persuaded her that he was desirous of
  restraining the sectaries waiting their call to march to the relief of
  Münster. She even furnished him with an authorisation to raise troops for
  this purpose. He profited by this order to arm his friends and lay a plot for
  obtaining the mastery of Amsterdam. His design was to make that city a place
  of rendezvous for all the Anabaptists of the Low Countries, who would flock
  into it as a city of refuge, when once it was in his power, and then he would
  be able to organise out of them an army sufficiently numerous and well
  appointed to raise the siege of Münster.</p>

  <p>On the 11th May he placed himself at the head of 600 friends, seized on
  the town, massacred half the guards, and one of the burgomasters. Amsterdam
  would inevitably have been in the power of the sectaries in another hour, had
  not one of the guard escaped up the tower and rung the alarm-bell. As the
  tocsin pealed over the city, the citizens armed and rushed to the
  market-place, fell upon the Anabaptists and retook the town-hall,
  notwithstanding a desperate resistance. Crowds of fanatics from the country,
  who had received secret intimation to assemble before the walls of Amsterdam,
  and wait till the gates were opened to admit them, finding that the plan had
  been defeated, threw away their arms and fled with precipitation.[257]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[257] Kerssenbroeck, pp. 73, 74; Hast, p. 37; Montfort.,
  p. 58 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>Van Gheel had fallen in the encounter. The prisoners were executed.
  Amongst these was Campé whom John of Leyden had created Anabaptist bishop of
  Amsterdam. His execution was performed with great barbarity; first his
  tongue, then his hand, and finally his head was cut off.[258]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[258] Montfort., pp. 68, 69.</p>

  <p>We must look once more into the doomed city.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the general desolation John Bockelson and his court lived
  in splendour and luxury. Every one who murmured against his excesses was
  executed. Heads were struck off on the smallest charge, and scarcely a day
  passed in May and June without blood flowing on Mount Zion. One of the most
  remarkable of these executions was that of Elizabeth Wandtscherer, one of the
  queens.</p>

  <p>This woman had had three husbands; the first was dead, the second marriage
  had been annulled, and Bockelson had taken her to wife because she was pretty
  and well made.</p>

  <p>She was a great favourite with her royal husband, and for six months she
  seemed to be delighted with her position; but at length, disgusted with the
  unbridled licence of the royal harem, the hypocrisy and the mad revelry of
  the court, contrasted with the famine of the citizens, a prey to remorse, she
  tore off her jewels and her queenly robes, and asked John of Leyden
  permission to leave the city. This was on the 12th June. The king, furious at
  an apostacy in his own house, dragged her into the market-place, and there in
  the presence of his wives and the populace, smote off her head with his own
  hands, stamped on her body, and then chanting the "Gloria in excelsis" with
  his queens, danced round the corpse weltering in its blood.[259]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[259] Kerssenbroeck, pp. 176-7; Dorpius, f. 498 b;
  Sleidan, p. 422, says she was executed for having observed to some of her
  companions that it could not be the will of God that they should live in
  abundance whilst the subjects perished from want of necessaries. Hast, p.
  395; Heresbach, p. 145.</p>

  <p>However, the royal magazines were now nearly exhausted, and the king was
  informed that there remained provisions for only a few days. He resolved to
  carry on his joyous life of debauchery without thought of the morrow, and
  when all was expended, to fire the city in every quarter, and then to rush
  forth, arms in hand, and break through the investing girdle, or perish in the
  attempt.[260] This project was not executed, for the siege was abruptly ended
  before the moment had arrived for its accomplishment.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[260] Kerssenbroeck, p. 177.</p>

  <p>Late in the preceding year, a soldier of the Episcopal army, John Eck, of
  Langenstraten, or, as he was called from his diminutive stature, Hansel Eck,
  having been punished as he deemed excessively or unjustly for some
  dereliction in his duty, deserted to the Anabaptists, and found an asylum in
  the city, where John Bockelson, perceiving his abilities and practical
  acquaintance with military operations, made him one of his captains.</p>

  <p>But Hansel soon repented bitterly this step he had taken. Little men are
  proverbially peppery and ready to stand on their dignity. His desertion had
  been the result of an outburst of wounded self-pride, and when his wrath
  cooled down, and his judgment obtained the upper hand, he was angry with
  himself for what he had done. Feeling confident that the city must eventually
  fall, and knowing that small mercies would be shown to a deserter caught in
  arms, however insignificant he might be in stature, Hansel took counsel with
  eight other discontented soldiers in his company, and they resolved to escape
  from Münster and ask pardon of the bishop.</p>

  <p>They effected the first part of their object on the night of the 17th
  June, and crossed the Königreich towards the lines of the investing force.
  The sentinels, observing a party of armed men advancing, with the moon
  flashing from their morions and breastplates, fired on them and killed seven.
  His diminutive stature stood Hansel in good stead, and he, with one other
  named Sobb, succeeded in escalading the ramparts unobserved, and in making
  their way to the nearest fort of Hamm, where the old officer, Meinhardt von
  Hamm, under whom he had formerly served, was in command. Hansel and Sobb were
  conducted into his presence, and offered to deliver the city into the hands
  of the prince-bishop if he would accord them a free pardon; but they added
  that no time must be lost, as it was but a question of hours rather than of
  days before the city was fired, and the final sortie was executed.[261]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[261] Kerssenbroeck, p. 179 <i>et seq.</i>; Sleidan, p.
  427; Montfort., p. 71; Heresbach, p. 162 <i>et seq.</i>; Hast, p. 395 <i>et
  seq.</i>; Dorpius, f. 499.</p>

  <p>Meinhardt listened to his plan, approved of it, and wrote to Francis of
  Waldeck, asking a safe-conduct for Hansel, and urging the utmost secrecy, as
  on the preservation of the secret depended the success of the scheme.</p>

  <p>The safe-conduct was readily granted, and the deserter was brought to
  Willinghegen concealed amidst game in a cart covered with boughs of trees.
  Willinghegen is a small place one mile outside the circumvallation. The
  chiefs of the besieging army met here to consider the plan of Hansel Eck. The
  little man protested that with 300 men he could take the city. He knew the
  weak points, and he could escalade the walls where they were unguarded. Four
  hundred soldiers were, however, decided to be sent on the expedition, under
  the command of Wilkin Steding, "a terrible enemy but a devoted friend;" John
  of Twickel was to be standard-bearer, and Hansel was to act as guide; and the
  attempt was to be made on the eve of St. John the Baptist's day.[262]
  However, the bishop and Count Ueberstein, desirous of avoiding unnecessary
  effusion of blood, summoned the inhabitants to surrender, for the last time,
  on the 22nd June.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[262] Kerssenbroeck, p. 169; and the authors before
  cited.</p>

  <p>Rottmann replied to the deputies that "the city should be surrendered only
  when they received the order to do so from the Father by a revelation."</p>

  <p>Midsummer eve was a hot, sultry day. Towards evening dark heavy clouds
  rolled up against the wind, and a violent storm of thunder, lightning, and
  hail burst over the doomed city. The sentinels of Münster, exhausted by
  hunger, and alarmed at the rage of the elements, quitted their posts and
  retreated under shelter. The darkness, the growl of the wind, and the boom of
  the thunder concealed the approach of the Episcopal troops. The 400, under
  Steding, guided by the deserter, marched into the Königreich between ten and
  eleven o'clock, and met with no obstacles till they reached the Holy-cross
  Gate. Here they filled the ditch with faggots, trees, and bundles of straw; a
  bridge was improvised, the curtain of palisades masking the bastion was
  surmounted, ladders were planted, and without meeting with the least
  resistance, the 400 reached the summit of the walls. The sentinels, whom they
  found asleep, were killed, with the exception of one who purchased his life
  by giving up the pass-word, "Die Erde." The soldiers then advanced along the
  paved road which lay between the double walls, captured and killed the
  sentinels at every watch tower, and then, entering the streets, crossed the
  cemetery of Ueberwasser, the River Aa by its bridge, and debouched on the
  cathedral square, where the faint flashes of the retreating lightning
  illumined at intervals the gaunt scaffolding of the throne and gallery and
  pulpit of the Anabaptist king, looking now not unlike the preparations for an
  execution.</p>

  <p>The cathedral had been converted into the arsenal. Hansel led the
  Episcopal soldiers to the western gates, gave the word "Die Erde," and the
  guards were killed before they could give the alarm. The artillery was now in
  the hands of the 400.[263]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[263] Kerssenbroeck, p. 176 <i>et seq.</i>; and the
  authors before cited.</p>

  <p>The Anabaptists had slept through the rumble of the thunder, but suddenly
  the rattle of the drum on their hill of Zion woke them with a start. They
  sprang from their beds, armed in haste, and rushed to the cathedral square,
  where their own cannons opened on them their mouths of fire, and poured an
  iron shower down the main thoroughfares which led from the Minster green. But
  they were not discouraged. Through backways, and under the shelter of the
  surrounding houses, they reached the Chapel of St. Michael, which commanded
  the position of the Episcopal soldiers, and thence fired upon them with
  deadly precision.</p>

  <p>Steding turned the guns against the chapel, but its massive walls could
  not be broken through, and the balls bounded from them without effecting more
  than a trivial damage. The Anabaptists pursued their advantage. Whilst
  Steding was occupied with those who held the Chapel of St. Michael, a large
  number assembled in the market-place and marched in close ranks upon the
  cathedral square.</p>

  <p>The 400, unable to withstand the numbers opposed to them, were driven from
  their positions, and retreated into the narrow Margaret Street, where they
  were unable to use their arms with advantage. Steding burst open the door of
  a house, and sent 200 of his men through it; they issued through the back
  door, filled up a narrow lane running parallel with the street, and attacked
  the Anabaptists in the rear, who, thinking that the city was in the hands of
  the enemy, and that they were being assailed by a reinforcement, fled
  precipitately.</p>

  <p>By an unpardonable oversight, Steding had forgotten to leave a guard at
  the postern by which he had entered the city. The Anabaptists discovered this
  mistake and profited by it, so that when the reinforcements sent to support
  Steding arrived, the gates were closed, and the walls were defended by the
  women, who cast stones and firebrands, and shot arrows amongst them, taunting
  them with the failure of the attempt to surprise the city; and they,
  uncertain whether to believe that the plot of Hansel Eck had failed or not,
  remained without till break of day, vainly attempting to escalade the walls.
  The Anabaptists, who had fled in the Margaret Street, soon rallied, and the
  400 were again exposed to the fury of a multitude three times their number,
  who assailed them in front and in rear, and they were struck down by stones
  and furniture cast out of the windows upon them by the women in the
  houses.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless they bravely defended themselves for several hours, and their
  assailants began to lose courage, as news of the onslaught upon the walls
  reached them. It was now midnight. King John proposed a temporary cessation
  of hostilities, which Steding gladly accepted, and the messengers of
  Bockelson offered the 400 their life if they would lay down their arms, kneel
  before him, and ask his pardon.[264]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[264] Kerssenbroeck, p. 385; Heresbach, pp. 162-6;
  Montfort., p. 72; Hast, p. 396 <i>et seq.</i></p>

  <p>The soldiers indignantly rejected this offer, but proposed to quit the
  town with their arms and ensigns. A long discussion ensued, which Steding
  protracted till break of day.</p>

  <p>At the opening of the negotiations, Steding bade John von Twickel, the
  ensign, hasten to the ramparts with three men, as secretly as possible, and
  urge on the reinforcements. Twickel reached the bastions as day began to
  dawn, and he shouted to his comrades without to help Steding and his gallant
  band before all was lost. The Episcopalians, dreading a ruse of the besieged
  to draw them into an ambush, hesitated; but Twickel called the watchword,
  which was <i>Waldeck</i>, and announced the partial success of the 400.</p>

  <p>Having accomplished his mission, Twickel returned to his comrades within,
  cheering them at the top of his voice with the cry from afar, "Courage,
  friends, help is at hand!"</p>

  <p>At these words the remains of the gallant band of 400 recommenced the
  combat with irresistible energy. They fell on the Anabaptists with such
  vehemence that they drove them back on all sides; they gave no quarter, but
  breaking into divisions, swept the streets, meeting now with only a feeble
  resistance, for the soldiers without were battering at the gates. In vain did
  the sectarians offer to leave the town, their offer came too late, and the
  little band drove them from one rallying point to another.[265]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[265] Kerssenbroeck, pp. 188, 189.</p>

  <p>Rottmann, feeling that all was lost, cast himself on their lances and
  fell. John of Leyden, instead of heading his party, attempted to fly, but was
  recognised as he was escaping through the gate of St. Giles, and was thrown
  into chains.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the reinforcement had mounted the walls, beaten in the
  gates, and was pouring up the streets, rolling back the waves of discomfited
  Anabaptists on the swords and spears of the decimated 400. Two hundred of the
  most determined among the fanatics entrenched themselves in a round tower
  commanding the market-place, and continued firing on the soldiers of the
  prince. The generals, seeing that the town was in their power, and that it
  would cost an expenditure of time and life to reduce those in the tower,
  offered them their life, and permission to march out of Münster unmolested if
  they would surrender.</p>

  <p>On these terms the Anabaptists in the bastion laid down their arms. The
  besiegers now spread throughout the city, hunting out and killing the rebels.
  Hermann Tilbeck, the former burgomaster, who had played into the hands of the
  Anabaptists till he declared himself, and who had been one of the twelve
  elders of Israel, was found concealed, half submerged, in a privy, near the
  gate of St. Giles, was killed, and his body left where he had hidden, "thus
  being buried," says Kerssenbroeck, "with worse than the burial of an ass."
  When the butchery was over, the bodies were brought together into the
  cathedral square and were examined. That of Knipperdolling was not amongst
  them. He was, in fact, hiding in the house of Catherine Hobbels, a zealous
  Anabaptist; she kept him in safety the whole of the 26th, but finding that
  every house was being searched, and fearing lest she should suffer for having
  sheltered him, she ordered him to leave and attempt an escape over the
  walls.[266]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[266] Kerssenbroeck, p. 195.</p>

  <p>On the 27th all the women were collected in the market-square, and were
  ordered to leave the city and never to set foot in it again. But just as they
  were about to depart, Ueberstein announced that any one of them who could
  deliver up Knipperdolling should be allowed to remain and retain her
  possessions. The bait was tempting. Catherine Hobbels stepped forward, and
  offered to point out the hiding-place of the man they sought. She was given a
  renewed assurance that her house and goods would be respected, and she then
  delivered up Knipperdolling, who had not quitted his place of refuge. The
  promise made to her was rigorously observed; but her husband, not being
  included in the pardon, and being a ringleader of the fanatics, was
  executed.[267] The women were accompanied by the soldiers as far as the
  Lieb-Frau gate; they took with them their children, and were ordered to leave
  the diocese and principality forthwith.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[267] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 196; Heresbach, p. 166.</p>

  <p>Divara, the head queen of John of Leyden, the wife of Knipperdolling, and
  three other women, were refused permission to leave. They were executed on
  the 7th July.</p>

  <p>Münster was then delivered over to pillage; but all those who had left the
  town during the government of the Anabaptists were given their furniture and
  houses and such of their goods as could be identified.</p>

  <p>All the property of the Anabaptists was confiscated and sold to pay the
  debts contracted by the prince for defraying the expenses of the war. The
  division of the booty occasioned several troubles, parties of soldiers
  mutinied, and attempted a second pillage, but the mutineers were put down
  rigorously.</p>

  <p>Several more executions took place during the following days, and men
  hidden away in cellars, garrets and sewers were discovered and killed or
  carried off to prison. Among these were Bernard Krechting and
  Kerkering.[268]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[268] Kerssenbroeck, pp. 198-200. Dorpius says, "In the
  capture of the city, women and children were spared; and none were killed
  after the first fight, except the ringleaders."&mdash;f. 399.</p>

  <p>On the 28th June, Francis of Waldeck entered the city at the head of 800
  men. The sword, crown, and spurs of John of Leyden, together with the keys of
  the city, were presented to him.[269]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[269] Montfort., p. 73.</p>

  <p>The prince received, as had been stipulated, half the booty, and the
  articles and the treasure deposited in the town-hall and in the royal palace,
  which amounted to 100,000 gold florins.[270]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[270] Kerssenbroeck, Heresbach, p. 168; Hast, p. 400.</p>

  <p>Francis remained in Münster only three days. Having named the new
  magistrates, and organised the civil government of the city, he departed for
  his castle of Iburg. On the 13th July he ordered a Te Deum to be sung in the
  churches throughout the diocese, in thanks to God for having restored
  tranquillity; and the Chapter inaugurated a yearly thanksgiving procession to
  take place on the 25th June.[271]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[271] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 200.</p>

  <p>On the 15th July, the Elector of Cologne, the Duke of Juliers, and Francis
  of Waldeck, met at Neuss to concert measures for preventing a repetition of
  these disorders. The leading Protestant divines wrote, urging the
  extermination of the heretics, and reminding the princes that the sword had
  been given them for this purpose.</p>

  <p>On the same day, the diet of Worms agreed that the Anabaptists should be
  extirpated as a sect dangerous alike to morals and to the safety of the
  commonwealth, and that an assembly should be held in the month of November,
  to decide upon defraying the cost of the war, and on the form of government
  which was to be established in the city.[272]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[272] <i>Ibid.</i> p. 201</p>

  <p>The diet met on the 1st November, and decided,&mdash;That everything
  should be re-established in Münster on the old footing, and that the clergy
  should have their property and privileges restored to them. That all who had
  fled the city to escape the government of the Anabaptists should be
  reinstated in the possession of their offices, privileges, and houses. That
  all the goods of the rebels should remain confiscated to defray the expense
  of the war. That the princes of neighbouring states should send deputies to
  Münster to provide that the innocent should not suffer with the guilty. That
  the fortifications should be in part demolished, as an example; but that
  Münster should not be degraded from its rank as a city. That the bishop and
  chapter and nobles should demolish the bastions within the town as soon as
  the city walls had been razed. That the bishops, the nobles, and the citizens
  should solemnly engage, for themselves and for their successors, never to
  attempt to refortify the city. Finally, that the envoys of the King of the
  Romans and of the princes should visit the said town on the 5th March, 1536,
  to see that these articles of the convention had been executed.</p>

  <p>All these articles were not observed. The bishop did not demolish the
  fortifications, and the point was not insisted upon.</p>

  <p>As for the civil constitution of Münster, its privileges and franchises,
  they were not entirely restored till 1553.</p>

  <p>Francis of Waldeck now set to work repairing and purifying the churches,
  and restoring everything as it had been before. Catholic worship was
  everywhere restored without a single voice in the city rising in opposition.
  The people were sick of Protestantism, whether in its mitigated form as
  Lutheranism, or in its aggravated development as Anabaptism.</p>

  <p>But Lutherans of other states were by no means satisfied. The
  reconciliation of the great city with the Catholic Church, from which half
  its inhabitants had previously separated, was not pleasant news to the
  Reformers, and they protested loudly. "On the Friday after St. John's day,"
  wrote Dorpius "in midsummer, God came and destroyed this hell and drove the
  devil out, but the devil's mother came in again.... The Anabaptists were on
  that day rooted out, and the Papists planted in again."[273]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[273] "Hernach auff freitag S. Johanstag mitten in
  Sommer, kommet Gott und zerstöret die Helle, und jaget den Teuffel heraus,
  und komet sein Mutter wider hinein ... und sind die Widerteuffer an
  obgemeltem tag ausgerottet worden, die Papisten aber wider
  eingepflantzet."&mdash;Dorp. f. 399 (by misprint 499).</p>

  <p>It is time to look at John of Leyden and his fellow-prisoners: they were
  Knipperdolling and Bernard Krechting. There could be no doubt that their fate
  would be terrible. It was additional cruelty to delay it. But the bishop and
  the Lutheran divines were curious to see and argue with the captives, and
  they were taken from place to place to gratify their curiosity.</p>

  <p>When King John appeared before Francis of Waldeck, the bishop asked him
  angrily how he could protract the siege whilst his people were starving
  around him. "Francis of Waldeck," he answered, "they should all have died of
  hunger before I surrendered, had things gone as I desired."[274] He retained
  his spirits and affected to joke. At Dulmen the people crowded round him
  asking, "Is this the king who took to himself so many wives?" "I ask your
  pardon," answered Bockelson, "I took maidens and made them wives."[275]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[274] Dorp. ff. 399 a, 400 a, b.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[275] Dorp. f. 399 b.</p>

  <p>It has been often stated that the three unfortunates were carried round
  the country in iron cages. This is inaccurate. They were taken in chains on
  horseback, with two soldiers on either side; their bodies were placed in iron
  cages and hung to the steeple of the church of St. Lambert, after they were
  dead.</p>

  <p>At Bevergern the Lutheran divine, Anthony Corvinus, and other ministers
  "interviewed" the fallen king, and a long and very curious account of their
  discussion remains.[276]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[276] Luther's "Sämmtliche Werke." Wittenb. 1545-51.
  Band, ii. ff. 376-386.</p>

  <p>"First, when the king was brought out of prison into the room, we greeted
  him in a friendly manner and bade him be seated before us four. Also, we
  asked in a friendly manner how he was getting on in the prison, and whether
  he was cold or sick? Answer of the king: Although he was obliged to endure
  the frost, and the sins weighing on his heart, yet he must, as such was God's
  will, bear patiently. And these and other similar conversations led us so
  far&mdash;for nothing can be got out of him by direct questions&mdash;that we
  were able right craftily to converse with him about his government."</p>

  <p>Then followed a lengthy controversy on all the heretical doctrines of the
  Anabaptist sect, in which the king exhibited no little skill. The preachers
  having brought the charge of novelty against Anabaptism, John of Leyden very
  promptly showed that those living in glass houses should not throw stones, by
  pointing out that Lutheranism was not much older than Anabaptism, that he had
  proved his mission by miracles, whereas Luther had nothing to show to
  demonstrate his call to establish a new creed.</p>

  <p>The discussion on Justification by Faith only was most affectionate, for
  both parties were quite agreed on this doctrine&mdash;surely a very
  satisfactory one and very full of comfort to John of Leyden. But on the
  doctrine of the Eucharist they could not agree, the king holding to
  Zwingli.[277]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[277] "Denn wiewol ichs fur dieser zeit mit dem Zwingel
  gehalten," &amp;c., f. 384.</p>

  <p>"That in this Sacrament the faithful, who are baptised, receive the Body
  and Blood of Christ believe I," said the king; "for though I hold for this
  time with Zwingli, nevertheless I find that the words of Christ (This is my
  Body, This is my Blood) must remain in their worth. But that unbelievers also
  receive the Body and Blood of Christ, that I cannot believe."</p>

  <p><i>The Preachers</i>: "How that? Shall our unbelief avail more than the
  word, command and ordinance of God?"</p>

  <p><i>The King</i>: "Unbelief is such a dreadful thing, that I cannot believe
  that the unbelievers can partake of the Body and Blood of Christ."</p>

  <p><i>The Preachers</i>: "It is a perverse thing that you should ever try to
  set our faith, or want of faith, above the words and ordinance of God. But it
  is evident that our faith can add nothing to God's ordinance, nor can my
  unbelief detract anything therefrom. Faith must be there, that I may benefit
  by such eating and drinking; but yet in this matter must we repose more on
  God's command and word than on our faith or unbelief."</p>

  <p><i>The King</i>: "If this your meaning hold, then all unbelievers must
  have partaken of the Communion of the Body and Blood of Christ. But such I
  cannot believe."</p>

  <p><i>The Preachers</i>: "You must understand that our unbelief cannot make
  the ordinance of God unavailing. Say now, for what end was the sun
  created?"</p>

  <p><i>The King</i>: "Scripture teaches that it was made to rule the day and
  to shine."</p>

  <p><i>The Preachers</i>: "Now if we or you were blind, would the sun fail to
  execute its office for which it was created?"</p>

  <p><i>The King</i>: "I know well that my blindness or yours would not make
  the sun fail to shine."</p>

  <p><i>The Preachers</i>: "So is it with all the works and ordinances of God,
  especially with the Sacraments. When I am baptised it is well if faith be
  there; but if it be not, baptism does not for all that fail to be a precious,
  noble, and holy Sacrament, yes, what St. Paul calls it, a regeneration and
  renewal of the Holy Ghost, because it is ordered by God's word and given His
  promise. So also with respect to the Lord's Supper; if those who partake
  shall have faith to grasp the promise of Christ, as it is written, <i>Oportet
  accedentem credere</i>, but none the less does God's word, ordinance, and
  command remain, even if my faith never more turned thereto. But of this we
  have said enough."[278]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[278] <i>Ibid.</i> f. 384 b.</p>

  <p>The preachers next catechised John of Leyden on his heresy concerning the
  Incarnation. He did not deny that Jesus Christ was born of Mary, but he
  denied that He derived from her His flesh and blood, as he considered that
  Mary being sinful, out of sinful flesh sinful offspring must issue.</p>

  <p>The catechising on the subject of marriage follows.</p>

  <p><i>The Preachers</i>: "How have you regarded marriage, and what is your
  belief thereupon?"</p>

  <p><i>The King</i>: "We have ever held marriage to be God's work and
  ordinance, and we hold this now, that no higher or better estate exists in
  the world than the estate of matrimony."</p>

  <p><i>The Preachers</i>: "Why have you so wildly treated this same estate,
  against God's word and common order, and taken one wife after another? How
  can you justify such a proceeding?"</p>

  <p><i>The King</i>: "What was permitted to the patriarchs in the Old
  Testament, why should it be denied to us? What we have held is this: he who
  wished to have only one wife had not other wives forced upon him; but him who
  wished to have more wives than one, we left free to do so, according to God's
  command, Be fruitful and multiply."</p>

  <p>This the preachers combat by saying that the patriarchs were guiltless,
  because the law of the land (<i>die gemeine Policey</i>) did not then forbid
  concubinage, but that now that is forbidden by common law, it is sinful.[279]
  Then they asked the king what other texts he could quote to establish
  polygamy.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[279] Wei zweiveln nicht wenn ein bestendig Policey und
  Regiment gewesen were, wie itzt est, es würden sich die Vetter freilich aug
  der selbigen gehalten haben.</p>

  <p><i>The King</i>: "Paul says of the bishop, let him be the husband of one
  wife; now if a bishop is to have only one wife, surely, in the time of Paul,
  laymen must have been allowed two or three apiece, as pleased them. There you
  have your text."</p>

  <p><i>The Preachers</i>: "As we said before, marriage is an affair of common
  police regulation, <i>res Politica</i>. And as now the law of the land is
  different from what it was in the time of Paul, so that many wives are
  forbidden and not tolerated, you will have to answer for your innovations
  before God and man."</p>

  <p><i>The King</i>: "Well, I have the consolation that what was permitted to
  the fathers cannot damn us. I had rather be with the fathers than with
  you."</p>

  <p><i>The Preachers</i>: "Well, we prefer obedience to the State."[280]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[280] Predicanten: So wöllen wir in diesemfäll viel
  lieber der Oberkeit gehorsam sein, f. 386 b.</p>

  <p>Here we see Corvinus, Kymens, and the other ministers placing matrimony on
  exactly the same low footing as did Luther.</p>

  <p>Having "interviewed" the king, these crows settled on Knipperdolling and
  Krechting in Horstmar, and with these unfortunates they carried on a paper
  controversy.</p>

  <p>The captivity of the king and his two accomplices lasted six months. The
  Lutheran preachers had swarmed about him and buzzed in his ears, and the poor
  wretch believed that by yielding a few points he could save his life. He
  offered to labour along with Melchior Hoffmann, to bring the numerous
  Anabaptists in Friesland, Holland, Brabant, and Flanders into submission, if
  he were given his liberty; but finding that the preachers had been giving him
  false hopes and leading him into recantations, he refused to see them again,
  and awaited his execution in sullen despair.</p>

  <p>The pastors failing to convert the Anabaptists, and finding that the
  sectaries used against them scripture and private judgment with such efficacy
  that they were unable in argument to overcome them, called upon the princes
  to exterminate them by fire and sword.</p>

  <p>The gentle Melancthon wrote a tract or letter to urge the princes on; it
  was entitled, "Das weltliche Oberkeiten den Widerteuffern mit leiblicher
  straffe zu wehren schüldig sey. Etlicher bedenken zu Wittemberg gestellet
  durch Philip Melancthon, 1536. Ob Christliche Fürsten schüldig sind der
  Widerteuffer unchristlicher Sect mit leiblicher straffe und mit dem schwert
  zu wehren." He enumerates the doctrines of the unfortunate sectarians at
  Münster and elsewhere, and then he says that it is the duty of all princes
  and nobles to root out with the sword all heresy from their dominions; but
  then, with this proviso, they must first be instructed out of God's Word by
  the pure reformed Church what doctrines are heretical, that they may only
  exterminate those who differ from the Lutheran communion.</p>

  <p>He then quotes to the Protestant princes the example of the Jewish kings:
  "The kings in the Old Testament, not only the Jewish kings, but also the
  converted heathen kings, judged and killed the false prophets and
  unbelievers. Such examples show the office of princes. As Paul says, the law
  is good that blasphemers are to be punished. The government is not to rule
  men for their bodily welfare, so much as for God's honour, for they are God's
  ministers; let them remember that and value their office."</p>

  <p>But it is argued on the other side that it is written, "Let both grow
  together till the harvest. Now this is not spoken to the temporal power,"
  says Melancthon, "but to the preachers, that they should not use physical
  power under the excuse of their office. From all this it is plain that the
  worldly government is bound to drive away blasphemy, false doctrine,
  heresies, and to punish in their persons those who hold to these things....
  Let the judge know that this sect of Anabaptists is from the devil, and as a
  prudent preacher instructs different stations how they are to conduct
  themselves, as he teaches a wife that to breed children is to please God
  well, so he teaches the temporal authorities how they are to serve God's
  honour, and openly drive away heresy."[281]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[281] "Das weltliche Oberkeit," &amp;c., in Luth. "Sämt.
  Werke." 1545-51, ii. ff. 327-8.</p>

  <p>So also did Justus Menius write to urge on an exterminatory persecution of
  the sectaries; he also argues that "Let both grow together till the harvest,"
  is not to be quoted by the princes as an excuse for sparing lives and
  properties.[282]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[282] "Von dem Geist d. Widerteuffer." in Luth. "Samt.
  Werke." 1545-51, ii. f. 325 b.</p>

  <p>On the 12th January, 1536, John of Leyden, Knipperdolling, and Krechting
  were brought back to Münster to undergo sentence of death.[283]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[283] Kerssenbroeck, p. 209; Kurtze Hist. f. 400.</p>

  <p>A platform was erected in the square before the townhall on the 21st, and
  on this platform was planted a large stake with iron collars attached to
  it.</p>

  <p>When John Bockelson was told, on the 21st, that he was to die on the
  morrow, he asked for the chaplain of the bishop, John von Siburg, who spent
  the night with him. With the fear of a terrible death before him, the
  confidence of the wretched man gave way, and he made his confession with
  every sign of true contrition.</p>

  <p>Knipperdolling and Krechting, who were also offered the assistance of a
  priest, rejected the offer with contempt. They declared that the presence of
  God sufficed them, that they were conscious of having committed no sin, and
  that all their actions had been done the sole glory of to God, that moreover
  they were freely justified by faith in Christ.</p>

  <p>On Monday the 22nd, at eight o'clock in the morning, the ex-king of
  Münster and his companions were led to execution. The gates of the city had
  been closed, and a large detachment of troops surrounded the scaffold.
  Outside this iron ring was a dense crowd of people, and the windows were
  filled with heads. Francis of Waldeck occupied a window immediately opposite
  the scaffold, and remained there throughout the hideous tragedy.[284] As an
  historian has well observed, "Francis of Waldeck, in default of other
  virtues, might at least have not forgotten what was due to his high rank and
  his Episcopal character; he regarded neither&mdash;but showed himself as
  ferocious as had been John Bockelson, by becoming a spectator of the long and
  horrible torture of the three criminals."[285] John and his accomplices
  having reached the townhall, received their sentence from Wesseling, the city
  judge. It was that they should be burned with red-hot pincers, and finally
  stabbed with daggers heated in the fire.[286]</p>

  <p>The king was the first to mount the scaffold and be tortured.</p>

  <p>"The king endured three grips with the pincers without speaking or crying,
  but then he burst forth into cries of, "Father, have mercy on me! God of
  mercy and loving kindness!" and he besought pardon of his sins and help. The
  bystanders were pierced to the heart by his shrieks of agony, the scent of
  the roast flesh filled the market-place; his body was one great wound. At
  length the sign was given, his tongue was torn out with the red pincers, and
  a dagger pierced his heart.</p>

  <p>Knipperdolling and Krechting were put to the torture directly after the
  agonies of the king had begun. Knipperdolling endeavoured to beat his brains
  out against the stake, and when prevented, he tried to strangle himself with
  his own collar. To prevent him accomplishing his design, a rope was put
  through his mouth and attached to the stake so as totally to incapacitate him
  from moving. When these unfortunates were dead, their bodies were placed in
  three iron cages, and were hung up on the tower of the church of St. Lambert,
  the king in the middle.[287]</p>

  <p>Thus ended this hideous drama, which produced an effect throughout
  Germany. The excess of the scandal inspired all the Catholic governments with
  horror, and warned them of the immensity of the danger they ran in allowing
  the spread of Protestant mysticism. Cities and principalities which wavered
  in their allegiance to the Church took a decided position at once.</p>

  <p>At Münster, Catholicism was re-established. As has been already mentioned,
  the debauched, cruel bishop was a Lutheran at heart, and his ambition was to
  convert Münster into an hereditary principality in his family, after the
  example of certain other princes.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, in 1543, he proposed to the States of the diocese to accept
  the Confession of Augsburg and abandon Catholicism. The proposition of the
  prince was unanimously rejected. Nevertheless the prince joined the
  Protestant union of Smalkald the following year, but having been complained
  of to the Pope and the Emperor, and fearing the fate of Hermann von Wied,
  Archbishop of Cologne, he excused himself as best he could through his
  relative, Jost Hodefilter, bishop of Lübeck, and Franz von Dei, suffragan
  bishop of Osnabrück.</p>

  <p>Before the Smalkald war the prince-bishop had secretly engaged the help of
  the Union against his old enemy, the "wild" Duke Henry of Brunswick. After
  the war, the Duke of Oldenburg revenged himself on the principality severely,
  with fire and sword, and only spared Münster itself for 100,000 guilders. The
  bishop died of grief. He left three natural sons by Anna Polmann. They bore
  as their arms a half star, a whole star being the arms of Waldeck.</p>
