  <h2><a id="pro"
     name="pro"></a>PROLOGUE</h2>

  <p class="first">MR FRANCIS CAREY has been long a familiar name to the
  world&mdash;to some people as the most patriotic of millionaires, to others
  as the richest of patriots. Exiled in early youth to the Colonies for his
  health's sake, he made a profession of a necessity, and secured in a short
  space of time bodily well-being and an immense fortune. Few could trace in
  the square muscular figure of forty-five the pallid and consumptive boy of
  twenty. By a singular turn of fate he had stood by the cradle of great
  industries. He was the pioneer of the richest gold-mining area in the world,
  and scarcely less famous were his shipping lines, his railways, his
  newspapers, his teak-forests, and his vast tobacco-farms. Money made by
  enterprise was invested with wisdom, and his fortune was already almost out
  of bounds when it was doubled by the success of a copper venture which bade
  fair to rival Montana. And yet in the prime of life, in spite of the wiles of
  many women, he remained a bachelor. Some attributed the fact to an early and
  melancholy love affair; others, with better judgment, ascribed it to his
  preoccupation with the fortunes of his country. In Bacon's phrase he had
  "espoused the State," and found in her a mistress fairer and more exacting
  than any mortal Amaryllis.</p>

  <p>In London he had modest chambers on a second floor in Half-Moon Street,
  but no man owned more lordly country-houses. The feudal manors of
  impoverished English squires, the castles of impecunious Highland chiefs held
  for him no charms. It was his business, he said, to show the world a more
  excellent way. At the head of a long glen in the Selkirks, where snow-peaks
  rose out of pine-forests, he built himself a hunting-box. In a scented
  Kashmir valley, among thickets of rhododendron, he had another, where lamas
  and Turcoman merchants, passing on their way from Leh to Srinagur, brought
  all the news of Central Asia. A bungalow in a Pacific isle, a fishing-lodge
  in New Zealand, and a superb farm of the old Dutch style in the Blaauwberg,
  were other of his dwellings. But his true home, if a nomad can be said to
  have one, was his house of Musuru, on the scarp of the Mau plateau, looking
  over the great trough of Equatoria. Here, in the midst of a park of many
  thousand acres, he lived as Prester John may have lived in his Abyssinian
  palace. He might lounge through the world of fashion in an old tweed coat,
  but his heart was on the side of magnificence. He sought for romance in life,
  and found it by the device of importing the fine flower of civilisation into
  the stronghold of savagery. It pleased him to shuffle unregarded in a London
  crowd, knowing that over seas half a continent waited upon his will. His
  amazing energy annihilated space, and he found time in a crowded life to live
  in his many houses more regularly than the modest citizen who owns a mansion
  in Bayswater and a villa at Cannes.</p>

  <p>To the world Carey remained a mystery. Every halfpenny paper placarded his
  achievements, his arrivals and departures were chronicled like those of
  Royalty, his speeches in the City and his rare appearances on public
  platforms drew crowds which were denied to eminent statesmen. But the man
  himself was obscure. He was rarely seen in society, and country-houses knew
  him not. Nevertheless he contrived in some way to obtain the friendship of
  most men and women who were worth knowing. His influence was so well
  recognised, and yet so inexplicable, that many good people were heard to call
  it sinister. And yet few had any complaint to make of his doings. He spent
  his great income generously and prudently on public needs. A vast scheme of
  education, inaugurated by him, tied the schools of the Colonies to the older
  institutions of England. One ancient university owed the renewal of her
  fortunes to his gifts. In the slums his dwellings for workmen had made his
  name a household word, and at his own cost he yearly relieved the congestion
  of great cities by planting settlements in new lands. His activity, indeed,
  was so boundless that, had he figured more in the public eye, enemies would
  have sprung up out of sheer dullness of understanding. Knowing this, he kept
  wisely to his humble retirement, that his usefulness might be marred by no
  private grudges. He was accepted as a kind of national providence, scarcely
  more to be criticised than the Monarchy. If some called his faith
  Imperialism, others pointed out how little resemblance it bore to the article
  cried in the market-place. It was a creed beyond parties, a consuming and
  passionate interest in the destiny of his people.</p>

  <p>On one point alone he found critics. It was his habit to take every year a
  party of his friends to some one or other of his remote homes. Now it would
  be a band of sportsmen whom he would carry off to the Selkirks or Kashmir for
  some weeks of unforgettable hunting. Now he would take a group of his less
  active acquaintances to his house at the Cape, where in the midst of
  vineyards and heathy mountains they could find good talk and a complete
  seclusion from the world. Once in a while he would have a gathering at his
  East African dwelling, and these were the choicest of his entertainments. The
  guests who were fortunate enough to share his hospitality came to form a set
  by themselves, bound together by the tie of delectable memories. Their
  enemies christened them "Careyites," and said hard things about the power of
  the purse; but the coterie was too large, too distinguished, and too
  representative to be sneered at with impunity. The Radical journalist found
  nothing to cavil at in the man who, so far as he saw, lived simply and
  wrought effectively for the poor. The Tory member could not speak ill of one
  who was so noted a sportsman and so generous a host. The plain man could only
  admire a figure of such vitality, who was original even in his pleasures.</p>

  <p>It will be remembered that some little while ago the creed which is
  commonly called Imperialism was tossed down into the arena of politics to be
  wrangled over by parties and grossly mauled in the quarrel. With the fall of
  the Government which had sanctioned such tactics there came one of those
  waves of reaction which now and then break in upon our national
  steadfastness. The name of "Empire" stank in the nostrils of the electorate.
  Those who used it fell like ninepins; in the huge majority which the new
  Ministry acquired there were many who openly blasphemed it; and the few who
  still cherished the faith thought it wise to don temporarily the garb of
  indifference. Carey viewed the change with philosophic calm. He trusted the
  instincts of his race, and was not sorry that the dross should be purged and
  the spirit purified by misfortune. It occurred to him, however, that a little
  quiet conversation among some friends of his own way of thinking might be
  useful by way of clarifying their minds. It is well after defeat to make a
  short sojourn in the wilderness. That year, accordingly, he selected his
  party with especial care, and fixed Musuru as the place of entertainment. The
  months of August, September, and October were chosen as the best time, partly
  because it was the cool season in East Africa, partly because it was the Bar
  and Parliamentary vacation&mdash;though, indeed, as he reflected, none of his
  guests had for the present much to do with Parliament. His old friend the
  Duchess of Maxton, and Mr Hugh Somerville, a young man of thirty, who, after
  some years of foreign travel, was now endeavouring to make a fortune, were
  called in to assist in his selection. One rule only he laid down as
  inviolable&mdash;"I will have no husbands and wives, remember, Susan. If a
  man is married he must come without his wife, and the same for the women. We
  must all be unattached, for domesticity, as I have often told you, is the foe
  of friendship."</p>

  <p>With this guidance, and after long consideration, a list was prepared.
  Lord Appin, the Duchess's brother, was the first to be selected. Once the
  leader of the Conservatives, he had found the trammels of politics too hard
  to be borne, and had given up to mankind what the virtuous declared was due
  to his party. In German metaphysics, French furniture, and the Turf he found
  his nominal interests; but his friends, of whom Carey was the most intimate,
  were well aware that beneath his insouciance he cherished political dreams
  which, though unacceptable to the hustings, were none the less broad-based on
  prescience and understanding. Lord Launceston, Hugh's former chief, came
  next; and Mr Eric Lowenstein, a Jewish financier, who had been Carey's
  partner in many schemes. Mr Ebenezer Wakefield, that eminent Colonial
  publicist, was added by Carey; and Hugh stipulated for Lewis Astbury, a young
  journalist who had won fame first as a war correspondent and then as a
  military critic. With Sir Edward Considine, the traveller, and Colonel
  Alastair Graham, of the Intelligence Department, the masculine side of the
  party was complete. The women were more difficult, and the Duchess spent many
  anxious hours. It was easy enough, she said, to get men without their wives,
  but it looked so odd for women to go travelling without their husbands; and
  Hugh's suggestion of a party of girls was refused on the ground of the
  appalling duties of chaperonage. In the end Lady Lucy Gardner, the wife of a
  Colonial governor, and Mrs Wilbraham and Lady Warcliff, whose respective
  husbands were on duty in Africa and India, were selected as the nucleus. Hugh
  begged for Mrs Yorke, the American wife of an English statesman, the Duchess
  insisted on Mrs Deloraine, and Carey added Lady Amysfort, the Egeria of her
  party, who, like her votaries, was out of power since the elections. "I will
  bring two charming girls," the Duchess said, "Marjory Haystoun and my niece
  Flora&mdash;it will do them all the good in the world. And Marjory is as
  serious as you, Francis, and nearly as clever. There! I think our list is
  complete. We have the sexes in equal numbers, which is more than you will
  find in any English country-house."</p>

  <p>These details being settled, it only remained to arrange for the voyage.
  Following a rule of his own invention, Carey always decreed that his guests
  should come within the pale of his hospitality at Southampton or Marseilles,
  or wherever the real journey could be said to begin. Their route was as
  rigidly mapped out as a Cook's Tour, for he felt that it was desirable to
  avoid that premature boredom which may fall on ill-assorted
  fellow-travellers. It was arranged that the Duchess should travel with one of
  the girls and Lord Launceston. The other girl should go with Lord Appin, Lady
  Lucy, and Mr Astbury. Lady Amysfort and Mrs Wilbraham should accompany Mr
  Lowenstein, while Hugh was given the escort of Mrs Yorke and Lady Warcliff.
  Considine and Graham, it appeared, were at that moment hunting near Lake
  Rudolf, and would be summoned by messenger so as to arrive with the rest of
  the party. The various detachments should start at different times, one
  lingering for a few days at Cairo, another at Mombasa, but all should meet at
  Musuru in time for dinner on the Twelfth of August.</p>

  <p>"Last Twelfth," said the Duchess meditatively, "I was entertaining for Bob
  at Glenumquhill. Fourteen men and not a woman besides myself. And this year I
  am to try to keep the peace among seventeen maniacs, eight of them female, on
  a mountain in the Tropics. After this who shall say that I have not the
  courage to make any sacrifice for the cause!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">THE present writer is ill-equipped for the task of
  describing great houses, but Musuru demands that he should dedicate his
  slender talents to the attempt. From a wayside station on the railway between
  Mombasa and Port Florence a well-made highway runs north along the edge of
  the plateau through forests of giant cypress and juniper. To the east lies
  the great Rift valley, with the silver of its lakes gleaming eerily through
  the mountain haze. After a dozen miles the woodland ceases and the road
  emerges on a land of far-stretching downs, broken up into shallow glens where
  streams of clear water ripple through coverts of bracken and lilies. Native
  villages with bee-hive huts appear, and the smoke from their wood fires
  scents the thin upland air. Now the road turns west, and the indefinable
  something creeps into the atmosphere which tells the traveller that he is
  approaching the rim of the world. Suddenly he comes upon a gate, with a
  thatched lodge, which might be in Scotland. Entering, he finds himself in a
  park dotted with shapely copses and full of the same endless singing streams.
  Orchards, vineyards, olive-groves, and tobacco-fields appear, and then the
  drive sweeps into a garden, with a lake in the centre and a blaze of
  flower-beds. The air blows free to westward, and he knows that he is almost
  on the edge, when another turn reveals the house against the sky-line. It is
  long and low, something in the Cape Dutch style, with wide verandahs and cool
  stone pillars. The sun-shutters and the beams are of cedar, the roof is of
  warm red tiles, and the walls are washed with a delicate pure white.
  Standing, as I have seen it, against a flaming sunset, with the glow of
  lamplight from the windows, it is as true a fairy palace as ever haunted a
  poet's dream. Beyond it the hill falls steeply to the Tropics, and the
  gardens run down into the rich glens. Its height is some nine thousand feet
  above the sea, and its climate is always temperate; but three thousand feet
  beneath it is Equatoria, and on clear days a gleam can be caught of the great
  lakes. So the gardens, which begin with English flowers, fall in tiers
  through a dozen climates, till azalea gives place to hibiscus, and hibiscus
  to poinsettia, and below in the moist valley you end with orchids and
  palms.</p>

  <p>Entering the house through the heavy brass-studded doors, you come first
  into a great panelled hall, floored with a mosaic of marble on which lie many
  skins and karosses, and lit by a huge silver chandelier. In a corner is a
  stone fireplace like a cavern, where day and night in winter burns a great
  fire of logs. Round it are a number of low chairs and little tables, but
  otherwise the place is empty of furniture, save for the forest of horns and
  the grinning heads of lion and leopard on the walls. The second hall is more
  of a summer chamber, for it is panelled in lighter wood and hung with many
  old prints and pictures concerned with the great age of African adventure.
  There you will find quaint Dutch and Portuguese charts, and altar-pieces
  gifted by a de Silveira or a de Barros to some Mozambique church long since
  in ruins. Brass-bound sea-chests, tall copper vases of Arab workmanship, rare
  porcelain of the Indies, and rich lacquer cabinets line the walls, and the
  carpet is an exquisite old Persian fabric. Beyond, through the folding
  windows, lie the verandahs, whence one looks over a sea of mist to the trough
  of the lakes. To the right stretch more panelled chambers&mdash;dining-room,
  smoking-rooms, a library of many thousand volumes, and as fine a private
  museum as you will find in the world. To the left are the drawing-rooms, hung
  with flowered silks and curious Eastern brocades, opening on a cool verandah,
  and lit in the evening by the same wild fires of sunset. Upstairs the
  bedrooms are masterpieces of arrangement, all fresh and spacious, and yet all
  unmistakably of Africa and the Tropics. From any window there is a vision of
  a landscape which has the strange glamour of a dream. The place is embosomed
  in flowers, whether growing in brass-hooped mahogany tubs or cut and placed
  daily in the many silver bowls; but no heavy odours ever impair the virginal
  freshness of the house. Luxury has been carried to that extreme of art where
  it becomes a delicate simplicity. It is a place to work, to talk, to think,
  but not to idle in&mdash;a strenuous and stimulating habitation. For on every
  side seems to stretch an unknown world, calling upon the adventurous mind to
  take possession.</p><br>

  <p>Hugh dressed early, and, finding the hall empty, penetrated into the Green
  drawing-room, where he came upon Lady Flora Brune examining critically some
  Zanzibari ivories. They had met many times in London, and were on a footing
  of easy friendship.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr Somerville, I must ask the usual question. Had you a pleasant
  journey?"</p>

  <p>"Fair," said Hugh, warming his hands at the fire. "We found Cairo a little
  too hot&mdash;at least Mrs Yorke and Lady Warcliff did, for I am a
  salamander. You were luckier, and stopped at Marseilles."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and Aunt Susan behaved so badly. Poor Lord Launceston wanted to stay
  at home and write, and she dragged him about the whole Riviera, trying to
  find a house for next winter. He took it like an angel, but I am sure he
  thought a good deal. He provided me with a lot of books to read on the
  voyage, and I have muddled my brains so terribly that I haven't a clear idea
  left. I shall disgrace myself in this party, for it is to be very serious,
  isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Very serious, Lady Flora. But you and I are young, and the loss of our
  contributions won't matter. I am very stupid, too, since the
  elections&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You were beaten, weren't you?" said the girl, with wide sympathetic
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Handsomely. Four thousand of a minority instead of Seymour's majority of
  fifteen hundred. I hadn't a chance from the start. My work with Launceston
  was flung in my face, they shouted 'Indian labour' when I tried to speak
  about anything, and Nonconformist ministers went about the place in
  motor-cars telling the people that every vote given to me was a vote given
  against the Lord. They even accused me of being a Jew," said Hugh, stroking a
  very un-Jewish nose. "Besides, I was that strange wildfowl, a Tory
  free-trader, and another Unionist was run against me, who claimed the credit
  of such little Imperialism as was going. But on the whole I enjoyed the
  sport. I never once lost my temper, and I got a tremendous ovation after the
  poll. The men who had voted against me carried me shoulder-high to my hotel,
  and they all but killed the successful candidate. Englishmen at heart love a
  failure!"</p>

  <p>"Are there any other victims here?" Lady Flora asked.</p>

  <p>"Astbury lost by ten in a place which was considered hopeless, so he did
  well. Also Considine was turned out, but as he never went near the place, and
  left his wife to do his electioneering, perhaps we need not wonder. But all
  that is dead and buried. I hear people talking. Let's go and find the
  others."</p>

  <p>The rest of the party had gathered in the inner hall. The young
  men&mdash;Hugh, Astbury, Considine, and Graham&mdash;wore ordinary smart
  London clothes. Carey, as was his custom, had a soft silk shirt and a low
  collar, above which his magnificent throat and head rose like a bust of some
  Roman emperor. Mr Wakefield had arrayed himself in that garb which seems
  inseparable from Colonial statesmen&mdash;a short dinner-jacket and a black
  tie. The tall figure of Lord Launceston stood by the fire, deep in
  conversation with Lord Appin, whose robust form and silver head contrasted
  strangely with the bent figure and worn, old-young face of his companion. Mr
  Lowenstein, a very small man, with untidy hair and bright eager eyes,
  wandered restlessly between Mrs Wilbraham, who was absorbed in the
  contemplation of Lord Launceston, and the Duchess, who was considering a plan
  of the dinner-table.</p>

  <p>It was the rule at Musuru to disregard the claims of precedence. Hugh was
  sent in with Mrs Yorke, and found on his other side Lady Lucy. An English
  butler was the one concession to the familiar, for the meal was served by
  Masai boys, far defter and more noiseless than any footman, dressed in tunics
  of white linen with a thin border of blue. Hugh had scarcely time to look
  round the great half-lit room and admire the exquisite harmony of silver
  lamps and crimson roses, when he found his attention claimed by his
  right-hand neighbour.</p>

  <p>"Please tell me who the people are and all about them," she begged in her
  pretty exotic voice. "I know you and Margaret Warcliff and the Duchess and
  Lord Appin and Mr Carey. That is Lord Launceston, isn't it, over there? I do
  think his deep eyes and haggard face just the most wonderful thing in life.
  How happy Charlotte Wilbraham looks talking to him! I know they are devoted
  friends. Who is sitting by his other side?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs Deloraine. Don't you know her? She has many claims to be considered
  the most beautiful woman in England, but she is rarely seen in London. She
  lives in a wonderful old house in Shropshire, and writes what many people
  think the only good religious poetry of our day. What a contrast her Madonna
  face is to Lady Amysfort's!" Hugh looked across the table to where that great
  lady, with her small head and bright eyes, like some handsome bird of prey,
  was entertaining Lord Appin.</p>

  <p>"Of course that is Lady Amysfort. I have seen her often, but you know one
  never can recall her face&mdash;only a vague impression of something
  delightful. I suppose that is the secret of her power, for no woman remembers
  to be jealous of her. Now tell me the others. Who is the pretty fair-haired
  girl sitting next Lord Appin?"</p>

  <p>"Lady Flora Brune, the Duchess's niece. And then comes Sir Edward
  Considine, the man who has gone from the Cape to Cairo, and from Senegal to
  Somaliland, and has killed more lions than I have partridges. He and Graham
  have just come off a hunting-trip, and that explains why they are so
  gorgeously browned. That is Graham on your right, sitting next Lady
  Warcliff&mdash;the little man with blue eyes and a fair moustache. He went to
  Klondyke before it was fashionable, and has been in half-a-dozen wars, and is
  a Lieutenant-Colonel, though he is only thirty-five. He is the mainstay of
  that precarious institution, our Intelligence Department."</p>

  <p>"Speak low," said Mrs Yorke, "and tell me who the people are on our side.
  Who is the big man next me? He looks like a lawyer."</p>

  <p>"I expect you have heard his name in the States. He is Wakefield, the man
  who was Premier of Canada, and now devotes his life to preaching imperial
  unity. He is a scholar as well as a publicist, which is rare enough in these
  days. Do you know his neighbour?"</p>

  <p>"The pretty dark child with the earnest eyes? No. Yes,&mdash;isn't she
  Laura Haystoun's girl?"</p>

  <p>"Quite right. And now," said Hugh in a whisper, "you know everybody,
  except the people on my left. The first is Lady Lucy Gardner. Extraordinarily
  handsome, I think, though she is no longer young, and has been through all
  the worst climates in the world. Her husband is the Governor of East Africa,
  and is now taking his leave salmon-fishing in Norway, while his wife lends
  official countenance to this gathering. On the whole she is the bravest woman
  I know, and one of the cleverest. The man between her and the Duchess is Mr
  Lowenstein, whose name you must have seen in the papers. He is the
  whipping-boy of our opponents&mdash;why, I cannot guess, for a more modest,
  gentle soul I never met. You may have heard his story. He made a great
  fortune when quite young, and married a very beautiful girl, the daughter of
  a Scotch peer. People said she sold herself for his wealth, for he is, as you
  may observe, a Jew, and not very good to look upon. I believe, however, that
  it was a real love match, and certainly they made a devoted couple. Then she
  died suddenly, two years ago, and he got rid of all his houses and pictures,
  and tried to bury himself abroad. Carey saw his chance, hunted him out, and
  managed to put a new interest in life into him. Now, as you know, he is hand
  and glove with him in all his schemes. He is said to be one of the first
  financial geniuses alive, but he has no courage or nerve, and these Carey
  supplies in the partnership."</p>

  <p>"I like his face," said Mrs Yorke thoughtfully; "there is a fire somewhere
  behind his eyes. But then I differ from most of my countrymen in liking Jews.
  You can do something with them&mdash;stir them up to follow some mad ideal,
  and they are never vulgar at heart. If we must have magnates, I would rather
  Jews had the money. It doesn't degrade them, and they have the infallible
  good taste of the East at the back of their heads. No Northerner should be
  rich, unless he happens to be also a genius."</p>

  <p>"Genius, I suppose, means some consuming passion which burns up the
  vulgarity. We are talking about wealth, Lady Lucy," Hugh said, turning to his
  other neighbour. "Mrs Yorke will only permit it in the case of the elect.
  Otherwise it offends her sense of fitness."</p>

  <p>The lady cast a glance over the room. "This house, for instance. It is so
  flawless and therefore so refreshing. And yet, when I think how much it must
  cost to have such a palace in the wilderness, I grow giddy. I am not sure if
  we have any right to be so comfortable."</p>

  <p>Lord Appin caught the last words, and leaned over the table. "Surely that
  is an exploded heresy," he said, in the rich and exquisite voice which had
  made him <i>par excellence</i> the Public Orator of England. "I thought we
  had long ago given up the idea that austerity of mind depended upon
  discomfort of body. The Simple Life is the last refuge of complicated and
  restless souls. For myself I know no such stimulus to action as a good
  dinner, and to thought as a beautiful room."</p>

  <p>"I am not certain," said Hugh. "It may be some tincture of Calvinism in my
  blood, but I confess I never feel quite happy unless I am a little miserable.
  When I am doing work I detest there is a glow of satisfaction about me which
  I miss when I am swimming along in something which is quite congenial. You
  remember Bagehot's account of Lord Althorp, who gave up hunting after his
  wife's death, not because he thought it wrong, but because he felt he had no
  business to be so happy as hunting made him. I am sure that we are happiest
  when doing something difficult and unpleasant. The cup wants a dash of
  bitters to make it palatable, for if taken neat it is sickly."</p>

  <p>"How true that is," sighed Mrs Yorke. "Happiness lies only in a divine
  unrest; and if you are lapped in comfort you stagnate and miss it."</p>

  <p>"That is the worst piece of fallacious Stoicism I have ever heard," Lord
  Appin said firmly. "It means nothing but a low vitality. If you are so morbid
  as to be dominated by your surroundings, then what you say is true enough.
  But to the philosophic soul environment matters nothing. He is happy alike in
  camp, court, and cottage. He will even preserve a modest gaiety in the House
  of Lords."</p>

  <p>"That is not my nature," said Lady Amysfort with conviction. "You may be
  right&mdash;as a counsel of perfection. But which of us attains to that
  austere height?"</p>

  <p>"I frankly confess I don't," Lord Appin replied. "I have just been saying
  how much I owe to a good dinner and a pretty room. But some of us do. Carey
  does, I think&mdash;and of Launceston I am certain. What is your view,
  Teddy?"</p>

  <p>Sir Edward Considine had been explaining to the appreciative Lady Flora
  the plan of his recent shooting-trip; but both had been drawn by Lord Appin's
  proximity to listen to him. His soft voice when he spoke was a strange
  contrast to his hard, weather-worn face.</p>

  <p>"It is all a question of that romance which most of us spend our lives
  looking for. Luxury is nothing in itself, but in its proper setting it can be
  an inspiration. A week ago I was perfectly happy. Graham and I were living in
  the most beastly discomfort, but then we were on the move and we had the
  excitement of sport, and we never thought about it. To-night, also, I am
  perfectly happy; but if all this had been in London, and I had been having
  months of it, I should probably have been miserable. You may imagine what it
  is to jog on all day through the hot bush with the dust of weeks on you, and
  your clothes in rags, and no food but tinned stuff. And then suddenly this
  afternoon we came to the gates of this place, and paid off our caravan-boys,
  from a hundred miles north&mdash;and in five minutes exchanged barbarism for
  civilisation. I wallowed in a bath, and my man was waiting with clean English
  things, and here I am, like the prodigal son after the husks, clothed and in
  my right mind. I call that romance, and there is no keener pleasure. But you
  must have the contrast."</p>

  <p>Lady Flora nodded approval, recalling apparently kindred experiences in
  her short life. But the discussion was put an end to by Carey's voice from
  the head of the table. He began a little nervously, as if he were proposing a
  toast and had doubts how it would be honoured. For so massive a figure his
  voice was singularly high-pitched and small, so that he was the predestined
  victim of mimics. But there was a force behind it which arrested the ear.</p>

  <p>"I think," he began, "that this is the time when I ought to say something
  about why we are all here. You don't need to be told that your company is in
  itself a sufficient delight to me. But this is not meant to be an ordinary
  party. Things have moved very fast lately in politics, and most of us have
  got our eyes a little dazzled. We want time to collect our wits, and think
  things out,&mdash;not only politics, but our whole scheme of life, our
  ambitions, the things which at the bottom of our hearts we care most for. We
  are all agreed, more or less, and we represent different sides of experience,
  so that we can supplement one another's deficiencies. For the moment the
  fates are against us, and I thought that, like the Apostle Paul, we should
  come out into the wilderness and reflect a little. We are only spectators at
  present, and it is an excellent chance to get our minds clear about what we
  want while we are looking on at the comedy which others are going to play for
  us."</p>

  <p>Carey paused to sip his wine, and Mr Wakefield, who had a talent for trite
  quotation, declaimed with gusto the well-known lines of Lucretius:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">"Suave, mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis,<br>
  E terra magnum alterius spectare laborem;<br>
  Non quia vexari quemquamst jucunda voluptas,<br>
  Sed quibus ipse malis careas quia cernere suave est.<br>
  Suave etiam belli certamina magna tueri<br>
  Per campos instructa tua sine parte pericli."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>De Rerum Natura</i>, ii. 1-6. "Pleasant it is, when
  the winds are tossing the waters of the mighty sea, to behold from the land
  another's mighty toil&mdash;not that there is sweet delight in another's
  affliction, but that it is pleasant to see griefs from which thou thyself art
  free. Pleasant also is it to witness the great conflicts of war joined
  through the plains, thyself with no share in the peril."</p><br>

  <p>"Translate, please," Mrs Yorke whispered to Hugh.</p>

  <p>"It means that it is great fun to have a good seat in the stalls and watch
  other people making idiots of themselves on the stage."</p>

  <p>"We have seen many strange things in the last months," Carey went on. "Our
  creed has been dragged in the mire, and by those who professed to reverence
  it. Every decaying interest which wanted help has been told that in it could
  be found its peculiar salvation. Every vulgar feeling in the whole treasury
  of our national vulgarity has been enlisted in its support. Small wonder that
  England is a little sick of the very name of Empire. The result, of course,
  is a return to tradition. The lack-lustre creeds of fifty years ago have
  acquired a kind of splendour in contrast with the dullness of our faith. The
  old armoury has been ransacked, and the rusty flintlocks have all been
  burnished up. They make an imposing show on parade, and people have not yet
  begun to think what will happen in the day of battle. For the moment England
  is insular again, and the past three centuries have been forgotten."</p>

  <p>Lord Appin was in the throes of a quotation. "'Little England, which was
  our reproach, has become our glory,'" he interrupted,&mdash;"'the little
  England of Shakespeare and Milton and Cromwell has conquered the Greater
  Britain of Baron Steinberg and Mr Bernstein.' The words, I need scarcely say,
  are not my own, but those of a bright young Liberal journalist, whose
  contributions to the daily press afford me much innocent pleasure."</p>

  <p>"So be it," said Carey cheerfully. "The phase will pass, that we well
  know. As a philosopher you realise that, to use your barbarous jargon, Being
  can only develop through non-Being and the Infinite through the negations of
  the Finite. We have a living creative faith, and we are not disheartened
  because the people for the moment blaspheme their deities. But, as I have
  said, it is the occasion to examine ourselves and find the reason of that
  faith which is in us."</p>

  <p>"We need a definition," said Hugh, who had been studying attentively the
  sphinx-like face of his host. "I call myself an Imperialist, and so does the
  noisy fellow at the street corner; but if I am pressed to explain I can give
  no summary statement of my creed."</p>

  <p>"Is not the reason because it is not a creed but a faith?" Lady Lucy's
  clear voice had a peculiar power of compelling attention. "You cannot carve
  an epic on a nutshell or expound Christianity in an aphorism. If I could
  define Imperialism satisfactorily in a sentence I should be very suspicious
  of its truth."</p>

  <p>"No," said Carey, "we don't want a definition. By its fruits ye shall know
  it. It is a spirit, an attitude of mind, an unconquerable hope. You can
  phrase it in a thousand ways without exhausting its content. It is a sense of
  the destiny of England. It is the wider patriotism which conceives our people
  as a race and not as a chance community. But we might take opinions. Let us
  each give his or her own description, beginning with Mrs Deloraine."</p>

  <p>The lady looked a little confused. "I call it an enlarged sense of the
  beauty and mystery of the world."</p>

  <p>"How true!" said Mrs Yorke. "May I have that for my definition too, Mr
  Carey?" There seemed a general agreement on this among the women.</p>

  <p>Lord Launceston smiled a little sadly. "I don't yet see my way to any
  summary. It is a spirit moving upon the waters, a dumb faith in the hearts of
  many simple men up and down the world, who are building better than they
  know&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">'Not till the hours of light return,<br>
  All we have built do we discern.'"</p>

  <p>Lord Appin, who was eating grapefruit, looked up quizzically. "I call it,
  in the language of my hobby, the realisation of the need of a quantitative
  basis for all qualitative development. It is a hard saying, which I shall
  expound later."</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake let us keep out of mysticism," broke in Mr Wakefield,
  who detested Lord Appin's metaphysics. "I define Imperialism as the closer
  organic connection under one Crown of a number of autonomous nations of the
  same blood, who can spare something of their vitality for the administration
  of vast tracts inhabited by lower races,&mdash;a racial aristocracy
  considered in their relation to the subject peoples, a democracy in their
  relation to each other."</p>

  <p>Mr Astbury nodded. "I take Mr Wakefield's definition for mine."</p>

  <p>"And I," said Considine, "call it romance. I have no head for political
  theories, but I have an eye for a fact. It is the impulse to deeds rather
  than talk, the ardour of a race which is renewing its youth. It is what made
  the Elizabethans, and all ages of adventure."</p>

  <p>"For my part," said Lady Amysfort, "I think it simply Toryism under a new
  name&mdash;the Toryism of our great men, Bolingbroke, Pitt, Canning,
  Disraeli. Toryism was never Conservatism, remember. It was a positive creed,
  both destructive and constructive. Liberalism is a doctrine of abstractions,
  right or wrong, which bear no true relation to national life. Toryism has
  always held by the instincts and traditions of the people, and when our
  island became an empire it became naturally Imperialism."</p>

  <p>"As a Liberal Imperialist, Caroline," said the Duchess with some asperity,
  "I profoundly disagree. I wish George were here to say what I think of your
  history."</p>

  <p>Mr Lowenstein's restless eyes had been wandering from one speaker to the
  other, and he had several times opened his mouth as if to say something. Now
  he was about to begin when Miss Haystoun forestalled him.</p>

  <p>"I should like to define it in very old words," she said shyly, in her low
  intense voice. "It is the spirit which giveth life as against the letter
  which killeth. It means a renunciation of old forms and conventions, and the
  clear-eyed facing of a new world in the knowledge that when the half-gods go
  the true gods must come."</p>

  <p>"That is beautifully said," murmured Mr Lowenstein.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, Marjory, I think it is almost blasphemous." The Duchess, who had
  been fretting for some time under the turn the conversation had taken, had at
  last succeeded in catching Lady Amysfort's eye, and the ladies rose to leave.
  Immediately the men reassorted themselves according to their preference.
  Astbury took his port round to the vacant chair next Mr Wakefield; Carey,
  Lord Appin, and Lord Launceston formed a coterie by themselves; Graham and
  Considine revelled silently in the novel luxury of good cigars, and Hugh
  joined Lowenstein, by whom he was cross-examined concerning the names of his
  fellow-guests.</p>

  <p>It was not Carey's habit to linger at table, and the sound of a beautiful
  voice singing a song of Schubert drew the men soon to the inner hall, where
  Mrs Deloraine sat at the piano. At each end of the apartment log-fires burned
  brightly; outside the white verandah gleamed chill in the frosty moonlight;
  and the place was lit only by the hearths and two tall silver lamps beside
  the piano. A soft aromatic scent&mdash;the mingling of flowers and
  wood-smoke&mdash;filled the air.</p>

  <p>Lord Appin took his place beside Mrs Deloraine. Carey stood in the centre
  of a great fireplace, and the others resorted to chairs and couches. Hugh,
  finding a very soft rug, settled himself at Lady Flora's feet.</p>

  <p>The lady at the piano finished "Der Wanderer" and began the song from
  <i>La Princesse Lointaine</i>. It was a melody of her own making, very wild
  and tender, and in the dim light her wonderful voice held the listeners like
  a spell.</p>

  <p class="verse">"Car c'est chose suprême<br>
  D'aimer sans qu'on vous aime,<br>
  D'aimer toujours, quand même,<br>
       Sans cesse,<br>
  D'une amour incertaine,<br>
  Plus noble d'être vaine,<br>
  Et j'aime la lointaine<br>
       Princesse!"</p><br>

  <p>When she ceased there was silence for a little. The place and time were so
  strange&mdash;there among delicate furniture and all the trappings of a high
  civilisation, looking out over the primeval wilds. Savage beasts roamed a
  mile off in that untamed heart of the continent. The most sophisticated
  members of the company felt the glamour of the unknown around them. Lord
  Launceston rose quietly and walked to the window, where he gazed abstractedly
  at the starry sky; Lady Lucy was looking into the red glow of the fire;
  Marjory Haystoun and Lady Flora sat, chin on hand, in a kind of dream. Only
  Graham and Considine were unconscious of the spell. Months of hunting and
  going to bed at sundown had spoiled them for civilised hours, and they had
  dropped off peacefully to sleep in their chairs.</p>

  <p>Carey broke the silence. "Here we are in Prester John's country," he said.
  "He may have had a daughter called Melissinde, and she may have been the Far-
  away Princess to some Portuguese adventurer who left his ship at Mombasa and
  wandered up into the hills. Do you realise how strange it is to be sitting
  here? Thirty years ago this was bush, with lions roaring in it, and the
  pioneers who may have camped here were three hundred miles from a white man,
  with hostile tribes around them, and the Lord knows what in front. I remember
  when I first came it was from the west. I had been trekking for months in
  Uganda, right across from Albert Edward and the Semliki to what is now Port
  Florence. I had had a bad dose of fever, and when we crawled up into the
  foothills I was as weak as a cat. We stayed here for a bit to recruit our
  strength, and, when I could stand, I went one evening, just about sunset, and
  looked down into the Tropics. That hour is as clear to me as if it had been
  yesterday. There was a fresh, clean wind blowing, which put life into my
  bones, and I stood on the edge and looked down thousands of feet over the
  little hill-tops to the great forest and on to the horizon, which was all red
  and gold. I knew that there was fever and heat and misery down below, but in
  the twilight it was transfigured, and seemed only a kind of fairyland
  designed for happiness. I was a poor man then, poor and ambitious, hungering
  for something, I did not know what. It was not wealth, for I never wanted
  wealth for its own sake. It was a purpose in life I sought, and in that
  moment I found it. For I realised that the great thing in the world is to
  reach the proper vantage-ground. I learned that things are not what they seem
  to the fighter in the midst of them; that the truth can only be known to the
  man on the hill-top. I realised that the heavenly landscape below me was far
  more the real Africa than the place of dust and fever I had left. And in that
  hour I saw my work, and, I think, too, the ideal of our race. If we cannot
  create a new heaven, we can create a new earth. 'The wilderness and the
  solitary place shall be glad for us; the desert shall rejoice and blossom as
  the rose.'"</p>

  <p>The Duchess got up. "Marjory," she said, "you are nodding, and as for
  Alastair and Sir Edward, they have been asleep for the last half-hour. I
  think we are all ready for bed after our long journey."</p>

  <p>As Hugh lit her candle at the foot of the staircase, she whispered to him
  confidentially, "When Francis begins to talk in blank verse, I always feel a
  little nervous. I think it is quite time for the women to say
  good-night."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">MORNING at Musuru came as a surprise to those who remembered
  the hot noontide of the previous day. For the air was as bitter as an English
  winter, and, looking from the windows, they saw the valleys filled with cold
  mist and the lawns whitened with hoar-frost. The result was that all the
  women breakfasted in their rooms. And of the men, only Hugh, Astbury, and Mr
  Wakefield appeared in the dining-room, where a roaring wood-fire gave the
  early risers a sense of comfort to temper their consciousness of virtue. That
  consciousness, however, was rudely disturbed by the discovery that Graham and
  Considine had breakfasted at least two hours before and had gone out
  heroically into the chilly morning.</p>

  <p>Mr Wakefield stood warming his back at the fire, in the attitude of a
  Master of Hounds before a hunt breakfast. He had arrayed himself in Harris
  tweeds, and his legs were clothed with new buckskin gaiters. Hugh and
  Astbury, who knew something of the Musuru climate, had put on thinner
  shooting suits.</p>

  <p>The elder man helped himself to mealie-meal porridge and cream. "We had an
  interesting talk last night, and I hope during our visit we may reach some
  valuable conclusions. But I foresee trouble ahead unless we can keep Lord
  Appin away from Hegel and put a stop to Carey's infernal mysticism. In my
  opinion, also, there are too many women for a really helpful discussion. We
  must, above all things, be practical. Now, I have here a kind of syllabus
  which Carey gave me last night&mdash;a list of the subjects we are to
  consider, and the order we are to take them in. To-night we are to begin with
  contemporary English politics and the present position of parties. Well, at
  any rate, that is relevant, if dull. Then we go on to the constitutional
  apparatus of Empire, the question of our tropical possessions, the economic
  and administrative problems. All these are very much to the point. But I
  notice at the end the sinister announcement that the concluding days are to
  be spent in talking about the ethical basis of Empire, and its relation to
  intellectual and aesthetic progress. That means, I fear, more of the
  unpromising mysticism of which we had a taste last night. We must keep
  Imperialism out of the clouds, or how on earth is it to commend itself to
  business men? I speak from a wide knowledge of the Colonies, and I assure you
  that what they want is a business proposition. We have, of course, our own
  ideals, but they are framed in a different language from yours, and I need
  hardly tell you that a common ideal, held with a difference, has proved in
  the past the most potent of disruptive forces. Let every man add his own
  poetry to the facts, but for Heaven's sake let us get the facts agreed upon
  first."</p>

  <p>Mr Wakefield's eloquence was checked by his appetite, and by Hugh's
  warning that the word "Empire" was tabooed in the daytime. "Carey and I
  agreed," said he, "that we should degenerate into a debating society and get
  bored to death with each other unless we placed strict limits to our
  enthusiasm. So our discussions will not begin till dinner-tune. Before that
  we are at liberty to think as much as we please, but we must not talk about
  it. The resources of this place are limitless. We can shoot and fish and ride
  and walk; there is an excellent library; the finest scenery in the world is
  at our door. In the daytime we are flaneurs, without a thought except how to
  amuse ourselves. In the evening we can devote ourselves to your 'business
  proposition.'"</p>

  <p>Mr Wakefield acquiesced a little reluctantly, and, having finished
  breakfast, ensconced himself in the library with a box of cigars and a French
  novel. Astbury went off to do some writing, and Hugh devoted an hour to his
  neglected correspondence. Meanwhile the mist was clearing, the sun had come
  out and burned up the rime, and, as he looked from the window, he saw a pale
  blue sky, which promised heat, and all the mystery of bright colour which a
  tropical morning displays. So, after going to his room for a book, he found a
  long wicker-chair on the verandah, and, lighting a pipe, settled himself for
  a peaceful forenoon.</p>

  <p>He found it hard to read, however. The wide landscape shimmering below
  him, the calling of strange birds, the wafts of strange scents from the
  garden distracted his thoughts. By-and-by a trim white figure in a large
  sun-hat came along, and he said good-morning to Lady Flora.</p>

  <p>The girl refused a chair, and seated herself on the parapet of the
  verandah.</p>

  <p>"I am all alone, so I must come and talk to you, Mr Somerville. Aunt Susan
  and Lady Amysfort and Mrs Yorke are not down yet. Charlotte Wilbraham has
  taken Lord Launceston for a walk, Lady Lucy and Mr Lowenstein are talking
  business, Marjory and Mr Astbury are talking politics, and Barbara Deloraine
  is looking at a big botany book with pictures. I found Colonel Alastair and
  Sir Edward in the stables skinning beasts, and they were so covered with
  blood and the place smelt so horribly that I could not stay. Lady Warcliff is
  writing hundreds of letters about some of her emigration societies. I am sure
  she fusses far too much about her work. She behaves always like a weary Atlas
  holding up a world which doesn't in the least want to be held up. Last of
  all, I found Lord Appin deep in a big German book, but he told me to be a
  good girl and run away. So you are my only refuge. Tell me what you are
  reading in that little book with so many pencil markings in it."</p>

  <p>"Plato," said Hugh. "I am taking advantage of my idleness to renew my
  acquaintance with the great masters. But it's very hard to find the proper
  book for such a morning."</p>

  <p>"Nearly as hard as to find the proper clothes. When my maid called me she
  said it was 'freezin' 'ard,' so I put on my thickest tweed skirt. When I had
  finished dressing I saw the sun coming out, so I put on a lighter one. And
  when I came downstairs and went out on the verandah and saw that it was quite
  summery, I had to go back and change into summer things. Two changes in a
  morning are really enough to upset one. I feel as if I had been
  inconstant."</p>

  <p>Hugh shut his book and began to refill his pipe. "I think I'll talk to you
  instead of reading Plato. What would you like to talk about?"</p>

  <p>"This place, first of all," said the girl. "Did you ever see anything to
  match it? I am so glad Aunt Susan brought me. I fancied we should be living
  in a log cabin with Kaffir servants, and I seriously thought of leaving my
  maid at home, as I did last year in Norway. Instead, I find the most
  beautiful and comfortable house I ever dreamed of. And I like the idea of our
  party so much. We are going to talk high politics, and I am sure we have got
  some very clever men to talk them. It is such a refreshing change from the
  ordinary 'cure.' My first two seasons I went with Mother to stupid German
  places, where one saw the same people who had bored one in town and talked
  the same foolish gossip. It is a blessing to be in a place where one can talk
  about better things than other people's love affairs."</p>

  <p>Hugh laughed. "You are growing old, Lady Flora, if that topic has ceased
  to amuse you. Have you had a hard Season?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty hard, and I suppose I am growing old, for people are beginning to
  pall on me. Three years ago, when I first came out, I was tolerant of
  everything and anybody. But now I seem to have too much of it all. I want a
  little peace to get my mind clear and to know what I like and who are my
  friends. Didn't some one say that the art of life was to make up your mind
  what you really and truly wanted? I am afraid I shall soon be that deplorable
  young woman, 'her name was Dull.'"</p>

  <p>"You have been reading the 'Pilgrim's Progress,' and you are afraid that
  you are one of the citizens of Vanity Fair?"</p>

  <p>"I am horribly afraid. At the bottom of my heart I would really live
  almost anywhere else&mdash;even with the tiresome old Interpreter or the
  spinsters of the House Beautiful. Where do you live, Mr Somerville?"</p>

  <p>Hugh shook his head doubtfully. "Various places up and down the Way. A
  good deal in the Valley of Humiliation. Now and then in Doubting Castle. But
  not much, I think, in Vanity Fair."</p>

  <p>"No," said the girl, "I don't seem to have seen you about so much lately.
  Have you grown tired of the world?"</p>

  <p>"I have so many things to think about nowadays. As you were saying, the
  secret of life is to find out what one really wants, and I have discovered
  that a little of Society goes a long way with me. I only liked it because of
  the romance which it has for us all at first. When I grew up properly and the
  gilt was rubbed off I found it hard and stupid: so like a wise man I seek my
  romance elsewhere. You are growing up, too, and finding the same thing."</p>

  <p>Lady Flora climbed off her perch and leant over the balustrade, looking
  down into the infinite blue distances.</p>

  <p>"At any rate we are both in the Delectable Mountains now," she said, "and
  we have the Shepherds, too, and they may teach us something. But I wish we
  were going to talk about a more helpful subject. Of course I believe in
  Imperialism, and I canvassed a great deal for cousin Charlie at the election.
  He was beaten, poor boy, and he said it was largely my fault, for I always
  agreed with anything anybody said to me. And I am much more interested in the
  Empire than in England, for all the nicest people I know are in Tibet, or
  Nigeria, or some remote place. But at the same time I can't help feeling that
  any politics are rather a far-away thing to me."</p>

  <p>"And yet I don't see why they should be," said Hugh, rising and looking
  over the balustrade beside the girl. "We are all citizens,&mdash;I am giving
  you the kind of answer an elderly paternal person would give,&mdash;and we
  have long got over the old foolish idea that politics were only a game for
  men, and for a few men at that. What we are going to talk about is the whole
  scheme of life which a new horizon and a new civic ideal bring with them. It
  affects the graces as closely as the business of life, art and literature as
  well as economics and administration. Suppose a small tribe lived in a cave
  and never saw the daylight. One day the barriers at the door fall down, and
  they look out on a blue sky and meadows and a river, and are free to go out
  to them. It wouldn't be only the modes of tribal government that would be
  altered by the illumination."</p>

  <p>"No, I suppose not. But the whole thing is still very unfamiliar to me,
  and I cannot understand the language you all talk in. I've never been able to
  follow even Lord Appin's jokes, though he's a relation, and Mr Carey speaks
  like a very impressive but very obscure bishop. Perhaps Lord Launceston may
  be simpler. He is so kind and wearied and sad, and his face is so like a
  Burne-Jones knight, that some day I shall certainly kiss him, if I am not
  too afraid of Charlotte Wilbraham."</p>

  <p>"You would prefer that we should sit in conclave on the profound subject:
  How is a young lady of twenty or thereabouts, who is a little tired of being
  frivolous, to attain satisfaction in life? Upon my soul, I think that is a
  much more difficult question than the other."</p>

  <p>"You are very tiresome, Mr Somerville," said the girl. "You think I am
  only a butterfly. I may be, but I can at least look beyond my cabbage-leaf,
  and I am very very discontented."</p>

  <p>"Why not try good works?" Hugh asked.</p>

  <p>"'Journeys end in mothers' meetings!' No! I've tried them in an amateur
  way, and the works aren't really good. You make yourself miserable, and only
  fuss and patronise the poor, so nobody is a penny the better."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, there is the intellectual life?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't the brains. It is all very well for Marjory, who has read
  everything, and finds life far too short for the things she burns to do. I
  don't live at white-heat like her. More by token," said Lady Flora, peering
  into the garden, "she is at this moment discoursing with Mr Astbury among the
  oleanders. Bareheaded too! I wonder if she knows that this is mid-day in the
  Tropics. She'll be cut off in the pride of her youth and beauty."</p>

  <p>"There only remains falling in love and marrying," said Hugh solemnly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr Somerville, I never expected to hear you say anything so banal. As
  if any short cut to happiness lay that way! If you can't find a philosophy of
  life before marriage, you won't find it after. It is shirking the question,
  not solving it."</p>

  <p>The girl swung round and revealed a laughing face and dancing eyes. "I am
  a better actress than I thought, and you were quite taken in. I am really
  blissfully happy, happier than I think I've ever been before. But I want to
  make the most of this place, so I have a scheme to offer. Why should we not
  have a special conference on our own account? The discussions in the evenings
  will be the voice of age. Let us have the voice of youth&mdash;you and
  me&mdash;in the mornings. I shall want to ask so many questions and have so
  many things explained to me. Besides, I may contribute really valuable
  suggestions in our <i>tête-à-tête</i>, which I should be much too shy to
  launch at the dinner-table. Shall we make it a bargain?"</p>

  <p>As they shook hands on the compact the gong&mdash;aforetime the war-drum
  of a neighbouring tribe&mdash;sounded for luncheon.</p><br>

  <p>Conversation at dinner was begun by a speech of some length from the
  Duchess of Maxton. In the afternoon she had been driven by Carey in an
  American buggy round a settlement of some fifty families from England.
  Enthusiasm was not commonly her <i>rôle</i>, but as a practical woman and a
  practical farmer she had been carried out of herself in admiration of the
  success of his experiment. She had tried the same thing on her husband's
  Suffolk estate, where it maintained a precarious life, fed by frequent doles
  from her own purse. Her first impression, therefore, had been that this was
  but another of Carey's extravagant hobbies, and she had been greatly
  astonished to learn that it paid him six per cent on his outlay. The vast
  fields of tobacco and maize, the strips of lucerne, the orchards, the plain
  substantial houses, the well-made roads, the schoolhouse, the buxom
  contentment of the women, the healthy colour of the children, and the hard
  well-being of the men&mdash;she did not know what the most to admire. "How do
  you do it?" she had inquired, and had been told simply, "Management."</p>

  <p>"Where did you get the people from?" she asked at dinner.</p>

  <p>"Some from my old home in Devonshire&mdash;small farmers who could not
  make a living in England, young shepherds who wanted to be on their own, and
  a younger son or two who were not above labouring with their hands. But I
  wanted all sorts; so you will find South Africans and New Zealanders and
  Canadians in the settlement. I made a point of having none but men who had
  got the love of the soil in them. I don't think of the place as an emigration
  experiment. I wanted my estate farmed to the best purposes, and I hunted
  about for the best tenants. It is true that in time all will own their own
  farms, but even as freeholders they will still be in a real sense my own
  people."</p>

  <p>"The danger I foresee in all such work," said Mr Wakefield, who found Lady
  Flora and Lady Amysfort, his two neighbours, a little inattentive to his
  conversation,&mdash;"the danger is that too much depends upon the will of a
  single man. One man like you, Carey, is a godsend; a hundred would be a
  calamity. For, when all is said and done, you are feudalists and aristocrats
  at heart. Now I maintain that the basis of empire is a democratic
  one&mdash;that is to say, empire as understood in the free Colonies, which
  are its real support. Africa, if I may say so, has been too much monopolised
  by 'men of destiny'&mdash;Rhodes, for example, and yourself. In Canada, in
  New Zealand, in Australia, you are inconceivable. I appreciate your work as
  much as any man, but I feel that it creates a false precedent. It is a
  precedent, I admit, which has small chance of being followed," he added,
  smiling.</p>

  <p>Carey nodded and looked across the table to Lord Appin. "Mr Wakefield has
  brought us to the subject which we had arranged to discuss to-night. I think
  you will all agree that it is our first business to look at the condition of
  political thought in England, and incidentally at the position of political
  parties. England, even Mr Wakefield will admit, is still the imperial centre
  of gravity. Our creed is, of course, not identified with any party formula,
  but we Imperialists must work through existing agencies. It is most
  important, therefore, to know what materials we have to deal with."</p>

  <p>"May I make a suggestion before we begin?" Mr Wakefield interrupted. "I
  agree with you, Carey, about the importance of the subject. But it is one
  which lends itself most readily to a barren speculative treatment. As ours is
  a practical inquiry, I suggest that we keep very close to facts and disregard
  what I believe is called the metaphysical basis of politics. I mean that in
  discussing Liberalism we should not ask ourselves what Liberalism may imply
  in its ultimate analysis, but merely what it means to the several millions
  who have voted Liberal at the polls. Otherwise we shall talk in a language
  which few of us can pretend to understand. We are not all philosophers like
  Lord Appin."</p>

  <p>Lord Appin mildly dissented. "If I may say so, we are all philosophers,
  even Lady Flora, though we don't all of us know it. To be a philosopher it is
  not necessary that you should have formulated your creed in a system; it is
  sufficient if it governs your thought and conduct. I could label you all with
  your appropriate badges. I myself, for example, with certain private
  reservations, am a follower of Hegel. You, Mr Wakefield, I should class
  without hesitation as a disciple of the much-esteemed and lately deceased Mr
  Herbert Spencer. Lord Launceston, if I recall his Oxford reputation rightly,
  agrees with me. Our host is as fine an instance as I know of the
  Transcendental Idealist, though I don't suppose he has ever read a page of
  Fichte. Hugh, I think, is one of those peculiar people who go back to Kant
  and misunderstand that great man's meaning. Mrs Deloraine is a Platonist, and
  my sister is in her methods a crude Baconian. Even Sir Edward has a creed,
  and worships, with Nietzsche, the Superman. Did you ever hear his name,
  Teddy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said that gentleman pensively; "and I once read a book of
  his&mdash; something about 'Zarathustra'&mdash;which my wife gave me for a
  birthday present. I liked it so much that I called a horse of mine after the
  author&mdash;won the Oaks in '99, you may remember. There was rather a muddle
  about it, for it was ridden by a jockey called Neish, and the sporting papers
  confused the two, and made him the horse and the other fellow the
  jockey."</p>

  <p>"To return to what I was saying," continued Mr Wakefield with some slight
  asperity of tone, "I do earnestly beg of you all to keep on the hard highroad
  of facts. We have enough political metaphysicians in the world, and their
  works are to be found in the leading articles of the halfpenny Radical press.
  Our <i>raison d'être</i> is that we look more squarely at the realities of
  life. We have ample knowledge in our party to reconstruct the policies of the
  globe. For Heaven's sake let us keep off windy generalities."</p>

  <p>Carey smiled benevolently during the interruption. "I am not a practical
  man. If I were, I should still be managing a little mine on the Rand. But I
  agree with Mr Wakefield up to a point&mdash;we must take full account of the
  data we have to work upon. That is why I propose that we should begin with
  the state of politics in England to-day. On this I have one remark to make,
  with which I think all will agree. The old creeds which still appear in the
  text-books are as dead as Julius Caesar."</p>

  <p>The Duchess looked uneasy. Born of high Tory stock, she had married the
  head of a great Whig house and had zealously adopted its politics. "I do not
  admit that Liberalism is dead," she said. "On the contrary, it was never more
  alive than to-day. It has won a victory unprecedented since the date of the
  great Reform Bill."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, Susan, I maintain that it is as dead as a door-nail. And to
  appease you I will add that Conservatism&mdash;for Lady Amysfort's sake I
  will not say Toryism&mdash;is in the same position. I propose to ask Lord
  Appin, who still reads the newspapers, to quote to us definitions of
  Liberalism, prepared both by friend and foe, and then I will ask you if the
  thing has not long been decently buried, though its wraith still walks the
  earth. Lady Amysfort will be kind enough to provide us with some account of
  that peculiar faith which she calls Toryism and proposes to identify with
  Imperialism. When we know what are the avowed creeds of the parties, we can
  fairly consider how much or how little of the vital spark is left in them.
  Then we can talk of Imperialism and those new doctrines which are its real
  rivals. Our country is hungering and thirsting for a living faith. We are all
  like sick folk by the Pool of Bethesda, waiting for the angel to descend and
  trouble the waters."</p>

  <p>"I think, Francis, we might wait for the angel in the outer hall," said
  the voice of the Duchess. "It is very cold to-night, and that place is my
  ideal of comfort. Let us all go and have our coffee there and talk."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">THE great log-fire in the outer hall threw strange shadows
  upon the walls, and made the lion heads grin like outlandish ogres. Lamps
  were lit on the email tables, and the company settled in deep chairs, within
  the glow of the fire but outside its disquieting warmth.</p>

  <p>Lord Appin, who had seated himself near the centre of the circle, produced
  a little volume in which newspaper extracts were pasted.</p>

  <p>"I am, as you know," he said, "a connoisseur of public opinion. In my
  belief no statesman can afford to neglect the ingenuous manifestations of it
  which from time to time appear in its popular organs. There you will find the
  will of certain classes of the community stated, no doubt with imperfect
  grammar and more imperfect taste, but still with all the frankness and
  confusion of the original. So I subscribe to several press-cutting agencies,
  and my secretary, who knows my desires, keeps for me the more characteristic
  extracts. I ought, however, first of all to define what I mean by public
  opinion. Properly understood, it is the bed-rock, the cardinal fact of all
  democratic politics such as ours. It is the sum total of the instincts,
  traditions, and desires of our race, created not only by reasoned beliefs,
  but by those impalpable forces of persuasion which no contemporary can hope
  to diagnose. I am no despiser of the average man. What he thinks at the
  bottom of his heart, when he thinks at all, is what is sooner or later going
  to happen. Now creeds are not necessarily public opinion. They are the
  attempts to interpret it made by its official interpreters&mdash;preachers,
  journalists, and politicians. When I quote from the Press, therefore, I do
  not profess to be quoting public opinion in its real meaning, but an
  interpretation of it which has a vogue among a certain section of the
  interpreting class.</p>

  <p>"Let me begin with a definition of the creed which has just won so
  conspicuous a victory. The bright flamboyant style betrays its
  source:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"A sigh of thankfulness and hope is heard throughout the
  land. England with no uncertain voice has turned her face against Toryism,
  with all its moral <i>défaillance</i>, its insincerity, its opportunism, its
  lack of seriousness, its narrow and trifling sophistries, its unabashed class
  interest. The white soul of our people turns towards its true sun. Once more
  the large and generous spirit of Liberalism is abroad. We are on the
  threshold of a new era, and behind us lies nothing but confusion. Foreign
  affairs have been conducted from hand to mouth without any perception of
  large issues; domestic affairs have been dominated by an obscurantism which,
  under the influence of momentary panic, blossomed forth into ill-considered
  experiments in reaction. The heart of the nation needed a solemn
  purification, and by the grace of God that purification has come. Men go
  about in the streets to-day with a new light in their eyes&mdash;poor men who
  see at last a hope for their starving households, earnest men who have
  fretted in secret at the long reign of apathy, young men who have now before
  them a career of civic usefulness. From warder to warder runs the
  challenge,'Brother, is it well with the State?' and the answer comes, 'It is
  well!'"</p><br>

  <p>Lord Appin paused. "It is a charming picture of a national renaissance.
  But let us look," he continued, "at what Liberalism has to give:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">"The policy of Liberalism is clear. Men's minds have been
  too long dazzled by the jingo generalities of empire. Imperialism battens on
  the basest attributes of humanity, the lust of conquest and power, the greed
  of gold, the morbid unsettlement and discontent of a degenerate age. It is
  for Liberalism to bring back the people to the paths of political wisdom,
  which are also those of peace and pleasantness. Purity of character must be
  insisted upon in our public men. The heresies of a decadence must be
  expunged, and we must return to the sober and rational orthodoxy of our
  fathers. The House of Commons, the People's House, must be restored to its
  old prestige. The overgrown burden of armaments must be reduced, and England
  must appear before the world as the herald of a truce between nations. The
  cost of administration must be lessened that the private comfort of the
  citizen may be increased. Provision must be made for the old and feeble of
  the land; the slums&mdash;that eyesore of our civilisation&mdash;must be
  opened up to the wholesome air and light; the workman must be placed on a
  level with the master in the economic struggle, and for that purpose raised
  above the caprice of juries; in the exploitation of her neglected assets, the
  State must find work for those who are squeezed out of the capitalist mill.
  For each class of the community the way must be made plain for that
  development which is its due. Education must be freed from the blighting
  influence of clericalism; the liquor traffic must be curbed in the public
  interest; capitalism and the servitude it entails must be checked with a
  strong and earnest hand. In a word, Liberalism must lift again its old
  banner, on which its great master inscribed its never-to-be-forgotten
  creed&mdash;'Peace, Retrenchment, and Reform!'"</p><br>

  <p>"It is a spirited piece of prose," said Lord Appin as he concluded,
  "though I am afraid it is mostly made up of what logicians call 'identical
  propositions.' Notice, too, the refrain throughout, 'Return,' 'our historic
  creed,' political orthodoxy.' Somehow it does not strike me as inspiring, but
  I think it is a not unfair statement of what a great many of the interpreting
  class wish the nation to believe. I propose to read as a pendant some remarks
  of my friend, the editor of the 'International Review.' With him the English
  language is a spiked mace, and perhaps some of the spikes are too long and
  sharp for my liking:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">"Triumphant Liberalism has promulgated its creed, and we
  trust that the world is edified. For ourselves, we can only see pathos in
  colossal travail with a <i>ridiculus mus</i> as the fruit of it. We have
  waited for a sign, and behold! we are referred to an ancient, vulgar, and
  half-effaced street-poster; we ask for some new thing, and we are given the
  oldest of pot-house cries. A contemporary, which claims to be the exponent of
  the new gospel, has given us a long and turgid exposition, in a style adorned
  by imperfectly remembered fragments of the Sermon on the Mount and the
  culture of the Mechanics' Institute. And the result? It is our old friend
  Gladstonianism with a more pronounced Nonconformist accent. The prophet of
  the future, it appears, is that poisonous politician&mdash;we dare not misuse
  the word 'statesman'&mdash;who, with the morbid conscience and purblind eyes
  of the egotist, was ready to sacrifice his country's honour to a fetish
  begotten of his own vanity. England, it seems, is to put her pride in her
  pocket and go whimpering among the nations as an apostle of peace, bleating
  about the grievous cost of her army and navy. The poor are to be elevated by
  tinkering expedients of re-housing and pauperised by doles from the
  Exchequer, while the law will be so amended as to give carte-blanche to mob
  violence. Education will once more be flung into the hands of clerics, only
  the frock-coat will take the place of the cassock, and the snuffle of Little
  Bethel will oust the more scholarly tones of the Church. The prestige of the
  Parliamentary "talking-shop," which all thinking men have long ago come to
  disregard, is to be revived and increased. An egregious economy will play
  havoc with our revenue system, and the deficit will be made up by the
  plunder, not of the rich parvenus, but of the unfortunate owners of ancestral
  lands. Our Empire, won by the blood and sweat of our great progenitors, and
  maintained by that class which alone is worthy of the name of
  Englishmen&mdash;our Empire, which gives to generous youth its only horizon,
  is to be lightly cast aside to satisfy the whimsies of a few dropsical
  pedants. Not one constructive idea emerges from the chaos of absurdities. Not
  once do the propagandists dare to look at the facts of a living world. Let us
  re-shuffle the cards, they say; let us pull down a little here and add a
  little there; but for God's sake do not tell us that conditions can change,
  for we know that our great leader has laid down once and for all the
  principles of our English policy. Let no man lay a finger upon that Ark of
  the Covenant!"</p><br>

  <p>Lord Appin looked up from his book. "There is a great deal more, but that
  is the gist of my friend's criticism; and though I deplore its intemperance,
  I am inclined to agree with it. Liberalism, so far as I can judge, is
  correctly described as a shuffling of the cards. One further quotation I
  cannot resist. My friend goes on to show that the Conservative party is
  equally barren of ideas, and he gives far from flattering portraits of some
  of those leaders&mdash;he calls them 'Mandarins'&mdash;who have just gone out
  of office, and in many cases out of Parliament. 'Oh for one hour,' he
  exclaims, 'of Randolph Churchill!' Then he turns to myself:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Lord Appin stands in a different position. He is, at least,
  untouched by the administrative incompetence of his former colleagues. He may
  choose to play the grand seigneur out of office, but once in the toils of a
  department he shows an industry as unwearied and a mind as acute as any
  statesman who has risen by merit alone. But he is cursed with a fatal
  temperamental weakness. He is intolerant of mediocrity, impatient of the
  pedestrian and the dull, and his shining gifts of intellect and character are
  available only in emergencies. His metaphysical habit of mind interposes a
  veil between him and the will of the people. He will not condescend to join
  in the dusty squabbles amid which the political life must be lived. He will
  do brilliantly in the field if he is permitted either to issue orders from a
  luxurious tent in the rear or to charge some desperate position at the head
  of the Maison du Boi. ... But he will neither fight in the ranks nor in their
  immediate vicinity. The result is that he has fallen out of the battle-line
  of public life. He might have ruled England as Disraeli ruled her, but he has
  chosen to make elegant speeches and write agreeable books. He has, definitely
  and of set purpose, given up to a coterie what was due to the Empire. He
  might have been a second Pitt; he has succeeded in becoming a second Lord
  Houghton."</p><br>

  <p>The quotation was received with amusement by the company, with the
  exception of Mr Wakefield, who had listened to it with serious approval, glad
  of support for the views he had aired at the dinner-table.</p>

  <p>"I have given you the current interpretation of Liberalism," Lord Appin
  continued, "and I have here a long extract containing the creed of the new
  Labour party. I do not propose to read it to you, for it is very long, and
  the gist of it can be put in a few words. It is written by Ainsworth, and is
  an excellent piece of work."</p>

  <p>The Duchess made a mouth of disgust. "I do not see how one can attach much
  value to the views of a man like Mr Ainsworth. He washes so seldom and so
  imperfectly. Oh yes, Flora! I know that your mother was foolish enough to
  take him up, and that she pretends to admire and understand him. But I have
  no patience with such a course. If the man hates us and is going to destroy
  us and all our belongings, then let us treat him as an enemy and not as a
  tame cat."</p>

  <p>"But, Aunt Susan," said Lady Flora, "he is really quite a dear. When he
  came to stay at Wirlesdon he wrote his letter of thanks on our own notepaper,
  and left it on his dressing-table."</p>

  <p>"The gist of Ainsworth's argument," Lord Appin resumed, in a tone of mild
  expostulation, "is more or less what Imperialists say themselves. He claims
  that none of our old creeds are applicable, because the conditions have
  changed, and he asks for a fresh analysis. We shall, of course, differ from
  him profoundly as to the nature of the new conditions and the principles
  which govern their interpretation, but our general attitude is the same.
  Provided the whole Empire is taken as the battle-ground, I am quite content
  to see Socialism and Individualism fight out their quarrel unhampered. So
  there remains for our present consideration only the wide word
  'Conservatism.' The elder Toryism, we shall all agree, is dead. Indeed, I am
  far from certain if it ever existed to any large extent in modern times. I am
  afraid that it was in the main, like the doctrine of Innate Ideas, a fiction
  of its opponents. It still makes an excellent Aunt Sally to knock down on the
  hustings, but a modern Lucian would have to go far afield to find an honest
  exponent of it. In the depths of the country, in vicarages and manor-houses,
  one or two very old or very stupid men and a few innocent women may still
  hold to it. There is, however, a Conservatism&mdash;I beg Lady Amysfort's
  pardon, a Toryism&mdash;which is a more living creed, or perhaps we had
  better call it an attitude of mind. Lady Amysfort is going to be very kind
  and read us her confession of faith."</p>

  <p>The lady thus appealed to flung away her cigarette and, lying back in her
  chair so that the glow of the lamp was behind her head, opened a small
  manuscript.</p>

  <p>"I ought to say," she began, "that I wrote this originally as an address
  to a meeting of Primrose Dames. You know the kind of thing&mdash;the local
  mayoress, the wives of rising tradespeople, and a sprinkling of the female
  clergy. But Henry Parworth, who read it, said that it would break up the
  Primrose League altogether, so I had to give them a chapter of 'Sibyl'
  instead." She adjusted her head and began to read in slow, clear
  accents:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Where shall we discover the path of the Statesman?" asked
  the Stranger in the 'Politicus,' and the question has often returned to pull
  up the hasty politician. We hear much about administrative reform, the
  clearing out of this office or that, but our political charwomen give us no
  clue to the constructive principles of statecraft. We see both our
  traditional parties seeking the will-o'-the-wisp of the moment, making their
  bow to the Dagon of to-day and the Baal of to-morrow, till it is hard for the
  unprejudiced spectator to detect wherein lies the difference in the articles
  of their faith. Yet the difference exists, we are told by Liberal writers.
  The Liberal party is conspicuously the possessor of a creed, of principles;
  if they accept a new doctrine it is because in some occult way it is part of
  their historic policy, and if they reject it the reason is the same. They are
  the party of a continuous intellectual development, while Conservatives are
  hand-to-mouth office-seekers, attendant upon the movements of the traditional
  cat.</p>

  <p class="quote">"It is this current and facile view of Conservatism which I
  wish to combat. The old creed of the party is by universal consent no longer
  binding. The Tory country gentleman who believed as his fathers taught him
  and held all reform the invention of the devil is an extinct being, though he
  may maintain a shadowy subjective existence in the minds of a few Liberal
  journalists. But if this belief be gone, have we anything to take its place?
  Are our principles invented in the morning and discarded at the going down of
  the sun? Are our tenets bound up with no rational philosophy of human
  society, but merely the hasty maxims of clever adventurers? Mr Morley, in his
  book 'On Compromise,' has granted us some shadow of a creed, but our
  gratitude is moderated by the fact that it is not the creed of modern
  Conservatism. Those principles to which he bids us be true, if we would call
  ourselves honest men and women, are so archaic, so tenderly romantic, that
  not even Disraeli in his youth could have wholly accepted them. But unless we
  are to court the charge of frivolity, it is necessary to provide some theory
  of Conservative statesmanship and the Conservative attitude. On us lies the
  burden of definition. The fact of the Conservative temper in the nation is
  beyond cavil: it is for its upholders to show that it is not unreasonable. If
  we shrink from a noisy confession of faith, there is all the more need for a
  recognition of the meaning of our attitude. We decline to dogmatise about
  politics, but we are compelled to dogmatise about our attitude towards them.
  We must define our critical standpoint, though we hazard no further
  definitions, lest we fall into the old silliness and erect in our
  market-places altars to an Unknown God.</p>

  <p class="quote">"My first remark concerns the vexed question of the relation
  of ethics and politics. Liberalism may be said to have devoted itself to the
  special cult of the political moralist. Now, to my mind, there is a vast
  distinction between conscience and conscientiousness, and that distinction is
  based upon the calibre of the accompanying intellect. If a man appeals to his
  conscience, I am entitled to inquire if it be the conscience of a man or the
  conscientiousness of a fool. Moral earnestness, if accompanied by
  intelligence, is worthy of all respect; but, if not so attended, it is merely
  a pathological state, like hysteria or delirium. I find, however, that the
  moralist in politics is apt to put a value upon conscience in itself. He
  pleads for a kind of finesse in ethics, a terrible finicking consistency, an
  abstract devotion to a very abstract creed. He refuses to allow the
  conscience to be ruled and directed by the mind: intellectual considerations,
  he says in effect, have no relevance in this sphere. We maintain, on the
  other hand, that the primary condition of statesmanship is what Hilda Wangel
  calls a 'robust conscience.' By this I do not mean an obtuse mind, and still
  less a dishonest one. I mean the temper which allows the sense of right and
  the practical intelligence to go hand in hand, never subserving the former to
  the latter, but interpreting the one by the other. It is the temper which
  looks at the essentials of virtue and not at its trappings. 'No great
  country,' Horace Walpole wrote, 'was ever saved by its good men, because good
  men will not go the lengths that are necessary.'</p>

  <p class="quote">"Now mark what the word 'good' means. This is no plea for
  the unscrupulous man who sinks morality in statecraft. But it is a plea for
  the statesman who can sink himself in his people, who is less concerned with
  trying to save his soul than with trying to save his country, who can look at
  the great issues of life with eyes undimmed by any metaphysic of morality. It
  is a protest against the saint in politics, that worthy, hypercritical, and
  useless type of mind which is incapable of single-hearted action. <i>'La
  petite morale,'</i> in Mirabeau's words, <i>'est l'ennemi de la grande.'</i>
  When the Emperor Charles the Fifth, as we are told on good authority,
  appeared before the Throne of God, the Devil's Advocate had a long list of
  burnings, sackings, and slaughterings to bring against him. But his Guardian
  Angel argued thus: 'This man has lived a hard life among men, and not in the
  cloister or in the desert. He must be judged by fitting standards, and if on
  the whole he followed righteousness we must forget his stumblings.' And
  history adds that this view was accepted and Charles permitted to enter
  Paradise.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The first point, then, in the Conservative attitude is that
  it insists upon a robust and practical mind. The second is that such a mind
  must think and feel in accord with the traditions of the national character.
  In this character there are certain clearly defined features. It is a temper
  naturally conservative, prone to keep up the form of things, though the
  spirit has gone, till they crumble to pieces from sheer age; slow to think;
  distrustful of novelties; intolerant of brilliance&mdash;the temper which in
  the individual spells mediocrity, but in the mass a kind of greatness.
  Against this great rock of English conservatism the spirits of a Bacon, a
  Cromwell, a Bolingbroke, a Canning, a Disraeli, like so many ineffectual
  angels, have beaten their wings in vain. But the majority of them, being wise
  in their generation, recognised their barriers and turned their prison-house
  into a wall of defence. It is not like the conservatism of the Liberal, an
  absorption in a barren dogma; it is the conservatism of a national
  temperament, and therefore upon it true statesmanship must build as upon its
  foundation. Ultimately, as most political thinkers have urged, the people in
  a blind, dumb way work out their own ideas, and these ideas are always right.
  There is a cant maxim among Liberal politicians that the statesman is the
  servant of democracy. So be it. But let a statesman serve the people by
  penetrating to their real interests and their real desires, and not by
  obeying any casual knot of agitators who clamour that their unintelligible
  patois is the voice of God.</p>

  <p class="quote">"The third item in our definition is that Conservative
  statesmanship must be positive. When the great wave of reaction produced by
  the French Revolution had subsided, the era of Industrialism set in. New
  inventions lessened the cost of production. Manufacturers and mine-owners saw
  wealth, colossal wealth, in the near future. But there was the labouring
  class to be considered, a class to some extent tainted with the French
  restlessness, demanding better pay, shorter hours, happier conditions of
  life. It was a unique chance for a constructive statesman, but Canning died
  and the Manchester school succeeded. With a creed made up of a few tags from
  dissenting ethics and a few dubious economic maxims, this school was in the
  main composed of capitalists and employers of labour. To secure a free
  development for the new industrialism was their aim, but in the meantime sops
  must be thrown to the Cerberus of the proletariat. So they passed the Reform
  Bill of 1832, that harmless excursion in academic reform, and they repealed
  the Corn Laws, which put money in their pockets, silenced for a moment the
  cries of labour, and effectually ruined agricultural England. Against
  Chartism, which was a crude but genuine scheme of reform, they fought with
  tooth and nail! Reform for reform's sake, provided it be not radical, change
  for change's sake, provided it be unnecessary&mdash;such has been the lofty
  tradition of this vicious and destructive theorising. And thus the so-called
  Radicalism has advanced, professing a high ethical purpose, pandering to
  every fad of every clique of agitators, taking in vain the sacred name of
  Progress. And Conservatism? It, too, has forgotten at times that doctrine of
  positiveness which Canning taught, but throughout its moments of error and
  forgetfulness it has never quite lost sight of its ideal. As the party which
  professes no abstract creed, but bases its duty upon a knowledge of national
  character and a conception of practical good, it has maintained that reform
  when it comes must be real, and that a trifling with change for its own sake
  is the last and fatalest heresy.</p>

  <p class="quote">"In 'positiveness' then the true <i>raison d'être</i> of
  Conservatism is to be found. But, indeed, I object to the word Conservative.
  I should prefer to call myself a Tory. The former word implies that the
  centre of gravity lies in a dull conserving of institutions and creeds which
  may have outgrown their usefulness. 'Tory,' I am told, meant in the beginning
  an Irish robber, and the attitude of the Irish robber in life seems to me
  preferable to that of the hide-bound formalist who worships a Church and
  State which are no more than names to him. Toryism is not the path of least
  resistance, but a living and militant creed, offering tangible results and
  based upon the vital needs of the nation. I have read many 'Pleas for
  Unprincipled Toryism,' which were attempts to defend our supposed lack of a
  theoretical basis. But we have no need of such a defence. We have our basis,
  we have our principles, and they are none the less principles because we are
  not so arrogant as to confuse them with the laws of Sinai.</p>

  <p class="quote">"One word in conclusion. It seems to me that there is
  another duty incumbent upon the Tory party, which is perhaps of all its tasks
  the most arduous and the most vital. In our modern world we have Been
  inaugurated the reign of a dull bourgeois rationalism, which finds some
  inadequate reason for all things in heaven and earth and makes a god of its
  own infallibility. Old simple faiths have been discredited, a spirit of minor
  criticism has gone abroad, and the beliefs of centuries are now in a state of
  solution. It is not a promising mood. 'Provincial arrogance and precipitate
  self-complacency' are not the stuff of which a strong nation is made.
  National prejudices, deep inborn convictions for which no copy-book
  justifications can be found, are after all the conquering forces of the
  world. The French Revolution destroyed the cult of Church and King; but it
  inspired an equally blind and passionate worship of certain civic ideals, and
  with these in their soul the raw levies of France conquered Europe. To the
  Tory the instincts of the people must always seem truer in the long-run than
  the little-reasoned disquisitions of a few professors. To the Liberal this is
  heresy; he demands a creed which shall approve itself to his superb
  intellect, for Liberalism is essentially the faith of the intellectual.
  Against such an attitude it is the duty and the highest privilege of Tory
  statesmanship to wage implacable war. It may take many forms&mdash;attacks
  upon institutions which still fulfil their purpose though in a narrow way
  their basis may seem irrational, dogmas in economics and theories of reform
  which have only a speculative validity, a system of ethics made in the study
  or the lecture-room. I know of few finer words in literature than those in
  which Burke swept away the sophistries which sought to abolish patriotism and
  defend certain vague cosmopolitan rights of man, or those in which Disraeli
  in the theatre at Oxford in '64 scourged the money-changers of popular
  science. And so in our analysis of Conservatism we come back to something
  which is not unlike the beliefs of our grandfathers. Conservatism in their
  view was sworn to defend Church and Throne, in our view it is sworn to defend
  the things which lie at the back of Church and Throne, the instincts of a
  people, the character of a nation. It is conservative, this attitude, but it
  is also reforming. A people develops unconsciously, and this development is
  on far other lines than the progress of Liberal illuminati. It is its duty to
  foster this popular development as against the vagaries of a clique or a
  caucus. It is its duty to conserve, while there is reason, and to destroy
  ruthlessly and finally when the justification has passed. And it has a right
  to this attitude, for it bases its conduct upon the 'instant need of things'
  and upon no <i>a priori</i> creed. Its opponents, fixing their eyes upon
  falling stars, have no leisure to study the ground they walk on. Mistaking
  their own clientele for the nation and themselves for Omnipotence, they
  wander like children in the dark, and instead of the narrow path to the
  Celestial City follow the primrose path to that sinister personage who, as a
  great authority has told us, was the first Whig."</p><br>

  <p>Lady Amysfort's cool accents had scarcely ceased before Mr Wakefield, who
  had listened with some attention, said loudly, "My dear lady, there is a
  great deal of sound sense in that and a great deal of nonsense. I detest your
  obscurantism, but on the main point I entirely agree with you. We must be
  positive and practical in our work, and the metaphysician is every bit as bad
  as the Liberal doctrinaire."</p>

  <p>The Duchess had had her temper considerably ruffled by the matter, and
  still more by the manner of Lady Amysfort's discourse. She had an intense
  dislike of the Primrose League, and a suspicion of Disraeli, who had once
  said of her husband that his air suggested an "inspired rabbit." Looking
  round the circle she saw no one disposed to take up the cudgels for her
  much-abused party, and Lady Amysfort's attitude, as, slim and exquisite, she
  leaned over a lamp to light a cigarette, annoyed her by its suggestion of the
  supercilious. She therefore fixed her opponent with an austere eye, and
  advanced to the attack.</p>

  <p>"There is much that I could say, Caroline," she began, "but I will confine
  myself to one point which is common to you and the writer of Bob's second
  extract. You both maintain that we Liberals are hag-ridden by formulas, and
  declare that the Conservatives are the only people who can look squarely at
  facts. To begin with, I think that you very much overstate your case. Heaven
  is my witness that I do not love the style of the Radical press. I detest its
  loudmouthed generalities, and I think the way it drags the most sacred words
  of Scripture into its arguments simply blasphemous. It resorts so
  consistently to immense appeals on trivial occasions, that when the great
  occasion arises it has nothing further to say. But in spite of all this folly
  you cannot maintain that you can do without dogma altogether, or that the
  dogmatism of the two factions differs otherwise than in degree. Take again
  this question of facing facts. I think the Liberal point is a perfectly good
  one. Things have gone hideously wrong under a Conservative Government, simply
  because it did not look at facts. We may choose&mdash;foolishly, I
  think&mdash;to cloak our return to common-sense in Nonconformist language,
  but what we really mean is that our opponents did not understand their data,
  and we are going to try to understand them. We are not really quarrelling
  about principles but about facts, and it is only a bad debating trick to
  pretend otherwise. I do not say that we shall read the facts correctly, any
  more than you did, but our sole justification is that we intend to try. When
  you maintain that the Conservatives look at facts, and the Liberal clings to
  principles, all you mean is that the different sides have different arts for
  capturing the popular fancy. We are apt to claim a monopoly of the purer
  virtues, you of practical common-sense; but we both aim at common-sense,
  though my side invests it with the glamour of high principles, yours with the
  charm of an historic past. I honestly think that is the fairest way to look
  at our political records. I quite agree with you that the difference at
  bottom is one of temperament. I have heard Bob's voice shake with emotion
  when he spoke of Chatham, and I have seen tears in Mr Calderwood's eyes when
  he spoke of Eternal Justice. I will confess that I would rather have
  politicians pat a little history book familiarly than the New Testament, but
  both are legitimate forms of appeal. Our faiths spring from the same source.
  You think us foolish; we think you stupid; while the truth is that we are
  both rather foolish, rather stupid, and in the last resort rather wise."</p>

  <p>The Duchess's remarks met with the strong approbation of Lord Launceston,
  who had been crossing and uncrossing his long legs nervously while Lady
  Amysfort read.</p>

  <p>"I think what you say is most true," he said. "All parties have a common
  basis now. They preach the same faith though in different accents. And all
  parties tend simply to shuffle the old cards at any crisis, instead of making
  a new analysis of the facts. It is the business of clear-eyed people to
  prevent this natural inclination. Our common basis I should call
  democracy&mdash;English democracy, that is, with all its historical and
  racial colouring. It is not a dogma, but a fact, or rather the recognition of
  a fact&mdash;that under modern conditions Everyman governs. Now democracy is
  the great destroyer of shams. It clears out the rubbish and leaves the truth
  tolerably plain to the single-minded inquirer. Besides, it opens up the way
  for superiority. I do not say that it means always an enlightened rule, but
  it gives scope at any rate for the true enlightener when he arrives. It is
  the best, indeed the only, basis for building anew on. And here, curiously
  enough, it reaches the same result as Toryism. It used to be the old boast of
  the Tory party that it was loyal, and would always render faithful service to
  any leader who could capture it. The Liberal party, it was said, was too
  individualistic, too split up by the differences which come from honest but
  incomplete thinking independently, ever to make a good following. Democracy
  does the work of Toryism on a wider basis. The people have no intellectual
  arrogance. They think slowly, not very clearly, and always on broad and
  simple lines, but when they once grasp a conception they are invincible."</p>

  <p>"We are agreed, then, on one important point," Carey took up the
  conversation. "Both of our great parties purport to look at facts, but both
  tend to get into conventional grooves and neglect their duty. However, in the
  democracy which lies behind them both, there is a permanent instinct under
  proper guidance to revise the data of policy. And here I may anticipate what
  I think Lord Appin intends to say. The new Labour party, which claims to be
  specially in touch with democracy, urges as its chief <i>raison d'être</i>
  the duty of revision. We may differ from them on what constitutes the data,
  we may differ still more profoundly on the interpretation, but our general
  attitude is exactly theirs."</p>

  <p>"I have always maintained," said Lord Appin, "that they were our natural
  allies. I opened a review the other day and found an article on their
  programme by one of their leaders. He advocated a mission of labour delegates
  to the Colonies in order to confer with the Labour parties there and arrange
  a common programme. I confess that the proposal, crude as it was, cheered me
  greatly, as showing some kind of sense of imperial solidarity."</p>

  <p>"So, if the hooligans of Mile End sent a deputation to consult with the
  larrikins of Sydney and the toughs of Montreal, you would call that an effort
  in the cause of imperial unity?"</p>

  <p>Mr Wakefield spoke with an asperity which for the moment left the company
  silent. The tension was relieved by Lady Flora, who, with an innocence not
  destitute of tact, inquired if a larrikin was the same as a bush parrot,
  since a pair had just been sent her. Upon which, with a paternal gravity and
  some humour, Mr Wakefield proceeded to explain to her in an undertone the
  exact distinction.</p>

  <p>"My point is very simple," Lord Appin continued. "Even a class policy,
  which recognises that success can only be won on the stage of the whole
  Empire, has a certain statesmanship in it. For it recognises one cardinal
  truth, the enlarged basis of our problems."</p>

  <p>"Now, Hugh," said Carey, "you shall have that definition of Imperialism
  for which your soul yearns. It is simply looking at all the facts instead of
  at only a few of them. We begin by realising that we are not an island but an
  empire, and therefore, in considering any great question, we take the whole
  data into account. Imperialism, if we regard it properly, is not a creed or a
  principle, but an attitude of mind."</p>

  <p>Lady Flora caught the last words in the midst of her lecture on bush
  parrots. "That is exactly what Cousin Charlie said when Uncle George found
  him at Monte Carlo when he should have been at his Embassy. Uncle George said
  it was a disgrace that he should be seen in such a place, and Charlie said it
  wasn't a place but an attitude of mind."</p>

  <p>"We are all Imperialists at heart nowadays," Carey went on, "except Lady
  Flora, who is a wicked girl. Every party is more or less resigned to the fact
  of empire. Some kick a little against the pricks, some are half-hearted,
  others burn with zeal; but all have the same conviction that it is
  inevitable. We have not begun yet to work out the details seriously, but we
  have won the first position. And that is as it should be. The Empire must be
  accepted, like the Monarchy, as a presupposition in politics which is beyond
  question. Any inclination to use it for party ends should be as jealously
  condemned as the occasional attempts to drag the King's name into current
  controversies or to assume that patriotism is the monopoly of one side. We
  shall, of course, always differ on particular questions, but there should be
  no difference on the ideal. Indeed, I honestly think that there is little
  among ordinary sane-minded people. The average man may be described as a
  confused Imperialist. He wants to make the best of the heritage bequeathed to
  him; his imagination fires at its possibilities; but he is still very
  ignorant and shy, and he has no idea how to set about the work. The first of
  imperial duties is to instruct him."</p>

  <p>"And yet," said Mr Astbury, "I find many people openly contemptuous of the
  ideal. I daresay this contempt is due to imperfect understanding, but we have
  to face the fact that many are not only apathetic about the things we care
  most for, but actively hostile."</p>

  <p>Lord Appin reopened his scrap-book. "True enough. We have some honest
  opponents, and a few indifferently so, and I have been at the pains to
  collect their opinions. I think I can distinguish several types. There is,
  first of all, Mr Luke Simeon, who surrendered his fellowship at King's to
  'labour,' as he says, among the masses. He is eminent at Browning halls and
  university settlements, and has done much, I believe, to civilise the East
  End by the distribution of indistinct reproductions of Giotto and Botticelli.
  He is a pale, earnest, well-meaning, and rather silly young man, who should
  have remained in the church of his clerical forefathers. He attacks
  Imperialism as the 'worship of force.' It represents, he says, that tendency
  of a decadent age which may be observed in the Roman ladies who took their
  lovers from the prize-ring. Up to a point I agree with him. The worship of
  brute force, of mere conscienceless power, is the most certain sign of
  degeneration. His fallacy is that he really condemns force altogether,
  whether exercised for a beneficent purpose or not, and he hides his bias
  under the assumption that Imperialism means power without ideals or
  conscience. He has a temperamental shrinking from certain of the hard
  realities of life, and he flatters his weakness by investing it with a moral
  halo. He lives in a little world of artistic and literary trifling, and he
  has consequently no perspective, so that he will quote you a bad artist on
  some point of foreign policy and a minor poet on some problem of economics.
  His shallow aesthetic soul is revolted by three-fourths of life, so he dubs
  it evil and rejects it. He is not a young man whom it is worth taking pains
  to convert, but his stuff has its vogue, and he has disciples. We have but to
  expound the moral purpose in our creed to take the logical ground from
  beneath his feet, for, though he desires it in his heart, he is not prepared
  for an absolute condemnation of power. Then we have our Benthamite friend, Mr
  Wrigley of Manchester, who is one of the few remaining exponents of the old
  Radicalism of the 'forties. War is his special dislike, and commerce his
  idol. He is averse to empire partly because his mind is full of Rome and
  Carthage and he has not the imagination to conceive a new model, partly
  because it gives scope for energies which are only by accident utilitarian.
  His ideal State would be a community of Samuel Budgetts and Worldly Wisemans.
  The answer to him and his kind is that their doctrine is built on a false
  conception of human nature, and that in tranquillising life they would denude
  it of all that makes it worth having.</p>

  <p class="verse">'Summum crede nefas animam praeferre pudori,<br>
  Et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas.'*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Juvenal</i>, viii. S3: "Count it the last disgrace
  to prefer life to honour, and for living's sake to destroy all that makes
  life worthy."</p><br>

  <p class="first">For good or for ill humanity has long since decided against
  him. Next, there is the school of which we may take Mr Chatterton as a
  representative. In theory they are full-blooded and masculine enough, though
  their heroics smack of Peckham. They love to rhapsodise about 'Old England'
  and the Elizabethans, and beer and cricket, and heaven knows what. Their
  complaint is that a spacial extension means a weakening in intensity of the
  national life, and they also will throw Rome and Athens at your head. They
  are all for the virility of England, they say, as against the neurotic
  restlessness of the Imperialist. With them, again, I have a certain sympathy,
  though the taunt of 'neurotic' comes ill from gentlemen whose style is so
  explosive and delirious. The answer to their arguments depends upon the
  question of the value of space and of the whole material basis in any
  spiritual development, and in deference to Mr Wakefield we will leave that
  over till a later day. Lastly comes an honest fellow for whom I have a great
  regard. You all know Ambrose by name. He lives on twopence a-day and slaves
  at his philanthropy. He objects to empire because imperial questions distract
  the attention of the nation from urgent matters of home reform. And he is
  perfectly right. As long as we make 'national' and 'imperial' water-tight
  compartments, there must be this jealousy. What we have to show him is that
  the whole is one great problem, and that his own interests cannot be realised
  save by the help of the other interests which he despises. And then he will
  be on our side, for at heart he is one of us."</p>

  <p>"You have omitted," said Mrs Wilbraham, "the greatest source of
  opposition&mdash;the folly of some of our own people. Why is it that many of
  us&mdash;myself for one&mdash;grow nervous when the word 'Empire' is
  mentioned, and get hot all over? Human nature is so hopelessly silly. A dear
  creature, whom most of us know, started a league last year to ensure that
  women throughout the Empire should be reading Shakespeare at the same time
  every evening. 'How sweet,' she said, 'to think that every night at half-past
  nine the whole English-speaking world would be repeating immortal words,' and
  she was very angry with me for saying that the English-speaking world would
  be much better employed dining. And then, what is to be said about our
  poetry? I had a collection of imperial songs from the works of popular poets
  sent me this summer. One had the chorus, <i>'We can all do our little bit for
  England.'</i> Another was an invocation to empire&mdash;<i>'Empire, the very
  thought of thee!'</i> And, worst of all, there is Sir Herbert Jupp. You know
  how ambitious he is to be a great orator, so he has had many elocution
  lessons, and he speaks whenever he is invited. It is the most dreadful stuff,
  and he winds up always with a tag from some bad poet, which is enough to make
  one cry. One could believe that he was hired by our opponents to make our
  case ridiculous. I almost think that, more than any other party, we suffer
  from a defective sense of humour."</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut," said Mr Wakefield, heaving himself from his chair and
  straddling into the firelight. "It will never do to be hypercritical. It is
  only a dying cause which can attain to perfect taste. A living creed is sure
  to have its extravagances and its crudities, but it can afford to be absurd.
  After all, we must have our subalterns as well as our marshals, our
  Garibaldis as well as our Cavours and Mazzinis. The more silliness in
  Imperialism the better, say I! It shows that it is getting on terms with
  human nature, which is deplorably silly. Of course our poetry is bad, of
  course our rhetoric is tawdry, of course we show no sense of the ridiculous!
  And the reason is simply that we are in earnest. If we once become
  self-conscious, then we may as well shut up shop and pull down the sign....

  <p class="first">HUGH had found a comfortable chair in the lee of an acacia
  thicket, whence he looked over a stretch of low bracken to the lawn which
  swept from the house along the edge of the escarpment to the home woods. The
  sunshine lay warm around him, but the clear air had none of the sultriness of
  noon. Rather it burned like some dry ether, with an aromatic freshness in its
  heat. In accordance with his good resolutions he was renewing his
  acquaintance with the classics, and was reading aloud to himself the
  exquisite cadences of Theocritus's Seventh Idyll.</p>

  <p>"I am the foul fiend, Flibbertigibbet!" said a voice at his elbow, and
  Lady Flora, with an armful of books, sank upon the mossy turf beside him.
  "No! Stay where you are. I want to sit here. Poor Mr Somerville, I've come to
  disturb you again. But it is our compact, you know. What have you been
  reading?"</p>

  <p>"Greek," said Hugh, holding out his book.</p>

  <p>"Poetry! Well, so have I&mdash;all the morning. We played such a good
  game, which Charlotte Wilbraham invented&mdash;making comic imperial poetry.
  It is quite easy. You simply get all the names of places you can think of and
  string them together, and then put at the end something about the Flag or the
  Crown or the Old Land. Mr Wakefield was rather cross at first, but he was
  soon pacified, and he played very well. I thought the first night he was a
  dreadful old thing, but he is really very kind, and quite amusing."</p>

  <p>"I want to hear your poem," said Hugh.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I couldn't write any&mdash;at least nothing fit to read aloud. I'm
  too stupid for clever games. But I carried off Marjory's, in spite of her
  protests." The girl took a paper from between the leaves of a book and read
  the following verses:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p>"'Rests not the wild-deer in the park,<br>
  The wild-fowl in the pen,<br>
  Nor nests the heaven-aspiring lark<br>
  Where throng the prints of men.<br>
  He who the King's Path once hath trod<br>
  Stays not in slumbrous isle,<br>
  But seeks, where blow the winds of God,<br>
  His lordly domicile.<br>
  <br>
  Where 'neath the red-rimmed Arctic sun<br>
  The ice-bound whaler frets,<br>
  Where in the morn the salmon run<br>
  Far-shining to the nets;<br>
  Where young republics pitch their tents<br>
  Beside the Western wave,<br>
  And set their transient Presidents<br>
  As targets for the brave;<br>
  <br>
  Where through th' illimitable plains<br>
  Nigerian currents flow,<br>
  And many a wily savage brains<br>
  His unsuspecting foe;<br>
  Where gleam the lights of shrine and joss,<br>
  From some far isle of blue,<br>
  Where screams beneath the Southern Cross<br>
  The lonely cockatoo;<br></p>

  <p class="first">(The last word may be 'caribou.' Marjory wasn't sure whether
  a caribou or a cockatoo was likely to scream most.)</p>

  <p class="verse">Where in the starlit Eastern night<br>
  The dusky dervish sleeps,<br>
  Where the lone lama waits the light<br>
  On Kangchenjunga's steeps;<br>
  Where Indian rajahs quaff their pegs<br>
  And chase the listless flies,<br>
  Where mazed amid a pile of kegs<br>
  Th' inebriate trader lies;<br>
  <br>
  There, o'er the broad and goodly earth,<br>
  Go seek th' imperial soul.<br>
  Broken the barriers of his birth,<br>
  Th' eternal heavens his goal.<br>
  In wind or wet, in drink or debt,<br>
  Steeled heart no fate can stir,<br>
  He is the Render of the Net,<br>
  Th' Immortal Wanderer.'"</p><br>

  <p>"It is long," said Lady Flora, when she had finished, "but, like the White
  Knight's poem, it is very, very beautiful. Charlotte said it had the true
  ring of colonial poetry. Do you know, Mr Somerville, of all the discussion
  last night I scarcely remember anything except that Imperialism has nothing
  to do with being a Liberal or a Conservative, and that it means we must begin
  all over again. Also I remember that it is not a creed, but an attitude of
  mind. I thought a good deal about that when I was having my hair brushed this
  morning. Somebody once told me that according to philosophers everything is
  only an attitude of mind&mdash;you and I and the sun and Musuru and the
  butterfly over there. Is that true?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Hugh. "We are all creatures of the Red King's dream, but
  till he wakens up we pretend we are real."</p>

  <p>"I wish," said the girl pensively,&mdash;"I wish I could believe that Aunt
  Susan was only an attitude of mind. She has arranged a picnic for this
  afternoon, and I did so want to go for a gallop over the moor we passed
  through the first day. Don't you think, Mr Somerville, we could slip away by
  ourselves? You've been here before and know the country, so we shouldn't lose
  our way. I've been round the stables, and there is a little white Arab I have
  set my heart on."</p>

  <p>It was impossible to refuse a request that so chimed with his own wishes,
  and Hugh readily consented. At luncheon their path was made easy, for the
  Duchess had a headache and did not appear. Accordingly about three o'clock
  they found themselves cantering up a grassy ride among the woods, scaring the
  small buck and the bush pheasants, the white Arab bucking furiously, and
  Hugh's sedate Africander pony shying at every rustle in the trees.</p>

  <p>At the end of the wood a great swell of downland lay before them. They
  gave the ponies their heads against the slope, and settled down for a long
  gallop. Soon the heat of the day had gone. A wind of their own creation sang
  in their ears, the scents of the moor, distilled by suns and dews, rose in
  waves to greet them, the horizon disappeared, and they saw only the misty
  fleeting of the ground beneath them. The ponies knew their country and never
  stumbled. Jumping little streams, plunging through tufts of fern, and
  scrambling cat-like among broken rocks, they never lost the same easy
  delicate motion. It was pure ecstasy, the very essence of physical
  well-being, and when after some two miles they stopped with lathered mounts
  and scarlet faces on the top of a long ridge of hill, they looked into each
  other's eyes in frank and cheerful comradeship.</p>

  <p>Hugh jumped from the saddle and helped Lady Flora to dismount. "Let us sit
  down," he said, "and look at the view. We are on the backbone of the plateau.
  Musuru is 200 feet below us; and look! there is the lake quite clear."</p>

  <p>He pointed where far to the west and deep down in the great trough shone a
  gleam of water.</p>

  <p>The girl, still panting, looked where she was bidden and then closed her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"It is pure paradise," she said. "What have we done to deserve it? I have
  to pinch myself to remember we are not galloping on some Sussex down. What
  lies to the north?"</p>

  <p>"Some hundreds of miles of unknown bush and then the foothills of
  Abyssinia."</p>

  <p>"East I know. West there are the great lakes and the Mountains of the Moon
  and the Congo forest, I suppose. And south?"</p>

  <p>"The plateau runs down for some hundreds of miles to German territory, and
  then you get into Nyasaland and the Shire Highlands, and in the end you come
  to the Zambesi."</p>

  <p>"My imagination faints. Please, don't tell me any more. And we are here as
  pioneers, except for the Musuru colony. Savagery is on every side, and yet in
  half an hour's ride I can get back to my maid and a French chef and the
  latest English novel. It is too much, Mr Somerville; I am not worthy of it
  all."</p>

  <p>They were sitting near the edge of one of the native tracks which
  intersect the moor. As Lady Flora spoke a party of natives on trek came
  along, blankets on shoulder, the men carrying spears and shields, and the
  women with babies slung on their backs. They saluted by raising their hands
  high above their heads, and Hugh acknowledged the greeting.</p>

  <p>"They look like some of the northern tribes who have been down at the
  railway selling cattle. Their home is probably near Rudolf. There, if you
  like, is the romance of Empire. Here is a young lady in a blue habit riding
  after luncheon and exchanging courtesies with aborigines from the heart of
  Africa."</p>

  <p>The girl rose to her feet and disentangled her reins. "Let us go on,
  please," she said. "I feel so full of life and adventure that I cannot sit
  still. Where shall we go? Let us visit Prester John and demand tea. I'm sure
  Melissinde must be charming, and I'm dying to make her acquaintance. Or shall
  we try Soria Moria Castle in the Mountains of the Moon? Nothing is impossible
  this afternoon. The names of the places are like tunes&mdash;Musuru,
  Ruwenzori!"</p>

  <p>"What about the imperial poetry you parodied this morning?"</p>

  <p>"I recant, please, at once and for ever. The worst geographical verses are
  full of poetry, and I shall spend the rest of my life writing them. The
  ponies are rested, and we can have another gallop along the ridge."</p>

  <p>A couple of miles off was a small kopje crowned with a few trees. To this
  they raced, and the girl was an easy victor. For, coming suddenly upon a
  narrow rocky watercourse, she took it flying, while Hugh's more sober pony
  insisted on scrambling down and up the banks. At the kopje the plateau was
  cut into by a long glen running up from the west, and they looked down from
  their eminence on steep bush-clad sides ending below in a dark evergreen
  forest. A soft purple haze hung over the depths, and from far down came the
  music of a waterfall.</p>

  <p>For a little Lady Flora was silent with delight. She made a charming
  picture as she reined up her Arab on the edge of the slope, the sunlight in
  her hair, while with one hand she shaded her eyes and looked out to the
  horizon.</p>

  <p>"I never realised before what space meant. Of course I have been up
  mountains, and I once camped in the desert for a week, and I've been several
  times on the high seas, but I seemed always to carry my own atmosphere with
  me. But here everything indoors and commonplace and conventional is a million
  miles behind. I suppose I am the first woman who has ever been here, and I
  feel as if the place had been created for me and had been waiting for me
  since the beginning of time. What an egoist I am!"</p>

  <p>On these uplands in mid-winter the dark comes swiftly, and already the sun
  was going down behind the far hills in a riot of crimson and amethyst. The
  heat had gone, and a chilly freshness was creeping into the air.</p>

  <p>"We must be making for home," said Hugh. "Let us canter back gently, for
  an East African twilight is not a thing to hurry through. So you are getting
  the sense of space into your blood! Well, that is Imperialism, you know, or
  at least the foundations of it. We all get stuffy sitting tight in our old
  creeds. We live, most of us, in gardens which are very pleasant and
  well-watered, but sleepy and not overwholesome. And we grow old and stale
  before our time&mdash;the old age of decay, not the honest old age of being
  worn down with the friction of life."</p>

  <p>"But how hard it is for a woman to avoid it! Men have such a wide world
  compared with ours. Our business is only to adapt ourselves to things as they
  are. Men can mould them as they please, and if they find the shades of the
  prison-house closing on them, they can put their packs on their shoulders and
  shake the dust of civilisation off their feet. How I envy you all!"</p>

  <p>"That is one way, but not the best way. A man can always run off, but the
  best of them won't. Their business is to try and shape things according to a
  better plan. Our lives are like a lot of separate circles scattered about in
  space. Sometimes they are cut by others and then we have friends, and talk of
  this man or woman 'coming into our lives.' I have heard you use that phrase
  at least a dozen times since I came here. Now and then one circle largely
  overlaps another, and then people are in love. Once in a blue moon, perhaps,
  two circles almost coincide. And then you have what is commonly known as a
  happy marriage. But the circles always remain the same size, so for restless
  souls love and marriage and even friendship are no solution, as you very
  wisely observed yesterday. And it is no remedy to remove the circle from
  London to Polynesia or the Klondyke, for you do not make it any bigger by
  changing its site. The only thing to do is to draw a larger circle with a
  wider radius. Only," said Hugh sadly, "those who do that often fail to
  complete it, and leave only a broken arc to show how vast their design
  was."</p>

  <p>"I like that metaphor," said the girl musingly. "Of course it is quite
  true that you do not get any nearer satisfaction by shifting your dwelling.
  But how hard it is for <i>us</i> to stretch the compasses and describe a
  wider circle."</p>

  <p>"It is getting easier every day. Our great-aunts had a code of rules laid
  down for them which nothing could break through. They left the schoolroom for
  a year or two of sentiment and gaiety, and then married and became good
  housewives; or perhaps they didn't, and steered a precarious course on the
  high seas of scandal. Our grandfathers thought that the only choice lay
  between Amelia Sedley and Becky Sharp. They had not discovered Diana
  Warwick."</p>

  <p>The sun had gone down, and a soft mulberry afterglow filled the western
  heavens. The ponies stepped sedately over the rough veld, till the woods rose
  black in the twilight, and they entered the long ride which led to the
  house.</p>

  <p>"I think," said Lady Flora, "that our circles are being widened for us. I
  know that in the last three days mine has expanded so far that London is only
  a little patch in a corner. I suppose you would say that we women are
  citizens now and not shepherdesses in porcelain."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is a part of the truth. I was in Paris at Whitsuntide, and went
  to see Père Antoine. He is very old and blind, but he talks wonderfully, and
  his mind gets clearer with age. He said that the chief fact of the modern
  world is that humanity is drawing closer together. The State is taking the
  place of the old Church, and politics are acquiring a new meaning. Classes
  and ranks are being broken down, and men are beginning to find not only their
  duty but their happiness in community. They feel and think corporately, and
  not as atoms. It is something like this which the whole string of 'isms from
  Comtism to Marxism has been trying to expound. A political creed was once a
  list of dogmas which meant nothing to the ordinary man or woman. Now every
  creed&mdash;ours as well as others&mdash;must spread its roots into all the
  interests and affections and aspirations of our life. Another saying of his
  impressed me a good deal. He declared that the worst modern vice was
  'spirituality,' and that the most crying need was that the world should awake
  to the value of its great temporal heritage&mdash;<i>'nôtre grand heritage
  temporel!'</i> That means much from a man who all his life has preached a
  mystical religion."</p>

  <p>The hall-door appeared before them with a glow of firelight shining into
  the chilly night. A groom led away the ponies, and soon the riders were
  warming cold hands at the hearth.</p>

  <p>Lady Flora called Heaven to witness her enjoyment of the afternoon. "And
  how serious we grew! I suppose it was the twilight, which always makes me sad
  and sentimental. After tea let us go and find Colonel Alastair and Sir
  Edward, and play games on the billiard-table. I think we both want a
  bear-fight to bring us out of the clouds."</p>

  <p>The library at Musuru was a long room, panelled in some dark
  sweet-smelling wood, with the bookcases sunk in the walls. As with Gibbon's
  Emperor Gordian, so with Carey: sixty-two thousand volumes attested the
  variety of his inclinations. It was a working-room, as the maps and papers
  piled on the desks bore witness, and its strenuous air was increased by the
  absence of any ornaments or pictures. But it was also a pleasant place for
  talk, for the shaded light gleamed cheerfully on vellum and morocco, and the
  low chairs round the great fireplace invited to comfort and conversation. The
  Duchess's headache continued, and her niece had gone to sit with her. The
  rest of the party disposed themselves about the hearth in a circle, while
  their host stood as usual planted squarely on the hearthrug.</p>

  <p>"Our conclusion last night," Lord Appin began, "was that Imperialism cut
  across parties and demanded a revision of all traditional dogmas in face of a
  new body of fact. This, of course, does not mean any breach in our historical
  continuity. We have a vast deal to learn from all the traditional creeds;
  only they must be re-thought, as it were, and presented in a new system and a
  new language. This process, we also agreed, involved a change in our attitude
  of mind&mdash;indeed this change, if I remember aright, we defined as the
  essence of Imperialism. Instead of being negative, temporising, and
  unscientific, we must show ourselves positive and constructive. We have now
  to work out some of the details of our creed, so far as they are clear, and
  like philosophers we begin with the widest category. Our host commands us
  to-night to consider the question of the constitutional apparatus, the
  machinery of imperial union."</p>

  <p>Lord Appin, as if aware of the gravity of the undertaking, selected a
  large cigar from his case and carefully lit it.</p>

  <p>"First let us repeat all the platitudes," he continued, "and get done with
  them. The pivot of the Empire is the Crown. In the last resort all our units,
  colonies and dependencies alike, submit to the sovereign executive power. We
  have also, roughly speaking, one law, for though I believe&mdash;Mr Wakefield
  will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that at least five great legal systems
  and many smaller codes exist within the Empire, yet we have one ultimate
  tribunal of appeal, and therefore some continuity of interpretation. As I
  remember once hearing Mr Wakefield say, 'To have the power of construing
  colonial laws and customs is to have the power to guide and restrain, to
  have, in effect, control of development.' Now these two common possessions
  are a stupendous machinery of union, if properly directed. The trouble is the
  modes in which the sovereign authority is exercised. Its functions have been
  in practice delegated to the British Cabinet, and therefore, indirectly, to
  the British Parliament. Now clearly such Cabinet and Parliament must have two
  aspects&mdash;a national one, for the British Isles, and an imperial one, in
  which they control the Empire. But with the grant of self-government to so
  many colonies there can be no direct control, and so the doctrine of
  trusteeship has been brought into being. I think it historically correct, and
  it has the further merit of exactly covering the existing practice. A
  government rules England and the dependencies directly, but as regards the
  autonomous colonies it acts as a trustee for their welfare&mdash;that is to
  say, it provides for their defence, and reserves the right in the last resort
  to veto any of their legislative acts which it thinks dangerous to the Empire
  as a whole. This might be a perfectly satisfactory arrangement if our
  Cabinets or Parliaments were not human, and the magnitude and number of
  imperial questions were not beyond their power. A Parliament confronted with
  a great quantity of local problems can only give a perfunctory attention to
  most imperial matters, and in any case cannot hope to make itself
  sufficiently well informed on them to give its decisions much weight. Hence
  we get dissatisfaction on both sides. A Canadian who attends the debates in
  the House of Commons may wait for days before one imperial consideration
  emerges, and may see the Government which controls his destinies turned out
  of office on some business of English education. And the Englishman may
  justly complain that his own affairs are scamped because the men who were
  elected to look after them have to give their time to some Indian frontier
  question. The Home reformer and the Imperialist alike tend to grumble against
  a doctrine which seems to impose upon certain old-fashioned machinery a task
  too heavy for its performance. Have I stated the difficulty correctly, Mr
  Wakefield?"</p>

  <p>The gentleman appealed to nodded his approval, and Lord Appin
  continued&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We have to try and find some way out of the difficulty. I shall leave
  that to others who have made the subject their own. But I have one word of
  caution to give. Before dinner I looked into Bismarck's Memoirs, and I was
  much struck by certain sayings of his which Busch reports. He had to face the
  problem of finding some constitutional machinery for the new German Empire.
  There were plenty of legalists around him to prepare formally perfect
  schemes. But Bismarck most wisely counselled patience. 'Let us take,' he
  said, 'what we can get, what the States are freely willing to give us. As
  long as we have the impulse to unity in the soul of our people, almost any
  scheme will work. But if we once begin to squabble about details and impose a
  cast-iron constitution no scheme on earth will work. We cannot coerce the
  national life into narrow channels, but if we foster that life it will make
  in time the proper channels for itself!' There, to my mind, spoke the true
  creative statesman."</p>

  <p>Lord Launceston, whom the company seemed to expect to take up the tale,
  straightened himself from the depths of a long chair, where he had been
  studying the fire, and looked deprecatingly towards the last speaker.</p>

  <p>"Are we not rather putting the cart before the horse?" he inquired mildly.
  "Yesterday we agreed upon the meaning of our attitude&mdash;a frank
  recognition of new conditions. But that is merely a formal definition, and we
  want to know the nature of the spiritual change and the new principles which
  are born from it. And now you suddenly ask me to consider a piece of
  practical detail, and minute detail at that&mdash;the kind of constitution we
  propose for our State. Is not that a little premature?"</p>

  <p>"There are two reasons for the arrangement," said Carey. "One is that it
  seems wise to sketch the ground-plan of our new republic tentatively, since
  that is only another way of looking at the data which must be our basis. When
  we see what we have to work with, we can go on to deal with principles. The
  second is that Wakefield is so notoriously intolerant of metaphysics, or
  anything approaching them, that we thought it wise to go gently with him and
  burn a little incense before his shrine in the shape of practical
  details."</p>

  <p>Lord Launceston acquiesced, and continued&mdash;"I have had the ideal of
  federation before me ever since I began to be interested in politics, and I
  suppose I have read of or discussed almost every scheme that has been
  propounded. I own I am not very enthusiastic about any. They all begin with
  what Bismarck reprobated, asking too much. The chief&mdash;the scheme of
  legislative federation&mdash;need not detain us. Its principle is home rule
  for each unit and a central imperial legislature to govern and make laws for
  the Empire. It is an ideal fit enough for a small and compact empire, but to
  one so immense and scattered as ours, it is for the present, at any rate,
  wholly inapplicable. I do not dogmatise on what the future may bring forth.
  Distances have shrunk since our great-grandfathers' time, and we are nearer
  to Toronto and Cape Town than they were to Rome, but the difficulties of
  space and time are as yet insurmountable. I have other objections to
  legislative federation besides its impracticability. I question if it is the
  most suitable ideal for an empire which contains on the one hand
  self-governing colonies, and on the other dependencies where autonomy is
  eternally impossible. The Tropics will always be a bar to a type of union
  which belongs essentially to white men and the Temperate zones. Again, it
  means the creation of a new representative body, and in face of the growing
  impotence of representative assemblies constructed on the old lines, I doubt
  if it would be wise to experiment with another. Besides, in all the units of
  a federation there must be a fairly uniform development. All must have
  attained to a certain height of self-conscious national life, so that they
  can enter the federation on equal terms. But can we maintain that such
  uniformity exists with Britain at one end of the scale and, shall we say,
  South Africa at the other? Lastly, unity must precede union. There must be
  imperial solidarity in fact before it receives formal recognition. The Empire
  is a living growth, and any forms we impose upon it must correspond to its
  living movement; otherwise, instead of chain-mail we shall have a
  strait-waistcoat. Any rigid scheme of federation applied prematurely will
  either be inoperative, and so bring the ideal into discredit, or it will curb
  and choke the life and produce monstrosity instead of growth."</p>

  <p>"For the time being," continued Lord Launceston, "I do not see either the
  feasibility or the merits of federation in the common sense. Our conditions
  are not the conditions on which the ordinary federation is constructed. But,"
  he added cheerfully, "there is no reason why we should not develop a type of
  our own to meet our special requirements. There is no need to cumber
  ourselves with the irrelevant precedents of other empires. Let us make the
  most of the elements of consolidation we possess. Our primary merit is our
  elasticity. Our ideal is that of Virgil:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p>'Non ego, nec Teucris Italos parere jubebo,<br>
  Nec mihi regna peto: paribus se legibus ambae<br>
  Invictae gentes aeterna in foedera mittant.'*</p>

  <p class="footnote">*AEneid, xii. 1S9-191. "I will not bid Italian serve
  Teucrian nor for myself seek I kingdoms. Let the two races, unconquered, and
  with equal rights, join in eternal friendship."</p><br>

  <p>We have our free nations and our protected states, and in them all the one
  bond of union is the ultimate executive power. Any attempt at federation must
  proceed, therefore, on the executive side. The legislative side may be left
  cheerfully to the care of the 'trustee' doctrine, as Lord Appin has called
  it. But since we have services common to the whole Empire, expert knowledge
  is demanded, and we must have some machinery for calling to our assistance
  the practical wisdom of all our component States. We want, that is, a
  Council, and if you must have an epithet, I should prefer Imperial to Federal
  I have considered in my day many proposals for such a Council, and I cannot
  say that I have yet made up my mind on any one of them. That, however, is not
  important. We are not now drafting the Act to establish such a body. If we
  are agreed upon the principle, it does not pass the wit of man to devise the
  details. I have no doubt that Mr Wakefield is ready with some admirable
  device."</p>

  <p>Mr Wakefield was about to speak when he was forestalled by Lord Appin, who
  murmured dreamily&mdash;"What a conception! An Imperial Round Table to which
  colonial statesmen should flit like halcyons over the waters!"</p>

  <p>These words did not please Mr Wakefield. "I fail to see the suggestion of
  comedy," he said warmly.</p>

  <p>"Comedy?" said Lord Appin soothingly. "I should not dare to hint at it.
  But you will have a considerable intellectual admixture. Our own Parliaments
  contain a confusion of types, but we have never before ransacked the globe
  for variety."</p>

  <p>Mr Wakefield was only half appeased, and began in a slightly aggrieved
  voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The chief fact we have to reckon with," he said, "is colonial
  nationalism. All the self-governing colonies look upon themselves as
  nations&mdash;new national types with a specific national future. They began
  life under different conditions from England, and brought to their new lands
  only a light baggage of English traditions. Those new lands are themselves a
  great moulding force as regards national character. The boy who grows up in
  the backwoods and the boy who goes the conventional round of Eton and Oxford
  will become different men, though they may be the sons of the same father. A
  colony begins with a struggle for bare life, scarcely conscious of her own
  existence, only of her needs. And then success comes, and more success, and
  one morning she wakes to find that she has become a nation and can call the
  older people cousins. She has no standard of comparison, and begins by being
  extremely self-confident and bumptious. Take a young man and plant him with a
  wife in the wilds and tell him to make a home. So soon as he has done it he
  will begin to brag, and the harder the struggle the finer the fellow he will
  think himself. For, mind you, it is all his own&mdash;he owes little or
  nothing to borrowed capital,&mdash;so he writes 'Alone I did it' above his
  shanty, and looks down his nose at Creation. We call him a braggart, but we
  are wrong, for he is something subtler than that. He is a child, supremely
  ignorant, supremely courageous, crowing over his first triumph. And as it is
  with the individual, so with the people. As soon as they can straighten their
  backs and look around, and see a very good and entirely new earth, they
  pronounce the benediction of the Almighty in Eden, and swagger outrageously.
  Everything they have is the finest in the world, and they themselves are the
  last word in human perfection.</p>

  <p>"Well, that is all natural and proper, for it is only a stage, and does
  not last. The man finds himself prosperous, but fragments of his early
  recollections come back to him, and he begins to want to know something about
  his forebears. He used to plume himself on his isolation: now he wants to be
  related to somebody. He suspects that he is badly educated, and he tries to
  correct his deficiencies. By-and-by a tremendous fit of humility seizes him.
  He has made an estate for himself and his children, but he wants some of the
  graces of life. He sends his boys to European schools, or he hunts up his kin
  in the old country, or he imports old furniture and pictures for the
  decoration of his new house. It is the second stage&mdash;when he begins to
  recognise that he cannot isolate himself, that he is bound by ties of kinship
  and race and inherited culture to a larger world. Once again what happens
  with the individual happens with the colony. She has attained to a fuller
  self-consciousness, and is aware not only of her merits but of her defects.
  On one side, therefore, she is conspicuously humble. She wants to learn all
  the wisdom of the ages that the old world can teach, but when she has learned
  a little she will brag once more, and say that she discovered it for herself,
  and then she will be humble again and want to learn further. On the whole she
  will show, if considerately treated, a real intellectual docility. But
  remember, she will never abate one jot of her national pride. The colonist,
  who is eager to get the best that England can give him, and will sit at the
  feet of teachers, is yet perfectly certain at the back of his head that he is
  a monstrously fine fellow, in no way inferior to any man whose advice he asks
  and takes. This pride rubs off a little with experience, but at first it is
  raw and nervous, and terribly quick to take offence. It is in her early
  stages that a colony is most difficult. When she becomes perfectly sure of
  her foundations and looks around the world with calmer eyes, she is no longer
  so intolerant of criticism and eager to scent out insult.</p>

  <p>"Colonial nationalism is built up on the basis of this temperament. The
  chief element in it is pride of achievement and a readiness to fight the
  world to compel acknowledgment. It may be a little irritating at times, but
  the statesman will view it approvingly, for it is the spirit which makes a
  strong people. It will accept advice, but never dictation. At all costs it
  demands the right to work out salvation on its own lines."</p>

  <p>Mr Wakefield paused to relight his cigar, which had gone out in the
  process of his argument.</p>

  <p>"If there were no other elements," he resumed, "then we might say good-bye
  to any thought of a United Empire. But, joined with this local pride, is the
  feeling I have already described, a sentimental attachment to the parent
  race, an eager desire to acquire those other elements of civilisation which
  their new land cannot give them. In a sense, therefore, this national pride
  becomes the chief incentive to union. They admit themselves second to no
  other people, but, when they look round, their practical good sense tells
  them that, as isolated nations, they are separated by centuries of
  development from the greater Powers of the world. They can only realise their
  ambition by the assistance of the other branches of their race. They wish for
  union, because it involves no sacrifice of pride. They believe, rightly or
  wrongly, that they can give as well as receive. If they have less wealth,
  they can show a high level of sterling manhood. If they have a smaller weight
  of political thought behind them, they are free from the less worthy
  accretions of tradition. The contact with mother earth, the struggle with
  nature in her wilder moods in a land of sunshine and winds and great spaces
  where man can breathe&mdash;surely it all must enable them to think freshly
  and clearly, and to recognise some of the simple and eternal truths which are
  clouded over in a more sophisticated life."</p>

  <p>"That," said Lord Launceston, "I am very ready to admit."</p>

  <p>"Good. Well, then, any scheme of union must reckon with this nationalism.
  It is on the constitutional side that it is most jealous, for to a free
  colony her constitution is a kind of visible sign of her independence, the
  very Ark of her Covenant. You must, therefore, devise some scheme which
  leaves their autonomy for the moment intact, for any change must come as a
  concession from them and not as a mandate from England. I look forward to the
  day when the Colonies of their own accord will surrender to the central
  executive many matters which are now in their complete discretion. But that
  executive must contain their own members, and the reform must be mooted by
  some body representative of the whole Empire.</p>

  <p>"And now I come to the practical question of methods. We want a Council,
  which shall involve no harsh break with our present policy, and shall also do
  no violence to colonial nationalism. Remember what our aim is. We have an
  alliance&mdash;for that is the real relationship&mdash;and we want to make
  this alliance closer and more organic, and to devise bonds which shall be
  enduring and yet elastic, expanding with the growth of our corporate life.
  Now a mere advisory council is good, but it is not enough. It is the form
  suitable to an alliance, but we want something more. Our Council should
  therefore be given certain executive functions. Faithful to our principle of
  making use of existing machinery, we might begin with the Cabinet. Why should
  not the King on the executive side sit in imperial as well as in national
  session? The Cabinet at its normal meetings might deal with the affairs of
  the British Islands; but in imperial session it would deal with questions
  common to the Empire&mdash;the army and navy, foreign affairs, commercial
  treaties, the conflict of laws, currency, postage, shipping,
  naturalisation,&mdash;there is no end to the list. At present the British
  Defence Committee has power to summon Colonial representatives to its
  deliberations. Carry the practice one step further. Give the Cabinet the same
  power, and let Colonial privy councillors sit in its special session, not
  merely as advisers but as members of the executive, and you have the nucleus
  of a true Imperial Council."</p>

  <p>"It is a nucleus, certainly," said Hugh, "but if the point about our
  nucleus is its indefinite capacity for expansion, you have omitted one vital
  provision. How are your Colonial representatives to be chosen? If, as at
  present, they are only summoned by the King on the advice of the British
  Cabinet, that Cabinet will remain the sole real executive."</p>

  <p>Mr Wakefield smiled indulgently. "You have raised the very point I was
  coming to. The Colonial members must be representative, otherwise they can
  claim no mandate from their people. I propose to extend the principle of the
  triennial conferences of Premiers. Why should not they take place more
  often,&mdash;say every second year,&mdash;without any great inconvenience.
  The Premiers would be Cabinet Ministers ad hoc, and would attend the Cabinet
  in its imperial session. Few of the greater imperial questions are so urgent
  as not to be able to wait for such sessions, certainly not the great
  questions of policy. The Imperial Cabinet would have power to vote money, the
  Colonial representatives voting according to the proportion of Colonial
  contributions. As the Colonies grow to their full stature and assume more of
  the imperial burdens, these contributions will become larger, and their power
  of control proportionately greater. The Premiers would have a mandate in a
  true sense from their colonies, for the subjects discussed in the Cabinet
  would already have been discussed in their own parliaments, and might even
  have been at issue in the previous elections. In time Colonial officials
  would be appointed to the great executive posts in the Empire, and we should
  attain to the only practical form of imperial federation&mdash;one central
  and representative imperial executive. I would also suggest, as a supplement,
  a permanent committee of the Privy Council, with advisory functions, to
  discuss imperial questions between the sittings of the executive, and a
  permanent Imperial Intelligence Department to keep in touch with any new
  developments. Such is a rough outline of a scheme which seems to me both
  possible and desirable. It may be amended in detail, but I think it is right
  in its main lines."</p>

  <p>"I would like to ask one question," said Mr Astbury. "To what
  representative body would your Imperial Cabinet be accountable?"</p>

  <p>"In the first instance to the British Parliament, though the Colonial
  representatives would of course be accountable to their own parliaments also.
  If at some future time there should come any form of imperial legislature,
  then the Cabinet would naturally account to it."</p>

  <p>Lady Warcliff had hitherto borne small share in the discussions. Her
  extreme mental energy was accustomed to take the form of restless
  organisation rather than the speculations of debate. Since her arrival at
  Musuru she had been busy investigating every detail of the management of that
  immense household, and had all but driven the Scotch major-domo into lunacy.
  She had mastered, too, the principles of the agricultural settlement, and was
  engaged in the somewhat hopeless task of convicting Mr Lowenstein of error in
  certain financial methods he had employed in his philanthropy. She had sat
  through the previous discussions with half-closed eyes and an air of elegant
  isolation. Now her preoccupation with other things seemed at an end, for she
  took up Mr Wakefield's parable with a surprising vivacity.</p>

  <p>"I quite see the merits of your scheme, but you will permit me one
  criticism. An imperial executive, such as you propose, would no doubt do
  admirably all the work of the Empire which concerned the mother-country and
  the free Colonies. But what about the dependencies&mdash;India, Africa, and
  the Far East? I have always regarded them as in a special sense the domain of
  England, in which the Colonies had no manner of interest. Would they not,
  with their fetish of independence, resent the very existence of
  protectorates, or in any case give them a very perfunctory attention?"</p>

  <p>"Your objection, my lady," said Mr Wakefield, "springs from a
  misunderstanding of democracy, and especially colonial democracy. If the
  people are ever to rule they must learn to trust their servants. At present,
  I grant you, they are apt to be childishly suspicious of the proconsul. But
  that suspicion is no true democratic product. The only justification of
  democracy, as Lord Launceston said yesterday, is that it clears the way for
  superiority. Until it is realised that its mandate, once given, carries with
  it complete confidence it will never be a governing creed. And this is
  beginning to be realised. It is the labour leader who is the best
  disciplinarian, and the demagogue who is given the most rope. Besides, our
  democracy in the Colonies is a very curious thing, and I look to it to
  counteract the vices of the home-grown variety. It advocates conscription
  and colonial navies, and it is inspired throughout with national pride. If it
  had its own people sharing in the government of India or Egypt, do you
  suppose it would talk about 'satraps' and 'prancing proconsuls'? It would
  think of the protectorates as God-given trusts and fields for the vitality of
  our race to exercise itself in. Remember, our democracy is a white man's
  democracy, and we are not moved by any foolish Rousseauism about the rights
  of man. It is otherwise, I know, in England. When I was there this summer I
  made it my business to see people of all shades of opinion. At a meeting in
  the Queen's Hall I heard Mr Corley-Pratt declare that India was an incubus, a
  wen, a lifeless weight, a stain upon the conscience of the British people,
  and everything else that could be metaphorically mixed. I read a protest by
  some University professors against the annexation of Situnga, on the ground
  that to keep a people in political tutelage was to be guilty of slavery. I
  found many good men who still clung to the Gladstonian view that any rising
  of fanatics was an effort of a people 'rightly struggling to be free.' These
  gentlemen would have all the possessions of England redistributed by some
  International Labour Congress. I tell you that such infernal nonsense would
  not be tolerated in the Colonies for one instant, and the man who talked it
  would be lynched. No, madame; we have our race pride, and any insult to it by
  professor or politician is hotly resented. Our democracy is the creed of men
  and not of sentimentalists."</p>

  <p>Lord Launceston had listened a little anxiously to Mr Wakefield's closing
  words.</p>

  <p>"I grant its merits, but it has its dangers too. A high-handed
  Bismarckianism is as much a risk to the well-being of our dependencies as any
  academic cult of the rights of man. But I agree with you that democracy will
  find in itself a cure for its weaknesses, and that it will not endanger those
  great realms we hold in trust for races who are unfit to struggle
  singlehanded in the arena of the world. In these questions I am what you call
  a 'mugwump.' I lay down no canon, and only ask that our grave responsibility
  be recognised, and that each problem as it arises be determined on the facts,
  illumined by reason and conscience. But to return to your Council, with which
  I am wholly in sympathy. I think that on the whole your account of Colonial
  feeling is just. There is no doubt about the reality of the impulse towards
  union. At present our machinery is adequate, but it will not always remain
  so, and what is right in an alliance will be futile in a more intimate
  relation. We must recognise this tendency and prepare for change; very
  cautiously at first, for we are dealing with <i>life</i>, remember, and no
  dead matter which can be coerced into any mould we please. The reform, we are
  agreed, must begin on the executive side. We have our Empire, and it is right
  that its common services should be administered as efficiently as possible.
  There we are on solid ground. As I have said, on the question of legislative
  federation I am very doubtful. I am not at all certain whether the world is
  not passing away from the doctrine that legislation should proceed only from
  a representative body. So certain German legalists think, and there is a good
  deal to be said for the view. But at any rate we can neglect that question
  for the moment, and trust to time to bring its own solution. But the other is
  a question for the present. There is no need for haste, but a beginning must
  be made, and the ground prepared for development. It is well to begin early
  to lay down the lines of the vessel into which we are to change, for if we
  wait till our present ship goes to pieces we may find ourselves in the water.
  You cannot improvise an army in the hour of need, and it is no easier to
  improvise a constitution."</p>

  <p>Mr Wakefield had lit another large cigar, and, pleased with the ready
  acceptance of his views, turned a cheerful face to the company.</p>

  <p>"There must be no <i>undue</i> haste, but we should not waste time. As you
  know, I strongly believe that the moment has come for a reform of imperial
  tariffs so as to create a system of preference within the Empire. If we
  delay, the Colonies will make separate treaties with other countries, and
  where the treasure is there will the heart be also. Further, certain
  industries which might yet be preserved to us will pass to other hands,
  killed in British hands by protected rivals abroad. I will not argue the
  matter, for our host, who does not agree with me, has vetoed the subject as
  foreign to the purpose of our conference. But my point is that the thing can
  only be settled by some representative Imperial Council&mdash;not a mere
  conference of Premiers, but a Council with a mandate from the whole Empire to
  consider and decide the question, and with all the material for decision at
  its call. Moreover, it could only be worked in practice by an imperial
  executive. I agree with our opponents to this extent, that without some such
  machinery it would be madness to elaborate any preferential system. Take
  again the business of defence, on which Colonel Graham may have something to
  say."</p>

  <p>Graham, who was still suffering from the drowsiness begotten of hours
  unwontedly late, hastily collected his wits, and asked for the question to be
  repeated.</p>

  <p>"It is a matter I have thought a good deal about, and I have bombarded the
  War Office with my schemes. Generally speaking, I want to affiliate colonial
  levies to the regular army for training purposes, and also for mobilisation
  in time of war. The last war showed that we fought as an Empire, but the
  difficulty is to organise all our splendid fighting strength so as to give it
  the maximum of force in a crisis. I will not trouble you with any of my
  schemes, which are long and intricate. But the rock we shipwreck on is the
  question of colonial contributions, and this obstacle will remain until we
  get some kind of joint executive. We cannot get the Colonies to put their men
  under our control unless they have a share in that control, and no one blames
  them for the feeling. They want to run their own show themselves, but they
  would be perfectly content to be affiliated with us if they had a say in the
  management. The same thing appears in the contributions to the navy. No
  colony likes to vote a sum and have no voice in expending it. It is the old
  question of taxation without representation. A common executive would get us
  over the difficulty, for then it would be the whole Empire which asked for
  men and money and directed the use of both."</p>

  <p>Lady Flora had slipped silently into the room and perched herself upon an
  arm of Marjory Haystoun's chair. She looked a little bored with the
  discussion, and was preparing to depart again when the stern eye of Mr
  Wakefield arrested her. Apparently addressing his words to her, though in
  reality unconscious of her presence, he declared that Colonel Graham had
  spoken excellent good sense.</p>

  <p>"Our main obstacle after all is the insularity of England. The Colonies
  are insular too, but that does not matter, for it is with England that the
  motive power still lies, and from her must come the chief impetus. At this
  moment London is the centre of gravity for the Empire, perhaps for the world.
  But how long will that continue? England owes her predominance mainly to two
  facts. First, she has been outside the arena of European strife, and has not
  been for centuries the cockpit of wars. Her development, political and
  economic, has been allowed to proceed unchecked. Again, by the gift of
  Heaven, she was the fortunate possessor of certain means of production, such
  as coal and iron, and was able to get a long lead in the industrial movement.
  But how long will all this continue? Already her lead is shortening. In time
  her coal and iron supplies will decline. She owes her large population mainly
  to her industrial pre-eminence, and the loss of it will mean starvation and
  bankruptcy. She cannot hope to compete with countries which feed themselves
  and are self-contained towards the world. But where she fails as an island,
  she may succeed as an empire, for the Empire has within its bounds every
  ingredient of national wealth which other peoples can show. In time to come
  the centre of gravity will change according to natural economic laws. If
  electricity should replace coal as the motive force of the future, a country
  such as Canada, with her immense water-power, will be far better endowed by
  nature than England. Or some undreamed-of force may be discovered by science
  which will make some other colony the predominant industrial partner.
  Further, manufacturers will in the long-run migrate to the site of the raw
  material, and Birmingham and Lancashire will not always keep their
  prerogative. At present, again, London, from her position and her vast
  accumulated wealth, is the financial centre of the globe. But every European
  nation is turning her eyes to the development of her outlying possessions;
  and, moreover, we have Japan and the United States, and in the near future
  China, to carry that centre out of Europe. I can foresee the day when Sydney
  or Vancouver will be far more eligibly situated than London for transacting
  the business of the world. Well, if all this will happen some time or other,
  surely it is wise to make early provision that it shall happen smoothly and
  comfortably. If you can arrange that industries shall have the chance of
  transference on natural lines throughout the Empire, and that population
  shall follow them, you have no need to fear any economic <i>débâcle</i>. At
  present you have forty millions of people to our ten, but what will be the
  proportion in a hundred years' time? We must provide for some elasticity in
  our interests, and this can only be secured by thinking of the Empire not as
  England plus a number of poor relations, but as one organic whole, whose
  centre is to be determined by the evidence of time. This is no new doctrine.
  Adam Smith, who will not be suspected of wild-cat dogmas, preached it as the
  logical corollary to any policy of colonisation. In the early centuries of
  the Christian era the great Councils of the Church were held, now in Spain,
  now on the shores of the Bosphorus; and such mobility, which is the fruit of
  true cohesion, must be the ideal of our Empire if it is to survive. We are
  connected at present, but it is to the interest of us all, and especially of
  England, to be more closely related if we are to be secure against the
  future. Insularism must cease to dominate British policy, and be left only to
  the obscurantists and reactionaries. Such constitutional union as I propose
  is only a small and formal beginning, but it will make broad the path for the
  true spiritual change."</p>

  <p>"Imperialism, then," said Lord Appin, "is to be defined from the English
  point of view as a kind of national old age pensions scheme?"</p>

  <p>But Mr Wakefield, having had his say, and having secured, as he believed,
  the assent of his audience, was not to be disturbed by any epigram.</p>

  <p>"I accept the definition gladly," he said. "That is Imperialism on the
  business side. The other sides&mdash;and I grant you they are many&mdash;I
  leave to people more competent to deal with them."</p>

  <p>Carey walked to one of the shelves and took down a book.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember," he said, "a passage in which John Davis, the
  Elizabethan seaman, held out a prospect for his countrymen? I fear he was
  actually talking of the North Pole, where his dreams have not been realised;
  but we can apply his words to the ideal of a united empire:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"'How blessed may we think this nation to be, for they are
  in perpetual light, and never know what darkness meaneth, by the benefit of
  twilight and full moons, as the learned in astronomy do very well know; which
  people, if they have the notice of their eternity by the comfortable light of
  the Gospels, then are they blessed, and of all nations most blessed. Why then
  do we neglect the search of this excellent discovery, against which there can
  be nothing said to hinder the same? Why do we refuse to see the dignity of
  God's creation, since it hath pleased the Divine Majesty to place us the
  nearest neighbour thereunto? I know there is no true Englishman that can in
  conscience refuse to be a contributor to procure this so great a happiness to
  his country, whereby not only the prince and mighty men of the land shall be
  highly renowned, but also the merchants, tradesmen, and artificers mightily
  enriched.'</p><br>

  <p>"You see what an old creed ours is, and how catholic in its application.
  You will find cover under these words, Wakefield, for your practicality, and
  Marjory for her transcendentalism, and Teddy for his romance. I think we may
  close our discussion for the evening with John Davis, who makes a good tail-
  piece. For the next two days we shall let the matter rest, for some of us are
  going hunting. On the evening of the day after to-morrow I propose that we
  take up another question of detail, and a very practical one&mdash;our
  tropical possessions."</p>

  <p>Considine rose and marched resolutely from the room. "If you and
  Alastair," he said to Hugh, "expect to be ready at four to-morrow morning,
  you had better get to bed."</p>

  <p>Lady Flora looked at him with stern disapproval. "Am I to be allowed to
  come?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"My dear child!" said Mrs Yorke. "They are going after lions! Besides,
  what about the conventions?"</p>

  <p>The girl shook an impatient head. "You have broken our compact at the very
  beginning," she whispered to Hugh. "If I were not such a Christian and such a
  lady, I should be seriously annoyed. But you are quite wrong if you think
  that you'll have any adventures as good as I shall have here. I am going
  straight off into the wilds on the white pony to make friends with Prester
  John."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE stars, which had been shining with a frosty brilliance,
  were paling towards dawn before Hugh was sufficiently awake to see where he
  was going. He had been routed out by Alastair Graham in the small hours, and
  had somehow found himself on a horse, in a great blanket-coat, with
  half-a-dozen dusky figures trotting alongside. He had been jogging on for
  half an hour before he finally rubbed sleep out of his eyes, and, drinking
  long draughts of the electric air, roused himself to some interest in life.
  The sky was changing from black to some ineffable shade of purple, and the
  track among the mimosa thorns was beginning to glimmer ahead in a fantastic
  grey. Soon remoter objects distinguished themselves&mdash;a kopje, a big
  tree, a jag of rock. And then over the crest of the far downs came a red arc
  of fire, and the heavens changed to amethyst and saffron, and, last of all,
  to a delicate pale blue, where wisps of rosy cloud hung like the veils of the
  morning. They were near the western edge of the escarpment, and, looking down
  into the trough, Hugh saw over the great sea of mist the blue fingers of far
  mountains rising clear and thin into the sky. The air was bitter cold, and
  the cheeks tingled with the light wind which attends the dawn. Lines of
  Theocritus&mdash;the <i>alektor kokkuzon napkaisi</i> of the Seventh
  Idyll&mdash;ran in Hugh's mind from his reading of yesterday. He realised
  that his senses had become phenomenally acute. His eyes seemed to see
  farther, his ears to mark the least sound in the bush, while the scents of
  the morning came to his nostrils with a startling freshness. Pungent, clean,
  yet with an indescribable tropic softness in it, was the air of the desert,
  which he sniffed like the Scriptural wild ass. He looked round at his
  companions. Graham, a burly figure in a sheepskin coat, rode somewhat in the
  manner in which Napoleon is painted as retreating from Moscow, sitting
  squarely in the saddle with a meditative chin on his breast. Considine's long
  lean figure on a blue roan seemed wholly in keeping with the landscape. He
  wore an old khaki suit and a broad-brimmed felt hat, and sat his horse as
  loosely as a Boer. He leaned forward, peering keenly about him, whistling
  some catch of song. In civilised places he looked the ordinary far-travelled
  sportsman, a little browner and tougher, perhaps, than most. But the
  Considine of the Turf Club and the Considine of the veld were different
  beings. The bright eyes, set deep in the dark face, and the sinewy strength
  of his pose gave him the air of some Elizabethan who had sailed strange seas
  to a far country. To Hugh at the moment he seemed the primal type of the
  adventurer.</p>

  <p>Soon the travellers were greeted by the most comforting of all the scents
  of the wilds&mdash;the smell of a wood fire, and the faint odour of roasting
  coffee. Their boys had made their breakfast-camp in the crook of a little
  stream, where the forest ended and the long downs of the northern plateau
  began. In a few minutes Hugh was sitting luxuriously on a pile of rugs,
  drinking excellent coffee out of a tin mug. The Trappist silence of the early
  ride was over.</p>

  <p>"You'll get none of the luxury of Musuru here, my boy," Considine said.
  "We are going to have the same fare as Alastair and I enjoyed a week
  ago&mdash;tinned stuff and what we kill. You've hunted yourself, and know
  that to eat potted meat with your fingers out of a tin after a hard day is
  better than a dinner at the Ritz. Akhub," he cried, "what about the
  beats?"</p>

  <p>The chief shikari&mdash;Zanzibar! Arab, ex-slave-trader, and heaven knows
  what besides&mdash;bowed gravely, and informed his master that he had
  arranged for Graham to go due east into the down country, where buck and
  rhino were plentiful; Considine should keep on to the north, where he had a
  better chance of a good eland head; while Hugh was to remain on the edge of
  the escarpment, where lay the best chance of lion.</p>

  <p>Considine nodded. "You'll want your Mannlicher for buck," he said to Hugh,
  "and your '400 cordite express. For pity's sake don't go into the bush after
  lion without the express. Akhub is going with you and will look after you. I
  want you to get a lion, but remember he is worth taking pains about, or he
  may get you. I've twice been clawed by them, and it's no sort of fun."</p>

  <p>Breakfast over, the parties separated, and Hugh with the shikari and five
  boys set out along the rim of the plateau. A pleasurable excitement, with
  just a shade of trepidation in it, flavoured his morning pipe. He yearned to
  get a lion, but he had some nervousness lest he might show up badly in a
  tight place, having never before faced anything more dangerous than a sleepy
  Norwegian bear. He was a good shot enough in a Scotch deer-forest, but a
  situation where a miss meant not annoyance but mortal peril was new to his
  experience.</p>

  <p>The cold morning changed to a hot noonday, and at two in the afternoon
  Hugh sat down to lunch, in a better frame of mind. He had got two hartebeests
  with fair heads, and in a marshy place a really fine waterbuck. His anxiety,
  he found, had not impaired his steadiness, and he was recovering his
  composure. He was still soft from civilised life and tormented by a thirst
  which several cups of hot tea barely assuaged. Lunch was perforce a short
  meal since he had to meet the others at a certain point which Akhub declared
  was three hours' riding ahead, and if he wished for more hunting there was no
  time to be lost.</p>

  <p>The afternoon's trek was hot and dusty, and he had little sport. Green
  doves and a white-tailed hawk were the only signs of life in the bush, which
  seemed to lie torpid in a universal drowsiness. By-and-by they entered a
  timber tract, where large acacias and junipers made glades like an English
  park. It was drawing towards evening, and according to Akhub's calculations
  another half-hour would bring them into touch with the rest of the party.
  Hugh had almost abandoned the thought of sport, when a sudden cry of
  <i>'ngatun-yo</i> from the boys made him look down a tributary glade. He saw
  a great yellow beast, like an overgrown dog, go lolloping across into a
  thicket of trees, and with a beating heart he recognised that he was at last
  in the presence of a veritable lion.</p>

  <p>Earlier in the day he had carefully planned out his conduct. He would
  quickly yet calmly take the express from the bearer, and circumspectly yet
  swiftly reconnoitre the ground for a shot. Alas for good resolutions! At the
  first sight of that tawny back Hugh was off in pursuit down the glade at full
  gallop, while an agitated boy waved the neglected weapon in his rear. He had
  his Mannlicher on his saddle-bow, and almost unconsciously he slipped in
  cartridges while his eyes searched the environs for a sign of his quarry.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he saw him a hundred yards ahead trotting along a narrow native
  path. He was going slowly, unconscious apparently of the proximity of man.
  Hugh dismounted, hitched his well-broken horse to a tree, and sent a flying
  shot at the beast, which had the effect of making him halt for a second, look
  round, and then turn into the shade of the trees on the right. Hugh ran up to
  where he had entered, and a little nervously looked into the sparse bush.
  There was the lion well in range, so, kneeling down and aiming carefully, he
  fired. A shot from behind is never easy, and as it chanced the bullet went
  low and shattered the left hind leg. The beast stopped with a growl of pain,
  turned slowly round and looked at the intruder, lashing the low bushes with
  his tail.</p>

  <p>The moment had come for a second shot, and Hugh got it in full on the
  chest, but a little too high for the heart. An express bullet would have
  stretched him out, but the little Mannlicher had no such power. The great
  beast roared in fury, caught sight of his enemy behind a tree-trunk, advanced
  a pace, and then gathered himself for a charge.</p>

  <p>With a nervous hand Hugh had managed to slip in fresh cartridges, and as
  the lion moved he fired. It was a clean miss, and Hugh had a confused sense
  of something yellow and evil-smelling flying through the air as he leaped
  aside. Whether consciously or unconsciously, he had fired his second barrel,
  and the next he knew he was picking himself up, unhurt but shaken and
  blood-stained, from beneath a branch which the lion had broken, while the
  creature himself lay stone-dead a yard off. The last shot had by a miracle
  found the heart.</p>

  <p>Hugh's first impulse was to make assurance sure by firing into the body,
  but a moment's inspection convinced him that there was no life left. Then his
  mood became one of insane jubilation. Alone and with the wrong rifle he had
  killed his lion. He felt three inches taller; he longed for Akhub, for
  Considine, for any one to come and see. And then a growl behind him made him
  turn his head, and he forgot his pride in abject terror. For there, about
  twelve yards off, was a second lion, bigger and darker in the mane, glaring
  at him wrathfully with his ugly jaws half-open.</p>

  <p>His hand went to his cartridge-belt, only to find it empty. He felt his
  pockets, but not a cartridge remained. They had dropped out in the fall and
  lay some yards off beyond the dead beast.</p>

  <p>Hugh did the only thing possible, and sprang for the nearest tree. He was
  not a moment too soon, for as his quaking body was swung up to the second
  branch something tore at his leg, and the next moment he was contemplating
  boot and gaiter ripped off at the back and a long scratch in the flesh. In
  the same second he seemed to hear a shot ring out&mdash;no ping of a
  Mannlicher, but the honest thunder of an express&mdash;and the long dark face
  of Akhub appeared in the glade.</p>

  <p>It was a very chastened hunter who descended the tree to receive the
  congratulations and reproaches of the chief shikari. It was abundantly clear
  to him that he had done an unpardonable thing, and, but for the activity of
  his boys and the near neighbourhood of the tree, might have been stretched
  torn and dying beside his quarry. But the mood could not last. The
  exhilaration of a successful adventure came back to him. After all, he had
  walked up his lion with a small-bore and killed him unaided. With huge
  pleasure he now saw that his own animal was the finer and bigger of the
  two.</p>

  <p>He lit a pipe and jogged on in the deepening twilight, his whole soul
  filled with the joy of conquest. This was life indeed, for, say what we may,
  there is no satisfaction so intense as victory over some one of the savage
  forces of nature. Better for the moment than vice-royalties or Garters or
  millions is the joy of making the first ascent of some hard peak, or sailing
  a boat home through a tempest, or seeing some wild animal fall before your
  own courage and skill. In that hour Hugh would not have changed places with
  Launceston or Carey.</p>

  <p>Soon he came into the glow of a big fire. Lanterns were hanging from the
  boughs of a huge juniper, and beds were being got ready underneath. At little
  fires close by the boys were cooking supper.</p>

  <p>The others welcomed him with a great shout. "Well, what luck?"</p>

  <p>"Two lions," said Hugh, with studied modesty. "One mine and one
  Akhub's&mdash;and a few buck."</p>

  <p>"Gad! you've had the cream of the day," said Considine. "I got nothing but
  a hartebeest. And Alastair never had a shot. How did you get your lion?"</p>

  <p>Hugh told his story to a disapproving audience.</p>

  <p>"You foolhardy young devil! Though, after all, I suppose I've done the
  same thing in my time. How's your leg?"</p>

  <p>"A scratch. Only wants a simple dressing. I've learned my lesson all
  right, for I never was in such a blue funk in my life. You don't find me
  stalking lion with a Mannlicher again. For heaven's sake, old man, give me a
  drink."</p>

  <p>Considine, following the bushveld ritual, doled out to each a small
  whisky-and-soda. "Keep that in mind, Hugh, when you next go on trek. After a
  long day you want a pick-me-up before you dine, or you can't eat; and if you
  can't eat you can't sleep, and if you can't sleep you get fever as sure as
  fate. Never touch the stuff in the daytime, and I'm against it at dinner, but
  as a pick-me-up there's nothing like it."</p>

  <p>They sat down with tremendous appetites to that best of meals, a hunter's
  supper. There was tinned soup, which they drank out of mugs, curried
  guinea-fowl which Alastair had shot, venison-steaks stewed with onions, and a
  species of tinned plum-pudding which was the joy of Considine's heart. Coffee
  and peach brandy completed the courses, and then the three got into
  sleeping-bags, had more logs put on the fire, lit their pipes, and prepared
  for the slow talk which merges gradually in slumber.</p>

  <p>Hugh snuggled into his kaross with a profound sense of comfort. He felt
  warm, satisfied, and indomitably cheerful. Never had his pipe seemed sweeter;
  never had he felt his mind more serene or his body more instinct with life.
  The wide glade was lit up by the fire, and the high branches made a kind of
  emerald canopy picked out with the golden points of stars. The boys were
  singing monotonous native songs around their bivouac, and through the wood
  came the eerie rustling of night winds. A zareba of thorns had been built
  round the camp, close to which the horses and mules stood patiently champing
  their fodder. The camp was a miniature city, with its fortifications and its
  watchmen, and Hugh felt himself in a new world&mdash;the hunter's
  civilisation, the oasis which he makes anew for himself each night in wilds
  which are careless of human life. For a moment his mind travelled back to
  Musuru, where at that hour delicately clad women would be sitting down to
  rich food amid flowers and silver and white linen. The contrast was so
  piquant that in the catholic mind it awoke the spirit of comedy.</p>

  <p>"What are you cackling at, Hugh?" Considine asked. "Fling me your tobacco-
  pouch like a good chap, for mine's empty. Lord! how often I've lain like this
  and smoked and looked up at the sky. And how many good fellows have done the
  same and are at it still! It's all very well for Wakefield and the rest to
  theorise about Empire. I daresay it is logical and scientific enough. But you
  can't get the feeling of all it means till you've got very close to the bones
  of the old Earth, and heard her muttering to herself, and realised what a
  tough old fiend she is and what a job it is to get even with her."</p>

  <p><i>"Si jeunesse savait!"</i> said Hugh. "That's the tragedy of
  life&mdash;that the men who do the things can never tell about them or quite
  understand them. They only feel dimly that they are in the grip of some
  gigantic destiny. I don't suppose the Three Hundred when they combed their
  long hair for death before Thermopylae ever thought what a gorgeous game they
  were playing. If they had, they would have gone into battle drunk with pride
  and walked through Xerxes' army. It seems a law of mortality that the
  instinct for deeds and the guiding and understanding brain cannot be equally
  matched, except once in a thousand years in a Caesar. The world is full of
  dumb, blind people, doing admirable work and faced with wonderful sights, and
  all the time without a glimmering of an idea of the magnificence of it."</p>

  <p>Sir Edward Considine was in ordinary life a gentleman of cultivated
  manners, who spoke the English tongue with reasonable purity. But in the bush
  he developed a style of his own, and talked a slang culled from four
  continents, which the present writer cannot hope to reproduce. He tossed
  Hugh's tobacco-pouch back to him, raised himself on one elbow from his
  couch, and shook his head emphatically.</p>

  <p>"They understand," he said, "better than you or I can tell. I've made a
  special study of the scallywag, and what I don't know about him ain't worth
  knowing. Most people make the mistake of thinking that he is always of the
  same type. There are a hundred types of him, and only one thing common to
  each&mdash;they are all dreamers."</p>

  <p>"But for your infernal noise I should be one now," said Graham sleepily
  from the far bed. Considine picked up a boot, landed it neatly in the midst
  of the heap of rugs, and continued&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I've been stuck up in half a dozen parts of the world with fellows who
  hadn't been home for years. Most of them used to talk Johnsonian English
  simply because they had forgotten when they last spoke to a white man, and
  thought of English only as a book language. None of them talked much, and it
  was the devil's own job to get them to speak of themselves. But they were the
  salt of the earth for all that, living hard, working hard, and ready to sell
  their lives any day in the way of business. Do you think that kind of man is
  only a mill-horse, jogging on in his round because there is nothing else for
  him to do? I tell you every man-jack of them has got his own private dream.
  He knows he has got his race behind him, and that he is the advance-guard,
  and the thought bucks him up to rot away in swamps and shiver with fever, and
  in all probability be cleaned out in some obscure row. Nobody knows another
  man's life, but we get glimpses now and then of his inner soul and take off
  our hats to it. You remember Lacey, who was at Eton with Alastair and me? Ask
  Alastair about him."</p>

  <p>"What? the fellow who was killed somewhere up Chitral way?"</p>

  <p>Considine's boot had brought Graham to attention. "Yes; he held a border
  fort with a dozen men for five days against several hundred ruffians. He
  fought so well that they wanted to spare him at the end and made him all
  kinds of offers. But he stuck it out, and they only got in over his body.
  When we found him he had about fifty wounds on him."</p>

  <p>"I remember the story," said Hugh.</p>

  <p>"Well, I was a pal of his, and he had made me his executor. I got his
  diary that he had written up till the day he died. If I hadn't seen that book
  I would have sworn that Lacey was the ordinary stupid fellow who fought
  because he liked it, and that he had stuck it out more from obstinacy than
  from policy. But the diary changed my mind. I found that he had carefully
  considered the whole question of surrender. Overtures had been made to him,
  and apparently they were such as he could have trusted. But he concluded it
  was a case for the white man's pride. He reasoned it all out. If he kept his
  head up to the last, he thought that the moral effect on that particular part
  of the border would be so great that there would be little more trouble. He
  deliberately chose death because he fancied it was his duty. And of course he
  was happy. The last pages of that little book, all grimy and blotted with
  blood, were one long paean of triumph. He couldn't spell, and he had very
  little idea of writing, yet the end of that book was the purest lyric of joy.
  The sacrifice was not in vain either, for, as you know, it ended the war, and
  now the blackguards who killed him burn offerings to his shade at hillside
  shrines."</p>

  <p>"I don't for one moment deny that the great spirits&mdash;the
  leaders&mdash;have a clear ideal before them. But surely the same thing
  doesn't apply to the ordinary rolling-stone who wanders into adventures
  because he cannot keep out of them, and hasn't an idea in his head except
  that he likes to knock about the world."</p>

  <p>"I never yet met the man without an idea in his head," said Considine;
  "but I give you up the ne'er-do-well, who has something rotten about him in
  heart or brain. I mean the wanderer who likes the wilds better than
  civilisation, and therefore is what civilised people call an idler, simply
  because the only things they recognise as work cannot be done in the kind of
  places he frequents. I know the breed, for he belongs to my own totem, and in
  defending him I am more or less justifying myself. My game is exploration,
  and I work at it pretty hard, though it's what you might call an intermittent
  profession. Another fellow's is natural history or mapping or prospecting or
  something else. We're devilish unsatisfactory people to our wives and
  families, I know, but, still, we don't rust. We keep our minds keen and our
  bodies active, and I scarcely call that idling. We're the least frivolous
  kind of man on the planet, and the least vulgar. Look at the ordinary
  industrious citizen. He wants to 'get on' in his beastly trade, and to have a
  house in Mayfair and a place in the country, and marry his daughters well,
  and get into Parliament and have a title to clap on to his squalid name. Or
  perhaps he wants to be applauded in the papers and be treated as a personage
  wherever he goes. I ask you if these are ambitions for a white man?"</p>

  <p>Considine filled his pipe again from Hugh's pouch, and lit a match with
  difficulty. A light wind had got up which flickered among the high
  branches.</p>

  <p>"Last time I was at home I went with Blanche to a ball at the Templetons.
  It was a big affair&mdash;royalty and ambassadors and a brace of foreign
  grand dukes, one of whom once hunted with me in the Selkirks. I stood for
  about half an hour beside a pillar and watched and meditated. The noise round
  about me was just like the jabbering of monkeys in a Malayan forest. None of
  the people looked you squarely in the eyes, and the women had all faces like
  marionettes. I saw my aunt's head bobbing and grinning, and her talk was some
  scandal about her oldest friend. Two fellows were standing near me&mdash;one
  was in the Cabinet and the other was a tremendous legal swell&mdash;and they
  were laughing at some of Manton's last sayings. Hanged if I could see any
  humour in 'em! One of the two came and spoke to me afterwards, and said he
  supposed the scene must be a pleasant change to me after the Congo. I told
  him it wasn't much of a change, only the monkeys were caged instead of
  running wild on the tree-tops. He laughed as if I had said something funny.
  After a bit I got very sad and sober. Young girls passed me with romance
  still in their eyes, and others, a little older, with the romance dead. I
  seemed to be looking on at a vast puppet-show, and I began to wonder if
  anybody was alive except myself. And then the comedy of it struck me, and I
  laughed to myself till people turned round to look at me, and Blanche came
  and asked me if I was ill. Of course, it was a game, and a good enough game,
  but yet to most of the people it was a tremendous reality, all they knew of
  life, and they would have shrieked in holy horror if I had told them that
  they represented not the last word in civilisation but a return to a very
  early stage of barbarism. The rough fellow clearing trees with an axe for his
  home was miles farther up the scale of being than they.... And then old
  Thirlstone drifted towards me. I daresay you know him, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"The man who was made an Under-Secretary the other day?"</p>

  <p>"Same fellow. I used to know him long ago in the Service, and he was the
  hardest-bitten devil I have ever struck. He was in Tibet with Alastair, and
  he and I once had a try at getting into Kafiristan. Then his uncle died, and
  he became an enormously rich peer and had to come home and attend to his
  affairs. When he first came back he dined with us, and Blanche had a lot of
  people to meet him. He hadn't much to say for himself, and everybody thought
  him a bore, except me and a few of his own kind. Well, he settled down and
  married, and got into the ordinary rut, and there he was, still brown in the
  face but rather tired about the eyes. Blanche had told me he was much
  improved, so I knew what to look out for. All his roughness and shyness were
  gone, and he had the same kind of manner as the other monkeys, only he looked
  more wholesome. I wanted to speak to him, so we found a quiet corner in the
  supper-room. And then I put it straight to him, if he liked his new life. He
  said he did, talked a lot of rot about doing his duty in the sphere into
  which it had pleased God to call him, and about the fun of being at the
  centre of things; but there was not much conviction in his tone. So I began
  to tell him what had been happening to me, mentioned some places we had been
  together in and friends we had known. Soon I got him as keen as mustard. He
  dropped all his long words and fell into the honest slang of the backwoods.
  We had half an hour's talk of old times, and then his wife came in with the
  big boss of his party. You know Lady Thirlstone, I daresay. A pretty American
  with a figure and fine eyes, but neither complexion nor heart. Thirlstone got
  up to join them and looked at me rather sickly. 'I've got my wings clipped,
  old man,' he said. 'Wish me joy of my gilt cage, for if I weren't a gentleman
  I'd kick it to splinters to-morrow.'"</p>

  <p>Somewhere in the forest a jackal barked and was answered from the far side
  of the camp. The fire was dying down, and a native boy came forward to heap
  on more logs.</p>

  <p>"And yet," said Hugh, "what good is the <i>Wanderlust</i> in itself? You
  may have all manner of dreams, but you spend your strength in futility. I
  daresay Thirlstone sitting chafing in Parliament is playing a better part in
  the solid work of the world than Thirlstone gallivanting about the Hindu
  Kush."</p>

  <p>"That's where you are wrong, my dear," said Considine. "We are the
  advance-guard, always pushing a little farther on and making the road easier
  for those who come after us, the serious solid fellows who make laws and
  create industries, and generally reap where we have sown. You cannot measure
  the work of a pioneer by the scale of a bagman. We keep the fire burning,
  though we go out ourselves. Our failure is our success. We don't found
  colonies and build cities, but unless we had gone before no one would have
  come after."</p>

  <p>"Hugh," said Graham solemnly, "if you encourage Teddy, he'll keep on
  talking like a minor poet till daybreak."</p>

  <p>"I like his minor poetry. Go on, and never mind that savage. You defend
  the adventurer because he keeps a nation restless?"</p>

  <p>"True for you. He is the electric force in civilisation. Without him we
  should settle, like Moab, on our lees and rot. And you cannot measure him by
  ordinary results, because his work is spiritual and unworldly. Raleigh failed
  in everything he put his hand to, and went to the scaffold with all his
  schemes discredited. And yet he had set moving the force which was to make
  his dreams a superb reality. The pioneer must always be ploughed under, but
  only the fool considers him a failure. That Nietzsche fellow Appin was
  chaffing me about the other night has got the right end of the stick. The
  individual is tremendously important. We think of men as mere cog-wheels in
  some great machine, whose only value is as part of the works. Heaven forbid
  that I should deny the value of the great social machine in ordinary life.
  But there are many who have no share in it, and they have their value none
  the less, for, if you don't mind mixed metaphors, they somehow generate the
  motive power for the whole show. Take the case of Gordon. You may tell me
  that he was mad and a fanatic, that he ran his own head into the noose, that
  he had flaws in his character, that he was impossible as a colleague or a
  subordinate. I daresay that is all true, and I don't care. His failure and
  the manner of it were worth a dozen successful wars and a whole regiment of
  impeccable statesmen. It put new faith into the race, and screwed us up for
  another century.</p>

  <p>"Remember," Considine continued, "that individualism is the keynote of our
  work. I have seen the French business in North Africa, and know their
  methods. There the State moves forward as one man, and not a step is taken in
  the advance till lines are laid from the base and the country is well held in
  the rear. Everything is centralised and officially directed. That is not our
  way. We send our younger sons out into the world, expressly forbid them to do
  things, disavow and discourage them, and then profit by their disobedience.
  As long as we have hundreds of young men who ask only the chance of danger,
  and are ready to take the whole world on their shoulders, we need have no
  fear for the future. When every one demands his price and asks to be shown
  some fair likelihood of success before he tackles his job, then we are
  morally bound to decay&mdash;</p>

  <p>"My pipe is out, and I am getting sleepy. We've an early start before us,
  so I suppose we should compose ourselves to slumber."</p>

  <p>Soon the world was quiet, save for the occasional crackling of a log and
  the deep breathing of the sleepers. Hugh pulled the furs about his chin, and
  watched the red heart of the fire glowing in the velvet dark of the night. He
  floated off into vague dreams, where lion-hunts ended in London ball-rooms,
  and almost in the same moment it seemed to him that he was awake again, with
  the fire black and the bitter cold gripping at his exposed neck and
  shoulders. He drew his coverings together, and sank into that light dreamless
  sleep which is the true luxury of the wilds. In another moment of time it was
  dawn, and, wide awake and refreshed, he was looking at a pale morning sky
  from which the stars were fading, and hearing the cheerful sound of the boys
  making early coffee.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE gardens at Musuru cover three thousand feet of a
  mountain-side, sloping steeply down from the lawns around the house to a
  tropical glen, where a brawling stream runs in thickets of palm and cactus.
  For Carey's guests it was a prescribed excursion to descend to the Tropics
  some morning, lunch in a summer-house, and make the best of an arduous return
  in the late afternoon. Such an expedition had its charm, for it was a
  stimulating adventure to climb down, as it were, in a few hours through many
  degrees of latitude, and witness in a brief day the scenery of twenty
  climates. But it had also its drawbacks, for in the morning when human energy
  is high the task was easy, and all the difficulties were reserved for that
  unhallowed season when lunch is a memory and tea a distant hope. So mules
  were provided for the women, and with the accompaniment of native muleteers
  and an Arab guide, the party assembled about eleven o'clock at the point
  where the road dipped into an avenue of cool cedars. Mrs Yorke, in a dress of
  delicate green muslin, carried a parasol, and sat her mule with the ease of
  one long at home in Southern places. The others, Marjory Haystoun, Lady
  Flora, and Mrs Deloraine, wore broad-brimmed hats and clothes of some
  serviceable linen stuff. Lady Flora refused to mount her mule, and tramped
  sturdily along with Mr Wakefield and Mr Astbury.</p>

  <p>The garden was a labyrinth of paths, for the most part shadowed with
  trees, but coming suddenly at times to a kind of stage where the travellers
  had a wide prospect of the valley. At first the deep rooty fragrance of pines
  and cedars was all about them. Rhododendrons and azaleas formed the thicket,
  and there were stretches of mossy turf down which little streams fell in
  cascades to the forest below. Except for the greater heat of the sun, which
  the canopy of green scarcely averted, the road might have been a drive in
  some English park. Every now and then came patches of well-known English
  flowers, most of them past their first bloom, though the heath was still a
  gorgeous sheet of colour. Insensibly, however, the place changed to another
  latitude. Now it was some superb Riviera garden, where myrtles and syringas
  and shrubby geraniums crowded on the paths. At one halting place there was a
  parterre of flower-beds bright with a dozen species of canna and lily. A
  stream had been dammed to make a small hanging reservoir, where every variety
  of waterplant blossomed, and ducks of a curious burnished green swam among
  the white petals. Still they descended, and now the vegetation closed in, and
  instead of an avenue the path was a tunnel. Huge trees matted with vines and
  passion-flowers, tall forests of fern, broad-leaved wild bananas, and
  quantities of little palms, made a jungle which it seemed vain to hope to
  penetrate. Insect and bird life, which had been silent above, awoke in these
  regions, and the air was a-flutter with delicate wings. It was very hot, not
  the strong glare of the sun, but the moist warmth of rich vegetable life and
  a too generous earth. Mr Wakefield laboured in his tracks, the ladies on the
  mules ceased to gossip, and even Lady Flora looked flushed and breathless.
  Soon the noise of water rose above the hum of the forest, and suddenly
  through the blue and orange shadows of the trees gleamed the foam of a great
  torrent, as milk-white as any glacier stream. A well-made bridge of logs led
  across, and a few minutes later the party were seated in a little bungalow,
  with a floor of beaten earth, a thatched roof, and a shady verandah.</p>

  <p>The sight of a cool luncheon-table with waiting servants in white tunics
  restored the travellers to comfort. They found a light meal of fruit and cold
  foods, while Mr Wakefield industriously set about the quenching of a very
  respectable thirst. After a while he recovered his composure, and had leisure
  to regard his companions.</p>

  <p>"'If these things be done in the green tree,'" he said, "'what shall be
  done in the dry?' If I am out of breath coming downhill, how on earth am I to
  get up again? I have never understood why an all-wise Providence created the
  Tropics. They are full of noxious animals; their climate embitters life and
  is apt to end it prematurely."</p>

  <p>Astbury, squarely built, fair-haired and ruddy, was also ill fitted for
  violent exercise in hot climates. A noted athlete and a mountaineer of high
  reputation, he could endure extremes of cold and exhaustion and only find his
  energy quickened, but in the Tropics he was apt to lose his restless activity
  and become an idle and good-humoured spectator of life.</p>

  <p>"I want to know the answer to that question, too," he said. "What does the
  white man get from the Tropics? His strenuousness goes out of him, and he
  becomes a heavy-eyed cumberer of the ground. At Musuru I am always thinking
  about reforming the world, while down in this place the world can go to
  pieces for all I care. What do we get from living among palm-trees and
  gorgeous colours in the atmosphere of a Turkish bath?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Mr Wakefield. "The Tropics are a purgatory appointed by
  Heaven for the purging of our immortal souls. They are a sphere of duty in
  which for their sins many honest men are compelled to labour&mdash;nothing
  more!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder if women are more Oriental than men?" it was Marjory who spoke.
  "Because, you know, all this makes me happy. I seem to get the creases out of
  my soul in this hot sun and this glory of flowers. In what people call
  strenuous weather I would much rather stay in bed. But to-day one really
  believes that veins of fire run through the earth, and that nothing is dead,
  not even the rocks. One feels the world so much bigger and fuller and richer
  and more mysterious. Don't you think so, Barbara?"</p>

  <p>Mrs Deloraine, who had been gazing at a huge bouquet of orchids presented
  to her by one of the servants, lifted an abstracted eye.</p>

  <p>"What an intoxication colour is!" she murmured. "Look at these scarlet
  bells and that great purple chalice. I had no idea such depth of richness
  could be found in the world. Our senses are starved in the north, with
  nothing but clean thin scents around us and pale rain-washed greys and blues.
  There is no passion in our Nature, for it is all too well subordinated to the
  needs of man. But here we have a world which has no thought of humanity.
  These scarlet blossoms flame for other than mortal eyes. You cannot think of
  Pan in one of our hazel thickets&mdash;the thought is almost indecent. But I
  can well imagine his slanted eyes looking out from behind that tangle of
  vines."</p>

  <p>"I, too, feel that," said Mrs Yorke. "In the North the life-force in the
  earth is enough for our needs and no more, but here there is a generous
  overflow. I feel as if life were longer and kinder and easier, but also that
  I matter less in the scheme of things than I thought. I am a little
  home-sick, too, for I am a daughter of the South, and the hot air brings back
  my childhood." Mrs Yorke sighed with a tender melancholy.</p>

  <p>"I feel the wickedness more than the kindness," said Mrs Deloraine. "It is
  an unmoral world, this warm-scented place, and there is a shrieking cruelty
  behind the splendour. Natura Maligna and Natura Benigna have walked hand in
  hand in these glens. Look at the flowers! No Wordsworth could read any lesson
  of peace in them."</p>

  <p>Lady Flora arose and examined the bouquet; then, selecting a huge purple
  blossom, she fastened it in Mr Wakefield's coat. She walked a few steps back
  and surveyed her handiwork.</p>

  <p>"I want you to look wicked, Mr Wakefield, but it's quite impossible. You
  only look benevolent and embarrassed. Barbara, you may wear orchids if you
  please, for I think you are the only one of us who could stand them. Letty
  would look a sorceress at once, and Marjory is one without them."</p>

  <p>Astbury had wandered to the door and was looking up the steep slopes of
  greenery they had descended.</p>

  <p>"What a Jack-and-the-Beanstalk business it is, and how little one would
  imagine a place like Musuru atop of it all! I think Miss Haystoun is right,
  and that the Tropics should increase our vitality, but we must be very vital
  beings to begin with. A hot sun or a keen frost will make a strong man
  stronger, but they will kill a weakling. So with the Tropics in my view. An
  eager fellow can live in them for years and be none the worse, but your
  waster dies. That is why a lean sandy-haired Scot is perfectly happy in West
  Africa, while a Portuguese sickens at once, though the one is a Northerner
  and the other a Latin. In my case, the Tropics make me sleepy, and I don't
  mind admitting it. But they also fill me with a vast bovine contentment,
  which I suppose is a kind of condensed and stored vitality. They are the only
  really restful places in the world, for you feel that your life is such a
  speck on the great wheel of things. I remember after the Boer War coming home
  by the East Coast in a cargo-boat and landing at a little port called
  Inhambane. There was a long sweep of white sand, a line of green palms, and a
  lot of whitewashed, green-shuttered, thatched houses in groves of bananas. I
  was rowed up a little river among quiet villages under palm-trees, where the
  people always seemed to be chanting a low, slow Arab song. It was very hot,
  and I lay comfortably in the stern, watching the oily current and the black
  arms of the rowers and the snow-white gown of the steersman and the deep blue
  sky between the feathery tops of the palms. And then I sank for two heavenly
  hours into Nirwana. I had never been to Nirwana before, but now I badly want
  to go back again. In London my working-rooms face on a dingy grey street
  with a mouldy old cab-horse standing at the corner. Sometimes, when I look
  out, that river at Inhambane comes over me so badly that I hardly know what
  to do. For, if you once get the Tropics into your blood, however much you may
  hate 'em and disapprove of 'em, you can't forget 'em. And some day you will
  go back."</p>

  <p>Marjory, swinging lazily in a low wicker chair, announced her agreement.
  "I am of the belief of the old sailor who said nothing was impossible
  'south'ard o' the line.' Your horizon is far wider and you live in touch with
  the great elementary things. Barbara, I am going to repeat some verses you
  once wrote. Listen, everybody:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">'In the ancient orderly places, with a blank and orderly
  mind,<br>
  We sit in our green walled gardens and our corn and oil increase;<br>
  Sunset nor dawn can wake us, for the face of the heavens is kind;<br>
  We light our taper at even and call our comfort peace.<br>
  <br>
  Peaceful our clear horizon, calm as our sheltered days<br>
  Are the lilied meadows we dwell in, the decent highways we tread.<br>
  Duly we make our offerings, but we know not the God we praise,<br>
  For He is the God of the living, but we, His children, are dead.<br>
  <br>
  I will arise and get me beyond this country of dreams,<br>
  Where all is ancient and ordered and hoar with the frost of years,<br>
  To the land where loftier mountains cradle their wilder streams,<br>
  And the fruitful earth is blessed with more bountiful smiles and
  tears,&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  There in the home of the lightnings, where the fear of the Lord is set
  free,<br>
  Where the thunderous midnights fade to the turquoise magic of morn,<br>
  The days of man are a vapour, blown from a shoreless sea,<br>
  A little cloud before sunrise, a cry in the void forlorn&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  I am weary of men and cities and the service of little things,<br>
  Where the flamelike glories of life are shrunk to a candle's ray.<br>
  Smite me, my God, with Thy presence, blind my eyes with Thy wings,<br>
  In the heart of Thy virgin earth show me Thy secret way!'"</p><br>

  <p>The verses were received with a murmur of approval by Mrs Yorke and Mr
  Astbury. Mr Wakefield contented himself with observing that he was glad there
  was some one to say a good word for the Tropics, but that personally he
  should be unhappy till he was back at Musuru. As the afternoon had grown
  cooler a start was made, which was a little delayed by an attempt on the part
  of Lady Flora to explore with her mule a track which led down to the edge of
  the stream. The result was that she could not turn her animal, which had to
  be towed back ignominiously by the whole staff of the bungalow.</p>

  <p>The ascent proved less arduous than had been expected. Mrs Yorke, stricken
  with humanitarian feelings, declined to burden her mule, and in the company
  of Lady Flora walked gallantly up the steepest part, with the face which her
  ancestors may have worn when they rolled the tea-chests into Boston harbour.
  As the air grew colder and pines and cedars reappeared, comfort descended
  once more on the party, and even Mr Wakefield ceased to puff. The scent of
  heath was so homely that the experiences of the day were forgotten, and each
  felt as if the walk had lain through some English wood with a conventional
  country-house to return to. But on emerging on the lawn from the long avenue
  the sudden sight of Musuru brought all to a halt. The glow of sunset was on
  the white walls, and the whole had the airy perfection of a house seen in a
  dream.</p>

  <p>"What a place to stumble upon by accident!" exclaimed Mr Astbury. "Imagine
  a party of hunters who knew nothing about it and believed they were in the
  depths of savagery! Suddenly, climbing this long hill, they come on walks and
  flower-gardens. They think they are going mad, and look down at their dirty,
  torn clothes to reassure themselves. And then they reach the top and come in
  sight of the house. It would take a long time to persuade them that it was
  not an Aladdin's palace."</p>

  <p>"Enter the party," said Lady Flora, pointing to three riders and a
  regiment of boys who had halted at the far side of the lawn. Presently three
  sunburnt men had joined the rest, and were assailed with inquiries, whose
  makers, like Pilate, did not stay for an answer.</p>

  <p>"What sport?" Lady Flora asked Hugh.</p>

  <p>"Good. Fifteen head of buck and two lions. I got one and Akhub the other,
  but I was chivvied by both. And you? Did you find Melissinde?"</p>

  <p>"No. She doesn't live in the valley. We've been all day in the Tropics
  listening to Barbara's poetry. I want to see your lions, and you've got to
  give me a skin. Since you broke our compact you must pay toll, you know."</p>

  <p>It was a milder evening than had yet been enjoyed at Musuru, and after
  dinner the party sat in the inner hall watching a young moon climbing that
  immense arch of sky which is only given by a hill-top prospect.</p>

  <p>"I feel as if I were in a lighthouse," Lady Warcliff said, with an air
  which invited contradiction. "I almost expect to hear the horn of some great
  ship down below in the fog. If only each hot country had been given a
  habitable mountain, they would be the only places in the world to live in. On
  the ordinary upland you dominate the flat country because you are higher up,
  but here we also look down on the plain because we are wholesome and cool and
  sane and they are fevered. We are a lighthouse to the whole of Equatoria, and
  if there were fifty other lighthouses in the Empire there would be no
  tropical problem."</p>

  <p>Lady Flora and Hugh had discovered a small couch out of the area of both
  firelight and lamplight and close to the windows, which were lit from without
  by the pale glimmer of the moon. Here they had a vantage-ground for seeing
  the faces of the others.</p>

  <p>"I do so wish," whispered the girl, "that they wouldn't all talk in
  paragraphs. Either let them chatter in a friendly way or let Mr Carey or Lord
  Appin say all that has got to be said themselves."</p>

  <p>"Hush," said Hugh, for Carey from the fireplace was beginning to
  speak.</p>

  <p>"So far," he said, "we have discussed the relation of Imperialism to
  current politics at home. We have looked, too, at the essential features of
  the new constitution which must some day take the place of the old. And now
  we come to the details of administration, and the first and greatest of these
  problems is that of our tropical dependencies. For whatever the development
  of the free Colonies, they can never share in it. The central executive of
  the Empire will change its character, but it can never change its task. The
  direct responsibility for tropical administration will always rest with it.
  The burden of the Tropics can never be shared with local and responsible
  legislatures; for they can never be wholly settled by the white man, but must
  remain largely in the hands of races for whom autonomy is unthinkable, at any
  rate for the next century or two.</p>

  <p>"If that is so, clearly the Tropics will furnish all the administrative
  problems which are not concerned with the common services of the Empire. The
  work of our imperial executive will be the joint problems of the whole Empire
  plus the day-to-day administration of our tropical dependencies in Asia,
  Africa, and America. This last will be no light business, and must be taken
  seriously. I am not a great believer in the cant of expert knowledge in
  politics. Efficiency is apt to be either a meaningless catchword or a stupid
  worship of professionalism. But our tropical administration must be based on
  expert knowledge, for in our everyday life in Europe we have no experience,
  no inherited body of ideas, which is in any way applicable. It is a thing by
  itself, governed by other rules than those which sway popular government.</p>

  <p>"We have already decided that it will be the test of the capacity of
  democracy for empire if it can accept the abrogation of its claim over some
  part of the territory under its control and trust its servants. I do not
  believe that democracy will be found wanting. The danger, to my mind, is far
  more that its trusted servants may be inadequate to the task. For it is above
  all things work which demands a clear eye and a steady head, and in which
  supineness and pedantry will spell disaster. The great administrative
  questions of the future will be tropical questions. The Tropics will be the
  training-ground of our great officials. It is high time, therefore, that we
  tried to get at some scientific understanding of our responsibilities. If
  expert knowledge and not a mere handful of moral platitudes is to be our
  guide, we must take steps to systematise and develop that knowledge.</p>

  <p>"We are not without precedents. Both France and Germany have set the
  example in founding schools of what they call "colonial science." And four
  centuries ago our own Hakluyt urged something of the same kind. The risk is
  that we allow ourselves to be misled by the case of India, where we have made
  a great success by a kind of accident. We send out raw boys to that service,
  and in a year or two they are efficient administrators. Yes, but the same
  rule will not hold everywhere. India is a long-settled country, which runs by
  herself. We control, amend here and there, give her the benefit of our
  protection, but we do not really interfere. The social machine in its
  essentials is independent of us. It is quite a different matter in lands
  where the fabric of civilisation has to be built up from the beginning. There
  you have no rules to go by, except your own wits; and knowledge is the only
  dividing line between success and failure. We must take up the business very
  seriously, and equip ourselves resolutely for the work. I do not propose to
  weary you with suggestions, for it is no part of our programme to burrow
  among details. But two points I would insist upon. The first is, that we must
  take steps to give our people the best possible training for the work they
  are going to. I want to see imperial colleges established where young men
  will be taught tropical medicine, and surveying, and natural history and
  ethnology, where, in a word, the long experience of the Empire will be
  concentrated into precepts. And the second is, that we must provide for
  reciprocity between the home and the foreign services, so that the man in the
  Colonial or the Foreign Office may have first-hand experience of his own to
  guide him, and the man at the outposts may know the ways of the home office,
  and may keep in touch with home politics. At present the two branches are
  cursed with a confusion of tongues, and speak a different language, though
  they may mean the same thing. A boy who goes into the civil service in
  England would under my scheme go out automatically in five years to a minor
  post in some dependency, and return after some years of service to a higher
  post at home. By this means our governors and our permanent secretaries would
  be of the same class, with the same training, each sympathising with and
  understanding the other's work. There would be some kind of solidarity in
  imperial administration, and when the wheels go smoothly they go faster and
  farther."</p>

  <p>Lord Appin had joined the group at the window, and was gently pinching
  Lady Flora's ear.</p>

  <p>"You know the Tropics, Francis," he said. "I don't suppose there is any
  hot country on earth you haven't been to. Tell me, are they ever going to
  change their character? Will white men and women ever be able to live in them
  in reasonable comfort? Or are they to be a permanent Purgatory to which we
  resort for our souls' good?"</p>

  <p>"We discussed that question at lunch to-day," said Lady Flora. "Mr
  Wakefield said they were merely Purgatory, but most of us thought them more
  like the Garden of Eden. They make Barbara and Letty feel wicked, and Mr
  Astbury sleepy, and they make me very, very thirsty."</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you propose to do with them, Francis?" said Lord Appin
  again. "Are they to be a kind of Botany Bay for penitential souls, or, in
  your own words, are they some day to blossom as the rose?"</p>

  <p>Carey smiled. "I think Alastair and Sir Edward are the best authorities,"
  he said. "We will ask them what they think. My own opinion is, that we can
  improve them all, even the worst parts, up to a certain point. That is to
  say, we can make them habitable by white men and women for a year or two at a
  stretch. But that is not enough to secure continuity in development, and here
  is where the doctrine of the vantage-grounds appears, which Sir Edward was
  explaining to me the other morning. Teddy, expound, please."</p>

  <p>That gentleman rose courageously from a long arm-chair where he had been
  stretching legs wearied with the day's riding. Leaning against the
  mantelpiece, somewhat in the fashion of a giraffe against a palm-tree, he
  embarked on his explanation.</p>

  <p>"I was much struck by what Lady Warcliff said after dinner to-night. She
  wanted a lighthouse like Musuru in every tropical colony, and she said that
  if you had such a thing their problems would be settled. Well, I mean the
  same thing, only I call it a vantage-ground instead of a lighthouse. We
  needn't trouble about the seaside strips of land, because either they are
  swamps and don't matter much, or the sea winds make them fairly healthy. We
  can also leave India out. It is fully developed, and we know exactly how much
  it takes out of the white man to plant him there. What I want to say concerns
  Africa mainly, since it is here that we have the great undeveloped
  speculative dependencies.</p>

  <p>"Let us call our possessions in Africa four&mdash;north, east, west, and
  south. The first gives us Egypt and the Sudan hinterland up to Gondokoro; the
  second is the coast around Mombasa, this plateau, and the trough of
  Equatoria; West Africa is the coast around the Gulf of Guinea and the
  hinterland of Nigeria; South Africa is everything from Lake Nyasa and the
  Congo to the Cape. Now some of these are white men's countries, and in time
  are going to be colonies. Some day we shall have the federation of South
  Africa, and then the lowlands around the Zambesi&mdash;what we call
  North-west and North-east Rhodesia and Nyasaland&mdash;will fall to be
  administered by the federal government. So, also, we shall have the free
  colony of East Africa, with its capital on this plateau, administering the
  lowlands west and east of it. That is one possible development. The other is
  that the colonies occupy only the healthy country and leave the lowlands as
  dependencies under the central executive. It doesn't particularly matter to
  my argument what is going to happen. The point is that wherever you have an
  unhealthy tropical tract you have somewhere in the near neighbourhood a patch
  of white man's country.</p>

  <p>"I expect you can all see a sort of map in your mind. Well, first of all,
  in South Africa we have high veld from the Cape to within a hundred miles of
  the Zambesi, and round the eastern coast we have the line of the Drakensberg
  running from Cape Colony right up to Manicaland, so that we are never far
  from healthy country. In Nyasaland we have the Shire Highlands, and in
  Barotseland we have long stretches of pasture, with bracken and hazels like
  England. I've hunted there, and seen it with my own eyes. In East Africa we
  have this gorgeous plateau as the vantage-ground for the coast strip and for
  Uganda. In North Africa we have Egypt as the vantage-ground for the Sudan. It
  is not an upland, but it is a place where Europeans can live and work happily
  for years. In West Africa we have nothing quite so good. But in a little
  while, when we have railways and better roads, and can house and feed our
  people better, there is no reason why all the Nigerian uplands should not be
  at least as healthy as the better parts of India, if we except the hill
  stations."</p>

  <p>"But the presence of a few wholesome square miles in a territory will not
  prevent people from sickening in the rest," said Mr Wakefield.</p>

  <p>"No, but it will give them a place to rest and recover in. Tropical
  administration must be spasmodic&mdash;we must make up our minds for that.
  But it need not be too spasmodic. If the land is to be properly governed, and
  any policy carried through to a finish, you must have the same officials
  resident in the country for a fair length of time. And, more important still,
  you must see that they retain the mental and bodily vigour which is necessary
  for all good work. Now these vantage-grounds of ours will enable us to secure
  this. By a merciful fate we have been permitted to bag all the most habitable
  parts of Africa. We have the great hot flats, where life is hard, but where,
  if some kind of civilisation is to penetrate, it must be through Englishmen
  who live and work there. And next door we have the health resorts where these
  Englishmen can go when their vitality ebbs and lay in a fresh supply, and
  where the greater administrative problems can be thought out. They will be
  what Simla is to India, the workshop of government. They are near enough to
  be within hail of the lowlands, but they are in another climate, and give a
  tired man the moral and physical tonic he needs."</p>

  <p>"Allah has indeed been merciful," said Lord Appin. "But, my dear Teddy,
  your vantage-grounds will not settle the problem of the Tropics. You have to
  find the race of men who will tolerate your regime of alternate sickness and
  health. The average official will sigh too continually for the fleshpots of
  the vantage-grounds, and instead of carrying back with him to his station a
  fresh supply of force he will carry only an unsettled mind."</p>

  <p>"Maybe. But he will be more unsettled if he has to go home, seedy, every
  eighteen months or so, and can never have his wife and family out. I assume
  that the men will be keen on their job. And this assumption is allowable, for
  the Tropics have a tremendous fascination of their own. It is only the
  loneliness which scares a man. If he had a chance of seeing his kind oftener,
  and keeping more in touch with civilisation, he would have little fault to
  find with his life. I have met scores of them, and a fellow has to be very
  stupid if he does not feel the romance of making a new country. In time he
  gets the place into his bones, and the danger then is not of his losing heart
  in his work, but his losing all interest in home. We must keep both fires
  alight, otherwise we become either like the Portuguese who forgot Portugal,
  or like certain French colonists who remember the boulevards all too
  clearly."</p>

  <p>"I wonder how good a judge you are, Teddy," said Lord Appin. "You like the
  wilds, I know; but is it not rather in the way that the ordinary city man
  tolerates the discomfort of his Scotch shooting-box? He feels a certain
  pleasure in the sensation, because he knows it will not last long. But he
  would be a very sad man if he had to make a lifetime of it. You go off for a
  year or two, and enjoy yourself immensely, but I wonder how much of the
  enjoyment comes from the knowledge that you have always Hill Street and
  Considine Abbey behind you somewhere, awaiting your return?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I shall never make you understand," said Sir Edward dolefully.
  "Best ask Carey."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Francis follows the simple expedient of turning the wilds into
  something much more delectable than England. He has no right to decide."</p>

  <p>"I won't argue," said Carey, "because the point is unarguable. Also Mrs
  Deloraine is going to sing. But I live in hopes of converting Lord Appin to
  barbarism. After all a metaphysician should be an adventurer."</p>

  <p>Mrs Deloraine had gone to the piano and was playing the opening chords of
  a Schumann air. To her Lady Flora fluttered like a moth to a candle, music
  having charms for her which were at no time to be resisted. Lord Appin had
  suddenly discovered a new Louis Quinze cabinet, and was devouring it with the
  keen eye of the collector. Hugh drifted into the nearest drawing-room, where
  he found the Duchess, and was impounded for a game of cribbage, a taste for
  which had always marked the noble house whose name she bore.</p>

  <p>"So far," she said, "the Tropics are the least exhausting subject we have
  discussed. I suppose it is because we are in them and know so much by
  instinct that we can afford to leave most of the platitudes unsaid. I thought
  Francis and Sir Edward talked very good sense. But, you know, they only gave
  us the rudiments of their real opinions. Both of them want to make us all
  have houses on these vantage-grounds, as they call them, and live part of the
  year there, and regard them as much our home as England. Sir Edward preached
  me a long sermon about it last year, just after George had taken a new forest
  in Scotland. He wanted to know why he didn't go farther afield, to some part
  of the Empire, and set a good example. He said that only one profession was
  left for our class&mdash;to be the pioneers of a wider patriotism. I suppose
  he was right. But I am old-fashioned, and I cannot quite imagine myself an
  imperial lady. Till travel becomes easier I would rather stay at home most of
  my time, for running about the world, as Francis does, is wearing to a woman.
  I am middle-aged, and have very little vanity left, but I would rather
  remain as I am. I can see Sir Edward's imperial lady. She will have no
  complexion, her voice will be rather high, and her eyes always a little too
  bright. Not a very comforting creature to live with!"</p>

  <p>"You prefer Lady Considine?" Hugh asked.</p>

  <p>"No, indeed. I don't defend Blanche. Perhaps when we have reached a
  further stage of development women will be able to live up and down the world
  and yet keep their restfulness. But at present the nomad woman is still
  something of an excrescence. She is a 'sport,' outside our normal
  development, and therefore high-coloured and shrill. As for Blanche, she is a
  relic, marooned long ago on a little island of her own. Is she a friend of
  yours, Mr Somerville?"</p>

  <p>"No. She asks me to dinner, but I don't often go, unless Teddy is at home.
  When I talk to her I never know whether to think her a doll or a vast and
  terrible eider-down quilt smothering the universe."</p>

  <p>"And yet, if you had seen her ten years ago, you could not have escaped
  falling in love with her. Everybody did, even George, who is as blind as an
  owl to female beauty. She was the most exquisite girl I have ever seen. With
  her bright hair and melting eyes she floated through a room like a creature
  from another world. No one knew that she was stupid, for her face mesmerised
  everybody, even women. Sir Edward was the great <i>parti</i> of his time, and
  she naturally married him. Happily they are both miracles of good-humour, so
  they put up with each other fairly well. But they haven't an idea or a taste
  in common. She would like him to stay at home and get into the Cabinet, and
  give great parties at Considine, and generally move in the sphere of life
  where she is conscious of shining. He considers that Abana and Pharpar,
  rivers of Damascus, are better than all the waters of Israel. I used to think
  her a fool, but I am not so dogmatic now. She is intensely clever in her own
  way&mdash;an eider-down quilt, as you justly remarked. If Sir Edward were
  not a born Esau she would have smothered him long ago. Her whole life is one
  devout prostration before conventional shrines, with her orthodox opinions,
  her soft downcast eyes, her gentle voice, her elaborate and extravagant
  prettiness. If that marriage was made in heaven, the gods were in a comic
  mood. And yet they love each other after a fashion."</p>

  <p>"Who love each other?" said Lady Flora, bearing down upon the cribbage-
  players like a privateer on harmless merchantmen. "I hope you mean Mr
  Wakefield and me, for I am going to propose to him to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I trust he won't accept you, my dear," said the Duchess, "for he will go
  to prison for bigamy if he does. He is married already&mdash;to an enormous
  American."</p>

  <p>The girl sank upon the couch. "I never loved a dear gazelle," she began,
  when the gazelle in question appeared in the offing.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," said Mr Wakefield, in the tone of a dying gladiator, "we are
  going down to the lake and are going to cross in Carey's steam-launch. We are
  not to be allowed to content ourselves with theorising about the Tropics, but
  are to make practical experiments in them. The only consolation is that we
  shall get our mail at Port Florence. I am charged to say that the outgoing
  post leaves first thing in the morning, and that everybody must have their
  letters ready to-night."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

  <p class="first">ABOUT noon of the following day the party found themselves
  shepherded on board a trim little vessel which lay moored a hundred yards
  from the jetty of Port Florence. Thick awnings warded off the sun; the deck,
  with its white wood and gleaming brass, was as trim as the parlour of a Dutch
  housewife; a light breeze ruffled the blue water and fluttered among the
  feathery palm-leaves on the shore. Steam had been got up, and five minutes
  after embarking they were gliding through the hot shallows to the mouth of
  the bay. The sound of ship's bells and the airy freshness of the deck
  delighted the guests with a mingled sense of homeliness and strangeness. The
  arrival of a large English mail provided abundant occupation for, at any
  rate, the early hours of the voyage.</p>

  <p>The women wore the lightest of gowns and the men were in flannels. Lady
  Warcliff, as the daughter of an admiral, assumed a proprietary air when her
  feet trod a deck, though she was a bad sailor and abhorred the sea. Faithful
  to her duty, she carried off Carey on a tour of inspection, leaving her
  letters at the mercy of any vagrant wind which cared to bear them to the
  fishes of Lake Victoria. The Duchess, in a deckchair, opened her
  correspondence with the rapidity of a conjurer, and distributed fragments of
  information to Lady Flora and Mrs Wilbraham, who, having had small mails,
  were busy with a bundle of home papers.</p>

  <p>"George is in Scotland. He says the weather is dreadful, and that he has
  had nothing from the river but three small grilse. How vexatious! I know
  exactly what will happen. He will get no more, and then he'll spend the whole
  winter doing calculations how many hundreds these grilse cost him a pound....
  Pamela has gone to Ireland with Mary Daventer. Flora, I wonder what mischief
  your mother will do there? She is much too theatrical to be allowed to dabble
  in politics, for she would turn a parish council into a Guy Fawkes
  conspiracy.... Eve Nottingham has written a book, purporting to be the
  letters of a Japanese wife to her English mother-in-law. What will that silly
  woman be after next? She has never been outside Europe, so she picks out
  Japan for her theme. She might as well write the letters of a Coptic
  greengrocer to his Abyssinian grandmother. I suppose it will be the usual
  erotic outpouring, which the newspapers will call 'intimate' and 'poignant,'
  and well-brought-up girls won't be allowed to read.... The Prime Minister has
  made a good speech about either criminal aliens or Jerusalem
  artichokes&mdash;I cannot read Georgiana's writing,&mdash;and Violet Hexham
  is going to marry her chauffeur. Really, English news is very tiresome. How
  glad I am to be in Central Africa instead of at Cowes!"</p>

  <p>Mrs Wilbraham arose with an air of tragedy, sombrely brandishing 'The
  Times.' "A disaster of the first magnitude has befallen the Empire! Sir
  Herbert Jupp has made a speech."</p>

  <p>"Where did the horrid affair take place?" Lord Appin asked.</p>

  <p>"At the annual dinner of the Amalgamated Society of South African
  Operators' Benevolent Fund, when Sir Herbert was the guest of the evening. He
  said&mdash;I quote 'The Times'&mdash;that 'we had suffered too long from the
  tyranny of the foreigner, and that it was high time we began to get a little
  of our own back. The Mother must summon her children around her knees and
  grapple them to her with hooks of steel' (it sounds as if the children were
  going to have a lively time of it). 'Against a united empire,' says Sir
  Herbert, 'no powers of darkness can prevail. We fling back the jealousy and
  hate of the globe in its teeth, content with the affection of our own
  kinsfolk. We have truckled too long before the insolence of Europe. Let the
  Island Race show a haughty front to the world, remembering its God-given
  mission and its immortal destiny. If the Lord be for us who can be against
  us!' What a crusader! I did not think Master Shallow had been a man of this
  mettle!"</p>

  <p>Lady Flora had been reading a Liberal paper. "Here's another man who
  appeals to high Heaven. On Friday, August 2, in the Bermondsey Tabernacle,
  the Reverend Doctor Price-Morgan delivered what this paper calls an 'electric
  appeal, instinct with a certain fine quality.' I see that he describes the
  Empire as a 'blood-stained monument of human folly,' and he calls
  imperialists men 'without conscience, without honour, without patriotism,
  without God.' I hope you recognise your portrait, Sir Edward. 'Let us,' he
  says, 'destroy the accursed thing and return to the old simple paths whence
  we strayed.' Can he mean Elizabethan piracy? He concludes nobly with 'A
  nation without a conscience is like a man groping in the dark on the verge of
  a precipice.' Will somebody explain to me about the Nonconformist
  Conscience?"</p>

  <p>"The Nonconformist Conscience, my dear," said Lord Appin, "is too big a
  thing to be defined casually at mid-day on a tropical lake. It is the name
  which most people give to the particular national failing from which they
  happen to be exempt. Under its shade the militant freethinker and the gentle
  pietist lie down like lambs together. Very often it has nothing to do with
  conscience. Certain people choose to defend certain things in which they
  believe by appealing to morals and religion, when the real reason of their
  belief is something quite different. In these cases it is a mannerism of
  speech rather than of thought. With many it is a condemnation of certain
  gross and robust shortcomings to which they are not inclined, by means of
  which they distract attention from their own less masculine vices of lying,
  dishonesty, and cowardice. With those of a particular religious persuasion it
  can best be described, I think, as the homage which a feeble present pays to
  a strong past. At one time with Nonconformists rested the liberties of
  England, and nobly they fought the battle.</p>

  <p>"Their lives were one long protest against wickedness and folly in high
  places. But the times passed, and our own day of easy tolerance dawned, when
  the only disability which Dissent has to endure is a social one and the worst
  accusation brought against it is vulgarity. But the honest fellows still
  maintain their air of shrill protest and unwearying dissidence. The burning
  wrongs of their forefathers, which were also the wrongs of England, have
  become petty discomforts which it requires an acute mind to discover, but the
  rhetoric is as vivid as ever. The attitude may seem an anachronism and a
  parody, but I prefer to look kindly upon it as a belated concession to
  romance. It is the tribute of the prosperous middle-class, seeking to make
  the best of both worlds, to the grim Ironside and Anabaptist who relinquished
  all to win the Kingdom of Heaven."</p>

  <p>"Why not call it hypocrisy?" said Mrs Wilbraham. "It is precisely the
  quality which makes us the contempt of our European neighbours&mdash;an
  austere creed with a practice limping far in the rear."</p>

  <p>"Because," said Lord Appin, "no summary definition does justice to so
  complex a trait. It is the old desire to make an omelette without breaking
  eggs, and the curious thing is that we can discern in it both a firm
  intention to make the omelette at any cost and a sincere conviction that it
  is infamous to sacrifice a single egg in the process. Were both feelings
  equally strong we should be in a perpetual state of suspended animation. Only
  the inborn practicality of our race puts the weight on the former, and
  so&mdash;under protest&mdash; we advance. Till we learn to think clearly we
  shall always have the conflict between the two, yet till our vitality
  perishes the first will always carry the day."</p>

  <p>Lord Launceston had come aft from watching the shore of the bay through a
  field-glass and had found a seat beside the Duchess.</p>

  <p>"I differ," he said, "in rating most highly the confused moral instinct
  which you condemn. However illogical, however vexatious in its effects, I
  would not for worlds see it disappear from our national life. There may be
  hypocrisy in it, but there is also a tremendous reality. It is a concession
  not so much to tradition as to eternal principles of conduct, and in its
  essence it is not nonconformist but conformist. It is the force of social
  persistence, which counteracts the extravagant flights of our national
  energy. The result is that any new movement is compelled to carry with it
  this heavy ballast before it can succeed, and originality is made safe and
  practical. It is the underlying earnestness of the country, which, because it
  believes enormously in its creed, is conservative and eager to repel
  assaults. England is in consequence slow to convince; but once convinced, she
  moves with unique impetus, just as a strong stream may take longer to divert
  into a new channel than a rill, but when diverted is a far greater force at
  command."</p>

  <p>"What value can there be in the attitude of some canting rascal of an
  employer who grinds down his workpeople and protests piously all the while
  against what he calls 'servile conditions' of labour in some other place?"
  Sir Edward sat on the bulwarks with a broad Panama hat on his head and a
  cigar in his mouth, his air suggestive of anything but nonconformity or
  conscience.</p>

  <p>"No value in the man, who will certainly lose his soul, but much in what
  he stands for. The mere fact that a rogue pretends to a conviction is a sign
  that there is a preponderating majority of honest men who sincerely hold it.
  Cancel all the hypocrisy, and you will still find an immense deal of sound
  moral instinct. I grant you it is often wrong, hopelessly wrong; but the
  instinct is right, it is only the application that is faulty. The remedy is
  to educate and persuade, not to sneer and override. The truth will always
  prevail, if we can only put it with sufficient clearness."</p>

  <p>Lady Amysfort's eyebrows had gone up during these words. "Is Saul also
  among the prophets?" she asked in that cool voice with the tinkle of ice in
  it, which was the despair of her enemies. "I little thought I should live to
  hear Lord Launceston defend Nonconformist ethics. To me the notion that any
  conviction must be respected merely because it happens to be honest is one of
  the many Whig superstitions that have been long ago exploded. Another is that
  you cannot kill a heresy by persecution, but must only encourage it. The
  truth is that you can stamp out a heresy for ever if you persecute it with
  sufficient vigour, provided it has none of the stuff of life in it. And
  equally our business is to ignore utterly convictions, however honest, unless
  they happen to be also intelligent. I am bound to say that in my researches
  in the dark place of Dissent I have rarely found the conjunction."</p>

  <p>Lord Launceston laughed. "You give away your case, Caroline, by admitting
  that the heresy you are going to stamp out must not have the stuff of life in
  it. I agree. Crush out all the trumpery crazes as relentlessly as you please.
  Only beware of a living conviction, for it will be too much for you. I am
  wholly against the childishness that would flatter and cringe before fads
  which should be knocked on the head. All the more reason, therefore, why one
  should be respectful to the things that matter. If you were faithful to your
  Tory principles, you would recognise in this 'conscience' one of the abiding
  instincts of our race, which statesmanship, on your own admission, must
  reckon with. A very good working test, whether a conviction is living or not,
  is the number of people who share it. It is not an infallible rule, but if
  you find any large proportion of reasonable average men holding a view, it is
  worth while taking it seriously. And remember that this much criticised moral
  anxiety is a weapon which may be used on our own side. If your opponent has a
  sharp sword, it is wiser to annex it for your own use than to destroy it. Our
  business is to enlist this moral fervour on behalf of what we regard as truth
  and righteousness."</p>

  <p>The luncheon-bell began to ring as Lord Launceston ceased speaking. As the
  heat of the sun was now very great, the afternoon found the company
  indisposed to exertion, physical or mental, and inclined to long deck-chairs
  in the shade and the lightest of romances. Towards five o'clock, however,
  there was a general awakening when it became clear that the yacht was
  approaching the farther shore. Lady Warcliff sat in the bows with a Zeiss
  glass, staring with eagle eye, like Cortes, at a wooded hill which began to
  loom out of the haze. A crowd of land birds&mdash;flamingoes, cranes, herons,
  and brilliant-backed ducks&mdash;played the part of sea-gulls, and thronged
  around the yacht. Land odours, chiefly the smell of wood-smoke, were drifted
  out to the travellers.</p>

  <p>Carey, who had disappeared all afternoon on some private business, now
  came on deck and stood by the bulwarks looking at the sunset. Hugh joined
  him, and together they watched the riot of crimson and saffron in the sky
  kindle the olive-green forests till the tree-tops glowed like jewels. The
  marshes which fringed the lake were caught up into the pageant and smouldered
  with strange fires of tawny gold.</p>

  <p>Carey drew a long breath. "It is Antony's dream come true," he said. "See,
  there are all the elements&mdash;the fantastic clouds,</p>

  <p class="verse">'The forkéd mountain and blue promontory.'</p>

  <p class="first">Look, now, for you will see the colours wiped clean out of
  the world as the sun dips."</p>

  <p>It happened as he said, for it seemed as if a great curtain were suddenly
  let down upon the landscape. The light and colour ran out of the foreground.
  Soon the waters were dull grey, though the forests still burned. Then the
  forests were quenched, though the highest trees had gold crowns and the far
  ridge of hills. These faded in turn, and in a grey world the yacht came to
  her moorings in the little bay of Entoro. The dinghies were lowered and the
  company went ashore.</p>

  <p>They were met on the beach by the whole population of the place, led by a
  tall oldish man with grey whiskers, whom Carey introduced as the Reverend
  Alexander Macdowall, in charge of the Scotch Mission. He led them to a low,
  white, barrack-like building, which was an appendage to the mission-house,
  and which Carey used as a lodge on the occasion of his visits. It was found
  to be severely but comfortably furnished, and the yacht's servants having
  brought up plate and linen and some of the minor comforts of civilisation,
  the company were soon installed in quarters which might be regarded as
  luxurious in any tropical town. The mosquito-nets and the absence of
  fireplaces spoke of a climate very different to Musuru: but the night, as it
  chanced, was not unduly warm. Save for the humming of insects and that faint
  musty smell which is inseparable from houses on which for most of the year
  the sun beats hotly, the dinner, cooked by the yacht's servants, might have
  been served in some old-fashioned Scotch shooting-box.</p>

  <p>To the meal came Mr Macdowall, splendidly habited in an antique suit of
  broadcloth. His weathered face, his sharp and kindly blue eyes set in a maze
  of wrinkles, and his spare, straight figure made up a picture which took the
  eye as something clean-cut and virile. His manner had the spacious ease which
  the wilds give to those who are not enslaved by them. He called Carey
  "Francis," and adopted the company at once into the circle of his
  friendship.</p>

  <p>"I come from your own countryside, Lord Appin," he said, in answer to a
  question; "I have not been back for ten years, and I question if I could
  return. I have made my own place here, and I could not endure interference
  very readily again. I daresay at home I should even be falling out with the
  police. Besides, there's no need to go back. I have no near relations, and
  the thing I most cared for in Scotland was the fishing. But I can get that
  here now, and I'm quite content."</p>

  <p>"What was the place like when you came?" Hugh asked.</p>

  <p>"A den of cut-throats," said the missionary. "Tribe warring against tribe,
  the land raided by Arab slave-dealers, and no man knowing when he woke in the
  morning if he should see another. I lived through three massacres of
  Christians and half-a-dozen native wars, and by-and-by the place settled
  down. England began to hear about the lakes, and we had travellers and
  hunters visiting us, and things began to get a little better. Our work had
  been much blessed&mdash;not in the ordinary sense, ye understand, for there
  were few converts of the real sort, but we had driven some habits of industry
  and decency into the people. It was a hard life in those days, for we had
  little but native food, and our medicines often ran short. I had a good deal
  of black-water fever, and several times I was nearly dead with it. I remember
  all those days I could not get the thought of the Ochils out of my
  head&mdash;yon fine, green, clean country with a well-head in every howe. Out
  on the knoll where I had my hut I could see on clear days the long blue line
  of the Mau, where Musuru stands now. It used to comfort me to look at it. I
  knew there was a cool blessed country up there, and many a time I said over
  the psalm to myself, 'I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence
  cometh my help.' I was convinced that the regeneration of this place could
  only come from the heights."</p>

  <p>"And did it?" some one asked.</p>

  <p>"To be sure. Francis came, and at last we had a man in this feckless
  country. I am not going to bring the blushes to the cheek of my old friend,
  but you will believe me when I tell you that he put new life into the whole
  land. All the industries here are his starting. He has more influence among
  natives than any man since Livingstone. And then he has Musuru, that city set
  upon a hill-top, to which we can all go for advice and rest."</p>

  <p>"The rainbow trout will be ready for you next month," said Carey.</p>

  <p>"I'll be there," said the old man, chuckling. "This is Central Africa. And
  yet in two days I can get up to a Scotch glen, with bracken to catch your
  flies in, and I can get as good trout out of the pools with a black hackle as
  ever I got in the Devon. It is all the refreshment I ask for. Give me a day
  now and then with my rod, and I'm prepared to bide in this vineyard till my
  call comes."</p>

  <p>Now it chanced that nearest Mr Wakefield's heart lay a passion for fly-
  fishing, and when the meal was over he claimed Mr Macdowall for a highly
  technical conversation. The party broke into groups: two rubbers of bridge
  were organised, and the others wandered into the verandah, beneath which the
  lake gleamed faintly under a young moon. Marjory Haystoun, fired with a
  sudden zeal for adventure, started with Mrs Wilbraham for the shore,
  regardless of a heavy dew and the thinness of her evening shoes; but the pair
  were summarily recalled by Mr Astbury, who spoke darkly of fever. By-and-by
  the bridge ended, and Mr Macdowall, tearing himself from a discourse on
  tiger-fish, made his farewells.</p>

  <p>"I've done what you told me, Francis," he said to Carey. "The chiefs will
  come in early in the morning, and you can hold your palaver with them after
  breakfast. The white folk will be at the kirk at eleven to hear what you have
  got to say. I daresay I'm breaking my ordination vows&mdash;resigning my
  pulpit to a notorious heretic like you, but a little heresy once in a way
  does the world good. It's like an artificial flee, and excites the appetite
  if it does not satisfy the hunger."</p>

  <p>The Duchess, who was a pillar of the Establishment, was relieved to learn
  next morning at breakfast that the whole party proposed to attend church, but
  she was a little dismayed to hear that the service was to consist of an
  address from their host. Her dismay was not lessened by the discovery that it
  was to be preceded by a gathering of native chiefs to present their respects
  to Carey.</p>

  <p>"Surely it is scarcely work for a Sunday morning," she complained. "I
  dislike mixing up politics and religion. Besides, Francis is not in orders,
  he is not even a lay reader, and I know that he holds the most terrible
  opinions about the bishops. One of them told me that he always felt that
  Francis might pat him on the head if he said anything he agreed with, and
  tell him he was a good boy. I am not in the least afraid of natives, but I
  object to sit in the midst of a circle of hundreds. I shall feel too like an
  early Christian."</p>

  <p>"Some time ago, Susan," said Carey, "I believe you occupied a conspicuous
  position on a platform at the Albert Hall. You were then in the midst of a
  circle not of hundreds but of thousands, and you showed no anxiety. You will
  find very little difference in the spectators to-day except that they have
  better manners, and are on the whole better to look at. I ought to say,
  however, that they will all be armed. I will not have these people meet me
  except as free men, and in this country it is the badge of a free man to
  carry spear and shield."</p>

  <p>The ordeal turned out to be of the mildest kind. The party were conducted
  to a spot a few hundred yards from the beach, where they found a semicircle
  of black warriors gathered around a little green hill. The chiefs stood to
  attention as they approached, and saluted in silence. But when Carey, who
  came a little later, ascended the mound he was greeted with a shout of
  welcome and a raising of spear-points skywards, which made the women shiver
  and flushed Lady Flora's cheek with excitement.</p>

  <p>"That is the royal salute," Hugh whispered. "I wonder how many tribes in
  the continent give him that. He once told me he thought he had over thirty
  native names, and they are all flattering."</p>

  <p>Carey sat down on a tree trunk, and the spokesman of the chiefs approached
  him. In the main he spoke their own tongue, but for those who used a special
  dialect he had a boy from the Mission to interpret. So far as the party could
  follow, the discussion was mainly about crops and stock diseases. There was
  some talk of a tribal disturbance on the western border, and once when a
  decision seemed to be questioned, Carey's slow, quiet tones changed to a
  sharp command, and the watchers saw his mouth harden. Sitting there among his
  own people, his massive figure and brooding face had a superb air of
  authority. All the men&mdash;Wakefield, Lord Appin, Lord Launceston, even Sir
  Edward&mdash;seemed to shrivel in the contrast, like beings out of their
  proper sphere.</p>

  <p>"I never realised before how handsome he was," Lady Flora said to Hugh.
  "He came to dine with us in London in July, and I remember thinking that his
  clothes did not fit and that he carried himself badly. I could not help
  comparing him with a colonel in the Guards, who was also dining and who had
  the most beautiful straight figure. But out here he looks like a king. No one
  could be afraid of my Guardsman, but I cannot imagine any one disobeying Mr
  Carey. It is that massive head of his which overawes one like a
  mountain."</p>

  <p>The business did not take long. Carey spoke a few final words slowly and
  impressively in a native tongue, there was a low murmur of applause, and the
  <i>indaba</i> was over. The party walked back silently to the mission-house,
  where they found the whole population of the settlement assembling. Besides
  the Mission staff there were a number of teachers from the industrial school,
  a contingent of local traders and planters, and a few Government officials.
  Carey knew every one by name, and was full of kindly inquiries. Most of them
  had been his guests at Musuru, and his greetings were those of a popular
  country squire with his neighbours at meet or market.</p>

  <p>The little whitewashed mission church was filled to overflowing. The
  Duchess had rarely in her life felt at a loss, but the air of the gathering
  made her nervous. There was a Sabbatical hush in the audience, which
  suggested a religious service, but none of the accessories of church were
  present. Mr Macdowall entered and sat down on the chair commonly reserved for
  the choirmaster, where he proceeded to take snuff and gaze at the audience
  through benevolent spectacles. Then came Carey, who ascended the small
  pulpit, cleared away a Bible and a water-bottle which stood on the
  book-board, and, standing erect with his hands in his pockets, thus addressed
  his hearers&mdash;</p>

  <p>"This is not a service, so we need waste no time in preliminaries. I have
  asked you to come here to-day because I wanted to meet you face to face and
  say certain things to you. We are all fellow-workers in one cause, though we
  call it by different names. I am older than most of you, and I have had a
  wider experience than most of you, so my views on the things which most
  deeply concern you may possibly be of some little assistance. I am not going
  to talk to you about theology, but what I have to say is vitally concerned
  with religion. Whatever our creeds&mdash;and I daresay Macdowall would
  scarcely credit me with any&mdash;we are all serious men, and in our various
  ways, as far as our imperfect light allows, we may claim to be seeking the
  kingdom of God and His righteousness."</p>

  <p>"Ye're mistaken, Francis," Mr Macdowall interrupted; "ye're lamentably
  unsound in the faith, but I never denied that ye were a profoundly religious
  man."</p>

  <p>Carey's face relaxed into a smile. "Well, then, I will take advantage of
  this testimonial, and talk to you in this church about secular things. Every
  country and every group of men have some special problem of their own. They
  have dozens of problems, of course, but there is always one which may be
  considered the centre of gravity, and on this it is their business to
  concentrate their attention, for on its settlement depends the settlement of
  all the others. Your business, on which everything else depends, is the wise
  management of the native peoples that live round about you. For every white
  man there are forty or fifty natives, and yet in your hands lies the
  administration and on your head is the responsibility for the future of the
  country. You have to fight against ignorance, stupidity, and barbarism. So
  has all the world; but you have the tremendous advantage that you have your
  foes in concrete shape before your eyes and know exactly what you have to get
  to grips with. In England we have the same enemies, but we cannot see them,
  and we have first of all to go and hunt for them; and there is a perpetual
  difference of opinion as to which is which&mdash;some calling ignorance
  honesty and stupidity wisdom. You are spared all this fuss. You know what
  brutality is and what decency is. You have got to convert the one into the
  other.</p>

  <p>"I am going to talk to you to-day about the two extremes we have to avoid.
  The first is the danger of underrating the status of the black man, and the
  second is the still greater danger of overrating it. As to the first, I know
  that most of you feel strongly about certain recent changes which have been
  made in the criminal law. Well, I was largely responsible for these changes,
  and I am here to defend and explain them. You argue, some of you, that the
  native is a child and must be treated as a child and punished at the
  discretion of his master, who stands to him <i>in loco parentis</i>. You
  maintain that to make native discipline depend upon the cumbersome machinery
  of a court of law is to make it a farce. Who, you ask, when his servant
  offends will be at the pains to take him before a magistrate? He will either
  take the law into his own hands, which will be bad for the discipline of the
  State, or he will let the matter pass, which will ruin the discipline of his
  household. That may be so, but if he follows the latter course he will have
  only himself to thank, and if he follows the first he will be punished. And
  the reason is that we dare not underrate the status of the native. You may
  repeat that he is a child, but the law must look upon him not as a potential
  but as an actual citizen, and must give him the dignity of such. He must
  stand before it as an equal with the white man&mdash;not a social equal or a
  political equal, but a legal equal. It is the State and not the individual
  that has the main interest in his development, and therefore to the State
  must be left the responsibility. To place it with the private citizen is to
  give him a burden more heavy than he can bear, and to expose him to those
  temptations towards brutality and injustice and caprice which may end in his
  own degradation. The State rightly refuses to allow such risks. With it rests
  the sole duty of punishment. But&mdash;and here I speak to practical men who
  will not, I think, misunderstand me&mdash;what after all is the meaning of
  law? It is the norm of conduct framed to suit average circumstances. A man
  must comply with it or pay the penalty, but sometimes it may be right to pay
  the penalty and break it. I may prevent a man in a public street from doing
  something disgraceful but not criminal, and I may be guilty of assault in the
  process. I am justified in breaking the law, and the law is right in fining
  me. There are a thousand conceivable cases when legal docility is a moral
  disgrace or a practical folly. Every man must have clearly before him his
  duty as a citizen. If he breaks the law he must be clear that his warrant is
  sound both as regards his own conscience and the State to which he owes
  obedience. Especially is this the case with the new law as to the rights of
  natives. It does not prevent a white man in emergencies from making a law for
  himself, but by its prohibition it compels him to be very certain about his
  justification. It will, I trust, put an end to caprice and encourage fair
  dealing, for he who breaks it can only appeal to the last and most rigorous
  of tribunals.</p>

  <p>"The second danger is that you conceive of the native status as higher
  than it really is. This fault will be committed by the idealists among you,
  as the other will be the error of the practical man. And yet I have often
  found idealists and practical men alike doing homage to what I can only think
  is a false conception of native development. The native's mind is sharp and
  quick, his memory is often prodigious, and he has histrionic and mimetic
  gifts which may mislead his teachers. But for all that he stands at a
  different end of the scale of development from the white man. He represents
  the first stage of humanity, and he has to travel a long way before he can
  reach that level which we roughly call our civilisation. You cannot
  annihilate ten strenuous centuries by assuming that they have not existed,
  and inviting the native to crowd the work of them into a year or two. Between
  his mind at its highest and ours at its lowest there is a great gulf fixed,
  which is not to be crossed by taking thought. It is less a difference in
  powers&mdash;for he has powers as remarkable often as our own&mdash;as in
  mental atmosphere, the conditions under which his mind works, and
  consequently the axioms of his thought. He will learn gladly what we have to
  teach him, and you will imagine that the lesson of civilisation has been
  learned, when suddenly you are pulled up by some piece of colossal
  childishness which shows that that mind whose docility you have admired has
  been moving all the time in a world a thousand years distant from your own.
  We must recognise this gulf and frame our education accordingly. At bottom,
  and for obvious reasons, the native mind is grossly materialistic. The higher
  virtues and what we call "spirituality" are radically unintelligible to it,
  though it may learn to claim them and to talk their jargon. We must begin,
  therefore, with the first things, if we do not wish to get a dishonest
  parrot-like adherence to creeds which are not understood and have no power
  to influence life. I think there is more need for imagination and insight and
  foresight in a missionary among the black races than in most statesmen, for
  he has to study a mind and character most alien to our own and select from
  the vast storehouse of our civilisation the kind of nourishment suited to
  it.</p>

  <p>"Remember that education is a thing which must take its colour from the
  needs that it is provided to satisfy. Your business is to inculcate in the
  native mind the elements of citizenship and Christian morality. It can only
  be done by degrees, but for heaven's sake begin with the truths that matter,
  and never mind the frillings for the moment. Get your foundations laid deep
  and solid. Preach the Atonement and the Fatherhood of God, and leave out your
  fancy dogmas. Teach the children to read and write, but do not aim at higher
  education, for that means black parsons and black schoolmasters, and for that
  class the market is overstocked, and they are outcasts from the society of
  those whom they would claim as intellectual equals. Above all things teach
  them trades and handicrafts and the simple laws of a decent life. It is not
  our business, as I keep telling my friends, to create a new heaven but to
  create a new earth. Get these strange, sullen, childish, dark-skinned people
  hammered into a peaceable and prosperous society, and you have laid the
  foundation of all the virtues. Teach them the elements of cleanliness and
  comfort and you will find them already grounded in honesty and loyalty; and
  you may soon get them to take their place in our complex system,&mdash;low
  down, of course,&mdash;but still indubitably within it. Don't try and make
  out of them theologians or schoolmasters or bagmen or electioneering humbugs.
  Leave the scum of civilisation for civilisation to deal with. You have still,
  thank Heaven! a simple community: keep it simple so long as you can, for it
  is on simple lines alone that it can make true progress.</p>

  <p>"You may say that I offer you, merchants, planters, teachers, all of you,
  a gloomy programme. We are to civilise the land, you will say, by slow
  methods, and we shall be dead and buried long before the results come. Your
  complaint would be just if your only task were native administration. But it
  is not. You have the economic and political development of the land to think
  of, and you have your own future, for there is a white community growing up
  beside the black. And remember that the presence of the native races makes
  every man of you an administrator. If you face your duty, every white citizen
  will have the training of a proconsul, the same kind of problems to solve,
  the same qualities of character in demand. That is no small honour. What kind
  of race will your sons be if they grow up with the sense of civic duty alive
  in them, content to work slowly because hopefully and long-sightedly? I am
  one of the men who believe in the regeneration of the African continent. When
  the world has preached its lessons to her, she will also have something to
  say to the world. I do not think that the battles and the bloodshed, the
  young men who never came back, the lonely graves in the desert, the hopes
  crushed only to revive again&mdash;I do not think that these will have been
  in vain. Do you remember one of Pitt's perorations when that austere
  statesman gave rein to his fancy and delivered a prophecy whose justification
  you and I still await? I commend its rhetoric to you as a watchword. 'If we
  listen,' he said, 'to the voice of reason and duty, and pursue the line of
  conduct which they prescribe, some of us may live to see the reverse of that
  picture, from which we now turn our eyes with shame and regret. We may live
  to behold the nations of Africa engaged in the calm occupations of industry,
  in the pursuits of a just and legitimate commerce. We may behold the beams of
  science and philosophy breaking in upon this land, which at some happy period
  in still later times may blaze with full lustre, and, joining their influence
  to that of pure religion, may illuminate and invigorate the most distant
  extremities of that immense continent. Then may we hope that even Africa,
  though last of all the quarters of the globe, shall enjoy at length in the
  evening of her days those blessings which have descended so plentifully upon
  us in a much earlier period of the world. Then also will Europe,
  participating in her improvement and prosperity, receive an ample recompense
  for the tardy kindness&mdash;if kindness it can be called&mdash;of no longer
  hindering that continent from extricating herself out of the darkness, which
  in other more fortunate regions has been so much more speedily dispelled.</p>

  <p>Late in the afternoon, as the yacht was once again slipping through violet
  waters, and tea was being served on deck, the Duchess found herself beside Mr
  Wakefield.</p>

  <p>"Francis is the oddest speaker of my acquaintance," she said. "It is such
  a mixture of straightforward prose and ambiguous poetry. And yet there is an
  art in it. You saw how he impressed these people. My brother might have
  spoken like an angel for hours without anything like the effect that Francis
  had with a few abrupt sentences. It is the man that does it. His figure, with
  his hands in pockets, has such a power about it, and such a past behind it,
  that people listen not so much to what his voice says as to his
  presence."</p>

  <p>Mr Wakefield looked back to where the forests and blue mountains of Entoro
  were growing faint in the evening haze. "On the second day of my visit," he
  said slowly, "I objected to the 'man of destiny.' I withdraw that objection
  now. The thing may be undemocratic, illiberal, and reactionary&mdash;I do not
  care a penny whistle if it is. It is the only power which can plant
  civilisation in the wilds and turn savages into orderly citizens. Our
  democracy is excellent in its way, but it can't do that sort of
  thing&mdash;you want the individual with his heart on fire to start the ball.
  You want faith and hope, and men have these things but not departments or
  nations. So much do I value the man of destiny now that I will describe him
  in the words of a writer I detest,&mdash;he is 'the Cyclopean architect, the
  road-maker of Humanity!'"</p>

  <p class="first">AT dinner the following evening Carey announced that the
  subject for discussion that night was economic. A profound gloom fell on the
  company.</p>

  <p>"I hate the word," said the Duchess. "When any one proposes some generous
  scheme the immediate answer is that it is 'uneconomic.' I believe that the
  whole thing is a false science, invented by the trading classes to conceal
  their own rapacity. They identify their penny-wise cunning with the laws of
  nature and claim a divine sanction for their misdeeds. Besides, I am sick of
  the kind of argument we have heard so much of for the past two years. To my
  mind even the few economic laws which are certain may very properly be
  overridden for the sake of higher interests. You tell me that Protection is
  good or bad economics, and I don't care a fig. I want to know if it is good
  or bad policy."</p>

  <p>Lord Appin raised his eyebrows. "My dear Susan, do my ears deceive me?
  What you say is excellent Tory doctrine, which I have been industriously
  preaching for many years. Carey, living with you is turning all our heads.
  You have made Susan a Tory and Launceston a Dissenter."</p>

  <p>"I am not going to ask you to talk Benthamite economics," said Carey,
  "though there is a great deal to be said for them. All I want you to do is to
  look at the eternal problem which you find in all States&mdash;riches and
  poverty, the use and control of the one and the cure of the other. It is an
  immense subject, and if we once get among facts and figures we shall be in a
  hopeless morass. At the same time there are general principles here as
  elsewhere, and I think it is possible to disentangle a few of them. To show
  fully how the recognition of the possibilities of empire will affect capital
  and labour would take a man's lifetime. But I think we can say roughly what
  the general line of the answer will be. I promise you, Susan, you shall not
  hear a word of orthodox jargon, for the excellent reason that none of us know
  any, except Lord Appin, and he doesn't believe in it."</p>

  <p>Lord Appin protested vigorously. "As an ex-president of a learned society
  which concerns itself with nothing else, I claim complete economic orthodoxy.
  My objection to the science is that it tends to approximate in its methods to
  theology. Its votaries are apt to make laws of Sinai out of deductions from
  the commerce of a single epoch, forgetting to distinguish between what is
  sufficiently axiomatic to constitute a general law and what is only true
  under special and terminable conditions. Indeed, my chief complaint against
  the science is that it is too loose rather than too formal. My other
  complaint is that it mistakes its vocation. It starts from highly abstract
  data and builds up on them a structure of ingenious puzzles. It erects into a
  <i>Realphilosophie</i> what is purely formal, and, forgetting the abstraction
  of its starting-point, it imagines that it has provided a philosophy of life.
  A few elementary lessons in the art of definition would make the toil of
  economists of some use. As it is, they spend much of their time in the
  agreeable intellectual pastime of spinning cocoons. You may say, so does the
  metaphysician. But he is dealing with tremendous verities. And however
  fallacious, however over-subtle he may be, the magnitude of his task ennobles
  him. I cannot find the same elevation in tracking the vagaries of that quaint
  fiction the 'economic man.'"</p>

  <p>As if to secure some cheerfulness for a dull discussion the party
  assembled after dinner in the Blue Drawing-room, which of all the rooms at
  Musuru was the most exquisite in its decorations. Its fluted white walls were
  set with panels of old turquoise-blue silk; the ceiling was modelled on that
  of a famous chamber at Versailles; the carpet was of rich white velvet pile;
  the furniture was all copied from a boudoir of Marie Antoinette. The books in
  the cabinets and on the tables were bound in vellum or blue morocco, and the
  few ornaments were of blue Sèvres ware or old ivory. The one picture, which
  hung over the chimney, was a Watteau of blue-robed nymphs dancing under a
  great expanse of spring sky. The lamps had shades of ivory silk, and in the
  soft light the pure colours swam in a delicate harmony as of a summer noon.
  The scene was so strange and perfect that most of the guests gave an
  involuntary gasp of admiration. Even Mr Wakefield snorted when he entered,
  and subjected the Watteau to the tribute of a long and critical stare.</p>

  <p>"We are told," said Carey, "that the Empire is the dream of capitalism,
  and like every falsehood the saying contains the perversion of a truth. Large
  schemes over a large area require money and an elaborate organisation.
  Imperialism involves such schemes; therefore Imperialism demands wealth and
  organisation. That is our simple syllogism. Imperialism is not capitalism,
  but it is akin to it in method. The capitalist makes his fortune by
  recognising the value of combination and the wisdom of earning profits over
  the largest area possible. Imperialism depends likewise upon a form of
  combination. Both believe that Providence is on the side of the bigger social
  battalions.</p>

  <p>"This, of course, is a truism. The difficulty arises when the imperialist
  State and the capitalist citizen come into conflict. Both have admittedly the
  same methods. Moreover, the great capitalist schemes must be semi-political,
  so the standpoint of pure individualism cannot be maintained. Our question
  therefore is, What is to be the relation of an imperial State to the rich
  citizen; and how far can the State imitate his activity on its own account?
  Or, to put it simply, admitting that combination and capital are necessary to
  any empire for imperial purposes, is the State in pursuit of such purposes to
  supervise or to supersede the individual?</p>

  <p>"We are on the brink, you see, of the tremendous question of Socialism or
  Individualism, and you will be relieved to hear that I shall not embark on
  that wintry sea. I am afraid I cannot take the opposition of the two terms
  seriously. Like Protection and Free Trade, they are methods, not ideals:
  curative measures, not forms of diet. To declare for one or the other is as
  if anglers were passionately to take sides in the question of dry-fly against
  wet-fly. To say whether the Empire in the future will be socialist or
  individualist requires the gift not of reasoning but of prophecy, for to
  dogmatise on the character of its development you must foretell the
  circumstances which may control it. My own view is that we shall see the
  State become increasingly more concerned with matters which our forefathers
  left to private enterprise. Partly it will be the result of that new view of
  the State as something intimately and organically related to the private life
  of its citizens: partly it will be the result simply of our greater
  geographical area. Things which were once well within the scope of the
  individual now require an organisation so vast and complex that only the
  State can provide it, or, if the individual can compass it, he becomes a
  public menace. I can face with equanimity the day when our great shipping
  lines, our railways, our cable systems, even our mines, will be State-owned,
  but before that day can come the State must have learned more in the way of
  administration than it knows at present.</p>

  <p>"At the same time, I cannot conceive that the day will ever dawn when the
  private capitalist can be wholly or even largely superseded. For many
  activities you will always want the quickening of the individual brain and
  will. Here I differ from my socialist friends, and I differ from them only
  because I am less of an idealist than they are. I do not think that men will
  ever spend themselves with the same fervour on behalf of a remote entity
  called the State as they will on their own private adventures. You may have
  the most admirable and conscientious officials, but they will be uninspired.
  They will administer, but rarely originate. In any case, any complete
  State-socialism is impossible to our Empire. I can picture it working well in
  a small neutralised State with no mysteries in her future. But what possible
  State organisation is capable of dealing with the whole life of a vast
  complex of States in all the latitudes of the globe?"</p>

  <p>"The socialist would answer," said Hugh, "that if empire does not admit of
  his creed, then so much the worse for empire."</p>

  <p>"He might," said Carey, "but I do not think he will, if he is given to
  thinking seriously about the question. I have never found his class a
  reactionary one. But if he does, then I say in turn, so much the worse for
  socialism. For of the two creeds there can be no question which is the
  stronger. The one is a method, a particular theory of administration; the
  other is an ideal, a gospel of a fuller national life. Few people, I think,
  will be prepared on behalf of a speculation as to the best mode of government
  to give up the task of government altogether&mdash;which is what the demand
  would be.</p>

  <p>"However, I am not concerned to prophesy, and sufficient for the day is
  the evil thereof. I assume that the private capitalist will not be unknown in
  the future, that the State cannot wholly supersede him. Is it, then, to
  supervise him? Remember that the great fortunes of the future will not be
  made by old methods. Their makers will be no longer object-lessons in the
  wisdom of Benjamin Franklin's maxims. The millionaire of the future will be a
  statesman. He will administer affairs as complex and vast as the politics of
  a small nation. I am myself only a beginner, but politics in some form or
  other enter into every detail of my business. The great capitalist will have
  imagination and courage and foresight beyond most men.</p>

  <p>"Now, there is to my mind a very great danger in the appearance of a class
  of men of the first order in ability and force of character, and with immense
  power at their command, and the whole outside the State. It is a government
  within a government, private citizens who in effect have governing powers. I
  merely point out the danger, for I have no remedy prepared. We must recognise
  that empire will extend the sphere of the great capitalist, and take measures
  accordingly. If I were sketching out a Utopia, it would, of course, be easy
  to fix a limit beyond which private fortunes should not go. We should allow
  our capitalist his energy but not his profits. He would be a tame
  revenue-earning machine for the State, making millions and receiving a few
  thousands as pocket-money. But I confess I can see no scheme which, as the
  world stands, would prevent the danger and yet not put an end to the fact of
  capitalism, and, since I believe that fact to be desirable on public grounds,
  I am not prepared for any heroic remedy.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing to be said, however, which may give us hope. The
  capitalist of the future, we agreed, will not be the ordinary dull rich man.
  He will either be a great criminal or a considerable patriot. If he is the
  first I hope that the law may be strong enough to keep him in bounds, but if
  he is the latter he may be a great ally of the State. The millionaire who
  makes money solely to spend it on his pleasures is a cumberer of the ground.
  I do not care whether his pleasures are gross or refined, he is in any case a
  cumberer of the ground. But the man who with such a narrow soul will make a
  great fortune in the future will be rare indeed. He may make a million by
  rigging the market, but he will do little good at that serious exploitation
  which is closely akin to statecraft. It is only the latter which concerns us,
  for it is only if the latter falls into the hands of the fool or the knave
  that the political danger I dread will appear. Remember, I am talking of
  exploitation and of new production, not of the mere control of distribution,
  which is the object of the ordinary Transatlantic trust, for it is in the
  first kind of activity only that empire and capital come into close relation.
  The men who will succeed, I hope, will be those who find themselves capable
  of only spending a portion of their fortune on themselves and who have no
  desire to ruin their families by hoarding it for them. They will find their
  hobby not in rare furniture or on the Turf, but in doing, so far as the
  individual can, the work of the State."</p>

  <p>Carey spoke these last words with a smile, looking towards Lord Appin. The
  shaft, however, failed of effect, for, as it chanced, Lord Appin's gaze was
  occupied with a beautiful cabinet, inlaid with agate and ivory. He looked up,
  caught Carey's eye, and looked again at the inestimable treasure. "No,
  Francis," he said sadly, "it is very clear that neither you nor I can live at
  that austere height. I hope you will spare the poor fellows some foible to
  keep them from the ennui of unvarying altruism."</p>

  <p>"I am not very much concerned with the capitalist," said the Duchess. "I
  am much more anxious about labour. Mr Lowenstein, you once spoke at my
  Plaistow settlement on the subject. I wish you would say again what you told
  us then."</p>

  <p>Mr Lowenstein was so frail in constitution that even the tonic air of
  Musuru had failed to give him complete health. His nervous activity made him
  the prey of headaches, and at the earlier discussions he had sat silent and
  miserable. For some reason, however, the trip to Entoro had done him good,
  and to-night he was in the best of spirits.</p>

  <p>"What I have to say," he began, "can be put very shortly. And it has been
  put in far better words than I can command."</p>

  <p>He opened a slim, well-worn book, that looked a very shabby intruder among
  the superb bindings around him.</p>

  <p>"People say that Ruskin is not read now and that his day is over. I think
  Mrs Deloraine told me that he had done more than any other man to
  Corinthianise English prose. That may be true, but he was the first writer
  under whose charm I fell, and I cannot forget my early love for him. And he
  happens to say in one passage exactly what I wish to say to-night. It is in
  'The Crown of Wild Olive,'* where he is speaking of the future of
  England.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* § 159.</p>

  <p class="quote">'Are her dominions in the world so narrow,' he asks, 'that
  she can find no place to spin cotton in but Yorkshire? We may organise
  emigration into an infinite power. We may assemble troops of the more
  adventurous and ambitious of our youths, we may send them on truest foreign
  service, founding new seats of authority and centres of thought in
  uncultivated and unconquered lands; retaining the full affection to our
  native country no less in our colonists than in our armies, teaching them to
  maintain allegiance to their fatherland in labour no less than in battle;
  aiding them with free land in the prosecution of discovery, and the victory
  over adverse natural powers; establishing seats of every manufacture in the
  climates and places best fitted for it, and bringing ourselves into due
  alliance and harmony of skill with the dexterities of every race and the
  wisdom of every tradition and every tongue.'</p><br>

  <p>These words seem to me to contain the truth about our social problem.
  England is too old a civilisation, and her natural productive forces have
  been exploited to the full. We have a vast industrial system which absorbs
  our energies, and since we have put all our eggs into the industrial basket,
  our prospects on the insular basis depends on its continuance at a certain
  high and artificial level. I say 'artificial,' for I think English
  industrialism must be admitted by every one to have long ago gone beyond the
  point where it is only one of many elements in the national life. Almost
  everything else has been sacrificed to it, and our peculiar position,
  historically and geographically, has given us the chance of achieving this
  abnormal development. But because it is abnormal it is all on a needle-
  point. We have no background such as other countries possess in their rural
  prosperity. We are urban and industrial or nothing. The ordinary large works
  are situated in some densely inhabited and highly rated neighbourhood. Their
  working expenses are enormous, and their margin of profit variable, since it
  depends upon so many undetermined conditions. Let there be a shortage in the
  foreign crop which furnishes their raw material, or a new tariff clapped on
  their manufactured article by some large consumer, or a new Factory Act, or a
  fresh rate, and the whole system gets out of gear. The work for the labourer
  is therefore generally speculative, and there is an equally speculative
  element on his side. He finds the housing problem insoluble, and he labours
  generally under conditions which break his health; and he is at the mercy of
  the organisation of his own trade, and may find himself called to sacrifice
  his own present comfort for the assumed ultimate advantage of his class.</p>

  <p>"These and a dozen other elements of uncertainty, which spring from the
  extreme artificiality of our industrial system, tend to create the unemployed
  problem. Even the skilled workman finds himself frequently out of work, while
  the vast class of the unskilled&mdash;the unfortunates who are morally,
  mentally, or physically handicapped, or who through misfortune or lack of
  energy have remained at the foot of the ladder of labour&mdash;feel the
  insecurity more deeply. To my mind there is only one diagnosis of the evil.
  Industrialism has eaten us up, and, like all monopolies, has become a morbid
  growth, taking our life's blood and giving us little back. We are too
  preoccupied with it, and it is too preoccupied with itself. It is&mdash;how
  shall I say?&mdash;like a quantity of hot charcoal which, if spread through
  all the rooms of the house would have pleasantly warmed them, but if
  collected in one chamber will asphyxiate the inmates. And the result is the
  starving poor in our streets, and in every great city some quarter which is a
  sink of misery and crime.</p>

  <p>"There are, of course, a hundred proposals. Some maintain that the State
  should turn itself into a kind of Universal Employer, and use the derelict
  classes on public works devised for no other purpose than their relief. I do
  not think such a course would do much good. The State, by its large outlay on
  unproductive and unnecessary works, would be lessening the wealth of the
  country, and thereby lowering industrial well-being and adding indirectly to
  that evil of unemployment which it purported to cure. Some again are prepared
  to nationalise means of production, and make all industry a State concern. No
  doubt that course would effect many startling changes, but it would overturn
  the foundations of our society, the good with the evil; and I do not think
  that the English people will be inclined to burn their house down in order to
  cure the damp in the cellar. Some people propose, vaguely but benevolently, a
  return to the land. The great proprietors would disappear, and their estates
  would be converted into a multitude of small holdings, on which the
  unskilled, who had failed to maintain themselves at simple trades, would be
  set down to the most difficult of all professions. Of all schemes this seems
  to me the most crazy. If you make the holdings small enough to admit of a
  great number of families being settled on the land, you will make it
  impossible for these families to make a living. It is the simplest
  calculation. In the present state of English agriculture we know exactly how
  much land and how much capital are required before there can be sufficient
  return to make an income. If, on the other hand, you create only a small
  number of largish farms, you do not touch the unemployed problem.</p>

  <p>"There are many other suggestions which I need not repeat. But there is
  one feature common to them all. They all propose to settle the question on
  the basis of England, and England alone. Now I maintain that to attempt this
  is simply to reshuffle the cards without an atom of positive gain. The
  disease we are suffering from is congestion, a poverty of means to ends, a
  lack of breathing-space and opportunity. Millions are being morally starved
  because they have no hope in their lives, and their labour is without honour
  or ideals; and, may be, physically starved because they are not wanted in the
  present industrial market. What we have to realise is that these islands of
  ours are overexploited. You may arrange your beans in different ways, but you
  will never make more than. five; and if you want a square meal you must get
  more beans.</p>

  <p>"Therefore I say with all the earnestness I possess, that we can never
  settle the labour question with its kindred problem of unemployment on an
  English basis. What would we think of a landowner whose fields were grossly
  overstocked and his animals starved, although he had a rich farm at the other
  side of the county which was wholly ungrazed. We must take into account all
  our assets and face the difficulties in a spirit of sober reason. Let us find
  out what margin of workmen are crowded out of regular employment, let us
  classify carefully, for each problem must be dealt with on its merits, and
  there is no short cut to a solution. But let us keep in mind all the data,
  for there is no hope for us if we refuse to admit more than one-third into
  our inquiry. Public works for the unemployed may be unnecessary and wasteful
  in England, but elsewhere in the Empire they may be both necessary and
  economical. 'Back to the land' may be a foolish cry in a country where the
  soil refuses to support its owners, but the same thing is not true of the
  whole globe. There are countries which need above all things men, that
  commodity of which we have enough and to spare. They will take our raw human
  material and shape it for us. And they will take our industries and plant
  them in places where the men employed can lead a free life. The day of the
  great factory with its operatives living in the acres of squalid houses
  around it is going, I believe, even in England. It is recognised that
  industries under such conditions sin alike against decency, patriotism, and
  true economy. Even in England to-day you have your factories in the country
  and your model industrial villages. What is done on a small scale within our
  island can be done on a great scale within the Empire. It is for wiser men
  than me to settle the details, but I am convinced that Buskin has found in
  the matter a truth which is hidden from Royal Commissions."</p>

  <p>Mr Lowenstein spoke nervously and rapidly, and when he ceased he lay back
  in his chair as if much fatigued and closed his eyes. Lady Warcliff, who in
  spite of her energy and independence had always some prophet at whose feet
  she sat in her leisure, watched him with a solicitous face, and, since he
  showed no signs of continuing, took up his parable.</p>

  <p>"As a woman interested in philanthropy," she began, "I heartily wish the
  thing had never been heard of. We are smothered with it nowadays. We want
  less charity, and more justice and intelligence. Some one has divided mankind
  into soft-hearted cruel people and hardhearted kind people. The first have
  had their day, and a pretty mess they have made of it. They have filled our
  hospitals and asylums, and given us our East Ends, and our unemployed
  demonstrations. Comfortable people like a little easy charity as the sauce to
  their enjoyment. They are too cowardly and supine to face the truth, so they
  hang over it the cloak of their egregious generosity. We shall never get one
  step farther till we recognise that the destitute must be divided sharply
  into two classes&mdash;those who may be saved and those who, being past hope,
  should cease to exist."</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, Margaret, our sex comes very badly out of these
  discussions," the Duchess's voice had a startled note in it. "On board the
  yacht I heard Caroline airily advocating persecution, and now you want to
  cure our disorders by the euthanasia of social cripples. I am horrified that
  barbarism should find its only advocates among women."</p>

  <p>"I was afraid I should shock you," said Lady Warcliff sweetly. "And
  yet&mdash; will you show me any other remedy? There are classes of the poor
  in every town who in all seriousness are beyond hope. It may be physical, or
  moral, or mental, but the weakness is there and cannot be overcome. We shut
  up criminals and lunatics, and yet we allow these people, who are as
  certainly a leprous spot in our society, to go on marrying and perpetuating
  their worthless stock and hampering the activity of the State. Sharp surgery
  is the only cure. I want to see these hordes of thriftless, degenerate,
  scrofulous pariahs treated as what they are, irredeemable outcasts from
  society, and compelled by the State to keep their noxious influence away from
  the saner parts. This, however, is beside the question. It is the people who
  are worth saving that I want to talk about.</p>

  <p>"Like everybody who has been much among the poor, I have had many theories
  as to the cause and the cure of the evils I saw before me. But after I had
  tried many and found them wanting, I came round to the kind of creed which Mr
  Lowenstein has been sketching. It is this alone which makes me call myself an
  Imperialist. The common cant of empire is more obnoxious to me, I think, than
  any other cant. I have no liking for rhetoric or adventure, and most of my
  best friends belong to the school which is untouched by the glamour of
  foreign dominion. I want, like them, to cure our own evils before we
  proselytise up and down the earth, but it is just because of that desire that
  I am an Imperialist.</p>

  <p>"Take the very poor&mdash;men and women who are capable of work and could
  be raised under decent conditions to a wholesome level of life. If you keep
  such people on charity you ruin their self-respect. Besides, there is not
  enough charity to go round. But what they want in their lives is not so much
  the bare means of existence as some kind of hope. They must have a horizon
  before them, not straight grey walls between which they will be shepherded
  till they die. They want to be given opportunity, where on their own feet
  they can fight with fair confidence, first for a living and then for the
  amenities of life. Now it is my conviction that as things stand to-day in
  England it is impossible to give them opportunity. We may slightly improve
  their condition, and save a few here and there from starvation, but it is all
  an attempt to cure an earthquake with a pill. If we are true reformers we
  must go to the root of the matter and change the conditions which make
  destitution possible.</p>

  <p>"This is the creed of socialism, and so far we all agree with it. Our
  common position is, that we must create opportunity for all, not merely
  rescue hard cases. Where we part company is the method of this reform. One
  way is to lower the rich and raise the poor, until the whole State forms one
  vast lower middle-class in respect of income. By this means we should not
  increase the aggregate of opportunity, but we should make a fairer
  distribution. My objection to it&mdash; or rather the chief of my many
  objections&mdash;is, that it involves so complete a revolution not only in
  the material aspects of our society but in its whole thought and tradition,
  that it will be an uncommonly hard thing to achieve. Besides, I see little
  attraction in a society where, as Bagehot said, people would be forbidden to
  go barefoot, and everybody would have one boot apiece. I prefer the
  alternative, which is more logical, and to my mind infinitely more
  attractive, than a levelled-down middle-class State. My proposal is to add to
  the aggregate of opportunity. I want to follow the great law of supply and
  demand, and send men and women away from the place where they are not wanted
  to places where they will be welcomed.</p>

  <p>"At the same time I do not call my scheme emigration. People are free to
  emigrate as they choose to any part of the world, and if this were the
  unfailing cure for poverty the poor would long ago have found it out for
  themselves. I advocate State-organised emigration within the Empire, because
  it is only under these conditions that you can have it scientifically
  organised and supervised. Emigration is the least easy art in the world. It
  needs careful selection, long preparation of land and people for each other,
  and it wants at the back of it all the authority of the State. I have seen
  many experiments made by private individuals and philanthropic agencies which
  have been successful, but for our problem the solution must be on a great
  scale, otherwise we shall not have faced the difficulties fairly. The State
  must be the great emigrator. It alone has the power to collect full
  information and decide whether this or that scheme is justifiable. It can
  make arrangements with the Colonies, and it can reduce the cost of transport
  to a minimum. An imperial executive, such as we talked of the other evening,
  will be equal to the task, for being representative of the whole empire it
  will be spared the long negotiations with Colonial Governments which we have
  to put up with at present. Besides, in its permanent Bureau of Intelligence
  it will have the machinery for framing its schemes on the surest and most
  scientific grounds.</p>

  <p>"If you send the right man to the right place in the right way you will
  manufacture citizens out of material which at present is sinking into the
  slough of despair. You will give our empty lands population and reduce the
  congestion of our English slums. And you will bring hope, and a reasonable
  hope, into a kind of life which is starved for the lack of it. I do not say
  that the result can be achieved at once. But you will have opened up a path,
  and soon it will be well trodden. We Imperialists look forward to our people
  becoming more mobile, and seeking a home wherever life can be lived freely
  and sanely, instead of choking within the limits which were sufficient for
  the fathers but are too narrow for the sons. We agreed the other evening that
  our industries must move as occasion demands, and labour will naturally
  follow them. These are inevitable but unconscious processes due to the
  compulsion of facts. Meanwhile we can begin by a conscious attempt to redeem
  the tragedy of our civilisation not by any violent cataclysm but by using
  those means which are ready at hand. In Canning's phrase, we must call in the
  new world to redress the balance of the old."</p>

  <p>"At last," said the Duchess, "we have got a proposal with which I can
  cordially agree. I thought when you began to talk about labour you were going
  to defend things like the importation of coolies into South Africa. You know
  how much I and many other good Imperialists were distressed by that."</p>

  <p>"You are not going to escape, Susan," said Lady Lucy, smiling. "Lady
  Warcliff has been talking about English labour, and I have something to say
  about the other kinds which the Empire has to show. She pleads for greater
  elasticity for labour at home, but she has only touched on one part of a very
  large question. If we owe duties to English labour, we owe duties also to
  every man under our rule who works with his hands. You will find labour
  problems as difficult and as urgent as your English question in many parts of
  the Empire&mdash;in India, in the Far East, in the West Indies, in most parts
  of Africa. You have great tracts, like Southern India, which are so thronged
  with human beings that there is no room to live; and you have places like the
  Sudan and the Transvaal, and even this neighbourhood, where the land is far
  richer than the human population it supports. If we take up the task of
  government in a scientific spirit, it is surely our business to fit the
  people to the land. I agree with Lady Warcliff that nothing is so much wanted
  as mobility in labour. The old idea was that the labouring man was rooted by
  Providence in the soil where he was born. He might go away if he pleased, but
  the desire was thought to indicate frivolity. The notion that the State
  should encourage him to leave would have made the honest Benthamite blush.
  Happily that frame of mind is gone for ever. Where we see men suffocated for
  lack of space, and great spaces barren for lack of men, we are not to be kept
  from adopting the common-sense remedy by any <i>laissez-faire</i>
  croakings."</p>

  <p>The Duchess saw danger ahead and made haste to meet it half-way.</p>

  <p>"I have no fault to find with that, so far as it goes. If the Sudan can
  support ten millions and has got only three, then by all means import the
  natives of Southern India who, you say, are too many for their land to feed.
  Or let them come and cultivate the marshy coastlands near Mombasa, where the
  white man cannot live. All that is legitimate emigration, and no Liberal
  could object to it. What I am opposed to is the shifting of masses of men
  about the world, like chattels, at the will of private employers. You exploit
  their labour and pack them home again, and the main inducement to
  emigrate&mdash;the chance of a new home&mdash;is denied them."</p>

  <p>"And yet," said Lady Lucy, "I do not see why we should subscribe to the
  mystical doctrine that emigration is a good thing if we carry it out to the
  full, but very bad if we stop halfway. I can imagine so many cases where the
  half would be more than the whole&mdash;where, indeed, the whole would be a
  positive blunder. There are districts in India where the people are
  landowners and farmers. What they need is a little capital to buy more land
  or stock, and so enable themselves to make a steady living. They have no
  desire to settle abroad for good, and they have no need to do so. But if they
  can give their labour for a few years at good wages to some country which
  wants it, why should they be prevented? Or you may have the case of a country
  such as this or South Africa, which is naturally a white man's country, and
  which we all hope some day to see filled with white settlers; but some urgent
  temporary work has to be done&mdash;a railway built or new mines
  opened&mdash;and we must import labour at once and in large quantities. Is
  there any reason why coolies should not be brought in on contract, paid well
  for their work, and shipped back again? They are not compelled to come, and
  they are paid for coming; their coming benefits both themselves and the land,
  but their remaining would in no way benefit the land. In such a case surely
  we can have restricted emigration without breaking any of the
  Commandments."</p>

  <p>The Duchess looked round the company in despair. "What has come over my
  sex?" she asked. "According to Caroline the chief weapon of Imperialism is
  the rack or the thumbscrew; according to Margaret, the lethal chamber; and
  now, according to Lady Lucy, it is the chain and the sjambok we must really
  look to. I begin to be afraid that our enemies are right, and that we have
  got a taint of the later Roman Empire in our blood. As for this restricted
  emigration, I refuse to distinguish it from slavery. It is temporary slavery,
  to be sure, but the quality is the same."</p>

  <p>"If you will really think what you mean by 'slavery,' Susan, you will
  change your mind. The word is like so many others&mdash;'despotism,' 'force,'
  'filibustering,' 'perpetual tutelage,' which the heavy guns of our opponents
  fire daily,&mdash;it looks impressive in the air, but when it strikes it is
  found to be filled with sawdust. The word is formidable only when it is not
  examined. If you mean by it 'discipline,' then all types of organised action
  are slavery. A coolie who contracts to come here and work on a railway or
  mine, undertakes to do his work under such conditions as his employers
  prescribe. So long as these conditions are not such as to offend public
  morals, the men who organise it have an ample right to say what the
  particular work demands. The State says, further, that it does not wish these
  coolies to remain in the country. Is not the State the best judge of what the
  country requires? Is there anything immoral in a country shutting its doors
  against a special kind of emigrant? You say that it is wrong for a State to
  exploit the labour of these emigrants and yet to refuse them permanent
  citizenship. That, I confess, is a doctrine beyond my comprehension. You may
  as well say that I have no right to buy provisions from the Stores, when I
  prefer to order my wine elsewhere."</p>

  <p>"I do not feel so strongly opposed to State action," said the Duchess.
  "After all, the State has certain rights, and its motives are disinterested,
  and its oversight will be rigorous. If the indentured labourers were only
  imported for public works, I should not complain. It is when they are brought
  in for the use of private firms that the taint of slavery appears."</p>

  <p>Lady Lucy laughed. "Well, let us argue in the style of the Platonic
  dialogues. How, and by means of what qualities, are we to define State
  action? And shall we include municipal action in this category? And if State
  action is the action of the organised community for the good of the
  community, on what principle are we to exclude the action of public companies
  who control the main industries of the State? And again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For goodness' sake stop, Lucy!" said the Duchess good-humouredly. "I
  never could bear the Socratic method. Its little pistol-shot arguments give
  me a headache. I daresay there is something in what you say. Slavery may be
  an inaccurate term to describe what I so much dislike, but in any case it
  involves a perpetual danger of slavery. If you tie up by contract the liberty
  of an individual for a term, you pave the way for restricting it without any
  contract for life. It is the thin end of the wedge."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't use that phrase, my dear," said Lord Appin solemnly. "It is
  the worst of our parliamentary <i>clichés</i>, and, besides, Hardcastle has
  made it comic for ever. I was privileged to hear his great speech in the
  Lords against the Deceased Wife's Sister's Bill. He declared that he did not
  object to the present measure, which was merely permissive. 'But,' said
  Hardcastle, 'it is the thin end of the wedge. Soon it will be compulsory, and
  it is my misfortune that my dear wife has left me without any taste for her
  family.'"</p>

  <p>Lady Lucy, who at most times spoke little, had been so stirred by the
  Duchess's criticism that she had risen to her feet, and now addressed the
  company from beside Carey on the hearthrug.</p>

  <p>"Susan does not mean what she says. She is only repeating the arguments of
  her party, like a pious brigand who mumbles a paternoster before robbing a
  coach. Her last phrase is typical of a frame of mind which is very common and
  very hopeless. You are not to embark upon a scheme, however clearly you
  define its limits, because of its possible maleficent extension. I cannot
  understand the creed. If we believed in it all energy and progress would
  cease. We should sit like Buddha, twirling our thumbs, afraid to move a
  muscle lest we blundered. Not that any one seriously holds this faith. They
  imagine they do, because they are confused and slack, and have never taken
  the pains to think out what words mean. That is one class of my opponents.
  The others frankly detest the Empire, and hide their bias under the cloak of
  humanitarian tenderness. They hate colonial indentured labour, as Macaulay's
  Puritans hated bear-baiting, not because it does harm to the labourer, but
  because it does good to the colony.</p>

  <p>"The honest souls who dread the bugbear of slavery need not concern
  themselves. Slavery, which means that one man is at the mercy of another's
  caprices, will never raise its head again.</p>

  <p>Even though it had done no ill to the slave, it was economically and
  morally ruinous for the master. No! what we have to do is to save men from
  the far more relentless tyranny of circumstance. The bondage of things,
  believe me, is more cruel than the bondage of men. I call a dock-labourer in
  Poplar, who sees no hope for himself or his children, a slave. I call men
  slaves who, whether they own their land or not, are living always on the
  brink of starvation. But I call him a free man who sells his labour under
  contract for a term of years that he may earn enough to make his livelihood
  secure. I grant you that liberty is beyond price; but, like Burke, I want to
  see a 'manly, moral, and regulated liberty.' How often must it be repeated
  that freedom is not the absence of restraints, but a willing acceptance of
  them, because their purpose is understood and approved."</p>

  <p>Lady Lucy's quiet voice had risen to that pitch of fervour which betrays
  the natural orator. As she stopped, she looked with some little embarrassment
  at the Duchess, and with a sudden movement sank on the floor beside her chair
  and took a hand in hers.</p>

  <p>"Please forgive me for scolding you, Susan dear! But you know you deserved
  it. You have still got the General Election in your ears, and somehow its
  odious phrases make a fury of me. I don't blame any one for talking nonsense
  at home, but one must leave it behind at Musuru."</p>

  <p>"I am not convinced," said the Duchess. "Your principle may be right, but
  all your applications are wrong. And I am far from being sure about your
  principle. Without being a dogmatic individualist, I protest against the idea
  of the State incurring such vast responsibilities as providing employers with
  labour and moving populations about the world. I admit that the province of
  the State has been widened, but such an insane stretching of boundaries seems
  to me to court disaster."</p>

  <p>"Your fears always make me nervous, Susan," said Carey, "for you have an
  uncanny instinct for being right. But I think I can persuade&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was not permitted, for the Duchess rose and held before him protesting
  hands. "No, Francis, you shall not lecture me. And I promise in return to
  talk no more platform stuff. Besides, I am to be left alone after to-morrow
  with you, and you will have every chance to convert me.... Dear, dear, how
  solemn we all look! A Social Science Congress is out of place in a turquoise
  boudoir. That little Watteau shepherdess looks ready to weep with boredom. If
  there were such things as card-tables in this room I might think of
  bridge."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE whole party, men and women, breakfasted at the same hour
  next morning, most of them with that look of mingled unrest and high spirits
  which marks the expectant traveller. All their clothes spoke of the road,
  though the various styles showed that that road was not the same for every
  one. Those who were to stay behind&mdash;the Duchess, Lord Appin, and Lord
  Launceston&mdash;had the bland air of ease and proprietorship which all
  steadfast things wear in a changing world. The clock-work regime of Musuru
  made bustle impossible. There was no running about of maids and valets, no
  ringing of bells and confused directions. Carey consulted a paper in his
  hand, and now and then gave an order to a noiseless servant. The vast size of
  the house prevented the guests from catching any unsettling intimations of
  departure.</p>

  <p>"We are now," said the Duchess, to whom breakfast was a cheerful meal,
  "about to begin the inter-act in our comedy. I should like to know, before we
  scatter, what point we have reached in our discussions. We have talked about
  a great many different things, and on the whole I think we have been
  fair."</p>

  <p>"When Susan calls any one fair," said Lord Appin, "she means that he is a
  little biased in her own favour."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said the Duchess, "I have that complete candour which does
  not mind confessing a slight lack of it. We won't quarrel about words. We
  have examined home politics and found them largely at war about irrelevant
  issues. For myself, I think that we overstated the case, but I have no
  complaint against our positive conclusion&mdash;that Imperialism meant the
  treatment of all our problems on a wider basis. Then we took up certain
  questions in detail. Some, such as the kind of imperial constitution we must
  look forward to, and the kind of administration the Tropics will require,
  were imperial questions in the strictest sense&mdash;new conundrums which the
  fact of empire calls into being. Others, such as the proper way of remedying
  our social disorders, were ordinary home problems discussed from the
  imperialist standpoint. Am I right, Francis? You always said I had a logical
  mind."</p>

  <p>Carey nodded, and the Duchess continued.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to be unreasonable, but it seems to me that the subject
  wants a broader handling. I am old-fashioned enough to believe in principles.
  I want the principles, and not the details, of empire. Stop me if T am
  talking nonsense, please, for I never pretended to be a philosopher. But tell
  me, some one, if the orthodox way is not to get the general principles clear
  and leave the treatment of specific points to be deduced from them. Hugh,
  will you get me some cold partridge?"</p>

  <p>"My complaint," said Mr Wakefield, "is just the opposite&mdash;I am in no
  great hurry for principles. A vague philosophy of empire seems to me of the
  slenderest value at the present moment. Wait till we have penetrated some
  distance into the new country before we begin to map it. It is surely our
  business to have a clear policy on the different imperial
  questions,&mdash;that is to say, on every phase of our political
  life,&mdash;and having got that, to consider the best way and means of
  forcing it upon the world. That is the omission which I complain of. We all
  know roughly what we mean by Imperialism. What I want to know is how to make
  the ideal a fact, to exchange Imperialism for Empire. We have discussed most
  of the great practical questions except that of the tariff&mdash; and I am
  content to leave that alone for the moment. But how are we to set to work to
  enforce our solution?"</p>

  <p>"If you know what Imperialism is," said Lord Appin, "you know more than I
  do. I don't think your complaint can be admitted, Wakefield. As Carey
  declared a fortnight ago, we are here to get our minds clear. We are not in
  office with a solemn mandate to reconstruct the Empire. Our business is to
  create opinion. Our works, to adopt the old distinction, must be light-giving
  before they can be fruit-bearing."</p>

  <p>"Then what better are we than other framers of barren Utopias?" asked Mr
  Wakefield, in the act of assaulting a ham.</p>

  <p>"The distinction is easy. A Utopia is a scheme of things which is possible
  but not practicable. There is nothing in it inherently inconceivable, but it
  demands a change of conditions so complete as to be beyond reasonable hope.
  The empire we wish is not only possible, but practicable. We have all the
  elements of it before us. It only requires a slight adjustment of things as
  they are to make it a reality. If, then, it needs no magician's wand to
  change our dream into fact, but only a touch here and there, surely it is our
  first duty to see that the dream is clear and complete. Once that is
  accomplished, once something has been prepared which the mind of our people
  will accept as its creed, then with an easy conscience we can leave the rest
  to the hacks and journeymen of politics."</p>

  <p>"There's something in what you say," Mr Wakefield admitted. "I don't ask
  for office-bearers, a committee, a list of members, and a telegraphic
  address. There is a foolish matter-of-factness as well as a wise. But I think
  we should turn our attention to methods as well as to ideals. All about us
  lies a stubborn and unregenerate world. Though we speak with the tongues of
  men and angels we shall not be listened to, unless we prepare for ourselves a
  hearing."</p>

  <p>"Again, I say, that it is not our business. Imperialism is not a
  propaganda which needs to be canvassed like an election policy. It will find
  acceptation when it is acceptable&mdash;not before. Our trouble is that ours
  is still a cryptic faith, unformulated and incoherent. Our task is to bring
  its meaning to light, first for our own sakes and then for our people's. One
  man with a clear mind is more of a dynamic force than a dozen well-organised
  guilds for the dissemination of platitudes. When our symposium is at an end
  and we go back to the world, then by all means let us talk about methods. But
  do not let us confuse ourselves here by any obeisance to that intolerable
  fool, the 'practical man.'"</p>

  <p>"That is all very well," said the Duchess, "but nobody has answered my
  question. I am content that we should discuss empire without any eye to the
  ways and means of speedy realisation. But I am not content that we should
  settle isolated details and leave our principles all vague and
  inconclusive."</p>

  <p><i>"L'ineptie,"</i> Lady Flora quoted wickedly, <i>"consiste à vouloir
  conclure."</i></p>

  <p>The Duchess laughed. "A very apposite quotation, my dear, but I am not to
  be silenced by a tag from a French novelist. Francis, give me some
  comfort."</p>

  <p>"I am quite ready to defend our course," said Carey. "A question so vast
  and so subtle as ours&mdash;one, too, which has a bearing on every interest
  of our mortal life&mdash;cannot be treated in a mechanical way. It would be
  easy for us to pass a string of dapper resolutions, but, if we did, we should
  leave things as we found them. Principles and axioms we have, but they will
  only emerge when we have re-thought the conditions of our new world. We must
  creep before we can walk, and feel our way humbly in the mysterious twilight
  of dawn. We shall make many mistakes in that half-light, for the objects are
  blurred and the morning haze is still on the hills: but at least we can learn
  something of the nature of the land, and we can tell where the east lies. All
  of us have slightly different standpoints, different principles, and
  different prejudices. When a man lays down a dogma he is bound to colour it
  in a large degree by his temperamental bias. The colouring is probably
  unconscious, but the result is that truths appear, not in their white light,
  but all shot across with rays from the thinker's personality. There is a vast
  deal of irrelevant stuff in them, which is dear to some minds and
  antipathetic to others. Now, the best way, in my opinion, to get rid of this
  embarrassing surplus is to let the various temperaments conflict, for out of
  such conflict emerges the ultimate agreement. Ideals expressed crudely and
  summarily in conversation may be far from the perfection of a dogma patiently
  elaborated in the study. But they will have the merit of life, and the strife
  of living things always bears fruit in the end. Our object, as I said before,
  is to get our minds clear, not to frame a political catechism. And if this is
  so, then the minds must speak in their own accents, for it is only when we
  have understood wherein we differ from each other that we can realise wherein
  we agree. There is a method which philosophers call dialectic&mdash;the
  attainment of harmony by the reaction upon each other of opposing
  theories&mdash;and the plan we are following is in its way a homely kind of
  dialectic. Clearly we could not begin by laying down principles, for they
  would have been intelligible only to the man who laid them down. But at the
  start we found we were agreed, not on our axioms, but on our attitude.
  Imperialism, we decided, was the realisation of new conditions for all our
  problems, an enlarged basis, and fuller data. We did not attempt to find an
  answer to any of the great political questions: we only indicated the lines
  on which the answer must be sought. Imperialism, so ran our conclusion, is a
  spiritual change. We next looked at some of the simpler results which flow
  from the acceptance of the fact of empire,&mdash;especially the need for a
  new machinery of State,&mdash;and we applied the conception to our eternal
  labour problem, not to solve it, but to see how far it lit the path to a
  solution. But the kernel of our inquiry still awaits us, though we have
  cracked the shell. We have all by this time got a rough idea of what is the
  general meaning of the imperial attitude. But we must understand more fully
  the nature of the spiritual change we have talked of. I suggest, therefore,
  that we look at some of the great compartments of life and see how our
  conception will apply. It is a political conception, remember, but since
  politics in their new meaning are so intimately in-woven with life, we may
  learn something of its meaning by examining its bearing on art and conduct.
  And then, having got some understanding of the concrete significance of our
  ideal, we can hazard a fuller definition. So you shall have your principles,
  Susan, but at the end instead of at the beginning."</p>

  <p>"And in the meantime," said the Duchess, "we are to be assisted to
  understand what you call 'the concrete significance'&mdash;odious
  phrase!&mdash;of Imperialism by going off into the real wilderness for three
  weeks. I daresay we shall get the atmosphere of empire into our souls, but I
  shall be surprised if some of us don't get fever into our bones. I do hope
  you have been careful, Francis. I don't want Musuru to end as a nursing
  home."</p>

  <p>"There is just a chance of fever for those who go to Ruwenzori, but I
  think it may be avoided, and in any case it would be slight. The other
  expeditions are as healthy as a cruise in the North Sea. Shall I tell you the
  plans?"</p>

  <p>Carey had privately arranged with each member of the party as to how the
  next weeks should be spent, but no one had been permitted to divulge the
  arrangement. Hence, while all knew their destinations they had no inkling of
  who their companions might be, and their host's announcement was awaited with
  much interest. "First of all the Duchess stays on at Musuru with me; and Lord
  Appin and Lord Launceston keep us company. Lady Warcliff is going to Aden by
  the Austrian Lloyd to meet Sir Arthur on his way home from India. Mrs
  Deloraine was anxious to explore the East Coast, and Mr Wakefield wanted to
  have a look at the South African colonies, so they will join one of my yachts
  to-morrow at Mombasa. Mrs Wilbraham, Mrs Yorke, and Mr Lowenstein are going
  too, and I think they should be able to get as far as Durban, and spend three
  or four days ashore. I am a little doubtful about the next expedition, which
  is Astbury's idea. He and Graham and Marjory and Lady Lucy propose to go off
  to Ruwenzori, and make an attempt to ascend Kiyanja. It is well worth doing,
  for there is no stranger or lovelier mountain scenery on earth, but it is a
  long job, and the country before you reach the Mubuku valley is a little
  wearing. However, I have collected for them a good caravan, they can cross
  the lake in the yacht to the best starting-point, and two Chamonix guides,
  who live here in the settlement, will accompany them. They took me up the
  second time the ascent was made, and know every step of the road. Last of all
  comes the hunting-party,&mdash; Lady Flora, Lady Amysfort, Hugh, and Sir
  Edward. Teddy still yearns for a good eland head, so they are going off to
  the north to look for one&mdash;first, the Uasin-Gishu flats, and then up
  towards Rudolf. Remember you have only three weeks, and you won't be allowed
  to outstay your leave, for my men have orders to bring you back at all costs
  to Musuru twenty-two days hence. <i>Bon voyage</i> to you all, and good
  hunting to you, Teddy, and for Heaven's sake, Hugh, give up the habit of
  stalking lions with a pop-gun."</p>

  <p>"I wish," said the Duchess, "that I were not an old woman. Or, since that
  is a foolish thing to say, I wish that, being old, I did not feel so young. I
  suppose some one must remain behind to write to sorrowing relatives. You must
  be very kind to me, Francis, for I foresee I am going to be in a bad
  temper."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

  <p class="first">THREE weeks later Lady Flora and Hugh were riding with slack
  reins over the great downs which sweep from Musuru to the north. Their
  caravan was visible some miles in the rear, a small dot in the interminable
  expanse of green. The riders were facing south, and far away appeared the
  dark line which told of the forests which surrounded the house. It was a
  windless afternoon, but at that height the air had the freshness of a
  mountain-top. The world slept in the still and golden weather&mdash;only the
  sound of their horses' hoofs, and now and then the cry of a bird, broke in
  upon the warm, scented silence. The bent, green with springtide in the near
  distance, mellowed in the farther spaces to a pale gold, which stood out with
  entrancing clearness against the crystalline blue of the sky. It was a
  plateau on which they rode, for to the west the tops of little hills showed
  up on the horizon, foreshortened like the masts of ships at sea. This sight,
  and the diamond air and the westering sun, gave the riders the sensation of
  moving in some cloud-built world raised far above the levels of man.</p>

  <p>The three weeks had worked changes in their appearance. In spite of veils
  Lady Flora had become sunburnt, and she had exchanged her prim English seat
  for the easy pose of the backwoods. Hugh, tanned like an Indian, wore clothes
  so stained and ragged that he looked like some swagman who had stolen a good
  horse. He caught the girl's amused eye and laughed.</p>

  <p>"I know I'm pretty bad, but I'm not so bad as Teddy. I wish his wife could
  see him at this moment. And I wish the whole round earth could behold Lady
  Amysfort. Who could have guessed that the wilds would have wrought such a
  change?"</p>

  <p>"You don't know Caroline as well as I do, or you would wonder more. I was
  afraid she would be bored, or have a headache or something, for she is so
  accustomed to being served and worshipped that I did not think she would see
  any fun in roughing it. I suppose Mr Carey knew her better. But when I saw
  her making pancakes the first night, I knew it would be all right. Before we
  started, she was the last woman I would have chosen to travel with, and now
  she is the first. And that is a pretty high recommendation, I think."</p>

  <p>"Like Charles Lamb's praise&mdash;' What a lass to go a-gipsying through
  the world with!' I think so too. Well, it's all over now, Lady Flora. Have
  you enjoyed yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Shall I ever forget it&mdash;those magical weeks? We are not going back
  to anything half as good as we are leaving behind. I know now what Mr Astbury
  meant by Nirwana, for I have been living in it. Do you remember when we
  camped in the little ravine above Asinyo? When you and Sir Edward were away
  hunting all day, Charlotte and I used to climb up to the top of the rocks
  among the whortleberries, and watch the shadows running over the plain, and
  get blown on by the cool winds from the Back of Beyond. I never knew one
  could be so happy alone. And then the evenings, with the big fire and the
  natives' chatter, and Sir Edward's stories and Caroline's singing! Do you
  remember one night we argued for hours about what could be done to make Ascot
  more amusing? And then we suddenly remembered where we were, and burst out
  laughing. What fun it was, too, to lie awake in bed, quite warm and
  comfortable, and see the stars twinkling through the door of one's tent, and
  hear the wolves howling to each other! I hate coming back&mdash;even to
  Musuru.</p>

  <p>"And in all that huge, heavenly country," the girl went on, "there was not
  one white man. I shall soon be as fanatical about settlement as Lady
  Warcliff. Only I am going to preach a different creed. Think of the numbers
  of young men of our class who have sufficient money to live on and nothing to
  do. They somehow fall out of the professions, and hang about at a loose end.
  But there is excellent stuff in them if they found the kind of life to suit
  them. They would have made good eldest sons, though they are very
  unsatisfactory younger ones. But out here they could all be eldest sons. They
  would have a Christian life, plenty of shooting, plenty of hard work of the
  kind they could really do well; and then they could marry and found a new
  aristocracy. I don't suppose Mr Carey wants the new countries to be without
  their gentry. What a delightful society it would be! I can picture
  country-houses&mdash;simple places, not palaces like Musuru,&mdash;and pretty
  gardens, and packs of hounds, and&mdash;oh, all that makes England nice,
  without any of the things that bore us. There would be no Season, because
  there would be no towns, and everybody would remain young, because there
  would be nothing to make them grow old."</p>

  <p>"Would you be one of the citizens of your Utopia?" Hugh asked.</p>

  <p>"I think I should. At least my Better Self would. At this moment I look on
  the complicated world with disgust. My tastes are half pagan and half early
  Christian. I want to have all the things that really matter in life, and
  nothing else. I want to be able to look out on everything with clear eyes and
  without any sentimentality or second-hand emotion. Do you know, if I spent
  many weeks like the last three I should become very like a man. I have caught
  Sir Edward's slang, and I have almost fallen into his way of regarding
  things. What was that odd poem he was always quoting, something about the
  'wind in his teeth'?"</p>

  <p class="verse">"'May I stand in the mist and the clear and the chill,'"</p>

  <p class="first">Hugh repeated&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">"'In the cycle of wars,<br>
  In the brown of the moss and the grey of the hill,<br>
  With my eyes to the stars!<br>
  Gift this guerdon and grant this grace,<br>
  That I bid good-e'en,<br>
  The sword in my hand and my foot to the race,<br>
  The wind in my teeth and the rain in my face!'<br>
  'Be it so,' said the Queen."</p><br>

  <p>"Well, I am all for 'the wind in my teeth and the rain in my face,' though
  it would be very bad for my complexion. Where does Sir Edward get his
  verses?"</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows! Partly he invents them, and partly he misremembers things
  he has read. They are the strangest mixture. And he hasn't an idea who wrote
  what. He will put down some hideous doggerel to Shakespeare, and credit
  Whyte-Melville with the best things of Browning. He argued with me for a
  long time the other day about 'The desire of the moth for the star.' He only
  knew the last verse, and maintained that it had been written by an Australian
  poet of his acquaintance called Buck Jones.... How long do you think this new
  mood of yours will last? I am coming to shoot at Wirlesdon in November. Shall
  I find it gone?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said the girl dolefully. "Of course I shall go back and
  become a conventional young woman again. And yet I shall never be able to
  forget the other side. I shall always be longing for this plateau, and the
  sun, and the smell of the camp-fire. And when I see myself in a mirror at
  balls, my Better Self will say to my Ordinary Self, 'Now you are like a
  thousand people in a crowd; but once, little goose, you were a woman that
  mattered!' ... But, indeed, we can never get away from Musuru so long as Mr
  Carey lives. All that is delightful in the place is in him. I could not help
  thinking while we were on trek that the wilderness was his real setting, and
  not the splendours of Musuru. He broods over the country like a fate."</p>

  <p>"I have had the same feeling in all our travels," said Hugh. "Carey has
  the wilds so much in his soul, and he lives so entirely among elemental
  things, that he has the same aura as this land. When I think of him it is
  never at Musuru or in London, but as I first saw him in Rhodesia forcing his
  great shoulders through the bush with a dusty caravan behind him. No divine
  teacher would ever bid him sell all his goods and give to the poor, for it
  would be no sacrifice. He sits as loose among his great possessions as if he
  were a pilgrim with only a begging-bowl to his credit."</p>

  <p>"You once praised detachment," said Lady Flora, "and I didn't quite agree.
  I think it often means selfishness or a cold heart or a weak digestion. But
  Mr Carey's detachment is the most wonderful thing on earth. He has such a
  fire in his own soul that he does not need to warm his hands at any of the
  blazes which we poor worldly mortals shiver around."</p>

  <p>"You know how every now and again he breaks out into some proverb. I
  remember once in London walking down Piccadilly, when suddenly Carey came up
  and put his arm in mine. He walked with me for a hundred yards without
  speaking, and then he said in that abstracted way of his, 'Every man should
  be lonely at heart,' and went off. He, at any rate, has the true spiritual
  austerity. Do you remember the story of the Italian poet's mistress, sitting
  at some fete in beautiful clothes, when a scaffolding broke and she was
  crushed to death? And then they found that beneath her silken robes she had
  worn sackcloth. The world pictures Carey with his power and his wealth, and
  notes only the purple and fine linen, but few can penetrate to that inner
  austerity which looks upon such things as degrees of the infinitely small. He
  is, if you like, a practical mystic&mdash;an iron hand to change the fate of
  nations, and all the while a soul lit by its own immortal dreams. As you
  said, Lady Flora, while he lives we, who are his friends, can never sink
  altogether into the commonplace. And when he dies we can write over him that
  most tremendous of all epitaphs&mdash;' Blessed are the pure in heart, for
  they shall see God.'"</p>

  <p>The darkness was gathering fast, and the travellers were almost on the
  edge of the first belt of forest, beyond which lay Musuru. A clatter of hoofs
  behind them made them turn their heads sharply, and they found themselves
  overtaken by Lady Amysfort and Sir Edward.</p>

  <p>"We hurried on," said that gentleman, who in the twilight seemed longer
  and leaner than ever, "because we couldn't stand the pace of those confounded
  mules. So we left Akhub to bring in the caravan. We are not more than a mile
  from Musuru, so you'd better stick that hat of yours straight, Hugh. You look
  as if you had escaped from some Wild West show. Do you mind if I push on by
  myself? I am very keen to know what has won the Leger?"</p>

  <p>The dinner-table that evening was a very different sight from that
  presented on the first night of the visit. Then every one was fresh from
  home, a little" strange and shy, inclined to be in awe equally of their
  neighbours and their host. A month of close comradeship in the wilds had made
  smooth the rough places, and the whole company had become excellent friends.
  The men were all tanned to a uniform brown, which in Sir Edward's case had
  deepened into a Mephistophelian duskiness, and all had the clear eyes and
  alert figures which tell of perfect health. Even Mr Lowenstein had so greatly
  benefited by the voyage that he showed no trace of weakness. The women had
  changed the pink and white of civilisation for wholesome sunburn. As for the
  Ruwenzori party, they had escaped fever but had left their complexions on the
  high snows, and Graham and Astbury showed faces so wonderfully tattered that
  by contrast Hugh looked modish and refined.</p>

  <p>"Francis," said the Duchess, "may I beg a favour? Don't let the name of
  empire be mentioned to-night. I want to hear all about these young people's
  doings. Besides, they will soon be much too sleepy to talk. Flora says she
  rode thirty miles to-day."</p>

  <p>"First you must tell us what has been happening at home, Aunt Susan. I
  haven't had time to read my letters. I know what won the St Leger, for Sir
  Edward has told me the news eighteen times, but I don't know anything
  else."</p>

  <p>"What could happen at home in September? My letters are mostly from
  Scotland, where your uncle is still saying hard things about the fishing. All
  the history manufactured lately has been made here. You cannot imagine the
  profound peace of Musuru when you are all away. Bob read, and Lord Launceston
  wrote, and Francis was either shut up in his den working or roving about the
  estate. I dozed a good deal of the day, but we all woke up in the evening,
  and talked, no politics, only simple friendly gossip. We made Bob read Scott
  aloud after dinner, and we got through the 'Heart of Midlothian.' Never in my
  life have I spent a more restful time, and now I feel like some quiet old
  abbess whose convent has been invaded by Goths. You must atone for the jar to
  my nerves by giving me a faithful tale of your adventures. You may begin,
  Margaret!"</p>

  <p>"Alas, nothing happened to me," said Lady Warcliff, with that air of
  mingled petulance and candour which was the chief of her charms. "Aden was a
  simple inferno with heat and dust. I saw Arthur, and tried to get him to come
  on here with me, but the call of the partridges was stronger than my
  eloquence. He hurried home, and I came back and stopped for two nights to
  explore Mombasa. My story is a very dull one. How did you enjoy the East
  Coast?" she asked, turning to Mrs Deloraine.</p>

  <p>"It was all I had hoped for. We put into little decayed wayside ports,
  with a background of palms and green-shuttered white houses. All were hot and
  some smelt abominably, but there is nothing quite like them elsewhere. You
  feel around them still the romance of that greatest of the Crusades, the
  Portuguese Age of Adventure. You can picture the days when those fierce dark
  sea-captains, with half their men sick and their own faces haggard with the
  long voyage round the Cape, put into their harbours and said prayers of
  thanksgivings before the humble mission shrines. Those were the great days,
  when Albuquerque was conquering the Indies and in treaty with the Sultan for
  the Holy Sepulchre. And you can read in them, too, the visible record of the
  degeneration of a race. Once, in spite of heat and fever, they were the
  abodes of men. Hard-handed seigneurs lived in the <i>prazos</i>, and the
  soldiers who swaggered on the quays were no carpet-knights. But now you have
  a breed of dwarfish people, with black blood showing in their eyes and
  finger-nails, and the soldiers, in flapping trousers and tinsel medals, might
  have walked out of a comic opera. They have long ago forgotten Europe and the
  white man's pride, and Albuquerque is only a myth to swear by. The fathers
  have eaten sour grapes and the teeth of the children are set on edge. There
  is something about the weather, and the colour of the sea, and the colour of
  the vegetation, which speaks of decadence and apathy. But some places have
  found a life of their own, which has no reminiscence of Europe in it. I found
  out Inhambane, Mr Astbury, with your river and boatmen and everything.
  There's no decadence there&mdash;only a wholesome, sleepy barbarism."</p>

  <p>"I did not land," said Mr Wakefield stolidly, "till we reached Natal. I
  refused to land, for I am depressed by the imperial failures of other
  peoples. Personally I attribute Portugal's fiasco to that dead-weight of
  Roman Catholicism which she carried with her. But I was much cheered by
  Natal. Some of the Ministers got up a dinner for me, and I made a speech in
  which I hope I gave the colony some useful advice."</p>

  <p>"He made a speech," said Mrs Wilbraham tragically, "and the name of Natal
  was never mentioned in it. Nothing but Canada, Canada."</p>

  <p>"How could I deliver a panegyric on a place in which I had only lived for
  two days? I told them about the country I do know and left them to draw the
  moral. If I had begun to patronise them with advice on their domestic affairs
  they would all have been in arms. When we get the Premier of Natal over to
  Toronto you may bet that he'll talk about Natal and nothing else. The secret
  of keeping the peace in the colonies is for each man to expatiate on his own
  hen-roost. Colonials have known that for a long time, but English statesmen
  are just beginning to learn it."</p>

  <p>"In another minute," said Mrs Yorke, "we shall be talking politics. What
  is your story, Flora?"</p>

  <p>"Sir Edward got his big eland and thinks it a record, but he hasn't looked
  up Rowland Ward yet. There isn't really much to tell about our doings. We
  wandered along from day to day in perfect weather through a great green
  country. Ask Caroline."</p>

  <p>"I can't add anything," said Lady Amysfort. "It was a time of perfect
  rest. I thought of nothing in the daytime except the beauty of the place and
  the flowers and the wild beasts, and how good it was to look forward to
  dinner and the evening round the fire. After dinner we talked about
  everything in the world and rediscovered all the most profound platitudes.
  And one went to bed thinking how nice waking would be. It was a very happy
  time, but like all happy times it had no landmarks."</p>

  <p>The Duchess turned dejectedly to Lady Lucy. "It is what I always find.
  People who do interesting things have not a word to say about them. Surely
  you have something to tell me about the Mountains of the Moon?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes. We climbed Kiyanja, and Marjory nearly ended her mortal career by
  sliding down a snow-slope. It is impossible to give you any conception of the
  upper Mubuku valley by mere description. You have to see it to believe in it.
  Imagine a giant Alpine flora&mdash;groundsels like shrubs, heather in trees,
  azaleas and Alpine roses making a flame-coloured forest, and creepers of
  every tint blazing between the trunks. And at the end you come out on a
  glacier, and far up in a rocky cup there is a spring. It took me some time to
  realise that this was the real source of the Nile&mdash;the place which
  Alexander the Great saw in his dreams, and Speke and Baker thought they had
  found in Lake Victoria. All around us was a snowfield which might have been
  on the aiguilles above Chamonix. I have often felt the lack of the true
  geographical imagination, for I could not focus the place in my thoughts. The
  little trickle I drank of, instead of running down to feed some tame Swiss
  torrent, was the head waters of the greatest and most mysterious river in the
  world.... We camped beside it, and bitterly cold we found it, and then before
  dawn next morning we started for the summit. I thought the snow very
  difficult, and it was a blessing to get on hard rock. In one couloir Marjory
  fell and pulled Mr Astbury out of his steps. They were well held, but it took
  us an hour to get them up, for we had to dig gigantic caverns before we got a
  step that was really safe."</p>

  <p>"Had you any view?"</p>

  <p>"For five minutes on the top we saw the kingdoms of the earth spread out
  beneath us. Then the mist came down, and we had a weary descent before we
  reached our high camp. Marjory and I were utterly tired and soaked to the
  bone. Do you remember that evening, Mr Astbury, with the rain pelting on our
  tents, after we had drunk soup and brandy and got into dry clothes? You said
  that these occasions got rid of every difference of education and temperament
  and sex, and made us all elemental human creatures, and I quite agreed with
  you. It was worth while travelling a long way to hear our critical Marjory
  gloating over food like a glutton and talking wild mountaineering slang with
  the guides."</p>

  <p>"She's an uncommonly fine climber," said Mr Astbury with conviction.
  "There was a bit on the highest rocks, as bad as anything on the Grepon, and
  she took it like a chamois. I don't praise you, Lady Lucy, for there's
  nothing you can't do. Besides, you are an old mountaineer. But it gives me
  enormous pleasure to have made another convert."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I should not care for ordinary climbing," said Miss Haystoun, who
  looked very beautiful with the flush of sunburn in place of her wonted
  pallor. "But Ruwenzori can be like nothing in the world. The sharp contrast
  between the rich moist glens and the cool snow is an intoxication in itself.
  Besides, why should I not be a lover of mountains? We have all in our breasts
  odds and ends of strange souls. If we were clean-cut, four-square beings we
  should not be worth talking to."</p>

  <p>Lord Appin nodded approval. "When I was a very young man at Oxford," he
  said, "I evolved what I flattered myself was a new system of philosophy. I
  called it Romanticism. It was a very crude system, strong on the aesthetic
  and ethical sides, but lamentably weak in logic and metaphysics. Its central
  doctrine, if it could be said to have one, was that truth, virtue, happiness,
  all the ideals, were attained by the clash of opposites. Holiness was
  possible only as the result of the struggle of the soul with an alien world;
  happiness as the outcome of pain endured and difficulties surmounted. The
  beauty of art was the conquest of human genius over intractable matter. And
  romance&mdash;an abstraction of my own which I interwove with the whole
  system&mdash;was the perpetual contrast between the human spirit and its
  environment&mdash;nobility side by side with baseness in one soul, or the
  courage of man transcending impossible disasters, or beauty flowering in a
  mean place. It was a very young man's confession of faith, and yet there was
  the glimmering of a truth at the back of it. It was my instinctive protest
  against the undue simplification of life. We are all a strange compound, and
  we shall never reach our full stature by starving certain parts of our nature
  of their due. What you call romance, Marjory, is another form of the old
  conflict between the real and the ideal, the world into which we are born and
  the world which we would recreate for ourselves. It involves conflict between
  ideals, but not the neglect and starvation of any. Of course this truth is at
  the bottom of our new conception of empire. Imperialism"</p>

  <p>But at this point the Duchess rose. "You are slipping into politics, Bob,"
  she said. "Never mind Imperialism to-night, but by all means let us talk
  about romance. Letty has a fascinating story she might tell us if you asked
  her very nicely...."</p>

  <p>Soon the company were settled comfortably around the fire in the inner
  hall. Mrs Yorke, after a little pressure, had sent to her room for a
  despatch-box, from which she took a small manuscript book.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why I should bore you with family history," she said, "but I
  was once rash enough to tell Susan this story, and she liked it, and said it
  was an allegory and true of us all I have no theories about it, except that
  it seems to fit in very well with what Lord Appin has been saying. So if it
  amuses you, you shall have it.</p>

  <p>"There was a certain relative of my husband's whom I shall call Sir
  Charles Weston. It is not his real name, and Lord Appin will probably see
  through the disguise, as Susan did, but I owe it to my self-respect not to be
  more explicit. He was an eminent lawyer&mdash;at least he made a large
  fortune in the law courts&mdash;and, above all things, he was an earnest
  Liberal. His life was published not so very long ago in two volumes, and I
  remember that his biographers said that he was almost the last of the old
  stalwart God-fearing statesmen. They said that he lived only for the great
  causes of peace, economy, and reform. He left among his papers some notes,
  called 'Reflections on certain modern tendencies,' which are not very
  cheerful reading. He assumes the role of a minor prophet, and cries 'Ichabod'
  to the future of Israel.</p>

  <p>"I only met him once, shortly after my marriage. He had disapproved of it
  strongly; indeed there was hardly a vice which he did not trace to the
  'Americanising' of England. He said that the people of the United States had
  fallen like Lucifer from their high estate, and the latest American he had
  any respect for was Jefferson. Once he made Henry very angry by telling him
  that all American women seemed to be serving behind an intellectual counter.
  However, he disapproved so much of Henry on every ground that one blunder
  more or less did not make much difference. I had to be taken to see him, and
  the prospect made me very nervous. But he turned out quite kind, and he had
  nice, courtly, old-fashioned manners, which I thought sweet. He was a great
  philanthropist, but rather a dictator, I fancy, for he had no idea of giving
  the poor any choice in the way they should be helped. His face was like an
  old woman's&mdash;amiable, vacant, a little foolish, though he had moments of
  mental activity when a kind of power would come into it. His talk was one
  mosaic of moral and political platitudes; and I should have said that he had
  never possessed the imagination of a cow.</p>

  <p>"Well, he died, full of years and honour, and to our amazement he left all
  his papers to Henry. We sorted them out, and the Liberation Society, or
  something of the kind, wanted to have his life written, so we handed over the
  bulk of them. But one little diary we kept to ourselves. There was a big
  diary in about thirty volumes which plays a great part in the biography. But
  the little diary which we found in an old safe did not appear in that
  work.</p>

  <p>"I shall never forget the day we found it. Henry picked it up and said,
  'Another diary,' opened it at random, and began to read: 'Rhoda came to-night
  as I sat alone in the Purple Chamber. There was no lamp, and her pale beauty
  shone in the dusk like the silver of moonlight. I thought how in this little
  dancing-girl one caught something of the mystery'&mdash;and then Henry could
  read no more, but sat down and gasped. When he found his breath he could only
  keep repeating, 'The old scamp!'</p>

  <p>"We tried another page, and found an account of some battle that Sir
  Charles talked of having fought, and then a long tale of a mid-winter march
  on the Danube. Henry, when he heard this, observed that to his certain
  knowledge his relative had never been out of England. Last of all, we came on
  a reference to Theodora, his wife. 'My great-aunt,' said Henry, 'was
  christened Elizabeth Anne. There are three possible explanations of this
  affair. Either he was a most uncommon old sinner, or a most accomplished
  liar, or as mad as a March hare. I incline to the last.'</p>

  <p>"But he was wrong, for in a little while we hit upon the right
  explanation. I think I was the first to see it, but after we had read the
  diary through, doubt was impossible. We saw that behind the bland Sir Charles
  there had stood another figure, Heaven knows what revenant from the splendid
  past. There were two souls in his body, one timid, pragmatical, humane, slow,
  and stupid&mdash;the soul of all democratic lawyers from the beginning of
  time; the other the soul of a king, merciless, passionate, and incomparably
  able. So all the time he lived a double life. In the daytime he went through
  the ordinary routine. He was a great advocate of the reform of the criminal
  law, he was president of the London Missionary Society, and in the House of
  Commons he was famous for his attacks upon Tory extravagance, and especially
  upon militarism. He emptied the House, for he was the prince of bores.
  Disraeli said that he made a solitude and called it a Peace debate.</p>

  <p>"But late at night and in the early mornings and at odd moments the other
  soul had its chance. And then he was an Emperor of Byzantium, ruling half the
  world with an iron hand. The diary showed his accession to power, for to
  begin with he was only John Chrysaor, the General of the Army of the East.
  Bit by bit he became the strong man in the empire. He won the Church to his
  side, and when he fought a great battle on the eastern marches which turned
  back the tide of Mohammedan invasion, he became the popular hero. The Emperor
  died, leaving an effeminate son as his successor; but John hurried back to
  New Rome, cleared out the mob of eunuchs and parasites, and seized the throne
  with universal goodwill. Then began a reign of iron, as appeared from the
  little diary. The Emperor John fought the Church and won, he subdued a Dacian
  insurrection, he built palaces and churches, he ransacked East and West for
  art treasures, and he had great dreams of restoring the unity of the empire
  and carrying his court to Rome.</p>

  <p>"I am not going to retell this wild story, but once, after I had been ill,
  I amused myself with taking the two diaries and comparing the entries. In the
  little book no year was given, but it seemed to correspond to a certain epoch
  in the long one, and the days and months followed as regularly as in the
  other. So I chose parallel passages of the same date, to show the gulf
  between the two souls.</p>

  <p>"The first is dated June 10th. In the large diary he wrote&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"'I have been in the House all afternoon. Indian frontier
  policy was discussed, and Disraeli made a flippant and hectoring reply to the
  profound arguments of Mr G. Many applauded, and, being unable to find a
  chance to speak, I came away greatly saddened. Liberalism for the moment is
  eclipsed and shadowed by a vulgar worship of reaction. Do these vain people
  who prate about the prestige of Britain ever reflect, I wonder, on the
  shallow foundations of their creed? We have taken upon ourselves
  responsibilities which carry with them no increase in moral
  stature&mdash;nay, which minister to the lowest and most depraved elements in
  our nature. We claim a right to rule certain dark-skinned peoples, thereby
  offending against the oldest and most indisputable of human rights&mdash;the
  right to liberty. It tickles our sense of authority, and degrades alike our
  reason and our conscience. And it always brings war. These stay-at-home
  roysterers are very ready to unsheath the sword. Well for their peace of mind
  that they cannot realise the horrors of which they are, before God, the
  cause. The older I grow the deeper becomes my conviction that in these days
  of enlightenment no war can be justified. Every war&mdash;I do not care what
  its pretext&mdash;must be a blunder in statesmanship and a sin against the
  Most High.'</p><br>

  <p>"On the same day he wrote in the little diary&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"'It is the evening of the greatest day in my life. The
  blood is crusted over my eyes, my left arm is crippled, and I am caked in
  dust. A quarter of my men are slain, but the enemy have been ground between
  the millstones. I staked everything on a great throw and I have won. I sent
  my cavalry into a death-trap well aware that few would return, but the ruse
  succeeded, and the Emirs found their own shambles before the sun set....
  To-morrow at dawn five thousand captives, with the Cross branded on their
  shoulders, shall be sent to New Rome as the first fruits of my victory. The
  plunder follows, and I can see the weak eyes of my Imperial Master glitter
  when he sees the spoils of Damascus in his treasury. ... I have taken the
  first step in the great march to a Throne and nothing but death can stop my
  pilgrimage. Nay, death is an ally: he will not betray one who has offered him
  such princely bribes....'</p><br>

  <p>"The strange thing," Mrs Yorke continued, "is that the entries in the two
  books always correspond. If any subject has been occupying his mind in the
  one diary it reappears in some form or other in the second. For instance, he
  made a great speech at a meeting at Exeter Hall to protest against Gordon's
  proposal to take Zebehr Pasha, the ex-slave-dealer, as his colleague. It is
  printed in full in the Life, and the editors remark that 'the passionate
  conscience of England spoke through its chosen mouthpiece.' In the entry in
  the little diary we read&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"'To-day the fruits of my Dacian wars were sold in the
  market. Fifty maids were kept for the Palace, and five hundred of the
  lustiest young men were enrolled in the Praetorians. New Rome will be full of
  stalwart barbarians, and the Circus enriched by promising recruits. Would
  that each year could see an infusion of such virile stock among our languid
  citizens!'</p><br>

  <p>"On September 25th he was adding to Fairholme, his place in Surrey, and
  was very much worried about the cost. Says the big diary&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"'I can postpone the addition no longer, but I seriously
  grudge the outlay. I have taken the best advice I could find and have made
  considerable reductions in the estimates, but the expense still seems to me
  undue. The ground-floor of the new wing will be occupied by a library and a
  billiard-room, the floor above by six bedrooms, each of which&mdash;my wife
  insists&mdash;must have its own bathroom. Elizabeth is anxious that the
  housemaids shall have better quarters, so the top-floor will be
  utilised...'</p>

  <p class="first">and so on with many tiresome details. "Now for the little
  book&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"'To-day the building of my summer Palace begins. The walls
  will rise level with the cliffs, and the portico will be open to the sea. For
  months ships have brought Parian marble and cedar logs to the little wharf
  below, and this morning the first hammer rang on the foundations. The great
  library is on the side facing the hills, so that I may have the open air even
  when the wind blows. There the hundred thousand volumes which Philotimus has
  gathered for me will be housed in cedar cabinets, and there I may find peace
  to wrestle with the problems of the state. It has been my order that the work
  should proceed by night and day, and the torch-lit dusk will be a sign to
  Theodora of my love, for it is for her sake alone that I burden my soul with
  trifles.'</p><br>

  <p>"Which," said Mrs Yorke, "brings us to Theodora. The Emperor John had a
  wide choice of princesses, but he imitated Justinian in falling in love with
  a slave-girl who was also a popular actress. He married her, and judging by
  the diary, she seems to have led him a pretty dance. She had other lovers,
  and there is a really horrid passage in the book where he describes the
  revenge he took on the man he found in the Empress's boudoir. The two most
  piquant contrasts in the diaries concern the two women whom he thought he
  loved. On January 17th we read in the big diary&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"'I have just returned from the churchyard where all that is
  mortal of my dear wife was this afternoon laid to rest. Even in my private
  diary I cannot write the thoughts which are now surging in on my mind. The
  sense of loss has crippled my power of reflection and drugged my memory. For
  forty years she was my comrade and friend, the sharer of every hope and every
  sorrow. Elizabeth was one of those rare women whose price is indeed above
  rubies. In her husband's work and in the calm atmosphere of the home her
  sweet, pure domesticity found perfect content. No passion ever ruffled the
  calm surface of her soul. As I think of her, I realise how unstable a
  foundation for wedded happiness is the volcanic love which modern poets prate
  of. Mutual respect, a vivid interest in the personality of each other, a
  gentle and constant affection, are the only guarantees of that private
  tranquillity which enables a man to face the rough fortunes of the outer
  world. Passion! The word should be expunged from our language, for when it is
  not begotten of folly and weak emotion it is first cousin to morbidity and
  vice.'</p><br>

  <p>"Under the same date in the little book there is a rhapsody on Theodora's
  beauty which is not unlike the Song of Solomon. And there is a long
  passionate appeal to her to give him her heart as he had given her his. I
  will not read these passages, for the style of Byzantium was&mdash;well,
  Byzantine. And then the statesman appears, for the Emperor John was, like
  Napoleon, <i>un être politique</i>. He tells his love of the power which
  shall be hers, and the honours and treasures that he will cast at her
  feet.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"'These dogs of the Senate and the Church have again
  besought me to break with you. They say that the sacrosanctity of the throne
  will be gone if it is shared with a dancing-girl. Who are they to dictate the
  choice of an Emperor of Rome! I swear to you, angel, by the Most High God
  that I will create for you a new earth. Cities and temples shall be ground
  into dust to make a path for these delicate feet. Your white hand shall fling
  open the door of a new Empire. Together we will sweep across the west, and
  when we have crushed the barbarians and shaken down the dotards of Italy, our
  palace shall be the Capitol, and you and I, little one, side by side, shall
  rule the world from the secular throne of Augustus.'"</p><br>

  <p>"And what happened in the end?" Marjory asked.</p>

  <p>"Alas, the diary stops long before Rome was conquered. He had an illness
  some years before his death, and after that he never resumed it. But how I
  wish that I had known that all the while, when he was talking platitudes at
  Henry, one-half of him was revelling in such a dream!"</p>

  <p>"And the moral of that is?" asked the Duchess.</p>

  <p>"Surely, Susan," said Lord Appin, "that we are such very composite
  creatures that, as Marjory said, we should be very shy of dogmatising on each
  other's natures. That, I suppose, is the worst platitude I have ever uttered,
  but then, all morals are platitudes, and you asked me for one."</p>

  <p>"Well, I think they were both very unpleasant characters&mdash;especially
  the Emperor John. Sir Charles was at least respectable."</p>

  <p>"Really, Aunt Susan," said Lady Flora, "we have all got to the stage of
  talking like Alice in Wonderland. Don't you think it is time to go to
  bed?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE evenings had grown milder, and after dinner it was
  possible to sit in one of the airier drawing-rooms which opened on the stoep.
  So soft was the weather that the great windows were left half open, and
  through them blew scented wafts from the gardens.</p>

  <p>Mrs Deloraine's beautiful head was silhouetted by a little lamp against an
  ebony screen. She arranged some papers on a table beside her and began to
  speak in her curiously gentle voice.</p>

  <p>"I have been given my orders by Francis, and I can't disobey them. But I
  hope you will be a very charitable audience. I am not a controversialist,
  and, though I have written a little it is very hasty and imperfect, and I
  shall have to supplement it as best I can. I want to speak about the bearing
  of our creed upon the aesthetic side of life, and my only claim to speak on
  the subject is that I was warned that I should be expected to deal with it,
  and I have been trying to think it over on our Ruwenzori trip. Mountains give
  one a hill-top prospect, but they do not help one to put ideas into a clear
  system. So if what I say is very full of loose ends, you must remember the
  mountains and forgive me.</p>

  <p>"I know no pocket definition of Art. But as I understand it, it is the
  quest of beauty under certain conditions. All honest work, all right conduct,
  all true speech, have beauty in them, and the worker and the speaker are in
  one sense artists. But in its usual acceptation it means a conscious quest,
  where beauty is the goal sought for its own sake, and not the attendant of an
  alien ideal. And this beauty must be presented in terms of our common life.
  Poetry must be written in some tongue familiar to mankind; painting works
  through the homely medium of paint and canvas, and makes its appeal to eyes
  accustomed to the rough world; music is contained in notes within the range
  of the human ear. In a deeper sense, too, Art is rooted in life. For its
  material must not be sought in some rarefied world, or even in certain
  carefully defined provinces of that world which we know. Our poetry must not
  come from the stars or the Far Islands, but from the men and women we see
  daily, and the warm breathing life which we call 'real' because we cannot
  escape from it. To Art nothing can be unclean or common, provided it has the
  warrant of reality. If we limit ourselves by any of the many conventions
  which have stifled growth, and say that Art can deal only with the fortunes
  of gentlefolk, or, at the other extreme, of peasants; that Art belongs to
  civilisation and is urban at heart, or that it is natural and untamed and can
  be found only in the wilds; that it must deal with things fair and comely or
  only with the ugliness and tragedy of life,&mdash;then we sin against its
  catholicity and truth.</p>

  <p>"But all this is only to define the material and to leave out the spirit.
  The realist is so absorbed in the variety and multiplicity of the world, that
  he imagines that in a dull chronicle of details he has fulfilled the purpose
  of the artist. But the essence of Art is that it is creative. It brings into
  the wilderness the shaping spirit of imagination, and by selection, by a
  deeper instinct, it shows us harmony in chaos, nobility in the squalid, and a
  fugitive poetry in the commonplace. The temporal, in the hand of Art, takes
  on the guise of the eternal. The ordinary man sees in a passing face
  comeliness, or want, or vice, or misery, but when fixed on the canvas of a
  master the original is forgotten, and the whole tale of mortal passion is
  enshrined in that face for the seeing eye. Art is the revolt against the
  bondage of the superficial, the accidental, and the trite. It means always a
  spiritual adventure and the conquest of new worlds for the mind&mdash;worlds
  none the less new because they are the re-creation of the old. Every one has
  known what it is to visit a place many times and find it dreary and
  uninspiring, till one day comes an hour of illumination, and the common
  fields and woods are touched with a light that never leaves them. Art brings
  this fairyland gleam to life, and we realise that it is no importation from
  without but life itself laid bare in its profoundest meaning.</p>

  <p>"I am one of those who hold the orthodox view about Art. Its purpose to my
  mind is not merely to inform, or merely to delight, but to illumine. I
  believe that there are fixed laws of beauty, canons for the artist which are
  as eternal as beauty itself. But we need not delay now to discuss these
  ultimate questions of aesthetics. The truth I wish to enforce is, that while
  the canons of Art may be limited and stationary the subject-matter to which
  they apply is endless and ever growing. Its boundaries are extended with each
  addition to the world's knowledge. To my mind the worst crime against the
  laws of Art is the attempt to limit their sphere of application.</p>

  <p>"For mark what happens. We are left with a weary catalogue of things which
  Art may play with. And because a wall has been built round them, they are
  divorced from the rest of life, and become in themselves a phantasmal world.
  Their roots are no longer in reality, and therefore there can be no growth.
  The artist becomes a manipulator of mechanical toys, very subtle, exquisitely
  clever, and utterly futile&mdash;a purveyor of second-hand emotions and
  academic tragedies. The Muses become either genteel spinsters or stupid
  housemaids. For you cannot subdue the winds of the world to orderly breezes
  which never ruffle or chill, and when Art becomes domestic it dies.</p>

  <p>"I seem to find in our Art to-day something of this vice, not so much in
  creed as in practice. We have not the wits to see that life is a violent,
  far-ranging thing, delighting in large contrasts and nobly tolerant. We are
  too fond of little prettinesses, too complex, too preoccupied with the small
  intricate things to have leisure for the great simple things which are the
  root of the matter. So we spend our time spinning cocoons, excellent as
  cocoons go, but, if I may borrow Lady Flora's pet phrase about people, they
  'don't matter.' And the result is that Art misses that direct emotional
  appeal which is the final test of its truth. Great Art affects us with
  something of the emotion of life. The high rubs shoulders with the low, and
  the face of the laugher changes suddenly into the face of the seer and
  prophet. Cleopatra passes from banter with a peasant to the loftiest of human
  soliloquies. But in our dim half-world such heights are beyond us. We have
  too little of the real, for we are apt to limit arbitrarily the material of
  our art, and the ideal eludes us because it belongs to a nobler philosophy
  than ours. I am afraid we are in danger of decadence, and our only hope is in
  finding a new world.</p>

  <p>"If I were a great poet I should write an epic on new worlds. A veil seems
  to lift when life is becoming dingy and narrow, and, behold! the gleam of
  dawn on untravelled seas. Men suddenly look up from their daily round and
  become aware of a great hope. It may be the revelation of a new Messiah or a
  new social creed, or in the literal sense a new world. Now, what we
  especially need is the last, for our Art wants above all things something of
  that spirit which you may call Ionian or Elizabethan or romantic, as you
  please. It is an enlarged basis of life that we require, rather than a new
  interpretation of our present routine. We must be shaken out of our content
  and our cynicism, and shown that the earth is full of wonderful and beautiful
  things, and that the wisdom of our grandfathers has not exhausted it. I
  believe in my heart that such a revelation awaits us. Mankind stands at the
  end of one long epoch, and has made itself master of the material globe.
  Science has opened her door half-way to us, we have circumnavigated and
  explored the whole earth, but still we are only at the beginning. For there
  still remains the task of taking possession&mdash;of reshaping all our creeds
  to correspond with our new heritage, and remodelling our heritage on an ideal
  plan. I am only concerned with the meaning of this illumination for Art, and
  two truths seem to be vital. The first is that we must absorb this enlarged
  material basis and make it part of our spiritual life. Otherwise it remains
  only a mysterious background, such as we find in the Roman decadence, while
  all the time we go on living among our stale conventions. To us, as to the
  poets of the Silver Age, the outer empire will be only matter for a metaphor
  or a jest, unless we draw it within the circle of our lives. The second is
  that we must carry into our new sphere the inherited traditions of our
  culture, and not jettison them as useless ballast. Art, remember, looks
  towards the future, but her foundations are always in the past. Otherwise we
  shall become outlaws from her kingdom, and all the freshness of a new earth
  will not avail since we have lost the canons of interpretation. This, I
  think, is the weakness of so much colonial poetry. The novelty of the matter
  is believed to atone for the absence of the great tradition in the manner.
  But the rococo phrases of Fleet Street will never reproduce the mystery of
  the wilderness. What is lost, however, in Art which is colonial, and
  therefore provincial, may be recovered in Art which is imperial."</p>

  <p>"I think I understand what you mean," said Lady Warcliff, "but I am far
  from certain that I agree with you. I should have thought that the essence of
  empire is the indefiniteness of its horizon and the unexplored chances of its
  future, whereas the essence of Art is that it works within clear limits.
  Surely, for 'great verse' we are taught to look to a 'little clan.' Material
  greatness is generally assumed to be hostile to spiritual perfection."</p>

  <p>Mrs Deloraine was always embarrassed by Lady Warcliff's precision. "I know
  that opinion," she said a little nervously, "but I most profoundly disagree
  with it. Of course, Art works within limits and abhors loose outlines. This
  has been said a hundred times, as in Goethe's famous line&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">'In der Beschränkung zeigt sich erst der Meister.'</p>

  <p class="first">But these limits are the eternal laws of Art's being and not
  the accidents of circumstance. Power and space will kill Art unless they are
  absorbed by the spirit of the artist. But that is not to say that when
  properly used they may not be Art's best allies. Just as asceticism is only
  possible for those who have some inner core of grossness in their nature, so
  those who would make Art a nun are those who are also capable of making her a
  courtesan. It is a creed whose spirituality is not more but less than ours.
  If we limit Art to simple men and a little nation, we assume that her
  spiritual power is so slight that she will be overwhelmed and coarsened by a
  richer material environment. What warrant have we for so low a view of the
  fire in her heart? I grant you that in a great empire she walks in dangerous
  paths, but then the goal is more splendid, and it would be the part of
  cowardice to shirk the journey.</p>

  <p>"I do not think that in this company at any rate I need linger on this
  point. My business is to try to show wherein the creed which we call
  Imperialism offers Art that new world which she needs. I remember that when I
  was a young girl the very name of Empire was a hateful thing to me. All the
  old orderly life which I loved seemed to be threatened by these barbarians
  who talked in a strange jargon, half mercantile, half Jingo. Their Palace of
  Art seemed to be constructed on the lines of a New York sky-scraper, and
  their music was the thumping of a brass band. And yet even then I seemed to
  hear behind the shouting a new note which haunted me in spite of my
  prejudice. As I grew older I came to live less in the past, and looked more
  to the realities of the world around me. Art came to be less a thing of
  dainty memories and delicate echoes, and more and more something solemn and
  tragic, and yet instinct with immortal humour, the voice of God speaking
  through the clamour of His creations. And then I felt the need of a wider
  horizon, a hope which should not be the perquisite of the few but the
  treasure of the humble. And suddenly I saw that I had been blind and deaf to
  a new world of which simple folk had long ago entered into possession.</p>

  <p>"Imperialism brings into life, and therefore into Art, which is life's
  interpretation, a vision of a wider world. It shows us all the hard walled-in
  highroads which we had thought eternal, opening out on an upland which still
  retains the light of morning. That is the first of its gifts. Stale
  conventions, preciosity, all vapouring and trifling prettiness, must perish
  in that high air. Democracy, we agreed some time ago, cleared the way for
  superiority. So, too, this Imperialism of ours will clear the way for great
  Art by withering all that is petty and unreal. There is a profound maxim of
  S. Augustine's, 'Ubi magnitudo, ibi veritas,'&mdash;a maxim which, like all
  truths, is equally true in its converse. Greatness and truth in Art must walk
  hand in hand. And this vision brings with it a new hope, and without hope
  there is no enduring quality in any mortal work. Art demands in its creator
  an abounding optimism and vitality. He must see beyond all the tangles and
  deserts of the way to the ultimate city on its hill-top, and he must go
  singing on his pilgrimage.</p>

  <p>"This new world, again, is not only a world of cities but of wilds. We
  have grown deplorably urban in our civilisation. We still talk of nature, but
  it is a garden-nature, and its interest for us is only in its bearing upon
  our petty life. We are always on the watch for the 'pathetic fallacy,' and we
  read into the inanimate world some trivial human moral. But nature, equally
  with man, is the cipher of the Divine, and we shall never fathom it until we
  learn that it has a key of its own.</p>

  <p>"I mean," said Mrs Deloraine, looking up from her notes, "that we want a
  new poetry of nature, nature in its simplicity and vastness and savagery. Our
  modern civilisation, with its suburban country, gives us no scope for getting
  at the heart of the great forces which endure when we and all our work have
  perished. We take them as a pious opinion, something to make phrases about,
  but what chance does our normal life hold of any true communion? An ampler
  and newer earth will bring us back to the beginning of things. We shall feel
  the spray on our faces from antediluvian seas, and our lips will be salt with
  their brine. Our great poet when he arises will not be a Wordsworth, for he
  will be too bowed down with the wonder of it all to have any desire to read
  into it a system of philosophy. He will look on the world, I fancy, as Homer
  must have looked on that youthful world of his, rejoicing in its marvels, and
  seeing in them the working of some ageless plan, and yet facing it all with
  that frank human hope which tells him that neither space nor time can conquer
  the spirit.</p>

  <p>"But there is no hope without mystery. The horizon must not be too clear
  if the adventurer is to have the true joy of his enterprise. Something
  magical and beautiful must lurk behind the twilight haze. Art cannot rise to
  the heights, except in the consciousness of a destiny too infinite to be
  expressed in formulas. We have tried our best to materialise life. We have
  stifled it with prudential maxims, we have turned policy into a
  profit-and-loss account, and we have striven to analyse and docket the
  aspirations of the human heart. And we have failed, grossly and finally.
  Science, once the ally of the economists, has ranged herself on the side of
  the poets. It is because Imperialism gives us a world whose boundaries no man
  can define that it ministers especially to the needs of Art. You remember the
  chorus in the <i>Bacchae</i>:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">'Knowledge, we are not foes!<br>
  I seek thee diligently;<br>
  But the world with a great wind blows,<br>
  Shining, and not from thee;<br>
  Blowing to beautiful things,<br>
  On, amid dark and light,<br>
  Till Life, through the trammellings<br>
  Of Laws that are not the Right,<br>
  Breaks clean and pure, and sings<br>
  Glorying to God on the height!*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>Bacchae</i>, 1007-1010 (Mr Gilbert Murray's
  translation).</p><br>

  <p>"But this creed of ours has a vertical as well as a horizontal extension.
  It not only carries the few into a wider world, but it carries all classes in
  the State. In the true sense it is democratic, for its ends can only be
  attained by the union of all citizens. It cries out for a new sense of civic
  duty, a richer and more enduring ideal of civic well-being. Politics will
  cease to be the hobby of the few and become the duty and the privilege of
  all. So, too, the Art which is to come to fruit in such a State must be, as
  all great Art has been, a democratic thing. Art has never truly flourished
  when it was the perquisite of a class or a sect. The minor poet who creates a
  little garden of his own, and declares that no vulgar wind from the outer
  world shall ever shake his rose-trees, stands confessed by his declaration
  as eternally second-rate. If a man has not the wit to be a citizen he has
  still less the wit to be an artist. In an empire inspired throughout with a
  corporate ideal we shall recapture for our Art something of the immortal
  simplicity of the Greek spirit, which did not disdain the market-place or the
  schools or the battlefield. Our Muse must put off her modish silks and gems,
  which so quickly tarnish, and go out like a beggar-maid to the highways of
  the world. But in the end she will find far nobler jewels, for in her eyes
  there will be starlight and on her brow the glory of morning.</p>

  <p>"But, as I have already said, we must carry into the new world all that is
  best in our past. For Art at bottom is conservative. The laws of her kingdom
  are immutable, though her subjects change and her boundaries expand. The
  categories remain the same though their content may alter. This morning I
  went fishing in a meadow on the edge of the downs. Angling has long been a
  classic sport, and Izaak Walton ages ago gave it a certain literary
  atmosphere. When I think of a trout-stream I think of the Lea or the
  Dove&mdash;English meadows, with clear, slow-flowing water, little fishing-
  houses on the bank, old country inns to lodge at, milkmaids and gipsy
  choruses, and Corydon's song among the willows. Or I think of some Scotch
  burn falling in golden pools, overhung with rowanberries, with the scent of
  thyme and heather around, and all the magic of long tradition. But my fishing
  to-day was a revelation. Only the big trout and the clear water and the
  limpid air belonged to my old picture. I cast my flies over strange flowers,
  and the birds which I stirred were not larks or curlews. My gillie was a
  Masai hunter, who carried a gun in case of meeting wild animals. And when I
  stopped to rest and looked round, I did not see English woodlands or a Scotch
  glen, but the immense mystical panorama of Equatoria. I realised how, even in
  a little thing like a sport, it was only the essentials that mattered, and
  that it might be carried to any clime, provided the spirit remained
  unchanged. It seemed to me a kind of parable for Art. She may trim her sails
  and set her helm for new seas, but the ship and the compass are the same as
  of old. Abana and Pharpar are running rivers like Jordan. And though the
  waters are strange, and wilder forests clothe unfamiliar hills, she will
  still hear the pipes of Pan among the trees, and in some secret glade have
  sight of Venus and the sister nymphs&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">'Panaque, Silvanumque senem, Nymphasque sorores.'"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">Vergil, <i>Georgics</i> 2.490.<br>
  And Pan, and old Silvanus, and the sister Nymphs</p><br>

  <p>Mrs Deloraine paused and looked deprecatingly at the company. "I am afraid
  that what I have had to say has been very confused and schwärmerisch. Perhaps
  I can put it better in verse, for I am more accustomed to write in that form
  than in prose. I have here a kind of dialogue between Youth and the Spirit of
  Art, in which the same idea appears as I have been trying to expound. May I
  read it, if it does not bore you?"</p>

  <p>Being assured of the attention of her audience, Mrs Deloraine read the
  following poem:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse"><b>Youth</b>.<br>
  <br>
  Angel of love and light and truth,<br>
  In whose deep eyes the stars are set,<br>
  And in whose calm unchanging youth,<br>
  The mysteries of the world have met,<br>
  <br>
  What means thy forward-beckoning hand,<br>
  The steadfast brow, the enraptur'd gaze,<br>
  They point me to a lonely land&mdash;<br>
  I cannot pierce the twilight haze.<br>
  <br>
  With thee of old I walked at noon<br>
  In gardens where the airs were kind,<br>
  And from thy lips I read the rune<br>
  Of joy in every wave and wind.<br>
  <br>
  We roamed blue hills of far romance,<br>
  We worshipped at the ancient shrines:<br>
  For us the oreads joined their dance<br>
  At even in the moonlit pines.<br>
  <br>
  What darkling spell has rent thy skies<br>
  And turned thy heart to steel and fire,<br>
  And drawn across thy starry eyes<br>
  The curtains of a wild desire!<br>
  <br>
  <b>The Spirit Of Art.</b><br>
  <br>
  I change not. I am old as Time<br>
  And younger than the dews of morn.<br>
  Those lips will sing the world's high prime<br>
  Which blessed the toils when life was born.<br>
  <br>
  I am the priestess of the flame<br>
  Which on the eternal altar springs;<br>
  Beauty and truth and joy and fame<br>
  Sleep in the shelter of my wings.<br>
  <br>
  I wear the mask of age and clime,<br>
  But he who of my love is fain<br>
  Must learn my heart which knows not time,<br>
  And seek my path which fears not pain,&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  Till, bruised and worn with wandering<br>
  In the dark wilds my feet have trod,<br>
  He hears the songs the Immortals sing<br>
  At even in the glades of God.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Youth</b>.<br>
  <br>
  Angel, that heart I seek to know,<br>
  I fain would make thy word my stay,<br>
  Upon thy path I yearn to go<br>
  If thy clear eyes will light the way.<br>
  <br>
  But ancient loves my memory hold,<br>
  And I am weak and thou art strong;<br>
  I fear the blasts of outland cold,&mdash;<br>

  <b>The Spirit Of Art.</b><br>
  <br>

  <br>
  That joy I give, but frail and poor<br>
  Is such a boon, for youth must die;<br>
  A little day the flowers endure,<br>
  And clouds o'erride the April sky.<br>
  <br>
  Upon the windy ways of life,<br>
  In dark abyss of toil and wrong,<br>
  Through storm and sun, through death and strife,<br>
  I seek the nobler spheral song.<br>
  <br>
  No dulcet lute with golden strings<br>
  Can hymn the world that is to be.<br>
  Out of the jarring soul of things<br>
  I weave the eternal harmony.&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  In forest deeps, in wastes of sand,<br>
  Where the cold snows outdare the skies:<br>
  Where wanderers roam uncharted lands,<br>
  And the last camp-fire flares and dies:<br>
  <br>
  In sweating mart, in camp and court,<br>
  Where hopes forlorn have vanquished ease:<br>
  Where ships, intent on desperate port,<br>
  Strain through the quiet of lonely seas:<br>
  <br>
  Where'er o'erborne by sense and sin,<br>
  With bruised head and aching hand,<br>
  Guarding the holy fire within,<br>
  Man dares to steel his heart and stand&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  Breasting the serried spears of fate,<br>
  Broken and spent, yet joyous still,<br>
  Matching against the blind world's hate<br>
  The stark battalions of his will:&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  Whoso hath ears, to him shall fall,<br>
  When stars are hid and hopes are dim,<br>
  To hear the heavenly voices call,<br>
  And, faint and far, the cosmic hymn&mdash;<br>
  <br>
  That hymn of peace when wars are done,<br>
  Of joy which breaks through tears of pain,<br>
  Of dawns beyond the westering sun,<br>
  Of skies clear shining after rain.<br>
  <br>
  No sinless Edens know the song,<br>
  No Arcady of youth and light,<br>
  But, born amid the glooms of wrong,<br>
  It floats upon the glimmering height,<br>
  <br>
  Where they who faced the dust and scars,<br>
  And shrank not from the fires of hate,<br>
  Can walk among the kindred stars,<br>
  Master of Time and lords of Fate.<br>
  <br>
  And haply then will youth, reborn,<br>
  Restore the world thou fain wouldst hold;<br>
  The dawn of an auguster morn<br>
  Will flush thy skies with fairy gold.<br>
  <br>
  The flute of Pan in wild-wood glade<br>
  Will pipe its ancient sweet refrain;<br>
  Still, still for thee through April shade<br>
  Will Venus and her sister train<br>
  <br>
  Lead the old dance of spring and youth.<br>
  But thine the wiser, clearer eyes,<br>
  Which having sought the shrine of truth<br>
  And faced the unending sacrifice,<br>
  <br>
  Can see the myriad ways of man,<br>
  The ecstasy, the fire, the rod,<br>
  As shadows of the timeless plan<br>
  That broods within the mind of God.<br>
  <br>

  Thy pride thy bonds, thy bonds release;<br>
  Thou see'st the Eternal passing by,<br>

  <p>Mr Wakefield had listened to Mrs Deloraine's theories of art with an
  interested but puzzled expression. He was so wholly under the spell of her
  charm that he was prepared to take every word she uttered for gospel, and his
  sense of the ridiculous, which made him explosive in the presence of the
  transcendental, was rapidly perishing from disuse. A strenuous career at the
  Bar, and a middle age spent mainly in fiscal controversy, had not fitted him
  to appreciate a discourse on aesthetic. But he was cheerful and
  congratulatory about the poem.</p>

  <p>"I know what you mean by a background of mystery," he said. "I wish I
  could take you up with me to the great lakes and forests of our northern
  country, and show you some of our voyageurs. You might make a lot out of
  them. I think you are perfectly right in saying that what poetry wants is a
  fresh subject, and not something that has been hammered at by every poet
  since King David. I can no more read Tennyson than I can drink stagnant
  water."</p>

  <p>Mrs Deloraine looked a little aghast at this version of her conclusions.
  Sir Edward, whose eyes had a far-away look, said abruptly from a dark
  corner&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do you know that what you have been saying is what I have been trying to
  think out for a long time? It is what distinguishes our own people from any
  other breed of pioneer. We won't admit any hard-and-fast line between the
  known and the unknown, and so our horizon is always a little misty. The
  Frenchman wants to draw a clear line and say that all on one side is
  civilisation, and all on the other side is barbarism, and he doesn't care a
  cent what becomes of it. He wants a cosy self-contained little kingdom,
  because at heart he fears the wilds, while we love them. Our people won't
  admit any final march where they must stop short and pitch their tents. They
  must always be pushing on and possessing some new country. And therefore
  there is no limit to their hopes, for any evening may bring them to the Land
  of Promise. There's a lot in that if you think it over. I don't know much
  about art, but I am sure Mrs Deloraine and I mean the same thing."</p>

  <p>Mr Lowenstein intervened as if to rescue the unfortunate lady from
  Philistine approval.</p>

  <p>"You have said many beautiful and convincing things, for which I am very
  grateful. Our difficulty as Imperialists has always been that, though the
  common people may hear us gladly, the elect will shrug their shoulders and
  turn away. We are in danger of making Imperialism purely what Mr Wakefield
  calls 'a business proposition,' and therefore of identifying it with an arid,
  mercantile view of life. The people who love beauty&mdash;the artists, the
  scholars, the poets &mdash;will behave towards it like a well-dressed woman
  towards a street accident&mdash;cast a glance of pity or dislike, and then
  pass by on the other side. I almost think that our most urgent duty is to
  insist upon the spiritual renaissance at the back of everything. For,
  properly regarded, our creed is a religion, and we must hold it with the
  fervour of a convert."</p>

  <p>Lord Launceston abandoned his seat by the window and came forward into the
  firelight to get himself a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I think I agree with most of your conclusions," he said, looking down at
  Mrs Deloraine; "but you will not think me dull if I put the thing more
  prosaically. We seek to show that empire is not antagonistic to a high
  spiritual development. I think we can go further and prove that it may be a
  positive aid. But when we have said that, we must be careful of going
  further. For Imperialism is in its essence a political thing. It is concerned
  with man as a political animal, man in the social aspect, and not directly
  with the spiritual life of the citizen. It provides a fuller basis for art
  and morality, and, I think I may add, religion, but in itself it is none of
  these things. It deals&mdash;it must deal&mdash;mainly with the formal side
  of life. I grant you willingly that the tendency is for the <i>vie intime</i>
  of any man to be more closely knit to the communal life. But there must
  always remain something which no state, however noble in its character, can
  give&mdash;that inner peace and satisfaction of the soul. Many of us, I
  think, tend to exalt Imperialism to too high a plane, and seek in a political
  ideal that which belongs only to what, in the widest sense of the word, we
  call religion. This seems to me a very real danger. For if we make claims for
  our creed which it cannot fulfil, sooner or later we shall discredit it. No
  alchemy can turn the stones of our dream-city into bread for the hungry."</p>

  <p>Mrs Deloraine cried out in warm approval. "I am so glad to hear you say
  that, for it is what I should have liked to add if I had thought my subject
  allowed of it. I feel that the overstatement of our creed is one of the
  gravest perils which it has to face. We must maintain that it has its
  spiritual aspect, but we dare not claim that in itself it will satisfy the
  eternal cravings of the spirit. We may make a new earth, a prosperous and
  happy and civilised earth, but if our citizens can look no further they will
  be worse off than at the beginning. The poor man even now, broken by want and
  disease, who can declare in his last hours that his Redeemer liveth, has
  reached a spiritual height to which no ideal citizenship of itself can ever
  rise. I do not wish to preach about those viewless things on which we all
  must make our peace with our own souls, but I ask that we recognise their
  profundity, and do not attempt to allot them to a creed which has no answer
  to make to them."</p>

  <p>"That is the most sensible thing I have heard you say, Barbara." The
  Duchess had slept peacefully through the earlier discussion, and had awakened
  in time to be shocked by Mr Lowenstein. "Don't you see that if you confound
  religion with politics you are falling into the very blunder which you were
  kind enough to say was the favourite pastime of my party? You will vulgarise
  the one and sentimentalise the other. I am old-fashioned enough to think it
  impious, and, what is more to the purpose, it is extremely silly. There is a
  kind of disease in men's minds which compels them to break down all the
  common-sense boundary-fences and to turn every nostrum into a complete
  philosophy of life. Why can't they be content with the Here and leave the
  Hereafter to its proper exponents? Tories like Caroline are always telling me
  that politics have no principles and are wholly opportunist, but if they were
  faithful to their creed they would never try to stretch the bounds of
  politics so wide that they include provinces like religion where opportunism
  is unthinkable."</p>

  <p>The Duchess turned a friendly eye upon Mr Wakefield, in whom she believed
  she would find a supporter. Mr Wakefield, however, was too much a devotee of
  Mrs Deloraine to be willing to argue with his wonted brusqueness on a side
  where he was uncertain of her sympathies. He took refuge in a
  distinction.</p>

  <p>"Of course you are right, generally speaking, but then Imperialism is not
  quite an ordinary political creed. We have already defined it as an attitude
  of mind, and that implies some sort of philosophy of life. I think Mrs
  Deloraine has made the distinction clear. It gives us a better basis for art
  and religion, but it does not take the place of one or the other. I think
  that is true, although, as I have often said, I am mortally afraid of getting
  too high-falutin on the subject. I detest mysticism and want to keep close
  to fact, but at the same time that is no reason why I should make our creed
  narrower than it really is. There are many who will prefer the dessert to the
  joint, and by all means let them have it if it is in the bill of fare. The
  instinct of empire is towards comprehension, not exclusion."</p>

  <p>"Mr Wakefield has suggested the true parallel," said Lord Appin, who had
  listened to Mrs Deloraine with grave approval. "We do not profess to teach a
  religion, but, if we are not theologians, we are in a sense ecclesiastics.
  The state, remember, has now taken the place of the mediaeval church. Once we
  had popes and bishops supervising the lives of their flock and making
  themselves sponsors for their spiritual well-being. But their pride crumbled,
  because they fell into that very error against which Lord Launceston has been
  warning us, and sought to imprison the longings of the human spirit within
  the narrow walls of creed and ritual. Religion has triumphantly proved itself
  stronger than ecclesiasticism, and to-day we see a revolt&mdash;perhaps an
  unwise revolt&mdash;against all that savours of formality. And yet man cannot
  advance except through organised action, and if his Church is destroyed under
  one guise he will revive it under another. The Church in the Middle Ages had
  three great attributes. In the first place it was a brotherhood, a body of
  men linked together by a common faith. Again, it was inspired by an ideal
  which was professedly spiritual, a creed where success or failure was defined
  by other than material standards. Lastly, it was surrounded by an alien and
  hostile world, so that its members were drawn close to each other, and filled
  with a zeal which, according to our view of history, we label missionary or
  intolerant. That old church can never be re-established, for we have
  travelled too far from the sanctions which gave it strength. But we can no
  more do without a church than without a religion. Only we have learned
  nowadays that the true and lasting work for which such an organisation is
  adapted is rather political than doctrinal, and that the Seal of the
  Fisherman is better affixed to state decrees than to edicts against
  conscience. I maintain that our view of empire gives that empire something of
  the character of a church. We are a brotherhood banded together in a common
  quest. Our union, if less mystic than that which Augustine preached, has yet
  in it something not wholly human, not merely the sum of individual effort. In
  the midst of all our failures the work advances, for the plan is greater than
  the builders. Above all, we must achieve our desires in face of a stubborn
  and alien world. All around us are the frontiers of barbarism&mdash;I use the
  word as the Greeks used it. It is this environment which will perfect our
  brotherhood and give us something of the old crusading fervour. And if we
  have this clear purpose, not untouched with emotion, our empire will be
  another, and more truly Catholic, church. Then&mdash;to use Plato's
  phrase&mdash;the quest of truth will not lack the warmth of desire."</p>

  <p>The party had hitherto been sitting in darkness, broken only by the glow
  from the hearth and Mrs Deloraine's lamp. Now the lights were turned on and
  there was a general shifting of seats. Lady Flora, who had sat with exemplary
  patience through the long discussion, discovered that only a walk on the
  terrace would be sufficient reward, and carried off Hugh and Mr Wakefield in
  her train. Soon wild laughter and the barking of small terriers showed that
  some mischief was afoot.</p>

  <p>"What I feel about all that has been said to-night," said Mrs Yorke
  wearily, "and about everything that you all have said since you came here, is
  that Imperialism promises to be a very exhausting faith. It demands a superb
  vitality like Flora's or Sir Edward's. We are all to live at high pressure.
  We must try all our easy-going beliefs by a new touchstone, we must forget
  all our comfortable cliches, and we must never weary in well-doing. For the
  young, I grant you, it is an inspiring creed, but for a woman drawing towards
  middle life it is&mdash;well, exacting."</p>

  <p>"So is any creed worth the name," said Carey. "They are all counsels of
  perfection, requiring us to strain every nerve for their fulfilment. Of
  course we tire and slacken, but our energy revives if we have got the true
  fire in our hearts. As for growing old, I do not believe in the thing. If our
  vitality sinks in one direction it increases in another. You are a much more
  active man now, Appin, than when in your youth you slumbered peacefully on
  the right hand of the Woolsack. We can no longer climb mountains like
  Astbury, or go lion-hunting like Teddy, but we make up for it by getting rid
  of the preoccupations which distract the young. Wise men never grow up;
  indeed, they grow younger, for they lose the appalling worldly wisdom of
  youth. Wakefield, for example ..."</p>

  <p>But at this moment Lady Flora came in breathlessly from the verandah.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Aunt Susan, do you know what those extraordinary men are doing? They
  have made a kind of toboggan and are glissading down the steep part of the
  lawn into the Dutch garden. I daren't try it, for I know I should ruin my
  gown."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

  <p class="first">LADY FLORA woke early, before daybreak, and found it
  impossible to go to sleep again. The strange foreglow of dawn looked so
  attractive that she dressed and descended a silent staircase to the inner
  hall, where already the houseboys were beginning their labours. The verandahs
  were still in dusk, but when she had crossed the terrace and reached the
  lawns on the edge of the hill she came into a patch of pale sunlight and
  found that the skies were clear and that the sun was rising over the crest of
  the downs. The place intoxicated her, so quiet it was, so cool and fresh and
  dewy. She drank great draughts of the delicious air, and wondered why she had
  never discovered the charm of early rising before. At this hour most people
  were still wrapt in dull slumber with a doleful getting-up before them when
  the natural hour should have passed and the world become noisy and common. In
  this airy clime one's thoughts must perforce be clear and beautiful. Even a
  flower-pot looked an exquisite thing with the dew on it and the gold of
  sunrise on the dew. It occurred to her that it might be well if life were to
  be so rearranged that all the things which mattered were done before
  breakfast. Or it might be enough, she reflected, if one could attain to this
  morning frame of mind and keep it unsullied at all hours. Some creed might
  give this, or some great passion. And as the girl wandered through the
  ineffable colours of the awakening day she thought very deeply.</p>

  <p>Hugh, coming back from an early gallop on the moor, found her sitting on a
  sunny corner of a parapet absorbed in thought. His horse shied at the
  apparition, and the rider, who had been half in a dream himself, promptly
  came off and disappeared in a bed of lilies. The horse began to graze
  peaceably, and Hugh, emerging dishevelled and surprised, found that the Muse
  of Contemplation had changed into a laughing girl.</p>

  <p>"'The lark now leaves his watery nest,'" she quoted. "When you have shaken
  your 'dewy wing,' Mr Somerville, you might get one of the garden boys to take
  back the horse to the stable and come for a walk with me. I've been up since
  before daybreak, and I don't a bit want to go back yet."</p>

  <p>Hugh commandeered the services of the nearest gardener, and with Lady
  Flora wandered back across the lawn.</p>

  <p>"What brought you out of doors at this time?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Restlessness and this glorious morning. And, once out, I made up my mind
  that I must find a creed. I had nearly got one when you came tumbling off
  your horse among the lilies. Do you remember the contract we made our second
  day here? You were to explain to me all the things I could not understand.
  Well, I haven't bothered you much, for I found I was cleverer than I thought,
  and I followed most of the discussions quite easily. But last night Barbara
  stumped me completely. It wasn't so much what she said, for I understood her
  meaning more or less, but she and all the others seemed to find so much more
  in it than I could see. I am not an artist of any kind, or ever likely to be,
  but I agree with her argument about the new field for art which empire gives.
  And of course it makes life pleasanter all round to have big horizons and a
  great deal to do. But in spite of all that Lord Launceston said, I think we
  are making more out of the creed than reason allows. Though we deny it in
  words, yet we behave as if this were a new religion instead of merely a
  better groundwork for one. We can't turn politics into something which
  satisfies all our longings and fills all our life."</p>

  <p>Hugh looked gravely at his companion. "You have your aunt's appalling
  clearness of mind. I agree with every word you say. What next?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I want to know how I am to find the <i>trait d'union</i>? For I
  have become an Imperialist, you know. I have got an interest so absorbing
  that I do not think I can ever be bored again. I suppose there are things I
  can do to help, for you said that in our new state no one would be left out
  of citizenship. But Barbara and Mr Carey and Lord Launceston&mdash;but
  especially Barbara&mdash;make me feel as if Imperialism shaded off into all
  manner of beautiful and far-off things, and I can't see it. I have my own
  private dreams, but they are my own, and I can't fit them in with politics. I
  wish I could, for I am sure the happiest people have only one creed which
  covers everything in their lives."</p>

  <p>Hugh began to laugh, but stopped short at the sight of the girl's serious
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Please forgive me. I didn't mean to be rude, but I was never so surprised
  before. What you want is a synthetic philosophy, and that you should want it
  and know that you want it staggers me. You are a very remarkable young
  woman."</p>

  <p>"I will not be treated like a child," said Lady Flora indignantly, "and I
  will not have philosophy talked to me. I agree with Mr Wakefield that
  metaphysics are a bore, and only useful in staving off a difficult question.
  I have no more a desire for a synthetic philosophy than for the moon. But you
  might give me a Christian answer."</p>

  <p>"I have given it you. You must find a philosophy, and it will take years
  in the finding. Don't you see, Lady Flora, that your question goes to the
  very root of all things? We want a key to life, an ideal which will leave out
  nothing and completely satisfy the hunger in our hearts. When you were a
  child and invented fairylands you brought into them everything you
  loved&mdash;cats and dogs and toys and people&mdash;and so with the bigger
  fairyland we make when we grow up. Everything shades sooner or later into
  metaphysics, and the humblest difficulty&mdash;if we press it
  home&mdash;brings us within hailing distance of the Infinite. Well, I have no
  philosophy to teach you. Lord Appin to-night is going to give us what he
  calls 'some elementary notes on the speculative basis' of Imperialism, and I
  hope you will be very kind and keep Mr Wakefield quiet in a corner. But no
  ready-made philosophy will be of any use to you. If you and I were great
  geniuses we might sit down and think it all out from the beginning, but we
  have neither the time nor the patience for that. But the synthesis, remember,
  must either be made honestly by ourselves or come to us as a slow
  distillation from experience. Years, you know, bring the philosophic mind,
  and a certain unity creeps into life without our knowing it. Mrs Deloraine is
  absorbed in art, and she is also in love with a new political creed, and the
  two merge in a common ideal. So with Carey. His interest in empire is so
  consuming that everything in his life is brought into line with it. It is not
  the result of a conscious philosophy, for the thing is psychological rather
  than logical. The nexus is the human character."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Lady Flora, "that sounds as if it might be true. So you advise
  me not to trouble about the high-falutin side, but to leave that to my old
  age. And yet&mdash;I don't know. A morning like this makes one feel as if it
  were the only side that mattered. And after all, unless we can keep the
  morning freshness we must fail, for to create our new world we must have
  uncommon vitality."</p>

  <p>"We must have vitality, but each must get it as best he can. We all of us,
  if we are to keep up our heads in the world, must have some secret fountain
  of youth within us. But an arbitrary unification of life will only choke the
  springs. Wakefield said a thing to me at the beginning of our visit, and I am
  daily growing more convinced of its truth. He said that all Imperialists
  would add their own poetry to the facts, but that it was only on the facts
  themselves that we could expect agreement, and if we tried to dogmatise on
  the poetry we should quarrel at once. So by all means let us try to be
  prosaic, for I don't think any of us will sink too deeply into prose."</p>

  <p>"Mr Wakefield said that? What a wise old Philistine he is! He has asked me
  to go and stay with him next year in Canada. He says that people will call me
  either 'Lady Brune' or 'Flora,' and that I shall be an enormous success. And
  we are going out to camp in the northern woods, and fish the lakes, and
  voyage in canoes, and have the time of our lives ... Oh, by the by, Mr
  Somerville, you know you promised me a motto for my journal of our trek. It
  must be Greek, to look learned, and it must be about camping. Have you found
  one?"</p>

  <p>Hugh rummaged in the pockets of his coat. "Yes&mdash;the very thing you
  want. It's Greek&mdash;latish to be sure, and it comes out of the Anthology.
  The sportsman who wrote it was called Antiphilus of Byzantium, and flourished
  in the reign of the Emperor Nero. I have done a sort of translation, rather
  rough and free. Here it is:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Give me a mat on the deck<br>
  When the awnings sound to the blows of the spray,<br>
  And the hearthstones crack with the flames a-back,<br>
  And the pot goes bubbling away.<br>
  Give me a boy to cook my broth,<br>
  For table a ship's plank laid with a cloth<br>
  (But never a fork or knife);<br>
  And after a game with a rusty pack,<br>
  The bo'sun's whistle to call us back&mdash;<br>
  That's the fortune fit for a king,<br>
  For oh! I love common life!"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Anth. Pal. ix. 546.</p><br>

  <p>After dinner, by a general impulse the party sought the library, where
  Lord Appin ensconced himself in the central arm-chair.</p>

  <p>"I don't want any lamp," he said, "for I have nothing to read. My
  business, as I threatened long ago, is to try to put to you the fundamental
  question in Imperialism. If we cannot make good our defence on it, then we
  have surrendered the key of the position.</p>

  <p>"But first of all, there are a few preliminaries to be got over, and I am
  afraid I must take you through some elementary philosophy. I apologise to
  you, Launceston, for what must seem very trite and obvious; but unless one
  condescends to platitudes now and then, there must be gaps in the argument.
  Let me relieve Mr Wakefield's mind by saying that I am not going to talk
  Hegelianism or any other creed. What I have to say is admitted by all
  philosophers, and belongs to the world's common stock of speculation.</p>

  <p>"I remember that once in my public career I was twitted with being a
  philosopher in politics. My critic urged that philosophy unfitted a man for
  making the clear distinctions which are the working hypotheses of life. Good
  is good, he said, to the average man, and bad is bad, and on the distinction
  depends the moral life. Progress and reform are real and ascertained
  benefits, and on this assumption the State is governed. But the philosopher,
  he went on, will tell you that black is black only because in some sense it
  is also white; that vice is only virtue regarded from another plane of
  thought; that there is no truth in this or that isolated dogma, but only in
  something which he calls a system; that progress is illusory, since reaction
  may be one of the forms through which the Infinite is moving towards
  realisation. All differences are smoothed away by him in some trumpery
  unification, and yet it is on the reality of these differences that human
  aspirations and human happiness depend. Therefore, my critic argued, the
  philosopher must be kept out of politics like a bull out of a china shop, for
  if he have a persuasive tongue he will end by corrupting the manhood of the
  nation. I remember that he became quite witty on the subject. 'Let us
  remove,' he cried, 'such philosophers from public life. There are places
  already appointed for their reception. Lunatic asylum is a vulgar word, so
  let us change their name to contemplative retreats. There let them live,
  happy and well cared for, hobnobbing with the Infinite, and leave the
  management of human affairs to unsophisticated human nature!'</p>

  <p>"My friend would have been surprised could he have known how cordially I
  agreed with him. The philosopher has no business in politics, unless he can
  bring himself to the mode of thinking which that province requires. The
  pastime of bursting old, but valuable, bottles by putting new wine into them
  will not commend itself to the sane man. Then what is the mode of thinking
  which is proper to the political life?</p>

  <p>"I do not propose to trace the history of thought from its first
  psychological embryo. Let us take the stage where it is manifest to all the
  world, the stage which is indicated when we speak of a man's having common-
  sense, or a practical mind, or a great intelligence. I do not wish to use
  German words, so let us call it the sphere of the Understanding. Now the
  essence of this mode of thought is that it insists upon clear divisions, upon
  the distinctions rather than upon any fundamental unity in things. A vast
  datum is presented to it by experience, and its business is to classify and
  arrange that datum. The distinctions which the Mind makes it regards as hard
  and fast&mdash;it must, for it has to act upon them. It acknowledges
  principles of union within such data, but the union is mechanical and
  external, like the classification of devices in heraldry. It refuses to
  theorise, to go one step further in its synthesis than practical needs
  require. Let us take some of the ordinary political counters. Law, for
  example, is not and does not profess to be complete justice. It is a working
  solution under which certain things are called right and certain things are
  labelled wrong, and have appropriate penalties attached. The good lawyer is
  he who can make the most of the mechanical unity within such a system; not he
  who pushes the analysis too far, and gets into metaphysics. But legal dogmas,
  such as they are, must be treated as final; the half-way house of thought
  must be regarded as the ultimate goal. Or take Liberty, that old
  will-o'-the-wisp of man. The Understanding, looking to the common needs of
  the State, declares that on one point the individual shall be untrammelled,
  and on another restricted. It does not examine the conception which is
  provided for it; it only takes steps to give it a practical meaning. So too
  with other general conceptions, such as education, national character, or the
  welfare of the people. The Understanding does not consider the welfare of
  humanity at large, but of humanity in a particular area&mdash;the nation or
  the race. It demands always the practical test, for it is purely utilitarian.
  It is not cosmopolitan; it is British, or French, or Siamese.</p>

  <p>"The chief features, then, of this half-way house of thought are that the
  world is classified with sharp distinctions between the classes, that the
  distinguishing principle&mdash;race, liberty, law, anything you
  please&mdash;is something given to the mind and not examined by the mind, and
  lastly, that such distinctions are considered and acted upon as final. It is
  emphatically the sphere of the practical man. It does not confuse the common
  issues of life with any of the uncertainties of speculation. Its guiding
  principle is the law of the Sufficient Reason; it explains everything by
  something else. The world it creates for itself is orderly, logical, and free
  from any atmospheric haze. Such is the true world of politics, for it is the
  Understanding which makes states rich and well governed, and their citizens
  prosperous and contented. I have said that it is a world of compromise, but
  remember that most of the people who live in it see no compromise about the
  matter. It is for them a world of final and unalterable truths. I need not
  labour the point, for Lady Amysfort on the second day of our visit gave us an
  admirable exposition of this half-way house of the Understanding on its
  political side, and Mr Wakefield, if I may say so, is a living instance of
  it."</p>

  <p>Mr Wakefield, hearing his name mentioned, awoke from a short nap, and
  prepared to give Lord Appin his critical and hostile attention.</p>

  <p>"I shall not be accused of underestimating this most admirable attitude if
  I say that if it were universal the world would come to an end. Happily it is
  not universal, for there will always be many who, while insisting upon its
  merits, bring to it in practice a principle from another and a further stage
  of thought. Mr Wakefield, for example, would not be an Imperialist if he were
  content to dwell wholly in its confines. Its merits, let me repeat, are that
  it insists upon clear working distinctions, and that with its practical bias
  it looks always to facts, since its datum is Experience. Yes! But with
  Experience we admit at once one of the dynamic forces of revolution. I will
  not bring in any metaphysical doctrine of the Absolute Process of Thought. I
  will take this one recreating and reforming element in the sphere of the
  Understanding itself, that Experience which is its foundation. Sooner or
  later, as facts change, the change impresses itself even upon their formal
  interpretation. There will always be some who, living in the greater world of
  what, in contradistinction, we may call Reason, will be conscious from the
  start of the limitations of the Understanding; they will see its laws as
  compromises, its solutions as working hypotheses. Such men will be the mid
  wives of change, and their maieutic skill will be aided by the slow
  compulsion of Experience. There is a name for this compelling force which has
  been in common use since Plato&mdash;Dialectic. It is the sceptical
  dissolvent, the <i>inquiètude poussante</i>, which acts upon the dogmatism of
  the Understanding. Hegel has an instance from theology which I daresay Lord
  Launceston remembers. But please keep in mind that, though I use this
  illustration, I am not giving you Hegelianism, but one of the accepted
  platitudes of philosophy. We first of all, Hegel says, conceive of God as a
  remote but beneficent force. We see seed-time and harvest return, children
  born and growing gently to maturity, and God following a laissez-faire
  policy, and suffering nature to run smoothly in compartments. Then suddenly
  comes in Dialectic in the thunderstorm which ruins the crops, the plague
  which devastates the family, in the awful terror of the Unseen, and the
  mystery of an inscrutable Fate. We are shaken out of our ease, and know that
  the Lord is a jealous God, and that nature is careless of our pigmy life. And
  then, at the last, comes the reconciliation in the domain of Reason, when we
  learn that God is made one with man. With this final stage of the infinite
  Reason we have no concern to-night. Politics is a mundane and a dusty game at
  best, and does not call for the highest function of thought. Sometimes, it is
  true, the humblest among us have seasons of revelation when a new dawn
  flushes our prosaic sky, and we have a glimpse of a City without foundations,
  and aspire for a moment to...</p>

  <p class="verse">'... the shining table-lands<br>
  To which our God Himself is moon and sun."</p>

  <p class="first">A great seer or mystic will kindle a nation to pursue for a
  little an ideal, of which the Understanding knows nothing, and that
  patchwork, which we call our world, seems in very truth the garment of God.
  But these sublime imaginings are not for practical men such as Mr Wakefield
  and&mdash;<i>magno intervallo</i>&mdash; myself. In politics Dialectic acting
  upon the Understanding does not lead us, as Hegel's illustration suggests, to
  the deeper unity of the Reason, but only to a reformed Understanding in
  harmony with changed conditions. The right mode of political thinking, I
  repeat, is this sphere, where the manifold world of experience is broken up
  into a clear system, where distinctions are regarded as final, and where the
  practical end is never lost to view. But for those who would lead their
  generation the Understanding must be tinged by Dialectic, compromises must be
  seen as such, and the coercive force of change which resides in experience
  must be aided and abetted. The result, as I have said, will be only another
  world of the Understanding, but the datum will have been revised. So in a
  roundabout way, and from a different side, we get back to the definition of
  Imperialism which we reached quite early in our stay here. We claim as our
  attitude this dialectical Understanding, or, in other words, while we
  needlessly destroy no one of the distinctions which compose our traditional
  creed, we desire to rethink them in the light of a new world."</p>

  <p>"It is an extraordinary thing," said the Duchess, "how much wisdom there
  is in ordinary political labels. I should have said that Caroline and you,
  Bob, though you both call yourselves Conservatives, were at the opposite
  poles of opinion, and yet, when you come to a frank confession, you reach
  almost the same conclusion. I am not at all certain that I don't agree with
  you. Only, what I feel about your definition of Imperialism is that it does
  not distinguish it from any other sound political creed. You define it by the
  attitude of mind which it implies&mdash;clearness, practicality, an adequate
  recognition of the conditions of policy. But the Liberal might say the same
  thing of his faith, and the Conservative, and the Socialist. There is no
  serious politician alive who would not subscribe to the formula."</p>

  <p>"Most true, Susan, but I have not nearly done with my definition. The
  attitude I have described belongs to all sane and practical
  creeds&mdash;creeds, that is to say, which incline neither to reaction nor to
  revolution. No faith which claims to be in tune with the spirit of its age
  would dare to disavow it. No; the difference is between those who hold the
  belief merely as a pious opinion and those who are prepared to act
  strenuously upon it. The difference, that is to say, lies in the rigour of
  our examination of our data. We Imperialists, whatever our political labels
  at home, are confronted with two alternatives. A huge empire has grown up
  around us, full of problems on which we can gain little light from our
  precedent history. We cannot deny the existence of that empire and those
  problems: so far we are all agreed. But we may regard it as an encumbrance, a
  menace to our older traditions; or we may see in it a hope of a richer and
  better public life, where greater responsibilities are counterbalanced by
  nobler rewards. To be an Imperialist demands two things&mdash;the eye to
  discern the new conditions and the will to accept them."</p>

  <p>"Do you argue, then," said Hugh, "that the opposition we have to face is
  due not to intellectual blindness, but to moral lethargy?"</p>

  <p>"Not to moral lethargy in the best cases, but to a quite honest and
  logical fidelity to a doctrine which I believe to be false. Our opponents may
  be divided into two classes. One class admits that these new conditions may
  be valuable, and that Imperialism is a beautiful dream; but they add that it
  is impossible. It is beyond the power of humanity, they argue, to construct
  such a state. Now, I am far from advocating impracticable ideals. It is a
  perfectly good answer to any proposal to say that it is impossible. But we
  must be careful how we admit the defence <i>propter infirmitatem</i>. If it
  were a question of building out of the void a Utopia where war should be
  unknown and property held in common, I should declare it impossible, because
  it would demand a revolution in human nature and human methods so complete as
  to be inconceivable. But when we are given the foundations to build on and
  the materials are ready to our hand, and the only further requirements are
  intelligence and vitality in the builders, then to say that the work is too
  hard to attempt is a confession of moral lethargy. It is not political
  wisdom, but political cowardice.</p>

  <p>"The other class have a more formidable defence. They altogether deny the
  value of the new conditions and the new ideal. They complain that a vast
  material extension has no organic relation to national well-being. Britain,
  they say, owns one-fourth of the territory of the globe, rules one-fourth of
  the population, and conducts one-third of the trade; but she is no greater on
  that account than if she possessed not a rood outside the British Islands. In
  a word, they deny that principle which I have always maintained to lie at the
  very root of Imperialism&mdash;the need of a quantitative basis for
  qualitative development.</p>

  <p>"Let me try to state their case as fairly as I can. No state, they say,
  owes its greatness in any real sense to its material equipment. Russia may
  govern from the Baltic to the Behring Sea and yet be an inferior power to
  Germany. Themistocles will always defeat Xerxes, and rich Carthage must yield
  in the end to poverty-stricken Rome. The claim of Britain to a great place in
  the world is due to the liberties which she has evolved in her long history;
  to a constitution which has been a model for all free nations; to her
  propaganda on behalf of humanity and liberalism; to the vitality of her sons
  who have led the way in exploration and invention and adventure. It is true
  that great wealth and great possessions have been the result, but they are
  the accidents, not the springs, of her greatness. Her true magnificence is
  seen in the way in which she has built up nations overseas with no thought of
  her own advantage. Britain, confined to her islands, with every colony
  elevated into an independent state, is richer in all that constitutes
  national wealth than if she owned a quarter of the globe in fee-simple, and
  administered it as a tributary province. By remaining loyal to her faith in
  liberty she provides the conditions in which her people can grow to their
  full stature far more effectively than if she compelled the other nations of
  the world to become her servants to this end. So far I, for one, am ready to
  admit that the argument is indisputable.</p>

  <p>"But, they continue, this modern talk of empire introduces another ideal,
  and a grossly material one. It brings in mere size as in itself of value. It
  seeks to extend the borders of Britain so that a quarter of the world shall
  be one state. The assumption on which it acts is that a complex organisation,
  which taxes all the powers of its organisers, is likely to produce a higher
  civic development than a simpler polity. The whole creed, they argue, is
  simply a shelving of the question. Granted that many things are ruinously
  wrong in our public life, surely the right way to remedy them is to get at
  the root of the mischief, to reform the heart, to transform the spirit, and
  not merely to say there is a big empire which will cure these ills if we
  allow it. They add&mdash;and I know I am repeating what has already been
  better said&mdash;that an immense material environment will cripple the soul.
  We shall think in continents instead of in truths. Our prosperity and its
  responsibilities will choke us till we become leaden-eyed galley-slaves
  killed by a too generous fortune.</p>

  <p>"I can distinguish two separate points of attack. The first is that
  Imperialism tends to seek material cures for spiritual diseases. That is to
  say, our opponents deny that qualitative development can depend upon a
  quantitative basis. The second is that a vast material environment is not
  only no remedy for moral ills, but a direct menace to moral well-being. Let
  us take these arguments separately.</p>

  <p>"The first, to my mind, is true up to a point. It adopts an illustration
  from biology, and holds that organic disease in a living body is not removed
  by growth in size or by any stimulants which promote such growth. Well, I am
  in entire agreement. But to adduce this illustration as an answer to my
  contention is to be guilty of a glaring <i>ignoratio elenchi</i>. I have used
  the word 'development,' not health. And my argument is that just as you
  cannot find the mind and spirit of a man in a body which has been starved and
  stunted till it is no better than an infant's, so you cannot find true
  spiritual progress unless you provide adequate material conditions. But I do
  not care for this pictorial reasoning, so let us put the matter differently.
  What do we mean by spiritual development? Surely, the broadening and
  deepening of the mind till it regards the world in its true perspective, and
  the strengthening of the character so that the will is a tempered and
  unerring weapon in the charge of a man's soul. And this end is to be achieved
  only by the exercise of the mind upon the largest possible manifold of
  experience, and by the conflict of character with the alien forces of the
  world. I am talking, remember, not of the saint and recluse, but of the
  citizen. What is true of individual development is no less true of the
  state's. A nation becomes great in the most sublimated sense of the word by
  its ability to present its citizens with a sphere of action wherein their
  civic responsibilities may be fulfilled. A microcosm, however perfect, will
  never be a true arena for civic virtue.</p>

  <p>"But, it may be argued, no one denies that the state must have an ample
  sphere of action; the objection to your doctrine is that you declare that the
  sphere of action involves a spacial extension, whereas we say that it may be
  intensive. There is sufficient work for the citizen in settling his home
  problems without embarking on foreign adventures. My answer is that for a
  state such as ours the two things are synonymous. I do not for a moment deny
  that for a new colony intensive activity may be the path of wisdom. But in
  all old and highly developed lands there comes a time when, without spacial
  extension, all that is possible is a barren rearrangement, a shuffling of the
  cards. Just as we cannot describe a mere analysis and readjustment of a few
  dogmas as mental progress, so I call any preoccupation with what after all
  must be the formal aspect of our own affairs&mdash;their emendation without
  the introduction of fresh elements,&mdash;I call that national stagnation.
  And this brings me to my second answer to the first argument of our
  opponents. I am prepared to maintain that spacial extension may cure a
  disease, when that disease is itself the result of undue confinement. If a
  man is fainting from foul air, he will revive under the winds of heaven. A
  palm may be perishing in a flower-pot, when it would thrive in the forest.
  Mrs Deloraine has suggested that certain of the vices in our modern art are
  due to the narrowing of its borders. Take, again, our labour problem. You may
  talk about the reorganisation of industry, you may accept any socialist
  nostrum, you may abolish capitalism, and yet you will be no better off, if,
  as I believe, the radical fault is that we are over-industrialised. The cure
  for our economic ills, if cure there be, is to bring fresh capital into the
  business. One of the misfortunes of our age is that in one sense it is too
  ideal, too prone to neglect the material conditions without which no great
  end can be achieved in this world or any other. It is a flimsy idealism at
  the best, for the great idealists never forgot that, if it was well to trust
  in God, it was no less right to keep their powder dry."</p>

  <p>"We are too ideal," continued Lord Appin, meeting the approving glance of
  Mr Wakefield, "and at the same time we are not ideal enough. If we were, we
  should not hear the second argument which our opponents use. Material
  greatness, they say, is an enemy to moral well-being. It debases our
  standards, inflames our pride, and stirs our passions. To this I have only
  one answer to make. If our national life be of so poor a quality that it is
  smothered by possessions, then the battle need never be joined at all. The
  'small nation' fallacy is like the 'sheltered life' humbug in education. A
  people must keep itself clear from the world lest its garments be spotted,
  just as a boy should not be sent to a public school in case his moral sense
  be dimmed. If our soul is to be lost because we go down into the arena of
  life, then the odds are that it was not worth saving from the first. If we
  will escape the danger of decadence, we will also forego the hope of
  progress; and remember, the nation which stands still is doomed. If we do not
  go forward, we shall most certainly go back.</p>

  <p>"But at the same time it is well that this objection should be stated,
  because it contains a warning against the sins to which great empires are
  prone,&mdash;what the French call the disease of 'grandeur.' I believe most
  firmly that in the deepest sense Providence is on the side of the bigger
  battalions. I cannot see why size should not have its ideal as well as
  littleness. All the world inclines to reserve its affection for small
  things&mdash;a small country, a small people&mdash;because I assume there is
  a stronger sense of proprietorship attaching to what is limited in bulk. Yet
  I can conceive of as deep a patriotism in an empire as in a city, and a love
  of great mountains and plains as real as any affection for a garden. But size
  has its own disease, and we may easily fall into the vice of looking upon it
  as something worthy in itself, however alien it may remain to our culture.
  Whether we call the disease 'Jingoism' or 'grandeur' or 'self-complacency,'
  its root is the same. It means that we regard our empire as a mere
  possession, as the vulgar rich regard their bank accounts&mdash;a matter to
  boast of, and not an added duty. All the braggart glorification we sometimes
  hear means a shallow and frivolous understanding of what empire involves. No
  serious man dare boast of the millions of square miles which his people rule,
  when he remembers that each mile has its own problem, and that on him and his
  fellows lies the burden of solution.</p>

  <p>"Jingoism, then, is not a crude Imperialism; it is Imperialism's stark
  opposite. It belongs to the school of thought which thinks of the Empire as
  England, with a train of dependencies and colonies to enhance her insular
  prestige; but it has no kinship with the ideal of an empire moving with one
  impulse towards a richer destiny. The true Imperialist will be very little
  inclined to a cheap complacency. He is kindled at times to ardour by the
  magnitude of his inheritance, and he has always, if he keeps the faith,
  optimism and hope to cheer him. But he is equally weighed down with the
  burden of his duties and the complexity of the task before him, if he would
  translate his dream into fact. A dependency to him is not a possession but a
  trust. The glory of England is not the mileage of her territory but the state
  into which she is welding it.</p>

  <p>"And therefore I say that Imperialism, sanely considered, is the best
  guardian of peace. Its aim is not conquest but consolidation and development,
  and its task within its own borders is so great that it has little inducement
  to meddle with its neighbours. I am no believer in cosmopolitanism. I have
  always thought that a man must cleave to his own people, and that the purpose
  of God is best attained by the strife of race with race and ideal with ideal.
  War will remain as the last resort when two race ideals, passionately held,
  meet in conflict. But the war which comes from a vague lust of possession I
  abhor, and the remedy for it is a preoccupation with nobler tasks. England
  has completed her great era of expansion. Her work for ages was to find new
  outlets for the vigour of her sons, and to occupy the waste or derelict
  places of the earth. Now, the land being won, it is her task to develop the
  wilds, to unite the scattered settlements, and to bring the whole within the
  influence of her tradition and faith. This labour we call empire-building,
  and above all things it is a labour of peace."</p>

  <p>"I thought that you were going to talk metaphysics," said Mr Wakefield in
  an aggrieved voice. "Instead, you have talked ordinary common-sense, with
  which I can pick no quarrel. I object to having my patent infringed."</p>

  <p>Lord Appin had got himself a cigar and was smoking steadily.</p>

  <p>"In the last resort," he said blandly, "the two things are not
  distinguishable. I feared I had been a little too high-coloured in my
  argument to earn your approval, for Mrs Deloraine has affected us all with a
  tendency to emotion. Still, I think, the main position is sound."</p>

  <p>"Sound!" cried Mr Wakefield. "There is no answer to it. But I am glad that
  I am not obliged to make the defence too often, for I am not an adept at this
  kind of discussion. In the colonies we go on simpler lines. One opponent says
  that he wants a republic, another declares that England is played out, while
  a third idiot&mdash;and he is the commonest&mdash;is too anxious to get his
  township started to care what happens to the Empire. His only question is,
  'And what am I to get out of it?' I meet these reprobates with business
  arguments&mdash;figures, you know, and a little sentiment. In the colonies,
  happily, they do not get down to fundamentals."</p>

  <p>"Nor in England," said Hugh. "The people who go back to first principles,
  as a rule make the journey only to find some defence for a prejudice which
  nothing will induce them to forego. There are no conversions in that rarefied
  air."</p>

  <p>"Well, let us leave it at that," Lord Appin said cheerfully. "We, too,
  have recourse to fundamentals merely to justify to ourselves the faith which
  comes to us from other sources. I have a great belief in common-sense, which,
  after all, is the method proper to the sphere of the Understanding. Only, as
  some of us have inquisitive minds, it is as well now and then to go a little
  farther for the sake of a more reasonable satisfaction. Heaven forbid that I
  should ever try to transfer for good the case for Imperialism to the cloudy
  plateau of philosophy. Philosophy is not a necessary of life, it is not even
  a special pleasure; but, remember, if it once lays hold of the mind, it is
  the only thing which can solve the doubts it creates.... There, Wakefield, I
  hope I have climbed off" my perch with sufficient humility to please you. And
  now, having blasphemed my idols, I shall restore my self-respect by beating
  you at billiards.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">"WE shall get back," said the Duchess next night at dinner,
  "just in time for the autumn session. I am told I must give a political
  party, and I want you all to come. Bob always does, and our people stare at
  him as if he were a strange new beast. It does them good to find out that he
  has not a cloven hoof, and I am sure it is the best thing in the world for
  him to be civil to people who annoy him. Will you come, Sir Edward?"</p>

  <p>That gentleman had been unaccountably glum during the meal, so that Mrs
  Yorke had given up in despair the effort of making conversation.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't," he said moodily. "I shan't be in England till after
  Christmas, for I promised Carey to go up to Kashmir and have a look at his
  place there. But it would be worth while going back if I thought I would meet
  that fellow Bronson, and tell him what I thought of him with a dog-whip. Of
  all the damned scoundrels!&mdash;I beg your pardon, Duchess, but it's a fact.
  Have you seen the home papers? You know there's a row in West Africa, a very
  ticklish affair for us, for we hold a big country with a handful of troops
  and no base within hundreds of miles. Well, because we have killed a score or
  two of natives in the way of duty, the fellow has been spitting venom about
  our men, calling them murderers, and accusing them of every unmentionable
  atrocity. I don't mind his slinging accusations into the air; it's the
  favourite game of these vermin, and eases them without doing anybody much
  harm. But when it comes to calling old Mitchinson a blackguard, who, as
  everybody knows, is the straightest and kindest fellow on earth, then, I
  think, it's about time for somebody to interfere. If half a dozen Englishmen
  in lonely stations are massacred and have their eyes gouged out, in the
  language of that rabble it's the effort of a brave people rightly struggling
  to be free. But if in self-defence we teach some of the sportsmen the ways
  of the Maxim, then it's a cold-blooded brutal murder. I would give all I
  possess to show some of these gentry the pretty habits of the full-blooded
  savage."</p>

  <p>"My dear Teddy," said Lord Appin, "your language is a little
  unparliamentary. No, I forgot. You would consider that a compliment, so I
  shall say unnecessarily abusive. I don't object to Mr Bronson, who is merely
  an honest well-meaning ass. He feels in his way as deeply about the affair as
  you do, and means as well by his country. As Bismarck said, 'Every nation
  must have its national fools.' The sentimentalist is a much worse fellow, for
  he has no earnestness to justify his folly. Let me quote from my favourite
  newspaper a few remarks about that fight in Northern Nigeria you were talking
  about.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"'On Sunday&mdash;the day of rest and gladness throughout
  the Christian world&mdash; three hundred brave, black British citizens were
  murdered in West Africa. Their offence was that they had taken up arms for
  their native land. Remember that these men were not a foreign foe, but
  subjects of our King, sharers with ourselves in the benefits which are
  assumed to follow our flag. What account have we to render of our stewardship
  towards them? Before we came into their country they were living their simple
  lives happily and innocently&mdash;in darkness, it may be, but yet in peace.
  We come among them, outrage their traditions, violate their sanctities,
  coerce them in an unfamiliar bondage. Can we wonder that a high-spirited
  people rebels? And we meet their revolt with the savage measures which
  weakness and panic dictate. West Africa is, indeed, a signal and ominous
  lesson in imperial futility and crime, but it is a lesson, we hope and
  believe, which is now scarcely needed. Already the grandiose dreams of empire
  are foundering in the bud.'"</p><br>

  <p>"There!" said Sir Edward triumphantly. "There you have the stuff I mean.
  Launceston, you defended the Nonconformist conscience when we were crossing
  the Lake. Have you anything to say in defence of that?"</p>

  <p>"I make the same distinction as Lord Appin." Lord Launceston, who had
  scarcely smiled during the reading of the extract, spoke with a grave
  deliberation which hushed the talk. "Two men may differ profoundly and yet be
  equally entitled to the name of patriot. Take the case of conscription. I may
  desire to see every citizen trained to arms, and my neighbour may hold all
  war immoral and military training no better than a preparation for crime. I
  desire the thing because I wish my country well, and he opposes me because he
  also wishes it well. We differ because we are patriots: if he, with his
  convictions, were less of a patriot, he might agree with me. There are many
  people who must be troubled by the incidents of a native war&mdash;quite
  honestly and reasonably troubled. They believe that their country is
  degrading herself, and, because they love their country, they are bound to
  protest. We differ intellectually, but morally we are at one with them. I do
  not object to the killing of men in a right cause, just as I do not object to
  capital punishment, because I have no extreme respect for human life. Nor do
  I object to flogging when it may be expedient, because I do not believe in
  the dignity of the human person. But I recognise that many good men do not
  share my scepticism, and that for them to condone these things would be a
  betrayal of their moral standards. I want to see every genuine fanatic fought
  tooth and nail if need be, but respected as a foe who by a turn of fortune's
  wheel may become an ally. Fanaticism means steel and fire, and we are nothing
  without them. Every true Imperialist, it seems to me, must be at heart a kind
  of fanatic. We can do something with the cranks, but we can do nothing with
  the <i>fláneur</i>. They differ from us only in opinion, not in purpose, and
  any day a new light or a wider experience may range them on our side."</p>

  <p>Sir Edward grunted. "Then if we are to respect them so much, how are we to
  fight them? You can't fight without a little animosity, and it looks as if
  that excellent quality were to be swamped with unwilling admiration."</p>

  <p>"We fight them because we believe them to be utterly and mischievously
  wrong. We are in as deadly earnest as they are, and we are as certain of our
  faith. When fanaticism comes in our way we must convert it or destroy it. But
  when that is done we can build its tomb and give it a friendly epitaph."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say that the fellows who are screaming about Mitchinson
  are only mistaken patriots?"</p>

  <p>"Some are undoubtedly," said Lord Launceston. "But not over many, because
  the true fanatic is rarely a fool, and this attack is so curiously foolish.
  No, I fear it springs in the main from a quality for which I have no defence
  to make&mdash;a shallow and calculating sentimentality."</p>

  <p>Lady Flora protested. "Please, Lord Launceston, don't join in the
  conventional abuse of sentiment. I like it, for it means that people are
  simple-minded and cheerful."</p>

  <p>"I don't mean your kind of sentiment, my dear child. We shall all pray for
  its continuance. The sentiment I mean is the decadence of everything simple
  and cheerful. It comes from a mind and heart whose powers have gone
  rotten."</p>

  <p>Lady Warcliff nodded her agreement. "I like that distinction I used before
  between the hard-hearted kind people and the soft-hearted cruel people. The
  sentimentalist is the egotist who cloaks his selfishness by claiming a
  monopoly of the purer emotions. There is no province of life which he does
  not pollute. In love he is the philanderer, in politics the Jingo or the
  humanitarian, in art the purveyor of all that is weak and fatuous and
  second-rate. He is incapable of greatness: he is incapable of even common
  truth. He goes through life without ever seeing the world in its reality, for
  between him and it hangs the veil of the second-hand emotionalism. He is the
  kind of being who calls physical cowardice moral courage, who will shed tears
  over the poor and bully his own servants, whose mouth is full of noble words
  and his heart of little fears and vanities. There is nothing to lay hold of
  in him, only rottenness, like a decaying tree. He has so debauched his soul
  that he is incapable of any clean strong passion, and therefore I say, God
  pity the man or woman who trusts in him. For, like all weak unwholesome
  things, he is capable of the last extreme of cruelty."</p>

  <p>"Poor sentimentalist!" sighed the Duchess. "Really, Margaret, you are too
  unkind, for we have all a bit of him in our nature, and your censure is
  horribly personal. Let us walk round the terrace while the men smoke, and
  then we may be in a better frame of mind for Lord Launceston."</p>

  <p>Half an hour later in the inner hall the company reassembled. Lady Flora
  had begged for lights. "I feel so eerie in the dark," she said, "and besides,
  I like to watch people's faces. Mr Wakefield, will you sit beside me and
  translate the fragments of the dead languages which no one seems able to do
  without?"</p>

  <p>Lord Launceston began with a great air of diffidence.</p>

  <p>"I have been given an appalling task by our host&mdash;nothing less than
  to sum up the kind of conclusions we have been hovering round since we came
  here. It was no use my protesting and quoting Fichte's reply to Madame de
  Staël, <i>'Ces choses ne ses laissent pas dire succinctement.'</i> He replied
  that if we had any clear ideas at all, there were always words to fit them. I
  suppose he is right, and though our body of results is not very great, yet
  there are one or two points established. Like all living faiths, Imperialism
  must grow insensibly into men's hearts. Almost the last thing it finds is its
  principles, but long before that it has revealed itself in a new way of
  looking at the world, a new hope, vague, indeterminate, and yet so priceless
  that those who catch the gleam are ready to leave everything and follow
  it.</p>

  <p>"Our first conclusion, therefore, was that Imperialism was not Liberalism
  or Conservatism or any other traditional creed. It was a new attitude of mind
  which admitted certain new conditions into the problem of statesmanship. On
  the interpretation of these conditions there will be a great difference of
  opinion. We shall have liberals and conservatives, socialists and
  individualists, free-traders and protectionists, but all these differences
  will exist <i>within</i> Imperialism. The sign-manual of our creed is the
  belief that our problems must be settled on the basis of the Empire, that it
  is our business to look at all the facts instead of at only a few of them.
  "This is, of course, the merest formal statement, and gets us very little
  farther. On these terms we could enlist, I believe, ninety-nine out of every
  hundred Englishmen in a lip-service to the creed. What we desire to create is
  the Imperialist with the intelligence to estimate his data correctly, and the
  will to act upon his conclusions. That is to say, we ask for a more
  highly-developed type of citizen. Lord Appin has already explained to you the
  practical standpoint of such a citizen, and the philosophical justification
  for it. We do not need theorists or sentimentalists or anarchists: we want
  the practical intelligence which is acute in foresight and sober in ideal,
  and which is joined to an unhesitating instinct for deeds. He has also
  explained the kind of philosophical preconception which is involved in any
  examination of our new data, and which must be taken as the sine qua non of
  Imperialism. He defined it roughly, if I remember, as the recognition of the
  value of material greatness for spiritual development, the belief that since
  ideals can only be realised under conditions of space and time, it is right
  and proper to attend to these conditions. So our Imperialist&mdash;liberal,
  conservative, individualist, socialist&mdash;we may take to be the man who
  accepts the Empire as the basis of all our problems, who believes that
  spacial expansion is not inconsistent with civic well-being but may be a
  valuable ally, and who carries to his task a mind which understands the
  limitations of political activity, and at the same time is quick to apprehend
  and resolute to act. Many Imperialists, no doubt, will fall short of this
  high standard, but we define a party by its ideal.</p>

  <p>"In the early part of our discussions much was said about the relations of
  Imperialism to current politics at home. We do not seek to create any new
  party, but to have all parties accept our doctrine as the ultimate basis of
  their activity. But at the same time there are certain types of mind which
  are of more value to us than others, and certain types which are almost
  wholly useless. I have something to say on this subject which I can best
  introduce by a quotation from Lady Flora. I overheard her the other day
  arguing with Astbury about that hoary question&mdash;the proper definition of
  Whig and Tory. And this was her conclusion. A Whig is a man who is prepared
  to go to the stake for his beliefs, but who will not send his opponents
  there. A Tory is one who will not only burn himself, but is quite prepared in
  the last resort to burn those who differ from him. I take that as a parable,
  and I am prepared to defend the Tory attitude as the one which in the future
  must triumph. We are many hundred years removed from burning, but the point
  of view remains the same. One man is very much in earnest about his creed,
  but he will not coerce his fellows into agreement. He must justify himself to
  his own conscience, but he will not take it upon himself to compel other
  consciences to follow suit. <i>Laissez-faire</i> is his motto and
  individualism his religion. A second man has the same private depth of
  conviction, but his conscience has a communal tinge in it. He cannot conceive
  that that which deeply concerns himself does not also concern the State. I do
  not mean that he is the crude propagandist. That is a type that is common
  enough and worthless enough to-day. Every human being itches to make
  converts, whether it be to theosophy or to dry-fly fishing. I mean the
  serious conviction that no man lives to himself alone, and that we must
  settle our problems not only for ourselves but for the State. A political
  creed cannot be a private possession. If it is true it is true for the whole
  race, and the type of mind which I speak of is prepared to coerce the world
  into accepting it. One man says, 'I think this or that, and I hope to find
  enough like-minded people to give the view the support of a majority.'
  Another says, 'This is my opinion, and since it is God's truth, the world
  shall accept it." And it is the latter who must conquer. The earth is not yet
  the heritage of the meek, and the Kingdom of Heaven will yield only to
  violence. That is what I mean when I say that the natural ally of the
  Imperialist is the fanatic. We demand first of all wisdom, but we believe
  that wisdom is a voice in the desert, unless there is a power of conviction
  behind her to compel the market-place to acknowledge her godhead.</p>

  <p>"We have spoken of English conditions from the party point of view, and we
  have found that we can disregard conventional party distinctions. I would
  rather consider them under a more organic division. We have still the great
  threefold classification&mdash;the lower classes, the middle, and the upper,
  or, as I should prefer to put it, the classes which have wants, the classes
  which are satisfied, and the classes which have ambitions. Some men are so
  near the margin of life that their horizon is bounded by material
  wants&mdash;food, housing, security. Others live on a plane where their
  desires are either less self-regarding, or if self-regarding are less
  material, and such desires I call ambitions. Between these extremes lie the
  great contented classes, the bourgeois in mind. They may have no positive
  satisfaction in life, but they desire in their dumb way the maintenance of
  things as they are. They may clamour for this or that reform, but they are
  not reformers at heart, for their minds are asleep. I need scarcely say that
  this distinction of classes does not correspond with the conventional one.
  Some of our own class are in my lower, and a vast number in my middle class,
  while many of the lower class as usually defined, and not a few of the
  middle, would belong to what on my definition is the aristocracy of
  ambition."</p>

  <p>"How true!" said Mrs Wilbraham. "If we had a spiritual Debrett prepared by
  a committee of archangels what havoc it would make in Society!"</p>

  <p>"I do not wish to disparage my middle class," Lord Launceston continued.
  "It plays a useful part and it has many virtues. As some one has said, it is
  the 'force of social persistence.' It has also, I believe, been likened to a
  backbone."</p>

  <p>"A most dangerous metaphor," said the Duchess. "What warrant has a
  backbone to make so much noise? I always thought that it was the duty of that
  valuable part of the human frame to remain decently covered up with flesh. An
  aggressive backbone is a contradiction in terms. And yet there is no doubt
  that we are governed by our middle, our stupidly satisfied class."</p>

  <p>"Yes. That is our danger, as it has been the danger of all great
  civilisations. It does not think, because it has no need to. The burdens of
  citizenship mean nothing to it, because they are not felt. The lives of its
  members are beyond the reach of ordinary want, they are secure from attack,
  they have no reason to pester themselves about the problems of statecraft.
  Their attitude to the poor is one of slightly contemptuous patronage. Since
  their standards are material they have little sympathy for those who cannot
  command material success. Towards the class with ambitions they feel an
  innate hostility, save in so far as that class contains their social
  superiors. I have no doubt such people are kind friends, excellent husbands,
  and wise fathers, but in no sense of the word are they citizens. And yet by a
  paradox of fate they govern. It is their votes that must be sought before any
  policy can be realised. It is this dull residuum who must be cajoled or
  persuaded before one step forward is possible. They are the support of
  traditionalism in all departments of life, not from conviction, like the true
  Tory, but from apathy.</p>

  <p>"To such people we make no appeal. Imperialism, like all constructive
  policies, asks for science, for ideas, for <i>Geist</i>, above all for
  courage. But it may act upon this inert mass like fire upon ore, and
  sublimate it into something of value. The sense of citizenship comes not from
  governing but from administering, and till problems are translated into
  homely terms, and the demands of the State hammer at the doors of those
  self-satisfied homes, there will be no salvation for their inmates. In the
  meantime our appeal must be to the first and the third of my classes. The
  third is obvious enough. The aristocracy of ambition in whatever social rank
  they may be found are our natural propagandists. We appeal to all who can
  think clearly and feel cleanly and act wholeheartedly&mdash;the</p>

  <p class="quote">'patrician spirits that refine Their flesh to fire and issue
  like a flame On brave endeavours.'</p>

  <p class="first">But we appeal no less eagerly to the rising democracy, the
  men who are still preoccupied with the elementary wants of life. These men
  know that they can only make their power felt by superior energy, by loyalty
  to their ideals, by a relentless fidelity to facts. Like us they demand that
  the rubbish be cleared away, like us they clamour for a recognition of the
  needs of things as they are. They may show signs of hysteria and impatience,
  but never of stagnation. Their attitude of mind is one with ours, and we have
  sufficient faith to believe that the same attitude will in time produce the
  same creed.</p>

  <p>"There is another side of the popular cry which to my mind is most
  hopeful. Your labour leader to-day wishes to bring the humblest citizen into
  the life of the State. That is to say, he would extend the opportunity of
  administrative experience by means of subordinate councils, and with such an
  extension must come a growth of the feeling of corporate responsibility. The
  lower classes, if he had his will, should not govern without administering.
  Now our appeal is to practical statesmen, those who know the difficulties of
  administration and who have acquired from experience a wider view of public
  interests than the merely selfish. At present, I grant you, there is too much
  inclination in this class to identify the interests of the State with those
  of one section, but I am optimistic enough to believe that a wider experience
  carries within itself the cure.</p>

  <p>"The first moral condition, then, which Imperialism demands is a quickened
  civic conscience and a tireless intelligence. The second, for want of a
  better phrase, I will call a wider patriotism. The affection which with many
  is limited at present to their birthplace must be extended to the Empire. I
  do not mean that we should forego old attachments. Just as no man will ever
  love his fatherland in the same way as he loves the village or parish where
  he was born, so to the Englishman, the Canadian, and the New Zealander,
  England and Canada and New Zealand will always have more intimate claims than
  any wider geographical area. But Imperial patriotism will stand to national,
  as national patriotism to-day stands to local affection. A man is not less of
  a patriot because the 'lone sheiling and the misty island' are nearer his
  heart than the whole realm of Britain. And a man may be a good Imperialist
  although his country of origin has a larger share in his interests than the
  Empire. There is a gradation in patriotism, and one grade differs from
  another in kind. If we have at one end the sentiment for what is small and
  unique&mdash;the village, the glen, the cottage&mdash;at the other we may
  have a sentiment as genuine for what is omnipotent and universal.</p>

  <p>"This wider patriotism, as I understand it, seems to me to harmonise with
  the nature of our race. Our land no more than Hellas has a paltry local
  unity. The English genius has never regarded its civilisation as tied down to
  the place of its birth. Its task has been to absorb the unfamiliar and to lay
  bare the unknown, admitting no <i>terra incognita</i> into its scheme of
  things. There is always the home country, the centre of memories, but the
  working loyalties of life go to those lands it has created. As every man
  loves the work of his own hands, so any race must love what comes from its
  own toil and adventure. Such a love is no thin cosmopolitanism, but the
  jealous affection for its own household, and once the unity of the Empire is
  realised, patriotism must embrace it as naturally as family affection
  embraces each new inmate of the home.</p>

  <p>"These are platitudes which are scarcely worth repeating, were they not so
  often forgotten. We need not greatly concern ourselves with the by-products
  of empire. If the motive force is there&mdash;the new attitude of mind and
  all that is implied in it&mdash;we may safely trust to natural laws to
  produce the secondary results we desire. Our first business, then, is to have
  the Empire accepted, not as a pious opinion or a phrase of rhetoric, but as a
  living faith. It must become an unconscious presupposition in all our
  politics, otherwise it will not influence our conduct of affairs. Remember
  that a truth is only potent in English life when it has become a truism. Our
  duty, as we all agree, is first of all to create opinion,&mdash;to guide the
  alert, and to compel the inert into a certain attitude of mind.</p>

  <p>"So far, I think, I carry Mr Wakefield with me. But after that, he will
  ask, what next? After that, I am afraid, he and I must agree to differ. It is
  not a fundamental difference, for it is only on methods, but the methods seem
  to me so vital a matter that I fear it is a real difference. Let me repeat
  some of the conclusions we have reached in our discussion. We saw that while
  legislative federation was out of the question as things stand to-day, some
  executive union was not only urgently needed, but up to a point practicable.
  Mr Wakefield himself, outlined a scheme which promised to create gradually
  and without any wild change a true Imperial executive. We saw that the
  present theory of our Empire was one of alliance, but that it must be made a
  working alliance. We have a dozen great common problems, and they are all
  administrative&mdash;the control of subject races, the development of the
  tropics, labour, defence, emigration, commercial union. Our survey of these
  has been very slight, but we have found reason, I think, to believe that in
  all there is a hope of a successful settlement on an Imperial basis. But
  questions which concern all must be answered by the co-operation of all. At
  present our method is either to leave them unanswered or to answer them
  ourselves after a make-believe of consultation. This is bad enough, but in my
  opinion it is less dangerous than the other proposal which Mr Wakefield
  upholds. That seeks to effect a union on a matter of immense importance to
  each unit, while retaining the old loose alliance system unchanged. I am not
  dealing now with any economic doctrine. I am perfectly content to see our
  traditional faith revised if necessary, but that revision must come from a
  body empowered to undertake the task. To plunge the empire into a wrangle on
  what is after all a detail, without providing the machinery within which
  alone that detail has any meaning, is to my mind a gross blunder in
  statesmanship."</p>

  <p>"As if," said Lord Appin dreamily, "a man were to embark on a violent
  discussion about the career of his eldest son before he had proposed to the
  lady of his affections."</p>

  <p>"Carey," said Mr Wakefield, "I thought that subject had been forbidden. If
  it hasn't, I ought to be allowed to state my case. In two words it is this. I
  say that before you can have an executive union you must create a desire for
  it. The most vital of our common problems is that of our commerce. If we once
  show the different peoples in the empire that on this point they can have a
  union to their mutual advantage, why, union will follow as a matter of
  course."</p>

  <p>Lord Launceston laughed. "My dear Wakefield, if that is all your case then
  I have no quarrel with you. That is very different from the 'high priori'
  line of most of your school. Many of them are Imperialists only by accident.
  They are insular at heart, and they stand like Ruth 'in tears amid the alien
  corn' because they lament the decline of England, not the disintegration of
  the empire. If the creed of a common commercial policy is only an argument
  for an imperial executive, then you have my best wishes in your crusade. But
  remember there are many other common needs, and that to attempt to meet any
  one without the common machinery will mean failure, utter and final, and
  good-bye for many a day to all hope of union. These discussions have left me
  with two convictions intensified. One is that in the end our creed must
  prevail. The other is that we are dealing with fragile things and must go
  very warily. We are not welding lifeless matter together, but coaxing into
  one growth a number of separate forms of life. And since we are handling life
  our touch must be delicate and sympathetic, for one hint of coercion may snap
  the vital link. I am one of those people who rejoice in colonial nationalism.
  I would not have it one jot weaker than it is to-day. When I hear of
  Australia clamouring for a navy of her own, and Canada asking for the
  treaty-making power, I am honestly delighted. They may be asking for the
  wrong things, but the fact that they should want them is
  right&mdash;right&mdash;right. I want to see every one of our
  daughter-peoples grow into triumphant and self-conscious nationhood, for it
  is all contributory to the well-being of the Empire. There is no value in the
  union of weak things: we want the unity of strength, the unity where every
  part has a vigorous self-subsistent life out of which it contributes to the
  common stock of imperial vitality.</p>

  <p>"In our discussion we have insisted&mdash;rightly, I think&mdash;less upon
  the material splendour which our ideal involves than upon its spiritual
  greatness. Empire is a dream&mdash;on the brink of realisation, it is true,
  but still a dream. Too often these Imperial visions have a Byzantine
  colouring. They dwell on size and numbers and wealth, but not enough upon the
  new life which is bound up in them. All my days the epic of our future has
  sung itself in my ears, but as I grow into late middle age I think less of
  the pomp and pageantry and more of the grave austerity at the heart of it. I
  can foresee an empire where each part shall live to the full its own life and
  develop an autochthonous culture. But behind it all there will be the great
  catholic tradition in thought and feeling, in art and conduct, of which no
  one part, but the empire itself, is the appointed guardian. In that
  confraternity of peoples the new lands will redress the balance of the old,
  and will gain in return an inheritance of transmitted wisdom. Men will not
  starve in crowded islands when there are virgin spaces waiting for them, and
  young nations will not be adventurers in far lands, but children of a great
  household carrying the fire from the ancestral hearth. Our art will be
  quickened by a breath from a simpler and cleaner world, and the fibre of our
  sons will be strung to vigour by the glimpse of more spacious horizons. And
  our English race will vindicate to mankind that doctrine which is the noblest
  of its traditions&mdash;that liberty is possible only under the dominion of
  order and law, and that unity is not incompatible with the amplest freedom.
  We of the old countries shall give and receive. Our Trojan manhood, our
  Trojan Lares and Penates will be there, but so too will Latium and the
  ancient Ausonian rites. Do you remember how at the close of the AEneid Juno
  asks from Jupiter that Italy may remain herself in spite of foreign
  conquest?</p><br>

  <p class="verse">'Sit Latium, sint Albani per saecula reges,<br>
  Sit Bomana potens Itala virtute propago."<br></p>

  <p>And the King of the Gods replies :&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">'Sermonem Ausonii patrium moresque tenebunt,<br>
  Utque est nomen erit; commixti corpore tantum<br>
  Subsident Teucri. Morem ritusque sacrorum<br>
  Adjiciam faciamque omnes uno ore Latinos.<br>
  Hinc genus Ausonio mixtum quod sanguine surget<br>
  Supra homines, supra ire deos pietate videbis,<br>
  Nee gens ulla tuos aeque celebrabit honores.'*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* <i>AEneid</i>, xii. S26, S27; S34-840.<br>
  "Let Latium stand, to all ages let there be Alban kings! let the Roman stock
  be potent in Italian valour.... Her ancient speech and ways shall Ausonia
  keep, and as her name is, it shall be; mingled into her blood shall the
  Trojan sink. Law and holy rites will I add, and I will make Latins of all
  with a single tongue. Thence thou wilt see a race arise tempered of Ausonian
  blood, transcending men, yea, and gods in duty, and no other folk will so
  nobly pay thee thy meed of worship." I take these words as the best and
  simplest statement of our faith. That idea has been the master-passion of my
  life, and I ask no higher task than to contribute my mite of effort to so
  divine an end."</p>

  <p>There was silence for a little as Lord Launceston's quiet voice ceased.
  Then Carey from the fireplace spoke.</p>

  <p>"It is a religion," he said, "to me, and I think to others. If you quarrel
  with the word, I can only say that what any man desires with his whole heart,
  what wakens all that is best in him and curbs all that is worst, is a
  religion, whatever else the term may mean. No man can be religious who is not
  a fighter, who does not know the odds which the world sets against him, who
  has not suffered and struggled and tried the temper of the human spirit
  against the iron rigour of nature. Religion is not a comfortable thing of
  easy prayers and ready thanksgivings, but something as fierce and stubborn
  and consuming as life itself. How else is it to wither the hosts of the
  enemy? I want my allies to be fanatics. If my religion is not to include my
  politics, then I am content to have none, for to me the one as much as the
  other is an attempt to subdue the material world of our common sight into
  harmony with an unseen world of the spirit."</p>

  <p>The stillness which still reigned in the room showed the Duchess that an
  atmosphere had been created too emotional for her comfort. But in spite of
  herself she had been impressed, and the cool tones of her voice had an
  unwonted feeling in them as she once more brought back the discussion to what
  she considered a reasonable level.</p>

  <p>"It is a great creed, no doubt, and I am not going to criticise. Some of
  it frightens me a little, but then I am old-fashioned and easily frightened.
  The merit of it all seems to me to be that it allows for such ample
  differences among its disciples. You can add to and subtract from it without
  altering its character. I suppose, Bob, that you would say that that is
  because it is a living thing, with all the generous waste and superabundance
  of life."</p>

  <p>Lord Appin rose and walked to the window, where he stood for a little
  before he replied.</p>

  <p>"Yes; it is alive, and in saying that we have used the final word of
  commendation. There is room within its shadow for all the policies which can
  inspire the hearts of wise men to a keener public duty. There is room for
  Carey's mysticism, and Wakefield's practical good sense, and Susan's Liberal
  principles, and Lady Amysfort's Toryism&mdash;room, too, for the hard
  scientific faith of young men like Astbury and Hugh; room even for Sir
  Edward's anarchic individualism. It is still a far-away ideal, and there is a
  long task before us till it has become a fact. Few of us here will live to
  witness the realisation, but we shall see the outworks passed, and Flora's
  grandchildren perhaps may see the winning of the fort. I have always been
  suspicious of political fervour. To me there is something ill-bred and
  irrational about a heart worn on the sleeve of the shabby garments we use in
  public life. But I hold the man in contempt who is afraid to stake all on his
  ideal, and on this one ultimate ideal I have never wavered. I am on the verge
  of old age, and I can claim the privilege of a life of candour and fair
  criticism and permit myself once in a while to become an enthusiast. So in
  all hope and in all humility I would paraphrase the words of another
  converted cynic and adopt them as my confession of faith: 'I shall see it,
  but not now: I shall behold it, but not nigh.'"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE party wandered out to the verandah where a young moon
  was beginning to climb the vast arch of sky. So thin was its horn that it did
  not diminish the brilliance of the stars. The great trough beneath the house
  was lit by a stellar glow, which caught a few out-jutting headlands in the
  sea of shadows, and outlined without revealing the abysses around them. The
  air was very quiet, cool without a hint of frost or wind; and only the tinkle
  of falling water broke in upon the stillness. The light from the drawing-room
  filled half the verandah, but the edge near the parapet was dark, and to one
  standing there the great house, looming up against the sky, was like a pharos
  in the wastes of night.</p>

  <p>The Duchess with Lord Launceston and Mr Carey walked slowly towards the
  edge of the escarpment, their eyes caught by the magic of the scene.</p>

  <p>"This old earth," said Carey at last, lifting his head from his
  breast,&mdash; "that is what we have business with. How to shape her into
  something more worthy of our best, and how in the process to learn from her
  her mysterious wisdom! That is our problem. We have been too long away from
  her in barren cloudlands. Our new precept is that the kingdom of God is
  around us and within us."</p>

  <p>Lord Launceston laughed as they stopped to lean over the balustrade. "You
  have been anticipated," he said, and he repeated:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"This way have men come out of brutishness<br>

  Shall on through brave wars waged.</p>

  <p class="verse">More gardens will they win than any lost;<br>
  The vile plucked out of them, the unlovely slain.<br>
  Not forfeiting the beast with which they are crossed,<br>

  Themselves the attuning chord!"*</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," said the Duchess, "we all go home. I should not like Musuru
  to last for ever, but it rather spoils one's satisfaction in any other place.
  To-morrow we shall be crawling through the bush in the Mombasa train, and
  beginning to realise what a length of sea and land separates this house from
  those in which we live our ordinary lives. That is an allegory as well as a
  fact. We have behaved rather nicely, I think, Francis. Every one has been
  good-humoured and well-mannered, and we have kept more or less in the paths
  of sanity in spite of Barbara and you. I know I have tried to do my duty and
  coax people out of blank verse, and I have learned a great deal in the
  process, and am half inclined to the blank verse myself. Now, I suppose I
  must go on explaining to dull people that the Empire is something more than
  corrugated iron and an unpleasant accent, and that that something more is not
  bloodshed to the strains of a brass band. It will be very difficult for all
  of us to get back to the right political groove. When we go home the dear
  idiots who govern us, including George, will probably be at each others'
  throats about whether the school children are to be taught the Church
  Catechism or the Sermon on the Mount. Of course we shall have to take sides,
  for it is the rule of the game: and yet how often I want to cry 'A plague on
  both your Houses!' Is it possible that I am sickening for the disease of
  'grandeur'?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Carey, "it only means that you are dropping some of your blue
  spectacles. You will find them and wear them again, but it does the eyes good
  to lose them for a little."</p>

  <p>"At any rate we are going back to some kind of work, and that is cheering.
  What happens to you, Francis? Remember you are coming to us for
  Christmas."</p>

  <p>"I am always busy, and next week I have to go to the States. Then I join
  Wakefield in Canada, but I shall be home for Christmas. There is only one
  thing that depresses me in life,&mdash;the amount to be done and the little
  time left to do it in. After all, the great deeds are not for the
  middle-aged. Our business is to inspire the young, with whom the hope of the
  world rests."</p>

  <p>"And yet we middle-aged have been galvanised into a surprising activity.
  Lord Launceston is coming back to politics, and I believe that Bob has some
  wild scheme of colonial travel. Most discussions only leave one with a sense
  of the futility of all things, but ours has made us optimists. I suppose that
  is due to the nature of our subject. If you talk much about something prosaic
  and practical, you remove it many degrees from reality. But if it is
  something which still lives only in the air, you may make it shape itself
  into body and form. What may have been only a mirage, becomes an authentic
  country, far away, to be sure, but quite as real as the ground we walk on.
  Let us go and find the young people in whom Francis says our hope lies. Hugh
  is probably composing sonnets to Flora's eyebrows, and Mr Astbury sitting at
  Marjory's feet, while Alastair and Sir Edward console each other for going
  back by abusing civilisation. How in the world am I to shepherd them all
  home?" ...</p>

  <p>At the other end of the terrace those whilom antagonists, Lord Appin and
  Mr Wakefield, were walking arm in arm, their cigars glowing in the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>"I shall take your advice," the elder man was saying. "After all, what
  business have I to theorise about Empire when I have only studied a little
  corner of it? I know English opinion; I now want to know the way the
  different classes in the colonies feel about the whole thing. You cannot get
  that from newspapers, not even from the men who come to see you in England.
  You must go and live in the place if you want to realise the true atmosphere
  of their thought. I fancied that you and I should differ violently,
  Wakefield, but I find we are nearer than we dreamed of. You emphasise parts
  of the question with which I am unfamiliar, and perhaps I should focus the
  details differently. But on the essentials I believe we are at one. If you
  may be taken to represent colonial opinion, I confess myself surprised at its

  <p>"Excellent!" said Mr Wakefield. "And now I shall return the compliment. I
  came here prejudiced against what I called academic Imperialism and very
  particularly prejudiced against you. With some of the things said here I have
  disagreed. Some I thought wrong, some too fantastic for practical politics.
  Parts of the discussion I am not sure that I understood, parts did not
  interest me, and if I had had my will I should have arranged the whole
  conference on a more businesslike system. But yet I have learned so much that
  I go away a wiser, as well as a much humbler, man. On the whole, I have been
  astounded&mdash;yes, astounded&mdash;by our common-sense."</p>
