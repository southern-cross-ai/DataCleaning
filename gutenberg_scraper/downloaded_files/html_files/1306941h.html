  <h3>A lectured delivered to the Canadian Club in Montreal on June 4, 1914</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">
  I HAVE often heard friends from this side speak about the interest and
  veneration they felt when they approached the great historical centres of
  Europe; but I can assure you that I, who am soaked in Canadian history, felt
  that same feeling when yesterday we came along the old line of invasions,
  when we examined the site of that Fort William Henry around which so many
  hostile scenes have centred; when we saw the partly destroyed Fort
  Ticonderoga, and when we come down the line of the old Iroquois war trail,
  down the Richelieu River, where every yard of advance seemed to have the
  glamour of history. As I approached this great city I recollected the time
  when only a line of frail palisades lay between its population and utter
  barbarism, and when a sudden wild rush of savages might have driven Europe
  entirely from these parts. I assure you that I felt as much veneration as I
  know you feel when you approach the historical centres of Europe.</p>

  <p>I might say that I have fallen under the spell of Francis Parkman, the
  historian &mdash; not so much under his spell as under the spell of the
  heroes and martyrs who he commemorated, and if there is any part of the world
  that is steeped in the glamour of history it is just this part upon which we
  stand. I talk of the glamour of history &mdash; the moment that history has
  left the land it seems to me that the very spirit has gone out of it &mdash;
  it has become mere rock and material, soil and water. It is the spirit of the
  land and the spirit of history that makes the land and it is just that that
  makes this comer of America the most interesting in the whole of the vast
  continent.</p>

  <p>I had some difficulty in choosing a subject on which to address you
  because my interests are somewhat wide; but I recollected that if you were
  good enough to ask me here to speak to you it is probably because some of you
  have been kind enough to read my books, and it is as a literary man that I am
  here to-day. If I had not been a writer I should probably still have been
  sending up the death rate in some obscure corner of the world. Therefore it
  is on the subject of Literature and of a Literary career that I venture to
  say a few words; and, when I speak of literature I allude more to the
  imaginative style of literature, fiction, poetry and the drama with which I
  myself am best acquainted.</p>

  <p>People often ask me what our literary crop in Great Britain is likely to
  produce. I think that is a question which can only be answered twenty-five
  years after the event. I can remember very well when I was a young man
  beginning to write, how all the critics were bewailing the fact that all the
  great men had passed away. Now when I look back and remember that among the
  men of that time were such dramatists like as Bernard Shaw, such novelists as
  Kipling and such humorists as Barrie when I consider all these and how they
  have come to fruition, I think the critics at the time were a little hard.
  And so it may be at the present time &mdash; many great trees may grow up
  &mdash; mere saplings may in time become great oaks. We have such men as
  Masefield, who I think will develop into a great poet, Galsworthy, with his
  broad humanitarianism and Arnold Bennett, who will worthily uphold the
  traditions of British literature. The very closest connection exists now
  between writers of fiction and the practical affairs of life. A very great
  impetus is given to public causes by the interest which is taken in them by
  these Men who can put them in the proper form. Who has developed Imperialism
  more than any man? It is surely the novelist Kipling. Who is to the ordinary
  public the mouthpiece of socialism? It is Wells. Who makes men think more
  than any one else, although he makes them angry? It is Bernard Shaw. Who
  stands for Zionism? It is Zangwill. Hardly a man who takes a mere
  money-making view &mdash; who does not venture out into life and employ his
  talents for the public good.</p>

  <p>People sometimes ask me whether a man can learn to write. I am afraid one
  must be born a writer. I can remember as a boy a class in school which was
  called a poetry class, and in this class everyone whether they had the talent
  or not, had to turn out a poem, although it might be difficult to recognise
  it as such. I remember on one occasion we were given the Biblical story of
  Judith and Holofernes to write a poem on, and one of our young fellows boiled
  it all down into two short lines:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">She looked to heaven, her sword she drew,<br>
  And she cut Holofernes head in two.</p>

  <p>Well, the master could not pass that and said that he really must come
  back and make another effort. The second time he appeared he
  wrote:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">Her sword she drew, she looked on high,<br>
  And she cut his throat from eye to eye.</p>

  <p>These are shocking examples of making literature where no literature
  exists. One must surely have that in-born instinct, one must thrill to the
  music of the words.</p>

  <p>Great literature cannot be taught. It is entirely beyond the reach of all
  man-fashioned laws. But what can be taught is style, and the vocabulary call
  be extended. Given the in-born instinct we can improve it by studying the
  great masters and adding constantly to our vocabulary &mdash; which is
  really, after all, our box of tools. In the matter of style nobody can do
  better than to follow Stevenson, who has helped many a lame dog into a
  style.</p>

  <p>One must understand the use of words. When a new word is found, keep it,
  hold it and use it discreetly. I think the Elizabethans and Stevenson had
  extraordinary power over large vocabularies &mdash; an instinct for using the
  unlikely word, which word, when used expressed the thought exactly. One such
  on record was the Scottish Ambassador's description of Queen Elizabeth's
  dancing; he said:&mdash; "She danced high and disposedly." Then an author,
  apart from these things, must cultivate his general stock of knowledge. A
  small-minded man is going to do no good in literature. One must have wide
  sympathies, a readiness to throw out tendrils in every direction, know the
  relation of one set of facts to another. After all this is accomplished, he
  must have an immense amount of good humoured patience during all those years
  in which he is playing ping pong with the editors. You ping out literature,
  he pongs it back and you must be patient. I know I wrote for ten years and
  pinged my literature to the editors while they ponged it back to me. I can
  recollect pictures being sent to me with a request to write a story to
  correspond to the pictures. They were pretty bad pictures, and my story
  certainly did correspond to them.</p>

  <p>Another thing is his attitude towards criticism. One should not fear
  criticism &mdash; it is much better than flattery which makes you believe you
  have nothing else to learn Over-praise is apt to bring ruin upon a man
  &mdash; he does not try to do any better &mdash; and that is an awful thing
  for a young man in any profession but worst of all to anyone in the literary
  profession. Many a promising man has been ruined by over-praise. The safest
  maxim is:-</p>

  <p>"Do your best. Having done it, think no more of it, push on to some other
  task and let the world decide whether you have done well or ill."</p>

  <p>I used to have a card hung up over my desk which I sometimes found to be a
  source of comfort. It had on it these lines:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">Critics flatter, no matter,<br>
  Critics curse, none the worse<br>
  Critics kind, never mind<br>
  Do your best, hang the rest.</p>

  <p>Another thing which one needs very much in literature also, and of which,
  perhaps, we do not always in the rush give ourselves sufficient, is quiet
  detachment. You cannot put a good cargo out if you do not take a good cargo
  in. You have not got an endless stock of ideas, an endless stock of
  knowledge; the wise man is the one who remembers that, and who from time to
  time leaves everything and goes out into the quiet places with his books, and
  there takes weeks and months to build himself up, improving his own
  education; and then, I think, when he comes back he may possibly give the
  public something worthy of them and of himself. If ever a young author is
  dissatisfied with his reception, if he feels he has not had proper
  recognition, he must remember how long the great men have waited for any
  recognition. He must remember George Meredith who published the first edition
  of his Richard Feverel in 1859; the second edition was not called for till
  1881, yet he knew well the value of his own work. That book is packed with
  beautiful passages, I was in his presence once when a young man praised one
  of those passages &mdash; it was the aphorism:&mdash; "Who rises from prayer
  a better man his prayer is answered." Meredith remarked:&mdash; "I wrote that
  twenty-five years ago and you are the first man who has ever spoken to me
  about it."</p>

  <p>I feel gentlemen here in Canada that I am standing at a place which must
  in the process of time produce a very great literature. When I put it in the
  future I do not mean that it has not yet done so, but what I mean is that it
  will be a great volume of literature which in time to come may well influence
  the literature of the world. But I should be sorry to see Canada turning her
  whole thoughts towards such matters. It seems to me that for a strong young
  country with enormous practical work lying in front of it there are better
  things to do than dream. There is such a call for the virile upbuilding of
  the country that it will be unwise of it to go back to dreaming. Great deeds
  are better than great sonnets and Canada's call to her sons is a stirring one
  to action; for the poetry of action exists just as does the poetry of words
  and the great deed that is accomplished is more glorious than the great
  sonnet. The nations that have been building themselves up have never at any
  time produced literature while they have been doing it. In Rome it was five
  hundred years after the birth of Rome before Roman literature made its
  appearance. They spent their energies in the great struggles against
  surrounding countries. In your case it is against the vast forces of nature
  which have got to be subdued. Always there is a long seed time before the
  real harvest can arrive. I might cite as an example the State of New England.
  So long as New England was the great seat of activities there was no new
  literature; but when the seat of activities of America flowed Westward, New
  England became the back water, and you had your Longfellows in that little
  corner of the world. And so I prophesy that it will be here.</p>
