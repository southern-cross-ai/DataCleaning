  <p class="first">
  THERE is nothing peculiarly malignant in the appearance of a pair of ski.
  They are two slips of elm wood, eight feet long, four inches broad, with a
  square heel, turned-up toes, and straps in the centre to secure your feet. No
  one, to look at them, would guess at the possibilities which lurk in them.
  But you put them on and you turn with a smile to see whether your friends are
  looking at you, and then the next moment you are boring your head madly into
  a snow bank, and kicking frantically with both feet, and half- rising, only
  to butt viciously into that snow bank again, and your friends are getting
  more entertainment than they had ever thought you capable of giving.</p>

  <p>That is when you are beginning. You naturally expect trouble then, and you
  are not likely to be disappointed. But as you get on a little, the thing
  becomes more irritating. The ski are the most capricious things upon the
  earth. One day you cannot go wrong with them; on another with the same
  weather and the same snow you cannot go right. And it is when you least
  expect it that things begin to happen. You stand on the crown of a slope, and
  you adjust your body for a rapid slide; but your ski stick motionless, and
  over you go on your face. Or you stand upon a plateau which seems to you to
  be as level as a billiard table, and in an instant, without cause or warning,
  away them shoot, and you are left behind, staring at the sky. For a person
  who suffers from too much dignity, a course in Norwegian snowshoes would have
  a fine moral effect.</p>

  <p>Whenever you brace yourself for a fall, it never comes off. Whenever you
  think yourself absolutely secure, it is all over with you. You come to a hard
  ice slope at an angle of seventy-five degrees and you zigzag up it, digging
  the side of your ski into it, and feeling that if a mosquito settles upon
  you, you are gone. But nothing ever happens and you reach the top in safety.
  Then you stop upon the level to congratulate your companion, and you have
  just time to say, ``What a lovely view is this! when you find yourself
  standing upon two shoulder-blades, with your ski tied tightly around your
  neck. Or again, you may have had a long outing without any misfortune at all,
  and as you shuffle back along the road, you stop for an instant to tell a
  group in the hotel veranda how well you are getting on. Something happens --
  and they suddenly find that their congratulations are addressed to the soles
  of your ski. Then if your mouth is not full of snow, you find yourself
  muttering the names of a few Swiss villages to relieve your feelings. "Ragatz
  is a very handy word and may save a scandal.</p>

  <p>But all this is in the early stage of skiing. You have to shuffle along
  the level, to zigzag, or move crab fashion, up the hills, to slide down
  without losing your balance, and above all to turn with facility. The first
  time you try to turn, your friends think it is part of your fun. The great
  ski flapping in the air has the queerest appearance -- like an exaggerated
  negro dance. But this sudden whisk round is really the most necessary of
  accomplishments; for only so can one turn upon the mountain side without
  slipping down. It must be done without presenting one's heels to the slope,
  and this is the only way.</p>

  <p>The fact is it is easier to climb an ordinary peak, or to make a journey
  over the higher passes, in winter than in summer, if the weather is only set
  fair. In summer, you have to climb down as well as to climb up, and the one
  is as tiring as the other. In winter your trouble is halved, as most of your
  descent is a mere slide. If the snow is tolerably firm, it is much easier to
  zigzag up it on ski than to clamber over boulders. . . . Our project was to
  make our way from Davos to Arosa, over the Furka Pass, which is over nine
  thousand feet high.</p>

  <p>We were up before four in the morning, and had started at half past for
  the village of Frauenkirch, where we were to commence our ascent. A great
  pale moon was shining in a violet sky, with such stars as can only be seen in
  the tropics or the higher Alps. At quarter past five we turned from the road,
  and began to plod up the hillsides, over alternate banks of last year's
  grass, and slopes of snow. We carried our ski over our shoulders, and our
  ski-boots slung round our necks, for it was good walking where the snow was
  hard, and it was sure to be hard wherever the sun had struck it during the
  day. Here and there, in a hollow, we floundered into and out of a soft drift
  up to our waists; but on the whole it was easy going, and as much of our way
  led through fir woods, it would have been difficult to ski. About half-past
  six, after a long steady grind, we emerged from the woods, and shortly
  afterwards passed a wooden cow- house, which was the last sign of humans
  which we were to see until we reached Arosa.</p>

  <p>The snow being still hard enough upon the slopes to give us a good grip
  for our feet, we pushed rapidly on, over rolling snow-fields with a general
  upward tendency. About half- past seven the sun cleared the peaks behind us,
  and the glare upon the great expanse of virgin snow became very dazzling. We
  worked our way down a long slope, and then coming to the corresponding hill
  slope with a northern outlook, we found the snow as soft as powder, and so
  deep that we could touch no bottom with our poles. Here, then, we took to our
  snow- shoes, and zigzagged up over the long white haunch of the mountain,
  pausing at the top for a rest. They are useful things, the ski; for finding
  that the snow was again hard enough to bear us, we soon converted ours into a
  very comfortable bench, from which we enjoyed the view of a whole panorama of
  mountains, the names of which my readers will be relieved to hear I have
  completely forgotten.</p>

  <p>The snow was rapidly softening now, under the glare of the sun, and
  without our ski all progress would have been impossible. We were making our
  way along the steep side of a valley with the mouth of the Furka Pass fairly
  in front of us. The snow fell away here at an angle of from fifty to sixty
  degrees, and as this steep incline, along the face of which we were
  shuffling, sloped away down until it ended in an absolute precipice, a slip
  might have been serious. My two more experienced companions walked below me
  for the half mile or so of danger, but soon we found ourselves upon a more
  reasonable slope, where one might fall with impunity. And now came the real
  sport of snow- shoeing. Hitherto, we had walked as fast as boots would do,
  over ground where no boots could pass. But now we had a pleasure which boots
  can never give. For a third of a mile we shot along over gently dipping
  curves, skimming down into the valley without a motion of our feet. In that
  great untrodden waste, with snow-fields bounding our vision on every side and
  no marks of life save the tracks of chamois and of foxes, it was glorious to
  whiz along in this easy fashion. A short zigzag at the bottom of the slope
  brought us, at half-past nine, into the mouth of the pass; and we could see
  the little toy hotels of Arosa, away down among the fir woods, thousands of
  feet beneath.</p>

  <p>Again we had a half mile or so, skimming along with our poles dragging
  behind us. It seemed to me that the difficulty of our journey was over, and
  that we had only to stand on our ski and let them carry us to our
  destination. But the most awkward place was yet in front. The slope grew
  steeper and steeper until it fell away into what was little short of being
  sheer precipices. But still that little, when there is soft snow upon it, is
  all that is needed to ring out another possibility of these wonderful slips
  of wood. The brothers Branger agreed that the slope was too difficult to
  attempt with the ski upon our feet. To me it seemed as if a parachute was the
  only instrument for which we had any use; but I did as I saw my companions
  do. They undid their ski, lashed the straps together, and turned them into a
  rather clumsy toboggan. Sitting on these with out heels dug into the snow,
  and our sticks pressed hard down behind us, we began to move down the
  precipitous face of the pass. I think that both my comrades came to grief
  over it. I know that they were as white as Lot's wife at the bottom. But my
  own troubles were so pressing that I had no time to think of them. I tried to
  keep the pace within moderate bounds by pressing on the stick, which had the
  effect of turning the sledge sideways, so that one skidded down the slope.
  Then I dug my heels hard in, which shot me off backwards, and in an instant
  my two ski, tied together, flew away like an arrow from a bow, whizzed past
  the two Brangers, and vanished over the next slope, leaving their owner
  squattering in the snow.</p>

  <p>It might have been an awkward accident in the upper field where the drifts
  are twenty or thirty feet deep. But the steepness of the place was an
  advantage now, for the snow could not accumulate to any great extent upon it.
  I made my way down in my own fashion. My tailor tells me that Harris tweed
  cannot wear out. This is a mere theory and will not stand a thorough
  scientific test. He will find samples of his wares on view from the Furka
  Pass to Arosa, and for the remainder of the day I was happiest when nearest
  the wall.</p>

  <p>However, save that one of the Brangers sprained his ankle badly in the
  descent, all went well with us, and we entered Arosa at half-past eleven,
  having taken exactly seven hours over our journey. The residents of Arosa,
  who knew we were coming, had calculated that we could not possibly get there
  before one, and turned out to see us descend the steep pass just about the
  time when we were finishing a comfortable luncheon at the Seehoff. I would
  not grudge them any innocent amusement, but still I was just as glad that my
  own little performance was over before they assembled with their opera-
  glasses.</p>
