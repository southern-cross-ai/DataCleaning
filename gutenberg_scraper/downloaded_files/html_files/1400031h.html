<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p>'And what was he like when he wasn't writing books?'
asked the small boy to whom I had just been reading a
chapter out of <i>Treasure Island</i>. 'He wasn't really grown
up, was he?'</p>

<p>Such were the two questions which came from those
unsophisticated lips, and surely it was a very laudable
curiosity that inspired them. This chapter of <i>Treasure
Island</i> had been entrancing: it was proper to want to
know something about the man who held so thrilling a
pen. I sympathise with that desire and uphold it, in
spite of those austere purists who tell us that a book
must be judged on its merits and on them alone. The
reading of it has kindled in us an excitement or has
awakened a perception of beauty: for these (the purists
say) the book alone is responsible, and the emotions
which the reading of it has aroused are concerned
only with what lies between its covers. The merchant
of pearls (they argue) does not want to ascertain the
conditions under which this valuable bivalve lived: it
is enough for him that a thing of beauty and of great
price lies in his hand. So why, if we read a book or
look at a picture that kindles our imagination, should
we want to know about the circumstances which
helped or handicapped the author or the artist who
produced it? They are irrelevant.</p>

<p>The answer is that the book <i>has</i> kindled our imagination,
and this very fact makes us demand to know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
intimate and personal history of it. We want to see
it not on the flat page only, but in the round, and to be
curious about the author and the circumstances in which
he wrote it is by no means an irrelevant inquisitiveness.
We legitimately wish to know how and why he wrote
like that: we find it humanly impossible not to desire
to learn about him as well as to enjoy his work.</p>

<p>For a fine flower of literature is not a sundered
phenomenon, as is a pearl in Bond Street. It grew
from a soil, and not only do its colour and its fragrance,
its manner of growth and of foliage concern us, but
the nature of the soil which nourished it. Was it a
natural product of that soil, or was there in it so fiery
and individual a particle that it grew there in spite of
its soil? So far from such an inquiry being irrelevant
there is nothing more justly interesting, for, indeed,
until we know about the author we cannot really judge
of his work. Some elements in it, even though it is a
masterpiece, may seem to us false or crude or biased,
but an understanding of the author's life may show us
that he could not have looked at the world of which
he treats from any other angle. It is our business, if
we want to understand a book which is worth our
study and our admiration, to look at it through our
author's eyes before making conclusions on the evidence
of our own. For an ultimate, if not for an elementary
appreciation of the finest work, a knowledge of its
genesis is essential. To know that Shelley's <i>Adonais</i>
was a lament for the death of Keats expands our just
appreciation of it, and we are the poorer because we
do not know the genesis of Shakespeare's sonnets.</p>

<p>There is another reason as well that redeems from the
charge of idle inquisitiveness our desire to know all
we can about the private lives of certain individuals.
A man may have been eminent in action or distinguished
in the arts, but it is not to enhance our appreciation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
his achievements that we study his private life. We do
not, for instance, read the most entrancing biography
in the world in order to enlarge our appreciation of
<i>Rasselas</i>: in fact, the more we enjoy Boswell's <i>Life</i>
the more we regret that so entrancing a companion as
Johnson ever spent in writing the precious hours he
might have devoted to conversation. We want to
know more and yet more about the man and his ways
and his robust oddities and squalor and nobility, for the
sake of acquaintance with him himself, and for no other
reason whatever. I do not know how many people
nowadays read <i>Rasselas</i>, but they cannot amount to
one per cent. of those who read Boswell, and even of
that one per cent. a large fraction must have embarked
on their task because they already knew the biography.
Johnson in fact no longer connotes to us the classical
author of his day, but the subject of Boswell's book,
and we want to learn about him not for what he wrote
but for what he was.</p>

<p>In the case of the Brontës our interest in their private
lives is justified by both these reasons: they were in
themselves of most strange and unusual individuality,
and two of them, Charlotte and Emily, produced books
that profoundly stir our interest and our imagination:
it is no desire to pry into private life that makes us want
to see these books in the round. A noble flower of
literature sprang from a soil which we should have
thought was of so arid a nature that the budding and
blossoming of such, miraculous in itself by reason of
its power or its beauty, is doubly miraculous, by reason
of the very unlikelihood, on <i>a priori</i> grounds, of its
having blossomed there at all. And when we find that,
in the living-room of a grim and meagre parsonage,
girt about by moors and graveyard and charged with
an atmosphere of hatred and heroism, of thwarted
ambitions and acclaimed achievement, there worked two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
sisters who, vastly differing in talent and temperament,
have for ever enriched English literature, the one by
a romance of supreme genius and by a few lyrics whose
authentic magic ranks them with <i>Kubla Khan</i> and
Keats's <i>Ode to the Nightingale</i>, the other by two novels
which, easily outlasting ephemeral foibles, will always
hold their place among classical masterpieces, it is
inevitable that we should want to learn all we can
not only about the books themselves, but about the
strange solitary girls who wrote them. Anything in
their lives that throws real light on their books, anything
in their books which can be shown to throw real light
on their lives, is our legitimate concern.</p>

<p>The earliest of the books about the Brontës, and the
only one whose author knew any of them personally,
is the admirable <i>Life of Charlotte Brontë</i>, which, at her
father's request, was written by Mrs. Gaskell and
published, two years after Charlotte's death, in 1857.
Though she did not come in contact with Charlotte
till within five years of her death and never saw her
sisters or her brother, she at once became an esteemed
though never an intimate friend. Her task was a
labour of love. 'I weighed every line,' she said, 'with
my whole power and heart, so that every line should
go to its great purpose of making her known and
valued.' That surely is a very proper spirit for the
biographer, and Mrs. Gaskell produced an admirable
book which will always rank high for its technical
excellence. But it is possible to have too much of the
proper spirit, if the biographer's object is to produce
a human and a faithful portrait. He has no right to
suppress or soften harsh features and characteristic
traits in his hero because they would interfere with the
impression, founded on his own admiration, which he
desires to produce. We do not ask that failings should
be exaggerated, and limitations too hardly defined, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
we are right to demand from the biographer such
presentation of them as is necessary to a true picture.
We know from Charlotte's own letters that there was
a vast deal of hardness and intolerance in her nature,
and Mrs. Gaskell's image of her, as entirely tender
and loving and patient under cruel trials and disappointments,
robs her, with the best motives, of her
actual individuality. These suppressions, which render
her so much less real, were deliberate: we find that
Mrs. Gaskell, with the evidence of Charlotte's letters in
front of her, leaves out important passages which clearly
convey what she was at pains to suppress.</p>

<p>Sometimes these omissions are simply puerile. Charlotte,
for instance, writing to Ellen Nussey when her
authorship of <i>Shirley</i>, which she vainly hoped to
conceal, became known at Haworth, exclaimed 'God
help, keep and deliver me!': Mrs. Gaskell, though
transcribing from the letter in front of her, emends:
'Heaven help, keep and deliver me.' Such small
though numerous alterations are of no consequence,
but when it comes to Mrs. Gaskell quoting from
Charlotte's letters to M. Héger and deliberately suppressing
all that showed that she was writing love-letters
to him, the omission becomes serious, because
it leaves out crucial and essential experiences. This
point is more fully dealt with in its place. Moreover,
though she brought to her task those excellent gifts
which had already placed her high in the ranks of
English novelists, her skilled instincts as a novelist
were often a snare to her. The late Sir Edmund Gosse,
one of our finest critics, once said to me, 'Nobody but
a novelist should be allowed to write a biography, but
he must remember that he is not now writing a novel,'
and it must be confessed that Mrs. Gaskell was terribly
forgetful of that. In her admirable zeal to make her
friend known and valued she sometimes fobs us off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
with fiction, forgetting that, though a novelist's business
is to create characters, it is the business of a biographer
to render them, and that the tact of omission, when
too unscrupulous, becomes a falsification.</p>

<p>The first edition of Mrs. Gaskell's book appeared in
two volumes, and she soon found herself the centre of
a swarm of hornets. Forgetful that she ought to have
been dealing with facts, she had taken very insufficient
pains about establishing them, and not only was she
threatened with two libel actions, but Mr. Brontë, at
whose request she had undertaken the work, was furious,
as we shall presently see, with what she had said about
him. She had to issue a public apology in <i>The Times</i>
to avert one of these threatened actions, and when her
book was reissued make important omissions: references
to these will be made in their due place. She
had been inconceivably careless in accepting as true
unsifted gossip, always with the intention of blackening
the shadows round her central figure and thereby
increasing the lustre of its shining, and now she retracted
and omitted and, in fact, did all she possibly
could to minimise the pain her carelessness had given
others, and incidentally to save herself from serious
consequences. But subsequent authors of Brontë-Saga
have not scrupled to repeat as accredited facts what
Mrs. Gaskell was obliged to withdraw because they
were not, and many of these have taken their place in
what we may call the Canon: it is for this reason alone
that I have called attention to the passages which
Mrs. Gaskell herself withdrew. It is difficult to avoid
the conclusion that these writers were aware of what
they were doing: such passages only appear in the
earliest editions of her book, and the history of their
excision must have been within the knowledge of
subsequent authors.</p>

<p>But a fervour of excitement, almost a religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
enthusiasm, seems often to inspire the pens of those
who write about the Brontës, and we find that under
the spell and fascination of their subject they are apt
to become a little careless about facts and very prolific
in fancy. Usually they select one of the sisters as the
particular object of their adoration: there are Emily-ites;
there are Charlotte-ites; there are, faintly and less fervently,
Anne-ites, each of whom sets up a golden
image of its goddess and omits the feet of clay. In a
minor degree there are those who espouse the cause of
the unhappy brother Branwell, and seek to sponge off a
little of the blackness with which all the rest unanimously
daub him. But this partisanship, with all its fanatical
suppressions and inventions, tends to defeat its own
object, and, instead of elucidating, only succeeds in
piling up round the object of its devotion cartloads of
apocryphal rubbish which were better away, and while
it decks the adored image with highly coloured robes of
splendour, obscures its figure and its face. Charlotte
and Emily alike lose all power of movement under the
hieratic robes into which they have been thrust: they
have become, in certain of these books, as doll-like as
Madonnas decked out for ecclesiastical festival by
Sisters of Charity, and, under this pious decoration of
rouge and jewels and haloes, are stiffened into immobility.
Such embellishments do not become them,
and part of the object of the ensuing pages is to clear
some of them away.</p>

<p>But the difficulties in the way of anyone who seeks,
without sentimentality on the one hand or malice on the
other, to get as near as may be to the truth about the
immortal denizens of Haworth Parsonage, are of the
most baffling sort, so full of contradictions and discrepancies
are the authorities which must be consulted.
Infinitely the most important of these is Charlotte Brontë
herself, for her letters and certain biographical notices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
she wrote about her sisters supply us with at least nine-tenths
of our first-hand knowledge about the family.
Yet even she falls into such extraordinary errors about
their ages and simple matters of that sort that the
harassed biographer knows not where to look for the
most trivial certainties. Three times, for instance, in
her letters and biographical notices of her sisters does
she misstate Emily's age: she published certain
posthumous poems saying that Emily wrote them in
her sixteenth year, when Emily was at least in her
eighteenth year; she says that Emily was twenty when
she went to Brussels, whereas she was twenty-three; and
when Emily, in her thirty-first year, lay dying, she
wrote to a doctor saying that she was in her twenty-ninth
year. This consistency of error, in fact, makes us
think that Charlotte did not know how old Emily was.</p>

<p>Such wrong information as this accounts for the
despair of the biographer in arriving at what I have
called 'trivial certainties,' which are not, however, of
much importance except to pedants. But no one can
consider trivial anything that concerns the intimate and
psychical history of the sisters and their books, and
when the biographer addresses himself to these more
important matters, he finds himself encumbered by so
great a cloud of witnesses and so belligerent an array of
the furious partisans of individual sisters, who contradict
each other (and occasionally themselves) with so
copious an outpouring of vials of scorn on any who
take views divergent from their own, that in the end
his wisest course is to reject as possibly apocryphal any
romantic conjecture, often given as firm fact, which is
not endorsed by some such basic authority as Charlotte
Brontë's letters, or by inferences that can with certainty
be drawn from the books themselves. But well-merited
confusion and disaster awaits him who attempts to
reconcile the conflicting statements made by enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
partisans of different sisters, so rich are they in suppressions
and omissions which would have invalidated
their theories, and in inventions which support them,
and I have founded my narrative almost completely on
Charlotte's letters.</p>

<p>But, indeed, to take part in so controversial but fascinating
a subject as this is rather like entering a den of
lions without believing oneself to be in any way a Daniel,
and my bones, I am aware, may presently be scattered
before the pit.</p>

<p class="title">NOTE</p>

<p>The executors of the late Mr. Clement Shorter
have most generously given me leave to use and
quote from all the letters of Charlotte Brontë of
which he held the copyright. Without such permission
it would have been impossible to present the
ensuing picture of her, derived as it is, almost entirely,
from this copyright material. I therefore wish to acknowledge
my full and grateful sense of the indulgence
they have so liberally given to me. These letters are
a mine of material, and their permission has enabled me
to coin, so to speak, with whatever awkwardnesses and
failures in striking, much unminted treasure.</p>

<p>All extracts from letters come out of Mr. Clement
Shorter's book <i>The Brontës</i> (Hodder &amp; Stoughton,
1908), unless it is stated otherwise. To avoid an
endless array of footnotes, individual references are
not given to these unless for some reason they are
difficult to find.</p>

<p class="title">NOTE</p>

<p class="center"><i>On a Spurious Portrait of Charlotte Brontë</i></p>

<p>There is another supposed portrait of Charlotte Brontë in the National
Portrait Gallery, though not on exhibition, besides that by George Richmond.
It is a water-colour sketch signed 'Paul Hegér [<i>sic</i>] 1850,' and the inscription
on the back declares it to be a sketch of her from life by M. Héger. The
reasons against its being genuine are numerous and convincing:</p>

<p>(i) Charlotte never went to Brussels after her return to England in 1844,
nor was M. Héger in England in 1850. The picture, therefore, could not
have been done from life.</p>

<p>(ii) M. Héger's name was not Paul Héger, but Constantin Héger. He
appears in <i>Villette</i> as 'Paul Emmanuel,' which may account for the confusion
in the mind of the person who signed it.</p>

<p>(iii) Though Constantin Héger had a son called Paul, he was not in 1850
more than six or eight years old. The drawing is that of a trained and competent
artist.</p>

<p>(iv) The accent on the name 'Hegér' [<i>sic</i>] is misplaced.</p>

<p>(v) The picture does not bear the smallest resemblance to George
Richmond's picture of Charlotte Brontë, which was drawn from life.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHARLOTTE BRONTË<br>
CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<p>When the Reverend Patrick Brontë arranged with Mrs.
Gaskell that she should undertake to write the life of
his daughter Charlotte he supplied her, by letters and
interviews, with information about her subject, and
included therein some slight history of his own early
life. He was the eldest of the ten children of Hugh
Brontë, a small farmer in County Down, Ireland.</p>

<blockquote><p>There was some family tradition, [she tells us] that humble
as Hugh Brontë's circumstances were, he was the descendant
of an ancient family. But about this neither he nor his
descendants have cared to enquire.... He opened a public
school at the early age of sixteen, and this mode of living he
continued to follow for five or six years.</p></blockquote>

<p>That makes a picturesque prelude: we feel interested
at once in this remarkable boy who was to be the father
of such illustrious children. But it was as well, for the
sake of romantic origins, that further inquiries were not
made in the parish of Drumballyroney, County Down,
where, on March 17, 1777, Patrick Brontë was born,
for it would have been found that his father was a
stranger to the noble surname which his eldest son
subsequently assumed, and had been always known as
Hugh Brunty, peasant farmer. His family was numerous&mdash;ten
sons and daughters had been born to him.
All these had been entered in the register as Brunty or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Bruntee, and it was Patrick who abandoned the ancient
patronymic of his family and adopted the more modern
Brontë. Nelson, it may be remarked, had been created
Duke of Brontë in 1799, and the new name had a distinction.
But it seems to have been of the ancient
Brontës of County Down (hitherto unknown) that Mr.
Brontë spoke to Mrs. Gaskell, and probably she was
unaware of the existence of the humbler patronymic, or,
knowing, she loyally concealed the family secret. As
for Patrick Brunty, as he then was, having opened a
public school at the age of sixteen, the fact was that he
was an assistant master at the village school. These
trifles, otherwise quite unimportant, have a certain
significance, as being the earliest of those embroideries
which have since disfigured rather than decorated the
household images of the hearth at Haworth.</p>

<p>Patrick Brontë's early history is really more remarkable
when stripped of the august details which he gave to
Mrs. Gaskell. He taught at the village school for some
five or six years, and then for three or four more was
tutor to the family of Mr. Tighe, parson of the parish.
From that remote occupation he was transported, as
on a magic carpet, to the gate of St. John's College,
Cambridge, where he was admitted as an elderly under-graduate
at the age of twenty-five in the year 1802. Boys
then used to go up to the University at the ages of sixteen
or seventeen, and he must have been older than many
of the Fellows of the College. How he managed it,
who paid the fees and the expenses of his year-long
board and lodging and clothing (for he never went
back to Ireland) is quite unknown. His father, Hugh
Brunty, small peasant farmer, with ten children to rear,
can hardly have done so, and it is improbable that he
could have saved enough himself. The most reasonable
conjecture is that Parson Tighe helped him. Patrick
was a tall, extremely handsome young man; he was full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
of intelligence, vitality, and ambition, and the guess (for
it is no more) that this benevolent clergyman saw that
money could not be better spent than in giving his
children's tutor a chance is probably true.</p>

<p>It is worth noting how these instincts for self-education
and for teaching, and this grit in triumphing
over difficulties were transmitted by this young Irishman
to his family, and in especial to Charlotte. From their
earliest years learning was a passion with them all, and
those who outlived childhood, Charlotte and Emily
and Anne, were all governesses before they were out of
their teens, and Branwell, a little later, a tutor. The idea of
setting up a school (though not a public school) was one
of the long-cherished dreams of Haworth, and to fit
herself and her sisters for it Charlotte carried through a
scheme for the further education of herself and Emily
at Brussels, which was scarcely less improbable of
accomplishment, when she conceived it, as that young
Patrick Brontë should, forty years before, have succeeded
in going up to Cambridge from Drumballyroney,
County Down, and getting a University education.
Indomitable will, the power to make and then grasp
opportunities, teaching, authorship, were fruitful in the
blood; while, in minor detail, even as Patrick Brunty,
when he went incredibly forth to make his way in the
world, assumed a more prepossessing surname, so his
daughters, when their destiny declared itself, went
forth to the world as Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell for
fear that an avowal of feminine authorship might prove
a handicap to success.</p>

<p>So Patrick Brunty on his magic carpet went up to
Cambridge, and took his new name and his degree.
A volunteer movement, anticipating the larger and later
organisation, was being developed all over the country
as a defence against possible invasion by the French,
and Lord Palmerston, who came up to St. John's College<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the year after Patrick Brontë, was a member of the
same corps as he: Mr. Brontë told Mrs. Gaskell that
they drilled together. He was ordained in 1806, and
appointed to a curacy in the parish of Wethersfield,
Essex, where he became engaged to a girl named Mary
Burder. There was some opposition on the part of
the girl's uncle to the match, but the end of the matter
was that Mr. Brontë broke the engagement. He did
not apparently mention this episode to Mrs. Gaskell,
nor the sequel to it which will appear later. He then
moved to Yorkshire, where he was curate first at Dewsbury,
and then at Hartshead. While there he published,
in 1811 and 1813, two volumes of poems:
these are <i>Cottage Poems</i> and <i>The Rural Minstrel</i>. Many
of them are definitely religious, and all have a moral.
It is difficult to quote from them: some rather discouraging
verses sent <i>To a Lady on her Birthday</i> may be
taken as typical of his muse:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In thoughtful mood your parents dear,</span>
<span class="i0">Whilst joy shines through the starting tear,</span>

<span class="i0">Your rosy health, and looks benign</span>
<span class="i1">Are sent to heaven for you.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But let me whisper, lovely fair,</span>
<span class="i0">That joy may soon give place to care,</span>
<span class="i1">And sorrow cloud this day;</span>
<span class="i0">Full soon your eyes of startling blue,</span>
<span class="i0">And velvet lips of scarlet hue</span>
<span class="i1">Discoloured, may decay.</span>

<span class="i0">You're but a breathing mass of clay,</span>
<span class="i1">Fast ripening for the grave.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>These volumes cannot have fallen flatter than the
poems published by his daughters thirty-three years later,
of which only two copies were sold, and of them but one
line survives, because it is identical with that heart's-cry
of Jane Eyre's, which was singled out by Mr. Swinburne
as the supreme utterance of Charlotte's genius. This
was taken verbatim from one of Mr. Brontë's poems,
and thus he is responsible for: 'To the finest fibre of
my nature, sir.'</p>

<p>At Hartshead Mr. Brontë met Miss Maria Branwell,
third daughter of a Methodist merchant in Penzance.
Her father and mother were both dead, and she was on
a visit&mdash;visits in those days were affairs that lasted for
many weeks&mdash;to an aunt who had married a Methodist
preacher, Mr. John Fennel, who was Governor of the
Wesleyan Academy at Wood House Grove, near Bradford.
Mr. Brontë, after a brief acquaintance, proposed
to her and was accepted. He kept some letters of hers
written to him during their engagement, gave them in
after years to Charlotte, and they were published for the
first time in their entirety by Mr. Clement Shorter.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
They convey a wholly delightful impression of the
writer; there is about them, as Charlotte felt when
first she saw them thirty years after her mother's death,
a wonderful sweet charm and fineness, a sincere affection
and piety. They are like egg-shell china for transparent
delicacy; they are fresh and virginal as a primrose
growing on some be-smoked Yorkshire moor.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>I will frankly confess [she writes in the earliest of these]
that your behaviour and what I have seen and heard of your
character has excited my warmest esteem and regard, and be
assured that you shall never have cause to repent of any
confidence you may think proper to place in me, and that it
will always be my endeavour to deserve the good opinion
which you have formed, although human weakness may in
some instances cause me to fall short. I do not depend upon
my own strength, but I look to Him who has been my unerring
guide through life and in whose continued protection
and assistance I confidently trust.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then, so we gather, Mr. Brontë made some lover-like
demand that she should protest her affection for him, and
very properly she proceeds:</p>

<blockquote><p>The <i>politeness of others</i> can never make me forget your kind
attentions, neither can <i>I walk our accustomed rounds</i> without
thinking on you, and, why should I be ashamed to add, wishing
for your presence. If you knew what were my feelings while
writing this, you would pity me. I wish to write the truth
and give you satisfaction yet fear to go too far, and exceed
the bounds of propriety.</p></blockquote>

<p>She takes a walk she had taken with him,</p>

<blockquote><p>not wholly without a wish that I had your arm to assist me
and your conversation to shorten the walk. Indeed, all our
walks have now an insipidity in them which I never thought
they would have possessed....</p></blockquote>

<p>Or she hears Mr. Watman preach a very excellent
sermon.</p>

<blockquote><p>He displayed the character of our Saviour in a most affecting
and amiable light. I scarcely ever felt more charmed with
his excellencies, more grateful for his condescension, or
more abased at my own unworthiness: but I lament that my
heart is so little retentive of those pleasing and profitable
impressions....</p></blockquote>

<p>Again and again, without exceeding the bounds of
propriety (though once she addresses him as 'dear
saucy Pat,' which was rather daring for those days), she
assures him of her unalterable affection.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>With the sincerest pleasure do I retire from company to
converse with him whom I love beyond all others. Could
my beloved friend see my heart he would then be convinced
that the affection I bear him is not at all inferior to that which
he feels for me&mdash;indeed I sometimes think that in truth and
constancy it excels.</p></blockquote>

<p>The final letter announces that they are busy at
her uncle's house with making the cakes for the
wedding, and that she has already learned by heart
'the pretty little hymn' he sent her, 'but cannot
promise to sing it scientifically, though I will endeavour
to gain a little more assurance.' Throughout this
delicious little series of letters, extending over four
months, there runs the note of love and piety crystal-clear
in naïve sincerity and sparkling with humorous
touches of demure merriment and chaff of her saucy
Pat. Had Mrs. Brontë lived to bring up the family,
which soon arrived with such speed and regularity,
who knows what kindlier quality, what more indulgent
attitude towards the failings and imperfections of others
might not have softened the judgments of one of her
daughters, have redeemed her only son from a sordid
and premature doom, and even have given to the genius
of the family some solvent for that steely remoteness
with which she surrounded herself? True, we cannot
imagine Emily saying her prayers at her mother's knee
and yet remaining Emily, nor, if she would thereby have
lost anything of her wild pagan mysticism, could we
wish her capable of her mother's pieties; but it is impossible
not to wonder what would have happened if so
lonely and supreme a soul could have had the opportunity
of confiding something of its secret raptures and
despairs to one whose essential tenderness and sympathy
could not have failed to understand something of them.</p>

<p>The marriage of Maria Branwell and Patrick
Brontë took place at Guiseley near Hartshead in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
December 1812, and never again did she return from
the moors and mists of the austere north to the prim
home of her brother, ex-Mayor of Penzance, where the
grates were so beautifully cleaned, and palm trees grew
in those gardens to which the snows of the Yorkshire
moors and the long savage winters of the uplands were
strangers. She was wedded to her dear saucy Pat, and
the bearing of his children was business enough.</p>

<p>At Hartshead were born, in 1813 and 1815, her two
eldest children, Maria and Elizabeth. In 1815 Mr.
Brontë published at Halifax a romance in prose, called
<i>The Cottage in the Wood: or, The Art of Becoming
Rich and Happy</i>, and in the same year he was appointed
curate of Thornton in the parish of Bradford, and was
minister at a chapel of ease called the Bell Chapel.
Here they were on the most intimate social terms with
Mr. John Frith of Kipping House and his motherless
daughter, Elizabeth. Elizabeth kept a diary, and it is a
catalogue of tea-drinkings with the Brontës,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and of
the Brontës drinking tea or dining at Kipping House.
Here there were born to him four more children,
the story of whose lives, short as they were in the
measure of years, forms the tragic and imperishable
history of the Brontës. The eldest of these children
was Charlotte, born on April 21, 1816; the second
was the only boy, Patrick Branwell&mdash;thereafter known
as Branwell&mdash;born on June 26, 1817; the third Emily
Jane, born on July 30, 1818; and the fourth Anne, born
on January 17, 1820.</p>

<p>At Thornton Mr. Brontë wrote the second of his
prose romances, called <i>The Maid of Killarney, or Albion
and Flora</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> <i>The Maid of Killarney</i> contains some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>warnings against the carnal tendencies fostered by
dancing, and, like the rest of Mr. Brontë's works,
derives its sole interest from the fact that the author
was the father of his children. Mrs. Brontë, as well
as her husband, had literary aspirations, and it was at
Thornton that she wrote an essay entitled <i>The Advantage
of Poverty in Religious Concerns</i>. It was intended
for some religious periodical, but was never published
till Mr. Clement Shorter unearthed it. There is a
Calvinistic touch about it, for though the true Christian
can be blithe, as she certainly was, in poverty, finding it
a state which, taken rightly, is attended with innumerable
blessings, it is not necessarily a sign of the Divine
favour, and she concludes:</p>

<blockquote><p>But O, what words can express the great misery of those
who suffer all the evils of poverty here, and that, too, by
their bad conduct and have no hope of happiness hereafter,
but rather have cause to fear the end of this miserable life
will be the beginning of another, infinitely more miserable,
never, never to have an end!</p></blockquote>

<p>Then came the final ecclesiastical 'step' for Mr.
Brontë, and on that step he remained without further
promotion for forty-one years. On February 25, 1820,
he was licensed to the chapelry of Haworth, ten miles
from Bradford and in the parish of that town. Though,
strictly speaking, it was only a perpetual curacy, the
incumbent to all intents and purposes was vicar. He
did not at once go there, for we find that Anne, the
youngest of the family, was baptized at Thornton a
month later. But some time during the spring the move
was made, and from thenceforth, with one exceedingly
important exception, the setting of the Brontë-drama,
was laid at the Parsonage there. Standing at the top
of the steep hill up which the village climbs, it faces,
across a small oblong of walled-in garden, the west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
door of the Church of St. Michael. It is girt about
with the graveyard; the public-house, the 'Black Bull,'
is neighbourly; a 'short lone lane' leads to the moors.
These four, parsonage and church, public-house and
moors, are the main furnishing of the scene. Of them
the church is the least significant and the moors the
most, for from the moors came <i>Wuthering Heights</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<p>The house was small for this family of eight persons.
On the ground floor to right and left of the flagged
passage from the front door were two parlours: that
on the left was the dining-room and family sitting-room;
to the right was Mr. Brontë's study where, in later years,
he took his midday dinner alone, being vexed with
digestive troubles and preferring solitude. At the back
was a kitchen, and a store-room big enough to be converted
later into a studio for Branwell, when he took to
painting and meant to make it his career. Upstairs
were four bedrooms, and over the flagged passage of
entrance a further slip of a room without a fireplace.
We may dismiss therefore as apocryphal the lurid tale
which has crept into the Brontë-Saga, with a view to
heightening the picturesque horror of the early years of
the sisters, that all five of them slept together in this
closet, since there is no apparent reason why some or
all of them should not sleep in the other bedrooms.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have traced little more than the bare
events in the life of Mr. Brontë up to the time of his
appointment to Haworth, but in the first edition of Mrs.
Gaskell's work, which presently brought the hornets
about her, she launches into details of the most lurid
sort about his manners and his habits. She acquired
her facts, she tells us, from a 'good old woman in
Haworth,' who had been Mrs. Brontë's nurse in her last
illness. Mrs. Brontë died in 1821, and thus it was thirty-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>four
years after the time to which it refers, when Mrs.
Gaskell, collecting materials for the <i>Life of Charlotte
Brontë</i>, obtained the information on which she founded
the following account:</p>

<blockquote><p>She told me that one day when the children had been out
on the moors and rain had come on, she thought their feet
would be wet, and accordingly she rummaged out some
coloured boots which had been given them by a friend....
These little pairs she ranged round the kitchen fire to warm,
but, when the children came back, the boots were no where
to be found, only a very strong odour of burned leather was
perceived. Mr. Brontë had come in and seen them: they
were too gay and luxurious for his children, and would foster
the love of dress; so he had put them into the fire. He spared
nothing that offended his antique simplicity. Long before
this someone had given Mrs. Brontë a silk gown; either the
make or the colour or the material was not according to his
notions of consistent propriety, and Mrs. Brontë in consequence
never wore it. But for all that she kept it treasured
up in her drawers, which were generally locked. One day,
however, while in the kitchen, she remembered that she had
left the key in her drawer, and hearing Mr. Brontë upstairs,
she augured some ill to her dress, and, running upstairs,
she found it cut into shreds.... He did not speak when he
was annoyed or displeased, but worked off his volcanic wrath
by firing pistols out of the back door in rapid succession.
Mrs. Brontë, lying in bed upstairs, would hear the quick
explosions, and know that something had gone wrong: but
her sweet nature thought invariably of the bright side, and she
would say, 'Ought I not to be thankful that he never gave
me an angry word?' Now and then his anger took a different
form but still was speechless. Once he got the hearth-rug
and stuffing it up the grate, deliberately set it on fire, and
remained in the room, in spite of the stench, until it had
smouldered and shrivelled away into uselessness. Another
time he took some chairs, and sawed away at the backs till they
were reduced to the condition of stools. I have named
these instances of eccentricity in the father because I hold the
knowledge of them to be necessary for a right understanding
of a life of his daughter.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>This is a lurid picture, and even if Mrs. Gaskell would
have gone bail for the memory and the accuracy of her
aged informant, and really believed that the knowledge
of these facts was necessary for the right understanding
of the life of the daughter of so violent a lunatic, it was
exceedingly rash of her to have picked up from an old
woman in Haworth these unconfirmed stories of the
man at whose request she was writing his daughter's
biography, and to have published them in his lifetime
was scarcely decent. He was an old man and ailing,
already close on his eightieth birthday; perhaps Mrs.
Gaskell thought he would be dead before the book came
out. Again he could no longer read much, and she may
have thought that he would never ascertain what, on
the authority of the good old woman, she had written
about him. But justice and retribution decreed that
he should still be alive, and that his son-in-law Mr.
Nicholls, Charlotte's widower, should read aloud to
him these delirious paragraphs about himself. A milder
man than he would have been annoyed, and Mr. Brontë
was furious. He stated to Mr. William Dearden, who
had been a friend of his son Branwell, that these stories
were wholly untrue.</p>

<blockquote><p>'I did not know,' he said, with a certain grim irony, 'that I
had an enemy in the world who would traduce me before my
death till Mrs. Gaskell's Life of Charlotte appeared. Everything
in that book which relates to my conduct to my family
is either false or distorted. I never did commit such acts as
are there ascribed to me.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Then he must have got hold of the source of these
libels, for in a subsequent interview he told Mr. Dearden
that Mrs. Gaskell had listened to village scandal and
got her information from some discarded servant.
That was precisely what had happened, for the good
old woman who had been Mrs. Brontë's nurse had
been dismissed from his service. No doubt when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Mr. Brontë said that some of these stories were
'distorted,' he alluded to his alleged habit of firing
pistols out of the back door in rapid succession as
a speechless method of expressing annoyance. That
was founded on the fact that in the early days of his
incumbency he was on the side of the law against the
Luddites, and, as Mrs. Gaskell herself says, was
unpopular among the mill-workers. He used, therefore,
to carry a loaded pistol up to bed with him and discharge
it next morning out of the window.</p>

<p>We can test the general accuracy of the good old
woman's memory by the story she told Mrs. Gaskell
of the six Brontë children often walking out hand in
hand towards the moors, at the time when she was
nursing their mother. When Mrs. Brontë died, Anne
the youngest was only twenty months old, having been
born in January 1820, and precocious as they all were,
it is impossible to credit such early athleticism. The
same informant, in a speech Mrs. Gaskell quotes verbatim,
told her that the children were never given
flesh-food of any sort; potatoes were their entire dinner.
Also that with only young servants in the house there
was, in the absence of a mistress's supervision, much
waste going on with regard to food. More retribution
followed on these garrulities, for there were still living
in Haworth, when Mrs. Gaskell's book came out, two
sisters, Nancy and Sarah Garrs, one of whom had come
with the Brontës from Thornton, while the other had
entered Mr. Brontë's service at Haworth. He now gave
them, as a counterblast to these accusations, a written
testimonial that they had not been wasteful but had been
admirable servants in all respects, and Nancy, the cook-general,
deposed that the children's dinner every day
consisted of beef or mutton followed by milk pudding.
Not exciting, but not potatoes. In turn she gave a
testimonial to her old master, and said that 'there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
was never a more affectionate father, never a kinder
master.... He was not of a violent temper at all,
quite the reverse!'<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Brontë then wrote to Mrs. Gaskell, saying that her
whole narrative concerning him and his habits and his
relations to his family were false, and requested her to
cancel it in the next edition of her book. 'To this,' he
said, 'I received no other answer than that Mrs. Gaskell
was unwell and not able to write.'<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> She was, as will
appear, being threatened at the time by two libel actions
arising out of other contents of her book, and no
doubt was busy. Two editions of it had already
appeared, but from the third edition onwards, these
sensational and unfounded stories were omitted.</p>

<p>Now the trouble arose from Mrs. Gaskell's forgetfulness
that she was now writing a biography and not a
romance. There is every reason to suppose that
Mr. Brontë had a high, even a violent, temper, but she
had obtained her instances of it from a tainted source, and
they seem to have been unfounded. She did what she
could, by withdrawing them, to repair the needless pain
they had given, and having done that she had made such
amends as were in her power for having published them
at all. But the mischief did not end there, and these
stories are believed by many Brontë students to this day,
for regardless of the fact that she cancelled them, as being
untrue, biographers who have followed her have had no
hesitation in disinterring such discredited stuff from her
unexpurgated editions and giving it renewed currency
with comments. Sir T. Wemyss Reid, for instance, who,
chronologically, is the next successor to Mrs. Gaskell,
repeats the legend of the pistol firing, exuberantly adding
fresh details. The villagers, he tells us, were quite
accustomed to the sound of pistol shots 'at any hour of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>the day' from their pastor's house: Mr. Brontë not only
deliberately cut to bits his wife's pretty dress but
'presented her with the tattered fragments.' He tells us
that it was Mrs. Brontë's lot to 'submit to persistent
coldness and neglect,' and that she lived 'in perpetual
dread of her lordly master.'<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This is falsification, for
since he got these stories of violence from Mrs. Gaskell's
book, he must have found there also her record that
Mrs. Brontë used to say, 'Ought I not to be thankful that
he never gave me an angry word?' Unkindness to his
wife was thus incorporated into the Brontë-Saga, and
a monstrous disregard of the proper diet for young
children has been deduced from the apocryphal story
that they had only potatoes for dinner. My only object
in referring to what Mrs. Gaskell withdrew is that, though
it was withdrawn, it has been served up again by others.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mrs. Brontë lived only eighteen months after the
family came to Haworth, and died of internal cancer in
September 1821. It is curious that Charlotte, whose
childish memories were so extraordinarily vivid, and who
was five and a half years old when she died, could
remember practically nothing of her mother. She could
recall only the picture of her playing with Branwell, then
aged four, in the parlour. Towards the end, when too
weak to move, Mrs. Brontë used to ask her nurse to
raise her in bed, so that she might see the grate being
cleaned, for the servant cleaned it in the way it was done
in Cornwall. She was buried at Haworth, and practically
the whole of what we know of her is derived from those
letters she wrote to Mr. Brontë when she was engaged
to him.</p>

<p>He was now left with six children, the youngest of
whom, Anne, was still little more than eighteen months
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>old, and in the course of the next year there came to live
at Haworth, in order to look after them, Miss Elizabeth
Branwell, Mrs. Brontë's eldest sister, and the Parsonage
was her home until her death. She lived much in her
bedroom, where she taught her nieces to sew, and where
there were grouped round her a spinster's household
gods&mdash;an Indian workbox, a workbox with a china top,
and a 'Japan' dressing-box: she took snuff out of a small
gold box. After the warmth and sunny climate of
Penzance, where snow and frost were as unknown as in
the valley of Avilion, she hated this bleak and wintry
upland, and habitually wore pattens in the house for fear
of the chill of the stone stairs stabbing through her shoes.
The Branwell family in Penzance mixed much in social
circles, but here there were no circles of any sort: it was
a dismal change, and we must credit her with having
been a woman with a strong sense of moral obligation to
have given up all that constituted life's amenities at the
call of duty. She had an income of her own, derived
from investments, of £50 a year, out of which she contributed
to household expenses, and shortly before her
death she showed that she was a woman of generous
impulses. Her favourite among the children was
Branwell, and he of them all was the only one who ever
wrote of her with affection, and, after her death, with
regret. She seems to have been lacking in lightness and
geniality. We can find, at any rate, no hint of the gentle
gaiety and tenderness of her sister, and in the absence of
such evidence she has been fashioned into a grim, forbidding
personage. Commentators, with the passion for
identifying all the characters in Charlotte's novels with
people whom she had known, have pounced on this poor
lady as being the 'original' of Mrs. Reed in <i>Jane Eyre</i>,
and have suggested that in the bedroom where she
taught her nieces to sew, she kept a switch with which she
used 'to lace the quivering palm or shrinking neck' for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
misdeeds they had never committed. The evidence
rests entirely on the fact that Charlotte and her sisters
used to sew in Miss Branwell's bedroom, and Jane Eyre
used to be whipped in Mrs. Reed's bedroom.</p>

<p>Mr. Brontë, after his sister-in-law's advent, made two
attempts to marry again. Miss Elizabeth Firth, who
had been friends with the family at Thornton, was his
first choice, but the lady was already engaged to the
Rev. James Franks, Vicar of Huddersfield. Then he
harked back to the days of his curacy at Wethersfield,
and wrote a quite amazing letter to Miss Mary Burder,
to whom he had once been engaged, but whom he had
subsequently thrown over, informing her how he had
improved in the last fifteen years, how popular he was in
his parish (the Vicar of Dewsbury would bear him out),
and how eager to make up to her for the disappointment
he had caused her. She replied with singular clarity,
piously thanking God that He had already preserved
her from the fate of being his wife, but she wished him
nothing but well. A second appeal produced no sign
of softening, and he resigned himself to celibacy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<p>For a little while yet as regards the early history of
Mr. Brontë's children, we have, before we get to firmer
ground, to continue to get our information from what
he told Mrs. Gaskell. They were studious and highly
intelligent children: Branwell, perhaps, was the most
promising of them all, but at the age of ten Maria used
to study the Parliamentary debates in the newspapers,
and could discuss with her father the leading topics of
the day, with the grasp and perception of an adult. He
suspected that all of them thought more deeply than
appeared on the surface, and knowing that they were
very shy, he adopted the strangest device that ever
entered a father's head to encourage fluency and frankness
in the mouths of these babes and sucklings. He found a
mask in his study; he set his children in a row, and bade
them each assume it in turn, so that they might speak
boldly under cover of it, and answer the cosmic questions
he put to them. This unique plan, instead of terrifying
them, produced the most gratifying results. He began
with the youngest, and question and answer ran as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Mr. Brontë.</span> Anne, what does a child like you most
want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> (aged four). Age and experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Brontë.</span> Emily, what had I best do with your brother
Branwell, when he is a naughty boy?</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Emily</span> (aged five). Reason with him, and when he won't
listen to reason, whip him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Brontë.</span> Branwell, what is the best way of knowing
the difference between the intellects of man and woman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Branwell</span> (aged six). By considering the difference between
them as to their bodies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Brontë.</span> Charlotte, what is the best book in the
world?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> (aged seven or eight). The Bible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Brontë.</span> And what is the next best, Charlotte?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlotte.</span> The Book of Nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Brontë.</span> Elizabeth, what is the best mode of education
for a woman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> (aged eight or nine). That which would make
her rule her house well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Brontë.</span> Maria, what is the best mode of spending
time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria</span> (aged ten or eleven). By laying it out in preparation
for a happy eternity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now Mr. Brontë vouched for the substantial exactness
of these answers to his questions; they made (and no
wonder) 'a deep and lasting impression' on his memory,
and the story must therefore be treated with the utmost
respect. But we cannot help wondering whether his
memory of the manner of the questions was as exact as
that of the answers. We admit that they were very
remarkable children. We know, on indisputable evidence,
that at a very early age Charlotte and Branwell wrote
prodigious quantities of poems, tales, articles, dramas,
magazines and novels, but we find difficulty here in
accepting the literal truth of Mr. Brontë's account. Take
Anne. Anne, we have already seen, is recorded to have
walked on the moors with her brother and sisters when
she was only twenty months old. A baby who did that
was almost <i>capable de tout</i>; but could even she, at the age
of four, when asked what a child like her most wanted,
answer straight off 'Age and experience'? There was
surely a little prompting, something like this:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Mr. Brontë.</span> Now, Anne, take the mask and remember
you are only four years old. Other people are much older.
What do you lack?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Brontë.</span> Excellent. And you have seen little of the
world yet, nothing much has happened to you. What else
do you lack?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anne.</span> Experience.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our craving for probabilities demands something of
this sort. Mozart, it is true, composed fugues at the age
of four, but then Mozart fulfilled the promise of his
extraordinary precocity, while Anne, gentle and pious,
gave birth to nothing worthy of her spontaneous insight
at the age of four. The replies of the other children are
hardly less amazing, Branwell's in particular, though it is
difficult to see exactly what he meant. Maria's reply is
infinitely pathetic, for her preparation for eternity was
nearly accomplished.... With this episode Mr. Brontë
makes his last contribution to the chronicles of his
family.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>There had been established in the year 1823 at Cowan
Bridge in the West Riding of Yorkshire a boarding-school
for the education of the daughters of indigent
clergymen. The fees charged were £14 a year, with
certain small supplements, and the girls wore a uniform
which was provided for them: £3 was charged for this.
So small a sum for board and education did not cover the
running expenses of the place, and the Reverend William
Carus Wilson, who was mainly responsible for its
establishment, had got together a body of annual subscribers,
and their contributions paid for the salaries of
the mistresses and other outgoings. Mr. Brontë no
doubt had heard well of the school, and in July 1824, a
year after it had been opened, he entered his two eldest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
daughters as pupils. Maria and Elizabeth had lately
suffered from measles and whooping-cough, and it was
doubtful whether they were well enough to go.</p>

<p>Mr. Brontë took them there himself: he stayed at the
school, he ate his meals with the children, and he was
shown over the whole establishment. He must presumably
have been satisfied that the pupils were well
looked after and cared for, for he returned there again in
August, bringing with him Charlotte, aged eight, and
again in November, bringing Emily, aged six. His
four eldest daughters were thus all at Cowan Bridge
together. Of them individually during their schooldays
we know little. Maria was constantly in disgrace, owing
to habits common to children who have not sufficient
physical control, and was often punished by a junior
mistress called Miss Andrews in a harsh and excessive
manner. Elizabeth had some accident in which she cut
her head, and Miss Evans, the senior mistress, looked after
her with the greatest care, taking her to sleep in her own
room. Charlotte was described as a bright, clever little
child; the youngest, Emily, was the pet of the school.
During the ensuing spring of 1825 there broke out some
epidemic spoken of as 'low fever,' and probably allied to
influenza. Mr. Carus Wilson did everything possible for
the girls sick of this 'low fever' in the way of diet and
medical attendance, and evidently the epidemic was not
of any severe or malignant type, for only one girl died,
and that from after-effects. None of the four Brontë
girls caught it, but in February 1825, while it was prevalent,
Maria became seriously ill, and Mr. Brontë, who
had not known that she was ailing, was sent for, and he
took her back to Haworth, where she died of consumption
on May 6. He certainly did not attribute her illness to
ill-treatment or neglect, for the other three girls remained
at Cowan Bridge. Then, at the end of May, Elizabeth
was seen to be suffering from the same symptoms as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Maria, and was taken back to Haworth, and Charlotte
and Emily went home a week afterwards. Elizabeth
died, also of consumption, on June 15.</p>

<p>The school continued to prosper, and was subsequently
moved from Cowan Bridge to Casterton, where in 1848
it was doing excellent work, providing the pupils with
places as governesses and starting them on their careers.
During these intervening years Charlotte, in her very
voluminous and intimate correspondence, never alluded
to her own schooldays at Cowan Bridge, nor to those of
her sisters. But she was pondering certain things in her
heart, keeping them close, as in a forcing-glass, and letting
none of the heat and the bitterness in which she grew
them escape in trivial utterance. Then, in 1846, she
took up the forcing-glass of her silence and her concentration,
and, in <i>Jane Eyre</i> (published the next year),
branded with infamy the school which she had left at
the age of nine. Nowadays we know to some extent
what the psychological effect of such suppression is.
Painful impressions made on a child's mind grow to
monstrous proportions, and the adult mind fully believes
in the actuality of its own distortions.</p>

<p>There is no need to go, with any detail, into those
chapters in <i>Jane Eyre</i> which deal with the Orphan
Asylum at Lowood. It suffices to say that Charlotte
Brontë avowed that they were drawn accurately and
faithfully from life. 'Lowood' was Cowan Bridge;
'Helen Burns' was her sister Maria; the black marble
clergyman, 'Naomi Brocklehurst,' was Mr. Carus Wilson;
the epidemic was typhus, and it caused many girls to die
at their homes when they were removed there, others
to die at school. But by no possibility can the 'low
fever' which broke out at Cowan Bridge, when she was
at school there, have been typhus; for typhus is an
exceedingly deadly fever, a plague of the Middle Ages,
and the rate of mortality among its victims is, in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the most skilled attendance and nursing, about twenty-five
per cent. Here, however, out of forty cases there
was, as a matter of fact, only one death, and that from
after-effects, and these in typhus are unknown. When
once the crisis is past, if the patient lives through it,
convalescence is swift and uninterrupted. Jane Eyre
describes the infection as having been due to damp air
coming into the open windows of the school and the
dormitories.</p>

<p>Charlotte expressed regret that Cowan Bridge was
instantly identified, on the publication of <i>Jane Eyre</i>,
as being Lowood, but if a very vivid and gifted writer
uses the utmost of her skill to render unmistakable the
features of the place she describes, she has no business to
be surprised if recognition follows, and her regret must
be suspect. Indeed, it is clear that so far from regretting
it she was pleased with the identification, for she wrote
to her friend, Mr. Williams, saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>I saw an elderly clergyman reading it (<i>Jane Eyre</i>) the
other day, and had the satisfaction of hearing him exclaim,
'Why they have got &mdash;&mdash; School, and Mr. &mdash;&mdash; here, I declare,
and Miss &mdash;&mdash;' (naming the originals of Lowood, Mr.
Brocklehurst and Miss Temple). He had known them all.
I wondered whether he would recognise the portraits, and
was gratified to find that he did, and that, moreover, he pronounced
them faithful and just. He said too, that Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
(Brocklehurst) deserved the chastisement he had got!<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Since the age of nine she had nursed her bitterness of
heart at the death of her sisters till it became an obsession
to her, for not only in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, under the more
licensed imagination of fiction, but in a private letter to
her old friend and mistress, Miss Wooler, who had
asked her for her opinion on Cowan Bridge, she made
the following indictment:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p><blockquote><p>Typhus fever decimated the school periodically and consumption
and scrofula in every variety of form, which bad
air and water, and bad, insufficient diet, can generate preyed
on the ill fated pupils.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is impossible to accept such a statement; it bears
on the face of it its own refutation, for no school periodically
decimated by typhus can possibly continue to exist.
Years of bitter brooding had caused Charlotte to
imagine a state of affairs that was wildly exaggerated.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the awful moral precepts, the
threats of hell and damnation, which she put into the
mouth of Mr. Brocklehurst, the 'black marble clergyman'
and effigy of Mr. Carus Wilson, were founded on
fact. He published, for instance, in 1828, an appalling
little volume called <i>Youthful Memoirs</i>, and edited and
contributed poems to a magazine called the <i>Children's
Friend</i>, which teems with just such sentiments as she
attributed to him. A verse from one of these runs:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It's dangerous to provoke a God</span>
<span class="i1">Whose power and vengeance none can tell;</span>
<span class="i0">One stroke of His almighty rod</span>
<span class="i1">Can send young sinners quick to hell.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>These volumes were, of course, accessible to Charlotte
long before she wrote <i>Jane Eyre</i>, but, whether she saw
them or not, the man who wrote them was certainly
capable of the harangues of Mr. Brocklehurst.</p>

<p>Then came Mrs. Gaskell with the first edition of her
<i>Life</i>, and her definite disclosure that Lowood in <i>Jane
Eyre</i> was an accurate picture of Cowan Bridge: it was
no wonder that the hornets came about her. The
porridge for breakfast was often burned and had offensive
foreign fragments in it, the beef was high, the house
morning, noon, and night reeked of rancid fat, the water
in which the rice was boiled was rain water, drained from
the roof into a wooden tub and thence drawn off for the
kitchen, the little Brontës, craving for food, could often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
eat nothing whatever, and when Mr. Carus Wilson
heard complaints about such inedible diet he replied that
the children were to be trained up to regard higher
things than dainty pampering of the appetite, and lectured
them on the sinfulness of their carnal propensities. The
epidemic of typhus is duly recorded, and its cause
definitely assigned to the state of semi-starvation in which
the pupils were kept. Mrs. Gaskell did not, she expressly
tells us in a later edition of her book, get her information
from Charlotte Brontë, who never spoke to her
about Mr. Carus Wilson at all, and only once alluded to
Cowan Bridge and the careless way in which the food
was prepared, but she based her narrative on <i>Jane
Eyre</i>, collecting also stories that suited her picture without
verifying them or finding out whether there was
rebutting evidence. She was threatened with a libel
action, she was bombarded with letters from old pupils
at Cowan Bridge, expressing the highest regard and
affection for Mr. Carus Wilson, and their appreciation of
the admirable way in which the school was conducted.
As for the revolting diet, all that could be substantiated
was that there had once been a careless cook who spoiled
the porridge and was dismissed.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Gaskell made the needful omissions and
additions in her account, confessing that it had been
one-sided; but here, again, her successors in the Brontë-Saga
have adopted her original and discarded version,
adding appropriate embroideries of their own. From
one we learn that 'during the whole time of their
sojourn there the young Brontës scarcely ever knew what
it was to be free from the pangs of hunger'<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; another
called it 'the counterpart for girls of Mr. Squeers's
Academy for Young Gentlemen'<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>; another announced
that Mr. Carus Wilson 'seems to have pushed his cam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>paign
against the flesh a bit too far, and was surprised at
his own success when one after another the extremely
perishable bodies of these children were laid low by
typhus.'<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Whatever is the truth about Cowan Bridge,
and the sadist cruelties related in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, we must
remember that Mr. Brontë was satisfied with the management
of the school, and that Mrs. Gaskell acknowledged
that she had not, in her <i>Life of Charlotte Brontë</i>, stated
her case against it fairly. After the publication of her
book a highly acrimonious correspondence on the
subject came out in the <i>Halifax Guardian</i>.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>By midsummer 1825 the family, now consisting of the
three sisters and Branwell, were back at Haworth, and
there they remained for five years. They saw little or
nothing of their neighbours. They made no friendships
with children of their own age; for recreation they had
walks on the moors, which already were beginning to
work their spell in the heart of one of them, and they
read omnivorously. The girls helped in the housework;
they did their sewing with their aunt, their father's
library was open to them, and while he taught his son,
Charlotte taught her sisters. And as in the darkness of
the hive the unseen and furious industry of the bees
generates the curtains of wax on which are built the
honey cells, so in the dining-room of the sequestered
parsonage and round the kitchen fire the weaving of
dreams and the exercise of imagination were their
passionate preoccupations, and in the case of Charlotte
and Branwell took shape in ceaseless and profuse
experiment in all forms of the written word. All that
they came across in their father's books and in the tales
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> was material for this honey-gathering;
the news in the daily papers contributed to it;
the public characters of the nation were their pets and
their heroes. The Duke of Wellington and his family
generally were the property of Charlotte, Branwell was
the patron of Napoleon; even the wooden soldiers his
father bought for him were christened Field-Marshals.
The Corn Laws, the Catholic question, Mr. Peel's
speech, Mr. Christopher North, editor of <i>Blackwood's
Magazine</i>, James Hogg, were all grist for their mills:
never were four small children more personally and
vividly concerned in the movements of the world from
which they were so sundered. Nor was it only from the
affairs of the world and from their lessons that they drew
the substance of their dreams, for in the kitchen Tabby
had begun her reign of thirty years over their dinners
and their hearts, and Tabby had stories of fairies in the
glen and moonlit folk of the moorland, and then it was
Emily, now taller than the rest, and the prettiest of her
plain sisters, whose dark eyes kindled. Tabby was far
more than servant, and from the time she came to
Haworth she held a peculiar place in the hearts of them
all. She slipped on a film of ice one day going down the
steep street of Haworth, and, falling, broke her leg. In
the interval the girls did all the housework, but when she
was recovered, Aunt Branwell and Mr. Brontë decided
that she was not up to her work, and must go. Upon
which all the children went on hunger-strike, and Tabby
stayed. Later her lameness caused her to give up her
post, and she lived with her sister in the village for four
years. But the Brontës could not get on without her,
and she returned and died at the age of over ninety, still
in service at the Parsonage, a few weeks only before the
last of her children followed her.</p>

<p>Day-dreams and the Duke of Wellington, fairies by the
beck, and riots at the mills, all went into one common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
vat, from which were brewed poems and dramas and
magazines, and romances and essays. The children
'established plays,' to use Charlotte's words; some
were secret plays, and they were the best. Of these
some seem to have been verbal romances; they constructed
them only in talk, making up adventures;
others were written down, and of such was a play
called <i>The Islanders</i>. Each of them, as they chattered
together by the fire, chose an island and peopled it with
celebrated folk. Charlotte's island was the Isle of
Wight, and, needless to say, the Duke of Wellington and
his two sons and Christopher North were the principal
inhabitants. Out of such developed whole sagas of joint
imagination. Two groups were formed. Charlotte and
Branwell collaborated over a state called Angria, somewhere
in the West of Africa, near the delta of the Niger.
The Angrians were ruled by King Zamorna, and the
affairs of the Angrians were celebrated in poems and
chronicles. Emily and Anne had another kingdom of
their own devising called Angora, a hyperborean and
mountainous land inhabited by a folk called Gondals,
and ruled by the Emperor Julius; it was the scene of
Royalist and Republican wars. Originally, as we may
guess from the similarity of the names, Angria and
Angora were one, but Charlotte and Branwell preferred
the tropics, Emily and Anne the Arctic regions, and the
joint-play separated into two, and these in turn became
secret plays not common to them all. The Angrian
cycle was the less long-lived; Branwell wrote <i>The
Rising of the Angrians</i> when he was nineteen and
Charlotte twenty, and with that the Angrian-Saga was
finished; but Emily and Anne continued secretly to
play at Gondals with unabated enthusiasm up till the last
years of their lives. Emily was very busy over Gondal
poems at the time when that wondrous genius of hers
was fashioning <i>Wuthering Heights</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>The surviving fragments of prose and poetry that
Charlotte and Branwell produced as children are of no
striking merit. They are such as might have been
written by any clever children with vivid imaginations.
But such a sentence as this, written by Charlotte at the
age of thirteen, not as a literary composition, but as a
mere domestic chronicle, might give pause to anyone
trained, when he reads, to listen for the sound of an
individual voice.</p>

<blockquote><p>One evening, about the time when the cold sleet and
stormy fogs of November are succeeded by the snow storms
and high piercing winds of confirmed winter, we were all
sitting round the warm blazing kitchen fire having just concluded
a quarrel with Tabby concerning the propriety of
lighting a candle, from which she came off victorious, no
candle having been produced....</p></blockquote>

<p>There is something there, a management of words, an
economy in their use, so that they convey as simply as
possible, yet very vividly, the complete scene, which can
hardly fail to strike the connoisseur of style. Charlotte's
virtues are foreshadowed there, just as in an effusion
about the Genii, who</p>

<blockquote><p>in their impudence assert that by their magic they can reduce
the world to a desert, the purest water to streams of livid
poison, and the clearest lakes to stagnant waters, the pestilential
vapours of which will slay all living creatures except
the bloodthirsty beasts of the forest, and the ravenous bird
of the rock,</p></blockquote>

<p>she as clearly foreshadows some of the delirious
imagery in <i>Jane Eyre</i> and <i>Shirley</i>.</p>

<p>But we cannot accept Mrs. Gaskell's account of the
prodigious quantity of these early compositions. She
describes how she had been given a packet of Charlotte's
early manuscripts, a page of which, the opening of a
story called <i>The Secret</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> she reproduced in litho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>graphic
facsimile. It is in a script so minute as to be
almost indecipherable. In this packet we learn was a
paper in Charlotte's handwriting headed as follows:
'Catalogue of my books with the period of their completion
up to August 3rd, 1830.' This catalogue gives
the titles and short descriptions of the poems, stories,
essays, dramas, magazines, and articles she had written
up to date, and at the end of them there is the entry:</p>

<blockquote><p>Making in the whole twenty-two volumes.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">C. Brontë.</span> Aug. 3, 1830.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Gaskell then proceeds:</p>

<blockquote><p>As each volume contains from sixty to a hundred pages,
and the size of the page lithographed is rather less than the
average, the amount of the whole seems very great if we
remember it was all written in about fifteen months. So
much for the quantity.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>...</p></blockquote>

<p>The amount, indeed, is very great; in fact, it is so
incredible that there must be some mistake. For the
lithographed page which Mrs. Gaskell reproduces for us
contains not less than 1280 words. Each volume, so we
are told, contained sixty to a hundred pages, so, if we
take eighty pages as the average length of each volume,
we find that each volume contains 102,400 words.
There are twenty-two of these volumes, written within a
period of fifteen months. In fifteen months, therefore,
Charlotte produced literary compositions containing
2,252,800 words, or an amount equivalent to twenty-two
substantial novels. There is a mistake somewhere.
These volumes, which were small, paper-bound notebooks,
could not have contained so many pages of
closely written script as the page Mrs. Gaskell reproduced.
Still, the literary activities of these five years
were truly enormous. It may be noticed that they did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>not entirely meet with Mr. Brontë's approval, for when,
a few years later, Southey counselled Charlotte in
answer to a letter of hers not to neglect her household
duties for the sake of writing, she replied that her father
had always held the same view.</p>

<p>But even when we have eliminated the impossible and
qualified the improbable, we are left with a picture of
those five years which succeeded the deaths of the two
eldest daughters and the return of Charlotte and Emily
from Cowan Bridge, of unique and extraordinary interest.
There was Mr. Brontë busy with his parochial work,
taking his dinner by himself in his study, going long
walks alone, being called in sometimes to settle disputes
as to the respective genius in generalship of Hannibal
and Napoleon, or tearing open the paper to read to his
excited family a speech of the Duke of Wellington's, but
not having any part in the essential literary passions
of his children; there was Aunt Elizabeth Branwell
clattering about the house in pattens for fear of catching
cold, and living chiefly in her bedroom among her work-boxes;
there was Tabby making scones in the kitchen,
with her stories of the fairies in the glens of the moor,
and refusing to let the children have a candle; and there
were the four children caring nothing for the games and
ordinary pursuits of childhood, and seeing nobody but
the inhabitants of the house. In the catalogue of their
early compositions, Charlotte and Branwell alone seem
to have written at this time, and all the interests of life,
all the products of their imagination, were turned, as by
some process of spontaneous transubstantiation, into
poems and plays and tales of adventure. Whether
Emily and Anne wrote anything during those years we
do not know; no signed and dated manuscripts of theirs
exist, but the theory that Charlotte after their deaths
destroyed most of their manuscripts does not prove that
there were any of this date. Perhaps at this time they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
conducted the affairs of Gondaland only by the spoken
word, though in later years they both wrote poems about
them, signing them by Gondal names, such as Julius
Angora, A. G. Alsaida, Alexandrina Zenobia, and others
of that turbulent and mysterious people. But Emily
already was distilling drop by drop from the moor and
from Tabby's tales of fairies that finest ichor of all,
feeding on a honey-dew unknown to the others.</p>

<p>This completely sequestered life during the formative
years of childhood had inevitable reactions upon them
all; once only, till Charlotte went to school again, do
any of the children appear to have left the Parsonage,
when all together they paid a visit to their aunt,
Mrs. Fennell, and employed their time in drawing. At
the Parsonage itself they saw nobody but each other.
This isolation, teeming though it was with inner interests,
must have fostered, even if it did not produce, Charlotte's
abnormal shyness when she was among strangers, which
was the curse of her maturer years. She was also the
eldest of the four and, with Aunt Branwell immured in
her bedroom and her father in his study, she naturally
took the lead; she managed, she set the tune for them,
and assumed that habit of controlling their destinies,
which she continued to exercise to the end. Then there
was Branwell, brilliant and unstable, Charlotte's particular
friend and confidant, and his aunt's favourite. Quite
unlike his sisters he was gregariously disposed, whereas
they all fled from the face of a stranger. He liked the
company of others, easily winning flattery, and more
easily swallowing it, by the wit and intelligence of his
tongue. He ought, of course, to have been sent to
school, but Mr. Brontë preferred to conduct his mental
education himself, and leave his morals free to develop
in the direction of least resistance. Then there was
Emily, essentially solitary and silent, whose shyness was
such that she would steal from the kitchen on the knock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of the butcher or the baker. On her Haworth and the
open void of the moor cast such a spell that all her life
she pined with home-sickness, whenever she was away
from the bleak home. Then there was Anne, as unlike
her two sisters as Branwell was unlike them all. Her
bent was for gentleness and piety.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<p>An end came for the present to Charlotte's colossal
literary activities, when in January 1831 she went to
school again. For that period of eighteen months she
seems to have written nothing, though Branwell at home
kept the sacred fire burning by composing The <i>History of
the Young Men</i>, and six volumes (notebooks) of <i>Letters
from an Englishman</i>. This new school was an establishment
kept by Miss Margaret Wooler at Roe Head,
not twenty miles from Haworth, and there Charlotte
formed the three most lasting friendships of her life&mdash;one
with the excellent Miss Wooler herself, the others
with two of the pupils. Mary Taylor was one of these,
and it is with the aid of her exceedingly vivid pen, in a
letter to Mrs. Gaskell, that we get the first impression of
how Charlotte struck others outside the family circle at
the Parsonage. It was a forlorn little figure that got out
of the cart with a hood to it that had brought her from
Haworth, and she was dressed in the outlandish fashion
thought suitable by Aunt Branwell for little girls of
fourteen. It was a snowy day, and when she had seen
Miss Wooler she came into the schoolroom, where seven
or eight girls were playing, and stood looking out of the
window, quietly crying. She was very small; so too,
even in proportion to her diminutive stature, were her
hands and feet. Her nose was enormous for that little
face, her mouth was large and crooked, her eyes and
hair were brown. She was desperately shy, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
she spoke it was with an Irish brogue. Then one of the
girls stopped her play and came and spoke to her: she
was to be the third and closest of her lifelong friends,
Ellen Nussey, though at first Charlotte did not like her.
Charlotte was abnormally short-sighted, the books
which she was always reading must be held so close to
her face that her eyes nearly touched them. For games
she had no use at all, for there had been no game played
in the parlour at Haworth; besides, her short sight
entirely prevented her from seeing the ball when it came
to her, and when games were in progress she stood
under the trees and looked at the view.</p>

<p>The self-education system at Haworth had resulted in
strange lacunæ in certain branches of knowledge. In
spite of her literary compositions, Charlotte knew
nothing technically about grammar, and in spite of
the Angrian kingdom in the West of Africa, she knew
nothing about geography. Miss Wooler, therefore,
decided to place her in the second class among the
junior girls of the school, but Charlotte's tears of
humiliation caused her to relent and put her in the first
class, telling her she must work hard and catch up with
the rest. There was never any question about Charlotte
working hard, but it was soon evident that however hard
the others worked they would never catch her up in those
other branches of knowledge which had been part of the
self-imposed curriculum at Haworth. If the first class
was set to learn by heart some stanzas from an admired
English poet suitable for young ladies, it was found that
Charlotte knew them by heart already, and could proceed
to spout the next page or two. If a political discussion
arose about the Reform Bill and the young ladies were
a little vague about the names of Ministers, Charlotte
could repeat for them the complete list of the last two
ministries. That naturally led on to the Duke of
Wellington, and she told them the names of all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
victories in the Peninsular War. Then she drew: it was
a delight to her to get hold of some small print, and
burying her face in it, copy it line by line and touch by
touch, with minute accuracy. She was a marvellous
story-teller of gruesome tales, and realised the highest
ambition of the blood-curdling specialist when one
night she frightened one of her listeners into hysterics.
Weekly she wrote to some member of the family at
Haworth, and oftenest to Branwell, for she found she
had more to say to him than to the others, and though
during her year and a half at Roe Head she embarked
on neither original romance nor magazine, nor poetical
work, she was keeping her hand in with English composition.
The following extract, written to her brother,
has a cramped air about it, suggesting, perhaps, that
Miss Wooler, in the approved style, looked over the
girls' letters home before they were sent.</p>

<blockquote><p>I am extremely glad that Aunt has consented to take in
<i>Fraser's Magazine</i>, for though I know from your description
of its general contents, it will be rather uninteresting when
compared with <i>Blackwood</i>, still it will be better than
remaining the whole year without being able to obtain a
sight of any periodical whatever: and such would assuredly
be our case, as, in the little moorland village where we reside,
there would be no possibility of borrowing a work of that
description from a circulating library. I hope with you that
the present delightful weather may contribute to the perfect
restoration of our dear papa's health and that it may give
Aunt pleasant reminiscences of the salubrious climate of her
native place.</p></blockquote>

<p>After that we feel Miss Wooler would have been quite
safe not to censor any more of Charlotte's letters home.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Here we must leave for a space the actual chronicle of
events, and detach from it an emotional thread that for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
years was of vividest colour in Charlotte's life, and continued,
more soberly hued, to the end of it. This was
her passionate affection for Ellen Nussey, whom she
first saw when she arrived at Miss Wooler's school, and
whom at first she did not take to. But that indifference
soon passed and gave place to one of those violent
homosexual attachments which, so common are they
among adolescents of either sex, must be considered
normal rather than abnormal. They are full of yearnings
and sentiment and aspirations, of blind devotion
that tortures itself with enchanting fires, and presently
burns out into cinders of indifference as often as it
survives in the glow of friendship. But at the age of
sixteen, Charlotte writes to her friend saying that she
believes 'our friendship is destined to form an exception
to the general rule regarding school-friendships,' and the
sequel proved how right she was: this was not quite
an ordinary <i>schwärm</i>. After she left Miss Wooler's, a
monthly correspondence was instituted, of which many
of Charlotte's letters remain, but she did not keep Ellen's
contributions, and our knowledge of the affair is
unfortunately one-sided, though to some extent we can
construct the complement.</p>

<p>At first Charlotte is evidently the predominant partner:
she exhorts, she encourages, she approves, she educates,
and the lover has something of the governess about her.
She discusses literary topics and assures Ellen that 'your
natural abilities are excellent, and under the direction of
a judicious and able friend, you might acquire a decided
taste for elegant literature and even poetry.' Then
there was some alarm about Ellen's health, and Charlotte,
in that laboured style that both she and Branwell considered
literary, hoped that</p>

<blockquote><p>your medical adviser is mistaken in supposing that you
have any tendency towards a pulmonary affection. Dear
Ellen, that would indeed be a calamity.... Guard against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the gloomy impression that such a state of mind naturally
produces.</p></blockquote>

<p>That alarm passed off, and when Charlotte was eighteen
Ellen went on a visit to London, and Charlotte's letters
unconsciously show not only what the friendship was
becoming to her, but give us, intimately and inevitably,
something of the ripening characteristics of her mind.
At first she was afraid that the distractions and gaiety of
'modern Babylon' would prove too potent a diversion
to Ellen, and take her mind away from her adorer, but
she found this was not so. Ellen remained not only her
friend, but her 'true friend.' Then in this letter follows
a passage in which devotion is strangely mingled with the
approbation of a governess who is satisfied with her
pupil.</p>

<blockquote><p>I am really grateful [she writes] for your mindfulness of so
obscure a person as myself, and I hope the pleasure is not
purely selfish, I trust it is partly derived from the consciousness
that my friend's character is of a higher and more
steadfast order than I was once perfectly aware of. Few girls
would have done as you have done&mdash;would have beheld the
glare and glitter and dazzling display of London with dispositions
so unchanged, hearts so uncontaminated. I see no
affectation in your letter, no trifling, no frivolous contempt
of pain, and weak admiration of showy persons and things....
Continue to spare a corner of your warm affectionate
heart for your true and grateful friend.</p></blockquote>

<p>But Ellen's mind, her intellectual advancement must
still be seen to, and when she wrote to Charlotte asking
her for a list of books to read, the instructress and
moralist is altogether in the ascendant, and 'the judicious
and able friend' recommends 'Milton, Shakespeare,
Thomson, Goldsmith, Scott, Byron, Campbell, Wordsworth
and Southey.'</p>

<blockquote><p>Now don't be startled [she writes] at the names of
Shakespeare and Byron. Both these were great men, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
works are like them. You know how to choose the good and
avoid the evil; the finest passages are always the purest, and
the bad are invariably revolting. Omit the comedies of
Shakespeare, and the <i>Don Juan</i>, perhaps the <i>Cain</i> of Byron
... read the rest fearlessly: that must indeed be a depraved
mind which can gather evil from <i>Henry VIII</i>, <i>Richard III</i>,
from <i>Macbeth</i>, and <i>Hamlet</i>, and <i>Julius Caesar</i>. In fiction read
Scott alone: all novels after his are worthless. For biography,
read Johnson's <i>Lives of the Poets</i>, Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i>,
Southey's <i>Life of Nelson</i>, etc., etc. For divinity your brother
Henry will advise you.</p></blockquote>

<p>This list is interesting, as showing how large a province
in Charlotte's mind was occupied by poetry; poetry to
her taste, though she was a most indifferent muse when
she turned her hand to it herself, was the highest form
of literary expression, to an appreciation of which, if
judiciously guided, Ellen might attain. The list appears
to have been enough to last her friend for her lifetime,
for literature is hardly mentioned again in these letters.
For a brief space before the Parliamentary election of
1835 Charlotte tried to kindle Ellen's interest in politics
with dithyrambic outbursts.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Election! The Election! [she writes] that cry has
rung even amongst our lonely hills like the blast of a trumpet.
How has it roused the populous neighbourhood of Birstall?
Under what banner have your brothers ranged themselves?
The Blue or the Yellow? Use your influence with them,
entreat them, if it be necessary, on your knees to stand by
their <i>country</i> and religion in this day of danger.</p></blockquote>

<p>But that passes too, and the personal relation, ripening
into passion, dethrones all other topics. So far from the
schoolgirl <i>schwärm</i> cooling down into the mere warmth
of friendship or the chill of indifference, it begins to
flame, reducing the governess and the politician to
ashes, and the growing human adoration feeds itself
with the fuel of religious aspirations.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>I am at this moment [wrote Charlotte, now in her twenty-first
year] trembling all over with excitement after reading
your note: it is what I never received before&mdash;it is the
unrestrained pouring out of a warm, gentle, generous heart,
it contains sentiments unrestrained by human motives,
prompted by the pure God himself, it expresses a noble
sympathy which I <i>do</i> not, <i>cannot</i> describe. Ellen, Religion has
indeed elevated your character. I <i>do</i> wish to be better than
I am, I pray fervently to be made so. I have stings of conscience&mdash;visitings
of remorse&mdash;glimpses of Holy, inexpressible
things, which formerly I used to be a stranger to.... This
very night I will pray as you wish me. May the Almighty
hear me compassionately! and I humbly trust He will&mdash;for
you will strengthen my polluted petition with your own pure
requests.... If you love me, <i>do</i>, <i>do</i> come on Friday.
I shall watch and wait for you, and if you disappoint me,
I shall weep....</p></blockquote>

<p>Again she writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>At such times in such moods as these, Ellen, it is my nature
to seek repose in some calm, tranquil idea, and I have now
summoned up your image to give me rest. There you sit,
upright and still in your black dress and white scarf, your
pale marble-like face, looking so serene and kind&mdash;just like
reality. I wish you would speak to me. It is from religion
you derive your chief charm, and may its influence always
preserve you as pure, as unassuming, and as benevolent in
thought and deed as you are now. What am I compared to
you? I feel my own utter worthlessness as I make the
comparison. I am a very coarse, commonplace wretch,
Ellen.... Give my love to both your sisters. The bonnet
is too handsome for me. I dare write no more.</p></blockquote>

<p>The flame of this furnace compounded of human
passion and the religious ecstasies and questionings which
it kindled, mounts higher and licks the skies. She writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>My Darling, if I were like you, I should have to face
Zionward, though prejudice and error might occasionally fling
a mist over the glorious vision before me ... but <i>I am not
like you</i>. If you knew my thoughts, the dreams that absorb
me, the fiery imagination that at times eats me up, and makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
me feel society as it is, wretchedly insipid, you would pity
and I daresay despise me. But I know the treasures of the
Bible, and love and adore them. I can see the Well of Life
in all its clearness and brightness, but when I stoop down to
drink of the pure waters they fly from my lips as if I were
Tantalus....</p></blockquote>

<p>Again she writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Ellen, I wish I could live with you always. I begin to
cling to you more fondly than ever I did. If we had but a
cottage and a competency of our own, I do think we might
live and love on till <i>Death</i> without being dependent on any
third person for happiness....</p></blockquote>

<p>Then there was a fear of Ellen leaving the neighbourhood
of the school where Charlotte was now a teacher, and,
crying out against this inscrutable fatality, she asks:</p>

<blockquote><p>Why are we to be divided? Surely, Ellen, it must be
because we are in danger of loving each other too well, of
losing sight of the <i>Creator</i> in idolatry of the <i>creature</i>. At
first I could not say 'Thy Will be done.' I felt rebellious,
but I knew it was wrong to feel so. Being left a moment
alone this morning, I prayed fervently to be enabled to resign
myself to <i>every</i> decree of God's Will, though it should be
dealt forth with a far severer hand than the present disappointment.</p></blockquote>

<p>This love of the creature obscuring the Creator is in
Charlotte's novels her strongest expression of human
love. Jane Eyre, for instance, speaks of Rochester in
precisely these terms: 'I could not in these days see
God for his creature of whom I had made an idol.' In
<i>Villete</i>, Lucy Snowe speaks of her love for Dr. John
in the same way. Then this temporary obstacle passes,
there is a plan of Ellen's coming to stay at Haworth, and
Charlotte writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>If I could always live with you, if your lips and mine could
at the same time drink the same draught at the same fountain
of mercy, I hope, I trust, I might one day become better, far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
better than my evil wandering thoughts, my corrupt heart,
cold to the spirit and warm to the flesh, will now permit me
to be.</p></blockquote>

<p>Her heart was a 'hot-bed for sinful thoughts,' but
Ellen's notes were 'meat and drink' to her. But she
was not good enough for Ellen. Ellen must be kept
'from the contamination of too intimate society.'</p>

<p>Now much comment has been expended on this
fervency of religious emotionalism, which has been represented
as a morbid but temporary hysterical affection:
biographers, Mrs. Gaskell among them, slightly bewildered
at it, have preferred largely to suppress it as
being a disturbing and inharmonious feature in their
preconceived portrait of Charlotte. Certainly nothing
can be more unlike any subsequent aspect of her religious
views than this Maenad mood; glaring, indeed, is the
contrast between this fervour of religion and the piety,
almost prim and proper (though heart-felt and sincere)
and void of all spark of excitement, which is so abundantly
in evidence in her other letters, while here she
is dancing like David before the Ark in girded ecstasy,
instead of worshipping God in a Sunday bonnet. But
it does not seem impossible to find a reconcilement
between the two, and the key to it, I think, is this.
Never again did she give her heart to anyone, man or
woman, in joy and exaltation, and it was her human
adoration for Ellen that kindled in her this religious
emotionalism. Ellen was at the bottom of it. It was
her desire to make herself worthy of her friend that
caused Charlotte to lament her own deficiencies in a
manner otherwise alien to her, and pray that they should
pass away from her; it was human love that inspired
those spiritual aspirations, and lit them with its own
passion for the perfect. They were in no sense whatever
trumped-up or insincere, they flowed out as spontaneously
as did the water when Moses struck the rock;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
but the source of them and their inspiration was Ellen.
Charlotte is even consciously aware of this, for in a later
letter she practically admits it, and puts her two passions
in their relatively correct places:</p>

<blockquote><p>In writing at this moment, [she says] I feel an intense disgust
at the idea of using a single phrase that sounds like religious
cant. I abhor myself, I despise myself, if the doctrine of
Calvin be true, I am already an outcast. You cannot imagine
how hard, rebellious and intractable all my feelings are.
When I begin to study on the subject, I almost grow blasphemous
and atheistical in my sentiments. Don't desert me,
don't be horrified at me, you know what I am. I wish I could
see you, my darling; I have lavished the very warmest
affection of a very hot tenacious heart upon you&mdash;if you grow
cold, it is over.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the light of such passages as these, it is impossible to
doubt the source of her outbreaks of religious fervour.
It was not primarily the Throne of Grace before which
she made her adoration but before Ellen&mdash;Ellen was
her Rock of Ages. Never again did she attain to such
soaring in her relations with any human being, for the
strong and most unhappy attachment to M. Héger, as
we shall see, so far from giving her that expansion of wing,
rendered her merely abject, and she besought him of his
clemency just to write her a few words, crumbs from
his table on which she could feed. Nor was there such
emotional fervour in her marriage, happy though its
briefness was, bringing her the content which she had
missed all her life, and drying up that well-spring of
bitterness in her temperament which had long caused
her to be incapable of enjoyment. Sexless though this
passion for Ellen was, it was inspired by the authentic
ecstasy of love.</p>

<p>For four years this intense attachment continued to
blaze, but in 1838, when Charlotte was twenty-two, there
comes just a hint of covert reproach, usual with the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
domineering and more dominant lover who finds the
adorable one too little responsive; for Ellen, though
devoted to Charlotte, kept her head, was calm and
sensible, and did not indulge in rhapsodies. Charlotte
at that time had gone back to Miss Wooler's school,
pupil no longer but a mistress. She became thoroughly
unhappy, left rather suddenly, and wrote from Haworth
to tell her friend why:</p>

<blockquote><p>I stayed as long as I was able, and at length I neither could
nor dared stay any longer. My health and spirits had utterly
failed me, and the medical man whom I consulted enjoined
me, if I valued my life, to go home.... A calm and even
mind like yours, Ellen, cannot conceive the feelings of the
shattered wretch who is now writing to you, when after
weeks of mental and bodily anguish, not to be described,
something like rest and tranquillity began to dawn again....
I fear from what you say that I cannot rationally entertain
hopes of seeing you before winter. For your own sake
I am glad of it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Next year, when Charlotte was close on twenty-three,
a surprising development occurred, and one quite unforeshadowed
in her correspondence. Henry Nussey,
Ellen's brother, an amiable and blameless young clergyman,
wrote her a letter proposing marriage. She refused
him, and wrote to tell Ellen, who was certainly
privy to her brother's intention, what she had done.
'There were,' she said, 'in this proposal some things
which might have proved a strong temptation. I
thought if I were to marry Henry Nussey, his sister could
live with me, and how happy I should be.' Propinquity
to a sister-in-law seems rather an unusual consideration
in favour of matrimony, and has probably never before,
or since, been so frankly acknowledged.</p>

<p>For more than seven years this eager devotion to her
friend, though expressed in less exuberant language,
continued without abatement, and Charlotte was unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
to see any speck in her perfection, except that of her
comparative irresponsiveness. Then, coincident with and
possibly in consequence of her wretched experience at
Brussels, where she fell in love with M. Héger, the flame
of it expired, and though to the end of her life the
friendship remained deep and stable, there was no more
excitement, religious or otherwise, in it, and she wrote to
Ellen, 'In the name of Common Sense, no more lovers'
quarrels!' She began to see flaws in the peerless
crystal; the governess rose ascendant over the lover,
and Charlotte warned her of the 'danger of continued
prosperity, which might develop too much a certain
germ of ambition latent in your character. I saw this
little germ putting out green shoots when I was staying
with you at Hathersage.' She warned her also against
vanity and the perishable nature of personal attractiveness,
when Ellen was pleased with a new white dress
which set off her comeliness. Then Miss Ringrose
became a fellow-worshipper at Ellen's shrine, and wrote
to Charlotte with enthusiastic admiration of their mutual
friend. Upon which Charlotte again felt it laid upon her
to be good for Ellen, and in her most emphatic governess
style told her that Miss Ringrose's feelings for her
were 'half truth, half illusion. No human being could
altogether be what she supposes you to be.' She also
said that the notion of her being jealous of the new
friend was altogether too ludicrous.</p>

<p>The splendours had faded, no longer did the bugle
blow a royal salute, she could dissect with a calm hand
what had dazzled her. 'Ellen,' she wrote, 'is a calm,
steady girl, not brilliant, but good and true. She suits
me and has always suited me well.' But now her defects
had hardened into qualities, and there was no longer
the slightest chance of Ellen's acquiring a taste for
poetry, 'for she is without romance. If she attempts to
read poetry or poetic prose aloud, I am irritated and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
deprive her of the book. If she talks of it, I stop my
ears: but she is good, she is true, she is faithful, and
I love her.'</p>

<p>The long-continued ardour of this attachment which,
when it cooled down, subsided into a firm and deep
friendship, is of great importance in arriving at any true
view of Charlotte's inner nature, especially when we consider
her often-expressed dislike of men as a sex. She
thought them coarse, selfish, and conceited. Charles
Lamb's devotion to his sister, for example, she pronounced
to be 'an instance of abnegation of self,
scarcely, I think, to be paralleled in the annals of the
coarser sex.' Women, she believed, were infinitely
finer, and it was a woman's portion to be married 'to a
mate who generically is inferior to herself in their [<i>sic</i>]
aim in making themselves agreeable.' She warned Ellen
against falling in love, and counselled her thus about
marriage:</p>

<blockquote><p>After that ceremony is over and after you have had some
months to settle down and to get accustomed to the creature
you have taken for your worse half, you will probably make
a most affectionate and happy wife.</p></blockquote>

<p>She was all for a woman leading her own life, violently
protesting against the idea that she was always on the
look out for a husband.</p>

<blockquote><p>I know [she wrote] that if women wish to escape the stigma
of husband-seeking, they must act and look like marble or
clay&mdash;cold, expressionless, bloodless, for every appearance of
feeling, of joy, sorrow, friendliness, antipathy, admiration,
disgust are all alike construed by the world into the attempt
to hook a husband. Never mind! Well-meaning women
have their own conscience to comfort them after all. Do not
therefore be too much afraid of showing yourself as you
are, affectionate, and good-hearted: do not too harshly
repress sentiment and feelings excellent in themselves, because
you fear that some puppy may fancy that you are letting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
them come out to fascinate him: do not condemn yourself
to live only by halves, because if you showed too much
animation some pragmatical thing in breeches might take it
into his pate to imagine that you designed to dedicate your
life to his inanity.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is a very robust contempt for men in general
in this spirited passage, and similar volleys of disdain are
exceedingly common in her letters. Psycho-analytical
commentators have interpreted this to mean that
Charlotte was the victim of sex-obsession, that she was
longing to get a husband, and, being unable to do
so, vented her spite against the sex in these diatribes.
But, while it is perfectly true that when she did marry
she found the happiness that she had missed all her life,
such a conclusion is altogether at variance with the facts.
For three other men, Henry Nussey being the first,
wanted to marry her and she refused them. It is more
reasonable, in view of this passionate affection of hers
for Ellen Nussey, to conclude that for a considerable
period of her life her emotional reactions were towards
women rather than men.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<p>Charlotte left Miss Wooler's when she was sixteen
and returned to Haworth, where she remained for the
next three years. She undertook the education of her
two sisters, and with her brother Branwell continued to
pour out that torrent of prose works with occasional
poems, which had been interrupted during her schooldays.
But now, as if the waters had been accumulating
in a reservoir, they flowed in absolutely unparalleled
volume. She wrote most of them under pseudonyms,
and we see that the Duke of Wellington was still her
demigod, for their authorship is chiefly attributed to
Lord Charles Albert Florian Wellesley, and that gifted
creature in 1833 alone wrote: <i>Arthuriana: or Odds and
Ends: Being a Miscellaneous Collection of Pieces in Prose
and Verse</i>; <i>The Secret and Lily Hart</i> (two tales); <i>Visits
in Verdopolis</i> (two volumes); <i>The Green Dwarf: A Tale
of the Perfect Tense</i>; and in 1834, <i>My Angria and the
Angrians</i>; <i>A Leaf from an Unopened Volume</i>; <i>Corner
Dishes: Being a Small Collection of Trifles in Prose and
Verse</i>; <i>High Life in Verdopolis</i>; and <i>The Spell, an Extravaganza</i>.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
In addition to these there is <i>The Foundling:
A Tale of our Own Times</i>, by Captain Tree (1833);
<i>Richard C&#339;ur de Lion and Blondel</i>, by Charlotte Brontë
(1833); and <i>The Scrap Book: A Mingling of Many Things</i>,
by Charlotte Brontë, and compiled by Lord C. A. F.
Wellesley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>Of this library of manuscript <i>The Spell</i> has been lately
published by the Oxford University Press. It is the first
tale in a very curious volume of Charlotte's manuscripts
in the British Museum, and with it are bound up <i>High
Life in Verdopolis</i>, mentioned above, and <i>The Scrap
Book</i>. The binding is French, the title on the cover
is <i>Manuscrits de Miss Charlotte Brontë</i> (<i>Currer Bell</i>), and
the book was purchased in the year 1892 in a second-hand
bookshop in Brussels. What the previous history
of it was is quite unknown. The suggestion has been
made that Charlotte, when at the <i>pensionnat</i> in Brussels,
gave these manuscripts to M. Héger, or left them behind
when she went back to England, and that he, when she
became famous, had them bound. There is no evidence
to support the theory, but it is certainly a reasonable
one.</p>

<p><i>The Spell</i>, therefore, is now accessible to readers,
and we have in it a solid sample of the Angrian-Saga
and of Charlotte's style in this year 1834, when she was
eighteen. The story is highly sensational, the plot
utterly mystifying, and the writing of the purplest. It
was worth printing as a curiosity, but solely because
it was Charlotte Brontë who wrote it. Intrinsic merit
cannot be claimed for it, nor is there in it any foreshadowing
of that supreme talent which was so soon to
develop in her. What is interesting is the devouring
rage for literary expression that consumed her, and the
enormous quantity of narrative which poured from her
rather than its quality.</p>

<p>Branwell in the same period, chiefly under the
pseudonym of Captain John Flower, M.P., or the Right
Honourable John Baron Flower, produced <i>Real Life
in Verdopolis</i>; <i>The Politics of Verdopolis</i>; <i>The Pirate</i>;
<i>Thermopylæ</i> (a poem); <i>And the Weary are at Rest</i>; <i>The
Wool is Rising</i>, an Angrian adventure; <i>Ode to the Pole
Star</i>, and other poems; and <i>The Life of Field-Marshal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the Right Honourable Alexander Percy, Earl of Northangerland</i>
(two volumes).</p>

<p>The brain reels with the thought of Charlotte's
activities during these years. She was giving lessons
to her younger sisters, she was teaching in the Sunday
school, she was entertaining district visitors to tea, she
was pouring out those oceans of literary work, she was
sewing for hours every day under the eye of Aunt
Branwell. When everything sewable for the use of
the Parsonage and its inmates had been sewed, the
industry of her nieces was devoted to sewings for
the needy of the parish, and from after the midday
dinner at half-past one till tea-time all needles were busy.
Sewing, according to that admirable letter-writer, Miss
Mary Taylor, who came to stay at Haworth during
those years, was, in Aunt Branwell's opinion, good for
the sewers as well as the sewed for; it was an essential
part of woman's work in the world, and she presided at
these gatherings in her large mob cap of the period with
auburn curls attached to it, and took her snuff, and
anticipating the refinements of America she would not
allow the word 'spit' to be used in her presence. When
tea came in, sewing was finished for the day, and after
Mr. Brontë had read prayers to the household at eight,
she went up to her bedroom in her pattens and was seen
no more till breakfast-time next morning. An hour later
Mr. Brontë retired for the night, winding the clock on
the stairs as he passed, and called out, 'Don't sit up
late, girls!' And then the real day, the living exciting
part of the day began, and Lord Charles Albert Florian
Wellesley was free, for till then there had not been a
moment's leisure, and he wrote like mad.</p>

<p>Somehow or other there was squeezed in the time for
drawing lessons, and the time for sketching and painting
between the visits of Mr. William Robinson of Leeds,
a pupil of Sir Thomas Lawrence and of the delirious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Swiss artist Fuseli, who painted nightmares with so sure
a hand. The whole family had lessons at the inclusive
fee of two guineas a visit, and it is legitimate to trace,
in the account of the pictures which Jane Eyre showed
Mr. Rochester, some influence of the pupil of Fuseli.
These, it may be remembered, comprised one of a cormorant
sitting on the mast of a ship sunk in a rough
sea and holding a bracelet in its beak, which it had
taken from the arm of a drowned corpse that was visible
through the water. But Mr. William Robinson's
morals, whatever his skill as an artist, were not all
they should be. Mrs. Gaskell alludes with such discretion
to some indiscretion on Mr. Robinson's part
which caused Mr. Brontë to decide that he should
teach his daughters no longer, that even the hardiest
biographers have not ventured to tell us what it was.</p>

</div>

<p>As the result of this tuition and the artistic promise
shown by Branwell at the age of eighteen, it was decided
that he should adopt art as his career, and go up to
London in order to study at the Art Schools of
the Royal Academy. There is no evidence to show
that he ever went, though he wrote to the Secretary
asking particulars about admission, and it is probable
that the idea was abandoned. He then tried to turn
to account his literary gifts, and wrote some truly
amazing letters to the editor of <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>,
and, somewhat in the style of Mr. Micawber, told him
that he was ready to write for him, and positively
challenged him to take him as a regular contributor
either in prose or verse, enclosing a specimen poem and
promising to send prose if desired, on any subject that
Mr. Robert Blackwood might select. He enjoined him
not to condemn him unheard; he cautioned him not to
behave like a commonplace person and miss such an
opportunity; he reminded him that 'you have lost an
able writer in James Hogg, and God grant you may get
one in Patrick Branwell Brontë.' But Mr. Blackwood
preferred to be commonplace, though Branwell gave
him four opportunities of showing a finer quality.
Somewhere about this time he painted a portrait group
of his three sisters, which Mrs. Gaskell saw when she
stayed with Charlotte at Haworth: Emily and Anne
were linked together; Charlotte stood apart on the
right side of a column which nearly bisects the picture.
Mrs. Gaskell's verdict on it was that though it possessed
little artistic merit, the portrait of Charlotte was strikingly
like her, and that it was reasonable to suppose that
those of the other two sisters were equally faithful.
Her description of this picture answers so closely to
the picture by Branwell now in the National Gallery,
that it is difficult to suppose that it was not this which
she saw. On the other hand, Mr. Shorter tells us that
after Mr. Brontë's death in 1861, Mr. Nicholls took this
picture to Ireland with him, and destroyed it, keeping
only the figure of Emily, which he considered to be like
her.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> This also is now in the National Portrait Gallery,
but there is a question whether it does not represent
Anne. The only explanation of the confusion seems to
be that Branwell painted two portrait groups of his
sisters, of which Mr. Nicholls destroyed one.</p>

<p>In these three years between Charlotte's leaving Miss
Wooler's school and returning there again as teacher,
we still lack any glimpse beyond the most misty of
Emily. In person she was taller than the others, she
had beauty of feature, and Ellen Nussey, on her visits
to the Parsonage, was evidently very much struck with
her. But she describes her in a way that does not much
help us to realise her, for though she was keenly aware
that 'there was depth and power in her nature,' that
'one of her rare expressive looks was something to
remember through life,' such observations however
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a><br><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>appreciative are mere generalities, and we still have to
imagine Emily for ourselves, and clearly what impressed
Ellen most was Emily's impenetrable reserve. But it
is something to be told that when she was out on the
moors she was a different person, brimful of glee and
the joy of life, absorbed in the affairs of tadpoles in a
pool; that she could poke fun at Charlotte, who was
terrified of cows, by luring her into a field where those
fierce animals were grazing. Ellen also tells us that
Anne was her inseparable companion, and that her
piano-playing was really remarkable. Instructive too
is the story that one day when Charlotte was unwell,
Emily was sent out a walk with Ellen. This was a
hazardous experiment, for Emily was capable of remaining
completely silent for indefinite periods, and so on
their return Charlotte naturally asked how her sister
had behaved. This casual question has been taken up,
like a challenge, by one accomplished Emily-ite, who
triumphantly assures us that Emily had behaved well;
'she had shown her true self, her noble energetic truthful
soul.' But Charlotte only wanted to know if Emily
had spoken at all during the walk, and whether she had
is not recorded. Anne finally remains mysterious, not
because she was enigmatical, but because her only characteristics
were gentleness and piety, and from the
dim, cool shade of these excellences she never really
emerges.</p>

<p>It is now that a side of Charlotte, ever afterwards
characteristic of her, definitely shows itself, and she
begins to take command of the family ship and its
destinies, to set its sails and to direct its course.
Mr. Brontë's income was £200 a year, Aunt Branwell
had £50 a year, and it was evident to Charlotte's intensely
practical mind that she and her sisters must do something
to earn money. Branwell, in this year 1835,
according to plan, was to become a pupil at the Academy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Art Schools in London, and would be an additional
drain on the family finances, and she must make her
living, or, at any rate, not be an expense. Teaching
offered the best if not the only opening, and for the next
nine years she devoted her energies towards making a
career for herself and her sisters in this direction, with
the idea of eventually setting up a school for girls.
Experience was the first thing needed, and now at the
age of nineteen she became a teacher at Miss Wooler's
school where, three years before, she had been a pupil.
She had already received two offers for a post as private
governess in a family, but she naturally preferred to go
to Miss Wooler, who was already a friend; besides,
Mary Taylor and Ellen Nussey, with whom the passionate
friendship was now at its height, both lived within
a few miles of Roe Head. Then there were Emily and
Anne to be thought of, for she was acting for them too,
and with a view to fitting Emily for the same profession
as herself, she arranged that she should accompany her
to Roe Head as a pupil and complete her education.
Anne at present was only fifteen, and she would
continue her studies at home; her turn would come
later.</p>

<p>Charlotte looked forward to the adventure. 'My
lines,' she wrote to her friend, 'are fallen in pleasant
places,' and it was a consolation to her and Emily that
they would be together. So in July the two sisters,
teacher and pupil, went to Miss Wooler's, but Anne's
turn came sooner than anyone had expected. Emily,
unconsoled, pined for Haworth and the moors; she
became ill from home-sickness, and Charlotte believed
that her life was in danger. In a memoir she wrote
after Emily's death, for a selection of her poems, she
says:</p>

<blockquote><p>I felt in my heart she would die, if she did not go home,
and with this conviction obtained her recall. She had only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
been three months at school, and it was some years before the
experiment of sending her from home was again ventured on.</p></blockquote>

<p>This memoir contains several curious errors in actual
fact. Charlotte states in it that Emily was in her sixteenth
year when she went to Roe Head: she was really
in her eighteenth year. Odder is the inaccuracy that
Emily, so acute was her nostalgia, causing great emaciation
and even danger to life, never left Haworth again
for some years: the experiment was too risky. For,
as a matter of fact, within a year from the time that
Charlotte 'obtained her recall,' Emily, with no kind
Miss Wooler in charge and no sister to remind her of
home, was a teacher in Miss Patchett's school at Law
Hill, Southorran, near Halifax. Emily's life there,
Charlotte told Ellen, was an intolerable slavery&mdash;she was
at work from six in the morning till eleven at night; and
yet in the memoir quoted above, Charlotte seems to
have forgotten that Emily had left Haworth again till
after some years had passed, or, in other words, till she
took her to Brussels, as the same memoir states. Directly
on Emily's recall from Roe Head, Anne was sent for to
take her place as pupil in Miss Wooler's school, and
there she remained, completing her education, for two
years.</p>

<p>The scheme of sending Branwell to study at the Art
Schools of the Royal Academy in London had been
given up, and though getting on for twenty years old,
he was still at home, keen, apparently, on his painting
and a good scholar in Latin, but with no settled occupation
of any sort. Mrs. Gaskell tells us that, at this time,
'the young man seemed to have his fate in his own
hands. He was full of noble impulses as well as extraordinary
gifts.' As an instance of his literary ability,
she speaks of a fragment of his prose which she had
seen. 'The actors in it are drawn with much of the
grace of characteristic portrait-painting in perfectly pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and simple language which distinguishes so many of
Addison's papers in the <i>Spectator</i>.' This is high praise
as coming from one of so delicate a literary judgment,
and must be received with all respect. He had charm,
it would appear, ability and ambition, but he was without
ballast and lacked the discipline through which alone
ambition can be fulfilled. He was still considered the
genius of the family&mdash;he had wit, a brilliant tongue and
the vanity to demand an audience; and it is hardly to be
wondered at that on long winter evenings, with Aunt
Branwell immured in her bedroom, and his father in
his study, with Charlotte and Anne away, with Emily
silent as the grave, he sought the more congenial atmosphere
of the bar at the 'Black Bull,' where he would
find talk and laughter and an atmosphere of good fellowship.
Sometimes a commercial traveller or such would
be putting up there for the night, and the landlord told
him of this brilliant young fellow at the Parsonage
near by, who would certainly come down and have
a chat with him over a glass or two of whisky-toddy
to pass the hour before bedtime. So Branwell
appeared, and perhaps he exhibited for the general
astonishment a remarkable faculty he had of writing
simultaneously with his right hand and his left two
different letters. At other times there would be farmers
from the country round dropping in on market-day
before they set off again across the hills to scattered
homesteads, and there was just such talk and companionship
as must have been Branwell's father's before he
left County Down for Cambridge.</p>

<p>Then, again, the 'Black Bull' was the headquarters
of a village club, 'The Lodge of the Three Graces,'
faintly masonic in title, of which John Brown, the sexton
of the church, at whose house in later days lodged more
than one curate of Haworth, was Master, and Branwell
was Secretary. What the official proceedings were or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
what sort of entries the Secretary made in the book of
minutes, we have no idea, but, as we shall find excellent
reason to believe, the proceedings were punctuated with
bawdy talk and whisky-toddy. Considering what the
mode of life was at the Parsonage, it is really little
wonder that a young man, eminently 'clubbable,' fond
of talk and talking with extreme brilliance, should have
frequented the 'Black Bull.'</p>

<p>In the holidays they were again all together, and
though teaching was the destiny that Charlotte was
weaving for herself and her sisters, literary ambitions,
now taking second place, were not entirely extinguished.
Poetry was ascendant over prose, and in
the Christmas holidays of 1836-1837 she wrote, in that
microscopic hand, twenty-six pages of verse. She
finished one of these poems, <i>We Wove a Web in
Childhood</i>, on December 19, and then conceived the
daring project of writing to Robert Southey, the Poet
Laureate, enclosing a specimen of her own verse (probably
this), and asking him for his opinion on it. We
may guess that this was a concerted plan between her
and Branwell to interest the eminent in their compositions,
for Branwell gave the editor of <i>Blackwood's
Magazine</i> another chance, telling him that he had written
a very lengthy and remarkable composition in prose
which he was ready to bring up to Edinburgh to show
him. He rated him for his silence, asking if it were
prejudice which actuated it, and bidding him be a man,
sir! He wrote also to William Wordsworth, who succeeded
Southey in the Laureateship, enclosing, like
Charlotte, a poem of his, which he described as the</p>

<blockquote><p>Prefatory Scene of a much longer subject, in which I have
striven to develop strong passions and weak principles
struggling with a high imagination and acute feelings, till,
as youth hardens towards age, evil deeds and short enjoyments
end in mental misery and bodily ruin....</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>This is interesting, for the poor wretch was even now
playing in his own person the prefatory scene of just
such a tragic career.</p>

<p>Wordsworth appears not to have answered this letter,
though he kept it, but eventually there came to Charlotte,
long after she had gone back to Miss Wooler's after the
Christmas holidays, a reply from the Laureate. It was
a kind, a long and a careful letter, but it was very far
from being encouraging. He told her she had the
faculty of verse, but reminded her that this was no rare
gift: he felt bound when any young aspirant asked him
for his advice about adopting literature as a profession,
to caution him 'against taking so perilous a course.'
Then came passages which surely laid an icy finger on
her enthusiasm.</p>

<blockquote><p>The day-dreams in which you habitually indulge are likely
to induce a distempered state of mind.... Literature cannot
be the business for a woman's life, and it ought not to be.
The more she is engaged in her proper duties, the less
leisure she will have for it, even as an accomplishment and a
recreation.... However ill what has been said may accord
with your present views and temper, the longer you live the
more reasonable it will appear to you....</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter was, in fact, quite as discouraging as Wordsworth's
silence to Branwell, and its discouragement was,
for the present, effective. Charlotte wrote back saying,
'I trust I shall never more feel ambitious to see my name
in print: if the wish should rise, I'll look at Southey's
letter and suppress it.' She put away all literary
ambition, and devoted her energies to the task of gaining
such experience in teaching for herself and her sisters
as should qualify them for the educational career which
she had chosen for them all.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Southey lived long enough to see <i>Jane Eyre</i> take
the world by storm and to know (if such information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
ever reached him) that the author of that book and of
<i>Shirley</i> was the young lady to whom he had written
that literature neither could nor ought to be the business
of a woman's life. But it must be remembered that
Charlotte had sent to him (as had Branwell to Wordsworth)
a specimen of her poetry, and, from what we
know of it, he was as certainly right to discourage her
muse as was Wordsworth in finding nothing to say to
Branwell, for neither of them had any real gift for
poetry at all. But it was perhaps odd that neither he nor
Wordsworth perceived of what admirable prose (though
that was not submitted to their judgment) their correspondents
were capable. Both of them, when they
were not being literary, wrote fine and apt English,
rhythmical and dignified, with that indefinable verbal
inevitability which is the hall-mark of the writer.
Here, for instance, is a paragraph from Branwell's letter
to Wordsworth:</p>

<blockquote><p>Do pardon me, sir, that I have ventured to come before
one whose work I have most loved in our literature, and
who most has been with me a divinity of the mind, laying
before him one of my writings, and asking of him a judgment
of its contents. I must come before someone from whose
sentence there is no appeal, and such a one is he who has
developed the theory of poetry as well as its practice, and
both in such a way as to claim a place in the memory of a
thousand years to come.</p></blockquote>

<p>Any boy who at the age of nineteen could write that,
had already a good command of his material; equally
excellent, though by no means superior, and with a
curious resemblance in rhythm and construction is the
following from Charlotte's letter to Southey. Her grip
on words was already firm, and, when she was not
trying to be literary or to write poetry, she had nothing
to learn.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>At the first perusal of your letter I felt only shame and
regret that I had ever ventured to trouble you with my crude
rhapsody: I felt a painful heat rise to my face when I thought
of the quires of paper I had covered with what once gave me
so much delight, but which now was only a source of confusion;
but after I had thought a little and read it again and
again the prospect seemed to clear.</p></blockquote>

<p>But the oracle had spoken, and in obedience to it she
entirely dismissed her dreams of Parnassus, and continued
at Dewsbury Moor, where Miss Wooler had
moved her school from Roe Head. Emily had spent
six months as a teacher in Miss Patchett's school near
Halifax, pursuing the same object, but her health had
broken down and she had returned to Haworth and its
moors and its liberties, away from which she seemed
to lose all health and happiness. Anne was still with
Charlotte as a pupil at Miss Wooler's, but just before
the Christmas holidays of 1837 she began to suffer from
coughs and pains which put Charlotte in mind of the
illness of her two elder sisters at Cowan Bridge, and she
thought these were symptoms of consumption. All
allowance must be made for her, for she was overwrought
and hysterical, and in a panic she went to
Miss Wooler and, in what must have been a horrid
scene, flew, as she confessed, 'into a regular passion,'
which she considered perfectly justified, and told her
that Anne was extremely ill and that Miss Wooler was
quite indifferent to the danger. Miss Wooler was very
much hurt at this monstrous accusation and wrote to
Mr. Brontë, who, though he realised that Charlotte had
been unreasonable, settled that they should both leave
Dewsbury Moor and come home.</p>

<p>Miss Wooler, who had always shown the most
motherly kindness and consideration to Charlotte, had
a tearful scene of reconciliation with her before they
went. Charlotte wrote to Ellen pouring scorn on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
poor lady's tears, but allowing that 'in spite of her cold
repulsive manners she had a considerable regard for
me.' She seems not to have realised that before. She
went back after the Christmas holidays for another term
at Miss Wooler's, Anne and Emily and Branwell all
remaining at home; but now she had a nervous breakdown,
and returned in the early summer of 1838 to
Haworth, where the whole family remained for a year.
All her plans and ambitions for herself and her sisters
had come to nothing as yet. Emily first, then Anne,
and finally she herself had been obliged, for reasons of
health, to give up the education and the experience in
teaching which she had arranged with a view to their
career: the oracles had been dumb or deeply discouraging
when consulted about her poems and Branwell's,
and there was nothing whatever ahead. Never
throughout her life was she optimistic; she expected
little, as she told Mrs. Gaskell in after years, and was
always prepared for disappointment, but no amount of
disappointment, however embittering, caused her to
relax her efforts in securing anything on which she
had set her heart and which she believed was within
attainment.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1839 Branwell, in pursuance of Art,
left Haworth and the conviviality of the 'Lodge of the
Three Graces' and took a studio at Bradford. His
departure is perhaps commemorated in Emily's poem
<i>Absence</i>, dated April 19, 1839.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One is absent, and for one</span>
<span class="i0">Cheerless, chill is our hearthstone;</span>
<span class="i0">One is absent, and for him</span>
<span class="i0">Cheeks are pale and eyes are dim.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is usually stated that this refers to Anne, who had
just gone out as governess to Mrs. Ingham: the gender
of the pronoun, however, is hard to explain. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Bradford he painted a few portraits, but seems to have
spent most of his time in the society of local artists and
at the bars of hotels, and after a few months his father
stopped supplies, and recalled him to Haworth. Much
has been made of this incident: vivid embroideries
have been stitched over it, and we learn from the Brontë-Saga
that 'he disappeared from Bradford heavily in
debt and was lost to sight until, unnerved, a drunkard
and an opium eater, he came back home.'<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> This lurid
picture, however, has no shadow of foundation in fact.
He never disappeared at all, except for those hours in
which he was travelling back from Bradford to Haworth,
nor is there any reason for supposing that he was in
debt or that he had yet taken to opium.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In March of the same spring Henry Nussey, as we
have already seen, proposed to Charlotte. He was now
a curate at Donnington in Sussex, and wrote her a very
businesslike letter, saying that after Easter he intended
to take pupils into his house, and intimated (as Charlotte
told his sister)</p>

<blockquote><p>that in due time he should want a wife to take care of his
pupils, and frankly me to be that wife. Altogether the
letter is written without cant or flattery, and in a common-sense
style which does credit to his judgment.</p></blockquote>

<p>Charlotte refused this proposal, though the prospect
of having Ellen to live with her was a strong temptation
to accept it, on the very sensible grounds that she did
not love him, and her letter to him, giving 'a decided
negative,' was equally free from cant and flattery and
might have been written not by the girl he wanted to
marry but by a sententious aunt.</p>

<blockquote><p>In forming this decision [she told him] I trust I have
listened to the dictates of conscience more than those of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>inclination. I have no personal repugnance to the idea of a
union with you, but I feel convinced that mine is not the
sort of disposition calculated to form the happiness of a
man like you. It has always been my habit to study the
character of those among whom I chance to be thrown, and
I think I know yours and can imagine what description of
woman would suit you for a wife. The character should
not be too marked, ardent, and original, her temper should
be mild, her piety undoubted, her spirits even and cheerful,
and her <i>personal attractions</i> sufficient to please your eyes and
gratify your just pride.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This letter irresistibly reminds us of Jane Austen at
her very best, and it is indeed no wonder that Charlotte
in later years was so entirely incapable of appreciating
her art, when we find her writing in all seriousness
passages that could be cited as admirable examples of
Jane Austen's humour. Henry Nussey, we may guess,
was no more in love with Charlotte than she with him,
for little more than six months elapsed before he wrote
to tell her that he had secured another young lady to
look after the pupils at Donnington, and again she
replied with just such edifying sentiments as Jane Austen
gives to Mr. Collins when he retails the counsels of
Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the subject of matrimony.
In her letter of congratulation she said:</p>

<blockquote><p>The step no doubt will by many of your friends be considered
scarcely as a prudent one, <i>since</i> fortune is not amongst the
number of the young lady's advantages. For my own part
I must confess that I esteem you the more for not hunting
after wealth, if there be strength of mind, firmness of principle
and sweetness of temper to compensate for the absence
of that usually all powerful attraction.... The bread earned
by honourable toil is sweeter than the bread of idleness, and
mutual love and domestic calm are treasures far preferable
to the possessions rust can corrupt and moths consume
away.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>She continued to encourage and advise him, and
wrote again to her ex-suitor shortly before his marriage:</p>

<blockquote><p>From what you say of your future partner I doubt not she
will be one who will help you to get cheerfully through the
difficulties of this world and to obtain a permanent rest in the
next; at least I hope such may be the case. You do right
to conduct the matter with due deliberation, for on the step
you are about to take depends the happiness of your whole
lifetime.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Charlotte, when she thus refused matrimony as her
destiny, had been three-quarters of a year at Haworth,
and during this period she seems to have written nothing
whatever: Southey's discouragement was evidently
potent with her. But Emily all the time was at work,
secretly and constantly, on her poems, and Charlotte
knew nothing of them. Many of them were concerned
with the Gondals, and possibly therefore Anne, but
Anne alone, was privy to them. But Emily did not
confide them to her elder sister, for when, six years
later, Charlotte 'discovered them,' as she tells us in
her memoir of her two sisters after their death, she says
that she was aware, but no more, that Emily did write
poetry, but up to that time she had seen none of it.
Earlier, as she tells us, they used to talk to each other
about what they were writing, but that habit must
already have ceased, since the discovery of Emily's
poems gave her her first sight of them. This is rather
important, for it goes against the assertion, constantly
made by Mrs. Gaskell, that there existed between Emily
and Charlotte a deep and intense intimacy. There is
no evidence for this. The evidence, in fact, which
becomes cumulative, goes to show that Emily and
Charlotte were never intimate in any real sense, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>first glimpse we get of that is that during this year at
Haworth, while the sisters were together and Emily wrote
a considerable number of poems, Charlotte knew nothing
of them.</p>

<p>Anne meantime had regained such measure of strength
as was ever hers, and in April 1839 she went forth from
Haworth again, and for five out of the next six years was
a governess. She went first to the family of Mrs. Ingham
at Blake Hall where, as Charlotte wrote to Ellen, she
was very kindly treated; she added, humorously no
doubt, but rather acidly, that owing to Anne's habit
of silence she 'seriously apprehends that Mrs. Ingham
will sometime conclude that she has a natural impediment
of speech.' A month or so later Charlotte obtained
a similar situation herself and went as governess to
the children of Mrs. John Benson Sidgwick at Stonegappe,
a few miles out of Skipton.</p>

<p>Less fortunate than Anne, she appears from her letters
to have fallen among fiends. The place, she wrote
to Emily, was beautiful, and she tried hard to be
happy, but her life was an intolerable slavery. The
children were 'the most riotous, perverse, unmanageable
cubs ever born,' and she refers to them as 'little devils
incarnate.' Mrs. Sidgwick did not know her, and did
not want to know her. Her manners were</p>

<blockquote><p>fussily affable, she talks a great deal but little to the
purpose.... She cares nothing in the world about me
except to contrive how the greatest possible quantity of
labour may be squeezed out of me, and to that end she overwhelms
me with oceans of needlework.... I see now more
clearly than I have ever done before that a private governess
has no existence, is not considered as a living and rational
being except as connected with the wearisome duties she has
to fulfil.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Sidgwick was not such a brute as his wife, 'he has
less bustling condescension but a far kinder heart....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
He never asks me to wipe the children's smutty noses
or tie their shoes or fetch their pinafores or get them a
chair.' The only pleasant afternoon that she spent at
Stonegappe was when he walked with his children and
his dog, and Charlotte had orders to 'follow a little
behind.' She tells Emily not to show this depiction
of hell to her aunt or her father, or they would think
'I am never satisfied wherever I am.' This caution is
significant.</p>

<p>After a few weeks the whole family went to stay at
Swarcliffe, near Harrogate, a country house belonging
to Mrs. Sidgwick's father, and, she writes to Ellen, life
was more miserable than ever. Mr. Greenwood had
filled his house with guests, who were gay and enjoyed
themselves; there was a large family party, 'proud as
peacocks and wealthy as jews,' and all the time, as
Charlotte bitterly complains, she had a set of 'pampered,
spoilt, and turbulent children' to look after. She was
in agonies of shyness and in the depth of depression,
and to crown all, Mrs. Sidgwick took her to task for her
glum demeanour, and she broke down and cried. Then
she pulled herself together and reflected that 'Adversity
is a good school&mdash;the Poor are born to labour, and the
Dependent to endure.' She recollected the fable of the
Willow and the Oak, and bent to the storm. Mrs.
Sidgwick, she allowed, was generally considered an
agreeable woman, 'But, oh, Ellen, does this compensate
for the absence of every fine feeling, of every gentle and
delicate sentiment?'<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Now it wrings the heart to picture the woe and the
wretchedness of this extremely sensitive, self-conscious
girl, whose shyness was such an obsession to her that
throughout her life the presence of a stranger would
plunge her into gulfs of silent misery, and it warms the
heart to think of her indomitable courage in going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>forth not once only but again and again to take situations
which necessarily threw her among strangers, for
the sake of contributing to the family finances, and
advancing the ambitions which she had determined to
accomplish for herself and her sisters. This iron willpower
scorned the miseries which were incidental to
the working out of its purpose, and though she bitterly
complained, and increasingly formed the most censorious
conclusions about those who unwittingly incurred them,
she never allowed her unhappiness to deter her. Further
instances of these characteristic traits in her character,
admirable and regrettable, emerge later. But together
with her memories of Stonegappe and Swarcliffe she
brought away some valuable material for the ruthless
caricaturing in <i>Jane Eyre</i> of the guests, whose callous
gaiety was etching itself in the mind of the silent little
governess, and was to be reproduced with ridicule that
was indeed ridiculous, in the figures of the smart party,
'Baroness Ingram of Ingram Hall' and the rest, who
swept about Mr. Rochester's house, and told the footman
'to cease thy chatter, blockhead,' and took no
notice of Jane Eyre.</p>

<p>This wretched experience lasted but for three months,
and once more, exhausted and nerve-racked, she returned
in July 1839 to Haworth. Here she recovered her
spirits and her speech: she was not shy at home, she
talked with ease among familiar faces, and within a
week or two of her return she received her second proposal
of marriage, again from a clerical admirer. There
came to spend the day a former curate of Mr. Brontë's,
now a vicar. With him Mr. Hodgson brought his own
curate, Mr. Bryce, who had lately left Dublin University.
Mr. Bryce, Charlotte wrote to Ellen, was a witty, lively
young man, lacking in discretion and dignity, but though
she saw his faults, she was amused at his originality,
and laughed at his jests. Before the evening was over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
his 'Hibernian flattery' caused her to cool towards him,
and off the visitors went having left a pleasant though
no permanent impression. A few days afterwards,
Charlotte, to her amazement and amusement, received
a proposal of marriage from young Mr. Bryce, ardently
professing his attachment. Another decided refusal
followed. Six months later Mr. Bryce died suddenly,
and Charlotte confesses that when she heard of it she
felt both shocked and saddened; 'it was no shame to
feel so, was it?'</p>

<p>Charlotte remained at Haworth, after leaving Mrs.
Sidgwick's house of bondage, for nearly two years before
she took another situation as governess, and her letters
of the period, sometimes pungent and censorious, sometimes
elderly and hortatory, sometimes childlike and
brimming with eager enthusiasm and sly ironies, paint
her own portrait with a vividness and a fidelity that no
biographer can hope to rival, and one is tempted to
believe that had she never written anything whatever
except letters, she would have won through them a niche
in English literature at least as permanent as Horace
Walpole's. She infuses her subject, whatever it is,
with the intense interest which it had for her, and
at the same time enthralls us with a study of herself.
We read, for instance, how she and Ellen had made a
plan to go together to the seaside. Miss Branwell
and Mr. Brontë had given 'a reluctant assent,' and
Charlotte's box was packed. Then there was a difficulty
about her conveyance, for Haworth's only gig was at
Harrogate, and likely to remain there. Mr. Brontë
objected to Charlotte's going by coach, and Miss Branwell
changed her reluctant assent to the whole scheme
for 'decided disapproval,' and the visit was abandoned.
But then Ellen descended on Haworth with a carriage
lent her for the occasion, and like Perseus, rescued
Andromeda. Charlotte wept with emotion when, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
for the first time, she saw the sea, and they had a marvellous
holiday together. She left her spectacles behind,
and on her return to Haworth could neither read, write,
nor draw with any comfort, but hoped that the landlady
of their lodgings would not refuse to give them
up. Another pair of spectacles, apparently, was not to
be thought of. Trivial as all this is, the intensity of
the experience to her renders it enthralling, and it is
because it is about a young lady of twenty-three who
lived in a remote parsonage, and tells us with inimitable
vividness about herself, and not in the least because
that young lady a few years afterwards wrote <i>Jane
Eyre</i>, that we are absorbed in what she has to say.
Almost next day she wrote to Henry Nussey, in a letter
already quoted, as if she was his guardian aunt, commending
him for not seeking a wealthy wife; but we
find these edifications, which show the serious side of
her character, hardly more informative than the news
that Tabby had become so lame that she left the Parsonage
and had gone to live with her sister.</p>

<blockquote><p>In the meantime Emily and I [she writes] are sufficiently
busy as you may suppose: I manage the ironing and keep the
rooms clean, Emily does the baking and attends to the kitchen.
We are such odd animals that we prefer this mode of contrivance
to having a new face amongst us.... Human feelings
are queer things. I am much happier black-leading the
stoves, making the beds, and sweeping the floor at home than
I should be living like a fine lady anywhere else.</p></blockquote>

<p>In leisure from housework she wrote, over the signature
of Charles Townsend, a story in three books
called <i>Caroline Vernon</i>, and another story, unnamed,
with the same signature. Southey's discouragement of
poetry apparently still was potent, but the instinct for
composition of some sort was irresistible.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<p>In the familiar surroundings of home, with no strange
faces to reduce her to silence and aloof discomfort, and
no immediate prospect of going out again on educational
exiles, Charlotte blossomed into a gaiety and sense of
fun that never again revisited her, and we rapturously
read in her letters the account of the loves of the
Reverend William Weightman, Mr. Brontë's curate.
Certainly there enters into it a very decent allowance of
acidity and of ridicule, but it is mixed with kindliness
and genuine laughter. It was not long before curates&mdash;the
genus 'Curate'&mdash;became to her a target for
peculiarly malicious arrows. She could see no good
in them; 'they were a self-seeking, vain, empty race,'
and in <i>Shirley</i> she made them the butt of immortal
and libellous satire, designed to give pain. Later yet,
by a providential irony of kindlier humour than hers,
it was with one of Mr. Brontë's curates of whom she
had hitherto entertained the gloomiest opinions, that
she found, in marriage, the few months of real happiness
which she had missed all her life.</p>

<p>At present the Rev. William Weightman concerns
us. He was a graduate of Durham University, he was
gay and handsome and an incorrigible flirt; his brief
history must be detached from the main narrative.
Charlotte's letters are full of him: she dubbed him,
owing to an effeminacy of manner and appearance, Miss
Celia Amelia, and all the young ladies of the neigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>bourhood
were the objects of his passion and fell victims
to his invincible charms. There was Sarah Sugden,
there was Caroline Dury, and there was Agnes Walton,
of whom Charlotte painted a portrait to remind him of
this charmer. 'You would laugh to see,' she wrote to
Ellen, 'how his eyes sparkle with delight when he looks
at it, like a pretty child pleased with a new plaything.'
She painted his portrait as well, and there were very
many sittings required for this. Too many, thought
Ellen, and she warned Charlotte that she was falling in
love with Celia Amelia; in turn Charlotte warned Ellen
that she was doing precisely the same, and she must
not lose her heart to him, for he made eyes at every
girl he saw. Even when he was performing his sacred
ministries he could not take his mind off them, and he
sat opposite Anne in church, 'sighing softly and looking
out of the corner of his eyes to win her attention!'
He introduced unusual gaieties to the Parsonage; he
found that none of the three girls had ever received a
Valentine, so he sent them each one with an accompaniment
of amorous verses, walking ten miles to post them,
so that Aunt Branwell should not suspect him of this
light conduct. He gave a lecture on some classical
subject at Keighley, and insisted that the three sisters
should come to hear it: they did not get back to the
Parsonage till midnight, and Aunt Branwell, who had
prepared coffee for the girls only, found that more was
required for Celia Amelia and his chaperoning friend,
and lost her temper. This lecture was printed in a local
paper, and Celia Amelia sent a copy of it to Ellen, with
a couple of ducks. Badinage abounded, and again and
again Charlotte counselled Ellen not to lose her heart to
the all-conquering curate, who thought her a fine-looking
girl, for he was fickle as the wind. He had an <i>inamorata</i>
at Swansea, but he quarrelled with her and sent her back
all her letters, while the more fortunate Caroline Dury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
received 'a most passionate copy of verses.' He went
to Ripon to pass his examination for priest's orders,
and enjoyed the balls there immensely and twice more
fell desperately in love. There were games at the
Parsonage now, drawing games, and Charlotte sent
Ellen a sketch of a horse's head 'by the sacred fingers
of his reverence William Weightman ... you should
have seen the vanity with which he afterwards regarded
his productions. One of them represented the flying
figure of Fame inscribing his own name on the clouds.'
Charlotte sometimes signs these sprightly letters to
Ellen 'Charivari' or 'Caliban,' and addresses her as
'Mrs. Menelaus.'</p>

<p>Now all this exuberant chaff which pervaded
Charlotte's letters to Ellen for a year and a half at the
least was so unlike the picture which Mrs. Gaskell had
formed of her and of her deep and invariable seriousness
of character that, though she saw the letters, and quotes
from them, she omits the whole of these frivolities.
They were not suitable: they could not be recounted
without spoiling the composition of that picture of
Charlotte, always grave and tender and loving, which
she so misleadingly painted. Out of these letters concerning
Celia Amelia (though she does not even hint
at this frivolous nickname by which Charlotte habitually
speaks of him) all that she gives is the edifying information
that he preached a most violent sermon against
Dissenters in Haworth Church, that he was extremely
kind to the poor, and picks out a few sentences in which
Charlotte, evidently in answer to badinage, assures
Ellen that she was not on very amiable terms with him.
'We are distant, cold and reserved. We seldom speak,
and when we do, it is only to exchange the most trivial
and commonplace remarks.' But, as a matter of fact,
throughout this period Charlotte's letters are effervescent
with fun at the kindly expense of Celia Amelia. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
a strain of gaiety is certainly surprising, for at no other
period of her life, except in the last six months of it,
is there any note of merriment, and it is pleasant to
know that there was this interlude of comedy bordering
on farce at the Parsonage.</p>

<p>But another Brontë biographer has more than made
up for Mrs. Gaskell's suppressions, and Miss Isabel
Clarke, in her charmingly written book, <i>Haworth
Parsonage</i>, has added to the Brontë-Saga so amazing a
romance concerning Mr. Weightman and Emily Brontë
that it, and the grounds on which it is based, must be
briefly examined. The grounds are merely that Miss
Robinson (Madame Duclaux) stated in her book on
Emily Brontë that 'the first curate at Haworth (Mr.
Weightman) was exempted from Emily's liberal scorn.'
Miss Clarke suggests that the information was derived
from Ellen Nussey, and on that somewhat bare stem
proceeds to graft a sumptuously flowering romance
which, as far as can be ascertained, is wholly imaginary.
As follows:</p>

<p>Ellen Nussey on her visits to Haworth went for walks
with Mr. Weightman, and to check his amorous attentions
Emily was sent out with them, 'ostensibly in the
capacity of chaperon, thereby earning for herself the
nickname of the &#8220;Major.&#8221;' But, Miss Clarke tells us,</p>

<blockquote><p>while he walked and flirted with Miss Nussey, he glanced
with admiration and something of wonder at the tall slight
form of the 'Major.' He noticed her dark, soft kindling
eyes, her thick hair, the strange, brooding, other-worldly
look. He saw that this girl, destined to so tragic a doom,
was not as the others. She loved him.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now this is rather startling. All we actually know
is that Emily did not dislike Mr. Weightman as much
as she disliked the curates who succeeded him. Miss
Clarke confesses that 'upon that subject Emily allowed
no word to pass her lips. If she made a confidante of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Anne the younger sister never betrayed that confidence,
even after she had gone to her grave.' Nor does
Charlotte in all her numerous allusions to Weightman
ever even hint that Emily was attracted by him. She
tells us that he made eyes at Anne in church, that he
flirted desperately with the Misses Walton, Sugden and
Dury, and for that reason (as Charlotte herself writes)
she warns Ellen not to allow herself to fall under his
charm, for he made love to every girl he met. But
Miss Clarke tells us that this was not the real reason.
These love affairs were, as Charlotte knew, 'merely
ephemeral, for it was still Emily who held his heart.'<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
Then he was in love with her too; Miss Clarke proves
this triumphantly. She tells us 'that he loved her is
undeniable, for she was the last woman in the world to
give her love unsought.'<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> In other words, having invented
the idea that Emily was in love with him, Miss
Clarke asks us to deduce that he must have been in
love with Emily, because otherwise Emily would not
have allowed herself to be in love with him, and with
this firmly established and knit together, the romance
proceeds blithely on its way. Why, if Emily was deeply
in love with Weightman and he deeply in love with
Emily, he did not tell her so and find that his passion
was returned, it would evidently be profane to inquire;
the main fact of their mutual passion is already proved.
It follows, therefore, that when Emily wrote her poem,
<i>If grief for grief can touch thee</i>, ending with the stanza</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yes, by the tears I've poured,</span>
<span class="i1">By all my hours of pain,</span>
<span class="i0">O, I shall surely win thee,</span>
<span class="i1">Beloved, again.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>these lines were addressed to Weightman. Again, when
Charlotte took Emily to Brussels two years later, it was
not, as the ignorant might suppose, on the evidence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>Charlotte's letters, for the purpose of completing their
education with a view to setting up a school, but that
she might 'take her sister away from a position that
his (Weightman's) gay philandering had rendered untenable.'
Emily's unhappiness at Brussels again was not
due to the acute heart-sickness which she always suffered
from when she was away from Haworth, and which
had caused her recall from Miss Wooler's school, but
to the craving for the presence of Weightman. Weightman
died while she was away, and so it is equally clear
that when she wrote <i>Remembrance</i> it was he of whom
she speaks as 'Sweet Love of Youth.' It is true that
she also speaks of 'fifteen wild Decembers' having
passed since his death, whereas there had been only
three, but that, we are assured, was mere camouflage.
Finally, to clinch the matter, Miss Clarke finds in <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> passages that were 'indubitably wrought
out of a passionately emotional experience which imagination
alone could never have inspired.' 'Who else
but Weightman,' she asks us, 'could it have been?'
To that certainly there is no answer, but examine the
evidence (or lack of it) as we may, we can find no sort
of reason for supposing that it was anybody.</p>

<p>We have then two ardent Brontëites, the one of whom,
in dealing with the 'affaire Weightman,' suppresses all
hint of Charlotte's intense preoccupation and amusement
with his numerous flirtations, while the other finds
therein a proof of the deep attachment that existed
between him and Emily. The middle way is perhaps
the safest&mdash;namely, to accept what Charlotte says
about him, and to reject her complete silence as being
evidence for the existence of a romance of which she
gives no hint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>During this period Charlotte's scheme for the educational
career of her sisters and herself was for the present
in abeyance. She had come back from Mrs. Sidgwick's,
and six months later Anne gave up her situation as
governess to Mrs. Ingham's children. The scheme of
starting a joint school, possibly at the Parsonage, was
already being discussed, but there could be no immediate
prospect of that, and, during this winter of 1839-1840,
she and Branwell, still allies, began their literary labours
again&mdash;he on the work of translating the Odes of Horace
into English verse, she on a Richardsonian novel of
which she felt she had the material for half-a-dozen
volumes. Early in 1840 Branwell found a tutorship in
the family of Mr. Postlethwaite at Broughton-in-Furness,
in Westmorland, and from there wrote a highly vigorous
and unedifying letter to John Brown, the sexton at
Haworth and President of the 'Lodge of the Three
Graces,' which strongly resembles some of those letters
which R. L. Stevenson wrote during his period of
turbulent and intemperate adolescence at Edinburgh.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Old Knave of Trumps</span>: Don't think I have forgotten
you, though I have delayed so long in writing to you. It
was my purpose to send you a yarn as soon as I could find
materials to spin one with and it is only just now that I have
had time to turn myself round and know where I am. If
you saw me now you would not know me, and you would
laugh to hear the character the people give me. Oh, the
falsehood and hypocrisy of this world! I am fixed in a
little retired town by the seashore, among wild woody hills
that rise round me&mdash;huge, rocky and capped with clouds.
My employer is a retired County Magistrate, a large landowner,
and of a right hearty and generous disposition. His
wife is a quiet, silent and amiable woman, and his sons are
two fine spirited lads. My landlord is a respectable surgeon,
two days out of seven is as drunk as a lord! His wife is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
bustling, chattering, kind-hearted soul, and his daughter!
oh! death and damnation! Well, what am I? That is,
what do they think I am? A most calm, sedate, sober,
abstemious, patient, mild-hearted, virtuous, gentlemanly philosopher&mdash;the
picture of good works, and the treasure-house
of righteous thoughts. Cards are shuffled under the table-cloth,
glasses are thrust into the cupboard if I enter the room.
I take neither spirits, wine, nor malt liquors, I dress in black,
and smile like a saint or martyr. Everybody says 'What a
good young gentleman is Mr. Postlethwaite's tutor!' This
is a fact as I am a living soul, and right comfortably do I laugh
at them. I mean to continue in their good opinion. I took
a half-year's farewell of old friend whisky at Kendal on the
night after I left. There was a party of gentlemen at the
Royal Hotel and I joined them. We ordered a supper and
whisky-toddy as 'hot as hell'! They thought I was a
physician and put me in the chair. I gave sundry toasts, that
were washed down at the same time, till the room spun round
and the candles danced in our eyes. One of the guests was
a respectable old gentleman with powdered head, rosy cheeks,
fat paunch and ringed fingers. He gave 'The Ladies' ...
after which he brayed off with a speech; and in two minutes,
in the middle of a grand sentence he stopped, wiped his head,
looked wildly round, stammered, coughed, stopped again
and called for his slippers. The waiter helped him to bed.
Next a tall Irish squire and a native of the land of Israel began
to quarrel about their countries, and, in the warmth of argument,
discharged their glasses, each at his neighbour's throat
instead of his own. I recommended bleeding, purging and
blistering, but they administered each other a real 'Jem
Warder,' so I flung my tumbler on the floor too, and swore
I'd join 'Old Ireland!' A regular rumpus ensued, but
we were tamed at last. I found myself in bed next morning
with a bottle of porter, a glass and a corkscrew beside me.
Since then I have not tasted anything stronger than milk and
water, nor, I hope, shall till I return at Midsummer; when
we will see about it. I am getting as fat as Prince William
at Springhead, as godly as his friend Parson Winterbotham.
My hand shakes no longer, I ride to the banker's at Ulveston
with Mr. Postlethwaite, and sit drinking tea and talking
scandal with old ladies. As to the young ones! I have
one sitting by me just now&mdash;fair-faced, blue-eyed, dark-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>haired,
sweet eighteen&mdash;and she little thinks the devil is so
near her!</p>

<p>I was delighted to see thy note, old Squire, but I do not
understand one sentence&mdash;you will perhaps know what
I mean. How are all about you? I long to hear and see
thee again. How is the 'Devil's Thumb'? whom men
call &mdash;&mdash;, and the 'Devil in Mourning,' whom they call &mdash;&mdash;.
How are &mdash;&mdash;, and &mdash;&mdash;, and the Doctor, and him who will
be used as the tongs of hell&mdash;he whose eyes Satan looks
out of, as from windows, I mean &mdash;&mdash;, esquire? How are
little &mdash;&mdash;, 'Longshanks' &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and the rest of them? Are
they married, buried, devilled and damned? When I come
I'll give them a good squeeze of the hand; till then I am too
godly for them to think of. That bow-legged devil used to
ask me impertinent questions which I answered him in kind,
Beelzebub will make of him a walking stick! Keep to thy
teetotalism, old squire, till I return, it will mend thy old
body. Does 'little Nosey' think I have forgotten him?
No, by Jupiter! nor his clock either. I'll send him a remembrance
some of these days! But I must talk to some one
prettier than thee; so goodnight, old boy, and believe me
thine</p>

<p class="right"><i>The Philosopher</i>.</p>

<p>Write directly. Of course you won't show this letter;
and, for Heaven's sake, blot out all the lines scored with red
ink.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now this letter is certainly no uplifting document.
It is full of drink and devil and cheap brag: the writer
wished to exhibit himself as the deuce of a fellow,
and it shocked Mr. Swinburne very much. Evidently
Branwell was trying to be literary and impressive, and
the style in consequence is monstrously pompous and
pretentious, though we cannot deny that the description
of the party at Kendal is vigorous and picturesque. The
letter would not be worth reprinting at all, except that
it furnishes us with an example of Branwell's style in
narrative, and will be useful for subsequent reference.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>It is not, moreover, quite the letter we should have
expected from one who was already supposedly besotted
and ruined by drink and drugs, and this is borne out by
the fact that Bramwell was now engaged in translating
three books of Horace's Odes into English verse. While
tutor to Mr. Postlethwaite's boys he met Hartley Coleridge,
spent a day with him at Ambleside, and sent him,
asking for his opinion, his translation of two of these
books. What Coleridge thought of them there is no
record, but Mr. John Drinkwater, who privately printed
them in 1910, bestowed on them his high commendation.
'The first book,' he tells us, 'need, at their best, fear
comparison with no other version.' He finds in them
passages of clear lyrical beauty; he considers them
'excellent in themselves, and as good as any English
version I know.'</p>

<p>Charlotte had abandoned poetry altogether. 'Once
indeed,' she writes to Henry Nussey early in 1841,
'I was very poetical, when I was sixteen, seventeen,
eighteen, nineteen years old, but now I am twenty-four,
approaching twenty-five, and the intermediate years are
those which begin to rob life of its superfluous colouring.
I have not written poetry for a long while....' But
in peace at Haworth she had been busy during 1839 on
<i>Caroline Vernon</i> and on a Richardsonian novel, and
just as Branwell and she, when they were children, had
agreed to send their poetical compositions to Wordsworth
and Southey, so now, clearly by arrangement,
when Branwell sent his Odes to Hartley Coleridge, she
sent the opening chapters of one of these stories to
Wordsworth. She signed her letter to him 'C. T.', the
initials of Charles Townsend under whose name she
wrote <i>Caroline Vernon</i> and the unnamed story.</p>

<p>She received an answer from him, which is not extant,
but the substance of it can be gathered from her reply
to it. Wordsworth must have been at least as dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>couraging
about her prose as Southey had been about
her verse, and have recommended her to give up writing,
for she answers him:</p>

<blockquote><p>Authors are generally very tenacious of their productions,
but I am not so much attached to them but that I can give
it up without much distress. No doubt, if I had gone on,
I should have made quite a Richardsonian concern of it....
I had material in my head for half a dozen volumes. Of
course, it is with considerable regret I relinquish any scheme
so charming as the one I have sketched.</p></blockquote>

<p>She wishes she had lived fifty or sixty years ago, when
the <i>Ladies' Magazine</i> was flourishing like a green bay
tree.</p>

<blockquote><p>In that case I make no doubt my literary aspirations would
have met with due encouragement, and I should have had
the pleasure of introducing Messrs. Percy and West into the
very best society, and recording all their sayings and doings
in double-columned, close-printed pages.</p></blockquote>

<p>She decidedly resented Wordsworth's letter, for she
continues, deeply sarcastic:</p>

<blockquote><p>I am pleased that you cannot quite decide whether I am an
attorney's clerk or a novel-reading dressmaker. I will not
help you at all in the discovery; and as to my handwriting,
or the ladylike touches in my style and imagery, you must
not draw any conclusions from that&mdash;I may employ an
amanuensis.</p></blockquote>

<p>Evidently Wordsworth touched her on the raw on this
question of her sex, just as in later years, when <i>Jane
Eyre</i> had made Currer Bell famous, she bitterly resented
any conjectures as to whether she was a man or a woman.</p>

<p>The notion of sending part of an immense novel to
Wordsworth (of all arbiters!) was as infelicitous as his
reply seems to have been, and, failing to win encouragement
for the second time in the eyes of the mighty,
Charlotte again gave up all idea of a literary career, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
for the next five years, till the autumn of 1845, she never
set pen to paper except to write her French exercises at
Brussels and letters to her friends. To go out as a
governess again seemed the only thing to do, and during
this year (1840) she made one or two applications for
posts of the sort, but they came to nothing. She paid
visits to Ellen and Mary Taylor; Mary Taylor and her
sister Martha came to Haworth, and with no alien faces
to render her tongue-tied and miserable, her letters
abounded in geniality and enjoyment, and in the intensest
interest in Celia Amelia's amours. But the
moment strangers came to Haworth, even though they
were relations, she was quick to observe and to recount
their deficiencies. Of such were some family connections
from Cornwall, John Branwell Williams and his wife
and daughter, and Charlotte's gimlet eye bored ruthlessly
into their pretensions.</p>

<blockquote><p>They reckon to be very fine folks indeed, and talk largely&mdash;I
thought assumingly. I cannot say I much admired
them; to my eye there seemed to be an attempt to play the
great Mogul down in Yorkshire.... Mrs. Williams sets
up for being a woman of great talents, tact, and accomplishment:
I thought there was more noise than work. My
cousin Eliza is a young lady intended by Nature to be a
bouncing, good-looking girl: Art has trained her to be a
languishing, affected piece of goods.</p></blockquote>

<p>This visit seems to have been brief.</p>

<p>Branwell in the summer completed his engagement
at Mr. Postlethwaite's and returned home with his
Horatian Odes. Painting and poetry alike had failed,
but he was anxious, or at least willing, to employ himself
somehow, and in September he became the booking-clerk
at a small station called Sowerby Bridge. It was a
dismal <i>dégringolade</i> from the brilliant promise of his boyhood
and from the bright hopes which Charlotte, above
all, had entertained about his career, and there is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
than a touch of sarcastic contempt in her announcement
of this to Ellen Nussey. She writes (September 1840):</p>

<blockquote><p>A distant relative of mine, one Patrick Boanerges,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> has
set off to seek his fortune in the wild, wandering, adventurous,
romantic, knight-errant-like capacity of clerk on the Leeds
and Manchester Railroad.</p></blockquote>

<p>So off went Branwell to his ticket-office, and the three
girls remained at Haworth. Throughout Charlotte's
voluminous correspondence during this year, we get
no glimpse at all of their relations to each other, for
Emily's name is never mentioned at all; Anne suffered
from a cold, and Celia Amelia made eyes at her in church.
As for Aunt Branwell, all we know of her is that she
was vastly pleased with the knitting-needle case which
Ellen sent her, and on more than one occasion was
'precious cross.' But the autumn winds blew across
the hills, filling Charlotte with rapture.</p>

<blockquote><p>I see everything [she wrote] <i>couleur de rose</i>, and am strongly
inclined to dance a jig. I think I must partake of the nature
of a pig or an ass&mdash;both which animals are strongly affected
by a high wind. From which quarter the wind blows I cannot
tell, for I never could in my life, but I should very much like
to know how the great brewing tub of Bridlington Bay works,
and what sort of yeasty froth rises just now on the waves.</p></blockquote>

<p>Other causes besides the freedom and seclusion of
Haworth contributed to this joyful serenity, for that
hysterical religious disquiet arising out of her adolescent
passion for Ellen had calmed down completely, and in
her letters, now and henceforth, there is not the smallest
trace of those spiritual aspirations and excitements.
The blaze of that volcanic human attachment, which
gave the other birth, had cooled down also, and a firm
crust of friendship, never to be broken, had formed over
these fires, and now, when Ellen consults her about her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>own matrimonial possibilities, it is indeed a grandmother
(as Charlotte calls herself) who tells Ellen that 'the
majority of these worldly precepts whose seeming coldness
shocks and repels us in youth are founded in
wisdom.' With a somewhat ponderous humour, she
pictures herself advising Ellen's swain who, with a
lover's diffidence, is slow to come to the point, and bids
him</p>

<blockquote><p>begin in a clear, distinct deferential, but determined voice.
'Miss Ellen, I have a question to put to you,&mdash;a very important
question to put to you, Will you take me for your husband
for better for worse? I am not a rich man, but I have
sufficient to support us. I am not a great man but I love you
honestly and truly. Miss Ellen, if you knew the world better
you would see that this is not an offer to be despised, a kind
attached heart and a moderate competency.' Do this, Mr.
Vincent, and you may succeed. Go on writing sentimental
love-sick letters to Henry and I would not give sixpence for
your suit.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then with a solemnity not less portentous she adjures
Ellen not to wait for <i>une grande passion</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>My good girl, <i>une grande passion is une grande folie</i>.... No
young lady should fall in love till the offer has been made,
accepted, the marriage ceremony performed, and the first
half-year of wedded life has passed away. A woman may
then begin to love, but with great precaution, very coolly,
very moderately, very rationally. If she ever loves so much
that a harsh word, or a cold look, cuts her to the heart, she is
a fool....</p></blockquote>

<p>The poor grandmother, so calm, so edifying, so pathetically
ignorant of the entire subject on which she was
giving such comprehensive oracles from the secluded
shrine of Haworth! Presently she was to become very
much younger.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<p>Charlotte's determination that she and her sisters
should teach, should have a career, should 'get on,'
was not only due to special necessities in their individual
case, but, not less, to her general principle that girls
as well as boys should stand on their own feet and make
their way in the world. The early Victorian view
(and, indeed, the mid-Victorian view) was that
marriage was the only career for them, but Charlotte
was far in advance of her age. She wrote, for instance,
a few years later to her friend Mr. Williams,
saying: 'Your daughters, as much as your sons,
should aim at making their way honourably through
life. Do not wish to keep them at home. Believe
me, teachers may be hard-worked, ill-paid and
despised, but the girl who stays at home doing
nothing is worse off than the hardest-wrought and
worst paid drudge of a school.' Considering how
miserable she had been in such situations, this is a most
remarkable utterance. Charlotte was indeed the pioneer
of the movement for the independence of women. No
one before her, and none after her for at least fifty years,
thus stated that girls would be better off if working in
the most uncongenial surroundings than if they stayed at
home.</p>

<p>So the caravans had to leave their oasis of peace, to
travel once more across alien sands, and in the spring
of 1841 both Charlotte and Anne went forth to new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
situations among strangers, while Emily remained at
Haworth. Anne went as governess to the children of the
Reverend Edmund Robinson, an invalid clergyman at
Thorp Green, near York. Here she remained for over
four years, coming home for the holidays, disliking the
place from the first, but patiently and mildly enduring
it without complaint, and solacing herself with the adventures
of Gondaland, and secretly writing a story called
<i>Solala Vernon's Life</i>. Hitherto Anne's literary efforts
had been entirely poetical; some poems she had written
under the name of Olivia Vernon. Of this story we
know nothing, except that by July 1841 she was engaged
on the fourth volume or notebook of it. Probably it
was autobiographical.</p>

<p>Charlotte's situation was as governess to the two
children, a girl of eight and a boy of six, of Mr. and
Mrs. John White of Upperwood House, in the village
of Rawdon, near Bradford. At once the misery that
her shyness among strangers caused her began to descend
on her. She expected them to behave shabbily to her;
she was on the look out for slights and want of consideration,
and within a day of her arrival she wrote to
Ellen Nussey, 'I have <i>as yet</i> had no cause to complain
of want of consideration or civility.' She hated her
employment in itself. She immediately noted that her
pupils were wild and unbroken, though apparently well
disposed, and it does not bode well for the success of
a governess if, as Charlotte writes, 'she finds it hard to
repel the rude familiarities of children.' Her shyness
was not less than an obsession, of which she was aware,
but against which she was powerless.</p>

<blockquote><p>I find it so difficult [she continues] to ask either servants or
mistress for what I want, however much I want it. It is
less pain to me to endure the greatest inconvenience than to
request its removal. I am a fool. Heaven knows I cannot
help it.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>However, it was not so bad as Stonegappe. Charlotte
liked Mr. White extremely; also Ellen's home was
within nine miles of Rawdon, and meetings might be
possible. But, rather ominously, she says, 'Respecting
Mrs. White I am for the moment silent. I am trying
hard to like her.' The effort was not successful.
Charlotte asked her whether she might go to spend a
couple of nights with Ellen during term time, and
Mrs. White said '&#8220;Ye&mdash;e&mdash;es&#8221; in a reluctant cold tone,'
adding that she had better go on Saturday and return
on Monday, so that the children should not miss their
lessons. That was enough: 'You <i>are</i> a genuine Turk'
thought Charlotte, and it is evident there were no more
efforts to like her. Ellen's brother drove her back to
Rawdon on Monday, and because he did not go into
the house Mrs. White got 'quite red in the face with
vexation.' Instantly Charlotte perceived that Mrs.
White's cook, when dressed, had much more the air of
a lady than her mistress.</p>

<blockquote><p>Well can I believe [she writes] that Mrs. White has been an
exciseman's daughter, and I am convinced also that Mr.
White's extraction is very low. I was beginning to think
Mrs. White a good sort of body in spite of all her bouncing
and boasting, her bad grammar and worse orthography, but
I have had experience of one little trait in her character which
condemns her a long way with me. After treating a person
in the most familiar terms of equality for a long time, if any
little thing goes wrong, she does not scruple to give way to
anger in a very coarse, unladylike manner. I think passion
is the true test of vulgarity or refinement.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then Mr. White wrote to Mr. Brontë begging him to
come and spend a week at his house. But Charlotte
would not permit that: 'I don't at all wish papa to
come; it would be like incurring an obligation,' and
so papa did not come.</p>

<p>This ungraciousness, this acutely censorious eye, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the result very largely of her abnormal and invincible
shyness, and the two throughout her life reacted on
each other. She was ill at ease with strangers, and
attributed the discomfort their presence caused her to
their disagreeable qualities. No efforts on their part,
however well-meaning, could deliver her from the
prison of her unhappy temperament, and she sat silent
and unapproachable while they abandoned themselves to
their unfeeling gaieties, and noted their 'coarse imbecilities.'
Her occupation, moreover, was most uncongenial;
'no one but myself,' she writes, 'is aware how
utterly averse my whole mind and nature is to the
employment,' and though she had chosen it for herself
and for her sisters with a definite object in view and
gallantly stuck to it, she found it invariably odious. No
one was ever less suited to be a governess, for she
took the same gloomy view of her charges as of
their parents, and the little Sidgwicks were devils
incarnate, and the little Whites 'noisy, over-indulged,
and hard to manage.' The truth was that she did
not like children, and repelled their 'rude familiarities';
in other words, when they manifested affection
towards her, she did her best to shut them up.
She had, it is true, a tenderness for Mrs. White's
baby, but her admission of this softness takes the
form of a confession. 'By dint of nursing the fat
baby,' she writes, 'it has got to know me and be
fond of me. I suspect myself of growing rather fond
of it. Exertion of any kind is always beneficial.'
Mrs. Gaskell and others have divined from this an
exquisite tenderness in her nature towards the young;
but was there ever a queerer expression of it than the
admission that by <i>dint</i> of nursing the fat baby she had
got fond of it, and that exertion is always beneficial?
She was surprised that she was growing fond of it: it
was odd to her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Branwell meanwhile, after three months of ticket-collecting
at Sowerby Bridge, had been transferred to
another station on the Leeds and Manchester line called
Luddenden Foot. Trains and passengers were few, the
station buildings consisted of one wooden hut, and the
staff of Branwell and a porter. Charlotte, writing to
Emily, agrees that this '<i>looks</i> as if he was getting on at
any rate.' What kind of progress might be expected of
a young man of social tastes and alcoholic tendencies
at a place where there was nothing for him to do and
only a porter to talk to, she does not specify. A more
disastrous environment could hardly be conceived.</p>

<p>After a while things shaped a little better at Upperwood
House; Charlotte wrote to Henry Nussey, her
ex-suitor, that her employers were 'kind, worthy people
in their way,' and returned to Haworth on the last day
of June for three weeks' holiday, after a tussle with
Mrs. White, who thought ten days would be enough.
She found it was Paradise to be at home again. Anne
had already had her holiday and gone back to her situation,
and a small black kitten of the Parsonage was
dead; 'every cup,' Charlotte commented, 'however
sweet, has its drop of bitterness in it.' But Aunt Branwell
was in high good humour, and this just now was
a most fortunate circumstance, for the project of the
three girls setting up a school, long cherished in secret,
especially by Charlotte, was now being discussed by
their elders, and Aunt Branwell's help was necessary to
supply funds to start their enterprise. She had an
invested capital of about £1,500, which brought her in
£50 a year, and though Charlotte had always considered
she was the last person who would offer a loan for the
purpose in question, Miss Branwell was willing to
advance a sum of £100 or £150, provided that a suitable
situation for the school could be found and pupils
were forthcoming; this offer Charlotte considered 'very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
fair.' At last, and at long last, there seemed a definite
chance that the long-cherished scheme of setting up a
school might be realised. She went back to Underwood
House, after three weeks' holiday, full of new hope.
A long time might yet elapse before it could be carried
out, but sufficient capital was now forthcoming, and she
began to consider where the school should be started.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At this point we get, owing to a rare felicity, something
that has long been lacking&mdash;namely, a glimpse,
vivid and authentic, into the life of the Parsonage as
seen by those two inhabitants of it, hitherto so shadowy,
Emily and Anne. It came to Mr. Clement Shorter in
the shape of four folded pieces of paper sent him in a
small box by Charlotte's husband forty years after her
death. These papers were covered with the minute
handwriting of Emily and Anne, two of each. As has
been already seen, they formed a group among the four
children, with secrets of their own and chronicles of
Gondaland, and from these papers it appears that it
was their habit every four years separately to write a
summary of their doings and of the family affairs during
that period, to be opened four years later on Emily's
birthday, July 30. Thus in the year 1841 they wrote
the two summaries which first concern us, and which
would be opened on July 30, 1845. Again, on July 30,
1845, they wrote the summaries of the years 1841-1845
which, had they lived, would have been opened in due
course. Emily's paper of 1841 is as follows:</p>

<p class="center"><i>A Paper to be opened<br>
when Anne is<br>
25 years old, or<br>
my next birthday after<br>
if<br>
all be well.</i><br>
<i>Emily Jane Brontë. July the 30th 1841.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>It is Friday evening near 9 o'clock&mdash;wild rainy weather.
I am seated in the dining room, having just concluded tidying
our desk-boxes, writing this document. Papa is in the parlour&mdash;Aunt
upstairs in her room. She has been reading <i>Blackwood's
Magazine</i> to Papa. Victoria and Adelaide<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> are
ensconsed in the peat-house, Keeper<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> is in the kitchen and
Hero<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> in his cage. We are all stout and hearty, as I hope is
the case with Charlotte, Branwell and Anne, of whom the
first is at John White Esq: Upperwood House, Rawdon,
the second is at Luddenden Foot, and the third is, I believe,
at Scarborough, inditing perhaps a paper corresponding to
this.</p>

<p>A scheme is at present in agitation for setting us up in a
school of our own, as yet nothing is determined, but I hope
and trust it may go on and prosper, and answer our highest
expectations. This day four years I wonder whether we shall
still be dragging on in our present condition or established
to our hearts' content. Time will show.</p>

<p>I guess that at the time appointed for the opening of this
paper, we, <i>i.e.</i>, Charlotte, Anne, and I shall be all merrily
seated in our own sitting room in some pleasant and flourishing
seminary, having just gathered in from the midsummer
lady-day. Our debts will be paid off, and we shall have cash
in hand to a considerable amount. Papa, Aunt and Branwell
will either have been or be coming to visit us. It will be a
fine warm summer evening, very different from this bleak
look-out, and Anne and I will perchance slip out into the
garden for a few minutes to peruse our papers. I hope that
either this or something better will be the case.</p>

<p>The Gondaland are at present in a threatening state, but
there is no open rupture as yet. All the princes and princesses
of the Royalty are at the Palace of Instruction. I have a good
many books on hand, but I am sorry to say that as usual
I make small progress with any. However, I have just made
a new regularity paper! and I must <i>verb sap</i> to do great things.
And now I close, sending from far an exhortation of courage,
boys! courage, to exiled and harassed Anne, wishing she
was here.</p></blockquote>

<p>Certainly this document presents a cheerful picture:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>there is no hint of the tragic sibyl about the girl who so
contentedly records the past, and looks forward to the
next four years in so optimistic a fashion. She was
alone with her aunt and her father, with a bulldog and
a hawk, looking forward to the moment four years
hence when she and Anne will 'peruse' the papers
they 'indited' to-day, and Anne will know that four
years ago she sent an exhortation of courage to the
harassed exile. Charlotte was exiled too, and, as her
letters so volubly testify, abundantly harassed by the
vulgarities of the low-born, but to her sufferings Emily
makes no allusion. It is just worth while to notice this,
though without stressing it. The debts which she
refers to and hopes will be paid when the school
prospers are clearly those which may be incurred, owing
to initial expenses. It has been suggested that they
were debts incurred by Branwell, but for this there is
no particle of evidence. It is, however, worth mentioning,
since we abundantly find in the Brontë-Saga
suggestions that the sisters went out as governesses and
tried to start a school in order to pay his debts.</p>

<p>It is the complete reticence of Emily concerning the
fire, mystical and rapturous and sombre, which we know
inspired her, that strikes us most in this domestic record.
Not the tip of a red tongue of flame nor any hot breath
of the furnace escapes, nor yet the cold wind of the arctic
night which encompassed her when only a few days
before the date of this pleasant and contented chronicle
she wrote that untitled poem beginning,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">I see around me tombstones grey</span>
<span class="i0">Stretching their shadows far away.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Icy despair at the woes of this transitory life suffuses it,
yet there glows in it lambent fire, the hot, passionate love
of the Earth, as when, in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, Catherine
dreams that she was dead and so miserable in Heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
that in anger the angels threw her out, and she woke
sobbing for joy to find herself once more in the heather
of the moor. To the record of her inner life Emily
gave access to none&mdash;not even to the secret eyes of
Anne, who, four years later, as we shall see in the second
group of these papers, said that she knew only that
Emily was writing poetry, and wondered what it was
about.</p>

<p>Herein we begin to see something of the vital difference
between the nature of Charlotte and Emily, the
abysmal, impassable gulf that separated the great talent
of the one from the genius of the other. Charlotte in
her novels used not once, but over and over again, both
in motive and episode, the actual experiences of her
life&mdash;its detested occupations, the relationship between
employer and employed as she encountered them in
her schoolings, bitterly caricaturing those who had
offended her. Emily, on the other hand, save in a
few commemorative poems, never drew from external
experience&mdash;her inspiration, like that of the mystic, came
wholly from within, and her work glowed and was fed
by the fire and wine of the soul that dwelt apart.</p>

<p>Anne's corresponding paper, written at Scarborough,
fills in the hitherto faint outline of her piety and gentleness.
She does not like her present situation at Thorp
Green and wishes to change it: owing to Charlotte's
plans, she actually remained there for four years more.
She gives almost precisely the same details about the
past movements of the family as Emily does, adding the
exact ages of them all in years and months. Charlotte's
various situations are recorded in a short sentence, and
about Emily she makes a comment which is surely
significant: 'We are all of us,' she writes, 'doing
something for our own livelihood, except Emily, who,
however, is as busy as any of us, and in reality earns her
food and raiment as much as we do.' We can certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
infer from this that there had been a feeling in someone's
mind&mdash;and there is no need to ask in whose&mdash;that
Emily should not be idling at home while her sisters
were earning their living. With regard to the future,
Anne too hopes that the idea of the joint school will
materialise, but quotes from one of her own poems:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">How little know we what we are,</span>
<span class="i1">How less what we may be.</span>
</div></div>

<blockquote><p>... What will the next four years bring forth? Providence
only knows. But we have sustained very little alteration
since that time [<i>i.e.</i> of the last papers four years ago]. I have
the same faults that I had then, only I have more wisdom and
experience, and a little more self-possession than I then
enjoyed. I am now engaged in writing the fourth volume of
<i>Solala Vernon's Life</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>These papers, then, beyond what they present to us
of domestic furnishings, are valuable as showing us
Emily moving about content and cheerful, but silent as
Wuthering Heights itself lying white beneath its winter
snows about the things that truly concerned her, and
of Anne, uncomplaining and patient, meekly accepting
the decrees of Providence and busy, pathetically busy,
over the fourth volume of <i>Solala Vernon's Life</i>, for
neither in verse nor prose had she more than the most
mediocre talent. These two sisters wrote solely for
each other. Charlotte has no part in their secret papers,
and both their pens seem to pass over her name without
comment. But Emily sends a message of encouragement
to Anne, and Anne speaks up on Emily's behalf,
as if someone had unjustly reproached her for idleness.</p>

<i>From a painting by Branwell Brontë in the National Portrait Gallery.</i></span>
</div>

<p>Charlotte had gone back to Dewsbury Moor before
these papers were written; now there came for her a
letter from her friend Mary Taylor, who, with her sister
Martha, was at school at Brussels, and the gift of a silk
scarf and a pair of kid gloves. This letter first suggested
to her an idea which proved to have a profound
effect on her life. She wrote to Ellen about it:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mary's letter spoke of some of the pictures and cathedrals
she had seen&mdash;pictures the most exquisite, cathedrals the most
venerable. I hardly know what swelled to my throat as
I read her letter: such a vehement impatience of restraint
and steady work, such a strong wish for wings&mdash;wings such
as wealth can furnish: such an earnest thirst to see, to know,
to learn: something internal seemed to expand boldly for a
minute. I was tantalised with the consciousness of faculties
unexercised: then all collapsed, and I despaired.</p></blockquote>

<p>But the collapse was but momentary. Mary's letter
immediately kindled in her a spark that should soon
blaze high. It crept along in her mind and presently
it united itself with the other fire that always burned
there, namely, the school-keeping scheme. She began
to wonder whether her longing to see the pictures and
cathedrals of which Mary spoke could not be gratified in
conjunction with the other. How much more likely
she and her sisters would be to succeed with their school
if a further education, the acquisition of a larger knowledge
of French and German, could be acquired at
Brussels!</p>

<p>But just then another opportunity came in view, and
it looked as if the prospect of setting up a school (or
rather of taking over one that already existed) was
capable of instant realisation. Miss Margaret Wooler,
at whose establishment at Dewsbury Moor Charlotte
had been a teacher and Emily and Anne pupils, had now
retired, leaving the place to be carried on by her sister.
Now this sister intended to give it up, for it had not
prospered lately, and Miss Wooler proposed to Charlotte
that she should take it on and try to revive it, singly at
first, then in conjunction with Emily and Anne; she
also offered her the use of her furniture. Charlotte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a><br><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
cordially accepted this very generous proposal, but
pending its completion, she sat down to think. Her
aunt had agreed to advance a loan up to £150 to meet
initial expenses, but now, since the furniture of the
house would be lent her, that loan might be used in
other ways. Before Miss Wooler answered her letter
of acceptance, she wrote to Aunt Branwell as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>A plan has been approved by Mr. and Mrs. White and
others, which I wish now to impart to you. My friends
recommend me if I desire to secure permanent success, to
delay commencing the school for six months longer, and by
all means to contrive by hook or by crook, to spend the
intervening time in some school on the continent. They
say schools in England are so numerous, competition so
great, that without some such step towards attracting
superiority we shall probably have a very hard struggle and
may fail in the end. They say, moreover, that the loan of
£100, which you have been so kind as to offer us, will perhaps
not be all required now, as Miss Wooler will lend us the
furniture; and that, if the speculation is intended to be a
good and successful one, half the sum at least ought to be
paid out in the manner I have mentioned, thereby insuring
a more speedy repayment both of interest and capital.</p>

<p>I would not go to France or to Paris. I would go to
Brussels in Belgium. The cost of the journey there, at the
dearest rate of travelling, would be £5: living is there little
more than half as dear as it is in England, and the facilities
for education are equal or superior to any other place in
Europe. In half a year I could acquire a thorough familiarity
with French, and could improve greatly in Italian and even
get a dash of German, <i>i.e.</i>, provided my health continued
as good as it is now. Martha Taylor is now staying in Brussels,
at a first-rate establishment there. I should not think of
going to the Château de Kockleberg, where she is resident,
as the terms are much too high; but if I wrote to her, she,
with the assistance of Mrs. Jenkins, the wife of the British
Consul, would be able to secure me a cheap and decent
residence and respectable protection. I should have the
opportunity of seeing her frequently, she would make me
acquainted with the city, and, with the assistance of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
cousins, I should probably in time be introduced to connections
far more improving, polished, and cultivated than
any I have yet known.</p>

<p>These are advantages which would turn to vast account,
when we actually commenced a school&mdash;and, if Emily could
share them with me, only for a single half year, we could
take a footing in the world afterwards which we can never
do now. I say Emily instead of Anne: for Anne might take
her turn at some future period, if our school answered. I
feel certain, while I am writing, that you will see the propriety
of what I say: you always like to use your money to
the best advantage, you are not fond of making shabby
purchases: when you do confer a favour, it is often done
in style, and depend upon it £50 or £100, thus laid out, would
be well employed. Of course, I know of no other friend in
the world to whom I could apply on this subject, except
yourself. I feel an absolute conviction that, if the advantage
were allowed us, it would be the making of us for life.
Papa will perhaps think it a wild and ambitious scheme, but
who can rise in the world without ambition? When he left
Ireland to go to Cambridge, he was as ambitious as I am
now. I want us <i>all</i> to get on. I know we have talents, and
I want them to be turned to account. I look to you, aunt,
to help us. I think you will not refuse. I know, if you
consent, it shall not be my fault if you ever repent your
kindness.</p></blockquote>

<p>A more tactful and diplomatic letter could not be
conceived. Charlotte had the support of the Whites
and other friends for her suggestion. She congratulated
her aunt upon the wise way in which she always laid
out her money, a foe to shabby presents; she disarmed
her father's possible opposition by the flattering reminder
that he, too, in his day had been ambitious, or he, the
son of an Irish peasant, would never have succeeded in
getting a University education, and she made a powerful
suggestion to her aunt that she was going to consent.
Miss Branwell's answer, though there were points yet
to be settled, was favourable enough to cause Charlotte
to cancel her acceptance of Miss Wooler's offer. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
did so apparently without much sense of gratitude for
it, writing to Ellen:</p>

<blockquote><p>I am not going to Dewsbury Moor as far as I can see at
present. It was a decent friendly proposal on Miss Wooler's
part, and cancels all or most of her little foibles in my estimation;
but Dewsbury Moor is a poisoned place to me, besides
I burn to go somewhere else. I think, Nell, I see a chance
of getting to Brussels.... Dewsbury Moor was an obscure
dreary place not adapted for a school.</p></blockquote>

<p>She had finished with Dewsbury Moor.</p>

<p>Charlotte had now completely transformed the original
idea of the school to be started with Miss Branwell's
assistance, where the three sisters might be together,
though that was to come later, with the prospect of the
greater success that their improved educational equipment
would give them. This entailed many changes
in the first plan, which, with her masterly efficiency, she
now proceeded to make, for the sake of the general
object of them 'all getting on.' Emily, she settled with
Miss Branwell's approval, was to accompany her to
Brussels. 'I wished for one, at least, of my sisters,' she
wrote to Ellen, 'to share the advantage with me. I
fixed on Emily. She deserved the reward, I knew.'
How far Emily appreciated that reward is another
question: she had pined with home-sickness when she
had been only three months from Haworth at Miss
Wooler's school, and now she was to be transplanted
to Brussels for six. Indeed, Charlotte's plans went far
beyond that, now that Miss Branwell had sanctioned
them so far, for in a few weeks she wrote to Emily,
saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>Before our half year in Brussels is completed, you and I will
have to seek employment abroad. It is not my intention to
retrace my steps home till twelve months if all continues
well, and we and those at home retain good health.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then there was Anne. A few months before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Charlotte had written to Ellen most tenderly about her,
for Anne was unhappy in her situation as governess to
the family of Mrs. Robinson:</p>

<blockquote><p>I have one aching feeling at my heart. It is about Anne;
she has so much to endure; far, far more than I have. When
my thoughts turn to her, they always see her as a patient
persecuted stranger. I know what concealed susceptibility
is in her nature, when her feelings are wounded. I wish
I could be with her to administer a little balm. She is more
lonely, less gifted with the power of making friends even
than I am.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now there is a very sincere and affectionate anxiety in
these words; of that there can be no doubt. But the
Brussels plan, for the eventual benefit of them all, now
overrode in Charlotte's mind all other considerations.
'Anne for the present,' as Charlotte wrote to Emily,
'seems omitted in it, but if all goes right I trust she will
derive her full share of benefit from it in the end.' But
why, we cannot help asking, should not Charlotte have
arranged that Anne, over whose loneliness she mourned,
longing to be with her, should accompany her to Brussels
where they would be together, while Emily, who was
abjectly miserable away from Haworth, remained at
home? The answer seems plain: Emily was wasting
her time at Haworth, she was doing nothing towards the
project of the school, for which further education at
Brussels would be of such assistance, and she was earning
nothing. This seems to accord with Anne's gentle
protest in her secret paper that Emily was as busy as
any of them, and the implication that Charlotte thought
otherwise. Anne, on the other hand, was gaining experience
in teaching, and was earning her livelihood.
So, much as she disliked the situation, and much as
Charlotte longed to be with her and comfort her loneliness,
it was better that Anne should remain at Thorp
Green and continue, as Charlotte wrote in her notes on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Anne's poems, 'to taste the cup of life as it is mixed for
the class termed &#8220;governesses,&#8221;' while Emily came to
Brussels. They all must get on, and all must work, at
whatever personal sacrifice.</p>

<p>There were still many inquiries to be made about a
suitable establishment at Brussels when the sisters were
together again at Haworth for Christmas, 1841. Branwell
was expected, but did not arrive; he had not been seen
at Haworth for the last five months, though the station
at Luddenden Foot, where he had gone in what Charlotte
ironically called 'his wild, wandering, adventurous,
romantic, knight-errant-like capacity of ticket collector,'
was not more than a dozen miles off. When he did
arrive in January 1842, it was because he had been dismissed
from his high estate. He had made a habit of
leaving the ticket-office in that solitary shanty in care
of his colleague the porter, and had spent his days
drinking heavily in hospitable farm-houses and pot-houses
of the neighbourhood. His colleague had
pocketed the money which he received for the tickets,
and when the audit was made, the cash that should have
been received by the ticket-collector was far from tallying
with the price of the tickets that had been purchased.
Though Branwell was not personally suspected of theft,
his neglect and carelessness of his duties had been
monstrous, and it was no wonder that the Leeds and
Manchester Railway Company had no further use for
him.</p>

<p>Meantime there had arisen the question as to whether
better educational advantages would not be obtained at
Lille than at Brussels, but further inquiries made by
Mr. Jenkins (who proved not to be British Consul in
Brussels, but chaplain to the British Embassy) led to
the selection of the <i>pensionnat</i> kept by Madame Héger<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> in
the Rue d'Isabelle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>Emily and Charlotte, accompanied by their father,
set off sometime during February 1842. Mr. Brontë
remained in Brussels one night, and then returned to
Haworth. He had prudently written out for himself a
list of the French equivalents of the things he might be
called upon to ask for during his return journey when
he would be without interpreters. Charlotte's scheme
had been carried out in bulk and detail. Just as her
father had gone up to Cambridge at the age of twenty-five,
<i>in statu pupillari</i> after being a master at an Irish
school, so she at the same age, after being a mistress at
Miss Wooler's and governess at Stonegappe and Underwood
House, became a pupil again in Madame Héger's
<i>pensionnat</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<p>The external features and internal arrangements of the
<i>pensionnat</i> were reproduced by Charlotte with such
accurate and photographic detail in <i>The Professor</i> and
<i>Villette</i>, that it is unnecessary to describe them. Mrs.
Gaskell says that there were eighty to a hundred pupils
there at the time,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> but Charlotte in a letter to Ellen states
that there were about forty day pupils and twelve
boarders.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The terms for board and tuition were
650 francs per annum, so that Miss Branwell's loan, even
if it was only £50, not £100, easily covered the total
expenses of the two girls for six months. The boarders
all slept in one dormitory, at the far end of which, withdrawn
behind a curtain, were Charlotte's and Emily's
beds. Miss Branwell had paid something extra for this
privilege, and Charlotte 'considered it kind' of her. It
felt strange to her at first to be a pupil and once more 'to
submit to authority instead of exercising it,' but she liked
it. She had come here to learn, in order to fit herself
for the future she had planned for herself and her sisters,
and the life was congenial and delightful compared with
that of a governess. The difference between the sisters
and the other pupils in the matter of age, nationality, and
religion caused her and Emily to be 'completely isolated
in the midst of numbers,' but constant occupation and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>intense interest in it made the time pass only too quickly
for her. The great chance was hers, and she meant to
drain the utmost drop of profit from it.</p>

<p>Emily, on the other hand, was throughout her time
here entirely wretched. She was always unhappy away
from Haworth, the presence of strangers had a more
appalling effect on her than even on Charlotte, and when
the two on school holidays went to see Mary and
Martha Taylor, who were being educated at the Château
de Kockleberg, or visited Mrs. Jenkins, Emily sat dumb
and miserable. M. Héger and she, Charlotte recorded,
'did not draw well together at all,' and otherwise in her
letters scarcely mentioned her. But the account she
gave of Emily in the prefatory memoir she wrote to her
poems after her death is heartrending. She alluded to
the misery Emily experienced when at school, and</p>

<blockquote><p>now (at Brussels) the same suffering and conflict ensued,
heightened by the strong recoil of her upright, heretic and
English spirit from the gentle Jesuitry of the foreign and
Romish system. Once more she seemed sinking, but this
time she rallied through the mere force of resolution: with
inward remorse and shame she looked back on her former
failure, and resolved to conquer in this second ordeal. She
did conquer, but the victory cost her dear.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is possible that retrospective exaggeration tinges this
account, but Brussels was evidently an inferno to the
unhappy girl. Charlotte is strangely at error about
Emily's age in this memoir; she says she was twenty
when she went to Brussels, whereas, as a matter of fact,
having been born in 1818, she passed her twenty-fourth
birthday there.</p>

<p>During this first sojourn at Brussels, Charlotte wrote
very few letters to Ellen. Being amongst strangers
produced its invariable reactions, and she found the
folk among whom she was thus isolated almost as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
disagreeable as those of her days of bondage as governess.
Madame Héger came off best. She</p>

<blockquote><p>is a lady of precisely the same cast of mind, degree of cultivation,
and quality of intellect as Miss Catherine Wooler.
I think the severe points are a little softened, because she
has not been disappointed and consequently soured. In
other words, she is a married instead of a maiden lady.</p></blockquote>

<p>(Perhaps this is not so much appreciation of Mme. Héger
as depreciation of Miss Wooler.) Then there were the
three other mistresses&mdash;Mdlle. Blanche, Mdlle. Sophie,
Mdlle. Marie:</p>

<blockquote><p>The two first have no particular character. One is an old
maid, the other will be one. Mademoiselle Marie is talented
and original but of repulsive and arbitrary manners.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then there is M. Héger:</p>

<blockquote><p>A man of power as to mind, but very choleric and irritable
in temperament: a little black being, with a face that varies
in expression. Sometimes he borrows the lineaments of
an insane tom-cat, sometimes those of a delirious hyena;
occasionally but very seldom he discards these perilous
attractions and assumes an air not above 100 degrees removed
from mild and gentlemanlike.... The few private lessons
M. Héger has vouchsafed to give us are, I suppose, to be
considered a great favour, and I can perceive they have already
excited much spite and jealousy in the school.</p></blockquote>

<p>Brussels, she found, was a selfish city, and this a selfish
school.</p>

<blockquote><p>If the national character of the Belgians is to be measured
by the character of most of the girls in this school, it is a
character singularly cold, selfish, animal, and inferior ...
their principles are rotten to the core.</p></blockquote>

<p>Their religion was as vile as themselves.</p>

<blockquote><p>My advice to all Protestants who are tempted to do anything
so besotted as to turn Catholics is, to walk over the sea
on to the continent; to attend Mass sedulously for a time;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
to note well the mummeries thereof; also the idiotic mercenary
aspect of all the priests; and <i>then</i>, if they are still disposed to
consider Papistry in any other light than a most feeble,
childish piece of humbug, let them turn Papists at once&mdash;that's
all.</p></blockquote>

<p>In spite of these disagreeable companions and uncongenial
surroundings, Charlotte found that Brussels was
fulfilling her expectations; it is evident also that
Monsieur and Madame thought highly of the abilities of
both the sisters, for in an undated letter to Ellen, Charlotte
writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>I consider it doubtful whether I shall come home in
September or not. Madame Héger has made a proposal
for both me and Emily to stay another half-year, offering to
dismiss her English master, and take me as English teacher:
also to employ Emily some part of the day in teaching music
to a certain number of the pupils. For these services we
are to be allowed to continue our studies in French and
German, and to have board, etc., without paying for it: no
salaries, however, are offered.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is clear that this proposal must have been accepted by
Charlotte on behalf of Emily and herself, though by the
original arrangement they would have returned to
England in August, at the end of their six months, for
they both stopped at Brussels, through the <i>vacances</i>, into
the new term which opened in September, and Charlotte
began giving English lessons to younger pupils and
Emily was teaching them the piano. Emily was now
'drawing together better' with M. Héger, and Charlotte,
with a dryness that contrasts curiously with the passionate
and perhaps remorseful tenderness of her subsequent
memoir, says that 'Monsieur et Madame Héger begin to
recognise the valuable parts of her character, under her
singularities.'<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Subsequently M. Héger spoke in the
very highest terms of Emily's abilities, ranking them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>far above Charlotte's, both in mental grasp and in
imaginative power.</p>

<p>The two sisters were therefore now installed as
pupil teachers at the <i>pensionnat</i> for another half-year.
Charlotte, it may be remembered, had told Emily she
did not propose to come back to England under twelve
months. Late in October, Martha Taylor, Mary's sister,
died suddenly at the Château de Kockleberg; Charlotte
wrote of her very tenderly in <i>Shirley</i> as Jessie Yorke.
Then on November 2nd Charlotte got news of Miss Branwell's
serious illness, and, on the next day, of her death.
The sisters sailed from Antwerp on the 6th, arriving at
Haworth two days afterwards, to find the funeral was
over. Though Miss Branwell had supplied the funds
wherewith Charlotte had realised her dream of going
to Brussels, she had never had any affection for her
aunt, and writing to Ellen immediately afterwards, she
expressed neither sorrow nor gratitude. 'All was over,'
she says. 'We shall see her no more. Papa is pretty
well'; then a fortnight later, inviting her friend to
Haworth, she says: 'Do not fear to find us melancholy
or depressed, we are all much as usual. You will see
no difference from our former demeanour.' There is
no further allusion in her subsequent letters either to
Miss Branwell or to Mr. Weightman, Celia Amelia,
whose death had preceded Miss Branwell's by a few
days.</p>

</div>

<p>Branwell throughout this year had been living at
Haworth since his dismissal from Luddenden Foot. He
had there made friends with a young engineer on the
Leeds and Manchester line, Francis H. Grundy, who
was immensely impressed, even as the commercial
travellers at the 'Black Bull' had been, by the brilliance of
Branwell's conversation, and was perfectly frank regarding
his drunken habits. In his <i>Pictures of the Past</i>
he tells us that Branwell, just before he made his acquaintance,
had been in the habit also of taking opium,
in emulation of De Quincey, but broke himself of it,
though before the end of his life he resumed it again.
There are several letters from Branwell to him during
this year. Branwell had asked him if he could get him
another appointment in the employment of the railway,
but was not surprised to hear that there was no chance
of it. He wisely rejected the idea of going into the
Church, remarking that 'I have not one mental qualification,
save perhaps hypocrisy, which would make me
cut a figure in the pulpit.' He alone seems to have felt
any regret for Miss Branwell's death, whose favourite
he had always been, and refers to her, who, he said, had
been his mother for twenty years, with sincere feeling.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
He cannot at this period have been the utter wreck which
he is represented to have been, for after this year at
Haworth he became tutor to Mr. Robinson's boys at
Thorp Green, where Anne was already governess; they
went there together directly after the Christmas holidays,
and remained there for the next two years and a half.
This Christmas of 1842, Mrs. Gaskell tells us, 'they all
enjoyed inexpressibly. Branwell was with them; that
was always a pleasure at this time.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaskell makes some curiously erroneous statements
with regard to Miss Branwell's will and the disposition
of her money. She states:</p>

<blockquote><p>The small property which she had accumulated by dint of
personal frugality and self-denial, was bequeathed to her
nieces. Branwell, her darling, was to have had his share:
but his reckless expenditure had distressed the good old
lady, and his name was omitted in her will.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Subsequent biographers have followed her without
troubling to verify her information, and we find Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a><br><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>Robinson (Mme. Duclaux), for instance, closely paraphrasing
Mrs. Gaskell. She says:</p>

<blockquote><p>The little property she (Miss Branwell) had saved out of
her frugal income was all left to her three nieces. Branwell
had been her darling, her only son, called by her name, but
his disgrace had wounded her too deeply. He was not
even mentioned in her will.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>These statements, which have passed into accredited
Brontë-Saga, are so wide of the truth that it is worth
while correcting their errors. The facts are these:
Miss Branwell's will was drawn up at York on April 30,
1833, and it was this will, made more than nine years
before, which was now proved. At the time when she
made her will Branwell was fifteen years old, and it is
quite impossible that at that age 'his reckless expenditure'
or his 'disgrace' had caused his aunt to revoke a
previous will, and cut him off from the share she
had intended for him; nor is there the slightest
reason to suppose that any such previous will ever
existed. He was, moreover, mentioned in her will:
she left of her personal effects an Indian workbox
to Charlotte, her china-topped workbox and an ivory
fan to Emily, her Japan dressing-box to Branwell,
her watch and various trinkets to Anne. Again, she
did not leave her capital to her three nieces, but to four
nieces, the Brontë girls being three of them, the fourth,
Anne Kingston, being the daughter of another sister.
Her capital was proved at 'under £1500' (<i>i.e.</i> over £1400),
and her income of £50 a year was derived from it, and
was not the result of frugality; she had been left it by
her father. A further provision in her will was that her
property should be divided between her nieces when the
youngest of them attained the age of twenty-one. Anne,
the youngest, at the time of her death was twenty-two,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>and therefore as soon as the will was proved the three
sisters each came into a sum of over £300.</p>

<p>On the sudden departure of Charlotte and Emily
from Brussels owing to their aunt's death, M. Héger
wrote a letter to Mr. Brontë, which they brought with
them. He spoke in it of his great regret, due to more
than one cause, at their leaving the school; and this
letter certainly must have carried great weight in determining
the decision which so profoundly affected
Charlotte's future life and work. He wrote<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>En perdant nos deux chères élèves, nous ne devons pas
vous cacher que nous éprouvons à la fois et du chagrin et de
l'inquiétude; nous sommes affligés parce que cette brusque
séparation vient briser l'affection presque paternelle que nous
leur avons vouée, et notre peine s'augmente à la vue de tant
de travaux interrompus, de tant de choses bien commencées,
et qui ne demandent que quelque temps encore pour être
menées à bonne fin. Dans un an chacune de vos demoiselles
eût été entièrement prémunie contre les éventualités de
l'avenir; chacune d'elles acquérait à la fois et l'instruction
et la science d'enseignement: ... encore un an tout au
plus et l'&#339;uvre était achevée et bien achevée. Alors nous
aurions pu, si cela vous eût convenu, offrir à mesdemoiselles
vos filles ou du moins à l'une des deux une position qui eût été
dans ses goûts, et qui lui eût donné cette douce indépendance
si difficile à trouver pour une jeune personne.... Nous
savons, Monsieur, que vous pèserez plus mûrement et plus
sagement que nous la conséquence qu'aurait pour l'avenir
une interruption complète dans les études de vos deux filles;
vous déciderez ce qu'il faut faire, et vous nous pardonnerez
notre franchise, si vous daignez considérer que le motif qui
nous fait agir est une affection bien désintéressée et qui
s'affligerait beaucoup de devoir déjà se résigner à n'être plus
utile à vos chères enfants.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>The effect of so emphatic and so kindly a persuasion
might easily and naturally have determined Charlotte
to go back to Brussels, as M. Héger strongly advised;
Madame also, who up till now was on excellent terms
with her, wrote her a kind and affectionate letter.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
Indeed, on the face of it, there seemed to be every reason
for so doing. Emily, who, as Charlotte says in her
memoir, had barely with the utmost power of her resolution
got through the ordeal of living away from Haworth,
would remain at the Parsonage with her father, while
she went back to complete the education through which
all the sisters would jointly profit when their school was
established. Moreover, there was now no difficulty
about money; they had, all three of them, come into
a sum of £300, left them by Miss Branwell; besides, as
it turned out, Mme. Héger amended her original offer of
merely granting Charlotte board and tuition free, in
return for the English class she was to hold, and gave
her in addition a salary of £16. As the charges for
board and tuition were only £26 a year, Charlotte got
food, lodging, and tuition for £10. Yet in spite of all
this, in spite of the fact that it was strictly in accordance
with her principles about all girls, not Brontës alone,
making their way in the world, that she should return
to Brussels, and that Anne should go back to her post
as governess at Thorp Green, Charlotte subsequently
wrote to Ellen, saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>I returned to Brussels after aunt's death against my conscience,
prompted by what then seemed an irresistible impulse.
I was punished for my selfish folly by a withdrawal for more
than two years of happiness and peace of mind.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now these are strong expressions, and for many years
controversy raged over them. It was hard to understand
why it should have been against Charlotte's conscience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>to return there in accordance with M. Héger's very kind
and competent advice, and continue the course which
had been broken off by the purely extraneous circumstance
of Miss Bramwell's death, or why it should have
been 'senseless folly' so to do, or why this senseless folly,
which apparently was so eminently reasonable and wise,
should have resulted in so long a forfeit of happiness
and peace of mind. The only conjecture that was made
by those who knew Charlotte best, namely, her friend
Ellen Nussey and her subsequent husband Mr. Nicholls,
was that she felt she ought to have stopped at home to
look after her father, for he, like Branwell, drank too
much, and her firm presence at Haworth might have
checked this tendency.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Therein we are let into another
grim secret of the life at the Parsonage, but, as revelations
which came out more than fifty years afterwards proved,
this conjecture was not the real reason.</p>

<p>Certain students of Charlotte's novels formed another
theory. They knew (as who does not?) that she used
in her books every possible scrap of personal experience:
there was never an author of fiction who owed so much
to her own actual life. Cowan Bridge School, her
sufferings as governess, the curates, her friends Mary and
Martha Taylor, her sister Emily, the scenery and setting
of her books, and, above all, she herself are drawn often
photographically and without disguise. These students,
working on a sound principle, found in <i>Villette</i>
numbers of such portraits of M. Héger and the rest; the
<i>pensionnat</i> in the Rue d'Isabelle was presented with the
most exact fidelity, down to minute details, and they
conjectured that Lucy Snowe's passionate devotion to
her teacher, Paul Emmanuel, was a fictional but faithful
transcript of Charlotte's feelings for M. Héger. The
whole of the book, so they rightly pointed out, was
a slice carved from her life: it was reasonable to suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>that the central <i>motif</i> was carved from it too. Such a
theory also explained the nature of 'the irresistible
impulse' to return to Brussels, and why this 'selfish
folly' had so disastrous an effect on her happiness:
Charlotte would scarcely (so they argued) have applied
'irresistible impulse' to her desire to learn more German,
nor, since this acquisition was to result in benefit for
her sisters as well, was this scholastic ambition a selfish
folly. There was something more. She knew, they
suggested, that she was falling in love with M. Héger
and could not resist that fatal and dangerous impulse to
go back to him.</p>

<p>Such a notion, considered as degrading and disfiguring
to the image of Charlotte as presented by Mrs. Gaskell,
brought down on these theorists vials of scorn and
opprobrium. Her champions felt it to be a monstrous
outrage that she should be suspected of having fallen
in love with a married man. No one had suggested that
there was any semblance of an actual love-affair arising
out of this situation, or that Charlotte's devotion to her
professor was returned by him; but many ardent
Brontëites, in no less ardent language, were unspeakably
shocked by the mere suggestion that she loved him, and
a furious indignation inspired their pens. They proved
to their own satisfaction that not only was there no
evidence to support so malevolent a notion, but that
anyone who knew anything about Charlotte's puritanical
uprightness must have known also that she was incapable
of such a spontaneous surrender, and they proved it by
a hurricane of arguments that swept all before it. Then,
nearly sixty years after her death, came the conclusive
evidence that all they had proved to be false was perfectly
true.</p>

<p>Charlotte returned then to Brussels alone during the
last week of January 1843. Madame Héger, she wrote
to Ellen, received her with great kindness, and both she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
and her husband, for whom alone she felt regard and
esteem, did all they could to make her at home, telling
her to use their sitting-room as if it was her own, whenever
she was not engaged in the schoolroom. She gave
lessons in English to M. Héger and his brother-in-law,
M. Chapelle, whose wife was the sister of M. Héger's
first wife. They were both quick in learning, especially
M. Héger, though the efforts they made to acquire an
English pronunciation would have made Ellen 'laugh
to all eternity.' Apparently there had been an idea that
Ellen should have come out to Brussels with Charlotte,
for she wrote again early in April, saying: 'During the
bitter cold weather we had through February and the
principal part of March, I did not regret that you had
not accompanied me.' She was occasionally lonely,
but happy, she affirmed, compared to what she had been
when a governess. Then we infer that there must have
been some badinage on Ellen's part, such as the two
friends indulged in over the susceptible Mr. Weightman,
for Charlotte denies with considerable asperity the report
that had reached Ellen that she had gone back to Brussels
'in some remote hope of entrapping a husband.' She
lives, she assures her, in 'total seclusion,' never speaking
to any man except M. Héger, and seldom to him.
Possibly, then, the English lessons had already come to
an end.</p>

<p>By May Charlotte had already been in Brussels for
twelve months altogether, and there must have been some
idea that she would then return, but in answer to an
inquiry of Ellen's, Emily wrote to tell her that 'Charlotte
has never mentioned a word about coming home.' She
adds a somewhat acid comment: 'If you would go over
for half a year, perhaps you might be able to bring her
back with you, otherwise she might vegetate there till
the age of Methuselah for mere lack of courage to face
the voyage.' Simultaneously Charlotte wrote to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Branwell, saying: 'I grieve that Emily is so solitary;
but, however, you and Anne will soon be returning for
the holidays, which will cheer the house for the time.'
Clearly, she had no intention of going home herself.
Branwell, it may be noticed, who had now been four
months with Anne at Thorp Green, must have been
conducting himself decently, for Charlotte says: 'I have
received a general assurance that you do well and are
in good odour.'</p>

<p>It is now that the first signs of trouble and disquietude
begin to manifest themselves. Charlotte, as she
herself most truly says in this same letter of May 1 to
Branwell, 'grows exceedingly misanthropic and sour.'
She launches out into bitter diatribe against the Belgian
world:</p>

<blockquote><p>Amongst 120 persons which compose the daily population
of this house, I can discern only one or two who deserve
anything like regard. This is not owing to foolish fastidiousness
on my part, but to the absence of decent qualities
on theirs. They have not intellect or politeness or good
nature or good feeling. They are nothing. I don't hate
them&mdash;hatred would be too warm a feeling. But one wearies
from day to day of caring nothing, fearing nothing, liking
nothing, hating nothing, being nothing, doing nothing,&mdash;yes,
I teach and sometimes get red in the face with impatience at
their stupidity. But don't think I ever scold or fly into a
passion.... Nobody ever gets into a passion here. Such a
thing is not known. The phlegm that thickens their blood
is too gluey to boil. They are very false in their relations
with each other, but they rarely quarrel and friendship is a
folly they are unacquainted with.</p></blockquote>

<p>If this was not hate, it was surely a very fair imitation
of it; then follows a significant passage about M. Héger,
lately 'a delirious hyena,' and his wife, who had welcomed
Charlotte back with such kindness.</p>

<blockquote><p>The black swan, M. Héger, is the only sole veritable
exception to this rule (for Madame always cool and always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
reasoning is not quite an exception). But I rarely speak to
Monsieur now, for not being a pupil I have little or nothing
to do with him. From time to time he shows his kind-heartedness
by loading me with books, so that I am still
indebted to him for all the pleasure and amusement I have.</p></blockquote>

<p>Her bitter censoriousness of others, though now no
longer strangers, did not decrease. A month later she
wrote to Emily about the three teachers, Mdlles. Blanche,
Sophie, and Marie Haussé, whom previously Charlotte
regarded with comparative indifference. These ladies
appear to have had less gluey phlegm in their blood
than the rest; there is also a fresh sidelight on Madame
Héger:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mdlle Blanche and Mdlle Haussé are at present on a system
of war without quarter. They hate each other like two cats.
Mdlle Blanche frightens Mdlle Haussé by her white passions
(for they quarrel venomously). Mdlle Haussé complains
that when Mdlle Blanche is in fury, '<i>elle n'a pas de lèvres</i>.'
I find also that Mdlle Sophie dislikes Mdlle Blanche extremely.
She says she is heartless, insincere, and vindictive,
which epithets, I assure you, are richly deserved. Also I find
she is the regular spy of Mme Héger, to whom she reports
everything. Also she invents&mdash;which I should not have
thought. I have now the entire charge of the English
lessons. I have given two lessons to the first class. Hortense
Jannoy was a picture on these occasions, her face was
black as a 'blue-piled thunder-loft,' and her two ears were
red as raw beef. To all questions asked, her reply was '<i>Je
ne sais pas</i>.' It is a pity but her friends could meet with a
person qualified to cast out a devil. I am richly off for
companionship in these parts. Of late days, M. and Mme
Héger rarely speak to me, and I really don't pretend to care
a fig for anybody else in the establishment. You are not to
suppose by that expression that I am under the influence of
warm affection for Mme Héger. I am convinced she does
not like me,&mdash;why, I can't tell, nor do I think she herself has
any definite reason for the aversion; but for one thing,
she cannot comprehend why I do not make intimate friends
of Mesdames Blanche, Sophie, and Haussé. M. Héger is
wondrously influenced by Madame, and I should not wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
if he disapproves very much of my unamiable want of
sociability ... consequently he has in a great measure
withdrawn the light of his countenance.... Except for the
loss of M. Héger's good will (if I have lost it) I care for none
of them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now this is very bitter invective about her pupils
and her colleagues, and though Charlotte was at all times
censorious, such violence taken in conjunction with the
spyings of Madame and the coldness of Monsieur would
not unnaturally lead us to suppose a more intimate
agitation than any contempt of Belgian phlegm and furies
would warrant. It reminds us of bubbles coming up
through dark waters, and just beginning to prick the
surface; we seem to hear a clamour, almost hysterical,
designed half-subconsciously to overscore, even for
herself, disquieting whispers within. There is some
hidden agitation, some tumult in the heart of the city.</p>

<p>But at present she had no thought of putting an end
to the situation which was already beginning to wreck
her happiness and peace of mind. In June she wrote
a letter to her father, hoping that he and Emily were well:</p>

<blockquote><p>I am afraid she will have a good deal of hard work to do
now that Hannah [a servant at Haworth] is gone. I am
exceedingly glad that you will keep Tabby, besides she will
be company for Emily, who without her would be very
lonely.</p></blockquote>

<p>So Emily was left to do most of the housework and console
herself for her loneliness with the society of an old
servant of over seventy years of age, and Anne to continue
in her situation at Thorp Green, which she detested.
After that there is no further letter from Charlotte till
August 6, a few days before the summer vacation, when
the pupils would disperse and the Hégers leave Brussels
for a five weeks' holiday. She was miserably home-sick,
the prospect of being so much alone for all those weeks
appalled her, and it is impossible to find any reason, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
that Miss Branwell's legacy had put her in funds, why she
should not have gone back to Haworth for the holidays,
except that she foresaw difficulties in returning again to
Brussels when the vacation was over. 'I will continue
to stay (D.V.) some months longer,' she wrote, 'till
I have acquired German.'</p>

<p>She wrote to Emily again on September 2, when the
holidays were more than half over. Mlle. Blanche,
who was Mme. Héger's spy, had returned.</p>

<blockquote><p>But [writes Charlotte] I am always alone except at meal
times, for Mdlle Blanche's character is so false and so contemptible,
I can't force myself to associate with her. She
perceives my utter dislike, and never now speaks to me&mdash;a
great relief.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then follows this passage:</p>

<blockquote><p>... So I go out and traverse the Boulevards and streets
of Bruxelles sometimes for hours together. Yesterday I went
on a pilgrimage to the cemetery, and far beyond it to a hill
where there was nothing but fields as far as the horizon.
When I came back it was evening.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now Mrs. Gaskell clearly saw this letter for, though
she does not actually quote it, she describes Charlotte's
days during the holidays as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>She went out and with weary steps would traverse the
Boulevards and the streets sometimes for hours together....
Then up again ... anywhere but to the <i>pensionnat</i>&mdash;out to
the cemetery where Martha lay&mdash;out beyond it to the hills,
whence there is nothing to be seen but fields as far as the
horizon. The shades of evening made her retrace her footsteps.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>No coincidence can possibly account for the identity
of phrasing. Mrs. Gaskell's narrative shows that she
wrote this description with Charlotte's letter to Emily in
front of her. But the actual letter from which with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>a bewraying fidelity Mrs. Gaskell paraphrased this
paragraph, immediately proceeded to describe a very
astonishing adventure, which she decided to omit,
though it lay before her:</p>

<blockquote><p>I found myself opposite to Ste. Gudule, and the bell, whose
voice you know, began to toll for evening <i>salut</i>. I went in
quite alone (which procedure you will say is not much like
me), wandered about the aisles, where a few old women were
saying their prayers, till Vespers began. I stayed till they were
over. Still I could not leave the church or force myself to
go home&mdash;to school, I mean. An odd whim came into my
head. In a solitary part of the Cathedral, six or seven people
still remained kneeling by the confessionals. In two confessionals
I saw a priest. I felt as if I did not care what I did,
provided it was not absolutely wrong, and that it served to
vary my life and yield a moment's interest. I took a fancy
to change myself into a Catholic, and go and make a real
confession to see what it was like.... I approached at last,
and knelt down in a niche which was just vacated. I had to
kneel there ten minutes waiting, for on the other side was
another penitent invisible to me. At last that (one) went
away, and a little wooden door inside the grating opened, and
I saw the priest leaning his ear towards me. I was obliged to
begin, and yet I did not know a word of the formula with
which they commence their confessions.... I commenced
with saying I was a foreigner, and had been brought up a
Protestant. The priest asked if I was a Protestant then.
I somehow could not tell a lie, and said 'yes.' He replied
that in that case I could not '<i>jouir du bonheur de la confesse</i>,'
but I was determined to confess, and at last he said he would
allow me because it might be the first step towards returning
to the true church. I actually did confess&mdash;a real confession.
When I had done, he told me his address, and said that every
morning I was to go to the rue du Parc&mdash;to his house&mdash;and
he would reason with me and try to convince me of the error
and enormity of being a Protestant!!! I promised faithfully
to go. Of course, however, the adventure stops there,
and I hope I shall never see the priest again. I think you had
better not tell papa of this.</p></blockquote>

<p>That was certainly a wise precaution. Mr. Brontë<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>'s
adamantine Protestantism would not have looked upon
his daughter's going to a Catholic confessional as merely
an 'odd whim'; he would have called it by a much
harder name. So also at heart would she herself, for
she had already expressed her contempt of the Catholic
religion in abundantly emphatic terms; she had advised
any Protestant who felt in danger of changing his
faith to attend Mass and note the 'idiotic mercenary
aspect of all the priests,' and, so Mrs. Gaskell tells us,</p>

<blockquote><p>one of the reasons for the silent estrangement between Mme
Héger and Miss Brontë is to be found in the fact that the
English Protestant's dislike of Romanism increased with her
knowledge of it, and its effects upon those who professed it:
and when occasion called for an expression of opinion from
Charlotte Brontë she was uncompromising truth.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet in spite of her contempt for it, she now availed herself
of one of its Sacraments. It is true that she avowed
herself a Protestant, when kneeling in the Confessional,
but for the sake of the relief which confession would
bring her, she insisted on making it, and 'promised
faithfully' to go and receive instruction from the priest,
which promise, she states, she had not the slightest
intention of carrying out. Was this confession then,
so strangely made, merely an 'odd whim,' as she told
Emily, that 'should yield a moment's interest'? It is
impossible to believe that. She had something on her
mind which, in her lonely, nervous, hysterical state,
she must confide to somebody for the human relief
that the mere communication of it would bring. What
could it possibly have been that lay so heavily and
unhappily on her troubled soul? Something serious,
or she could never have had recourse to the benefits of
an institution which she so thoroughly despised. But
there must be no chance that this communication should
be betrayed, and it must be made under the seal of
confession. Knowing what we do now, after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
publication of Charlotte's subsequent love-letters to
M. Héger, we cannot doubt the nature of that confession.
All points to the desire, which her essential uprightness
of character abhorred, but which was terribly insistent
and made the absence of M. Héger on holiday so
intolerable.</p>

<p>Now Mrs. Gaskell having seen this letter (for she
quotes from it) omits the incident, for in <i>Villette</i>, which
minutely and accurately describes the <i>pensionnat</i> in the
Rue d'Isabelle, which portrays under the name of Paul
Emanuel the unmistakable lineaments of M. Héger,
and under the name of Madame Beck those of Madame
Héger, and her espionage, Lucy Snowe, though a
Protestant, makes a precisely similar confession to a
Roman Catholic priest, and no doubt it was better not
to let it be known that that incident was a piece of
authentic autobiography. It was discordant with
Charlotte's strongly expressed views about Catholicism,
and it was inconsistent with the reason Mrs. Gaskell had
given for the coolness between Charlotte and Madame
Héger. On all counts, then, it was wise to suppress the
confessional, and especially so because her readers might
conceivably begin to conjecture what heart's need drove
Charlotte to make use of the benefits of a religion
of which she was so contemptuous. It would have
been too truly directed a pointer to regions best left
unsuspected.</p>

<p>The Hégers returned during September, and the school
reassembled again for the new term. Charlotte had
determined (D.V.) to stop some months longer in order
to acquire German, but the situation was beginning to
break her, and early in October she wrote to Ellen:</p>

<blockquote><p>I felt as if I could bear it no longer, and I went to Mme
Héger and gave her notice. If it had depended on her, I
should certainly have been soon at liberty; but M. Héger,
having heard of what was in agitation, sent for me the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
after, and pronounced with vehemence his decision that I
should not leave. I could not, at that time, have persevered
in my intention without exciting him to passion, so I promised
to stay a little while longer....</p></blockquote>

<p>How Charlotte, miserable though she was, must have
adored his vehemence in forbidding her to go, and
secretly, in the way of a woman's heart, have whispered
to herself the interpretation which her reason told her
it could not bear! For M. Héger naturally did not
want to lose his English teacher at the beginning of
the term; he was thinking of the pupils learning English,
not of their instructor, and there is no more evidence
for supposing that he was ever in the slightest degree
in love with Charlotte than that Mr. Weightman had
been in love with Emily. But now at last Charlotte
began to suspect that Madame Héger had some inkling
of her secret, for writing to Ellen she hints at it:</p>

<blockquote><p>I have much to say&mdash;many odd little things, queer and
puzzling enough&mdash;but which one day perhaps or rather one
evening&mdash;if ever we should find ourselves by the fireside at
Haworth or at Brookroyd with our feet on the fender, curling
our hair&mdash;I may communicate to you.</p></blockquote>

<p>In her next letter she became more explicit as to what
these were: 'I fancy I begin to perceive the reason for
this (Mme. Héger's) mighty distance and reserve; it
sometimes makes me laugh and at other times nearly
cry.'</p>

<p>December came and once more Charlotte wrote to
Emily, saying that she had no thought of coming home
yet; she lacked a 'real pretext' for doing so. There
was indeed every reason why she should go home and
begin on her project of starting the school, for the sake
of which, and for the further education it would give her,
she had originally come to Brussels for a period of six
months. Now she had been here for nearly two years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
and still she could find no pretext to leave! She longed
to get away, she was wretched with this misbegotten
passion, but she could not endure to cut herself off
from the source of it. She saw vivid and minute, in
calenture, what was going on this Sunday morning in
the kitchen at the Parsonage:</p>

<blockquote><p>I should like even to be cutting up the hash with the clerk
and some register people at the other table, and you standing
by, watching that I put enough flour, not too much pepper,
and, above all, that I save the best piece of the leg of mutton
for Tiger and Keeper, the first of which personages would
be jumping about the dish and carving knife, and the latter
standing like a devouring flame on the kitchen floor. To
complete the picture, Tabby blowing the fire, in order to
boil the potatoes to a sort of vegetable glue! How divine
are these recollections to me at this moment!<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But she intended to remain in Brussels, still clinging
to the protestation that she must acquire more German,
and feeding her soul with the sweet torture that racked
her. Then, as was bound to happen, came the breaking
point. She suddenly wrote to Emily saying that she
had taken her determination and was coming home,
assigning no cause. M. Héger, we gather, was vexed
at her going, for subsequently she wrote to Ellen: 'I
suffered much before I left Brussels. I think, however
long I live, I shall not forget what the parting with
M. Héger cost me; it grieved me so much to grieve
him, who has been so true, kind and disinterested a
friend.' It was a tradition in the Héger family that on
parting with Mme. Héger she said '<i>Je me vengerai</i>'<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>; but
that is the kind of legend that may have arisen after
the publication of <i>Villette</i>.</p>

<p>She arrived at Haworth on January 2, 1844.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<p>Branwell and Anne were home for the Christmas
holidays, but presently went back to their situations as
tutor and governess to Mr. Robinson's children at
Thorp Green. Mrs. Gaskell says that 'agonizing suspicions'
about Branwell's conduct there had been one
of the causes why Charlotte returned from Brussels, but
it seems impossible that this was the case, for Charlotte
wrote to Ellen, after she got back to Haworth, to say
'that Branwell and Anne were both wondrously valued
in their situations.'<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Though she had longed to get
away from the daily renewal of the secret strain and
struggle of her life at Brussels, she found the quiet
of home, with her father and Emily as companions, unutterably
flat and objectless. 'Something in me,' she
wrote, 'which used to be enthusiasm is toned down and
broken. I have fewer illusions: what I wish for now
is active exertion.'</p>

<p>She took up again the scheme for starting a school
with her sisters. Thanks to Miss Branwell's legacies
there was now money enough. Emily's six months at
Brussels and her own year and three-quarters there had
greatly added to their qualifications, and M. Héger at
parting had given her a diploma certifying to her
abilities as a teacher, and attached to it was the seal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>of the Athénée Royal at Brussels where he was professor
in Latin. But once more the scheme must be changed,
for Mr. Brontë was growing old; he was threatened
with the loss of his sight, also he was disposed to drink
too much, and it was no longer feasible that they should
all leave him. Miss Wooler's proposal had been possible
while Miss Branwell was still alive, but not now. So
with her indomitable courage Charlotte settled to turn
the Parsonage into a school.</p>

<p>Before May she was seeking for pupils, and fixed the
terms at £25 per annum for board and English education,
subsequently raising them to £35. She made some personal
applications, but these led to nothing. Mr. White,
to whose children she had been governess, regretted
that his daughter was settled elsewhere; Colonel Stott
and Mr. Bousfeild were in the same predicament. As
soon as she could get the promise of only one pupil,
she proposed to issue a circular and begin making the
necessary alterations in the Parsonage.</p>

<p>About this time she had, as she wrote to M. Héger, an
offer of the post of head teacher in a girls' school at
Manchester at the salary of £100 a year; she refused that
because she had high hopes of this school at Haworth,
where she hoped to take five or six boarders. In July,
though she had not secured any pupils, she printed her
circular and sent it round 'to all the friends on whom
I have the slightest claim, and to some on whom I have
no claim.' She was sure she would succeed, for she
wrote to Ellen, saying: 'What an excellent thing
perseverance is for getting on in the world. Calm self-confidence
(not impudence, for that is vulgar and repulsive)
is an admirable quality.'</p>

<p>The circular ran as follows:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>Out went these circulars broadcast; Ellen had half
a dozen for distribution, but never an answer, beyond
sympathy and regrets, came to any single one of them.
The months went on, and in October Charlotte wrote to
her friend saying, 'Everyone wishes us well, but there
are no pupils to be had.' She had done everything
that careful thought and iron determination could accomplish.
She had qualified herself and Emily by pupilage
and teaching at Brussels, there was sufficient money,
Mr. Brontë had consented to the scheme, and all was
ready except the pupils, whom no effort of will or
circularisation would produce.</p>

<p>Whether her sisters had still any enthusiasm for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
idea is doubtful. Emily, in the private paper written on
her birthday of 1845 for the secret eyes of Anne, exhibits
none, making the following entry with regard to it:</p>

<blockquote><p>I should have mentioned that last summer (1844) the school
scheme was revived in full vigour. We had prospectuses
printed, despatched letters to all acquaintances, imparting
our plans and did our little all: but it was found no go.
Now I don't desire a school at all, and none of us have any
great longing for it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Anne, in her corresponding paper, was equally lukewarm.
She says:</p>

<blockquote><p>When the last paper (1841) was written we were thinking
of setting up a school. The scheme has been dropt, and
long after taken up again, and dropt again, because we could
not get pupils.</p></blockquote>

<p>From the first the initiative and driving-power had been
wholly Charlotte's, but now, in the autumn of 1844, she
gave it up, because in spite of all her efforts no pupils
would come. The abandonment of the school has, of
course, been laid at Branwell's door, and one notable
Brontë biographer asks: 'How could she (Charlotte)
receive children at Haworth with this drugged and
drunken wastrel in the house?'<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> But at the time when
it was finally abandoned Branwell was still in his situation
at Thorp Green, and was at home only for his holidays.
We hear no more about the school, for the sake of which
she and her sisters had taken abhorred situations as
governesses, and for which Emily had suffered a half-year's
misery at Brussels. Anne was still 'in the house
of bondage' at Thorp Green, where she remained till
the summer of 1845.</p>

<p>Charlotte's disappointment was bitter, but she drew,
on behalf of herself and her sisters, a moral lesson from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>it. 'They were not mortified at defeat. The effort
must be beneficial, whatever the result may be, because
it teaches us experience and an additional knowledge
of the world.' Now in spite of her efforts without ruth
to herself or them, the long-cherished idea for which
she had worked for years had failed, and she recognised
that it was hopeless. Never again did she attempt to
revive it, or indeed allude to it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Throughout this year, while the withered leaves of
her ambition for herself and her sisters dropped from
the tree, she had to bear, in addition to this disappointment,
a disquietude of which she could speak to none.
She had fallen in love with M. Héger, and she was writing
to him in terms that wring the heart of those who can
now read what she said in a few of these desolate and
longing letters. Sometimes he replied to them, but
usually she got no answer. The first of these letters
that is extant was dated July 24, 1844, at the time when
she was sending out her circulars for the school, but
there had been others before, as these extracts from it
show.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>I am well aware that it is not my turn to write to you....
I once wrote you a letter that was less than reasonable because
sorrow was at my heart: but I shall do so no more. I shall
try to be selfish no longer, and even while I look upon your
letters as one of the greatest felicities known to me, I shall
wait the receipt of them in patience.</p>

<p>I am firmly convinced that I shall see you again some day.
I know not how or when&mdash;but it must be for I wish it so
much....</p>

<p>I should not know this lethargy if I could write. Formerly
I spent whole days and weeks and months in writing, not
wholly without result, for Southey and Coleridge, two of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>best authors, to whom I sent certain MSS., were good enough
to express their approval. Were I to write much I should
become blind.... Otherwise I should write a book and
dedicate it to my literature master.... The career of letters
is closed to me,&mdash;only that of teaching is open....</p>

<p>Once more good-bye, Monsieur&mdash;it hurts to say good-bye
even in a letter. Oh, it is certain I shall see you again some
day: it must be so, for as soon as I have earned money enough
to go to Brussels I shall go there&mdash;and I shall see you again if
only for a moment!</p></blockquote>

<p>There are one or two curious points about this
letter. Charlotte was very short-sighted, but never did
she have nor was even threatened with such trouble
with her eyes as would prevent her from writing, and
we must put this wail that the career of literature was
closed to her <i>ad misericordiam</i>. Again, Southey had never
expressed approval of the poems she sent him; indeed,
his reply was such that Charlotte resolved to give up
writing altogether. Wordsworth had been equally discouraging
about the opening chapters of the novel she
sent him, and it was Branwell not she who wrote to
Hartley Coleridge for his verdict.</p>

<p>There was no answer returned to this letter; the next
is dated three months later, October 24, 1844. She now
took advantage of Mary Taylor's brother going to
Brussels, and entrusted him to deliver it. In it she
wrote: 'I would only ask of you if you heard from me
at the beginning of May and again in the month of
August,' Possibly she suspected that Madame had intercepted
these two other letters. Yet still M. Héger gave
no response, and once more she wrote to him on January 8,
1845:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Taylor has returned. I asked him if he had a letter
for me. 'No, nothing.' 'Patience,' said I, 'his sister will
be here soon.' Miss Taylor has returned. 'I have nothing
for you from M. Héger,' says she, 'neither letter nor message.'</p>

<p>Day and night I find neither rest nor peace. If I sleep I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
disturbed by tormenting dreams in which I see you always
stern, always grim and vexed with me.... You will tell
me perhaps: 'I take not the slightest interest in you, Mdlle
Charlotte. You are no longer an inmate of my house. I have
forgotten you.'</p>

<p>Well, Monsieur, tell me so frankly. It will be a shock to me.
It matters not. It would be less dreadful than uncertainty.</p></blockquote>

<p>The fourth letter that survives is dated 'Nov. 18,'
without indication of the year. But doubtless the year
was 1845, not 1844, for in this letter she says that her
father's blindness has so increased that he can neither
read nor write, and that in a few months' time he will
have an operation on his eyes. This operation took place
in the summer of 1846. She writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>I have tried to forget you, for the remembrance of a person
whom one thinks never to see again is too wearing to the
spirit, and when one has suffered that kind of anxiety for a
year or two one is ready to do anything to find peace once
more.</p>

<p>It is humiliating to be the slave of a fixed and dominant
idea which lords it over the mind!</p>

<p>For you to write will not be very interesting but for me
it is life. Your last letter was stay and prop to me for half
a year. When day by day I await a letter and when day
by day disappointment comes to fling me back into overwhelming
sorrow, and the sweet delight of seeing your
handwriting and reading your counsel eludes me like a
phantom vision, the fever takes me&mdash;I lose appetite and sleep
and pine away.</p></blockquote>

<p>These letters evoke our unstinted compassion and
sympathy with the writer. She had fallen in love with
this man many years her senior, who was a Catholic,
who had a wife and five children, and who had no interest
in her save as a queer though clever pupil, and no feeling
for her, as far as any evidence goes, except the <i>affection
presque paternelle</i>, of which he had assured her father.
They explain without need of any further comment the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
nature of the 'irresistible impulse' which took her back
for the second time to Brussels against the warnings of
her own conscience and common sense; they define the
'selfish folly' for which, as she wrote to Ellen, she was
'punished by a withdrawal for more than two years of
happiness and peace of mind.' She knew the insanity
of what she was doing, but she compounded with her
accusing conscience, telling herself, perhaps more than
half convincing herself, that she was going back to
Brussels not for that reason at all, but in order to fit
herself better, by a completer knowledge of French and
German, for the school which she was determined to start
with her sisters. Then there was M. Héger's letter to
her father: he had strongly urged her to return, and by
another year's work fulfil the remarkable progress she
had already made; surely it would be unwise to disregard
the advice of one so experienced. Such considerations
were weighty; it would be missing a chance
of future success not to act as she had done. But all the
time her conscience told her not to go. She had gone,
and at once the harvest which she had herself sown
began to ripen. Her affection for him grew into a
devotion and a surrender so abject, that when finally,
after long procrastinations, she returned home she could
not refrain from writing to him these love-letters, though
all the time she knew that Madame had long suspected
her feelings for him, and for months had spied on her.
That gives the measure of her passion, and she risked
anything sooner than not have the bitter consolation of
writing to him and the eager suspense of waiting month
by month for his rare replies. Once, knowing nothing
of what she was talking about, she had been profuse in
exhortations to Ellen, laying down with precision the
manner in which a girl should prudently and without
undue haste allow herself to fall in love with a man who
wanted her, bidding her remember the importance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
her keeping herself well in hand, and warning her of
the monstrous folly of a <i>grande passion</i>. Now she had
committed that monstrous folly in the most undesirable
manner; she had fallen hopelessly in love with a man
who felt nothing for her, and who could not possibly
marry her. Bitter was wisdom.</p>

<p>Then we must look at the affair from the point of
view of M. Héger and his wife. It was known to both
of them, while Charlotte was still at Brussels, that she
had formed this strong attachment to him, for from that
arose Monsieur's coldness and Madame's spyings, and
when these letters began to arrive it was necessary to act
with circumspection. A girl who wrote in such a strain
to the respectable father of a family might do something
more embarrassing yet; indeed, she had threatened
in one of them to visit Brussels again and see him.
M. Héger behaved very properly. He did not always
answer Charlotte's letters, but, when he did, he employed
his wife as his amanuensis; this was no rare thing, for
he much disliked writing himself. It was wise and
prudent that she should know how he replied, and his
answers, written by her, had thus passed the conjugal
censorship. What these replies were is unknown, for
either Charlotte destroyed them or her husband did so
after her death, but we shall find reasons for feeling sure
that they were careful and circumspect. M. Héger did
not read to his wife Charlotte's letters to him, but tore
them up and threw the pieces into the waste-paper
basket. One he did not destroy, for he had noted on
the back of it the address of a Brussels bootmaker.
Then, we assume, he imagined he had lost it, and thought
no more of it. That was M. Héger's share in the matter;
Madame had a policy of her own, which was disclosed
many years later.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Such was the superficial history of this correspondence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
and there, as far as M. Héger was aware, the matter
stayed till after Charlotte's death. But the inner and
subsequent history of these four letters of Charlotte's
which survived and which are now in the British Museum
is so interesting and extraordinary that, though the
story of them lies outside the immediate sphere of the
affairs of the Brontës, it must be followed up, as revealed
by Mr. Marion H. Spielmann,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> who obtained it from
M. Héger's daughter, Mdlle. Louise Héger. An old
lady of over seventy years of age when these letters were
published in 1913, she was a girl of six when Charlotte
left her mother's <i>pensionnat</i>. She remembered her quite
well, 'a little person, extremely narrow of chest, with
side-curls, large eyes (but not so large as in her portrait)
and sadly defective teeth&mdash;somewhat ill-favoured indeed,
and unattractive to look upon&mdash;and yet beloved by her.'
The following is the account that Mdlle. Héger gave to
Mr. Spielmann.</p>

<p>Madame Héger had looked upon Charlotte when she
was at Brussels as a highly excitable, nervous girl, whom
she did not at all understand. Her farewell words
when she left, <i>Je me vengerai</i>, were not pleasant, and
perhaps portended trouble; it was as well to bear them
in mind. Then her letters began to arrive; her husband
(as we have seen) tore them up after reading them,
threw them into the waste-paper basket, and dictated his
replies to his wife. One (the first of those that survive)
he did not tear up, and his wife read it and kept it.
Having found out in what terms Charlotte was writing
to him, she felt that her general apprehensions as to what
a hysterical girl like this might do were justified, and
when other letters came and he tore them up, she rescued
them from the waste-paper basket whenever she had the
opportunity, pieced them together and kept them also.
They confirmed what she had always thought, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>case there was trouble with Charlotte, it would be
useful to have them. At least one of them, moreover,
had been addressed to her husband, not at the <i>pensionnat</i>
in the Rue d'Isabelle, but at the Athénée Royal, where
he held a Latin class for boys.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Then in course of time the
letters ceased, for after two years Charlotte wrote no
more, and as far as M. Héger then knew, no letter of hers
to him was in existence, for he had put them into the
waste-paper basket.</p>

<p>Over twenty years later, when the Brontës had become
famous, there was a lecture delivered at Brussels by a
literary Frenchman on the subject of 'The Brontës.'
Mdlle. Louise Héger attended it, and was horrified to
hear her father and mother held up to the execration of
the audience for their cruelty and barbarity to the two
sisters when at Brussels; the lecturer illustrated his
remarks by quotations from <i>Villette</i>. She told her
mother on her return home what had been said, and
in answer Mme. Héger took her to her room, opened
her jewel-case, and showed her the four letters of
Charlotte to her father which she had pieced together
and kept, bidding her read them. The devotion they
showed towards him adequately disposed of the idea
that he had treated her with barbarity, and shed an
entirely new light on the situation. Mdlle. Louise understood,
and the letters were then replaced in their <i>cache</i>.</p>

<p>Madame Héger died in 1889, leaving to Louise her
jewel-case and its contents, among which were the letters.
She took them to her father, who was engaged in going
through and destroying papers of his wife's. He recognised
them, and, astonished and ill-pleased to know that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>they were still in existence, threw them once more into
the waste-paper basket. Louise thought that her father
was not in the mood to give careful consideration to
the fate of these letters which her mother had been at
pains to preserve for so long; they should not be
destroyed without due reflection, and presently, when
her father had left the room, she did exactly as her
mother had done forty-five years before, took them
out of the waste-paper basket, and again kept them.
Thus though M. Héger, when they were eventually
published, was roundly abused (especially by those who
had so conclusively proved that Charlotte was never in
love with him) for having kept them at all, it turns out
that, as far as his intention was concerned, he had twice
destroyed them. Mdlle. Louise then consulted a French
friend on the wisdom of keeping the letters. He strongly
recommended her to do so, since they were now of the
highest literary interest. After her father's death she
showed them to her brother, Professor Paul Héger, and
eventually a family council was held as to what should
be done with them. One member of it maintained that
such fervour of expression pointed to guilty intercourse
between M. Héger and Charlotte, and it is certainly
possible that this construction might be put upon them
by those who did not know the circumstances. But
neither Professor Héger nor his sister, to whom the
letters belonged, wished to destroy them, and in 1913
they brought them to England to consult Mr. Marion
Spielmann, whose judgment they trusted, about their fate.
On his advice they consented to the publication, and
presented the letters themselves to the British Museum.</p>

</div>

<p>Mdlle. Louise Héger's narrative, as here abridged, is
obviously trustworthy; she alone knew the history of
the letters, and there is no reason to suspect that it is
other than completely reliable, and we can accept it
without reservations. But there is one point which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>may already have struck the reader and which requires
examination. It is this.</p>

<p>Mdlle. Louise was not the only person who read these
letters during their incarceration in her mother's jewel-case.
Mrs. Gaskell read them also, for in her <i>Life of
Charlotte Brontë</i> she quotes verbatim from three of
them, piecing together paragraphs of two of them, and
giving a few sentences from a third.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Nothing that she
quotes gives the faintest hint of their essential contents,
there is not a word that a girl might not with the utmost
propriety have written to her master; Charlotte thanks
him for his kindness to her, she sends messages to Madame
and the children. But Mrs. Gaskell certainly read the
letters, and since they had remained in Brussels from the
time when they were written and posted at Haworth till
they were brought to England in 1913, she must therefore
have seen them when she went to Brussels in 1856 to
collect materials and <i>mise en scène</i> concerning Charlotte's
life at the <i>pensionnat</i>. But they were then, according to
Mdlle. Louise's account, reposing in her mother's jewel-case,
having been rescued by her from the waste-paper
basket where M. Héger had thrown them, and pieced
together. Who, then, showed them to Mrs. Gaskell?
Not Madame Héger, for, knowing that she was a friend
of Charlotte's, she refused to see her. It has always been
supposed that it was the delineation of herself in
<i>Villette</i> that led to this refusal, but the French translation
of the book (Mme. Héger knew no English) had
only just appeared, and it is a pure assumption to suppose
that Mme. Héger had read it.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> But she had read
Charlotte's letters to her husband, and she had no need
to seek further for a reason for not consenting to see
Mrs. Gaskell. In any case she did not, and, since she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>is ruled out, the only person who could have shown
Mrs. Gaskell the letters was M. Héger himself. She had
an interview with him; she liked and respected him, and
they talked about his correspondence with Charlotte,
for M. Héger begged her to read his letters to her;
he felt sure she would have kept them, and they contained
'advice about her character, studies, mode of life.'<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
M. Héger in fact, it becomes plain, showed Mrs. Gaskell
Charlotte's letters (from which she made judicious
extracts) and was anxious that she should see how properly
he answered them. I therefore venture to suggest&mdash;it
is a theory only, but one that solves our difficulty&mdash;that
Mme. Héger's reason for not seeing Mrs. Gaskell was
Charlotte's letters, and that she said, in effect, to her
husband: 'Show them to Mrs. Gaskell and she will
understand why I won't see her.' Out came the letters
from the jewel-case, and, Mrs. Gaskell having read them
they were returned there again.... This conjecture
does not, however, invalidate the general credibility of
Mdlle. Louise's narrative to Mr. Spielmann. M. Héger
knew that in 1856 his wife was still keeping the letters,
but it is no wonder that on her death thirty-three years
later it was a matter of surprise to him that they were
still in existence. Probably he had forgotten all about
them.</p>

<p>It remains to consider Mrs. Gaskell's decision to omit
from her <i>Life of Charlotte Brontë</i> the whole story of
her having fallen in love with M. Héger, of her having
written those letters which so indubitably prove it, and
to exclude from her book any incident, any hint that
might, in her opinion, have given rise to conjecture.
It was an important decision, for she was the official
biographer, and she must have thought that her book,
a model of apparently exhaustive research, would
probably remain for all time the final work on the family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>in general, and on Charlotte in particular, for so ample
a <i>Life</i> would surely be definitive. But she must also
have known that she was omitting not only the most
profound emotional experience of her heroine herself, but
one out of which sprang her best and noblest work,
for there can be no doubt that without it <i>Villette</i>
would never have been written. Nothing more important
psychically or mentally ever happened to her, and
Mrs. Gaskell, knowing all, decided to say nothing about
it, and remove all traces of it. Nothing in her book
suggests the possibility of such an entanglement; she
even invents a reason for Mme. Héger's coldness to
Charlotte. Some biographers, no doubt, if this decision
had been presented to them, would have abandoned
their work altogether, sooner than falsify its essential
truth by such an omission; Mrs. Gaskell thought otherwise,
and having formed her loyal and admiring conception
of the figure she wished to present, scrapped
(with or without compunction) what she knew was of
first-rate importance for a faithful portrait.</p>

<p>But there is another side to the question. The disclosure
which M. Héger made to her of Charlotte's
letters not only must have been a great shock to her
(so great that she could not biographically deal with it
at all), but would be equally or more shocking to
Charlotte's father and to her widower, at whose instance
she had undertaken the work. They knew nothing, so
far as we know, of the whole Héger episode, or, at the
most, they had read the extremely proper answers which
M. Héger had returned, in the handwriting of his wife,
to the letters which Mrs. Gaskell alone had seen. She
was full of enthusiasm for her task; she knew, rightly,
that it was in her power to make a charming picture of
the woman whose work she so admired, and for whom
she had so genuine an affection. Though she did
publish gossipy stories about Mr. Brontë which, owing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
to his justifiable indignation she was obliged to withdraw,
it was quite another thing to publish far more
serious matter which she was perfectly able to substantiate.
It was better to say nothing at all about it,
to delete anything that might point to it, to invent
reasons why Mme. Héger disliked and distrusted Charlotte,
to account for her unhappiness at Brussels by the
supposition that Branwell was causing grave anxiety&mdash;to
do anything and everything in order to conceal what
she imagined would never be disclosed. The odds in
her favour were enormous, but the hundred-to-one
chance went against her, and to us to-day Charlotte
Brontë is a vastly more human and interesting figure
than she ever could have been if it had not.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<p>For a year and a half after Charlotte's final return from
Brussels, she and Emily were alone with their father at
the Parsonage, Branwell and Anne coming there only
for their holidays from Thorp Green. Her letters
during this period are few, and they all betoken the deep
disquiet and depression and the bitterness of heart that
were growing on her. Indeed, the lights were turned
very low: her literary ambitions for the time were
dead (or, as she wrote to M. Héger, her failing eyesight
made it impossible for her to write), not a line of a poem
nor a page of prose seems to have been written by her
during this period; her friend Mary Taylor, despairing
of occupation for an energetic young woman in England,
went out to New Zealand; Branwell, though still giving
satisfaction in his situation, was making trouble at home,
and though Charlotte says nothing definite we may
assume that he was drinking. 'He has been more than
ordinarily tiresome and annoying of late; he leads Papa
a wretched life,' is one of her comments on the conduct
of him with whom she had once been the most intimate
ally. She had come home from Brussels admirably
equipped, a competent scholar in French and German,
but no pupil sought to learn of her; she had obtained
a certificate with the seal of the Athénée Royal at Brussels,
bearing witness to her efficiency as a teacher, and
Constantin Héger had signed it, but his name there
served only to sharpen her heart's hunger. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
begged for the crumbs that fell from his table to assuage
it, but all she got was letters in the handwriting of his
wife, advising her about her studies and her mode of life.
Activity, some scheme, some ambition, over which she
could employ the self-poisoned energies of her soul, was
what she longed for; but the scheme that had occupied
her for years was derelict, her ambitions were dead, and
her heart emptily aching. There was only bitterness to
look back on, and a blank to look forward to.</p>

<p>It is true that she had Emily with her, but in spite
of the oft-reiterated statement that there was a bond of
passionate devotion between the two sisters, we search
in vain for any expression of it during Emily's lifetime.
Once, when Charlotte was governess at Mrs. Sidgwick's,
she wrote a letter to her sister beginning, 'Mine bonnie
love,' but otherwise, until Emily's short and final illness,
we can find no token in Charlotte's letters of the affection,
nor yet of the love that involuntarily betrays itself. As
Emily's and Anne's quadrennial papers show, it was they
who were the united couple, and before now estranging
circumstances had occurred between the other two.
Emily who, as Charlotte knew, was wretched away from
Haworth, had been taken to Brussels, where had it not
been for Miss Branwell's death she would have remained
for six months more; she had been desperately unhappy
there, and the only allusions Charlotte had made to her
was that she and M. Héger did not 'draw well together,'
and that subsequently the Hégers began to recognise 'her
good points below her singularities.' Then Charlotte
had gone back to Brussels alone, and hearing of the
burden of household work that lay on Emily's shoulders,
had hoped that her father would soon get another
servant. Emily was lonely, and she was glad that old
Tabby had returned to the Parsonage&mdash;she would be
a companion for her sister; but it did not occur to her
to go back herself. Nor, on Emily's side, is there the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
slightest expression of affection for Charlotte: she
hoped that Ellen might manage to go out to Brussels,
otherwise Charlotte might stop on there all the days of
Methuselah sooner than face the crossing. Emily, no
doubt, was intensely reserved, and not even to Anne
did she show her secret life, but to Charlotte she showed
nothing at all. If she ever had any deep affection for
her, it was so completely concealed that not even when
the shadow of death was on her did she reach out a hand
to her. At present, and indeed up to the end, before
which further cause for estrangement had occurred,
Emily's attitude towards Charlotte was one of resentful
indifference. Such are the only conclusions we can
draw from their meagre references to each other.</p>

<p>Throughout this year and a half there is no sign that
Emily's companionship was any consolation for the
deadness of Charlotte's whole life. They walked on the
moors together, they sewed shirts, the little cat died and
Emily was sorry. But otherwise, as Charlotte wrote
to her friend towards the end of this period:</p>

<blockquote><p>I can hardly tell you how time gets on at Haworth.
There is no event whatever to mark its progress. One day
resembles another, and all have heavy, lifeless physiognomies.
Sunday, baking day, and Saturday, are the only
ones that have any distinctive mark. Meantime life wears
away. I shall soon be thirty, and I have done nothing yet.
Sometimes I get melancholy at the prospect before and
behind me. Yet it is wrong and foolish to repine. Undoubtedly
my duty directs me to stay at home for the present.
There was a time when Haworth was a very pleasant place to
me; it is not so now. I feel as if we are all buried here.
I long to travel, to work, to lead a life of action.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was now that Charlotte began to take notice, for
future use in <i>Shirley</i>, of the famous curates. Including
Mr. A. B. Nicholls, of whom she eventually became the
devoted wife, there were four of them, though only
two were Mr. Brontë's curates, and she viewed them all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
with the most unfavourable eye, very different from that
with which she had observed that arch-flirt William
Weightman, whose susceptibility had supplied such
thrilling interest to her and Ellen. He had died while
Charlotte was spending her first year with Emily
at Brussels, and his successor was James William Smith,
who appears in <i>Shirley</i> as Peter Augustus Malone.
She at first suspected him, as she had suspected
Mr. Weightman, of having matrimonial designs on
Ellen, and she alludes to him as the Rev. Lothario Smith.
He had said in reference to Ellen: 'Yes, she is a nice
girl&mdash;rather quiet; I suppose she has money.' Charlotte
thought these words spoke volumes&mdash;'they do not
prejudice me in favour of Mr. Smith.' Mr. Brontë
shared these misgivings: they both thought 'that
Mr. Smith is a very fickle man, that if he marries he will
soon get tired of his wife, and consider her as a burden,
also that money will be a principal consideration with
him in marrying.' He went for a six weeks' holiday to
Ireland: 'Nobody regrets him, because nobody could
attach themselves to one who could attach himself to
nobody.... Yet the man is not without points that
will be most useful to him in getting through life. His
good qualities, however, are all of the selfish order.'
While he was gone Joseph Brett Grant (Mr. Donne of
<i>Shirley</i>), master of the Haworth Grammar School,
took his duty for the time, and 'filled his shoes decently
enough&mdash;but one cares naught about these sort of individuals,
so drop them.' Then Mr. Smith left Haworth,
took a curacy at Keighley, four miles off, and was succeeded
by A. B. Nicholls (Mr. Macarthey of <i>Shirley</i>).
A respectable young man: Charlotte hoped he would
give satisfaction. But those hopes were disappointed,
for six months afterwards she wrote to Ellen, saying:
'I cannot for my life see those interesting germs of
goodness in him you discovered, his narrowness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
mind strikes me chiefly. I fear he is indebted to your
imagination for the hidden treasure.' Nor did he rise
at all in her esteem, for in 1846, in answer to some sort
of badinage on Ellen's part with regard to a rumour
that Charlotte might be going to marry him, she told
her that there was nothing but a 'cold, far away sort of
civility between them,' and that he and 'all the other
curates are highly uninteresting, narrow and unattractive
members of the coarser sex.' As for his parochial
efficiency, we learn that when he went to Ireland on
a holiday 'many of the parishioners express a desire
that he should not trouble himself to recross the Channel.
This is not the feeling that ought to exist between
shepherd and flock.'</p>

<p>The fourth, James Chesterton Bradley (figuring in
<i>Shirley</i> as David Sweeting), was curate at Oakworth,
a hamlet not more than a mile from Haworth. Three
of them thus lived close to the Parsonage, and, so
Charlotte writes to Ellen, 'God knows there is not one
to mend another': curates seemed to her 'a self-seeking,
vain, empty race.' Indeed, they were a sore trial.</p>

<blockquote><p>The other day [we read] they all three accompanied by
Mr. Smidt<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> (of whom by the way I have grievous things to
tell you) dropped or rather rushed in unexpectedly to tea.
It was Monday (baking day) and I was hot and tired, still, if
they had behaved quietly and decently I would have served
them out their tea in peace, but they began glorifying themselves
and abusing Dissenters in such a manner that my
temper lost its balance, and I pronounced a few sentences
sharply and rapidly, which struck them all dumb. Papa
was greatly horrified also. I don't regret it....</p></blockquote>

<p>A rather dreadful little scene; she was hot and irritated,
and having lost her temper and shocked her father, felt
that she had nothing to blame herself with. But she was
saving up these experiences of the empty-headed race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>All contacts chafed her: she went to stay with her
friends the Taylors at Hunsworth, and during the visit
she suffered from headache and listlessness of spirits,
and was sure that everyone except perhaps Mary was
glad when she departed. She found that Mary's brother
had sadly deteriorated. Eight years ago she would
have been '<i>indignant</i>' if anyone had accused him of
'being a worshipper of mammon,' now she laughed at
her vanished illusion about him.</p>

<blockquote><p>The world with its hardness and selfishness has utterly
changed him. He thinks himself wiser than the wisest ...
his feelings have gone through a process of petrification which
will prevent them from ever warring against his interest,
but Ichabod! all glory of principle and much elevation of
character is gone!</p></blockquote>

<p>This bleak censoriousness of others was coupled with
utter pessimism regarding the future and the past,
and she did not believe that the world held happiness in
store for anyone. She looked on people and prospects
alike from the standpoint of her own hopelessness of
anticipation, and miserably regretted that 'irresistible
impulse' out of which had come those abject and yearning
letters she wrote to Brussels and the sickness of
deferred hope with which she awaited the coming of the
barren post-hour.</p>

<p>The summer of 1845 arrived. In June Anne left her
situation at Thorp Green for good, after being there for
four and a half years, and went off with Emily for a
jaunt to York: these were the only two nights that
Emily spent away from Haworth from the time of her
return from Brussels in 1842 until her death. They
played at Gondals all the time, and Emily in her secret
paper of July records how they impersonated Ronald
Macalgin, Henry Angora, Julia Augusteena, and many
other mystical folk 'escaping from the palaces of
instruction to join the Royalists who are hard driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
at present by the victorious Republicans.' She was
writing a work on the First Gondal War, and Anne
a book under the name of 'Henry Sophona.' Anne,
though not quite so enthusiastic (for she found the
Gondals were not 'in first-rate playing condition'),
records that: 'The Unique Society, about half a year
ago, were wrecked on a desert island as they were returning
from Gaul.' She mentions also that Emily was
writing poetry, and wondered what it was about.
Branwell had come home for the holidays with Anne,
while Mr. and Mrs. Robinson and the family went to
Scarborough, and, as at present arranged, he would return
to his post when the holidays were over. Charlotte,
when her sisters had got back to Haworth, went off for
a three weeks' visit to her friend Ellen at Hathersage.
She found when she returned that the curtain had
already risen on a drama which is surely among the
grimmest of domestic chronicles.</p>

<p>She wrote next day to Ellen:</p>

<blockquote><p>It was ten o'clock at night when I got home. I found
Branwell ill: he is so very often owing to his own fault.
I was not therefore shocked at first, but when Anne informed
me of the immediate cause of his present illness, I was greatly
shocked. He had last Thursday received a note from Mr.
Robinson sternly dismissing him, intimating that he had
discovered his proceedings, which he characterized as bad
beyond expression, and charging him on pain of exposure to
break off instantly and for ever all communication with every
member of his family. We have had sad work with Branwell
ever since. He thought of nothing but stunning or drowning
his distress of mind. No one in the house could have rest.
At last we have been obliged to send him from home with
someone to look after him: he has written to me this morning,
and expresses some sense of contrition for his frantic folly;
he promises amendment on his return,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> but so long as he
remains at home, I scarce dare hope for peace in the house.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>Now Mrs. Gaskell, in the first edition of her <i>Life
of Charlotte Brontë</i>, makes narrative of the above letter,
and defines the reason for Branwell's dismissal. He
had been dismissed by his employer because of his guilty
intrigue with his wife. Her account ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>All the disgraceful incidents came out. Branwell was in
no state to conceal his agony of remorse, or, strange to say,
his agony of guilty love, from any dread of shame. He
gave passionate way to his feelings, he shocked and distressed
those loving sisters inexpressibly: the blind father sat
stunned, sorely tempted to curse the profligate woman who
had tempted his boy&mdash;his only son&mdash;into the deep disgrace of
deadly crime.</p>

<p>All the variations of spirits and of temper&mdash;the reckless
gaiety, the moping gloom of many months were now
explained. There was a reason deeper than any mean
indulgence of appetite to account for his intemperance; he
began his career as an habitual drunkard to drown remorse.</p>

<p>The pitiable part, as far as he was concerned, was the
yearning love he still bore to the woman who had got so
strong a hold upon him. It is true that she professed equal
love; we shall see how her profession held good. There
was a strange lingering of conscience, when meeting her
clandestinely by appointment at Harrogate some months
afterwards, he refused to consent to the elopement which
she proposed: there was some good left in this corrupted,
weak young man, even to the very last of his miserable days....
A few months later (I have the exact date but for obvious
reasons withhold it) the invalid husband of the woman with
whom he had intrigued, died. Branwell had been looking
forward to this event with guilty hopes. After her husband's
death, his paramour would be free. Strange as it seems the
young man still loved her passionately, and now he imagined
the time was come when they might look forward to being
married, and might live together without reproach or blame.
She had offered to elope with him; she had written to him
perpetually, she had sent him money&mdash;twenty pounds at a
time&mdash;she had braved shame and her children's menaced
disclosures for his sake, he thought she must love him: he
little knew how bad a depraved woman can be. Her husband
had made a will, in which what property he left her was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
bequeathed solely on the condition that she should never see
Branwell Brontë again. At the very time that the will was
read, she did not know but that he might be on his way to
her, having heard of her husband's death. She despatched a
servant in hot haste to Haworth. He stopped at the 'Black
Bull' and a messenger was sent up to the Parsonage for
Branwell. He came down to the little inn and was shut up
with the man for some time. Then the groom came out,
paid his bill, mounted his horse and was off. Branwell
remained in the room alone. More than an hour elapsed
before sign or sound was heard; then those outside heard a
noise like the bleating of a calf, and, on opening the door,
he was found in a kind of fit, succeeding to the stupor of
grief which he had fallen into on hearing that he was forbidden
by his paramour ever to see her again, as, if he did,
she would forfeit her fortune. Let her live and flourish! He
died, his pockets filled with her letters, which he had carried
about his person, in order that he might read them as often
as he wished.... When I think of him, I change my cry
to heaven. Let her live and repent!<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As soon as this was brought to Mrs. Robinson's
notice, she determined to sue Mrs. Gaskell for libel, but
consented not to do so if these passages and all other
reference to her were omitted from future editions, and
a public apology and retraction of them was made. This
appeared in the advertisement pages of the <i>Times</i> of
May 26, 1857, in the form of a letter from Mrs. Gaskell's
solicitors to Mrs. Robinson's:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;As solicitor for and on behalf of the Rev.
W. Gaskell, and of Mrs. Gaskell his wife, the latter of whom
is authoress of the <i>Life of Charlotte Brontë</i>, I am instructed
to retract every statement contained in that work which
imputes to a widowed Lady, referred to but not named
therein, any breach of her conjugal, of her maternal, or of her
social duties, and more especially of the statement ...
which imputes to the lady in question a guilty intercourse
with the late Branwell Brontë. All those statements were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>made upon information believed to be well founded, but
which, upon investigation, with the additional evidence
furnished to me by you, I have ascertained not to be trustworthy.
I am therefore authorized not only to retract the
statements in question, but to express the deep regret of
Mrs. Gaskell that she should have been led to make them.</p>

<p class="quotsig">
I am, dear Sirs, yours truly,<br>
<span class="smcap">William Shaen</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There followed on this apology some exceedingly
pungent remarks in the <i>Athenæum</i>, which had previously
spoke in high praise of Mrs. Gaskell's book, on the
wantonness of publishing 'a gratuitous tale so dismal
as concerns the dead, so damaging to the living, unless
it was severely, strictly true.' Even then, the writer
might have added, such sacerdotal comminations are
as ludicrous as they are irrelevant to the story of Charlotte
Brontë's life.</p>

<p>Now there is always a possibility that an author may
be wise to withdraw libellous matter from his book with
apologies, not because it is not true, but because he is
unable to substantiate the truth of it, and will thus
inevitably lose his case if an action is brought against
him. But before we attempt to ascertain whether such
was the case with Mrs. Gaskell, with regard to the main
libellous matter, we must look into the rest of her story
by way of test. We find it bristles with inconsistencies
and inaccuracies. She states, for instance, that
Mr. Robinson by his will bequeathed his property to
his widow solely on the condition that she should never
see Branwell again. Now Mr. Robinson died in May
1846, eleven years before Mrs. Gaskell's book appeared,
and his will was proved in September of the same year.
An inspection of it, or a copy of it, would have
shown her that it contained no such condition, and that
Branwell's name does not appear in it at all. Mrs.
Robinson, therefore, would have been free to marry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
him had she wished to do so, without pecuniary loss,
other than that consequent on her marrying again
at all. Again, there is the story that Mrs. Robinson
sent her groom to Haworth to see Branwell and
acquaint him with this provision; the result of the interview
was that Branwell was found in a fit, bleating like
a calf. But apart from the fact that no one but a demented
woman would have sent a groom to talk over
affairs with her lover, and tell him he must never see his
paramour again, Mrs. Robinson could have sent no such
message, since the will did not contain any such provision.
Again, the supposed meeting of Branwell and Mrs.
Robinson at Harrogate and her proposal to him to elope
(which, if he had accepted it, would quite assuredly have
deprived her of her inheritance) are utterly inconsistent
with her refusal to see him after her husband's death,
when she was at liberty to marry him. As for the story
that on Branwell's death his pockets were found to be full
of Mrs. Robinson's letters, we can only conclude that this
was derived from some such source as that which gave
Mrs. Gaskell so many details about Mr. Brontë's violent
habits; and it was contradicted by the Parsonage servant,
Martha Brown, who was in the room when Branwell
died; there were no such letters. In the face of such
glaring inconsistencies, it looks at first sight as if the
whole of Mrs. Gaskell's account was a farrago of
unverified gossip.</p>

<p>But looking closer, we must acquit Mrs. Gaskell of
any very culpable carelessness in compiling an account
which, though far better omitted altogether, was evidently
derived from Charlotte herself, and by Charlotte
from Branwell. He was making no secret, when she
returned from her visit to Ellen in July 1845, of the
cause of his dismissal, he was drinking and crying out
on fate with the unmanliest lamentation, and we can
infer for certain what he told his sisters from a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
he wrote three months afterwards to his friend Francis
H. Grundy:</p>

<blockquote><p>This lady (Mrs. Robinson), though her husband detested
me, showed me a degree of kindness which, when I was
deeply grieved one day at her husband's conduct, ripened
into declarations of more than ordinary feeling. My admiration
of her mental and personal attractions, my knowledge
of her unselfish sincerity, her sweet temper, and unwearied
care for others, with but unrequited return where most
should have been given ... although she is seventeen years
my senior, all combined to an attachment on my part, and led
to reciprocations which I had little looked for. During
nearly three years I had daily 'troubled pleasure, soon chastised
by fear.'<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A shabbier avowal of all that a man is usually silent
about (especially if there is truth in what he says) can
scarcely be conceived, and clearly this was the version
which Branwell gave his sisters, and which Charlotte
passed on to Mrs. Gaskell when subsequently they met
and became friends. Branwell, too, was the author of
the fiction about Mr. Robinson's will, for he wrote to
his friend Grundy in a letter for which the contents
supply the date:</p>

<blockquote><p>The gentleman with whom I have been is dead.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> His
property is left in trust for the family, provided I do not see
the widow; and if I do, it reverts to the executing trustees
with ruin to her.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>What he thus wrote it is reasonable to suppose he
raved about to his sisters, and in this particular we have
the connecting-link between him and Mrs. Gaskell's
narrative in the shape of a letter that Charlotte wrote
to Ellen in the month following Mr. Robinson's death:</p>

<blockquote><p>Shortly after came news from all hands that Mr. Robinson
had altered his will before he died, and effectually prevented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>all chance of a marriage between his widow and Branwell,
by stipulating that she should not have a shilling of it if she
ever ventured to reopen any communication with him....</p></blockquote>

<p>Whatever 'we hear from all hands' means, it is clear
enough from Branwell's letter to his friend that one of
these hands was his, and can infer with sufficient completeness
that Charlotte supplied the information upon
which Mrs. Gaskell's account was founded, and that this
in turn rested entirely on Branwell's allegations and tipsy
maunderings. He made of himself a stricken and bawling
martyr to the cruel fate which parted impassioned
lovers by the obstacle of a selfish and unsympathetic
husband, and when that obstacle was removed and it
was clear that his mistress (if she had ever been his
mistress) had no intention of marrying him, he invented
the story of the will, adding to it that she was distracted
by these sorrows and anxieties to the verge of insanity.
But as she married Sir Edward Scott three years later,
as soon as the death of his wife in 1848 left him free, we
must suppose that she had her sane intervals. All that
actually remains of the whole story is that Branwell was
summarily dismissed from his tutorship by Mr. Robinson
on account of some improper behaviour, and the
reasonable conclusion is that he had made love to his
wife, who very properly had told her husband. All the
rest is directly traceable to Branwell's unsupported
assertions, for which no tittle of evidence could be found.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Charlotte, then, on her return to Haworth to find
Branwell drinking heavily and bemoaning his stricken
existence, took the same hopeless view of him as she
took just now of everything. He was in such a state,
she wrote, that it was necessary that he should leave
home for a week with someone to look after him; the
choice of this attendant was a strange one, for he was
Branwell's boon companion, John Brown, the 'Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Knave of Trumps,' and President of the 'Lodge of the
Three Graces,' which met at the 'Black Bull' to drink
whisky and discuss women. While he was gone
Emily's birthday came round, and as usual she and Anne
wrote their secret papers for each other, to be opened
(on this occasion after three years) on July 30, 1848.
In contrast with Charlotte's pessimistic outlook Emily,
though Branwell's disgrace was so recent, appeared to be
in exceedingly good spirits. She gives a short <i>résumé</i> of
events, barely mentioning Charlotte, and a long account
of her expedition with Anne and the doings of the
Gondals. She says that in spite of all efforts the idea of
the sisters keeping a school was 'no go,' and that she,
personally, did not want it at all, thereby emphasising
that it was Charlotte's scheme all along; she says that
the family were all well, but for Mr. Brontë's trouble
with his eyes, and for Branwell,</p>

<blockquote><p>who I hope will be better and do better hereafter. I am
quite contented for myself; not as idle as formerly, altogether
as hearty, and having learnt to make the most of the present
and (not) long for the future with the fidgetiness that I cannot
do all I wish; seldom or (n)ever troubled with nothing to
do, and merely desiring that everybody could be as comfortable
and as undesponding, and then we should have a
very tolerable world of it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Anne's corresponding paper, though not pitched in
so robust a key, betokens a very tranquil mind. Her
news in the main is much the same as Emily's; her
mention of Branwell almost verbally identical, though
she possibly alludes to him again when, speaking of her
situation at Thorp Green, she said that she had 'some
very unpleasant and undreamt-of experience of human
nature.'</p>

<p>Then there follows an interesting entry: 'Charlotte
is thinking about getting another situation. She wishes
to go to Paris.' But was it Paris that was her ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
aim in wanting to go abroad again? Six months before
she had written to M. Héger saying, 'As soon as I have
earned enough money to go to Brussels I shall go there,'
and later Dr. Paul Héger (M. Héger's son) revised and
passed an obituary notice of his father in <i>L'Etoile Belge</i>,
which stated that Charlotte had written to the <i>pensionnat</i>
asking leave to return there, and was refused. Possibly
Charlotte's wish to go to Paris cloaked another destination.</p>

<p>Then we learn that Anne had begun the third volume
of <i>Passages in the Life of an Individual</i>. 'Volume,' as
we have noticed before, means no more than 'notebook,'
but Anne by this time had certainly got some way
into the writing of the book which eventually appeared
as <i>Agnes Grey</i>. These few items of real information
are islands in an ocean of the merest chatter, which
however gives us a minute little still-life picture of this
'dismal, cloudy wet evening' at the Parsonage.</p>

<blockquote><p>Charlotte is sitting sewing in the dining-room. Emily is
ironing upstairs. I am sitting in the dining-room in the
rocking-chair by the fire with my feet on the fender. Papa
is in the parlour. Tabby and Martha are, I think, in the
kitchen. Keeper and Flossy are, I do not know where.
Little Dick is hopping in his cage.... (Charlotte) has let
Flossie in, by the by, and he is now lying on the sofa....
This afternoon I began to set about making my grey figured
silk frock that was dyed at Keighley. What sort of a hand
shall I make of it? E. (Emily) and I have a great deal of
work to do. When shall we sensibly diminish it? I want
to get a habit of early rising. Shall I succeed?</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus the gentle narrative rambles mildly on, telling
of minute happenings and of the general outlook on
life of this quiet soul, and helping us perhaps to understand
that her apparent colourlessness is not due to our
imperfect knowledge of her, but was a quality in her
character, as indeed <i>Agnes Grey</i> abundantly testifies.
But neither Anne's paper with its figured silk, its resolve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
to get up early, its information about the canary and
the dogs, nor the cheerful contents of Emily's, justify
Mrs. Gaskell's lurid estimate of the doom which Branwell
had wrought in the lives of his sisters&mdash;'The premature
death,' she tells us, 'of two at least of the sisters,&mdash;all the
great possibilities of their lives snapped short&mdash;may be
dated from Midsummer 1845.' Indeed, it is impossible
to conjecture what she means by the snapping short of
all their great possibilities (unless she alludes to the
school scheme which had already been given up a year
before, as no pupils could be obtained), for the great
possibilities of their lives, all the achievements without
which the name of Brontë would be unknown to this
day, were as a matter of fact just about to be manifested.</p>

<p>Charlotte, as we have seen, could not take the same
cheerful view as her sisters; all her plans had failed,
she was prey to a miserable devotion, and now there
was this fresh trouble about Branwell. From the
moment of her arrival at Haworth to find him discharged
with ignominy from his tutorship at Thorp Green,
down to the day of his death, rather more than three
years later, she held him in unmitigated hatred and contempt,
which, so far from keeping to herself, she constantly
expressed in her letters to her friend. No word
of pity for her brother, no faintest indication of sympathy
for the grievous pass into which his weakness and self-indulgence
had already brought him oozed from her pen,
but regularly and succinctly, month by month, she sent
Ellen the stark bulletins of his deterioration. He came
back from his trip with John Brown, and already in
August she writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>My hopes ebb low indeed about Branwell. I sometimes
fear he will never be fit for much. His bad habits seem
more deeply rooted than I thought. The late blow to his
prospects and feelings has quite made him reckless. It is
only absolute want of means that acts as any check to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
One ought, indeed, to hope to the very last; but occasionally
hope, in his case, seems a fallacy.</p></blockquote>

<p>Later in the same month she records that his health and
temper have been a little better, but only 'because he
has been forced to abstain.' Next month she tells
Ellen that 'Branwell makes no effort to seek a situation,
and while he is at home, I will invite no one to come and
share our discomfort.' In November, however, he tried
through his friend Francis Grundy to get employment
again on the railway, but could not obtain it, and
Charlotte again wrote, saying that</p>

<blockquote><p>Branwell still remains at home, and while he is here&mdash;you
shall not come. I am more confirmed in that resolution
the more I know of him. I wish I could say one word to
you in his favour, but I cannot. Therefore I will hold my
tongue.</p></blockquote>

<p>To Miss Wooler she gave the same reason why she
could not ask her to Haworth; and again she writes to
Ellen in December, saying: 'You say well that no sufferings
are so awful as those brought on by dissipation:
alas! I see the truth of this observation daily proved.'
Bitter had been her disappointment with him, and deep
was her disgust. Once he had been her chosen ally;
she had seen in front of him a brilliant career in art or
letters, but nothing of that was realised owing to the
instability of his character. The artist had degenerated
into a ticket-collector at a wayside station, and had
proved himself entirely untrustworthy. Thereafter his
downward course had been swift, and now he was
a drunken, good-for-nothing philanderer, unfit for any
employment that demanded reasonable steadiness.</p>

<p>Now Charlotte's view of the moral hopelessness of
her brother thus early expressed was amply justified:
he ruined his health by drink as he had ruined his
position as tutor by his conduct (whatever it was) towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Mrs. Robinson. For publicans and sinners, for the weak,
the self-indulgent, and the erring, Charlotte had no compassion
nor any fellow-feeling, and she included her
brother in her pitilessness. There was a special reason,
apart from his sottishness, why she should do so. A
woman of a nature less righteous than hers, and less
austere, might have found in that reason a bond of
sympathy with him; it was otherwise with her, and her
experience of a hopeless attachment, intimate and her
own, and somewhat similar to that in which Branwell
had found himself, must vastly have added to her contempt
for him when she contrasted her conduct with
his. For she had been and still was in love with another
woman's husband, and she had not taken to drink, but
had done her best to start a school. She had not committed
any 'frantic folly'; she had not raved about the
hunger of her heart to her father and her sisters, but had
refrained from mentioning to them even the name of
M. Héger. How should she not then despise her
brother for this unmanly lamentation and his sottish
consolements? Hard and composed, with set mouth
and unsoftening eyes, she wrote to Ellen that November
bulletin, saying that she wished she could say one word
in Branwell's favour, but could not.... Then there
was another letter, for it was three months since she
had written to Brussels and had yet received no answer;
and her eyes softened, and the stern mouth relaxed, and
her head was bowed low over the paper, as by the light of
the dining-room fire she told M. Héger how humiliating
it was 'to be the slave of a fixed and dominant idea which
lords it over the mind.' She entreated him to write
again, for his last letter had been stay and prop to her
for half a year, and she tells him how day by day she
awaits the post hour to see if it will bring anything from
him, and day by day disappointment flings her back into
overwhelming sorrow, when the sweet delight of seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
his handwriting fails her, and fever takes her and she
loses appetite and sleep and pines away.</p>

<p>But these were private appeals for the eye of M. Héger
alone. What would have happened, we cannot help
wondering, if, when Madame had rescued these letters
from the waste-paper basket and carefully pieced them
together, she had sent even one of them to Mr. Brontë?
Pitiable for their very abjectness, for their utter surrender
of that womanly pride, which she had counselled Ellen
always to preserve, they really reveal a folly not less
frantic than that for which she so bitterly blamed her
brother. What would her sisters and her father and her
brother have thought of her and her determination not
to leave Brussels till she had got a grip of German?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Of all the members of that tragic family, now collected
under the roof of the Parsonage in this autumn of 1845,
there to remain together till, one by one, the brother and
two of the three sisters were beckoned forth by the
finger of death, we must look on Charlotte as being the
loneliest and the most wretched. She was the continual
prey of this torture of the nerves, and it is to that she
refers when, a year later, remission had come.</p>

<blockquote><p>Assuredly, [she writes] I can never forget the concentrated
anguish of certain insufferable moments, and the heavy
gloom of many long hours, besides the preternatural horror
which seemed to clothe existence and nature, and which made
life a continual waking nightmare. Under such circumstances
the morbid nerves can know neither peace nor enjoyment.
Whatever touches pierces them, sensation for them
in suffering.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Emily and Anne, according to their secret papers, were
very tolerably content, Branwell had the consolation of
the 'Black Bull' and the luxury of his own lamentations,
while Charlotte whose scholastic programme, for which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>she had schemed at such ruinous cost to her own
peace, had utterly failed, whose literary ambitions
were dead, whose heart bled with secret self-torture,
whose righteousness was hard and pitiless and without
consolation for her, was burning away with the sense of
talents unused and abilities thwarted of their due fruition.
But Anne was working at her <i>Passages in the Life of an
Individual</i>; Branwell was working at a story also, with
which by September he had filled, in a handwriting
as minute as Charlotte's, one notebook. Emily, for
diversion, was writing the Gondal romance, <i>The
Emperor Julius's Life</i>, and, for happiness, her poems,
which were her secret life, full, not of hunger-heart and
bitterness, but of the all-sufficient rapture of a mystic
who waited the coming of the spirit when the house was
still, even as the prophet waited for the temple to be
filled by night with the glory of the Lord. Even so, she
set her light in the window to show she was alert and
ready.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Burn then, little lamp, glimmer straight and clear&mdash;</span>

<span class="i0">Strange Power! I trust thy might, trust thou my constancy.</span>
</div></div>

<p>But in Charlotte's secret garden there were none of these
night-flowering fragrances, and bitter alike to the mouth
and to the belly were the herbs that grew for the succour
of her solitude. She was the most sundered of them all,
for Emily and Anne had their private alliance, and
whereas she had turned her back on Branwell and gone
by on the other side, Emily maintained a sisterly friendliness
towards him that made yet another cause for
distance and estrangement between Charlotte and her,
and whatever private commerce she may have had
with him, Charlotte had no more part in it than in
Emily's affairs with Anne. Something to plan, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>thing
to manage, a scheme to mature, an ambition to
strive for&mdash;any of this would have given alleviation to
this weight of unbroken joyless nothingness, made more
unbearable by the authentic sense of power and vitality
and energy boiling within her, by the absence of any
engine into which to direct its driving force, and by the
continual besotted presence of an intolerable brother.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Then one day in this dreary autumn of 1845 Charlotte
saw an opportunity and took hold of it with a grip of
iron. Knowing from her letters and the secret papers
of Emily and Anne the habit of life at Haworth, we may,
without the aid of imagination, picture how it came to her.</p>

<p>Charlotte had been reading the daily paper one
morning to her father, who was now very nearly blind;
presently Mr. Nicholls came in to talk over parish affairs,
and the rest of the day lay empty and objectless before
her. Emily was making bread in the kitchen, for the
day was Monday; there was a book propped up in
front of her as she kneaded the dough, and her bulldog,
Keeper, was lying by her. Anne was in the dining-room
cleaning out the canary's cage; her spaniel Flossy
lay on the sofa. Of Branwell there was no sign; most
likely he had gone out to the 'Black Bull' for a morning
dram. Very soon Anne's task was done and she went
out quietly, to join Emily in the kitchen, and Charlotte
was left alone in the dining-room, where once all four of
them had been used to sit when the sewing tasks were
done and Aunt Branwell gone up to bed, scribbling at
poem or story, or walking round the table, discussing
each other's work. For years there had been no such
councils in literature. Anne, Charlotte knew, was
writing a story of some kind; Emily, she knew, wrote
poems still, but there was now no exchange of confidences
between them; she knew nothing of what her
sisters were writing, and as for herself, ever since she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
first went to Brussels three and a half years ago, she had
written nothing except letters to Ellen and a few friends,
and to M. Héger.</p>

<p>The two desks in which Emily and Anne kept their
private papers were lying on the side-table. Idly,
almost accidentally, Charlotte opened Emily's desk, and
on the top of the papers within lay one of the notebooks
of which Charlotte had filled so many. She took it
up; it was full of those poems which she knew Emily
wrote, but which neither she nor Anne had ever seen.
They were surprising, they were more than surprising&mdash;she
found them 'condensed and terse, vigorous and
genuine,' not like the usual run of women's poems.
While she was still at it, Emily's baking was finished
and she came in and found Charlotte deep in her reading.</p>

<p>Emily was furious at this invasion of her privacies;
'it took hours,' Charlotte put it, 'to reconcile her to
the discovery I had made.'<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The words 'My discovery,'
if she used them, must have been peculiarly irritating,
for what she had discovered was Emily's inviolable and
guarded treasure, and not otherwise does a burglar
'discover' some pearl of great price in the jewel-chest
of the house he has entered. Nor did Charlotte mean to
let go of that pearl, when its indignant owner demanded
it back, for after Emily was reconciled to the discovery
another surrender was demanded of her. Not only her
sister but the public must see those condensed and terse
poems; they must be published; they were remarkable.
Over that Emily fought harder: it took days, Charlotte
tells us, to persuade her, but she 'knew that a mind like
hers could not be without some spark of honourable
ambition and refused to be discouraged.'</p>

<p>Though all our private sympathy is with Emily over
this stern invasion of her secret life, which she had so
firmly withheld from her sisters, we are unable not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>thank God that Charlotte had no scruples about that,
but wore down her opposition by the unyielding determination
of her will. But for that, the world would
perhaps never have seen Emily's poems at all, and
possibly none of the great Brontë novels; <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i> and <i>Villette</i> might never have
been written. For the 'discovery' struck the spark
from which the old flame was rekindled, and all
three of the sisters began to burn again with those
ambitions for a literary career which had so long lain
covered with the ashes of discouragement. Charlotte
raked the ashes off and blew on the coal. Once again
there was something to do, something to work for,
and, as before, when a scholastic career was contemplated,
Charlotte took charge for the joint advantage of
her sisters and herself. This time Anne was not left
out, for seeing that Emily's poems had pleased her sister
she produced some of her own, and Charlotte found in
them 'a sweet sincere pathos.' Hence arose the scheme,
for Charlotte in her girlhood had written many poems
herself, and she decided that they must bring out a joint
volume. Branwell had written a good deal of verse too,
of a quality certainly not inferior to Charlotte's or
Anne's, but he was not asked to contribute, and neither
he nor Mr. Brontë was told anything about the project.
A selection of the poems was made, sufficient to run to
165 pages, and the pseudonyms of Currer, Ellis, and Acton
Bell were chosen, thus preserving the initials of the three
authors, and avoiding publicity. The 'ambiguous
choice of these names,' Charlotte states, 'was dictated
by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming names
positively masculine.' This scruple was but ephemeral,
for after the book appeared she wrote thanking the
editor of the <i>Dublin University Magazine</i> for a favourable
review in the name of herself and her brothers.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>The first difficulty was to get any answer at all from
the publishers to whom Charlotte offered the book,
though some warned her against publishing poems at
all.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Eventually, in January 1846, she got into practical
touch with Messrs. Aylott &amp; Jones of Paternoster Row,
who agreed to publish the book on payment by the
authors of thirty guineas, which was subscribed, we may
suppose, between them. She went with untiring precision
into questions of format, of type and of paper;
she was anxious to correct all proof sheets herself, since
the printer had set up 'tumbling stars' instead of
'trembling stars,' which threw 'an air of absurdity
over the whole poem'; and she conducted correspondence
with the firm under her own initial and
surname on behalf of the three 'Bells,' receiving replies
addressed to 'C. Brontë, Esq.' Then some mistake
occurred (did Branwell, perhaps, seeing a male address
open an envelope of proof sheets?) and future letters
were addressed to 'Miss Brontë.' Then there came the
question of binding, of the periodicals to which advance
copies were to be sent, and of the price of the book.
Charlotte thought five shillings would be suitable, but
if that was excessive for so slender a volume, four
shillings. From a letter of hers to Mrs. Gaskell in 1850,
we find that this was the price at which it was published.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
An additional sum of £5 was sent to defray the further
cost and £10 for purposes of advertising, so that in all
the sisters paid £46 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>The spirit of God had moved upon the face of those
dark and stagnant waters, and there dawned the light
that while English literature endures will know no wane.
Long before the poems were even selected and offered
to Messrs. Aylott &amp; Jones, all three sisters blazing with
the resuscitated flame of authorship were, during the
autumn of 1845, each engaged on a novel. Anne, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>she returned from Thorp Green, was already filling her
third notebook with <i>Passages in the Life of an Individual</i>,
which subsequently appeared as <i>Agnes Grey</i>. Charlotte
began on <i>The Professor</i>, and Emily was engaged on
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>. By what date these three books
were finished is not quite clear, for Charlotte gives
irreconcilable pieces of information about it. Speaking
of the book of poems she says: 'Ill-success failed
to crush us, the mere effort to succeed had given a
wonderful zest to existence, it must be pursued. We
each set to work on a prose tale....' This implies
that the sisters did not begin their novels till the venture
in poesy had failed. But this was not the case; they
must have begun to write their novels (and written fast,
too) in the autumn of 1845, while the poems were being
selected and a publisher sought for, for we find Charlotte
writing in April 1846 to Messrs. Aylott &amp; Jones,
who were then printing the poems, saying that 'C., E.,
and A. Bell are now preparing for the press a work of
fiction, consisting of three distinct and unconnected tales
which may be published either together as a work of
three volumes ... or separately as single volumes.'<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
The three stories, therefore, must have been complete
or nearly so before the poems were published at all.
Again, giving us another date for their completion, she
tells us that these MSS. (<i>Wuthering Heights</i>, <i>Agnes Grey</i>,
and <i>The Professor</i>) 'were perseveringly obtruded on
various publishers for the space of a year and a half'<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
before any of them were accepted. But <i>Wuthering
Heights</i> and <i>Agnes Grey</i> were accepted for publication
not later than July 1847<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>; they must therefore have
been finished and going out on the dreary round by
January 1846. In either case the sisters must have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>been writing their novels during the autumn of 1845,
and I suggest, as a possible explanation of these
discrepancies in date, that <i>Agnes Grey</i>, already far
advanced in the summer, was finished by January 1846,
and began its fruitless journeys then, and that <i>The
Professor</i> and <i>Wuthering Heights</i> were ready a few
months later. As to the implication that the 'prose-tales'
were not begun till the ill-success of the poems
was proved, the established dates make this quite
impossible, for all the first three stories had been finished
long before, and <i>Jane Eyre</i>, Charlotte's second story in
point of composition, was approaching completion.</p>

<p>The inception and the progress of these three novels
was, like that of the poems, kept secret. Charlotte, in
her constant and detailed letters to Ellen Nussey, in
which she records the phases of Branwell's deterioration,
gives not the slightest hint that any literary project was
on the board, and it is equally certain from what happened
after the publication of <i>Jane Eyre</i> (which was the first
of the novels to appear) that Mr. Brontë, sitting in
the parlour more sundered now every week from the
visible world by reason of his failing eyesight, for which
an operation was being mooted, knew nothing whatever
of these renewed activities: whether Branwell knew is
a question that will presently require a more detailed
investigation. Nor was there less silence and secrecy
between the authors themselves, and we must picture
them busy but wholly uncommunicative to each other
about their progress, in spite of Mrs. Gaskell's fascinating
account of how they read new chapters of <i>Jane Eyre</i>
and <i>Wuthering Heights</i> to each other, as they came hot
from the glowing workshops. She says:</p>

<blockquote><p>The sisters retained their old habit which was begun in
their aunt's lifetime, of putting away their work at nine
o'clock, and commencing their study, pacing up and down the
sitting-room. At this time, they talked over the stories they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
were engaged upon, and described their plots. Once or twice
a week, each read to the others what she had written and
heard what they had to say about it ... the readings were
of great and stirring interest to them all.</p></blockquote>

<p>But to out infinite chagrin we find that nothing of the
sort took place, for Charlotte, referring to the writing
of these very books, says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Formerly we used to show each other what we wrote,
but of late years this habit of communication and consultation
had been discontinued: hence it ensued that we were mutually
ignorant of the progress we might respectively have made.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Nothing unfortunately can be clearer than that, and
though we must abandon the delightful idea of these
readings we are left with a reality far more characteristic
of the isolation of the three in their common aim.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They still wrote chiefly in the evening, for there was
housework to do, and how long were the busy silences!
Anne would be sitting to-night at the table in the dining-room
with her desk in front of her. She was getting
towards the end of <i>Agnes Grey</i>. Emily had gone to
give the dogs their supper, and they had heard her go
upstairs, for she often did her writing in her bedroom.
Mr. Brontë had just looked in to say good-night and
tell them not to sit up late. He wound up the clock as,
now nearly blind, he groped his way upstairs to the
room where he and Branwell slept together. Charlotte
sat on the hearth-rug, writing by the firelight. She had
a board on her knees, and she wrote in her minute hand
on scraps of paper which next day she copied out for her
finished manuscript. She was getting on well with
<i>The Professor</i>. Then the long silence would be broken
by the sound of the opening of the front door; so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>Branwell was back from the 'Black Bull,' and he
stumbled as he shuffled along the passage. To-night
he looked into the dining-room and came and sat close
to Charlotte to warm himself, for it was a cold night,
and the north wind blew, specked with snow, from the
moor. Charlotte had nothing to say to him; she did
not even look up, but stiffened and drew a little away
from him, for he kept coughing, and his breath was
foully sweet with whisky. He would have liked to ask
Charlotte what she was writing, but he was afraid of
her, and she might say something biting in return. So
as his reception was not encouraging, he soon left them:
Emily was gone upstairs, and he tapped at the door of
her room&mdash;that slip of a room just over the front door&mdash;to
have a few words with her, if she was not yet gone
to bed, for he had an idea in his head to talk about.
He stumbled off, forgetting to shut the door.</p>

<p>Not a word did the two sisters exchange about him:
silence descended again, and, when the clock struck
midnight, Anne put her papers into her desk&mdash;perhaps
locking it&mdash;and left Charlotte still absorbed in her work,
her face close to the paper. For the last day or two
she had been thinking much about Branwell and his
frantic folly, his making love to a woman in her husband's
house, and the disgusting creature he was, with his foul
breath and his tipsiness and his maudlin lamentations.
To-night she was engaged on the twentieth chapter of
<i>The Professor</i>, and she had been describing how William
Crimsworth was leaving the Professor's house, 'where
a practical modern French novel seemed likely to
materialise.'</p>

<blockquote><p>I had once [he reflected] the opportunity of contemplating,
near at hand, an example of the results produced by a course
of interesting and romantic domestic treachery. No golden
halo of fiction was about this example, I saw it bare and real:
and it was very loathsome. I saw a mind degraded by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
habit of perfidious deception, and a body depraved by the
infective influence of the vice-polluted soul. I had suffered
much from the forced and prolonged view of this spectacle....</p></blockquote>

<p>But it was late and the fire was burning low. Charlotte
went upstairs, pausing before she entered the room,
once Aunt Branwell's, now occupied by her and Anne,
for she heard Branwell's voice coming from Emily's
room. It was strange that she could tolerate his disgusting
presence.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<p>In the spring of 1846 (or at the beginning of the year,
if Charlotte's statement about the three books vainly
seeking a publisher for a year and a half is correct)
<i>Wuthering Heights</i> was finished; it is necessary to go
into the much-derided suggestion that Branwell was
the author of it. It was published under the <i>nom de
plume</i>, Ellis Bell, which Emily had already adopted for
her contribution to the joint volume of poems, and
Charlotte tells in the Biographical Notice to the 1850
edition of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, how 'Ellis Bell produced
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>, Acton Bell, <i>Agnes Grey</i>, and Currer
Bell also wrote a narrative (<i>The Professor</i>) in one
volume.' That would certainly seem to settle the
question once and for all, and no doubt Charlotte
believed that Emily was the sole and entire author of the
book. Moreover, she wrote after Branwell's death to
Mr. W. S. Williams of the firm of Smith, Elder &amp; Co.,
making the following statement concerning her brother's
complete ignorance of all the buzz of literary activity
that was going on at the Parsonage:</p>

<blockquote><p>My unhappy brother never knew what his sisters had done
in literature&mdash;he was not aware that they had ever published
a line. We could not tell him of our efforts for fear of
causing him too deep a pang of remorse for his own time
misspent and talents misapplied.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now it is frankly impossible to accept that statement.
For the last two years of Branwell's life printed proofs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
were constantly arriving for the sisters, one packet of
which was perhaps opened by Branwell himself by
mistake: six presentation authors' copies, Charlotte
tells us,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> were sent to Emily and Anne on the publication
of their books, and to her also, as well as multitudes of
reviews which she always insisted on seeing. Mr. Brontë,
when <i>Jane Eyre</i> had begun to boom, was informed by
Charlotte that she was the author; Charlotte and Anne
went up to London more than a year before Branwell
died, to disclose themselves to Smith, Elder &amp; Co.;
Mrs. Gaskell tells us how, when Charlotte had sent the
manuscript of <i>The Professor</i> to a publisher, and had
received no acknowledgment, she consulted Branwell
himself as to the reason of his silence. For all these
reasons it is ludicrous to suppose that Branwell knew
nothing about his sisters' publications; the most we
can believe, but that readily, is that Charlotte, who
found it difficult to remain in the same room with him<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
or to speak to him at all, never herself said a word to
him about them. As for the reason she assigned for
his not being told of them, because the sense of his own
wasted life in comparison with his sisters' would cause
him remorse, it is better, considering her implacable
treatment of him, to refrain from comment altogether.</p>

<p>Returning, then, to the main question as to whether
or no Branwell was responsible in whole or in part
for <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, there is so much queer and
seemingly strong evidence that he not only knew about
it, but had something to do with it, that it would be a
mere dishonesty to disregard it entirely, or to dismiss
it unexamined. The principal documents are as
follows:</p>

<p>(1) On September 10, 1845 (that is, at the beginning
of the autumn when the literary activity of the three
sisters started again), Branwell wrote thus to his friend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>J. B. Leyland the sculptor, who executed the bas-relief
profile of his head, seen by Mrs. Gaskell at Haworth:</p>

<blockquote><p>I have, since I saw you at Halifax, devoted every hour of
time, snatched from downright illness, to the composition
of a three volume novel, one volume of which [notebook?]
is completed, and, along with the two forthcoming ones,
has been really the result of half a dozen long-past years
of thoughts about, and experience in, this crooked path of
life. I feel that I must rouse myself to attempt something,
while roasting daily and nightly over a slow fire, to while
away my torments.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>(2) Mr. William Dearden, author of <i>The Demon
Queen</i> and other poems, published in the <i>Halifax
Guardian</i> in June 1867 a remarkable story concerning
himself and Branwell. They agreed to hold a sort of
poetic tournament at the Cross Roads Inn, near Haworth,
each reading his own poem. J. B. Leyland was
appointed umpire in this contest. Dearden continues:</p>

<blockquote><p>I read the first act of <i>The Demon Queen</i>, but when Branwell
dived into his hat&mdash;the usual receptacle of his fugitive scraps,
where he supposed he had deposited his MS. poem, he found
he had by mistake placed there a number of stray leaves of a
novel on which he had been trying his 'prentice hand....
Both friends earnestly entreated him to read them, as they
felt a curiosity to see how he could wield the pen of a novelist.
After some hesitation, he complied with the request and riveted
our attention for about an hour.... The scene of the fragment
which Branwell read, and the characters introduced in
it,&mdash;so far as then developed,&mdash;were the same as those in
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>, which Charlotte confidently asserts was the
production of her sister Emily.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>(3) Mr. Edward Sloane, a friend of Branwell's and
of Mr. William Dearden's, declared to the latter that
'Branwell had read to him, portion by portion, the novel
as it was produced at the time, insomuch that he no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>sooner began the perusal of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> when
published than he was able to anticipate the characters
and incidents to be disclosed.'<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>(4) Branwell's friend, Mr. F. H. Grundy, who first
made his acquaintance when he was ticket clerk at
Luddenden Foot Station in 1842, and paid at least two
visits to him at Haworth, wrote in his memoirs:</p>

<blockquote><p>Patrick Brontë declared to me, and what his sister Emily
said bore out the assertion, that he wrote a great portion of
<i>Wuthering Heights</i> himself. Indeed it is impossible for me
to read that story without meeting with many passages
which I feel certain <i>must</i> have come from his pen. The weird
fancies of diseased genius with which he used to entertain
me in our long talks at Luddenden Foot reappear in the pages
of his novel, and I am inclined to believe that the very plot
was his invention rather than his sister's.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Now much of this evidence was not published till
twelve years at least after Charlotte's death. It is therefore
remote from the events of which it treats. But
there is one dated and contemporary document, namely,
Branwell's letter of September 10, 1845, to J. B. Leyland,
which states that he had then written the first volume
of a novel, and the rest of the evidence (the reading of
the opening chapters of it to Mr. Dearden and Leyland,
the recognition of what had then been read, when
<i>Wuthering Heights</i> was published, and so forth) is in
accordance with it. Unless, then, we assume that these
gentlemen, Messrs. Dearden, Sloane, and Grundy, were
confederated liars of remarkable constructive imagination,
it must be confessed that there is a <i>prima-facie</i> case
for Branwell's having had knowledge of the book
before it was published, and for his having had a hand
in its writing. The case is carried further by certain
internal evidence in the story itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>First come one or two verbal points of little importance
in themselves, but contributory:</p>

<p>(1) In a letter of Branwell's (already quoted) addressed
to 'Old Knave of Trumps' we find the rather remarkable
phrase: '... he whose eyes Satan looks out of as
from windows'; and in <i>Wuthering Heights</i> we find
Nellie Dean admonishing Heathcliff as follows about his
sulky face:</p>

<blockquote><p>Do you mark ... those thick brows, that instead of
being arched, sink in the middle; and that couple of black
fiends, so deeply buried, who never open the windows
boldly but lurk glinting under them like devil's spies?<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Again Isabel, speaking of Heathcliff, says: 'I stared
full at him and laughed scornfully. The clouded
windows of hell flashed a moment towards me.'<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>This is nothing in itself. Branwell's letter to 'Old
Knave of Trumps' was written in 1841, and he may
easily have used the image of Satan looking out of a
man's eyes as from windows in Emily's hearing, and
she, struck with it, have twice closely paraphrased it.
But the coincidence is curious, and Miss Robinson, who
scouted the idea of Branwell having had anything to
do with <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, certainly found it so, for
in her admirable book <i>Emily Brontë</i> she quotes Branwell's
letter otherwise entire to show what a degraded
wretch he was, but omits these few words.</p>

<p>(2) In a letter of Branwell's after his dismissal from
his tutorship, in consequence of his conduct concerning
Mrs. Robinson, he writes: 'My own life without her
will be hell. What can the so-called love of her wretched
sickly husband be compared with mine?'</p>

<p>In <i>Wuthering Heights</i> Heathcliff says to Nellie Dean:</p>

<blockquote><p>Two words would comprehend my future&mdash;<i>death</i> and <i>hell</i>;
existence after losing her would be hell. Yet I was a fool to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>fancy for a moment that she valued Edgar Linton's attachment
more than mine. If he loved with all the power of
his puny being, he couldn't love in eighty years as I could
in a day.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This latter verbal coincidence is far more significant
than the other, for <i>Wuthering Heights</i> was nearing
completion when Branwell wrote the corresponding
letter, and it looks therefore as if he must have been
cognisant of the passage in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. Taken
in conjunction with his statement that he had written
part of a novel, and the statement of three other witnesses
that what Branwell on one occasion read them, and
on another occasion told them, enabled them, when
<i>Wuthering Heights</i> appeared, to recognise in it a story
of which already they knew the outline and had heard
a part, these coincidences support the suggestion that he
had something to do with the book, and, as author, or
collaborator, or confidant, knew about it.</p>

<p>But apart from and vastly outweighing the sum of
such minor points, apart from but curiously confirming
the stubborn external evidence of other witnesses, comes
the internal evidence, both as regards composition, verbal
expression, and general texture, that <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
is the work of two authors. The work of the first was
merely a handicap, though a serious one, on that of the
second, and is a very small portion of the whole, and in
the 'fire and the mighty wind' of the second we recognise
the wild and visionary and mystical power which
inspires Emily's poems. In that Branwell had no part
at all, and it would be as ludicrous to suppose that he
was in any real sense the author of the book as that
Charlotte was.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> It was supposed by some when the book
first came out that it was an early and immature work of
hers, but she indignantly repudiated such a suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>To turn then to the book itself, which is among the
greatest works of fiction the world has ever seen, the
composition and construction are inconceivably awkward,
and this awkwardness is entirely due to the manner
in which it begins. It opens&mdash;dated 1801&mdash;with the
first-hand narrative of Mr. Lockwood, the tenant of
Thrushcross Grange, who goes to visit his landlord
Heathcliff at Wuthering Heights, and it is clear that the
intention of the writer was to make him a personage in
the story. He pays a second visit next day and is
immensely struck with the younger Catherine, whom he
has not seen before. He pities her for being buried
alive with these savages: he thinks she is Hareton's
wife.</p>

<blockquote><p>She has thrown herself away on that boor [he reflects]
from sheer ignorance that better individuals existed! A sad
pity&mdash;I must beware how I cause her to regret her choice.
The last reflection may seem conceited: it was not. My
neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive; I knew
through experience that I was tolerably attractive....</p></blockquote>

<p>It is impossible to imagine a clearer indication of the
writer's intention to make a <i>motif</i> out of Catherine's
beauty and Lockwood's complacent susceptibility. But
nothing happens; the intention was scrapped. Lockwood
returns to Thrushcross Grange next morning,
after some bitter nocturnal experiences, and asks his
housekeeper Nellie Dean to tell him more about this
strange family. Thereupon she becomes the narrator,
and talks to him that day for eighty pages. Next day
he falls ill, and is a month in bed. When he gets better,
she resumes her narrative, he merely listening. She
began it from her earliest years and now completes it up
to the date at which the story opens, giving him the
entire history of the Earnshaws, of the Lintons, and of
Heathcliff. We lose sight of Lockwood altogether;
he only listens to Nellie Dean as she repeats verbatim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
long conversations, telling this voluminous history at
first hand as she witnessed it. She reads him a letter of
eleven pages, which Lockwood reproduces word for
word; she oversees, she overhears, and it is not till
page 367, quite near the end of the book, that the original
narrator appears again to tell us that Mrs. Dean's story,
which has lasted for twenty-seven chapters, is over.
Then Lockwood narrates one chapter, describing his
third visit to Wuthering Heights, and leaves the district.
After a break he dates his next chapter 1802, and when
he visits the Heights once more, Nellie Dean again tells
him what has happened while he has been away. From
first page to last he has had nothing whatever to do
with the story to which, instead of narrating it himself,
as he began to do, he is merely audience, and writes
down what Nellie Dean has told him. He has no more
to do with it than the occupant of a stall in the theatre
has to do with the action on the stage.</p>

<p>No single author could have planned a book in so
topsy-turvy a manner. It begins, in point of time,
nearly at the end, the original narrator drops completely
out, and the actual narrator, whose story forms the bulk
of the book, tells it to him. But supposing that, for some
reason, the first few chapters had to be retained, this
complete change of plan, though productive of endless
awkwardnesses, was necessary in order to tell the story
at all. Lockwood, the newly arrived tenant who auto-biographically
opens the book, could not know the
previous history of Heathcliff and the rest. So Nellie
Dean must recount it to him, and it takes so long that he
must needs fall ill so that his convalescence may be
beguiled with it. Nobody planning a story from the first
could have begun with an episode so misplaced that such
an awkward device must be resorted to. Moreover,
though from first to last Lockwood has nothing to do with
the story at all, there are those sure indications in the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
chapters that he was meant to play a part in it. He warns
himself that he must not make himself <i>too</i> attractive, and
cause the enchanting Catherine (married, so he fancies,
to the boorish Hareton) to fall in love with him.</p>

<p>Now in September 1845, as we have seen, Branwell
wrote to J. B. Leyland that he was writing a story.
He gave an hour's reading of the beginning of it to
Leyland and Dearden: Dearden, when <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
was published, recognised that the opening was what
Branwell had read them. Branwell also read pieces to
Sloane, who similarly recognised them; he affirmed to
Grundy that he had written 'a great portion' of the book
(which we decline to believe), and Grundy, when it came
out, similarly recognised stories which Branwell had
told him when a clerk at Luddenden Foot. My suggestion
is that Messrs. Dearden, Leyland, Sloane and
Grundy were not independent liars, who happened to
hit on the same lie, but that Branwell planned with
Emily a considerable part of the book and that he wrote
and read to Leyland and Dearden the opening chapters,
which make so awkward a misfit with the rest. We must
also remember as a matter of evidential importance that
Branwell's letter to Leyland, saying that he had completed
a volume&mdash;notebook&mdash;of his story, was dated
September 10, 1845. Charlotte made the 'discovery' of
Emily's poems in the autumn of that year, and it was that
which set going again the literary activities of the sisters.
Emily (hitherto occupied with the Gondal History
of the Emperor Julius) then took <i>Wuthering Heights</i> in
hand with the connivance and collaboration of Branwell,
retaining the first two chapters that open the book,
which Branwell had already written.</p>

<p>Dates, then, support the idea that what Branwell read
his friends was the earliest chapters of <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>. A more effective support is derived from the
contents of those chapters which led to such awkward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>nesses
in the composition of the whole, and, in especial,
from the style of them. Lockwood, at present the
narrator, writes with the identical pomposity with
which Branwell wrote to Southey, to Blackwood, and
was now writing to his friends: he uses elaborate
expressions and journalistic phrases, he employs a vast
number of words derived from the Latin and Latin
words; he displays a scholastic pretentiousness. Such
sentences as these, all culled from those first two
chapters, are characteristic of his style:</p>

<blockquote><p>I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to
inspecting the penetralium.</p>

<p>I detected a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary
utensils.</p>

<p>Imagining they (the dogs) would scarcely understand tacit
insults, I unfortunately indulged in winking and making
faces at the trio, and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated
madam....</p>

<p>Swayed by prudential considerations of the folly of
offending a good tenant, he (Heathcliff) relaxed a little in
the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary
verbs.</p>

<p>'Wretched inmates,' I ejaculated mentally, 'you deserve
perpetual isolation from your species for your churlish
inhospitality.'</p>

<p>You are the favoured possessor of the beneficent fairy.</p>

<p>A mingled guffaw from Heathcliff and Hareton put the
cope-stone on my rage and humiliation.</p>

<p>I ordered the miscreants to let me out, with several incoherent
threats of retaliation that in their indefinite depth
of virulency smacked of King Lear.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such extracts are typical of Lockwood's style of
writing when he opens the story of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>.
Then he vanishes and is a mere listener to the lucid
narrative of Nellie Dean. At the end of the book, when
he takes up the story again, we should naturally expect
him to resume the narrative style of the beginning;
but what do we find?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>I lingered round them under that benign sky, watched the
moths fluttering among the heath and hare-bells, listened to
the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered
how anyone could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the
sleepers in that quiet earth.</p></blockquote>

<p>Both the first two chapters and the end are supposedly
Lockwood's writing, but it is incredible that the same
hand held the pen. The hand that wrote the pompous,
swashbuckling but picturesque letter to John Brown
beginning 'Old Knave of Trumps,' might easily have
written the first two chapters of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
as narrated by Lockwood, Style 1, but never the conclusion
by Lockwood, Style 2. No hand but one could
have written that, or the narrative of Nellie Dean, or the
wild moorland passion of the book, fierce and devouring,
yet with hardly a touch of the flesh in it, and that was
hers (not Branwell's nor Charlotte's), which had written
thus of the power that possessed it:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">He comes with western winds, with evening's wandering airs,</span>
<span class="i0">With that clear dusk of heaven that brings the thickest stars.</span>
<span class="i0">Winds take a pensive tone, and stars a tender fire,</span>
<span class="i0">And visions rise and change, that kill me with desire.</span>
</div></div>

<p>To Branwell, then, we may assign these first two
chapters, pompous and monstrous in style, with their
Lockwood <i>motif</i> which once announced is heard no more,
and then Emily took charge, but still in consultation
with him. The 'ruffianly bitch' was his perhaps, so
also, certainly, was the material for the half-savage
country folk, such as Zillah and Joseph, whom he
calls the 'surly indigenæ.' Charlotte herself, though
fully believing that Emily wrote the book, as indeed
she did, felt the difficulty of accounting for the intimate
knowledge which she showed of Branwell's indigenæ,
for in her preface to the 1850 edition she says:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>I am bound to avow that she had scarcely more practical
knowledge of the peasantry amongst whom she lived than a
nun has of the country people who sometimes pass her convent
gates ... except to go to church or take a walk on the
hills, she rarely crossed the threshold of home.</p></blockquote>

<p>How then could she have been able to draw them with
that firm, minutely-etched delineation of their talk and
their gestures that make them move and live before us
in speech and habit and soul? But Branwell knew them;
they were just the folk with whom he had always consorted
at the 'Black Bull,' at the meetings of the 'Lodge
of the Three Graces,' over interminable whisky-toddies,
and his was the clay which he brought for Emily's
fashioning. He made his contributions too, as in the
verbal coincidences already noted, the devil-eyes of
Heathcliff, and Heathcliff's ravings about the force of
his love for Catherine compared with Linton's, for just
so did he rave about his passion for Mrs. Robinson,
compared with her invalid husband's tepidity and
indifference. But of all this collaboration Charlotte
knew nothing, just as she had known nothing about
Emily's poems till she had rifled her desk. The others
had their secrets together, Emily and Anne played at
Gondals, Emily and Branwell talked over <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>. Branwell had begun it, and they retained
those first two chapters, though that handicap entailed
endless awkwardnesses in the rest of the telling.</p>

<p>And Charlotte was the most solitary of them all. She
had her heart's secret which she shared with none, and,
while her soul was filled with loathing for Branwell's
tipsy maunderings about the married woman for whom
he had committed some 'frantic folly,' she could scarce
help contrasting the indecency of such gabble with her
own silent tortures of expectation when the post-hour
drew near and the silent despair which followed, when
it brought her no reply from M. Héger.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<p>Early in January 1846 there was a railway panic,
following a railway boom. New companies had been
floated with insufficient capital, and many unfortunate
shareholders were ruined. The legacies which the
three Brontë sisters had inherited from their aunt had
been invested by Emily during Charlotte's second sojourn
in Brussels in the York and Midland Railway. This was
a well-managed line with a sound financial basis, and
in spite of the panic the capital value of the shares had
been maintained. Charlotte was anxious that they
should sell their shares and re-invest, though at a lower
rate of interest, in something safer, but her sisters disagreed,
and sooner than hurt Emily's feelings she agreed
to let her money stop where it was. 'Disinterested and
energetic (Emily) certainly is,' so she wrote to Miss
Wooler,' and if she be not quite so tractable or open to
conviction as I could wish, I must remember perfection
is not the lot of humanity.' A few years later Charlotte's
misgivings were justified, and she lost some considerable
part of her legacy.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>A dreary account of Branwell follows in this letter,
for to Miss Wooler as well as Ellen, Charlotte wrote her
grim bulletins.</p>

<blockquote><p>He never thinks of seeking employment, and I begin to
fear he has rendered himself incapable of filling any respectable
station in life; besides, if money were at his disposal he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>would only use it to his own injury: the faculty of self-government
is, I fear, almost destroyed in him.</p></blockquote>

<p>She had already written to Ellen this month in the same
strain. 'Branwell offers no prospect of hope, he professes
to be too ill to think of seeking for employment.'
And so throughout the spring it goes on, till one wearies
of these incessant girdings, and bleeds for the unpitied
brother more than for the pitiless sister. That complaint
that he would not get a situation and thus rid
Haworth of his odious, scarcely supportable presence,
is always to the fore.</p>

<blockquote><p>I am thankful that papa is pretty well, though often made
very miserable by Branwell's wretched conduct. There&mdash;there
is no change but for the worse,... You ask if we are
more comfortable. I wish I could say anything favourable,
but how can we be more comfortable so long as Branwell
stays at home, and degenerates instead of improving? It
has lately been intimated to him that he would be received
again on the railroad where he was formerly stationed if he
would behave more steadily but he refuses to make an effort;
he will not work&mdash;and at home he is a drain on every
resource&mdash;an impediment to all happiness....</p></blockquote>

<p>Intolerable as Branwell must have been, it is strange
to find that his sister would sooner he went back to
Luddenden Foot, where he had no companion of any
sort but a porter, nor the slightest stimulus, ineffective
though it seemed to be, of home and of relations to keep
him from going more quickly and finally to ruin, than
that he should be such an impediment at Haworth to all
happiness. Nor was she right in saying that he made no
effort to get employment, or that any such post had been
offered him. Three times during this period did he beg
his friend Grundy, an engineer on the line, to get him
reappointed to some post, and each time his application
was refused.</p>

<p>No doubt in spite of the ruthlessness of her letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Charlotte tried to be more charitable towards him, but
just as he was bound in those detestable chains that his
weakness had so strongly wrought for him, so the very
uprightness of her nature, the stern Puritanism of her
principles, her revolt at the injustice of them all being
made to suffer for his bestiality, fettered her capacity for
pity. Something of this&mdash;this striving on both sides to
do better than the self-indulgence of the one and the
righteousness of the other permitted&mdash;appears in a certain
statement which Branwell wrote down and read to
his friend, Mr. George Searle Phillips, who came to
see him at Haworth. The half-tipsy, self-pitying sentimentality
of it is obvious and odious enough, but
equally obvious is its underlying authenticity: nobody
could have invented such a story. This is Mr. Phillips's
account:</p>

<blockquote><p>One of the Sunday-school girls in whom he and his house
took much interest fell very sick, and they were afraid she
would not live. 'I went to see the poor little thing,'
Branwell said, 'sat with her half an hour and read a psalm
to her, and a hymn at her request. I felt very like praying
with her too,' he added, his voice trembling with emotion,
'but, you see, I was not good enough. How dare I pray for
another who had almost forgotten how to pray for myself!
I came away with a heavy heart, for I felt sure she would die,
and went straight home, where I fell into melancholy musings.
I often do, but no kind word finds its way ever to my ears,
much less to my heart. Charlotte observed my depression
and asked what ailed me. So I told her. She looked at me
with a look I shall never forget&mdash;if I live to be a hundred
years old&mdash;which I never shall. It was not like her at all.
It wounded me as if somebody had struck me a blow in the
mouth. It involved so many things in it. It was a dubious
look. It ran over me, questioning and examining, as if I had
been a wild beast. It said, &#8220;Did my ears deceive me, or did
I hear aright?&#8221; And then came the painful baffled expression,
which was worse than all. It said, &#8220;I wonder if that's
true!&#8221; But as she left the room, she seemed to accuse herself
of having wronged me, and smiled kindly upon me, and said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
&#8220;She is my little scholar, and I will go and see her.&#8221; I replied
not a word, I was too much cut up. When she was gone
I came over here to the &#8220;Black Bull,&#8221; and made a note of it
in sheer disgust and desperation. Why could they not give
me some credit when I was trying to be good?'</p></blockquote>

<p>The reader's first feeling, no doubt, is of nausea at
this 'nobody-loves-me' attitude, at the maudlin self-pity,
at the writer's going straight to the 'Black Bull'
to console himself in the usual manner and 'make a
note' of his sister's cruelty. But he writhed under her
whips: her attitude to him is what we should gather
from her letters to Ellen. And yet, sickened to the soul
at him, she was trying to do better.</p>

<p>Then there was Anne. Anne's sincere piety, her
gentleness, her sense of duty, made a strange harvesting
from her brother's failings. As soon as she had finished
<i>Agnes Grey</i> she at once set to work on her second
novel, <i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i>, which is largely
concerned with a drunken monomaniac: of its genesis
and the history of its production Charlotte gives a full
account.</p>

<blockquote><p>The choice of subject was an entire mistake. Nothing less
congruous with the writer's nature could be conceived. The
motives which dictated the choice were pure, but, I think,
morbid. She (Anne) had, in the course of her life, been called
on to contemplate near at hand and for a long time, the
terrible effects of talents misused and faculties abused ...
what she saw sank very deeply into her mind, it did her harm.
She brooded over it till she believed it to be her duty to
reproduce every detail ... as a warning to others. She
hated her work, but would pursue it. When reasoned with
on the subject she regarded such reasonings as a temptation
to self-indulgence. She must be honest; she must
not varnish, soften or conceal. This well-meant resolution
brought on her misconstruction and some abuse....</p></blockquote>

<p>There can be no question as to whom Anne contemplated
'near at hand' and 'for a long time'; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
'talents misused' were his whose 'talents misapplied'
Charlotte lamented after Branwell's death, and we
picture Anne, pious and gentle, industriously, from a
sense of duty, making copy out of Branwell. Nor
can there be any question who misconstructed her
motives and abused her. Not Charlotte, who understood
her motives, though she thought her choice of subject
morbid, but Emily.... Again the picture of the quiet
dining-room at the Parsonage outlines itself with a little
terrible detail added.</p>

<p>The three sisters were together to-night in the dining-room,
and Anne had just told Emily who was the model
for the drunken wastrel in her new book. She sat silent,
conscious of the rectitude and high moral aim of her
intentions, while Emily stormed at her for the brutality
of it. Charlotte, too, was dissuasive; she thought
she was morbid to dwell on such a theme. When
they had finished, Anne merely said she knew she was
doing right&mdash;they must not tempt her&mdash;and patiently
resumed her work. The words came easily to-night,
for there had been a horrid scene with Branwell, who
came back reeling and hiccoughing from the 'Black
Bull.'</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Charlotte escaped sometimes from the home which,
if we may judge from her letters, had become to her,
from various causes, so dark an abode of hate and
misery, and on which soon far blacker shadows were
to fall. This spring she spent a fortnight with Ellen,
and heard encouraging news about the operation for
cataract. On her return she went to see her father, who
was now nearly blind, and cheered him up by telling
him how successful the operation now was, for he dreaded
the idea; also it was a relief to him to know that he
might wait for a few months yet before he need submit
to it. Charlotte's letter to Ellen continues:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>I went into the room where Branwell was, to speak to him,
about an hour after I got home; it was very forced work to
address him. I might have spared myself the trouble, as he
took no notice, and made no reply: he was stupefied. My
fears were not in vain. I hear that he had got a sovereign
from papa while I have been away under pretence of paying
a pressing debt; he went immediately and changed it at a
public house, and employed it as was to be expected. Emily
concluded her account by saying that he was a hopeless being:
it is too true. In his present state it is scarcely possible to
stay in the room where he is.</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter contains a sentence on which much has
been built. It has been argued that, because Emily
called her brother 'a hopeless being,' she gave him up
with the same completeness as Charlotte had done.
This view is shared by Mr. Clement Shorter, who concludes
that 'by now (March 1846) Branwell had reached
that stage of physical and moral wreckage when even
his most broadminded sister had to give him up.'<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> He
refers again to this expression of Emily's and says: 'The
fact is that Branwell's state at that time was such that
Emily, being only human, could not possibly have been
more tolerant,&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;than her two sisters....'
Now it is with the greatest reluctance that one differs
from Mr. Shorter, whose patient and careful research
and whose fair treatment of all available data about the
lives of the Brontës makes him so eminent an authority,
but surely this conclusion, built on so slender a foundation,
is unwarranted. We rather picture Emily telling
Charlotte how Branwell had got a sovereign under false
pretences from his father and spent it in the usual way,
adding, merely cursorily, 'Oh, he's a hopeless being!'
Such an interpretation seems more likely than to ascribe
to Emily, on this phrase alone, a fixed and justifiable
determination to have nothing more to do with him.
It does not seem consistent with the nature of one who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>was 'full of ruth for others,' or who was indignant
with Anne for using Branwell as a model for the
drunken Huntingdon in <i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i>,
now on the stocks. Moreover, there is rebutting
evidence that rests on a more solid foundation than this
surmise.</p>

<p>Miss A. Mary F. Robinson (Madame Duclaux) published,
in 1889, a book called <i>Emily Brontë</i>. It contains
the following passage about Emily's relations with her
brother:</p>

<blockquote><p>There was one woman's heart strong enough in its compassion
to bear the daily disgusts, weaknesses, sins of Branwell's
life, and yet persist in aid and affection. Night after
night, when Mr. Brontë was in bed, when Anne and Charlotte
had gone upstairs to their room, Emily still sat up waiting.
She often had very long to wait in the silent house before the
staggering tread, the muttered oath, the fumbling hand at the
door, bade her rouse herself from her sad thoughts and rise
to let in the prodigal, and lead him in safety to his rest. But
she never wearied in her kindness. In that silent house, it
was ever the silent Emily who had ever a cheering word for
Branwell; it was Emily who remembered that he was her
brother, without that remembrance freezing her heart to
numbness.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then follows a spirited account of a fire that broke
out in Branwell's room one night. He had gone to
bed and fallen into a drugged or drunken sleep, and his
candle had upset, setting his sheets alight. Emily dashed
downstairs for a couple of pails of water, extinguished
the flames and rescued her brother. Miss Robinson's
account is too full of vivid but impossible details to be
accepted entirely. We cannot, for instance, believe that
while Emily went to fetch water from downstairs
Charlotte, Anne, and the servant 'stood huddled together
in amazed horror' against the wall of the passage
outside without making the slightest attempt to pull
Branwell off the burning bed, or see what could be done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
with the water-jug, but Miss Robinson has stated that
she derived the information that Emily befriended and
tried to help Branwell until the end, and that she did
thus rescue him when his bed was on fire, from Ellen
Nussey herself. This disposes of the suggestion that,
because Emily allowed that her brother was a 'hopeless
being,' she therefore abandoned him, and that this story
of the fire was a mere myth incubated from the similar
incident in <i>Jane Eyre</i> in which Jane rescues Rochester
from the bed to which his lunatic wife had set fire.
Indeed, considering how invariably Charlotte wove into
her novels pieces of personal experience, the fact that an
identical scene occurs in her book points to its being
derived from the actual incident for which Ellen Nussey
is the source. We are thus also enabled to date this
rescue by Emily of her brother as having occurred before
<i>Jane Eyre</i> was begun in the summer of 1846. Nature
would otherwise be imitating Art with an almost indecent
fidelity. A further confirmation of this date is supplied
by our knowledge that for two years before his death
Branwell slept in the same room as his father: at the time
of the fire he must still have been occupying a room to
himself.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Finally, as regards Emily's unbroken friendship and
pity for Branwell during these appalling years when the
other sisters watched him, with aversion or to point
a moral, being wrecked by self-indulgence and dying
of consumption, we have only to read her poem <i>The
Wanderer from the Fold</i>, which was the last she ever
wrote<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and was composed between Branwell's death in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>September 1848 and her own in December of the same
year. It is not questioned that it refers to him:</p>

<p>In May 1846 occurred Mr. Robinson's death. 'It
served Branwell,' wrote Charlotte, 'for a pretext to
throw all about him into hubbub and confusion with his
emotion, &amp;c. &amp;c.' Of that sufficient has already been
said; all that is solid about it is that the year before he
had doubtless made love to the woman, and that very
properly she told her husband about it, who dismissed
him and told him not to hold any communication with
her. Probably she was sorry for him and had friendly
feelings towards him, as a perfectly respectable woman
may towards a man who has tried to make love to her,
for more than once subsequently Charlotte records that
Branwell had been sent presents of money from 'the old
quarter,' which is sufficiently explicit. All the rest we
may confidently consider a fiction on Branwell's part,
composed with the object of making himself a love-lorn
and tragic figure. Unfortunately Charlotte believed,
though with hesitation,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> his fantastic tale, for her letters
to Ellen contain several most bitter allusions to Mrs.
Robinson, as if it was she who, by making advances to
Branwell and then throwing him over, was responsible
for his degradation. With that we may dismiss the rest
of the sordid episode as being in the main a drunkard's
imaginings, since every detail of it can be directly traced
to Branwell himself.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Early in June 1846, to judge by the date of reviews
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>in the <i>Critic</i> and <i>Athenæum</i>, the joint book of poems
by the three sisters was published. The <i>Critic</i> gave
it a very good notice; the <i>Athenæum</i> declared that
Ellis Bell had a 'fine quaint spirit'; but for the present
only one copy was actually purchased, fourteen being
sent out for review.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the three novels were going their weary
journeys, and after long intervals returned to their
authors with uncommenting refusals; and Mr. Brontë's
eyes were getting worse. He could grope about still,
but no longer could he see the face of his watch which
he took with him into the pulpit on Sunday to regulate
the length of his discourse; from habit, however, he still
preached for a precise half-hour. But his eyes were now
ripe for the operation, and in August Charlotte accompanied
him to Manchester, having with admirable
efficiency made all arrangements with the surgeon and
having engaged lodgings for herself and him. She
was racked with toothache which kept her awake at
night; she had no idea how to cater for the nurse who
would attend her father after the operation, and on the
very morning when it took place a fatal parcel arrived
which she knew to be the manuscript of <i>The Professor</i>,
which, like the dove, had once more found no resting-place.
At her father's wish she was present in the room
throughout the operation, and during the days that
followed, when he had to remain in the dark in charge of
the nurse whom, as a stranger, she disliked and distrusted,
she set to work on a new novel, <i>Jane Eyre</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>It would be hard to find an instance of a more indomitable
pluck, a more iron determination not to be
overborne by any phalanx of adverse circumstances.
There was nothing whatever in prospect at home: there
was a drunken brother for whom she felt nothing but
loathing and contempt; every scheme which she had
made for the career of herself and her sisters had
crumbled, their poems were still-born, their novels
found no publisher; life was passing away, she was
earning nothing, and those acquirements for teaching
which she had won at such cost to her peace were rusting
in disuse. Most keenly and most bitterly and with an
ever-growing pessimism did she feel these tribulations,
but her will and the fire of her imagination flamed up
unquenched through the smoke and the damp smouldering;
indeed, she found fuel in what would have finally
extinguished a less ardent soul. She stoked up the fires
of her imagination and threw into them the bitterness
of heart with which she wrote of her schooldays at
Cowan Bridge and the death of her sisters. A year had
already elapsed since her 'discovery' of Emily's poems
had kindled, after long ash-covered smouldering, the
flame of literary ambition, and though that year had
brought forth nothing but disappointment, it burned
unquenched. Hermetically secret about it, never a
word or hint did she vouchsafe to Ellen about what she
had written, what she and her sisters had published, or
what she was now writing.</p>

<p>But she confided to Ellen a certain resolution she had
made, of sufficient importance to be printed in capitals
in one of her letters: 'And if I were ever again to find
myself among strangers I should be solicitous to examine
before I condemned.' This confession is striking. She
was aware of her censorious habit, she knew it led her
into erroneous conclusions, and yet it seemed an integral
part of her character. She was too much of a fighter
to rank herself with the non-combatants who suffer long
and are kind; she was ever harshly critical of those who
made her suffer. Strangers made her suffer, and the first
thing she looked for in them was faults. She was
abnormally shy of them; her shyness to the end of her
days was torture to her, and she attributed her discomfort
to their odious qualities. It was from this largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a><br><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
that her censoriousness sprang, but it was also due to
her constitutional pessimism which, always expecting
to find blemishes in others, was seldom disappointed.
She was alert to detect faults, she was extreme to mark
what was done amiss. Indeed this practice seemed rather
to be a principle of hers, for she deprecated any sort of
optimism about others.</p>

<blockquote><p>I believe you are prone [she wrote a year or two later to
Mr. W. S. Williams] to think too highly of your fellow-creatures
in general&mdash;to see too exclusively the good points
of those for whom you have a regard. Disappointment
must be the inevitable result of this habit.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is a certain cynical truth in her comment, but
what she did not perceive was that her own habit of being
over-eager to see faults was exactly what caused her <i>not</i>
to arrive at a regard for others; nor did she perceive
that those who go through life as she did, prone to
think disparagingly of her fellow-creatures, lose more
than they gain by saving themselves such inevitable
disappointments, for they miss the vastly outweighing
rewards which come to the kindlier disposition which
is on the look-out for amiable qualities. Her instinct
was always to judge, and this deprived her of all the
unreflecting enjoyment which is part of the natural
equipment of a normal human being: the light touch,
the indulgence for herself and others which is like yeast
in the otherwise heavy dough of existence, never seem
to have been hers, nor that sense of humour that makes
human failings endearing rather than culpable. This
rigidity, pessimistic and puritanical, had the defects of
its qualities, and it resulted in that absence of charity
which revealed on all sides a multitude of sins, and it
was the root of much of her unhappiness. Not until
the last months of her life did she find the only possible
antidote to it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>An alleviation to the monotonous gloom of the
Parsonage this autumn was the recovery of Mr. Brontë's
eyesight. By November he was in full harness again,
and capable of taking three Sunday services by himself.
That was a matter for thankfulness, but it passed into
routine, and in the winter she writes to Ellen that
nothing pleasant happens at Haworth, and the only
thing that has 'stung us into life' was the arrival of
a sheriff's officer for Branwell, 'inviting him either to
pay his debts or take a trip to York.' Bitterness was
about her path, and when Ellen tells her about a new
white dress which she looks forward to wearing, while
Charlotte commends her frankness in telling her of her
pleasure, she warns her against indiscriminate frankness,
and hopes that 'an overdose of vanity will not spoil this
blessing and turn it into a misfortune.' She sends Ellen
a piece of lace, but hopes that the Bradford Post Office
will not steal it&mdash;for the officials there usually open
letters that seem to contain something interesting.
Then, though she had been firmly resolved that Ellen
should not come to Haworth while Branwell was there,
she now invites her, for</p>

<blockquote><p>Branwell is quieter now and for a good reason; he has got
to the end of a considerable sum of money, and consequently
is obliged to restrict himself in some degree. You must
expect to find him weaker in mind and a complete rake in
appearance.</p></blockquote>

<p>But the visit fell through: Ellen's sister had already
arranged to be away from home, and she could not
leave her mother. Upon which vials of wormwood and
gall are outpoured: Charlotte says that she may find
it more difficult next time to arrange for Ellen to come.
This entirely unreasonable letter she subsequently
withdrew with apologies.</p>

<p>By the summer of 1847 the book of poems had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
out for a year, and in spite of favourable notices in the
<i>Critic</i>, the <i>Athenæum</i>, and the <i>Dublin University Magazine</i>,
only two copies in all had been sold. Before
the remainder were scrapped Charlotte sent copies to
Wordsworth, Tennyson, Lockhart, and De Quincey,
with an identical letter of homage to each, in the name of
the three authors, referring to the painful efforts their
publishers must have made in getting rid of even two
copies. To-day either of these would fetch at least
a hundred pounds in the auction room. Southey, it
may be noticed, who nine years before had very decidedly
discouraged Charlotte from attempting to write verse,
was not sent one. The poetical career for herself and
her sisters had closed, and there was nothing to be done
but to send the rest of the slender volumes to the trunk-makers
for a paper lining to their boxes. But we cannot
help wondering what would have been their fate if these
volumes had been slenderer still, and had contained
only Emily's poems. As it was, these were sandwiched
between the work of her two sisters, and that work, to
speak quite frankly, is destitute of all poetical quality
and distinction. There is not a stanza or even a line in
it all which gleams or sings. Charlotte, in after days,
at any rate, knew that herself: she says, 'All of it that
merits to be known are the poems of Ellis Bell.' It is
strange that, when first she was arranging for the publication,
that should not have struck her, and that her
business sense should not have perceived how terribly
Emily's work was handicapped by being wedged in
between plain, pious, ponderous pages by herself and
Anne. No doubt the glamour of the joint ambition
dazzled her.</p>

<p>Ellen's deferred visit took place in August 1847:
she came, she stayed, and she went away again in
complete ignorance of all the excitement that raged
beneath the peaceful surface at the Parsonage. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
by now <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Agnes Grey</i> had both been
accepted by the publisher Mr. T. C. Newby, after their
pedlar-pilgrimages, and though <i>The Professor</i> made yet
one more unsuccessful journey to Messrs. Smith, Elder
&amp; Co., it came back on Charlotte's hands not with the
'two hard hopeless lines' that had up till now accompanied
its return, but, though refused, with a critical
letter of two pages, showing, as Charlotte quaintly put
it, 'a discrimination so enlightened that this very refusal
cheered the author better than a vulgarly expressed
acceptance would have done.' The firm also intimated
that a manuscript of a three-volume novel would
receive careful reading. <i>Jane Eyre</i>, begun just a year
ago, at Manchester, when Mr. Brontë was lying in a
dark room after his operation, was now nearly finished,
and it was sent off to the publishers on August 24.</p>

<p>The reader for the firm, Mr. W. S. Williams, was
enthusiastic about the book, so also was Mr. Smith,
and it was at once accepted for publication in the autumn.
Only a few weeks ago the prospect had been absolutely
blank: two copies only of the joint volume of poems
had been sold, and the three novels begun in the autumn
of 1845 had journeyed wearily from publisher to publisher,
returning always to Haworth. Now each sister
had found a market for her wares, and among them was
a book of supreme and matchless passion and <i>Jane Eyre</i>.
Had it not been for Charlotte's discovery of Emily's
poems two years before, and for the failure of her scheme
to set up school, it is possible that neither of them
would have been written. The Misses Brontë would
have had a boarding-school for girls at Haworth
Parsonage, and it would have kept them busy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<p>This visit of Ellen's to Haworth in August was returned
by a visit of Charlotte's to Brookroyd the next month.
Proofs of <i>Jane Eyre</i> were coming in fast, for it was
being hurried through the Press, and Charlotte sat at
the same table as her friend, with the printed galleys in
front of her, yet not a word of question or volunteered
information passed between them. Charlotte peered
into her proofs and Ellen, with that excellent tact which
characterised her, was completely blind to what was
going on under her eyes. She must have been perfectly
aware that Charlotte was correcting proofs and had
therefore written a book, and the image of these two
intimate friends sitting there in silence with this so
highly exciting evidence sprawling on the table between
them makes a pleasing picture.</p>

<p>She returned to Haworth and found her boxes stuffed
with presents from her kindly friend. There was an
eye-screen for Mr. Brontë, a peck of apples and a collar
for Emily, who was pleased but astonished, a 'crab
cheese' for Anne, that soothed her cough, a cap for
Tabby, and a jar of preserves for Charlotte, for all which
bounties Ellen got duly scolded. Other news from
Haworth was that Mr. Nicholls was on holiday in
Ireland, and that Anne's delicate chest found the east
winds troublesome. Mr. Grant, the master of Haworth
Grammar School, as yet unconscious that Charlotte
was taking note of his behaviour, and that he was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
figure among the curates of her next book, was full
of unintelligible apologies for not having made more
of Ellen during her visit to Haworth. The foolish
creature! 'Why apologise for conduct which caused
no suffering whatever?...' But what about Miss
Amelia Ringrose, a young lady who had lately developed
a <i>schwärm</i> for Ellen? Charlotte had never seen her,
and had never been more interested about a total
stranger. Of Branwell not a word, and not a word of
<i>Jane Eyre</i>.</p>

<p>Currer Bell's book was published on October 16, and
was an instant success not only with the ordinary fiction-reading
public, but with the literary world. Thackeray's
praise, conveyed in a letter to the publishers, was particularly
pleasing to Charlotte, for she already admired his
work (<i>Vanity Fair</i> was at the time coming out in parts),
and his admiration of <i>Jane Eyre</i> accentuated her belief
in his judgment. 'No author,' she wrote, 'seems to
distinguish so exquisitely as he does dross from ore, the
real from the counterfeit. I believed too he had deep
and true feelings under his seeming sternness. Now
I am sure he has....'</p>

<p>The popular enthusiasm over <i>Jane Eyre</i> as well as
that of the literary world was not to be wondered at.
The plot, though wholly incredible, is highly exciting;
it teems with the stimulating impossibilities of shockers
and best sellers. Mr. Rochester for years kept a lunatic
wife on the third floor of his country-house, in charge
of a gin-drinking maid, instead of putting her in an
asylum, and none of the other servants nor Jane Eyre,
who was governess to Mr. Rochester's illegitimate child,
knew anything about it. The house resounded with
her demoniac laughter: she attempted to burn her
husband in his bed, she bit her brother, and on the eve
of the wedding of Jane Eyre to Rochester, she came to
her room in the middle of the night and tore her bridal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
veil in half. No scruple about committing bigamy ever
entered Rochester's head; he blandly proposed to marry
the eighteen-year-old governess of his illegitimate child,
and his intention was only thwarted by the intervention
at the marriage-service itself of his brother-in-law and
his lawyer. He then suggested to Jane Eyre that, since
he had been prevented from tricking her into a bogus
marriage, she should become his mistress. This she
refused to do, and, though still madly adoring him and
unresentful of his monstrous deception, ran away, and
after spending her last penny on a coach fare, left her
belongings in the coach, and scoured the country on foot
for two days. Finally she dropped, dripping and
exhausted, on the threshold of the house where her three
first cousins happened to live, of whose existence she
was not aware, but who were the only relations she had
in the world. She then found that she was the heiress
of an uncle who had died leaving her £20,000, which
she divided up between her cousins and herself. Her
male cousin, Rev. St. John Rivers, who was going out
to be a missionary in India, decided that she must
accompany him. It would cause scandal if they were
not married, and so he told her that, though they were
not in the least in love with each other, she must become
his wife. Previously she had felt not the slightest
interest in anything connected with missions, but she consented
to go out with him, though not as his wife, and
for that purpose learned Hindustanee. He still insisted
on marriage, and she was on the point of yielding when
she heard a phantom voice coming from the moonlit
night calling 'Jane, Jane!' She knew it to be the
voice of Edward Rochester, and ran out into the garden
exclaiming, 'Where are you?' No answer came, and
she commented: 'Down superstition. This is not thy
deception nor thy witchcraft, it is the work of nature.
She was roused and did&mdash;no miracle&mdash;but her best.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>'
So she hurried back to Thornfield, and found that Mrs.
Rochester had again set fire to the house, that a burning
beam had fallen on her husband when he tried to rescue
her, and that he was stone blind. The maniac had
jumped off the roof and was killed. So Jane Eyre
sought him out and married him. He recovered his
sight and they had a baby.</p>

<p>Such is the mere plot of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, a tissue of
violences, absurdities, and coincidences, not less ludicrous
than those glimpses of high life, in which Blanche
Ingram of the 'raven ringlets and the oriental eye'
addresses her mother as 'Baroness Ingram of Ingram
Park,' and says to the footman, 'Cease thy chatter,
blockhead, and do my bidding.' The didactic passages,
of which there are many, the hortatory passages (as
when Jane Eyre draws a picture of herself in chalks,
'smoothing away no displeasing irregularity,' and then
an imaginary and ideal portrait of Miss Ingram, in order
to cure herself of her vain aspirations towards Mr.
Rochester) are written in a style of incredible pomposity:</p>

<blockquote><p>Order! No Snivel&mdash;no sentiment&mdash;no regret! (thus she
addresses herself) I will endure only sense and resolution.
Recall the august yet harmonious lineaments, the Grecian
neck and bust; let the round and dazzling arm be visible,
and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring nor gold
bracelet ... call it 'Blanche, an accomplished lady of rank.'</p></blockquote>

<p>But over all such extravagances the greatness of the book
rises triumphant and supreme by reason of its beauty
and its white-hot sincerity: all its faults are consumed in
that furnace. Never before in the history of English
fiction had there been anything to approach this picture
of pure passion, not only of a man for a woman, but of
a woman for a man. To the delicacies and pruderies
of the early Victorian age the shock must have been
terrific, but high and low, rich and poor, found that it
was no use being shocked; they had to read it, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
was its fiery splendour rather than the shock of it that
left them gasping. It was in no sense a designed revolt
against the conventions of the day in literature and
living: it merely disregarded them, was unconscious
of them. Charlotte was not preaching, she was telling a
story about an insignificant little woman who knew what
she meant when she spoke of love, its sufferings and its
fiery quality which burns up like dross all sentimentality
and softness. The message in her book spoke direct
to the soul of humanity, and instantly it had its architectural
place in the literature of the world, weight-bearing
and massive. Often and often in herself the
larger vision, the sweep of the serene sky, was obscured
as with clouds and peevish squalls, with censoriousness
and bitterness, with want of compassion and decrying
judgments, with the desire to preach and to scold, but
behind was this clear shining.</p>

<p>Naturally, as is always the case when something new
and startling and disturbing leaps to light, there were
bitter criticisms of her work which, as was equally
natural in one of her temperament, she bitterly resented.
But she insisted on seeing all unfavourable reviews,
and though her avowed object was to profit by them, the
real effect of them was to make her blood boil with a
sense of their injustice and stupidity.</p>

<blockquote><p>It would take a good deal to crush me [she robustly wrote
to Mr. Williams], because I know in the first place that my
intentions were correct, that I feel in my heart a deep reverence
for religion, that impiety is very abhorrent to me; and in
the second I place firm reliance in the judgment of some
who have encouraged me.</p></blockquote>

<p>In fact, so far from being crushed, adverse criticism only
caused her to take the gloomiest views of the character
of those who expressed it.</p>

<blockquote><p>I was aware [she wrote to her old mistress, Miss Wooler]
that some persons thought proper to take exception to <i>Jane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Eyre</i>, and that for their own sakes I was sorry, as I invariably
found them individuals in whom the animal largely
predominated over the intellectual, persons by nature coarse,
by inclination sensual.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Most of all she resented any speculation as to the sex of
Currer Bell; that seemed a most unwarrantable prying
into her private affairs and she could not see that such
a curiosity was legitimate. She believed that a woman
novelist was not taken seriously either by the public or
the critics; she did not have a chance, and Charlotte
wanted her work to be judged as if it were the work of
a man. Besides, there was the secret of Currer, Ellis,
and Acton Bell to keep, and though her publishers
suspected Currer Bell was a woman, she did not yet reveal
herself even to them.</p>

<p>It was not till December, when the success of <i>Jane
Eyre</i> had made it what we now call 'the novel of the
season,' that her sisters induced Charlotte to tell
Mr. Brontë of her fame. She gave Mrs. Gaskell an
account of the announcement in a delicious bit of
dialogue.</p>

<blockquote><p>'Papa, I've been writing a book.'</p>

<p>'Have you, my dear?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I want you to read it.'</p>

<p>'I am afraid it will try my eyes too much.' [Charlotte
wrote a microscopic hand.]</p>

<p>'But it is not in manuscript; it is printed.'</p>

<p>'My dear! You've never thought of the expense it will
be. It will be almost sure to be a loss, for how can you get a
book sold? No one knows you or your name.'</p>

<p>'But, papa, I don't think it will be a loss; no more will
you if you will just let me read you a review or two, and
tell you more about it.'</p>

<p>This was done, and he came in to tea, and said, 'Girls, do
you know Charlotte has been writing a book and it is much
better than likely?'<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>Evidently, then, Mr. Brontë knew nothing about the
joint book of poems, or about <i>Wuthering Heights</i>,
and <i>Agnes Grey</i>, which also came out in December
1847. The sisters had paid £50 for the printing and
publishing of 350 copies, but it appears that the publisher
only printed 250 copies.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> There was journalistic
speculation as to the actual authorship of <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>; it was suggested that it was an earlier and
immature work by the author of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, but
Charlotte at present took little heed of such attributions:
'the critics,' she wrote to Mr. Williams, 'are
welcome to confuse our identities as much as they
choose.'</p>

<p><i>Wuthering Heights</i> appears to have sold decently,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
but it attracted no critical homage for many months yet,
and Charlotte's occasional allusions to it in her letters
show how little appreciation she herself had of it, and
how profoundly she misunderstood it and the savagery
of its supreme genius. Writing, for instance, of
Heathcliff, that masterpiece of wild pagan passion, she
says: 'The worst of it is some of his spirit seems breathed
through the whole narrative, in which he figures, it
haunts every moor and glen, and beckons in every fir-tree
of the Heights.' She did not see that the terrific and
appalling impression that moor and glen and fir-tree
are permeated by Heathcliff is not 'the worst of it,' but
that in this very point, namely, that he is somehow
incarnate of the wild moorland, there lies the proof
and the very seal of the genius of the book. She
unmistakably sounds a note of apology, of excuse
for Emily.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ellis [she informed Mr. Williams] has a strong original
mind, full of strange though sombre power. When he writes
poetry that power speaks in language at once condensed,
elaborated and refined, but in prose it breaks forth in scenes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>which shock more than they attract. Ellis will improve,
however, because he knows his defects.</p></blockquote>

<p>But she thought that neither poetry nor fiction were
really Ellis's <i>forte</i>, for to the same correspondent she
writes, 'I should say Ellis will not be seen in his full
strength till he is seen as an essayist.' It seems scarcely
credible that she was writing about the author of
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>, and one vainly and impotently
wonders what sort of essay it would be and on what
subject, that would reveal the full strength of Emily
Brontë which <i>Wuthering Heights</i> only partially disclosed.
Still, sticking up for her sister, Charlotte says
she would not be ashamed to have written it. Her
maturer reflections about <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, when
she re-read it, belong to a later period. Of <i>Agnes
Grey</i> all she says is that it is the mirror of the mind of
the writer. From this judgment it is impossible to differ.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>With the publication and success of <i>Jane Eyre</i> the
twilight of nothingness, to which at one time there had
seemed to Charlotte to be no end but the complete
darkness of age and death, had given place to the most
brilliant dawn. Her horizons and possibilities had
endlessly expanded, the tonic of success had vivified
her. In January 1848 a second edition of <i>Jane Eyre</i>
was issued, and she wrote a militant preface to it, in
which her views about her critics were expressed with
singular directness. She thanked the public and her
publishers, and portions of the Press, namely, the 'select
reviewers' who 'had encouraged her as only large-hearted
and high-minded men know how.' Then there
were some resounding smacks for 'the timorous and
carping few who doubted the tendency of such books
as <i>Jane Eyre</i>.' She reminded them that: 'Conventionality
is not morality. Self-righteousness is not
religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
To pluck the mask from the face of the Pharisee is not
to lift an impious hand to the Crown of Thorns.' Then
followed a panegyric on Thackeray, to whom she dedicated
this second edition. He was an eagle compared
with that carrion-feeding vulture Fielding: he came
before high Society like the son of Imlah before the
Kings of Israel and Judah, and hurled at it the Greek
fire of his sarcasm and the levin bolt of his denunciation:
they had better attend to him if they wished to escape
a Ramoth-gilead. Thackeray, she was afraid, did not
much care for this dedication&mdash;which seems probable, for,
when thanking her for it, he told her that he, like
Mr. Rochester, had a mad wife, and people said that
<i>Jane Eyre</i> was written by his governess.</p>

<p>This second edition sold well, and soon after there
arose the question of its dramatisation and production
at some minor theatre. Charlotte shuddered at the
thought of seeing it, but steeled herself to endure the
'rant and whine, strut and grimace for the sake of the
useful observations to be collected in such a scene.'
Nothing apparently came of this, but a year afterwards it
was dramatised by John Brougham and produced in
New York.</p>

<p>Among those who had been immensely struck with
<i>Jane Eyre</i> was G. H. Lewes, who wrote to her that
he intended to contribute a review of it to <i>Fraser's
Magazine</i>. Charlotte had not heard of him before, but
she now got his novel <i>Ranthorpe</i>, which she highly
praised, and subsequently <i>Rose Blanche and Violet</i>, of
which the 'didactic passages profound and acute'
pleased her best. The correspondence between them
is chiefly notable for her views on Jane Austen. Lewes
had held her up as a master of technique, so Charlotte
got <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> on his recommendation. It
was a matter of amazement to her that anyone could
admire it. She only found</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>an accurate daguerreotyped portrait of a commonplace
face: a carefully fenced highly cultivated garden with neat
borders and delicate flowers: but no glance of a bright vivid
physiognomy, no open country, no fresh air, no blue hill,
no bonny beck. I should hardly like to live with her ladies
and gentlemen, in their elegant but confined houses.</p></blockquote>

<p>Shrewd and discreet Jane Austen might be, but nothing
more. Lewes tried again: he conceded that Jane Austen
had no poetry, 'no sentiment,' but told Charlotte that she
'<i>must</i> learn to acknowledge her as one of the greatest
artists, of the greatest painters of human nature, and one
of the writers with the nicest sense of means to an end
that ever lived.' But that lack of poetry condemned
her to Charlotte's sense: Miss Austen might be sensible,
she might be real, but she could not be great. Years
after she tried <i>Emma</i>, but it was quite hopeless: her
final conclusion was that Jane Austen was a 'very
incomplete and rather insensible (not senseless) woman.'
The explanation of her entire want of appreciation, as
has been already suggested, seems to be that Charlotte
was, in actual fact, entirely devoid of any subtle sense
of humour, and therefore could not understand Jane
Austen's.</p>

<p>In her contract with Messrs. Smith, Elder for <i>Jane
Eyre</i>, Charlotte had promised them to give them the
refusal of two further novels.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> <i>Jane Eyre</i> must have
been scarcely out before she set to work again, for
less than two months afterwards she had made three
attempts to start a fresh book, none of which satisfied
her. One of these, probably, was the fragment of
thirty-six pages, unpublished in her lifetime, called
<i>The Moores</i>. It is usually assigned to a later date,
<i>circa</i> 1852, but it is unlikely that after the publication
of <i>Shirley</i>, in which the Moores figure so largely,
she should have chosen such a title. She then read
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>over the discarded <i>Professor</i> again, finding the beginning
very feeble, and noting its deficiency in incident.
'Yet the middle and latter portion of the work,' so she
wrote to Mr. Williams,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> 'all that relates to Brussels and
the Belgian school, etc., is as good as I can write.' She
therefore proposed to recast it and make a three-volume
novel of it, but asked Mr. Williams's advice on the
subject, for <i>The Professor</i> had already been refused
by his firm. We gather that he was against it, for
Charlotte dropped the idea and at once began on
<i>Shirley</i>, taking up, probably, one of her previous three
attempts. It is interesting to observe that the idea of
doing something with <i>The Professor</i> had already
entered her mind. She was right enough in her depreciation
of it, as it stood, and she was eminently right in
realising that the Brussels section contained the germ
of a masterpiece. Again she put it back to simmer in
her mind and made it the stock-pot for <i>Villette</i>.</p>

<p>With all these new interests and correspondences to
occupy her, Charlotte's letters to Ellen were few;
perhaps she found it difficult to write to so old a friend
and refrain from any allusion to what filled her mind
and energies. She had bitter things to say about
Mrs. Robinson. 'That woman is a hopeless being:
calculated to bring a curse wherever she goes, by the
mixture of weakness, perversion and deceit in her
nature.' The reason for this outburst was evident, for
in another letter of close date she says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Branwell has, by some means, contrived to get more money
from the old quarter, and has led us a sad life with his absurd
and often intolerable conduct. Papa is harassed day and
night; we have little peace: he (Branwell) is always sick,
has two or three times fallen down in fits, what will be the
ultimate end, God knows. But who is without these drawbacks,
these scourges, these skeletons behind the curtain?</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>We gather that Miss Ringrose's devotion to Ellen still
flourished, for she had written to Charlotte almost
entirely about her, with 'a kind of gentle enthusiasm
of affection enough to make one at once smile and
weep&mdash;her feelings are half truth, half illusion. No
human being could be what she supposes you to be.'
The two friends exchanged birthday letters in April, for
their anniversaries fell on the same day, and Charlotte,
now thirty-two, felt that youth was irrevocably over;
over also was her own youthful devotion to Ellen
which had once gilded her with all the perfections that
Miss Ringrose so pathetically found in her still.</p>

<p>Then Ellen, who, some six months before, had seen
Charlotte correcting the proof sheets of <i>Jane Eyre</i>
under her very eyes, and who therefore must have known
all along that Charlotte had a book in the press, summoned
up her courage to break silence, and wrote that a
report had reached her that Charlotte had written a book.
The vehemence of Charlotte's reply probably carried
conviction that this report was perfectly true, for under
cover of an indignant virtual denial she never denied
anything at all.</p>

<blockquote><p>I have given <i>no one</i> [she wrote] a right either to affirm or
hint, in the most distant manner, that I am 'publishing'&mdash;(humbug!).
Whoever has said it,&mdash;if anyone has, which I
doubt&mdash;is no friend of mine. Though twenty books were
ascribed to me, I should own none. I scout the idea utterly.
Whoever, after I have distinctly rejected the charge, urges it
upon me, will do an unkind and an ill-bred thing. The most
profound obscurity is infinitely preferable to vulgar notoriety
and that notoriety I neither seek nor will have. If therefore
any Birstallian or Gomersallian should presume to bore you
on the subject,&mdash;to ask what 'novel' Miss Brontë has been
'publishing'&mdash;you can just say with the distinct firmness of
which you are perfect mistress, when you choose, that you are
authorized by Miss Brontë to say that she repels and disowns
every accusation of the kind. You may add, if you please,
that if any one has her confidence, you believe you have,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
and she has made no drivelling confession to you on the
subject....</p></blockquote>

<p>Surely the lady protested too much; had she not
written a novel, she could never have shown such heat
in repelling the accusation.</p>

<p>It is difficult to determine when Ellen was told:
Charlotte did not want it to be known in the neighbourhood,
and it was a secret in which her sisters shared.
But such discretion need not be observed with Mary
Taylor in New Zealand, and Charlotte sent her a copy of
<i>Jane Eyre</i>, making no mystery about it, before these
strenuous disclaimers.</p>

<p>But soon a certain acknowledgment of authorship
became necessary. Anne having finished her second novel,
<i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i>, sent it to Mr. T. C. Newby,
who had brought out <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Agnes Grey</i>,
and he had been offered a high price for it by an American
publisher as being a new work by the author of <i>Jane
Eyre</i>. He believed (so he said) that the three Brontë
novels already published were by one hand&mdash;in fact, that
Currer Bell had really written them all. Meanwhile
Messrs. Smith, Elder, with whom Charlotte had contracted
for her next book, had promised it to another
firm in America, and now found that what purported
to be Currer Bell's next book (<i>The Tenant of Wildfell
Hall</i>) was already being negotiated for there by Newby.
Upon which Mr. Smith naturally wrote to Currer Bell
asking for explanations. It was necessary, therefore, in
order to establish their separate entities and prove their
good faith, that Charlotte and Anne should show themselves
to the firm, the one as the author of <i>Jane Eyre</i>,
the other of <i>Agnes Grey</i> and the forthcoming <i>Tenant
of Wildfell Hall</i>. Without wasting time the two sisters
packed a small box and walked through a snowstorm
(the month being July) to Keighley and took the night
train for London. They washed and breakfasted at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
the Chapter Coffee House, Paternoster Row, where
Charlotte had stayed in her journey to Brussels, and then
set off on foot for 65 Cornhill.</p>

<p>An extremely dramatic scene, quite in the style of
Euripidean recognition, followed. They asked for
Mr. Smith, giving no names, and were after some delay
shown up to his room. A tall young man received them,
and Charlotte, having made sure that it was he, gave into
his hand the disquieting letter she had received from
him the morning before, directed to Currer Bell. He
looked at it and asked where she had got it. Then came
the recognition: the little lady in spectacles, who now
gave her name as Miss Brontë, was Currer Bell, author
of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and the other one was Acton Bell. They
all cursed the perfidious Newby, and Mr. Williams, with
whom Charlotte had been in effusive correspondence,
was introduced. He was pale, mild and fifty, and there
was a long nervous shaking of hands all round.</p>

<p>The business part of the expedition being thus accomplished,
a whirl of socialities followed. With a passion
for further incognito the sisters called themselves the
Misses Brown for introduction to Mr. Smith's friends,
and wearing their 'plain high-made country garments'
they went that evening to the opera.</p>

<blockquote><p>Fine ladies and gentlemen [wrote Charlotte] glanced at us
with a slight graceful superciliousness quite warranted by
the circumstances. Still, I felt pleasantly excited in spite of
headache and sickness and conscious clownishness, and I saw
Anne was calm and gentle as she always is.</p></blockquote>

<p>Next morning, the day being Sunday, they went to
church with Mr. Williams, and afterwards Mr. Smith
and his mother took them out to their 'splendid house'
in Bayswater, six miles from Cornhill; there was a fine
dinner but no appetite. On Monday there were visits
to the Royal Academy and the National Gallery, another
dinner with Mr. Smith, and then tea at Mr. Williams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>'s
'comparatively humble but neat residence' with his
family of eight children, about one of whom Charlotte
had already counselled him, as to her becoming a
governess. There was singing by a daughter of Leigh
Hunt's, and on Tuesday morning they returned to
Haworth laden with books. It had all been highly
successful and exciting, but very exhausting; social
pleasures and the presence of strangers had wrecked
Charlotte.</p>

<blockquote><p>A more jaded wretch than I looked, when I returned, [she
wrote] it would be difficult to conceive. I was thin when
I went, but was meagre indeed when I returned; my face
looked grey and very old with strange deep lines ploughed
in it, my eyes stared unnaturally....</p></blockquote>

<p>But successful though that expedition had been, and
pleased though Charlotte was at terminating with her
publishers a mystery that had become irksome, she
found that in her disclosure of identities to Mr. Smith
she had gone too far, and when she returned to Haworth
she was made aware of it. For not only had she revealed
herself and Anne as being Currer and Acton Bell, but
she had revealed Emily as being Ellis Bell. Once more,
as by the 'discovery' of her poems, she had invaded
her sister's privacy and Emily strongly resented it.
In consequence Charlotte wrote to Mr. Williams:</p>

<blockquote><p>Permit me to caution you not to speak of my sisters when
you write to me; I mean do not use the word in the plural.
Ellis Bell will not endure to be alluded to under any appellation
other than the <i>nom de plume</i>. I committed a grand error in
betraying his identity to you and Mr. Smith. It was inadvertent&mdash;the
words 'we are three sisters' escaped me
before I was aware. I regretted the avowal the moment
I had made it: I regret it bitterly now, for I find it is against
every feeling and intention of Ellis Bell.</p></blockquote>

<p>This incident is significant. At the least it accentuates
our sense of the estrangement and misunderstandings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
between the two sisters, which must have been rendered
more acute by Emily's befriendings of Branwell in these
three years, during which Charlotte had recorded, in
bulletins to her friends, his growing degradation and her
horror of him. To see more in it than that is perhaps
a mistake, though those who believe, not without cause,
that Branwell had something to do with <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>, argue from it, plausibly and ingeniously,
Emily's repudiation of sole authorship: she knew,
though Charlotte did not, that there had been a collaboration
between her and the outcast brother. But
Emily's exasperation about Charlotte's original raid on
her private papers is sufficient to account for her
resentment now against this second disclosure.</p>

<p>For six months Charlotte had issued no news of
Branwell, but in July 1848 she wrote to Ellen: 'Branwell
is the same as ever and his constitution seems
shattered. Papa, and sometimes all of us, have sad
nights with him, he sleeps most of the day, and consequently
will lie awake at night.' This letter contains,
as did the one in which she last spoke of her brother in
January, another fierce attack on Mrs. Robinson. Her
daughters, in almost daily correspondence with Anne,
were about to make, says Charlotte, loveless marriages
in obedience to her wish. 'Of their mother,' she
writes: 'I have not patience to speak, a worse woman,
I believe, hardly exists; the more I hear of her, the
more deeply she revolts me.' This repeated coupling
of Branwell's deterioration with such expressions about
Mrs. Robinson perhaps implies the belief that she was
originally responsible for Branwell's ruin, but Charlotte
does not definitely state that, nor does she show the
slightest softening towards him.</p>

<p>But the house was soon to be rid of its 'scourge
and its skeleton behind the curtain.' He was a complete
wreck, and no longer to be accounted sane.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Consumption was making rapid inroads into a frame
already hopelessly debilitated by drink and drugs, and
all the summer he had been failing fast. We have but
one glimpse more of him, which must be given chiefly
because it throws light on what his sisters and father
must have gone through during the past three years,
living in the house with him.</p>

<p>His friend Francis Grundy came to Haworth to
see Branwell two days before his death. He ordered
dinner at the 'Black Bull,' and sent a message up to
the Parsonage to ask him to come. Mr. Grundy's
account proceeds:</p>

<blockquote><p>Whilst I waited his appearance his father was shewn in.
Much of the Rector's old stiffness of manner was gone. He
spoke of Branwell with more affection than I had ever
heretofore heard him express, but he also spoke almost
hopelessly. He said that when my message came, Branwell
was in bed, and had been almost too weak to leave it:
nevertheless he had insisted upon coming, and would be
there immediately. We parted and I never saw him again.</p>

<p>Presently the door opened cautiously and a head appeared.
It was a mass of red, unkempt, uncut hair, wildly floating
round a great gaunt forehead, the cheeks yellow and hollow,
the mouth fallen, the thin white lips not trembling, but
shaking; the sunken eyes once small, now glaring with the
light of madness&mdash;all told the sad tale but too surely....
He glanced at me a moment and muttered something of
leaving a warm bed to come out into the cold night. Another
glass of brandy, and returning warmth gradually brought
him back to something like the Brontë of old. He even
ate some dinner, a thing which he said he had not done for
long: so our last interview was pleasant though grave.
I never knew his intellect clearer. He described himself as
waiting anxiously for death&mdash;indeed longing for it, and
happy, in his sane moments, to think that it was so near.
He once again declared that death would be due to the story
I knew, and to nothing else.</p>

<p>When at last I was compelled to leave, he quietly drew from
his coat-sleeve a carving knife, placed it on the table, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
holding me by both hands, said that having given up all
thoughts of seeing me again, he imagined when my message
came, that it was a call from Satan. Dressing himself, he
took the knife, which he had long secreted, and came to the
inn with a full determination to rush into the room and stab
the occupant. In the excited state of his mind he did not
recognise me when he opened the door, but my voice and
manner conquered him, and 'brought him home to himself,'
as he expressed it. I left him standing bareheaded in the
road, with bowed form and dripping tears. A few days
afterwards he died.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Now doubt has been cast on this piteous story, because,
if Branwell was dying, he could not have left his
bed; but, as Charlotte wrote to Ellen Nussey, he was
in bed for only one complete day, and went into the
village two days before his death,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> without doubt for
this meeting with Grundy. He died on September 24,
1848.</p>

<p>Charlotte neither felt nor made pretence of feeling any
personal grief. She wrote to her friend Mr. Williams:</p>

<blockquote><p>We have buried our dead out of sight. A lull begins to
succeed the gloomy tumult of last week. It is not permitted
us to grieve for him who is gone as others grieve for those
they love. The removal of our only brother must necessarily
be regarded by us in the light of a mercy rather than a
chastisement.</p></blockquote>

<p>She told him that religion and principle had never meant
anything to Branwell, and it was not till within a few
days of his end that he believed in them at all, and then
came 'conviction of their existence and worth,' and it
was a 'strange change.' He said 'Amen' to the last
prayer Mr. Brontë recited by his bedside. 'How
unusual that word appeared from his lips, of course you,
who did not know him, cannot conceive.' Charlotte
felt she could now forgive all the wrong he had done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>and the pain he had caused her, and adds, 'If man can
thus experience total oblivion of his fellow-creatures'
imperfections, how much more can the Eternal Being
who made man, forgive His creatures?' It is on her
forgiveness of her brother that she chiefly dwells, and
to Ellen and her sister she repeats that. 'All his vices
were and are nothing now. We remember only his
woes....' It was perhaps to be regretted that she
had not remembered some of his woes a little sooner,
and given him a glance of pity while he was able to
receive it. Indeed she had more compassion for the
profligate and the insane wife of Mr. Rochester in
<i>Jane Eyre</i> than she had for Branwell in his lifetime,
for she wrote to Mr. Williams with greater charity
about her: 'Mrs. Rochester indeed lived a sinful life
before she was insane, but sin is itself a species of
insanity&mdash;the truly good behold and compassionate it
as such.'</p>

<p>The shadow which for the last three years had
darkened and embittered life for Charlotte was gone,
and she put all thought of him from her; only three
times in her very voluminous correspondence did she
make further mention of Branwell. Once she says that
Mr. James Taylor, who, three years later, proposed
marriage with her, was markedly like him, adding that
when he looked at her 'her veins ran ice'; once she
fears that Joe Taylor is going the same way as Branwell,
and that a prospective marriage between him and Amelia
Ringrose must end in hopeless misery; once she says
that if she had a brother living she would not let him
read Thackeray's lecture on Fielding, for it made light of
such serious vices as drunkenness. His name was added
to those of his mother and his sisters Maria and Elizabeth
on the tablet in Haworth Church, and <i>The Tenant of
Wildfell Hall</i>, which Anne had written to warn others
concerning the wages of sin, went into a second edition.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<p>Charlotte had been taken ill and was confined to bed
for a week immediately after Branwell's death, and she
could not go to his funeral, nor, to her great regret, be
of use in comforting her father, who 'cried out for his
loss like David for that of Absalom.' But hardly was
the gloom which had darkened the Parsonage for three
years removed, and the prospect of comfort restored,
when death, instead of life, eclipsed the sunshine again.
Branwell's funeral was the last occasion on which Emily
left the house. She had a bad cold and cough, which
grew worse, and before the end of October it was clear
that she was seriously ill. She would not let a doctor
see her, she would answer none of Charlotte's questions,
she would take no medicine. In every letter that
Charlotte wrote during these two months before Emily's
death she wailed about this barrier that her sister had set
between them, agonising that she was not permitted to
approach her.</p>

<blockquote><p>Her reserved nature occasions me great uneasiness of
mind.... To put any question, to offer any aid, is to annoy....
You must look on and see her do what is unfit to do,
and not dare to say a word.... She will not give an explanation
of her feelings, she will scarcely allow her illness to be
alluded to.... Would that my sister added to her great
qualities the humble one of tractability.... She neither seeks
nor will accept sympathy:&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>such sentences as these occur everywhere. Stoical and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
secret as Emily was by nature, it is impossible not to see
in so rigid an isolation of herself some special token of
an estrangement which she would not suffer to be reconciled,
and she fenced herself against any invasion even
of sympathy. More than once her privacy had been
broken into, and she would brook no further interference.
For the last three years, too, there had been that silent
daily antagonism over Branwell growing between
Charlotte and her, and for these three months between
his death and hers, the memory of their brother stood
between them. Charlotte had had no pity for a publican
and a sinner, and Emily, 'full of ruth for others,' would
not accept for herself the compassion that had been
withheld from him, nor allow her sister to pass the
barrier which her ruthlessness had helped to build.
Yearn and agonise as she might for the love and confidence
which, partly by her own hardness, she had
forfeited, they were not to be granted her now. Her
very uprightness, the stern Puritanism of her nature, no
doubt had invested her hardness with the garb of duty,
just as Anne, in order to save others from such a career
of profligacy and bestial self-indulgence as had brought
her brother to ruin, had felt it a matter of conscience to
make copy of him in the book that had come out a few
months before his death. That, too, had been monstrous
in Emily's eyes. Anne no doubt, like Charlotte, could
forgive her brother now, but Emily, lover of the moor
and the wild things there, would not accept sympathy
from these stern moralists, nor soften to their appeal.</p>

<p>She went about her household work as long as her
panting lungs would suffer her to mount the stairs or
knead the bread. She wrote her requiem for her brother,
and she revised and copied out her own salute to death.
Refusing till the end to stop in bed, she rose daily at
seven, dressed herself and came down, remaining there
every night till ten o'clock, and then once more she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
dragged herself upstairs, and set her lamp in the window
looking out over the snow-wreaths where once she had
waited for the rustle of wings that betokened the coming
of the 'Strange Power' that inspired her, and where
now she waited for the sound of the wings of the Angel
of Death. It was cold weather; there was a fire in her
room, and one morning as she combed her hair, sitting
before it, the comb dropped from her hands into the
grate, where it lay on the hot cinders of the hearth. She
was too weak to bend and pick it up, and waited till
Martha came in, who rescued it from the singeing;
then she finished her dressing and went downstairs.
Almost to the end she fed the dogs Keeper and Flossie
after supper; she had set her wild hawk free; there
was the empty cage.</p>

<p>On the evening of December 18 Charlotte had been
reading her an essay by Emerson; seeing she was not
listening she had stopped, intending to finish it next day.
In the morning Emily came downstairs as usual, and
the sisters and their father breakfasted together in the
dining-room, and then Mr. Brontë went to his study
across the flagged passage. The meal was cleared and
Emily took up her sewing.</p>

<p>But Charlotte, looking at her, saw that a change had
come. It was no use asking her questions, for she would
not answer them, and presently she went out. She
walked up the lane to the moor which Emily loved:
'flowers brighter than the rose bloomed for her there,'
and her errand was to search to see if even on this mid-December
morning she could find just one sprig of
heather-bloom, however withered, to bring back.
Emily would understand what she meant. Peering
short-sightedly in the more sheltered hollows she found
one and plucked it, and returned to the Parsonage. She
did not speak to her sister, but laid it on the table by her,
as she worked at her sewing. Emily glanced at it and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
no more. Yet she must have known that it came from
the moor; she must have guessed what Charlotte meant
by going out to pick it for her. But it was too late:
the withered sprig brought no message of its own, and
as a token, mute and infinitely pathetic, of her sister's
longing to reach her and break for a moment the ice
of her reserve it was meaningless; the time for such
piteous signalling was over. Perhaps she struggled
with herself to give, if not a word, a look to show
that she understood, or perhaps this token seemed a
mere sentimentality, a cheap attempt to undo the irrevocable.
She was as ruthless then to Charlotte as she was
to herself, and the sprig of heather lay by her unheeded.</p>

<p>Useless: and Charlotte drew up to the table and wrote
to Ellen. Emily, she said, was daily weaker; there was
no word of hope to give. She herself had written some
days before to Dr. Epps, recommended by Mr. Williams,
a statement of Emily's symptoms; she had received but
a vague answer with some medicine, which Emily would
not take. This letter can hardly have been finished and
sent to the post when the last struggle began. Emily
fought for life then; she whispered that she would see
a doctor now if he were sent for. But before he could
come the cage was empty, and the wild hawk flown.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Those three years and a half, from that day in July
1845, when Charlotte came home and learned for what
reason Branwell would go back no more to his tutorship,
down to the winter day in December 1848 when
Keeper followed Emily's coffin to the church and then
to the grave beside her brother, comprise the most
tragic act in the domestic drama of the thrice tragic
family. But now those tipsy bawlings, those opium
dreams, those silent animosities, those ruthlessnesses
were over, and over were the agonised questions
to which no answer was given, for Branwell and Emily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
both lay in the quiet earth, where she, at any rate,
could not imagine for herself and him unquiet
slumbers. Yet from blighted days and broken nights
there had come forth the supreme felicity of the
genius and of the talent of those two sisters of whom
one alone remained. Never from stonier ground had
there sprung so lordly a harvest, for <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
was its fruit and so too was <i>Jane Eyre</i>. On that central
act of this unique drama the curtain was now rung down,
and there were left out of the five who had enacted it,
three only. Mr. Nicholls, who was to fill so large a part
in the final scene, bringing brief happiness to one who
had never known it before, had as yet no share in it.</p>

<p>It was Charlotte who, torn with anguish for the
silences of the past and the seal that was now for ever
set on them, kept the domestic stability firm; without
her the very pillars of the home must have crumbled.
Her work on <i>Shirley</i>, discontinued when Emily fell
ill, was still unhandled, for there was no energy to spare
for anything but the daily duties. 'My father,' so she
wrote on Christmas Day to Mr. Williams, 'says to me
almost hourly, &#8220;Charlotte, you must bear up. I shall
sink if you fail me.&#8221;' Branwell's death was still recent,
and he mourned his Absalom; the very fact that
Charlotte could give him no true sympathy there made
her task the heavier. But she shouldered it all, and with
that stern faith which carried her through these deep
waters of the soul she recorded her thankfulness that
she was equal to it.</p>

<blockquote><p>God has hitherto most graciously sustained me, [she wrote]
so far I have felt adequate to bear my own burden and even
to offer a little help to others. I am not ill, I can get through
the daily duties and do something towards keeping hope and
energy alive in our mourning household.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was well indeed that she found in herself this power
of firm constancy, for now a second tragedy (Branwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>'s
death being confessedly nothing of the sort to her)
began to threaten. Emily was scarcely in her grave
when it became clear that Anne was suffering from the
same dread malady as she. But here there was no such
fruitless agonising as over Emily: Anne was patient
and docile, and the doctors who were called in met with
no contemptuous refusals of the aid they sought to bring.
There was weakness, there was wasting, there were the
nightly fevers and the persistent coughing which all
told their tale, but Anne took her cod-liver oil and her
carbonate of iron and wore the blisters which were
ordered, and, according to the medical wisdom of the
day, was pent in a room from which all fresh air was
excluded, and hoped to wear the respirator that Ellen
sent, when the weather permitted her to go out.</p>

<p>She sat in Emily's chair, unable to work and scarcely
able to read, and when the specialist came from Leeds,
his stethoscope but confirmed the worst fears. And for
Charlotte below the intolerable daily burden, the heart-sickening
fears, the glimpses of hope extinguished as
soon as lit, the consciousness that, in spite of brief
rallies and betterments, Anne was steadily losing ground,
there was always the thought of Emily.</p>

<blockquote><p>The feeling of Emily's loss [she wrote] does not diminish
as time wears on; it often makes itself most acutely recognised.
It brings too an inexpressible sorrow with it, and then the
future is dark.</p></blockquote>

<p>Again she wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>I cannot forget Emily's death-day: it becomes a more
fixed, a darker, a more frequently recurring idea in my mind
than ever. It was very terrible. She was torn, conscious,
panting, reluctant, though resolute, out of a happy life. But
<i>it will not do to dwell on such things</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>There spoke, with God knows what secret and
incommunicable burden, that undefeated spirit as resolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
as Emily's own, which refused to let itself be debilitated
by despair, but turned with all its energy to the ministries
which the situation demanded. She put from her all
thought of her own work, her own feelings, so that the
monstrous article on <i>Jane Eyre</i> which appeared in the
<i>Quarterly</i> this winter, in which the author, Miss Rigby,
knowing or guessing she was a woman, spoke of her as
one 'who had long forfeited the society of her sex,' was
read by her without a pang; ordinarily her sensitiveness
would have writhed under so infamous an attack. But
now she felt no personal resentment, and only regretted
for Thackeray's sake that the old innuendo that in <i>Jane
Eyre</i> she had reproduced the circumstances of his
domestic tragedy was circulated again. Her own work
on <i>Shirley</i> she abandoned altogether, sending the first
volume of it to her publishers, so that, when she could
tackle the story again, she might have the benefit of their
views, and devoted herself entirely to Anne and her
father, an unwearied nurse to her and to him an unfailing
stay when he feared that his eyes were threatened again.
For herself, she circumscribed the moment according to
the wisdom of Marcus Aurelius; each could be borne
and profitably used if she refused to contemplate anything
but its immediate exigencies. 'I must not look
forward,' she wrote, 'nor must I look backward. Too
often I feel like one crossing an abyss on a narrow plank&mdash;a
glance round might quite unnerve.' She found her
solace in the sense of God's omnipotence. 'Fortitude
is good,' she wrote, 'but fortitude itself must be shaken
under us to teach how weak we are.' Then came the
support of the everlasting arms: 'in sua Voluntade e
nostra Pace.'</p>

<p>Throughout the spring of 1849 Anne grew steadily
weaker, but the thought of her death brought no
wild anguish of regret to Charlotte, nor to herself any
horror.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>I wish it would please God to spare me, [Anne wrote to
Ellen] not only for papa's and Charlotte's sakes, but because
I long to do some good in the world before I leave it. I have
many schemes in my head for future practice, humble and
limited indeed, but still I should not like them all to come
to nothing, and myself to have lived to so little purpose.
But God's will be done....</p></blockquote>

<p>A change to some seaside place had been recommended,
and in this letter Anne proposed that Ellen should accompany
her. But Charlotte would not permit that: if
Anne, while they were away, got suddenly worse, it would
be terrible for her friend to be alone with her, and though
it might be difficult for her to leave her father alone,
she must certainly come too.</p>

<p>Finally this plan was adopted, and in the last week of
May the two sisters, joined by Ellen, started for Scarborough,
which Anne already knew, having stayed
there with the Robinson family when she was governess
to the girls. The expense would be met out of a legacy
of £200 which her godmother had left her. They
spent the night at York, where Anne managed to see
the Minster, and on the day after their arrival at Scarborough
she drove in a donkey-chair on the sands; she
thought the donkey was being overtaxed and took the
reins herself. Next day, being Sunday, she wanted to
go to church, but was dissuaded; she had a walk in the
afternoon. On Monday, like Emily on the last day of
her life, she rose at seven, dressed herself and came
downstairs. During the morning she felt that death
was near, and wanted to leave for Haworth immediately
if there was a chance that she could get home alive.
A doctor was sent for, and in answer to her direct
question said that her time had come. Then she wholly
and serenely surrendered herself, commending Charlotte
to her friend, and thanking them for their kindness to
her. There was a little restlessness, and she was carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
from her chair to the sofa. She said to Charlotte, 'Take
courage, Charlotte, take courage,' and then, without an
uneven breath, she passed away, dying at just the hour
when Emily had died.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Charlotte stayed on at Scarborough with Ellen for
a couple of weeks, and then went back alone to the
Parsonage. Her father and Tabby and Martha were
well; the dogs seemed in a strange ecstasy. 'I am
certain they regarded me as the harbinger of others,' she
wrote to Ellen. But the light died from their eyes, for
there were none but Charlotte to return.</p>

<p>Having seen her father, she went alone into the dining-room
and shut herself in.</p>

<blockquote><p>I felt that the house was all silent: the rooms were all
empty. I remembered where the three were laid,&mdash;in what
narrow dark dwellings&mdash;never more to reappear on earth.
So the sense of desolation and bitterness took possession of
me. The agony <i>that was to be undergone</i>, and was <i>not</i> to be
avoided came on.... The great trial is when evening closes,
and night approaches. At that hour we used to assemble
in the dining-room: we used to talk. Now I sit by myself:
necessarily I am silent. I cannot help thinking of their last
days, remembering their sufferings, and what they said and did,
and how they looked in mortal affliction.</p></blockquote>

<p>The clock ticked loud in the still house, Keeper lay
outside Emily's door; her desk and Anne's must some
time be gone through to find what papers they had left,
and none now would resent such intrusions. The air
whispered with voices of the past and trembled with
memories. 'But crushed I am not yet,' she wrote, 'nor
robbed of elasticity, nor of hope, nor quite of endeavour.'
She took up her book again, abandoned since last
October when Emily fell ill. Since then her hours
had been full with other ministries, now they were
empty and must be filled. Rather more than half of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
it had been written, now she began on the chapter
called 'The Valley of the Shadow of Death.' It
was finished by the end of August, and she knew
that work had been her salvation, and she wrote to
Mr. Williams:</p>

<blockquote><p>The faculty of imagination lifted me when I was sinking
three months ago: its active exercise has kept my head
above water since: its results cheer me now, for I feel they
have enabled me to give pleasure to others. I am thankful
to God who gave me the faculty, and it is for me a part
of my religion to defend this gift and to profit by its
possession.</p></blockquote>

<p>There was never a more magnificent fortitude in the
face of so great tribulations, and she had to bear as well
a load of those minor ones which can be taken lightly by
an unburdened spirit, but which can so easily prove
the last straw, when the weight of affliction is already
accumulated to breaking point. She was in ill-health,
she was sorely troubled with headaches and bilious
sickness, and on the top of all these minor troubles
came domestic trials. Of the two servants at the
Parsonage, Martha Brown was ill and in bed, Mr. Brontë
declaring that she was in imminent danger, and Tabby,
now over eighty, fell as she got up from her chair with
her head under the grate. Charlotte's frayed nerves for
once gave way, she simply sat and cried for ten minutes;
then called herself a fool and got Martha's sister in to
help her with the housework. She was always at her
best when things were worst: hers was one of those
unflinching natures which trouble seems to anneal.
Some are broken by it, but she would have scorned to
be of such brittle stuff; some are softened by it, but she
was not one of them. Even the death of her sisters,
the loss, as she said, of the only two people in the world
who understood her, had been as impotent to weaken
essentially the iron confidence in which she met such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
bereavement, as the sufferings of her brother had been
impotent, while he lived, to rouse her compassion.
Life was a fight, and she was not going to be beaten.</p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p>As was her nature, so necessarily was her religion,
and they both emerged from these tragic years unshaken
and unsoftened. Gone utterly, burned out of her by
searing experience, were those emotional, half-hysterical
aspirations of which in her adolescence Ellen had really
been the source; she no longer sought that water of
Life, of which once drinking she should never more
thirst. She looked for no easy yoke or light burden,
nor expected rest for her soul, but travail. Nor was her
conception of the Omnipotence on which she leaned
and to the decrees of which she gave obedience any sort
of mystic ecstasy; it was the very antipodes of Emily's
'Strange Power,' that fiercely tender pagan force which
set the moorland heath abloom and the lapwings
mating, and so kindled the love of Catherine for the sheer
beauty of the savage earth and for Heathcliff's savage
adoration that, dreaming she was dead, she broke her
heart with weeping to escape from the conventional
tameness of heaven, 'and the angels were so angry that
they flung me into the middle of the heath on the top of
Wuthering Heights, where I awoke sobbing for joy.'
Not less antipodal to Charlotte's God was Anne's conception
of the loving and sustaining hand which led her,
lacking nothing, so gently through the valley of the
shadow, that far from fearing the death of the body,
she rejoiced in the accomplishment of her serene journey.
While here, she had her work to do for Him, and it was
in His service that she had used the degradation of her
brother to warn others of the disaster that attends evil
courses. God was her loving Shepherd, and she, mild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
as Flossie, must bark at the wolves which threatened
His flock.</p>

<p>But to Charlotte both such conceptions were incomprehensible:
to her God was no pagan Pan who fluted
in the 'livid hollows' of the moor, nor yet a compassionate
Redeemer, but the lawgiver revealed on Sinai, who
had written His commandments very distinctly on stone
tables, and was powerful to save and infinite in mercy.
That decalogue did not enjoin loving indulgence of the
weak, nor the duty of judging not, and the charity that
suffered long and was kind had no place in it. She was
as unsparing in her severity to herself as she was to others;
she claimed from herself, even as God claimed from her,
a full account of the talents He had given her, and never
did she shirk the demands of duty nor complain of the
sternness of that lawgiver, but she never eased the
burden with the lighter yoke of love. She suffered
much, she was ready to acquiesce always in personal
sacrifice, but she neither looked for nor found in self-abnegation
any particle of joy. Undeviatingly through
the wilderness she followed the cloud by day and the
pillar of fire by night, and she never expected to find
therein any oasis for her rest and refreshment. It was
an arid journey, for on all sides she saw so much of what
she felt herself bound to disapprove; but as long as she
followed the gleam, smoky though it often was, she
knew she was doing God's will, and to that she referred
every decision she had to make, and every pang she had
to bear. She was in constant ill-health, and it was to
God's help she looked that she would not break down,
and that steeled her will; the same strength enabled her
firmly to face the inevitable end of Anne's illness when
'reason unsupported by religion' would have failed her.</p>

<p>Belief in God's guidance gave her resignation to His
accomplished Will, but (not exactly in opposition to it,
but trying to range herself with it) she put forth all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
force in order to accomplish her own. Thus, when in
the last years of her life, in consequence of Mr. Brontë's
violent objections to her marriage with Mr. Nicholls,
the latter left Haworth, and all seemed over, Charlotte
believed that 'Providence is over all: that is the only
consolation.' But she successfully set to work to get
Mr. Nicholls back, and when her father's opposition was
withdrawn and the marriage permitted, she equally
believed that this was 'the destiny which Providence in
His goodness and wisdom seems to offer me.' Again,
when there was pleasure to be thankful for instead of
trouble to be resigned to, she blended, with a childlike
simplicity, her human satisfaction with her gratitude for
the Divine favour bestowed. When, for instance, she
received favourable reviews of <i>Villette</i>, she wrote:
'The import of all these notices is such as to make my
heart swell with thankfulness to Him who takes note
both of my suffering and work and motives. Papa is
pleased too.'</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p><i>Shirley</i>, then, was finished in August 1849, and now
after ten years there came to Charlotte another offer,
the third, of marriage; for the sake of continuity it will
be better to dissect this odd episode out of her letters
during these years, and give it for the first time a
connected outline.</p>

<p>Mr. James Taylor was in her publisher's firm, and he
had read and criticised the portion of her book which
she had sent to Smith, Elder in the spring of this year;<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
possibly Charlotte had met him when she and Anne
had gone to London to disclose their identities. He
was soon to pass through Leeds on his return to London
from his holiday, and Mr. Williams suggested that he
should come to Haworth and take the newly-finished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>manuscript back with him. Charlotte, as serious as a
judge, wrote just the letter that Jane Austen's eyes
would have twinkled over, elaborately explaining why
she could not offer the 'homely hospitalities' of the
Parsonage for a few days. Her father was not strong
enough to take walks with a visitor on the moors, and</p>

<blockquote><p>the peculiar retirement of papa's habits is such as to
render it irksome to him to give much of his society to a
stranger, even in the house. Without being in the least
misanthropical, or sour-natured, papa habitually prefers
solitude to society, and custom is a tyrant whose fetters it
would now be impossible for him to break. Papa, I know,
would receive any friend of Mr. Smith's with perfect kindness
and goodwill but I likewise know that unless greatly put out
of his way, he could not give a guest much of his company.</p></blockquote>

<p>But in case Mr. Taylor cared to come for the day, she
gave the most minute directions how he was to get to
Haworth from Leeds, pointing out the mischances that
menaced him if he forgot to change at Shipley: in fact,
though rather fluttered, she did not discourage the visit
at all.</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor came then, early in September, for the
inside of a day, and they met again in London in the
winter, when Charlotte went to stay with Mrs. Smith,
her publisher's mother. He certainly made a strong
impression on her, though, as was usual with strangers,
not wholly agreeable, for he had</p>

<blockquote><p>a determined, dreadful nose in the middle of his face (which
after all was the usual place) which when poked into my
countenance cuts into my soul like iron. Still he is horribly
intelligent, quick, searching, sagacious, and with a memory
of relentless tenacity. To turn to Williams after him or to
Smith himself, is to turn from granite to easy down or warm
fur.</p></blockquote>

<p>We may infer that he proposed to her then, for two
passages in a letter she wrote to Ellen in September 1850,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
just nine months afterwards, strongly point to this. The
first is:</p>

<p>'Doubtless there are men whom if I chose to encourage
I might marry, but no matrimonial lot is even remotely
offered me which seems to me truly desirable.'</p>

<p>She then refers to a letter she had received from
Mr. Taylor ('the little man').</p>

<blockquote><p>I was somewhat surprised to receive his letter, having
concluded nine months ago that there would be no more
correspondence from that quarter.... This little Taylor is
deficient neither in spirits nor sense.</p></blockquote>

<p>Something had evidently happened nine months ago
which made her think that Mr. Taylor would not write
again. But he had spirit and the sense to see that there
was hope for him. So little Taylor persevered in his
suit, causing Charlotte to waver, for <i>à propos</i> of some
abstruse badinage on Ellen's part about marriage (probably
referring to George Smith), she wrote to her:</p>

<blockquote><p>The idea of the 'little man' shocks me less&mdash;it would be
a more likely match if 'matches' were at all in question,
<i>which they are not</i>.... You may laugh as much and as wickedly
as you please&mdash;but the fact is there is a quiet constancy
about this, my diminutive and red-haired friend, which
adds a foot to his stature&mdash;turns his sandy locks dark, and
altogether dignifies him a good deal in my estimation.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This looked like yielding, and very likely she would
have married him, had he not accepted an appointment
to open a branch of Messrs. Smith, Elder in Bombay;
this would take him out of England for five years.
Charlotte wrote him two very proper letters, hoping that
'the change of climate would not bring a risk to health,'
and referring to business as 'a Moloch which demanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>personal touch in the mention of his sacrifice, which
was endorsed by the moral reflections that followed:
such sacrifices.' There is a faint but unmistakably
personal touch in the mention of his sacrifice, which
was endorsed by the moral reflections that followed:</p>

<blockquote><p>May your decision in the crisis through which you have
gone result in the best effect on your happiness and welfare:
and indeed, guided as you are by the wish to do right, and a
high sense of duty, I trust it cannot be otherwise. The change
of climate is all I fear, but Providence will overrule this, too,
for the best&mdash;in Him you can believe and in Him only. You
will want therefore neither solace nor support, though your
lot will be cast as a stranger in a strange land.</p></blockquote>

<p>He had asked for a farewell interview, and in this
same letter she gave him leave to come to Haworth and
say good-bye. It would be a pleasure to see him,
though that pleasure would be tinged with sadness.
He came&mdash;and he said good-bye.</p>

<p>But it is evident that she had expected something
different from this last interview, and her letter to Ellen
recording it is puzzled and surprised. She magnified
this appointment which he had 'reluctantly accepted'
into something tremendous. It was a 'post of honour
and danger' (though to open a branch in a publishing
house in Bombay does not seem desperately perilous),
and duty had compelled him to take it. Anyhow, 'he
has been and is gone, things are just as they were.
I feel there is a mystery about the transaction yet.' The
mystery really was that she could not make up her
mind whether she had done right in refusing him, and
she doubted it.</p>

<p>And then, curiously and characteristically, in order to
persuade herself of her wisdom in refusing him, she
now began to see his bad points. 'He looked much
older and thinner. I saw him very near and once
through my glass; the resemblance to Branwell struck
me forcibly, it is marked.' The lines in his face showed
'an inflexibility and, I must add, a hardness of character
which do not attract. As he stood near me, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
looked at me in his keen way, it was all I could do to
stand my ground tranquilly and steadily, and not to
recoil as before, and his manners were jarring.' But
already she found that 'his absence, and the exclusion
of his idea from her mind,' left a blank she had not
expected: at once she felt lonely and despondent. She
determined to wean her mind from the subject, but with
the very smallest measure of success, for her letters teem
with speculations about the little man. Something
perhaps had been said at that last interview as to whether,
when he returned, she would reconsider her decision,
but she doubted whether he could ever 'be acceptable
as a husband,' and found yet more reasons against it.
He had excellent and sterling qualities, but what discoveries
of his imperfections!</p>

<blockquote><p>I looked for something of the gentleman&mdash;something
I mean of the natural gentleman ... I could not find one
gleam, I could not see one passing glimpse of true good-breeding;
it is hard to say, but it is true. In mind too,
though clever, he is second-rate, thoroughly second-rate.
One does not like to say these things, but one had better be
honest. Were I to marry him my heart would bleed in pain
and humiliation. I could not, <i>could</i> not look up to him. No&mdash;if
Mr. Taylor be the only husband Fate offers to me, single
I must always remain. But yet at times I grieve for him and
perhaps it is superfluous, for I cannot think he will suffer
much; a hard nature, occupation and change of scene will
befriend him....</p></blockquote>

<p>Again she found from friends in London that his temper
left much to be desired; that was a point in favour of
her decision, but against that must be set the fact that
Mr. Brontë much liked him, and was extremely kind
when he said good-bye to him,</p>

<blockquote><p>exhorting him to be true to himself, his country and his
God, and wishing him all good wishes.... Whenever he
has alluded to him since it has been with significant eulogy.
When I alluded that he was no gentleman he seemed out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
patience with me for the objection.... I believe he thinks
a prospective union deferred for five years with such a
decorous reliable personage would be a very proper and
advisable affair.</p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps Mr. Brontë even expected an immediate engagement,
for he said that if she married now he would
give up the Parsonage and live in lodgings. Altogether
Charlotte found it a very puzzling business: she had
refused Mr. Taylor and found a peck of admirable
reasons for so doing, but she wondered if she had been
wise, and thought it better to refer the responsibility of
what she had done elsewhere. She had assured him of
the protection of Providence in Bombay, and Providence
had directed her also. 'Most true it is,' she wrote to
Ellen after she saw him for the last time, 'that we are
overruled by one above us&mdash;that in His hands our very
will is as clay in the hands of the potter.'</p>

<p>So Mr. Taylor&mdash;'stern and abrupt little man'&mdash;went
out to Bombay. He wrote to Charlotte a rather realistic
description of the processes of a Turkish bath, which he
had gone to see though not to indulge in. He might
have omitted, she thought, some of the details, but she
found his description amusing, and it tallied with what
Thackeray had said about the same pleasurable institution
in Grand Cairo. But she could not refrain from moral
reflections in her answer:</p>

<blockquote><p>The usage seems to me a little rough, and I cannot help
thinking that equal benefit might be obtained through less
violent means, but I suppose without the previous fatigue
the after-sensation would not be so enjoyable and no doubt
it is that indolent after-sensation which the self-indulgent
Mahomedans chiefly cultivate. I think you did right to
disdain it.</p></blockquote>

<p>She lamented, for his sake, 'the deficiency in all intellectual
attractions' at Bombay. She had not weaned him
even yet from her mind, for she wrote to Mr. Williams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
asking him for an 'impartial judgment' on his character,
and he spoke highly of him. But after that Mr. Taylor
seems to have written no more to her, and that made her
uneasy; she wondered whether the affair had come to
an end. Once more, though less poignantly than when
she waited to see whether the post brought her a letter
from M. Héger, she was on the alert for the arrival of
Indian mails, but still there was nothing for her, and
she confessed she was disappointed. Several times
Ellen asked if she had not heard, and eventually Charlotte
begged her not to refer to the subject again: 'All is
silent as the grave.' She never saw him again, for when
at the end of his five years in Bombay he returned to
England, she was dead.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<p>To return to <i>Shirley</i>. In that trying interval, before
its appearance, of proof correcting and waiting for publication,
Charlotte was in a high state of nervous tension.
The story had been read by three members of the Smith,
Elder firm (all of whom, of course, knew her identity,
but were bound to secrecy), and Mr. Williams had criticised
the whole presentation of the curates as being an
irrelevant piece of caricature. She replied that they were
positive photographs, they were as real as the Bible, they
were True, and Truth was better than Art. She refused
to give them up, but her real reason for retaining them
(and she must have known it) was that she could not
forgo the satisfaction of scarifying Messrs. Grant,
Smith and Bradley under disguises that would deceive
nobody, especially them. Once more she was extremely
anxious that her sex as author should not be suspected
by reviewers or by the public. She thought that a book
by a woman was judged with 'pitiful contempt,' and
hoped that <i>Shirley</i> would be considered so indubitably
male in style and treatment that any doubts (of which
there were already many) about the sex of the author of
<i>Jane Eyre</i> would be finally set at rest.</p>

<p>A more forlorn hope can scarcely be imagined, for
though, in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, Edward Rochester might be
thought to be the creation of a man, no male character
in <i>Shirley</i> could possibly be thought to be other than
the creation of a woman; no sign of a 'peard' can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
detected beneath their mufflers. But this longing to be
considered male was indeed an obsession with her, and
she thought that everyone was leagued together to
unmask her. Mr. Williams, for instance, in sending her
a packet of proofs for correction had not sealed the cover
securely, and it had been resealed at the General Post
Office in London, and then forwarded to Haworth.
Charlotte suspected in that a dark design against her
secret, and, forgetting that the packet had been resealed
in London, was convinced that it had been opened at the
Post Office in Keighley. This she was sure was the work
of 'prying curiosity.... The gossiping inquisitiveness
of small towns is rife at Keighley. Those packets
passing backwards and forwards by the post have
doubtless aggravated their curiosity.' But how she
could have thought that on the publication of <i>Shirley</i>
her incognito, not only of sex but of individuality, would
not instantly be given away, passes understanding,
for the book practically consisted of sketches, portraits
and caricatures of her immediate circle. She allowed
that she had seen and slightly knew the 'original' of
Cyril Hall, but averred that he would no more suspect
her of having 'put' him into a novel, or indeed of having
written a novel at all, than he would have suspected that
his dog had done so. But no sooner did the Rev. W. M.
Heald read <i>Shirley</i> than he correctly recognised himself
and half a dozen characters as well, and applied to Ellen,
as an intimate friend of the 'unknown Currer Bell'
(sending his respects also to Mr. Brontë so that there
could be no mistake about his meaning), for a key to the
others. Again, Charlotte had sent to one of the brothers
of her friend Mary Taylor, before publication, those
chapters of the book which related to the 'Yorkes,' in
which every single member of his family, father,
daughters (dead and alive) and sons were daguerrotyped:
his comment was that she had not drawn them strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
enough. Then there was Shirley herself, confessedly a
portrait of Emily Brontë; there were the photographed
curates; there was Mr. Nicholls in the unmistakable
guise of Mr. Macarthey; Hortense Moore was equally
photographic of Mlle. Haussé of the <i>pensionnat</i> at Brussels.
Yet even when the book was out, Charlotte wrote, as
Currer Bell, to G. H. Lewes, who was to review it in
the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, saying 'I wish you did not think
I was a woman.'</p>

<p>But it was no use wishing anything of the sort.
Charlotte, with an optimism she recognised to be ostrich-like,
had fondly hoped that if she hid her head in the
Parsonage she would be invisible, but her identity
leaked out in London, and poured out in spate at
Haworth. It could not possibly be otherwise: too
many pointers were directed there; besides, she had
made too many her confidants. Mr. Nicholls had his
lodgings at the house of John Brown the sexton, and,
when he read about himself, Mrs. Brown 'seriously
thought he had gone wrong in his head, as she heard
him giving vent to roars of laughter, clapping his hands
and stamping on the floor ... He would read all the
scenes about the curates aloud to papa, and triumphed
in his own character.'</p>

<p>Then there were the curates themselves; they had
often annoyed her, and to serve them out she had dipped
in her unkindest ink, and lavished on them all her powers
of contempt and ridicule. There was the master of the
Haworth Grammar School, once temporary curate to
Mr. Brontë, and him, under the unmistakable lineaments
of Mr. Donne, she had described as of 'a coldly
phlegmatic immoveably complacent densely self-satisfied
nature'; he was 'a frontless, arrogant, decorous slip
of the commonplace, conceited, inane, insipid.' She
libellously stated that he and the others met together for
drunken orgies: as a matter of fact the evenings that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
they spent together were passed in reading the Greek
Fathers.</p>

<p>But her whips and her scorpions were wasted.</p>

<blockquote><p>The very curates, poor fellows! [she dejectedly wrote to
Mr. Williams] show no resentment, each characteristically
finds solace for his own wounds in crowing over his brethren.
Mr. Donne was at first a little disturbed; for a week or two
he was in disquietude, but he is now soothed down: only
yesterday I had the pleasure of making him a comfortable
cup of tea and seeing him sip it with revived complacency.
It is a curious fact that since he read <i>Shirley</i> he has come
to the house oftener than ever, and been remarkably meek
and assiduous to please. Some people's natures are veritable
enigmas: I quite expected to have had one good scene with
him, but as yet nothing of the sort has occurred.</p></blockquote>

<p>The gilt was off the gingerbread. Charlotte had
meant and hoped and desired that these truly Christian
gentlemen should be hurt and indignant at her savage
attack on them, and she was truly chagrined at their
good humour; all she could make of it was that each
was so delighted with the venom she expended on his
friends that he forgave her for himself. They were
enigmas; it was puzzling and disappointing to find
them so indulgent. She wanted to hurt them. That
she ever knew that her friend Mary Taylor wrote to
Ellen from New Zealand saying that it was rumoured
that Charlotte Brontë had been jilted by the three curates
one after the other is improbable.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Charlotte would
not have been amused.</p>

<p>But though these insensitive creatures had treated her
attack on them with such good humour, it was otherwise
with her and the unfavourable reviews of <i>Shirley</i>, of
which there were a good many that made her writhe,
as she had hoped the curates would do. She was
furious with their malice and their lies. She pronounced
the critic of the <i>Daily News</i> to be to the last degree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>'incompetent, ignorant and flippant.' His review was
unutterably false: it was revolting to be judged by such
a creature. The <i>Observer</i> was equally trying; such praise
as it bestowed was more mortifying than its blame.
The 'thundering <i>Times</i>' attacked her fiercely, and it
made her cry. The notice in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> was
'brutal and savage.' G. H. Lewes had, as she knew,
written this, and he had committed the unpardonable
crime of talking about her sex. So she sent him a
brief note: 'I can be on my guard against my
enemies, but God deliver me from my friends.' On
the other hand, critical praise gave her the same
quality of childish rapture as critical blame gave her
of childish resentment. Just as her detractors were
liars and revolting dunces, so the admirers of <i>Shirley</i>
were splendid in ability and discernment. Harriet
Martineau and Mrs. Gaskell, neither of whom she had
at present met, were among these by reason of their
appreciation, and she considered them 'far her superiors
in attainment and experience.' For Miss Martineau she
had 'a lively admiration, a deep esteem,' while Mrs.
Gaskell's praise, conveyed in a letter 'brought tears to
my eyes. She is a good, she is a great woman. Proud
am I that I can touch a chord of sympathy in souls so
noble.' Then there was Eugène Forçade, who had
already spoken highly of <i>Jane Eyre</i><a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>: he wrote a
review of <i>Shirley</i> in the <i>Revue des deux Mondes</i>, and it
was refreshing to turn from the mouthings of the entirely
ignorant and incompetent to one 'whose heart feels,
whose power grasps the matter he undertakes to handle.'
He praised <i>Shirley</i> warmly, and therefore he was 'a
subtle-thoughted, keen-eyed, quick-feeling Frenchman,
who knew the true nature of things.'</p>

<blockquote><p>He follows Currer Bell [she wrote to Ellen, to whom she
sent this review] through every winding, discerns every point,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>discriminates every shade, proves himself master of the
subject, and lord of the aim. With that man I would shake
hands, if I saw him. I would say, 'You know me, Monsieur,
I shall deem it an honour to know you.' I could not say so
much to the mass of English critics.</p></blockquote>

<p>Forçade, she reiterated to Mr. Williams, found no coarseness
in <i>Shirley</i>; that was the discovery reserved for
smaller minds. Or an anonymous correspondent wrote
in a strain of wild enthusiasm about <i>Shirley</i>: 'there
is power in that letter&mdash;talent, it is at times eloquently
expressed.' The press she was sure, when she thought
of the unfavourable reviews, was a venal concern; only
praise was sincere and heartfelt. Those who saw faults
in her work were not only mistaken but moral reprobates,
abounding in malice and falsehood; those who appreciated
it were not only discerning persons but good and
great. All this enthusiasm for the enthusiastic, this
spitting on the scornful is indicative of just that essentially
youthful fire which Charlotte, like Swinburne,
always possessed. Her intolerance, her blacks and
whites, her rare but unqualified raptures, her censoriousness,
were all typical of adolescence. As Sir Edmund
Gosse acutely remarked (rather shocking the Brontë
Society), she never grew up, nor acquired the kindly
indulgence of the mature mind, off which the jagged
egoistic edges have been smoothed by the wholesome
wear and tear of the world.</p>

<p>Soon after <i>Shirley</i> appeared, Charlotte again turned
her mind to <i>The Professor</i>, which had lain on her
shelf since her publishers had dissuaded her from expanding
it into three-volumed form. But now she
contemplated bringing it out as it stood, and wrote a
preface to it. Not a word of her intentions, so far as
we can find in her letters, did she communicate to anyone;
nor is there the slightest allusion to the subject
when she discusses plans with her publishers. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
after her death her husband, Mr. Nicholls, consented to
the publication of <i>The Professor</i>, and it appeared in
1856 with the preface that Charlotte had written for it,
and an explanatory note in which he stated these facts,
adding: 'Being dissuaded from her intention, the
authoress made some use of the material in a subsequent
work <i>Villette</i>.' It is possible that the 'dissuasion' of
which Mr. Nicholls speaks should refer to the occasion
when, after the publication of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, she contemplated
expanding <i>The Professor</i> into three volumes, and
that now she wrote the preface and abandoned her
intention again, for Mrs. Gaskell does not mention it in
her <i>Life of Charlotte Brontë</i>, nor can we find any allusion
to this second intention elsewhere.</p>

<p>With regard to the book <i>Shirley</i> itself, its faults
are many and patent, and it cannot be put in the
same class as <i>Jane Eyre</i> or <i>Villette</i>. <i>Jane Eyre</i> had its
faults too, but in the white-hot furnace of its sincerity
and passion, they were utterly consumed, appearing
momentarily like specks of black in the glow of it, and
then perishing. But there is no such incandescent
quality in <i>Shirley</i>: <i>Shirley</i> was observed rather than
felt, and Charlotte never got into the living heart of her
work as she did with <i>Jane Eyre</i> and <i>Villette</i>.</p>

<p>She took immense trouble with it; she strained and
agonised and doubted over it. But she wrote it from
the outside, not the inside, and, paradoxical though it
sounds, this very industry and this painstaking copying
of her models are the cause of the lower level on which
the book moves; study takes the place of inspiration,
and observation is not fused and made molten in the
furnace of imagination. Again, she wanted to inculcate
certain truths, such <i>imprimis</i>, as the supreme splendour
of equal love between man and woman; but whereas in
<i>Jane Eyre</i> she took the live coal in the tongs from
off the altar of its burning, in <i>Shirley</i>, donning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
fatal vestments of the preacher, she ascended the
pulpit and discoursed, with anathemas, on the world's
sordid view of love. She declaimed her gospel, instead
of presenting without comment, as in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, the
evangelists of love. Never was there so hieratic a
homily as Caroline Helstone's pronouncement and her
colloquy with Shirley. Says Caroline:</p>

<blockquote><p>'Obtrusiveness is a crime; forwardness is a crime, and both
disgust: but love!&mdash;no purest angel need blush to love!
And when I hear or see either man or woman couple shame
with love I know their minds are coarse, their associations
debased. Many who think themselves refined ladies and
gentlemen, and on whose lips the word &#8220;vulgarity&#8221; is for
ever hovering, cannot mention &#8220;love&#8221; without betraying their
own innate and imbecile degradation: it is a low feeling in
their estimation, connected only with low ideas for them.'</p>

<p>'You describe three-quarters of the world, Caroline.'</p>

<p>'They are cold,&mdash;they are cowardly&mdash;they are stupid on the
subject, Shirley! They never loved&mdash;they never were loved.'</p>

<p>'Thou art right, Lina! And in their dense ignorance they
blaspheme living fire, seraph-brought from a divine altar.'</p>

<p>'They confound it with sparks mounting from Tophet.'</p></blockquote>

<p>All very true no doubt. But did two girls ever talk
so unnaturally and so gratuitously, for nothing has
occurred to warrant these diatribes? Charlotte was in
the pulpit, preaching not creating, and, incidentally,
punishing those who found coarseness in <i>Jane Eyre</i>,
and putting into the mouth of her characters the precise
phrases with which she had scolded them in her letters.
She was lecturing on love, justifying her view of it.
The same spirit of irrelevant propaganda, again in defence
of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, inspires her indignation against the unfair
treatment which she thought that women novelists
received.</p>

<blockquote><p>Their (men's) good woman [cries Shirley] is a queer thing,
half-doll, half-angel; their bad woman almost always a
fiend. Then to hear them fall into ecstasies with each other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>'s
creations, worshipping the heroine of such a poem-novel-drama,
thinking it fine&mdash;divine! If I spoke all I think on this
point; if I gave my real opinion of some first-rate female
character, in first-rate works, where should I be? Dead,
under a cairn of avenging stones in half an hour. Women
read men more truly than men read women. I'll prove that
in a magazine paper some day when I have time....</p></blockquote>

<p>Charlotte, through the mouthpiece of <i>Shirley</i>, is merely
venting her views on the literary arena.</p>

<p>It is this same personal motive which, with similar
punishment in view, turns her presentation of the
curates into sheer caricature. They had annoyed her,
and her intention was to give them 'what for,' taking
in her hand not the rapier of satire but the bludgeon of
abuse. These were grotesque puppets which she set
up, in order to knock them down, and her observation
of them was falsified by personal antipathy. These outbursts
of propaganda and vituperation are pieces of
rubbish which might have perished in the consuming
heat of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, but in <i>Shirley</i> there is no such
reverberating furnace. Louis Moore, Shirley's preordained
mate, personifying man's ideal love for woman,
is so falsetto a troubadour that, frankly, romance withers.
The love-scenes are largely conveyed by means of his
highly rhetorical diary instead of by direct narrative;
Charlotte invites the reader to stoop over her shoulder
and read what he scribbles: 'Since Shirley has appealed
to my strength,' he writes, 'I abhor solitude. Cold
abstraction&mdash;fleshless skeleton&mdash;daughter&mdash;mother and
mate of Death!...' Shirley was shy, 'but to my perception
a delicate splendour robed her.... I looked
like a stupid block, I dare say: I was alive with a life of
Paradise, as she turned <i>her</i> glance from <i>my</i> glance, and
softly averted her head to hide the suffusion of her
cheek.' Louis Moore retails page after page of dialogue
between his mistress and himself, and it is all tinsel an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>d
froth compared with the gleams of those deep waters of
passion that move us so profoundly when Jane Eyre
and Rochester are together. For their simplicity we get
eloquence: Louis calls her 'Sister of the spotted, bright,
quick-fiery leopard,' and after great fireworks, with the
sun 'a dizzying scarlet blaze' and the sky 'a violet
vortex,' there is a dismal descent of the rocket stick,
and Shirley having accepted him, says (quite in the
Jane Austen style):</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Moore, your judgment is well balanced; your heart
is kind; your principles are sound. I know you are wise;
I feel you are benevolent; I believe you are conscientious.
Be my companion through life; be my guide where I am
ignorant, be my master where I am faulty; be my friend
always.</p></blockquote>

<p>The same fault, that of mere external observation,
marks and mars Charlotte's presentation of Shirley
herself. She confessedly meant Shirley in this volume
of 'sketches from the life' to be the full-length portrait
of her sister Emily. She noted and reproduced traits
that were characteristic of Emily, such as her long
abstracted musings on the moor as she gazed into some
pool. She gave Shirley the fierce and devoted Tartar
who would not stand a blow, in reproduction of Emily's
Keeper; Shirley's refusals to admit she was ill were a
trait of Emily's, as Charlotte was bitterly aware ('<i>She</i> say
she is ill! I believe, sir, if she were dying, she would
smile and aver &#8220;Nothing ails me&#8221;'); the story of Shirley
being bitten by a dog, and cauterising the wound with
a hot iron is also traditionally ascribed to Emily, but all
these traits and incidents are observed only, and when
it comes to that fusion of observation and penetration
through which is produced a portrait not a photograph,
we find that Charlotte has not penetrated; she has never
got to the heart of Emily, to the genius that made her
what she was, and not one glimpse of that mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
soul is really revealed to us. In nothing is this more
plain than in Charlotte's attempt to render, through
Shirley's mouth, Emily's attitude towards Nature, that
pagan pan-theistic mysticism, that sense of the immanent
and unifying Divinity in man and beast and moor, which
glows and throbs in her poems. Charlotte could discover
the poems themselves, but secret for ever from
her was the inspiration of them, and her attempt to
reproduce it was less photograph than parody. In
Shirley's famous rhapsody Charlotte definitely set
herself to unveil Emily's soul.</p>

<blockquote><p>Nature is now at her evening prayers: she is kneeling
before those red hills. I see her prostrate on the great steps
of her altar, praying for a fair night for mariners at sea, for
travellers in deserts, for lambs on moors, and unfledged
birds in woods. Caroline, I see her! and I will tell you
what she is like: she is like what Eve was when she and
Adam stood alone on earth.... I saw&mdash;I now see&mdash;a woman
Titan: her robe of blue air spreads to the outskirts of the heath,
where yonder flock is grazing: a veil white as an avalanche
sweeps from her head to her feet, and arabesques of lightning
flame in its borders. Under her breast I see her zone, purple
like that horizon; through its blush shines the star of evening.
Her steady eyes I cannot picture: they are clear, they are
deep as lakes&mdash;they are lifted and full of worship&mdash;they
tremble with the softness of love and the lustre of prayer.
Her forehead has the expanse of a cloud and is paler than the
early moon, risen long before dark gathers; she reclines her
bosom on the ridge of Stilbro' Moor; her mighty hands
are joined beneath it. So kneeling, face to face she speaks
with God. That Eve is Jehovah's daughter, as Adam was
his son.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now we may differ about the beauty and the force of
this passage; some may find it a piece of exquisite
English, others a patch of rather shrill purple, but all
must agree that, as a rendering of Emily's mysticism, it
is a failure. Nor could it have been otherwise, for
Charlotte had no touch of the mystic in her religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
perceptions; and the very strength and sincerity of them
made it impossible for her to comprehend a rapture to
which her soul was alien. When she attempted to
express it, her speech betrayed her.</p>

<p>But hear Emily:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He comes with western winds, with evening's wandering airs,</span>
<span class="i0">With that clear dusk of heaven that brings the thickest stars,</span>
<span class="i0">Winds take a pensive tone and stars a tender fire,</span>
<span class="i0">And visions rise and change, that kill me with desire.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But first a hush of peace&mdash;a soundless calm descends,</span>
<span class="i0">The struggle of distress and fierce impatience ends:</span>
<span class="i0">Mute music soothes my breast&mdash;unuttered harmony,</span>
<span class="i0">That I could never dream till Faith was lost to me.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then dawns the Invisible: the Unseen its truth reveals,</span>
<span class="i0">My outward sense is gone, my inward essence feels.</span>
<span class="i0">Its wings are almost free&mdash;its home, its harbour found,</span>
<span class="i0">Nearing the gulf it stops&mdash;and dares the final bound.</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! dreadful is the check&mdash;intense the agony&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">When the ear begins to hear, and the eye begins to see,</span>
<span class="i0">When the pulse begins to throb, the brain to think again:</span>
<span class="i0">The soul to feel the flesh, and the flesh to feel the chain.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is the true voice; the expression may fail
because the singer tells of things ineffable, but behind
is the experience of the mystic's sacramental communings,
of his almost losing his identity because he is so nearly
made one with God immanent, of his racked return to
himself as to a prison, when the splendour fades. None
but a mystic could have written that, and all Charlotte's
talent could not enable her to reproduce, with any
wealth of poetical imagery, the faintest semblance of it.
In this attempt to reveal Emily she only reveals her own
incomprehension of her.</p>

<p><i>Shirley</i> is often spoken of as Charlotte's memorial to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Emily. That is not quite the case, for nearly two-thirds
of the book, down to the chapter entitled 'The Valley of
the Shadow of Death,' were written before her death.
She began it after hesitations as to whether to recast
<i>The Professor</i> in three-volume form, as soon as <i>Jane
Eyre</i> was off her hands; thus, while Anne was using
Branwell as a model in <i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i>,
Charlotte was using Emily in <i>Shirley</i>. Then her work
was interrupted by Emily's rapid decline in the autumn
of 1848 and not taken up again till after Anne's death
in May 1849. Charlotte found this break exceedingly
difficult to bridge over, and it is permissible to wonder
whether there was not a change of plan at this point
in the book. Louis Moore, though the story was two-thirds
done, had only made his first appearance a couple
of pages before; it looks as if his wooing and winning
of Shirley was possibly an afterthought. Already the
book had faltered; for several chapters before the break
no development takes place at all; Caroline Helstone's
love story hung fire, a school-feast, a guying of the
curates were obvious padding; it is as if Charlotte was
feeling her way, uncertain of her direction. Then after
the break she made up her mind, and the book moves
swiftly to its appointed end.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<p>Charlotte went up to London in December of the year
1849 to stay with her young publisher George Smith
and his widowed mother. Mrs. Smith, she tells Ellen,
appeared to have received strict orders to pay her the
greatest attention; morning and evening there was
a fire in her bedroom and wax candles, and she felt she
inspired respect and alarm in her hosts. It was not till
this wore off that she perceived that real friendliness was
at the bottom of these sybaritic arrangements, and she
'began to like' Mrs. Smith; her son also impressed her
more favourably than he had done at first sight, and
she acknowledged that she saw no reason to regret her
decision to make her principal stay with them instead of
going, after a day or two, to the house of Laetitia
Wheelwright, who had been a school friend at Brussels.
By now she was known to be Currer Bell and no more
concealment or vain hopes that her books would be
taken as products of a male brain were possible.</p>

<p>From this time onwards she ceased to be a hermit at
Haworth, for in the few years that were to elapse before
her marriage, she paid four visits to London, she went
twice to Scotland, though once only for a single night,
and she stayed with new-found friends in the Lakes, Sir
James Kay-Shuttleworth and Miss Harriet Martineau
(to whom she formed a violent attachment, and as
violently brought it to a sudden close). She also
formed a warm and cordial though never an intimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
friendship with Mrs. Gaskell, and stayed with her at
Plymouth Grove, Manchester.</p>

<p>Moreover, high fame was personally hers; pilgrims
came to Haworth to follow the topography of her books
and get a word from the author. More especially in
London the literary world was intensely curious about
her, eager to be friendly with her and to make her the
lioness at home in circles whose appreciation she most
coveted. But fame had come too late for her enjoyment;
she had been through bitter waters and the salt still clung
to her, or perhaps she had always lacked the ease which
springs from geniality. She could not let herself go;
her shyness and her self-consciousness were by now an
inveterate disease. To be brought up against an unfamiliar
face, even if it shone with kindliness, was always
discomforting; she distrusted strangers and was always
apt to notice their defects before their qualities, and a
further misery-making quality in her temperament lay
in the habit of thought which suggested that others
saw the worst in her. She noticed, for instance (or
thought she noticed), that if any man got a good look at
her, he would take pains, after that, to avert his eyes
from the quarter of the room in which she sat. The
natural reaction followed those uncomfortable fancies;
she never credited the casually encountered stranger with
goodwill towards her. Nowadays we should call this
instinct an inferiority complex dating from her schooldays,
when it had been impressed on her that she was
ugly and insignificant. Indeed, she designedly and auto-biographically
made these physical disabilities a feature
in <i>Jane Eyre</i>. This morbid self-consciousness, this
lack of geniality, and a complete absence of any social
effervescence made for her one of the most unfortunate
equipments for general intercourse, in the rôle of lioness,
that it is possible to conceive.</p>

<p>There was a certain underlying ungraciousness also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
that unfitted her for the part; at times she was silent
and miserable, at times she roared in a manner socially
devastating. Twice during this visit she was taken to
see Macready act and subsequently wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>I astonished a dinner-party by honestly saying I did not
like him. It is the fashion to rave about his splendid acting&mdash;anything
more false and artificial, less genuinely impressive
than his whole style I could scarcely have imagined; the
fact is, the stage system altogether is hollow nonsense, they
act farce well enough, the actors comprehend their parts and
do them justice. They comprehend nothing about tragedy
or Shakespeare, and it is a failure. I said so, and by so saying
produced a blank silence, a mute consternation. I was,
indeed, obliged to dissent on many occasions, and to offend
by dissenting. It seems now very much the custom to
admire a certain wordy, intricate, obscure style of poetry,
such as Elizabeth Barrett Browning writes. Some pieces were
referred to about which Currer Bell was expected to be very
rapturous, and failing in this he disappointed.... I think I
should scarcely like to live in London, and were I obliged to
live there, I should certainly go little into company, especially
I should eschew the literary coteries.</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, Mr. Smith brought together a dinner-party of
critics, five of them, representing leading papers, in
her honour. She 'enjoyed the spectacle of them greatly,'
but fixed a deadly eye on Mr. Chorley.</p>

<blockquote><p>He is a peculiar specimen&mdash;one whom you could set
yourself to examine, uncertain whether, when you had probed
all the small reserves of his character the result would be
utter contempt and aversion, or whether for the sake of latent
good you would forgive obvious evil. One could well
pardon his unpleasant features, his strange voice, even his
very foppery and grimace, if one found these disadvantages
connected with living talent and any spark of genuine goodness.
If there is nothing more than acquirement, smartness,
and the affectation of philanthropy, Chorley is a fine
creature.</p></blockquote>

<p>One wonders what the fine creature thought of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
silent little lady who drew such deadly conclusions from
his small-talk.</p>

<p>But, it must be again repeated, it was chiefly her
shyness that, by making her miserable in the presence of
strangers, rendered her ill-disposed to them; it was like
some acute physical pain which renders abominable all
that is experienced while it is in possession. Not being
herself at ease, her own discomfort led her to lay the
blame of it on them, even though the meeting had been
desired and looked forward to on both sides. This was
very markedly so in the case of Thackeray, for whom,
before she met him, she had a wild hero-worship comparable
with that which, in the days of her childhood,
she had cherished for the Duke of Wellington. He was
unique, he was a Titan, he was the legitimate high priest
of Truth, and 'a hundred years hence the thoughtful
critic, looking down on the deep waters, will see his
work shining through them, the pearl of great price.
He is alone in his power, alone in his simplicity, alone
in his self-control.' He was a great knight-errant
gloriously tilting against and triumphantly overthrowing
the pomps and empty pretensions of the world, with
his burnished spear of noble-hearted satire.</p>

<p>Reality based on such glowing expectations was
almost bound to prove a disappointment, and the first
meeting seems to have been a dreadful fiasco. Thackeray
was invited to dine at Mrs. Smith's to meet her, but
Charlotte had been out all morning, she had missed her
lunch, and by seven o'clock exhaustion and the excitement
of meeting him had made 'savage work' of her.
It must have been by her own wish that he was not
introduced to her before dinner, but he came up and
shook hands.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Afterwards he talked to her a little,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>but she could hardly reply to him at all; everything
was 'dreamlike.' 'Had I not been obliged to speak,'
she wrote to Mr. Williams, 'I could have managed well,
but it behoved me to answer when addressed and the
effort was torture&mdash;I spoke stupidly.' Unfortunately
this meeting had been arranged in order that, at her wish,
she might get to know Thackeray, so speech could
hardly be avoided. But speech being torture, she chiefly
listened, and, alas, she found his talk 'very peculiar, too
perverse to be pleasant'; he was 'cynical, harsh and
contradictory.' The torture of her own shyness, coupled
with the self-conscious sense that something 'brilliant,
eccentric and provocative was expected of the author of
<i>Jane Eyre</i>' made her critical of him. Though still an
intellectual Titan, he lost something of his moral stature,
and the glamour began to fade from his work as well.</p>

<blockquote><p>I have come to the conclusion [she wrote to Mr. Williams]
that whenever he (Thackeray) writes, Mephistopheles stands
on his right hand and Raphael on his left: the great doubter
and sneerer usually guides the pen; the Angel noble and
gentle, interlines letters of light here and there. Alas,
Thackeray, I wish your strong wings would lift you oftener
above the smoke of cities into the pure region nearer heaven.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The preacher, we fear, who was never very far from
Charlotte's right hand, held the pen for her there, and
when she next saw Thackeray in London in June 1850,
he inspired her tongue. Her shyness had worn off, and,
no doubt to his extreme astonishment, she went for the
Titan.</p>

<blockquote><p>He made a morning call, [she wrote to Ellen] and sat about
two hours. Mr. Smith only was in the room, the whole
time. He described it afterwards as a 'queer scene,' and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>I suppose it was. The giant sat before me: I was moved
to speak to him of some of his shortcomings (literary, of
course); one by one the faults came into my mind, and one
by one I brought them out, and sought some explanation or
defence. He did defend himself like a great Turk and heathen;
that is to say the excuses were often worse than the crime itself.
The matter ended in decent amity; if all be well I am to dine
at his house this evening.</p></blockquote>

<p>A queer scene indeed! Only once before had he
met her, and then she was too awe-struck with him to
utter more than a syllable; now for two hours he was
in the dock before this ferocious little lady, who cross-examined
him on his literary misdeeds and poured scorn
on the pleading which only aggravated his offence. It
must have been in some trepidation that he looked
forward to that evening, for who could tell whether she
might not again arraign him before the distinguished
company whom he had honoured with an invitation to
come in after dinner and see the great authoress? But
there was no real fear of that; the presence of strangers
exercised the usual paralysing effect on her. She was
more tongue-tied than she had been on the first occasion
of their meeting, and there ensued the most ghastly
party ever recorded in the melancholy history of social
pleasure.</p>

<p>Lady Ritchie, Thackeray's daughter (whose admirable
account of it I follow), was present throughout the
evening.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> To her and her sister, then young girls, the
occasion was of the most thrilling, for they had surreptitiously
dipped into <i>Jane Eyre</i>, which, though
chiefly unintelligible, was highly stimulating. Her
father went down to the front door to receive his guest,
and in she came, escorted by him and Mr. Smith, 'in
mittens, in silence, in seriousness,' tiny and hardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>reaching up to Thackeray's elbow. She was somewhat
grave and stern, thought Lady Ritchie, especially 'to
forward little girls who wished to chatter'; evidently
Charlotte remembered, from the governess days, the
necessity and the difficulty of repelling the rude
familiarities of children. Then, after this family dinner,
the brilliant company began to assemble. Mrs. Crowe
who wrote <i>The Nightside of Nature</i> was there, and
Thomas Carlyle and his wife, Mrs. Proctor and her
husband, Barry Cornwall (who, so rumour had once
said, were the joint authors of <i>Jane Eyre</i>) and their
daughter, Adelaide Anne Proctor, who wrote <i>The Lost
Chord</i> and other poems.</p>

<blockquote><p>Everyone waited (says Lady Ritchie) for the brilliant
conversation which never began at all. Miss Brontë retired
to the sofa in the study and murmured a low word now
and then to our kind governess, Miss Truelock. The room
looked very dark, the lamp began to smoke a little, the
conversation grew dimmer and more dim, the ladies sat
round still expectant, my father was too much perturbed by
the gloom and the silence to be able to cope with it at all.
Mrs. Brookfield who was in the doorway by the study near
the corner in which Miss Brontë was sitting, leant forward
with a little commonplace, since brilliance was not to be the
order of the evening. 'Do you like London, Miss Brontë?'
she said; another silence, a pause, then Miss Brontë answered
'Yes and no,' very gravely....</p></blockquote>

<p>It is indeed little wonder that, after the lioness had gone,
Thackeray quietly let himself out of his house and spent
the rest of the evening at his club, quite unable to face
his other guests. One is sorry for them for having had
so poor an entertainment, one is especially sorry for the
host, but most of all for Charlotte. Further acquaintance
with Thackeray in later visits to London, even now that
she was no longer shy of him, was productive only of
ironical comments on his faults. She went to a lecture
of his at which the audience was 'the cream of London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
society,' and she was surprised that he noticed her at all,
when so many 'admiring duchesses and countesses were
seated in rows before him.' When he asked her afterwards
if she had enjoyed it, she found this harmless
inquiry over-eager and naïve. And what a snob!</p>

<blockquote><p>He postponed his next lecture at the earnest petition of
the duchesses and marchionesses who, on the day on which
it should have been delivered, were necessitated to go down
with the Queen and Court to Ascot races. I told him I thought
he did wrong to put it off an their account&mdash;and I think so
still....</p></blockquote>

<p>Then there was a fancy dress ball given by the Queen,
and the</p>

<blockquote><p>great lords and ladies have been quite wrapt up in preparation
for this momentous event. Their pet and darling, Mr.
Thackeray, of course, sympathizes with them. He was here
yesterday to dinner and left very early in the evening in order
that he might visit respectively the Duchess of Norfolk, the
Marchioness of Londonderry, Ladies Chesterfield and Clanricarde,
and see them all in their fancy costumes of the reign
of Charles II before they set out for the Palace.... Amongst
others the Lord Chancellor attended his last lecture, and Mr.
Thackeray says he expects a place from him: but in this I
think he was joking. Of course Mr. T. is a good deal
spoiled by all this, and indeed it cannot be otherwise.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was a sad disenchantment, but indeed she was
on the alert for disenchantment, and there underlies
her criticism of him an uneasy jealousy of one who could
enjoy his success while she could not enjoy her own.
Thackeray offered to introduce her to galaxies of great
folk who would receive her with open arms, but she
thought '&#8220;society&#8221; produced so ill an effect on him
that she had better avoid it.' She can no longer find
an agreeable trait in him, and when Mr. Smith sent her
an engraving of his portrait by Lawrence, she noticed
that 'the expression of <i>spite</i>, most vividly marked
in the original, is here softened.' And his work also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
did follow him into the darkness of her disapproval.
She went to his lecture on Fielding: it was 'a painful
hour,' and she had nothing but horror for his lightness
over evil and drunken ways. Branwell, of course, was
still bitterly and hardly in her mind, but there was more
cavilling than criticism in her indignation with the
lecturer: anyone would think that Thackeray had made
an impassioned address exhorting every young man to
take to drink without further delay.</p>

<blockquote><p>If only once [she wrote] the prospect of a promising life
blasted at the outset by wild ways had passed close under his
eyes, he <i>never</i> could have spoken with such levity of what
led to its piteous destruction. Had I a brother yet living,
I should tremble to let him read Thackeray's lecture on
Fielding. I should hide it away from him. If in spite of
precautions it fell into his hands, I should earnestly pray
him not to be misled by the voice of the charmer, charm he
never so wisely.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then Mr. Smith sent her an early copy of the first
volume of <i>Esmond</i>, and though, when she had finished
the whole, she was generous in praise, her first instinct
was to find fault with Thackeray's motives.</p>

<blockquote><p>But what bitter satire, [she writes] what relentless dissection
of diseased subjects! Well, and this too is right, or would
be right, if the savage surgeon did not seem so fiercely pleased
with his work. Thackeray likes to dissect an ulcer or an
aneurism, he has pleasure in putting his cruel knife or probe
into quivering, living flesh. Thackeray would not like all
the world to be good; no great satirist would like society
to be perfect.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was indeed seldom in this new world of London,
which so cordially opened its arms to her in welcome
and admiration, that she registered agreeable first
impressions of anybody: she was unchanged in that
respect from the days when she had first seen in M. Héger
an insane tom-cat and a delirious hyena. But Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
Harriet Martineau was an exception. Charlotte was
predisposed in her favour, for she had enjoyed <i>Deerbrook</i>
and, writing to her before her first visit to London
in the name of Currer Bell, expressed the 'pleasure and
profit he has derived from her works,' and sent her
a copy of <i>Shirley</i>. This erasure of the pronoun of
sex was evidently intentional, for Charlotte meant to
disclose herself, and Miss Martineau, firmly grasping
the idea, wittily addressed her envelope of reply to
'Currer Bell, Esq.,' but began her letter 'Dear Madam.'
Then the spirit of social comedy took this promising
situation in hand. Currer Bell, on going up to London
for that first visit in which Thackeray stocks went down,
wrote to Miss Martineau that 'he' was in town and
would like to see her. There was a small party, all eager
to see Currer Bell, but, before he-she arrived, a male
guest six feet high was announced, and the party thought
this was Currer Bell. Then Currer Bell arrived, and,
disclosing herself indistinctly to the footman, she was
announced not as 'Miss Brontë,' but as 'Miss Brogden,'
and there entered, so Miss Martineau wrote, 'the
smallest creature I had ever seen except at a fair.' There
for the present the budding friendship stayed, to burst
out into amazing bloom a year afterwards.</p>

<p>Meantime, before Charlotte met Miss Martineau again,
other friendships had been forming; that with Sir James
Kay-Shuttleworth, an eminent doctor now retired and
rewarded with a baronetcy, had features peculiarly
characteristic of Charlotte's almost comical inability to
let herself go, easily and naturally. He was certainly
a lion-hunter, and his persistent stalking must have been
tiresome, but his amiability was undefeated. He and
his wife appear first on the stage among those who
'came boring to Haworth on the wise errand of seeing
the scenery described in <i>Jane Eyre</i> and <i>Shirley</i>' They
insisted that she should spend a few days with them at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Gawthorpe, their place on the borders of East Lancashire,
and, since Mr. Brontë would not hear of her refusing,
she was left 'without plea or defence.' The baronet
was a fine-looking man and quite 'unpretending,' but,
with her habitual prejudice against strangers which, in
spite of her resolutions, remained as robust as ever,
Charlotte had fears that he might not be what he
seemed. 'I wish he may be as sincere as he is polished,'
she wrote. 'He shows his white teeth with too frequent
a smile, but I will not prejudge him.' So to Gawthorpe
with some misgiving she went. The embarrassment of
being obliged to talk, which wrecked her first meeting
with Thackeray, was spared her, since 'the dialogues
(perhaps I should say monologues, for I listened far
more than I talked) by the fireside in his antique oak-panelled
drawing-room, while they suited him, did not
too much oppress and exhaust me.' He was not at all
well, his nerves were very sensitive and the state of his
health 'exaggerated sensitiveness into irritability.' Still
he was gracious and dignified, and his 'tastes and feelings
were capable of elevation.' Then there was Lady
Shuttleworth, rather handsome, without any pretensions
to 'aristocratic airs,' frank, good-humoured and active,
but 'truth obliges me to say that, as it seems to me,
grace, dignity, fine feeling were not in the inventory of
her qualities.' Charlotte liked the German governess
better than anyone in the house, and had heart-to-heart
talks with her. She was well treated 'for a governess,'
but said she was homesick, 'and wore the usual pale,
despondent look of her class.'</p>

<p>So the visit passed off not amiss, but, writes Charlotte,</p>

<blockquote><p>the worst of it is, that there is now some menace hanging
over my head of an invitation to go to them in London during
the season.... This was his (Sir James's) theme when I was
at Gawthorpe. I then gave notice that I would not be
lionised.... I shall probably go. I know what the effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
and what the pain will be, how wretched I shall often feel,
how thin and haggard I shall get, but he who shuns suffering
will never win victory. If I mean to improve, I must strive
and endure. The visit will, however, be short, as short as
I can possibly make it; would to God it was well over!
I have one safeguard. Sir James has been a physician, and
looks at me with a physician's eye: he saw at once that I
could not stand much fatigue nor bear the presence of many
strangers. Papa is restless and eager for me to go, the idea
of a refusal quite hurts him.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is something truly pathetic about this letter.
It shows us what real torture she suffered from her
morbid shyness and self-consciousness, and how she
strove to get the better of them. But if there had been
a serious operation hanging over her head, instead of
a short visit to London, and it was doubtful if she could
stand the shock, she could not have spoken more
apprehensively of it. It becomes easy to understand how
her first impressions of strangers were always disagreeable,
for they were, so to speak, the surgeons and nurses
who conducted the operation; only the anæsthetist
was lacking. But, in spite of the prospective pain, she
meant to face it, and there was true courage, for that
which to others would be a pleasant experience was to
her a real agony. At other times the flesh was weak, and
in order to justify on moral grounds her profound
hatred of sojourning among strangers, she says that
'indiscriminate visiting leads only to a waste of time and
a vulgarising of character ... besides' (as an afterthought)
'it would be wrong to leave papa often.' But
papa on this occasion was 'quite hurt' at the thought
of her refusing.</p>

<p>Further menaces were brewing. The persevering
baronet now proposed that she should go up with him
and his wife to London by road, and stay at several of his
relations' houses on the way. Providence thwarted that
more formidable plan; Mr. Brontë was ill, Charlotte did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
not like to leave him, and with solemn thankfulness
she records her relief. 'I cannot say that I regret
having missed this ordeal: I would as lief have walked
among red-hot ploughshares.' Eventually she got out
of staying with them at all, and when she went to London
in June 1850, she stopped at the more familiar house of
her publisher instead. But Sir James called with
agonising proposals. 'To my great horror he talks of
my going with them to Hampton Court, Windsor, etc.
God knows how I shall get on, I perfectly dread it.'
But she escaped from that snare of the fowler.</p>

<p>It was on this visit to London that Charlotte, as
we have seen, arraigned and dined with Thackeray;
she also saw the idol of her childhood, the Duke of
Wellington; she sat to George Richmond the artist for
the crayon portrait of her which Mr. George Smith
commissioned and gave to her father, and which was
bequeathed to the nation by her husband and now hangs
in the National Portrait Gallery. She also met G. H.
Lewes for the first time, whom she had taken to task for
his review of <i>Shirley</i>. She confessed that she felt
'half sadly, half tenderly' towards him, his face almost
moved her to tears, so wonderfully it resembled Emily's;
'in consequence, whatever Lewes does or says, I believe
I cannot hate him.' There was less of social entertainment
on this visit, and less lionising, and in consequence
she enjoyed it more than her first. But what she called
'a trying termination' of it remained, which she looked
forward to with apprehension, but enjoyed enormously.
This was an expedition to Edinburgh with her young
publisher, George Smith, who was six or seven years
younger than she, and it showed a daring disregard of
the Victorian conventions of 1850, for she went there
alone with him and his sister without any middle-aged
chaperon at all, feeling that 'my seniority and lack of
all pretensions to beauty, etc., are a perfect safeguard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>'
The expedition was a glorious success; she found
music and magic at Melrose and Abbotsford, and London
'compared to Dun-Edin, &#8220;mine own romantic town,&#8221;
is prose compared to poetry or as a great rumbling,
rambling heavy epic compared to a lyric, brief, bright,
clear, and vital as a flash of lightning.' The Scotch,
too, had grand characters and that gave Scotland its
charm and greatness.</p>

<p>She went back from Scotland to Haworth, where she
stayed a month; it was like the return home after
Anne's death. 'There was a reaction,' she wrote,
'that sunk me to the earth: the deadly silence, solitude,
desolation, were awful; the craving for companionship,
the hopelessness of relief, were what I should dread to
feel again.' She was morbidly oppressed with the
sense of the shortness of life, and of 'the sickness, decay,
the struggle of spirit and flesh' that must come before
the end of it. Her father was anxious about her health;
this caused, she thought, the gloomy thoughts that
assailed her, and made a canker in her mind, and she
entreated him not to worry about her.</p>

<p>In turn she was anxious about him, and two people
worrying about each other, with little or no external
diversion, brews a deadly atmosphere. Charlotte's
nerves were frayed, she had no literary project on hand
and she dwelt morbidly on the past, and thus grew
apprehensive about the future. 'I think grief,' she
writes, 'is a two-edged sword, it cuts both ways: the
memory of one loss is the anticipation of another.'</p>

<p>Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth, robbed of Charlotte's
visit to him in London, now urged her to come and
stay with him at a house he had taken near Bowness on
Lake Windermere, and again Mr. Brontë, who by no
means wanted her always to be with him at Haworth,
said that her refusal to go would much annoy him.
Her dutifulness was rewarded, for it was now she met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Mrs. Gaskell for the first time and a friendship and a
correspondence began which, though never intimate,
lasted to the end of Charlotte's life. There was already
a mutual predisposition, for Mrs. Gaskell had written
to Charlotte in praise of <i>Shirley</i>, and Charlotte had
therefore settled she was a great and a good woman.
Now these pleasant expectations were realised: Charlotte
found her a kind and cheerful companion of high talent.
Mrs. Gaskell also was attracted and interested: Charlotte's
shyness and silence struck her first, and the
absence of 'any spark of merriment.' But her well-meaning
host still could not do right, for he took
Charlotte for a drive in a carriage to see the beauties of
the Lake country. That sounds harmless, but no&mdash;she
writes to Miss Wooler: 'Decidedly it does not agree
with me to prosecute the search of the picturesque in
a carriage; a waggon, a spring-cart, even a post-chaise
might do, but the carriage upsets everything.' But
could poor Sir James have foreseen this fatal flaw?
Even if he had, and if he had sent Charlotte out in a
waggon, she would surely have founded an even graver
complaint at being supplied with so unusual a conveyance.
It was not really the carriage that worried her;
it was the presence of other people and her own self-consciousness.
She was afraid of growing in any degree
enthusiastic, and thus drawing attention to the 'lioness,
the authoress, the artist.' Not till her next visit to
the Lakes, in the winter, when she stayed with Miss
Martineau and fell victim to her robust charm, did she
realise Sir James's kindly intentions. 'I begin to admit
in my own mind,' she wrote, 'that he is sincerely
benignant to me.'</p>

<p>She went back home at the end of August, and was, as
usual, much cheered by an article in the <i>Palladium</i>, by
Sidney Dobell, entitled 'Currer Bell,' which expressed
the warmest admiration not only for <i>Jane Eyre</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
<i>Shirley</i>, but for <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. It revived, however,
the suggestion that <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>The Tenant
of Wildfell Hall</i> were also of Currer Bell's authorship.
Mr. Williams had seen this article, and he now wrote
to Charlotte proposing to reissue <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
and <i>Agnes Grey</i> in one volume, with a biographical
notice by her which should make known the history
of the three pseudonyms. Emily and Anne were
dead, and there was no longer any reason why the
mystery should not be authoritatively dispelled. He also
made some suggestion about reissuing <i>The Tenant of
Wildfell Hall</i>. Charlotte was opposed to that: she did
not think the book should be preserved. Anne had
written it under a strange, conscientious, half-ascetic
notion of accomplishing a painful penance and a severe
duty: it had better drop out of existence. But she
warmly favoured the other suggestion, only the book
must be republished by Smith, Elder and not by its
original publisher, Newby. She also decided to make
a selection from her sisters' manuscript poems, not
hitherto published, and issue them in the form of an
appendix.</p>

<p>She set to work at once, and before the end of September
a rough copy of the 'Biographical Notice' was in the hands
of her publisher. She described, with a simplicity she
rarely attained, Emily's last illness; none can read that
page unmoved, so sincere and heart-broken is the regret
and the anguish for those estranged days that inspired it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Never in all her life had she lingered over any task that
lay before her, and she did not linger now. She sank
rapidly, she made haste to leave us. Yet while physically
she perished, mentally she grew stronger than we had yet
known her. Day by day, when I saw with what a front she
met suffering, I looked on her with an anguish of love and
wonder. The awful point was that while full of ruth for
others, on herself she had no pity: the spirit was inexorable
to the flesh: from the trembling hand, the unnerved limbs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
the faded eye, the same service was exacted as in health. To
stand by and witness this and not dare to remonstrate was a
pain no words can render....</p></blockquote>

<p>Truly, if Charlotte was reaping the hardness she had
sown, she made expiation in that bitter harvesting.</p>

<p>Then, when the 'Biographical Notice' was finished,
Charlotte read <i>Wuthering Heights</i> over again, and wrote
a Preface regarding it to this new edition. She tells
us that she has now got a clear glimpse of its faults,
and craves indulgence for them:</p>

<blockquote><p>Had she (Emily) but lived, her mind would have grown
like a strong tree, loftier, straighter, wider-spreading, and its
matured fruits would have attained a mellower ripeness and
sunnier bloom, but on that mind time and experience alone
could work.</p></blockquote>

<p>But we stare incredulous at such a conclusion.
What does it mean? It is as if Charlotte predicted
that some dryad of the moor, in whose eyes shone
the knowledge of things veiled and primeval, would
be tamed by time and experience into losing her
elemental quality, and be thereby ripened and mellowed.
Surely, had Emily lived, exactly the opposite must have
happened. What more would have been revealed to
her by the 'Strange Power' that inspired her we cannot
tell, for the ways of genius are past finding out, and its
paths in the dark waters through which it alone can lead
us, but any such development as Charlotte predicted
must have been to the detriment of that supreme quality.
She missed all that <i>Wuthering Heights</i> stands for:
she shuddered at its 'horror of great darkness,' she
wished to cease 'to breathe lightning,' not knowing
that the darkness and the lightning are It; and,
apologising for them, she pointed out 'those spots
where clouded daylight and eclipsed sun still attest their
existence.' Eagerly, defending the book, she calls our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
attention to 'the homely benevolence of Nelly Dean,'
to the 'constancy and tenderness of Edgar Linton':
Emily <i>could</i> render such, and had she lived she would
have developed her power further in that regard. But
when it came to the true genius of the book, namely the
loves of Heathcliff and Catherine, that soaring of fierce
eagles out of sight, or to the passionate mystical yearning
for the unsheathed beauty of the world, for the wakening
and being satisfied with it, she was blind: Emily's
'descriptions of natural scenery are what they should be,
and all they should be.' As for the eagles, Heathcliff
'stands unredeemed ... except for his faint regard
for Hareton,' and his 'half implied esteem for Nelly
Dean'; his love for Catherine 'is a passion such as
might boil and glow in the bad essence of some evil
genius!' All she can say for Catherine is that 'she is
not destitute of a certain strange beauty in her fierceness,
or of honesty in the midst of her perverted passion and
passionate perversity.' Such was her estimate of the
book when loyally and lovingly she tried to appreciate
and understand it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There is scarcely in the whole history of the family
a more heart-rending picture than that which Charlotte
paints of herself sitting in the dining-room of the
Parsonage, in a loneliness which her occupation accentuated
and rendered the more intolerable, and going
through her sisters' papers. She spent hours peering
into the minutely written manuscripts, selecting the
poems to be published, and writing little lost explanatory
notes: in one she said, 'the Genius of a solitary region
seems to address his wandering and wayward votary';
in another, 'the same mind is in converse with a like
abstraction'; in another, 'the wakened soul struggles to
blend with the storm by which it is swayed....' As in
her portrait of her sister in <i>Shirley</i>, as in her Preface,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
these notes are mere external observations; Emily is
beyond her. She had thought, she wrote to Mr. Williams,
that this intellectual exertion would rouse her mind from
the sense of despairing loneliness, but it was not so.
All turned to memory; memory was 'both sad and
relentless.'</p>

<blockquote><p>The reading over of papers, the renewal of remembrance
brought back the pang of bereavement, and occasioned a
depression of spirits well-nigh intolerable. For one or two
nights I scarcely knew how to get on till morning; and when
morning came I was still haunted with a sense of sickening
distress.</p></blockquote>

<p>She breakfasted with her father, she worked alone,
and alone she walked on the moors on days of autumn
sunshine 'with solitude and memory for companions,
and Heathcliff haunted every glen and hollow.' She
sat down to her solitary dinner, for Mr. Brontë dined
by himself, and soon after the early closing in of the
shortening days began to darken. Now she must put
her work aside, for her eyes would not stand the strain
of deciphering these scripts by candle-light; also she
dared not work in the evening for fear of the sleepless
nights that followed. Rainstorms swept over the
garden and glimmering tombstones of the graveyard,
and she drew the curtains across the panes, but still the
voice of the wind called from without, as of Cathy
wailing 'Let me in!' and fingers tapped at the pane.</p>

<p>Memory; everything was memory, and all memories
were bitter. The silent house was astir with ghosts,
and these lonely evening hours were the worst of all,
for they were those in which once there had been
excitement and eager talk over plans, over literary
ambitions, over projects for keeping a school. The
horror grew, and perhaps she would take her knitting into
the kitchen and talk with Tabby for an hour; then,
still alone, she supped and fed Anne's or Emily's dogs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
whose mistresses had not yet returned, unless it was
their voices in the wind from the moors. Mr. Brontë
went early to bed, winding, as he passed, the clock on
the stairs, whose ticking could be heard throughout
the house; but Charlotte sat up till midnight, for where
was the use of lying lonely in the dark? As one of
those rare visitors to Haworth wrote to Mrs. Gaskell,
it seemed 'that joy can never have entered that house
since it was first built.'</p>

<p>Such was the autumn of 1850.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

<p>As soon as this new edition of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
and <i>Agnes Grey</i> was out of her hands, Charlotte went
to pay a long-promised visit to Miss Martineau. She
lived at Ambleside, but had been away when Charlotte
was staying with Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth in the
summer, and they had not met since she had been introduced
a year ago as 'Miss Brogden.' Instantly she
succumbed to the breezy, efficient, rather masculine
charm of her new friend, who had the most vivifying
effect on her after the desolate, memory-haunted autumn.
'She is a great and a good woman,' she wrote to Ellen,
'of course not without peculiarities, but I have seen
none as yet that annoy me.... Miss Martineau I relish
inexpressibly.' It was her tremendous vitality that was
so bracing and admirable, and not less her mental
vigour. She was up at five in the morning, and after
a cold bath took a walk by starlight, and had finished
breakfast and got to work by seven.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The morning
was spent in solitude; they walked and talked till
dinner; and after Miss Martineau conversed 'fluently
and abundantly,' and sat up for a couple of hours after
Charlotte had gone to bed at ten, writing letters. Charlotte
wrote to her father with the same rare unqualified
enthusiasm:</p>

<blockquote><p>As to Miss Martineau I admire her and wonder at her more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>than I can say. Her powers of labour, of exercise, and social
cheerfulness are beyond my comprehension. In spite of the
unceasing activity of her colossal intellect, she enjoys robust
health. She is very kind to me, though she must think I am
a very insignificant person compared to herself.</p></blockquote>

<p>To Mr. Williams she wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>Her animal spirits are as unflagging as her mental powers.
It gave me no pain to feel insignificant, mentally and corporeally,
in comparison with her.</p></blockquote>

<p>To another friend she wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>She is certainly a woman of wonderful endowments, both
intellectual and physical, and though I share few of her
opinions, and regard her as fallible on certain points of judgment,
I must still accord her my highest esteem. The manner
in which she combines the highest mental culture with the
nicest discharge of feminine duties filled me with admiration,
while her affectionate kindness earned my gratitude.</p></blockquote>

<p>To Mr. Taylor she wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>I find a worth and greatness in herself, and a constancy,
benevolence, perseverance in her practices, such as wins the
sincerest esteem and affection. She is not a person to be
judged by her writings alone, but rather by her own deeds
and life, than which nothing can be more exemplary and
nobler. Faults she has, but to me they appear very trivial
weighed in the balance against her excellences.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is scarcely a qualifying phrase in these enthusiasms:
Charlotte let herself go in almost undiluted appreciation.
She had never admired any woman so unreservedly
since the days of her adolescent passion for Ellen, and
it was almost as if the sunshine of the morning,
long obscured and eclipsed, had returned to her and
warmed her into uncritical enjoyment. Moreover,
Charlotte could render her an intellectual homage such
as she had never been able to accord to Ellen, and this
homage was at present reciprocated, for Miss Martineau
greatly admired <i>Jane Eyre</i> and <i>Shirley</i>, 'and,' wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
Charlotte, 'while she testifies affectionate approbation,
I feel the sting taken away from another class of critics.'</p>

<p>Miss Martineau told Mrs. Gaskell two little anecdotes
about this visit which, though she relates them as
independent, may have had a connection. She had
mesmeric powers (or as we should say now, hypnotic
powers), and Charlotte constantly urged her to mesmerise
her. This she refused to do, thinking that Charlotte
was in a low nervous condition and that harm might
come. She made excuse, saying again and again that
she was tired. But there came a day when she could
not plead fatigue, and Charlotte 'fell under the influence.'
In other words, she began to go into a light trance, and
Miss Martineau stopped. Soon after Miss Martineau
had to give a lecture: Charlotte sitting sideways to her
never took her eyes off her, and when the lecture was
over came and stood by her, and in Miss Martineau's
'very voice' repeated the words from Shakespeare
which she had quoted, 'Is my son dead?' They went
home in silence, and again Charlotte staring at her said,
'Is my son dead?' The two stories seem connected;
it looks as if some hypnotic influence had been established
which renewed itself when Charlotte fixed her
eyes on Miss Martineau.</p>

<p>She returned to Haworth, having spent Christmas
with this tonic and marvellous friend, vastly restored,
rather severe on herself for having been so feeble as to
need a change, and full of critical impressions. She had
been to see Mrs. Arnold, widow of Dr. Arnold, and
her family at Fox How, and had surveyed them with
a magisterial eye. Mrs. Arnold was good and amiable,
but intellect was not her strong point, and her manner at
first lacked genuineness and simplicity. The daughters
were like her both in their qualities and their defects;
'their opinions on literary subjects were rather imitative
than original, rather sentimental than sound.' Matthew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Arnold's manner was 'displeasing from its seeming
foppery,' and Charlotte regarded him at first with
'regretful surprise: the shade of Dr. Arnold seemed to
me to frown on his young representative.' Also his
theological opinions were very vague and unsettled, but
he like the rest of the family improved upon acquaintance:
the unfavourable first impression had only been the effect
which strangers always had on her. Then Amelia
Wooler came in for some rough handling. She had
written Charlotte a letter full of 'claptrap sentiment and
humbugging attempts at fine writing.' Also she had
asked for Wordsworth's, Southey's, Miss Martineau's,
and Charlotte's autographs: this showed that the 'old
trading spirit' was still alive.</p>

<p>Then there were matrimonial subjects to be discussed
with Ellen: Mr. James Taylor at this time, in spite of
discouragement, was prosecuting his suit, and Charlotte
at present felt well-disposed to him. There are also
allusions to a younger man, not named, but certainly to
be identified with her young publisher, George Smith,
with whom she had made that daring expedition to
Scotland. Ellen's badinage (there is no other word for
it) on this subject was frightfully arch, for she alluded
to him and Charlotte as Jupiter and Venus, and Charlotte,
evidently highly delighted, bade her have done with this
'heathen trash.' Towards him she was more than well-disposed,
perhaps she was a little in love with him, for
Jupiter, encouraged by the success of the Scottish visit,
had proposed to Venus that she should make a trip up
the Rhine with him, and she wrote to Ellen: 'I am not
made of stone, and what is mere excitement to him is
fever to me.... I cannot conceive either his mother
or his sisters relishing it, and all London would gabble
like a countless host of geese.' Her common sense told
her that it would never do to marry him, even if he
proposed to her. There was a great difference of fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
between them, and it was part of her creed that there
should be approximate equality of means between
husband and wife; also he was considerably younger
than she, and 'personal regard and natural liking do
not compensate for that.' She writes with admirable
wisdom: 'I am content to have him as a friend, and
pray God to continue to me the common sense to look
on one so young, so rising, so hopeful in no other
light.' But there the matter stayed, and there is no
kind of reason to suppose that George Smith ever did
propose to her.</p>

<p>Very soon a trial tested that high adoration for
Miss Martineau, but it stood firm. She, in collaboration
with Mr. Atkinson, published early in February 1851
a book called <i>Letters on the Nature and Development
of Man</i>. Though it is impossible to suppose that
Charlotte, after all those long intimate talks with her,
had no inkling of what Miss Martineau's theological
opinions were, the publication of them shocked her a
good deal. Making allowance for the fact that she often
worked herself up, when pen in hand, to exaggerated
statements of her feelings, it is evident that she was much
upset.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is the first exposition of avowed Atheism and Materialism
[she wrote] that I have ever read: the first unequivocal
declaration of disbelief in the existence of a God or a Future
Life I have ever seen.... Sincerely&mdash;for my own part&mdash;do
I wish to find and know the truth, but if this be truth,
well may she guard herself with mysteries and cover herself
with a veil. If this be Truth, Man or Woman who beholds
her can but curse the day he or she was born....</p></blockquote>

<p>Again she wrote: 'I deeply regret its publication for
the lady's sake: it gives a death blow to her future
usefulness. Who can trust the word or rely on the
judgment of an avowed atheist?' But shocked though
she was, she did not let this crucial division on religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
questions put an end to the friendship, and she continued
to correspond with her.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> She got into her head,
though quite mistakenly, that Miss Martineau's friends
were as shocked as herself and that they had, one and
all, refused to have anything more to do with her. So
she determined to stick to her and, when questioned by
Miss Wooler as to the wisdom of friendship with an
atheist, wrote a characteristic homily in reply:</p>

<blockquote><p>I do not feel it would be right to give Miss Martineau up
entirely. There is in her nature much that is very noble.
Hundreds have forsaken her, more I fear in the apprehension
that their fair name may suffer if seen in connection with hers
than for any pure conviction, such as you suggest, of harm
consequent on her fatal tenets. With these fair weather
friends I cannot bear to rank. And for her sin, is it not one
of those which God and not man must judge?... If you
had seen how she secretly suffers from abandonment, you
would be the last to give her up: you would separate the
sinner from the sin, and feel as if the right lay rather in quietly
adhering to her in her strait, while that adherence is unfashionable
and unpopular, than in turning your back when
the world sets the example.</p></blockquote>

<p>These are certainly very creditable sentiments, and evince
a much larger charity than Charlotte sometimes showed;
but we wonder whether she really meant that nobody
'could trust the word of an avowed atheist.' Anyhow,
the friendship continued, and she sent Miss Martineau
favourable comments which she had received on her
book, with the intention of cheering her Coventry. But
Miss Martineau, rather disconcertingly, was not in the
least in need of being cheered. She referred to
Charlotte's notion that her friends had forsaken her as
'an unaccountable delusion': the book which Charlotte
had averred had given the 'death blow to her
usefulness' had only earned for her a new world of
sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>The depression of solitude and silence at Haworth
returned. Mr. James Taylor had his final interview,
which left the situation as it was, and Charlotte began
to reckon up what had happened. He would be absent
for five years; 'a dividing expanse of three oceans'
would come between them; and though it was entirely
of her own choice that anything divided them any more
at all, she regretted what she had done, in spite of the
excellent reasons for refusing him, of which she found
more, and Ellen's 'soft consolatory accents' did not
console her. Her father was not well, and she felt that
having him to think about 'took her thoughts off other
matters, which have become complete bitterness and
ashes.' The 'seeming foundation of support and prospect
of hope' had completely crumbled away with
James Taylor's departure to India, and there was nothing
again to look forward to.</p>

<p>And then, amazingly and uniquely (though only
briefly), a new interest enlivened her: dress. She was
soon to pay a month's visit to Jupiter and Jupiter's
family in London, and she wanted all sorts of things:
chemisettes of small size, and a new bonnet, and in
particular a lace mantle to 'go with' a black satin dress.
She had bought a black lace mantle, but it looked 'brown
and rusty' over the satin, and she exchanged it for a
white one, which looked better and was also cheaper,
for it cost only £1 14<i>s.</i> She went to Leeds to buy a new
bonnet to wear with the black satin, but when she tried
it on 'its pink lining looked infinitely too gay.' Then
she wanted a new dress: there were 'beautiful silks of
pale sweet colours, but they were five shillings a yard,'
so she chose black silk at three shillings. For the
moment Charlotte was violently concerned with her
frocks.</p>

<p>These vanities being duly provided, Charlotte went up
to London again, at the end of May 1851, to stay with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
her publisher and his mother and sisters for a solid
month. Everyone was disposed to make much of her:
she breakfasted at the house of Mr. Rogers the 'patriarch
poet'; she was asked to a big party at Grosvenor House
but declined; she attended Thackeray's lectures, and,
though Thackeray did not repeat the experiment of
getting together a party to meet her, he pointed her out
to 'his grand friends,' and Lord Carlisle and Monckton
Milnes introduced themselves. When one of these
lectures was over, so Mrs. Gaskell tells us, the audience
formed up in two lines and she had to pass down an
aisle between rows of eager and interested faces. She
retailed these social triumphs to her father and Ellen
with considerable gusto: one cannot but think that in
her heart, especially when they were over, they gave her
a good deal of satisfaction, but at the time her shyness
and self-consciousness discounted them. She was not
well, she suffered from headache and sickness, and she
felt inclined to murmur at Fate, 'which compels me to
comparative silence and solitude for eleven months in
the year, and in the twelfth, while offering social enjoyment,
takes away the vigour and cheerfulness which
should turn it to account.' Her malaise caused her to
make some severe remarks about certain of these entertainments.
She went to a meeting of a Roman Catholic
Society, at which Cardinal Wiseman presided. He had
a quadruple chin, a large mouth with oily lips betokening
greed. 'He came swimming into the room, smiling,
simpering and bowing like a fat old lady, and sat down
very demure in his chair, the picture of a sleek hypocrite.'
Dark-looking, sinister priests surrounded him; he spoke
in a smooth, whining voice like a canting Methodist
preacher. A horrid spectacle, but she certainly enjoyed
telling Ellen about him. She went to see Rachel act:</p>

<blockquote><p>a wonderful sight, terrible as if the earth has cracked deep
at your feet, and revealed a glimpse of hell. She made me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
shudder to the marrow of my bones: in her some fiend has
certainly taken up its incarnate home. She is not a woman,
she is a snake, she is the &mdash;&mdash;.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rachel made a deep and horrible impression on her;
months afterwards, writing to Mr. Taylor in Bombay,
she compared her acting to 'the poisoned stimulants to
popular ferocity' of gladiatorial shows. 'It is scarcely
human nature that she shows you: it is something
wilder and worse: the feelings and fury of a fiend. The
great gift of genius she undoubtedly has: but, I fear she
rather abuses it than turns it to good account.'<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>Then there were visits to the Crystal Palace, no less
than five of them. It impressed her immensely; it
was like a bazaar created by Eastern genii, and arranged
by supernatural hands. But it palled: it soon became
a bustling and fatiguing place, and she did not want to
go so often but was forced to. Her last days in London
were spoiled because Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth, from
whom she had hitherto concealed her presence, discovered
her, and it was hard to ward off his eager
hospitalities.</p>

<p>The chronicle of these pleasures reads but drearily.
She had made valiant efforts to overcome that deplorable
killjoy shyness which turned normal social intercourse
into torture, but they seemed unavailing, and her
health could not stand the cheerful stir and bustle which
is in itself so enjoyable to others, but which, getting on
her nerves, caused her to look with a jaundiced eye
on what others found entertaining. We must not
therefore imagine, as certain of her biographers state,
that except for the sense of duty and filial piety which
kept her at Haworth she would have led a brilliant life
in London, the centre of some high literary circle. She
disliked London, and she affirmed that if she had
to live there she would studiously avoid literary circles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>London life was impossible for her; a few weeks of it
was as much as she could stand, and after that, according
to her own rueful picture of herself, she returned home
meagre and old and hollow-eyed. Besides, it was at
Haworth only she was able to write, and writing was to
her the sole panacea for the weary fret of life, and for
the morbid melancholy that so often beset her. Once
only again did she spend a holiday in London, and then
she avoided what she had learned, by repeated experience,
gave her more discomfort than pleasure.</p>

<p>On her way home she spent two days at Plymouth
Grove, Manchester, the house of Mr. and Mrs. Gaskell,
and there suddenly a new trait of tenderness towards
children manifested itself. In her governess days, perhaps
because she could not manage them, perhaps because
they formed part of a <i>milieu</i> she detested, she had certainly
not cared for them, and shrank from their tokens
of affection. But now, as if surprised at and distrustful
of her own unwonted feelings, she wrote to Mrs. Gaskell
after her visit, asking her to manage 'to convey a small
kiss to that dear but dangerous little person Julia. She
surreptitiously possessed herself of a minute fraction of
my heart, which has been missing ever since I saw
her.' It was a diffident, humble access; she 'felt like
a fond but bashful suitor who views at a distance the
fair personage to whom in his slavish awe he dare not
risk a near approach.' She felt a stranger to children.</p>

<p>Charlotte got home by the beginning of July, and set
to work on her new book. As may be remembered,
she had thought of following up <i>Jane Eyre</i> with an
expanded version of <i>The Professor</i>, and had also
thought, after the publication of <i>Shirley</i>, of bringing
it out as it stood, and even wrote a preface for it, but
nothing came of it. But she had never personally
abandoned the idea of using much of the material in a
future book, and she now did so in the writing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
<i>Villette</i>. Instantly, as always before, she found
healing for her despondence and depression in the exercise
of her imagination; her letters to her friends much
diminish in volume and in vividness, for all her energy
was being poured into her work. It went well, for she
was handling the molten stuff of her experiences in
Brussels which was still live fire; she got on quickly,
and hoped to have the book ready for publication in the
spring of the next year, 1852.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> She refused to leave
Haworth in spite of invitations from Miss Martineau,
Mrs. Gaskell and Ellen Nussey, for while the wind of
imagination blew she must sail before it. None of the
usual causes for dissatisfaction prevailed against her.
Tabby got influenza and Martha quinsy, and she nursed
them both; her father got a cold; Keeper, Emily's
dog, died; but all burdens were light when her work
prospered.</p>

<p>Then in the winter her health broke down, and she
had many weeks of illness and enforced idleness; headaches
and bilious attacks continually prostrated her;
her letters are a catalogue of miserable symptoms and
ineffectual remedies. The spring brought improvement,
but when she tried to get to work again, the happy
inspiration of the autumn would not return, and, as she
wrote to Mr. Williams, 'When the mood leaves me
(it has left me now, without vouchsafing so much as
a word of a message when it will return) I put by the
MS. and wait till it comes back again.' For more than
four months this barrenness persisted; she slept ill at
night, and sat idle all day, longing to work but unable,
and afraid sometimes that the pain she suffered was a
symptom of the disease of which her four sisters and her
brother had died. Then at last the blessed mood
returned, and before the end of March she was at work
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>There was no visit to London this summer; in June
she went to Filey, close to Scarborough, partly for the
sake of sea-air, partly in order to see to the re-lettering
of the stone over Anne's grave. She must have heard
that there were some errors on it (and indeed found five),
for she referred to this as a duty that had long lain heavy.
For some reason she felt that she had to be alone for
this task of piety; why, it is impossible to say. Ellen
had been with her at Scarborough when Anne died,
and she doubtless would have accompanied her now,
but Charlotte did not even let her know that she contemplated
going, writing her when she had got there
a mysterious and rather melodramatic letter, beginning:</p>

<blockquote><p>I am at Filey utterly alone. Do not be angry, the step is
right. I considered it and resolved on it with due deliberation.
I walk on the sands a good deal, and try not to feel
desolate and melancholy. How sorely my heart longs for
you, I need not say.</p></blockquote>

<p>But she only had to tell Ellen she wanted her, and Ellen
would have come; clearly she just did not want anybody's
company, and having discharged her duty to the tombstone
stayed there for three weeks in great tranquillity
and content. She bathed and it seemed to brace her;
she walked along the sands for three or four hours every
day, as she had been told that this was good for a torpid
liver, and became as sunburnt as a bathing-woman. She
watched a rough sea with awe and admiration, she saw
a dog battling with the waves, she set out to go to
Filey Bridge but was frightened back by two cows,
she went to church at some small and shabby tabernacle,
and could hardly help laughing at the ludicrous seating
arrangements, for the singers in the gallery turned their
backs on the congregation, and the congregation on the
parson. She wished Mr. Nicholls had been there to
see it; he would certainly have laughed out, and she sent
him her kind regards. Her letters in her utter loneliness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
were full of good spirits and cheerfulness, and this first
kindly mention of Mr. Nicholls is significant.</p>

<p>She was back at Haworth in July, and had a serious
fright about her father, who was threatened with a
stroke of apoplexy. He was dangerously ill for a while,
but made a steady though slow recovery, and once more
Charlotte got to work on <i>Villette</i>, resolved not to quit
her labours, but not to hurry them, till the book was
finished. There were fits of depression when her work
went ill, in which she confessed that she was lonely and
likely to remain lonely, but denied, still wondering
whether she had been right to refuse Mr. Taylor, that
the thought of continuing 'single' was the cause of them.
She felt she would neither 'know nor taste pleasure'
until the book was finished, and worked steadily on,
refusing for some weeks to let Ellen come to Haworth
or to interrupt herself by going to her. Before the end
of October she had sent two of the three volumes to
her publishers, asking for criticisms. She admitted,
when she received them, that there was something in
them, and then refused to alter a single word. She could
not write otherwise, as she had told Mr. Williams before,
and she must write in her own way or not at all. But
she was in an agony of nervous apprehension about the
whole; she even wanted the book to be published
anonymously. Then by the end of November the long
task was finished, and she said her prayers.</p>

<p>She was still all to bits with the strain of her accomplished
work and, not less, with the reaction that
followed, for receiving from her publishers her cheque
of £500 payable on delivery of the complete manuscript
without a line of comment on the third volume, she
instantly made up her mind to rush up to London and
see whether this silence betokened disapproval. The
letter came next morning, and Charlotte scolded George
Smith soundly for not having sent it with the cheque,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
reminding him that 'Inexplicable delays should be avoided
when possible, for they are apt to urge those subjected
to their harassment to sudden and impulsive steps.' As
for his criticisms on the third volume, she pronounced
them just, and took no further notice of them.</p>

<p>Charlotte was right in not attempting to alter the book;
she could no more have done that than she could have
added a cubit to her stature, for <i>Villette</i>, to a far higher
degree than anything she had ever written, was herself,
and it was composed of her own experience, her character
and her soul. The book, once written, was as real and
as inevitable as the past on which it was founded.
Technically, <i>Villette</i> has grave faults; it lacks unity;
the interest is shifted from one set of characters to
another, Lucy Snowe falls in love with Dr. John, and
when she discovers that he regards her with absolute
indifference, she falls in love with Paul Emmanuel, who,
though this affair is the <i>clou</i> of the book, hardly appears
till we are half-way through. All this had been pointed
out to Charlotte, but the book was written indelibly with
her heart's blood and it could not be otherwise. For
into it she had put, and now was done with, the bitterness
of that second year at Brussels, which had robbed
her of all peace of mind for two years. Now she
externalised these miseries, and by the alchemy of her
art transmuted her pangs into pictures, and even as once
she in her own person had sought relief from them in the
chapel of St. Gudule's under the seal of confession, so
now under the seal of fiction she told the world what
she had told a priest, and was rid of the perilous stuff.
With minute detail and with photographic fidelity she
reproduced the <i>pensionnat</i> in the Rue d'Isabelle, and made
eternally substantial the phantoms which for her haunted
its corridors. Her imagination fused and made molten
the actual, and the third volume of <i>Villette</i>, enacted
by Lucy Snowe, Paul Emmanuel, and Madame Beck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
could never have been written had it not been for the
adventure of Charlotte Brontë, Constantin Héger, and
Madame. Whether or no she actually muttered <i>Je me
vengerai</i> to that lady when she left Brussels for the last
time, she had kept these things in her heart, even as she
had nursed there the miseries of Cowan Bridge, speaking
of them to no living soul; and now releasing them she
took her revenge, and wrote immortally of them.
Long as she had waited, Madame Héger had to wait
longer yet for the justification of her spyings and suspicions
as set forth in <i>Villette</i>; and it was not till
sixty years later, when all those immediately concerned
had long been dead, that there were published the four
letters of Charlotte's to Madame Héger's husband, which
she had picked out of the waste-paper basket and
pieced together. They were quits.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<p>It was in December 1852, when <i>Villette</i> was going
through the press, that the final act in the drama of
Charlotte's life began. It started in storm and trouble,
it ended with a spell of such tranquil happiness as she
had never known.</p>

<p>Mr. Nicholls had now been curate at Haworth for
over eight years, and Charlotte had often alluded to him
with disparagement and dislike. His narrowness of
mind was what chiefly struck her; he was just a 'highly
uninteresting narrow and unattractive specimen of the
coarser sex,' she could not see the germs of goodness
which Ellen perceived in him. The parishioners
generally shared her view, and they hoped that when he
went for his holiday to Ireland he would not trouble to
return. But by the time she was writing <i>Shirley</i> she
regarded him with a kindlier eye, and in her presentation
of him as Mr. Macarthey, which amused him so
enormously, she allowed that he was 'decent, decorous
and conscientious.' Now for some months she had
suspected that 'he cared something for me and wanted
me to care for him.' Her father, she thought, had
suspected the same, and alluded to his low spirits and
ill-health with 'much indirect sarcasm.' Charlotte
wondered if Ellen, who was sometimes too quick to
observe the earliest symptom of the love-lorn, had
noticed this too. Ellen had: she had already been
scolded by Charlotte for her prospective match-making.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p><p>One evening in December Mr. Nicholls came to tea
with her and her father in Mr. Brontë's study.</p>

<blockquote><p>After tea, [she wrote to Ellen] I withdrew to the dining-room
as usual. As usual, Mr. Nicholls sat with papa till
between eight and nine o'clock. I then heard him open the
parlour door, as if going. I expected the clash of the front
door. He stopped in the passage: he tapped: like lightning
it flashed on me what was coming. He entered, he stood
before me. What his words were you can guess: his manner
you can hardly realize, nor can I forget it. Shaking from
head to foot, looking deadly pale, speaking low, vehemently
yet with difficulty, he made me for the first time feel what it
costs a man to declare affection when he doubts response.</p></blockquote>

<p>Charlotte promised him a reply next day, and when
he had gone, she went to her father and told him what
had happened. A Bedlamite scene followed.</p>

<blockquote><p>If I had <i>loved</i> Mr. Nicholls, [she wrote] and had heard such
epithets applied to him as were used, it would have transported
me past my patience; as it was, my blood boiled
with a sense of injustice. But papa worked himself up into
a state not to be trifled with: the veins on his temples started
up like whipcord and his eyes became suddenly bloodshot.
I made haste to promise him that Mr. Nicholls should on the
morrow have a distinct refusal.... Attachment to Mr.
Nicholls, you are aware, I never entertained, but the
poignant pity inspired by his state on Monday evening
by the hurried revelation of his sufferings for many months,
is something galling and irksome.</p></blockquote>

<p>This was not a promising beginning of a love affair,
for the lady, so she protested, had not the slightest feeling
of affection towards her suitor, and her father got blood
to the head at the notion of her marrying him.
Normally, therefore, one would have thought that, when
Mr. Nicholls thereupon resigned his curacy, the affair
was finished; as a matter of fact, it had barely begun.
Unsoftened by Charlotte's promise that she would not
marry Mr. Nicholls, Mr. Brontë wrote him what Charlotte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
called a 'pitiless despatch.' The poor man was already
'entirely rejecting his meals,' and so Charlotte accompanied
the pitiless despatch with a note dissociating
herself from these violent expressions, and she exhorted
him to maintain his courage and spirits. She had
already taken sides against her father (whose violence
certainly suggests that there was some truth in the stories
about him which Mrs. Gaskell had to suppress), for she
wished that Ellen could be at Haworth now 'to see papa
in his present mood: you would know something of
him.' She was afraid also that 'papa thinks a little too
much about his want of money: he says that the match
would be a degradation, that I should be throwing
myself away, that he expects me, if I marry at all, to do
very differently.' Charlotte did not share these worldly
views against her marrying Mr. Nicholls, but she had
some even more valid ones of her own. 'My own
objections,' she writes, 'arise from a sense of incongruity
and uncongeniality in feelings, tastes, principles.' Her
'dearest wish' for the immediate future was that 'papa
would resume his tranquillity, and Mr. N. his beef and
pudding.' The writing of the pitiless despatch, however,
seemed to have been a safety-valve to Mr. Brontë's
indignation, for Charlotte adds a postscript to this
remarkable letter, saying that 'the incipient inflammation
in Papa's eye is disappearing.'</p>

<p>Elements of comedy began to enter into this extremely
serious situation. Mr. Nicholls, having received
Charlotte's letter of exhortation, quitted Haworth,
leaving Mr. Brontë to look after the parish alone.
A week afterwards he was back again, and wrote to
Mr. Brontë withdrawing his resignation, clearly because
of the contents of Charlotte's letter. Mr. Brontë
allowed him to stop on, but only on condition of his
giving a promise in writing that he would never mention
the word marriage again either to him or Charlotte.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
Mr. Nicholls took no notice of that, but remained.
Ever since the first frightful disclosure which caused
Mr. Brontë a return of his apoplectic symptoms, parson
and curate had not spoken to each other at all, nor met
even in church, for Mr. Nicholls got somebody to take
his duty for him, and Charlotte wrote to Ellen that 'she
feels persuaded the termination will be his departure
for Australia.' Meantime feeling at Haworth ran high
against him. 'Martha,' Charlotte gravely records, 'is
bitter against him; John Brown (the sexton) says &#8220;he
should like to shoot him.&#8221;' Her own state of mind
indeed defies unravelment, and she certainly could not
unravel it herself. She assembles public opinion about
his presumption in proposing to her, and yet writes to
assure him of her sympathy in such terms that he
recanted his resignation.</p>

<p>The tenseness of the situation was temporarily relieved
by Charlotte's departure on the last visit she ever made
to London, in order to see <i>Villette</i> through the press.
She told her father that he must not write her abusive
letters about Mr. Nicholls, and he promised not to.
But he could not always cork up his virulence, and so
he wrote her one letter as from Flossie, Anne's dog; and
Flossie, of course, could say what she liked. This
instance of humour at Haworth must be cherished: it
was not common in that tense atmosphere. On this
visit, which Charlotte spent as usual with Mr. George
Smith and his mother and sisters, and which lasted
nearly a month, there was no lionising now nor any
attempt to make her mix with what she called 'the
decorative side of life.' Social gaieties were agony to
her: it was no use trying to enjoy them. London,
again, on its side, had learned that she was not a satisfactory
lioness, and made no effort to induce her to roar.
She had promised to let the importunate baronet Sir James
Kay-Shuttleworth know when she was in town, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
she evaded his hospitalities by not telling him till towards
the end of her stay, and thus was not vexed with 'his
excited fuss.' She was allowed her own choice in the
way of engagements and sight-seeings, and selected 'the
real side of life,' visiting two prisons, Newgate and
Pentonville, the Bank, the Exchange, the Foundling
Hospital, and the lunatic asylum at Bethlehem Hospital.
Then there was work to be done on the proof sheets of
<i>Villette</i>: it must have been odd to correct them in
the house of George Smith, for he and his mother
confessedly appeared in the book as Dr. John and his
mother. They were both perfectly aware of this, and
though the presentation of them was wholly appreciative
they did not entirely relish it. His comment on Lucy
Snowe had been that she was 'an odd fascinating little
puss,' and that he was not in love with her.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Charlotte most considerately postponed the appearance
of <i>Villette</i> till the end of January 1853, in order that
it should not clash with the publication of Mrs. Gaskell's
<i>Ruth</i>. A week before it was issued she wrote to
Miss Martineau, her friendship with whom had survived
the shock of the latter's atheistical views, asking her for
her frank criticism on the forthcoming novel.</p>

<blockquote><p>I know [she said] that you will give me your thoughts
upon my book as frankly as if you spoke to some near relative
whose good you preferred to her gratification. I wince
under the pain of condemnation like any other weak structure
of flesh and blood; but I love, I honour, I kneel to truth.
Let her smite me on the one cheek&mdash;good! the tears may
spring to the eyes; but courage! there is the other side,
hit again, right sharply.</p></blockquote>

<p>No more forcible though rather rhetorical request for
candour can be imagined. Charlotte had also previously
begged Miss Martineau to tell her if she detected anything
coarse in her work, as certain reviewers of <i>Jane</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span><i>Eyre</i>
had done. It is, then, little wonder that Miss
Martineau, thus solemnly adjured, dealt frankly with
her friend about <i>Villette</i>. She wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>As for the other side of the question, which you desire to
know, I have but one thing to say, but it is not a small one.
I do not like the love, either the kind or the degree of it;
and its prevalence in the book, and effect on the action of it,
help to explain the passages in the reviews which you consulted
me about, and seem to afford some foundation for the
criticisms they offered.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The rest of the letter was suppressed by Mrs. Gaskell,
but it must have been laudatory, for Charlotte answered
that it was fair, right, and worthy of her, but against
this passage she violently protested; it struck her dumb.
She did not turn the other cheek at all, but the tears
sprang to her eyes and an undying resentment to her
heart. She replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>I know what <i>love</i> is as I understand it; and if man or woman
should be ashamed of feeling such love, then there is nothing
right, noble, faithful, truthful, unselfish on this earth, as
I comprehend rectitude, nobleness, fidelity, truth and disinterestedness....
To differ from you gives me keen pain.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then Miss Martineau wrote an anonymous review of
<i>Villette</i> in the <i>Daily News</i>, in which she made public
the same sort of criticism as had privately given Charlotte
such deep offence, pointing out, as is indeed true, that
Lucy Snowe's love for Dr. John is superseded without
recorded transition by her love for Paul Emmanuel; she
also accused her of attacking Popery with virulence.
That was enough, and more than enough. Charlotte
ascertained that the review was by her, and instantly
determined to have nothing more to do with her.</p>

<blockquote><p>She has shown with reference to the work [she wrote to
Miss Wooler] a spirit so strangely and unexpectedly acri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>monious,
that I have gathered courage to tell her that the
gulf of mutual difference between her and me is so wide and
deep, the bridge of union so slight and uncertain that I have
come to the conclusion that frequent intercourse would be
most perilous and unadvisable and have begged to adjourn
<i>sine die</i> my long projected visit to her. Of course she is now
very angry, and I know her bitterness will not be short-lived&mdash;but
it cannot be helped.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>That was the end: Charlotte never saw Miss Martineau
again, nor sent her a notification of her marriage.</p>

<p>The reception of <i>Villette</i> in spite of some severe
reviews was sufficiently favourable to please the author,
and she returned to Haworth to take up again the situation
concerning Mr. Nicholls, which had been left
suspended in her absence. A great social event was
impending, namely, the visit of Dr. Longley, Bishop of
Ripon, and subsequently Archbishop of Canterbury,
who spent a night at the Parsonage. He was 'a charming
little bishop, the most benignant little gentleman
that ever put on lawn sleeves,' and all passed off very
well except for Mr. Nicholls's conduct. He came to tea
and supper, but made no effort to be cheerful, rather he
called attention to his dejection, and showed temper in
speaking to Mr. Brontë. He dogged Charlotte up the
path to the vicarage after evening service, and when
Charlotte went upstairs, he cast after her some 'flaysome
looks,' which 'filled Martha's soul with horror,' for
Martha, standing by the kitchen door, had her eye on
him, and reported these sinister glances. He got up a
'pertinacious dispute' with the Inspector of Schools,
which revived all Charlotte's unfavourable impressions of
him; 'if he was a good man at bottom, it is a sad thing that
nature has not given him the faculty to put goodness into
a more attractive form.' He grew so gloomy and reserved
that the rest of his clerical brethren shunned his company.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>'Papa has a perfect antipathy to him, and he, I fear, to
papa. Martha' (we are reminded for the third time)
'hates him. I think he might almost be dying and
they would not speak a friendly word to or of him.'
Charlotte even managed to doubt the genuineness of
his love towards her.</p>

<blockquote><p>He was never agreeable or amiable, [she wrote] and is
less so now than ever, and, alas! I do not know him well
enough to be sure there is truth and true affection, or only
rancour and corroding disappointment at the bottom of the
chagrin. In this state of things I must be, and I am, <i>entirely</i>
passive.</p></blockquote>

<p>In fact, in this letter to Ellen in the spring of 1853
Charlotte collects, as for a criminal trial, every atom of
evidence she could find, including her cook's opinion of
him, to demonstrate what a thoroughly undesirable
fellow Mr. Nicholls was.</p>

<p>But she was not trying to convince Ellen of that;
she was trying to convince herself, and without full
success. She began to doubt her own conclusions,
and in the very letter in which she set forth this formidable
<i>dossier</i> against him she completely betrayed herself.
'I may be losing the purest gem, and to me far the most
precious life can give&mdash;genuine attachment&mdash;or I may
be escaping the yoke of a morose temper.' So, pending
her own decision on the matter, she laid the responsibility
on her father. 'In this doubt,' she wrote, 'conscience
will not suffer me to take one step in opposition to
papa's will, blended as that will is with the most bitter
and unreasonable prejudice.' But all the time she knew
that papa's will was not a determining factor at all; she
would see about papa's will when she had made up her
mind about her own, and she was looking out for some
convincing opportunity to tear up her <i>dossier</i> altogether.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">

<span class="i0">Was ever woman in this humour won?</span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>Her opportunity came. Mr. Nicholls found the
situation intolerable; he again resigned his curacy and
was to leave Haworth at the end of May. Whit-Sunday
came, and next day Charlotte wrote to Ellen an account
of what had happened the day before at church:</p>

<blockquote><p>It seems as if I were to be punished for my doubts about
the nature and truth of poor Mr. Nicholls's regard. Having
ventured on Whit Sunday to stop to the sacrament, I got a
lesson not to be repeated. He struggled, faltered, then lost
command over himself, stood before my eyes and in the
sight of all the communicants, white, shaking, voiceless. He
made a great effort, but could only with difficulty whisper and
falter through the service. I suppose he thought this would
be the last time, he goes either this week or the next. I heard
the women sobbing round, and I could not quite check my
own tears. What had happened was reported to Papa either
by Joseph Redman or John Brown; it excited only anger,
and such expressions as 'unmanly driveller.' Compassion or
relenting is no more to be looked for than sap from firewood.</p></blockquote>

<p>It may be taken that from this moment Charlotte made
up her mind to marry him. She had surrendered, and,
though his departure was imminent and there were many
difficulties in the way yet, she was convinced of the
sincerity of his devotion, and knew in her heart that he
was her man. There was a school feast at which
Mr. Brontë spoke to him 'with constrained civility but
still with <i>civility</i>.' He did not reply civilly, he cut short
further words. Considering that his vicar had not
spoken to him for months, this was hardly to be wondered
at, and Charlotte was justly afraid that they were both
unchristian in their mutual feelings. Then, in spite of
Mr. Nicholls's apparently extreme unpopularity in the
parish, his flock got up a handsome testimonial for him
in the shape of a gold watch. Mr. Brontë, not being
very well, absented himself from the presentation.</p>

<p>Mr. Nicholls came to the Parsonage to deliver up
deeds and account-books and to say good-bye to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
future father-in-law. Charlotte would not see him in
her father's presence, and he left the house. But now
she had really chosen him as he had chosen her, and she
could not let him go like that.</p>

<blockquote><p>Perceiving that he stayed long before going out at the gate,
and remembering his long grief, I took courage and went
out trembling and miserable. I found him leaning against
the garden door in a paroxysm of anguish, sobbing as women
never sob. Of course I went straight to him. Very few
words were interchanged, those few barely articulate. But
he wanted such hope and encouragement as I could not give
him.</p></blockquote>

<p>He went, and Charlotte instantly perceived that it was
not he only, but she personally who was suffering. 'In
all this,' she complains to Ellen, 'it is not I who am to
be pitied at all, and, of course, nobody pities me. They
all think in Haworth that I have disdainfully refused him.'
That she had certainly done, assigning any amount of
excellent reasons for her decision, and endorsing it with
the approval of Martha and John Brown. But now she
intended to marry him, and, though she could not at
parting give him any promise until her father's objections
were overcome, she set to work quietly and secretly,
making no mention of what she was doing in her letters
at the time, and embarked on an amazing and entrancing
intrigue.</p>

<p>She had for secret ally and fellow-conspirator the
Rev. Joseph Brett Grant, master of Haworth Grammar
School. She had pilloried him in <i>Shirley</i> as
Mr. Donne, but he had borne her no grudge (rather
disconcertingly) for that, and now he proved his active
good-will. For in July, only two months after Mr.
Nicholls had left Haworth, apparently for good, he was
staying <i>perdu</i> with this admirable Mr. Grant at the
Grammar School, and there were meetings between
Charlotte and him. He had not therefore to wait long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
for the encouragement she had been unable to give him
when they parted at the gate of the Parsonage, and
instead of being 'entirely passive' she was taking some
very romantic measures 'in opposition to papa's will.'
This man&#339;uvre, as yet unnoticed by the devout
biographer but proved by the indisputable evidence of
her own letters,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> when the course of love ran smooth, is
almost too 'wildly dear,' and we figure her, as demure
and mouse-like and determined as Jane Eyre herself,
stealing from the Parsonage, when Mr. Brontë was safely
occupied over his sermon, to keep her assignation with
her lover at the house of one of the <i>Shirley</i> curates.
Did Martha know, we wonder? Did John Brown
know? Then she kept in touch with him as well by
correspondence; but the correspondence weighed on her
mind, and she told her father that she was writing to him.
That probably was a well-calculated confession, for the
new curate, Mr. de Renzi, Charlotte perceived, did not
suit her father nearly as well as Mr. Nicholls had done,
and the hint that Mr. Nicholls was not yet entirely
severed from Haworth would not be amiss. But
Mr. Brontë was told nothing about his clandestine visit
to the Grammar School, and his daughter's meetings
with him.</p>

<p>While these hidden intrigues were in progress, life at
the Parsonage went on with its unswerving monotony.
Charlotte paid visits to Ellen and Mrs. Gaskell in the
spring, and in company with Mr. and Mrs. Joe Taylor,
<i>née</i> Amelia Ringrose, and their baby went to Scotland
in August; but was in that country for one night only,
since the baby had some slight ailment, and the parents
felt sure that the air of Scotland did not agree with it.
They retraced their steps at once to Ilkley, but Charlotte
lost her box, which was labelled to Kirkcudbright, and
lack of clothes compelled her to return after three days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>to Haworth. Literally nothing else happened that
summer except what was hidden from all eyes until
Mrs. Gaskell came to stay with Charlotte towards the
end of September.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Haworth Parsonage</span><br>
(circa 1850)</span>
</div>

<p>In her charmingly written account of her visit she
dwells much on minutiæ, describing the exquisite cleanness
of the house, the clockwork regularity of the routine,
the silence, the undisturbed tranquillity, the appearance
of the parlour, the hours for meals, the walks on the
moor, the long talks they had over the fire; but this
wealth of detail over trivialities rather suggests that no
very intimate intercourse in conversation passed between
them. But Charlotte must have given her then her
version of Branwell's affair with Mrs. Robinson, and
she also spoke a good deal of Emily, 'about whom,' says
Mrs. Gaskell, 'she is never tired of talking, nor I of
listening. Emily must have been a remnant of the
Titans....'<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> It is curious, however, to notice that
Mrs. Gaskell, speaking elsewhere of Emily, says: 'All
that I, a stranger, have been able to learn about her
has not tended to give either me or my readers a pleasant
impression of her.'<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> These constant talks with Charlotte
about Emily must have been in her mind when she wrote
that, and it is impossible not to wonder what these
communications were which produced the disagreeable
impression. Some reflection, maybe, of estrangements
and of bitter days, when Emily befriended Branwell and
scolded Anne for using him as a model in <i>The Tenant
of Wildfell Hall</i>: or the rather horrible story of Emily
thrashing her dog? It is impossible to tell, but it was
thus that Charlotte's talk of Emily struck the mild, kindly
woman who listened to it.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Brontë himself, Mrs. Gaskell shows high
appreciation. 'He was a most courteous host, and
when he was with us&mdash;at breakfast in his study, or at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>tea in Charlotte's parlour,&mdash;he had a sort of grand and
stately way of describing past times, which tallied well
with his striking appearance.' This favourable impression
did not last, for when she saw him again in 1860,
she wrote of him to Mr. Williams: 'He still talks in his
pompous way, and mingles moral remarks and somewhat
stale sentiment with his conversation on ordinary subjects.'<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
But it must be remembered that she had in the
interval brought out her <i>Life</i> of Charlotte, and his
indignation at what she had said about him had put
another complexion on his admirable stateliness. Mrs.
Gaskell, finally, knew that Mr. Brontë was violently
opposed to the idea of Charlotte's marriage with
Mr. Nicholls, and 'deeply admired the patient docility
which she displayed in her conduct towards her father.'
But the docility was not quite so patient as she imagined,
for Charlotte was in correspondence with her lover, and
Mr. Nicholls was in Haworth, for the second time since
his departure, staying secretly once more with Mr. Grant.
Charlotte did not see so much of him as she had done in
July, for she had her duties to perform to her guest.
But the household in the Parsonage went early to bed,
and Mrs. Gaskell records how she always heard Charlotte
come downstairs again when she was in her room. Is it
too much to hope that Mr. Nicholls was waiting in the
churchyard?</p>

<p>Throughout the autumn and winter Charlotte's correspondence
with the friends to whom for years she had
written so regularly and voluminously practically ceased.
Five letters in four months was the meagre sum of them.
The correspondence with Mr. Nicholls may have occupied
her, but of the volume of it or of its contents we have
no idea, for after her death he seems to have destroyed
every letter she had ever written to him. Then in January
1854 she judged that the time was ripe for another move.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>She arranged for him to come to Haworth once more
and stay with Mr. and Mrs. Grant, and now she told
her father that he was here, and 'stipulated with papa
for opportunity to become better acquainted. I had
it and all I learned inclined me to esteem and affection.'
This reads strangely, for Mr. Nicholls had been her
father's curate for over eight years, and one would have
thought there must have been ample opportunity for
forming an acquaintance with him. Though Mr. Brontë
was still 'very hostile, and bitterly unjust,' he was
evidently getting used to the idea; he consented to
Charlotte's seeing her lover, and she saw much of him
during this ten days' stay. Off he went again without
meeting his late vicar, to resume his duty at Kirk
Smeaton, where he had taken a curacy, and again the
process of detrition of Mr. Brontë's hostility went
quietly on throughout the spring, and the plans of those
who were now lovers were complete before Mr. Nicholls
paid his next visit to the Grants at Easter. As Easter
approached, Charlotte got into a slight flutter about it,
for she expected that her engagement would then be
formally settled, and she first wrote to Ellen asking her
to come to Haworth because Mr. Nicholls would be
there ('perhaps too he might take a walk with us
occasionally'), and then revoked her invitation for
exactly the same reason, namely, that he <i>was</i> going to
be there.</p>

<p>He came, they were engaged, and their plans, which
did equal credit to their heads and their hearts, were
disclosed in schedule to Mr. Brontë. The curate, Mr.
de Renzi, who had always been unsatisfactory, would be
dismissed, and Mr. Nicholls would resume his duties
at Haworth. Charlotte would not leave her father,
but Mr. Nicholls, when the marriage took place in the
summer, would come to live at the Parsonage. Mr.
Brontë's 'seclusion and convenience' would be left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
uninvaded, and Mr. Nicholls would subscribe to household
expenses in so liberal a manner that 'in a pecuniary
sense the marriage would bring Mr. Brontë gain instead
of loss.' These plans for his comfort caused him to
give his consent, 'and papa began really to take a pleasure
in the prospect.'</p>

<p>Considering that little more than a year ago he had
nearly had an apoplectic fit at the presumption of the
now accepted suitor, Charlotte's management of the
affair, and her quiet vanquishing of difficulties that
seemed insurmountable, must have been a work of consummate
strategy. She gave credit to Mr. Nicholls for
his perseverance, but granted that he wanted to marry
her, all he had to do was to carry out her orders: she
was alone at Haworth with a singularly obstinate father,
and success in bringing him round was entirely due
to her. Ambition for her, paternal pride, 'ever a
restless feeling,' as she wrote to Ellen, she considered
had been at the bottom of his opposition, and 'now that
this unquiet spirit is exorcised, justice, which was once
quite forgotten, is once more listened to, and affection,
I hope, resumes some power.'</p>

<p>Then having herself worked for and triumphantly
carried her scheme to a successful issue, she attributed it
all to Providence. 'Providence,' she wrote, 'offers me
this destiny. Doubtless then it is the best for me.'
But, without questioning the supremacy of the Divine
decrees, we must observe that Providence had offered her
that destiny a year and a half ago, and she had rejected
it because she had no affection for her lover. Afterwards,
coming round to the belief that it was best for
her, and that she really wanted it, she had by the exercise
of tact, intrigue, and will power secured it. Providence,
in fact, would not have had much chance without her
firm co-operation.</p>

<p>She was certainly happy in the prospect of her marriage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
but there was no sort of ecstasy; she wrote that her
happiness was 'of the soberest order,' and she could
analyse it exactly. She trusted that she would love her
husband, and she was grateful for his love. She believed
him, without glamour, to be an 'affectionate, a conscientious
and high-principled man,' and 'if with all this
I should yield to regret, that fine talents, congenial
tastes and thoughts are not added, I should be most
presumptuous and thankless.' She was aware that this
destiny which, she repeats, Providence has offered her
'will not be generally regarded as brilliant, but I trust
I see in it some germs of happiness.' There was nothing
resembling any personal sense or anticipation of the
great thing that at last was coming to her: she hoped
that 'this arrangement will turn out more truly to papa's
satisfaction than any other it was in my power to achieve.'
She looked into the future tranquilly and serenely,
but never for a moment did she foresee that her marriage
would bring her such happiness and forgetfulness of
self as she had missed all her life. One thing alone
troubled her at all, and that was Mr. Nicholls's rheumatism,
and over this she grew very solemn. It had been,
she told Ellen, 'one of the strong arguments against her
marriage,' and there was fear that it was chronic, but
Charlotte 'resolved to stand by him now whether in
weal or woe.... And yet the ultimate possibilities of
such a case are appalling. You remember your aunt?'
But Mr. Nicholls had to do his part, too, in averting
such a fate, and his neglect of it brought on him a good
wigging. He had evidently had a strict dietetic supervision
on the last of his visits to Haworth, and had got
much better, but on his return there he was worse, and
Charlotte was frightened till she found out that he had
been careless about himself at Kirk Smeaton, and his
aches were entirely his own fault; so what he needed
was not sympathy but a sound rating. The nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
it may be gathered from the remarks she made to Ellen
on the subject:</p>

<blockquote><p>Man is indeed an amazing piece of mechanism when you
see, so to speak, the full weakness of what he calls his
strength. There is not a female child above the age of eight
but might rebuke him for spoilt petulance of his wilful
nonsense. I bought a border for the table-cloth and have
put it on....</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Nicholls, we feel, would think twice before he was
careless about his rheumatism again. She took him in
hand, too, in other ways. Ellen had asked him to go
to Brookroyd, but Charlotte did not give him the
message&mdash;'for it would be like tempting him to forget
duty.'</p>

<p>There was sewing to be done, there was a modest
<i>trousseau</i> to be bought of such new garments for the
wedding-day as would come into use afterwards. The
storeroom by the kitchen in the Parsonage had to be
converted into a study for her husband; paper and
curtains of green and white matched each other well.
Then there were the arrangements to be made about the
wedding itself. About that the utmost secrecy was
observed: only Ellen and Miss Wooler were to be
bidden to it, and though the parishioners at Haworth
knew now that the marriage was to take place, Mr.
Nicholls, at Charlotte's wish, so managed it that not
a soul in the place should know the date except the
officiating clergyman, and as a further precaution the
service was fixed for eight o'clock in the morning, when
there would be but few people about. To other friends
of the bride and bridegroom there would be sent out,
when the ceremony was over, a printed card making the
announcement; Charlotte wished the envelope to be
plain with a silver initial on it. More of these had to
be ordered, 'for there was no end to Mr. Nicholls's string
of parson friends,' and he thought sixty would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
required. Charlotte's own list was much less numerous
than his and consisted of only eighteen names. The
hermit-like seclusion in which she must have lived all
her life is witnessed to by the fact that only five of these
were inhabitants of Haworth and its neighbourhood.
Among the rest were Mrs. Gaskell, George Smith, his
mother and his sisters, Mr. Williams and Mr. Monckton
Milnes. Neither Thackeray, Lewes, nor Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth
received the notification, nor, we regret to
say, Miss Martineau.</p>

<p>Mr. Nicholls had wanted to be married in July, and
though Charlotte, in the early days of her engagement,
thought that this was too soon, and that some date of
the later summer was time enough, it took place on
June 29. The officiating clergyman, the Rev. Sutcliffe
Sowden, and the bridegroom arrived the evening before,
and stayed with Mr. Grant, whose house had been so
hospitable to the intrigue, and Ellen Nussey, the solitary
bridesmaid, and Miss Wooler were guests at the Parsonage:
Mr. Brontë was to give Charlotte away. As
the party at the Parsonage was going to bed that night,
this disconcerting parent suddenly announced that he
would take no part in the ceremony, and indeed not
attend it at all. What his reason was is quite unknown;
but it seems likely that this inconvenient gesture was
intended to be a final protest against the marriage, of
which really he now entirely approved. The form for
the Solemnization of Matrimony in the Prayer Book was
hurriedly examined, and the happy discovery was made
that Miss Wooler, as a friend of the bride, might legitimately
take his place. So Mr. Brontë stayed in bed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

<p>The wedding tour was made in Ireland: they did not
visit the ancestral home of the Bruntys in County Down,
but after a tour to Killarney went to Banagher, where
relations of the bridegroom lived. They told Charlotte
that she was a very fortunate person in having got so
good a husband, and already she agreed with them.
Indeed she had got more than they knew, for now she
had what her nature had long subconsciously longed
for as the medicament for her bitterness and her
morbidity, and it was a perfectly new kind of woman
who came back to Haworth with her husband in August.
Henceforth, instead of her letters being full of sharp
criticism of others they abound in praises of Arthur:
instead of being so often concerned with the symptoms
of her own ill-health, she is jubilant about the improvement
in his, for he had gone up twelve pounds in weight
in the month succeeding their marriage, and the sinister
anticipations of what might have been the issue of marrying
a man with rheumatic tendencies (remember your
aunt) were thrust into limbo. Years ago she had told
Ellen, with the pontifical certainty of the spinster, that
after marriage a woman might allow herself prudently
and cautiously to fall in love with her husband, but now
she did not stay to consider the wisdom of such slow
going. Like an echo from her own distant voice, she
could repeat that her marriage would secure papa comfort
and aid in his old age, but the newer voice was
stronger.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>She fell in love with her husband recklessly, as a good
Victorian wife should: his judgment was infallible, and
she submitted everything to it. When she asked Ellen
to come and stay at Haworth it was no longer her invitation
but his: Arthur would be pleased to see her, and
'one friendly word from him means as much as twenty
from most people.' If she wanted to pay a visit to a
house where there had been a case of fever, though she
had no fear of infection on her own account, 'there are
cases where wives have to put their own judgments on
the shelf, and do as they are bid.' They entertained to
tea and supper the Sunday and day-school pupils and
teachers, the choir and the bell-ringers, and Charlotte,
who in her maiden days would have been altogether
unable to face such a function, was thrilled with pride
and with love, for Arthur's health was proposed, and
when the speaker alluded to him as a 'consistent Christian
and a kind gentleman' Charlotte, deeply touched,
'thought that to merit and win such a character was
better than to earn either wealth or fame or power.
I am disposed to echo that high and simple eulogium.'</p>

<p>The whole colour and temper of her life was changed.
It is with glee that she warns Ellen that 'a married
woman can call but a very small portion of her time her
own'; the large stock of it which she was wont to have
on hand had been grabbed by her husband, but she
grudged him not a minute of it. She had regretted
before her marriage that there were no congenial tastes
or thoughts common to him and herself, but now she
thinks it 'not bad for her that he should be so little
inclined to the literary and the contemplative.' She
marvels how some wives grow selfish: matrimony, in
her experience, 'tends to draw you out of and away
from yourself.' Even in her most private and personal
affairs she now defers to the wishes of her 'dear boy,'
who 'grows daily dearer,' and she transmits a message<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
to Ellen from him that he wished her to burn all the
letters that Charlotte now writes her. Ellen declined to
promise any such thing, and again Charlotte pressed the
point.</p>

<blockquote><p>Arthur complains you do not promise to burn my letters
as you receive them. He says you must give him a plain
pledge to that effect, or he will read every line I write and
elect himself censor of our correspondence.... Write him
out the promise on a separate slip of paper in a legible hand,
and send it in your next.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whether Ellen gave this promise on the repetition of
Arthur's wish we do not know; if she did, she certainly
broke it, for she continued to preserve Charlotte's
letters to her exactly as before, and he had to content
himself with reading them before they were sent.</p>

<p>A spirit of fun, of lightness, enters into them now,
which had been absent from them since the days
when Celia Amelia had sent valentines and passionate
verse to all the young ladies of Haworth. Charlotte
describes, for instance, how that flighty Amelia Taylor,
who had made such a goose of herself over her baby
when she went with them to Scotland, paid them
a visit. Amelia was a simpleton: no doubt she was
right not to be jealous about her husband's 'former
flames,' but why cultivate their society in that unnatural
way? Arthur read that letter before it was posted and
was quite serious about it: he thought his wife had
'written too freely about Amelia,' and Charlotte couldn't
help laughing at him. Such a precaution as burning
these letters seemed to her truly ridiculous, but Ellen
must promise; otherwise she would receive just such
letters as he wrote to his clerical brethren, unspiced by
affection or critical comments on friends. Certainly if
joy had never come to the grim Parsonage since it was
built, as one of Mrs. Gaskell's friends felt, it had come
now at long last.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>But the days were full and Charlotte had little time for
correspondence, and though she wrote with regularity to
Ellen, she addressed few letters to anyone else, and her
once voluminous correspondence with Mr. Williams
ceased altogether. Nor did she want visitors: Ellen
came to Haworth once, and once the steadfast Sir James
Kay-Shuttleworth and a friend for the Sunday. For
this visit there was a particular and kindly reason: he
wanted to see Mr. Nicholls, and, liking him, he offered
him the living of Padiham, near his place at Gawthorpe.
No thought of that could be entertained, for he and
Charlotte were both bound to remain at Haworth while
Mr. Brontë lived, and though the offer was again pressed
when they went to stay for a few days at Gawthorpe in
the winter, it was again declined, evidently without any
sort of regret that they were not free to take it, for the
contract to look after Mr. Brontë was thankfully, not
grudgingly, performed.</p>

<blockquote><p>May God preserve him to us yet for some years [she wrote
to Ellen]. The wish for his continued life, together with a
certain solicitude for his happiness and health seems, I
scarcely know why, even stronger in me now than it was
before I was married. Papa has taken no duty since we
returned, and each time I see Mr. Nicholls put on gown or
surplice I feel comforted to think that this marriage has
secured papa good aid in his old age.</p></blockquote>

<p>But though, whenever her husband was at leisure,
Charlotte 'must have occupations in which he can
share,' he had practically the whole of the work of the
parish on his hands, for Mr. Brontë took little or no
duty, and while Mr. Nicholls was busy she took up her
writing again. Just as she had done before getting
embarked on <i>Shirley</i>, she made several beginnings of
a new novel<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>; one of these got as far as its fiftieth page.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
This renewed industry disposes of the supposition that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>her husband discouraged her literary work, and he himself
emphatically denied that he had ever done so. She
only wrote when the mood was on her, and in the year
and a half that had elapsed between the publication of
<i>Villette</i> and her marriage she had only written a fragment
of eighteen pages called <i>Willie Ellin</i>. It was not
till after she was married that, as a matter of fact, she set
to work again.</p>

<p>The autumn passed into winter. Snow had fallen
early, then melted again, and one morning she and her
husband walked out a distance of over three miles to see
the waterfall on the moor. Rain came on, and she
returned drenched, and never quite recovered the
excellent health that she had enjoyed ever since her
marriage. She was well enough to go to Gawthorpe
for a day or two, early in January, and she had planned
a visit to Ellen for the end of the month. But before
that could be paid, she became really unwell and took
to her bed.</p>

<p>She knew now that she was with child, and the doctor
was reassuring: these fits of sickness were normal
symptoms. But she grew worse and weaker, prostrated
with the continued sickness and fever, though there was
as yet no acuteness of anxiety. From bed, in pencil, she
wrote just three more notes, and in them all, clear and
unwavering, shone the lamp of love which had illuminated
these last months for her, with a light serene and
tranquil, such as she had never known before. To one
friend of the far-off Brussels days she wrote: 'No
kinder, better husband than mine, it seems to me, there
can be in the world. I do not want now for kind
companionship in health and the tenderest nursing in
sickness.' And then to Ellen: 'I want to give you an
assurance that will comfort you&mdash;and that is that I find
in my husband the tenderest nurse, the kindest support&mdash;the
best earthly comfort that ever woman had.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>'</p>

<p>Then came the third and last note: 'I cannot talk&mdash;even
to my dear, patient, constant Arthur I can say
but few words at once.'</p>

<p>Then there seemed to be an improvement, and it was
not till within a few days of her death that her recovery
was despaired of. She was conscious till the end,
speaking but seldom, and at the very last she turned her
dimmed eyes to her 'dear boy,' clinging to the life
which his love had made sweet for her. She whispered:
'Oh, I am not going to die, am I? He will not separate
us&mdash;we have been so happy.'</p>

<p>She died in the night of March 30, 1855.</p>

<p class="center">TRANSCRIBER NOTES</p>

<p>A Table of Contents has been added to this project as an aid to the
reader. It was not included in the original.</p>

<p>Missing punctuation has been added and obvious punctuation errors have
been corrected.</p>

<p>All printing errors, such as missing words or inconsistent spellings
including hyphenation, have been retained with the exception of those
listed below.</p>

<p>Page 154: "cheeful" => "cheerful" (its information about the canary and
the dogs, nor the cheerful contents of Emily's).</p>

<p>Page 242: "he" => "her" (and softly averted her head to hide the
suffusion of her check.)</p>

<p>Page 242: "dialogu" => "dialogue" (Louis Moore retails page after page
of dialogue between his mistress and himself).</p>

<p>Page 242: "an" => "and" (and it is all tinsel and froth compared with
the gleams of those deep waters).</p>

<p>Page 312: "porrait" => "portrait" (bequest of Richmond portrait).</p>
