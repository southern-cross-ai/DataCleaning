  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. &mdash; THE FIGHT OFF HELIGOLAND</h2>

  <p class="first">WAR was declared on August 4 at midnight (German time). At
  that moment the British fleet, mobilised and ready, was at the stations which
  had been decided upon in the event of war with Germany. By an act of
  foresight which cannot be too highly commended the fleet had been mobilised
  for battle practice a week or so before the actual outbreak of hostilities
  and at a time when it was not certain whether Great Britain would engage
  herself in the war. The wisdom of our preparations was seen after war was
  declared.</p>

  <p>From the moment the battle fleet sailed from Spithead and disappeared over
  the horizon it vanished so far as the average man in the street was
  concerned, and from that day onward its presence was no more advertised.</p>

  <p>The first few days following the outbreak of war we suffered certain
  losses. On August 6 the <i>Amphion</i> was mined after having destroyed by
  gun fire the <i>Königin Luise</i>. On September 5 the <i>Pathfinder</i> was
  torpedoed by a "U" boat, and on September 22 the <i>Aboukir</i>, the
  <i>Cressy</i>, and the <i>Hogue</i> were destroyed by a German submarine. In
  the meantime the German had had his trouble. The <i>Magdeburg</i> was shot
  down by gun fire at the hands of the Russian navy. The <i>Köln</i>, the
  <i>Ariadne</i> and the <i>Mainz</i> with the German destroyer V187 had been
  caught in the Bight of Heligoland, and had been sunk.</p>

  <p>We had our lessons to learn, and we were prompt to profit by dire
  experience. The closing of ships to save others had led to the triple
  disaster of September 22, and save for the vessels we lost in the South
  Atlantic fight and the two battleships, one of which <i>(Bulwark)</i> was
  torpedoed and blown up in November, and the other <i>(Formidable)</i> in
  December, and the blowing up of the <i>Princess Irene</i> in March, we
  endured no losses in home waters.</p>

    <p class="caption">Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>In giving a survey of the sea operations one necessarily must deal with
  those services which are associated with the Navy, and a history of naval
  matters must necessarily lead to those great operations which developed so
  sensationally in the Dardanelles and on the Gallipoli Peninsula.</p>

  <p>It had been hoped that, in the very early stages of the war, the British
  fleet would be given an opportunity of meeting the German Grand Fleet&mdash;a
  hope foredoomed, since with its marked inferiority it was unlikely that the
  enemy would try conclusions with his enemy on the sea.</p>

  <p>Twice did any considerable portion of the enemy fleet venture forth and
  the thrilling story of the first adventure is told in Vice-Admiral Sir David
  Beatty's despatch and in the supplementary despatches. The British moved into
  the Bight of Heligoland on Thursday, August 27, the First Battle Cruiser
  Squadron and the First Light Cruiser Squadron.</p>

  <p>"At 4 a.m., August 28, the movements of the flotillas commenced as
  previously arranged," wrote Admiral Beatty, "the Battle Cruiser Squadron and
  Light Cruiser Squadron supporting. The Rear-Admiral, <i>Invincible</i>, with
  <i>New Zealand</i> and four destroyers having joined my flag, the squadron
  passed through the pre-arranged rendezvous.</p>

  <p>"At 8.10 a.m. I received a signal from the Commodore (i),* informing me
  that the flotilla was in action with the enemy. This was presumably in the
  vicinity of their pre-arranged rendezvous. From this time until 11 a.m. I
  remained about the vicinity ready to support as necessary, intercepting
  various signals, which contained no information on which I could act."</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Torpedo Boat Destroyer Flotilla.</p>

  <p>"At ii a.m. the squadron was attacked by three submarines. The attack was
  frustrated by rapid manoeuvring, and the four destroyers were ordered to
  attack them. Shortly after 11 a.m. various signals having been received
  indicating that the Commodore (i) and Commodore (2)* were both in need of
  assistance, I ordered the Light Cruiser squadron to support the torpedo
  flotillas."</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Submarines</p>

  <p>"Later I received a signal from the Commodore (1) stating that he was
  being attacked by a light cruiser, and a further signal informing me that he
  was being hard pressed and asking for assistance. The Captain (3), First
  Flotilla, also signalled that he was in need of help.</p>

  <p>"From the foregoing the situation appeared to me critical. The flotillas
  had advanced only ten miles since 8 a.m., and were only about twenty-five
  miles from two enemy bases on their flank and rear respectively. Commodore
  Goodenough had detached two of his light cruisers to assist some destroyers
  earlier in the day, and these had not yet rejoined. (They rejoined at 2.30
  p.m.) As the reports indicated the presence of many enemy ships&mdash;one a
  large cruiser&mdash;I considered that his force might not be strong enough to
  deal with the situation sufficiently rapidly, so at 11.30 a.m. the battle
  cruisers turned to E.S.E., and worked up to full speed. It was evident that
  to be of any value the support must be overwhelming and carried out at the
  highest speed possible.</p>

  <p>"I had not lost sight of the risk of submarines, and possible sortie in
  force from the enemy's base, especially in view of the mist to the
  southeast.</p>

  <p>"Our high speed, however, made submarine attack difficult, and the
  smoothness of the sea made their detection comparatively easy. I considered
  that we were powerful enough to deal with any sortie except by a battle
  squadron, which was unlikely to come out in time, provided our stroke was
  sufficiently rapid.</p>

  <p>"At 12.15 p.m. <i>Fearless</i> and First Flotilla were sighted retiring
  west. At the same time the Light Cruiser Squadron was observed to be engaging
  an enemy ship ahead. They appeared to have her beat.</p>

  <p>"I then steered N.E. to sounds of firing ahead, and at 12.30 p.m. sighted
  <i>Arethusa</i> and Third Flotilla retiring to the westward engaging a
  cruiser of the <i>Kolberg</i> class on our port bow. I steered to cut her off
  from Heligoland, and at 12.37 p.m. opened fire. At 12.42 the enemy turned to
  N.E., and we chased at 27 knots.</p>

  <p>"At 12.56 p.m. sighted and engaged a two-funnelled cruiser ahead.
  <i>Lion</i> fired two salvoes at her, which took effect, and she disappeared
  into the mist, burning furiously and in a sinking condition. In view of the
  mist and that she was steering at high speed at right angles to <i>Lion</i>,
  who was herself steaming at twenty-eight knots, the <i>Lions</i> firing was
  very creditable.</p>

  <p>"Our destroyers had reported the presence of floating mines to the
  eastward and I considered it inadvisable to pursue her. It was also essential
  that the squadron should remain concentrated, and I accordingly ordered a
  withdrawal. The battle cruisers turned north and circled to port to complete
  the destruction of the vessel first engaged. She was sighted again at 1.25
  p.m. steaming S.E. with colours still flying. <i>Lion</i> opened fire with
  two turrets, and at 1.35 p.m., after receiving two salvoes, she sank.</p>

  <p>"The four attached destroyers were sent to pick up survivors, but I deeply
  regret that they subsequently reported that they searched the area but found
  none.</p>

  <p>"At 1.40 p.m. the battle cruisers turned to the northward, and <i>Queen
  Mary</i> was again attacked by a submarine. The attack was avoided by the use
  of the helm. <i>Lowestoft</i> was also unsuccessfully attacked. The battle
  cruisers covered the retirement until nightfall. By 6 p.m. the retirement
  having been well executed and all destroyers accounted for, I altered course,
  spread the light cruisers, and swept northwards in accordance with the
  Commander-in-Chiefs orders. At 7.45 p.m. I detached <i>Liverpool</i> to
  Rosyth with German prisoners, seven officers and seventy-nine men, survivors
  from <i>Mainz</i>. No further incident occurred."</p>

  <p>Of Commodore Tyrwhitt, the Commander of the Destroyer Flotilla, both Rear-
  Admiral Beatty and Rear-Admiral Christian (commanding the Light Cruiser and
  Torpedo Boat Destroyer Flotilla), spoke in the most unstinted terms of
  praise.</p>

  <p>"His attack was delivered with great skill and gallantry," says the latter
  officer.</p>

  <p>Admiral Christian also mentioned Commodore Roger T. B. Keyes in
  <i>Lurcher</i>.</p>

  <p>"On the morning of August 28, in company with the <i>Firedrake</i>, he
  searched the area to the southward of the battle cruisers for the enemy's
  submarines, and subsequently having been detached, was present at the sinking
  of the German cruiser <i>Mainz</i>, when he gallantly proceeded alongside her
  and rescued 220 of her crew, many of whom were wounded. Subsequently he
  escorted <i>Laurel</i> and <i>Liberty</i> out of action, and kept them
  company till Rear-Admiral Campbell's cruisers were sighted."</p>

  <p>As regards the submarine officers the Admiral specially mentions the names
  of:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Lieutenant-Commander Ernest W. Leir. His coolness and resource in
  rescuing the crews of the <i>Goshawk's</i> and <i>Defender's</i> boats at a
  critical time of the action were admirable, and Lieutenant-Commander Cecil P.
  Talbot. "In my opinion, the bravery and resource of the officers in command
  of submarines since the war commenced are worthy of the highest
  commendation."</p>

  <p>Commodore Tyrwhitt's story takes us up into the thick of the fight.</p>

  <p>"On Thursday, August 27, in accordance with orders received from their
  lordships, I sailed in <i>Arethusa</i>, in company with the First and Third
  Flotillas, except <i>Hornet</i>, <i>Tigress</i>, <i>Hydra</i>, and
  <i>Loyal</i>, to carry out the pre-arranged operations. H.M.S.
  <i>Fearless</i> joined the flotillas at sea that afternoon.</p>

  <p>"At 6.53 a.m. on Friday, August 28, an enemy's destroyer was sighted, and
  was chased by the fourth division of the Third Flotilla.</p>

  <p>"From 7.20 to 7.57 a.m. <i>Arethusa</i> and the Third Flotilla were
  engaged with numerous destroyers and torpedo boats which were making for
  Heligoland; course was altered to port to cut them off.</p>

  <p>"Two cruisers, with four and two funnels respectively, were sighted on the
  port bow at 7.57 a.m., the nearest of which was engaged.
  <i>Arethusa</i>received a heavy fire from both cruisers and several
  destroyers until 8.15 a.m., when the four-funnelled cruiser transferred her
  fire to <i>Fearless</i>.</p>

  <p>"Close action was continued with the two-funnelled cruiser on converging
  courses until 8.25 a.m., when a 6-inch projectile from <i>Arethusa</i>
  wrecked the forebridge of the enemy, who at once turned away in the direction
  of Heligoland, which was sighted slightly on the starboard bow at about the
  same time.</p>

  <p>"All ships were at once ordered to turn to the westward, and shortly
  afterwards speed was reduced to 20 knots.</p>

  <p>"During this action <i>Arethusa</i> had been hit many times, and was
  considerably damaged; only one 6-inch gun remained in action, all other guns
  and torpedo tubes having been temporarily disabled.</p>

  <p>"Lieutenant Eric W. P. Westmacott (Signal Officer) was killed at my side
  during this action. I cannot refrain from adding that he carried out his
  duties calmly and collectedly, and was of the greatest assistance to me.</p>

  <p>"A fire occurred opposite No. 2 gun port side caused by a shell exploding
  some ammunition, resulting in a terrific blaze for a short period and leaving
  the deck burning. This was very promptly dealt with and extinguished by Chief
  Petty Officer Frederick W. Wrench, O.N. 158,630.</p>

  <p>"The flotillas were re-formed in divisions and proceeded at 20 knots. It
  was now noticed that <i>Arethusa's</i> speed had been reduced.</p>

  <p>"<i>Fearless</i> reported that the third and fifth divisions of the First
  Flotilla had sunk the German Commodore's destroyer and that two boats' crews
  belonging to <i>Defender</i> had been left behind, as our destroyers had been
  fired upon by a German cruiser during their act of mercy in saving the
  survivors of the German destroyer.</p>

  <p>"At 10 a.m., hearing that Commodore (S) in <i>Lurcher</i> and
  <i>Firedrake</i> were being chased by light cruisers, I proceeded to his
  assistance with <i>Fearless</i> and the First Flotilla until 10.37 a.m.,
  when, having received no news and being in the vicinity of Heligoland, I
  ordered the ships in company to turn to the westward.</p>

  <p>"All guns except two 4-inch were again in working order, and the upper
  deck supply of ammunition was replenished.</p>

  <p>"At 10.55 a.m. a four-funnelled German cruiser was sighted, and opened a
  very heavy fire about 11 o'clock.</p>

  <p>"Our position being somewhat critical, I ordered <i>Fearless</i> to
  attack, and the First Flotilla to attack with torpedoes, which they proceeded
  to do with great spirit. The cruiser at once turned away, disappeared in the
  haze and evaded the attack.</p>

  <p>"About ten minutes later the same cruiser appeared on our starboard
  quarter. Opened fire on her with both 6-inch guns; <i>Fearless</i> also
  engaged her, and one division of destroyers attacked her with torpedoes
  without success.</p>

  <p>"The state of affairs and our position was then reported to the Admiral
  commanding Battle Cruiser Squadron.</p>

  <p>"We received a very severe and almost accurate fire from this cruiser;
  salvo after salvo was falling between 10 and 30 yards short, but not a single
  shell struck; two torpedoes were also fired at us, being well directed, but
  short.</p>

  <p>"The cruiser was badly damaged by <i>Arethusa's</i> 6-inch guns and a
  splendidly directed fire from <i>Fearless</i>, and she shortly afterwards
  turned away in the direction of Heligoland.</p>

  <p>"Proceeded, and four minutes later sighted the three-funnelled cruiser
  <i>Mainz</i>. She endured a heavy fire from <i>Arethusa</i> and
  <i>Fearless</i>and many destroyers. After an action of approximately
  twenty-five minutes she was seen to be sinking by the head, her engines
  stopped, besides being on fire.</p>

  <p>"At this moment the Light Cruiser Squadron appeared, and they very
  speedily reduced the <i>Mainz</i> to a condition which must have been
  indescribable.</p>

  <p>"I then recalled <i>Fearless</i> and the destroyers, and ordered cease
  fire.</p>

  <p>"We then exchanged broadsides with a large four-funnelled cruiser on the
  starboard quarter at long range, without visible effect.</p>

  <p>"The Battle Cruiser Squadron now arrived, and I pointed out this cruiser
  to the Admiral Commanding, and was shortly afterwards informed by him that
  the cruiser in question had been sunk and another set on fire.</p>

  <p>"The weather during the day was fine, sea calm, but visibility poor, not
  more than three miles at any time when the various actions were taking place,
  and was such that ranging and spotting were rendered difficult.</p>

  <p>"I then proceeded with fourteen destroyers of the Third Flotilla and nine
  of the First Flotilla.</p>

  <p>"<i>Arethusa's</i> speed was about six knots until 7 p.m., when it was
  impossible to proceed any further, and fires were drawn in all boilers except
  two, and assistance called for.</p>

  <p>"At 9.30 p.m. Captain Wilmot S. Nicholson, of the <i>Hogue</i>,* took my
  ship in tow in a most seamanlike manner, and, observing that the night was
  pitch dark and the only lights showing were two small hand lanterns, I
  consider his action was one which deserves special notice from their
  Lordships.</p>

  <p class="footnote">* The <i>Hogue</i> was afterwards destroyed by
  submarine.</p>

  <p>"I would also specially recommend Lieutenant-Commander Arthur P. N.
  Thorowgood, of <i>Arethusa</i>, for the able manner he prepared the ship for
  being towed in the dark.</p>

  <p>"H.M. ship under my command was then towed to the Nore, arriving at 5 p.m.
  on August 29. Steam was then available for slow speed, and the ship was able
  to proceed to Chatham under her own steam.</p>

  <p>"I beg again to call attention to the services rendered by Captain W. F.
  Blunt, of H.M.S. <i>Fearless</i> and the Commanding Officers of the</p>

  <p>destroyers of the First and Third Flotillas, whose gallant attacks on the
  German cruisers at critical moments undoubtedly saved <i>Arethusa</i> from
  more severe punishment and possible capture.</p>

  <p>"I cannot adequately express my satisfaction and pride at the spirit and
  ardour of my officers and ship's company, who carried out their orders with
  the greatest alacrity under the most trying conditions, especially in view of
  the fact that the ship, newly built, had not been forty-eight hours out of
  the Dockyard before she was in action.</p>

  <p>"It is difficult to specially pick out individuals, but the following came
  under my special observation:</p><br>

  <p class="cp">H.M.S. <i>Arethusa</i>.</p>

  <p>"Lieutenant-Commander Arthur P. N. Thorowgood, First Lieutenant, and in
  charge of the After Control.</p>

  <p>"Lieutenant-Commander Ernest K. Arbuthnot (G), in charge of the Fore
  Control.</p>

  <p>"Sub-Lieutenant Clive A. Robinson, who worked the range-finder throughout
  the entire action with extraordinary coolness.</p>

  <p>"Assistant Paymaster Kenneth E. Badcock, my Secretary, who attended me on
  the bridge throughout the entire action.</p>

  <p>"Mr. James D. Godfrey, Gunner (T), who was in charge of the torpedo
  tubes.</p>

  <p>"The following men were specially noted:</p>

  <p>"Armourer Arthur F. Hayes, O.N. 342026 (Ch.).</p>

  <p>"Second Sick Berth Steward George Trolley, O.N. M.296 (Ch.).</p>

  <p>"Chief Yeoman of Signals Albert Fox, O.N. 194656 (Po.), on fore bridge
  during entire action.</p>

  <p>"Chief Petty Officer Frederick W. Wrench O.N. 158630 (Ch.) (for ready

  <p class="cp">H.M.S. <i>Laforey</i>.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ernest Roper, Chief Gunner, who carried out his duties with
  exceptional coolness under fire."</p>

  <p>The remarkable character of this, the first and certainly the most
  comprehensive of naval despatches, is that it gives the crew and all branches
  of the naval service engaged. Battleship cruiser, light cruiser and torpedo
  boat destroyer alike gave their version and to these may be added the report
  of Commodore Keyes, who flying his broad pennant on <i>Maidstone</i>,
  commanded the submarines.</p>

  <p>"Three hours after the outbreak of war Submarines E6 (Lieutenant-Commander
  Cecil P. Talbot) and E8 (Lieutenant-Commander Francis H. H. Goodhart)
  proceeded unaccompanied to carry out a reconnaissance in the Heligoland
  Bight. These two vessels returned with useful information, and had the
  privilege of being the pioneers on a service which is attended by some
  risk.</p>

  <p>"During the transportation of the Expeditionary Force the <i>Lurcher</i>
  and <i>Firedrake</i> and all the Submarines of the Eighth Submarine Flotilla
  occupied positions from which they could have attacked the High Sea Fleet had
  it emerged to dispute the passage of our transports. This patrol was
  maintained day and night without relief until the <i>personnel</i> of our
  Army had been transported and all chance of effective interference had
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>"These submarines have since been incessantly employed on the enemy's
  coast in the Heligoland Bight and elsewhere, and have obtained much valuable
  information regarding the composition and movement of his patrols. They have
  occupied his waters and reconnoitred his anchorages, and, while so engaged,
  have been subjected to skilful and well executed anti-submarine tactics;
  hunted for hours at a time by torpedo craft and attacked by gunfire and
  torpedoes.</p>

  <p>"At midnight on August 26, I embarked in the <i>Lurcher</i>, and in
  company with <i>Firedrake</i> and Submarines D2, D8, E4, E5, E6, E7, E8, and
  E9, of the Eighth Submarine Flotilla, proceeded to take part in the
  operations in the Heligoland Bight arranged for August 28. The destroyers
  scouted for the submarines until nightfall on the 27th, when the latter
  proceeded independently to take up various positions from which they could
  co-operate with the destroyer flotillas on the following morning.</p>

  <p>"At daylight on August 28 the <i>Lurcher</i> and <i>Firedrake</i> searched
  the area, through which the battle cruisers were to advance, for hostile
  submarines, and then proceeded towards Heligoland in the wake of Submarines
  E6, E7, and E8, which were exposing themselves with the object of inducing
  the enemy to chase them to the westward.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* It was this daring manoeuvre which induced the German
  cruisers to move into the open sea.</p>

  <p>"On approaching Heligoland, the visibility which had been very good to
  seaward, reduced to 5,000 to 6,000 yards, and this added considerably to the
  anxieties and responsibilities of the commanding officers of submarines, who
  handled their vessels with coolness and judgment in an area which was
  necessarily occupied by friends as well as foes.</p>

  <p>"Low visibility and calm sea are the most unfavourable conditions under
  which submarines can operate, and no opportunity occurred of closing with the
  enemy's cruisers to within torpedo range.</p>

  <p>"Lieutenant-Commander Ernest W. Leir, commanding Submarine E4, witnessed
  the sinking of the German Torpedo Boat Destroyer V187 through his periscope,
  and, observing a cruiser of the <i>Stettin</i> class close, and open fire on
  the British destroyers which had lowered their boats to pick up the
  survivors, he proceeded to attack the cruiser, but she altered course before
  he could get within range. After covering the retirement of our destroyers,
  which had had to abandon their boats, he returned to the latter, and embarked
  a lieutenant and nine men of <i>Defender</i>, who had been left behind. The
  boats also contained two officers and eight men of V187, who were unwounded,
  and eighteen men who were badly wounded.</p>

  <p>"As he could not embark the latter, Lieutenant-Commander Leir left one of
  the officers and six unwounded men to navigate the British boats to
  Heligoland. Before leaving he saw that they were provided with water,
  biscuit, and a compass. One German officer and two men were made prisoners of
  war.</p>

  <p>"Lieutenant-Commander Leir's action in remaining on the surface in the
  vicinity of the enemy and in a visibility which would have placed his vessel
  within easy gun range of an enemy appearing out of the mist, was altogether
  admirable.</p>

  <p>"This enterprising and gallant officer took part in the reconnaissance
  which supplied the information on which these operations were based, and I
  beg to submit his name and that of Lieutenant-Commander Talbot, the
  Commanding Officer of E6, who exercised patience, judgment, and skill in a
  dangerous position, for the favourable consideration of their Lordships.</p>

  <p>"On the 13th September E9 (Lieutenant-Commander Max K. Horton) torpedoed
  and sank the German light cruiser <i>Hela</i> six miles south of
  Heligoland.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* Lieut. Max Horton was later to distinguish himself
  further, for he subsequently torpedoed a big German cruiser in the Baltic "A
  number of destroyers were evidently called to the scene after E9 had
  delivered her attack, and these hunted her for several hours.</p>

  <p>"On the 14th September, in accordance with his orders,
  Lieutenant-Commander Horton examined the outer anchorage of Heligoland, a
  service attended by considerable risk.</p>

  <p>"On the 25th September Submarine E6 (Lieutenant-Commander C. P. Talbot),
  while diving, fouled the moorings of a mine laid by the enemy. On rising to
  the surface she weighed the mine and sinker; the former was securely fixed
  between the hydroplane and its guard; fortunately, however, the horns of the
  mine were pointed outboard. The weight of the sinker made it a difficult and
  dangerous matter to lift the mine clear without exploding it. After half an
  hour's patient work this was effected by Lieutenant Frederick A. P.
  Williams-Freeman and Able Seaman Ernest Randall Cremer, official number
  214235, and the released mine descended to its original depth.</p>

  <p>"On the 6th October E9 (Lieutenant-Commander Max K. Horton), when
  patrolling off the Ems, torpedoed and sank the enemy's destroyer Si 26.</p>

  <p>"The enemy's torpedo craft pursue tactics which, in connection with their
  shallow draught, make them exceedingly difficult to attack with torpedo, and
  Lieutenant-Commander Horton's success was the result of much patient and
  skilful zeal. He is a most enterprising submarine officer, and I beg to
  submit his name for favourable consideration.</p>

  <p>"Lieutenant Charles M. S. Chapman, the second in command of E9, is also
  deserving of credit.</p>

  <p>"Against an enemy whose capital vessels have never, and light cruisers
  have seldom, emerged from their fortified harbours, opportunities of
  delivering submarine attacks have necessarily been few, and on one occasion
  only, prior to the 13th September, has one of our submarines been within
  torpedo range of a cruiser during daylight hours.</p>

  <p>"During the exceptionally heavy westerly gales which prevailed between the
  14th and 21st September the position of the submarines on a lee shore, within
  a few miles of the enemy's coast, was an unpleasant one.</p>

  <p>"The short, steep seas, which accompany westerly gales in the Heligoland
  Bight, made it difficult to keep the conning tower hatches open. There was no
  rest to be obtained and even when cruising at a depth of sixty feet the
  submarines were rolling considerably, and pumping, <i>i.e.</i>, vertically
  moving about twenty feet.</p>

  <p>"I submit that it was creditable to the commanding officers that they
  should have maintained their stations under such conditions.</p>

  <p>"Service in the Heligoland Bight is keenly sought after by the commanding
  officers of the eighth submarine flotilla, and they have all shown daring and
  enterprise in the execution of their duties. These officers have unanimously
  expressed to me their admiration of the cool and gallant behaviour of the
  officers and men under their command. They are, however, of the opinion that
  it is impossible to single out individuals when all have performed their
  duties so admirably, and in this I concur."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. &mdash; THE OUTER FLEETS</h2>

  <p>There are things that must always be remembered, in estimating the work of
  the Navy. There are the peculiar nature of the task allotted to the Navy, the
  part it was expected to play in bringing about the end of the enemy's
  resistance, the difficulties and the enormous dangers it was called upon to
  share. These things considered, when we ask ourselves if the British Navy had
  carried out its part of the contract in the great war, there can be no other
  answer than an emphatic affirmative.</p>

  <p>We were not fighting the German Navy, we were fighting the German nation.-
  Sheltered behind the men doing their splendid work up and down the seas were
  millions of people who looked to them for assistance in carrying out their
  daily avocations. They looked to the sea to bring them the means of
  livelihood, the raw materials to fashion into finished products, the coal,
  the iron ores, the fabrics, or the raw material of fabrics, and, vitally
  necessary, food to sustain life within the Empire.</p>

  <p>Countries cannot live on themselves under modern economic conditions. They
  must have customers and clients to whom they must have access. When neither
  raw material is coming in nor completed manufacture going out, factories
  close down, many people are thrown out of employment, and labourers who were
  till then not only self-sustaining but were helping in the larger business of
  upholding the State, become a burden upon the nation.</p>

  <p>So that, since Germany depended very largely upon seaborne trade, and
  since all her land borders save one were in the hands of the enemy, it is not
  difficult to understand the first duty of the Navy and the paramount
  importance of the task which was set for Admiral Jellicoe. It was a task
  which meant a constant hazardous patrolling and a continuous search of ships,
  neutral as well as enemy, since it has been found, and has been proved during
  the present war, that the German secured most of his advantages under a flag
  which was not his.</p>

  <p>All this and more the Navy did, in its unwinking watch over the seas.
  Daily, hourly, our Navy spelt out the far-reaching significance of sea-power.
  In addition to its ceaseless patrolling, its tireless searching, which means
  the strangle-hold upon the trading of our enemy, it convoyed the great
  transports, with their war-material of men and guns, from the far places of
  the Empire.</p>

  <p>It was not to be expected that its work could be carried on without
  mishap. Mine and raiding submarine were constantly at work against our ships.
  The nature of the work the Navy had to do made it, as it were, an enormous
  target for the enemy. Our own submarines had little chance of retaliating in
  like manner, for the German Navy lay behind the bolted doors of its secure
  harbours.</p>

  <p>On page 35 is given a comparative list of disasters on the British and the
  German sides, up to the end of the first year of war. It will help the reader
  to understand the character of the naval war. It was of a character
  inevitable so far as our Navy was concerned.</p>

  <p>The D5 was sunk as the aftermath of a visit of four German cruisers to our
  shores. A coastguard gunboat, the <i>Halcyon</i>, was engaged in patrolling
  early one misty morning, off Lowestoft, when the enemy's cruisers appeared.
  They fired several shots, damaging the <i>Halcyon's</i> wireless, and then
  made a prompt retreat at full speed. Although shadowed by some of our light
  cruisers, they could not be brought to action before dusk, and our pursuit
  was abandoned. One of these fleeing cruisers threw out a number of mines, and
  submarine D5 was sunk by exploding one of these.</p>

  <p>It was afterwards learnt that the <i>Yorck</i>, a German cruiser which was
  presumably one of the squadron that had taken part in this spectacular but
  ineffective raid, had sunk owing to collision with one of the mines guarding
  Wilhelmshaven.</p>

  <p>Of all the German ships the <i>Emden</i> gained the greatest notoriety,
  and it is a commentary upon the character of the British race that, in spite
  of the enormous amount of damage which the <i>Emden</i> did to British
  shipping&mdash;she paralysed the East Indian trade for over a month&mdash;the
  British people heartily admired the skill and courage of her Commander and
  crew, and paid willing tribute to the courtesy which Captain von Muller
  invariably showed to those who unfortunately came across the <i>Emden's</i>
  path.</p>

  <p>When war broke out the <i>Emden</i>, a light armoured cruiser, was
  stationed at Kiao-chau, and possibly the inevitability of Japan joining in
  caused the German Admiralty to detach this light, fast cruiser to her work of
  destruction. Attended by colliers, she disappeared from the China seas, and
  reappeared in the Indian Ocean on September 10th.</p>

  <p><a id="picX"
     name="picX"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1400091h-images/SHoW4-Table.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>The greater portion of the British fleet was at that time engaged in
  convoying the Indian contingent to Europe, so that the Captain of the
  <i>Emden</i> knew that he might with impunity come prowling through the
  Indian seas on the off-chance of picking up a few stray merchantmen. In this
  surmise he was justified, for in four days he had captured and sunk six
  merchant ships, removing their crews before sending the vessels to the
  bottom. On the 22nd the <i>Emden</i> suddenly appeared before Madras, and
  with an audacity worthy of the best traditions of the British Navy&mdash;
  upon which the German Navy was modelled&mdash;she bombarded this important
  Indian town, doing no more damage, however, than setting fire to a number of
  oil tanks. The time was night, and the bombardment only lasted for a quarter
  of an hour. Again she vanished, and news came of her in the Indian Ocean,
  where she went to work capturing and sinking the British merchantmen that
  came her way. An instance of Captain von Muller's humanity is cited in the
  case of the <i>Kabinga</i>. Yon Muller had intended sinking this vessel, when
  he found that the captain's wife was on board. He personally interviewed the
  lady.</p>

  <p>"I cannot send you adrift in an open boat," he said with a twinkle in his
  eye, "so you must <i>go</i> back to England and tell the owners of the
  <i>Kabinga</i> that she is to be regarded as having been captured and sunk. .
  I present the ship to you."</p>

  <p>And thus with a laugh he spared the boat.</p>

  <p>In the middle of October H.M.S. <i>Yarmouth</i>, which had been
  ceaselessly searching for this pest of the ocean, came upon the
  Hamburg-Amerika liner <i>Marcomania</i>, and a Greek steamer which had been
  accompanying the <i>Emden</i> and carrying coal and ammunition for the
  vessel.</p>

  <p>These two ships were promptly sunk by the British Commander, who could not
  afford at the moment to put a prize crew on board and send them into port.
  Undoubtedly this was a very great blow to the <i>Emden</i>; but between that
  period and October 22 she had sunk five more ships in the south-west.</p>

  <p>The Admiralty recognised the feeling of unrest and insecurity which the
  presence of this ship created, and there was a concentration of fast
  cruisers, including French, Russian, and Japanese working in harmony with His
  Majesty's Australian ships <i>Melbourne</i> and <i>Sydney</i>, to search out
  and sink this danger to British commerce. Before she was captured, however,
  the <i>Emden</i> was to embark upon her last and most daring exploit.</p>

  <p>Rigging an extra funnel to disguise herself, she steamed boldly into the
  roadstead at Penang, where there lay at anchor a Russian cruiser and a French
  destroyer. The new vessel's arrival was sighted by the officer of the watch
  on the Russian cruiser, and an interrogatory signal was flown to which the
  <i>Emden</i> replied "<i>Yarmouth</i> coming to an anchor." She came at full
  speed into the roadstead, and before anybody could realise what was happening
  she had slipped two torpedoes at the Russian, and then, as the French
  destroyer moved up to attack, she opened fire with both broadsides upon her
  two unprepared enemies, and sunk them at their moorings.</p>

  <p>Nemesis was on her track, however. She went into Keeling Cocos Island with
  the object of destroying the wireless apparatus in that isolated spot, and
  the telegraph operator, recognising her, flashed out a warning signal which
  was picked up by the <i>Minotaur</i> and transmitted to H.M.S.
  <i>Sydney</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Emden</i> landed a party which destroyed the instruments; but in
  the midst of their work of destruction the <i>Emden's</i> siren called them
  back. Before the landing party could reach the boat she was under way, for on
  the horizon loomed the grey hull of the <i>Sydney</i>, and her guns were
  already getting the range. The <i>Emden's</i> two funnels were shot away and
  she ran ashore, burning fiercely aft. Her losses were very heavy. The
  superior range of the <i>Sydney's</i> guns enabled the Commander of the
  Australian ship severely to damage his enemy without himself coming into
  range, except at the beginning of the action, when a well- placed shot by the
  <i>Emden</i> destroyed the range-finding apparatus and killed three men.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously with the publication of this fine exploit came the news, no
  less encouraging, that another of the German commerce destroyers, the
  <i>Königsberg</i>, had been located up an East African river, and had been
  bottled up by the sinking of a collier in the fairway. The <i>Königsberg</i>
  was the ship which bombarded the <i>Pegasus</i> while it lay at anchor at
  Zanzibar.</p>

  <p>In the Pacific a serious action off the coast of Chili resulted in our
  losing two cruisers, the <i>Good Hope</i> (the flagship of the Pacific
  Squadron) and the <i>Monmouth</i>. They tackled a superior concentration of
  German ships, including the <i>Scharnhorst</i> and the <i>Gneisenau</i>,
  which were lucky in having far heavier armament than the British ships
  possessed. The <i>Glasgow</i>survived and reached Valparaiso to tell the
  story of the unequal combat, Captain John Luce, of the <i>Glasgow</i>, having
  told the following story, a thrilling record of a gallant losing
  fight:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"2 p.m.&mdash;Flagship signalled that apparently from wireless calls there
  was an enemy ship to northward. Orders were given for squadron to spread N.E.
  by E. in the following order:&mdash;<i>Good Hope</i>, <i>Monmouth</i>,
  <i>Otranto</i> and <i>Glasgow</i>, speed to be worked up to 15 knots.</p>

  <p>"4.20 p.m.&mdash;Saw smoke; proved to be enemy ships, one small cruiser
  and two armoured cruisers. <i>Glasgow</i> reported to Admiral, ships in sight
  were warned and all concentrated on <i>Good Hope</i>.</p>

  <p>"5.47 p.m.&mdash;Squadron formed in line ahead in following order: <i>Good
  Hope</i>, <i>Monmouth</i>, <i>Glasgow</i>, <i>Otranto</i>. Enemy, who had
  turned south, were now in single line ahead, 12 miles off, <i>Scharnhorst</i>
  and <i>Gneisenau</i> leading.</p>

  <p>"6.18 p.m.&mdash;Speed ordered to 17 knots, and flagship signalled
  <i>Canopus</i>: 'I am going to attack enemy now.' Enemy were now 15,000 yards
  away, and maintained this range, at the same time jambing wireless signals.
  By this time sun was setting immediately behind us from enemy position . . .
  and while it remained above horizon we had advantage in light, but range too
  great.</p>

  <p>"6.55 p.m.&mdash;Sun set, and visibility conditions altered, our ships
  being silhouetted against afterglow, and failing light made enemy difficult
  to see.</p>

  <p>"7.3 p.m.&mdash;Enemy opened fired 12,000 yards, followed in quick
  succession by <i>Good Hope</i>, <i>Monmouth</i>, <i>Glasgow</i>. Two
  squadrons were now converging, and each ship engaged opposite number in the
  line. Growing darkness and heavy spray of head sea made firing difficult,
  particularly for main deck guns of <i>Good Hope</i> and <i>Monmouth</i>.
  Enemy firing salvoes got range quickly, and their third salvo caused fire to
  break out on fore part of both ships, which were constantly on fire till 7.45
  p.m.</p>

  <p>"7.50 p.m.&mdash;Immense explosion occurred on <i>Good Hope</i> amidships,
  flames reaching 200 feet high. Total destruction must have followed. It was
  now quite dark. Both sides continued firing at flashes of opposing guns.
  <i>Monmouth</i> was badly down by the bow and turned away to get stern to
  sea, signalling to <i>Glasgow</i> to that effect.</p>

  <p>"8.30 p.m.&mdash;<i>Glasgow</i> signalled to <i>Monmouth 4</i> enemy
  following us,' but received no reply. Under rising moon, enemy's ships were
  now seen approaching, and as <i>Glasgow</i> could render <i>Monmouth</i> no
  assistance, she proceeded at full speed to avoid destruction.</p>

  <p>"8.50 p.m.&mdash;Lost sight of enemy.</p>

  <p>"9.20 p.m.&mdash;Observed seventy-five flashes of fire, which was no doubt
  final attack on <i>Monmouth</i>.</p>

  <p>"Nothing could have been more admirable than the conduct of officers and
  men throughout. Though it was most trying to receive a great volume of fire
  without chance of returning it adequately, all kept perfectly cool, there was
  no wild firing, and discipline was the same as at battle practice.</p>

  <p>"When target ceased to be visible gun-layers spontaneously ceased
  fire.</p>

  <p>"The serious reverse sustained has entirely failed to impair the spirit of
  officers and ships company, and it is our unanimous wish to meet the enemy
  again as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>Admiral Cradock, who commanded the British squadron, had undoubtedly a
  force wholly inadequate to deal with the German vessels, should they decide
  upon a combination. The <i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i> were superior
  to any ship which the British admiral had in his squadron, though the <i>Good
  Hope</i> could boast of two 9*2 guns, as against the 8-inch batteries of the
  enemy. But the 9 2, admirable weapon as it was in the days when it was the
  pet gun of the Navy, is a type of gun which was modern&mdash;twenty years
  ago. If you eliminate the 9'2 guns, then the British ships were at a great
  disadvantage to their enemy; for between them the German carried sixteen 8 2
  guns, and no fewer than seventy- two smaller pieces ranging from 3*4 up to
  5*9, as against the two 9'2 and forty- two other guns varying from 4-inch to
  6-inch. The <i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i> were two of the newest
  ships that Germany had launched, whilst on the other hand the <i>Good
  Hope</i> was a fifteen year old boat, and her main deck guns were so placed
  that in a heavy sea they were almost awash.</p>

  <p>Recognising something of the danger, the Admiralty had detached an old
  battleship, the <i>Canopus</i>, to act with Admiral Cradock, but she
  unfortunately was without speed, though she carried 12-inch guns, which would
  give the British Squadron superiority over the enemy. The <i>Canopus</i> had
  not arrived, though it was apparently within signalling distance, on November
  1st, when the <i>Good Hope</i>, sweeping slowly down the stormy sea off the
  south-west coast of South America, picked up a suspicious wireless message
  which suggested that an enemy warship was somewhere in the vicinity. The
  flagship sent a wireless to the <i>Monmouth</i>, the <i>Otranto</i> (a
  converted liner) and the <i>Glasgow</i>, to concentrate at a given point; and
  at half-past four that afternoon the British squadron, labouring through a
  heavy sea with a northerly gale, increasing every moment until it was almost
  a hurricane, blowing on their quarter, sighted smoke on the horizon, and
  presently made out a small cruiser and two armoured cruisers. Admiral
  Cradock's position was a dangerous one. He could recognise the gun
  superiority of his enemy. He could not afford to wait for the <i>Canopus</i>,
  a slow ship, nor could he afford again to lose sight of his elusive enemy. He
  signalled to form line ahead, and with the flagship leading, followed by the
  <i>Monmouth</i>, <i>Glasgow</i>, and <i>Otranto</i>, the squadron steamed
  inward, drawing closer every minute to the enemy. Both fleets were steaming
  in the same direction, and both altered their course inward to bring them
  together. It was a wild and impressive scene, that November night; the great,
  green waves, mountain high, the squadrons wallowing and rolling through the
  tumbling ocean, their decks awash and green sea sweeping over them. The sun
  was setting redly in the west, and the afterglow threw the ships of the
  British squadron into high relief, leaving the enemy veiled in the grey of
  the coming night. At seven o'clock fire was opened at 12,000 yards by the
  enemy, and the <i>Good Hope</i>, <i>Monmouth</i>, and <i>Glasgow</i>
  instantly came into action, the squadrons converging. The conditions were
  abnormal. Around the guns the men slipped and staggered as the shuddering
  vessels sunk and rose in the trough of the sea, and the icy blast of the
  hurricane shrieked along the unprotected decks and blinded the gunners with
  spray. Too soon the enemy's salvoes found their mark, and one of the 9*2
  guns, which represented the only hope the British squadron had of outmatching
  the enemy, was put out of action a few minutes after the fight began.</p>

  <p>With her smaller guns awash, with her big guns out of action, the <i>Good
  Hope</i> was a target for the great German cruisers to pound. Neither the
  <i>Monmouth</i> nor the <i>Good Hope</i> could make effective reply, and
  after half-an-hour of this unequal fight, both ships burning fore and aft,
  the <i>Good Hope</i> blew up amidships and went down in the dark. The
  <i>Glasgow</i> now moved off.</p>

  <p>As we have seen by her Captain's despatch, she could render no assistance
  to the unfortunate <i>Monmouth</i>. This ship, with a bad list and making
  water rapidly, suddenly turned, signalling to the <i>Glasgow</i> to make for
  safety. "I am going to try to ram one of them," was her laconic signal, and
  that, and the stabbing pencils of gun fire in the dark, were all that the
  <i>Glasgow</i> could see of the doomed ship. Her gallant crew went to their
  death in a super-heroic attempt to destroy their enemy even in their last
  throes. Not a soul was saved from either the <i>Monmouth</i> or <i>Good
  Hope</i>.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>In that action the German ships engaged were the <i>Gneisenau</i> and the
  <i>Scharnhorst</i>, with the smaller <i>Nürnberg</i>. Both from the official
  account and from that supplied by eye-witnesses of the the fight, it does not
  seem that any other German vessel took part, and possibly the claim that the
  <i>Nürnberg</i> was the ship that gave the <i>Monmouth</i> her quietus was
  justified. Such a reverse, coming on the top of the success we had gained
  against the <i>Emden</i>, had a dispiriting effect, but the Admiralty acted
  with commendable promptitude. There was at Whitehall at this time Admiral
  Sturdee, who was acting as Chief of Staff to Lord Fisher. With no delay
  whatever he left his office chair, and, after the briefest instructions,
  journeyed to a certain port where the nucleus o%a new fleet was waiting, and
  hoisting his flag, set his squadron's bows direct for the eastern coast of
  South America.</p>

  <p>We may suppose that the Japanese Fleet, already scouring the Pacific, were
  moving up in strength to force the enemy to leave the western waters. It is
  known that the <i>Scharnhorst</i>, <i>Gneisenau</i>, <i>Nürnberg</i>,
  <i>Dresden</i> and <i>Leipzig</i> rounded the Cape of Good Hope and moved up
  to that rendezvous where their colliers and their supplies were waiting. But
  within six weeks of their victory they paid the price.</p>

  <p>It was a very strong squadron that Admiral Sturdee commanded, including
  the big battle cruisers, <i>Invincible</i> and <i>Inflexible</i>. On December
  7th the British ships arrived at Port Stanley to coal, leaving the
  <i>Canopus</i> on guard outside the harbour. A fine intelligence system
  served Admiral Sturdee well, for on the very next day the German squadron
  under Admiral von Spee appeared (doubtless with the intention of seizing the
  islands and provisioning his ships) and, seeing only the
  <i>Canopus</i>&mdash;an easy prey&mdash;-advanced at once to the attack.
  Swiftly he discovered the trap laid for him, but not swiftly enough, for it
  was too late to run when the other British ships appeared and gave
  battle.</p>

  <p>Since his defeat of Sir Christopher Cradock's squadron, von Spee had been
  harassed by the knowledge that English and Japanese ships were sweeping
  eastward in pursuit of him. But it is probable that he had been fairly
  confident that no new danger would threaten him from the Atlantic. Now, to
  his surprise, he had to face Sturdee's ships, their crews hot to avenge their
  fallen comrades.</p>

  <p>From the beginning there could only be one end to the encounter. But von
  Spee, heavily over-matched, fought bravely on his flagship, upon which the
  British vessels at first concentrated their fire. At the end of an hour she
  began to settle, but she refused to surrender; at last her bow lifted out of
  the water, there was a great coughing of steam, and she went down with all on
  board. With the <i>Gneisenau</i> and the <i>Leipzig</i> it was the same.</p>

  <p>The battle was not of long duration. The <i>Scharnhorst</i>,
  <i>Gneisenau</i> and <i>Leipzig</i> were shot down with a loss to the Germans
  of probably 1,800 men, and the <i>Nürnberg</i> and <i>Dresden</i> utilising
  their great speed, sought to escape. This the <i>Dresden</i> succeeded in
  accomplishing, for she was three knots faster than her unfortunate companion.
  The <i>Nürnberg</i>, chased by fast cruisers, was destroyed by shell fire,
  and the <i>Dresden</i> slipped her pursuers, only to avert the evil day of
  her destruction, which from the first was inevitable.</p>

  <p>Thus ended the great adventure which had begun with the declaration of
  war. It had seen the destruction of the <i>Scharnhorst</i>, <i>Gneisenau</i>,
  <i>Emden</i>, <i>Leipzig</i>, <i>Nürnberg</i>, and the bottling up of the
  <i>Königsberg</i>. Of the ships which Germany had sent out to harass the
  commerce of the Allies, only <i>Karlsruhe</i> and <i>Dresden</i> remained.
  <i>Karlsruhe</i> subsequently blew up whilst <i>Dresden</i> was finally
  brought to bay off the coast of Chili.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; NORTH SEA BRUSHES</h2>

  <p>Throughout the war there was a certain co-ordination between the land and
  sea forces of the Crown which was apparent even to those unimaginative people
  who might not see at first glance what association there was between the
  destruction of von Spee's squadron and the safety of our army in France. Yet
  that association was very real. Sometimes the events on land had a very real
  connection with the naval position and in one case, the employment of the
  Monitors <i>Severn</i> and <i>Mersey</i> to shell the German trenches near
  Lombartzyde, the cooperation was expressed in a visible shape.</p>

  <p>Toward the end of November the enemy was becoming desperate. The
  exhilaration which had been created in Berlin by the sinking of the <i>Good
  Hope</i> and the <i>Monmouth</i> off the coast of Chile, and by the victory
  which Germany had claimed to have inflicted upon the Russians, was replaced
  by a sense of depression and bitter chagrin when the news came that the fine
  Southern Pacific Squadron of the German Navy had been wiped out by Admiral
  Sturdee near the Falkland Islands. Add to this the fact that day after day
  had passed without any confirmation being received of the success which was
  supposed to have attended von Hindenburg's efforts against Warsaw, and you
  may realise something of that wave of impotent rage which swept across
  Germany, and induced the Great General Staff to find some desperate method of
  reviving the flagging spirits of the German people.</p>

  <p>It was no heroic method that was chosen, no exploit undertaken which will
  live in German history as a deed of incomparable daring. Rather it is one of
  which the German will, in years to come, be loth to speak. On the night of
  November 15th five cruisers slipped out of Wilhelmshaven in the dark. Three
  of these were battle cruisers and two were light, unarmoured vessels; but all
  had the advantage of immense speed. A thick mist lay on the water, as with
  every light extinguished and steaming line ahead, the battle cruisers
  leading, the German fleet went at full speed westward. The journey was
  fraught with many dangers. British submarines and torpedo boats were
  patrolling the outer circle of German waters; cruisers were everywhere on the
  look-out for stray enemy craft. But the German evidently moved with complete
  confidence, for he was in possession of all the information he required as to
  the movements and the exact location of every British vessel. The system of
  espionage which had been going on in England ever since the war started
  served him in excellent stead. Not so excellent, however, but that the
  British Fleet learned at midnight that four or five vessels had succeeded in
  making their escape through the cordon, and in the early hours of the morning
  British battleship cruisers moved stealthily out from their bases and began
  to search the wide space of ocean for their enemy.</p>

  <p>Seeking for enemy ships by night is a difficult matter under the most
  favourable circumstances. Looking for him in the early hours of that morning,
  when a sea fog covered the face of the water, was well-nigh hopeless.</p>

  <p>Scarborough, the queen of British watering places, might well imagine war
  to be remote and apart from its own quiet, suave existence. People woke
  between seven and eight to a grey dawn and a thin driving mist, and may have
  felt some sense of satisfaction and pride when through the sea three great
  men-of-war came stealing cautiously towards the land. Scarborough itself, or
  such of Scarborough as was awake at that moment, had no doubt in its mind
  that these ships were British men-of-war. They had seen them before. The
  advent of battleships and cruisers was no new experience, and the few idlers
  on the sea front who were abroad at that hour speculated upon the names of
  these great grey shapes.</p>

  <p>Then without warning the three ships belched fire. A strange new sound
  came to the peaceful people of the Yorkshire town. The dreadful scream of
  shell; the crashing of high explosives as the shells reached their objective;
  the frenzied cries of women struck down by murderous salvoes; the roar and
  tear of shattered buildings; the crashing of falling masonry; all these
  things told too plainly the almost unbelievable news that Scarborough,
  peaceful, unarmed and undefended, was the object of a German attack.</p>

  <p>The raid itself, of course, had no military value whatever. So far from
  shaking the faith of the British, either in the justice of their cause or in
  the inevitability of their victory, the attack resulted in a great increase
  of recruits, for it brought home to even the most laggard of our fellow
  countrymen the realisation of the length to which the German would go to
  secure his ends. In a letter to the Mayor of Scarborough, Mr. Winston
  Churchill the First Lord of the Admiralty, designated the German squadron as
  baby-killers, and as baby- killers they will be remembered to the end of
  their days. The ignobility of the attack is, as I say, made evident by the
  complete suppression of the names of the ships which took part in the raid.
  It was not a matter of which any German sailor can be proud. There was an
  additional reason for secrecy to be found in the possibility of drastic
  reprisal if ever the captains of these ships fell into British hands.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; DESTRUCTION OF THE BLÜCHER</h2>

  <p>The Scarborough raid, hailed with joy in Germany as an indication of
  Britain's inability to keep the seas, was successful only by the greatest of
  flukes. The British Admiralty had ample warning of the German intention, but
  their information led them to believe that the objective of the German Fleet
  was another part of the coast. To meet this raid a considerable force had
  been got together. When news came that the German had changed his plans and
  that he was already bombarding Scarborough, the Fleet set off with all haste
  to intercept the enemy, and would have succeeded in this object but for the
  fact that utilising a friendly fog bank, the German Fleet disappeared into
  the mist and made its escape.</p>

  <p>The British Admiralty were equally well informed as to the departure of a
  Fleet which left Cuxhaven after dark on Saturday, January 23rd, and steamed
  slowly westward. It consisted of <i>Derfflinger</i>, <i>Seydlitz</i>,
  <i>Moltke</i>, <i>Blücher</i>, a number of small cruisers, including
  <i>Kolberg</i>, and a fleet of submarines and destroyers. When the news was
  received that this fleet was on its way, the British Battle Cruiser Squadron,
  under Admiral Sir David Beatty, consisting of <i>Lion</i> (flagship),
  <i>Tiger</i>, <i>Princess Royal</i>, <i>New Zealand</i>, and
  <i>Indomitable</i>, accompanied by a number of small craft, moved out to
  intercept the marauder, who was setting his course probably for
  Newcastle.</p>

  <p>The composition of the enemy's squadron was interesting.
  <i>Derfflinger</i> was a brand-new ship, laid down only eighteen months
  previously and only completed for sea in November, 1914. She was perhaps the
  most powerful of Germany's battle cruisers. <i>Moltke</i> was a sister ship
  to <i>Goeben</i>, the Dreadnought cruiser which escaped our Fleet in the
  Mediterranean and ran for safety to the Dardanelles, afterwards being taken
  over by the Turk. <i>Seydlitz</i> was a very fast and powerful battle
  cruiser; <i>Blücher</i>was a ship which was laid down in error, the Germans
  having received inaccurate information as to our ship- building intentions
  and having built <i>Blücher</i> with the idea of going one better than a
  mysterious ship which the British were building in one of the dockyards. That
  ship, as it happened, was <i>Dreadnought</i>, which, because of its size and
  its armaments, entirely negatived this effort of the German Admiralty, and
  established a new model for the world.</p>

  <p>On the British side, <i>Lion</i>, a very powerful Dreadnought cruiser, was
  remarkable for its great speed. <i>Tiger</i> was not ready for the sea when
  war broke out, but <i>Princess Royal</i>, <i>New Zealand</i> and
  <i>Indomitable</i>had all seen much sea service. Of these five
  <i>Indomitable</i> was the slowest. Cooperating with the battle-cruiser fleet
  was a destroyer flotilla, under Commodore Tyrwhitt who carried into action
  <i>Arethusa</i> and <i>Undaunted</i>, two ships which had already made their
  mark in the naval history of the war.</p>

  <p>Unaware of the preparations which were being made to receive him, the
  German Admiral (probably Admiral Funke) came swiftly through the night,
  having distributed his instructions to his captains as to their objective.
  There is not much reason to doubt that that objective was again the
  undefended coast line.</p>

  <p>The Marconi signallers on the German battleships, with their ear-pieces
  strapped to their heads, listened intently for any errant signal which would
  betray the presence of British warships. One signal alone came to
  them&mdash;the signal of a patrolling warship which was at that moment
  communicating with the shore a request concerning the domestic economy of the
  ship. Such a message was immensely gratifying to the German Admiral, who
  found in this innocent communication support for his faith in British
  unpreparedness.</p>

  <p>The shock came at a little after seven in the morning, when, on the
  horizon, his look-out detected five pillars of misty smoke at suspiciously
  regular intervals. A scrutiny of these satisfied the German Admiral as to
  their nature. A string of signals fluttered up to his mainmast, and in
  obedience, this mighty fleet of Germany immediately swung round and headed
  for home with all speed.</p>

  <p>At this time the ships of the British Fleet were not even visible to the
  naked eye. They were, indeed, no more than a blur of dun-coloured smoke upon
  the horizon, but the German Admiral, through his telescope, had been able to
  make out the composition of the force which was opposing him, and he was
  quite satisfied that discretion should be the better part of his valour.</p>

  <p>Then ensued a thrilling flight, demoralising to the pursued, exhilarating
  to the pursuer, as every hour brought him nearer to his enemy. It was a
  pursuit carried out at first in silence, unbroken by roar of guns; a pursuit
  which was written in belching smoke that curled and trailed upon the dark
  green waters, and in the white fan of the flying warships' wake. Thirty miles
  had been covered by the racing ships, and the nearest British vessel was all
  but ten miles away when there came the first low rumbling thunder of the
  mighty British guns, and the shriek of a great shell. It struck the rearmost
  vessel, the <i>Blacker</i>, the slowest of the enemy fleet, and sent
  splinters of red-hot shell flying in all directions. It was followed
  instantly by another, and yet another; and then, as the British crept up hand
  over hand, the target was shifted from the rearmost ship, and <i>Lion</i>,
  leading the battle line, began dropping her shells upon <i>Moltke</i> and
  <i>Seydlitz</i>.</p>

  <p>Moving at tremendous rates so that the two foremost British ships,
  <i>Lion</i> and <i>Tiger</i>, were well clear of their fellows these two
  began a continuous fire from their forward batteries, until at last they drew
  within long range of <i>Derfflinger</i>, and brought the whole of the German
  battle fleet under fire. And the German clapped on speed in his flight for
  home and the shelter of his mine field.</p>

  <p>Back and forward went the quick exchange, <i>Tiger</i> engaging three
  ships at once, whilst the other ships of the line, <i>Princess Royal</i>,
  <i>Indomitable</i> and <i>New Zealand</i>, drew up to <i>Blücher</i>, which
  was now on fire fore and aft.</p>

  <p>On <i>Indomitable</i>, the last of the line, the excitement had been
  intense. Would the slowest of the battle cruisers get up in time to join the
  fight? The stokers off duty ("the black squad ") settled that point. They
  volunteered to go down and assist their brethren in the deeps of the
  stokehole, that <i>Indomitable</i> might not be last in the hunt.</p>

  <p>Stripped to the waist and tingling with joyful excitement they stoked
  <i>Indomitable</i> to such purpose that she pulled out four knots more than
  she had achieved upon her trials. And now the reward came. A signal to
  <i>Indomitable</i>, brief and to the point, <i>"Settle Blücher!"</i> brought
  this fine ship into action.</p>

  <p><i>Blücher</i> had heeled over and drawn out of the line, her fore turrets
  swept away, her bridge vanished, her steel tripod masts a mass of wreckage.
  With funnels battered and hanging limply, scarred and holed above and below
  water- line, she wallowed in the trough of the sea, still firing her guns
  desperately. Every British ship that passed her gave her one salvo, for she
  had been the craft which had begun the bombardment of Scarborough and the
  British gunners were saying "Remember Scarborough" as they fired. The end
  came when <i>Tiger</i> and <i>Indomitable</i> addressed themselves to the
  business of finishing <i>Blücher</i> for good.</p>

  <p>Whilst this was going on, the German ships were rapidly approaching the
  mined sea area which had been prepared for such a contingency, a field lying
  fifty miles to the west of Heligoland. Here mines were thickly sown, and only
  ships having a complete knowledge of their position could be safe here.</p>

  <p>It became evident to Sir David Beatty that he must break off action in a
  very short time, and he renewed his efforts to cripple the remainder of the
  German Fleet. Manoeuvring his ships so that he veiled them from the German
  gunners in the smoke which was pouring from the enemy's funnels, he drew
  closer, and the forward guns of <i>Lion</i> and <i>Tiger</i> thundered
  incessantly. The scene upon the battered German warships was indescribable.
  The shock and crash of exploding shells, which swept huge guns from their
  mountings as though they were toys, which destroyed men so that nothing was
  left of them, which made the very steel decks red-hot, drove some men
  mad.</p>

  <p><i>Derfflinger</i> was on fire forward, and flames were leaping up as high
  as the mainmast. Men from all the German ships were throwing themselves
  overboard, trusting to the hope of being rescued rather than to enduring that
  hell any longer. <i>Moltke</i> and <i>Seydlitz</i>, with fires blazing fore
  and aft, with the merciless shells dropping left and right, were in
  deplorable condition.</p>

  <p>Then <i>Lion</i> met bad luck. A lucky shot fired by <i>Seydlitz</i>
  struck one of the feed tanks of the flagship and caused her to reduce speed,
  and at the same time enemy submarines were sighted to starboard of her. The
  German ships had reached the outer ring of the mine defences&mdash;a defence
  which they had elongated by the process of dropping overboard a number of
  mines in their flight. On the edge of the minefield lay the submarines,
  waiting their chance to defend the battleships; and when Sir David Beatty,
  realising that he had reached the margin of safety, decided to break off the
  action, these came out to attack <i>Lion</i>. Steaming with one engine,
  <i>Lion</i> steered to the north-west, and Admiral Beatty transferred his
  flag to one of the destroyers, and subsequently to <i>Princess Royal</i>. The
  starboard engines of <i>Lion</i>now began to give trouble, and
  <i>Indomitable</i> took her in tow and brought her safely into port.</p>

  <p>Now on the fringe of the minefield, with the advent of the strong
  submarine flotilla that had come out from Heligoland, the British Fleet was
  in danger. The long line of British destroyers which had been racing in the
  wake of the battle cruisers came up, and quickly assumed a formation which
  put them into a circle, the centre of which was the battle cruisers. Round
  and round at top speed the destroyers raced, ever widening their circle and
  ever keeping at a distance the baffled submarines. The great speed of the
  torpedo boat destroyer as compared with the slow-moving submarine rendered
  any possibility of attack upon the battle cruisers futile.</p>

  <p>Other destroyers, standing by the place where <i>Blücher</i> had sunk,
  picked up as many of the exhausted men of that ship as they could, despite
  the operations of a German airship circling overhead, which, all the time,
  was attempting to drop bombs upon the rescuing destroyers.</p>

  <p>Many of the men who were saved were in the last stages of exhaustion. Some
  were suffering from most terrible injuries; others were mad.</p>

  <p>The captain of <i>Blacker</i> was taken on board one of the rescuing ships
  in a state of utter collapse.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* He subsequently died in hospital.</p>

  <p>In the morning these great cruisers of ours had trembled to the shock of
  explosions, and watchful men, in the dark, close confines of steel turrets,
  had worked their destructive guns. In the afternoon these same British
  sailors, relentless and remorseless, were searching their kits to provide
  clothing for the half-drowned, wholly chilled and utterly unnerved members of
  the enemy crews.</p>

  <p>It was learned from the rescued men that the German Navy had sustained
  another complete loss. The <i>Kolberg</i>, one of the light cruisers, acting
  on the flank of the bigger ships, had been struck by over-salvoes which had
  passed their objective&mdash;the battle cruisers&mdash;and had sunk the
  smaller vessel. The German prisoners were agreed that she went down&mdash;a
  fact which the German Admiralty eventually denied.</p>

  <p>It was a significant circumstance, which has been insufficiently commented
  upon, that the prisoners taken from the water consisted of representatives
  from all the ships of the flying German Fleet. In other words, the conditions
  had been so terrible upon the German warships which had escaped sinking, that
  men preferred death under the open sky and in the sea of icy water to a
  chance of life on these stricken ships.</p>

  <p>Thus ended the second attempt of the German to reach the British coast, an
  attempt as ignoble in conception as it was disastrous in result. Our losses
  were:<i>Lion</i>, 17 wounded; <i>Tiger</i>, one officer and nine men killed,
  three officers and eight men wounded; <i>Meteor</i>, four men killed and one
  man wounded. The enemy losses were two ships and about 800 men. It was
  necessary to tow <i>Lion</i> and <i>Meteor</i> out of the area, but nearer to
  port <i>Lion</i> had sufficiently recovered to be able to come into harbour
  under her own steam. The injuries to the ships themselves were
  unimportant.</p>

  <p>The battle was fought on Sunday, January 24, between the hours of 7.30 and
  3 o'clock.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. &mdash; THE NAVAL AIRMEN</h2>

  <p>The work of the British airmen&mdash;both naval and army
  branches&mdash;was consistently excellent throughout, and as time went on,
  the British flying man, capable, resourceful, and daring, acquired ascendancy
  over his German rival. It is more convenient to deal first with the exploits
  of the naval branch of our air service.</p>

  <p>Royal Naval airmen had accomplished a daring flight to Düsseldorf,
  destroying the Zeppelin shed there and with it one of the newest Zeppelins;
  and the success of that raid struck something like dismay into German hearts.
  The temper of the German people, which is represented in all the official
  accounts as steady and calm and most admirably confident, may best be gauged
  from the fact that it was necessary for the Military Commander at Cologne to
  issue special orders and injunctions to soothe the panic-stricken population,
  which for twenty years or more has been persistently told that, whatever
  might be the result of a war in which Germany was engaged, it was certain
  that the people of the interior towns would never hear the sound of a shot
  fired by an enemy.</p>

  <p>The Zeppelin threat was one which had been held over Great Britain, not so
  much, one imagines, to terrorise our people as to keep the German folk in
  good heart.</p>

  <p>The headquarters of the Zeppelin industry were at Friedrichshafen, on Lake
  Constance and it was known in the early days of November that two or three
  new Zeppelins were in course of manufacture at this place. Three British
  airmen decided upon the most daring raid that the war so far had produced.
  This was none other than an attempt to reach Friedrichsfaven from the French
  frontier and to destroy the Zeppelins in course of construction.</p>

  <p>Three well-known men in the Naval Air Service were chosen for the
  work&mdash; Squadron Commander Briggs, Flight-Commander Babington and
  Flight-Lieutenant Sippe. Squadron Commander Briggs was one of the best air
  pilots we have had, a man who had put up the British altitude record to
  15,000 feet.</p>

  <p>The attempt involved a considerable amount of preparation, a very careful
  study of maps, and a reconnaissance, as far as it was possible to make one,
  for the first hundred miles of the flight. The statement made by Germany that
  our airmen were aided by information improperly conveyed by our diplomatic
  representatives in Switzerland needs no confutation. We had fought always
  with clean hands, and we had never yet utilised the territory or the sympathy
  of neutrals in order to secure our ends. This is not a claim which can be
  repeated with any truth by our enemy.</p>

  <p>The attempt was made from Belfort, and early one grey morning, in the
  presence of the superior officers of the French garrison, who were the only
  people in the secret, the three gallant Britons began their flight. It was a
  flight without parallel in the history of this war, which has produced so
  many precedents. It carried the aviators over wild country, across high
  mountains, where every care had to be taken that the neutrality of
  Switzerland was not violated. For in these days nations claim the air as
  their territory just as assuredly as they claim the land below. The weather
  was intensely cold, and the gallant British airmen encountered, in one period
  of their flight, a very strong wind which caused them no little anxiety,
  threatening as it did the untimely termination of this adventure.</p>

  <p>One of the aviators lost his way in a bank of cloud just before the
  objective was reached, and emerged to see Commander Briggs, shot at by
  anti-aircraft guns and shelled in all directions, making a steep dive down to
  the air shed where the new Zeppelin was building. Then, and only then, when
  he was sure of his ground, did Commander Briggs drop his terrible bombs.
  There was a burst of flame and smoke, but, undeterred, the second airman came
  swooping down in that inferno and dropped other bombs to complete the attack.
  In wide circles the aviators came back to their elevation, the wings of their
  machines riddled by rifle and shrapnel shot. Briggs alone fell, but steadied
  his flight and landed with little or no injury. For a few moments he was
  surrounded by an angry crowd, but a pointed revolver kept them at a
  respectful distance, until, on the arrival of an officer with some soldiers,
  the gallant Commander surrendered. It is reported, and we can only hope that
  the story is unfounded, that when the German officer discovered that the
  revolver with which the airman had been threatening his men was unloaded, he
  lashed his prisoner across the face with a riding whip.</p>

  <p>The perils of his two companions were not at an end. If they had come
  unperceived, they were not to leave the country without risk. The news of
  their presence was telegraphed from town to town; motor-cars mounting machine
  guns and anti-aircraft cannon were dispatched at full speed to the most
  likely points; observers were specially detailed to watch the Swiss border
  and to note whether these adventurers crossed the frontier. But such was the
  extraordinary speed with which the airmen returned, that scarcely had the
  news of their arrival been received than the airmen themselves were over the
  place to which communication had been made and were out of sight before any
  effective step could be taken to intercept them.</p>

  <p>The two officers, Lieutenant Sippe and Lieutenant Babington, were flying
  within sight of one another and at such a height that when they did come
  within the sphere of German anti-aircraft guns they defied every effort of
  the enemy to bring them down.</p>

  <p>On the great barrack square of Belfort the French Commander waited
  anxiously as hours passed without news coming to him of the result of the
  raid. Situated as Belfort is, so close to the German frontier, it was
  impossible that the French should gain any news of the absent airmen from any
  distance, and the first intimation that the General and his Staff received
  was the sudden appearance in the air of two swooping aeroplanes which dived
  down on to the square and came to a halt within a few paces of where the
  Staff was waiting.</p>

  <p>For this service the three officers, including Commander Briggs, were
  awarded the Legion of Honour by the French Government.</p>

  <p>At Düsseldorf and Cologne it might reasonably have been supposed that the
  enemy was immune from attack, that they lay too far within their own borders
  to be subjected to the indignity of a bombardment at this stage of the war.
  Friedrichshafen, still farther away from the French frontier, never imagined
  that so outrageous a thing would happen as an attack upon its Zeppelin shed.
  But if there were two places which apparently were more secure than any other
  from attack either by land or sea, they were Wilhelmshaven and Cuxhaven.
  These, indeed, might be called the very sanctuary of Prussian naval life.</p>

  <p>With waters protected by minefields thickly sown, with batteries placed at
  every point which commanded the approach of the Elbe, with Zeppelin bases
  left and right, and the whole of the German Navy anchored within reach of the
  Kiel Canal, the defences were so strong it would need more than an ordinarily
  desperate adventurer to place his head in the lion's mouth.</p>

  <p>An air raid upon Cuxhaven was never seriously thought of by the German
  naval and military authorities, and no adequate provision was made to fight
  off such a raider. What was very clear to the German was that the nearest
  hostile land was separated by some 350 miles of water and that a raider would
  necessarily be compelled to make a 700 mile journey in the air. As it proved,
  such a journey was not necessary.</p>

  <p>On Christmas Eve, <i>Undaunted</i> and <i>Arethusa</i>, attended by a
  small flotilla of fast torpedo boat destroyers, moved out of one of our ports
  and made their way across the North Sea. Piled high on the decks of these
  little cruisers, the newest and some of the most efficient of Britain's
  ships, were seven water planes.</p>

  <p>There are certain of His Majesty's ships which are specially equipped for
  carrying water-planes ready for launching. One of these is <i>Hibernia</i>.
  Certainly neither <i>Undaunted</i> nor <i>Arethusa</i> were so equipped, and
  a strange sight they must have presented as they moved across the heaving
  waters with their strange cargoes. Their objective was a point not many miles
  south of Heligoland. It was no sudden raid against an undefended coast line,
  no hurried bombardment that this fleet had in view&mdash;a bombardment of a
  few minutes followed by a precipitous flight to safety&mdash;but a calm and
  leisured attack upon the very heart of the German naval service.</p>

  <p>That they were sighted almost instantly is evident.</p>

  <p>The Zeppelins on the island were first brought into action. They came
  looming from their great sheds, and rose upward, moving over the waters,
  already alive with submarine craft. The British captains knew their danger;
  they also knew the limitations of the enemy's submarines.</p>

  <p>They must remain at a distance which would enable them to operate without
  fear of being struck by the British shells. Even here they were in some
  danger if they so much as put their periscope above water. They had, however,
  torpedoes, and these they launched against the daring raiders. The fast
  ships, such as <i>Undaunted</i> and <i>Arethusa</i>, had little to fear from
  torpedo attacks, so long as they knew the quarter from which that attack
  would be launched. The torpedo in its course through the sea leaves a
  distinct track, and the turn of a wheel will enable a fast moving cruiser to
  sweep clear from its path. Even against aircraft the dirigibles were
  ineffective, for here their uselessness was also clearly demonstrated. Three
  shells from the <i>Undaunted</i> driven straight into the air and bursting in
  alarming proximity to one great gasbag, set it swirling about, and another
  three sent up from the <i>Arethusa</i> completed the rout. The enemy's
  aeroplanes managed to get somewhere over the cruisers&mdash;a position in
  which it was impossible to shell them&mdash;and dropped several bombs, none
  of which, however, found its mark.</p>

  <p>For three hours this extraordinary combat went on&mdash;a fight between a
  little sea-going fleet and the unseen peril which lurked in the ocean's
  depths, and the whirling terror which circled far above the cruisers.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the British airmen had gone straight to their objective,
  which was Cuxhaven. Rising to almost the maximum height, they were enabled
  not only to see the little town for which they were making, but also to gain
  a fairly clear view of the whole of the Kiel Canal and the Shilig roadstead,
  wherein a portion of the German Fleet lay at anchor. Instantly every gun in
  the vicinity was trained upon these seven specks, but without result.
  Spreading farther and farther apart, each man taking one particular section
  for reconnaissance, the airmen covered the ground allotted to them. Two
  detached themselves and flew direct for Cuxhaven, dropping bombs on their way
  upon the warships and making at least one hit.</p>

  <p>The pilots engaged in this raid were Flight-Commander Douglas Oliver,
  R.N., Flight-Commander Francis Hewlett, R.N., Flight-Commander Robert Ross,
  R.N., Flight-Commander Cecil Kilner, R.N., Flight-Commander Arnold Miley,
  R.N., Flight-Lieutenant Charles Edmonds, R.N., Flight-Sub-Lieutenant Vivian
  Gaskell Blackburn, R.N. Of these all but one succeeded in returning to the
  vicinity of <i>Undaunted</i> and <i>Arethusa</i> in the place where they had
  been left and whence they had driven back all hostile attacks.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. &mdash; TURKEY AND THE DARDANELLES</h2>

  <p>The German's object in scheming to include Turkey in the war is plainly to
  be seen. He hoped to produce a revolution in Egypt, and he had good reasons
  for his hope, for the Khedive had evidently been in his pay and had been
  acting in concert with the enemies of Britain. He hoped, by directing the
  Turk to an invasion of Egypt, to hold a portion of the British Army along the
  Suez Canal, and by an offensive towards the Caucasus to employ a considerable
  number of Russian troops to the relief of his sorely tried neighbour. More
  than this, he hoped that the deflection of one who termed himself "The
  Commander of the Faithful," would have the effect of stirring Mussulman
  opinion in India, and creating that condition of anarchy which it was the
  fond conviction of the great German General Staff would follow the Sultan's
  act.</p>

  <p>She possessed two old German battleships, one of which, after the
  declaration of war, was employed to guard the mine fields which the Turk had
  so plentifully sown in the Dardanelles.</p>

  <p>Though old, she had good fighting value, and Lieutenant Holbrook,
  commanding the submarine B11 (the Mediterranean Fleet was never far from the
  entrance of the Dardanelles) thought her of sufficient importance to venture
  on a most perilous undertaking. <i>Messudiyeh</i>, old as she was,
  represented the best part of Turkey's battleship fleet. This large ship was
  Lieutenant Holbrook's objective, but it could only be secured after a long
  voyage and by the safe negotiation of these deadly mine barriers. Nothing
  daunted, the little submarine started off on its extraordinary voyage.
  Sinking almost to the bed of the sea, it worked a cautious way forward
  against treacherous currents, and dodged no fewer than five rows of mines by
  diving under them. In this manner the B11 was able to come upon the
  unsuspecting <i>Messudiyeh</i> before the crew of the vessel were alive to
  their peril. Even as they recognised their danger, the torpedo was loosed to
  its deadly work, and in a flash of flame and a shock of explosion which set
  the submarine rolling like a row-boat in a storm, this ancient battleship
  went out. For this daring deed Lieutenant Holbrook was awarded the V.C. He
  succeeded in getting safely back, although assailed by gun- fire and torpedo
  boats, having been submerged on one occasion for as long a period as nine
  hours.</p>

  <p>The Dardanelles from the Mediterranean, to where its waters broaden out
  into the Sea of Marmora, is roughly forty miles in length, allowing for its
  tortuous windings; as the crow flies the distance might be reduced to about
  thirty miles. The Straits vary in width from nearly five miles to about
  three-quarters of a mile.</p>

  <p>The big enterprise of attempting to force the Dardanelles had been kept a
  great secret, and the first news came as a surprise to most people. It was to
  be a fight of big naval guns against land forts. There were many who held
  that the advantage lay with the latter. The stupendous nature of the
  undertaking may be realised by the fact that forty or more ships were
  employed to prosecute the work.</p>

  <p>If we in Great Britain were ignorant of what was going forward in that
  quarter of the globe, the people of the Levant talked of nothing else. It was
  there the most open of secrets that the Fleets were assembling for an attack
  upon the guarded passage which cuts the Turkish Empire from the rest of
  Europe. The sinking of <i>Scharnhorst</i>, <i>Gneisenau</i>, <i>Nürnberg</i>,
  and <i>Leipzig</i> by Admiral Sturdee's fleet had left the seas untroubled by
  the enemy, save for a couple of light cruisers and a converted liner, all of
  which were subsequently accounted for. To hunt these sufficient ships were
  detailed, but the battleships and battle cruisers were ordered back into the
  Mediterranean for a new adventure.</p>

  <p>An attempt had already been made in November, when a combined squadron of
  French and British ships had commenced a bombardment of the outer forts at a
  range of seven miles. This bombardment only lasted for a very short time. The
  fleets were taking sighting shots, and, whatever was the result of that
  preliminary bombardment, evidently there was encouragement to be found, as
  was to be proved three months later.</p>

  <p>Possibly it was with a sigh of relief that the Turk watched the small
  British and French squadron disappear over the horizon after their little
  bombardment on that occasion; he might reasonably suppose, as days passed
  into weeks and weeks into months without any return of his tormentor, that
  his enemy had accepted as gospel the traditions which hung about the
  impregnability of land fortifications. But the lapse of time was only being
  employed by the British and the French to make good their preparations. The
  laden supply ships came into Malta, fleets were carefully organised and the
  practice of crews was specially directed to the great task which all knew was
  ahead.</p>

  <p>The fruition of all these preparations was seen on February 19th, when the
  Allied fleet which had been assembled for the great task, appeared before the
  entrance of the Dardanelles, and, without any preliminary or further
  preparation, began a bombardment of the great forts which cover the entrance
  to the Straits. These, the one situated on the Gallipoli Peninsula and the
  other on the Asiatic side of the Straits, were respectively Seddul Bahr and
  Kum Kale. At eight o'clock in the morning the first ship opened fire, and
  throughout the day the bombardment was continued until three in the
  afternoon, when observers had noticed the destruction which had been wrought
  amongst the heavy guns. Then it was that the fleet closed in and, at
  remarkably short range, began to pour a rain of shell into the doomed forts.
  By evening one fort on the Asiatic side alone was firing; the remainder of
  the forts were silent.</p>

  <p>In these operations some of the ships engaged, under Vice-Admiral
  Sackville H. Carden, were <i>Vengeance</i>, <i>Cornwallis</i>,
  <i>Triumph</i>, <i>Suffren</i>, <i>Gaulois</i>, <i>Bouvet</i>,
  <i>Inflexible</i>, and <i>Agamemnon</i>.</p>

  <p>The entrance forts which, like their fellows, were armed with Krupp guns,
  represented indeed a serious obstacle to any attempt which might be made to
  force the Straits. Isolated forts, notably at Dardanus, half-way between the
  entrance and the Narrows on the Asiatic side, and Kephez Point, a little to
  the north of that town, with a number of earthworks at intervals on the
  Gallipoli Peninsula, rendered any attempt at hasty progression a very
  dangerous undertaking. Apart from the groups at the entrance, there was a
  very strong group at Chanak, which included the main Chanak battery, the
  Parkeh and Pehemenni batteries; whilst on the opposite shore at Kilid Bahr
  ("the gate of the sea") were other strong works.</p>

  <p>The immediate continuance of the bombardment was interrupted by the
  condition of bad weather. Mist, a low visibility, and a strong south-westerly
  gale rendered operations extremely difficult. On February 25 the bombardment
  was resumed, and all the forts at the entrance were successfully reduced.</p>

  <p>It was not until February 28 that the Admiralty made an important
  announcement. The condensed and laconic reports which had been issued from
  Naval Headquarters gave us an indication that besides the ships which had
  been mentioned there was one which possessed a much more powerful armament
  than the others. This was revealed as the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, our newest
  super- Dreadnought, armed with eight 15-inch guns. Never before had such a
  powerful warship come into action, and her arrival on the scene marked a new
  era, not only in the local operations, but in the history of naval
  warfare.</p>

  <p>It had been <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, <i>Agamemnon</i>, <i>Irresistible</i>,
  and <i>Gaulois</i> which had reduced the fort at Cape Helles at long range.
  As giving the lie to the Turkish assertion that the guns at the entrance were
  obsolete weapons, we have the fact that the fort at Cape Helles, replying to
  the fire at 11,000 yards, hit <i>Agamemnon</i>, killing three men and
  seriously wounding five.</p>

  <p>The mine-sweepers had therefore little to fear from the outer forts; but,
  leaving nothing to chance, the destroyers, supported by a battleship,
  followed slowly into the entrance of the Straits and covered the sweeping for
  a distance of four miles.</p>

  <p>Immediately following the reduction of the forts at the entrance, a large
  force of marines and sailors had been put ashore to clear away any straggling
  troops which might be found in that neighbourhood, and also to render what
  aid could be given to the Turkish wounded. A brisk little fight with a much
  stronger force than had been anticipated produced a few British casualties,
  but the marines established themselves at the edge of the battered forts and
  were for some time able to hold their own, though eventually they were
  obliged to withdraw.</p>

  <p>The importance of the first operations against the Dardanelles cannot be
  over- estimated. The bitterest criticism was levelled against those who
  undertook the task of attempting to force the Straits without the aid of an
  army to engage the rapidly increasing land forces of Turkey, but it is
  certain that with all its errors of judgment, the operations were justified
  and for a time it looked as though we should succeed by gunfire alone in
  reducing the guardian fortresses. Politically the attempt produced
  sensational results. It galvanised the neutral nations of the Balkans to life
  and alarm. It precipitated a crisis in Greece and created something like
  panic in Constantinople.</p>

  <p>Bulgaria's position, Roumania's position, and the very future of the
  Austro- Hungarian Empire depended upon the ability of Turkey to keep at bay
  the battering warships. And there was another reason for this bombardment,
  which was even more vital to the Allies than the question of the continuance
  of Bulgaria and Roumania's neutrality, and that was the very urgent need
  which existed for opening a way into Russia.</p>

  <p>Exactly what Great Britain was called upon to provide, in the shape of
  armaments and supplies for the Allied nations, we were not told at the
  moment; but it is certain that a free interchange, not only of trade in war
  materials but in commerce, was absolutely necessary. Russia's one port,
  Archangel, is from the end of November till the beginning of May icebound,
  and Russia must depend entirely upon the stock of ammunition, motor-cars,
  etc., which she stored up before the ice set, and which with the Dardanelles
  closed she had no hope of replenishing.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; THE LAND OPERATIONS</h2>

  <p>The high hopes we entertained of a successful offensive from the sea were
  doomed to remain unfulfilled. The German-Turkish defences included mobile
  shore batteries which played havoc with the mine-sweepers, whilst drift-mines
  destroyed two British and one French warship, the latter, <i>Bouvet</i>,
  going down with practically all her crew.</p>

  <p>It was after this tragedy that it was made abundantly clear to the British
  and the French Governments that a new plan of campaign must be adopted in the
  Dardanelles. The naval plan itself was excellent. It had silenced a large
  number of forts, but had actually reduced only a very few.</p>

  <p>For your Turkish gunner, flinching under the heavy hail of shell which the
  battleships concentrated upon the fortresses, would disappear to his
  bomb-proof shelter and wait until the storm passed over. And the guns of that
  fort would to all intents and purposes be "silenced."</p>

  <p>From a distance the naval gunners could not be certain that they had
  succeeded in their object, but could not afford to take the risk of believing
  that they had failed. The ammunition supply for big guns was not an unlimited
  one, and no captain would continue his bombardment of a fort which had ceased
  to reply. He might keep his eye upon that fort for the remainder of the day,
  and at the first sign of activity renew his attack. But if hour passed hour
  and no sign of life was seen, he must, for economy's sake, regard the
  silencing as being permanent.</p>

  <p>And the next morning, when the Fleet again returned to the Dardanelles to
  continue the work, he would be pardonably exasperated to discover himself
  under the direct fire of the guns which he imagined to be destroyed. Only by
  the landing of demolishing parties could the Naval authorities be absolutely
  certain that the power for mischief had been broken.</p>

  <p>Moreover, there was another source of embarrassment to the attacking
  fleet. Mine-sweepers, going forward to trawl the minefields, were subjected
  to heavy fire directed on them from unsuspected positions on both shores.
  Protecting battleships might reply; aviators might accurately locate the
  places where the guns were concealed&mdash;though this was a much more
  difficult task than many people imagined&mdash;and the offending battery
  might be put <i>hors de combat</i>, only to discover that another battery,
  which all this time had lain quiescent and unnoticed, opened as heavy a
  bombardment upon the trawlers the moment they pushed forward to their
  work.</p>

  <p>Obviously, therefore, the shore had to be cleared. A line of troops must
  slowly and thoroughly sweep the Peninsula, finishing the work which the naval
  guns had begun, destroying concealed torpedo stations, and making it
  impossible for the Turkish Army to hamper or embarrass the Allied Navy in its
  work. For this purpose, two armies of considerable size were organised on the
  north coast of Africa. The first of these was largely composed of Regular,
  Territorial, and British Colonial troops, and a very fine army, considerably
  strengthened by artillery from France and consisting of French Colonials and
  French first line soldiers, under the command of General d'Amade. The whole
  expedition was commanded by General Sir Ian Hamilton, an officer who had
  rendered excellent service in the South African war, and was at the outbreak
  of hostilities organising the Imperial forces overseas.</p>

  <p>During the months of February and March and the greater part of April, the
  preparations went on; plans were made, the naval and military authorities
  combining; fleets of transports came laden to certain of the Mediterranean
  stations; and whilst the warships continued their long-range bombardment of
  the Turkish forts, the Allies organised their efforts to seize and hold the
  Gallipoli Peninsula.</p>

  <p>That preparation coincided with an extraordinary effort on the part of the
  Turk. He did not intend to waste the time the partial inactivity of his enemy
  afforded him. Troops came down from Constantinople, the best fighting men
  were withdrawn from Syria; new field artillery and howitzer batteries were
  brought along to Gallipoli; and Turkish engineers, under German direction,
  began to make the most elaborate and thorough preparations to meet the
  threatened attack.</p>

  <p>The Gallipoli Peninsula is a tongue of land which runs south-westward and
  follows the rough shape which is peculiar to many such geographical
  formations which are washed by a westerly sea. (Of these, the best known are
  the "toe" of Italy and the County of Cornwall.) It is separated from the
  Asiatic shore by a stretch of water which for thirty miles is known as the
  Straits of Dardanelles, connecting the Aegean Sea with the Sea of Marmora.
  From the entrance of the Straits, at Seddul Bahr to Gallipoli, there is never
  more than a four-mile width of water between the Peninsula and the Asiatic
  shore, and at a certain point, some ten miles from Seddul Bahr, the Straits
  are pinched so that there is less than a mile between shore and shore. These
  are the famous Narrows, and are heavily protected by terraces of forts.</p>

  <p>The Peninsula itself is a somewhat confused and hilly country; the hills
  are not of any great eminence, 650 feet being the supreme height of the
  majority, though the range which dominates the westerly side of the Peninsula
  is considerably higher. Between these hills run a number of roads which are
  little more than sand tracks, and in the folds of the hills are to be found a
  few squalid and unimportant villages, mostly inhabited by an agricultural
  population. On the coast, and particularly facing the Straits there are a
  number of well-to-do communities and villages which might be dignified by the
  name of towns, and of these, Maidos, above the Narrows, Chanak, on the
  Narrows themselves, and Dardenos, further towards the sea, are the most
  important. Beyond Maidos is Gallipoli, which is the first of the big towns
  seen by the visitor to Constantinople who negotiates the Dardanelles.</p>

  <p>The beaches where any landing could take place were necessarily few in a
  country presenting the topographical features of the Peninsula. The Asiatic
  shore would have been a much simpler problem, but obviously the main advance
  must be toward the enemy's capital and toward the enemy's strength, and this
  would have to be on the European side.</p>

  <p>The Turk's preparations were very thorough, and on the hills commanding
  all the beaches he established, under German direction, strong and formidable
  defences. Guns were placed so cunningly that even the ubiquitous British
  airman might not be able to locate them. Nearer to the beach, in positions as
  commanding, batteries of machine-guns, Maxims and improved gatlings were
  placed to cover the various beaches, whilst the ruins of forts and villages
  which had been destroyed by shell-fire from the British ships were also set
  in order for defence.</p>

  <p>Von der Goltz, the German charged with the defence of the Dardanelles,
  made a rapid tour of the defences and found them good. "If the British land
  here," telegraphed one of his correspondents to a Berlin paper, "it will be
  wonderful. If, when they land, they force the Turkish defences, it will be a
  miracle. The British are beaten before they begin."</p>

  <p>The great difficulties of the task were not under-estimated by the
  commanders of the Allied forces. "This is not a question of 'If at first you
  don't succeed, try, try again'," wrote the official correspondent, "because
  unless enormous reinforcements can be spared from the Western theatre of war,
  Constantinople will have to be taken from the Black Sea by a Russian army
  landing in Thrace. We shall have to admit that we undertook a task that was
  beyond our powers with the forces available, and leave it to others, or only
  strike again when the Russians can cooperate at the Bosphorus. But, judged
  from any standpoint, the task involves enormous difficulties.</p>

  <p>"We have to land an army in the face of an enemy who has had ample warning
  that he may expect such an attempt. We have to put on shore food, water,
  guns, horses, munitions, ammunition, and all the thousand odd things
  necessary to keep an army in the field, besides making arrangements to remove
  a large number of wounded and sick. In this we are very largely dependent on
  the state of the weather, which, if it continues capricious, may leave one
  part of our army ashore, whilst the remainder and the supplies are held off
  the coast by a rough sea. Again, an army which has perforce been kept on
  transports for a long period cannot have the manoeuvring efficiency of an
  army which has been trained and handled by its generals on land. The command
  will also be a very difficult one to exercise, and will depend largely on the
  efficiency of the leaders of brigades, as when the Army is finally ashore at
  various points, widely separated, the Headquarters Staff will only be able to
  exercise a very general control.</p>

  <p>"I do not believe we can hope to surprise the Turks, led as they are by
  German officers, by the sudden arrival of this huge force off the shores of
  Gallipoli. We may effect a local night surprise, and that is all. You cannot
  keep the news of the assembly of a huge expedition such as this from leaking
  out in the East. The news of the concentration of this mass of warships and
  transports in Mudros Bay has undoubtedly found its way by a hundred different
  channels to Constantinople.</p>

  <p>"Neither can we overlook the fact that the enemy is fighting for his very
  existence, and will therefore bring every available man and gun into the
  field. The moment the first British ship is past the Narrows, the Turkish
  Empire in Europe has ceased to exist. No one knows this better than the Turks
  themselves. Had they their own way they would probably prefer to make an
  eleventh-hour peace rather than put this tremendous issue, affecting as it
  does their very existence as an independent nation, to the test.</p>

  <p>"But they know they have gone too far, and can only expect terms which
  would leave them very little better off than if they lose all by fighting.
  Therefore they must fight and stand or fall by the result. They are in a
  desperate position, and may be expected to fight like desperate men."</p>

  <p>On Saturday night, April 24th, the Turkish watchers in various posts of
  observation saw, steaming slowly across the sea, a fleet of a size greater
  than had ever been seen in these waters&mdash;crowds of torpedo craft, grey,
  formidable cruisers, and behind these, battleship after battleship in array.
  Then came the transports&mdash;liners of every conceivable size and shape,
  big passenger boats, colliers and smaller craft. "They lined the horizon,"
  said an observer, and he did not exaggerate. The transports lay at a
  considerable distance from the shore.</p>

  <p>In the dark of the night, with all lights extinguished, the big fleet
  began to creep in shore. All the previous Sunday the heavier guns of the
  fleet had been shelling the forts of the Straits and searching the known
  lines of Turkish entrenchments. "We found craters into which you could have
  put a house," said a naval officer, "but the Turkish trenches and their gun
  positions were so well made that it is doubtful if any great damage was done
  in the preliminary bombardment."</p>

  <p>The method of landing may be briefly described. In the early hours of the
  morning, certain of the warships, carrying large covering parties of troops,
  moved as closely in shore as possible, and sent off a number of boats, towed
  by a steam pinnace, toward the beach. Each line of boats will be referred to
  in this chapter as "a tow," and tows were taken not only by the small
  steam-boats of the fleet but by the destroyers, and in one case by a
  submarine. The task of the first landing force was to secure a foothold upon
  the beaches and cover the landing of the greater army when that foothold had
  been made good.</p>

  <p>First let us follow the fortunes of the Australians and New Zealanders,
  whose task it was to seize and hold the country about Gaba Tepe. This is a
  point half- way up the western coast of the Peninsula. The landing was
  carried out at dawn, under a heavy and enfilading fire. Here, as at other
  places, a strip of beach leads to an almost perpendicular "bluff," and the
  position has been best described, and will be best understood by those who
  know the place, as bearing a remarkable resemblance to the Leas at
  Folkestone. The abruptness of the bluff to a large extent saved the
  Australians and New Zealanders from greater punishment than they might
  otherwise have received. Under the shelter of the cliffs they were able to
  consolidate their position.</p>

  <p>Enfiladed left and right by gun fire, the whole beach swept by shrapnel,
  the Australians and New Zealanders began their ascent of the cliff, and did
  not waver. Left and right, seeking for whatever foothold they could, these
  gallant men from overseas progressed, with a steadiness under fire which
  merited the praise of all who witnessed the manoeuvre. Rallied at the edge of
  the cliff, they drove home a bayonet attack which swept the Turk from his
  advanced position, and such was their impetuosity that many of them
  penetrated farther inland than was desired, and suffered heavily in a
  counter-attack delivered by the Turk in full strength.</p>

  <p>A long ridge, terminating to the north in Coja Chemin, a mountain rising
  to nearly 1,000 feet was their objective. But their immediate business was to
  afford cover for the landing of bigger forces, to push out their front so
  that those who came after might be free from attack by rifle and machine gun;
  and this they did effectively. Though the enemy might drop a curtain of
  shrapnel between shore and transports&mdash;as he did&mdash;the new troops
  disembarked rapidly and in comparative immunity, and any fear that the
  landing would fail was dissipated.</p>

  <p>The ten-mile stretch of rocky foreshore to the west of the Gallipoli
  Peninsula presented an extraordinary sight upon this Sunday morning. The
  transports loomed through the mist, the raging, hammering battleships
  plastered the disputed cliffs and hills with shrapnel and high explosives,
  the rattle of musketry came from the shore as the khaki specks moved slowly
  forward and upward. On this ten-mile line the fight proceeded furiously.
  Sometimes, above the familiar detonation would come a deeper note. From
  somewhere behind the Peninsula a great shell would shriek, and pass generally
  to fall harmlessly between shore and battleship. There can be little doubt
  that this unknown ship, which fired at such a remarkable range, and which
  very often came dangerously near to hitting its mark, was the <i>Goeben</i>,
  whose arrival in Turkish waters had precipitated the war. Sometimes, and on
  various sectors of the coast, a new shell would explode against an enemy's
  position&mdash;a shell greater than any, spurting fountains of earth and
  stones. This indicated the presence and the watchful care of the <i>Queen
  Elizabeth</i>.</p>

  <p>Whilst the fighting was going on at Gaba Tepe, things were going forward
  elsewhere. The difficult business of landing was proceeding at the southern,
  end of the Peninsula. There were roughly five beaches chosen for landing the
  Expeditionary Force. The first two of these were to the north of Cape Tekeh,
  on the westerly side of the Peninsula. The third was immediately between Cape
  Tekeh and Cape Helles. The fourth was between Cape Helles and Seddul Bahr;
  and the fifth in Morto Bay.</p>

  <p>If you were to superimpose upon the map of the Peninsula a clock face,
  just as when one is endeavouring to train the young idea in shooting one
  imagines the target a clock and teaches him the hours at which he is to aim;
  and if, on this clock face, you make "eleven" represent the place of the
  northerly landing, ten as the next, eight as the next, between six and seven
  the fourth, and four o'clock the fifth, you have a rough idea as to the
  locality of the places which were chosen.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it will lead to a better understanding of what occurred if we
  follow the example of the official correspondent, and, taking beach by beach
  from left to right, recount the doings of that fateful April 25th.</p>

  <p>Those who know the Peninsula will know that the foreshore is of an
  extremely rocky character, broken here and thereby broad stretches of beach,
  behind which are either fairly even valleys, partly under cultivation, or
  else that tangle of little hills to which I have already made reference. On
  the northerly beach, that is to say, that which was nearest to the
  Australians and New Zealanders, H.M.S. <i>Dublin</i>, <i>Amethyst</i> and
  <i>Sapphire</i> covered the landing of two battalions and one company, and
  here the troops reached <i>terra firma</i> without encountering any very
  solid opposition. We will call this No. I landing, and it accounted itself
  fortunate, for it was very evident that both No. 2 and No. 3, farther down,
  and especially No. 3, were having a very bad time. Encouraged by the easiness
  of their success, the two battalions moved forward inland through a stiff and
  difficult country, and it seemed that the task, which had been so long and so
  persistently discussed and about which all sorts of speculations had been
  rife, was by no means as difficult as had been anticipated.</p>

  <p>Yet, as a matter of fact, the landing of No. 1 party was doomed to be the
  only landing which was a failure. Very soon the advancing infantry came in
  touch with the enemy.</p>

  <p>It must be remembered that, save for a few very light guns, the landing
  had been wholly unsupported by those arms which are successful to an advance
  of infantry. Before this little force there gathered regiment after regiment
  of Turkish infantry.</p>

  <p>Disputing every foot of the way, No. 1 force fell slowly back to the
  cliff, where it held on grimly through the night. Its commanders had
  discovered beyond doubt that progress in this region was impossible, and on
  the Monday morning, covered by the gun fire of the protecting cruisers, the
  force was re-embarked. Therefore, in respect to this party, the Turkish claim
  that they "had driven the English to the sea" was justified.</p>

  <p>Whilst they had been battling their way forward, No. 2 force, a mile or so
  to the south, had made the most successful landing of the day. The
  <i>Implacable</i>, which conveyed the troops, stood in to the shore, its
  quartermasters in the chains sounding the depth until she had reached six
  fathoms. Farther off, the <i>Swiftsure</i> engaged herself in a bombardment,
  which was supported by the <i>Implacable</i>. The great 12-inch guns of the
  battle cruiser swept the higher ground with shrapnel, whilst its smaller
  armaments kept up an incessant fire along the beach and beyond.</p>

  <p>Here again, the troops found a low cliff which, being scaled, revealed a
  plateau of practically level ground for two miles. The <i>Implacable</i> kept
  up her hammering at the furthermost Turkish defences, and the troops, moving
  rapidly to the shore, formed up and began their advance. Soon they were met
  with the inevitable fire at a thousand yards, and entrenched themselves.
  Later in the day they delivered a heavy counter-attack but were forced
  back.</p>

  <p>Farther south, No. 3 party was in difficulties, and though No. 2 extended
  its right, and to some extent rendered service to its less fortunate
  comrades, it was necessary for the second party again to entrench itself. The
  more necessary was this because from the Krithia plateau, to the northeast,
  the enemy brought his guns into action, one especially proving most
  troublesome until the busy <i>Implacable</i> turned its attention upon the
  attacker and, after a few shots, succeeded in finding the gun position.</p>

  <p>Part of the Turkish force which had driven off No. 1 was now sweeping
  forward in Echelon to No. 2, and this gallant little force fell back to the
  cliff, holding on grimly through the night. On the Monday morning the
  situation had developed farther south, and they were able to advance.</p>

  <p>No. 3 landing was between Tekeh and Helles, and here was a scene of
  terrible fighting and of casualties heavier than were sustained either in the
  Australians' landing, in the abortive landing of No. 1 party, or that more
  successful effort which was made by No. 2 on its right. The beach chosen was
  that across which the Turk had believed the main effort of his enemy would be
  made. To the left Cape Tekeh rose, 30 metres high; to the right Cape Helles;
  and in the centre the broad beach, defended by triple lines of barbed-wire
  entrenchments, by trenches cleverly concealed, and by a whole host of snipers
  who, from the cover which the rough country afforded, were able to pick off
  the men as they came to land. There were eight "tows." Four of these moved
  toward Cape Helles and gained the cover of the cliff; two toward Cape Tekeh,
  and two made for the gentle landing which the beach afforded.</p>

  <p><i>Euryalus</i>, which had made the tows, kept up a furious fire upon the
  enemy's position, but in the centre, covering this beach, the Turk was so
  well placed and so widely spread that it was impossible for the ship to offer
  any assistance. Long before the two tows reached the shore, bullets were
  falling thickly in the crowded boats, or splashing in the water about.</p>

  <p>Machine-gun and pom-pom sent a whizzing hail of death to the invaders, and
  under that withering fire nothing could live. Every man of the ill-fated
  party which attempted to make the landing on the beach was stricken down.</p>

  <p>The larger force to the right, which gained the shelter of Cape Helles,
  was more successful. Covered to an extent by the cliff and by the trenches
  which they hastily constructed, the men endeavoured desperately to retrieve
  the fortunes of the centre; but they were firing at an unseen enemy, as well
  protected from rifles as he was from guns. There was nothing to do for this
  unit of the 29th Division but to begin an ascent of the cliff and endeavour
  to work round the enemy in the centre. Simultaneously, the men from the
  remaining tows scrambled up the cliff, and hung on with "tooth and claw"
  through the morning, raked by shrapnel, a target for innumerable snipers, and
  bearing unflinchingly the concentrated fire of masked machine-gun
  batteries.</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock in the morning (Sunday, the 24th), another battalion was
  landed at No. 3, and moved to the left to get in touch with No. 2; but all
  thought of offensive was checked at nightfall, and the full power of British
  endurance was tested to resist a terrible assault which was delivered by an
  enemy outnumbering the British six to one. For a moment the battle line
  swayed dangerously. Men fought in the darkness with bayonets and with
  entrenching tools. Trenches were carried by sheer weight of numbers, and
  regained by the indomitable courage of the defenders. Lit by star shells and
  the momentary flash of bursting shrapnel, the scene was terrible to
  contemplate. Line after line of red-fezzed Turks, marching shoulder to
  shoulder according to the best German military tradition, came charging
  forward against the scanty single line of trenches which the British
  held.</p>

  <p>On the beach below&mdash;the battle occurred on the higher
  ground&mdash;were beach parties who were bringing ashore munitions and
  provisions for the army. They consisted of men of the Navy, Engineers and
  staff officers, and when the fight was at its most critical point the order
  came for the beach parties to seize their rifles, come up to the firing line
  and assist as best they could to reject the cumulative push of the Turk to
  dislodge the gallant regiments from their foothold. In the darkness some of
  the beach parties were unable to find their rifles, but, seizing whatever
  weapon was nearest&mdash;an axe, a spade or a pick handle&mdash;they
  scrambled up the hill and joined their comrades in the trenches.</p>

  <p>All the deeds of heroism which were performed that night will never be
  known. One midshipman who had charged himself with the duty of keeping a
  certain section of the trench supplied with ammunition, came toiling
  painfully up the hill with a dozen bandoliers of ammunition hung about him.
  He was struck full in the chest and knocked over by a bullet, but rose again
  and continued his journey. Again he was struck and again he fell, and rose.
  Yet a third time did an enemy bullet find him. Nevertheless, he delivered his
  supply of ammunition to the trenches, each bullet having been struck against
  and been diverted by one of the cartridges in a bandolier.</p>

  <p>Throughout the night the fight raged, and the morning sun saw our men,
  weary- eyed but triumphant, holding the trench from which the legions of
  Turkey had failed to drive them. Whilst the landing was going on under these
  terrible conditions, No. 4 party were engaged in what was the most novel and
  at the same time one of the most punishing operations which the landing saw.
  No. 4 undoubtedly suffered more casualties than any other force, and had to
  meet with an opposition even greater than that which faced No. 3. No. 3, it
  will be remembered, was landed between Cape Tekeh and Cape Helles. No. 4's
  landing place was between Cape Helles and Seddul Bahr. To the right was the
  ruined fortress which had borne this name, and which had been first of all
  silenced by the guns of the fleet, and afterwards demolished by landing
  parties. Nevertheless the wreckage offered splendid cover for infantry. The
  town of Seddul Bahr was a ruin, yet its walls, its rubble heaps, and the
  towers of the forts which still stood made excellent cover for an enemy who,
  it must be admitted, braving all the dangers which bombardment threatened,
  manned the towers with their machine-guns, and threw out trenches near to the
  beach to oppose the landing.</p>

  <p>Topographically, the situation was rather similar to that which had met
  No. 3 party. There was the same broad stretch of beach, the same flanking
  hills, the same broken country beyond, and in addition the excellent cover
  which Seddul Bahr itself afforded.</p>

  <p>Sir Ian Hamilton had realised that the fight here would be the fiercest
  and the approach to the beach the most dangerous.</p>

  <p>He had provided a liner, the <i>River Clyde</i>, and she had been made
  ready for the purpose to which she was eventually put.</p>

  <p>Great exits had been cut in her sides and over her bows*; her bridge had
  been covered with steel plates, and here twelve Maxim guns, well shielded,
  had been installed. From the gangways cut in her side planks had been
  suspended, and it was the intention to run the ship aground upon the shelving
  beach, drop over the gangways, and allow the soldiers who were confined in
  the shelter of her steel sides to rush the beach and its defences.</p>

  <p>Behind the beach, and filling up the gap between Cape Helles and Seddul
  Bahr, was a hill which is known as 141, heavily entrenched and protected by
  barbed- wire entanglements. As the ship approached the shore and her
  intentions became obvious, a fire not only from Cape Helles to the left, from
  the fortifications on the right, but from the almost impregnable position
  ahead, was opened upon the <i>River Clyde</i>.</p>

  <p>The transport was preceded by eight tows, but the <i>River Clyde</i> must
  have overtaken these as they grounded simultaneously. The object of the tows
  was to gain the cover of the rising ground and such shelter as the cliffs to
  left and right of the position afforded. The <i>River Clyde</i> was to
  provide a large force&mdash; some 2,000 men in all&mdash;to carry the enemy
  positions by a frontal attack and to make good the ground for further
  landings. The task set this force, when contemplated in cold blood, seems
  impossible.</p>

  <p>Not only were they enfiladed from positions strongly fortified, not only
  was the sand full of pitfalls and covered thickly by barbed-wire, from behind
  which the entrenched snipers could pick off the landing party at their
  leisure; but there was in the rear the impregnable position of Hill 141.</p>

  <p>There can have been no more extraordinary sight in the war than that which
  was presented by the <i>River Clyde</i>, as, going full speed ahead, her huge
  bows casting the shallow waters aside in two waves, she headed straight for
  the land. Her bridge was aflame with Maxim fire. Wherever a machine-gun could
  be placed, it was so placed. Yet, although she carried two battalions aboard,
  "packed like sardines" there was no sign of any human being at whom the enemy
  might direct their aim.</p>

  <p>Pom-pom shells and Maxim bullets rattled on the steel shell of the ship
  like the beats of a kettledrum. Only the protection which her steel skin gave
  to them prevented her occupants from being wiped out. Presently her keel
  caught the bottom, and she heaved up and came to a standstill, her screws
  still revolving furiously. She was still too far off the shore to enable her
  to get her troops landed. This contingency had been provided for. A hopper
  which had followed directly in her wake came alongside and drove ahead.</p>

  <p>A lighter was hauled round and the gangway lowered. Volunteers were called
  for to make the first landing, and although they knew they were going to
  certain death, the two hundred nearest the gangway clamoured for
  permission.</p>

  <p>The shots were falling like tropical rain as that intrepid two hundred
  flew across the gangway plank, sprang over the uneven decks of the lighter
  and dropped on to the sand. Some were shot almost before they had left the
  ship's protection; others were swept from the gangway; some reached the
  lighter; and a very few&mdash;and those desperately wounded&mdash;managed to
  reach the shore and to crawl under the protection of a high bank of sand near
  the water's edge.</p>

  <p>The attempt had failed. It was madness to send other men the same way, and
  the officer commanding the troops ordered the "stand-fast." Within the cover
  of the ship they were safe, and although, we may be sure, they grumbled at
  the reaction, the men settled down with admirable philosophy to what proved a
  day- long wait.</p>

  <p>This failure had been signalled back to the fleet, and the battleships
  <i>Cornwallis</i>, <i>Albion</i>, and <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> opened a furious
  bombardment upon the enemy's position, a bombardment with secondary armaments
  and with 12 and 15- inch guns, which did not cease for hours on end. The
  position was an extraordinarily exposed one, and the Turks were not slow to
  realise how excellent a mark the stranded ship might be. The word was
  telegraphed across to the Turkish gun positions on the Asiatic shore, and
  howitzers immediately opened fire upon the stranded vessel. Quick as this
  happened, every ship in sight turned its attention upon this luckless
  howitzer battery. Four times the <i>River Clyde</i> was struck by shells,
  without, however, any great damage being occasioned; and then the crescendo
  of fire from the vengeful warships turned the enemy howitzer to scrap iron,
  and no more danger was experienced from that quarter.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon the men of No. 3, who had effected a landing, moved to
  the right, and probably got in touch with those of No. 4 who had secured a
  foothold at Cape Helles. Displaying the greatest gallantry, this little party
  carried one of the enemy's trenches at the point of the bayonet, but this did
  not affect the general position so far as the cramped men on the <i>River
  Clyde</i> were concerned.</p>

  <p>Then darkness fell, and at eight o'clock, when the enemy's fire had first
  slackened and then died away, the commander of the <i>River Clyde</i> decided
  to effect his landing. With extraordinary expedition the men got ashore
  without sustaining a single casualty.</p>

  <p>This was the great surprise of the day.</p>

  <p>The opposition had been so strenuous, and the determination of the Turk to
  prevent a landing in force here so apparent, that No. 4 might expect that the
  worst of the work lay ahead of them. So far as the landing was concerned,
  however, that worst did not materialise, and the party was able to entrench
  itself and prepare for the inevitable counter-attack before that
  counter-attack was launched.</p>

  <p>The mystery of that lull, which enabled the British to make good their
  landing and to organise a defence, has not been explained. It was the one bad
  blunder which the Turk and the German committed. They seemed to come to a
  realisation of their folly at eleven o'clock, and an assault in force was
  delivered against the British positions, hand-to-hand fighting occurring all
  along the line. This attack was beaten off, but was followed by one even more
  serious, preparation being made for its delivery by a sustained and searching
  bombardment. The attack faded away toward the morning, but when dawn came and
  the little force was pushed forward, there was evidence that the enemy's
  resistance in this quarter was by no means finished.</p>

  <p>Seddul Bahr was, as I have said, a mere jumble of mortar and bricks, of
  wrecked masonry, of shapeless masses of concrete and rusting guns. The pretty
  little town which lay beneath the fortress had long since been reduced to
  desolation by the guns of the fleet, and all that was left of forts and town
  consisted of a labyrinth of foundation walls, garden edges and rubble heaps.
  Unlovely a substitute as they made for the once picturesque village, they had
  a very definite military value, as we were to discover. Behind the open
  cellars and vaults, behind the brickwork and the scrambled masonry, was a
  veritable network of trenches, connecting up with Hill 141 on the front of
  the British position. Certain portions of the fort itself still stood, and
  had been well utilised by an ingenious enemy.</p>

  <p>From one tower alone a dozen Maxims covered the British right; whilst from
  every stack of bricks, from every wall, and from such of the houses as had
  escaped demolition, came such a fire that the troops, seasoned as they had
  been in that short but grim battle of the night, flinched before it. It was
  only a momentary hesitation, and then the line poured forward into the first
  defences, bayoneted their occupants and crouched to the cover which their new
  ground afforded them.</p>

  <p>The machine-guns in the tower were more than an ordinary handicap. It was
  obvious that no advance could be made until they were destroyed; and here
  again I would point out that these extraordinary accomplishments on the
  Gallipoli Peninsula were all carried out without the aid of field artillery
  and by comparatively small parties of men.</p>

  <p>Back went the signal to the watchful warships laying off the Straits, and
  even as the machine-guns in the tower were rattling, the tower itself seemed
  to leap in the air in a cloud of smoke and flame, as two high explosive
  12-inch shells struck it at one and the same time. It was the
  <i>Cornwallis</i> that was charged with the protection of the British right
  in this field, and excellently did she play her part. But now other ships
  were coming into action. The village had been won, the enemy driven from his
  walls and his emplacements, and Hill 141, with its immense entanglements, its
  earthen fortifications and its successive trench lines, invited the attention
  of the attacker.</p>

  <p>By this time the men of No. 4 had been considerably reinforced, and before
  the attack began, <i>Cornwallis</i>, <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> and
  <i>Albion</i>opened a heavy fire upon the hills, searching crest and trench
  line and flinging their shrapnel against the protecting entanglements. At
  eleven o'clock on Monday morning, April 26th, the fourth force began its
  advance, and at 12 o'clock, after an hour of the fiercest fighting, where
  neither side gave nor asked for much quarter, the position was in their
  hands.</p>

  <p>The fifth party had landed between Morto Bay and De Totts battery. This
  force consisted of 700 men, who were landed in trawlers, and though the
  fighting at this point was well contested, their adventures and the
  opposition which met them could not be compared with those which the third
  and the fourth had found.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the French had landed at Kum Kale, on the Asiatic shore,
  and created a diversion, attracting to their front a much larger force than
  it was necessary the enemy should send. When their task had been accomplished
  they were re-embarked and brought across the mouth of the Straits and landed
  in the rear of the 700.</p>

  <p>Summing up the position as the Commander-in-Chief found it on Monday
  morning, the 26th, the Australians and New Zealanders were holding firmly to
  the position they had established for themselves on the Sunday evening and
  during Sunday night. They had sustained heavy losses, a party having been cut
  off by the enemy, but they were holding a fairly unassailable post. Farther
  south, the British party No. 1, which had landed without opposition, had been
  driven back to the shore and been forced to re-embark. No. 2 was not only
  holding its position on the edge of the sea but was advancing. No. 3 had
  beaten off the main Turco-German attack, and now, considerably reinforced,
  was moving forward slowly but effectively. No. 4 had carried Seddul Bahr and
  Hill 141, and had pushed its line northward, joining up with No. 3 on its
  left and No. 5, which consisted of French and British troops, on its
  right.</p>

  <p>It needed but a little further push to bring an intact British line right
  across the end of the Peninsula. On the night of the 26th there were few
  serious engagements, the exchanges being between snipers on the Australian
  front. The enemy had had such a hammering in this region that he could not
  immediately launch any further assault. Field guns had been landed, mounted
  batteries brought up to the front line, and many of the disadvantages under
  which the troops were suffering originally had been removed.</p>

  <p>It was not only the actual work in the battle line that secured us our
  success. Behind the firing line and on the beaches the men of the Navy with
  their comrades of the Army were working day and night to land stores, water,
  munitions, guns, and horses for the guns, mules, ambulances. "Looking at the
  beach with its extraordinary litter of stores and material, it seemed as
  though there had been a great shipwreck and the equipment of a whole army
  washed up." On the beaches, too, temporary stores were being erected,
  bombproof shelters dug and roofed, depots established, and the despatch of
  supplies to the front line systematised.</p>

  <p>The Navy had indeed accomplished tremendous work throughout the
  operations. A good idea of the diversity of the Navy's tasks in the
  Dardanelles was given us in the semi-official despatch.</p>

  <p>"The whole of the responsibility for landing troops and keeping up the
  supplies of food and ammunition is in the Navy's hands, and in addition the
  responsibility of protecting the flanks of the combined armies and in keeping
  down the enemy's artillery fire lies with the warships. All troops, animals,
  guns, wagons, stores, ammunition, and a thousand other things have to be
  taken from the hundred transports lying off the Straits, which arrive full
  and leave empty for a fresh cargo at all hours of the day and night, and
  conveyed in trawlers or lighters to two narrow beaches, neither of which is
  more than 200 yards in width. The cliffs prohibit landing anything at any
  other point.</p>

  <p>"Our naval commanders, lieutenants, and midshipmen in charge of this work
  have developed an efficiency which has astounded even the most tape-ridden
  theorists on how such matters should be carried through smoothly and with a
  minimum of delay. Piers have been built out into deep water by our sappers so
  that the largest lighters can come alongside. They have cut roads along the
  cliffs to increase the area of disembarkation, and a hundred devices have
  been introduced to lessen labour and increase efficiency, including systems
  of lighting which enable the work to go on uninterruptedly night and day. For
  it never stops, and even when the day's work is over and the last lighter has
  discharged her cargo, the streams of wounded are walking or being carried
  down to the beaches, where they are embarked on the empty barges and
  despatched for transportation to Egypt, to the hospital ships and
  transports.</p>

  <p>"They keep watches on shore just as they do at sea, and their devotion to
  duty and keenness is just as marked as when facing the enemy's batteries in
  the Dardanelles. The line of demarcation between the authority of the Army
  and the Navy is strictly drawn. As long as a soldier, a horse, a gun, or a
  biscuit is on a ship, or on a lighter on its way to the shore, all are under
  the control of our beach parties.</p>

  <p>"You see standing on one of the piers in the sweltering heat of the last
  few days, with the beach behind him crammed with men, stores, and animals,
  one of our young Kitcheners, with a megaphone in his hand, shouting orders to
  a dozen different lighters, each towed by a steam pinnace in the offing. One
  contains mules, another guns, a third biscuits, a fourth tinned meat, a fifth
  ammunition, a sixth troops, a seventh Generals and Staff officers. Every one
  is directed to its right destination as if by some enchanter's wand, and no
  one dare step ashore until he has received his orders. At the end of the pier
  the naval authority ceases, and that of the Army begins.</p>

  <p>"Here are Army Service Corps officers whose efficiency has become a
  by-word. All the hungry soldiers of our Allies or enemies are waiting to
  seize what the Navy has given them, and the thousand miscellaneous articles
  which look as if they never could be sorted are speedily divided, checked,
  and sent on their way down the lines of communication to the troops in the
  front trenches. The whole is a marvel of organisation. How it is managed will
  ever remain a mystery to me, but certainly such a task has never been
  attempted by an army and navy before. Neither let it be supposed that the
  work is carried out in peace and quiet. Far from it. The Turks on the Asiatic
  shore shell the beach almost every day.</p>

  <p>"Our warships are continually engaged in trying to locate their guns and
  knock them out, or force them to change their positions. There is one gun,
  known as the 'Jewel of Asia,' which continually drops shells, but with a
  minimum of result. You hear the shriek of its arrival, then the explosion,
  followed by a cloud of sand out of which emerge figures of men and animals
  who should have been killed or injured, but who very seldom are."</p>

  <p>By the night of the 27th, the Tuesday, after repulsing a Turkish attack
  which was delivered against the section of the line held by No. 2 party, the
  Allied force had established itself in an entrenched line running to a point
  about two miles to the north of Cape Tekeh, to a small plateau about De Totts
  battery, which had been occupied on the previous day by No. 5 party, at Eski
  Hissarlik, north of Morto Bay.</p>

  <p>From April 28th until May 2nd there was a brief lull in the operations,
  but on the night of May 2nd a violent attempt by the enemy was made all along
  the line. It began at eight o'clock in the evening with a heavy and sustained
  bombardment, which did very little damage, though the range was excellent. To
  this we were now able to reply in kind. British field gun and French 75 gave
  shot for shot, whilst the howitzer batteries, which had been landed and
  brought up to the rear of the battle front with considerable difficulty,
  rendered valuable assistance. Immediately following the bombardment an
  assault in force was attempted, and division after division of Turkish
  infantry moved forward in dense formation to the task of breaking the British
  line. Our position was still parlous, for the superiority of force was with
  the enemy. A breach of the line, or anything which partook of the nature of
  defeat, could not fail to be disastrous.</p>

  <p>Once let the Allies be beaten, and there could be no possible hope of
  retrievement. Behind them was the sea, and, powerful as were the guns of the
  Fleet, they could not possibly hope to save a broken army. As it happened,
  the attack ended disastrously for the enemy. Hundreds of machine-guns played
  upon the closely packed ranks, and the enemy was mown down by battalions.
  Giant searchlights, operated by men of the Navy, threw the reserves into
  prominence, and the 75-millimetre guns of the French artillery shattered and
  annihilated them. Following the destruction of these reserves the French
  infantry came into action and got in at close quarters with the bayonet, and
  the enemy retired, leaving his dead in heaps upon the ground.</p>

  <p>The landing had been effected on April 26th, and a week of warfare had
  seen its line consolidated. Though the advance was no very great one, when
  reckoned by mileage, the achievement will stand for all time as one of the
  greatest military successes which the world has seen. The difficulties of the
  task were enormous, and even though the landing had been secured, it had been
  at a heavy cost.</p>

  <p>Before the entrenched line of the Allies were hills as strongly held and
  as completely guarded as any of those which they had taken. The Turkish Army
  had been reinforced from half-a-dozen different sources. Syria and Palestine
  had sent troops, originally intended for the invasion of Egypt; the garrisons
  at Adrianople had been denuded, and the Turks had even taken the hazardous
  step of withdrawing their garrisons from the frontiers of Greece, and this
  step was only arrested when the Greek Government of a sudden recalled M.
  Venizelos, the former Prime Minister, to confer with the Cabinet of
  Greece.</p>

  <p>Before the troops that had effected their landing with such wonderful
  gallantry and at such heavy cost there now lay the height of Achi Baba to bar
  the progress of the Allies, and to possess the height, fortified with
  exceeding strength and cunning, was of necessity the next step in our deadly
  grapple with the Turk.</p>

  <p>On May 6th new French and British regiments arrived on the scene, and the
  line which was holding the Turk in check was thickened. New and heavy
  artillery was landed, and both the French and our own Royal Field Artillery
  brought much needed reinforcements to support the Allied line.</p>

  <p>All the beaches were now crowded with stores; wooden buildings had sprung
  up as if by magic, for the handy man had been busy night and day establishing
  base depots. A plentiful supply of water had also been secured, and all the
  preliminary disadvantages under which our troops had laboured had
  disappeared. The shore parties still found trouble from the long range
  bombardment to which they were from time to time subjected, and landing held
  its spice of excitement from this cause.</p>

  <p>With the augmented forces General Sir Ian Hamilton began his serious
  attempt to reach the heights of Achi Baba. Between him and his objective were
  the spurs of that mountain stretching southward to the Gulf of Saros, and
  southward to the shores of the Straits. The enemy occupied the slopes of
  these spurs&mdash;slopes which were covered by dense scrub, which concealed
  from our fire innumerable parties of snipers, who had been well placed, and
  in some places had been provisioned for a month. The uneven character of the
  ground rendered our task the more difficult, deep gullies allowing not only
  of easy defence, but of the free movement of troops, and these had to be
  carried by the bayonet.</p>

  <p>With the sniper our method was more elementary. He had to be hunted out,
  man by man, and for this purpose the Indian troops were employed. Wriggling
  forward foot by foot, the stalker, having located his prey, grew nearer and
  nearer to the doomed man; then, before he could realise his danger, a lithe,
  brown shape would leap from the underbrush, knife in hand, and the struggle
  would be sharp and short.</p>

  <p>The British were on the left and the French on the right of the line in
  the attack, which was delivered through the village of Krithia toward Achi
  Baba. The front was a confined one, limited to the littoral on either side of
  the Peninsula. Warships posted in the Gulf and in the Straits opened the
  engagement by directing a heavy and searching fire along the entrenched
  slopes of the spur. It was a remarkable sight; the whole of the hill seemed
  to be in flame as 12- and 6-inch shell burst continuously above the Turks'
  position. The eighty-seventh British brigade held the deep gully to the left
  and the trenches on the hills beyond, whilst on their right was the
  eighty-eighth brigade. The Naval Division were across the Krithia road and to
  the right of that road. The line was continued by the French, Senegalese in
  the centre, a French infantry division on their right, and the reserves were
  the Indian Brigade, the Australians and New Zealanders, the Territorial
  Division that had just arrived on the Peninsula, the Zouaves, and the Foreign
  Legion. Krithia itself stands on a ridge, and the immediate objective of the
  British was to capture this town, which would very largely and very
  materially assist in the domination of Achi Baba. The fight was opened by the
  French 75's, which maintained a fierce bombardment of the country on their
  immediate front and of the trenches which the Turks were occupying to the
  right of the Krithia road. It was such a thorough bombardment as was
  generally seen at the beginning of the war, searching every yard of the
  ground, whilst the battleships in the Dardanelles as effectively raked the
  upper slopes of Achi Baba.</p>

  <p>For thirty minutes this bombardment was kept up, and then the Senegalese
  swept out of their trenches and raced forward in open order up the right
  slope of the mountain. The extraordinary accuracy of the French gunfire was
  never better exemplified than in that charge, for as the Senegalese ran so
  did the "seventy- fives" drop a curtain of shrapnel fifty yards ahead of
  them, and between them and their enemy. They gained the crest of the rise,
  but here they had need to dig themselves in, for on the far slope they were
  held up by the Turkish entrenchments. The Royal Naval Division, which had
  spent the winter of 1914 in training at the Crystal Palace, came into action
  next, advancing across the broken ground under a heavy fire. They were not
  held up until they struck the entanglements of the Turks' trenches. It was,
  however, a serious hold-up, and immediately the ships were signalled as to
  its cause. Instantly the whole fleet in the vicinity turned its guns upon the
  patch of scrub in which the Turk was concealed. Nothing, however, silenced
  the Turkish fire, and the advance was stopped for that day. The following
  morning, after a heavy bombardment of the Turkish position, the
  eighty-seventh and eighty-eighth brigades pressed forward, but came under a
  particularly violent fusillade from the concealed German trenches.
  Notwithstanding this, our infantry moved forward, carried a line of the
  enemy's trenches and occupied them. It was not till three in the afternoon
  that the French again moved. The intervening time had been marked by heavy
  exchanges of artillery fire, the Turks being particularly energetic in their
  attack upon our reserves. The Turks were now apparently bringing every gun
  they possessed into action against our Ally, and the French batteries replied
  in kind.</p>

  <p>Under cover of the French fire their infantry moved forward only to be
  driven back, and for a time the situation was critical. The Foreign Legion,
  which had been in reserve, was now brought forward to the front line. The
  bombardment by combined ships and the full strength of the Allies' artillery
  was resumed, and at six o'clock in the evening the British went forward,
  gained yet another stretch of ground, and in the gathering darkness dug
  themselves in. The next morning was to see a renewal of the advance of an
  even more violent character than either of the previous days. It opened, as
  usual, by a tremendous bombardment of the right spur of Achi Baba by the
  heavy guns. For thirty minutes this inferno of flame and splintering shell
  was poured upon the Turks' position before our infantry again advanced, and
  again were met by withering fire from rifle, field gun and machine gun. The
  eighty-seventh and eighty- eighth did not waver, but went straight at the
  trench before them, and carried the whole line with splendid dash.</p>

  <p>Soon afterwards the New Zealanders, who had been in reserve, moved up to
  take their place in the final assault, whilst the Australian brigade, which
  had relieved the Naval Brigade for the same purpose, came into the front line
  in the centre. For four hours in the afternoon of May 8th it seemed as if a
  temporary truce had been proclaimed, for there was no evidence of life on
  either side, save the monotonous crack of the sniper's rifle; but at five
  o'clock such a bombardment was opened upon the Turkish line as had not been
  known in the history of war.</p>

  <p>Every ship that could be spared for the purpose closed in to the shore,
  and heavy armament, no less than secondary armament, was requisitioned for
  this, the most terrible artillery assault. Both arms of Achi Baba were
  subjected to this rain of fire. 15-inch and 12-inch shells charged with
  lyddite splattered the face of the hill scarlet and yellow.</p>

  <p>"They were spraying Achi Baba as you spray a flower-bed with water. Not a
  single inch seemed to escape this systematic search. Every gunner in every
  ship had been allotted a certain section of ground to cover, and it was
  impossible to see the hill for bursting flame."</p>

  <p>To the second the bombardment ceased, and again the infantry, which had
  been lying concealed in the shrub or in the cover of their trenches, moved
  forward to one grand assault.</p>

  <p>"No sooner had our men emerged from cover than a perfect storm of rifle
  and machine gun fire was opened upon them from the trenches and shrub over
  which the shells had burst and were still bursting," wrote the official
  correspondent. "The rifle fire rose fast into one continuous roar, only
  broken by the more rapid note of the machine guns. But our men never
  hesitated for a moment. The New Zealanders hurled themselves forward in a
  solid phalanx, passing through the eighty-eighth brigade, and many of the
  gallant men of those regiments, refusing to yield any right of way to them,
  joined their ranks and rushed forward in a thin, mad charge.</p>

  <p>"The line entered one Turkish trench with a rush, bayoneted all there, and
  then passed on into broken ground, shooting and stabbing, men falling amidst
  a terrible fusillade, but not a soul turning back. No sooner had one line
  charged than another pressed on after it, and then a third.</p>

  <p>"On the right of the New Zealanders the Australians advanced at the same
  moment, but over much more open ground, which provided little or no cover.
  They were met by a tornado of bullets, and were enfiladed by machine guns
  from the right, and the artillery in vain endeavoured to keep down this
  fire.</p>

  <p>"The manner in which these Dominion troops went forward will never be
  forgotten by those who witnessed it. The lines of infantry were enveloped in
  dust from the patter of countless bullets in the sandy soil and from the hail
  of shrapnel poured on them, for now the enemy's artillery concentrated
  furiously on the whole line.</p>

  <p>"The lines advanced steadily as if on parade, sometimes doubling,
  sometimes walking, and you saw them melt away under this dreadful fusillade,
  only to be renewed again as the reserves and supports moved forward to
  replace those who had fallen.</p>

  <p>"In spite of all obstacles a considerable advance towards Krithia was
  made, but at length a point was reached from which it was impossible to
  proceed further. Not a man attempted to return to the trenches. They simply
  lay down where they were and attempted to reply to their concealed enemy, not
  one of whom disclosed his position. These Australians and New Zealanders were
  determined not to budge, and proceeded to entrench themselves where they
  were. But it became obvious at the end of an hour that the attack had spent
  its force, and that the hope of taking Krithia by direct assault must be
  abandoned."</p>

  <p>The ground won amounted to no more than a few hundred yards, but what had
  been taken was held.</p>

  <p>The honours of those three days cannot well be divided.</p>

  <p>French, British, Senegalese, Australian, New Zealand and Indian troops
  fought side by side with the Naval men and that most extraordinary corps, the
  Foreign Legion.</p>

  <p>The Australian showed himself reckless of danger, and, in the face of a
  terribly punishing fire, was as steady as the oldest soldier. Here, too, the
  Naval Brigade, which had been under the command of the French General
  d'Amade, earned the praise of that gallant commander&mdash;praise which was
  indeed well earned.</p>

  <p>To many of the Territorials who took part in that fight it was a terrible
  baptism of fire, yet they behaved with the courage and <i>sang froid</i> of
  men who were inured to war. Our losses were heavy, but here again we have
  evidence that the Turk, for all the resistance he put up&mdash;and it was a
  magnificent resistance&mdash;suffered enormously. From an authoritative
  source it was learnt that 40,000 Turks were put out of action in those three
  days of fighting. Certainly the heavy shelling to which they were subjected
  must have caused enormous losses, and the holding up of our advance was
  probably due to the dauntless resistance of Turkish infantry who, because of
  the concealed position of their trenches, had escaped the devastating
  shelling which their less fortunate fellows had received. The force which von
  Goltz commanded was 200,000 men, and his losses were such as to necessitate
  the bringing forward from Constantinople of another 50,000. With 40,000 men
  on each mile of his front, it follows that the difficulty of forcing a way
  through was an enormous one, if indeed one which was not altogether
  impossible.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>In the final advance a platoon (fifty men) of Australians found themselves
  cut off from the rest of their regiment and subjected to a fire from three
  sides. A retirement to their line could only be carried out at the risk of
  very heavy losses, and the Australians decided to charge forward at the
  trench on their front, from whence most of the firing came, and this they
  did, occupying and holding the enemy's trench till under cover of darkness
  they were able to withdraw to a less parlous position.</p>

  <p>The desperate fighting of these three days had emphasised still further
  the gigantic difficulties of the task before the Allies. "Everywhere," as the
  official correspondent pointed out, "we had gained some ground, but the main
  object of the attack had not yet been achieved. Achi Baba still looked
  defiantly on the plain beneath, and it was obvious that such strong positions
  as the Turks held could only be won by extreme patience."</p>

  <p>And he might have added by the unwearying support of the Navy, which,
  despite the arrival on the scene of German submarines, were as constantly in
  attendance as ever.</p>

  <p>In an appendix is produced General Sir Ian Hamilton's account of the
  landing. No more memorable or better deserved tribute has been paid to the
  Senior Service that that which is contained in the sentence: "The Royal Navy
  has been father and mother to the Army."</p>

  <h2><a id="app"
     name="app"></a>APPENDIX. &mdash; SIR IAN HAMILTON'S DESPATCH</h2>

  <p>From the General Commanding the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force.</p>

  <p>To the Secretary of State for War, War Office, London, S.W.</p>

  <p>General Headquarters, Mediterranean Expeditionary Force,</p>

  <p><i>May 20th</i>, 1915.</p>

  <p>MY LORD&mdash;</p>

  <p>I have the honour to submit my report on the operations in the Gallipoli
  Peninsula up to and including May 5th.</p>

  <p>In accordance with your Lordship's instructions I left London on March
  13th with my General Staff by special train to Marseilles, and thence in
  H.M.S. <i>Phaeton</i> to the scene of the naval operations in the Eastern
  Mediterranean, reaching Tenedos on March 17th shortly after noon.</p>

  <p>Immediately on arrival I conferred with Vice-Admiral de Robeck, commanding
  the Eastern Mediterranean Fleet; General d'Amade, commanding the French Corps
  Expéditionnaire; and Contre Amiral Guepratte, in command of the French
  Squadron. At this conference past difficulties were explained to me, and the
  intention to make a fresh attack on the morrow was announced. The amphibious
  battle between warships and land fortresses took place next day, March 18th.
  I witnessed these stupendous events, and thereupon cabled your Lordship my
  reluctant deduction that the co-operation of the whole of the force under my
  command would be required to enable the Fleet effectively to force the
  Dardanelles.</p>

  <p>By that time I had already carried out a preliminary reconnaissance of the
  north-western shore of the Gallipoli Peninsula, from its isthmus, where it is
  spanned by the Bulair fortified lines, to Cape Helles, at its extremest
  point. From Bulair this singular feature runs in a south-westerly direction
  for fifty- two miles, attaining near its centre a breadth of twelve miles.
  The northern coast of the northern half of the promontory slopes downwards
  steeply to the Gulf of Xeros, in a chain of hills, which extend as far as
  Cape Sulva. The precipitous fall of these hills precludes landing, except at
  a few narrow gullies, far too restricted for any serious military movements.
  The southern half of the peninsula is shaped like a badly-worn boot. The
  ankle lies between Gaba Tepe and Kalkmaz Dagh; beneath the heel lie the
  cluster of forts at Kilid Bahr; whilst the toe is that promontory five miles
  in width, stretching from Tekke Bumu to Sedd-el-Bahr.</p>

  <p>The three dominating features in this southern section seemed to me to
  be:&mdash;</p>

  <p>(1) Saribair Mountain, running up in a succession of almost perpendicular
  escarpments to 970 feet. The whole mountain seemed to be a network of ravines
  and covered with thick jungle.</p>

  <p>(2) Kilid Bahr plateau, which rises, a natural fortification artificially
  fortified, to a height of 700 feet to cover the forts of the Narrows from an
  attack from the Aegean.</p>

  <p>(3)Achi Babi, a hill 600 feet in height, dominating at long field gun
  range what I have described as being the toe of the peninsula.</p>

  <p>A peculiarity to be noted as regards this last southern sector is that
  from Achi Babi to Cape Helles the ground is hollowed out like a spoon,
  presenting only its outer edges to direct fire from the sea. The inside of
  the spoon appears to be open and undulating, but actually it is full of
  spurs, nullahs, and confused underfeatures.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking the coast is precipitous, and good landing-places are
  few. Just south of Tekke Bumu is a small sandy bay (W), and half a mile north
  of it is another small break in the cliffs (X). Two miles farther up the
  coast the mouth of a stream indents these same cliffs (Y 2), and yet another
  mile and a half up a scrub-covered gully looked as if active infantry might
  be able to scramble up it on to heights not altogether dissimilar to those of
  Abraham, by Quebec (Y.). Inside Sedd-el-Bahr is a sandy beach (V), about 300
  yards across, facing a semi-circle of steeply-rising ground, as the flat
  bottom of a half- saucer faces the rim, a rim flanked on one side by an old
  castle, on the other by a modern fort. By Eski Hissarlik, on the east of
  Morto Bay (S), was another small beach, which was, however, dominated by the
  big guns from Asia. Turning northwards again, there are two good landing
  places on either side of Gaba Tepe. Farther to the north of that promontory
  the beach was supposed to be dangerous and difficult. In most of these
  landing-places the trenches and lines of wire entanglements were plainly
  visible from on board ship. What seemed to be gun emplacements and infantry
  redoubts could also be made out through a telescope, but of the full extent
  of these defences and of the forces available to man them there was no
  possibility of judging except by practical test.</p>

  <p>Altogether the result of this and subsequent reconnaissances was to
  convince me that nothing but a thorough and systematic scheme for flinging
  the whole of the troops under my command very rapidly ashore could be
  expected to meet with success; whereas, on the other hand, a tentative or
  piecemeal programme was bound to lead to disaster. The landing of an army
  upon the theatre of operations I have described&mdash;a theatre strongly
  garrisoned throughout, and prepared for any such attempt&mdash;involved
  difficulties for which no precedent was forthcoming in military history
  except possibly in the sinister legends of Xerxes. The beaches were either so
  well defended by works and guns or else so restricted by nature that it did
  not seem possible, even by two or three simultaneous landings, to pass the
  troops ashore quickly enough to enable them to maintain themselves against
  the rapid concentration and counterattack which the enemy was bound in such
  case to attempt. It became necessary, therefore, not only to land
  simultaneously at as many points as possible, but to threaten to land at
  other points as well. The first of these necessities involved another
  unavoidable if awkward contingency, the separation by considerable intervals
  of the force.</p>

  <p>The weather was also bound to play a vital part in my landing. Had it been
  British weather there would have been no alternative but instantly to give up
  the adventure. To land two or three thousand men, and then to have to break
  off and leave them exposed for a week to the attacks of 34,000 regular
  troops, with a hundred guns at their back, was not an eventuality to be
  lightly envisaged. Whatever happened, the weather must always remain an
  incalculable factor, but at least by delay till the end of April we had a
  fair chance of several days of consecutive calm.</p>

  <p>Before doing anything else I had to redistribute the troops on the
  transports to suit the order of their disembarkation. The bulk of the forces
  at my disposal had, perforce, been embarked without its having been possible
  to pay due attention to the operation upon which I now proposed that they
  should be launched.</p>

  <p>Owing to lack of facilities at Mudros redistribution in that harbour was
  out of the question. With your Lordship's approval, therefore, I ordered all
  the transports, except those of the Australian Infantry Brigade and the
  details encamped at Lemnos Island, to the Egyptian ports. On March 24th I
  myself, together with the General Staff, proceeded to Alexandria, where I
  remained until April 7th, working out the allocation of troops to transports
  in minutest details as a prelude to the forthcoming disembarkation. General
  d'Amade did likewise.</p>

  <p>On April 1st the remainder of the General Headquarters, which had not been
  mobilised when I left England, arrived at Alexandria.</p>

  <p>Apart from the re-arrangements of the troops, my visit to Egypt was not
  without profit, since it afforded me opportunities of conferring with the
  G.O.C. Egypt and of making myself acquainted with the troops, drawn from all
  parts of the French Republic and of the British Empire, which it was to be my
  privilege to command.</p>

  <p>By April 7th my preparations were sufficiently advanced to enable me to
  return with my General Staff to Lemnos, so as to put the finishing touches to
  my plan in close co-ordination with the Vice-Admiral Commanding the Eastern
  Mediterranean Fleet.</p>

  <p>The covering force of the 29th Division left Mudros Harbour on the evening
  of April 23rd for the five beaches, S, V, W, X, and Y. Of these, V, W, and X
  were to be main landings, the landings at S and Y being made mainly to
  protect the flanks, to disseminate the forces of the enemy, and to interrupt
  the arrival of his reinforcements. The landings at S and Y were to take place
  at dawn, whilst it was planned that the first troops for V, W, and X beaches
  should reach the shore simultaneously at 5.30 a.m. after half an hour's
  bombardment from the Fleet.</p>

  <p>The transports conveying the covering force arrived off Tenedos on the
  morning of the 24th, and during the afternoon the troops were transferred to
  the warships and fleet-sweepers in which they were to approach the shore.
  About midnight these ships, each towing a number of cutters and other small
  boats, silently slipped their cables and, escorted by the 3rd Squadron of the
  Fleet, steamed slowly towards their final rendezvous at Cape Helles. The
  rendezvous was reached just before dawn on the 25th. The morning was
  absolutely still; there was no sign of life on the shore; a thin veil of mist
  hung motionless over the promontory; the surface of the sea was as smooth as
  glass.</p>

  <p>The four battleships and four cruisers which formed the 3rd Squadron at
  once took up the positions that had been allotted to them, and at 5 a.m., it
  being then light enough to fire, a violent bombardment of the enemy's
  defences was begun. Meanwhile the troops were being rapidly transferred to
  the small boats in which they were to be towed ashore. Not a move on the part
  of the enemy; except for shells thrown from the Asiatic side of the Straits
  the guns of the Fleet remained unanswered.</p>

  <p>The detachment detailed for S beach (Eski Hissarlik Point) consisted of
  the 2nd South Wales Borderers (less one company) under Lieut Colonel Casson.
  Their landing was delayed by the current, but by 7.30 a.m. it had been
  successfully effected at the cost of some 50 casualties, and Lieut.-Colonel
  Casson was able to establish his small force on the high ground near De Totts
  Battery. Here he maintained himself until the general advance on the 27th
  brought him into touch with the main body.</p>

  <p>The landing on Y beach was entrusted to the King's Own Scottish Borderers
  and the Plymouth (Marine) Battalion, Royal Naval Division, specially attached
  to the 29th Division for this task, the whole under the command of
  Lieut.-Colonel Koe. The beach at this point consisted merely of a narrow
  strip of sand at the foot of a crumbling scrub-covered cliff some 200 feet
  high immediately to the west of Krithia.</p>

  <p>A number of small gullies running down the face of the cliff facilitated
  the climb to the summit, and so impracticable had these precipices appeared
  to the Turks that no steps had been taken to defend them. Very different
  would it have been had we, as was at one time intended, taken Y 2 for this
  landing. There a large force of infantry, entrenched up to their necks, and
  supported by machine and Hotchkiss guns, were awaiting an attempt which could
  hardly have made good its footing. But at Y both battalions were able in the
  first instance to establish themselves on the heights, reserves of food,
  water, and ammunition were hauled up to the top of the cliff, and, in
  accordance with the plan of operations, an endeavour was immediately made to
  gain touch with the troops landing at X beach. Unfortunately, the enemy's
  strong detachment from Y 2 interposed, our troops landing at X were fully
  occupied in attacking the Turks immediately to their front, and the attempt
  to join hands was not persevered with.</p>

  <p>Later in the day a large force of Turks were seen to be advancing upon the
  cliffs above Y beach, from the direction of Krithia, and Colonel Koe was
  obliged to entrench. From this time onward his small force was subjected to
  strong and repeated attacks, supported by field artillery, and owing to the
  configuration of the ground, which here drops inland from the edge of the
  cliff, the guns of the supporting ships could render him little assistance.
  Throughout the afternoon and all through the night the Turks made assault
  after assault upon the British line.</p>

  <p>They threw bombs into the trenches, and, favoured by darkness, actually
  led a pony with a machine gun on its back over the defences and were
  proceeding to come into action in the middle of our position when they were
  bayoneted.</p>

  <p>The British repeatedly counter-charged with the bayonet, and always drove
  off the enemy for the moment, but the Turks were in a vast superiority and
  fresh troops took the place of those who temporarily fell back. Colonel Koe
  (since died of wounds) had become a casualty early in the day, and the number
  of officers and men killed and wounded during the incessant fighting was very
  heavy. By 7 a.m. on the 26th only about half of the King's Own Scottish
  Borderers remained to man the entrenchment made for four times their number.
  These brave fellows were absolutely worn out with continuous fighting; it was
  doubtful if reinforcements could reach them in time, and orders were issued
  for them to be re-embarked. Thanks to H.M.S. <i>Goliath</i>, <i>Dublin</i>,
  <i>Amethyst</i>, and <i>Sapphire</i>, thanks also to the devotion of a small
  rearguard of the King's Own Scottish Borderers, which kept off the enemy from
  lining the cliff, the re- embarkation of the whole of the troops, together
  with the wounded, stores, and ammunition, was safely accomplished, and both
  battalions were brought round the southern end of the peninsula. Deplorable
  as the heavy losses had been, and unfortunate as was the tactical failure to
  make good so much ground at the outset, yet, taking the operation as it
  stood, there can be no doubt it has contributed greatly to the success of the
  main attack, seeing that the plucky stand made at Y beach had detained heavy
  columns of the enemy from arriving at the southern end of the peninsula
  during what it will be seen was a very touch and go struggle.</p>

  <p>The landing-place known as X beach consists of a strip of sand some 200
  yards long by eight yards wide at the foot of a low cliff. The troops to be
  landed here were the 1st Royal Fusiliers, who were to be towed ashore from
  H.M.S. <i>Implacable</i> in two parties, half a battalion at a time, together
  with a beach working party found by the <i>Anson</i> Battalion, Royal Naval
  Division. About 6 a.m. H.M.S. <i>Implacable</i>, with a boldness much admired
  by the Army, stood quite close in to the beach, firing very rapidly with
  every gun she could bring to bear. Thus seconded, the Royal Fusiliers made
  good their landing with but little loss. The battalion then advanced to
  attack the Turkish trenches on the Hill 114, situated between V and W
  beaches, but were heavily counter-attacked and forced to give ground.</p>

  <p>Two more battalions of the 87th Brigade soon followed them, and by evening
  the troops had established themselves in an entrenched position extending
  from half a mile round the landing-place and as far south as Hill 114. Here
  they were in touch with the Lancashire Fusiliers, who had landed on W beach.
  Brigadier- General Marshall, commanding the 87th Brigade, had been wounded
  during the day's fighting, but continued in command of the brigade.</p>

  <p>The landing on V beach was planned to take place on the following
  lines:&mdash;</p>

  <p>As soon as the enemy's defences had been heavily bombarded by the Fleet,
  three companies of the Dublin Fusiliers, were to be towed ashore. They were
  to be closely followed by the collier <i>River Clyde</i> (Commander Unwin,
  R.N.), carrying between decks the balance of the Dublin Fusiliers, the
  Munster Fusiliers, half a battalion of the Hampshire Regiment, the West
  Riding Field Company, and other details.</p>

  <p>The <i>River Clyde</i> had been specially prepared for the rapid
  disembarkation of her complement, and large openings for the exit of the
  troops had been cut in her sides, giving on to a wide gang-plank by which the
  men could pass rapidly into lighters which she had in tow. As soon as the
  first tows had reached land the <i>River Clyde</i> was to be run straight
  ashore. Her lighters were to be placed in position to form a gangway between
  the ship and the beach, and by this means it was hoped that 2,000 men could
  be thrown ashore with the utmost rapidity. Further, to assist in covering the
  landing, a battery of machine guns, protected by sandbags, had been mounted
  in her bows.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the covering force detailed for this beach was then to
  follow in tows from the attendant battleships.</p>

  <p>V beach is situated immediately to the west of Sedd-el-Bahr. Between the
  bluff on which stands Sedd-el-Bahr village and that which is crowned by No. 1
  fort the ground forms a very regular amphitheatre of three or four hundred
  yards' radius. The slopes down to the beach are slightly concave, so that the
  whole area contained within the limits of this natural amphitheatre, whose
  grassy terraces rise gently to a height of a hundred feet above the shore,
  can be swept by the fire of a defender. The beach itself is a sandy strip
  some ten yards wide and 350 yards long, backed along almost the whole of its
  extent by a low sandy escarpment about four feet high, where the ground falls
  nearly sheer down to the beach. The slight shelter afforded by this
  escarpment played no small part in the operations of the succeeding
  thirty-two hours.</p>

  <p>At the south-eastern extremity of the beach, between the shore and the
  village, stands the old fort of Sedd-el-Bahr, a battered ruin with wide
  breaches in its walls and mounds of fallen masonry within and around it. On
  the ridge to the north, overlooking the amphitheatre, stands a ruined
  barrack. Both of these buildings, as well as No. 1 fort, had been long
  bombarded by the Fleet, and the guns of the forts had been put out of action;
  but their crumbled walls and the ruined outskirts of the village afforded
  cover for riflemen, while from the terraced slopes already described the
  defenders were able to command the open beach, as a stage is overlooked from
  the balconies of a theatre. On the very margin of the beach a strong
  barbed-wire entanglement, made of heavier metal and longer barbs than I have
  ever seen elsewhere, ran right across from the old fort of Sedd-el-Bahr to
  the foot of the north- western headland. Two-thirds of the way up the ridge a
  second and even stronger entanglement crossed the amphitheatre, passing in
  front of the old barrack and ending in the outskirts of the village. A third
  transverse entanglement, joining these two, ran up the hill near the eastern
  end of the beach, and almost at right angles to it. Above the upper
  entanglement the ground was scored with the enemy's trenches, in one of which
  four pom-poms were emplaced; in others were dummy pom-poms to draw fire,
  while the <i>débris</i> of the shattered buildings on either flank afforded
  cover and concealment for a number of machine guns, which brought a
  cross-fire to bear on the ground already swept by rifle-fire from the
  ridge.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, the difficulties in the way of previous reconnaissance
  had rendered it impossible to obtain detailed information with regard either
  to the locality or to the enemy's preparations.</p>

  <p>As often happens in war, the actual course of events did not quite
  correspond with the intentions of the Commander The <i>River Clyde</i> came
  into position off Sedd-el-Bahr in advance of the tows, and, just as the
  latter reached the shore, Commander Unwin beached his ship also. Whilst the
  boats and the collier were approaching the landing place the Turks made no
  sign. Up to the very last moment it appeared as if the landing was to be
  unopposed. But the moment the first boat touched bottom the storm broke. A
  tornado of fire swept over the beach, the incoming boats, and the collier.
  The Dublin Fusiliers, and the naval boats' crews suffered exceedingly heavy
  losses while still in the boats. Those who succeeded in landing and in
  crossing the strip of sand managed to gain some cover when they reached the
  low escarpment on the further side. None of the boats, however, were able to
  get off again, and they and their crews were destroyed upon the beach.</p>

  <p>Now came the moment for the <i>River Clyde</i> to pour forth her living
  freight; but grievous delay was caused here by the difficulty of placing the
  lighters in position between the ship and the shore. A strong current
  hindered the work, and the enemy's fire was so intense that almost every man
  engaged upon it was immediately shot. Owing, however, to the splendid
  gallantry of the naval working party, the lighters were eventually placed in
  position, and then the disembarkation began.</p>

  <p>A company of the Munster Fusiliers led the way; but, short as was the
  distance, few of the men ever reached the farther side of the beach through
  the hail of bullets which poured down upon them from both flanks and the
  front. As the second company followed, the extemporised pier of lighters gave
  way in the current. The end nearest to the shore drifted into deep water, and
  many men who had escaped being shot were drowned by the weight of their
  equipment in trying to swim from the lighter to the beach. Undaunted workers
  were still forthcoming, the lighters were again brought into position, and
  the third company of the Munster Fusiliers rushed ashore, suffering heaviest
  loss this time from shrapnel as well as from rifle, pom-pom, and machine-gun
  fire.</p>

  <p>For a space the attempt to land was discontinued. When it was resumed the
  lighters again drifted into deep water, with Brigadier-General Napier,
  Captain Costeker, his Brigade Major, and a number of men of the Hampshire
  Regiment on board. There was nothing for them all but to lie down on the
  lighters, and it was here that General Napier and Captain Costeker were
  killed. At this time, between 10 and ii a.m., about 1,000 men had left the
  collier, and of these nearly half had been killed or wounded before they
  could reach the little cover afforded by the steep, sandy bank at the top of
  the beach. Further attempts to disembark were now given up. Had the troops
  all been in open boats but few of them would have lived to tell the tale.
  But, most fortunately, the collier was so constructed as to afford fairly
  efficient protection to the men who were still on board, and so long as they
  made no attempt to land, they suffered comparatively little loss.</p>

  <p>Throughout the remainder of the day there was practically no change in the
  position of affairs. The situation was probably saved by the machine-guns on
  the <i>River Clyde</i>, which did valuable service in keeping down the
  enemy's fire and in preventing any attempt on their part to launch a
  counter-attack. One half-company of the Dublin Fusiliers, which had been
  landed at a camber just east of Sedd-el-Bahr village, was unable to work its
  way across to V beach, and by mid-day had only twenty-five men left. It was
  proposed to divert to Y beach that part of the main body which had been
  intended to land on V beach; but this would have involved considerable delay
  owing to the distance, and the main body was diverted to W beach, where the
  Lancashire Fusiliers had already effected a landing.</p>

  <p>Late in the afternoon part of the Worcestershire Regiment and the
  Lancashire Fusiliers worked across the high ground from W beach, and seemed
  likely to relieve the situation by taking the defenders of V beach in flank.
  The pressure on their own front, however, and the numerous barbed-wire
  entanglements which intervened, checked this advance, and at nightfall the
  Turkish garrison still held their ground. Just before dark some small parties
  of our men made their way along the shore to the outer walls of the Old Fort,
  and when night had fallen the remainder of the infantry from the collier were
  landed. A good force was now available for attack, but our troops were at
  such a cruel disadvantage as to position, and the fire of the enemy was still
  so accurate in the bright moonlight, that all attempts to clear the fort and
  the outskirts of the village during the night failed one after the other. The
  wounded who were able to do so without support returned to the collier under
  cover of darkness; but otherwise the situation at daybreak on the 26th was
  the same as it had been on the previous day, except that the troops first
  landed were becoming very exhausted.</p>

  <p>Twenty-four hours after the disembarkation began there were ashore on V
  beach the survivors of the Dublin and Munster Fusiliers and of two companies
  of the Hampshire Regiment. The Brigadier and his Brigade Major had been
  killed; Lieutenant-Colonel Carrington Smith, commanding the Hampshire
  Regiment, had been killed and the adjutant had been wounded. The Adjutant of
  the Munster Fusiliers was wounded and the great majority of the senior
  officers were either wounded or killed. The remnant of the landing-party
  still crouched on the beach beneath the shelter of the sandy escarpment which
  had saved so many lives. With them were two officers of my General
  Staff&mdash;Lieutenant-Colonel Doughty- Wylie and Lieutenant-Colonel
  Williams. These two officers who had landed from the <i>River Clyde</i>, had
  been striving, with conspicuous contempt for danger, to keep all their
  comrades in good heart during this day and night of ceaseless imminent
  peril.</p>

  <p>Now that it was daylight once more, Lieutenant-Colonels Doughty-Wylie and
  Williams set to work to organise an attack on the hill above the beach. Any
  soldier who has endeavoured to pull scattered units together after they have
  been dominated by many consecutive hours by close and continuous fire will be
  able to take the measure of their difficulties. Fortunately General Hunter-
  Weston had arranged with Rear-Admiral Wemyss about this same time for a heavy
  bombardment to be opened by the ships upon the Old Fort, Sedd-el-Bahr
  Village, the old Castle north of the village, and on the ground leading up
  from the beach. Under cover of this bombardment, and led by
  Lieutenant-Colonel Doughty Wylie, and Captain Walford, Brigade Major R.A.,
  the troops gained a footing in the village by 10 a.m. They encountered a most
  stubborn opposition and suffered heavy losses from the fire of well concealed
  riflemen and machine-guns.</p>

  <p>Undeterred by the resistance, and supported by the naval gunfire, they
  pushed forward, and soon after midday they penetrated to the northern edge of
  the village, whence they were in a position to attack the Old Castle and Hill
  141. During this advance Captain Walford was killed. Lieutenant-Colonel
  Doughty- Wylie had most gallantly led the attack all the way up from the
  beach through the west side of the village, under a galling fire. And now,
  when, owing so largely to his own inspiring example and intrepid courage, the
  position had almost been gained, he was killed while leading the last
  assault. But the attack was pushed forward without wavering, and, fighting
  their way across the open with great dash, the troops gained the summit and
  occupied the Old Castle and Hill 141 before 2 p.m.</p>

  <p>W beach consists of a strip of deep, powdery sand some 350 yards long and
  from 15 to 40 yards wide, situated immediately south of Tekke Burnu, where a
  small gully running down to the sea opens out a break in the cliffs. On
  either flank of the beach the ground rises precipitously, but, in the centre,
  a number of sand dunes afford a more gradual access to the ridge overlooking
  the sea. Much time and ingenuity had been employed by the Turks in turning
  this landing place into a death trap. Close to the water's edge a broad
  wire-entanglement extended the whole length of the shore and a supplementary
  barbed network lay concealed under the surface of the sea in the shallows.
  Land mines and sea mines had been laid. The high ground overlooking the beach
  was strongly fortified with trenches to which the gully afforded a natural
  covered approach. A number of machine guns also were cunningly tucked away
  into holes in the cliff so as to be immune from a naval bombardment whilst
  they were converging their fire on the wire entanglements. The crest of the
  hill overlooking the beach was in its turn commanded by high ground to the
  north-west and south-east, and especially by two strong infantry redoubts
  near point 138. Both these redoubts were protected by wire entanglements
  about 20 feet broad, and could be approached only by a bare glacis-like slope
  leading up from the high ground above W beach or from the Cape Helles
  lighthouse. In addition, another separate entanglement ran down from these
  two redoubts to the edge of the cliff near the lighthouse, making
  intercommunication between V and W beaches impossible until these redoubts
  had been captured.</p>

  <p>So strong, in fact, were the defences of W beach that the Turks may well
  have considered them impregnable, and it is my firm conviction that no finer
  feat of arms has ever been achieved by the British soldier&mdash;or any other
  soldier&mdash;than the storming of these trenches from open boats on the
  morning of April 25.</p>

  <p>The landing at W had been entrusted to the 1st Battalion Lancashire
  Fusiliers (Major Bishop), and it was to the complete lack of the senses of
  danger or of fear of this daring battalion that we owed our astonishing
  success. As in the case of the landing at X, the disembarkation had been
  delayed for half an hour, but at 6 a.m. the whole battalion approached the
  shore together, towed by eight picket boats in line abreast, each picket boat
  pulling four ship's cutters. As soon as shallow water was reached, the tows
  were cast off and the boats were at once rowed to the shore. Three companies
  headed for the beach and a company on the left of the line made for a small
  ledge of rock immediately under the cliff at Tekke Bumu. Brigadier-General
  Hare, commanding the 88th Brigade, accompanied this latter party, which
  escaped the cross fire brought to bear upon the beach, and was also in a
  better position than the rest of the battalion to turn the wire
  entanglements.</p>

  <p>While the troops were approaching the shore no shot had been fired from
  the enemy's trenches, but as soon as the first boat touched the ground a
  hurricane of lead swept over the battalion. Gallantly led by their officers,
  the Fusiliers literally hurled themselves ashore, and, fired at from right,
  left, and centre, commenced hacking their way through the wire. A long line
  of men was at once mown down as by a scythe, but the remainder were not to be
  denied. Covered by the fire of the warships, which had now closed right in to
  the shore, and helped by the flanking fire of the company on the extreme
  left, they broke through the entanglements and collected under the cliffs on
  either side of the beach. Here the companies were rapidly reformed, and set
  forth to storm the enemy's entrenchments wherever they could find them.</p>

  <p>In making these attacks the bulk of the battalion moved up towards Hill
  114, whilst a small party worked down towards the trenches on the Cape Helles
  side of the landing-place.</p>

  <p>Several land mines were exploded by the Turks during the advance, but the
  determination of the troops was in no way affected. By 10 a.m. three lines of
  hostile trenches were in our hands, and our hold on the beach was
  assured.</p>

  <p>About 9.30 a.m. more infantry had begun to disembark, and two hours later
  a- junction was effected on Hill 114 with the troops who had landed on X
  beach.</p>

  <p>On the right, owing to the strength of the redoubt on Hill 138, little
  progress could be made. The small party of Lancashire Fusiliers which had
  advanced in this direction succeeded in reaching the edge of the wire
  entanglements, but were not strong enough to do more, and it was here that
  Major Frankland, Brigade Major of the 86th Infantry Brigade, who had gone
  forward to make a personal reconnaissance, was unfortunately killed.
  Brigadier- General Hare had been wounded earlier in the day, and Colonel
  Woolly-Dod, General Staff 29th Division, was now sent ashore to take command
  at W beach and organise a further advance.</p>

  <p>At 2 p.m., after the ground near Hill 138 had been subjected to a heavy
  bombardment, the Worcester Regiment advanced to the assault. Several men of
  this battalion rushed forward with great spirit to cut passages through the
  entanglement; some were killed, others persevered, and by 4 p.m. the hill and
  redoubt were captured.</p>

  <p>An attempt was now made to join hands with the troops on V beach, who
  could make no headway at all against the dominating defences of the enemy. To
  help them out the 86th Brigade pushed forward in an easterly direction along
  the cliff. There is a limit, however, to the storming of barbed-wire
  entanglements. More of these barred the way. Again the heroic wire-cutters
  came out. Through glasses they could be seen quietly snipping away under a
  hellish fire as if they were pruning a vineyard. Again some of them fell. The
  fire pouring out of No. 1 fort grew hotter and hotter, until the troops, now
  thoroughly exhausted by a sleepless night and by the long day's fighting
  under a hot sun, had to rest on their laurels for a while.</p>

  <p>When night fell, the British position in front of W beach extended from
  just east of Cape Helles lighthouse, through Hill 138, to Hill 114.
  Practically every man had to be thrown into the trenches to hold this line,
  and the only available reserves on this part of our front were the 2nd London
  Field Company R.E. and a platoon of the Anson Battalion, which had been
  landed as a beach working party.</p>

  <p>During the night several strong and determined counter-attacks were made,
  all successfully repulsed without loss of ground. Meanwhile the
  disembarkation of the remainder of the division was proceeding on W and X
  beaches.</p>

  <p>The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps sailed out of Mudros Bay on the
  afternoon of April 24, escorted by the 2nd Squadron of the Fleet, under Rear-
  Admiral Thursby. The rendezvous was reached just after half-past one in the
  morning of the 25th, and there the 1,500 men who had been placed on board
  H.M. ships before leaving Mudros were transferred to their boats. This
  operation was carried out with remarkable expedition, and in absolute
  silence. Simultaneously the remaining 2,500 men of the covering force were
  transferred from their transports to six destroyers. At 2.30 a.m. H.M. ships,
  together with the tows and the destroyers, proceeded to within some four
  miles of the coast, H.M.S. <i>Queen</i> (flying Rear-Admiral Thursby's flag)
  directing on a point about a mile north of Kaba Tepe. At 3.30 a.m. orders to
  go ahead and land were given to the tows and at 4.10 a.m. the destroyers were
  ordered to follow.</p>

  <p>All these arrangements worked without a hitch, and were carried out in
  complete orderliness and silence. No breath of wind ruffled the surface of
  the sea, and every condition was favourable save for the moon, which, sinking
  behind the ships, may have silhouetted them against its orb, betraying them
  thus to watchers on the shore.</p>

  <p>A rugged and difficult part of the coast had been selected for the
  landing, so difficult and rugged that I considered the Turks were not at all
  likely to anticipate such a descent. Indeed, owing to the tows having failed
  to maintain their exact direction the actual point of disembarkation was
  rather more than a mile north of that which I had selected, and was more
  closely overhung by steeper cliffs. Although this accident increased the
  initial difficulty of driving the enemy off the heights inland, it has since
  proved itself to have been a blessing in disguise, inasmuch as the actual
  base of the force of occupation has been much better defiladed from shell
  fire.</p>

  <p>The beach on which the landing was actually effected is a very narrow
  strip of sand, about 1,000 yards in length, bounded on the north and the
  south by two small promontories. At its southern extremity a deep ravine,
  with exceedingly steep, scrub-clad sides, runs inland in a north-easterly
  direction. Near the northern end of the beach a small but steep gully runs up
  into the hills at right angles to the shore. Between the ravine and the gully
  the whole of the beach is backed by the seaward face of the spur which forms
  the north-western side of the ravine. From the top of the spur the ground
  falls almost sheer except near the southern limit of the beach, where gentler
  slopes give access to the mouth of the ravine behind. Further inland lie in a
  tangled knot the under-features of Saribair, separated by deep ravines, which
  take a most confusing diversity of direction. Sharp spurs, covered with dense
  scrub, and falling away in many places in precipitous sandy cliffs, radiate
  from the principal mass of the mountain, from which they run north-west,
  west, south-west, and south to the coast.</p>

  <p>The boats approached the land in the silence and the darkness, and they
  were close to the shore before the enemy stirred. Then about one battalion of
  Turks was seen running along the beach to intercept the lines of boats. At
  this so critical a moment the conduct of all ranks was most praiseworthy. Not
  a word was spoken&mdash;every one remained perfectly orderly and quiet
  awaiting the enemy's fire, which sure enough opened, causing many casualties.
  The moment the boats touched land the Australians' turn had come. Like
  lightning they leapt ashore, and each man as he did so went straight as his
  bayonet at the enemy. So vigorous was the onslaught that the Turks made no
  attempt to withstand it and fled from ridge to ridge pursued by the
  Australian infantry.</p>

  <p>This attack was carried out by the 3rd Australian Brigade, under Major
  (temporary Colonel) Sinclair Maclagan, D.S.O. The 1st and 2nd Brigades
  followed promptly, and were all disembarked by 2 p.m., by which time 12,000
  men and two batteries of Indian Mountain Artillery had been landed. The
  disembarkation of further artillery was delayed owing to the fact that the
  enemy's heavy guns opened on the anchorage and forced the transports, which
  had been subjected to continuous shelling from his field guns, to stand
  farther out to sea.</p>

  <p>The broken ground, the thick scrub, the necessity for sending any formed
  detachments post haste as they landed to the critical point of the moment,
  the headlong valour of scattered groups of the men who had pressed far
  further into the peninsula than had been intended&mdash;all these led to
  confusion and mixing up of units. Eventually the mixed crowd of fighting men,
  some advancing from the beach, others falling back before the oncoming
  Turkish supports, solidified into a semi-circular position with its right
  about a mile north of Gaba Tepe and its left on the high ground over
  Fisherman's Hut. During this period, parties of the 9th and 10th Battalions
  charged and put out of action three of the enemy's Krupp guns. During this
  period also the disembarkation of the Australian Division was being followed
  by that of the New Zealand and Australian Division (two brigades only).</p>

  <p>From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. the enemy, now reinforced to a strength of 20,000
  men, attacked the whole line, making a specially strong effort against the
  3rd Brigade and the left of the 2nd Brigade. This counter-attack was,
  however, handsomely repulsed with the help of the guns of H.M. ships. Between
  5 and 6.30 p.m. a third most determined counter-attack was made against the
  3rd Brigade, who held their ground with more than equivalent stubbornness.
  During the night again the Turks made constant attacks, and the 8th Battalion
  repelled a bayonet charge; but in spite of all the line held firm. The troops
  had had practically no rest on the night of the 24/25th; they had been
  fighting hard all day over most difficult country, and they had been
  subjected to heavy shrapnel fire in the open. Their casualties had been
  deplorably heavy. But, despite their losses and in spite of their fatigue,
  the morning of the 26th found them still in good heart and as full of fight
  as ever.</p>

  <p>It is a consolation to know' that the Turks suffered still more seriously.
  Several times our machine guns got on to them in close* format ion, and the
  whole surrounding country is still strewn with their dead of this date.</p>

  <p>The reorganisation of units and formations was impossible during the 26th
  and 27th owing to persistent attacks. An advance was impossible until a
  reorganisation could be effected, and it only remained to entrench the
  position gained and to perfect the arrangements for bringing up ammunition,
  water, and supplies to the ridges&mdash;in itself a most difficult
  undertaking. Four battalions of the Royal Naval Division were sent up to
  reinforce the Army Corps on the 28th and 29th April.</p>

  <p>On the night of May 2nd a bold effort was made to seize a commanding knoll
  in front of the centre of the line. The enemy's enfilading machine guns were
  too scientifically posted, and 800 men were lost without advantage beyond the
  infliction of a corresponding loss to the enemy. On May 4th an attempt to
  seize Kaba Tepe was also unsuccessful, the barbed wire here being something
  beyond belief. But a number of minor operations have been carried out, such
  as the taking of a Turkish observing station; the strengthening of
  entrenchments; the reorganisation of units, and the perfecting of
  communication with the landing- place. Also a constant strain has been placed
  upon some of the best troops of the enemy, who, to the number of 24,000, are
  constantly kept fighting and being killed and wounded freely, as the Turkish
  sniper is no match for the Kangaroo shooter, even at his own game.</p>

  <p>The assistance of the Royal Navy, here as elsewhere, has been invaluable.
  The whole of the arrangements have been in Admiral Thursby *s hands, and I
  trust I may be permitted to say what a trusty and powerful friend he has
  proved himself to be to the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps.</p>

  <p>Concurrently with the British landings a regiment of the French Corps was
  successfully disembarked at Kum Kale under the guns of the French Fleet, and
  remained ashore till the morning of the 26th, when they were re-embarked; 500
  prisoners were captured by the French on this day.</p>

  <p>This operation drew the fire of the Asiatic guns from Morto Bay and V
  beach on to Kum Kale, and contributed largely to the success of the British
  landings.</p>

  <p>On the evening of the 26th the main disembarkation of the French Corps was
  begun, V beach being allotted to our Allies for this purpose, and it was
  arranged that the French should hold the portion of the front between the
  telegraph wire and the sea.</p>

  <p>The following day I ordered a general advance to a line stretching from
  Hill 236 near Eski Hissarlik Point to the mouth of the stream two miles north
  of Tekke Bumu. This advance, which was commenced at midday, was completed
  without opposition, and the troops at once consolidated their new line. The
  forward movement relieved the growing congestion on the beaches, and by
  giving us possession of several new wells afforded a temporary solution to
  the water problem, which had hitherto been causing me much anxiety.</p>

  <p>By the evening of the 27th the Allied Forces had established themselves on
  a line some three miles long, which stretched from the mouth of the nullah,
  3,200 yards north-east of Tekke Burnu, to Eski Hissarlik Point, the three
  brigades of the 29th Division less two battalions on the left and in the
  centre, with four French battalions on the right, and beyond them again the
  South Wales Borderers on the extreme right.</p>

  <p>Owing to casualties this line was somewhat thinly held. Still, it was so
  vital to make what headway we could before the enemy recovered himself and
  received fresh reinforcements that it was decided to push on as quickly as
  possible. Orders were therefore issued for a general advance to commence at 8
  a.m. next day.</p>

  <p>The 29th Division were to march on Krithia, with their left brigade
  leading, the French were directed to extend their left in conformity with the
  British movements, and to retain their right on the coastline south of the
  Kereves Dere.</p>

  <p>The advance commenced at 8 a.m. on the 28th, and was carried out with
  commendable vigour, despite the fact that from the moment of landing the
  troops had been unable to obtain any proper rest.</p>

  <p>The 87th Brigade, with which had been incorporated the Drake Battalion,
  Royal Naval Division, in the place of the King's Own Scottish Borderers and
  South Wales Borderers, pushed on rapidly, and by 10 a.m. had advanced some
  two miles. Here the further progress of the Border Regiment was barred by a
  strong work on the left flank. They halted to concentrate and make
  dispositions to attack it, and at that moment had to withstand a determined
  counterattack by the Turks. Aided by heavy gun fire from H.M.S. <i>Queen
  Elizabeth</i>, they succeeded in beating off the attack, but they made no
  further progress that day, and when night fell, entrenched themselves on the
  ground they had gained in the morning.</p>

  <p>The Inniskilling Fusiliers, who advanced with their right on the Krithia
  ravine, reached a point about three-quarters of a mile* south-west of
  Krithia. This was, however, the farthest limit attained, and later on in the
  day they fell back into line with other corps.</p>

  <p>The 88th Brigade on the right of the 87th progressed steadily until about
  11.30 a.m., when the stubbornness of the opposition, coupled with a dearth of
  ammunition, brought their advance to a standstill. The 86th Brigade, under
  Lieutenant Colonel Casson, which had been held in reserve, were thereupon
  ordered to push forward through the 88th Brigade in the direction of
  Krithia.</p>

  <p>The movement commenced at about 1 p.m., but though small reconnoitring
  parties got to within a few hundred yards of Krithia, the main body of the
  Brigade did not get beyond the line held by the 88th Brigade. Meanwhile, the
  French had also pushed on in the face of strong opposition along the spurs on
  the western bank of the Kereves Dere, and had got to within a mile of Krithia
  with their right thrown back and their left in touch with the 88th Brigade.
  Here they were unable to make further progress; gradually the strength of the
  resistance made itself felt, and our Allies were forced during the afternoon
  to give ground.</p>

  <p>By 2 p.m. the whole of the troops with the exception of the Drake
  Battalion had been absorbed into the firing line. The men were exhausted, and
  the few guns landed at the time were unable to afford them adequate artillery
  support. The small amount of transport available did not suffice to maintain
  the supply of munitions, and cartridges were running short despite all
  efforts to push them up from the landing places.</p>

  <p>Hopes of getting a footing on Achi Babi had now perforce to be
  abandoned&mdash;at least for this occasion. The best that could be expected
  was that we should be able to maintain what we had won, and when at 3 p.m.
  the Turks made a determined counter-attack with the bayonet against the
  centre and right of our line, even this seemed exceedingly doubtful. Actually
  a partial retirement did take place. The French were also forced back, and at
  6 p.m. orders were issued for our troops to entrench themselves as best they
  could in the positions they then held, with their right flank thrown back so
  as to maintain connection with our Allies. In this retirement the right flank
  of the 88th Brigade was temporarily uncovered, and the Worcester Regiment
  suffered severely.</p>

  <p>Had it been possible to push in reinforcements in men, artillery, and
  munitions during the day, Krithia should have fallen, and much subsequent
  fighting for its capture would have been avoided.</p>

  <p>Two days later this would have been feasible, but I had to reckon with the
  certainty that the enemy would, in that same time, have received
  proportionately greater support. I was faced by the usual choice of evils,
  and although the result was not what I had hoped, I have no reason to believe
  that hesitation and delay would better have answered my purpose.</p>

  <p>For, after all, we had pushed forward quite appreciably on the whole. The
  line eventually held by our troops on the night of the 28th ran from a point
  on the coast three miles north-west of Tekke Bumu to a point one mile north
  of Eski Hissarlik, whence it was continued by the French south-east to the
  coast.</p>

  <p>Much inevitable mixing of units of the 86th and 88th Brigades had occurred
  during the day's fighting, and there was a dangerous reentrant in the line at
  the junction of the 87th and 88th Brigades near the Krithia nullah. The
  French lost heavily, especially in officers, and required time to
  reorganise.</p>

  <p>The 29th April was consequently spent in straightening the line, and in
  consolidating and strengthening the positions gained. There was a certain
  amount of artillery and musketry fire, but nothing serious.</p>

  <p>Similarly, on the 30th, no advance was made, nor was any attack delivered
  by the enemy. The landing of the bulk of the artillery was completed, and a
  readjustment of the line took place, the portion held by the French being
  somewhat increased.</p>

  <p>Two more battalions of the Royal Naval Division had been disembarked, and
  these, together with three battalions of the 88th Brigade withdrawn from the
  line, were formed into a reserve.</p>

  <p>This reserve was increased on May 1st by the addition of the 29th Indian
  Infantry Brigade, which released the three battalions of the 88th Brigade to
  return to the trenches. The Corps Expéditionnaire d'Orient had disembarked
  the whole of their infantry and all but two of their batteries by the same
  evening.</p>

  <p>At 10 p.m. the Turks opened a hot shell fire upon our position, and half
  an hour later, just before the rise of the moon, they delivered a series of
  desperate attacks. Their formation was in three solid lines, the men in the
  front rank being deprived of ammunition to make them rely only upon the
  bayonet. The officers were served out with coloured Bengal lights to fire
  from their pistols, red indicating to the Turkish guns that they were to
  lengthen their range; green that our main position had been carried. The
  Turkish attack was to crawl on hands and knees until the time came for the
  final rush to be made. An eloquent hortative was signed von Zowenstern and
  addressed to the Turkish rank and file, who were called upon, by one mighty
  effort, to fling us all back into the sea.</p>

  <p>"Attack the enemy with the bayonet and utterly destroy him!</p>

  <p>"We shall not retire one step; for, if we do, our religion, our country,
  and our nation will perish!</p>

  <p>"Soldiers! The world is looking at you! Your only hope of salvation is to
  bring this battle to a successful issue or gloriously to give up your life in
  the attempt!"</p>

  <p>The first momentum of this ponderous onslaught fell upon the right of the
  86th Brigade, an unlucky spot, seeing all the officers thereabouts had
  already been killed or wounded. So when the Turks came right on without
  firing and charged into the trenches with the bayonet they made an ugly gap
  in the line. This gap was instantly filled by the 5th Royal Scots
  (Territorials), who faced to their flank and executed a brilliant bayonet
  charge against the enemy, and by the Essex Regiment detached for the purpose
  by the Officer Commanding 88th Brigade. The rest of the British line held its
  own with comparative ease, and it was not found necessary to employ any
  portion of the reserve. The storm next broke in fullest violence against the
  French left, which was held by the Senegalese. Behind them were two British
  Field Artillery Brigades and a Howitzer Battery. After several charges and
  counter-charges the Senegalese began to give ground, and a company of the
  Worcester Regiment and some gunners were sent forward to hold the gap. Later,
  a second company of the Worcester Regiment was also sent up, and the position
  was then maintained for the remainder of the night, although about 2 a.m. it
  was found necessary to dispatch one battalion Royal Naval Division to
  strengthen the extreme right of the French.</p>

  <p>About 5 a.m. a counter-offensive was ordered, and the whole line began to
  advance. By 7.30 a.m. the British left had gained some 500 yards, and the
  centre had pushed the enemy back and inflicted heavy losses. The right also
  had gained some ground in conjunction with the French left, but the remainder
  of the French line was unable to progress. As the British centre and left
  were now subjected to heavy cross fire from concealed machine guns, it was
  found impossible to maintain the ground gained, and therefore, about 11 a.m.,
  the whole line withdrew to its former trenches.</p>

  <p>The net result of the operations was the repulse of the Turks and the
  infliction upon them of very heavy losses. At first we had them fairly on the
  run, and had it not been for those inventions of the devil&mdash;machine guns
  and barbed wire&mdash;which suit the Turkish character and tactics to
  perfection, we should not have stopped short of the crest of Achi Baba. As it
  was, all brigades reported great numbers of dead Turks in front of their
  lines, and 350 prisoners were left in our hands.</p>

  <p>On the 2nd, during the day, the enemy remained quiet, burying his dead
  under a red crescent flag, a work with which we did not interfere. Shortly
  after 9 p.m., however, they made another attack against the whole Allied
  line, their chief effort being made against the French front, where the
  ground favoured their approach. The attack was repulsed with loss.</p>

  <p>During the night 3rd-4th the French front was again subjected to a heavy
  attack, which they were able to repulse without assistance from my general
  reserve.</p>

  <p>The day of the 4th was spent in reorganisation, and a portion of the line
  held by the French, who had lost heavily during the previous night's
  fighting, was taken over by the 2nd Naval Brigade. The night passed
  quietly.</p>

  <p>During the 5th the Lancashire Fusilier Brigade of the East Lancashire
  Division was disembarked and placed in reserve behind the British left.</p>

  <p>Orders were issued for an advance to be carried out next day, and these
  and the three days' battle which ensued will be dealt with in my next
  despatch.</p>

  <p>The losses, exclusive of the French, during the period covered by this
  despatch, were, I regret to say, very severe, numbering:&mdash;</p>

  <p>177 Officers and 1,990 other ranks killed.</p>

  <p>412 Officers and 7,807 other ranks wounded.</p>

  <p>13 Officers and 3,580 other ranks missing.</p>

  <p>From a technical point of view it is interesting to note that my
  Administrative Staff had not reached Mudros by the time when the landings
  were finally arranged. All the highly elaborate work involved by these
  landings was put through by my General Staff working in collaboration with
  Commodore Roger Kayes, C.B., M.V.O., and the Naval Transport Officers
  allotted for the purpose by Vice-Admiral de Robeck. Navy and Army carried out
  these combined duties with that perfect harmony which was indeed absolutely
  essential to success.</p>

  <p>Throughout the events I have chronicled the Royal Navy has been father and
  mother to the Army. Not one of us but realises how much he owes to
  Vice-Admiral de Robeck; to the warships, French and British; to the
  destroyers, mine sweepers, picket boats, and to all their dauntless crews,
  who took no thought of themselves, but risked everything to give their
  soldier comrades a fair run in at the enemy.</p>

  <p>Throughout these preparations and operations Monsieur le Général d'Amade
  has given me the benefit of his wide experiences of war, and has afforded me,
  always, the most loyal and energetic support. The landing of Kum Kale planned
  by me as a mere diversion to distract the attention of the enemy, was
  transformed by the Commander of the Corps Expéditionnaire de l'Orient into a
  brilliant operation, which secured some substantial results. During the
  fighting which followed the landing of the French Division at Sedd-el-Bahr no
  troops could have acquitted themselves more creditably under very trying
  circumstances, and under very heavy losses, than those working under the
  orders of Monsieur le Général d'Amade.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant-General Sir W. R. Birdwood, K.C.S.I., C.B., C.I.E., D.S.O., was
  in command of the detached landing of the Australian and New Zealand Army
  Corps above Kaba Tepe, as well as during the subsequent fighting. The fact of
  his having been responsible for the execution of these difficult and
  hazardous operations&mdash;operations which were crowned with a very
  remarkable success&mdash; speaks, I think, for itself.</p>

  <p>Major-General A. G. Hunter-Weston, C.B., D.S.O., was tried very highly,
  not only during the landings, but more especially in the day and night
  attacks and counter-attacks which ensued. Untiring, resourceful, and ever
  more cheerful as the outlook (on occasion) grew darker, he possesses, in my
  opinion, very special qualifications as a Commander of troops in the
  field.</p>

  <p>Major-General W. P. Braithwaite, C.B., is the best Chief of the General
  Staff it has ever been my fortune to encounter in war. I will not pile
  epithets upon him. I can say no more than what I have said, and I can
  certainly say no less.</p>

  <p>I have many other names to bring to notice for the period under review,
  and these will form the subject of a separate report at an early date.</p>

  <p>I have the honour to be Your Lordship's most obedient Servant,</p>

  <p>Ian Hamilton, General, Commanding Mediterranean Expeditionary Force.</p>
