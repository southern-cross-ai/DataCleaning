  <h2><a id="note"
     name="note"></a>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h2>

  <p class="intro">In his book <i>Edgar Wallace&mdash;Each Way</i> (John Long,
  London, 1932) the author's secretary Robert Curtis notes that Wallace used
  only one pseudonym &mdash; "Richard Cloud" &mdash; in the course of his long
  literary career. According to Curtis, the only story printed under this name
  was "Broken Hearts," a tale that was novelised in 1925 as <i>Blue Hand</i>.
  However, the present article justifies the assumption that Wallace also used
  this <i>nom de plume</i> in Part 6 of the 12-part pulp series <i>The Great
  Stories of Real Life</i> published by George Newnes in the mid-1920's. This
  assumption is based on the fact that, in addition to "The Great Bank of
  England Frauds" (attributed to "Richard Cloud"), Part 6 of the series
  includes an article attributed to Edgar Wallace and published under the title
  "The Trial of the Seddons." From this it appears that, on this occasion, the
  pseudonym was used to avoid listing Wallace as the author of two of the five
  articles comprising this issue of <i>The Great Stories of Real Life</i>.
  Interested readers will find a bibliographic description of Parts 1 to 6 of
  the series at <a href="http://ci.nii.ac.jp/ncid/BA68263402?l=en">CiNii
  Books."</a></p>

  <p class="intro">In addition to the original article about this <i>cause
  célèbre</i>, this PGA/RGL Special includes a complete transcript of the trial
  of the four men who succeeded in defrauding the Bank of England.

  <h2><a id="art"
     name="art"></a>THE GREAT BANK OF ENGLAND FRAUDS</h2>

  <p class="blurb"><i>THE Bank of England, considered impregnable against the
  cunning attack of the cleverest criminals, received a great fright when it
  was discovered that George and Austin Bidwell had stolen a quarter of a
  million pounds by forgery. Only a foolish slip on the part of the forgers
  brought their audacious crime to light, and up to then their gains had been
  at the rate of £10,000 a day.</i></p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">IN the United States of America there is no exact equivalent
  to the organisation of Scotland Yard. The state and city police forces have
  their detectives and plain-clothes officers, the Federal Government has a
  special force attached to the Ministry of Justice, but the coordination
  represented by Scotland Yard is not known, and the real detective forces in
  America are those controlled by William Burns and by the Pinkertons, of which
  the Pinkerton firm is perhaps the most famous, although at the present moment
  William Burns occupies an official position at Washington.</p>

  <p>The firm of Pinkerton grew from small beginnings. In 1848 the founder of
  the firm was a sheriff in Chicago, having been invited to that position
  through his success in dealing with counterfeiters, and thereafter the
  Pinkertons had some sort of official recognition, being engaged, amongst
  other things, to protect President Lincoln in the stormy days preceding the
  War of Independence.</p>

  <p>In 1884 the business of Pinkerton came into the hands of Robert and his
  brother William. By this time there was a Pinkerton office in every State in
  America, for the firm dealt only with real crimes, such matters as engage the
  attention of private detectives in England&mdash;divorce cases, watching
  suspected persons, etc.&mdash;being refused.</p>

  <p>Amongst other duties they were engaged to protect banks. Most of the
  important banks of America were under their care in 1914.</p>

  <p>In 1872 William Pinkerton traced a bank robber to the East End of London.
  There were some difficulties of extradition on the evidence that William
  possessed, and whilst he was waiting to secure fresh affidavits from the
  United States, his man disappeared, to be recaptured afterwards.</p>

  <p>One day William, in company with Inspector Shaw of Scotland Yard, was
  walking along the Strand, their minds more occupied with recreation than with
  business. On their way they called in at a tailor's shop, where certain notes
  had been changed which Pinkerton was able to identify with money that had
  been stolen in America. The inquiry proceeded upon the usual lines, and they
  were just about to leave the tailor's shop when two men walked in. They were
  strangers to Shaw, but not altogether strangers to Pinkerton, who turned his
  face so that he might not be recognised, but watched them through a
  convenient mirror. When they had gone out of the shop, Pinkerton caught Shaw
  by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Did you see those two men who came in?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Shaw had noticed them casually.</p>

  <p>"Who are they?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"That was Macdonnel and Bidwell. They are two of the most notorious bank
  forgers in the United States, and I hadn't the slightest idea that they were
  in England. I can only tell you, from my knowledge of these gentlemen, that
  they are not in London on pleasure. Bidwell is about as bad a scoundrel as
  you could meet anywhere; and Macdonnel can give all your crooks a start and a
  beating! Come along, we'll follow them."</p>

  <h2>§ 1</h2>

  <p class="first">THEY turned out of the shop into the Strand, and, keeping
  the two men in sight, trailed them home. To Pinkerton this little chase was
  the merest side line; a busman's holiday, for he had no charge against either
  Bidwell or the other man, and his chief interest was to discover whether
  these two were in communication with the man he was after, and who were
  engaged, if not exactly in the same kind of business, at least in one which
  bore a strong family likeness to bank frauds.</p>

  <p>In those days all banks suffered in some degree from the activities of
  minor swindlers; but there had been nothing in the nature of a big haul made
  from any of the joint stock establishments, and except for the occasional
  forgeries on the Bank of England with which the police had to deal, that
  sedate establishment was practically immune from the activities of
  wrongdoers. So free, indeed, that a sense of false security had grown up in
  Threadneedle Street, and the possibility of clever minds getting behind the
  very careful system of book-keeping involved was pooh-poohed. So Shaw told
  Pinkerton.</p>

  <p>"Let them pooh-pooh as much as they like," said Pinkerton earnestly, "but
  I tell you that these two men could take money out of the Bank of England
  very easily indeed. It's no business of mine, but I warn you that in
  Macdonnel and Bidwell you have two really dangerous and clever men."</p>

  <p>Shaw was impressed, and since there was an excellent working arrangement
  between Pinkerton's and Scotland Yard, he induced the head of the great
  American detective agency to send to America for the photographs of these two
  rogues, in order that they might be circulated in the higher branches of
  Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>With these facts in their possession, Scotland Yard circularised all the
  banks in the country, warning them of the activities of the two men, and
  received a very cold acknowledgment of their warning.</p>

  <p>Now, Austin Byron Bidwell was something more than an ordinary bank robber.
  In addition to his record as a forger, he had established communication with
  several criminal organisations, not least of which was the New York bank
  detective ring, which was supposed to protect the banks, but in reality
  received a very large percentage of the proceeds of every robbery. Bidwell
  knew that, if the worst came to the worst, he could find safety in America,
  providing he was ready to cut up his share of the robbery with the chiefs of
  the New York detective force. And with this comforting knowledge, he and
  Macdonnel set about their preparations for engineering the fraud which was to
  rob the Bank of England of £200,000. They were aided by Austin's brother,
  George, and an accomplice named Noyes.</p>

  <p>The four had been two years in Europe, and by means of forged letters of
  credit had succeeded in amassing a very considerable sum. They operated in
  Berlin, in Marseilles, Dresden, Bordeaux and Lyons, and as soon as the
  continent of Europe grew a little too hot for them, they crossed to South
  America till the hue and cry had died down, and then came over to England in
  the spring of 1872. Macdonnel took lodgings at a house in Piccadilly, and the
  three men began to organise their fraud.</p>

  <p>It is perhaps unnecessary to explain that bill-discounting is one of the
  commonplace functions of every banking system. Bills of exchange are
  constantly bought and sold as though they were stocks and shares that would
  mature on a certain date. Bills are given by the highest financial houses.
  The Rothschilds, for example, would give bills at a month or three months as
  readily as they would give cheques.</p>

  <p>That is to say, if I purchase a thousand pounds' worth of machinery from a
  firm and give a bill, which is in reality a postdated cheque, undertaking
  that the money shall be paid on a stipulated date, say in two months' time,
  the man to whom I give that bill hands it to his bank, which discounts it,
  allowing him the thousand pounds, less a percentage, and placing the the
  money immediately to his credit. All the great financial houses, as well as
  the great commercial houses, give bills, just as they receive bills, in
  payment for various services.</p>

        title="Illustration">

  <p>Austin Bidwell began operations by opening a <i>bona fide</i> credit at
  the Burlington Gardens branch of the Bank of England, whilst his two
  confederates went out into the provinces to secure genuine bills. It was
  quite a simple matter to secure bills drawn by well-known financial houses,
  and since Bidwell informed the bank that he was in England with the object of
  opening a Pullman- car manufactory in the region of Birmingham, and that his
  financial transactions would be large, no extraordinary precaution was taken
  in regard to him, although the authorities of the bank had in their
  possession a very full description of himself and his companions and a copy
  of their photographs!</p>

  <p>Bidwell paid in a genuine bill of Rothschilds for £4,500, which was duly
  discounted and placed to his credit. Other genuine bills followed; and then
  there began to flow into Old Burlington Street a stream of forged
  acceptances.</p>

  <p>Now, the difference between an ordinary bill of exchange and that bill of
  exchange which we call a cheque, is that, in the case of a cheque, the
  document is returned to its drawer within a day or so, when he or his clerk
  can discover immediately if the cheque is forged or if there are any
  irregularities in the business. But a bill of exchange may be two or three
  months before it is presented for payment to the drawer. And since Bidwell
  was apparently a man of some standing, and the acceptances that came in were
  from people of well-known financial stability, no questions were asked, the
  bills were discounted, and large sums were placed to the credit of the
  forger.</p>

  <p>No sooner was the money in the bank than Bidwell, who operated in the name
  of Warren, drew cheques in favour of one Horton, who had an account in the
  Continental Bank. Horton was, of course, himself. No sooner was the money in
  the Continental Bank than it was drawn out, the notes exchanged for gold, the
  gold again exchanged for notes at the Threadneedle Branch of the Bank of
  England, and these put away handy against the day when the first of the
  fraudulent bills matured, and when it would be necessary for these men to
  make a quick getaway.</p>

  <p>Before the first forged bill should fall due, the conspirators had laid
  their plans to be clear of the country and in safe hiding.</p>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">APPARENTLY the authorities at the Bank of England had no
  idea that there was anything wrong about the account. Money was coming in in
  large quantities, in a form which was perfectly normal, and was being paid
  out almost as quickly as it came in, but that was a very ordinary state of
  affairs, met with in every banking business.</p>

  <p>And then the forgers committed one of those extraordinary pieces of folly
  which, for some reason difficult to fathom, are exhibited in almost every
  cleverly arranged plan of criminality. In two of the forged acceptances, of
  the supposed to have been drawn by the firm of Rothschilds, they omitted to
  put the date.</p>

  <p>The manager of the Bank of England sent the bills to Rothschilds, asking
  them to be good enough to insert the date, and thinking its omission was
  merely an oversight. The forgeries were at once detected, and Noyes, who was
  better known to the manager than any other of the gang, was immediately
  arrested.</p>

  <p>As soon as the news came to Scotland Yard of the forgery, Inspector Shaw
  went up in a cab to the Bank, carrying with him the photographs of the two
  men, and Austin Bidwell's was instantly recognised by the manager.</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"
     name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><img src=
     "1400111h-images/BankOfEngland-03.gif"
        style="float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>The gang worked under the cover of a small crowd of five; and no sooner
  was Noyes in the hands of the police than Bidwell was informed of his peril.
  The gang had already made a rough division of the spoils. All was in
  readiness, day and night, for a quick departure; suitcases packed, railway
  and steamship tickets purchased under different aliases; and within a few
  hours of the discovery, and long before the police officers watching the
  various ports could be notified, Austin Bidwell fled to Paris to meet the
  girl with whom he was in love, and to whom he was married before he set forth
  on his disastrous honeymoon trip. George Bidwell was arrested in
  Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the police were combing London for the others. Macdonnel
  was the most elusive and most difficult to find. He had appeared in only one
  or two of the transactions; his place of residence was unknown, though Shaw
  had an idea that it was at this man's house that the forgeries were
  perpetrated&mdash;a surmise which proved to be well founded.</p>

  <p>The extent of the defalcations was not yet known to the terrified bank
  officials. Their first impression was that they had been swindled to the
  extent of a million pounds, and the wildest rumours circulated through the
  City of London as to the bank's stability. It complicated matters
  considerably that, amongst the forged acceptances, there were a number of
  genuine bills.</p>

  <p>A further complication was to be found in the fact that banks not only
  discount bills, but resell them&mdash;in other words, have them re-discounted
  by other banks. Many of the acceptances which had been placed to Warren's
  credit were scattered all over the country in the various banking
  institutions, and the amount of the bank's loss remained problematical for a
  very considerable time. The exact amount stolen is believed to have been some
  £200,000, half of which, however, was subsequently recovered.</p>

  <p>The Bank of England might, indeed, have avoided the loss of a penny but
  for the blatant dishonesty of the bank police of New York.</p>

  <p>That the thieves should have omitted to put the date into two of the
  forged bills is inexplicable; but a more extraordinary act of folly was to
  follow.</p>

  <h3>§3</h3>

  <p class="first">PINKERTON'S had been immediately notified, and William
  Pinkerton, who was in New York, got at once into touch with the Paris police,
  guessing that Austin Bidwell and Macdonnel would double back to the
  Continent. From the inquiries of the French police officers, aided by
  Pinkerton's own agents in Paris, it was discovered that a man answering
  Bidwell's description had been married and had left almost immediately on a
  ship sailing for Vera Cruz.</p>

  <p>Pinkerton's made a few inquiries, and discovered that the ship would
  probably call at Havana, and William Pinkerton, who had only just landed in
  New York, was dispatched with all haste to intercept the steamer.</p>

  <p>Unconscious of the extraordinary activity of the London and American
  police, Bidwell watched the approaching shore of Havana with a sense of
  satisfaction that he had shaken off pursuit, and that ahead of him, in the
  semi-tropical climate of South America, were many years during which he might
  enjoy the fruits of his nefarious practices. The police would be looking for
  a single man, he argued, or two men; they would not identify, in one of this
  happy honeymoon couple, the notorious Austin Bidwell who was wanted for
  forgery.</p>

  <p>He was in his cabin when the pilot boat came out, and he did not see the
  hateful figure of the detective as he climbed up on to the deck; but a few
  minutes later there came a tap at the door, which opened to reveal the man he
  knew only too well.</p>

  <p>"I want you, Bidwell," said Pinkerton, "for conspiring to rob the Bank of
  England of a million dollars."</p>

  <p>The frightened girl-wife, ignorant of her husband's character, clung to
  him in fear and anguish. In another minute Austin Bidwell was handcuffed and
  was being marched up to the deck and to the waiting police boat.</p>

  <p>Handing his prisoner over to his men, Pinkerton went back to the cabin and
  instituted a thorough search. To his amazement, beyond a few hundred pounds
  which the man had in his possession, there was no sign of the stolen
  property. Dumbfounded, the police chief went back to his prisoner and
  questioned him. Austin Bidwell only smiled triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"Say," he drawled, "what sort of a bank robber am I? If I'd taken that
  money, wouldn't I have it with me? Do you think I'd trust anybody else?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"
     name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1400111h-images/BankOfEngland-04.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>This was a facer for Pinkerton, but whether the man had money or not, he
  was wanted by the English police and, taken ashore, was lodged in jail.</p>

  <p>But where was the money? Pinkerton went back to the ship, had the hold
  cleared of all baggage belonging to the prisoner, and this was carefully
  examined, without, however, discovering a single dollar.</p>

  <p>And then an idea occurred to the detective. Bidwell would know that he was
  calling at Havana, and that he would be there long enough to enable him to go
  ashore and collect any letters which might be waiting for him at the post
  office. What would be easier than for him to have posted on the money in
  advance? And with this idea firmly fixed in his mind, Pinkerton went to the
  post office, to find his judgment vindicated, for there were a number of
  packages and letters waiting for Bidwell in his assumed name, and amongst
  these was a considerable sum of money in American bonds, and letters, one of
  which was from George Bidwell, the brother of the forger, who had been
  operating for the gang in Ireland, and had been arrested and escaped from
  prison. Incidentally, this letter told the police the hiding-place of yet
  another package of bonds, which were eventually recovered.</p>

  <p>So far as Bidwell was concerned, the chase seemed at an end; but within
  two or three days of his confinement in the Havana prison, an amazing thing
  happened. One morning, as he was being marched from one part of the prison to
  another, he eluded his guards and, leaping through an open window, fell two
  stories into the crowded street below. He miraculously escaped hurt, and,
  scrambling to his feet before the astonished passers-by could realise what
  had happened, he had made his escape!</p>

  <p>That is the baldest narrative of an escape which was probably much better
  planned than is believed. Bidwell, who knew the corrupt Colonial Spanish, and
  had a smattering of the language, had probably succeeded in bribing his
  guards&mdash;by no means a difficult proposition to a man of his
  plausibility; the more so, since it is certain that he was supplied with
  money from some outside source.</p>

  <p>Pinkerton was in his hotel when the news came to him of the prisoner's
  escape, and he rushed to the jail, to find that the story was only too
  true.</p>

  <p>But with that dogged determination which was a characteristic of his
  family,he went out to trail down his man.</p>

  <p>The island of Havana was roughly searched from end to end, and it soon
  became apparent to the detective that, impossible as it might seem, Bidwell
  had not only escaped from the jail, but was clear of the island.</p>

  <p>Pinkerton refused, in the first place, to accept this latter theory, most
  industriously urged by the local police officials. He argued that Bidwell
  would be so knocked about by his leap that, though he might have got out of
  Havana, he could not have got away to sea. Every boat had been searched, the
  coastguards were patrolling the beaches; and when, a few days later, there
  came a report of a strange white man wandering on the seashore, Pinkerton
  made his way to that part of the coast and rearrested the prisoner, this time
  beyond all hope of getting away.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the third chief member of the gang was engaged in an
  adventure of an even more exciting character. When the warning came, and he
  knew that Bidwell had got away to Paris, he, proceeding with more leisure,
  stopped to make away with the evidence of his guilt which, as Inspector Shaw
  had guessed, was to be found in his lodgings. Nobody, however, had associated
  Macdonnel with the quiet house in Piccadilly. To his landlady he was a well-
  behaved man of pleasant demeanour, who spent a great deal of his time in his
  room, working, as he had informed her, "on important documents." She thought
  he was a lawyer's clerk employed to engross important documents, and did not
  dream that she harboured under her roof one of the most brilliant forgers
  whom the world has ever known.</p>

  <p>Macdonnel packed without haste, destroyed all the instruments of his
  craft, and then, when he was ready to go, committed the crowning folly to
  which I have already made reference. He sat down to write letters to some of
  his acquaintances -and used a clean piece of blotting-paper to dry the ink on
  his letters!</p>

  <p>This done, he left the house in a hurry, without taking the trouble to
  inform his unsuspicious landlady or even to pay her bill. Had he destroyed
  the blotting-paper, had he even taken the trouble to settle his account, and
  to offer some excuse for being called away into the country, he would in all
  probability have escaped detection.</p>

  <p>The landlady was puzzled by his hurried departure, made an inspection of
  the room, and saw that he had taken with him all his worldly possessions, and
  was alarmed to realise that she had been bilked. In a sense of resentment
  against her lodger, she sat down after tea to read the evening newspaper, and
  there read the account of Noyes's arrest and a fairly garbled story of the
  extensive frauds which had been practised on the bank so successfully. Again
  she went up into Macdonnel's room, but this time she instituted a search; and
  one of the first things she found was the clean piece of blotting-paper
  bearing the marks of Macdonnel's correspondence. She held it up to the
  mirror, and what she read confirmed her suspicions. Taking the piece of
  blotting-paper, she put on her cloak and went out to interview the
  police.</p>

  <p>Shaw, who was summoned just as soon as he heard of the arrival of this
  important witness, saw the blotting-paper, and realised that the mysterious
  lodger was Macdonnel. The blotting-paper told the police much more than
  Macdonnel could guess, for there appeared a word which was deciphered later
  as the name of a ship, the <i>Thuringia</i>.</p>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">MACDONNEL left Piccadilly, drove by cab to Euston, and took
  train for Liverpool. He arrived on the Mersey that night, and without delay
  caught another train, which brought him early the following afternoon to
  Southampton. He had to zigzag his way across England and Wales to accomplish
  this feat, but he was successful in so far as he was able to catch a boat for
  Havre and reach the <i>Thuringia</i> before Scotland Yard could communicate
  with its captain. In these days of wireless it is a simple matter to keep
  track of every ship on the ocean, but before radiography was discovered a
  ship was out of touch the moment it sailed from port.</p>

  <p>Macdonnel had no illusions about the genius either of the English police
  or their American comrades. He knew that by sailing to New York, as he was,
  he was running his head into the lion's mouth; but in preparation for such a
  hasty exit he had been in communication with the captain of the bank
  detectives of New York, and the plan he had made was one which was calculated
  to baffle the cleverest of police organisations.</p>

  <p>The bank ring lived on the contributions of criminals. Ostensibly existing
  to protect banking institutions from the depredations of thieves, it filled
  in reality a position analogous to that occupied by Jonathan Wild in the
  darkest days of English jurisprudence. Captain Irving, the chief of the
  police, was on the friendliest terms with Macdonnel, with whom he had
  probably shared a considerable amount of plunder in the past. And Macdonnel's
  scheme was simplicity itself. In the letter he wrote to New York he hinted at
  a big coup that was being worked, which might necessitate a hurried visit to
  New York. If the police were after him&mdash;that is to say, if Captain
  Irving knew that the police were after him&mdash;it was arranged that
  Irving's men should go down to the ship, arrest him, and confiscate the
  plunder, which was to be divided when Macdonnel was surreptitiously released
  from prison. The New York bank police were then to report that, although they
  had arrested the prisoner, no money had been found in his possession, and
  Macdonnel thought that the fact that he had been arrested in a penniless
  state would be quite enough to induce the English police to give up any sort
  of attempt to arrest him; more especially as by now, he guessed, they would
  have caught one or other of his companions.</p>

  <p>Whilst we must give a large measure of credit to the foresight and
  ingenuity of the police forces, it is certain that Noyes, who regarded
  himself as something of a victim, and was already under arrest, had given a
  considerable amount of information to Inspector Shaw&mdash;information which
  was largely responsible for the eventual capture of Bidwell.</p>

  <p>With the knowledge that Macdonnel was sailing on the <i>Thuringia</i>, the
  work of the English police was simplified. A detective officer went to Havre
  and verified the story that a man answering Macdonnel's description had come
  on board at the last minute in another name than his own. This news was sent
  to London, and Shaw telegraphed to Pinkerton to arrest Macdonnel and bring
  him back to England for trial.</p>

  <p>The bank frauds were now public property, not only in Europe but in the
  United States. The newspapers were filled with stories of the three men who
  had successfully robbed the greatest banking concern in the world of a
  million dollars, and the news that Macdonnel was on the <i>Thuringia</i>, if
  it was not public property, was known, amongst others, to Captain Irving.</p>

  <p>The plan of operations was as follows: Irving and his lieutenant were to
  board the <i>Thuringia</i> outside Sandy Hook; the lieutenant was to arrest
  their prisoner, at the same time covering from observation the transfer of
  the money which Macdonnel had in his possession, and which would be
  transferred at the moment of arrest to the police chief.</p>

  <p><a id="pic6"

        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>There is very little honour amongst thieves, and certainly Macdonnel had
  some doubt in his mind as to how the loot would eventually be divided when he
  was let out of prison. He therefore divided the money he carried into two
  portions: eighty-three thousand dollars (some £17,000) he kept in his pocket,
  and the remainder, some £25,000, he put in the false bottom of the trunk,
  which was addressed for delivery to his sister. With these preparations made,
  he waited with equanimity for the ship to sight Fire Island, having in his
  mind a conviction, amounting to a certainty, that his presence on the ship
  was known, and that he would be in the hands of the police as soon as the
  vessel passed Sandy Hook.</p>

  <p>Now, Pinkerton's had been notified of his presence on the
  <i>Thuringia</i>; and Pinkerton's had no illusions about the probity of the
  bank police. It was a point of honour and a point of pride with this American
  organisation that all their dealings should be marked by absolute honesty;
  and they were determined that the plan between Irving and Macdonnel should be
  frustrated. Through their extraordinary system of intelligence they became
  aware of the pretty little plot that had been hatched; and as the day grew
  nearer when the <i>Thuringia</i> was due to arrive, the chief of the
  Pinkerton Service made his plans to upset the scheme of the conspirators.</p>

  <p>A few hours before the <i>Thuringia</i> was due at Sandy Hook, a party of
  Pinkerton's men went into a tug that had been specially chartered, and stole
  away towards the open sea. The police boat was then lying in New York
  Harbour, but before Pinkerton's had proceeded far, the news was flashed to
  the head of the bank police that Pinkerton's were on the warpath, and within
  an hour the police boat was steaming at full speed towards Sandy Hook.</p>

  <p><a id="pic7"

        style="float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>They came up with the Pinkerton boat, which had anchored for the night,
  and dropped their anchor parallel to their rivals. Early in the morning, a
  faint light appeared at sea. It was the <i>Thuringia</i>, and the moment the
  watch reported having sighted the ship, the Pinkerton boat dashed out to meet
  it.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously the police boat got on the move, and there began a race for
  the ship, for the prize of £40,000!</p>

  <p>The boats ran level for a long time, and then the police boat began to
  forge slowly ahead, despite the frantic efforts of Pinkerton's engineer. They
  gained a minute&mdash;just long enough to enable the police boat to draw
  alongside of the <i>Thuringia</i>, and the chief and his lieutenant scrambled
  aboard. By arrangement, Macdonnel was waiting on the deck to receive them. In
  a minute, before the Pinkerton man could dash on to the deck, the transfer of
  the bonds had been made, and Macdonnel was a prisoner in the hands of the
  bank ring!</p>

  <p>It was a bitter pill for Pinkerton's to swallow, the more so since they
  knew that not only had they lost the money, which they had pledged themselves
  to restore to the Bank of England, but because they had lost their man; for
  they did not doubt that, on some pretext or other, Macdonnel would either be
  released, or else would be allowed to escape through some conveniently open
  door, and the escape suppressed until the man was beyond reach'of Pinkerton's
  bloodhounds.</p>

  <p>Macdonnel was taken ashore and lodged in jail.</p>

  <p>"A few days and we'll have you out again," whispered one of the corrupt
  police officers as he was bundled into his cell.</p>

  <p>And, never doubting, Macdonnel settled himself down to wait, with whatever
  patience he could summon, for the welcome release. But that release never
  came. The sum was too small a one for Irving to divide. He may have thought
  that Macdonnel was double-crossing him, and in this he would not have been
  far wrong. But what is more probable is that the Pinkertonian energy had
  communicated itself to Washington, and the story of the cunning escape had
  been notified to executive headquarters, with the result that the Federal
  authorities made it impossible for the forger to get away according to
  plan.</p>

  <p>Slowly, as the days passed and he saw the proceedings for extradition
  taking shape, it began to dawn upon Macdonnel that he had been
  double-crossed. And then came news of a crowning misfortune, which blotted
  out all hopes of escape with the aid of an infuriated Irving. Pinkerton's had
  trailed the trunk addressed to Macdonnel's sister, had taken and opened it,
  and had discovered the $125,000 which Macdonnel had so carefully hidden.</p>

  <p>Irving was furious; making no disguise of the part he had played, he
  accused the prisoner of double-crossing him, and from that moment Macdonnel's
  fate was sealed. In the custody of Pinkerton officers he was brought back to
  England. Bidwell had already arrived; and there began a trial which ended in
  all the conspirators being sentenced to penal servitude for life. George
  Bidwell was released after serving fourteen years; Austin Bidwell served
  nineteen before obtaining his freedom. In the days of their prosperity the
  brothers had spent thousands in mere extravagances. Both of them died in the
  most miserable poverty.</p>

  <p>The Bidwells and Macdonnel were perhaps the only criminals who have
  succeeded in defrauding a bank to any great extent without the assistance of
  some confederate within the bank itself. Their success was all the more
  remarkable in view of the fact that they were practically unknown to the bank
  authorities, and possessed of no credentials which would inspire the
  confidence of a great banking house.</p>
