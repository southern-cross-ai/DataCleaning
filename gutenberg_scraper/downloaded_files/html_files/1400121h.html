  <p class="blurb"><i>THE crime of Herbert Armstrong, M.A., the Welsh
  solicitor, who murdered his wife by administering arsenic, was especially
  mean and contemptible. Love affairs entangled his life and flattered his
  vanity, and it is probable that a hatred of his dull and respectable
  existence in a tiny village was one of the motives for his terrible deed.
  This story of Armstrong is told by Mr. Edgar Wallace, who attended the trial,
  and on behalf of a newspaper syndicate offered the convicted man £5,000 for
  his confession&mdash;an offer which was refused.</i></p>

  <br>

  <p class="first">THE little village of Cusop, on the borders of Herefordshire
  and Wales, is not graced by any very distinguished or beautiful buildings,
  nor hereabouts is the stately lodge entrance of any great country house.
  Indeed, one of the best of the houses in the village (and this would have
  been pointed out to you in the year 1920) is a somewhat plain dwelling known
  as "Mayfield." It is such a residence as you might expect a country gentleman
  of very limited income would occupy. It had its garden, its pleasant
  approaches, and, within the somewhat cramped space of "Mayfield," the
  apartments were more or less ordinary. There was a drawing-room and a boudoir
  for the lady of the house, a small room designated "the study," where the
  master might bring his work home in the evening and pursue his investigations
  into the troubles of his neighbours, without too great an interference by the
  noise of the piano which his wife loved to strum.</p>

  <p>Herbert Rowse Armstrong was a solicitor, and the war, which had drawn this
  quiet, inoffensive-looking Little man into the service of the Army, at the
  Armistice delivered him back to the admiring village, and to his colleagues
  of Hay, a fully-fledged Major, a rank he was loth to renounce. There are
  photographs extant, and they were at the moment highly prized by their
  grateful recipients, showing the Major mounted on a horse, a fine figure of a
  soldier, and finer since his equestrian exercises did not betray his lack of
  inches.</p>

  <p>Major Armstrong had come to the village of Hay from Devonshire, where, at
  Newton Abbot, he had practised his profession, without securing for himself
  that success for which his many qualifications seemed to fit him; for he was
  a Master of Arts of the University of Cambridge, something of an authority
  upon land tenure. And when, having married a wife, he transferred himself to
  a new sphere of operations, it did not appear likely that the little village
  of Hay, off the main track, away from railway and arterial roads, would give
  him greater opportunities of achieving success than he had enjoyed in the
  more populous district of Newton Abbot.</p>

  <p>There was in Hay at the time an elderly solicitor, whose partner Armstrong
  became. The elderly solicitor had an elderly wife, and it is a curious fact
  that, as soon as Armstrong had settled himself down and learnt the ropes of
  the business, and had become acquainted with the country gentry, his elderly
  partner should have died with strange suddenness, to be followed in a few
  days by his wife. The prosecution did not, at the trial which followed,
  attempt to establish Armstrong's responsibility for the death of his partner.
  There were very many reasons why the Crown should concentrate upon the
  charges which were eventually made against him, without risking the negative
  result which might follow an attempt to prove further crimes against this
  remarkable man.</p>

  <p>Armstrong became a personage of some local importance when he was
  appointed Clerk to the Justices of Hay, and in this capacity he sat beneath
  the bench, advising them on points of law, a kindly yet efficient man,
  somewhat severe on poachers and on those who broke the law in a minor degree.
  As a solicitor, he appeared from time to time at the various assize courts.
  The queer little court- house at Hereford knew him; he had sat at the
  horseshoe-shaped table before judges and had instructed counsel, and,
  generally speaking, performed the duties peculiar to his profession with
  judgment and skill.</p>

  <p>In appearance he was a short but perfectly proportioned man. He had a
  small, round head, covered with close-cropped, mouse-coloured hair, was small
  of hand and foot, and had a countenance which was at once benignant and
  shrewd. His eyes were blue, set deeply in his head and rather close together.
  The overhanging brows were shaggy, and his prognathic jaw was hidden by a
  heavy moustache.</p>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">HERBERT ARMSTRONG was well-liked and trusted by everybody
  with whom he was brought into contact. Cambridge University had given him a
  finish which made him an acceptable guest at the country houses in the
  neighbourhood, and although, by reason of his being a stranger, he had the
  administration of no great family fortune, he nevertheless built up with some
  rapidity a practice which put him in a position of trust. On behalf of his
  clients he bought, sold and negotiated for land, had a finger in many sales
  and local flotations, and was looked upon, not only as a safe man, but as a
  lawyer with a certain social distinction.</p>

  <p>His wife, Kathleen Mary, seems to have been of a somewhat finicking
  disposition. She had rigid views on social behaviour, exacted from her
  husband's friends the attention and courtesy which were her right, and
  exercised, if the truth be told, a mild form of domestic despotism which
  prohibited her husband smoking in the house except in his own room.</p>

  <p>She had her "afternoons," her select dinner parties, and the etiquette
  which governs a small village was rigorously enforced. A somewhat difficult
  woman, all the more so because she had a little money of her own, some
  £2,500, and in all probability refused to her husband those loans which, to
  men of his character, come so easy to negotiate.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, they were a happy family from the outsiders' point of view.
  There were three children of the marriage, and neighbours regarded the
  Armstrongs as united and good-living people. They were regular attendants at
  the village church; Mr. Armstrong, as he was in the early days, was seldom
  away from home until the call of war took him to a South Coast town and
  subsequently to France.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Armstrong was a little inclined to melancholia. She was a musician of
  exceptional ability, and would spend hours at her piano, but there was no
  suggestion that her despondency was caused by any act of her husband or by
  her knowledge of his misconduct.</p>

  <p>To Armstrong the war may have come in the nature of a pleasant relief. It
  took him from his restricted activities to a larger and wider world, pregnant
  with opportunity, to new faces, new interests, and, incidentally, to new
  ambitions.</p>

  <p>It was whilst he was quartered on the South Coast that he met a lady who
  was subsequently to play a sensational part in his life. Her name, well-known
  to the Press, has never been divulged publicly, and I do not purpose
  deviating from the very charitable attitude which the Press of the day
  adopted. It is no secret, however, that Madame X was a middle-aged lady
  possessed of much property, and with whom Armstrong became acquainted some
  time in 1918. He was an attentive friend, and there grew up between these two
  people a friendship, which seems to have been wholly innocent as far as the
  lady was concerned. She knew he had a wife "in delicate health," and she
  formed the impression that his marriage was an unhappy one.</p>

  <p>Armstrong's behaviour seems to have been perfectly proper, and the
  friendship, stimulated by exchanges of letters, developed into a tacit
  understanding that, if the "delicate health" of Armstrong's wife took a
  serious turn, the Major, after a decent interval, would appear to claim the
  fulfilment of a promise which was never actually asked and never given.</p>

  <p>Doubtless this little, middle-aged man, with his iron-grey moustache, was
  a dapper figure in uniform, well likely to raise a flutter in the heart of a
  lady who had passed her fortieth year. In course of time Armstrong was
  demobilised, came back to Hay, and plunged into arrears of work, taking up
  the threads from his assistant, and being welcomed on his first appearance as
  clerk to the Hay Justices, with many encomiums on his public spirit and
  courage.</p>

  <p>Whatever appearance he might make to those who did not probe too deeply
  beneath the surface, there is little doubt that Armstrong was something of a
  profligate in a mean and sordid way. It is not permissible to tell, at this
  early stage, the evidence which the police unearthed of his amours; but
  undoubtedly, in the argot of the village, he "carried on," though of this
  Mrs. Armstrong was ignorant, as also was an elderly lady who lived with the
  family, a Miss Emily Pearce, who was devoted equally to the husband and the
  wife, and kept a maternal eye upon the children.</p>

  <p>Miss Pearce seems to have been everything from housekeeper to nursery
  governess. She was the kind of family friend which is almost
  indistinguishable from an upper servant.</p>

  <p>Outside of his work, Armstrong had only one hobby, and that was gardening.
  Though he employed an odd gardener, he himself supervised the work, and
  helped mow the lawn, trim the rose bushes, and generally assisted in
  beautifying his limited estate. He made several purchases of weed-killer, and
  on two occasions had bought a quantity of arsenic, both in its commercial and
  its chemical form, for the purpose, as was claimed and as undoubtedly was the
  fact, of destroying the weeds which flourished exceedingly and had taken a
  new lease of life since his personal supervision had been removed by the war.
  There is no suggestion that the weed-killer was employed for any other
  purpose than that for which it was purchased. Armstrong attacked the enemies
  of his lawn with great vigour, and gradually brought his garden back to the
  state in which he had left it.</p>

  <p>He found something else on his return from the war. A new solicitor had
  established himself in Hay, and was taking a fair share of the work which
  country disputes and land conveyance provide. This Mr. Martin was married to
  a lady who was the daughter of the local chemist, and Armstrong must have
  known of his existence before he put his uniform on, but at any rate, when he
  did know, there was nothing unfriendly in his attitude. Indeed, he seemed
  anxious to do all that lay in his power to make the path of the new man as
  smooth as possible, and even went to the trouble of securing for him a
  commissionership of oaths. In this he was probably not altogether unselfish,
  for there was no commissioner of oaths nearer than Hereford, and it
  frequently happened that the remoteness of this official was an embarrassment
  to Armstrong himself.</p>

  <p>Whatever may have been his object (and it is not inconceivable, even in an
  innocent man, that he should have combined courtesy with profit), the Major
  was on the most friendly terms with his younger rival, and assisted him to
  the best of his ability whenever such assistance was needed. In course of
  time, as was natural, they represented opposing interests, one of which
  demanded from Armstrong the return of certain monies which had been paid to
  him on account of property in the sale of which he was interested.</p>

  <p>Long before this happened, Armstrong was faced with a domestic crisis. His
  wife had grown steadily more and more morose. Her interests had become more
  self-centred. She was infinitely harder to please than she had been, and
  exaggerated the most petty irritations into events of tremendous importance.
  Amongst other victims of her rigid code had been the unfortunate Mr. Martin,
  who had been guilty of the unpardonable solecism of appearing at one of her
  afternoon parties&mdash;in flannels! To call on Mrs. Armstrong in flannels
  was an offence beyond forgiveness. Martin was blacklisted, and became, from
  the poipt of view of this woman, whose mind was obviously a little deranged,
  a social outcast.</p>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p class="first">SO acute was the form her malady took that Armstrong
  consulted the family doctor, Dr. Hinks, and it was decided, after taking a
  second opinion, that this unfortunate lady should be transferred to a lunatic
  asylum in the neighbourhood "for observation." She was admitted and examined
  by the medical superintendent, who found her suffering from a mild form of
  peripheral neuritis. Since it was not a case of mania, and the symptoms were
  of a more or less elusive kind, she was given a certain measure of freedom,
  though the doctor at Barnwood Asylum, on the strength of certain delusions
  and incoherence of speech, had accepted her as insane.</p>

  <p>It was on September 22nd, 1920, that Mrs. Armstrong was admitted to this
  institution, where she remained for four months. During the period of her
  detention she wrote a number of very sane and clearly expressed letters to
  her husband, in which she begged him to bring her home for the sake of her
  children. There is little question that to Mrs. Armstrong the children were a
  first consideration.</p>

  <p>Armstrong paid several visits to Barnwood, and, finding her health had
  improved visibly, after Christmas he took steps to have her removed to his
  house. She returned on January 25th, 1921, so much improved in health that
  both Armstrong and the family doctor were delighted&mdash;at least, Armstrong
  "displayed a great deal of satisfaction."</p>

  <p>Evidently this development was not at all in accordance with Armstrong's
  expectations. Whether the sharp attack of illness which had left her with
  these delusions, that had subsequently brought her to Barnwood, was the
  result of poison, is a matter which can never be known with any certitude. In
  all probability the man had already begun his "experimenting." He had in his
  study a quarter of a pound of white arsenic, and one may assume that the
  first illness of Mrs. Armstrong was due to the administration of this deadly
  poison.</p>

  <p>With her return to "Mayfield," his plans underwent a change. She had made
  a will, leaving practically everything to himself, and revoking an earlier
  will which made such a distribution of her property that he would benefit to
  a very small extent. He was in some financial difficulty, but the determining
  factor in his action was Mrs. Armstrong's "difficulty." He was weary of her,
  her primness, her rigid sense of propriety, her faculty for making
  enemies.</p>

  <p>Herbert Armstrong, in short, had grown sick and tired of excessive
  respectability&mdash;and in his hatred of his cramped and too well-ordered
  life you may well find the primary motive for his terrible crime. It is
  extremely doubtful that the small sum of money, some £2,000, which would pass
  into his keeping on his wife's death, had anything to do with his
  determination to get rid of her. This is a view which may be contested; but,
  as one who followed the case very carefully from its beginning to its tragic
  finish, that is the conclusion I formed, and that, I believe, is also the
  view of eminent counsel engaged in the case on either side. His wife had
  become an incubus, a daily trial to him. He decided upon taking the step
  which was to lead him to the gallows.</p>

  <p>A week or so after her return from Barnwood, Mrs. Armstrong was taken
  violently ill following a meal. The family doctor was called in, and
  prescribed certain medicine. Mrs. Armstrong was put to bed, a nurse was
  engaged, and she made a fairly good recovery. There was no suspicion in the
  mind of the doctor that his patient was suffering from arsenical poisoning.
  He thought that it was a return of her old trouble, and treated her for
  peripheral neuritis, being strengthened in his diagnosis by the recovery
  which she made.</p>

  <p>She was hardly well before a second attack followed. Armstrong received
  from his magisterial colleagues the sympathy to which he was entitled, and
  one of his friends sent him up some bottles of champagne. This fact did not
  emerge at the trial, but it is possible that the agent through which Mrs.
  Armstrong received the dose of arsenic which ended fatally was champagne.
  Probably Armstrong himself opened the bottle and gave his wife a glass.
  Unfortunately, at the trial this point was never cleared up, by reason of the
  fact that there was not one of the principal witnesses for the Crown who
  could clearly remember who opened the bottle and who gave its contents to
  this wretched woman. And so there was no reference to champagne at all in the
  evidence which was taken at the Hereford Assize Court.</p>

  <p>This is a curious fact: that Armstrong was convicted without any proof
  being put in that he administered with his own hands, food or drink of any
  description whatsoever; and there were many, cognisant of all the facts, who
  believed that this would be a fatal bar to a conviction, and the foundation
  of the optimism which was shown by the defence is also to be found in this
  curious circumstance. Armstrong was eventually convicted, not because he was
  proved to have given his wife poison, but because he had accessibility and
  the opportunity for so administering it. But for the haziness of witness's
  memories, on this point, the conviction of the Major would have been a
  foregone conclusion.</p>

  <p>On the night before her death, when she was weak and exhausted as the
  result of arsenic administered to her a day or two days previously, Armstrong
  gave to his wife a glass of champagne in which he had dropped five or six
  grains of this tasteless and colourless alkaloid. She drank the wine, being
  refreshed by the draught, and although she was weak, talked sanely and
  rationally of her illness and of the house and its management. In the middle
  of the night Dr. Hinks was sent for, and arrived to find her <i>in
  extremis</i>. She died on the morning of February 22nd, 1921, and the doctor
  certified that she had succumbed to natural causes.</p>

  <p>The sympathy of the village and the countryside went out to this lonely
  man, left with three small children; the funeral was attended by every local
  notability, and the distress of the bereaved widower at the graveside was
  commented upon.</p>

  <p>Armstrong, in his quiet, self-repressive way, bore himself manfully.</p>

  <p>"In many ways I am glad that her sufferings are over," he told a friend.
  "The best and truest wife has gone to the Great Beyond, and I am left without
  a partner and without a friend."</p>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">HE caused a large tomb-stone to be erected over the grave,
  properly and tenderly inscribed, and it was placed in such a position that
  every Sunday morning, when he and his motherless children went up to the
  church, they passed the white stone. Through the summer and the autumn that
  followed, a tribute of flowers lay upon the sepulchre of the murdered woman.
  He himself took the choicest roses to adorn the grave.</p>

  <p>He was, he said, so run down by the tragedy that he sought leave of
  absence and went abroad, having communicatcd with Madame X that the trials of
  his sick wife were at a merciful end.</p>

  <p>Armstrong's itinerary was a curious one, for he not only visited Italy,
  but took a trip to Malta, for no especial reason except that he had always
  been interested in that romantic island.</p>

  <p>On his return to "Mayfield," Madame X was invited to stay with him, and
  there is a possibility that the advent of the lady who was a potential Mrs.
  Armstrong caused a little heartburning in certain quarters. Others may have
  considered that they had a prior right to the fascinating Herbert
  Armstrong.</p>

  <p>Armstrong docs not appear to have wasted very much of the money which came
  to him from his wife's estate. That money was practically intact at the
  moment of his arrest. But he does seem to have drawn very heavily upon funds
  which were entrusted to him to complete certain purchases of land. There
  arose a triangular correspondence between himself, Martin the solicitor, and
  a land agent living in Hereford. Perhaps "triangular" is hardly the word, in
  so far as it implies that Martin was concerned with the Hereford land agent.
  But certainly the negotiations which should have been completed hung fire,
  and there came from Martin a peremptory demand, on behalf of his client, that
  the money deposited should be returned. What was the cause of dispute between
  Martin and the land agent at Hereford has not transpired. After a visit to
  Hay and on his return to Hereford, the land agent died very suddenly.</p>

  <p>One day Martin met Major Armstrong in the village, and reminded him that
  he had not received a satisfactory reply to a letter he had sent concerning
  the money and the property which was the cause of the dispute concerning
  them. Armstrong smiled; he had a quick, inscrutable smile that lit his face
  for a second and died as instantly, leaving him expressionless.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "there is a great deal too much letter-writing between
  us, and the best thing you can do is to come up to tea with me and we will
  talk the matter over."</p>

  <p>Mr. Martin, probably remembering the coldness of his reception when first
  he put his foot across the threshold of "Mayfield," demurred to this
  suggestion, but eventually agreed. That afternoon he went up to "Mayfield,"
  was most graciously received by Armstrong, who led him to the drawing-room,
  where a tea-table had been laid. There was a cake-basket, one of those wicker
  affairs which carry three tiers of cakes and bread and butter, and, in this
  particular case, a plate of buttered scones. The tea was poured out,
  Armstrong handed a cup to his visitor, and chatted pleasantly, and a little
  ruefully, of his failure to meet the demands of his legal friend, and
  then:</p>

  <p>"Excuse fingers," said Armstrong, and handed a wedge of hot buttered scone
  to his guest.</p>

  <p>That scone had been sprinkled with the tasteless white powder which had
  removed Mrs. Armstrong from the world.</p>

  <p>Martin ate it to the last crumb, drank his tea, and, after a more or less
  satisfactory talk, walked back to Hay, where he lived with his wife.</p>

  <p>It was not until he was taking his dinner that night that he began to feel
  ill, and then so alarming were the symptoms that he was put immediately to
  bed and Dr. Hinks was summoned.</p>

  <p>Whatever Dr. Hinks's views were about this sickness, so strangely
  resembling that which had preceded Mrs. Armstrong's death, Martin's
  father-in-law, Davis the chemist, held a very decided opinion. It was part of
  his duty as a pharmaceutical chemist to understand, not only the properties,
  but the actions of various poisons, and to know also something about their
  antidotes. His son- in-law's sickness was obviously caused by arsenic. He
  immediately conveyed his suspicions to Dr. Hinks, and that practitioner
  accepted that possibility, an attitude which undoubtedly saved Martin's
  life.</p>

  <p>It is impossible for a leading man in a tiny village like Hay to be taken
  seriously ill without the news becoming public property; and when, a few days
  after Martin, very white and shaky, had made a public appearance, he met
  Armstrong, the Major was intensely sympathetic.</p>

  <p>"You must have eaten something which disagreed with you," he said (very
  truly), "and I have a feeling that you will have another illness very
  similar."</p>

  <p>Martin probably registered a silent vow that if he could help it that
  second illness should not occur. He, with Dr. Hinks, had sent a certain fluid
  to London for analysis, and when the analyst's report came, showing a
  considerable trace of arsenic, Scotland Yard was notified.</p>

  <p>In the meantime there was another curious happening. Mr. and Mrs. Martin
  received one day a box of chocolates, and, upon eating one, Mrs. Martin was
  taken ill. The fact that these chocolates, which contained arsenic, could not
  be traced to Armstrong, resulted in that aspect of the man's villainous
  activities being dropped at the trial.</p>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">ARMSTRONG was growing desperate. He made another futile
  attempt to induce Martin to pay a further visit, and, when that failed, asked
  him up to his office for tea, an invitation which was declined.</p>

  <p>The mentality of such people as Major Armstrong is puzzling, even to the
  expert psychologist. One supposes that they are mad, that they are paranoiac
  in the sense that they have to an excessive degree the delusion of their own
  infallibility. Certainly Armstrong must have realised, from the repeated
  refusals of Martin to deal with him, that he was under suspicion; and a
  normally minded man, even though he were not a Master of Arts and a clever
  lawyer, even if he had not the assistance of a large experience in criminal
  cases, would have taken immediate steps to remove every trace of his guilt
  and to cover himself against the contingency of exposure. Armstrong went
  about his work in the usual way; he was to be found in his place when the
  local court assembled, exchanging smiles with the presiding justices, who
  knew nothing whatever of the suspicion under which their clerk lay, and
  assisting them to deal with the peccadilloes of local wrongdoers. He was
  corresponding with Madame X, and at the same time was conducting an illicit
  love affair, of which evidence was plentiful in the village of Cusop.</p>

  <p>Scotland Yard, having all the facts in its possession, including the
  statement made by Dr. Hinks as to the symptoms of Mrs. Armstrong, was
  necessarily compelled to act with the greatest circumspection and caution.
  The man under suspicion was not only a lawyer, who would be conversant with
  every move in the criminal game, but he held a high position. It was
  impossible, in this tiny village, to conduct such an inquiry as would have
  been set on foot supposing the suspected man were living in London. Even the
  advent of two strange men in the village would have set tongues wagging, and
  Armstrong would have been warned that all was not well; whilst, if those
  strangers were reported to be inquiring about his movements, then the task of
  bringing him to justice was rendered all the more difficult.</p>

  <p>The officer in charge of the case was favoured by the fact that the nights
  were long and dark. He and his assistant were in the habit of arriving at Hay
  by motor-car long after the shops had closed and the people had dispersed to
  their several homes, pursuing their inquiries in secrecy and returning
  towards midnight to their headquarters at Hereford. Martin was seen and
  cross-examined, a statement taken of his visit to "Mayfield" and the
  subsequent attempts of Armstrong to induce him to make a further call: the
  chemist who supplied the arsenic displayed his books; Dr. Hinks showed his
  case-book and gave particulars of Mrs. Armstrong's illness; whilst one of the
  nurses who had looked after that unfortunate lady up to her death was also
  interviewed, under a pledge of secrecy.</p>

  <p>On New Year's Eve, 1921, the police were in possession of sufficient
  evidence to justify an arrest, not on a charge of murder, but for the
  attempted murder of Martin. The Home Office had been consulted, and
  permission to exhume the body of Mrs. Armstrong had been tentatively given,
  to be followed later by the actual order which only the Home Office
  authorities can issue, and which was, in fact, issued once Armstrong was
  under lock and key.</p>

  <p>When he reached his office, that morning, he was followed into the room by
  the two detectives in charge of the case. He must have realised, as the
  cross- examination grew closer and closer to Martin's illness, that he was
  more than under suspicion, but he did not by any sign betray either his guilt
  or his apprehension. He did, however, volunteer to make a written statement,
  and was left alone to prepare this, an opportunity which he could have put to
  good use if he had remembered that in his pocket, amongst a number of old
  papers, was a small package containing three grains of arsenic&mdash;a fatal
  dose!</p>

  <p>But he was so confident in his own ability to hoodwink the police, so
  satisfied that, occupying the position he did, no charge could be brought
  against him without his receiving sufficient warning, that he never dreamt
  that the open arrest would be followed by a closer one. The normal course
  that would have been taken, had he been under suspicion, was for an
  application to be made to the local justices for his arrest, and it is
  certain that he banked upon receiving this warning, never dreaming that
  Scotland Yard would move independently of the justices, and that the first
  intimation he would receive would be the arrival of the detectives with a
  warrant granted by superior authority.</p>

  <p>He was dumbfounded to learn from the inspector in charge (Crutchley) that
  he must consider himself in custody on a charge of attempting to murder
  Martin by the administration of arsenic.</p>

  <p>"But you cannot do that," he protested. "The charge is preposterous. Where
  is your warrant?"</p>

  <p>The warrant was shown to him, and the discovery that it had been issued
  some days previously must have come to him like the knell of doom.</p>

  <p>He was conducted to the local lock-up, which he had so often visited and
  to which he had been instrumental in consigning so many petty breakers of the
  law, and there he was searched, and the tell-tale packet of arsenic found in
  his pocket. This act of indiscretion on his part had been little short of
  madness. He must have carried the arsenic in the hope of Martin accepting one
  of those invitations which he had so frequently issued, never dreaming that
  this damning proof of his villainy would go far to hang him.</p>

  <p>"What is this. Major Armstrong?" asked the inspector sternly.</p>

  <p>"That is arsenic." Armstrong's voice was cool, his nerve unshaken.</p>

  <p>"Why do you carry this arsenic in your pocket?"</p>

  <p>"I use it to kill the dandelions on my lawn," he said, and elaborated this
  story later.</p>

  <p>From the little cell he heard the church bells of Hay ring in the dawn of
  a New Year through which it was fated that he should not live. In the morning
  he again appeared in the court he knew so well, but this time a stranger sat
  at the clerk's place, and the bewildered justices, in sorrow and
  consternation, gazed upon their friend standing in the dock, wearing his
  British-warm overcoat and smiling affably at the friends whom he recognised
  in the court.</p>

  <p>The position was an incredible one. The first few moments in that tiny
  court- house were poignant in their tragedy. Armstrong was committed on
  remand to Gloucester Prison. Again he was brought up, formal evidence given,
  and again he was remanded. In the meantime the police and the Home Office
  authorities had exhumed the body of Mrs. Armstrong, and in a near-by cottage
  Sir Bernard Spilsbury, the Home Office authority, performed his gruesome
  task, removing the portions of the body which were to be sent to the
  Government analyst.</p>

  <p>Armstrong came up before the court one morning to learn that there was a
  second charge against him, namely, that he did feloniously murder Kathleen
  Mary Armstrong by administering arsenic on or about the 21st day of February,
  1921.</p>

  <p class="first">THE court proceedings, and those at the coroner's inquest
  which followed, will always be remembered by the journalists who were
  present. The court was so tiny, and the incursion of reporters so great, that
  the most extraordinary methods were employed to cope with the situation.
  Tables were extemporised from coffin-boards, and upon these the
  representatives of the great London dailies wrote their accounts of the
  proceedings.</p>

  <p>It so happened that at the time of the preliminary inquiry, the Assize
  Court was in session, and it seemed that the man would be compelled to wait
  for six months before he was brought to the bar of justice. But Mr. Justice
  Darling announced that he would hold a special assize for the trial of
  Armstrong, and this was formally opened on April 3rd, after the man had been
  committed on both charges: that of the attempted murder of Martin, and of
  killing his wife.</p>

  <p>Armstrong's attitude throughout the preliminary inquiries had been
  taciturn and confident. He had followed every scrap of the evidence with the
  keenest interest, but had said little or nothing, and I think was the most
  confident man in the court when he was finally committed for trial, and knew
  that he was leaving the neighbourhood in which he had lorded it so long, and
  where he had lived for so many years in the odour of sanctity and the
  approval of his fellows.</p>

  <p>His vanity supported him, as it has done with so many poisoners&mdash;for
  men who destroy life in this dreadful manner are so satisfied that no
  evidence other than that which they might offer themselves can be of value in
  securing a conviction, that they are certain up to the very last that they
  can escape the consequences of their ill-doing. There has never been, in the
  history of poisoners, a single instance of a man confessing his guilt.</p>

  <p>Such was the public interest in the trial, and so serious a view did the
  law authorities take of this case, that the Attorney-General, Sir Ernest
  Pollock, now Master of the Rolls, was sent down to conduct the prosecution,
  the defence being in the hands of Sir Edward Curtis Bennett, a brilliant
  advocate who had conducted the prosecution of all the spies caught in England
  during the war.</p>

  <p>On a cold day, with snow blowing through the open windows of the court,
  Herbert Rowse Armstrong stepped lightly into the dock and bowed to the thin-
  faced man in the judge's box. He was as neatly dressed as ever&mdash;brown
  shoes, with fawn-coloured spats, brown suit and brown tie perfectly
  harmonised. He had been brought over by motor-car from Gloucester Gaol that
  morning, had interviewed his counsel, and now, with an assurance which
  allowed him to glance round the crowded court-house and nod to his friends,
  he listened to the cold, dispassionate statement of his crimes.</p>

  <p>He was in a familiar setting: he knew most of the court attendants by
  sight or name; in happier circumstances he had exchanged views and words with
  the Clerk of the Assizes; the Under-Sheriff was known to him personally; he
  had even appeared to instruct counsel before the judge who was now to conduct
  the trial. He sat back in his chair, his arms folded, a motionless and intent
  figure, following the evidence of every witness, the blue eyes seldom leaving
  their faces. Even at that hour he was satisfied that the evidence which could
  be produced would be insufficient to secure a conviction, either for murder
  or attempted murder, and he expressed to the warders, who had to bring him
  every day the long journey from Gloucester, his faith that the case for the
  Crown was so ill-constructed that the trial could not but end in his
  acquittal.</p>

  <p>"If this case were tried in Scotland," he told them, "there could be no
  question that 'Not proven' would be the verdict." Sir Ernest Pollock put the
  case fairly and humanely against him, and it was not until Armstrong himself
  went into the box that the full weight of the law's remorseless effort began
  to tell against him. In the witness-box Armstrong was a suave, easily smiling
  and courteous gentleman. His soft, drawling voice, his easy manner, his very
  frankness, told in his favour; nor did the cross-examination of the Attorney-
  General greatly shake the good impression he made. But there was a man on the
  bench wise in the ways of murderers, who saw the flaws in Armstrong's
  defence. When Mr. Justice Darling folded his arms, and, leaning forward over
  his desk, asked questions in that soft voice of his, the doom of Herbert
  Rowse Armstrong was sealed. They were merciless questions, not to be evaded
  nor to be answered obliquely.</p>

  <p>Firm to the very last, Armstrong met the dread sentence of the. court
  without any evidence of the emotion which must have possessed him, and when
  the clerk of the court asked, in halting tones:</p>

  <p>"What have you to say that the court should not now give you judgment to
  die according to law?"</p>

  <p>Armstrong almost rapped out the word:</p>

  <p>"Nothing!"</p>

  <p>Though his guilt had been established on evidence which was good and
  sufficient for the twelve men who tried him, he was not without hope that, on
  certain misdirections, he would secure a reversal of the verdict at the Court
  of Appeal. But this court, which exercises its powers of revision very
  jealously, saw no reason to interfere with the course of the law, and on May
  31st, on Derby Day, Armstrong met his fate.</p>

  <p>During his period of incarceration in Gloucester Gaol he had occupied the
  condemned cell, adjoining the execution shed, which is, in fact, a converted
  cell opening into the apartment where condemned men spend their last weeks of
  life. The disadvantage of this arrangement is that almost every sound in the
  death chamber can be heard in the condemned cell, and Armstrong, who knew
  Gloucester Gaol&mdash;knew too the proximity of his cell to the place of his
  dread end&mdash;must have been keyed up to the slightest sound. It was
  necessary that the executioner should try the trap, whilst Armstrong was at
  exercise. He arrived, however, too late for this to be done overnight, and it
  was not till the following morning that the drop was tested.</p>

  <p>At seven o'clock Armstrong, who had been up an hour, was invited by the
  warders to take a final walk in the exercise yard, an experience unique for a
  man under sentence of death. The sky was blue and cloudless, the morning warm
  and balmy, and he strolled about in the limited space allotted to him,
  showing no evidence of the terrible agony which must have been in his soul.
  After nearly an hour's walk he was conducted back to the condemned cell,
  where the minister of religion was already waiting, and within a very short
  time he had paid the penalty for his crime.</p>

  <p>The Armstrong murder may become historic from the point of view of the
  lawyer, since he was condemned on evidence which was entirely and completely
  circumstantial. But, as Sir Ernest Pollock pointed out at the trial, in a
  poison trial direct evidence is practically impossible.</p>

  <p>"In this case," said Sir Ernest, "we know that Mrs. Armstrong died from
  arsenical poisoning. This body of evidence which will be called before you
  will be directed piece by piece, circumstance by circumstance, pointing to a
  conclusion that it was the prisoner at the bar who killed his wife.</p>

  <p>"She died from arsenical poisoning. Who had the means, who had the
  opportunity in August and in February, who had the motive to administer the
  poison?</p>

  <p>"You find the means with the prisoner. You find the opportunity&mdash;the
  one man who was at 'Mayfield' both in August and in February. You find the
  motive in the will referred to."</p>

  <p>Though there was no proof of the administration of poison, and the
  evidence of motive, as far as Mrs. Armstrong's fortune was concerned, was
  perhaps the weakest that has ever been put against any man on the capital
  charge, nevertheless, nobody who knew him, and who was brought into close
  touch with his life, will doubt that Armstrong was guilty.</p>

  <p>Before Ellis pulled the bolt, the slight figure standing on the drop said
  something that was indistinguishable. One present thought that it was a
  confession of guilt&mdash;more likely it was a last protest of innocence.</p>

  <p>Armstrong had refused an offer of £5,000 which I had made to him a few
  days before for a complete confession of his crime.</p>
