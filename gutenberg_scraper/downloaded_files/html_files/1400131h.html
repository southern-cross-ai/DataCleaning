  <p class="first">THE murders committed by criminals who have been classified
  by criminologists as "Class D. Larcenists" make up a very large percentage.
  It is possible, if one sits in a magistrate's court throughout the year, to
  collect a list of names which will be almost certain to produce at least one
  murderer in the course of a generation.</p>

  <p>A criminal of this type, however, now and then escapes conviction. He may
  be wanted by the police, but the chastening experience of prison life, which
  might possibly bring about a reformation, has been denied to him. He has
  behind him an embezzlement or two of a petty kind; he has probably been
  associated with two or three shady methods of obtaining money by false
  pretences; and to these offences may often be added affairs of gallantry,
  and, if not a bigamous marriage, at least one marriage and wife
  desertion.</p>

  <p>There is no more dangerous criminal than a small larcenist who has escaped
  the consequence of his offences, through, as he believes, his own dexterity
  and skill. Having this good opinion of himself, he progresses from crime to
  crime, until there comes a moment when he finds no other escape from the
  consequences of his meanness and folly than the destruction of a human life
  which, as he believes, stands between himself and freedom. And so confident
  is he in his own genius for evasion that he will plan the most diabolical of
  crimes, perfectly satisfied in his mind that the success which has attended
  the commission of minor offences will not desert his efforts to evade the
  penalty of his supreme villainy.</p>

  <p>And the meaner the larcenist, the meaner the criminal, the meaner the
  murder. The greater criminals, the Deemings and the Chapmans, killed on the
  grand scale. The crimes of such small men as Herbert John Bennett, some time
  a labourer at Woolwich Arsenal, are attended by those evidences of low
  cunning which enabled them to twist a way of escape out of their minor
  crimes, but which were utterly inadequate to protect them when the more
  complicated machinery of the law was set in movement, and the brightest
  brains of Scotland Yard were concentrated against them.</p>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">BENNETT was a man possessed of a smattering of education he
  received at one of the elementary schools, and he had, moreover, even as a
  boy, an ambition to shine in a higher stratum of society than that in which
  circumstances had placed him. Such an ambition is commendable enough, and has
  brought many a man from the gutter to the highest positions in the
  land&mdash;always providing that the climber has less regard for appearance
  than for the solid substance of his advancement.</p>

  <p>Bennett, by no means intellectual, wished to appear rather than to be; and
  at the age of sixteen he set himself the task of supplying the deficiencies
  of his education. He had a mind for dancing, and considered the possibility
  of being able to play the piano with such skill that he might gain for
  himself an entry to doors that were now closed to him.</p>

  <p>His gropings toward gentility brought him into contact with a young girl,
  whom he must have regarded as his social superior, since she had many of the
  attainments which he lacked, and was not only something of a musician, but
  sufficiently proficient to give lessons on the piano. He was seventeen, she
  was two years older, and he displayed toward her a devotion which was as
  passionate as it was ephemeral. Young as he was, he could talk impressively.
  He left her head reeling with magnificent prospects; the scope of his
  ambition left her breathless; and when he proposed, as eventually he did, she
  accepted him. Bennett, despite his youth, was a tempestuous lover.</p>

  <p>"He had very big ideas for one of his station. Sometimes he would talk so
  grandly that even the people who knew him best believed that he was on the
  point of receiving some exceptionally good appointment, or was about to
  inherit enormous sums of money." He had had his smaller adventures, and fate
  and an excursion ticket had once carried him to his first view of the
  sea&mdash;at Yarmouth.</p>

  <p>At his then impressionable age, Yarmouth became the first and only seaside
  place where happiness was to be found. The Cockney's devotion to his first
  love in this respect is proverbial, and there is little doubt that Yarmouth
  was, for Bennett, an enchanted beach ever after, just as Hastings is to the
  writer, and Brighton to so many hundreds.</p>

  <p>The marriage to the music teacher was a hurried affair. They appeared one
  morning before a London registrar, and were made man and wife.</p>

  <p>With marriage came dispointed illusionment for the girl. The great schemes
  began to dissipate into thin air. The fine appointment, which would have
  secured them "a detached house and garden, and possibly some poultry at the
  back," did not happen. Bennett made his living by a succession of little
  jobs, none of which he retained for any time. He was a grocer's assistant, a
  sort of shop-walker; odds and ends of jobs came his way; his leaving was more
  or less hurried, and where there was money to be handled, was accompanied by
  a suspicion, amounting in one or two cases to a certainty, that, in his
  yearnings for gentility, Bennett had cast overboard the principle that holds
  a man to honesty.</p>

  <p>He became a canvasser, selling sewing-machines, and his plausibility and
  qualities of salesmanship earned him good commission. There was some
  suggestion that not all the orders were genuine, and a possibility that he
  sold some machines outright and collected the money for them without
  accounting to his employers.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bennett had an aged grandmother, with whom the couple were living.
  She had a small allowance, sufficient to keep her, if not in comfort, at
  least beyond the fear of want. Her possessions were few, but amongst them was
  a long silver chain and a very old-fashioned watch, in which she took great
  pride, and to which she attached such importance, though it was in truth a
  very clumsy piece of jewellery, that she made one of those informal,
  word-of-mouth wills, so common to people of her class, by saying, "When I am
  gone, this is yours, my dear."</p>

  <p>Eventually she died, and the chain passed to the girl. By that time she
  was not greatly interested in chains or watches, and even the death of her
  grandmother brought no very great increase to a burden which was already more
  than she could bear.</p>

  <p>The passionate youth she had married had developed into a bullying,
  hectoring young man, who never ceased to find fault, who cursed her openly
  and privately for ruining his life, and who did not hesitate to beat her. A
  child had been born of the marriage, and while it was coming she had been
  subjected to every kind of indignity and ill-treatment.</p>

  <p>So Bennett moved from job to job. His limited education restricted his
  opportunities, and there was the additional handicap that he had often to
  rely upon characters and references which were obviously forged.</p>

  <p>Of much that would be interesting about this period to the criminologist,
  there is no trace. It is certain that Bennett was engaged in some nefarious
  business, for he was changing cheques for large sums, and had suddenly
  changed his name and became Mr. Hood. In this name, he and his wife and baby
  left, somewhat hurriedly, for South Africa; and it is certain that at the
  time Bennett had sufficient money, not only to pay the fare out and maintain
  himself in Cape Town, but also to pay the return fare when, after a very
  short stay in Cape Town, he decided that South Africa offered no
  opportunities to a man of his ability, and returned.</p>

  <p>Relationships between the Bennetts were now strained. The man had grown
  tired of his early love, told her she was a millstone about his neck, and
  attributed the passing of his dreams, the non-fulfilment of the bright
  promises of his youth, to the handicap of having to provide for her.</p>

  <p>Their stay in Cape Town was a matter of days. The newness of the life, or,
  as he described it, the exclusiveness of Colonial society, irritated and
  frightened him, and they had scarcely settled down in their lodgings before
  he was back in the Adderley Street shipping office, arranging his passage
  back to England.</p>

  <p>Their return to London was followed by a separation. He had managed to
  secure work in Woolwich, and, on the plea that the lodgings they had taken at
  Bexley Heath were too far from his work, he left his wife and came to live at
  Woolwich, where he posed as a single man, visiting his wife very
  occasionally, and doling out to her sufficient money to make both ends
  meet.</p>

  </div>

  <p>They had taken the lodgings at Bexley Heath in his own name, but it was as
  Hood that he was best known in Woolwich; and here, free from the encumbrance
  of his wife, he began to pay attentions to an attractive young girl, Alice
  Meadows.</p>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">ONCE more he assumed the role of ambitious young man, with
  immense prospects, and behind him a fascinating experience, for he could now
  talk of his foreign travels, could speak almost with authority upon South
  Africa (at that moment a centre of interest, for the Boer War was in
  progress), and from his imagination could evolve stories of adventure, very
  fascinating to a young girl who had spent most of her life within the
  confines of London.</p>

  <p>It is clear that Bennett was not depending entirely upon the wages he
  earned at the Arsenal. He had some other source of revenue, and the
  probability is that he ran one of his get-rich-quick schemes as a
  side-line.</p>

  <p>In the summer of 1900, soon after Miss Meadows and he had become
  acquainted, and he had met the Meadows family (impressing them as a young man
  of singular attainments), the question of a summer holiday was mooted, and
  what was more natural than that the first place which occurred to him as a
  likely spot was Yarmouth? At any rate, he wrote to a landlady in the place,
  asking her if she could reserve rooms for himself and his fiancée. The
  landlady, if she remembered him at all, was not aware that he was
  married.</p>

  <p>In any case, she had no accommodation at the moment, and accordingly he
  reserved rooms at a little hotel, and went down with his fiancée, travelling
  first class, and spent a week in that delightful pleasure resort. They
  occupied separate rooms; he was a model of decorum; and those who noticed the
  rather undistinguished couple observed him as an attentive, considerate young
  man, who could not do enough for his companion.</p>

  <p>The holiday seems to have been of a fairly innocent character. It gave
  them, however, an opportunity of discussing their future and of fixing the
  date of their wedding. Bennett, as usual, had great schemes which were on the
  verge of fruition, and the prospect must indeed have been a very brilliant
  one to Alice Meadows, who listened, open-mouthed, to the many inventions of
  her lover, learnt that he was well connected and expected in a very short
  time to inherit a fine property. Dazzled by his convincing lies, she made
  preparations to leave the place where she was employed as a domestic servant,
  and, with the assistance of her family, began to get together the clothes and
  dainty fripperies which are the especial possessions of a bride.</p>

  <p>"A nicely behaved couple&mdash;I often saw them strolling along the South
  Beach," said an observer. "They were a model of what engaged people should
  be."</p>

  <p>But alas for poor Alice Meadows! Her dreams were soon to dissipate into
  thin air; the growing treasures of clothing she was collecting were never to
  be worn for his pleasure; and the grand future, so far as he was concerned,
  was to end dismally on a gallows in Norwich Jail.</p>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p><a id="pic4"

  <div align="center">

  </div><br>

  <p class="first">IT is the failing of all men who worship their own
  reputations, that they must be thought well of at any costs by the person
  who, for the moment, fills their eye. You may turn the leaves of criminal
  history and find this queer, perverted vanity showing in every other line. It
  of was the same with Deeming, with Chapman, with Dougal, with Crippen; it is
  difficult to find a case of murder where this distorted ego does not stand
  out in the criminal's psychology.</p>

  <p>I can recall only three cases, a notable example of which was Smith, the
  brides-in-the-bath murderer, where this bloated sense of self-importance did
  not permeate the story of his supreme offence. There is no reason in the
  world why Bennett should not have married the girl, committing bigamy and
  risking the consequence of his misdemeanour. There was no reason why Crippen
  should not have run away with Miss Le Neve, or why Deeming should not have
  left his wife and children to the charity of his relations. But this passion
  for making a new start, for wiping out, as they believe, all that is past in
  one terrible act of savagery, as expressed in sixty percent of murder cases,
  was too strong for Herbert Bennett. In his muddled brain there was only one
  way of establishing himself as a single man and justifying all the lies he
  had told, and that was by removing the woman who stood between him and a new
  life.</p>

  <p>Probably he also found, at this stage, that the drag upon his financial
  resources which this double life of his involved was reaching the breaking
  point. He had spent money on holidays, he had given Alice Meadows an
  engagement ring, and there came from his wife at Bexley Heath a request for a
  seaside holiday, which gave him the idea which was subsequently carried into
  effect.</p>

  <p>He very seldom met his wife nowadays. His visits to Bexley Heath were few
  and far between. Nevertheless, his allowance to her enabled her to live
  without working too hard. She could afford, for example, to send out a small
  quantity of her linen to a neighbouring laundry.</p>

  <p>Bennett does not seem to have been in any dire straits, or to have called
  upon his wife for assistance to meet his bills. In the course of their
  married life he had given her four or five rings, and at no time had she been
  asked to part with these, so the supposition that he had another source of
  income than his wages at the Arsenal is strengthened; for obviously it would
  have been impossible for him to have maintained two homes, and carried on an
  expensive courtship, on his salary as a labourer.</p>

  <p>But the end was in sight, and he determined to rid himself of at least one
  expense; and when his wife mentioned in her letter a wish for a holiday, he
  replied promptly, suggesting Yarmouth, and giving her the address of the
  house where, only a month before, he had applied for lodgings for his
  fiancée.</p>

  <p>On this occasion Mrs. Rudrum (this was the landlady's name) had a vacancy,
  and in the beginning of September Mrs. Bennett went down to Yarmouth with her
  child and took up her residence in Mrs. Rudrum's house. At her husband's
  request, however, she changed her name, and it was as Mrs. Hood that she was
  known to her landlady and the very few people who knew her by sight.</p>

  <p>A reserved woman, who did not readily make friends, she seemed to be
  completely satisfied with the companionship of her child. The landlady
  observed: "The only thing that I noticed about her was that she wore a long
  silver chain around her neck, and had an old-fashioned watch. She was not the
  kind of woman that you would notice very much. She was very fond of her
  little girl and had no other thought than to keep her amused and happy."</p>

  <p>One day, when she was strolling along the beach, a beach photographer came
  to her, and by his professional blandishments induced her to pose for a
  little tintype picture of herself and the child, and she was all the more
  ready to agree to his proposition because she had no picture of the little
  one. And so the photograph was taken, and thereafter occupied a place of
  honour in her tiny bedroom.</p>

  <p>Who she was, and where she came from, nobody knew. Apparently no
  preliminary letter had been written to the landlady, and until she appeared
  at Mrs. Rudrum's, that lady had no idea she was coming. She was
  uncommunicative, not inclined to gossip, was typical perhaps of a large
  number of weekly trippers who visit seaside places, in that she had no
  identity except as a summer boarder.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Rudrum was incurious. She did notice, however, that there arrived one
  morning a letter contained in a bluish-grey envelope and bearing the postmark
  of Woolwich. The contents of that letter are unknown: the instructions it
  contained she carried to her grave. But reconstructing the crime in the light
  of subsequent knowledge, it may be supposed that Bennett wrote to his wife,
  telling her that he would meet her on the Saturday night, giving her a
  rendezvous, and in all probability telling her that there was particular
  reason why he should not be seen in Yarmouth, and also why she should not
  divulge the fact that he was arriving at all. It is probable, too, that he
  told her to burn the letter, or else to bring it with her and give it to him
  when they met; for it is hardly likely that he would take the risk of so
  incriminating a document being left about for the landlady to see.</p>

  <p>She was used to these furtive methods of his. A decent woman, with a
  respectable life behind her, would not acquiesce in these constant changes of
  name unless she knew, or believed, that her man's safety depended upon the
  deception. It is certain, moreover, that she must have been acquainted with
  his many curious methods of making money, and that she might therefore be
  dangerous to him if he deserted her.</p>

  <p>Something of her complacence and her confidence is traceable to this
  knowledge. The landlady did not see the letter again, nor did she notice that
  it had been destroyed, so it is more likely that Bennett insisted upon his
  wife bringing the letter with her, in order that he could be sure it would
  fall into no other hands.</p>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">ON the Saturday night she put the child to bed, dressed
  herself with unusual care, putting on the silver chain and watch, and went
  out toward the front. She was seen by her landlady walking up and down
  outside the Town Hall, a building which is very near to the railway station,
  and it is certain that this was the rendezvous and that she was waiting for
  the arrival of the train which would bring Bennett from London.</p>

        title="Illustration">

  <p>Coming down, as he did, with murder in his heart, and the means of
  encompassing his wife's death in his pocket, and having taken such
  extraordinary precautions against being associated with the woman, it is
  almost staggering, yet typical of the careless workings of the criminal mind,
  that he should not only have met her before the Town Hall, in one of the
  busiest parts of Yarmouth, but that he should have taken her to a small inn
  near the quay, where they drank together, afterwards disappearing in the
  direction of South Beach.</p>

  <p>South Beach at that time was a wild, untended stretch of sand and marram
  grass, to which courting couples instinctively bent their way. There were
  innumerable hollows where the swains could be sure of freedom from
  observation. One such hollow was occupied that night by a man and a girl, who
  saw two figures come out of the darkness and go into another depression near
  by. That they were lovers the two observers, very much more interested in
  themselves than their surroundings, accepted without question.</p>

  <p>Bennett, unaware that he had been seen, settled himself down, with his
  wife at his side, his arm about her, words of love on his lips, and in his
  hand a mohair boot-lace about nine inches long, with which he intended to
  commit his hideous crime.</p>

  <p>That the deed was done at the very moment when the woman, who still loved
  him, might expect from him nothing but tenderness, was proved when her body
  was found. The lovers near by heard a woman's voice pleading for mercy, but
  thought that they were skylarking and took no further notice. While he kissed
  his wife, Bennett had twisted the lace about her neck, drawn it tight and
  fastened it with a reef knot. She must have died within a few minutes, whilst
  he pressed the struggling figure deeper into the sand.</p>

  <p>At midnight he appeared at the hotel, where he had stayed only a week or
  so before with Alice Meadows.</p>

  <p>His manner was nervous and excited. He told the hotel porter that he had
  come down by the last train, and that he must leave by the first train out of
  Yarmouth in the morning. There was no appearance of a struggle; beyond a
  little agitation and his trembling hands when he took a drink, there was
  little remarkable in his appearance, and the porter very promptly forgot the
  incident of the unexpected visitor, called him in the morning in time to
  catch the seven o'clock train, and thereafter the matter went out of his
  mind, the more so, as he thought of Bennett as a young man newly-engaged and
  who was, as Bennett had told him on his visit, about to be married to a very
  charming girl.</p>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">SO far, we know the story of the murder. We are acquainted
  not only with the identity but the character of the murderer. We know the
  circumstances which led Mrs. Bennett to adopt the name of Hood, and why she
  came to Yarmouth. We have to consider now the problem which confronted the
  police force when, on the Sunday morning, it was reported by an early morning
  bather that the dead body of a woman was lying in the sands of South Beach, a
  mohair lace tied tightly about her neck. Yarmouth was still full of visitors,
  strangers to the town. It had its quota of undesirables, male and female. The
  police knew that the South Beach was infested, at certain hours of the night,
  with queer people, also strangers to the town. When the body was removed to
  the mortuary, and a brief examination had been made by local and county
  detectives, there was nothing to reveal who she was, where she had come from,
  what were the circumstances attending her death.</p>

  <p>Their first view was that she was some unfortunate creature who had been
  maltreated by a chance acquaintance, one of those half-mad murderers who
  skulk all the time, unsuspected, in our midst. That was the view persisted in
  for a long time after the jury had returned a verdict.</p>

  <p>The first rift in the cloud of anonymity came when Mrs. Rudrum, who had
  learnt of the murder from a neighbour, and who knew that her lodger had not
  returned all night, came down to the police station and made her report. She
  was shown the body, and instantly identified her as Mrs. Hood. Could the
  landlady tell the police whether any of her jewellery was missing? The rings
  were still upon the woman's hands, but the silver chain and the watch had
  gone.</p>

  <p>"What silver chain was that?" asked the chief detective.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Rudrum tried inadequately to describe the trinket, and then
  remembered that in the dead woman's room was the little photograph that had
  been taken on the beach. Accompanied by police officers, she went back to the
  house, and a very thorough search was made of the room. The photograph was
  taken away, and every drawer ransacked, for by now the police had learnt of
  the bluish-grey letter with the Woolwich postmark. But of this there was no
  trace. Nor was there any other document or writing which could throw the
  least light upon Mrs. Hood's identity, her friends or her place of origin.
  The landlady knew nothing; her lodger had "kept herself to herself, and told
  me none of her business."</p>

  <p>On some of the linen was a laundry mark&mdash;just a number, 599. And with
  these two most slender clues, a small tintype picture showing, in microscopic
  proportions, a blurred chain, and the 599 laundry mark, the police began
  their search. But at every turn they were baffled. That Mrs. Hood had met a
  man outside the Town Hall, and that she had been seen in a public-house with
  him, only established the suspicion that the murderer was not a chance-found
  acquaintance, that the woman had met him by appointment, and that he came
  from somewhere outside of Yarmouth.</p>

  <p>The Woolwich postmark narrowed down the search only in so far that every
  laundry in Woolwich was visited, the marks books inspected, still without
  bringing the authorities any nearer to their quarry. From time to time the
  inquest was adjourned, until, after six weeks, it seemed that the case was at
  an end, and the jury returned a verdict of "murder against some person or
  persons unknown."</p>

  <p>The photographs were circulated far and wide, but without result for some
  time. Then, when the search seemed at an end (though such searches are never
  at an end where the Metropolitan police are concerned), a laundry manageress
  at Bexley Heath recognised, from the photograph of the laundry mark, the
  handiwork of her own establishment and, turning up the books, it was
  discovered that Number 599 had been given to a Mrs. Bennett.</p>

  <p>The police were at that time systematically exploring every channel that
  would identify the laundry mark with the murdered woman, and detectives were
  instantly on the spot. The house in which Mrs. Bennett had lived was visited
  and, without hesitation, a woman who knew her identified, not only the
  photograph, but the chain which she had been wearing.</p>

  <p>At Yarmouth she had told Mrs. Rudrum that she was a widow. At Bexley Heath
  she was known as a married woman, living apart from her husband, and people
  who lived in the same house remembered that she had frequently received
  letters which were enclosed in the bluish-grey envelopes that had been
  described at Yarmouth.</p>

  <p>This was only the beginning of the new search. The police might find the
  sender of the letter, might even discover, as they suspected, that it was the
  husband of Mrs. Hood, and yet unearth no more than a bereaved man, ignorant
  of his wife's whereabouts and her fate. The investigations in Woolwich began
  all over again, and finally Herbert Bennett was discovered at the
  Arsenal.</p>

  <p>Bennett had returned to town, and his first act was to meet Alice Meadows
  in Hyde Park, and subsequently he gave her a number of things belonging to
  his wife. These, however, did not include the chain and the watch, which he
  took from his wife's dead body, or, as is more probable, which she handed to
  him as they were walking along the beach, or when they sat down in the
  hollow, being afraid of losing something for which she had a personal
  affection.</p>

  <p>Long before any arrest was made, the detectives conducted an inquiry into
  Bennett's movements. Having established beyond doubt the fact that he was a
  married man, the further discovery that he was courting another girl and that
  she was on the threshold of marriage, strengthened the suspicion that Bennett
  was responsible for the death of his wife.</p>

  <p>The extraordinary rapidity with which the police work on such occasions as
  these was facilitated by the fact that Bennett had no idea he was under
  suspicion, although interrogations had been made of Alice Meadows, his
  friends had been visited and questioned, and Mrs. Bennett's relations had
  been seen by the police.</p>

  <p>During this period Bennett displayed a mild interest in the Yarmouth
  murder. He had discussed the crime with his wife-to-be and her sister, and
  had expressed his surprise that the police had not been able to run the
  murderer to earth. He had even advanced theories as to how the crime was
  committed and the murderer escaped!</p>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  </div><br>

  <p class="first">THEN, one day, when he might have thought that the crime had
  blown over, and that the police were now interested in something more
  promising, two detectives appeared and asked him to accompany them to the
  police station, and here, to his amazement and horror, he was charged with
  the murder of his wife.</p>

  <p>Bennett then did what so many men have done to tighten the noose about
  their necks.</p>

  <p>"Yarmouth?" he said indignantly. "Why, I have never been to Yarmouth in my
  life!"</p>

  <p>There are so many parallel instances of similar acts of reckless stupidity
  that we can pass over his extraordinary folly without comment. Not only had
  he been at Yarmouth, but the police knew that he had been there with Alice
  Meadows. She herself made no secret of her innocent holiday; and there was
  the staff at the hotel at which he had stayed to prove the fact beyond any
  question of doubt.</p>

  <p>How slender are the clues on which a murderer's detection hangs! A chance-
  taken picture made by a beach photographer; the accidental decision of Mrs.
  Bennett to wear her chain on that day&mdash;she did not wear it every
  day&mdash;was a link so strong that the cleverest advocate of the day, Mr.
  Marshall Hall, was not able to break it.</p>

  <p>Even complete frankness could not have saved Bennett from the scaffold.
  Had he admitted that he came secretly to see his wife on the night of the
  murder, and that he left her the next day; if he had admitted his duplicity
  and the projected act of bigamy; if he had taken the police partly into his
  confidence; even then that chain which was found in his portmanteau was the
  most damning proof of his guilt. Without that silver trinket, Bennett could
  not have been convicted, much less hanged. If, when he found it in his
  pocket, he had thrown it into the fire, or dropped it into the river, not
  even his suspicious conduct, his denial of ever having been at Yarmouth,
  could have brought him to the condemned cell.</p>

  <p>But there were the two unchallengeable facts: the silver chain,
  photographed on the woman two or three days before the murder; the evidence
  of her landlady that, on the night she went out to meet her husband, she was
  wearing that chain, and when she was seen outside the Town Hall later in the
  evening she was still wearing that chain; the absence of the chain from the
  body when it was discovered; and its finding in his possession&mdash;these
  were the unbreakable chains of proof which he could never shake off. There is
  an old Spanish saying that every murderer carries in his right hand the proof
  of his guilt, and never was this proverb so exemplified as in the case of the
  Yarmouth murder. What malignant imp induced him to take the chain at all,
  what perversity allowed him to keep it in his possession after the murder was
  discovered, and long after the description of this trinket had been
  circulated throughout the kingdom, we cannot tell.</p>

  <p><a id="pic6"
     name="pic6"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

  <div align="center">

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>"If the chain had not been found in Bennett's possession," said the
  greatest criminal authority of the day, "not only would the most striking
  piece of evidence have been removed from the prosecutor's brief, but there
  would have actually appeared a point in favour of the prisoner! The
  disappearance of the chain would have been adduced as a reasonable
  supposition that Mrs. Bennett had been killed by an unknown lover for the
  sake of its value."</p>

  <p>So strong was popular feeling that, instead of being tried at the Norwich
  Assizes, Bennett was removed to the Old Bailey, and here, before the Lord
  Chief Justice, Lord Alverstone, he made his acquaintance with a London jury.
  Thirty witnesses were called&mdash;witnesses who spoke of Bennett's early
  married life, of his visit to South Africa, of his ill-treatment of his young
  wife, and his trip to Yarmouth. There was, of course, no evidence as to any
  act of felony or misdemeanour which procured him large sums of money from
  time to time, for the English law does not allow such evidence to be taken
  when a man is on trial for his life.</p>

  <p>There were the hotel porter and the manager, who knew him and had looked
  after him when he was at Yarmouth with his fiancée. There were the people who
  saw him in the bar of the little inn near the quay. There was the landlady,
  and, most distressing of all, the girl to whom he was engaged.</p>

  <p>To a man of Bennett's temperament, this was the most uncomfortable witness
  of all. "It was not the murder he had committed but the lies he had told
  which upset him," said an observer.</p>

  <p>Time and time again we have seen a murderer display the most poignant
  emotion, not at the recital of his crime, but at the appearance in the
  witness-box of some person whose opinion he valued, and before whom he must
  now appear in the light of a boaster and liar.</p>

  <p>If it is possible for such a man to possess affection which could be
  truthfully described as genuine, Bennett had found, in this newest of
  friends, the love of his life. He had been introduced to her family and had
  impressed them with his genius and his extraordinary knowledge of affairs. A
  man of perfect manners, he had impressed that least impressionable of
  persons, his future wife's sister.</p>

  <p>When Alice Meadows stepped into the box, Bennett's eyes dropped; it was
  the only period during the trial that he gave evidence of his discomfort.
  Lower and lower sank his head as she related, in that unimpassioned
  atmosphere, the foolish stories he had told of his career, his prospects, his
  travels.</p>

  <p>Bennett's imagination ran riot when his audience was a woman: his gifts of
  invention were never so marked as in those circumstances. He could listen
  without flinching to the record of his horrible deed&mdash;more horrible than
  can be related in cold print; he could watch with a detached interest the
  display of the trinket which he had taken from his wife a few minutes before
  her death, and could give his complete attention to the doctor's evidence. To
  Bennett, that was the least of his embarrassment. The real ordeal for him
  came when Alice Meadows exposed him as a braggart and a liar.</p>

  <p>In this Bennett was not exceptional: all who have attended the trials of
  great criminals have witnessed a similar phenomenon. Armstrong's averted gaze
  and discomfort when the evidence of Madame X. was being taken, Crippen's
  agitation when reference was made to his relationship with Miss Le Neve,
  Seddon's flushed face when the purity of his freemasonry was called into
  question&mdash;one could multiply such instances by a hundred.</p>

  <p>Throughout the trial Bennett's behaviour was exemplary.</p>

  <p>The trial lasted six days, and at the end the jury required only
  thirty-five minutes to make up their minds, and, returning to the court,
  declared Bennett to be guilty of wilful murder. To the very last the man
  protested his innocence. Even when the judge assumed the black cap he showed
  neither fear nor any departure from his attitude of a misjudged man.</p>

  <p>The sentence of the court was that he should be taken hence, and from
  thence to Norwich Jail, and that there he should be hanged; and under a
  strong guard he returned over the familiar route to Norwich&mdash;the route
  he had travelled with Alice Meadow's on the way to their holiday; the route
  he had followed when he was bound for Yarmouth with a cruel murder plan; now
  to expiate his crime within a few miles of the cemetery where his murdered
  wife was lying.</p>

  <p>Here, on a chill day in March, he met his fate at the hands of the common
  hangman. But the memory of Bennett will be perpetuated for many years. His
  conviction will stand as a model of the efficacy of circumstantial evidence.
  Here was a case where a man committed a murder, and no weapon of any kind was
  traceable to him&mdash;for the mohair lace with which this unfortunate woman
  was strangled was not identified with one that had been in his possession at
  any time. There was undoubtedly a motive, though it might be urged that there
  was no immediate necessity for doing away with his wife, and that he gained
  very little by his crime. Even the laundry mark was only useful to the police
  in locating the woman's ordinary place of residence. It was on the flimsy
  links of an old-fashioned silver chain that the Crown depended to prove that
  Bennett was the murderer. And most effectively did they succeed.</p>
