  <h3>A TALE OF THE DAYS OF XERXES, LEONIDAS AND THEMISTOCLES</h3>

  <h3>First published by Macmillan &amp; Co., Ltd., London &amp; New York,
  1907</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="cp"><small><i>&ldquo;... On the Ægean shore a city stands,<br>
  Built nobly, pure the air and light the soil,<br>
  Athens, the eye of Greece.&rdquo;</i></small></p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>AUTHOR&rsquo;S NOTE</h3>

  <p class="intro">The invasion of Greece by Xerxes, with its battles of
  Thermopylæ, Salamis, and Platæa, forms one of the most dramatic events in
  history. Had Athens and Sparta succumbed to this attack of Oriental
  superstition and despotism, the Parthenon, the Attic Theatre, the Dialogues
  of Plato, would have been almost as impossible as if Phidias, Sophocles, and
  the philosophers had never lived. Because this contest and its
  heroes&mdash;Leonidas and Themistocles&mdash;cast their abiding shadows
  across our world of to-day, I have attempted this piece of historical
  fiction.</p>

  <p class="intro">Many of the scenes were conceived on the fields of action
  themselves during a recent visit to Greece, and I have tried to give some
  glimpse of the natural beauty of &ldquo;The Land of the
  Hellene,&rdquo;&mdash;a beauty that will remain when Themistocles and his
  peers fade away still further into the backgrounds of history.</p>

  <h2><a id="pro"
     name="pro"></a>PROLOGUE. THE ISTHMIAN GAMES NEAR CORINTH</h2>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. -- GLAUCON THE BEAUTIFUL</h2>

  <p class="first">The crier paused for the fifth time. The crowd&mdash;knotty
  Spartans, keen Athenians, perfumed Sicilians&mdash;pressed his pulpit closer,
  elbowing for the place of vantage. Amid a lull in their clamour the crier
  recommenced.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now, men of Hellas, another time hearken. The sixth contestant
  in the pentathlon, most honourable of the games held at the Isthmus, is
  Glaucon, son of Conon the Athenian; his grandfather&mdash;&rdquo; a jangling
  shout drowned him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The most beautiful man in Hellas!&rdquo; &ldquo;But an effeminate
  puppy!&rdquo; &ldquo;Of the noble house of Alcmæon!&rdquo; &ldquo;The
  family&rsquo;s accursed!&rdquo; &ldquo;A great god helps him&mdash;even
  Eros.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ay&mdash;the fool married for mere love. He needs help.
  His father disinherited him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace, peace,&rdquo; urged the crier; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell all
  about him, as I have of the others. Know then, my masters, that he loved, and
  won in marriage, Hermione, daughter of Hermippus of Eleusis. Now Hermippus is
  Conon&rsquo;s mortal enemy; therefore in great wrath Conon disinherited his
  son,&mdash;but now, consenting to forgive him if he wins the parsley crown in
  the pentathlon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A safe promise,&rdquo; interrupted a Spartan in broadest Doric;
  &ldquo;the pretty boy has no chance against Lycon, our Laconian
  giant.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boaster!&rdquo; retorted an Athenian. &ldquo;Did not Glaucon bend
  open a horseshoe yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our M&oelig;rocles did that,&rdquo; called a Mantinean; whereupon
  the crier, foregoing his long speech on Glaucon&rsquo;s noble ancestry, began
  to urge the Athenians to show their confidence by their wagers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How much is staked that Glaucon can beat Ctesias of
  Epidaurus?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t match our lion against mice!&rdquo; roared the
  noisiest Athenian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or Amyntas of Thebes?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not Amyntas! Give us Lycon of Sparta.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lycon let it be,&mdash;how much is staked and by whom, that Glaucon
  of Athens, contending for the first time in the great games, defeats Lycon of
  Sparta, twice victor at Nemea, once at Delphi, and once at
  Olympia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The second rush and outcry put the crier nearly at his wits&rsquo; end to
  record the wagers that pelted him, and which testified how much confidence
  the numerous Athenians had in their unproved champion. The brawl of voices
  drew newcomers from far and near. The chariot race had just ended in the
  adjoining hippodrome; and the idle crowd, intent on a new excitement, came
  surging up like waves. In such a whirlpool of tossing arms and shoving
  elbows, he who was small of stature and short of breath stood a scanty chance
  of getting close enough to the crier&rsquo;s stand to have his wager
  recorded. Such, at least, was the fate of a gray but dignified little man,
  who struggled vainly&mdash;even with risk to his long linen chiton&mdash;to
  reach the front.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ugh! ugh! Make way, good people,&mdash;Zeus confound you, brute of
  a Spartan, your big sandals crush my toes again! Can I never get near enough
  to place my two minæ on that Glaucon?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Keep back, graybeard,&rdquo; snapped the Spartan; &ldquo;thank the
  god if you can hold your money and not lose it, when Glaucon&rsquo;s neck is
  wrung to-morrow.&rdquo; Whereupon he lifted his own voice with, &ldquo;Thirty
  drachmæ to place on Lycon, Master Crier! So you have it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And two minæ on Glaucon,&rdquo; piped the little man, peering up
  with bright, beady eyes; but the crier would never have heard him, save for a
  sudden ally.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who wants to stake on Glaucon?&rdquo; burst in a hearty young
  Athenian who had wagered already. &ldquo;You, worthy sir? Then by
  Athena&rsquo;s owls they shall hear you! Lend us your elbow,
  Democrates.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The latter request was to a second young Athenian close by. With his
  stalwart helpers thrusting at either side, the little man was soon close to
  the crier.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two minæ?&rdquo; quoth the latter, leaning, &ldquo;two that Glaucon
  beats Lycon, and at even odds? But your name, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The little man straightened proudly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Simonides of Ceos.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The crowd drew back by magic. The most bristling Spartan grew respectful.
  The crier bowed as his ready stylus made the entry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Simonides of Ceos, Simonides the most noted poet in Hellas!&rdquo;
  cried the first of his two rescuers; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a great honour to have
  served so famous a man. Pray let me take your hand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With all the joy in the world.&rdquo; The little poet coloured with
  delight at the flattery. &ldquo;You have saved me, I avow, from the forge and
  anvil of Hephæstus. What a vulgar mob! Do stand apart; then I can try to
  thank you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Aided again by his two protectors, Simonides was soon clear of the
  whirlpool. Under one of the graceful pines, which girded the long stadium, he
  recovered breath and looked at leisure upon his new acquaintances. Both were
  striking men, but in sharp contrast: the taller and darker showed an aquiline
  visage betraying a strain of non-Grecian blood. His black eyes and large
  mouth were very merry. He wore his green chiton with a rakishness that proved
  him anything but a dandy. His companion, addressed as Democrates, slighter,
  blonder, showed Simonides a handsome and truly Greek profile, set off by a
  neatly trimmed reddish beard. His purple-edged cloak fell in statuesque folds
  of the latest mode, his beryl signet-ring, scarlet fillet, and jewelled
  girdle bespoke wealth and taste. His face, too, might have seemed frank and
  affable, had not Simonides suddenly recalled an old proverb about mistrusting
  a man with eyes too close together.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the little poet, quite as ready to pay
  compliments as to take them, &ldquo;let me thank my noble deliverers, for I
  am sure two such valorous young men as you must come of the best blood of
  Attica.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not ashamed of my father, sir,&rdquo; spoke the taller
  Athenian; &ldquo;Hellas has not yet forgotten Miltiades, the victor of
  Marathon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I clasp the hand of Cimon, the son of the saviour of
  Hellas.&rdquo; The little poet&rsquo;s eyes danced. &ldquo;Oh! the pity I was
  in Thessaly so long, and let you grow up in my absence. A noble son of a
  noble father! And your friend&mdash;did you name him Democrates?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fortunate old rascal I am! For I meet Cimon the son of Miltiades,
  and Democrates, that young lieutenant of Themistocles who all the world knows
  is gaining fame already as Nestor and Odysseus, both in one, among the
  orators of Athens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your compliments exceed all truth,&rdquo; exclaimed the second
  Athenian, not at all angered by the praise. But Simonides, whose tongue was
  brisk, ran on with a torrent of flattery and of polite insinuation, until
  Cimon halted him, with a query.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet why, dear Cean, since, as you say, you only arrived this
  afternoon at the Isthmus, were you so anxious to stake that money on
  Glaucon?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why? Because I, like all Greece outside of Sparta, seem to be
  turning Glaucon-mad. All the way from Thessaly&mdash;in B&oelig;otia, in
  Attica, in Megara&mdash;men talked of him, his beauty, his prowess, his
  quarrel with his father, his marriage with Hermione, the divinest maiden in
  Athens, and how he has gone to the games to win both the crown and crusty
  Conon&rsquo;s forgiveness. I tell you, every mule-driver along the way seemed
  to have staked his obol on him. They praise him as &lsquo;fair as Delian
  Apollo,&rsquo; &lsquo;graceful as young Hermes,&rsquo; and&mdash;here I
  wonder most,&mdash;&lsquo;modest as an unwedded girl.&rsquo; &rdquo;
  Simonides drew breath, then faced the others earnestly, &ldquo;You are
  Athenians; do you know him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Know him?&rdquo; Cimon laughed heartily; &ldquo;have we not left
  him at the wrestling ground? Was not Democrates his schoolfellow once, his
  second self to-day? And touching his beauty, his valour, his modesty,&rdquo;
  the young man&rsquo;s eyes shone with loyal enthusiasm, &ldquo;do not say
  &lsquo;over-praised&rsquo; till you have seen him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Simonides swelled with delight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, lucky genius that cast me with you! Take me to him this
  moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is so beset with admirers, his trainers are angry already;
  besides, he is still at the wrestling ground.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But soon returns to his tents,&rdquo; added Democrates, instantly;
  &ldquo;and Simonides&mdash;is Simonides. If Themistocles and Leonidas can see
  Glaucon, so must the first poet of Hellas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O dearest orator,&rdquo; cried the little man, with an arm around
  his neck, &ldquo;I begin to love you already. Away this moment, that I may
  worship your new divinity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; commanded Cimon, leading off with strides so
  long the bard could hardly follow; &ldquo;his tent is not distant: you shall
  see him, though the trainers change to Gorgons.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The &ldquo;Precinct of Poseidon,&rdquo; the great walled enclosure where
  were the temples, porticos, and the stadium of the Isthmus, was quickly
  behind them. They walked eastward along the sea-shore. The scene about was
  brisk enough, had they heeded. A dozen chariots passed. Under every tall pine
  along the way stood merchants&rsquo; booths, each with a goodly crowd. Now a
  herd of brown goats came, the offering of a pious Phocian; now a band of
  Aphrodite&rsquo;s priestesses from Corinth whirled by in no overdecorous
  dance, to a deafening noise of citharas and castanets. A soft breeze was
  sending the brown-sailed fisher boats across the heaving bay. Straight before
  the three spread the white stuccoed houses of Cenchræa, the eastern haven of
  Corinth; far ahead in smooth semicircle rose the green crests of the Argive
  mountains, while to their right upreared the steep lonely pyramid of brown
  rock, Acro-Corinthus, the commanding citadel of the thriving city. But above,
  beyond these, fairer than them all, spread the clear, sun-shot azure of
  Hellas, the like whereof is not over any other land, save as that land is
  girt by the crisp foam of the blue Ægean Sea.</p>

  <p>So much for the picture, but Simonides, having seen it often, saw it not
  at all, but plied the others with questions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So this Hermione of his is beautiful?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like Aphrodite rising from the sea foam.&rdquo; The answer came
  from Democrates, who seemed to look away, avoiding the poet&rsquo;s keen
  glance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And yet her father gave her to the son of his bitter
  enemy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hermippus of Eleusis is sensible. It is a fine thing to have the
  handsomest man in Hellas for son-in-law.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now to the great marvel&mdash;did Glaucon truly seek her not
  for dowry, nor rank, but for sheer love?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Marriages for love are in fashion to-day,&rdquo; said Democrates,
  with a side glance at Cimon, whose sister Elpinice had just made a love match
  with Callias the Rich, to the scandal of all the prudes in Athens.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I meet marvels even in my old age. Another Odysseus and his
  Penelope! And he is handsome, valiant, high-minded, with a wife his peer? You
  raise my hopes too high. They will be dashed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They will not,&rdquo; protested Democrates, with every sign of
  loyalty; &ldquo;turn here: this lane in the pines leads to his tent. If we
  have praised too much, doom us to the labours of Tantalus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But here their progress was stopped. A great knot of people were swarming
  about a statue under a pine tree, and shrill, angry voices proclaimed not
  trafficking, but a brawl.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. -- THE ATHLETE</h2>

  <p class="first">There was ceaseless coming and going outside the Precinct of
  Poseidon. Following much the same path just taken by Simonides and his new
  friends, two other men were walking, so deep in talk that they hardly heeded
  how many made respectful way for them, or how many greeted them. The taller
  and younger man, to be sure, returned every salute with a graceful flourish
  of his hands, but in a mechanical way, and with eye fixed on his
  companion.</p>

  <p>The pair were markedly contrasted. The younger was in his early prime,
  strong, well developed, and daintily dressed. His gestures were quick and
  eloquent. His brown beard and hair were trimmed short to reveal a clear olive
  face&mdash;hardly regular, but expressive and tinged with an extreme
  subtilty. When he laughed, in a strange, silent way, it was to reveal fine
  teeth, while his musical tongue ran on, never waiting for answer.</p>

  <p>His comrade, however, answered little. He barely rose to the other&rsquo;s
  shoulder, but he had the chest and sinews of an ox. Graces there were none.
  His face was a scarred ravine, half covered by scanty stubble. The forehead
  was low. The eyes, gray and wise, twinkled from tufted eyebrows. The long
  gray hair was tied about his forehead in a braid and held by a golden
  circlet. The &ldquo;chlamys&rdquo; around his hips was purple but dirty. To
  his companion&rsquo;s glib Attic he returned only Doric monosyllables.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thus I have explained: if my plans prosper; if Corcyra and Syracuse
  send aid; if Xerxes has trouble in provisioning his army, not merely can we
  resist Persia, but conquer with ease. Am I too sanguine, Leonidas?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No doubt Xerxes will find his fleet untrustworthy. The Egyptian
  sailors hate the Ph&oelig;nicians. Therefore we can risk a sea
  fight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No rashness, Themistocles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;it is dicing against the Fates, and the stake is the
  freedom of Hellas. Still a battle must be risked. If we quit ourselves
  bravely, our names shall be remembered as long as
  Agamemnon&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or Priam&rsquo;s?&mdash;his Troy was sacked.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you, my dear king of Sparta, will of course move heaven and
  earth to have your Ephors and Council somewhat more forward than of late in
  preparing for war? We all count on you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will try.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who can ask more? But now make an end to statecraft. We were
  speaking about the pentathlon and the chances of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here the same brawling voices that had arrested Simonides broke upon
  Themistocles and Leonidas also. The cry &ldquo;A fight!&rdquo; was producing
  its inevitable result. Scores of men, and those not the most aristocratic,
  were running pell-mell whither so many had thronged already. In the confusion
  scant reverence was paid the king of Sparta and the first statesman of
  Athens, who were thrust unceremoniously aside and were barely witnesses of
  what followed.</p>

  <p>The outcry was begun, after-report had it, by a Sicyonian bronze-dealer
  finding a small but valuable lamp missing from the table whereon he showed
  his wares. Among the dozen odd persons pressing about the booth his eye
  singled out a slight, handsome boy in Oriental dress; and since Syrian
  serving-lads were proverbially light-fingered, the Sicyonian jumped quickly
  at his conclusion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seize the Barbarian thief!&rdquo; had been his shout as he leaped
  and snatched the alleged culprit&rsquo;s mantle. The boy escaped easily by
  the frailness of his dress, which tore in the merchant&rsquo;s hands; but a
  score of bystanders seized the fugitive and dragged him back to the
  Sicyonian, whose order to &ldquo;search!&rdquo; would have been promptly
  obeyed; but at this instant he stumbled over the missing lamp on the ground
  before the table, whence probably it had fallen. The bronze-dealer was now
  mollified, and would willingly have released the lad, but a Spartan bystander
  was more zealous.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a Barbarian thief and spy!&rdquo; he began bellowing;
  &ldquo;he dropped the lamp when he was detected! Have him to the temple and
  to the wardens of the games!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The magic word &ldquo;spy&rdquo; let loose the tongues and passions of
  every man within hearing. The unfortunate lad was seized again and jostled
  rudely, while questions rattled over him like hailstones.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whose slave are you? Why here? Where&rsquo;s your master? Where did
  you get that outlandish dress and gold-laced turban? Confess,
  confess,&mdash;or it&rsquo;ll be whipped out of you! What villany are you up
  to?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>If the prisoner had understood Greek,&mdash;which was doubtful,&mdash;he
  could scarce have comprehended this babel. He struggled vainly; tears started
  to his eyes. Then he committed a blunder. Not attempting a protest, he thrust
  a small hand into his crimson belt and drew forth a handful of gold as bribe
  for release.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A slave with ten darics!&rdquo; bawled the officious Spartan, never
  relaxing his grip. &ldquo;Hark you, friends, it&rsquo;s plain as day.
  Dexippus of Corinth has a Syrian lad like this. The young scoundrel&rsquo;s
  robbed his master and is running away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! A runaway! To the temple with him!&rdquo; chimed a
  dozen. The prisoner&rsquo;s outcries were drowned. He would have been swept
  off in ungentle custody had not a strong hand intervened in his favor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A moment, good citizens,&rdquo; called a voice in clear Attic.
  &ldquo;Release this lad. I know Dexippus&rsquo;s slave; he&rsquo;s no such
  fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The others, low-browed Spartans mostly, turned, ill-pleased at the
  interruption of an Athenian, but shrank a step as a name went among them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Castor and Pollux&mdash;it&rsquo;s Glaucon the
  Beautiful!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With two thrusts of impetuous elbows, the young man was at the assailed
  lad&rsquo;s side. The newcomer was indeed a sight for gods. Beauty and power
  seemed wholly met in a figure of perfect symmetry and strength. A face of
  fine regularity, a chiselled profile, smooth cheeks, deep blue eyes, a crown
  of closely cropped auburn hair, a chin neither weak nor stern, a skin burnt
  brown by the sun of the wrestling schools&mdash;these were parts of the
  picture, and the whole was how much fairer than any part! Aroused now, he
  stood with head cast back and a scarlet cloak shaking gracefully from his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unhand the lad!&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

  <p>For a moment, compelled by his beauty, the Spartans yielded. The Oriental
  pressed against his protector; but the affair was not to end so easily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hark you, Sir Athenian,&rdquo; rejoined the Spartan leader,
  &ldquo;don&rsquo;t presume on your good looks. Our Lycon will mar them all
  to-morrow. Here&rsquo;s Dexippus&rsquo;s slave or else a Barbarian spy: in
  either case to the temple with him, and don&rsquo;t you hinder.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He plucked at the boy&rsquo;s girdle; but the athlete extended one slim
  hand, seized the Spartan&rsquo;s arm, and with lightning dexterity laid the
  busybody flat on Mother Earth. He staggered upward, raging and calling on his
  fellows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sparta insulted by Athens! Vengeance, men of Lacedæmon! Fists!
  Fists!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The fate of the Oriental was forgotten in the storm of patriotic fury that
  followed. Fortunately no one had a weapon. Half a dozen burly Laconians
  precipitated themselves without concert or order upon the athlete. He was
  hidden a moment in the rush of flapping gowns and tossing arms. Then like a
  rock out of the angry sea shone his golden head, as he shook off the attack.
  Two men were on their backs, howling. The others stood at respectful
  distance, cursing and meditating another rush. An Athenian pottery merchant
  from a neighbouring booth began trumpeting through his hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Men of Athens, this way!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His numerous countrymen came scampering from far and wide. Men snatched up
  stones and commenced snapping off pine boughs for clubs. The athlete, centre
  of all this din, stood smiling, with his glorious head held high, his eyes
  alight with the mere joy of battle. He held out his arms. Both pose and face
  spoke as clearly as words,&mdash;&ldquo;Prove me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sparta is insulted. Away with the braggart!&rdquo; the Laconians
  were clamouring. The Athenians answered in kind. Already a dark sailor was
  drawing a dirk. Everything promised broken heads, and perhaps blood, when
  Leonidas and his friend,&mdash;by laying about them with their
  staves,&mdash;won their way to the front. The king dashed his staff upon the
  shoulder of a strapping Laconian who was just hurling himself on Glaucon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fools! Hold!&rdquo; roared Leonidas, and the moment the throng saw
  what newcomers they faced, Athenian and Spartan let their arms drop and stood
  sheepish and silent. Themistocles instantly stepped forward and held up his
  hand. His voice, trumpet-clear, rang out among the pines. In three sentences
  he dissolved the tumult.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fellow-Hellenes, do not let Dame Discord make sport of you. I saw
  all that befell. It is only an unlucky misunderstanding. You are quite
  satisfied, I am sure, Master Bronze-Dealer?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Sicyonian, who saw in a riot the ruin of his evening&rsquo;s trade,
  nodded gladly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He says there was no thieving, and he is entirely satisfied. He
  thanks you for your friendly zeal. The Oriental was not Dexippus&rsquo;s
  slave, and Xerxes does not need such boys for spies. I am certain Glaucon
  would not insult Sparta. So let us part without bad blood, and await the
  judgment of the god in the contest to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Not a voice answered him. The crash of music from the sacrificial embassy
  of Syracuse diverted everybody&rsquo;s attention; most of the company
  streamed away to follow the flower-decked chariots and cattle back to the
  temple. Themistocles and Leonidas were left almost alone to approach the
  athlete.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are ever Glaucon the Fortunate,&rdquo; laughed Themistocles;
  &ldquo;had we not chanced this way, what would not have befallen?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, it was delightful,&rdquo; rejoined the athlete, his eyes still
  kindled; &ldquo;the shock, the striving, the putting one&rsquo;s own strength
  and will against many and feeling &lsquo;I am the stronger.&rsquo;
  &rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Delightful, no doubt&rdquo; replied the statesman, &ldquo;though
  Zeus spare me fighting one against ten! But what god possessed you to meddle
  in this brawl, and imperil all chances for to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was returning from practice at the palæstra. I saw the lad beset
  and knew he was not Dexippus&rsquo;s slave. I ran to help him. I thought no
  more about it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And risked everything for a sly-eyed Oriental. Where is the
  rascal?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the lad&mdash;author of the commotion&mdash;had disappeared
  completely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Behold his fair gratitude to his rescuer,&rdquo; cried
  Themistocles, sourly, and then he turned to Leonidas. &ldquo;Well, very noble
  king of Sparta, you were asking to see Glaucon and judge his chances in the
  pentathlon. Your Laconians have just proved him; are you
  satisfied?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the king, without a word of greeting, ran his eyes over the athlete
  from head to heel, then blurted out his verdict:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too pretty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon blushed like a maid. Themistocles threw up his hands in
  deprecation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But were not Achilles and many another hero beautiful as brave?
  Does not Homer call them so many times &lsquo;godlike&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poetry doesn&rsquo;t win the pentathlon,&rdquo; retorted the king;
  then suddenly he seized the athlete&rsquo;s right arm near the shoulder. The
  muscles cracked. Glaucon did not wince. The king dropped the arm with a
  &ldquo;<i>Euge!</i>&rdquo; then extended his own hand, the fingers half
  closed, and ordered, &ldquo;Open.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>One long minute, just as Simonides and his companions approached, Athenian
  and Spartan stood face to face, hand locked in hand, while Glaucon&rsquo;s
  forehead grew redder, not with blushing. Then blood rushed to the
  king&rsquo;s brow also. His fingers were crimson. They had been forced
  open.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Euge!</i>&rdquo; cried the king, again; then, to Themistocles,
  &ldquo;He will do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whereupon, as if satisfied in his object and averse to further dalliance,
  he gave Cimon and his companions the stiffest of nods and deliberately turned
  on his heel. Speech was too precious coin for him to be wasted on mere
  adieus. Only over his shoulder he cast at Glaucon a curt mandate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hate Lycon. Grind his bones.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles, however, lingered a moment to greet Simonides. The little
  poet was delighted, despite overweening hopes, at the manly beauty yet
  modesty of the athlete, and being a man who kept his thoughts always near his
  tongue, made Glaucon blush more manfully than ever.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Master Simonides is overkind,&rdquo; had ventured the athlete;
  &ldquo;but I am sure his praise is only polite compliment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What misunderstanding!&rdquo; ran on the poet. &ldquo;How you pain
  me! I truly desired to ask a question. Is it not a great delight to know that
  so many people are gladdened just by looking on you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How dare I answer? If &lsquo;no,&rsquo; I contradict you&mdash;very
  rude. If &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; I praise myself&mdash;far ruder.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cleverly turned. The face of Paris, the strength of Achilles, the
  wit of Periander, all met in one body;&rdquo; but seeing the athlete&rsquo;s
  confusion more profound than ever, the Cean cut short. &ldquo;Heracles! if my
  tongue wounds you, lo! it&rsquo;s clapped back in its sheath; I&rsquo;ll be
  revenged in an ode of fifty iambs on your victory. For that you will conquer,
  neither I nor any sane man in Hellas has the least doubt. Are you not
  confident, dear Athenian?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am confident in the justice of the gods, noble Simonides,&rdquo;
  said the athlete, half childishly, half in deep seriousness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well you may be. The gods are usually &lsquo;just&rsquo; to such as
  you. It&rsquo;s we graybeards that Tyche, &lsquo;Lady Fortune,&rsquo; grows
  tired of helping.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps!&rdquo; Glaucon passed his hand across his eyes with a
  dreamy gesture. &ldquo;Yet sometimes I almost say, &lsquo;Welcome a
  misfortune, if not too terrible,&rsquo; just to ward off the god&rsquo;s
  jealousy of too great prosperity. In all things, save my father&rsquo;s
  anger, I have prospered. To-morrow I can appease that, too. Yet you know
  Solon&rsquo;s saying, &lsquo;Call no man fortunate till he is dead.&rsquo;
  &rdquo;</p>

  <p>Simonides was charmed at this frank confession on first acquaintance.
  &ldquo;Yes, but even one of the Seven Sages can err.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not know. I only hope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Glaucon,&rdquo; admonished Democrates. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
  no worse dinner before a contest than one of flighty thoughts. When safe in
  Athens&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In Eleusis you mean,&rdquo; corrected the athlete.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pest take you,&rdquo; cried Cimon; &ldquo;you say Eleusis because
  there is Hermione. But make this day-dreaming end ere you come to grips with
  Lycon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He will awaken,&rdquo; smiled Themistocles. Then, with another
  gracious nod to Simonides, the statesman hastened after Leonidas, leaving the
  three young men and the poet to go to Glaucon&rsquo;s tent in the pine
  grove.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And why should Leonidas wish Glaucon to grind the bones of the
  champion of Sparta?&rdquo; asked Cimon, curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quickly answered,&rdquo; replied Simonides, who knew half the
  persons of the nobility in Hellas; &ldquo;first, Lycon is of the rival kingly
  house at Sparta; second, he&rsquo;s suspected of &lsquo;Medizing,&rsquo; of
  favouring Persia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that story of &lsquo;Medizing,&rsquo; &rdquo;
  interrupted Democrates, promptly; &ldquo;I can assure you it is not
  true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Enough if he&rsquo;s suspected,&rdquo; cried the uncompromising son
  of Miltiades; &ldquo;honest Hellenes should not even be blown upon in times
  like this. Another reason then for hating him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; ordered Glaucon, as if starting from a long revery,
  and with a sweep of his wonderful hands; &ldquo;let the Medes, the Persians,
  and their war wait. For me the only war is the pentathlon,&mdash;and then by
  Zeus&rsquo;s favour the victory, the glory, the return to Eleusis!
  Ah&mdash;wish me joy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Verily, the man is mad,&rdquo; reflected the poet; &ldquo;he lives
  in his own bright world, sufficient to himself. May Zeus never send storms to
  darken it! For to bear disaster his soul seems never made.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At the tent Manes, the athlete&rsquo;s body-servant, came
  running to his master, with a small box firmly bound.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A strange dark man brought this only a moment since. It is for
  Master Glaucon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On opening there was revealed a bracelet of Egyptian turquoise; the price
  thereof Simonides wisely set at two minæ. Nothing betrayed the identity of
  the giver save a slip of papyrus written in Greek, but in very uncertain
  hand. &ldquo;<i>To the Beautiful Champion of Athens: from one he has greatly
  served.</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cimon held the bracelet on high, admiring its perfect lustre.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Themistocles was wrong,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;the Oriental was
  not ungrateful. But what &lsquo;slave&rsquo; or &lsquo;lad&rsquo; was this
  that Glaucon succoured?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; insinuated Simonides, &ldquo;Themistocles was wrong
  yet again. Who knows if a stranger giving such gifts be not sent forth by
  Xerxes?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t chatter foolishness,&rdquo; commanded Democrates,
  almost peevishly; but Glaucon replaced the bracelet in the casket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Since the god sends this, I will rejoice in it,&rdquo; he declared
  lightly. &ldquo;A fair omen for to-morrow, and it will shine rarely on
  Hermione&rsquo;s arm.&rdquo; The mention of that lady called forth new
  protests from Cimon, but he in turn was interrupted, for a half-grown boy had
  entered the tent and stood beckoning to Democrates.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. -- THE HAND OF PERSIA</h2>

  <p class="first">The lad who sidled up to Democrates was all but a hunchback.
  His bare arms were grotesquely tattooed, clear sign that he was a Thracian.
  His eyes twinkled keenly, uneasily, as in token of an almost sinister
  intelligence. What he whispered to Democrates escaped the rest, but the
  latter began girding up his cloak.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You leave us, <i>philotate</i>?&rdquo; cried Glaucon. &ldquo;Would
  I not have all my friends with me to-night, to fill me with fair thoughts for
  the morrow? Bid your ugly Bias keep away!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A greater friend than even Glaucon the Alcmæonid commands me
  hence,&rdquo; said the orator, smiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Declare his name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Declare <i>her</i> name,&rdquo; cried Simonides, viciously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Noble Cean, then I say I serve a most beautiful, high-born dame.
  Her name is Athens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curses on your public business,&rdquo; lamented Glaucon. &ldquo;But
  off with you, since your love is the love of us all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates kissed the athlete on both cheeks. &ldquo;I leave you to
  faithful guardians. Last night I dreamed of a garland of lilies, sure presage
  of a victory. So take courage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Chaire! chaire!</i>&rdquo;(1) called the rest; and Democrates
  left the tent to follow the slave-boy.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[1 A word conveying at once &ldquo;welcome!&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;farewell!&rdquo;]</p>

  <p>Evening was falling: the sea, rocks, fields, pine groves, were touched by
  the red glow dying behind Acro-Corinthus. Torches gleamed amid the trees
  where the multitudes were buying, selling, wagering, making merry. All Greece
  seemed to have sent its wares to be disposed of at the Isthmia. Democrates
  idled along, now glancing at the huckster who displayed his painted clay
  dolls and urged the sightseers to remember the little ones at home. A
  wine-seller thrust a sample cup of a choice vintage under the
  Athenian&rsquo;s nose, and vainly adjured him to buy. Thessalian easy-chairs,
  pottery, slaves kidnapped from the Black Sea, occupied one booth after
  another. On a pulpit before a bellowing crowd a pair of marionettes were
  rolling their eyes and gesticulating, as a woman pulled the strings.</p>

  <p>But there were more exalted entertainments. A rhapsodist stood on a pine
  stump chanting in excellent voice Alcæus&rsquo;s hymn to Apollo. And more
  willingly the orator stopped on the edge of a throng of the better sort,
  which listened to a man of noble aspect reading in clear voice from his
  scroll.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Æschylus of Athens,&rdquo; whispered a bystander. &ldquo;He reads
  choruses of certain tragedies he says he will perfect and produce much
  later.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates knew the great dramatist well, but what he read was new&mdash;a
  &ldquo;Song of the Furies&rdquo; calling a terrific curse upon the betrayer
  of friendship. &ldquo;Some of his happiest lines,&rdquo; meditated
  Democrates, walking away, to be held a moment by the crowd around Lamprus the
  master-harpist. But now, feeling that he had dallied long enough, the orator
  turned his back on the two female acrobats who were swinging on a trapeze and
  struck down a long, straight road which led toward the distant cone of
  Acro-Corinthus. First, however, he turned on Bias, who all the time had been
  accompanying, dog-fashion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You say he is waiting at Hegias&rsquo;s inn?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, master. It&rsquo;s by the temple of Bellerophon, just as you
  begin to enter the city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good! I don&rsquo;t want to ask the way. Now catch this obol and be
  off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The boy snatched the flying coin and glided into the crowd.</p>

  <p>Democrates walked briskly out of the glare of the torches, then halted to
  slip the hood of his cloak up about his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The road is dark, but the wise man shuns accidents,&rdquo; was his
  reflection, as he strode in the direction pointed by Bias.</p>

  <p>The way was dark. No moon; and even the brilliant starlight of summer in
  Hellas is an uncertain guide. Democrates knew he was traversing a long avenue
  lined by spreading cypresses, with a shimmer of white from some tall,
  sepulchral monument. Then through the dimness loomed the high columns of a
  temple, and close beside it pale light spread out upon the road as from an
  inn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hegias&rsquo;s inn,&rdquo; grumbled the Athenian. &ldquo;Zeus grant
  it have no more fleas than most inns of Corinth!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At sound of his footsteps the door opened promptly, without knocking. A
  squalid scene revealed itself,&mdash;a white-washed room, an earthen floor,
  two clay lamps on a low table, a few stools,&mdash;but a tall, lean man in
  Oriental dress greeted the Athenian with a salaam which showed his own gold
  earrings, swarthy skin, and black mustache.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fair greetings, Hiram,&rdquo; spoke the orator, no wise amazed,
  &ldquo;and where is your master?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At service,&rdquo; came a deep voice from a corner, so dark that
  Democrates had not seen the couch where lolled an ungainly figure that now
  rose clumsily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hail, Democrates.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hail, Lycon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hand joined in hand; then Lycon ordered the Oriental to &ldquo;fetch the
  noble Athenian some good Thasian wine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will join me?&rdquo; urged the orator.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alas! no. I am still in training. Nothing but cheese and porridge
  till after the victory to-morrow; but then, by Castor, I&rsquo;ll enjoy
  &lsquo;the gentleman&rsquo;s disease&rsquo;&mdash;a jolly
  drunkenness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you are sure of victory to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Democrates, what god has tricked you into believing your fine
  Athenian has a chance?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have seven minæ staked on Glaucon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seven staked in the presence of your friends; how many in their
  absence?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates reddened. He was glad the room was dark. &ldquo;I am not here
  to quarrel about the pentathlon,&rdquo; he said emphatically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, very well. Leave your dear sparrow to my gentle hands.&rdquo;
  The Spartan&rsquo;s huge paws closed significantly: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the
  wine. Sit and drink. And you, Hiram, get to your corner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Oriental silently squatted in the gloom, the gleam of his beady eyes
  just visible. Lycon sat on a stool beside his guest, his Cyclops-like limbs
  sprawling down upon the floor. Scarred and brutish, indeed, was his face, one
  ear missing, the other beaten flat by boxing gloves; but Democrates had a
  distinct feeling that under his battered visage and wiry black hair lurked
  greater penetration of human motive and more ability to play therewith than
  the chance observer might allow. The Athenian deliberately waited his
  host&rsquo;s first move.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The wine is good, Democrates?&rdquo; began Lycon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excellent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I presume you have arranged your wagers to-morrow with your usual
  prudence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you know about them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my invaluable Hiram, who arranged this interview for us through
  Bias, has made himself a brother to all the betting masters. I understand you
  have arranged it so that whether Glaucon wins or loses you will be none the
  poorer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Athenian set down his cup.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because I would not let my dear friend&rsquo;s sanguine
  expectations blind all my judgment is no reason why you should seek this
  interview, Lycon,&rdquo; he rejoined tartly. &ldquo;If this is the object of
  your summons, I&rsquo;m better back in my own tent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lycon tilted back against the table. His speech was nothing curt or
  &ldquo;Laconic&rdquo;; it was even drawling. &ldquo;On the contrary, dear
  Democrates, I was only commending your excellent foresight, something that I
  see characterizes all you do. You are the friend of Glaucon. Since Aristeides
  has been banished, only Themistocles exceeds you in influence over the
  Athenians. Therefore, as a loyal Athenian you must support your champion.
  Likewise, as a man of judgment you must see that I&mdash;though this
  pentathlon is only a by-play, not my business&mdash;will probably break your
  Glaucon&rsquo;s back to-morrow. It is precisely this good judgment on your
  part which makes me sure I do well to ask an interview&mdash;for something
  else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then quickly to business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A few questions. I presume Themistocles to-day conferred with
  Leonidas?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t present with them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But in due time Themistocles will tell you everything?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates chewed his beard, not answering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Pheu!</i> you don&rsquo;t pretend Themistocles distrusts
  you?&rdquo; cried the Spartan.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like your questions, Lycon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am very sorry. I&rsquo;ll cease them. I only wished to-night to
  call to your mind the advantage of two such men as you and I becoming
  friends. I may be king of Lacedæmon before long.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knew that before, but where&rsquo;s your chariot
  driving?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear Athenian, the Persian chariot is now driving toward Hellas. We
  cannot halt it. Then let us be so wise that it does not pass over
  us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; Democrates spilled the cup as he started. &ldquo;No
  &lsquo;Medizing&rsquo; talk before me. Am I not Themistocles&rsquo;s
  friend?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Themistocles and Leonidas will seem valiant fools after Xerxes
  comes. Men of foresight&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are never traitors.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beloved Democrates,&rdquo; sneered the Spartan, &ldquo;in one year
  the most patriotic Hellene will be he who has made the Persian yoke the most
  endurable. Don&rsquo;t blink at destiny.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be overcertain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t grow deaf and blind. Xerxes has been collecting troops
  these four years. Every wind across the Ægean tells how the Great King
  assembles millions of soldiers, thousands of ships: Median cavalry, Assyrian
  archers, Egyptian battle-axemen&mdash;the best troops in the world. All the
  East will be marching on our poor Hellas. And when has Persia failed to
  conquer?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At Marathon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A drop of rain before the tempest! If Datis, the Persian general,
  had only been more prudent!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Clearly, noblest Lycon,&rdquo; said Democrates, with a satirical
  smile, &ldquo;for a taciturn Laconian to become thus eloquent for tyranny
  must have taken a bribe of ten thousand gold darics.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But answer my arguments.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;the old oracle is proved: &lsquo;Base love of gain and
  naught else shall bear sore destruction to Sparta.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t halt Xerxes&rsquo;s advance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An end to your croakings,&rdquo;&mdash;Democrates was becoming
  angry,&mdash;&ldquo;I know the Persian&rsquo;s power well enough. Now why
  have you summoned me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lycon looked on his visitor long and hard. He reminded the Athenian
  disagreeably of a huge cat just considering whether a mouse were near enough
  to risk a spring.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I sent for you because I wished you to give a pledge.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in no mood to give it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You need not refuse. Giving or withholding the fate of Hellas will
  not be altered, save as you wish to make it so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What must I promise?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That you will not reveal the presence in Greece of a man I intend
  to set before you.&rdquo; Another silence. Democrates knew even then, if
  vaguely, that he was making a decision on which might hinge half his future.
  In the after days he looked back on this instant with unspeakable regret. But
  the Laconian sat before him, smiling, sneering, commanding by his more
  dominant will. The Athenian answered, it seemed, despite himself:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it is not to betray Hellas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I promise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swear it then by your native Athena.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Democrates&mdash;perhaps the wine was strong&mdash;lifted his right
  hand and swore by Athena Polias of Athens he would betray no secret.</p>

  <p>Lycon arose with what was part bellow, part laugh. Even then the orator
  was moved to call back the pledge, but the Spartan acted too swiftly. The
  short moments which followed stamped themselves on Democrates&rsquo;s memory.
  The flickering lamps, the squalid room, the long, dense shadows, the ungainly
  movements of the Spartan, who was opening a door,&mdash;all this passed after
  the manner of a vision. And as in a vision Democrates saw a stranger stepping
  through the inner portal, as at Lycon&rsquo;s summons&mdash;a man of no huge
  stature, but masterful in eye and mien. Another Oriental, but not as the
  obsequious Hiram. Here was a lord to command and be obeyed. Gems flashed from
  the scarlet turban, the green jacket was embroidered with pearls&mdash;and
  was not half the wealth of Corinth in the jewels studding the sword hilt?
  Tight trousers and high shoes of tanned leather set off a form supple and
  powerful as a panther&rsquo;s. Unlike most Orientals the stranger was fair. A
  blond beard swept his breast. His eyes were sharp, steel-blue. Never a word
  spoke he; but Democrates looked on him with wide eyes, then turned almost in
  awe to the Spartan.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is a prince&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His Highness Prince Abairah of Cyprus,&rdquo; completed Lycon,
  rapidly, &ldquo;now come to visit the Isthmian Games, and later your Athens.
  It is for this I have brought you face to face&mdash;that he may be welcome
  in your city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Athenian cast at the stranger a glance of keenest scrutiny. He knew by
  every instinct in his being that Lycon was telling a barefaced lie. Why he
  did not cry out as much that instant he hardly himself knew. But the gaze of
  the &ldquo;Cyprian&rdquo; pierced through him, fascinating, magnetizing, and
  Lycon&rsquo;s great hand was on his victim&rsquo;s shoulder. The
  &ldquo;Cyprian&rsquo;s&rdquo; own hand went out seeking
  Democrates&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall be very glad to see the noble Athenian in his own city. His
  fame for eloquence and prudence is already in Tyre and Babylon,&rdquo; spoke
  the stranger, never taking his steel-blue eyes from the orator&rsquo;s face.
  The accent was Oriental, but the Greek was fluent. The prince&mdash;for
  prince he was, whatever his nation&mdash;pressed his hand closer. Almost
  involuntarily Democrates&rsquo;s hand responded. They clasped tightly; then,
  as if Lycon feared a word too much, the unknown released his hold, bowed with
  inimitable though silent courtesy, and was gone behind the door whence he had
  come.</p>

  <p>It had taken less time than men use to count a hundred. The latch clicked.
  Democrates gazed blankly on the door, then turned on Lycon with a start.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your wine was strong. You have bewitched me. What have I done? By
  Zeus of Olympus&mdash;I have given my hand in pledge to a Persian
  spy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;A prince of Cyprus&rsquo;&mdash;did you not hear
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cerberus eat me if that man has seen Cyprus. No Cyprian is so
  blond. The man is Xerxes&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall see, friend; we shall see: &lsquo;Day by day we grow old,
  and day by day we grow wiser.&rsquo; So your own Solon puts it, I
  think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates drew himself up angrily. &ldquo;I know my duty; I&rsquo;ll
  denounce you to Leonidas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You gave a pledge and oath.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It were a greater crime to keep than to break it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lycon shrugged his huge shoulders. &ldquo;<i>Eu!</i> I hardly trusted to
  that. But I do trust to Hiram&rsquo;s pretty story about your bets, and still
  more to a tale that&rsquo;s told about where and how you&rsquo;ve borrowed
  money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates&rsquo;s voice shook either with rage or with fear when he made
  shift to answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see I&rsquo;ve come to be incriminated and insulted. So be it. If
  I keep my pledge, at least suffer me to wish you and your
  &lsquo;Cyprian&rsquo; a very good night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lycon good-humouredly lighted him to the door. &ldquo;Why so hot?
  I&rsquo;ll do you a service to-morrow. If Glaucon wrestles with me, I shall
  kill him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shall I thank the murderer of my friend?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Even when that friend has wronged you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silence! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Even in the flickering lamplight Democrates could see the Spartan&rsquo;s
  evil smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;Hermione.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silence, by the infernal gods! Who are you, Cyclops, for
  <i>her</i>name to cross your teeth?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not angry. Yet you will thank me to-morrow. The
  pentathlon will be merely a pleasant flute-playing before the great
  war-drama. You will see more of the &lsquo;Cyprian&rsquo; at
  Athens&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates heard no more. Forth from that wine-house he ran into the
  sheltering night, till safe under the shadow of the black cypresses. His head
  glowed. His heart throbbed. He had been partner in foulest treason. Duty to
  friend, duty to country,&mdash;oath or no oath,&mdash;should have sent him to
  Leonidas. What evil god had tricked him into that interview? Yet he did not
  denounce the traitor. Not his oath held him back, but benumbing
  fear,&mdash;and what sting lay back of Lycon&rsquo;s hints and threats the
  orator knew best. And how if Lycon made good his boast and killed Glaucon on
  the morrow?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. -- THE PENTATHLON</h2>

  <p class="first">In a tent at the lower end of the long stadium stood Glaucon
  awaiting the final summons to his ordeal. His friends had just cried farewell
  for the last time: Cimon had kissed him; Themistocles had gripped his hand;
  Democrates had called &ldquo;Zeus prosper you!&rdquo; Simonides had vowed
  that he was already hunting for the metres of a triumphal ode. The roar from
  without told how the stadium was filled with its chattering thousands. The
  athlete&rsquo;s trainers were bestowing their last officious advice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Spartan will surely win the quoit-throw. Do not be troubled. In
  everything else you can crush him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beware of M&oelig;rocles of Mantinea. He&rsquo;s a knavish fellow;
  his backers are recalling their bets. But he hopes to win on a trick; beware,
  lest he trip you in the foot-race.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aim low when you hurl the javelin. Your dart always
  rises.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon received this and much more admonition with his customary smile.
  There was no flush on the forehead, no flutter of the heart. A few hours
  later he would be crowned with all the glory which victory in the great games
  could throw about a Hellene, or be buried in the disgrace to which his
  ungenerous people consigned the vanquished. But, in the words of his day,
  &ldquo;he knew himself&rdquo; and his own powers. From the day he quitted
  boyhood he had never met the giant he could not master; the Hermes he could
  not outrun. He anticipated victory as a matter of course, even victory
  wrested from Lycon, and his thoughts seemed wandering far from the tawny
  track where he must face his foes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Athens,&mdash;my father,&mdash;my wife! I will win glory for them
  all!&rdquo; was the drift of his revery.</p>

  <p>The younger rubber grunted under breath at his athlete&rsquo;s vacant eye,
  but Pytheas, the older of the pair, whispered confidently that &ldquo;when he
  had known Master Glaucon longer, he would know that victories came his way,
  just by reaching out his hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Athena grant it,&rdquo; muttered the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
  my half mina staked on him, too.&rdquo; Then from the tents at either side
  began the ominous call of the heralds:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Amyntas of Thebes, come you forth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ctesias of Epidaurus, come you forth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lycon of Sparta, come you forth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon held out his hands. Each trainer seized one.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wish me joy and honour, good friends!&rdquo; cried the athlete.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poseidon and Athena aid you!&rdquo; And Pytheas&rsquo;s honest
  voice was husky. This was the greatest ordeal of his favourite pupil, and the
  trainer&rsquo;s soul would go with him into the combat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon of Athens, come you forth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The curtains of the tent swept aside. An intense sunlight sprang to meet
  the Athenian. He passed into the arena clad only in his coat of glistering
  oil. Scolus of Thasos and M&oelig;rocles of Mantinea joined the other four
  athletes; then, escorted each by a herald swinging his myrtle wand, the six
  went down the stadium to the stand of the judges.</p>

  <p>Before the fierce light of a morning in Hellas beating down on him,
  Glaucon the Alcmæonid was for an instant blinded, and walked on passively,
  following his guide. Then, as from a dissolving mist, the huge stadium began
  to reveal itself: line above line, thousand above thousand of bright-robed
  spectators, a sea of faces, tossing arms, waving garments. A thunderous shout
  rose as the athletes came to view,&mdash;jangling, incoherent; each city
  cheered its champion and tried to cry down all the rest: applause, advice,
  derision. Glaucon heard the derisive hootings, &ldquo;pretty girl,&rdquo;
  &ldquo;pretty pullet,&rdquo; from the serried host of the Laconians along the
  left side of the stadium; but an answering salvo, &ldquo;Dog of
  Cerberus!&rdquo; bawled by the Athenian crowds opposite, and winged at Lycon,
  returned the taunts with usury. As the champions approached the judges&rsquo;
  stand a procession of full twenty pipers, attended by as many fair boys in
  flowing white, marched from the farther end of the stadium to meet them. The
  boys bore cymbals and tambours; the pipers struck up a brisk marching note in
  the rugged Dorian mode. The boys&rsquo; lithe bodies swayed in enchanting
  rhythm. The roaring multitude quieted, admiring their grace. The champions
  and the pipers thus came to the pulpit in the midst of the long arena. The
  president of the judges, a handsome Corinthian in purple and a golden fillet,
  swept his ivory wand from right to left. The marching note ceased. The whole
  company leaped as one man to its feet. The pipes, the cymbals were drowned,
  whilst twenty thousand voices&mdash;Doric, B&oelig;otian,
  Attic&mdash;chorused together the hymn which all Greece knew: the hymn to
  Poseidon of the Isthmus, august guardian of the games.</p>

  <p>Louder it grew; the multitude found one voice, as if it would cry,
  &ldquo;We are Hellenes all; though of many a city, the same fatherland, the
  same gods, the same hope against the Barbarian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Praise we Poseidon the mighty, the monarch,<br>
  Shaker of earth and the harvestless sea;<br>
  King of wide Ægæ and Helicon gladsome<br>
  Twain are the honours high Zeus sheds on thee!<br>
  Thine to be lord of the mettlesome chargers,<br>
  Thine to be lord of swift ships as they wing!<br>
  Guard thou and guide us, dread prince of the billows,<br>
  Safe to their homeland, thy suppliants bring;<br>
  Faring by land or by clamorous waters<br>
  Be thou their way-god to shield, to defend,<br>
  Then shall the smoke of a thousand glad altars,<br>
  To thee in reverent gladness ascend!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Thus in part. And in the hush thereafter the president poured a libation
  from a golden cup, praying, as the wine fell on the brazier beside him, to
  the &ldquo;Earth Shaker,&rdquo; seeking his blessing upon the contestants,
  the multitude, and upon broad Hellas. Next the master-herald announced that
  now, on the third day of the games, came the final and most honoured contest:
  the pentathlon, the fivefold struggle, with the crown to him who conquered
  thrice. He proclaimed the names of the six rivals, their cities, their
  ancestry, and how they had complied with the required training. The president
  took up his tale, and turning to the champions, urged them to strive their
  best, for the eyes of all Hellas were on them. But he warned any man with
  blood-guiltiness upon his soul not to anger the gods by continuing in the
  games.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But since,&rdquo; the brief speech concluded, &ldquo;these men have
  chosen to contend, and have made oath that they are purified or innocent, let
  them join, and Poseidon shed fair glory upon the best!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>More shouting; the pipers paraded the arena, blowing shriller than ever.
  Some of the athletes shifted uneasily. Scolus the Thasian&mdash;youngest of
  the six&mdash;was pale, and cast nervous glances at the towering bulk of
  Lycon. The Spartan gave him no heed, but threw a loud whisper at Glaucon, who
  stood silently beside him:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Castor, son of Conon, you are extremely handsome. If fine looks
  won the battle, I might grow afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Athenian, whose roving eye had just caught Cimon and Democrates in the
  audience, seemed never to hear him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you are passing stalwart. Still, be advised. I wouldn&rsquo;t
  harm you, so drop out early.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Still no answer from Glaucon, whose clear eye seemed now to be wandering
  over the bare hills of Megara beyond.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No answer?&rdquo; persisted the giant. &ldquo;<i>Eu!</i>
  don&rsquo;t complain that you&rsquo;ve lacked warning, when you sit to-night
  in Charon&rsquo;s ferry-boat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The least shadow of a smile flitted across the Athenian&rsquo;s face;
  there was a slight deepening of the light in his eye. He turned his head a
  bit toward Lycon:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The games are not ended, dear Spartan,&rdquo; he observed
  quietly.</p>

  <p>The giant scowled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like you silent, smiling men!
  You&rsquo;re warned. I&rsquo;ll do my worst&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let the leaping begin!&rdquo; rang the voice of the
  president,&mdash;a call that changed all the uproar to a silence in which one
  might hear the wind moving in the firs outside, while every athlete felt his
  muscles tighten.</p>

  <p>The heralds ran down the soft sands to a narrow mound of hardened earth,
  and beckoned to the athletes to follow. In the hands of each contestant were
  set a pair of bronze dumb-bells. The six were arrayed upon the mound with a
  clear reach of sand before. The master-herald proclaimed the order of the
  leaping: that each contestant should spring twice, and he whose leaps were
  the poorest should drop from the other contests.</p>

  <p>Glaucon stood, his golden head thrown back, his eyes wandering idly toward
  his friends in the stadium. He could see Cimon restless on his seat, and
  Simonides holding his cloak and doubtless muttering wise counsel. The
  champion was as calm as his friends were nervous. The stadium had grown
  oppressively still; then broke into along &ldquo;ah!&rdquo; Twenty thousand
  sprang up together as Scolus the Thasian leaped. His partisans cheered, while
  he rose from a sand-cloud; but ceased quickly. His leap had been poor. A
  herald with a pick marked a line where he had landed. The pipers began a
  rollicking catch to which the athletes involuntarily kept time with their
  dumb-bells.</p>

  <p>Glaucon leaped second. Even the hostile Laconians shouted with pleasure at
  sight of his beautiful body poised, then flung out upon the sands far beyond
  the Thasian. He rose, shook off the dust, and returned to the mound, with a
  graceful gesture to the cheer that greeted him; but wise heads knew the
  contest was just beginning.</p>

  <p>Ctesias and Amyntas leaped beyond the Thasian&rsquo;s mark, short of the
  Athenian&rsquo;s. Lycon was fifth. His admirers&rsquo; hopes were high. He
  did not blast them. Huge was his bulk, yet his strength matched it. A cloud
  of dust hid him from view. When it settled, every Laconian was roaring with
  delight. He had passed beyond Glaucon. M&oelig;rocles of Mantinea sprang last
  and badly. The second round was almost as the first; although Glaucon
  slightly surpassed his former effort. Lycon did as well as before. The others
  hardly bettered their early trial. It was long before the Laconians grew
  quiet enough to listen to the call of the herald.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lycon of Sparta wins the leaping. Glaucon of Athens is second.
  Scolus of Thasos leaps the shortest and drops from the pentathlon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again cheers and clamour. The inexperienced Thasian marched disconsolately
  to his tent, pursued by ungenerous jeers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The quoit-hurling follows,&rdquo; once more the herald; &ldquo;each
  contestant throws three quoits. He who throws poorest drops from the
  games.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cimon had risen now. In a momentary lull he trumpeted through his hands
  across the arena.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wake, Glaucon; quit your golden thoughts of Eleusis; Lycon is
  filching the crown.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles, seated near Cimon&rsquo;s side, was staring hard, elbows on
  knees and head on hands. Democrates, next him, was gazing at Glaucon, as if
  the athlete were made of gold; but the object of their fears and hopes gave
  back neither word nor sign.</p>

  <p>The attendants were arraying the five remaining champions at the foot of a
  little rise in the sand, near the judges&rsquo; pulpit. To each was brought a
  bronze quoit, the discus. The pipers resumed their medley. The second contest
  was begun.</p>

  <p>First, Amyntas of Thebes. He took his stand, measured the distance with
  his eye, then with a run flew up the rising, and at its summit his body bent
  double, while the heavy quoit flew away. A noble cast! and twice excelled.
  For a moment every Theban in the stadium was transported. Strangers sitting
  together fell on one another&rsquo;s necks in sheer joy. But the rapture
  ended quickly. Lycon flung second. His vast strength could now tell to the
  uttermost. He was proud to display it. Thrice he hurled. Thrice his discus
  sped out as far as ever man had seen a quoit fly in Hellas. Not even
  Glaucon&rsquo;s best wishers were disappointed when he failed to come within
  three cubits of the Spartan. Ctesias and M&oelig;rocles realized their task
  was hopeless, and strove half heartedly. The friends of the huge Laconian
  were almost beside themselves with joy; while the herald called desperately
  that:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lycon of Sparta wins with the discus. Glaucon of Athens is second.
  Ctesias of Epidaurus throws poorest and drops from the games.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wake, Glaucon!&rdquo; trumpeted Cimon, again his white face shining
  out amid the thousands of gazers now. &ldquo;Wake, or Lycon wins again and
  all is lost!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon was almost beyond earshot; to the frantic entreaty he answered by
  no sign. As he and the Spartan stood once more together, the giant leered on
  him civilly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You grow wise, Athenian. It&rsquo;s honour enough and to spare to
  be second, with Lycon first. <i>Eu!</i>&mdash;and here&rsquo;s the last
  contest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say again, good friend,&rdquo;&mdash;there was a slight closing
  of the Athenian&rsquo;s lips, and deepening in his eyes,&mdash;&ldquo;the
  pentathlon is not ended.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The harpies eat you, then, if you get too bold! The herald is
  calling for the javelin-casting. Come,&mdash;it&rsquo;s time to make an
  end.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But in the deep hush that spread again over the thousands Glaucon turned
  toward the only faces that he saw out of the innumerable host: Themistocles,
  Democrates, Simonides, Cimon. They beheld him raise his arm and lift his
  glorious head yet higher. Glaucon in turn saw Cimon sink into his seat.
  &ldquo;He wakes!&rdquo; was the appeased mutter passing from the son of
  Miltiades and running along every tier of Athenians. And silence deeper than
  ever held the stadium; for now, with Lycon victor twice, the literal turning
  of a finger in the next event might win or lose the parsley crown.</p>

  <p>The Spartan came first. The heralds had set a small scarlet shield at the
  lower end of the course. Lycon poised his light javelin thrice, and thrice
  the slim dart sped through the leathern thong on his fingers. But not for
  glory. Perchance this combat was too delicate an art for his ungainly hands.
  Twice the missile lodged in the rim of the shield; once it sprang beyond upon
  the sand. M&oelig;rocles, who followed, surpassed him. Amyntas was hardly
  worse. Glaucon came last, and won his victory with a dexterous grace that
  made all but the hottest Laconian swell the &ldquo;<i>Io! paian!</i>&rdquo;
  of applause. His second cast had been into the centre of the target. His
  third had splintered his second javelin as it hung quivering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon of Athens wins the javelin-casting. M&oelig;rocles of
  Mantinea is second. Amyntas of Thebes is poorest and drops from the
  games.&rdquo; But who heard the herald now?</p>

  <p>By this time all save the few Mantineans who vainly clung to their
  champion, and the Laconians themselves, had begun to pin their hopes on the
  beautiful son of Conon. There was a steely glint in the Spartan
  athlete&rsquo;s eye that made the president of the games beckon to the
  master-herald.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lycon is dangerous. See that he does not do Glaucon a mischief, or
  transgress the rules.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can, till they come to the wrestling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In that the god must aid the Athenian. But now let us have the
  foot-race.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In the little respite following the trainers entered and rubbed down the
  three remaining contestants with oil until their bodies shone again like
  tinted ivory. Then the heralds conducted the trio to the southern end
  farthest from the tents. The two junior presidents left their pulpit and took
  post at either end of a line marked on the sand. Each held the end of a taut
  rope. The contestants drew lots from an urn for the place nearest the lower
  turning goal,&mdash;no trifling advantage. A favouring god gave
  M&oelig;rocles the first; Lycon was second; Glaucon only third. As the three
  crouched before the rope with hands dug into the sand, waiting the fateful
  signal, Glaucon was conscious that a strange blond man of noble mien and
  Oriental dress was sitting close by the starting line and watching him
  intently.</p>

  <p>It was one of those moments of strain, when even trifles can turn the
  overwrought attention. Glaucon knew that the stranger was looking from him to
  Lycon, from Lycon back to himself, measuring each with shrewd eye. Then the
  gaze settled on the Athenian. The Oriental called to him:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swift, godlike runner, swift;&rdquo;&mdash;they were so close they
  could catch the Eastern accent&mdash;&ldquo;the Most High give you His
  wings!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon saw Lycon turn on the shouter with a scowl that was answered by a
  composed smile. To the highly strung imagination of the Athenian the wish
  became an omen of good. For some unknown cause the incident of the Oriental
  lad he rescued and the mysterious gift of the bracelet flashed back to him.
  Why should a stranger of the East cast him fair wishes? Would the riddle ever
  be revealed?</p>

  <p>A trumpet blast. The Oriental, his wish, all else save the tawny track,
  flashed from Glaucon&rsquo;s mind. The rope fell. The three shot away as
  one.</p>

  <p>Over the sand they flew, moving by quick leaps, their shining arms
  flashing to and fro in fair rhythm. Twice around the stadium led the race, so
  no one strained at first. For a while the three clung together, until near
  the lower goal the Mantinean heedlessly risked a dash. His foot slipped on
  the sands. He recovered; but like arrows his rivals passed him. At the goal
  the inevitable happened. Lycon, with the shorter turn, swung quickest. He
  went up the homeward track ahead, the Athenian an elbow&rsquo;s length
  behind. The stadium seemed dissolving in a tumult. Men rose; threw garments
  in the air; stretched out their arms; besought the gods; screamed to the
  runners.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Speed, son of Conon, speed!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glory to Castor; Sparta is prevailing!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Strive, Mantinean,&mdash;still a chance!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Win the turn, dear Athenian, the turn, and leave that Cyclops
  behind!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But at the upper turn Lycon still held advantage, and down the other track
  went the twain, even as Odysseus ran behind Ajax, &ldquo;who trod in
  Ajax&rsquo; footsteps ere ever the dust had settled, while on his head fell
  the breath of him behind.&rdquo; Again at the lower goal the Mantinean was
  panting wearily in the rear. Again Lycon led, again rose the tempest of
  voices. Six hundred feet away the presidents were stretching the line, where
  victory and the plaudits of Hellas waited Lycon of Lacedæmon.</p>

  <p>Then men ceased shouting, and prayed under breath. They saw
  Glaucon&rsquo;s shoulders bend lower and his neck strain back, while the
  sunlight sprang all over his red-gold hair. The stadium leaped to their feet,
  as the Athenian landed by a bound at his rival&rsquo;s side. Quick as the
  bound the great arm of the Spartan flew out with its knotted fist. A deadly
  stroke, and shunned by a hair&rsquo;s-breadth; but it was shunned. The senior
  president called angrily to the herald; but none heard his words in the
  rending din. The twain shot up the track elbow to elbow, and into the rope.
  It fell amid a blinding cloud of dust. All the heralds and presidents ran
  together into it. Then was a long, agonizing moment, while the stadium
  roared, shook, and raged, before the dust settled and the master-herald stood
  forth beckoning for silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon of Athens wins the foot-race. Lycon of Sparta is second.
  M&oelig;rocles of Mantinea drops from the contest. Glaucon and Lycon, each
  winning twice, shall wrestle for the final victory.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And now the stadium grew exceeding still. Men lifted their hands to their
  favourite gods, and made reckless, if silent, vows,&mdash;geese, pigs,
  tripods, even oxen,&mdash;if only the deity would strengthen their
  favourite&rsquo;s arm. For the first time attention was centred on the tall
  &ldquo;time pointer,&rdquo; by the judges&rsquo; stand, and how the short
  shadow cast by the staff told of the end of the morning. The last wagers were
  recorded on the tablets by nervous styluses. The readiest tongues ceased to
  chatter. Thousands of wistful eyes turned from the elegant form of the
  Athenian to the burly form of the Spartan. Every outward chance, so many an
  anxious heart told itself, favoured the oft-victorious giant; but
  then,&mdash;and here came reason for a true Hellene,&mdash;&ldquo;the gods
  could not suffer so fair a man to meet defeat.&rdquo; The noonday sun beat
  down fiercely. The tense stillness was now and then broken by the bawling of
  a swarthy hawker thrusting himself amid the spectators with cups and a jar of
  sour wine. There was a long rest. The trainers came forward again and dusted
  the two remaining champions with sand that they might grip fairly. Pytheas
  looked keenly in his pupil&rsquo;s face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Well begun is half done,&rsquo; my lad; but the hottest
  battle is still before,&rdquo; said he, trying to cover his own consuming
  dread.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Faint heart never won a city,&rdquo; smiled Glaucon, as if never
  more at ease; and Pytheas drew back happier, seeing the calm light in the
  athlete&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he muttered to his fellow-trainer, &ldquo;all is well.
  The boy has wakened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But now the heralds marched the champions again to the judges. The
  president proclaimed the rules of the wrestling,&mdash;two casts out of three
  gave victory. In lower tone he addressed the scowling Spartan:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lycon, I warn you: earn the crown only fairly, if you would earn
  it. Had that blow in the foot-race struck home, I would have refused you
  victory, though you finished all alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A surly nod was the sole answer.</p>

  <p>The heralds led the twain a little way from the judges&rsquo; stand, and
  set them ten paces asunder and in sight of all the thousands. The heralds
  stood, crossing their myrtle wands between. The president rose on his pulpit,
  and called through the absolute hush:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Prepared, Spartan?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Prepared, Athenian?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then Poseidon shed glory on the best!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His uplifted wand fell. A clear shrill trumpet pealed. The heralds bounded
  back in a twinkling. In that twinkling the combatants leaped into each
  other&rsquo;s arms. A short grapple; again a sand cloud; and both were rising
  from the ground. They had fallen together. Heated by conflict, they were
  locked again ere the heralds could proclaim a tie. Cimon saw the great arms
  of the Spartan twine around the Athenian&rsquo;s chest in fair grapple, but
  even as Lycon strove with all his bull-like might to lift and throw,
  Glaucon&rsquo;s slim hand glided down beneath his opponent&rsquo;s thigh.
  Twice the Spartan put forth all his powers. Those nearest watched the veins
  of the athletes swell and heard their hard muscles crack. The stadium was in
  succession hushed and tumultuous. Then, at the third trial, even as Lycon
  seemed to have won his end, the Athenian smote out with one foot. The sands
  were slippery. The huge Laconian lunged forward, and as he lunged, his
  opponent by a masterly effort tore himself loose. The Spartan fell
  heavily,&mdash;vanquished by a trick, though fairly used.</p>

  <p>The stadium thundered its applause. More vows, prayers, exhortations.
  Glaucon stood and received all the homage in silence. A little flush was on
  his forehead. His arms and shoulders were very red. Lycon rose slowly. All
  could hear his rage and curses. The heralds ordered him to contain
  himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, fox of Athens,&rdquo; rang his shout, &ldquo;I will kill
  you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Pytheas, beholding his fury, tore out a handful of hair in his mingled
  hope and dread. No man knew better than the trainer that no trick would
  conquer Lycon this second time; and Glaucon the Fair might be nearer the
  fields of Asphodel than the pleasant hills by Athens. More than one man had
  died in the last ordeal of the pentathlon.</p>

  <p>The silence was perfect. Even the breeze had hushed while Glaucon and
  Lycon faced again. The twenty thousand sat still as in their sepulchres, each
  saying in his heart one word&mdash;&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; If in the first
  wrestling the attack had been impetuous, it was now painfully deliberate.
  When the heralds&rsquo; wands fell, the two crept like mighty cats across the
  narrow sands, frames bent, hands outstretched, watching from the corners of
  their eyes a fair chance to rush in and grapple. Then Lycon, whose raging
  spirit had the least control, charged. Another dust cloud. When it cleared,
  the two were locked together as by iron.</p>

  <p>For an instant they swayed, whilst the Spartan tried again his brute
  power. It failed him. Glaucon drew strength from the earth like Antæus. The
  hushed stadium could hear the pants of the athletes as they locked closer,
  closer. Strength failing, the Spartan snatched at his enemy&rsquo;s throat;
  but the Athenian had his wrist gripped fast before the clasp could tighten,
  and in the melée Glaucon&rsquo;s other hand passed beneath Lycon&rsquo;s
  thigh. The two seemed deadlocked. For a moment they grinned face to face,
  almost close enough to bite each other&rsquo;s lips. But breath was too
  precious for curses. The Spartan flung his ponderous weight downward. A slip
  in the gliding sand would have ruined the Athenian instantly; but Poseidon or
  Apollo was with him. His feet dug deep, and found footing. Lycon drew back
  baffled, though the clutches of their hands were tightening like vices of
  steel. Then again face to face, swaying to and fro, panting, muttering, while
  the veins in the bare backs swelled still more.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He cannot endure it. He cannot! Ah! Athena Polias, pity him! Lycon
  is wearing him down,&rdquo; moaned Pytheas, beside himself with fear, almost
  running to Glaucon&rsquo;s aid.</p>

  <p>The stadium resumed its roaring. A thousand conflicting prayers, hopes,
  counsels, went forth to the combatants. The gods of Olympus and Hades; all
  demigods, heroes, satyrs, were invoked for them. They were besought to
  conquer in the name of parents, friends, and native land. Athenians and
  Laconians, sitting side by side, took up the combat, grappling fiercely. And
  all this time the two strove face to face.</p>

  <p>How long had it lasted? Who knew? Least of all that pair who wrestled
  perchance for life and for death. Twice again the Spartan strove with his
  weight to crush his opponent down. Twice vainly. He could not close his grip
  around the Athenian&rsquo;s throat. He had looked to see Glaucon sink
  exhausted; but his foe still looked on him with steadfast, unweakening eyes.
  The president was just bidding the heralds, &ldquo;Pluck them asunder and
  declare a tie!&rdquo; when the stadium gave a shrill long shout. Lycon had
  turned to his final resource. Reckless of his own hurt, he dashed his iron
  forehead against the Athenian&rsquo;s, as bull charges bull. Twice and three
  times, and the blood leaped out over Glaucon&rsquo;s fair skin.
  Again&mdash;the rush of blood was almost blinding. Again&mdash;Pytheas
  screamed with agony&mdash;the Athenian&rsquo;s clutch seemed weakening.
  Again&mdash;flesh and blood could not stand such battering long. If Lycon
  could endure this, there was only one end to the pentathlon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Help thou me, Athena of the Gray Eyes! For the glory of Athens, my
  father, my wife!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The cry of Glaucon&mdash;half prayer, half battle-shout&mdash;pealed above
  the bellowing stadium. Even as he cried it, all saw his form draw upward as
  might Prometheus&rsquo;s unchained. They saw the fingers of the Spartan
  unclasp. They saw his bloody face upturned and torn with helpless agony. They
  saw his great form totter, topple, fall. The last dust cloud, and into it the
  multitude seemed rushing together....</p>

  <p>... They caught Glaucon just as he fell himself. Themistocles was the
  first to kiss him. Little Simonides wept. Cimon, trying to embrace the
  victor, hugged in the confusion a dirty Platæan. Democrates seemed lost in
  the whirlpool, and came with greetings later. Perhaps he had stopped to watch
  that Oriental who had given Glaucon good wishes in the foot-race. The fairest
  praise, however, was from a burly man, who merely held out his hand and
  muttered, &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; But this was from Leonidas.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Very late a runner crowned with pink oleanders panted up to
  the Athenian watch by Mount Icarus at the custom-house on the Megarian
  frontier.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Nika!</i>&mdash;He conquers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man fell breathless; but in a moment a clear beacon blazed upon the
  height. From a peak in Salamis another answered. In Eleusis, Hermippus the
  Noble was running to his daughter. In Peiræus, the harbour-town, the sailor
  folk were dancing about the market-place. In Athens, archons, generals, and
  elders were accompanying Conon to the Acropolis to give thanks to Athena.
  Conon had forgotten how he had disowned his son. Another beacon glittered
  from the Acropolis. Another flashed from the lordly crest of Pentelicus,
  telling the news to all Attica. There was singing in the fishers&rsquo; boats
  far out upon the bay. In the goat-herds&rsquo; huts on dark Hymethus the
  pan-pipes blew right merrily. Athens spent the night in almost drunken joy.
  One name was everywhere:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon the Beautiful who honours us all! Glaucon the Fortunate
  whom the High Gods love!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="bk1"
     name="bk1"></a>BOOK I. -- THE SHADOW OF THE PERSIAN</h2>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. -- HERMIONE OF ELEUSIS</h2>

  <p>A cluster of white stuccoed houses with a craggy hill behind, and before
  them a blue bay girt in by the rocky isle of Salamis&mdash;that is
  Eleusis-by-the-Sea. Eastward and westward spreads the teeming Thrasian plain,
  richest in Attica. Behind the plain the encircling mountain wall fades away
  into a purple haze. One can look southward toward Salamis; then to the left
  rises the rounded slope of brown P&oelig;cilon sundering Eleusis from its
  greater neighbour, Athens. Look behind: there is a glimpse of the long violet
  crests of Cithæron and Parnes, the barrier mountains against B&oelig;otia.
  Look to right: beyond the summits of Megara lifts a noble cone. It is an old
  friend, Acro-Corinthus. The plain within the hills is sprinkled with thriving
  farmsteads, green vineyards, darker olive groves. The stony hill-slopes are
  painted red by countless poppies. One hears the tinkling of the bells of
  roving goats. Thus the more distant view; while at the very foot of the hill
  of vision rises a temple with proud columns and pediments,&mdash;the fane of
  Demeter the &ldquo;Earth Mother&rdquo; and the seat of her Mysteries,
  renowned through Hellas.</p>

  <p>The house of Hermippus the Eumolpid, first citizen of Eleusis, stood to
  the east of the temple. On three sides gnarled trunks and sombre leaves of
  the sacred olives almost hid the white low walls of the rambling buildings.
  On the fourth side, facing the sea, the dusty road wound east toward Megara.
  Here, by the gate, were gathered a rustic company: brown-faced village lads
  and lasses, toothless graybeards, cackling old wives. Above the barred gate
  swung a festoon of ivy, whilst from within the court came the squeaking of
  pipes, the tuning of citharas, and shouted orders&mdash;signs of a mighty
  bustling. Then even while the company grew, a half-stripped courier flew up
  the road and into the gate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They come,&rdquo; ran the wiseacre&rsquo;s comment; but their
  buzzing ceased, as again the gate swung back to suffer two ladies to peer
  forth. Ladies, in the truth, for the twain had little in common with the
  ogling village maids, and whispers were soon busy with them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look&mdash;his wife and her mother! How would you, Praxin&oelig;,
  like to marry an Isthmionices?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excellently well, but your Hermas won&rsquo;t so honour
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Eu!</i> see, she lifts her pretty blue veil; I&rsquo;m glad
  she&rsquo;s handsome. Some beautiful men wed regular hags.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The two ladies were clearly mother and daughter, of the same noble height,
  and dressed alike in white. Both faces were framed in a flutter of Amorgos
  gauze: the mother&rsquo;s was saffron, crowned with a wreath of golden
  wheat-ears; the daughter&rsquo;s blue with a circlet of violets. And now as
  they stood with arms entwined the younger brushed aside her veil. The gossips
  were right. The robe and the crown hid all but the face and tress of the
  lustrous brown hair,&mdash;but that face! Had not King Hephæstos wrought
  every line of clear Ph&oelig;nician glass, then touched them with snow and
  rose, and shot through all the ichor of life? Perhaps there was a fitful fire
  in the dark eyes that awaited the husband&rsquo;s coming, or a slight
  twitching of the impatient lips. But nothing disturbed the high-born repose
  of face and figure. Hermione was indeed the worthy daughter of a noble house,
  and happy the man who was faring homeward to Eleusis!</p>

  <p>Another messenger. Louder bustle in the court, and the voice of Hermippus
  arraying his musicians. Now a sharp-faced man, who hid his bald pate under a
  crown of lilies, joined the ladies,&mdash;Conon, father of the victor. He had
  ended his life-feud with Hermippus the night the message flashed from
  Corinth. Then a third runner; this time in his hand a triumphant palm branch,
  and his one word&mdash;&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; A crash of music answered from the
  court, while Hermippus, a stately nobleman, his fine head just sprinkled with
  gray, led out his unmartial army.</p>

  <p>Single pipes and double pipes, tinkling lyres and many-stringed citharas,
  not to forget herdsmen&rsquo;s reed flutes, cymbals, and tambours, all made
  melody and noise together. An imposing procession that must have crammed the
  courtyard wound out into the Corinth road.</p>

  <p>Here was the demarch(2) of Eleusis, a pompous worthy, who could hardly
  hold his head erect, thanks to an exceeding heavy myrtle wreath. After him,
  two by two, the snowy-robed, long-bearded priests of Demeter; behind these
  the noisy corps of musicians, and then a host of young men and
  women,&mdash;bright of eye, graceful of movement,&mdash;twirling long chains
  of ivy, laurel, and myrtle in time to the music. Palm branches were
  everywhere. The procession moved down the road; but even as it left the court
  a crash of cymbals through the olive groves answered its uproar. Deep now and
  sonorous sounded manly voices as in some triumphal chant. Hermione, as she
  stood by the gate, drew closer to her mother. Inflexible Attic custom seemed
  to hold her fast. No noblewoman might thrust herself boldly under the public
  eye&mdash;save at a sacred festival&mdash;no, not when the centre of the
  gladness was her husband.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[2 The chief magistrate of an Attic commune.]</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He comes!&rdquo; So she cried to her mother; so cried every one.
  Around the turn in the olive groves swung a car in which Cimon stood proudly
  erect, and at his side another. Marching before the chariot were
  Themistocles, Democrates, Simonides; behind followed every Athenian who had
  visited the Isthmia. The necks of the four horses were wreathed with flowers;
  flowers hid the reins and bridles, the chariot, and even its wheels. The
  victor stood aloft, his scarlet cloak flung back, displaying his godlike
  form. An unhealed scar marred his forehead&mdash;Lycon&rsquo;s handiwork; but
  who thought of that, when above the scar pressed the wreath of wild parsley?
  As the two processions met, a cheer went up that shook the red rock of
  Eleusis. The champion answered with his frankest smile; only his eyes seemed
  questioning, seeking some one who was not there.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Io! Glaucon!&rdquo; The Eleusinian youths broke from their ranks
  and fell upon the chariot. The horses were loosed in a twinkling. Fifty arms
  dragged the car onward. The pipers swelled their cheeks, each trying to
  outblow his fellow. Then after them sped the maidens. They ringed the chariot
  round with a maze of flowers chains. As the car moved, they accompanied it
  with a dance of unspeakable ease, modesty, grace. A local poet&mdash;not
  Simonides, not Pindar, but some humbler bard&mdash;had invoked his muse for
  the grand occasion. Youths and maidens burst forth into singing.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Io! Io, pæan! the parsley-wreathed victor hail!<br>
  Io! Io, pæan! sing it out on each breeze, each gale!<br>
  He has triumphed, our own, our beloved,<br>
  Before all the myriad&rsquo;s ken.<br>
  He has met the swift, has proved swifter!<br>
  The strong, has proved stronger again!<br>
  Now glory to him, to his kinfolk,<br>
  To Athens, and all Athens&rsquo; men!<br>
  Meet, run to meet him,<br>
  The nimblest are not too fleet.<br>
  Greet him, with raptures greet him,<br>
  With songs and with twinkling feet.<br>
  He approaches,&mdash;throw flowers before him.<br>
  Throw poppy and lily and rose;<br>
  Blow faster, gay pipers, faster,<br>
  Till your mad music throbs and flows,<br>
  For his glory and ours flies through Hellas,<br>
  Wherever the Sun-King goes.</p>

  <p class="verse">Io! Io, pæan! crown with laurel and myrtle and pine,<br>
  Io, pæan! haste to crown him with olive, Athena&rsquo;s dark vine.<br>
  He is with us, he shines in his beauty;<br>
  Oh, joy of his face the first sight;<br>
  He has shed on us all his bright honour,<br>
  Let High Zeus shed on him his light,<br>
  And thou, Pallas, our gray-eyed protectress,<br>
  Keep his name and his fame ever bright!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Matching action to the song, they threw over the victor crowns and chains
  beyond number, till the parsley wreath was hidden from sight. Near the gate
  of Hermippus the jubilant company halted. The demarch bawled long for
  silence, won it at last, and approached the chariot. He, good man, had been a
  long day meditating on his speech of formal congratulation and enjoyed his
  opportunity. Glaucon&rsquo;s eyes still roved and questioned, yet the demarch
  rolled out his windy sentences. But there was something unexpected. Even as
  the magistrate took breath after reciting the victor&rsquo;s noble ancestry,
  there was a cry, a parting of the crowd, and Glaucon the Alcmæonid leaped
  from the chariot as never on the sands at Corinth. The veil and the violet
  wreath fell from the head of Hermione when her face went up to her
  husband&rsquo;s. The blossoms that had covered the athlete shook over her
  like a cloud as his face met hers. Then even the honest demarch cut short his
  eloquence to swell the salvo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The beautiful to the beautiful! The gods reward well. Here is the
  fairest crown!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For all Eleusis loved Hermione, and would have forgiven far greater things
  from her than this.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Hermippus feasted the whole company,&mdash;the crowd at long
  tables in the court, the chosen guests in a more private chamber.
  &ldquo;Nothing to excess&rdquo; was the truly Hellenic maxim of the refined
  Eleusinian; and he obeyed it. His banquet was elegant without gluttony. The
  Syracusan cook had prepared a lordly turbot. The wine was choice old Chian
  but well diluted. There was no vulgar gorging with meat, after the
  B&oelig;otian manner; but the great Copaic eel, &ldquo;such as Poseidon might
  have sent up to Olympus,&rdquo; made every gourmand clap his hands. The
  aromatic honey was the choicest from Mt. Hymettus.</p>

  <p>Since the smaller company was well selected, convention was waived, and
  ladies were present. Hermione sat on a wide chair beside Lysistra, her comely
  mother; her younger brothers on stools at either hand. Directly across the
  narrow table Glaucon and Democrates reclined on the same couch. The eyes of
  husband and wife seldom left each other; their tongues flew fast; they never
  saw how Democrates hardly took his gaze from the face of Hermione. Simonides,
  who reclined beside Themistocles,&mdash;having struck a firm friendship with
  that statesman on very brief acquaintance,&mdash;was overrunning with humour
  and anecdote. The great man beside him was hardly his second in the fence of
  wit and wisdom. After the fish had given way to the wine, Simonides regaled
  the company with a gravely related story of how the Dioscuri had personally
  appeared to him during his last stay in Thessaly and saved him from certain
  death in a falling building.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You swear this is a true tale, Simonides?&rdquo; began
  Themistocles, with one eye in his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impiety to doubt. As penalty, rise at once and sing a
  song in honour of Glaucon&rsquo;s victory.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am no singer or harpist,&rdquo; returned the statesman, with a
  self-complacency he never concealed. &ldquo;I only know how to make Athens
  powerful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! you son of Miltiades,&rdquo; urged the poet, &ldquo;at least
  you will not refuse so churlishly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cimon, with due excuses, arose, called for a harp, and began tuning it;
  but not all the company were destined to hear him. A slave-boy touched
  Themistocles on the shoulder, and the latter started to go.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Dioscuri will save you?&rdquo; demanded Simonides,
  laughing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite other gods,&rdquo; rejoined the statesman; &ldquo;your
  pardon, Cimon, I return in a moment. An agent of mine is back from Asia,
  surely with news of weight, if he must seek me at once in Eleusis.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Themistocles lingered outside; an instant more brought a summons to
  Democrates, who found Themistocles in an antechamber, deep in talk with
  Sicinnus,&mdash;nominally the tutor of his sons, actually a trusted spy. The
  first glance at the Asiatic&rsquo;s keen face and eyes was disturbing. An
  inward omen&mdash;not from the entrails of birds, nor a sign in the
  heavens&mdash;told Democrates the fellow brought no happy tidings.</p>

  <p>With incisive questions Themistocles had been bringing out everything.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So it is absolutely certain that Xerxes begins his invasion next
  spring?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As certain as that Helios will rise to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forewarned is forearmed. Now where have you been since I sent you
  off in the winter to visit Asia?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man, who knew his master loved to do the lion&rsquo;s share of the
  talking, answered instantly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sardis, Emesa, Babylon, Susa, Persepolis, Ecbatana.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Eu!</i> Your commission is well executed. Are all the rumours we
  hear from the East well founded? Is Xerxes assembling an innumerable
  host?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rumour does not tell half the truth. Not one tribe in Asia but is
  required to send its fighting men. Two bridges of boats are being built
  across the Hellespont. The king will have twelve hundred war triremes,
  besides countless transports. The cavalry are being numbered by hundreds of
  thousands, the infantry by millions. Such an army was never assembled since
  Zeus conquered the Giants.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A merry array!&rdquo; Themistocles whistled an instant through his
  teeth; but, never confounded, urged on his questions. &ldquo;So be it. But is
  Xerxes the man to command this host? He is no master of war like Darius his
  father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is a creature for eunuchs and women; nevertheless his army will
  not suffer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And wherefore?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because Prince Mardonius, son of Gobryas, and brother-in-law of the
  king, has the wisdom and valour of Cyrus and Darius together. Name him, and
  you name the arch-foe of Hellas. He, not Xerxes, will be the true leader of
  the host.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You saw him, of course?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not. A Magian in Ecbatana told me a strange story. &lsquo;The
  Prince,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;hates the details of camps; leaving the
  preparation to others, he has gone to Greece to spy out the land he is to
  conquer.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Impossible, you are dreaming!&rdquo; The exclamation came not from
  Themistocles but Democrates.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not dreaming, worthy sir,&rdquo; returned Sicinnus, tartly;
  &ldquo;the Magian may have lied, but I sought the Prince in every city I
  visited; they always told me, &lsquo;He is in another.&rsquo; He was not at
  the king&rsquo;s court. He may have gone to Egypt, to India, or to
  Arabia;&mdash;he <i>may</i> likewise have gone to Greece.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;These are serious tidings, Democrates,&rdquo; remarked
  Themistocles, with an anxiety his voice seldom betrayed. &ldquo;Sicinnus is
  right; the presence of such a man as Mardonius in Hellas explains many
  things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, the lukewarmness of so many friends we had counted on, the
  bickerings which arose among the Confederates when we met just now at the
  Isthmus, the slackness of all Spartans save Leonidas in preparing for war,
  the hesitancy of Corcyra in joining us. Thebes is Medizing, Crete is
  Medizing, so is Argos. Thessaly is wavering. I can almost name the princes
  and great nobles over Hellas who are clutching at Persian money. O Father
  Zeus,&rdquo; wound up the Athenian, &ldquo;if there is not some master-spirit
  directing all this villany, there is no wisdom in Themistocles, son of
  Neocles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But the coming of Mardonius to Greece?&rdquo; questioned the
  younger man; &ldquo;the peril he runs? the risk of
  discovery&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is all but nothing, except as he comes to Athens, for Medizers will
  shelter him everywhere. Yet there is one spot&mdash;blessed be
  Athena&mdash;&rdquo; Themistocles&rsquo;s hands went up in easy
  piety&mdash;&ldquo;where, let him come if come he dare!&rdquo; Then with a
  swift change, as was his wont, the statesman looked straight on
  Democrates.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hark you, son of Myscelus; those Persian lords are reckless. He may
  even test the fates and set foot in Attica. I am cumbered with as many cares
  as Zeus, but this commission I give to you. You are my most trusted
  lieutenant; I can risk no other. Keep watch, hire spies, scatter bribe-money.
  Rest not day nor night to find if Mardonius the Persian enters Athens. Once
  in our clutches&mdash;and you have done Hellas as fair a turn as Miltiades at
  Marathon. You promise it? Give me your hand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A great task,&rdquo; spoke Democrates, none too readily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And one you are worthy to accomplish. Are we not co-workers for
  Athens and for Hellas?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles&rsquo;s hawklike eyes were unescapable. The younger Athenian
  thought they were reading his soul. He held out his hand....</p>

  <p>When Democrates returned to the hall, Cimon had ended his song. The guests
  were applauding furiously. Wine was still going round, but Glaucon and
  Hermione were not joining. Across the table they were conversing in low
  sentences that Democrates could not catch. But he knew well enough the
  meaning as each face flashed back the beauty of the other. And his mind
  wandered back darkly to the day when Glaucon had come to him, more radiant
  than even his wont, and cried, &ldquo;Give me joy, dear comrade, joy!
  Hermippus has promised me the fairest maiden in Athens.&rdquo; Some evil god
  had made Democrates blind to all his boon-companion&rsquo;s wooing. How many
  hopes of the orator that day had been shattered! Yet he had even professed to
  rejoice with the son of Conon.... He sat in sombre silence, until the piping
  voice of Simonides awakened him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Friend, if you are a fool, you do a wise thing in keeping still; if
  a wise man, a very foolish thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wine, boy,&rdquo; ordered Democrates; &ldquo;and less water in it.
  I feel wretchedly stupid to-day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He spent the rest of the feast drinking deeply, and with much forced
  laughter. The dinner ended toward evening. The whole company escorted the
  victor toward Athens. At Daphni, the pass over the hills, the archons and
  strategi&mdash;highest officials of the state&mdash;met them with cavalry and
  torches and half of the city trailing at their heels. Twenty cubits of the
  city wall were pulled down to make a gate for the triumphal entry. There was
  another great feast at the government house. The purse of an hundred drachmæ,
  due by law to Isthmian victors, was presented. A street was named for Glaucon
  in the new port-town of Peiræus. Simonides recited a triumphal ode. All
  Athens, in short, made merry for days. Only one man found it hard to join the
  mirth whole-heartedly. And this was the victor&rsquo;s bosom
  friend,&mdash;Democrates.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. -- ATHENS</h2>

  <p class="first">In Athens! Shall one mount the Acropolis or enter the market
  place? Worship in the temple of the Virgin Athena, or descend to the Agora
  and the roar of its getters and spenders? For Athens has two
  faces&mdash;toward the ideal, toward the commonplace. Who can regard both at
  once? Let the Acropolis, its sculptures, its landscape, wait. It has waited
  for men three thousand years. And so to the Agora.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Full market time.&rdquo; The Agora was a beehive. From the round
  Tholus at the south to the long portico at the north all was babel and
  traffic. Donkeys raised their wheezing protest against too heavy loads of
  farm produce. Megarian swine squealed and tugged at their leg-cords. An
  Asiatic sailor clamoured at the money-changer&rsquo;s stall for another obol
  in change for a Persian daric. &ldquo;Buy my oil!&rdquo; bawled the huckster
  from his wicker booth beside the line of Hermes-busts in the midst of the
  square. &ldquo;Buy my charcoal!&rdquo; roared back a companion, whilst past
  both was haled a grinning negro with a crier who bade every gentleman to
  &ldquo;mark his chance&rdquo; for a fashionable servant. Phocian the quack
  was hawking his toothache salve from the steps of the Temple of Apollo.
  Deira, the comely flower girl, held out crowns of rose, violet, and narcissus
  to the dozen young dandies who pressed about her. Around the Hermes-busts
  idle crowds were reading the legal notices plastered on the base of each
  statue. A file of mules and wagons was ploughing through the multitude with
  marble for some new building. Every instant the noise grew. Pandora&rsquo;s
  box had opened, and every clamour had flitted out.</p>

  <p>At the northern end, where the porticos and the long Dromos street ran off
  toward the Dipylon gate, stood the shop of Clearchus the potter. A low
  counter was covered with the owner&rsquo;s wares,&mdash;tall amphoræ for
  wine, flat beakers, water-pots, and basins. Behind, two apprentices whirled
  the wheel, another glazed on the black varnish and painted the jars with
  little red loves and dancing girls. Clearchus sat on the counter with three
  friends,&mdash;come not to trade but to barter the latest gossip from the
  barber-shops: Agis the sharp, knavish cockpit and gaming-house keeper, Crito
  the fat mine-contractor, and finally Polus, gray and pursy, who
  &ldquo;devoted his talents to the public weal,&rdquo; in other words was a
  perpetual juryman and likewise busybody.</p>

  <p>The latest rumour about Xerxes having been duly chewed, conversation began
  to lag.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An idle day for you, my Polus,&rdquo; threw out Clearchus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Idle indeed! No jury sits to-day in the King Archon&rsquo;s Porch
  or the &lsquo;Red Court&rsquo;; I can&rsquo;t vote to condemn that Heraclius
  who&rsquo;s exported wheat contrary to the law.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Condemn?&rdquo; cried Agis; &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t the evidence very
  weak?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; snorted Polus, &ldquo;very weak, and the wretch pleaded
  piteously, setting his wife and four little ones weeping on the stand. But we
  are resolved. &lsquo;You are boiling a stone&mdash;your plea&rsquo;s no
  profit,&rsquo; thought we. Our hearts vote &lsquo;guilty,&rsquo; if our heads
  say &lsquo;innocent.&rsquo; One mustn&rsquo;t discourage honest informers.
  What&rsquo;s a patriot on a jury for if only to acquit? Holy Father Zeus, but
  there&rsquo;s a pleasure in dropping into the voting-urn the black bean which
  condemns!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Athena keep us, then, from litigation,&rdquo; murmured Clearchus;
  while Crito opened his fat lips to ask, &ldquo;And what adjourns the
  courts?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A meeting of the assembly, to be sure. The embassy&rsquo;s come
  back from Delphi with the oracle we sought about the prospects of the
  war.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then Themistocles will speak,&rdquo; observed the potter; &ldquo;a
  very important meeting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very important,&rdquo; choked the juror, fishing a long piece of
  garlic from his wallet and cramming it into his mouth with both hands.
  &ldquo;What a noble statesman Themistocles is! Only young Democrates will
  ever be like him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Democrates?&rdquo; squeaked out Crito.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes. Almost as eloquent as Themistocles. What zeal for
  democracy! What courage against Persia! A Nestor, I say, in
  wisdom&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Agis gave a whistle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A Nestor, perhaps. Yet if you knew, as I do, how some of his nights
  pass,&mdash;dice, Rhodian fighting-cocks, dancing-girls, and worse
  things,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll scarce believe it,&rdquo; grunted the juror; yet then
  confessed somewhat ruefully, &ldquo;however, he is unfortunate in his bosom
  friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded the potter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon the Alcmæonid, to be sure. I cried &lsquo;<i>Io,
  pæan!</i>&rsquo; as loud as the others when he came back; still I weary of
  having a man always so fortunate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Even as you voted to banish Aristeides, Themistocles&rsquo;s rival,
  because you were tired of hearing him called &lsquo;the Just.&rsquo;
  &rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s much in that. Besides, he&rsquo;s an Alcmæonid, and
  since their old murder of Cylon the house has been under a blood curse. He
  has married the daughter of Hermippus, who is too highly born to be faithful
  to the democracy. He carries a Laconian cane,&mdash;sure sign of Spartanizing
  tendencies. He may conspire any day to become tyrant.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; warned Clearchus, &ldquo;there he passes now, arm in
  arm with Democrates as always, and on his way to the assembly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The men are much alike in build,&rdquo; spoke Crito, slowly,
  &ldquo;only Glaucon is infinitely handsomer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And infinitely less honest. I distrust your too beautiful and too
  lucky men,&rdquo; snapped Polus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Envious dog,&rdquo; commented Agis; and bitter personalities might
  have followed had not a bell jangled from an adjacent portico.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Phormio, my brother-in-law, with fresh fish from Phaleron,&rdquo;
  announced Polus, drawing a coin from his wonted purse,&mdash;his cheek;
  &ldquo;quick, friends, we must buy our dinners.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Between the columns of the portico stood Phormio the fishmonger, behind a
  table heaped with his scaly wares. He was a thick, florid man with blue eyes
  lit by a humourous twinkle. His arms were crusted with brine. To his waist he
  was naked. As the friends edged nearer he held up a turbot, calling for a
  bid. A clamour answered him. The throng pressed up the steps, elbowing and
  scrambling. The competition was keen but good-natured. Phormio&rsquo;s broad
  jests and witticisms&mdash;he called all his customers by name&mdash;aided in
  forcing up the price. The turbot was knocked down to a rich gentleman&rsquo;s
  cook marketing for his master. The pile of fish decreased, the bidding
  sharpened. The &ldquo;Market Wardens&rdquo; seemed needed to check the
  jostling. But as the last eel was held up, came a cry&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look out for the rope!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Phormio&rsquo;s customers scattered. Scythian constables were stretching
  cords dusted with red chalk across all exits from the Agora, save that to the
  south. Soon the band began contracting its nets and driving a swarm of
  citizens toward the remaining exit, for a red chalk-mark on a mantle meant a
  fine. Traffic ceased instantly. Thousands crowded the lane betwixt the
  temples and porches, seeking the assembly place,&mdash;through a narrow,
  ill-built way, but the great area of the Pnyx opened before them like the
  slopes of some noble theatre.</p>

  <p>No seats; rich and poor sat down upon the rocky ground. Under the open
  azure, at the focus of the semicircle, with clear view before of the city,
  and to right of the red cliffs of the Acropolis, rose a low platform hewn in
  the rock,&mdash;the &ldquo;Bema,&rdquo; the orator&rsquo;s pulpit. A few
  chairs for the magistrates and a small altar were its sole furnishings. The
  multitude entered the Pnyx through two narrow entrances pierced in the massy
  engirdling wall and took seats at pleasure; all were equals&mdash;the
  Alcmæonid, the charcoal-seller from Acharnæ. Amid silence the chairman of the
  Council arose and put on the myrtle crown,&mdash;sign that the sitting was
  opened. A herald besought blessings on the Athenians and the Platæans their
  allies. A wrinkled seer carefully slaughtered a goose, proclaimed that its
  entrails gave good omen, and cast the carcass on the altar. The herald
  assured the people there was no rain, thunder, or other unlucky sign from
  heaven. The pious accordingly breathed easier, and awaited the order of the
  day.</p>

  <p>The decree of the Council convening the assembly was read; then the
  herald&rsquo;s formal proclamation:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who wishes to speak?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The answer was a groan from nigh every soul present. Three men ascended
  the Bema. They bore the olive branches and laurel garlands, suppliants at
  Delphi; but their cloaks were black. &ldquo;The oracle is unfavourable! The
  gods deliver us to Xerxes!&rdquo; The thrill of horror went around the
  Pnyx.</p>

  <p>The three stood an instant in gloomy silence. Then Callias the Rich,
  solemn and impressive, their spokesman, told their eventful story.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Athenians, by your orders we have been to Delphi to inquire of the
  surest oracle in Greece your destinies in the coming war. Hardly had we
  completed the accustomed sacrifices in the Temple of Apollo, when the
  Pythoness Aristonice, sitting above the sacred cleft whence comes the
  inspiring vapour, thus prophesied.&rdquo; And Callias repeated the hexameters
  which warned the Athenians that resistance to Xerxes would be worse than
  futile; that Athens was doomed; concluding with the fearful line, &ldquo;Get
  from this temple afar, and brood on the ills that await ye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In the pause, as Callias&rsquo;s voice fell, the agony of the people
  became nigh indescribable. Sturdy veterans who had met the Persian spears at
  Marathon blinked fast. Many groaned, some cursed. Here and there a bold
  spirit dared to open his heart to doubt, and to mutter, &ldquo;Persian gold,
  the Pythoness was corrupted,&rdquo; but quickly hushed even such whispers as
  rank impiety. Then a voice close to the Bema rang out loudly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And is this all the message, Callias?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The voice of Glaucon the Fortunate,&rdquo; cried many, finding
  relief in words. &ldquo;He is a friend to the ambassador. There is a further
  prophecy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The envoy, who had made his theatrical pause too long,
  continued:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Such, men of Athens, was the answer; and we went forth in dire
  tribulation. Then a certain noble Delphian, Timon by name, bade us take the
  olive branches and return to the Pythoness, saying, &lsquo;O King Apollo,
  reverence these boughs of supplication, and deliver a more comfortable answer
  concerning our dear country. Else we will not leave thy sanctuary, but stay
  here until we die.&rsquo; Whereat the priestess gave us a second answer,
  gloomy and riddling, yet not so evil as the first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again Callias recited his lines of doom, &ldquo;that Athena had vainly
  prayed to Zeus in behalf of her city, and that it was fated the foe should
  overrun all Attica, yet</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;&lsquo;Safe shall the wooden wall continue for thee
  and thy children;<br>
  Wait not the tramp of the horse, nor the footmen mightily moving<br>
  Over the land, but turn your back to the foe, and retire ye.<br>
  Yet a day shall arrive when ye shall meet him in battle.<br>
  Oh, holy Salamis, thou shalt destroy the offspring of women<br>
  When men scatter the seed, or when they gather the harvest.&rsquo;
  &rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;And that is all?&rdquo; demanded fifty voices.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is all,&rdquo; and Callias quitted the Bema. Whereupon if
  agony had held the Pnyx before, perplexity held it now. &ldquo;The wooden
  wall?&rdquo; &ldquo;Holy Salamis?&rdquo; &ldquo;A great battle, but who is to
  conquer?&rdquo; The feverish anxiety of the people at length found its vent
  in a general shout.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The seers! Call the seers! Explain the oracle!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The demand had clearly been anticipated by the president of the
  Council.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Xenagoras the Cerycid is present. He is the oldest seer. Let us
  hearken to his opinion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The head of the greatest priestly family in Athens arose. He was a
  venerable man, wearing his ribbon-decked robes of office. The president
  passed him the myrtle crown, as token that he had the Bema. In a tense hush
  his voice sounded clearly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was informed of the oracles before the assembly met. The meaning
  is plain. By the &lsquo;wooden wall&rsquo; is meant our ships. But if we risk
  a battle, we are told slaughter and defeat will follow. The god commands,
  therefore, that without resistance we quit Attica, gathering our wives, our
  children, and our goods, and sail away to some far country.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Xenagoras paused with the smile of him who performs a sad but necessary
  duty, removed the wreath, and descended the Bema.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quit Attica without a blow! Our fathers&rsquo; fathers&rsquo;
  sepulchres, the shrines of our gods, the pleasant farmsteads, the land where
  our Attic race have dwelt from dimmest time!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The thought shot chill through the thousands. Men sat in helpless silence,
  while many a soul, as the gaze wandered up to the temple-crowned Acropolis,
  asked once, yes twice, &ldquo;Is not the yoke of Persia preferable to
  that?&rdquo; Then after the silence broke the clamour of voices.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The other seers! Do all agree with Xenagoras? Stand forth! stand
  forth!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hegias, the &ldquo;King Archon,&rdquo; chief of the state religion, took
  the Bema. His speech was brief and to the point.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All the priests and seers of Attica have consulted. Xenagoras
  speaks for them all save Hermippus of the house of Eumolpus, who denies the
  others&rsquo; interpretation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Confusion followed. Men rose, swung their arms, harangued madly from where
  they stood. The chairman in vain ordered &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; and was fain
  to bid the Scythian constables restore order. An elderly farmer thrust
  himself forward, took the wreath, and poured out his rustic wisdom from the
  Bema. His advice was simple. The oracle said &ldquo;the wooden wall&rdquo;
  would be a bulwark, and by the wooden wall was surely meant the Acropolis
  which had once been protected by a palisade. Let all Attica shut itself in
  the citadel and endure a siege.</p>

  <p>So far he had proceeded garrulously, but the high-strung multitude could
  endure no more. &ldquo;<i>Kataba! Kataba!</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;Go down! go
  down!&rdquo; pealed the yell, emphasized by a shower of pebbles. The elder
  tore the wreath from his head and fled the Bema. Then out of the confusion
  came a general cry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cimon, son of Miltiades, speak to us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But that young nobleman preserved a discreet silence, and the multitude
  turned to another favourite.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Democrates, son of Myscelus, speak to us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The popular orator only wrapped his cloak about him, as he sat near the
  chairman&rsquo;s stand, never answering the call he rejoiced of wont to
  hear.</p>

  <p>There were cries for Hermippus, cries even for Glaucon, as if prowess in
  the pentathlon gave ability to unravel oracles. The athlete sitting beside
  Democrates merely blushed and drew closer to his friend. Then at last the
  despairing people turned to their last resource.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Themistocles, son of Neocles, speak to us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thrice the call in vain; but at the fourth time a wave of silence swept
  across the Pnyx. A figure well beloved was taking the wreath and mounting the
  Bema.</p>

  <p>The words of Themistocles that day were to ring in his hearer&rsquo;s ears
  till life&rsquo;s end. The careless, almost sybaritic, man of the Isthmus and
  Eleusis seemed transfigured. For one moment he stood silent, lofty,
  awe-inspiring. He had a mighty task: to calm the superstitious fears of
  thirty thousand, to silence the prophets of evil, to infuse those myriads
  with his own high courage. He began with a voice so low it would have seemed
  a whisper if not audible to all the Pnyx. Quickly he warmed. His gestures
  became dramatic. His voice rose to a trumpet-call. He swept his hearers with
  him as dry leaves before the blast. &ldquo;When he began to weave his words,
  one might have deemed him churlish, nay a fool, but when from his chest came
  his deep voice, and words like unto flakes of winter snow, then who could
  with him contend?&rdquo; Thus Homer of Odysseus the Guileful, thus as truly
  of Themistocles saviour of Hellas.</p>

  <p>First he told the old, but never wearisome story of the past of Athens.
  How, from the days of Codrus long ago, Athens had never bowed the knee to an
  invader, how she had wrested Salamis from greedy Megara, how she had hounded
  out the tyrannizing sons of Peisistratus, how she had braved all the wrath of
  Persian Darius and dashed his huge armament back at Marathon. With such a
  past, only a madman as well as traitor would dream of submitting to Xerxes
  now. But as for the admonition of Xenagoras to quit Attica and never strike a
  blow, Themistocles would have none of it. With a clearness that appealed to
  every home-loving Hellene he pictured the fate of wanderers as only one step
  better than that of slaves. What, then, was left? The orator had a decisive
  answer. Was not the &ldquo;wooden wall&rdquo; which should endure for the
  Athenians the great fleet they were just completing? And as for the fate of
  the battle the speaker had an unexpected solution. &ldquo;Holy
  Salamis,&rdquo; spoke the Pythoness. And would she have said
  &ldquo;holy,&rdquo; if the issue had been only woe to the sons of Athens?
  &ldquo;Luckless Salamis&rdquo; were then more reasonably the word; yet the
  prophetess so far from predicting defeat had assured them victory.</p>

  <p>Thus ran the substance of the speech on which many a soul knew hung the
  mending or ending of Hellas, but lit all through with gleams of wit, shades
  of pathos, outbursts of eloquence which burned into the hearers&rsquo; hearts
  as though the speaker were a god. Then at the end, Themistocles, knowing his
  audience was with him, delivered his peroration:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let him who trusts in oracles trust then in this, and in the old
  prophecy of Epimenides that when the Persian comes it is to his hurt. But I
  will say with Hector of Troy, &lsquo;One oracle is best&mdash;to fight for
  one&rsquo;s native country.&rsquo; Others may vote as they will. My vote is
  that if the foe by land be too great, we retire before him to our ships, ay,
  forsake even well-loved Attica, but only that we may trust to the
  &lsquo;wooden wall,&rsquo; and fight the Great King by sea at Salamis. We
  contend not with gods but with men. Let others fear. I will trust to Athena
  Polias,&mdash;the goddess terrible in battle. Hearken then to Solon the Wise
  (the orator pointed toward the temple upon the soaring Acropolis):&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo; &lsquo;Our Athens need fear no hurt<br>
  Though gods may conspire her ill.<br>
  The hand that hath borne us up,<br>
  It guides us and guards us still.<br>
  Athena, the child of Zeus,<br>
  She watches and knows no fear.<br>
  The city rests safe from harm<br>
  Beneath her protecting spear.&rsquo;</p><br>

  <p>Thus trusting in Athena, we will meet the foe at Salamis and will destroy
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who wishes to speak?&rdquo; called the herald. The Pnyx answered
  together. The vote to retire from Attica if needs be, to strengthen the
  fleet, to risk all in a great battle, was carried with a shout. Men ran to
  Themistocles, calling him, &ldquo;Peitho,&mdash;Queen Persuasion.&rdquo; He
  made light of their praises, and walked with his handsome head tossed back
  toward the general&rsquo;s office by the Agora, to attend to some routine
  business. Glaucon, Cimon, and Democrates went westward to calm their
  exhilaration with a ball-game at the gymnasium of Cynosarges. On the way
  Glaucon called attention to a foreigner that passed them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look, Democrates, that fellow is wonderfully like the honest
  barbarian who applauded me at the Isthmus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates glanced twice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear Glaucon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that fellow had a long blond
  beard, while this man&rsquo;s is black as a crow.&rdquo; And he spoke the
  truth; yet despite the disguise he clearly recognized the
  &ldquo;Cyprian.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. -- DEMOCRATES AND THE TEMPTER</h2>

  <p class="first">In the northern quarter of Athens the suburb of Alopece
  thrust itself under the slopes of Mt. Lycabettus, that pyramid of tawny rock
  which formed the rear bulwark, as it were, of every landscape of Athens. The
  dwellings in the suburb were poor, though few even in the richer quarters
  were at all handsome; the streets barely sixteen feet wide, ill-paved,
  filthy, dingy. A line of dirty gray stucco house-fronts was broken only by
  the small doors and the smaller windows in the second story. Occasionally a
  two-faced bust of Hermes stood before a portal, or a marble lion&rsquo;s head
  spouted into a corner water trough. All Athenian streets resembled these. The
  citizen had his Pnyx, his Jury-Court, his gossiping Agora for his day. These
  dingy streets sufficed for the dogs, the slaves, and the women, whom wise
  Zeus ordered to remain at home.</p>

  <p>Phormio the fishmonger had returned from his traffic, and sat in his
  house-door meditating over a pot of sour wine and watching the last light
  flickering on the great bulk of the mountain. He had his sorrows,&mdash;good
  man,&mdash;for Lampaxo his worthy wife, long of tongue, short of temper,
  thrifty and very watchful, was reminding him for the seventh time that he had
  sold a carp half an obol too cheap. His patience indeed that evening was so
  near to exhaustion that after cursing inwardly the &ldquo;match-maker&rdquo;
  who had saddled this Amazon upon him, he actually found courage for an
  outbreak. He threw up his arms after the manner of a tragic actor:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, true is the word of Hesiod!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True is what?&rdquo; flew back none too gently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;The fool first suffers and is after wise.&rsquo; Woman, I
  am resolved.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On what?&rdquo; Lampaxo&rsquo;s voice was soft as broken glass.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Years increase. I shan&rsquo;t live long. We are childless. I will
  provide for you in my will by giving you in marriage to
  Hyperphon.&rdquo;(3)</p>

  <p class="footnote">[3 Attic law allowed a husband to will his wife to a
  friend.]</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hyperphon!&rdquo; screamed the virago, &ldquo;Hyperphon the
  beggarly hunchback, the laughing-stock of Athens! O Mother Hera!&mdash;but I
  see the villain&rsquo;s aim. You are weary of me. Then divorce me like an
  honourable man. Send me back to Polus my dear brother. Ah, you sheep, you are
  silent! You think of the two-minæ dowry you must then refund. Woe is me!
  I&rsquo;ll go to the King Archon. I&rsquo;ll charge you with gross abuse. The
  jury will condemn you. There&rsquo;ll be fines, fetters, stocks,
  prison&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; groaned Phormio, terrified at the Gorgon, &ldquo;I
  only thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How dared you think? What permitted&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good evening, sweet sister and Phormio!&rdquo; The salutation came
  from Polus, who with Clearchus had approached unheralded. Lampaxo smoothed
  her ruffled feathers. Phormio stifled his sorrows. Dromo, the half-starved
  slave-boy, brought a pot of thin wine to his betters. The short southern
  twilight was swiftly passing into night. Groups of young men wandered past,
  bound homeward from the Cynosarges, the Academy, or some other well-loved
  gymnasium. In an hour the streets would be dark and still, except for a
  belated guest going to his banquet, a Scythian constable, or perhaps a cloak
  thief. For your Athenian, when he had no supper invitation, went to bed early
  and rose early, loving the sunlight far better than the flicker of his
  uncertain lamps.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And did the jury vote &lsquo;guilty&rsquo;?&rdquo; was
  Phormio&rsquo;s first question of his brother-in-law.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We were patriotically united. There were barely any white beans for
  acquittal in the urn. The scoundrelly grain-dealer is stripped of all he
  possesses and sent away to beg in exile. A noble service to
  Athens!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Despite the evidence,&rdquo; murmured Clearchus; but
  Lampaxo&rsquo;s shrill voice answered her brother:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion you jurors should look into a case directly
  opposite this house. Spies, I say, Persian spies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Spies!&rdquo; cried Polus, leaping up as from a coal; &ldquo;why,
  Phormio, haven&rsquo;t you denounced them? It&rsquo;s compounding with
  treason even to fail to report&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace, brother,&rdquo; chuckled the fishmonger, &ldquo;your sister
  smells for treason as a dog for salt fish. There is a barbarian carpet
  merchant&mdash;a Babylonian, I presume&mdash;who has taken the empty chambers
  above Demas&rsquo;s shield factory opposite. He seems a quiet, inoffensive
  man; there are a hundred other foreign merchants in the city. One can&rsquo;t
  cry &lsquo;Traitor!&rsquo; just because the poor wight was not born to speak
  Greek.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not like Babylonish merchants,&rdquo; propounded Polus,
  dogmatically; &ldquo;to the jury with him, I say!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At least he has a visitor,&rdquo; asserted Clearchus, who had long
  been silent. &ldquo;See, a gentleman wrapped in a long himation is going up
  to the door and standing up his walking stick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And if I have eyes,&rdquo; vowed the juror, squinting through his
  hands in the half light, &ldquo;that closely wrapped man is Glaucon the
  Alcmæonid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or Democrates,&rdquo; remarked Clearchus; &ldquo;they look much
  alike from behind. It&rsquo;s getting dark.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; decided Phormio, &ldquo;we can easily tell. He has
  left his stick below by the door. Steal across, Polus, and fetch it. It must
  be carved with the owner&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The juror readily obeyed; but to read the few characters on the crooked
  handle was beyond the learning of any save Clearchus, whose art demanded the
  mystery of writing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was wrong,&rdquo; he confessed, after long scrutiny, &ldquo;
  &lsquo;Glaucon, son of Conon.&rsquo; It is very plain. Put the cane back,
  Polus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The cane was returned, but the juror pulled a very long face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear friends, here is a man I&rsquo;ve already suspected of
  undemocratic sentiments conferring with a Barbarian. Good patriots cannot be
  too vigilant. A plot, I assert. Treason to Athens and Hellas! Freedom&rsquo;s
  in danger. Henceforth I shall look on Glaucon the Alcmæonid as an enemy of
  liberty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Phui!</i>&rdquo; almost shouted Phormio, whose sense of humour
  was keen, &ldquo;a noble conspiracy! Glaucon the Fortunate calls on a
  Babylonish merchant by night. You say to plot against Athens. I say to buy
  his pretty wife a carpet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The gods will some day explain,&rdquo; said Clearchus, winding up
  the argument,&mdash;and so for a little while the four forgot all about
  Glaucon.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Despite the cane, Clearchus was right. The visitor was
  Democrates. The orator mounted the dark stair above the shield-factory and
  knocked against a door, calling, &ldquo;<i>Pai! Pai!</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;Boy!
  boy!&rdquo; a summons answered by none other than the ever smiling Hiram. The
  Athenian, however, was little prepared for the luxury, nay splendour, which
  greeted him, once the Ph&oelig;nician had opened the door. The bare chamber
  had been transformed. The foot sank into the glowing carpets of Kerman and
  Bactria. The gold-embroidered wall tapestries were of Sidonian purple. The
  divans were covered with wondrous stuff which Democrates could not
  name,&mdash;another age would call it silk. A tripod smoked with fragrant
  Arabian frankincense. Silver lamps, swinging from silver chains, gave
  brilliant light. The Athenian stood wonderbound, until a voice, not
  Hiram&rsquo;s, greeted him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Welcome, Athenian,&rdquo; spoke the Cyprian, in his quaint, eastern
  accent. It was the strange guest in the tavern by Corinth. The
  Prince&mdash;prince surely, whatever his other title&mdash;was in the same
  rich dress as at the Isthmus, only his flowing beard had been dyed raven
  black. Yet Democrates&rsquo;s eyes were diverted instantly to the peculiarly
  handsome slave-boy on the divan beside his master. The boy&rsquo;s dress, of
  a rare blue stuff, enveloped him loosely. His hair was as golden as the gold
  thread on the round cap. In the shadows the face almost escaped the
  orator,&mdash;he thought he saw clear blue eyes and a marvellously brilliant,
  almost girlish, bloom and freshness. The presence of this slave caused the
  Athenian to hesitate, but the Cyprian bade him be seated, with one commanding
  wave of the hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is Smerdis, my constant companion. He is a mute. Yet if
  otherwise, I would trust him as myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates, putting by surprise, began to look on his host fixedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Barbarian, for that you are a Hellene you will not pretend,
  you realize, I trust, you incur considerable danger in visiting
  Athens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am not anxious,&rdquo; observed the Prince, composedly.
  &ldquo;Hiram is watchful and skilful. You see I have dyed my hair and beard
  black and pass for a Babylonish merchant.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With all except me, <i>philotate</i>,&mdash;&lsquo;dearest
  friend,&rsquo; as we say in Athens.&rdquo; Democrates&rsquo;s smile was not
  wholly agreeable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With all except you,&rdquo; assented the Prince, fingering the
  scarlet tassel of the cushion whereon he sat. &ldquo;I reckoned confidently
  that you would come to visit me when I sent Hiram to you. Yes&mdash;I have
  heard the story that is on your tongue: one of Themistocles&rsquo;s
  busybodies has brought a rumour that a certain great man of the Persian court
  is missing from the side of his master, and you have been requested to greet
  that nobleman heartily if he should come to Athens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know a great deal!&rdquo; cried the orator, feeling his
  forehead grow hot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is pleasant to know a great deal,&rdquo; smiled back the Prince,
  carelessly, while Hiram entered with a tray and silver goblets brimming with
  violet-flavoured sherbet; &ldquo;I have innumerable
  &lsquo;Eyes-and-ears.&rsquo; You have heard the name? One of the chief
  officers of his Majesty is &lsquo;The Royal Eye.&rsquo; You Athenians are a
  valiant and in many things a wise people, yet you could grow in wisdom by
  looking well to the East.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am confident,&rdquo; exclaimed Democrates, thrusting back the
  goblet, &ldquo;if your Excellency requires a noble game of wits, you can have
  one. I need only step to the window, and cry &lsquo;Spies!&rsquo;&mdash;after
  which your Excellency can exercise your wisdom and eloquence defending your
  life before one of our Attic juries.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which is a polite and patriotic manner of saying, dearest Athenian,
  you are not prepared to push matters to such unfortunate extremity. I omit
  what his Majesty might do in the way of taking vengeance; sufficient that if
  aught unfortunate befalls me, or Hiram, or this my slave Smerdis, while we
  are in Athens, a letter comes to your noble chief Themistocles from the
  banker Pittacus of Argos.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates, who had risen to his feet, had been flushed before. He became
  pale now. The hand that clutched the purple tapestry was trembling. The words
  rose to his lips, the lips refused to utter them. The Prince, who had
  delivered his threat most quietly, went on, &ldquo;In short, good Democrates,
  I was aware before I came to Athens of our necessities, and I came because I
  was certain I could relieve them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; The orator shot the word out desperately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are a Hellene.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I ashamed of it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not, however, affect to be more virtuous than your race.
  Persians make their boast of truth-telling and fidelity. You Hellenes, I
  hear, have even a god&mdash;Hermes Dolios,&mdash;who teaches you lying and
  thieving. The customs of nations differ. Mazda the Almighty alone knoweth
  which is best. Follow then the customs of Hellenes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You speak in riddles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Plainer, then. You know the master I serve. You guess who I am,
  though you shall not name me. For what sum will you serve Xerxes the Great
  King?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The orator&rsquo;s breath came deep. His hands clasped and unclasped, then
  were pressed behind his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I told Lycon, and I tell you, I am no traitor to Hellas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which means, of course, you demand a fair price. I am not angry.
  You will find a Persian pays like the lord he is, and that his darics always
  ring true metal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hear no more. I was a fool to meet Lycon at Corinth,
  doubly a fool to meet you to-night. Farewell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates seized the latch. The door was locked. He turned furiously on
  the Barbarian. &ldquo;Do you keep me by force? Have a care. I can be terrible
  if driven to bay. The window is open. One shout&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Cyprian had risen, and quietly, but with a grip like iron on
  Democrates&rsquo;s wrist, led the orator back to the divan.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can go free in a twinkling, but hear you shall. Before you
  boast of your power, you shall know all of mine. I will recite your
  condition. Contradict if I say anything amiss. Your father Myscelus was of
  the noble house of Codrus, a great name in Athens, but he left you no large
  estate. You were ambitious to shine as an orator and leader of the Athenians.
  To win popularity you have given great feasts. At the last festival of the
  Theseia you fed the poor of Athens on sixty oxen washed down with good
  Rhodian wine. All that made havoc in your patrimony.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Zeus, you speak as if you lived all your life in
  Athens!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have said &lsquo;I have many eyes.&rsquo; But to continue. You
  gave the price of the tackling for six of the triremes with which
  Themistocles pretends to believe he can beat back my master. Worse still, you
  have squandered many minæ on flute girls, dice, cock-fights, and other gentle
  pleasures. In short your patrimony is not merely exhausted but overspent.
  That, however, is not the most wonderful part of my recital.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How dare you pry into my secrets?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be appeased, dear Athenian; it is much more interesting to know you
  deny nothing of all I say. It is now five months since you were appointed by
  your sagacious Athenian assembly as commissioner to administer the silver
  taken from the mines at Laurium and devoted to your navy. You fulfilled the
  people&rsquo;s confidence by diverting much of this money to the payment of
  your own great debts to the banker Pittacus of Argos. At present you are
  &lsquo;watching the moon,&rsquo; as you say here in Athens,&mdash;I mean,
  that at the end of this month you must account to the people for all the
  money you have handled, and at this hour are at your wits&rsquo; ends to know
  whence the repayment will come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is all you know of me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates sighed with relief. &ldquo;Then you have yet to complete the
  story, my dear Barbarian. I have adventured on half the cargo of a large
  merchantman bringing timber and tin from Massalia; I look every day for a
  messenger from Corinth with news of her safe arrival. Upon her coming I can
  make good all I owe and still be a passing rich man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>If the Cyprian was discomposed at this announcement, he did not betray
  it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The sea is frightfully uncertain, good Democrates. Upon it, as many
  fortunes are lost as are made.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have offered due prayers to Poseidon, and vowed a gold tripod on
  the ship&rsquo;s arrival.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So even your gods in Hellas have their price,&rdquo; was the
  retort, with an ill-concealed sneer. &ldquo;Do not trust them. Take ten
  talents from me and to-night sleep sweetly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your price?&rdquo; the words slipped forth involuntarily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Themistocles&rsquo;s private memoranda for the battle-order of your
  new fleet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Avert it, gods! The ship will reach Corinth, I warn
  you&mdash;&rdquo; Democrates&rsquo;s gestures became menacing, as again he
  rose, &ldquo;I will set you in Themistocles&rsquo;s hand as
  soon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But not to-night.&rdquo; The Prince rose, smiled, held out his
  hand. &ldquo;Unbar the door for his Excellency, Hiram. And you, noble sir,
  think well of all I said at Corinth on the certain victory of my master;
  think also&mdash;&rdquo; the voice fell&mdash;&ldquo;how Democrates the
  Codrid could be sovereign of Athens under the protection of
  Persia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I tyrant of Athens?&rdquo; the orator clapped his hand behind his
  back; &ldquo;you say enough. Good evening.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was on the threshold, when the slave-boy touched his master&rsquo;s
  hand in silent signal.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And if there be any fair woman you desire,&rdquo;&mdash;how gliding
  the Cyprian&rsquo;s voice!&mdash;&ldquo;shall not the power of Xerxes the
  great give her unto you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Why did Democrates feel his forehead turn to flame? Why&mdash;almost
  against will&mdash;did he stretch forth his hand to the Cyprian? He went down
  the stair scarce feeling the steps beneath him. At the bottom voices greeted
  him from across the darkened street.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fair evening, Master Glaucon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fair evening,&rdquo; his mechanical answer; then to himself; as
  he walked away, &ldquo;Wherefore call me Glaucon? I have somewhat his height,
  though not his shoulder. Ah,&mdash;I know it, I have chanced to borrow his
  carved walking-stick. Impudent creatures to read the name!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had not far to go. Athens was compactly built, all quarters close
  together. Yet before he reached home and bed, he was fighting back an
  ill-defined but terrible thought. &ldquo;Glaucon! They think I am Glaucon. If
  I chose to betray the Cyprian&mdash;&rdquo; Further than that he would not
  suffer the thought to go. He lay sleepless, fighting against it. The dark was
  full of the harpies of uncanny suggestion. He arose unrefreshed, to proffer
  every god the same prayer: &ldquo;Deliver me from evil imaginings. Speed the
  ship to Corinth.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. -- ON THE ACROPOLIS</h2>

  <p class="first">The Acropolis of Athens rises as does no other citadel in
  the world. Had no workers in marble or bronze, no weavers of eloquence or
  song, dwelt beneath its shadow, it would stand the centre and cynosure of a
  remarkable landscape. It is &ldquo;<i>The Rock</i>,&rdquo; no other like unto
  it. Is it enough to say its ruddy limestone rises as a huge boulder one
  hundred and fifty feet above the plain, that its breadth is five hundred, its
  length one thousand? Numbers and measures can never disclose a
  soul,&mdash;and the Rock of Athens has all but a soul: a soul seems to glow
  through its adamant when the fire-footed morning steals over the long crest
  of Hymettus, and touches the citadel&rsquo;s red bulk with unearthly
  brightness; a soul when the day falls to sleep in the arms of night as Helios
  sinks over the western hill by Daphni. Then the Rock seems to throb and burn
  with life again.</p>

  <p>It is so bare that the hungry goats can hardly crop one spear of grass
  along its jagged slopes. It is so steep it scarce needs defence against an
  army. It is so commanding that he who stands on the westmost pinnacle can
  look across the windy hill of the Pnyx, across the brown plain-land and down
  to the sparkling blue sea with the busy havens of Peiræus and Phalerum, the
  scattered gray isles of the Ægean, and far away to the domelike crest of
  Acro-Corinthus. Let him turn to the right: below him nestles the gnarled hill
  of Areopagus, home of the Furies, the buzzing plaza of the Agora, the closely
  clustered city. Behind, there spread mountain, valley, plain,&mdash;here
  green, here brown, here golden,&mdash;with Pentelicus the Mighty rearing
  behind all, his summits fretted white, not with winter snows, but with
  lustrous marble. Look to the left: across the view passes the shaggy ridge of
  Hymettus, arid and scarred, as if wrought by the Titans, home only of goats
  and bees, of nymphs and satyrs.</p>

  <p>That was almost the self-same vision in the dim past when the first savage
  clambered this &ldquo;Citadel of Cecrops&rdquo; and spoke, &ldquo;Here is my
  dwelling-place.&rdquo; This will be the vision until earth and ocean are no
  more. The human habitation changes, the temples rise and crumble; the red and
  gray rock, the crystalline air, the sapphire sea, come from the god, and
  these remain.</p>

  <p>Glaucon and Hermione were come together to offer thanks to Athena for the
  glory of the Isthmus. The athlete had already mounted the citadel heading a
  myrtle-crowned procession to bear a formal thanksgiving, but his wife had not
  then been with him. Now they would go together, without pomp. They walked
  side by side. Nimble Chloë tripped behind with her mistress&rsquo;s parasol.
  Old Manes bore the bloodless sacrifice, but Hermione said in her heart there
  came two too many.</p>

  <p>Many a friendly eye, many a friendly word, followed as they crossed the
  Agora, where traffic was in its morning bustle. Glaucon answered every
  greeting with his winsome smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All Athens seems our friend!&rdquo; he said, as close by the
  Tyrannicides&rsquo; statues at the upper end of the plaza a grave councilman
  bowed and an old bread woman left her stall to bob a courtesy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is <i>your</i> friend,&rdquo; corrected Hermione, thinking only of
  her husband, &ldquo;for I have won no pentathlon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>makaira</i>, dearest and best,&rdquo; he answered, looking
  not on the glorious citadel but on her face, &ldquo;could I have won the
  parsley wreath had there been no better wreath awaiting me at Eleusis? And
  to-day I am gladdest of the glad. For the gods have sent me blessings beyond
  desert, I no longer fear their envy as once. I enjoy honour with all good
  men. I have no enemy in the world. I have the dearest of friends, Cimon,
  Themistocles&mdash;beyond all, Democrates. I am blessed in love beyond Peleus
  espoused to Thetis, or Anchises beloved of Aphrodite, for my golden Aphrodite
  lives not on Olympus, nor Paphos, nor comes on her doves from Cythera, but
  dwells&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace.&rdquo; The hand laid on his mouth was small but firm.
  &ldquo;Do not anger the goddess by likening me unto her. It is joy enough for
  me if I can look up at the sun and say, &lsquo;I keep the love of Glaucon the
  Fortunate and the Good.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walking thus in their golden dream, the two crossed the Agora, turned to
  the left from the Pnyx, and by crooked lanes went past the craggy rock of
  Areopagus, till before them rose a wooden palisade and a gate. Through this a
  steep path led upward to the citadel. Not to the Acropolis of fame. The
  buildings then upon the Rock in one short year would lie in heaps of
  fire-scarred ruin. Yet in that hour before Glaucon and Hermione a not
  unworthy temple rose, the old &ldquo;House of Athena,&rdquo; prototype of the
  later Parthenon. In the morning light it stood in beauty&mdash;a hundred
  Doric columns, a sculptured pediment, flashing with white marble and with
  tints of scarlet, blue, and gold. Below it, over the irregular plateau of the
  Rock, spread avenues of votive statues of gods and heroes in stone, bronze,
  or painted wood. Here and there were numerous shrines and small temples, and
  a giant altar for burning a hundred oxen. So hand in hand the twain went to
  the bronze portal of the Temple. The kindly old priest on guard smiled as he
  sprinkled them with the purifying salt water out of the brazen laver. The
  door closed behind them. For a moment they seemed to stand in the high temple
  in utter darkness. Then far above through the marble roof a softened light
  came creeping toward them. As from unfolding mist, the great calm face of the
  ancient goddess looked down with its unchanging smile. A red coal glowed on
  the tripod at her feet. Glaucon shook incense over the brazier. While it
  smoked, Hermione laid the crown of lilies between the knees of the half-seen
  image, then her husband lifted his hands and prayed aloud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Athena, Virgin, Queen, Deviser of Wisdom,&mdash;whatever be the
  name thou lovest best,&mdash;accept this offering and hear. Bless now us
  both. Give us to strive for the noblest, to speak the wise word, to love one
  another. Give us prosperity, but not unto pride. Bless all our friends; but
  if we have enemies, be thou their enemy also. And so shall we praise thee
  forever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This was all the prayer and worship. A little more meditation, then
  husband and wife went forth from the sacred cella. The panorama&mdash;rocks,
  plain, sea, and bending heavens&mdash;opened before them in glory. The light
  faded upon the purple breasts of the western mountains. Behind the Acropolis,
  Lycabettus&rsquo;s pyramid glowed like a furnace. The marble on distant
  Pentelicus shone dazzlingly.</p>

  <p>Glaucon stood on the easternmost pinnacle of the Rock, watching the
  landscape.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Joy, <i>makaira</i>, joy,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;we possess one
  another. We dwell in &lsquo;violet-crowned Athens&rsquo;; for what else dare
  we to pray?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Hermione pointed less pleased toward the crest of Pentelicus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Behold it! How swiftly yonder gray cloud comes on a rushing wind!
  It will cover the brightness. The omen is bad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why bad, <i>makaira</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The cloud is the Persian. He hangs to-day as a thunder-cloud above
  Athens and Hellas. Xerxes will come. And you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She pressed closer to her husband.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why speak of me?&rdquo; he asked lightly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Xerxes brings war. War brings sorrow to women. It is not the
  hateful and old that the spears and the arrows love best.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Half compelled by the omen, half by a sudden burst of unoccasioned fear,
  her eyes shone with tears; but her husband&rsquo;s laugh rang clearly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Euge!</i> dry your eyes, and look before you. King Æolus
  scatters the cloud upon his briskest winds. It breaks into a thousand bits.
  So shall Themistocles scatter the hordes of Xerxes. The Persian shadow shall
  come, shall go, and again we shall be happy in beautiful Athens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Athena grant it!&rdquo; prayed Hermione.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We can trust the goddess,&rdquo; returned Glaucon, not to be shaken
  from his happy mood. &ldquo;And now that we have paid our vows to her, let us
  descend. Our friends are already waiting for us by the Pnyx before they go
  down to the harbours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As they went down the steep, Cimon and Democrates came running to join
  them, and in the brisk chatter that arose the omen of the cloud and fears of
  the Persian faded from Hermione&rsquo;s mind.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was a merry party such as often went down to the havens
  of Athens in the springtime and summer: a dozen gentlemen, old and young, for
  the most part married, and followed demurely by their wives with the
  latter&rsquo;s maids, and many a stout Thracian slave tugging hampers of meat
  and drink. Laughter there was, admixed with wiser talk; friends walking by
  twos and threes, with Themistocles, as always, seeming to mingle with all and
  to surpass every one both in jests and in wisdom. So they fared down across
  the broad plain-land to the harbours, till the hill Munychia rose steep
  before them. A scramble over a rocky, ill-marked way led to the top; then
  before them broke a second view comparable almost to that from the Rock of
  Athena: at their feet lay the four blue havens of Athens, to the right
  Phaleron, closer at hand the land-locked bay of Munychia, beyond that Zea,
  beyond that still a broader sheet&mdash;Peiræus, the new war-harbour of
  Athens. They could look down on the brown roofs of the port-town, the forest
  of masts, the merchantman unloading lumber from the Euxine, the merchantman
  loading dried figs for Syria; but most of all on the numbers of long black
  hulls, some motionless on the placid harbour, some propped harmlessly on the
  shore. Hermione clouded as she saw them, and glanced away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not love your new fleet, Themistocles,&rdquo; she said,
  frowning at the handsome statesman; &ldquo;I do not love anything that tells
  so clearly of war. It mars the beauty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rather you should rejoice we have so fair a wooden wall against the
  Barbarian, dear lady,&rdquo; answered he, quite at ease. &ldquo;What can we
  do to hearten her, Democrates?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Were I only Zeus,&rdquo; rejoined the orator, who never was far
  from his best friend&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;I would cast two thunderbolts, one
  to destroy Xerxes, the second to blast Themistocles&rsquo;s armada,&mdash;so
  would the Lady Hermione be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry, then, you are not the Olympian,&rdquo; said the woman,
  half smiling at the pleasantry. Cimon interrupted them. Some of the party had
  caught a sun-burned shepherd in among the rocks, a veritable Pan in his
  shaggy goat-skin. The bribe of two obols brought him out with his pipe. Four
  of the slave-boys fell to dancing. The party sat down upon the burnt
  grass,&mdash;eating, drinking, wreathing poppy-crowns, and watching the
  nimble slaves and the ships that crawled like ants in the haven and bay
  below. Thus passed the noon, and as the sun dropped toward craggy Salamis
  across the strait, the men of the party wandered down to the ports and found
  boats to take them out upon the bay.</p>

  <p>The wind was a zephyr. The water spread blue and glassy. The sun was
  sinking as a ball of infinite light. Themistocles, Democrates, and Glaucon
  were in one skiff, the athlete at the oars. They glided past the scores of
  black triremes swinging lazily at anchor. Twice they pulled around the
  proudest of the fleet,&mdash;the <i>Nausicaä</i>, the gift of Hermippus to
  the state, a princely gift even in days when every Athenian put his all at
  the public service. She would be Themistocles&rsquo;s flag-ship. The young
  men noted her fine lines, her heavy side timbers, the covered decks, an
  innovation in Athenian men-of-war, and Themistocles put a loving hand on the
  keen bronze beak as they swung around the prow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a tooth for the Persian king!&rdquo; he was laughing,
  when a second skiff, rounding the trireme in an opposite direction, collided
  abruptly. A lurch, a few splinters was all the hurt, but as the boats parted
  Themistocles rose from his seat in the stern, staring curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Barbarians, by Athena&rsquo;s owls, the knave at the oars is a
  sleek Syrian, and his master and the boy from the East too. What business
  around our war-fleet? Row after them, Glaucon; we&rsquo;ll
  question&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon does no such folly,&rdquo; spoke Democrates, instantly,
  from the bow; &ldquo;if the harbour-watch doesn&rsquo;t interfere with honest
  traders, what&rsquo;s it to us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As you like it.&rdquo; Themistocles resumed his seat. &ldquo;Yet it
  would do no harm. Now they row to another trireme. With what falcon eyes the
  master of the trio examines it! Something uncanny, I repeat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To examine everything strange,&rdquo; proclaimed Democrates,
  sententiously, &ldquo;needs the life of a crow, who, they say, lives a
  thousand years, but I don&rsquo;t see any black wings budding on
  Themistocles&rsquo;s shoulders. Pull onward, Glaucon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whither?&rdquo; demanded the rower.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Salamis,&rdquo; ordered Themistocles. &ldquo;Let us see the
  battle-place foretold by the oracle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Salamis or clear to Crete,&rdquo; rejoined Glaucon, setting his
  strength upon the oars and making the skiff bound, &ldquo;if we can find
  water deep enough to drown those gloomy looks that have sat on
  Democrates&rsquo;s brows of late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not gloomy but serious,&rdquo; said the young orator, with an
  attempt at lightness; &ldquo;I have been preparing my oration against the
  contractor I&rsquo;ve indicted for embezzling the public naval
  stores.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Destroy the man!&rdquo; cried the rower.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And yet I really pity him; he was under great
  temptation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No excuses; the man who robs the city in days like these is worse
  than he who betrays fortresses in most wars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see you are a savage patriot, Glaucon,&rdquo; said Themistocles,
  &ldquo;despite your Adonis face. We are fairly upon the bay; our nearest
  eavesdroppers, yon fishermen, are a good five furlongs. Would you see
  something?&rdquo; Glaucon rested on the oars, while the statesman fumbled in
  his breast. He drew out a papyrus sheet, which he passed to the rower, he in
  turn to Democrates.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look well, then, for I think no Persian spies are here. A month
  long have I wrought on this bit of papyrus. All my wisdom flowed out of my
  pen when I spread the ink. In short here is the ordering of the ships of the
  allied Greeks when we meet Xerxes in battle. Leonidas and our other chiefs
  gave me the task when we met at Corinth. To-day it is complete. Read it, for
  it is precious. Xerxes would give twenty talents for this one leaf from
  Egypt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The young men peered at the sheet curiously. The details and diagrams were
  few and easy to remember, the Athenian ships here, the Æginetan next, the
  Corinthian next, and so with the other allies. A few comments on the use of
  the light penteconters behind the heavy triremes. A few more comments on
  Xerxes&rsquo;s probable naval tactics. Only the knowledge that Themistocles
  never committed himself in speech or writing without exhausting every
  expedient told the young men of the supreme importance of the paper. After
  due inspection the statesman replaced it in his breast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You two have seen this,&rdquo; he announced, seemingly proud of his
  handiwork; &ldquo;Leonidas shall see this, then Xerxes, and after
  that&mdash;&rdquo; he laughed, but not in jest&mdash;&ldquo;men will remember
  Themistocles, son of Neocles!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The three lapsed into silence for a moment. The skiff was well out upon
  the sea. The shadows of the hills of Salamis and of Ægelaos, the opposing
  mountain of Attica, were spreading over them. Around the islet of Psyttaleia
  in the strait the brown fisher-boats were gliding. Beyond the strait opened
  the blue hill-girdled bay of Eleusis, now turning to fire in the evening sun.
  Everything was peaceful, silent, beautiful. Again Glaucon rested on his oars
  and let his eyes wander.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How true is the word of Thales the Sage,&rdquo; he spoke; &ldquo;
  &lsquo;the world is the fairest of all fair things, because it is the work of
  God.&rsquo; It cannot be that, here, between these purple hills and the
  glistening sea, there will come that battle beside which the strife of
  Achilles and Hector before Troy shall pass as nothing!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We do not know; we are dice in the high gods&rsquo; dice-boxes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Man all vainly shall scan the mind of the Prince of
  Olympus.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We can say nothing wiser than that. We can but use our Attic mother
  wit, and trust the rest to destiny. Let us be satisfied if we hope that
  destiny is not blind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They drifted many moments in silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The sun sinks lower,&rdquo; spoke Democrates, at length; &ldquo;so
  back again to the havens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On the return Themistocles once more vowed he caught a glimpse of the
  skiff of the unknown foreigners, but Democrates called it mere phantasy.
  Hermione met them at the Peiræus, and the party wandered back through the
  gathering dusk to the city, where each little group went its way.
  Themistocles went to his own house, where he said he expected Sicinnus; Cimon
  and Democrates sought a tavern for an evening cup; Glaucon and Hermione
  hastened to their house in the Colonus suburb near the trickling Cephissus,
  where in the starlit night the tettix(4) in the black old olives by the
  stream made its monotonous music, where great fireflies gleamed, where
  Philomela the nightingale called, and the tall plane trees whispered softly
  to the pines. When Hermione fell asleep, she had forgotten about the coming
  of the Persian, and dreamed that Glaucon was Eros, she was Psyche, and that
  Zeus was giving her the wings of a butterfly and a crown of stars.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[4 A kind of grasshopper peculiar to Greece.]</p>

  <p>Democrates went home later. After the heady Pramnian at the tavern, he
  roved away with Cimon and others to serenade beneath the lattice of a
  lady&mdash;none too prudish&mdash;in the Ceramicus quarter. But the fair one
  was cruel that night, and her slaves repelled the minstrels with pails of hot
  water from an upper window. Democrates thereupon quitted the party. His head
  was very befogged, but he could not expel one idea from it&mdash;that
  Themistocles had revealed that day a priceless secret, that the statesman and
  Glaucon and he himself were the only men who shared it, and that it was
  believed that Glaucon had visited the Babylonish carpet-seller. Joined to
  this was an overpowering consciousness that Helen of Troy was not so lovely
  as Hermione of Eleusis. When he came to his lodgings, however, his wits
  cleared in a twinkling after he had read two letters. The first was
  short.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Themistocles to Democrates:&mdash;This evening I begin to discover
  something. Sicinnus, who has been searching in Athens, is certain there is a
  Persian agent in the city. Seize him.&mdash;<i>Chaire.</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The second was shorter. It came from Corinth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Socias the merchant to Democrates:&mdash;Tyrrhenian pirates have
  taken the ship. Lading and crew are utterly
  lost.&mdash;<i>Chaire.</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The orator never closed his eyes that night.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. -- THE CYPRIAN TRIUMPHS</h2>

  <p class="first">Democrates fronted ruin. What profit later details from
  Socias of the capture of the merchantman? Unless three days before the coming
  festival of the Panathenæa the orator could find a large sum, he was forever
  undone. His sequestering of the ship-money would become public property. He
  would be tried for his life. Themistocles would turn against him. The jury
  would hardly wait for the evidence. He would drink the poisonous hemlock and
  his corpse be picked by the crows in the Barathrum,&mdash;an open pit, sole
  burial place for Athenian criminals.</p>

  <p>One thing was possible: to go to Glaucon, confess all, and beg the money.
  Glaucon was rich. He could have the amount from Conon and Hermippus for the
  asking. But Democrates knew Glaucon well enough to perceive that while the
  athlete might find the money, he would be horrified at the foul disclosure.
  He would save his old comrade from death, but their friendship would be
  ended. He would feel in duty bound to tell Themistocles enough to ruin
  Democrates&rsquo;s political prospects for all time. An appeal to Glaucon was
  therefore dismissed, and the politician looked for more desperate
  remedies.</p>

  <p>Democrates enjoyed apartments on the street of the Tripods east of the
  Acropolis, a fashionable promenade of Athens. He was regarded as a confirmed
  bachelor. If, therefore, two or three dark-eyed flute girls in Phaleron had
  helped him to part with a good many minæ, no one scolded too loudly; the
  thing had been done genteelly and without scandal. Democrates affected to be
  a collector of fine arms and armour. The ceiling of his living room was hung
  with white-plumed helmets, on the walls glittered brass greaves, handsomely
  embossed shields, inlaid Chalcidian scimitars, and bows tipped with gold.
  Under foot were expensive rugs. The orator&rsquo;s artistic tastes were
  excellent. Even as he sat in the deeply pillowed arm-chair his eye lighted on
  a Nike,&mdash;a statuette of the precious Corinthian bronze, a treasure for
  which the dealer&rsquo;s unpaid account lay still, alas! in the
  orator&rsquo;s coffer.</p>

  <p>But Democrates was not thinking so much of the unpaid bronze-smith as of
  divers weightier debts. On the evening in question he had ordered Bias, the
  sly Thracian, out of the room; with his own hands had barred the door and
  closed the lattice; then with stealthy step thrust back the scarlet wall
  tapestry to disclose a small door let into the plaster. A key made the door
  open into a cupboard, out of which Democrates drew a brass-bound box of no
  great size, which he carried gingerly to a table and opened with a complex
  key.</p>

  <p>The contents of the box were curious, to a stranger enigmatic. Not money,
  nor jewels, but rolls of closely written papyri, and things which the orator
  studied more intently,&mdash;a number of hard bits of clay bearing the
  impressions of seals. As Democrates fingered these, his face might have
  betrayed a mingling of keen fear and keener satisfaction.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no such collection in all Hellas,&mdash;no, not in the
  world,&rdquo; ran his commentary; &ldquo;here is the signet of the Tagos of
  Thessaly, here of the B&oelig;otarch of Thebes, here of the King of Argos. I
  was able to secure the seal of Leonidas while in Corinth. This, of course, is
  Themistocles&rsquo;s,&mdash;how easily I took it! And this&mdash;of less
  value perhaps to a man of the world&mdash;is of my beloved Glaucon. And here
  are twenty more. Then the papyri,&rdquo;&mdash;he unrolled them lovingly, one
  after another,&mdash;&ldquo;precious specimens, are they not? Ah, by Zeus, I
  must be a very merciful and pious man, or I&rsquo;d have used that dreadful
  power heaven has given me and never have drifted into these
  straits.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>What that &ldquo;power&rdquo; was with which Democrates felt himself
  endued he did not even whisper to himself. His mood changed suddenly. He
  closed the box with a snap and locked it hurriedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cursed casket!&mdash;I think I would be happier if Phorcys, the old
  man of the deep, could drown it all! I would be better for it and kept from
  foul thoughts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He thrust the box back in the cupboard, drew forth a second like it,
  unlocked it, and took out more writings. Selecting two, he spread ink and
  papyrus before him, and copied with feverish haste. Once he hesitated, and
  almost flung back the writings into the casket. Once he glanced at the notes
  he had prepared for his speech against the defrauding contractor. He grimaced
  bitterly. Then the hesitation ended. He finished the copying, replaced the
  second box, and barred and concealed the cupboard. He hid his new copies in
  his breast and called in Bias.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am going out, but I shall not be late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shall not Hylas and I go with lanterns?&rdquo; asked the fellow.
  &ldquo;Last night there were foot-pads.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need you,&rdquo; rejoined his master, brusquely.</p>

  <p>He went down into the dimly lighted street and wound through the maze of
  back alleys wherein Athens abounded, but Democrates never missed his way.
  Once he caught the glint of a lantern&mdash;a slave lighting home his master
  from dinner. The orator drew into a doorway; the others glided by, seeing
  nothing. Only when he came opposite the house of the Cyprian he saw light
  spreading from the opposite doorway and knew he must pass under curious eyes.
  Phormio was entertaining friends very late. But Democrates took boldness for
  safety, strode across the illumined ring, and up to the Cyprian&rsquo;s
  stairway. The buzz of conversation stopped a moment. &ldquo;Again
  Glaucon,&rdquo; he caught, but was not troubled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;if seen at all, there is no
  harm in such a mistake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The room was again glittering in its Oriental magnificence. The Cyprian
  advanced to meet his visitor, smiling blandly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Welcome, dear Athenian. We have awaited you. We are ready to heal
  your calamity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates turned away his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know it already! O Zeus, I am the most miserable man in all
  Hellas!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And wherefore miserable, good friend?&rdquo; The Cyprian half led,
  half compelled the visitor to a seat on the divan. &ldquo;Is it such to be
  enrolled from this day among the benefactors of my most gracious lord and
  king?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t goad me!&rdquo; Democrates wrung his hands. &ldquo;I am
  desperate. Take these papyri, read, pay, then let me never see your face
  again.&rdquo; He flung the two rolls in the Prince&rsquo;s lap and sat in
  abject misery.</p>

  <p>The other unrolled the writings deliberately, read slowly, motioned to
  Hiram, who also read them with catlike scrutiny. During all this not a word
  was spoken. Democrates observed the beautiful mute emerge from an inner
  chamber and silently take station at his master&rsquo;s side, following the
  papers also with wonderful, eager eyes. Only after a long interval the Prince
  spoke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;you bring what purports to be private memoranda of
  Themistocles on the equipment and arraying of the Athenian fleet. Yet these
  are only copies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Copies; the originals cannot stay in my possession. It were ruin to
  give them up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Prince turned to Hiram.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And do you say, from what you know of these things, these memoranda
  are genuine?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Genuine. That is the scanty wisdom of the least of your
  Highness&rsquo;s slaves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Oriental bowed himself, then stood erect in a manner that reminded
  Democrates of some serpent that had just coiled and uncoiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; continued the emissary; &ldquo;yet I must ask our good
  Athenian to confirm them with an oath.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The orator groaned. He had not expected this last humiliation; but being
  forced to drink the cup, he drained it to the lees. He swore by Zeus Orchios,
  Watcher of Oaths, and Dike, the Eternal Justice, that he brought true copies,
  and that if he was perjured, he called a curse upon himself and all his line.
  The Cyprian received his oath with calm satisfaction, then held out the half
  of a silver shekel broken in the middle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Show this to Mydon, the Sicyonian banker at Phaleron. He holds its
  counterpart. He will pay the man who completes the coin ten
  talents.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates received the token, but felt that he must stand upon his
  dignity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have given an oath, stranger, but give the like to me. What proof
  have I of this Mydon?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The question seemed to rouse the unseen lion in the Cyprian. His eye
  kindled. His voice swelled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We leave oaths, Hellene, to men of trade and barter, to men of
  trickery and guile. The Aryan noble is taught three things: to fear the king,
  to bend the bow, to speak the truth. And he learns all well. I have
  spoken,&mdash;my word is my oath.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Athenian shrank at the storm he had roused. But the Prince almost
  instantly curbed himself. His voice sank again to its easy tone of
  conciliation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So much for my word, good friend; yet better than an oath, look
  here. Can the man who bears this ring afford to tell a lie?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He extended his right hand. On the second finger was a huge beryl signet.
  Democrates bent over it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two seated Sphynxes and a winged cherub flying above,&mdash;the
  seal of the royal Achæmenians of Persia! You are sent by Xerxes himself. You
  are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Prince raised a warning finger. &ldquo;Hush, Athenian. Think what you
  will, but do not name me, though soon my name shall fly through all the
  world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; rejoined Democrates, his hands clutching the
  broken coin as at a last reprieve from death. &ldquo;But be warned, even
  though I bear you no good-will. Themistocles is suspicious. Sicinnus his
  agent, a sly cat, is searching for you. The other day Themistocles, in the
  boat at Peiræus, was fain to have you questioned. If detected, I cannot save
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Prince shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Democrates, I come of a race that trusts in the omnipotence of
  God and does the right. Duty requires me in Athens. What Ahura-Mazda and
  Mithra his glorious vicegerent will, that shall befall me, be I in Hellas or
  in safe Ecbatana. The decree of the Most High, written among the stars, is
  good. I do not shun it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The words were spoken candidly, reverently. Democrates drew toward the
  door, and the others did not strive to detain him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; spoke the Athenian; &ldquo;I have warned you.
  Trust then your God. I have sold myself this once, but do not call me friend.
  Necessity is a sharp goad. May our paths never cross again!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Until you again have need,&rdquo; said the Prince, not seeking to
  wring from the other any promise.</p>

  <p>Democrates muttered a sullen farewell and went down the dark stairs. The
  light in Phormio&rsquo;s house was out. No one seemed to be watching. On the
  way homeward Democrates comforted himself with the reflection that although
  the memoranda he sold were genuine, Themistocles often changed his plans, and
  he could see to it this scheme for arraying the war fleet was speedily
  altered. No real harm then would come to Hellas. And in his hand was the
  broken shekel,&mdash;the talisman to save him from destruction. Only when
  Democrates thought of Glaucon and Hermione he was fain to grit his teeth,
  while many times it returned to him, &ldquo;They think it was
  <i>Glaucon</i>who has been twice now to visit the Babylonish
  carpet-seller.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">As the door had closed behind the orator, the Prince had
  strode across the rugs to the window&mdash;and spat forth furiously as in
  extreme disgust.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fool, knave, villain! I foul my lips by speaking to his accursed
  ears!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The tongue in which he uttered this was the purest &ldquo;Royal
  Persian,&rdquo; such as one might hear in the king&rsquo;s court. The
  beautiful &ldquo;mute,&rdquo; mute no longer, glided across the chamber and
  laid both hands upon his shoulder with a gracious caress.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And yet you bear with these treacherous creatures, you speak them
  fair?&rdquo; was the remark in the same musical tongue.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, because there is sore need. Because, with all their
  faithlessness, covetousness, and guile, these Hellenes are the keenest,
  subtlest race beneath Mithra&rsquo;s glorious light. And we Persians must
  play with them, master them, and use them to make us lords of all the
  world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hiram had disappeared behind a curtain. The Prince lifted her silver
  embroidered red cap. Over the graceful shoulders fell a mass of clear gold
  hair, so golden one might have hidden shining darics within it. The shining
  head pressed against the Persian&rsquo;s breast. In this attitude, with the
  loose dress parting to show the tender lines, there could be no doubt of the
  other&rsquo;s sex. The Prince laid his hand upon her neck and drew her bright
  face nearer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is a mad adventure on which we two have come,&rdquo; he spoke;
  &ldquo;how nearly you were betrayed at the Isthmus, when the Athenian saved
  you! A blunder by Hiram, an ill-turn of Fate, will ruin us yet. It is far,
  Rose of Eran, from Athens to the pleasant groves of Susa and the sparkling
  Choaspes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But the adventure is ending,&rdquo; answered she, with smiling
  confidence; &ldquo;Mazda has guarded us. As you have said&mdash;we are in his
  hand, alike here and in my brother&rsquo;s palace. And we have seen Greece
  and Athens&mdash;the country and city which you will conquer, which you will
  rule.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, letting his eyes pass from her face to the
  vista of the Acropolis, which lay in fair view under the moonlight.
  &ldquo;How noble a city this! Xerxes has promised that I shall be satrap of
  Hellas, Athens shall be my capital, and you, O best beloved, you shall be
  mistress of Athens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall be mistress of Athens,&rdquo; echoed she, &ldquo;but you,
  husband and lord, would that men might give you a higher name than satrap,
  chief of the Great King&rsquo;s slaves!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Xerxes is king,&rdquo; he answered her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My brother wears the purple cap. He sits on the throne of Cyrus the
  Great and Darius the Dauntless. I would be a loyal Aryan, the king is indeed
  in Susa or Babylon. But for me the true king of Media and Persia&mdash;is
  here.&rdquo; And she lifted proud eyes to her husband.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are bold, Rose of Eran,&rdquo; he smiled, not angry at her
  implication; &ldquo;more cautious words than these have brought many in peril
  of the bow-string. But, by Mithra the Fiend-Smiter, why were you not made a
  man? Then truly would your mother Atossa have given Darius an heir right
  worthy the twenty kingdoms!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She gave a gentle laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Most High ordains the best. Have I not the noblest kingdom? Am
  I not your wife?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His laugh answered her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I am greater than Xerxes. I love my empire the
  best!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He leaned again from the lattice, &ldquo;O, fairest of cities, and we
  shall win it! See how the tawny rock turns to silver beneath the moonbeams!
  How clearly burn the stars over the plain and the mountain! And these Greeks,
  clever, wise, beautiful, when we have mastered them, have taught them our
  Aryan obedience and love of truth, what servants will they not become! For we
  are ordained to conquer. Mazda has given us empire without limit, from the
  Indus to the Great Ocean of the West,&mdash;all shall be ours; for we are
  Persians, the race to rule forever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will conquer,&rdquo; she said dreamily, as enchanted as was he
  by the beauties of the night.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From the day Cyrus your grandfather flung down Cambyses the Mede,
  the High God has been with us. Egypt, Assyria, Babylon&mdash;have all bowed
  under our yoke. The Lydian at golden Sardis, the Tartar on the arid steppes,
  the Hindoo by his sacred river, all send tribute to our king, and
  Hellas&mdash;&rdquo; he held out his arms confidently&mdash;&ldquo;shall be
  the brightest star in the Persian tiara. When Darius your father lay dying, I
  swore to him, &lsquo;Master, fear not; I will avenge you on Athens and on all
  the Greeks.&rsquo; And in one brief year, O <i>fravashi</i>, soul of the
  great departed, I may make good the vow. I will make these untamed Hellenes
  bow their proud necks to a king.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her own eyes brightened, looking on him, as he spoke in pride and
  power.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she could not keep back the question, &ldquo;as we
  have moved through this Hellas, and seen its people, living without princes,
  or with princes of little power, sometimes a strange thought comes. These
  perverse, unobedient folk, false as they are, and ununited, have yet a
  strength to do great things, a strength which even we Aryans lack.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It cannot be. Mazda ordained a king to rule, the rest to obey. And
  all the wits of Hellas have no strength until they learn that lesson well.
  But I will teach it them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For some day you will be their king?&rdquo; spoke the woman. He did
  not reprove, but stood beside her, gazing forth upon the night. In the
  moonlight the columns and sculptures of the great temple on the Acropolis
  stood out in minute tracery They could see all the caverns and jagged ledges
  on the massy Rock. The flat roofs of the sleeping city lay like a dark and
  peaceful ocean. The mountains spread around in shadow-wrapped hush. Far away
  the dark stretch of the sea sent back a silver shimmering in answer to the
  moon. A landscape only possible at Athens! The two sensitive Orientals&rsquo;
  souls were deeply touched. For long they were silent, then the husband
  spoke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Twenty days more; we are safe in Sardis, the adventure ended. The
  war only remains, and the glory, the conquest,&mdash;and thou. O
  Ahura-Mazda,&rdquo; he spoke upward to the stars, &ldquo;give to thy Persians
  this land. For when Thou hast given this, Thou wilt keep back nothing of all
  the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. -- DEMOCRATES RESOLVES</h2>

  <p class="first">Democrates surpassed himself when arraigning the knavish
  contractor. &ldquo;Nestor and Odysseus both speak to us,&rdquo; shouted Polus
  in glee, flinging his black bean in the urn. &ldquo;What eloquence, what
  righteous fury when he painted the man&rsquo;s infamy to pillage the city in
  a crisis like this!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So the criminal was sent to death and Democrates was showered with
  congratulations. Only one person seemed hardly satisfied with all the young
  orator did,&mdash;Themistocles. The latter told his lieutenant candidly he
  feared all was not being done to apprehend the Persian emissary. Themistocles
  even took it upon himself to send Sicinnus to run down several suspects, and
  just on the morning of the day preceding the Panathenæa&mdash;the great
  summer festival&mdash;Democrates received a hint which sent him home very
  thoughtful. He had met his chief in the Agora as he was leaving the
  Government-House, and Themistocles had again asked if he had smelt aught of
  the Persian agent. He had not.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you would well devote more time to finding his scent, and less
  to convicting a pitiful embezzler. You know the Alopece suburb?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the house of Phormio the fishmonger?&rdquo; to which Democrates
  nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Sicinnus has been watching the quarter. A Babylonish
  carpet-seller has rooms opposite Phormio. The man is suspicious, does no
  trading, and Phormio&rsquo;s wife told Sicinnus an odd tale.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What tale?&rdquo; Democrates glanced at a passing chariot, avoiding
  Themistocles&rsquo;s gaze.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, twice the Barbarian, she swears, has had an evening
  visitor&mdash;and he our dear Glaucon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course. The good woman is mistaken. Still, question her. Pry
  into this Babylonian&rsquo;s doings. He may be selling more things than
  carpets. If he has corrupted any here in Athens,&mdash;by Pluto the
  Implacable, I will make them tell out the price!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll inquire at once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do so. The matter grows serious.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles caught sight of one of the archons and hastened across the
  Agora to have a word with him. Democrates passed his hand across his
  forehead, beaded with sudden sweat-drops. He knew&mdash;though Themistocles
  had said not a word&mdash;that his superior was beginning to distrust his
  efforts, and that Sicinnus was working independently. Democrates had great
  respect for the acuteness of that Asiatic. He was coming perilously near the
  truth already. If the Cyprian and Hiram were arrested, the latter at least
  would surely try to save his life by betraying their nocturnal visitor. To
  get the spy safely out of Athens would be the first step,&mdash;but not all.
  Sicinnus once upon the scent would not readily drop it until he had
  discovered the emissary&rsquo;s confederate. And of the fate of that
  confederate Themistocles had just given a grim hint. There was one other
  solution possible. If Democrates could discover the confederate
  <i>himself</i>, Sicinnus would regard the matter as cleared up and drop all
  interest therein. All these possibilities raced through the orator&rsquo;s
  head, as does the past through one drowning. A sudden greeting startled
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fair morning, Democrates.&rdquo; It was Glaucon. He walked
  arm-in-arm with Cimon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fair morning, indeed. Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the Peiræus to inspect the new tackling of the <i>Nausicaä</i>.
  You will join us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately I argue a case before the King Archon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be as eloquent as in your last speech. Do you know, Cimon declares
  I am disloyal too, and that you will soon be prosecuting me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Avert it, gods! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, he is sending a letter to Argos,&rdquo; asserted Cimon.
  &ldquo;Now I say Argos has Medized, therefore no good Hellene should
  correspond with a traitorous Argive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be jury on my treachery,&rdquo; commanded Glaucon. &ldquo;Ageladas
  the master-sculptor sends me a bronze Perseus in honour of my victory. Shall
  I churlishly send him no thanks because he lives in Argos?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Not guilty&rsquo; votes the jury; the white beans prevail.
  So the letter goes to-day?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow afternoon. You know Seuthes of Corinth&mdash;the
  bow-legged fellow with a big belly. He goes home to-morrow afternoon after
  seeing the procession and the sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He goes by sea?&rdquo; asked Democrates, casually.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By land; no ship went to his liking. He will lie overnight at
  Eleusis.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The friends went their ways. Democrates hardly saw or heard anything until
  he was in his own chambers. Three things were graven on his mind: Sicinnus
  was watching, the Babylonian was suspected, Glaucon was implicated and was
  sending a letter to Argos.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Bias the Thracian was discovered that afternoon by his
  master lurking in a corner of the chamber. Democrates seized a heavy
  dog-whip, lashed the boy unmercifully, then cast him out, threatening that
  eavesdropping would be rewarded by &ldquo;cutting into shoe soles.&rdquo;
  Then the master resumed his feverish pacings and the nervous twisting of his
  fingers. Unfortunately, Bias felt certain the threat would never have been
  uttered unless the weightiest of matters had been on foot. As in all Greek
  dwellings, Democrates&rsquo;s rooms were divided not by doors but by hanging
  curtains, and Bias, letting curiosity master fear, ensconced himself again
  behind one of these and saw all his master&rsquo;s doings. What Democrates
  said and did, however, puzzled his good servant quite sufficiently.</p>

  <p>Democrates had opened the privy cupboard, taken out one of the caskets and
  scattered its contents upon the table, then selected a papyrus, and seemed
  copying the writing thereon with extreme care. Next one of the clay seals
  came into play. Democrates was testing it upon wax. Then the orator rose,
  dashed the wax upon the floor, put his sandal thereon, tore the papyrus on
  which he wrote to bits. Again he paced restlessly, his hands clutching his
  hair, his forehead frowns and blackness, while Bias thought he heard him
  muttering as he walked:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Zeus! O Apollo! O Athena! I cannot do this thing! Deliver me!
  Deliver!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then back to the table again, once more to pick up the mysterious clay,
  again to copy, to stamp on the wax, to fling down, mutilate, and destroy. The
  pantomime was gone through three times. Bias could make nothing of it. Since
  the day his parents&mdash;following the barbarous Thracian custom&mdash;had
  sold him into slavery and he had passed into Democrates&rsquo;s service, the
  lad had never seen his master acting thus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Clearly the <i>kyrios</i> is mad,&rdquo; was his own explanation,
  and growing frightened at following the strange movements of his lord, he
  crept from his retreat and tried to banish uncanny fears at a safe distance,
  by tying a thread to the leg of a gold-chafer(5) and watching its vain
  efforts at flight. Yet had he continued his eavesdropping he might have
  found&mdash;if not the key to all Democrates&rsquo;s doings&mdash;at least a
  partial explanation. For the fourth time the papyrus had been written, for
  the fourth time the orator had torn it up. Then his eyes went down to the
  lump of clay before him on the table.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[5 A kind of beetle common in Greece.]</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curses upon the miserable stuff!&rdquo; he swore almost loudly;
  &ldquo;it is this which has set the evil thoughts to racing. Destroy
  <i>that</i>, and the deed is beyond my power.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He held up the clay and eyed it as a miser might his gold.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a little lump! Not very hard. I can dash it on the floor and
  it dissolves in dust. And yet, and yet&mdash;all Elysium, all Tartarus, are
  pent up for me in just this bit of clay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He picked at it with his finger and broke a small piece from the edge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A little more, the stamp is ruined. I could not use it. Better if
  it were ruined. And yet,&mdash;and yet,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laid the clay upon the table and sat watching it wistfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Father Zeus!&rdquo; he broke out after silence, &ldquo;if I were
  not compelled by fear! Sicinnus is so sharp, Themistocles so unmerciful! It
  would be a terrible death to die,&mdash;and every man is justified in
  shunning death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at the inanimate lump as if he expected it to answer him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, I am all alone. No one to counsel me. In every other trouble
  when has it been as this? Glaucon? Cimon? Themistocles?&mdash;What would they
  advise?&rdquo;&mdash;he ended with a laugh more bitter than a sob. &ldquo;And
  I must save myself, but at such a price!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pressed his hands over his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curses on the hour I met Lycon! Curses on the Cyprian and his gold!
  It would have been better to have told Glaucon and let him save me now and
  hate me forever after. But I have sold myself to the Cyprian. The deed cannot
  be taken back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But as he said it, he arose, took the charmed bit of clay, replaced in the
  box, and locked the coffer. His hand trembled as he did it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot do this thing. I have been foolish, wicked,&mdash;but I
  must not be driven mad by fear. The Cyprian must quit Athens to-morrow. I can
  throw Sicinnus off the scent. I shall never be the worse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He walked with the box toward the cupboard, but stopped halfway.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a dreadful death to die;&rdquo;&mdash;his thoughts raced and
  were half uttered,&mdash;&ldquo;hemlock!&mdash;men grow cold limb by limb and
  keep all their faculties to the end. And the crows in the Barathrum, and the
  infamy upon my father&rsquo;s name! When was a son of the house of Codrus
  branded &lsquo;A Traitor to Athens&rsquo;? Is it wickedness to save
  one&rsquo;s own life?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Instead of going to the cupboard he approached the window. The sun beat
  hotly, but as he leaned forth into the street he shivered as on a
  winter&rsquo;s morn. In blank wretchedness he watched the throng beneath the
  window, pannier-laden asses, venders of hot sausage with their charcoal
  stoves and trays, youths going to and from the gymnasium, slaves returning
  from market. How long he stood thus, wretched, helpless, he did not know. At
  last he stirred himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot stand gaping like a fool forever. An omen, by every god an
  omen! Ah! what am I to do?&rdquo; He glanced toward the sky in vain hope of a
  lucky raven or eagle winging out of the east, but saw only blue and
  brightness. Then his eye went down the street, and at the glance the warm
  blood tingled from his forehead to his heels.</p>

  <p>She was passing,&mdash;Hermione, child of Hermippus. She walked before,
  two comely maids went after with her stool and parasol; but they were the
  peonies beside the rose. She had thrown her blue veil back. The sun played
  over the sheen of her hair. As she moved, her floating saffron dress of the
  rare muslin of Amorgos now revealed her delicate form, now clothed her in an
  enchanting cloud. She held her head high, as if proud of her own grace and of
  the beauty and fair name of her husband. She never looked upward, nor beheld
  how Democrates&rsquo;s eyes grew like bright coals as he gazed on her. He saw
  her clear high forehead, he heard&mdash;or thought he heard despite the jar
  of the street&mdash;the rustle of the muslin robe. Hermione passed, nor ever
  knew how, by taking this way from the house of a friend, she coloured the
  skein of life for three mortals&mdash;for herself, her husband, and
  Democrates.</p>

  <p>Democrates followed her with his eyes until she vanished around the
  fountain at the street corner; then sprang back from the window. The workings
  of his face were terrible. It was an instant when men grasp the godlike or
  sink to the demon, when they do deeds never to be recalled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The omen!&rdquo; he almost cried, &ldquo;the omen! Not Zeus but
  Hermes the Guileful sent it. He will be with me. She is Glaucon&rsquo;s wife.
  But if not his, whose then but mine? I will do the deed to the uttermost. The
  god is with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He flung the casket upon the table and spread its fateful contents again
  before him. His hand flew over the papyrus with marvellous speed and skill.
  He knew that all his faculties were at his full command and unwontedly
  acute.</p>

  <p>Bias was surprised at his sport by a sudden clapping of his master&rsquo;s
  hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is it, <i>kyrie</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go to Agis. He keeps the gaming-house in the Ceramicus. You know
  where. Tell him to come hither instantly. He shall not lack reward. Make your
  feet fly. Here is something to speed them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He flung at the boy a coin. Bias opened eyes and mouth in wonder. It was
  not silver, but a golden daric.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blink at it, sheep, but run. Bring Agis,&rdquo; ordered
  the master,&mdash;and Bias&rsquo;s legs never went faster than on that
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>Agis came. Democrates knew his man and had no difficulty in finding his
  price. They remained talking together till it was dark, yet in so guarded a
  tone that Bias, though he listened closely, was unable to make out anything.
  When Agis went away, he carried two letters. One of these he guarded as if
  holding the crown jewels of the Great King; the second he despatched by a
  discreet myrmidon to the rooms of the Cyprian in Alopece. Its contents were
  pertinent and ran thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Democrates to the stranger calling himself a prince of Cyprus,
  greeting:&mdash;Know that Themistocles is aware of your presence in Athens,
  and grows suspicious of your identity. Leave Athens to-morrow or all is lost.
  The confusion accompanying the festival will then make escape easy. The man
  to whom I entrust this letter will devise with Hiram the means for your
  flight by ship from the havens. May our paths never cross
  again!&mdash;<i>Chaire.</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After Agis was gone the old trembling came again to Democrates. He had
  Bias light all the lamps. The room seemed full of lurking
  goblins,&mdash;harpies, gorgons, the Hydra, the Minotaur, every other foul
  and noxious shape was waiting to spring forth. And, most maddening of all,
  the chorus of Æschylus, that Song of the Furies Democrates had heard recited
  at the Isthmus, rang in the miserable man&rsquo;s ears:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;With scourge and with ban<br>
  We prostrate the man,<br>
  Who with smooth-woven wile,<br>
  And a fair-facèd smile<br>
  Hath planted a snare for his friend.<br>
  Though fleet, we shall find him;<br>
  Though strong, we shall bind him,<br>
  Who planted a snare for his friend.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Democrates approached the bust of Hermes standing in one corner. The
  brazen face seemed to wear a smile of malignant gladness at the fulfilment of
  his will.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hermes,&rdquo; prayed the orator, &ldquo;Hermes Dolios, god of
  craft and lies, thieves&rsquo; god, helper of evil,&mdash;be with me now. To
  Zeus, to Athena the pure, I dare not pray. Prosper me in the deed to which I
  set my hand,&rdquo;&mdash;he hesitated, he dared not bribe the shrewd god
  with too mean a gift, &ldquo;and I vow to set in thy temple at Tanagra three
  tall tripods of pure gold. So be with me on the morrow, and I will not forget
  thy favour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The brazen face still smiled on; the room was very still. Yet Democrates
  took comfort. Hermes was a great god and would help him. When the song of the
  Furies grew too loud, Democrates silenced it by summoning back
  Hermione&rsquo;s face and asking one triumphant question:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is Glaucon&rsquo;s wife. But if not his, whose then but
  mine?&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. -- THE PANATHENÆA</h2>

  <p class="first">Flowers on every head, flowers festooned about each pillar,
  and flowers under foot when one crossed the Agora. Beneath the sheltering
  porticos lurked bright-faced girls who pelted each passer with violets,
  narcissus, and hyacinths. For this was the morn of the final crowning day of
  the Panathenæa, greatest, gladdest of Athenian festivals.</p>

  <p>Athletic contests had preceded it and stately Pyrrhic dances of men in
  full armour. There had been feasting and merry-making despite the darkening
  shadow of the Persian. Athens seemed awakened only to rejoice. To-day was the
  procession to the Acropolis, the bearing of the sacred robe to Athena, the
  public sacrifice for all the people. Not even the peril of Xerxes could
  hinder a gladsome holiday.</p>

  <p>The sun had just risen above Hymettus, the Agora shops were closed, but
  the plaza itself and the lesches&mdash;the numerous little club houses about
  it&mdash;overran with gossipers. On the stone bench before one of these
  buzzed the select coterie that of wont assembled in Clearchus&rsquo;s booth;
  only Polus the juror now and then nodded and snored. He had sat up all night
  hearing the priestesses chant their ceaseless litanies on the Acropolis.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Guilty&mdash;I vote guilty,&rdquo; the others heard him muttering,
  as his head sank lower.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wake up, friend,&rdquo; ordered Clearchus; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not
  condemning any poor scoundrel now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ai!</i> ah!&rdquo; Polus rubbed his eyes, &ldquo;I only thought
  I was dropping the black bean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Against whom?&rdquo; quoth Crito, the fat contractor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whom? Why that aristocrat Glaucon,
  surely,&mdash;to-night&mdash;&rdquo; Polus suddenly checked himself and began
  to roll his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a dreadful grievance against him,&rdquo; remarked
  Clearchus; &ldquo;the gods know why.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The wise patriot can see many things,&rdquo; observed Polus,
  complacently, &ldquo;only I repeat&mdash;wait till to-night&mdash;and
  then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; demanded all the others.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you shall see,&rdquo; announced the juror, with an oratorical
  flourish of his dirty himation, &ldquo;and not you only but all of
  Athens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Clearchus grinned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our dear Polus has a vast sense of his own importance. And who has
  been making you partner of the state secrets&mdash;Themistocles?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A man almost his peer, the noble patriot Democrates. Ask
  Phormio&rsquo;s wife, Lampaxo; ask&mdash;&rdquo; Once more he broke off to
  lay a finger on his lips. &ldquo;This will be a notable day for
  Athens!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our good friend surely thinks so!&rdquo; rejoined the potter,
  dryly; &ldquo;but since he won&rsquo;t trust us with his precious secret, I
  think it much more interesting to watch the people crossing the square. The
  procession must be gathering outside the Dipylon Gate. Yonder rides
  Themistocles now to take command.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The statesman cantered past on a shining white Thessalian. At his heels
  were prancing Cimon, Democrates, Glaucon, and many another youth of the noble
  houses of Athens. At sight of the son of Conon, Polus had wagged his head in
  a manner utterly perplexing to his associates, and they were again perplexed
  when they saw Democrates wheel back from the side of his chief and run up for
  a hurried word with a man in the crowd they recognized as Agis.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Agis is a strange fish to have dealings with a
  &lsquo;steward&rsquo; of the procession to-day,&rdquo; wondered Crito.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be enlightened to-morrow,&rdquo; said Polus,
  exasperatingly. Then as the band of horsemen cantered down the broad Dromos
  street, &ldquo;Ah, me,&mdash;I wish I could afford to serve in the cavalry.
  It&rsquo;s far safer than tugging a spear on foot. But there&rsquo;s one
  young man out yonder on whose horse I&rsquo;d not gladly be
  sitting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Phui</i>,&rdquo; complained Clearchus, &ldquo;you are anxious to
  eat Glaucon skin and bones! There goes his wife now, all in white flowers and
  ribbons, to take her place in the march with the other young matrons. Zeus!
  But she is as handsome as her husband.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She needn&rsquo;t &lsquo;draw up her eyebrows,&rsquo; &rdquo;(6)
  growled the juror, viciously; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re marks of disloyalty even
  in her. Can&rsquo;t you see she wears shoes of the Theban model, laced open
  so as to display her bare feet, though everybody knows Thebes is Medizing?
  She&rsquo;s no better than Glaucon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[6 &ldquo;Give herself airs.&rdquo;]</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; ordered Clearchus, rising, &ldquo;you have spoken
  folly enough. Those trumpets tell us we must hasten if we hope to join in the
  march ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Who can tell the great procession? Not the maker of
  books,&mdash;what words call down light on the glancing eyes, on the moving
  lines of colour? Not the artist,&mdash;his pencil may not limn ten thousand
  human beings, beautiful and glad, sweeping in bright array across the
  welcoming city. Nor can the sculptor&rsquo;s marble shape the marching forms,
  the rippling draperies, the warm and buoyant life. The life of Athens was the
  crown of Greece. The festival of the Panathenæa was the crown of Athens.</p>

  <p>Never had Helios looked down on fairer landscape or city. The doors of the
  patrician houses were opened; for a day unguarded, unconstrained, the
  daughters, wives, and mothers of the nobility of Athens walked forth in their
  queenly beauty. One could see that the sculptor&rsquo;s master works were but
  rigid counterparts of lovelier flesh and blood. One could see veterans,
  stalwart almost as on the day of the old-time battles, but crowned with the
  snow of years. One could see youths, and need no longer marvel the young
  Apollo was accounted fair. Flowers, fluttering mantles, purple, gold, the
  bravery of armour, rousing music&mdash;what was missing? All conjoined to
  make a perfect spectacle.</p>

  <p>The sun had chased the last vapours from the sky. The little ravines on
  distant Hymettus stood forth sharply as though near at hand. The sun grew
  hot, but men and women walked with bared heads, and few were the untanned
  cheeks and shoulders. Children of the South, and lovers of the Sun-King, the
  Athenians sought no shelter, their own bright humour rejoicing in the
  light.</p>

  <p>On the broad parade ground outside the Dipylon, the towering northwestern
  gate, the procession gathered. Themistocles the Handsome, never more gallant
  than now upon the white Thessalian, was ordering the array, the ten young
  men, &ldquo;stewards of the Panathenæa,&rdquo; assisting. He sent his last
  glance down the long files, his ivory wand signed to the musicians in the
  van.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Play! march!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fifty pipers blew, fifty citharas tinkled. The host swept into the
  city.</p>

  <p>Themistocles led. Under the massy double gate caracoled the charger. The
  robe of his rider blew out behind him like purple wings. There was the cry
  and clang of cymbals and drums. From the gray battlement yellow daisies
  rained down like gold. Cantering, halting, advancing, beckoning, the chief
  went forward, and behind swept the &ldquo;knights,&rdquo; the mounted
  chivalry of Athens,&mdash;three hundred of the noblest youths of Attica, on
  beasts sleek and spirited, and in burnished armour, but about every helm a
  wreath. Behind the &ldquo;knights&rdquo; rode the magistracy, men
  white-headed and grave, some riding, some in flower-decked cars. After these
  the victors in the games and contests of the preceding day. Next the elders
  of Athens&mdash;men of blameless life, beautiful in hale and honoured age.
  Next the <i>ephebi</i>,&mdash;the youths close to manhood, whose fair limbs
  glistened under their sweeping chitons. Behind them, their sisters, unveiled,
  the maidens of Athens, walking in rhythmic beauty, and with them their
  attendants, daughters of resident foreigners. Following upon these was the
  long line of bleating victims, black bulls with gilded horns and
  ribbon-decked rams without blemish. And next&mdash;but here the people leaned
  from parapet, house-roof, portico, and shouted louder than ever:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The car and the robe of Athena! Hail, <i>Io,
  pæan!</i>hail!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Up the street on a car shaped like a galley moved the peplus, the great
  robe of the sovran goddess. From afar one could see the wide folds spread on
  a shipyard and rippling in the breeze. But what a sail! One year long had the
  noblest women of Attica wrought on it, and all the love and art that might
  breathe through a needle did not fail. It was a sheen of glowing colour. The
  strife of Athena with the brutish giants, her contest with Arachne, the deeds
  of the heroes of Athens&mdash;Erechtheus, Theseus, Codrus: these were some of
  the pictures. The car moved noiselessly on wheels turned by concealed
  mechanism. Under the shadow of the sail walked the fairest of its makers,
  eight women, maids and young matrons, clothed in white mantles and wreaths,
  going with stately tread, unmoved by the shouting as though themselves
  divine. Seven walked together. But one, their leader, went
  before,&mdash;Hermione, child of Hermippus.</p>

  <p>Many an onlooker remembered this sight of her, the deep spiritual eyes,
  the symmetry of form and fold, the perfect carriage. Fair wishes flew out to
  her like doves.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May she be blessed forever! May King Helios forever bring her
  joy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Some cried thus. More thought thus. All seemed more glad for beholding
  her.</p>

  <p>Behind the peplus in less careful array went thousands of citizens of
  every age and station, all in festival dress, all crowned with flowers. They
  followed the car up the Dromos Street, across the cheering Agora, and around
  the southern side of the Acropolis, making a full circuit of the citadel.
  Those who watched saw Glaucon with Democrates and Cimon give their horses to
  slaves, and mount the bare knoll of Areopagus, looking down upon the western
  face of the Acropolis. As the procession swung about to mount the steep,
  Hermione lifted her glance to Areopagus, saw her husband gazing down on her,
  raised her hands in delighted gesture, and he answered her. It was done in
  the sight of thousands, and the thousands smiled with the twain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Justice! The beautiful salutes the beautiful.&rdquo; And who
  thought the less of Hermione for betraying the woman beneath the mien of the
  goddess?</p>

  <p>But now the march drew to an end. The procession halted, reformed,
  commenced the rugged way upward. Suddenly from the bastion of the Acropolis
  above wafted new music. Low, melancholy at first, as the pipers and harpers
  played in the dreamy Lydian mode, till, strengthening into the bolder Æolic,
  the strains floated down, inviting, &ldquo;Come up hither,&rdquo; then
  stronger still it pealed in the imperious crash of the Doric as the
  procession mounted steadily. Now could be seen great Lamprus, Orpheus&rsquo;s
  peer, the master musician, standing on the balcony above the gate, beating
  time for the loud choral.</p>

  <p>A chorus amongst the marchers and a second chorus in the citadel joined
  together, till the red crags shook,&mdash;singing the old hymn of the
  Homeridæ to Athena, homely, rude, yet dear with the memory of
  ages:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Pallas Athena, gray-eyed queen of wisdom,<br>
  Thy praise I sing!<br>
  Steadfast, all holy, sure ward of our city,<br>
  Triton-born rule whom High Zeus doth bring<br>
  Forth from his forehead.<br>
  Thou springest forth valiant;<br>
  The clangour swells far as thy direful arms ring.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;All the Immortals in awed hush are bending,<br>
  Beautiful, terrible, thy light thou&rsquo;rt sending<br>
  Flashed from thine eyes and thy pitiless spear.<br>
  Under thy presence Olympus is groaning,<br>
  Earth heaves in terrors, the blue deeps are moaning;<br>
  &lsquo;Wisdom, the All-Seeing Goddess is here!&rsquo;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Now the sea motionless freezes before thee;<br>
  Helios, th&rsquo; Sun-Lord, draws rein to adore thee;<br>
  Whilst thou, O Queen, puttest on divine might.<br>
  Zeus, the deep-councillor, gladly greets thee!<br>
  Hail, Holy Virgin&mdash;our loud pæan meets thee,<br>
  PALLAS, CHASTE WISDOM, DISPELLER OF NIGHT!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Up the face of the Rock, up the long, statue-lined way, till through the
  gate the vision burst,&mdash;the innumerable fanes and altars, the assembly
  of singers and priests, the great temple in its pride of glittering marble.
  Clearer, stronger sounded the choral, shot up through the limpid azure;
  swaying, burning, throbbing, sobs and shouting, tears and transports, so
  mounted new strains of the mighty chorus, lit through with the flames of
  Homeric verse. Then stronger yet was the mingling of voices, earth, sky,
  deep, beasts&rsquo; cry and gods&rsquo; cry, all voiced, as chorus answered
  to chorus. Now the peplus was wafted on a wave of song toward the
  temple&rsquo;s dawn-facing portal, when from beneath the columns, as the tall
  valves turned and the sun leaped into the cella, hidden voices returned the
  former strains&mdash;mournful at first. Out of the adytum echoed a cry of
  anguish, the lament of the Mother of Wisdom at her children&rsquo;s deathly
  ignorance, which plucks them down from the Mount of the Beautiful Vision. But
  as the thousands neared, as its pæans became a prayer, as yearning answered
  to yearning, lo! the hidden song swelled and soared,&mdash;for the goddess
  looked for her own, and her own were come to her. And thus in beneath the
  massy pediment, in through the wide-flung doors, floated the peplus, while
  under its guardian shadow walked Hermione.</p>

  <p>So they brought the robe to Athena.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Glaucon and his companions had watched the procession
  ascend, then followed to see the sacrifice upon the giant altar. The King
  Archon cut the throat of the first ox and made public prayer for the people.
  Wood soaked in perfumed oil blazed upon the huge stone platform of the
  sacrifice. Girls flung frankincense upon the roaring flames. The music
  crashed louder. All Athens seemed mounting the citadel. The chief priestess
  came from the holy house, and in a brief hush proclaimed that the goddess had
  received the robe with all favour. After her came the makers of the peplus,
  and Hermione rejoined her husband.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us not stay to the public feast,&rdquo; was her wish;
  &ldquo;let these hucksters and charcoal-burners who live on beans and
  porridge scramble for a bit of burned meat, but we return to
  Colonus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good then,&rdquo; answered Glaucon, &ldquo;and these friends of
  course go with us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cimon assented readily. Democrates hesitated, and while hesitating was
  seized by the cloak by none other than Agis, who gave a hasty whisper and
  vanished in the swirling multitude before Democrates could do more than
  nod.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an uncanny fox,&rdquo; remarked Cimon, mystified;
  &ldquo;I suppose you know his reputation?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The servant of Athens must sometimes himself employ strange
  servants,&rdquo; evaded the orator.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet you might suffer your friends to understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear son of Miltiades,&rdquo; Democrates&rsquo;s voice shook in the
  slightest, &ldquo;the meaning of my dealings with Agis I pray Athena you may
  never have cause to know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which means you will not tell us. Then by Zeus I swear the secret
  no doubt is not worth the knowing.&rdquo; Cimon stopped suddenly, as he saw a
  look of horror on Hermione&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Ah, lady! what&rsquo;s the
  matter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon,&rdquo; she groaned, &ldquo;frightful omen! I am
  terrified!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon&rsquo;s hands dropped at her cry. He himself paled slightly. In
  one of his moods of abstraction he had taken the small knife from his belt
  and begun to pare his nails,&mdash;to do which after a sacrifice was reputed
  an infallible means of provoking heaven&rsquo;s anger. The friends were grave
  and silent. The athlete gave a forced laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The goddess will be merciful to-day. To-morrow I will propitiate
  her with a goat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, now, not to-morrow,&rdquo; urged Hermione, with white lips,
  but her husband refused.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The goddess is surfeited with sacrifices this morning. She would
  forget mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he led the rest, elbowing the way through the increasing swarms of
  young and old, and down into the half-deserted city. Democrates left them in
  the Agora, professing great stress of duties.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Strange man,&rdquo; observed Cimon, as he walked away; &ldquo;what
  has he this past month upon his mind? That Persian spy, I warrant. But the
  morning wanes. It&rsquo;s a long way to Colonus. &lsquo;Let us drink, for the
  sun is in the zenith.&rsquo; So says Alcæus&mdash;and I love the poet, for he
  like myself is always thirsty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The three went on to the knoll of Colonus where Glaucon dwelt. Cimon was
  overrunning with puns and jests, but the others not very merry. The omen of
  Glaucon&rsquo;s thoughtlessness, or something else, made husband and wife
  silent, yet it was a day when man or maid should have felt their spirits
  rise. The sky had never been brighter, not in Athens. Never had the mountains
  and sea spread more gloriously. From the warm olive-groves sounded the
  blithesome note of the Attic grasshopper. The wind sweeping over the dark
  cypresses by the house set their dark leaves to talking. The afternoon passed
  in pleasure, friends going and coming; there was laughter, music, and good
  stories. Hermione at least recovered part of her brightness, but her husband,
  contrary to all custom, remained taciturn, even melancholy. At last as the
  gentle tints of evening began to cover hill and plain and the red-tiled roofs
  of the ample city, all the friends were gone, saving only Cimon, and
  he&mdash;reckless fellow&mdash;was well able to dispense with companionship,
  being, in the words of Theognis, &ldquo;not absolutely drunk, nor sober
  quite.&rdquo; Thus husband and wife found themselves alone together on the
  marble bench beneath the old cypress.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>makaire</i>! dearest and best,&rdquo; asked Hermione, her
  hands touching his face, &ldquo;is it the omen that makes you grow so sad?
  For the sun of your life is so seldom under clouds that when it is clouded at
  all, it seems as deep darkness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He answered by pressing back her hair, &ldquo;No, not the omen. I am not a
  slave to chance like that. Yet to-day,&mdash;the wise God knows
  wherefore,&mdash;there comes a sense of brooding fear. I have been too
  happy&mdash;too blessed with friendship, triumph, love. It cannot last.
  Clotho the Spinner will weary of making my thread of gold and twine in a
  darker stuff. Everything lovely must pass. What said Glaucus to Diomedes?
  &lsquo;Even as the race of leaves, so likewise are those of men; the leaves
  that now are, the wind scattereth, and the forest buddeth forth more again;
  thus also with the race of men, one putteth forth, another ceaseth.&rsquo; So
  even my joy must pass&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon,&mdash;take back the words. You frighten me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He felt her in his arms trembling, and cursed himself for what he had
  uttered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A blight upon my tongue! I have frightened you, and without cause.
  Surely the day is bright enough, surely Athena having been thus far good we
  can trust her goodness still. Who knows but that it be many a year before our
  sun comes to his setting!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He kissed her many times. She grew comforted, but they had not been
  together long when they were surprised by the approach of Themistocles and
  Hermippus. Hermione ran to her father.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Themistocles and I were summoned hither,&rdquo; explained
  Hermippus, &ldquo;by a message from Democrates bidding us come to Colonus at
  once, on an urgent matter touching the public weal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is not here. I cannot understand,&rdquo; marvelled Glaucon; but
  while he spoke, he was interrupted by the clatter of hoofs from a party of
  horsemen spurring furiously and heading from the pass of Daphni.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. -- A TRAITOR TO HELLAS</h2>

  <p class="first">Before the house six riders were reining,&mdash;five
  Scythian &ldquo;bowmen&rdquo; of the constabulary of Athens, tow-headed
  Barbarians, grinning but mute; the sixth was Democrates. He dismounted with a
  bound, and as he did so the friends saw that his face was red as with pent-up
  excitement. Themistocles advanced hastily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Your hands seem a-quiver. Whom has that
  constable tied up behind him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seuthes!&rdquo; cried Glaucon, bounding back, &ldquo;Seuthes, by
  every god, and pinioned like a felon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; groaned the prisoner, lashed to a horse, &ldquo;what
  have I done to be seized and tried like a bandit? Why should I be set upon by
  these gentlemen while I was enjoying a quiet pot of wine in the tavern at
  Daphni, and be haled away as if to crucifixion? <i>Mu! Mu!</i> make them
  untie me, dear Master Glaucon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Put down your prisoner,&rdquo; ordered Democrates, &ldquo;and all
  you constables stay without the house. I ask Themistocles, Hermippus, and
  Glaucon to come to an inner room. I must examine this man. The matter is
  serious.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Serious?&rdquo; echoed the bewildered athlete, &ldquo;I can vouch
  for Seuthes&mdash;an excellent Corinthian, come to Athens to sell some bales
  of wool&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Answer, Glaucon,&rdquo; Democrates&rsquo;s voice was stern.
  &ldquo;Has he no letters from you for Argos?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You admit it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the dog of Egypt, do you doubt my word?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; called Democrates, dramatically, &ldquo;mark you
  that Glaucon admits he has employed this Seuthes as his courier.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whither leads this mummery?&rdquo; cried the athlete, growing at
  last angry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If to nothing, I, Democrates, rejoice the most. Now I must bid you
  to follow me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Seizing the snivelling Seuthes, the orator led into the house and to a
  private chamber. The rest followed, in blank wonderment. Cimon had recovered
  enough to follow&mdash;none too steadily. But when Hermione approached,
  Democrates motioned her back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not come. A painful scene may be impending.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What my husband can hear, that can I,&rdquo; was her retort.
  &ldquo;Ah! but why do you look thus dreadfully on Glaucon?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have warned you, lady. Do not blame me if you hear the
  worst,&rdquo; rejoined Democrates, barring the door. A single swinging lamp
  shed a fitful light on the scene&mdash;the whimpering prisoner, the others
  all amazed, the orator&rsquo;s face, tense and white. Democrates&rsquo;s
  voice seemed metallic as he continued:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Seuthes, we must search you. Produce first the letter from
  Glaucon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The fat florid little Corinthian was dressed as a traveller, a gray
  chalmys to his hips, a brimmed brown hat, and high black boots. His hands
  were now untied. He tugged from his belt a bit of papyrus which Democrates
  handed to Themistocles, enjoining &ldquo;Open.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon flushed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you mad, Democrates, to violate my private correspondence
  thus?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The weal of Athens outweighs even the pleasure of Glaucon,&rdquo;
  returned the orator, harshly, &ldquo;and you, Themistocles, note that Glaucon
  does not deny that the seal here is his own.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not deny,&rdquo; cried the angry athlete. &ldquo;Open,
  Themistocles, and let this stupid comedy end.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And may it never change to tragedy!&rdquo; proclaimed Democrates.
  &ldquo;What do you read, Themistocles?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A courteous letter of thanks to Ageladas.&rdquo; The senior
  statesman was frowning. &ldquo;Glaucon is right. Either you are turned mad,
  or are victim of some prank,&mdash;is it yours, Cimon?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am as innocent as a babe. I&rsquo;d swear it by the Styx,&rdquo;
  responded that young man, scratching his muddled head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I fear we are not at the end of the examination,&rdquo; observed
  Democrates, with ominous slowness. &ldquo;Now, Seuthes, recollect your
  plight. Have you no other letter about you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None!&rdquo; groaned the unheroic Corinthian. &ldquo;Ah! pity, kind
  sirs; what have I done? Suffer me to go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is possible,&rdquo; remarked his prosecutor, &ldquo;you are an
  innocent victim, or at least do not realize the intent of what you bear. I
  must examine the lining of your chalmys. Nothing. Your girdle. Nothing. Your
  hat, remove it. Quite empty. Blessed be Athena if my fears prove groundless.
  But my first duty is to Athens and Hellas. Ah! Your high boots. Remove the
  right one.&rdquo; The orator felt within, and shook the boot violently.
  &ldquo;Nothing again. The left one, empty it seems. <i>Ei!</i> what is
  this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In a tense silence he shook from the boot a papyrus, rolled and sealed. It
  fell on the floor at the feet of Themistocles, who, watching all his
  lieutenant did, bent and seized it instantly; then it dropped from his hands
  as a live coal.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The seal! The seal! May Zeus smite me blind if I see
  aright!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hermippus, who had been following all the scene in silence, bent, lifted
  the fateful paper, and he too gave a cry of grief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is the seal of Glaucon. How came it here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon,&rdquo;&mdash;hard as Democrates&rsquo;s voice had been
  that night, it rang like cold iron now,&mdash;&ldquo;as the friend of your
  boyhood, and one who would still do for you all he may, I urge you as you
  love me to look upon this seal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am looking,&rdquo; but as he spoke paleness followed the angry
  flush on the athlete&rsquo;s forehead. He needed no omen to tell him
  something fearful was about to ensue.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The seal is yours?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The very same, two dancing mænads and over them a winged Eros. But
  how came this letter here? I did not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As you love life or death, as you preserve any regard for our
  friendship, I adjure you,&mdash;not to brave it longer, but to
  confess&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Confess what? My head is reeling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The treason in which you have dipped your hands, your dealings with
  the Persian spy, your secret interviews, and last of all this letter,&mdash;I
  fear a gross betrayal of all trust,&mdash;to some agent of Xerxes. I shudder
  when I think of what may be its contents.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And&mdash;this&mdash;from&mdash;you!
  Oh,&mdash;Democrates,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The accused man&rsquo;s hands snatched at the air. He sank upon a
  chest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He does not deny it,&rdquo; threw out the orator, but
  Glaucon&rsquo;s voice rang shrilly:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ever! Ever will I deny! Though the Twelve Gods all cried out
  &lsquo;guilty!&rsquo; The charge is monstrous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is time, Democrates,&rdquo; said Themistocles, who had preserved
  a grim silence, &ldquo;that you showed us clearly whither your path is
  leading. This is a fearful accusation you launch against your best-loved
  friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Themistocles is right,&rdquo; assented the orator, moving away from
  the luckless Seuthes as from a pawn no longer important in the game of life
  and death. &ldquo;The whole of the wretched story I fear I must tell on the
  Bema to all Athens. I must be brief, but believe me, I can make good all I
  say. Since my return from the Isthmia, I have been observed to be sad.
  Rightly&mdash;for knowing Glaucon as I did, I grew suspicious, and I loved
  him. You have thought me not diligent in hunting down the Persian spy. You
  were wrong. But how could I ruin my friend without full proof? I made use of
  Agis,&mdash;no genteel confederate, to be sure, but honest, patriotic,
  indefatigable. I soon had my eyes on the suspected Babylonish carpet-seller.
  I observed Glaucon&rsquo;s movements closely, they gave just ground for
  suspicion. The Babylonian, I came to feel, was none other than an agent of
  Xerxes himself. I discovered that Glaucon had been making this emissary
  nocturnal visits.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A lie!&rdquo; groaned the accused, in agony.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would to Athena I believed you,&rdquo; was the unflinching
  answer; &ldquo;I have direct evidence from eye-witnesses that you went to
  him. In a moment I can produce it. Yet still I hesitated. Who would blast a
  friend without damning proof? Then yesterday with your own lips you told me
  you sent a messenger to disloyal Argos. I suspected two messages, not one,
  were entrusted to Seuthes, and that you proclaimed the more innocent matter
  thus boldly simply to blind my eyes. Before Seuthes started forth this
  morning Agis informed me he had met him in a wine-shop&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; whimpered the unhappy prisoner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And this fellow as much as admitted he carried a second and secret
  message&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Liar!&rdquo; roared Seuthes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Men hint strange things in wine-shops,&rdquo; observed Democrates,
  sarcastically. &ldquo;Enough that a second papyrus with Glaucon&rsquo;s seal
  has been found hidden upon you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Open it then, and know the worst,&rdquo; interjected Themistocles,
  his face like a thunder-cloud; but Democrates forbade him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A moment. Let me complete my story. This afternoon I received
  warning that the Babylonish carpet-vender had taken sudden flight, presumably
  toward Thebes. I have sent mounted constables after him. I trust they can
  seize him at the pass of Phyle. In the meantime, I may assure you I have
  irrefutable evidence&mdash;needless to present here&mdash;that the man was a
  Persian agent, and to more purpose hear this affidavit, sworn to by very
  worthy patriots.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Polus, son of Phodrus of the Commune of Diomea, and Lampaxo his
  sister take oath by Zeus, Dike, and Athena, thus: We swear we saw and
  recognized Glaucon, son of Conon, twice visiting by night in the past month
  of Scirophorion a certain Babylonish carpet-seller, name unknown, who had
  lodgings above Demas&rsquo;s shield factory in Alopece.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Details lack,&rdquo; spoke Themistocles, keenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To be supplied in full measure at the trial,&rdquo; rejoined the
  orator. &ldquo;And now to the second letter itself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, the letter, whatever the foul Cyclops that wrought it!&rdquo;
  groaned Glaucon through his teeth.</p>

  <p>Themistocles took the document from Hermippus&rsquo;s trembling hands. His
  own trembled whilst he broke the seal.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The handwriting of Glaucon. There is no doubt,&rdquo; was his
  despairing comment. His frown darkened. Then he attempted to read.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon of Athens to Cleophas of Argos wishes health:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cleophas leads the Medizers of Argos, the greatest friend of Xerxes
  in Greece. O Zeus, what is this next&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our dear friend, whom I dare not name, to-day departs for Thebes,
  and in a month will be safe in Sardis. His visit to Athens has been most
  fruitful. Since you at present have better opportunity than we for forwarding
  packets to Susa, do not fail to despatch this at once. A happy chance led
  Themistocles to explain to me his secret memorandum for the arraying of the
  Greek fleet. You can apprize its worth, for the only others to whom it is
  entrusted are Democrates and later Leonidas&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles flung the papyrus down. His voice was broken. Tears stood in
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Glaucon, Glaucon,&mdash;whom I have trusted? Was ever trust so
  betrayed! May Apollo smite me blind, if so I could forget what I read here!
  It is all written&mdash;the secret ordering of the fleet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a terrible moment there was silence in the little room, a silence
  broken by a wild, shrill cry,&mdash;Hermione&rsquo;s, as she cast her arms
  about her husband.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A lie! A snare! A wicked plot! Some jealous god has devised this
  guile, seeing we were too happy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook with sobs, and Glaucon, roused to manhood by her grief, uprose
  and faced the stern face of Democrates, the blenching faces of the rest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am the victim of a conspiracy of all the fiends in
  Tartarus,&rdquo;&mdash;he strove hard to speak steadily; &ldquo;I did not
  write that second letter. It is a forgery.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But who, then,&rdquo; groaned Themistocles, hopelessly,
  &ldquo;<i>can</i> claim this handiwork? Democrates or I?&mdash;for no other
  has seen the memorandum,&mdash;that I swear. It has not yet gone to Leonidas.
  It has been guarded as the apple of my eye. We three alone knew thereof. And
  it is in this narrow room the betrayer of Hellas must stand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot explain.&rdquo; Glaucon staggered back to his seat. His
  wife&rsquo;s head sank upon his lap. The two sat in misery.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Confess, by the remnants of our friendship I implore,
  confess,&rdquo; ordered Democrates, &ldquo;and then Themistocles and I will
  strive to lighten if possible your inevitable doom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The accused man sat dumb, but Hermione struck back as some wild creature
  driven to bay. She lifted her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has Glaucon here no friend but me, his wife?&rdquo; She sent
  beseeching eyes about the room. &ldquo;Do you all cry &lsquo;guilty,
  guilty&rsquo;? Then is your friendship false, for when is friendship proved,
  save in the hour of need?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The appeal brought an answer from her father, who had been standing
  silent; and in infinite distress kindly, cautious, charitable Hermippus
  began:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear Glaucon, Hermione is wrong; we were never more your friends.
  We are willing to believe the best and not the worst. Therefore tell all
  frankly. You have been a victim of great temptation. The Isthmian victory has
  turned your head. The Persian was subtle, plausible. He promised I know not
  what. You did not realize all you were doing. You had confederates here in
  Athens who are more guilty. We can make allowances. Tell only the truth, and
  the purse and influence of Hermippus of Eleusis shall never be held back to
  save his son-in-law.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nor mine, nor mine,&rdquo; cried Themistocles, snatching at every
  straw; &ldquo;only confess, the temptation was great, others were more
  guilty, everything then may be done&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon drew himself together and looked up almost proudly. Slowly he was
  recovering strength and wit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have nothing to confess,&rdquo; he spoke, &ldquo;nothing. I know
  nothing of this Persian spy. Can I swear the god&rsquo;s own oath&mdash;by
  Earth, by Sky, by the Styx&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles shook his head wearily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How can we say you are innocent? You never visited the
  Babylonian?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never. Never!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Polus and Lampaxo swear otherwise. The letter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A forgery.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Impossible. Is the forger Democrates or I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some god has done this thing in malice, jealous of my great
  joy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I fear Hermes no longer strides so frequently about Athens. The
  hand and seal are yours,&mdash;and still you do not confess?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I must die,&rdquo; Glaucon was terribly pale, but his voice was
  steady, &ldquo;it is not as a perjurer!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles turned his back with a groan.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can do nothing for you. This is the saddest hour in my
  life.&rdquo; He was silent, but Democrates sprang to the athlete&rsquo;s
  side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have I not prayed each god to spare me this task?&rdquo; he spoke.
  &ldquo;Can I forget our friendship? Do not brave it to the end. Pity at least
  your friends, your wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He threw back his cloak, pointing to a sword.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ai</i>,&rdquo; cried the accused, shrinking. &ldquo;What would
  you have me do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Save the public disgrace, the hooting jury, the hemlock, the corpse
  flung into the Barathrum. Strike this into your breast and end the
  shame.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>No further. Glaucon smote him so that he reeled. The athlete&rsquo;s tone
  was terrible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Villain! You shall not tempt me.&rdquo; Then he turned to the rest,
  and stood in his white agony, yet beautiful as ever, holding out his
  arms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O friends, do you all believe the worst? Do you, Themistocles, turn
  silently against me?&rdquo; No answer. &ldquo;And you, Hermippus?&rdquo; No
  answer again. &ldquo;And you, Cimon, who praised me as the fairest friend in
  all the world?&rdquo; The son of Miltiades simply tore his hair. Then the
  athlete turned to Democrates.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you I deemed more than comrade, for we were boys at school
  together, were flogged with the same rod, and drank from the same cup, had
  like friends, foes, loves, hates; and have lived since as more than
  brothers,&mdash;do you too turn utterly away?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would it were otherwise,&rdquo; came the sullen answer. Again
  Democrates pointed to the sword, but Glaucon stood up proudly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I am neither traitor, nor perjurer, nor coward. If I must
  perish, it shall be as becomes an Alcmæonid. If you have resolved to undo me,
  I know your power over Athenian juries. I must die. But I shall die with
  unspotted heart, calling the curse of the innocent upon the god or man who
  plotted to destroy me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have enough of this direful comedy,&rdquo; declared Democrates,
  pale himself. &ldquo;Only one thing is left. Call in the Scythians with their
  gyves, and hale the traitor to prison.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He approached the door; the others stood as icy statues, but not Hermione.
  She had her back against the door before the orator could open.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold,&rdquo; she commanded, &ldquo;for you are doing
  murder!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates halted at the menacing light in her eyes. All the fear had gone
  out of them. Athena Promachos, &ldquo;Mistress of Battles,&rdquo; must have
  stood in that awful beauty when aroused. Did the goddess teach her in that
  dread moment of her power over the will of the orator? Glaucon was still
  standing motionless, helpless, his last appeal having ended in mute
  resignation to inevitable fate. She motioned to him desperately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon! Glaucon!&rdquo; she adjured, &ldquo;do not throw your life
  away. They shall not murder you. Up! Rouse yourself! There is yet time. Fly,
  or all is lost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fly!&rdquo; spoke the athlete, almost vacantly. &ldquo;No, I will
  brave them to the end.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For my sake, fly,&rdquo; she ordered, and conjured by that potent
  talisman, Glaucon moved toward her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How? Whither?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the ends of the earth, Scythia, Atlantis, India, and remain till
  all Athens knows you are innocent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As men move who know not what they do, he approached the door. Held by the
  magic of her eyes the others stood rigid. They saw Hermione raise the latch.
  Her husband&rsquo;s face met hers in one kiss. The door opened, closed.
  Glaucon was gone, and as the latch clicked Democrates shook off the charm and
  leaped forward.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After the traitor! Not too late!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For an instant he wrestled with Hermione hand to hand, but she was strong
  through fear and love. He could not master her. Then a heavy grasp fell on
  his shoulder&mdash;Cimon&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are beside yourself, Democrates. My memory is longer than
  yours. To me Glaucon is still a friend. I&rsquo;ll not see him dragged to
  death before my eyes. When we follow even a fox or a wolf, we give fair start
  and fair play. You shall not pursue him yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blessing on you!&rdquo; cried the wife, falling on her knees and
  seizing Cimon&rsquo;s cloak. &ldquo;Oh, make Themistocles and my father
  merciful!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hermippus&mdash;tender-hearted man&mdash;was in tears. Themistocles was
  pacing the little chamber, his hand tugging his beard, clearly in grievous
  doubt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Scythians! The constables!&rdquo; Democrates clamoured
  frantically; &ldquo;every instant gives the traitor better start.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Cimon held him fast, and Themistocles was not to be interrupted. Only
  after a long time he spoke, and then with authority which brooked no
  contradiction.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no hole in the net of Democrates&rsquo;s evidence that
  Glaucon is guilty of foul disloyalty, disloyalty worthy of shameful death.
  Were he any other there would be only one way with him and that a short one.
  But Glaucon I know, if I know any man. The charges even if proved are nigh
  incredible. For of all the thousands in Hellas his soul seemed the purest,
  noblest, most ingenuous. Therefore I will not hasten on his death. I will
  give the gods a chance to save him. Let Democrates arraign me for
  &lsquo;misprision of treason&rsquo; if he will, and of failing in duty to
  Athens. There shall be no pursuit of Glaucon until morning. Then let the
  Eleven(7) issue their hue and cry. If they take him, let the law deal with
  him. Till then give respite.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[7 The police magistrates of Athens.]</p>

  <p>Democrates attempted remonstrance. Themistocles bade him be silent
  sharply, and the other bowed his head in cowed acquiescence. Hermione
  staggered from the door, her father unbarred, and the whole wretched company
  went forth. In the passage hung a burnished steel mirror; Hermione gave a cry
  as she passed it. The light borne by Hermippus showed her in her festival
  dress, the rippling white drapery, the crown of white violets.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My father!&rdquo; she cried, falling into his arms, &ldquo;is it
  still the day of the Panathenæa, when I marched in the great procession, when
  all Athens called me happy? It was a thousand years ago! I can never be glad
  again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He lifted her tenderly as she fainted. Old Cleopis, the Spartan nurse who
  had kissed her almost before her mother, ran to her. They carried her to bed,
  and Athena in mercy hid her from consciousness that night and all the
  following day.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. -- THE DISLOYALTY OF PHORMIO</h2>

  <p class="first">On the evening of the Panathenæa, Bias, servant of
  Democrates, had supped with Phormio,&mdash;for in democratic Athens a humble
  citizen would not disdain to entertain even a slave. The Thracian had a merry
  wit and a story-teller&rsquo;s gift that more than paid for the supper of
  barley-porridge and salt mackerel, and after the viands had disappeared was
  ready even to tell tales against his master.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve turned my brain inside out, and shaken it like a meal
  sack. No wisdom comes. The <i>kyrios</i> has something on his mind. He prays
  to Hermes Dolios as often as if he were a cut-purse. Then yesterday he sent
  me for Agis&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Agis?&rdquo; Phormio pricked up his ears. &ldquo;The gambling-house
  keeper? What does Democrates with <i>him</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Answer yourself. My master has been to Agis&rsquo;s pretty place
  before to see his cocks. However, this is different. To-day I met
  Theon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Agis&rsquo;s slave, the merriest scoundrel in Athens. Agis, he
  says, has been prancing like an ass stuffed with barley. He gave Theon a
  letter from Democrates to take to your Babylonian opposite; Theon must hunt
  up Seuthes, a Corinthian, and worm out of him when and how he was leaving
  Athens. Agis promised Theon a gold stater if all was right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Phormio whistled. &ldquo;You mean the carpet-dealer here? By
  Athena&rsquo;s owls, there is no light in his window to-night!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None, indeed,&rdquo; crackled Lampaxo; &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t I see
  that cursed Babylonian with his servants gliding out just as Bias entered?
  Zeus knows whither! I hope ere dawn Democrates has them by the
  heels.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Democrates does something to-night,&rdquo; asserted Bias, extending
  his cup for wine. &ldquo;At noon Agis flew up to him, chattered something in
  his ear, whereupon Democrates bade me be off and not approach him till
  to-morrow, otherwise a cane gets broken on my shoulders.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not painful to have a holiday,&rdquo; laughed
  Phormio.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s most painful to be curious yet unsatisfied.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why did not you take the letter to the Babylonian?&rdquo;
  observed Phormio, shrewdly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perplexed, indeed. Only one thing is possible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And that is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Theon is not known in this street. I am. Perhaps the <i>kyrios</i>
  didn&rsquo;t care to have it rumoured he had dealings with that
  Babylonian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silence, undutiful scoundrel,&rdquo; ordered Lampaxo, from her
  corner; &ldquo;what has so noble a patriot as Democrates to conceal? Ugh! Be
  off with you! Phormio, don&rsquo;t dare to fill up the tipsy fox&rsquo;s
  beaker again. I want to pull on my nightcap and go to bed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bias did not take the hint. Phormio was considering whether it was best to
  join combat with his redoubtable spouse, or save his courage for a more
  important battle, when a slight noise from the street made all listen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pest light on those bands of young roisterers!&rdquo; fumed
  Lampaxo. &ldquo;They go around all night, beating on doors and vexing honest
  folk. Why don&rsquo;t the constables trot them all to jail?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a drunken band, good wife,&rdquo; remarked
  Phormio, rising; &ldquo;some one is sitting on the stones by the Hermes, near
  the door, groaning as if in pain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A drunkard? Let him lie then,&rdquo; commanded Lampaxo; &ldquo;let
  the coat-thieves come and filch his chiton.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hardly drunken,&rdquo; observed her husband, peering
  through the lattice in the door, &ldquo;but sick rather. Don&rsquo;t detain
  me, <i>philotata</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;Lampaxo&rsquo;s skinny hand had tried to
  restrain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not let even a dog suffer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be ruined by too much charity,&rdquo; bewailed the
  woman, but Bias followed the fishmonger into the night. The moon shone down
  the narrow street, falling over the stranger who half lay, half squatted by
  the Hermes. When the two approached him, he tried to stagger to his feet,
  then reeled, and Phormio&rsquo;s strong arms seized him. The man resisted
  feebly, and seemed never to hear the fishmonger&rsquo;s friendly
  questions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am innocent. Do not arrest me. Help me to the temple of
  Hephæstos, where there&rsquo;s asylum for fugitives. Ah! Hermione, that I
  should bring you this!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bias leaped back as the moonlight glanced over the face of the
  stranger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Master Glaucon, half naked and mad! <i>Ai!</i> woe!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon the Alcmæonid,&rdquo; echoed Phormio, in amazement, and the
  other still struggled to escape.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you not hear? I am innocent. I never visited the Persian spy. I
  never betrayed the fleet. By what god can I swear it, that you may
  believe?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Phormio was a man to recover from surprise quickly, and act swiftly and to
  the purpose. He made haste to lead his unfortunate visitor inside and lay him
  on his one hard couch. Scarcely was this done, however, when Lampaxo ran up
  to Glaucon in mingled rage and exultation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Phormio doesn&rsquo;t know what Polus and I told Democrates, or
  what he told us! So you thought to escape, you white-skinned traitor? But
  we&rsquo;ve watched you. We know how you went to the Babylonian. We know your
  guilt. And now the good gods have stricken you mad and delivered you to
  justice.&rdquo; She waved her bony fists in the prostrate man&rsquo;s face.
  &ldquo;Run, Phormio! don&rsquo;t stand gaping like a magpie. Run, I
  say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whither? For a physician?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Areopagus, fool! There&rsquo;s where the constables have their
  camp. Bring ten men with fetters. He&rsquo;s strong and desperate. Bias and I
  will wait and guard him. If you stir, traitor,&mdash;&rdquo; she was holding
  a heavy meat-knife at the fugitive&rsquo;s throat,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  slit your weasand like a chicken.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But for once in his life Phormio defied his tyrant effectively. With one
  hand he tore the weapon from her clutch, the other closed her screaming
  mouth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you mad yourself? Will you rouse the neighbourhood? I
  don&rsquo;t know what you and Polus tattled about to Democrates. I
  don&rsquo;t greatly care. As for going for constables to seize Glaucon the
  Fortunate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fortunate!&rdquo; echoed the miserable youth, rising on one elbow,
  &ldquo;say it never again. The gods have blasted me with one great blow. And
  you&mdash;you are Phormio, husband and brother-in-law of those who have sworn
  against me,&mdash;you are the slave of Democrates my destroyer,&mdash;and
  you, woman,&mdash;Zeus soften you!&mdash;already clamour for my worthless
  life, as all Athens does to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lampaxo suddenly subsided. Resistance from her spouse was so unexpected
  she lost at once arguments and breath. Phormio continued to act promptly;
  taking a treasured bottle from a cupboard he filled a mug and pressed it to
  the newcomer&rsquo;s lips. The fiery liquor sent the colour back into
  Glaucon&rsquo;s face. He raised himself higher&mdash;strength and mind in a
  measure returned. Bias had whispered to Phormio rapidly. Perhaps he had
  guessed more of his master&rsquo;s doings than he had dared to hint
  before.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hark you, Master Glaucon,&rdquo; began Phormio, not unkindly.
  &ldquo;You are with friends, and never heed my wife. She&rsquo;s not so
  steely hearted as she seems.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seize the traitor,&rdquo; interjected Lampaxo, with a gasp.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell your story. I&rsquo;m a plain and simple man, who won&rsquo;t
  believe a gentleman with your fair looks, fame, and fortune has pawned them
  all in a night. Bias has sense. First tell how you came to wander down this
  way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon sat upright, his hands pressing against his forehead.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How can I tell? I have run to and fro, seeing yet not seeing
  whither I went. I know I passed the Acharnican gate, and the watch stared at
  me. Doubtless I ran hither because here they said the Babylonian lived, and
  he has been ever in my head. I shudder to go over the scene at Colonus. I
  wish I were dead. Then I could forget it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Constables&mdash;fetters!&rdquo; howled Lampaxo, as a direful
  interlude, to be silenced by an angry gesture from her helpmeet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, try to tell what you can,&rdquo; spoke Phormio,
  mildly, and Glaucon, with what power he had, complied. Broken, faltering,
  scarce coherent often, his story came at last. He sat silent while Phormio
  clutched his own head. Then Glaucon darted around wild and hopeless eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ai!</i> you believe me guilty. I almost believe so myself. All
  my best friends have cast me off. Democrates, my friend from youth, has
  wrought my ruin. My wife I shall never see again. I am resolved&mdash;&rdquo;
  He rose. A desperate purpose made his feet steady.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; demanded Phormio, perplexed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One thing is left. I am sure to be arrested at dawn if not before.
  I will go to the &lsquo;City-House,&rsquo; the public prison, and give myself
  up. The ignominy will soon end. Then welcome the Styx, Hades, the never
  ending night&mdash;better than this shame!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He started forth, but Phormio&rsquo;s hand restrained him. &ldquo;Not so
  fast, lad! Thank Olympus, I&rsquo;m not Lampaxo. You&rsquo;re too young a
  turbot for Charon&rsquo;s fish-net. Let me think a moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The fishmonger stood scratching his thin hairs. Another howl from Lampaxo
  decided him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you a traitor, too? Away with the wretch to prison!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m resolved,&rdquo; cried Phormio, striking his thigh.
  &ldquo;Only an honest man could get such hatred from my wife. If
  they&rsquo;ve not tracked you yet, they&rsquo;re not likely to find you
  before morning. My cousin Brasidas is master of the <i>Solon</i>, and owes a
  good turn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Quick strides took him to a chest. He dragged forth a sleeveless
  sailor&rsquo;s cloak of hair-cloth. To fling this over Glaucon&rsquo;s rent
  chiton took an instant, another instant to clap on the fugitive&rsquo;s head
  a brimless red cap.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Euge!</i>&mdash;you grow transformed. But that white face of
  yours is dangerous. See!&rdquo; he rubbed over the Alcmæonid&rsquo;s face two
  handfuls of black ashes snatched from the hearth and sprang back with a great
  laugh, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a sailor unlading charcoal now. Zeus himself would
  believe it. All is ready&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For prison?&rdquo; asked Glaucon, clearly understanding little.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For the sea, my lad. For Athens is no place for you to-morrow, and
  Brasidas sails at dawn. Some more wine? It&rsquo;s a long, brisk
  walk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the havens? You trust me? You doubt the accusation which every
  friend save Hermione believes? O pure Athena&mdash;and this is
  possible!&rdquo; Again Glaucon&rsquo;s head whirled. It took more of the
  fiery wine to stay him up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, boy,&rdquo; comforted Phormio, very gruff, &ldquo;you shall
  walk again around Athens with a bold, brave face, though not to-morrow, I
  fear. Polus trusts his heart and not his head in voting &lsquo;guilty,&rsquo;
  so I trust it voting &lsquo;innocent.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I warn you,&rdquo; Glaucon spoke rapidly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no
  claim on your friendship. If your part in this is discovered, you know our
  juries.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That I know,&rdquo; laughed Phormio, grimly, &ldquo;for I know dear
  Polus. So now my own cloak and we are off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Lampaxo, who had watched everything with accumulating anger, now burst
  loose. She bounded to the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Constables! Help! Athens is betrayed!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She bawled that much through the lattice before her husband and Bias
  dragged her back. Fortunately the street was empty.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That I should see this! My own husband betraying the city! Aiding a
  traitor!&rdquo; Then she began whimpering through her nose. &ldquo;<i>Mu!
  mu!</i> leave the villain to his fate. Think of me if not of your own safety.
  Woe! when was a woman more misused?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But here her lament ended, for Phormio, with the firmness of a man
  thoroughly determined, thrust a rag into her mouth and with Bias&rsquo;s help
  bound her down upon the couch by means of a convenient fish-cord.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am grieved to stop your singing, blessed dear,&rdquo; spoke the
  fishmonger, indulging in a rare outburst of sarcasm against his formidable
  helpmeet, &ldquo;but we play a game with Fate to-night a little too even to
  allow unfair chances. Bias will watch you until I return, and then I can
  discover, <i>philotata</i>, whether your love for Athens is so great you must
  go to the Archon to denounce your husband.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Thracian promised to do his part. His affection for Democrates was
  clearly not the warmest. Lampaxo&rsquo;s farewell, as Phormio guided his
  half-dazed companion into the street, was a futile struggle and a choking.
  The ways were empty and silent. Glaucon allowed himself to be led by the hand
  and did not speak. He hardly knew how or whither Phormio was taking him.
  Their road lay along the southern side of the Acropolis, past the tall
  columns of the unfinished Temple of Zeus, which reared to giant height in the
  white moonlight. This, as well as the overshadowing Rock itself, they left
  behind without incident. Phormio chose devious alleys, and they met neither
  Scythian constables nor bands of roisterers. Only once the two passed a house
  bright with lamps. Jovial guests celebrated a late wedding feast. Clearly the
  two heard the marriage hymn of Sappho.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;The bridegroom comes tall as Ares,<br>
  Ho, Hymenæus!<br>
  Taller than a mighty man,<br>
  Ho, Hymenæus!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Glaucon stopped like one struck with an arrow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They sang that song the night I wedded Hermione. Oh, if I could
  drink the Lethe water and forget!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; commanded Phormio, pulling upon his arm. &ldquo;The
  sun will shine again to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus the twain went forward, Glaucon saying not a word. He hardly knew how
  they passed the Itonian Gate and crossed the long stretch of open country
  betwixt the city and its havens. No pursuit as yet&mdash;Glaucon was too
  perplexed to reason why. At last he knew they entered Phaleron. He heard the
  slapping waves, the creaking tackle, the shouting sailors. Torches gleamed
  ruddily. A merchantman was loading her cargo of pottery crates and oil
  jars,&mdash;to sail with the morning breeze. Swarthy shipmen ran up and down
  the planks betwixt quay and ship, balancing their heavy jars on their heads
  as women bear water-pots. From the tavern by the mooring came harping and the
  clatter of cups, while two women&mdash;the worse for wine&mdash;ran out to
  drag the newcomers in to their revel. Phormio slapped the slatterns aside
  with his staff. In the same fearful waking dream Glaucon saw Phormio
  demanding the shipmaster. He saw Brasidas&mdash;a short man with the face of
  a hound and arms to hug like a bear&mdash;in converse with the fishmonger,
  saw the master at first refusing, then gradually giving reluctant assent to
  some demand. Next Phormio was half leading, half carrying the fugitive aboard
  the ship, guiding him through a labyrinth of bales, jars, and cordage, and
  pointing to a hatchway ladder, illumined by a swinging lantern.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Keep below till the ship sails; don&rsquo;t wipe the charcoal from
  your face till clear of Attica. Officers will board the vessel before she
  puts off; yet have no alarm, they&rsquo;ll only come to see she doesn&rsquo;t
  violate the law against exporting grain.&rdquo; Phormio delivered his
  admonitions rapidly, at the same time fumbling in his belt.
  &ldquo;Here&mdash;here are ten drachmæ, all I&rsquo;ve about me, but
  something for bread and figs till you make new friends,&mdash;in which
  there&rsquo;ll be no trouble, I warrant. Have a brave heart. Remember that
  Helios can shine lustily even if you are not in Athens, and pray the gods to
  give a fair return.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon felt the money pressed within his palm. He saw Phormio turning
  away. He caught the fishmonger&rsquo;s hard hand and kissed it twice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can never reward you. Not though I live ten thousand years and
  have all the gold of Gyges.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Phui!</i>&rdquo; answered Phormio, with a shrug;
  &ldquo;don&rsquo;t detain me, it&rsquo;s time I was home and was unlashing my
  loving wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And with that he was gone. Glaucon descended the ladder. The cabin was
  low, dark, unfurnished save with rude pallets of straw, but Glaucon heeded
  none of these things. Deeper than the accusation by Democrates, than the
  belief therein by Themistocles and the others, the friendship of the
  fishmonger touched him. A man base-born, ignorant, uncivil, had believed him,
  had risked his own life to save him, had given him money out of his poverty,
  had spoken words of fair counsel and cheer. On the deck above the sailors
  were tumbling the cargo, and singing at their toil, but Glaucon never heard
  them. Flinging himself on a straw pallet, for the first time came the comfort
  of hot tears.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Very early the <i>Solon&rsquo;s</i> square mainsail caught
  the breeze from the warm southwest. The hill of Munychia and the ports
  receded. The panorama of Athens&mdash;plain, city, citadel, gray Hymettus,
  white Pentelicus&mdash;spread in a vista of surpassing beauty&mdash;so at
  least to the eyes of the outlaw when he clambered to the poop. As the ship
  ran down the low coast, land and sea seemed clothed with a robe of
  rainbow-woven light. Far, near,&mdash;islands, mountains, and deep were
  burning with saffron, violet, and rose, as the Sun-God&rsquo;s car climbed
  higher above the burning path it marked across the sea. Glaucon saw all in
  clear relief,&mdash;the Acropolis temple where he had prayed, the Pnyx and
  Areopagus, the green band of the olive groves, even the knoll of
  Colonus,&mdash;where he had left his all. Never had he loved Athens more than
  now. Never had she seemed fairer to his eyes than now. He was a Greek, and to
  a Greek death was only by one stage a greater ill than exile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Athena Polias,&rdquo; he cried, stretching his hands to the
  fading beauty, &ldquo;goddess who determineth all aright,&mdash;bless thou
  this land, though it wakes to call me traitor. Teach it to know I am
  innocent. Comfort Hermione, my wife. And restore me to Athens, after doing
  deeds which wipe out all my unearned shame!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The <i>Solon</i> rounded the cape. The headland concealed the city. The
  Saronian bay opened into the deeper blue of the Ægean and its sprinkling of
  brown islands. Glaucon looked eastward and strove to forget Attica.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Two hours later all Athens seemed reading this placard in
  the Agora:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="sign">NOTICE</p>

  <p class="sign">For the arrest of GLAUCON, SON OF CONON, charged with high
  treason, I will pay one talent.</p>

  <p class="sign">DEXILEUS, Chairman of the Eleven.</p>

  <p>Other such placards were posted in Peiræus, in Eleusis, in Marathon, in
  every Attic village. Men could talk of nothing else.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. -- MARDONIUS THE PERSIAN</h2>

  <p class="first">Off Andros the northern gale smote them. The ship had driven
  helplessly.</p>

  <p>Off Tenos only the skill of Brasidas kept the <i>Solon</i> clear of the
  rocky shores.</p>

  <p>As they raced past holy Delos the frightened passengers had vowed twelve
  oxen to Apollo if he saved them.</p>

  <p>Near Naxos, Brasidas, after vainly trying to make a friendly haven, bade
  his sailors undergird the ship with heavy cables, for the timbers seemed
  starting. Finally he suffered his craft to drive,&mdash;hoping at least to
  find some islet with a sandy shore where he could beach her with safety.</p>

  <p>The <i>Solon</i>, however, was near her doom. She was built on the Samian
  model, broad, flat, high in poop, low in prow,&mdash;excellent for cargo, but
  none too seaworthy. The foresail blew in tatters. The closely brailed
  mainsail shook the weakened mast. The sailors had dropped their quaint oaths,
  and began to pray&mdash;sure proof of danger. The dozen passengers seemed
  almost too panic-stricken to aid in flinging the cargo overboard. Several
  were raving.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hearken, Poseidon of Calauria,&rdquo; howled a Peiræus merchant
  against the screeching blasts, &ldquo;save from this peril and I vow thee and
  thy temple two mixing bowls of purest gold!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A great vow,&rdquo; suggested a calmer comrade. &ldquo;All your
  fortune can hardly pay it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; spoke the other, in undertone, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let
  the god overhear me; let me get safe to Mother Earth and Poseidon has not one
  obol. His power is only over the sea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A creaking from the mainmast told that it might fall at any moment.
  Passengers and crew redoubled their shouts to Poseidon and to Zeus of Ægina.
  A fat passenger staggered from his cabin, a huge money-bag bound to his
  belt,&mdash;as if gold were the safest spar to cling to in that boiling deep.
  Others, less frantic, gave commissions one to another, in case one perished
  and another escaped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You alone have no messages, pray no prayers, show no fear!&rdquo;
  spoke a grave, elderly man to Glaucon, as both clutched the swaying
  bulwark.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And wherefore?&rdquo; came the bitter answer; &ldquo;what is left
  me to fear? I desire no life hereafter. There can be no consciousness without
  sad memory.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are very young to speak thus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But not too young to have suffered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A wave dashed one of the steering rudders out of the grip of the sailor
  guiding it. The rush of water swept him overboard. The <i>Solon</i> lurched.
  The wind smote the straining mainsail, and the shivered mainmast tore from
  its stays and socket. Above the bawling of wind and water sounded the crash.
  The ship, with only a small sail upon the poop, blew about into the trough of
  the sea. A mountain of green water thundered over the prow, bearing away men
  and wreckage. The &ldquo;governor,&rdquo; Brasidas&rsquo;s mate, flung away
  the last steering tiller.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The <i>Solon</i> is dying, men,&rdquo; he trumpeted through his
  hands. &ldquo;To the boat! Save who can!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The pinnace set in the waist was cleared away by frantic hands and axes.
  Ominous rumblings from the hold told how the undergirding could not keep back
  the water. The pinnace was dragged to the ship&rsquo;s lee and launched in
  the comparative calm of the <i>Solon&rsquo;s</i> broadside. Pitifully small
  was the boat for five and twenty. The sailors, desperate and selfish, leaped
  in first, and watched with jealous eyes the struggles of the passengers to
  follow. The noisy merchant slipped in the leap, and they heard him scream
  once as the wave swallowed him. Brasidas stood in the bow of the pinnace,
  clutching a sword to cut the last rope. The boat filled to the gunwales. The
  spray dashed into her. The sailors bailed with their caps. Another passenger
  leaped across, whereat the men yelled and drew their dirks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Three are left. Room for one more. The rest must swim!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon stood on the poop. Was life still such a precious thing to some
  that they must clutch for it so desperately? He had even a painful amusement
  in watching the others. Of himself he thought little save to hope that under
  the boiling sea was rest and no return of memory. Then Brasidas called
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quick! The others are Barbarians and you a Hellene. Your
  chance&mdash;leap!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He did not stir. The &ldquo;others&rdquo;&mdash;two strangers in Oriental
  dress&mdash;were striving to enter the pinnace. The seamen thrust their dirks
  out to force them back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Full enough!&rdquo; bawled the &ldquo;governor.&rdquo; &ldquo;That
  fellow on the poop is mad. Cut the rope, or we are caught in the
  swirl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The elder Barbarian lifted his companion as if to fling him into the boat,
  but Brasidas&rsquo;s sword cut the one cable. The wave flung the
  <i>Solon</i>and the pinnace asunder. With stolid resignation the Orientals
  retreated to the poop. The people in the pinnace rowed desperately to keep
  her out of the deadly trough of the billows, but Glaucon stood erect on the
  drifting wreck and his voice rang through the tumult of the sea.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell them in Athens, and tell Hermione my wife, that Glaucon the
  Alcmæonid went down into the deep declaring his innocence and denouncing the
  vengeance of Athena on whosoever foully destroyed him!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brasidas waved his sword in last farewell. Glaucon turned back to the
  wreck. The <i>Solon</i> had settled lower. Every wave washed across the
  waist. Nothing seemed to meet his gaze save the leaden sky, the leaden green
  water, the foam of the bounding storm-crests. He told himself the gods were
  good. Drowning was more merciful death than hemlock. Pelagos, the untainted
  sea, was a softer grave than the Barathrum. The memory of the fearful hour at
  Colonus, the vision of the face of Hermione, of all things else that he would
  fain forget&mdash;all these would pass. For what came after he cared
  nothing.</p>

  <p>So for some moments he stood, clinging upon the poop, awaiting the end.
  But the end came slowly. The <i>Solon</i> was a stoutly timbered ship. Much
  of her lading had been cast overboard, but more remained and gave buoyancy to
  the wreckage. And as the Athenian awaited, almost impatiently, the final
  disaster, something called his eye away from the heaving sky-line. Human life
  was still about him. Wedged in a refuge, betwixt two capstans, the Orientals
  were sitting, awaiting doom like himself. But wonder of wonders,&mdash;he had
  not relaxed his hold on life too much to marvel,&mdash;the younger Barbarian
  was beyond all doubt a woman. She sat in her companion&rsquo;s lap, lifting
  her white face to his, and Glaucon knew she was of wondrous beauty. They were
  talking together in some Eastern speech. Their arms were closely twined. It
  was plain they were passing the last love messages before entering the great
  mystery together. Of Glaucon they took no heed. And he at first was almost
  angered that strangers should intrude upon this last hour of life. But as he
  looked, as he saw the beauty of the woman, the sheen of her golden hair, the
  interchange of love by touch and word,&mdash;there came across his own spirit
  a most unlooked-for change. Suddenly the white-capped billows seemed pitiless
  and chill. The warm joy of life returned. Again memory surged back, but
  without its former pang. He saw again the vision of Athens, of Colonus, of
  Eleusis-by-the-Sea. He saw Hermione running through the throng to meet him
  the day he returned from the Isthmia. He heard the sweet wind singing over
  the old olives beside the cool Cephissus. Must these all pass forever?
  forever? Were life, friends, love, the light of the sun, eternally lost, and
  nothing left save the endless sleep in the unsunned caves of Oceanus? With
  one surge the desire to live, to bear hard things, to conquer them, returned.
  He dashed the water from his eyes. What he did next was more by instinct than
  by reason. He staggered across the reeling deck, approached the Barbarians,
  and seized the man by the arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you live and not die? Up, then,&mdash;there is still a
  chance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man gazed up blankly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are in Mazda&rsquo;s hands,&rdquo; he answered in foreign
  accent. &ldquo;It is manifestly his will that we should pass now the Chinvat
  bridge. We are helpless. Where is the pinnace?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon dragged him roughly to his feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not know your gods. Do not speak of their will to destroy us
  till the destruction falls. Do you love this woman?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Save her, let me twice perish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rouse yourself, then. One hope is left!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What hope?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A raft. We can cast a spar overboard. It will float us. You look
  strong,&mdash;aid me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man rose and, thoroughly aroused, seconded the Athenian intelligently
  and promptly. The lurches of the merchantman told how close she was to her
  end. One of the seamen&rsquo;s axes lay on the poop. Glaucon seized it. The
  foremast was gone and the mainmast, but the small boat-mast still stood,
  though its sail had blown to a thousand flapping streamers. Glaucon laid his
  axe at the foot of the spar. Two fierce strokes weakened so that the next
  lurch sent it crashing overboard. It swung in the mælstrom by its stays and
  the halyards of the sail. Tossing to and fro like a bubble, it was a fearful
  hope, but a louder rumbling from the hold warned how other hope had fled. The
  Barbarian recoiled as he looked on it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It can never float through this storm,&rdquo; Glaucon heard him
  crying between the blasts, but the Athenian beckoned him onward.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Leap!&rdquo; commanded Glaucon; &ldquo;spring as the mast rises on
  the next wave.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot forsake her,&rdquo; called back the man, pointing to the
  woman, who lay with flying hair between the capstans, helpless and piteous
  now that her lover was no longer near.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will provide for her. Leap!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon lifted the woman in his arms. He took a manner of pride in showing
  the Barbarian his skill. The man looked at him once, saw he could be trusted,
  and took the leap. He landed in the water, but caught the sail-cloth drifting
  from the mast, climbed beside it, and sat astride. The Athenian sprang at the
  next favoring wave. His burden made the task hard, but his stadium training
  never stood in better stead. The cold water closed around him. The wave
  dragged down in its black abyss, but he struck boldly upward, was beside the
  friendly spar, and the Barbarian aided him to mount beside him, then cut the
  lashings to the <i>Solon</i> with the dagger that still dangled at his belt.
  The billows swept them away just as the wreck reared wildly, and bow foremost
  plunged into the deep. They bound the woman&mdash;she was hardly conscious
  now&mdash;into the little shelter formed by the junction of the broken
  sail-yard and the mast. The two men sat beside her, shielding her with their
  bodies from the beat of the spray. Speech was all but impossible. They were
  fain to close their eyes and pray to be delivered from the unceasing
  screaming of the wind, the howling of the waters. And so for hours....</p>

  <p>Glaucon never knew how long they thus drifted. The <i>Solon</i> had been
  smitten very early in the morning. She had foundered perhaps at noon. It may
  have been shortly before sunset&mdash;though Helios never pierced the clouds
  that storm-racked day&mdash;when Glaucon knew that the Barbarian was speaking
  to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; The wind had lulled a little; the man could make
  himself heard. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Through the masses of gray spray and driving mist Glaucon gazed when the
  next long wave tossed them. A glimpse,&mdash;but the joys of Olympus seemed
  given with that sight; wind-swept, wave-beaten, rock-bound, that half-seen
  ridge of brown was land,&mdash;and land meant life, the life he had longed to
  fling away in the morning, the life he longed to keep that night. He shouted
  the discovery to his companion, who bowed his head, manifestly in prayer.</p>

  <p>The wind bore them rapidly. Glaucon, who knew the isles of the Ægean as
  became a Hellene, was certain they drove on Astypalæa, an isle subject to
  Persia, though one of the outermost Cyclades. The woman was in no state to
  realize their crisis. Only a hand laid on her bosom told that her heart still
  fluttered. She could not endure the surge and the suffocating spray much
  longer. The two men sat in silence, but their eyes went out hungrily toward
  the stretch of brown as it lifted above the wave crests. The last moments of
  the desperate voyage crept by like the pangs of Tantalus. Slowly they saw
  unfolding the fog-clothed mountains, a forest, scattered bits of white they
  knew were stuccoed houses; but while their eyes brought joy, their ears
  brought sadness. The booming of the surf upon an outlying ledge grew ever
  clearer. Almost ere they knew it the drifting mast was stayed with a shock.
  They saw two rocks swathed in dripping weed that crusted with knife-like
  barnacles, thrust their black heads out of the boiling water. And
  beyond&mdash;fifty paces away&mdash;the breakers raced up the sandy shore
  where waited refuge.</p>

  <p>The spar wedged fast in the rocks. The waves beat over it pitilessly. He
  who stayed by it long had better have sunk with the <i>Solon</i>,&mdash;his
  would have been an easier death. Glaucon laid his mouth to the man&rsquo;s
  ear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swim through the surf. I will bear the woman safely.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Save her, and be you blessed forever. I die happy. I cannot
  swim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The moment was too terrible for Glaucon to feel amazed at this confession.
  To a Hellene swimming was second nature. He thought and spoke quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Climb on the higher rock. The wave does not cover it entirely. Dig
  your toes in the crevices. Cling to the seaweed. I will return for
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He never heard what the other cried back to him. He tore the woman clear
  of her lashings, threw his left arm about her, and fought his way through the
  surf. He could swim like a Delian, the best swimmers in Hellas; but the task
  was mighty even for the athlete. Twice the deadly undertow almost dragged him
  downward. Then the soft sand was oozing round his feet. He knew a knot of
  fisher folk were running to the beach, a dozen hands took his fainting burden
  from him. One instant he stood with the water rushing about his ankles,
  gasped and drew long breaths, then turned his face toward the sea.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you crazed?&rdquo; he heard voices clamouring&mdash;they seemed
  a great way off,&mdash;&ldquo;a miracle that you lived through the surf once!
  Leave the other to fate. Phorcys has doomed him already.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Glaucon was past acting by reason now. His head seemed a ball of fire.
  Only his hands and feet responded mechanically to the dim impulse of his
  bewildered brain. Once more the battling through the surf, this time against
  it and threefold harder. Only the man whose strength had borne the giant
  Spartan down could have breasted the billows that came leaping to destroy
  him. He felt his powers were strained to the last notch. A little more and he
  knew he might roll helpless, but even so he struggled onward. Once again the
  two black rocks were springing out of the swollen water. He saw the Barbarian
  clinging desperately to the higher. Why was he risking his life for a man who
  was not a Hellene, who might be even a servant of the dreaded Xerxes? A
  strange moment for such questionings, and no time to answer! He clung to the
  seaweed beside the Barbarian for an instant, then through the gale cried to
  the other to place his hands upon his shoulders. The Oriental complied
  intelligently. For a third time Glaucon struggled across the raging flood.
  The passage seemed endless, and every receding breaker dragging down to the
  graves of Oceanus. The Athenian knew his power was failing, and doled it out
  as a miser, counting his strokes, taking deep gulps of air between each wave.
  Then, even while consciousness and strength seemed passing together, again
  beneath his feet were the shifting sands, again the voices encouraging, the
  hands outstretched, strange forms running down into the surf, strange faces
  all around him. They were bearing him and the Barbarian high upon the beach.
  They laid him on the hard, wet sand&mdash;never a bed more welcome. He was
  naked. His feet and hands bled from the tearing of stones and barnacles. His
  head was in fever glow. Dimly he knew the Barbarian was approaching him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hellene, you have saved us. What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The other barely raised his head. &ldquo;In Athens, Glaucon the Alcmæonid,
  but now I am without name, without country.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Oriental answered by kneeling on the sands and touching his head upon
  them close to Glaucon&rsquo;s feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Henceforth, O Deliverer, you shall be neither nameless nor outcast.
  For you have saved me and her I love more than self. You have saved
  Artazostra, sister of Xerxes, and Mardonius, son of Gobryas, who is not the
  least of the Princes of Persia and Eran.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mardonius&mdash;arch foe of Hellas!&rdquo; Glaucon spoke the words
  in horror. Then reaction from all he had undergone robbed him of sense. They
  carried him to the fisher-village. That night he burned with fever and raved
  wildly. It was many days before he knew anything again.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Six days later a Byzantine corn-ship brought from Amorgos to
  Peiræus two survivors of the <i>Solon</i>,&mdash;the only ones to escape the
  swamping of the pinnace. Their story cleared up the mystery of the fate of
  &ldquo;Glaucon the Traitor.&rdquo; &ldquo;The gods,&rdquo; said every Agora
  wiseacre, &ldquo;had rewarded the villain with their own hands.&rdquo; The
  Babylonish carpet-seller and Hiram had vanished, despite all search, but
  everybody praised Democrates for saving the state from a fearful peril. As
  for Hermione, her father took her to Eleusis that she might be free from the
  hoots of the people. Themistocles went about his business very sorrowful.
  Cimon lost half his gayety. Democrates, too, appeared terribly worn.
  &ldquo;How he loved his friend!&rdquo; said every admirer. Beyond doubt for
  long Democrates was exceeding thoughtful. Perhaps a reason for this was that
  about a month after the going of Glaucon he learned from Sicinnus that Prince
  Mardonius was at length in Sardis,&mdash;and possibly Democrates knew on what
  vessel the carpet-seller had taken flight.</p>

  <h2><a id="bk2"
     name="bk2"></a>BOOK II. THE COMING OF THE PERSIAN</h2>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. -- THE LOTUS-EATING AT SARDIS</h2>

  <p>When Glaucon awoke to consciousness, it was with a sense of absolute
  weakness, at the same moment with a sense of absolute rest. He knew that he
  was lying on pillows &ldquo;softer than sleep,&rdquo; that the air he
  breathed was laden with perfume, that the golden light which came through his
  half-closed eyelids was deliciously tempered, that his ears caught a musical
  murmur, as of a plashing fountain. So he lay for long, too impotent, too
  contented to ask where he lay, or whence he had departed. Athens, Hermione,
  all the thousand and one things of his old life, flitted through his brain,
  but only as vague, far shapes. He was too weak even to long for them. Still
  the fountain plashed on, and mingling with the tinkling he thought he heard
  low flutes breathing. Perhaps it was only a phantasy of his flagging brain.
  Then his eyes opened wider. He lifted his hand. It was a task even to do that
  little thing,&mdash;he was so weak. He looked at the hand! Surely his own,
  yet how white it was, how thin; the bones were there, the blue veins, but all
  the strength gone out of them. Was this the hand that had flung great Lycon
  down? It would be mere sport for a child to master him now. He touched his
  face. It was covered with a thick beard, as of a long month&rsquo;s growth.
  The discovery startled him. He strove to rise on one elbow. Too weak! He sank
  back upon the cushions and let his eyes rove inquiringly. Never had he seen
  tapestries the like of those that canopied his bed. Scarlet and purple and
  embroidered in gold thread with elaborate hunting scenes,&mdash;the dogs, the
  chariots, the slaying of the deer, the bearing home of the game. He knew the
  choicest looms of Sidon must have wrought them. And the linen, so cool, so
  grateful, underneath his head&mdash;was it not the almost priceless fabric of
  Borsippa? He stirred a little, his eyes rested on the floor. It was covered
  with a rug worth an Athenian patrician&rsquo;s ransom,&mdash;a lustrous,
  variegated sheen, showing a new tint at each change of the light. So much he
  saw from the bed, and curiosity was wakened. Again he put forth his hand, and
  touched the hanging curtains. The movement set a score of little silver bells
  that dangled over the canopy to jingling. As at a signal the flutes grew
  louder, mingling with them was the clearer note of lyres. Now the strains
  swelled sweetly, now faded away into dreamy sighing, as if bidding the
  listener to sink again into the arms of sleep. Another vain effort to rise on
  his elbow. Again he was helpless. Giving way to the charm of the music, he
  closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Either I am awaking in Elysium, or the gods send to me pleasant
  dreams before I die.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was feebly wondering which was the alternative when a new sound roused
  him, the sweep and rustle of the dresses of two women as they approached the
  bed. He gazed forth listlessly, when lo! above his couch stood two
  strangers,&mdash;strangers, but either as fair as Aphrodite arising from the
  sea. Both were tall, and full of queenly grace, both were dressed in gauzy
  white, but the hair of the one was of such gold that Glaucon hardly saw the
  circlet which pressed over it. Her eyes were blue, the lustre of her face was
  like a white rose. The other&rsquo;s hair shone like the wing of a raven. A
  wreath of red poppies covered it, but over the softly tinted forehead there
  peered forth a golden snake with emerald eyes&mdash;the Egyptian uræus, the
  crown of a princess from the Nile. Her eyes were as black as the
  other&rsquo;s were blue, her lips as red as the dye of Tyre, her
  hands&mdash;But before Glaucon looked and wondered more, the first, she of
  the golden head, laid her hand upon his face,&mdash;a warm, comforting hand
  that seemed to speed back strength and gladness with the touch. Then she
  spoke. Her Greek was very broken, yet he understood her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you quite awakened, dear Glaucon?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked up marvelling, not knowing how to answer; but the golden goddess
  seemed to expect none from him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is now a month since we brought you from Astypalæa. You have
  wandered close to the Portals of the Dead. We feared you were beloved by
  Mazda too well, that you would never wake that we might bless you. Night and
  day have my husband and I prayed to Mithra the Merciful and Hauratât the
  Health-Giver in your behalf; each sunrise, at our command, the Magians have
  poured out for you the Haôma, the sacred juice dear to the Beautiful
  Immortals, and Amenhat, wisest of the physicians of Memphis, has stood by
  your bedside without rest. Now at last our prayers and his skill have
  conquered; you awake to life and gladness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon lay wondering, not knowing how to reply, and only understanding in
  half, when the dark-haired goddess spoke, in purer Greek than her
  companion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I, O Glaucon of Athens, would have you suffer me to kiss your
  feet. For you have given my brother and my sister back to life.&rdquo; Then
  drawing near she took his hand in hers, while the two smiling looked down on
  him.</p>

  <p>Then at last he found tongue to speak. &ldquo;O gracious Queens, for such
  you are, forgive my roving wits. You speak of great service done. But wise
  Zeus knoweth we are strangers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The golden goddess tossed her shining head and smiled,&mdash;still
  stroking with her hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear Glaucon, do you remember the Eastern lad you saved from the
  Spartans at the Isthmus? Behold him! Recall the bracelet of
  turquoise,&mdash;my first gratitude. Then again you saved me with my husband.
  For I am the woman you bore through the surf at the island. I am Artazostra,
  wife of Mardonius, and this is Roxana, his half-sister, whose mother was a
  princess in Egypt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon passed his fingers before his face, beckoning back the past.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is all far away and strange: the flight, the storm, the wreck,
  the tossing spar, the battling through the surges. My head is weak. I cannot
  picture it all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not try. Lie still. Grow strong and glad, and suffer us to teach
  you,&rdquo; commanded Artazostra.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where do I lie? We are not upon the rocky islet still?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The ladies laughed, not mockingly but so sweetly he wished that they would
  never cease.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is Sardis,&rdquo; spoke Roxana, bending over him; &ldquo;you
  lie in the palace of the satrap.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And Athens&mdash;&rdquo; he said, wandering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is far away,&rdquo; said Artazostra, &ldquo;with all its griefs and
  false friends and foul remembrances. The friends about you here will never
  fail. Therefore lie still and have peace.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know my story,&rdquo; cried he, now truly in amaze.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mardonius knows all that passes in Athens, in Sparta, in every city
  of Hellas. Do not try to tell more. We weary you already. See&mdash;Amenhat
  comes to bid us begone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The curtains parted again. A dark man in a pure white robe, his face and
  head smooth-shaven, approached the bed. He held out a broad gold cup, the rim
  whereof glinted with agate and sardonyx. He had no Greek, but Roxana took the
  cup from him and held it to Glaucon&rsquo;s lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Drink,&rdquo; she commanded, and he was fain to obey. The Athenian
  felt the heavily spiced liquor laying hold of him. His eyes closed, despite
  his wish to gaze longer on the two beautiful women. He felt their hands
  caressing his cheeks. The music grew ever softer. He thought he was sinking
  into a kind of euthanasy, that his life was drifting out amid delightful
  dreams. But not cold Thanatos, but health-bearing Hypnos was the god who
  visited him now. When next he woke, it was with a clearer vision, a sounder
  mind.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Sardis the Golden, once capital of the Lydian kings and now
  of the Persian satraps, had recovered from the devastation by the Ionians in
  their ill-starred revolt seventeen years preceding. The city spread in the
  fertile Sardiene, one of the garden plains of Asia Minor. To the south the
  cloud-crowned heights of Tmolus ever were visible. To the north flowed the
  noble stream of Hebrus, whilst high above the wealthy town, the busy agora,
  the giant temple of Lydian Cybele, rose the citadel of Meles, the palace
  fortress of the kings and the satraps. A frowning castle it was without,
  within not the golden-tiled palaces of Ecbatana and Susa boasted greater
  magnificence and luxury than this one-time dwelling of Cr&oelig;sus. The
  ceilings of the wide banqueting halls rose on pillars of emerald Egyptian
  malachite. The walls were cased with onyx. Winged bulls that might have
  graced Nineveh guarded the portals. The lions upbearing the throne in the
  hall of audience were of gold. The mirrors in the &ldquo;House of the
  Women&rdquo; were not steel but silver. The gorgeous carpets were sprinkled
  with rose water. An army of dark Syrian eunuchs and yellow-faced Tartar girls
  ran at the beck of the palace guests. Only the stealthy entrance of Sickness
  and Death told the dwellers here they were not yet gods.</p>

  <p>Artaphernes, satrap of Lydia, had his divan, his viziers, and his
  audiences,&mdash;a court worthy of a king,&mdash;but the real lord of Western
  Asia was the prince who was nominally his guest. Mardonius had his own
  retinue and wing of the palace. On him fell the enormous task of organizing
  the masses of troops already pouring into Sardis, and he discharged his duty
  unwearyingly. The completion of the bridges of boats across the Hellespont,
  the assembling of the fleet, the collecting of provisions, fell to his
  province. Daily a courier pricked into Sardis with despatches from the Great
  King to his trusted general. Mardonius left the great levees and public
  spectacles to Artaphernes, but his hand was everywhere. His decisions were
  prompt. He was in constant communication with the Medizing party in Hellas.
  He had no time for the long dicing and drinking bouts the Persians loved, but
  he never failed to find each day an hour to spend with Artazostra his wife,
  with Roxana his half-sister, and with Glaucon his preserver.</p>

  <p>Slowly through the winter health had returned to the Athenian. For days he
  had lain dreaming away the hours to the tune of the flutes and the fountains.
  When the warm spring came, the eunuchs carried him in a sedan-chair through
  the palace garden, whence he could look forth on the plain, the city, the
  snow-clad hills, and think he was on Zeus&rsquo;s Olympian throne, surveying
  all the earth. Then it was he learned the Persian speech, and easily, for
  were not his teachers Artazostra and Roxana? He found it no difficult tongue,
  simple and much akin to Greek, and unlike most of the uncouth tongues the
  Oriental traders chattered in Sardis. The two women were constantly with him.
  Few men were admitted to a Persian harem, but Mardonius never grudged the
  Greek the company of these twain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Noble Athenian,&rdquo; said the Prince, the first time he visited
  Glaucon&rsquo;s bed, &ldquo;you are my brother. My house is yours. My friends
  are yours. Command us all.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Every day Glaucon was stronger. He tested himself with dumb-
  bells. Always he could lift a heavier weight. When the summer was at hand, he
  could ride out with Mardonius to the &ldquo;Paradise,&rdquo; the
  satrap&rsquo;s hunting park, and be in at the death of the deer. Yet he was
  no more the &ldquo;Fortunate Youth&rdquo; of Athens. Only imperfectly he
  himself knew how complete was the severance from his old life. The terrible
  hour at Colonus had made a mark on his spirit which not all Zeus&rsquo;s
  power could take away. No doubt all the one-time friends believed him dead.
  Had Hermione&rsquo;s confidence in him remained true? Would she not say
  &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; at last with all the rest? Mardonius might have
  answered, he had constant letters from Greece, but the Prince was dumb when
  Glaucon strove to ask of things beyond the Ægean.</p>

  <p>Day by day the subtle influence of the Orient&mdash;the
  lotus-eating,&mdash;&ldquo;tasting the honey-sweet fruit which makes men
  choose to abide forever, forgetful of the homeward way&rdquo;&mdash;spread
  its unseen power over the Alcmæonid. Athens, the old pain, even the face of
  Hermione, would rise before him only dimly. He fought against this
  enchantment. But it was easier to renew his vow to return to Athens, after
  wiping out his shame, than to break these bands daily tightening.</p>

  <p>He heard little Greek, now that he was learning Persian. Even he himself
  was changed. His hair and beard grew long, after the Persian manner. He wore
  the loose Median cloak, the tall felt cap of a Persian noble. The elaborate
  genuflexions of the Asiatics no longer astonished him. He learned to admire
  the valiant, magnanimous lords of the Persians. And Xerxes, the distant king,
  the wielder of all this power, was he not truly a god on earth, vicegerent of
  Lord Zeus himself?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forget you are a Hellene. We will talk of the Nile, not of the
  Cephissus,&rdquo; Artazostra said, whenever he spoke of home. Then she would
  tell of Babylon and Persepolis, and Mardonius of forays beside the wide
  Caspian, and Roxana of her girlhood, while Gobryas was satrap of Egypt, spent
  beside the magic river, of the Pharaohs, the great pyramid, of Isis and
  Osiris and the world beyond the dead. Before the Athenian was opened the
  golden East, its glitter, its wonderment, its fascination. He even was silent
  when his hosts talked boldly of the coming war, how soon the Persian power
  would rule from the Pillars of Heracles to Ind.</p>

  <p>Yet once he stood at bay, showing that he was a Hellene still. They were
  in the garden. Mardonius had come to them where under the pomegranate tree
  the women spread their green tapestry which their nimble needles covered with
  a battle scene in scarlet. The Prince told of the capture and crucifixion of
  the chiefs of a futile revolt in Armenia. Then Artazostra clapped her hands
  to cry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fools! Fools whom Angra-Mainyu the Evil smites blind that he may
  destroy them!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon, sitting at her feet, looked up quickly. &ldquo;Valiant fools,
  lady; every man must strike for his own country.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Artazostra shook her shining head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mazda gives victory to the king of Eran alone. Resisting Xerxes is
  not rebellion against man, it is rebellion against Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; asked the Athenian, his eye lighting
  ominously. &ldquo;Are yours the greatest gods?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Roxana in turn cast down the tapestry and opened her arms with a
  charming gesture.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be not angry, Glaucon, for will you not become one with us? I dare
  to prophesy like a seer from old Chaldea. Assur of Nineveh, Marduk of
  Babylon, Baal of Tyre, Ammon of Memphis&mdash;all have bent the knee to Mazda
  the Glorious, to Mithra the Fiend-Smiting, and shall the weak <i>dævas</i>,
  the puny gods of Greece, save their land, when greater than they bow down in
  sore defeat?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Yet Glaucon still looked on her boldly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have your mighty gods, but we have ours. Pray to your Mazda and
  Mithra, but we will still trust Zeus of the Thunders and Athena of the Gray
  Eyes, the bulwarks of our fathers. And Fate must answer which can help the
  best.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Persians shook their heads. It was time to return to the palace. All
  that Glaucon had seen of the Barbarian&rsquo;s might, since awakening in
  Sardis, told him Xerxes was indeed destined to go forth conquering and to
  conquer. Then the vision of the Acropolis, the temples, the Guardian Goddess,
  returned. He banished all disloyal thoughts for the instant. The Prince
  walked with his wife, Glaucon with Roxana. He had always thought her
  beautiful; she had never seemed so beautiful as now. Did he imagine whither
  Mardonius perhaps was leading him?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>XVI. -- THE COMING OF XERXES THE GOD-KING</h2>

  <p class="first">At last the lotus-eating ended. Repeated messengers told how
  Xerxes was quitting Babylon, was holding a muster in Cappadocia, and now was
  crossing Asia Minor toward Sardis. Mardonius and his companions had returned
  to that capital. Daily the soldiery poured into Sardis by tens of thousands.
  Glaucon knew now it was not a vain boast that for ten years the East had been
  arming against Hellas, that the whole power of the twenty satrapies would be
  flung as one thunderbolt upon devoted Greece.</p>

  <p>In the plain about Sardis a second city was rising, of wicker booths and
  gay pavilions. The host grew hourly. Now a band of ebony archers in leopard
  skins entered from far Ethiopia, now Bactrian battle-axemen, now yellow-faced
  Tartars from the northeast, now bright-turbaned Arabs upon their swaying
  camels,&mdash;Syrians, Cilicians, black-bearded Assyrians and Babylonians,
  thick-lipped Egyptians, came, and many a strange race more.</p>

  <p>But the core of the army were the serried files of Aryan horse and
  foot,&mdash;blond-headed, blue-eyed men, Persians and Medes, veterans of
  twenty victories. Their muscles were tempered steel. Their unwearying feet
  had tramped many a long parasang. Some were light infantry with wicker
  shields and powerful bows, but as many more horsemen in gold-scaled armour
  and with desert steeds that flew like Pegasus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The finest cavalry in the world!&rdquo; Mardonius vaunted, and his
  guest durst not answer nay.</p>

  <p>Satrap after satrap came. When at last a foaming Arab galloping to the
  castle proclaimed, &ldquo;Next morn the Lord of the World will enter
  Sardis,&rdquo; Glaucon could scarce have looked for a greater, though he had
  expected Cronian Zeus himself.</p>

  <p>Mardonius, as &ldquo;bow-bearer to the king,&rdquo; a semi-regal office,
  rode forth a stage to meet the sovran. The streets of Sardis were festooned
  with flowers. Thousands of spearmen held back the crowds. The Athenian stood
  beside Roxana and Artazostra at the upper window of a Lydian merchant prince,
  and his eyes missed nothing.</p>

  <p>Never had the two women seemed lovelier than when their hearts ran out to
  their approaching king. He felt now the power of personal sovranty, how these
  children of the East awaited not Xerxes the Master, but Xerxes the
  Omnipotent, God-Manifest, whose decrees were as the decrees of Heaven. And
  their awe could not fail to awe the Athenian.</p>

  <p>At noon the multitude caught the first token of the king. Down the road,
  through the gate, walked a man, bare-headed, bare-footed,
  alone,&mdash;Artaphernes, despot of all Lydia, going to pay his abject
  homage. Presently the eunuch priests of Cybele, perched above the gate,
  clashed their cymbals and raised their hymn of welcome. To the boom of drums
  the thousand chosen cavalry and as many picked footmen of the Life Guard
  entered, tall, magnificent soldiers,&mdash;caps and spear butts shining with
  gold. After these a gilded car drawn by the eight sacred horses, each
  milk-white, and on the car an altar bearing the eternal fire of Mazda. Then,
  each in his flashing chariot, moved the &ldquo;Six Princes,&rdquo; the heads
  of the great clans of the Achæmenians, then two hundred led desert horses, in
  splendid trappings, and then&mdash;after a long interval, that the host might
  cast no dust upon its lord, rode a single horseman on a jet-black steed,
  Artabanus&mdash;the king&rsquo;s uncle and vizier. He beckoned to the
  people.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have fear, Lydians, the giver of breath to all the world comes now
  beneath your gates!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The lines of soldiers flung down their spears and dropped upon their
  knees. The multitude imitated. A chariot came running behind four of the
  sacred steeds of Nisæa,&mdash;their coats were like new snow, their manes
  braided with gold thread, bridle, bits, pole, baseboard, shone with gems and
  the royal metal. The wheel was like the sun. A girl-like youth guided the
  crimson reins, a second held the tall green parasol. Its shadow did not hide
  the commanding figure upon the car. Glaucon looked hard. No
  mistaking&mdash;Xerxes was here, the being who could say to millions
  &ldquo;Die!&rdquo; and they perished like worms; in verity
  &ldquo;God-Manifest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For in looks Xerxes, son of Darius, was surely the Great King. A figure of
  august height was set off nobly by the flowing purple caftan and the purple
  cap which crowned the curling black hair. The riches of satrapies were in the
  rubies and topazes on sword sheath and baldric. The head was raised. The face
  was not regular, but of a proud, aquiline beauty. The skin was olive, the
  eyes dark, a little pensive. If there were weak lines about the mouth, the
  curling beard covered them. The king looked straight on, unmoved by the
  kneeling thousands, but as he came abreast of the balcony, chance made him
  look upward. Perhaps the sight of the beautiful Greek caused Xerxes to smile
  winsomely. The smile of a god can intoxicate. Caught away from himself,
  Glaucon the Alcmæonid joined in the great salvo of cheering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Victory to Xerxes! Let the king of kings reign forever!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The chariot was gone almost instantly, a vast retinue&mdash;cooks,
  eunuchs, grooms, hunters, and many closed litters bearing the royal
  concubines&mdash;followed, but all these passed before Glaucon shook off the
  spell the sight of royalty cast on him.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">That night in the palace Xerxes gave a feast in honour of
  the new campaign. The splendours of a royal banquet in the East need no
  retelling. Silver lamps, carpets of Kerman rugs or of the petals of fresh
  roses, a thousand lutes and dulcimers, precious Helbon wine flowing like
  water, cups of Ph&oelig;nician crystal, tables groaning with wild boars
  roasted whole, dancing women none too modest,&mdash;these were but the
  incidentals of a gorgeous confusion. To Glaucon, with the chaste loveliness
  of the Panathenæa before his mind, the scene was one of vast wonderment but
  scarcely of pleasure. The Persian did nothing by halves. In battle a hero, at
  his cups he became a satyr. Many of the scenes before the guests emptied the
  last of the tall silver tankards were indescribable.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">On the high dais above the roaring hall sat Xerxes the
  king,&mdash;adored, envied, pitiable.</p>

  <p>When Spitames, the seneschal, brought him the cup, the bearer bowed his
  face, not daring to look on his dread lord&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

  <p>When Artabanus, the vizier, approached with a message, he first kissed the
  carpet below the dais.</p>

  <p>When Hydarnes, commander of the Life Guard, drew near to receive the
  watchword for the night, he held his mantle before his mouth, lest his breath
  pollute the world monarch.</p>

  <p>Yet of all forms of seeming prosperity wherewith Fate can curse a man, the
  worst was the curse of Xerxes. To be called &ldquo;god&rdquo; when one is
  finite and mortal; to have no friends, but only a hundred million slaves; to
  be denied the joys of honest wish and desire because there were none left
  unsatisfied; to have one&rsquo;s hastiest word proclaimed as an edict of
  deity; never to be suffered to confess a mistake, cost what the blunder
  might, that the &ldquo;king of kings&rdquo; might seem lifted above all human
  error; in short, to be the bondsman of one&rsquo;s own
  deification,&mdash;this was the hard captivity of the lord of the twenty
  satrapies.</p>

  <p>For Xerxes the king was a man,&mdash;of average instincts, capacities,
  goodness, wickedness. A god or a genius could have risen above his fearful
  isolation. Xerxes was neither. The iron ceremonial of the Persian court left
  him of genuine pleasures almost none. Something novel, a rare sensation, an
  opportunity to vary the dreary monotony of splendour by an astounding act of
  generosity or an act of frightful cruelty,&mdash;it mattered little
  which,&mdash;was snatched at by the king with childlike eagerness. And this
  night Xerxes was in an unwontedly gracious mood. At his elbow, as he sat on
  the throne cased with lapis lazuli and onyx, waited the one man who came
  nearest to being a friend and not a slave,&mdash;Mardonius, son of Gobryas,
  the bow-bearer,&mdash;and therefore more entitled than any other prince of
  the Persians to stand on terms of intimacy with his lord.</p>

  <p>While Spitames passed the wine, the king hearkened with condescending and
  approving nod to the report of the Prince as to his mad adventure in Hellas.
  Xerxes even reproved his brother-in-law mildly for hazarding his own life and
  that of his wife among those stiff-necked tribesmen who were so soon to taste
  the Aryan might.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was in your service, Omnipotence,&rdquo; the Prince was
  rejoining blandly; &ldquo;what if not I alone, but a thousand others of the
  noblest of the Persians and the Medes may perish, if only the glory of their
  king is advanced?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nobly said; you are a faithful slave, Mardonius. I will remember
  you when I have burned Athens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He even reached forth and stroked the bow-bearer&rsquo;s hand, a
  condescension which made the footstool-bearer, parasol-bearer, quiver-bearer,
  and a dozen great lords more gnaw their lips with envy. Hydarnes, the
  commander who had waited an auspicious moment, now thought it safe to kneel
  on the lowest step of the throne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Omnipotence, I am constrained to tell you that certain miserable
  Hellenes have been seized in the camp to-night&mdash;spies sent to pry out
  your power. Do you deign to have them impaled, crucified, or cast into the
  adders&rsquo; cage?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The king smiled magnanimously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They shall not die. Show them the host, and all my power. Then send
  them home to their fellow-rebels to tell the madness of dreaming to withstand
  my might.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The smile of Xerxes had spread, like the ripple from a pebble splashing in
  a pool, over the face of every nobleman in hearing. Now their praises came as
  a chant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Ocean of Clemency and Wisdom! Happy Eran in thy sagacious yet
  merciful king!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Xerxes, not heeding, turned to Mardonius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! yes,&mdash;you were telling how you corrupted one of the chief
  Athenians, then had to flee. On the voyage you were shipwrecked?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So I wrote to Babylon, to your Eternity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And a certain Athenian fugitive saved your lives? And you brought
  him to Sardis?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did so, Omnipotence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course he is at the banquet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The king speaks by the promptings of Mazda. I placed him with
  certain friends and bade them see he did not lack good cheer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Send,&mdash;I would talk with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suffer me to warn your Majesty,&rdquo; ventured Mardonius,
  &ldquo;he is an Athenian and glories in being of a stubborn, Persian-hating
  stock. I fear he will not perform due obeisance to the Great King.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can endure his rudeness,&rdquo; spoke Xerxes, for once in
  excellent humour; &ldquo;let the &lsquo;supreme usher&rsquo; bring him with
  full speed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The functionary thus commanded bowed himself to the ground and hastened on
  his errand.</p>

  <p>But well that Mardonius had deprecated the wrath of the monarch. Glaucon
  came with his head high, his manner almost arrogant. The mere fact that his
  boldness might cost him his life made him less bending than ever. He trod
  firmly upon the particular square of golden carpet at the foot of the dais
  which none, saving the king, the vizier, and the &ldquo;Six Princes,&rdquo;
  could lawfully tread. He held his hands at his sides, firmly refusing to
  conceal them in his cloak, as court etiquette demanded. As he stood on the
  steps of the throne, he gave the glittering monarch the same familiar bow he
  might have awarded a friend he met in the Agora. Mardonius was troubled. The
  supreme usher was horrified. The master-of-punishments, ever near his chief,
  gazed eagerly to see if Xerxes would not touch the audacious Hellene&rsquo;s
  girdle&mdash;a sign for prompt decapitation. Only the good nature of the king
  prevented a catastrophe, and Xerxes was moved by two motives, pleasure at
  meeting a fellow-mortal who could look him in the eye without servility or
  fear, delight at the beautiful features and figure of the Athenian. For an
  instant monarch and fugitive looked face to face, then Xerxes stretched out,
  not his hand, but the gold tip of his ivory baton. Glaucon had wisdom enough
  to touch it,&mdash;a token that he was admitted to audience with the
  king.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are from Athens, beautiful Hellene,&rdquo; spoke Xerxes, still
  admiring the stranger. &ldquo;I will question you. Let Mardonius
  interpret.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have learned Persian, great sir,&rdquo; interposed Glaucon, never
  waiting for the bow-bearer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have done well,&rdquo; rejoined the smiling monarch; &ldquo;yet
  better had you learned our Aryan manners of courtliness. No matter&mdash;you
  will learn them likewise in good time. Now tell me your name and
  parentage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am Glaucon, son of Conon, of the house of the
  Alcmæonidæ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Great nobles, Omnipotence,&rdquo; interposed Mardonius, &ldquo;so
  far as nobility can be reckoned among the Greeks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have yet to learn their genealogies,&rdquo; remarked Xerxes,
  dryly; then he turned back to Glaucon. &ldquo;And do your parents yet live,
  and have you any brethren?&rdquo; The question was a natural one for an
  Oriental. Glaucon&rsquo;s answer came with increased pride.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am a child of my parent&rsquo;s old age. My mother is dead. My
  father is feeble. I have no brethren. Two older brothers I had. One fell here
  at Sardis, when we Athenians sacked the city. One fell victorious at
  Marathon, while he burned a Persian ship. Therefore I am not ashamed of their
  fates.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your tongue is bold, Hellene,&rdquo; said the good-natured king;
  &ldquo;you are but a lame courtier. No matter. Tell me, nevertheless, why you
  churlishly refuse to do me reverence. Do you set yourself above all these
  princes of the Persians who bow before me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so, great sir. But I was born at Athens, not at Susa. We
  Hellenes pray standing even to Zeus, stretching forth our hands and looking
  upward. Can I honour the lord of all the satrapies above the highest
  god?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A nimble tongue you have, Athenian, though an unbending
  neck.&rdquo; Xerxes sat and stroked his beard, pleased at the frank reply.
  &ldquo;Mardonius has told how you saved his and my sister&rsquo;s lives, and
  that you are an outlaw from Athens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The last is all too true, great sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which means you will not pray your gods too hard for my defeat?
  ha?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon blushed, then looked up boldly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A Persian king, I know, loves truth-telling. I still love and pray
  for Athens, even if unknown enemies conspired against me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! You can learn our other virtues later. Are you blind to my
  power? If so, I pity more than I blame you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The king is kind,&rdquo; returned Glaucon, putting by a part of his
  hauteur. &ldquo;I would not anger him. I only know he would rather have men
  say, &lsquo;Xerxes conquered a proud nation, hard to subdue,&rsquo; than,
  &lsquo;He conquered a feeble race of whining slaves.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excellent! In all save your vain confidence of victory, you seem
  wise beyond your youth. You are handsome. You are noble&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very noble,&rdquo; interposed Mardonius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you saved the lives of Mardonius and Artazostra. Did you know
  their nobility when you rescued them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so. I would not let them drown like sheep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The better, then. You acted without low motive of reward. Yet let
  the day never come when Xerxes is called &lsquo;ungrateful&rsquo; for
  benefits done his servants. You shall come to love me by beholding my
  magnanimity. I will make you a Persian, despite your will. Have you seen
  battle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was too young to bear a spear at Marathon,&rdquo; was the
  unflinching answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Learn then to wield it in another army. Where is the
  archsecretary?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That functionary was present instantly. Mardonius, taking the whispers of
  the king, dictated an order which the scribe stamped on his tablet of wet
  clay with a rapid stylus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now the chief proclaimer,&rdquo; was the king&rsquo;s order, which
  brought a tall man in a bright scarlet caftan salaaming to the dais.</p>

  <p>He took the tablet from the secretary and gave a resounding blow upon the
  brass gong dangling from his elbow. The clatter of wine cups ceased. The
  drinkers were silent on pain of death. The herald sent his proclamation in
  stentorian voice down the hall:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>In the name of Xerxes the Achæmenian, king of kings, king of
  Persia, Media, Babylon, and Lydia; smiter of the Scythians, dominator of the
  Indians, terror of the Hellenes; to all peoples of the world his
  slaves,&mdash;hear ye!</i></p>

  <p>&ldquo;Says Xerxes the king, whose word changes not. Forasmuch as Glaucon
  the Athenian did save from death my servant and my sister, Mardonius and
  Artazostra, I do enroll him among the &lsquo;Benefactors of the King,&rsquo;
  a sharer of my bounty forever. Let his name henceforth be not Glaucon, but
  Prexaspes. Let my purple cap be touched upon his head. Let him be given the
  robe of honour and the girdle of honour. Let the treasurer pay him a talent
  of gold. Let my servants honour him. Let those who mock at him be impaled.
  And this I proclaim as my decree.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>What followed Glaucon was too bewildered to recall clearly. He knew that
  the archchamberlain lifted the great jewel-crusted hat from the king&rsquo;s
  head and set it on his own for an instant, that they brought him a flowing
  purple robe, and clasped about his waist a golden belt, every link set with a
  stone of price. The hall arose <i>en masse</i> to drink to the man whom the
  sovran delighted to honour.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hail! Thrice hail to the Lord Prexaspes! Justly rewarded by our
  gracious king!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>No man refused his plaudit, and Glaucon never knew how many envious
  courtiers cheered with their lips and in their hearts muttered dark things
  against &ldquo;the manner in which his Majesty loved to play the god and
  promote this unknown Hellene above the heads of so many faithful
  subjects.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon had made shift to speak some words of deprecation and gratitude to
  royalty; his bow was deeper when the supreme usher led him away from the
  throne than when he approached it. As he made his way out of the banqueting
  hall, a score of noblemen, captains of thousands, over-eunuchs, and more
  trailed at his heels, salaaming, fawning, congratulating, offering all manner
  of service. Not on the days following his victory at the Isthmia had his head
  been in such a whirl. He hardly heard the well-meant warning which Artabanus,
  the shrewd old vizier, gave as he passed the door of the great hall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Play the game well, my new Lord Prexaspes. The king can make you
  satrap or he can crucify you. Play the game well, the stakes are
  high.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Neither did he hear the conversation betwixt Xerxes and the bow-bearer
  whilst he was being conducted away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have I done well to honour this man, Mardonius?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your Eternity was never more wise. Bear with his uncourtliness now,
  for he is truthful, upright, and noble in soul&mdash;qualities rare in a
  Hellene. Give me but time. I will make him a worthy Persian
  indeed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not fail therein,&rdquo; ordered the monarch, &ldquo;for the
  youth has such beauty, both of body and mind, I am grieved he was born in
  Athens. Yet there is one short way to wean him from his doomed and miserable
  country.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will Omnipotence but name it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Search out for him a Persian wife, no, three or four
  wives&mdash;although I have heard the custom of these witless Greeks is to be
  content with only one. There is no surer way to turn his heart than
  that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thank your Eternity for your commandment. It shall not be
  forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mardonius bowed himself. Xerxes called for more wine. The feast lasted
  late and ended in an orgy.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>XVII. -- THE CHARMING BY ROXANA</h2>

  <p class="first">Glaucon&rsquo;s longing for the old life ebbed and flowed.
  Sometimes the return of memory maddened him. Who had done it?&mdash;had
  forged that damning letter and then hid it with Seuthes? Themistocles?
  Impossible. Democrates?&mdash;&ldquo;the friend with the understanding heart
  no less than a brother dear,&rdquo; as Homer said? More impossible. An
  unknown enemy, then, had stolen the fleet order from Themistocles? But what
  man had hated Glaucon? One answer remained,&mdash;unwittingly the athlete had
  offended some god, forgotten some vow, or by sheer good fortune had awakened
  divine jealousy. Poseidon had been implacable toward Odysseus, Athena toward
  Hector, Artemis toward Niobe,&mdash;Glaucon could only pray that his present
  welcome amongst the Persians might not draw down another outburst of
  Heaven&rsquo;s anger.</p>

  <p>More than all else was the keen longing for Hermione. He saw her in the
  night. Vainly, amidst the storms of the gathering war, he had sought a
  messenger to Athens. In this he dared ask no help from Mardonius. Then almost
  from the blue a bolt fell that made him wish to tear Hermione from his
  heart.</p>

  <p>A Carian slave, a trusted steward at the Athenian silver mines of Laurium,
  had loved his liberty and escaped to Sardis. The Persians questioned him
  eagerly, for he knew all the gossip of Athens. Glaucon met the runaway, who
  did not know then who he was, so many Greek refugees were always fluttering
  around the king&rsquo;s court. The Carian told of a new honour for
  Democrates.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is elected strategus for next year because of his proud
  patriotism. There is talk, too, of a more private bit of good
  fortune.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That he has made successful suit to Hermippus of Eleusis for his
  daughter,&mdash;the widow of Glaucon, the dead outlaw. They say the marriage
  follows at the end of the year of mourning&mdash;Sir, you are not
  well!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was never better.&rdquo; But the other had turned ashen. He
  quitted the Carian abruptly and shut himself in his chamber. It was good that
  he wore no sword. He might have slain himself.</p>

  <p>Yet, he communed in his heart, was it not best? Was he not dead to Athens?
  Must Hermione mourn him down to old age? And whom better could she take than
  Democrates, the man who had sacrificed even friendship for love of
  country?</p>

  <p>Artabanus, the vizier, gave a great feast that night. They drank the
  pledge, &ldquo;Victory to the king, destruction to his enemies.&rdquo; The
  lords all looked on Glaucon to see if he would touch the cup. He drank
  deeply. They applauded him. He remained long at the wine, the slaves bore him
  home drunken. In the morning Mardonius said Xerxes ordered him to serve in
  the cavalry guards, a post full of honour and chance for promotion. Glaucon
  did not resist. Mardonius sent him a silvered cuirass and a black horse from
  the steppes of Bactria,&mdash;fleet as the north wind. In his new armour he
  went to the chambers of Artazostra and Roxana. They had never seen him in
  panoply before. The brilliant mail became him rarely. The ladies were
  delighted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You grow Persian apace, my Lord Prexaspes,&rdquo;&mdash;Roxana
  always called him by his new name now,&mdash;&ldquo;soon we shall hail you as
  &lsquo;your Magnificence&rsquo; the satrap of Parthia or Asia or some other
  kingly province in the East.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do well to become Persian,&rdquo; he answered bitterly, unmoved
  by the admiration, &ldquo;for yesterday I heard that which makes it more than
  ever manifest that Glaucon the Athenian is dead. And whether he shall ever
  rise to live again, Zeus knoweth; but from me it is hid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Artazostra did not approach, but Roxana came near, as if to draw the
  buckle of the golden girdle&mdash;the gift of Xerxes. He saw the turquoise
  shining on the tiara that bound her jet-black hair, the fine dark profile of
  her face, her delicate nostrils, the sweep of drapery that half revealed the
  form so full of grace. Was there more than passing friendship in the tone
  with which she spoke to him?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have heard from Athens?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the tidings were evil.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why call them evil, princess? My friends all believe me dead. Can
  they mourn for me forever? They can forget me, alas! more easily than I in my
  lonesomeness can forget them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are very lonely?&rdquo;&mdash;the hand that drew the buckle
  worked slowly. How soft it was, how delicately the Nile sun had tinted
  it!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you say you have no friends? None? Not in Sardis? Not among the
  Persians?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I said not that, dear lady,&mdash;but when can a man have more than
  one native country?&mdash;and mine is Attica, and Attica is far
  away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you can never have another? Can new friendships never take the
  place of those that lie forever dead?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, believe, new home, new friends, new love, are more than
  possible, will you but open your heart to suffer them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The voice both thrilled and trembled now, then suddenly ceased. The colour
  sprang into Roxana&rsquo;s forehead. Glaucon bowed and kissed her hand. It
  seemed to rise to his lips very willingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thank you for your fair hopes. Farewell.&rdquo; That was all he
  said, but as he went forth from Roxana&rsquo;s presence, the pang of the
  tidings brought by the Carian seemed less keen.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The hosts gathered daily. Xerxes spent his time in dicing,
  hunting, drinking, or amusing himself with his favourite by-play,
  wood-carving. He held a few solemn state councils, at which he appeared to
  determine all things and was actually guided by Artabanus and Mardonius. Now,
  at last, all the colossal machinery which was to crush down Hellas was being
  set in motion. Glaucon learned how futile was Themistocles&rsquo;s hope of
  succour to Athens from the Sicilian Greeks, for,&mdash;thanks to
  Mardonius&rsquo;s indefatigable diplomacy,&mdash;it was arranged that the
  Ph&oelig;nicians of Carthage should launch a powerful armament against the
  Sicilians, the same moment Xerxes descended on Sparta and Athens. With calm
  satisfaction Mardonius watched the completion of his efforts. All was
  ready,&mdash;the army of hundreds of thousands, the twelve hundred war-ships,
  the bridges across the Hellespont, the canal at Mt. Athos. Glaucon&rsquo;s
  admiration for the son of Gobryas grew apace. Xerxes was the outward head of
  the attack on Hellas. Mardonius was the soul. He was the idol of the
  army&mdash;its best archer and rider. Unlike his peers, he maintained no huge
  harem of jealous concubines and conspiring eunuchs. Artazostra he worshipped.
  Roxana he loved. He had no time for other women. No servant of Xerxes seemed
  outwardly more obedient than he. Night and day he wrought for the glory of
  Persia. Therefore, Glaucon looked on him with dread. In him Themistocles and
  Leonidas would find a worthy foeman.</p>

  <p>Daily Glaucon felt the Persian influence stealing upon him. He grew even
  accustomed to think of himself under his new name. Greeks were about him:
  Demaratus, the outlawed &ldquo;half-king&rdquo; of Sparta, and the sons of
  Hippias, late tyrant of Athens. He scorned the company of these renegades.
  Yet sometimes he would ask himself wherein was he better than they,&mdash;had
  Democrates&rsquo;s accusation been true, could he have asked a greater reward
  from the Barbarian? And what he would do on the day of battle he did not dare
  to ask of his own soul.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Xerxes left Sardis with the host amidst the same splendour
  with which he had entered. Glaucon rode in the Life Guard, and saw royalty
  frequently, for the king loved to meet handsome men. Once he held the stirrup
  as Xerxes dismounted&mdash;an honour which provoked much envious grumbling.
  Artazostra and Roxana travelled in their closed litters with the train of
  women and eunuchs which followed every Persian army. Thus the myriads rolled
  onward through Lydia and Mysia, drinking the rivers dry by their numbers; and
  across the immortal plains of Troy passed that army which was destined to do
  and suffer greater things than were wrought beside the poet-sung Simois and
  Scamander, till at last they came to the Hellespont, the green river seven
  furlongs wide, that sundered conquered Asia from the Europe yet to be
  conquered.</p>

  <p>Here were the two bridges of ships, more than three hundred in each, held
  by giant cables, and which upbore a firm earthen road, protected by a high
  bulwark, that the horses and camels might take no fright at the water. Here,
  also, the fleet met them,&mdash;the armaments of the East, Ph&oelig;nicians,
  Cilicians, Egyptians, Cyprians,&mdash;more triremes and transports than had
  ever before ridden upon the seas. And as he saw all this power, all directed
  by one will, Glaucon grew even more despondent. How could puny, faction-rent
  Hellas bear up against this might? Only when he looked on the myriads
  passing, and saw how the captains swung long whips and cracked the lash
  across the backs of their spearmen, as over driven cattle, did a little
  comfort come. For he knew there was still a fire in Athens and Sparta, a fire
  not in Susa nor in Babylon, which kindled free souls and free hands to dare
  and do great things. &ldquo;Whom will the high Zeus prosper when the
  <i>slaves</i> of Xerxes stand face to face with <i>men</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A proud thought,&mdash;but it ceased to comfort him, as all that afternoon
  he stood near the marble throne of the &ldquo;Lord of the World,&rdquo;
  whence Xerxes overlooked his myriads while they filed by, watched the races
  of swift triremes, and heard the proud assurances of his officers that
  &ldquo;no king since the beginning of time, not Thothmes of Egypt, not
  Sennacherib of Assyria, not Cyrus nor Darius, had arrayed such hosts as his
  that day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then evening came. Glaucon was, after his wont, in the private pavilion of
  Mardonius,&mdash;itself a palace walled with crimson tapestry in lieu of
  marble. He sat silent and moody for long, the bright fence of the ladies or
  of the bow-bearer seldom moving him to answer. And at last Artazostra could
  endure it no more.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What has tied your tongue, Prexaspes? Surely my brother in one of
  his pleasantries has not ordered that it be cut out? Your skin is too fair to
  let you be enrolled amongst his Libyan mutes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Hellene answered with a pitiful attempt at laughter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silent, am I? Then silent because I am admiring your noble
  ladyship&rsquo;s play of wit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Artazostra shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Impossible. Your eyes were glazed like the blue of Egyptian beads.
  You were not listening to me. You were seeing sights and hearkening to voices
  far away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You press me hard, lady,&rdquo; he confessed; &ldquo;how can I
  answer? No man is master of his roving thoughts,&mdash;at least, not
  I.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were seeing Athens. Are you so enamoured of your stony country
  that you believe no other land can be so fair?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stony it is, lady,&mdash;you have seen it,&mdash;but there is no
  sun like the sun that gilds the Acropolis; no birds sing like the
  nightingales from the grove by the Cephissus; no trees speak with the murmur
  of the olives at Colonus, or on the hill slope at Eleusis-by-the-Sea. I can
  answer you in the words of Homer, the singer of Hellas, the words he sets on
  the tongue of a wanderer and outcast, even as I. &lsquo;A rugged land, yet
  nurse of noble men, and for myself I can see naught sweeter than a
  man&rsquo;s own country.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

  <p>The praise of his native land had brought the colour into the cheeks of
  the Athenian, his voice rose to enthusiasm. He knew that Roxana was watching
  him intently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beautiful it must be, dear Hellene,&rdquo; she spoke, as she sat
  upon the footstool below the couch of her brother, &ldquo;yet you have not
  seen all the world. You have not seen the mystic Nile, Memphis, Thebes, and
  Saïs, our wondrous cities; have not seen how the sun rises over the desert,
  how it turns the sand hills to red gold, how at sunset the cliffs glow like
  walls of beryl and sard and golden jasper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell then of Egypt,&rdquo; said Glaucon, clearly taking pleasure in
  the music of her voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not to-night. I have praised it before. Rather I will praise also
  the rose valleys of Persia and Bactria, whither Mardonius took me after my
  dear father died.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are they very beautiful also?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beautiful as the Egyptian&rsquo;s House of the Blessed, for those
  who have passed the dread bar of Osiris; beautiful as Airyana-Væya, the home
  land of the Aryans, whence Ahura-Mazda sent them forth. The winters are
  short, the summers bright and long. Neither too much rain nor burning heat.
  The Paradise by Sardis is nothing beside them. One breathes in the roses, and
  hearkens to the bulbuls&mdash;our Aryan nightingales&mdash;all day and all
  night long. The streams bubble with cool water. At Susa the palace is fairer
  than word may tell. Hither the court comes each summer from the tedious
  glories of Babylon. The columns of the palace reach up to heaven, but no
  walls engirdle them, only curtains green, white, and blue,&mdash;whilst the
  warm sweet breeze blows always thither from green prairies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You draw a picture fair as the plains of Elysium, dear lady,&rdquo;
  spoke Glaucon, his own gaze following the light that burned in hers,
  &ldquo;and yet I would not seek refuge even in the king&rsquo;s court with
  all its beauty. There are times when I long to pray the god, &lsquo;Give to
  me wings, eagle wings from Zeus&rsquo;s own bird, and let me go to the ends
  of the earth, and there in some charmed valley I may find at last the spring
  of Lethe water, the water of forgetfulness that gives peace.&rsquo;
  &rdquo;</p>

  <p>Roxana looked on him; pity was in her eyes, and he knew he was taking
  pleasure in her pitying.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The magic water you ask is not to be drunk from goblets,&rdquo; she
  answered him, &ldquo;but the charmed valley lies in the vales of Bactria, the
  &lsquo;Roof of the World,&rsquo; high amid mountains crowned with immortal
  snows. Every good tree and flower are here, and here winds the mystic Oxus,
  the great river sweeping northward. And here, if anywhere, on Mazda&rsquo;s
  wide, green earth, can the trouble-tossed have peace.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then it is so beautiful?&rdquo; said the Athenian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; answered Mardonius and Artazostra together. And
  Roxana, with an approving nod from her brother, arose and crossed the tent
  where hung a simple harp.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will my Lord Prexaspes listen,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;if I sing
  him one of the homely songs of the Aryans in praise of the vales by the Oxus?
  My skill is small.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It should suffice to turn the heart of Persephone, even as did
  Orpheus,&rdquo; answered the Athenian, never taking his gaze from her.</p>

  <p>The soft light of the swinging lamps, the heavy fragrance of the
  frankincense which smouldered on the brazier, the dark lustre of the
  singer&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;all held Glaucon as by a spell. Roxana struck the
  harp. Her voice was sweet, and more than desire to please throbbed through
  the strings and song.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;O far away is gliding<br>
  The pleasant Oxus&rsquo;s stream,<br>
  I see the green glades darkling,<br>
  I see the clear pools gleam.<br>
  I hear the bulbuls calling<br>
  From blooming tree to tree.<br>
  Wave, bird, and tree are singing,<br>
  &lsquo;Away! ah, come with me!&rsquo;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;By Oxus&rsquo;s stream is rising<br>
  Great Cyrus&rsquo;s marble halls;<br>
  Like rain of purest silver,<br>
  His tinkling fountain falls;<br>
  To his cool verdant arbours<br>
  What joy with thee to flee.<br>
  I&rsquo;ll join with bird and river,<br>
  &lsquo;Away! rest there with me!&rsquo;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Forget, forget old sorrows,<br>
  Forget the dear things lost!<br>
  There comes new peace, new brightness,<br>
  When darksome waves are crossed;<br>
  By Oxus&rsquo;s streams abiding,<br>
  From pang and strife set free,<br>
  I&rsquo;ll teach thee love and gladness,&mdash;<br>
  Rest there, for aye, with me!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>The light, the fragrance, the song so pregnant with meaning, all wrought
  upon Glaucon of Athens. He felt the warm glow in his cheeks; he felt subtle
  hands outstretching as if drawing forth his spirit. Roxana&rsquo;s eyes were
  upon him as she ended. Their gaze met. She was very fair, high-born,
  sensitive. She was inviting him to put away Glaucon the outcast from Hellas,
  to become body and soul Prexaspes the Persian, &ldquo;Benefactor of the
  King,&rdquo; and sharer in all the glories of the conquering race. All the
  past seemed slipping away from him as unreal. Roxana stood before him in her
  dark Oriental beauty; Hermione was in Athens&mdash;and they were giving her
  in marriage to Democrates. What wonder he felt no mastery of himself, though
  all that day he had kept from wine?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A simple song,&rdquo; spoke Mardonius, who seemed marvellously
  pleased at all his sister did, &ldquo;yet not lacking its sweetness. We
  Aryans are without the elaborate music the Greeks and Babylonians
  affect.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Simplicity is the highest beauty,&rdquo; answered the Greek, as if
  still in his trance, &ldquo;and when I hear Euphrosyne, fairest of the
  Graces, sing with the voice of Erato, the Song-Queen, I grow afraid. For a
  mortal may not hear things too divine and live.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Roxana replaced the harp and made one of her inimitable Oriental
  courtesies,&mdash;a token at once of gratitude and farewell for the evening.
  Glaucon never took his gaze from her, until with a rustle and sweep of her
  blue gauze she had glided out of the tent. He did not see the meaning glances
  exchanged by Mardonius and Artazostra before the latter left them.</p>

  <p>When the two men were alone, the bow-bearer asked a question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear Prexaspes, do you not think I should bless the twelve
  archangels I possess so beautiful a sister?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is so fair, I wonder that Zeus does not haste from Olympus to
  enthrone her in place of Hera.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The bow-bearer laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I crave for her only a mortal husband. Though there are few in
  Persia, in Media, in the wide East, to whom I dare entrust her.
  Perhaps,&rdquo;&mdash;his laugh grew lighter,&mdash;&ldquo;I would do well to
  turn my eyes westward.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon did not see Roxana again the next day nor for several following,
  but in those days he thought much less on Hermione and on Athens.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>XVIII. -- DEMOCRATES&rsquo;S TROUBLES RETURN</h2>

  <p class="first">All through that year to its close and again to the verge of
  springtime the sun made violet haze upon the hills and pure fire of the bay
  at Eleusis-by-the-Sea. Night by night the bird song would be stilled in the
  old olives along the dark waters. There Hermione would sit looking off into
  the void, as many another in like plight has sat and wearily waited, asking
  of the night and the sea the questions that are never answered. As the bay
  shimmered under the light of morning, she could gaze toward the brown crags
  of Salamis and the open Ægean beyond. The waves kept their abiding secret.
  The tall triremes, the red-sailed fishers&rsquo; boats, came and went from
  the havens of Athens, but Hermione never saw the ship that had borne away her
  all.</p>

  <p>The roar and scandal following the unmasking of Glaucon had long since
  abated. Hermippus&mdash;himself full five years grayer on account of the
  calamity&mdash;had taken his daughter again to quiet Eleusis, where there was
  less to remind her of that terrible night at Colonus. She spent the autumn
  and winter in an unbroken shadow life, with only her mother and old Cleopis
  for companions. Reasons not yet told to the world gave her a little hope and
  comfort. But in mere desire to make her dark cloud break, her parents were
  continually giving Hermione pain. She guessed it long before her
  father&rsquo;s wishes passed beyond vaguest hints. She heard him praising
  Democrates, his zeal for Athens and Hellas, his fair worldly prospects, and
  there needed no diviner to reveal Hermippus&rsquo;s hidden meaning. Once she
  overheard Cleopis talking with another maid.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Her Ladyship has taken on terribly, to be sure, but I told her
  mother &lsquo;when a fire blazes too hot, it burns out simply the
  faster.&rsquo; Democrates is just the man to console in another
  year.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the other wiseacre, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s far too
  young and pretty to stay unwedded very long. Aphrodite didn&rsquo;t make her
  to sit as an old maid carding wool and munching beans. One can see
  Hermippus&rsquo;s and Lysistra&rsquo;s purpose with half an eye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cleopis, Nania, what is this vile tattling that I hear?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The young mistress&rsquo;s eyes blazed fury. Nania turned pale. Hermione
  was quite capable of giving her a sound whipping, but Cleopis mustered a bold
  front and a ready lie:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ei!</i> dear little lady, don&rsquo;t flash up so! I was only
  talking with Nania about how Phryne the scullion maid was making eyes at
  Scylax the groom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heard you quite otherwise,&rdquo; was the nigh tremulous answer.
  But Hermione was not anxious to push matters to an issue. From the moment of
  Glaucon&rsquo;s downfall she had believed&mdash;what even her own mother had
  mildly derided&mdash;that Democrates had been the author of her
  husband&rsquo;s ruin. And now that the intent of her parents ever more
  clearly dawned on her, she was close upon despair. Hermippus,
  however,&mdash;whatever his purpose,&mdash;was considerate, nay kindly. He
  regarded Hermione&rsquo;s feelings as pardonable, if not laudable. He would
  wait for time to soothe her. But the consciousness that her father purposed
  such a fate for her, however far postponed, was enough to double all the
  unanswered longing, the unstilled pain.</p>

  <p>Glaucon was gone. And with him gone, could Hermione&rsquo;s sun ever rise
  again? Could she hope, across the end of the æons, to clasp hands even in the
  dim House of Hades with her glorious husband? If there was chance thereof,
  dark Hades would grow bright as Olympus. How gladly she would fare out to the
  shade land, when Hermes led down his troops of helpless dead.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Downward, down the long dark pathway,<br>
  Past Oceanus&rsquo;s great streams,<br>
  Past the White Rock, past the Sun&rsquo;s gates<br>
  Downward to the land of Dreams:<br>
  There they reach the wide dim borders<br>
  Of the fields of asphodel,<br>
  Where the spectres and the spirits<br>
  Of wan, outworn mortals dwell.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>But was this the home of Glaucon the Fair; should the young, the strong,
  the pure in heart, share one condemnation with the mean and the guilty? Homer
  the Wise left all hid. Yet he told of some not doomed to the common lot. Thus
  ran the promise to Menelaus, espoused to Helen.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Far away the gods shall bear you:<br>
  To the fair Elysian plains,<br>
  Where the time fleets gladly, swiftly,<br>
  Where bright Rhadamanthus reigns:<br>
  Snow is not, nor rain, nor winter,<br>
  But clear zephyrs from the west,<br>
  Singing round the streams of Ocean<br>
  Round the islands of the Blest.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Was the pledge for Menelaus only?</p>

  <p>The boats came, the boats went, on the blue bay. But as the spring grew
  warm, Hermione thought less of them, less almost of the last dread vision of
  Glaucon.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The cloud of the Persian hung ever darkening over Athens.
  Continual rumours made Xerxes&rsquo;s power terrible even beyond fact. It was
  hard to go on eating, drinking, frequenting the jury or the gymnasium, when
  men knew to a certainty the coming summer would bring Athens face to face
  with slavery or destruction. Wise men grew silent. Fools took to carousing to
  banish care. But one word not the frailest
  uttered&mdash;&ldquo;submission.&rdquo; Worldly prudence forbade that. The
  women would have stabbed the craven to death with their bodkins. For the
  women were braver than the men. They knew the fate of conquered Ionia: for
  the men only merciful death, for the women the living death of the Persian
  harems and indignities words may not utter. Whether Hellas forsook her or
  aided, Athens had chosen her fate. Xerxes might annihilate her. Conquer her
  he could not.</p>

  <p>Yet the early spring came back sweetly as ever. The warm breeze blew from
  Egypt. Philomela sang in the olive groves. The snows on Pentelicus faded.
  Around the city ran bands of children singing the &ldquo;swallow&rsquo;s
  song,&rdquo; and beseeching the spring donation of honey cakes:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is here, she is here, the swallow; Fair seasons
  bringing,&mdash;fair seasons to follow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And many a housewife, as she rewarded the singers, dropped a silent tear,
  wondering whether another spring would see the innocents anywhere save in a
  Persian slave-pen, or, better fate, in Orchus.</p>

  <p>Yet to one woman that spring there came consolation. On Hermippus&rsquo;s
  door hung a glad olive wreath. Hermione had borne a son. &ldquo;The fairest
  babe she had ever seen,&rdquo; cried the midwife. &ldquo;Ph&oelig;nix,&rdquo;
  the mother called him, &ldquo;for in him shall Glaucon the Beautiful live
  again.&rdquo; Democrates sent a runner every day to Eleusis to inquire for
  Hermione until all danger was passed. On the &ldquo;name-day,&rdquo; ten days
  after the birth, he was absent from the gathering of friends and kinsmen, but
  sent a valuable statuette to Hermione, who left it, however, to her father to
  thank him.</p>

  <p>The day after Ph&oelig;nix was born old Conon, Glaucon&rsquo;s father,
  died. The old man had never recovered from the blow given by the
  dishonourable death of the son with whom he had so lately quarrelled. He left
  a great landed estate at Marathon to his new-born grandson. The exact value
  thereof Democrates inquired into sharply, and when a distant cousin talked of
  contesting the will, the orator announced he would defend the infant&rsquo;s
  rights. The would-be plaintiff withdrew at once, not anxious to cross swords
  with this favourite of the juries, and everybody said that Democrates was
  showing a most scrupulous regard for his unfortunate friend&rsquo;s
  memory.</p>

  <p>Indeed, seemingly, Democrates ought to have been the happiest man in
  Athens. He had been elected &ldquo;strategus,&rdquo; to serve on the board of
  generals along with Themistocles. He had plenty of money, and gave great
  banquets to this or that group of prominent citizens. During the winter he
  had asked Hermippus for his daughter in marriage. The Eumolpid told him that
  since Glaucon&rsquo;s fearful end, he was welcome as a son-in-law. Still he
  could not conceal that Hermione never spoke of him save in hate, and in view
  of her then delicate condition it was well not to press the matter. The
  orator had seemed well content. &ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s fantasies would wear
  away in time.&rdquo; But the rumour of this negotiation, outrunning truth,
  grew into the lying report of an absolute betrothal,&mdash;the report which
  was to drift to Asia and turn Glaucon&rsquo;s heart to stone, gossip having
  always wrought more harm than malignant lying.</p>

  <p>Yet flies were in Democrates&rsquo;s sweet ointment. He knew Themistocles
  hardly trusted him as frankly as of yore. Little Simonides, a man of wide
  influence and keen insight, treated him very coldly. Cimon had cooled also.
  But worse than all was a haunting dread. Democrates knew, if hardly another
  in Hellas, that the Cyprian&mdash;in other words Mardonius&mdash;was safe in
  Asia, and likewise that he had fled on the <i>Solon</i>. Mardonius, then, had
  escaped the storm. What if the same miracle had saved the outlaw? What if the
  dead should awake? The chimera haunted Democrates night and day.</p>

  <p>Still he was beginning to shake off his terrors. He believed he had washed
  his hands fairly clean of his treason, even if the water had cost his soul.
  He joined with all his energies in seconding Themistocles. His voice was
  loudest at the Pnyx, counselling resistance. He went on successful embassies
  to Sicyon and Ægina to get pledges of alliance. In the summer he did his
  uttermost to prepare the army which Themistocles and Evænetus the Spartan led
  to defend the pass of Tempe. The expedition sailed amid high hopes for a
  noble defence of Hellas. Democrates was proud and sanguine. Then, like a
  thunderbolt, there came one night a knock at his door. Bias led to his master
  no less a visitor than the sleek and smiling Ph&oelig;nician&mdash;Hiram.</p>

  <p>The orator tried to cover his terrors by windy bluster. He broke in before
  the Oriental could finish his elaborate salaam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of all the harpies and gorgons you are the least welcome. Were you
  not warned when you fled Athens for Argos never to show your face in Attica
  again?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your Excellency said so,&rdquo; was the bland reply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Admirably you obey it. It remains for me to reward the obedience.
  Bias, go to the street; summon two Scythian watchmen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Thracian darted out. Hiram simply stood with hands folded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is well, Excellency, the lad is gone. I have many things to say
  in confidence to your Nobility. At Lacedæmon my Lord Lycon was gracious
  enough to give certain commands for me to transmit to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Commands? To me? Earth and gods! am I to be commanded by an adder
  like you? You shall pay for this on the rack.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your slave thinks otherwise,&rdquo; observed Hiram, humbly.
  &ldquo;If your Lordship will deign to read this letter, it will save your
  slave many words and your Lordship many cursings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He knelt again before he offered a papyrus. Democrates would rather have
  taken fire, but he could not refuse. And thus he read:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lycon of Lacedæmon to Democrates of Athens, greeting:&mdash;Can he
  who Medizes in the summer Hellenize in the spring? I know your zeal for
  Themistocles. Was it for this we plucked you back from exposure and ruin? Do
  then as Hiram bids you, or repay the money you clutched so eagerly. Fail not,
  or rest confident all the documents you betrayed shall go to Hypsichides the
  First Archon, your enemy. Use then your eloquence on Attic juries! But you
  will grow wise; what need of me to threaten? You will hearken to Hiram.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From Sparta, on the festival of Bellerophon, in the ephorship of
  Theudas.&mdash;<i>Chaire!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates folded the papyrus and stood long, biting his whitened lips in
  silence. Perhaps he had surmised the intent of the letter the instant Hiram
  extended it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you desire?&rdquo; he said thickly, at last.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let my Lord then hearken&mdash;&rdquo; began the Ph&oelig;nician,
  to be interrupted by the sudden advent of Bias.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Scythians are at the door, <i>kyrie</i>,&rdquo; he was
  shouting; &ldquo;shall I order them in and drag this lizard out by the
  tail?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, in Zeus&rsquo;s name, no! Bid them keep without. And do you go
  also. This honest fellow is on private business which only I must
  hear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bias slammed the door. Perhaps he stood listening. Hiram, at least, glided
  nearer to his victim and spoke in a smooth whisper, taking no chances of an
  eavesdropper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excellency, the desire of Lycon is this. The army has been sent to
  Tempe. At Lacedæmon Lycon used all his power to prevent its despatch, but
  Leonidas is omnipotent to-day in Sparta, and besides, since Lycon&rsquo;s
  calamity at the Isthmia, his prestige, and therefore his influence, is not a
  little abated. Nevertheless, the army must be recalled from Tempe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the means?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yourself, Excellency. It is within your power to find a thousand
  good reasons why Themistocles and Evænetus should retreat. And you will do so
  at once, Excellency.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not think you and your accursed masters can drive me from infamy
  to infamy. I can be terrible if pushed to bay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your Nobility has read Lycon&rsquo;s letter,&rdquo; observed the
  Ph&oelig;nician, with folded arms.</p>

  <p>There was a sword lying on the tripod by which Democrates stood; he
  regretted for all the rest of his life that he had not seized it and ended
  the snakelike Oriental then and there. The impulse came, and went. The
  opportunity never returned. The orator&rsquo;s head dropped down upon his
  breast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go back to Sparta, go back instantly,&rdquo; he spoke in a hoarse
  whisper. &ldquo;Tell that Polyphemus you call your master there that I will
  do his will. And tell him, too, that if ever the day comes for vengeance on
  him, on the Cyprian, on you,&mdash;my vengeance will be terrible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your slave&rsquo;s ears hear the first part of your message with
  joy,&rdquo;&mdash;Hiram&rsquo;s smile never grew broader,&mdash;&ldquo;the
  second part, which my Lord speaks in anger,&mdash;I will forget.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go! go!&rdquo; ordered the orator, furiously. He clapped his hands.
  Bias reëntered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell the constables I don&rsquo;t need them. Here is an obol apiece
  for their trouble. Conduct this man out. If he comes hither again, do you and
  the other slaves beat him till there is not a whole spot left on his
  body.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hiram&rsquo;s genuflexion was worthy of Xerxes&rsquo;s court.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My Lord, as always,&rdquo; was his parting compliment, &ldquo;has
  shown himself exceeding wise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus the Oriental went. In what a mood Democrates passed the remaining day
  needs only scant wits to guess. Clearer, clearer in his ears was ringing
  Æschylus&rsquo;s song of the Furies. He could not silence it.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;With scourge and with ban<br>
  We prostrate the man<br>
  Who with smooth-woven wile<br>
  And a fair-facèd smile<br>
  Hath planted a snare for his friend!<br>
  Though fleet, we shall find him;<br>
  Though strong, we shall bind him,<br>
  Who planted a snare for his friend!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>He had intended to be loyal to Hellas,&mdash;to strive valiantly for her
  freedom,&mdash;and now! Was the Nemesis coming upon him, not in one great
  clap, but stealthily, finger by finger, cubit by cubit, until his
  soul&rsquo;s price was to be utterly paid? Was this the beginning of the
  recompense for the night scene at Colonus?</p>

  <p>The next morning he made a formal visit to the shrine of the Furies in the
  hill of Areopagus. &ldquo;An old vow, too long deferred in payment, taken
  when he joined in his first contest on the Bema,&rdquo; he explained to
  friends, when he visited this uncanny spot.</p>

  <p>Few were the Athenians who would pass that cleft in the Areopagus where
  the &ldquo;Avengers&rdquo; had their grim sanctuary without a quick motion of
  the hands to avert the evil eye. Thieves and others of evil conscience would
  make a wide circuit rather than pass this abode of Alecto, Megæra, and
  Tisiphone, pitiless pursuers of the guilty. The terrible sisters hounded a
  man through life, and after death to the judgment bar of Minos. With reason,
  therefore, the guilty dreaded them.</p>

  <p>Democrates had brought the proper sacrifices&mdash;two black rams, which
  were duly slaughtered upon the little altar before the shrine and sprinkled
  with sweetened water. The priestess, a gray hag herself, asked her visitor if
  he would enter the cavern and proffer his petition to the mighty goddesses.
  Leaving his friends outside, the orator passed through the door which the
  priestess seemed to open in the side of the cave. He saw only a jagged,
  unhewn cranny, barely tall enough for a man to stand upright and reaching far
  into the sculptured rock. No image: only a few rough votive tablets set up by
  a grateful suppliant for some mercy from the awful goddesses.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you would pray here, <i>kyrie</i>,&rdquo; said the hag,
  &ldquo;it is needful that I go forth and close the door. The holy Furies love
  the dark, for is not their home in Tartarus?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She went forth. As the light vanished, Democrates seemed buried in the
  rock. Out of the blackness spectres were springing against him. From a cleft
  he heard a flapping, a bat, an imprisoned bird, or Alecto&rsquo;s direful
  wings. He held his hands downward, for he had to address infernal goddesses,
  and prayed in haste.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O ye sisters, terrible yet gracious, give ear. If by my offerings I
  have found favour, lift from my heart this crushing load. Deliver me from the
  fear of the blood guilty. Are ye not divine? Do not the immortals know all
  things? Ye know, then, how I was tempted, how sore was the compulsion, and
  how life and love were sweet. Then spare me. Give me back unhaunted slumber.
  Deliver me from Lycon. Give my soul peace,&mdash;and in reward, I swear it by
  the Styx, by Zeus&rsquo;s own oath, I will build in your honour a temple by
  your sacred field at Colonus, where men shall gather to reverence you
  forever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But here he ceased. In the darkness moved something white. Again a
  flapping. He was sure the white thing was Glaucon&rsquo;s face. Glaucon had
  perished at sea. He had never been buried, so his ghost was wandering over
  the world, seeking vainly for rest. It all came to Democrates in an instant.
  His knees smote together; his teeth chattered. He sprang back upon the door
  and forced it open, but never saw the dove that fluttered forth with him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A hideous place!&rdquo; he cried to his waiting friends. &ldquo;A
  man must have a stronger heart than mine to love to tarry after his prayer is
  finished.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Only a few days later Hellas was startled to hear that Tempe had been
  evacuated without a blow, and the pass left open to Xerxes. It was said
  Democrates, in his ever commendable activity, had discovered at the last
  moment the mountain wall was not as defensible as hoped, and any resistance
  would have been disastrous. Therefore, whilst the retreat was bewailed,
  everybody praised the foresight of the orator. Everybody&mdash;one should
  say, except two, Bias and Phormio. They had many conferences together,
  especially after the coming and going of Hiram.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is a larger tunny in the sea than yet has entered the
  meshes,&rdquo; confessed the fishmonger, sorely puzzled, after much vain
  talk.</p>

  <p>But Hermione was caring for none of these things. Her hands were busy with
  the swaddling clothes. Her thoughts only for that wicker cradle which swung
  betwixt the pillars, where Hermippus&rsquo;s house looked toward Salamis.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>XIX. -- THE COMMANDMENT OF XERXES</h2>

  <p class="first">It is easy to praise the blessings of peace. Still easier to
  paint the horrors of war,&mdash;and yet war will remain for all time the
  greatest game at which human wits can play. For in it every form of courage,
  physical and moral, and every talent are called into being. If war at once
  develops the bestial, it also develops as promptly the heroic. Alone of human
  activities it demands a brute&rsquo;s strength, an iron will, a
  serpent&rsquo;s intellect, a lion&rsquo;s courage&mdash;all in one. And of
  him who has these things in justest measure, history writes, &ldquo;He
  conquered.&rdquo; It was because Mardonius seemed to possess all these, to
  foresee everything, to surmount everything, that Glaucon despaired for the
  fate of Hellas, even more than when he beheld the crushing armaments of the
  Persian.</p>

  <p>Yet for long it seemed as if the host would march even to Athens without
  battle, without invoking Mardonius&rsquo;s skill. The king crossed Thrace and
  Macedonia, meeting only trembling hospitality from the cities along his
  route. At Doriscus he had held a review of his army, and smiled when the
  fawning scribes told how one million seven hundred thousand foot and eighty
  thousand horse followed his banners.(8) Every fugitive and spy from southern
  Hellas told how the hearts of the stanchest patriots were sinking, how
  everywhere save in Athens and Sparta loud voices urged the sending of
  &ldquo;earth and water,&rdquo;&mdash;tokens of submission to the irresistible
  king. At the pass of Tempe covering Thessaly, Glaucon, who knew the hopes of
  Themistocles, had been certain the Hellenes would make a stand. Rumour had it
  that ten thousand Greek infantry were indeed there, and ready for battle. But
  the outlaw&rsquo;s expectations were utterly shattered. To the disgust of the
  Persian lords, who dearly loved brisk fighting, it was soon told how the
  cowardly Hellenes had fled by ship, leaving the rich plains of Thessaly bare
  to the invader.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[8 A number, of course, grossly exaggerated.]</p>

  <p>Thus was blasted Glaucon&rsquo;s last hope. Hellas was doomed. He almost
  looked to see Themistocles coming as ambassador to bring the homage of
  Athens. Since his old life seemed closed to the outlaw, he allowed Mardonius
  to have his will with him,&mdash;to teach him to act, speak, think, as an
  Oriental. He even bowed himself low before the king, an act rewarded by being
  commanded one evening to play at dice with majesty itself. Xerxes was
  actually gracious enough to let his new subject win from him three handsome
  Syrian slave-boys.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You Hellenes are becoming wise,&rdquo; announced the monarch one
  day, when the Locrian envoys came with their earth and water. &ldquo;If you
  can learn to speak the truth, you will equal even the virtues of the
  Aryans.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your Majesty has not found me a liar,&rdquo; rejoined the Athenian,
  warmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You gather our virtues apace. I must consider how I can reward you
  by promotion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The king is overwhelmingly generous. Already I fear many of his
  servants mutter that I am promoted beyond all desert.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mutter? mutter against you?&rdquo; The king&rsquo;s eyes flashed
  ominously. &ldquo;By Mazda, it is against me, then, who advanced you!
  Hearken, Otanes,&rdquo;&mdash;he addressed the general of the Persian
  footmen, who stood near by,&mdash;&ldquo;who are the disobedient slaves who
  question my advancement of Prexaspes?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The general&mdash;he had been the loudest grumbler&mdash;bowed and kissed
  the carpet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None, your Eternity; on the contrary, there is not one Aryan in the
  host who does not rejoice the king has found so noble an object for his
  godlike bounty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You hear, Prexaspes,&rdquo; said Xerxes, mollified. &ldquo;I am
  glad, for the man who questions my wisdom touching your advancement must be
  impaled. To-morrow is my birthday, you will not fail to sit with the other
  great lords at the banquet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The king overpowers me with his goodness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not fail to deserve it. Mardonius is always praising you.
  Consider also how much better it is to depend on a gracious king than on the
  clamour of the fickle mob that rules in your helpless cities!&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The next morning was the royal birthday. The army, pitched
  in the fertile plain by Thessalian Larissa, feasted on the abundance at hand.
  The king distributed huge largesses of money. All day long he sat in his
  palace-like tent, receiving congratulations from even the lowest of his
  followers, and bound in turn not to reject any reasonable petition. The Magi
  sacrificed blooded stallions and rare spices to Mithra the &ldquo;Lord of
  Wide Pastures,&rdquo; to Vohu-Manu the &ldquo;Holy Councillor,&rdquo; and all
  their other angels, desiring them to bless the arms of the king.</p>

  <p>The &ldquo;Perfect Banquet&rdquo; of the birthday came in the evening. It
  hardly differed from the feast at Sardis. The royal pavilion had its poles
  plated with silver, the tapestries were green and purple, the couches were
  spread with gorgeous coverlets. Only the drinking was more moderate, the
  ceremonial less rigid. The fortunate guests devoured dainties reserved for
  the special use of royalty: the flour of the bread was from Assos, the wine
  from Helbon, the water to dilute the wine had come in silver flasks from the
  Choaspes by Susa. The king even distributed the special unguent of
  lion&rsquo;s fat and palm wine which no subject, unpermitted, could use and
  shun the death penalty.</p>

  <p>Then at the end certain of the fairest of the women came and danced
  unveiled before the king&mdash;this one night when they might show forth
  their beauty. And last of all danced Roxana. She danced alone; a diaphanous
  drapery of pink Egyptian cotton blew around her as an evening cloud. From her
  black hair shone the diamond coronet. To the sensuous swing of the music she
  wound in and out before the king and his admiring lords, advancing,
  retreating, rising, swaying, a paragon of agility and grace, feet, body,
  hands, weaving their charm together. When at the end she fell on her knees
  before the king, demanding whether she had done well, the applause shook the
  pavilion. The king looked down on her, smiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rise, sister of Mardonius. All Eran rejoices in you to-night. And
  on this evening whose request can I fail to grant? Whose can I grant more
  gladly than yours? Speak; you shall have it, though it be for half my
  kingdoms.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The dancer arose, but hung down her flashing coronal. Her blush was
  enchanting. She stood silent, while the good-humoured king smiled down on
  her, till Artazostra came from her seat by Mardonius and whispered in her
  ear. Every neck in the crowded pavilion was craned as Artazostra spoke to
  Xerxes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May it please my royal brother, this is the word of Roxana.
  &lsquo;I love my brother Mardonius; nevertheless, contrary to the Persian
  custom, he keeps me now to my nineteenth year unwedded. If now I have found
  favour in the sight of the king, let him command Mardonius to give me to some
  noble youth who shall do me honour by the valiant deeds and the true service
  he shall render unto my Lord.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fair petition! Let the king grant it!&rdquo; shouted twenty;
  while others more wise whispered, &ldquo;This was not done without
  foreknowledge by Mardonius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Xerxes smiled benignantly and rubbed his nose with the lion&rsquo;s fat
  while deliberating.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An evil precedent, lady, an evil precedent when women demand
  husbands and do not wait for their fathers&rsquo; or brothers&rsquo; good
  pleasure. But I have promised. The word of the king is not to be broken.
  Daughter of Gobryas, your petition is granted. Come hither,
  Mardonius,&rdquo;&mdash;the bow-bearer approached the
  throne,&mdash;&ldquo;you have heard the bold desire of your sister, and my
  answer. I must command you to bestow on her a husband.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The bow-bearer bowed obediently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hear the word of the king, and all his mandates are good. This is
  no meet time for marriage festivities, when the Lord of the World and all the
  Aryan power goes forth to war. Yet as soon as the impious rebels amongst the
  Hellenes shall be subdued, I will rejoice to bestow my sister upon whatsoever
  fortunate servant the king may deign to honour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You hear him, lady,&rdquo;&mdash;the royal features assumed a grin,
  which was reflected throughout the pavilion. &ldquo;A husband you shall have,
  but Mardonius shall be revenged. Your fate is in my hands. And shall not
  I,&mdash;guardian of the households of my empire,&mdash;give a warning to all
  bold maidens against lifting their wills too proudly, or presuming upon an
  overindulgent king? What then shall be just punishment?&rdquo; The king bent
  his head, still rubbing his nose, and trying to persuade all about that he
  was meditating.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bardas, satrap of Sogandia, is old; he has but one eye; they say he
  beats his eleven wives daily with a whip of rhinoceros hide. It would be just
  if I gave him this woman also in marriage. What think you,
  Hydarnes?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If your Eternity bestows this woman on Bardas, every husband and
  father in all your kingdoms will applaud your act,&rdquo; smiled the
  commander.</p>

  <p>The threatened lady fell again on her knees, outstretching her hands and
  beseeching mercy,&mdash;never a more charming picture of misery and
  contrition.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You tremble, lady,&rdquo; went on the sovran, &ldquo;and justly. It
  were better for my empire if my heart were less hard. After all, you danced
  so elegantly that I must be mollified. There is the young Prince Zophyrus,
  son of Datis the general,&mdash;he has only five wives already. True, he is
  usually the worse for wine, is not handsome, and killed one of his women not
  long since because she did not sing to please him. Yes&mdash;you shall have
  Zophyrus&mdash;he will surely rule you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mercy, not Zophyrus, gracious Lord,&rdquo; pleaded the abject
  Egyptian.</p>

  <p>The king looked down on her, with a broader grin than ever.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are very hard to please. I ought to punish your wilfulness by
  some dreadful doom. Do not cry out again. I will not hear you. My decision is
  fixed. Mardonius shall bestow you in marriage to a man who is not even a
  Persian by birth, who one year since was a disobedient rebel against my
  power, who even now contemns and despises many of the good customs of the
  Aryans. Hark, then, to his name. When Hellas is conquered, I command that
  Mardonius wed you to the Lord Prexaspes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The king broke into an uproarious laugh, a signal for the thousand loyal
  subjects within the great pavilion to roar with laughter also. In the
  confusion following Artazostra and Roxana disappeared. Fifty hands dragged
  the appointed bridegroom to the king, showering on him all manner of
  congratulations. Xerxes&rsquo;s act was a plain proof that he was adopting
  the beautiful Hellene as one of his personal favourites,&mdash;a post of
  influence and honour not to be despised by a vizier. What
  &ldquo;Prexaspes&rdquo; said when he thanked the king was drowned in the
  tumult of laughing and cheering. The monarch, delighted to play the gracious
  god, roared his injunctions to the Athenian so loud that above the din they
  heard him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will bridle her well, Prexaspes. I know them&mdash;those
  Egyptian fillies! They need a hard curb and the lash at times. Beware the
  tyranny of your own harem. I would not have the satrapies know how certain
  bright eyes in the seraglio can make the son of Darius play the fool. There
  is nothing more dangerous than women. It will take all your courage to master
  them. A hard task lies before you. I have given you one wife, but you know
  our good Persian custom&mdash;five, ten, or twenty. Take the score, I order
  you. Then in twelve years you&rsquo;ll be receiving the prize a Persian king
  bestows every summer on the father of the most children!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And following this broad hint, the king held his sides with laughter
  again, a mirth which it is needless to say was echoed and reëchoed till it
  seemed it could not cease. Only a few ventured to mutter under breath:
  &ldquo;The Hellene will have a subsatrapy in the East before the season is
  over and a treasure of five thousand talents! Mithra wither the
  upstart!&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The summer was waning when the host moved southward from
  Larissa, for mere numbers had made progress slow, and despite
  Mardonius&rsquo;s providence the question of commissariat sometimes became
  difficult. Now at last, leaving behind Thrace and Macedonia, the army began
  to enter Greece itself. As it fared across the teeming plains of Thessaly, it
  met only welcome from the inhabitants and submissions from fresh embassies.
  Report came from the fleet&mdash;keeping pace with the land army along the
  coasts&mdash;that nowhere had the weak squadrons of the Greeks adventured a
  stand. Daily the smile of the Lord of the World grew more complacent, as his
  &ldquo;table-companions&rdquo; told him: &ldquo;The rumour of your
  Eternity&rsquo;s advent stupefies the miserable Hellenes. Like Atar, the
  Angel of Fire, your splendour glitters afar. You will enter Athens and
  Sparta, and no sword leave its sheath, no bow its wrapper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Every day Mardonius asked of Glaucon, &ldquo;Will your Hellenes
  fight?&rdquo; and the answer was ever more doubting, &ldquo;I do not
  know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Long since Glaucon had given up hope of the defeat of the Persian. Now he
  prayed devoutly there might be no useless shedding of blood. If only he could
  turn back and not behold the humiliation of Athens! Of the fate of the
  old-time friends&mdash;Democrates, Cimon, Hermione&mdash;he tried not to
  think. No doubt Hermione was the wife of Democrates. More than a year had
  sped since the flight from Colonus. Hermione had put off her mourning for the
  yellow veil of a bride. Glaucon prayed the war might bring her no new sorrow,
  though Democrates, of course, would resist Persia to the end. As for himself
  he would never darken their eyes again. He was betrothed to Roxana. With her
  he would seek one of those valleys in Bactria which she had praised, the
  remoter the better, and there perhaps was peace.</p>

  <p>Thus the host wound through Thessaly, till before them rose, peak on peak,
  the jagged mountain wall of Othrys and &OElig;ta, fading away in violet
  distance, the bulwark of central Hellas. Then the king&rsquo;s smile became a
  frown, for the Hellenes, undismayed despite his might, were assembling their
  fleet at northern Eub&oelig;a, and at the same time a tempest had shattered a
  large part of the royal navy. The Magi offered sacrifice to appease Tishtrya,
  the Prince of the Wind-ruling Stars, but the king&rsquo;s frown grew blacker
  at each message. Glaucon was near him when at last the monarch&rsquo;s
  thunders broke forth.</p>

  <p>A hot, sultry day. The king&rsquo;s chariot had just crossed the mountain
  stream of the Sphercus, when a captain of a hundred came galloping,
  dismounted, and prostrated himself in the dust.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your tidings?&rdquo; demanded Xerxes, sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be gracious, Fountain of Mercy,&rdquo;&mdash;the captain evidently
  disliked his mission,&mdash;&ldquo;I am sent from the van. We came to a place
  where the mountains thrust down upon the sea and leave but a narrow road by
  the ocean. Your slaves found certain Hellenes, rebels against your benignant
  government, holding a wall and barring all passage to your army.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And did you not forthwith seize these impudent wretches and drag
  them hither to be judged by me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Compassion, Omnipotence,&rdquo;&mdash;the messenger
  trembled,&mdash;&ldquo;they seemed sturdy, well-armed rogues, and the way was
  narrow and steep where a score can face a thousand. Therefore, your slave
  came straight with his tidings to the ever gracious king.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dog! Coward!&rdquo; Xerxes plucked the whip from the
  charioteer&rsquo;s hand and lashed it over the wretch&rsquo;s shoulders.
  &ldquo;By the <i>fravashi</i>, the soul of Darius my father, no man shall
  bring so foul a word to me and live!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Compassion, Omnipotence, compassion!&rdquo; groaned the man,
  writhing like a worm. Already the master-of-punishments was approaching to
  cover his face with a towel, preparatory to the bow-string, but the royal
  anger spent itself just enough to avert a tragedy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your life is forfeit, but I am all too merciful! Take then three
  hundred stripes on the soles of your feet and live to be braver in the
  future.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A thousand blessings on your benignity,&rdquo; cried the captain,
  as they led him away, &ldquo;I congratulate myself that insignificant as I am
  the king yet deigns to notice my existence even to recompense my
  shortcomings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Off,&rdquo; ordered the bristling monarch, &ldquo;or you die the
  death yet. And do you, Mardonius, take Prexaspes, who somewhat knows this
  country, spur forward, and discover who are the madmen thus earning their
  destruction.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The command was obeyed. Glaucon galloped beside the Prince, overtaking the
  marching army, until as they cantered into the little mud-walled city of
  Heraclea a second messenger from the van met them with further details.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The pass is held by seven thousand Grecian men-at-arms. There are
  no Athenians. There are three hundred come from Sparta.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And their chief?&rdquo; asked Glaucon, leaning eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is Leonidas of Lacedæmon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then, O Mardonius,&rdquo; spoke the Athenian, with a throb in his
  voice not there an hour ago. &ldquo;There will be battle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So, whether wise men or mad, the Hellenes were not to lay down their arms
  without one struggle, and Glaucon knew not whether to be sorry or to be
  proud.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>XX. -- THERMOPYLÆ</h2>

  <p class="first">A rugged mountain, an inaccessible morass, and beyond that
  morass the sea: the mountain thrusting so close upon the morass as barely to
  leave space for a narrow wagon road. This was the western gate of Thermopylæ.
  Behind the narrow defile the mountain and swamp-land drew asunder; in the
  still scanty opening hot springs gushed forth, sacred to Heracles, then again
  on the eastern side Mt. &OElig;ta and the impenetrable swamp drew together,
  forming the second of the &ldquo;Hot Gates,&rdquo;&mdash;the gates which
  Xerxes must unlock if he would continue his march to Athens.</p>

  <p>The Great King&rsquo;s couriers reported that the stubborn Hellenes had
  cast a wall across the entrance, and that so far from showing terror at the
  advent of majesty, were carelessly diverting themselves by athletic games,
  and by combing and adorning their hair, a fact which the &ldquo;Lord
  Prexaspes&rdquo; at least comprehended to mean that Leonidas and his Spartans
  were preparing for desperate battle. Nevertheless, it was hard to persuade
  the king that at last he confronted men who would resist him to his face.
  Glaucon said it. Demaratus, the outlawed Spartan, said it. Xerxes, however,
  remained angry and incredulous. Four long days he and his army sat before the
  pass, &ldquo;because,&rdquo; announced his couriers, &ldquo;he wishes in his
  benignity to give these madmen a chance to flee away and shun
  destruction;&rdquo; &ldquo;because,&rdquo; spoke those nearest to Mardonius,
  the brain of the army, &ldquo;there is hot fighting ahead, and the general is
  resolved to bring up the picked troops in the rear before risking a
  battle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then on the fifth day either Xerxes&rsquo;s patience was exhausted or
  Mardonius felt ready. Strong regiments of Median infantry were ordered to
  charge Leonidas&rsquo;s position, Xerxes not failing to command that they
  slay as few of the wretches as possible, but drag them prisoners before his
  outraged presence.</p>

  <p>A noble charge. A terrible repulse. For the first time those Asiatics who
  had forgotten Marathon discovered the overwhelming superiority that the
  sheathing of heavy armour gave the Greek hoplites over the lighter armed
  Median spearmen. The short lances and wooden targets of the attackers were
  pitifully futile against the long spears and brazen shields of the Hellenes.
  In the narrow pass the vast numbers of Barbarians went for nothing. They
  could not use their archers, they could not charge with their magnificent
  cavalry. The dead lay in heaps. The Medes attacked again and again. At last
  an end came to their courage. The captains laid the lash over their mutinous
  troops. The men bore the whips in sullen silence. They would not charge again
  upon those devouring spears.</p>

  <p>White with anger, Xerxes turned to Hydarnes and his
  &ldquo;Immortals,&rdquo; the infantry of the Life Guard. The general needed
  no second bidding. The charge was driven home with magnificent spirit. But
  what the vassal Medes could not accomplish, neither could the lordly
  Persians. The repulse was bloody. If once Leonidas&rsquo;s line broke and the
  Persians rushed on with howls of triumph, it was only to see the
  Hellenes&rsquo; files close in a twinkling and return to the onset with their
  foes in confusion. Hydarnes led back his men at last. The king sat on the
  ivory throne just out of arrow shot, watching the ebb and flow of the battle.
  Hydarnes approached and prostrated himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Omnipotence, I the least of your slaves put my life at your
  bidding. Command that I forfeit my head, but my men can do no more. I have
  lost hundreds. The pass is not to be stormed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Only the murmur of assent from all the well-tried generals about the
  throne saved Hydarnes from paying the last penalty. The king&rsquo;s rage was
  fearful; men trembled to look on him. His words came so thick, the rest could
  never follow all his curses and commands. Only Mardonius was bold enough to
  stand up before his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your Eternity, this is an unlucky day. Is it not sacred to
  Angra-Mainyu the Evil? The arch-Magian says the holy fire gives forth sparks
  of ill-omen. Wait, then, till to-morrow. Verethraghna, the Angel of Victory,
  will then return to your servants.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The bow-bearer led his trembling master to the royal tent, and naught more
  of Xerxes was seen till the morning. All that night Mardonius never slept,
  but went unceasingly the round of the host preparing for battle. Glaucon saw
  little of him. The Athenian himself had been posted among the guard of nobles
  directly about the person of the king, and he was glad he was set nowhere
  else, otherwise he might have been ordered to join in the attack. Like every
  other in the host, he slept under arms, and never returned to
  Mardonius&rsquo;s pavilion. His heart had been in his eyes all that day. He
  had believed Leonidas would be swept from the pass at the first onset. Even
  he had underrated the Spartan prowess. The repulse of the Medes had
  astonished him. When Hydarnes reeled back, he could hardly conceal his joy.
  The Hellenes were fighting! The Hellenes were conquering! He forgot he stood
  almost at Xerxes&rsquo;s side when the last charge failed; and barely in time
  did he save himself from joining in the shout of triumph raised by the
  defenders when the decimated Immortals slunk away. He had grown intensely
  proud of his countrymen, and when he heard the startled Persian lords
  muttering dark forbodings of the morrow, he all but laughed his gladness in
  their faces.</p>

  <p>So the night passed for him: the hard earth for a bed, a water cruse
  wrapped in a cloak for a pillow. And just as the first red blush stole over
  the green Malian bay and the mist-hung hills of Eub&oelig;a beyond, he woke
  with all the army. Mardonius had used the night well. Chosen contingents from
  every corps were ready. Cavalrymen had been dismounted. Heavy masses of
  Assyrian archers and Arabian slingers were advanced to prepare for the attack
  by overwhelming volleys. The Persian noblemen, stung to madness by their
  king&rsquo;s reproaches and their own sense of shame, bound themselves by
  fearful oaths never to draw from the onset until victorious or dead. The
  attack itself was led by princes of the blood, royal half-brothers of the
  king. Xerxes sat again on the ivory throne, assured by every obsequious
  tongue that the sacred fire gave fair omens, that to-day was the day of
  victory.</p>

  <p>The attack was magnificent. For an instant its fury seemed to carry the
  Hellenes back. Where a Persian fell two stepped over him. The defenders were
  swept against their wall. The Barbarians appeared to be storming it. Then
  like the tide the battle turned. The hoplites, locking shields, presented an
  impenetrable spear hedge. The charge spent itself in empty promise.
  Mardonius, who had been in the thickest, nevertheless drew off his men
  skilfully and prepared to renew the combat.</p>

  <p>In the interval Glaucon, standing by the king, could see a short, firm
  figure in black armour going in and out among the Hellenes, ordering their
  array&mdash;Leonidas&mdash;he needed no bird to tell him. And as the Athenian
  stood and watched, saw the Persians mass their files for another battering
  charge, saw the Great King twist his beard whilst his gleaming eyes followed
  the fate of his army, an impulse nigh irresistible came over him to run one
  short bow-shot to that opposite array, and cry in his own Greek
  tongue:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am a Hellene, too! Look on me come to join you, to live and die
  with you, with my face against the Barbarian!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cruel the fate that set him here, impotent, when on that band of
  countrymen Queen Nike was shedding bright glory!</p>

  <p>But he was &ldquo;Glaucon the Traitor&rdquo; still, to be awarded the
  traitor&rsquo;s doom by Leonidas. Therefore the &ldquo;Lord Prexaspes&rdquo;
  must stand at his post, guarding the king of the Aryans.</p>

  <p>The second charge was as the first, the third was as the second. Mardonius
  was full of recourses. By repeated attacks he strove to wear the stubborn
  Hellenes down. The Persians proved their courage seven times. Ten of them
  died gladly, if their deaths bought that of a single foe. But few as were
  Leonidas&rsquo;s numbers, they were not so few as to fail to relieve one
  another at the front of the press,&mdash;which front was fearfully narrow.
  And three times, as his men drifted back in defeat, Xerxes the king
  &ldquo;leaped from the throne whereon he sat, in anguish for his
  army.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At noon new contingents from the rear took the place of the exhausted
  attackers. The sun beat down with unpitying heat. The wounded lay sweltering
  in their agony whilst the battle roared over them. Mardonius never stopped to
  count his dead. Then at last came nightfall. Man could do no more. As the
  shadows from &OElig;ta grew long over the close scene of combat, even the
  proudest Persians turned away. They had lost thousands. Their defeat was
  absolute. Before them and to westward and far away ranged the jagged
  mountains, report had it, unthreaded by a single pass. To the eastward was
  only the sea,&mdash;the sea closed to them by the Greek fleet at the unseen
  haven of Artemisium. Was the triumph march of the Lord of the World to end in
  this?</p>

  <p>Xerxes spoke no word when they took him to his tent that night, a sign of
  indescribable anger. Fear, humiliation, rage&mdash;all these seemed driving
  him mad. His chamberlains and eunuchs feared to approach to take off his
  golden armour. Mardonius came to the royal tent; the king, with curses he had
  never hurled against the bow-bearer before, refused to see him. The battle
  was ended. No one was hardy enough to talk of a fresh attack on the morrow.
  Every captain had to report the loss of scores of his best. As Glaucon rode
  back to Mardonius&rsquo;s tents, he overheard two infantry
  officers:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fearful day&mdash;the bow-bearer is likely to pay for it. I hope
  his Majesty confines his anger only to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Mardonius will walk the Chinvat bridge to-morrow. The
  king is turning against him. Megabyzus is the bow-bearer&rsquo;s enemy, and
  already is gone to his Majesty to say that it is Mardonius&rsquo;s blunders
  that have brought the army to such a plight. The king will catch at that
  readily.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At the tents Glaucon found Artazostra and Roxana. They were both pale. The
  news of the great defeat had been brought by a dozen messengers. Mardonius
  had not arrived. He was not slain, that was certain, but Artazostra feared
  the worst. The proud daughter of Darius found it hard to bear up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My husband has many enemies. Hitherto the king&rsquo;s favour has
  allowed him to mock them. But if my brother deserts him, his ruin is speedy.
  Ah! Ahura-Mazda, why hast Thou suffered us to see this day?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon said what he could of comfort, which was little. Roxana wept
  piteously; he was fain to soothe her by his caress,&mdash;something he had
  never ventured before. Artazostra was on the point of calling her eunuchs and
  setting forth for Xerxes&rsquo;s tent to plead for the life of her husband,
  when suddenly Pharnuches, Mardonius&rsquo;s body-servant, came with news that
  dispelled at least the fears of the women.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am bidden to tell your Ladyships that my master has silenced the
  tongues of his enemies and is restored to the king&rsquo;s good favor. And I
  am bidden also to command the Lord Prexaspes to come to the royal tent. His
  Majesty has need of him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon went, questioning much as to the service to be required. He did
  not soon forget the scene that followed. The great pavilion was lit by a
  score of resinous flambeaux. The red light shook over the green and purple
  hangings, the silver plating of the tent-poles. At one end rose the golden
  throne of the king; before it in a semicircle the stools of a dozen or more
  princes and commanders. In the centre stood Mardonius questioning a
  coarse-featured, ill-favoured fellow, who by his sheepskin dress and leggings
  Glaucon instantly recognized as a peasant of this Malian country. The king
  beckoned the Athenian into the midst and was clearly too eager to stand on
  ceremony.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your Greek is better than Mardonius&rsquo;s, good Prexaspes. In a
  matter like this we dare not trust too many interpreters. This man speaks the
  rough dialect of his country, and few can understand him. Can you
  interpret?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am passing familiar with the Locrian and Malian dialect, your
  Majesty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Question this man further as to what he will do for us. We have
  understood him but lamely.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon proceeded to comply. The man, who was exceeding awkward and ill at
  ease in such august company, spoke an outrageous shepherd&rsquo;s jargon
  which even the Athenian understood with effort. But his business came out
  speedily. He was Ephialtes, the son of one Eurydemus, a Malian, a dull-witted
  grazier of the country, brought to Mardonius by hope of reward. The general,
  partly understanding his purpose, had brought him to the king. In brief, he
  was prepared, for due compensation, to lead the Persians by an almost unknown
  mountain path over the ridge of &OElig;ta and to the rear of Leonidas&rsquo;s
  position at Thermopylæ, where the Hellenes, assailed front and rear, would
  inevitably be destroyed.</p>

  <p>As Glaucon interpreted, the shout of relieved gladness from the Persian
  grandees made the tent-cloths shake. Xerxes&rsquo;s eyes kindled. He clapped
  his hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reward? He shall have ten talents! But where? How?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man asserted that the path was easy and practicable for a large body
  of troops. He had often been over it with his sheep and goats. If the
  Persians would start a force at once&mdash;it was already quite
  dark&mdash;they could fall upon Leonidas at dawn. The Spartan would be
  completely trapped, or forced to open the defile without another spear
  thrust.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A care, fellow,&rdquo; warned Mardonius, regarding the man sharply;
  &ldquo;you speak glibly, but if this is a trick to lead a band of the
  king&rsquo;s servants to destruction, understand you play with deadly dice.
  If the troops march, you shall have your hands knotted together and a soldier
  walking behind to cut your throat at the first sign of treachery.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon interpreted the threat. The man did not wince.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no trap. I will guide you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That was all they could get him to say.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And do not the Hellenes know of this mountain path and guard
  it?&rdquo; persisted the bow-bearer.</p>

  <p>Ephialtes thought not; at least if they had, they had not told off any
  efficient detachment to guard it. Hydarnes cut the matter short by rising
  from his stool and casting himself before the king.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A boon, your Eternity, a boon!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the monarch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Immortals have been disgraced. Twice they have been repulsed
  with ignominy. The shame burns hot in their breasts. Suffer them to redeem
  their honour. Suffer me to take this man and all the infantry of the Life
  Guard, and at dawn the Lord of the World shall see his desire over his
  miserable enemies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The words of Hydarnes are good,&rdquo; added Mardonius, incisively,
  and Xerxes beamed and nodded assent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go, scale the mountain with the Immortals and tell this Ephialtes
  there await him ten talents and a girdle of honour if the thing goes well; if
  ill, let him be flayed alive and his skin be made the head of a
  kettledrum.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The stolid peasant did not blench even at this. Glaucon remained in the
  tent, translating and hearing all the details: how Hydarnes was to press the
  attack from the rear at early dawn, how Mardonius was to conduct another
  onset from the front. At last the general of the guard knelt before the king
  for the last time.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thus I go forth, Omnipotence, and to-morrow, behold your will upon
  your enemies, or behold me never more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have faithful slaves,&rdquo; said Xerxes, rising and smiling
  benignantly upon the general and the bow-bearer. &ldquo;Let us disperse, but
  first let command be given the Magians to cry all night to Mithra and
  Tishtrya, and to sacrifice to them a white horse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your Majesty always enlists the blessings of heaven for your
  servants,&rdquo; bowed Mardonius, as the company broke up and the king went
  away to his inner tent and his concubines. Glaucon lingered until most of the
  grandees had gone forth, then the bow-bearer went to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go back to my tents,&rdquo; ordered Mardonius; &ldquo;tell
  Artazostra and Roxana that all is well, that Ahura has delivered me from a
  great strait and restored me to the king&rsquo;s favour, and that to-morrow
  the gate of Hellas will be opened.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are still bloody and dusty. You have watched all last night and
  been in the thick all day,&rdquo; expostulated the Athenian; &ldquo;come to
  the tents with me and rest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The bow-bearer shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No rest until to-morrow, and then the rest of victory or a longer
  one. Now go; the women are consuming with their care.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon wandered back through the long avenues of pavilions. The lights of
  innumerable camp-fires, the hum of thousands of voices, the snorting of
  horses, the grumbling of camels, the groans of men wounded&mdash;all these
  and all other sights and sounds from the countless host were lost to him. He
  walked on by a kind of animal instinct that took him to Mardonius&rsquo;s
  encampment through the mazes of the canvas city. It was dawning on him with a
  terrible clearness that he was become a traitor to Hellas in very deed. It
  was one thing to be a passive onlooker of a battle, another to be a
  participant in a plot for the ruin of Leonidas. Unless warned betimes the
  Spartan king and all who followed him infallibly would be captured or
  slaughtered to a man. And he had heard all&mdash;the traitor, the discussion,
  the design&mdash;had even, if without his choice, been partner and helper in
  the same. The blood of Leonidas and his men would be on his head. Every curse
  the Athenians had heaped on him once unjustly, he would deserve. Now truly he
  would be, even in his own mind&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;Glaucon the Traitor,
  partner to the betrayal of Thermopylæ.&rdquo; The doltish peasant, lured by
  the great reward, he might forgive,&mdash;himself, the high-born Alcmæonid,
  never.</p>

  <p>From this revery he was shaken by finding himself at the entrance to the
  tents of Mardonius. Artazostra and Roxana came to meet him. When he told of
  the deliverance of the bow-bearer, he had joy by the light in their eyes.
  Roxana had never shone in greater beauty. He spoke of the heat of the sun, of
  his throbbing head. The women bathed his forehead with lavender-water,
  touching him with their own soft hands. Roxana sang again to him, a low,
  crooning song of the fragrant Nile, the lotus bells, the nodding palms, the
  perfumed breeze from the desert. Whilst he watched her through half-closed
  eyes, the visions of that day of battles left him. He sat wrapped in a dream
  world, far from stern realities of men and arms. So for a while, as he
  lounged on the divans, following the play of the torch-light on the face of
  Roxana as her long fingers plied the strings. What was it to him if Leonidas
  fought a losing battle? Was not his happiness secure&mdash;be it in Hellas,
  or Egypt, or Bactria? He tried to persuade himself thus. At the end, when he
  and Roxana stood face to face for the parting, he violated all Oriental
  custom, yet he knew her brother would not be angry. He took her in his arms
  and gave her kiss for kiss.</p>

  <p>Then he went to his own tent to seek rest. But Hypnos did not come for a
  long time with his poppies. Once out of the Egyptian&rsquo;s presence the
  haunting terror had returned, &ldquo;Glaucon the Traitor!&rdquo; Those three
  words were always uppermost. At last, indeed, sleep came and as he slept he
  dreamed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>XXI. -- THE THREE HUNDRED&mdash;AND ONE</h2>

  <p class="first">As Glaucon slept he found himself again in Athens. He was on
  the familiar way from the cool wrestling ground of the Academy and walking
  toward the city through the suburb of Ceramicus. Just as he came to the three
  tall pine trees before the gate, after he had passed the tomb of Solon,
  behold! a fair woman stood in the path and looked on him. She was beyond
  mortal height and of divine beauty, yet a beauty grave and stern. Her gray
  eyes cut to his heart like swords. On her right hand hovered a winged
  Victory, on her shoulder rested an owl, at her feet twined a wise serpent, in
  her left hand she bore the ægis, the shaggy goat-skin engirt with
  snakes&mdash;emblem of Zeus&rsquo;s lightnings. Glaucon knew that she was
  Athena Polias, the Warder of Athens, and lifted his hands to adore her. But
  she only looked on him in silent anger. Fire seemed leaping from her eyes.
  The more Glaucon besought, the more she turned away. Fear possessed him.
  &ldquo;Woe is me,&rdquo; he trembled, &ldquo;I have enraged a terrible
  immortal.&rdquo; Then suddenly the woman&rsquo;s countenance was changed. The
  ægis, the serpent, the Victory, all vanished; he saw Hermione before him,
  beautiful as on the day she ran to greet him at Eleusis, yet sad as was his
  last sight of her the moment he fled from Colonus. Seized with infinite
  longing, he sprang to her. But lo! she drifted back as into the air. It was
  even as when Odysseus followed the shade of his mother in the shadowy Land of
  the Dead.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Yearned he sorely then to clasp her,<br>
  Thrice his arms were opened wide:<br>
  From his hands so strong, so loving,<br>
  Like a dream she seemed to glide,<br>
  And away, away she flitted,<br>
  Whilst he grasped the empty space,<br>
  And a pain shot through him, maddening,<br>
  As he strove for her embrace.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>He pursued, she drifted farther, farther. Her face was inexpressibly
  sorrowful. And Glaucon knew that she spoke to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have believed you innocent, though all Athens calls you
  &lsquo;traitor.&rsquo; I have been true to you, though all men rise up
  against me. In what manner have you kept your innocence? Have you had love
  for another, caresses for another, kisses for another? How will you prove
  your loyalty to Athens and return?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hermione!&rdquo; Glaucon cried, not in his dream, but quite aloud.
  He awoke with a start. Outside the tent sentry was calling to sentry,
  changing the watch just before the dawning. It was perfectly plain to him
  what he must do. His dream had only given shape to the ferment in his brain,
  a ferment never ceasing while his body slept. He must go instantly to the
  Greek camp and warn Leonidas. If the Spartan did not trust him, no matter, he
  had done his duty. If Leonidas slew him on the spot, again no matter, life
  with an eternally gnawing conscience could be bought on too hard terms. He
  knew, as though Zeus&rsquo;s messenger Iris had spoken it, that Hermione had
  never believed him guilty, that she had been in all things true to him. He
  could never betray her trust.</p>

  <p>His head now was clear and calm. He arose, threw on his cloak, and buckled
  about his waist a short sword. The Nubian boy that Mardonius had given him
  for a body-servant awoke on his mat, and asked wonderingly &ldquo;whither his
  Lordship was going?&rdquo; Glaucon informed him he must be at the front
  before daybreak, and bade him remain behind and disturb no one. But the
  Athenian was not to execute his design unhindered. As he passed out of the
  tent and into the night, where the morning stars were burning, and where the
  first red was creeping upward from the sea, two figures glided forth from the
  next pavilion. He knew them and shrank from them. They were Artazostra and
  Roxana.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You go forth early, dearest Prexaspes,&rdquo; spoke the Egyptian,
  throwing back her veil, and even in the starlight he saw the anxious flash of
  her eyes, &ldquo;does the battle join so soon that you take so little
  sleep?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It joins early, lady,&rdquo; spoke Glaucon, his wits wandering. In
  the intensity of his purpose he had not thought of the partings with the
  people he must henceforth reckon foes. He was sorely beset, when Roxana drew
  near and laid her hand upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your Greeks will resist terribly,&rdquo; she spoke. &ldquo;We women
  dread the battle more than you. Yours is the fierce gladness of the combat,
  ours only the waiting, the heavy tidings, the sorrow. Therefore Artazostra
  and I could not sleep, but have been watching together. You will of course be
  near Mardonius my brother. You will guard him from all danger. Leonidas will
  resist fearfully when at bay. Ah! what is this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In pressing closer she had discovered the Athenian wore no cuirass.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will not risk the battle without armour?&rdquo; was her
  cry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall not need it, lady,&rdquo; answered he, and only half
  conscious what he did, stretched forth as if to put her away. Roxana shrank
  back, grieved and wondering, but Artazostra seized his arm quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is this, Prexaspes? All is not well. Your manner is
  strange!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook her off, almost savagely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Call me not Prexaspes,&rdquo; he cried, not in Persian, but in
  Greek. &ldquo;I am Glaucon of Athens; as Glaucon I must live, as Glaucon die.
  No man&mdash;not though he desire it&mdash;can disown the land that bore him.
  And if I dreamed I was a Persian, I wake to find myself a Greek. Therefore
  forget me forever. I go to my own!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Prexaspes, my lover,&rdquo;&mdash;Roxana, strong in fear and
  passion, clung about his girdle, while again Artazostra seized
  him,&mdash;&ldquo;last night I was in your arms. Last night you kissed me.
  Are we not to be happy together? What is this you say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stood one instant silent, then shook himself and put them both aside
  with a marvellous ease.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forget my name,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;If I have given you
  sorrow, I repent it. I go to my own. Go you to yours. My place is with
  Leonidas&mdash;to save him, or more like to die with him!
  Farewell!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He sprang away from them. He saw Roxana sink upon the ground. He heard
  Artazostra calling to the horse-boys and the eunuchs,&mdash;perhaps she bade
  them to pursue. Once he looked back, but never twice. He knew the watchwords,
  and all the sentries let him pass by freely. With a feverish stride he traced
  the avenues of sleeping tents. Soon he was at the outposts, where strong
  divisions of Cissian and Babylonian infantrymen were slumbering under arms,
  ready for the attack the instant the uproar from the rear of the pass told
  how Hydarnes had completed his circuit. Eos&mdash;&ldquo;Rosy-Fingered
  Dawn&rdquo;&mdash;was just shimmering above the mist-hung peak of Mt.
  Telethrius in Eub&oelig;a across the bay when Glaucon came to the last
  Persian outpost. The pickets saluted with their lances, as he went by them,
  taking him for a high officer on a reconnoissance before the onset. Next he
  was on the scene of the former battles. He stumbled over riven shields,
  shattered spear butts, and many times over ghastlier objects&mdash;objects
  yielding and still warm&mdash;dead men, awaiting the crows of the morrow. He
  walked straight on, while the dawn strengthened and the narrow pass sprang
  into view, betwixt mountain and morass. Then at last a challenge, not in
  Persian, but in round clear Doric.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Halt! Who passes?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon held up his right hand, and advanced cautiously. Two men in heavy
  armour approached, and threatened his breast with their lance points.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A friend, a Hellene&mdash;my speech tells that. Take me to
  Leonidas. I&rsquo;ve a story worth telling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Euge!</i> Master &lsquo;Friend,&rsquo; our general can&rsquo;t
  be waked for every deserter. We&rsquo;ll call our decarch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A shout brought the subaltern commanding the Greek outposts. He was a
  Spartan of less sluggish wits than many of his breed, and presently believed
  Glaucon when he declared he had reason in asking for Leonidas.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But your accent is Athenian?&rdquo; asked the decarch, with
  wonderment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, Athenian,&rdquo; assented Glaucon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curses on you! I thought no Athenian ever Medized. What business
  had <i>you</i> in the Persian camp? Who of your countrymen are there save the
  sons of Hippias?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not many,&rdquo; rejoined the fugitive, not anxious to have the
  questions pushed home.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, to Leonidas you shall go, sir Athenian, and state your
  business. But you are like to get a bearish welcome. Since your pretty
  Glaucon&rsquo;s treason, our king has not wasted much love even on repentant
  traitors.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With a soldier on either side, the deserter was marched within the barrier
  wall. Another encampment, vastly smaller and less luxurious than the Persian,
  but of martial orderliness, spread out along the pass. The Hellenes were just
  waking. Some were breakfasting from helmets full of cold boiled peas, others
  buckled on the well-dinted bronze cuirasses and greaves. Men stared at
  Glaucon as he was led by them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A deserter they take to the chief,&rdquo; ran the whisper, and a
  little knot of idle Spartans trailed behind, when at last Glaucon&rsquo;s
  guides halted him before a brown tent barely larger than the others.</p>

  <p>A man sat on a camp chest by the entrance, and was busy with an iron spoon
  eating &ldquo;black broth&rdquo;(9) from a huge kettle. In the dim light
  Glaucon could just see that he wore a purple cloak flung over his black
  armour, and that the helmet resting beside him was girt by a wreath of gold
  foil.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[9 A pottage peculiar to Sparta, made of lumps of meat,
  salt, and much vinegar.]</p>

  <p>The two guards dropped their spears in salute. The man looked upward.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A deserter,&rdquo; reported one of Glaucon&rsquo;s mentors;
  &ldquo;he says he has important news.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; ordered the general, making the iron spoon clack
  steadily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The weal of Hellas rests thereon. Listen!&rdquo; pleaded the
  nervous Athenian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; was the unruffled answer, and still the iron spoon
  went on plying. The Spartan lifted a huge morsel from the pot, chewed it
  deliberately, then put the vessel by. Next he inspected the newcomer from
  head to toe, then at last gave his permission.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon&rsquo;s words were like a bursting torrent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fly, your Excellency! I&rsquo;m from Xerxes&rsquo;s camp. I was at
  the Persian council. The mountain path is betrayed. Hydarnes and the guard
  are almost over it. They will fall upon your rear. Fly, or you and all your
  men are trapped!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; observed the Spartan, slowly, motioning for the
  deserter to cease, but Glaucon&rsquo;s fears made that impossible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say I was in Xerxes&rsquo;s own tent. I was interpreter betwixt
  the king and the traitor. I know all whereof I say. If you do not flee
  instantly, the blood of these men is on your head.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Leonidas again scanned the deserter with piercing scrutiny, then flung a
  question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The blood leaped into the Athenian&rsquo;s cheeks. The tongue that had
  wagged so nimbly clove in his mouth. He grew silent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As the question was repeated, the scrutiny grew yet closer. The soldiers
  were pressing around, one comrade leaning over another&rsquo;s shoulder.
  Twenty saw the fugitive&rsquo;s form straighten as he stood in the morning
  twilight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am Glaucon of Athens, Isthmionices!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Leonidas&rsquo;s jaw dropped for an instant. He showed
  no other astonishment, but the listening Spartans raised a yell.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Death! Stone the traitor!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Leonidas, without a word, smote the man nearest to him with a spear butt.
  The soldiers were silent instantly. Then the chief turned back to the
  deserter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon had never prayed for the gifts of Peitho, &ldquo;Our Lady
  Persuasion,&rdquo; more than at that crucial moment. Arguments,
  supplications, protestations of innocence, curses upon his unknown enemies,
  rushed to his lips together. He hardly realized what he himself said. Only he
  knew that at the end the soldiers did not tug at their hilts as before and
  scowl so threateningly, and Leonidas at last lifted his hand as if to bid him
  cease.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Euge!</i>&rdquo; grunted the chief. &ldquo;So you wish me to
  believe you a victim of fate, and trust your story? The pass is turned, you
  say? Masistes the seer said the libation sputtered on the flame with ill-omen
  when he sacrificed this morning. Then you come. The thing shall be looked
  into. Call the captains.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="first">The locharchs and taxiarchs of the Greeks assembled. It was
  a brief and gloomy council of war. While Euboulus, commanding the Corinthian
  contingent, was still questioning whether the deserter was worthy of
  credence, a scout came running down Mt. &OElig;ta confirming the worst. The
  cowardly Phocians watching the mountain trail had fled at the first arrows of
  Hydarnes. It was merely a question of time before the Immortals would be at
  Alpeni, the village in Leonidas&rsquo;s rear. There was only one thing to
  say, and the Spartan chief said it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must retreat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The taxiarchs of the allied Hellenes under him were already rushing forth
  to their men to bid them fly for dear life. Only one or two stayed by the
  tent, marvelling much to observe that Leonidas gave no orders to his
  Lacedæmonians to join in the flight. On the contrary, Glaucon, as he stood
  near, saw the general lift the discarded pot of broth and explore it again
  with the iron spoon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Father Zeus,&rdquo; cried the incredulous Corinthian leader.
  &ldquo;Are you turned mad, Leonidas?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Time enough for all things,&rdquo; returned the unmoved Spartan,
  continuing his breakfast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Time!&rdquo; shouted Euboulus. &ldquo;Have we not to flee on wings,
  or be cut off?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fly, then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you and your Spartans?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will stay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay? A handful against a million? Do I hear aright? What can you
  do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Die.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The gods forbid! Suicide is a fearful end. No man should rush on
  destruction. What requires you to perish?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Honour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Honour! Have you not won glory enough by holding Xerxes&rsquo;s
  whole power at bay two days? Is not your life precious to Hellas? What is the
  gain?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glory to Sparta.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then in the red morning half-light, folding his big hands across his
  mailed chest, Leonidas looked from one to another of the little circle. His
  voice was still in unemotional gutturals when he delivered the longest speech
  of his life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We of Sparta were ordered to defend this pass. The order shall be
  obeyed. The rest of you must go away&mdash;all save the Thebans, whose
  loyalty I distrust. Tell Leotychides, my colleague at Sparta, to care for
  Gorgo my wife and Pleistarchus my young son, and to remember that
  Themistocles the Athenian loves Hellas and gives sage counsel. Pay Strophius
  of Epidaurus the three hundred drachmæ I owe him for my horse.
  Likewise&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A second breathless scout interrupted with the tidings that Hydarnes was
  on the last stretches of his road. The chief arose, drew the helmet down
  across his face, and motioned with his spear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; he ordered.</p>

  <p>The Corinthian would have seized his hand. He shook him off. At
  Leonidas&rsquo;s elbow was standing the trumpeter for his three hundred from
  Lacedæmon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blow!&rdquo; commanded the chief.</p>

  <p>The keen blast cut the air. The chief deliberately wrapped the purple
  mantle around himself and adjusted the gold circlet over his helmet, for on
  the day of battle a Lacedæmonian was wont to wear his best. And even as he
  waited there came to him out of the midst of the panic-stricken, dissolving
  camp, one by one, tall men in armour, who took station beside him&mdash;the
  men of Sparta who had abided steadfast while all others prepared to flee,
  waiting for the word of the chief.</p>

  <p>Presently they stood, a long black line, motionless, silent, whilst the
  other divisions filed in swift fear past. Only the Thespians&mdash;let their
  names not be forgotten&mdash;chose to share the Laconians&rsquo; glory and
  their doom and took their stand behind the line of Leonidas. With them stood
  also the Thebans, but compulsion held them, and they tarried merely to desert
  and pawn their honour for their lives.</p>

  <p>More couriers. Hydarnes&rsquo;s van was in sight of Alpeni now. The
  retreat of the Corinthians, Tegeans, and other Hellenes became a run; only
  once Euboulus and his fellow-captains turned to the silent warrior that stood
  leaning on his spear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you resolved on madness, Leonidas?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Chaire!</i> Farewell!&rdquo; was the only answer he gave them.
  Euboulus sought no more, but faced another figure, hitherto almost forgotten
  in the confusion of the retreat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haste, Master Deserter, the Barbarians will give you an overwarm
  welcome, and you are no Spartan; save yourself!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon did not stir.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you not see that it is impossible?&rdquo; he answered, then
  strode across to Leonidas. &ldquo;I must stay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you also mad? You are young&mdash;&rdquo; The good-hearted
  Corinthian strove to drag him into the retreating mob.</p>

  <p>Glaucon sprang away from him and addressed the silent general.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shall not Athens remain by Sparta, if Sparta will
  accept?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He could see Leonidas&rsquo;s cold eyes gleam out through the slits in his
  helmet. The general reached forth his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sparta accepts,&rdquo; called he; &ldquo;they have lied concerning
  your Medizing! And you, Euboulus, do not filch from him his glory.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Zeus pity you!&rdquo; cried Euboulus, running at last. One of the
  Spartans brought to Glaucon the heavy hoplite&rsquo;s armour and the
  ponderous spear and shield. He took his place in the line with the others.
  Leonidas stalked to the right wing of his scant array, the post of honour and
  of danger. The Thespians closed up behind. Shield was set to shield. Helmets
  were drawn low. The lance points projected in a bristling hedge in front. All
  was ready.</p>

  <p>The general made no speech to fire his men. There was no wailing, no
  crying to the gods, no curses upon the tardy ephors at Lacedæmon who had
  deferred sending their whole strong levy instead of the pitiful three
  hundred. Sparta had sent this band to hold the pass. They had gone, knowing
  she might require the supreme sacrifice. Leonidas had spoken for all his men.
  &ldquo;Sparta demanded it.&rdquo; What more was to be said?</p>

  <p>As for Glaucon he could think of nothing save&mdash;in the language of his
  people&mdash;&ldquo;this was a beautiful manner and place in which to
  die.&rdquo; &ldquo;Count no man happy until he meets a happy end,&rdquo; so
  had said Solon, and of all ends what could be more fortunate than this?
  Euboulus would tell in Athens, in all Hellas, how he had remained with
  Leonidas and maintained Athenian honour when Corinthian and Tegean turned
  away. From &ldquo;Glaucon the Traitor&rdquo; he would be raised to
  &ldquo;Glaucon the Hero.&rdquo; Hermione, Democrates, and all others he loved
  would flush with pride and no more with shame when men spoke of him. Could a
  life of a hundred years add to his glory more than he could win this day?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blow!&rdquo; commanded Leonidas again, and again pealed the
  trumpet. The line moved beyond the wall toward Xerxes&rsquo;s camp in the
  open beside the Asopus. Why wait for Hydarnes&rsquo;s coming? They would meet
  the king of the Aryans face to face and show him the terrible manner in which
  the men of Lacedæmon knew how to die.</p>

  <p>As they passed from the shadow of the mountain, the sun sprang over the
  hills of Eub&oelig;a, making fire of the bay and bathing earth and heavens
  with glory. In their rear was already shouting. Hydarnes had reached his goal
  at Alpeni. All retreat was ended. The thin line swept onward. Before them
  spread the whole host of the Barbarian as far as the eye could reach,&mdash;a
  tossing sea of golden shields, scarlet surcoats, silver
  lance-heads,&mdash;awaiting with its human billows to engulf them. The
  Laconians halted just beyond bow shot. The line locked tighter. Instinctively
  every man pressed closer to his comrade. Then before the eyes of
  Xerxes&rsquo;s host, which kept silence, marvelling, the handful broke forth
  with their pæan. They threw their well-loved charging song of Tyrtæus in the
  very face of the king.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Press the charge, O sons of Sparta!<br>
  Ye are sons of men born free:<br>
  Press the charge; &rsquo;tis where the shields lock,<br>
  That your sires would have you be!<br>
  Honour&rsquo;s cheaply sold for life,<br>
  Press the charge, and join the strife:<br>
  Let the coward cling to breath,<br>
  Let the base shrink back from death,<br>
  Press the charge, let cravens flee!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Leonidas&rsquo;s spear pointed to the ivory throne, around which and him
  that sat thereon in blue and scarlet glittered the Persian grandees.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Onward!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Immortal ichor seemed in the veins of every Greek. They burst into one
  shout.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The king! The king!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A roar from countless drums, horns, and atabals answered from the
  Barbarians, as across the narrow plain-land charged the three
  hundred&mdash;and one.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>XXII. -- MARDONIUS GIVES A PROMISE</h2>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;Ugh&mdash;the dogs died hard, but they are
  dead,&rdquo; grunted Xerxes, still shivering on the ivory throne. The battle
  had raged disagreeably close to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are dead; even so perish all of your Eternity&rsquo;s
  enemies,&rdquo; rejoined Mardonius, close by. The bow-bearer himself was
  covered with blood and dust. A Spartan sword had grazed his forehead. He had
  exposed himself recklessly, as well he might, for it had taken all the
  efforts of the Persian captains, as well as the ruthless laying of whips over
  the backs of their men, to make the king&rsquo;s battalions face the frenzied
  Hellenes, until the closing in of Hydarnes from the rear gave the battle its
  inevitable ending.</p>

  <p>Xerxes was victorious. The gate of Hellas was unlocked. The mountain wall
  of &OElig;ta would hinder him no more. But the triumph had been bought with a
  price which made Mardonius and every other general in the king&rsquo;s host
  shake his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; reported Hystaspes, commander of the Scythians,
  &ldquo;one man in every seven of my band is slain, and those the
  bravest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; spoke Artabazus, who led the Parthians, &ldquo;my men
  swear the Hellenes were possessed by <i>dævas</i>. They dare not approach
  even their dead bodies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; asked Hydarnes, &ldquo;will it please your Eternity to
  appoint five other officers in the Life Guard, for of my ten lieutenants over
  the Immortals five are slain?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the heaviest news no man save Mardonius dared to bring to the
  king.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May it please your Omnipotence,&rdquo; spoke the bow-bearer,
  &ldquo;to order the funeral pyres of cedar and precious oils to be prepared
  for your brothers Abrocomes and Hyperanthes, and command the Magians to offer
  prayers for the repose of their <i>fravashis</i> in Garonmana the Blessed,
  for it pleased Mazda the Great they should fall before the
  Hellenes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Xerxes waved his hand in assent. It was hard to be the &ldquo;Lord of the
  World,&rdquo; and be troubled by such little things as the deaths of a few
  thousand servants, or even of two of his numerous half-brethren, hard at
  least on a day like this when he had seen his desire over his enemies.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They shall be well avenged,&rdquo; he announced with kingly
  dignity, then smiled with satisfaction when they brought him the shield and
  helmet of Leonidas, the madman, who had dared to contemn his power. But all
  the generals who stood by were grim and sad. One more such victory would
  bring the army close to destruction.</p>

  <p>Xerxes&rsquo;s happiness, however, was not to be clouded. From childish
  fears he had passed to childish exultation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you found the body also of this crazed Spartan?&rdquo; he
  inquired of the cavalry officer who had brought the trophies.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As you say, Omnipotence,&rdquo; rejoined the captain, bowing in the
  saddle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good, then. Let the head be struck off and the trunk fastened on a
  cross that all may see it. And you, Mardonius,&rdquo; addressing the
  bow-bearer, &ldquo;ride back to the hillock where these madmen made their
  last stand. If you discover among the corpses any who yet breathe, bring them
  hither to me, that they may learn the futility of resisting my
  might.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The bow-bearer shrugged his shoulders. He loved a fair battle and fair
  treatment of valiant foes. The dishonouring of the corpse of Leonidas was
  displeasing to more than one high-minded Aryan nobleman. But the king had
  spoken, and was to be obeyed. Mardonius rode back to the hillock at the mouth
  of the pass, where the Hellenes had retired&mdash;after their spears were
  broken and they could resist only with swords, stones, or naked
  hands&mdash;for the final death grip.</p>

  <p>The slain Barbarians lay in heaps. The Greeks had been crushed at the end,
  not in close strife, but by showers of arrows. Mardonius dismounted and went
  with a few followers among the dead. Plunderers were already at their harpy
  work of stripping the slain. The bow-bearer chased them angrily away. He
  oversaw the task which his attendants performed as quickly as possible. Their
  toil was not quite fruitless. Three or four Thespians were still breathing, a
  few more of the helots who had attended Leonidas&rsquo;s Spartans, but not
  one of the three hundred but seemed dead, and that too with many wounds.</p>

  <p>Snofru, Mardonius&rsquo;s Egyptian body-servant, rose from the ghastly
  work and grinned with his ivories at his master.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All the rest are slain, Excellency.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have not searched that pile yonder.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Snofru and his helpers resumed their toil. Presently the Egyptian dragged
  from a bloody heap a body, and raised a yell. &ldquo;Another one&mdash;he
  breathes!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s life in him. He shall not be left to the crows. Take
  him forth and lay him with the others that are living.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was not easy to roll the three corpses from their feebly stirring
  comrade. When this was done, the stricken man was still encased in his
  cuirass and helmet. They saw only that his hands were slim and white.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With care,&rdquo; ordered the humane bow-bearer, &ldquo;he is a
  young man. I heard Leonidas took only older men on his desperate venture.
  Here, rascals, do you not see he is smothered in that helmet? Lift him up,
  unbuckle the cuirass. By Mithra, he has a strong and noble form! Now the
  helmet&mdash;uncover the face.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But as the Egyptian did so, his master uttered a shout of mingled
  wonderment and terror.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon&mdash;Prexaspes, and in Spartan armour!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>What had befallen Glaucon was in no wise miraculous. He had borne his part
  in the battle until the Hellenes fell back to the fatal hillock. Then in one
  of the fierce onsets which the Barbarians attempted before they had recourse
  to the simpler and less glorious method of crushing their foes by arrow fire,
  a Babylonian&rsquo;s war club had dashed upon his helmet. The stout bronze
  had saved him from wound, but under the stroke strength and consciousness had
  left him in a flash. The moment after he fell, the soldier beside him had
  perished by a javelin, and falling above the Athenian made his body a ghastly
  shield against the surge and trampling of the battle. Glaucon lay scathless
  but senseless through the final catastrophe. Now consciousness was returning,
  but he would have died of suffocation save for Snofru&rsquo;s timely aid.</p>

  <p>It was well for the Athenian that Mardonius was a man of ready devices. He
  had not seen Glaucon at his familiar post beside the king, but had presumed
  the Hellene had remained at the tents with the women, unwilling to watch the
  destruction of his people. In the rush and roar of the battle the messenger
  Artazostra had sent her husband telling of &ldquo;Prexaspes&rsquo;s&rdquo;
  flight had never reached him. But Mardonius could divine what had happened.
  The swallow must fly south in the autumn. The Athenian had returned to his
  own. The bow-bearer&rsquo;s wrath at his protégé&rsquo;s desertion was
  overmastered by the consuming fear that tidings of Prexaspes&rsquo;s
  disloyalty would get to the king. Xerxes&rsquo;s wrath would be boundless.
  Had he not proffered his new subject all the good things of his empire? And
  to be rewarded thus! Glaucon&rsquo;s recompense would be to be sawn asunder
  or flung into a serpent&rsquo;s cage.</p>

  <p>Fortunately Mardonius had only his own personal followers around him. He
  could count on their discreet loyalty. Vouchsafing no explanations, but
  bidding them say not a word of their discovery on their heads, he ordered
  Snofru and his companions to make a litter of cloaks and lances, to throw
  away Glaucon&rsquo;s tell-tale Spartan armour, and bear him speedily to
  Artazostra&rsquo;s tents. The stricken man was groaning feebly, moving his
  limbs, muttering incoherently. The sight of Xerxes driving in person to
  inspect the battle-field made Mardonius hasten the litter away, while he
  remained to parley with the king.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So only a few are alive?&rdquo; asked Xerxes, leaning over the
  silver rail of the chariot, and peering on the upturned faces of the dead
  which were nearly trampled by his horses. &ldquo;Are any sound enough to set
  before me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None, your Eternity; even the handful that live are desperately
  wounded. We have laid them yonder.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let them wait, then; all around here seem dead. Ugly hounds!&rdquo;
  muttered the monarch, still peering down; &ldquo;even in death they seem to
  grit their teeth and defy me. Faugh! The stench is already terrible. It is
  just as well they are dead. Angra-Mainyu surely possessed them to fight so!
  It cannot be there are many more who can fight like this left in Hellas,
  though Demaratus, the Spartan outlaw, says there are. Drive away,
  Pitiramphes&mdash;and you, Mardonius, ride beside me. I cannot abide those
  corpses. Where is my handkerchief? The one with the Sabæan nard on it. I will
  hold it to my nose. Most refreshing! And I had a question to ask&mdash;I have
  forgotten what.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whether news has come from the fleets before Artemisium?&rdquo;
  spoke Mardonius, galloping close to the wheel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not that. Ah! I remember. Where was Prexaspes? I did not see him
  near me. Did he stay in the tents while these mad men were destroyed? It was
  not loyal, yet I forgive him. After all, he was once a Hellene.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May it please your Eternity,&rdquo;&mdash;Mardonius chose his words
  carefully,&mdash;a Persian always loved the truth, and lies to the king were
  doubly impious,&mdash;&ldquo;Prexaspes was not in the tents but in the thick
  of the battle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Xerxes smiled pleasantly, &ldquo;it was right loyal of
  him to show his devotion to me thus. And he acquitted himself
  valiantly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Most valiantly, Omnipotence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Doubly good. Yet he ought to have stayed near me. If he had been a
  true Persian, he would not have withdrawn from the person of the king, even
  to display his prowess in combat. Still he did well. Where is he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I regret to tell your Eternity he was desperately wounded, though
  your servant hopes not unto death. He is even now being taken to my
  tents.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where that pretty dancer, your sister, will play the
  surgeon&mdash;ha!&rdquo; cried the king. &ldquo;Well, tell him his Lord is
  grateful. He shall not be forgotten. If his wounds do not mend, call in my
  body-physicians. And I will send him something in gratitude&mdash;a golden
  cimeter, perhaps, or it may be another cream Nisæan charger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A general rode up to the chariot with his report, and Mardonius was
  suffered to gallop to his own tents, blessing Mazda; he had saved the
  Athenian, yet had not told a lie.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The ever ready eunuchs of Artazostra ran to tell Mardonius
  of the Hellene&rsquo;s strange desertion, even before their lord dismounted.
  Mardonius was not astonished now, however much the tidings pained him. The
  Greek had escaped more than trifling wounds; ten days would see him sound and
  hale, but the stunning blow had left his wits still wandering. He had
  believed himself dead at first, and demanded why Charon took so long with his
  ferry-boat. He had not recognized Roxana, but spoke one name many
  times&mdash;&ldquo;Hermione!&rdquo; And the Egyptian, understanding too well,
  went to her own tent weeping bitterly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has forsaken us,&rdquo; spoke Artazostra, harshly, to her
  husband. &ldquo;He has paid kindness with disloyalty. He has chosen the lot
  of his desperate race rather than princely state amongst the Aryans. Your
  sister is in agony.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I with her,&rdquo; returned the bow-bearer, gravely, &ldquo;but
  let us not forget one thing&mdash;this man has saved our lives. And all else
  weighs small in the balance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When Mardonius went to him, Glaucon was again himself. He lay on bright
  pillows, his forehead swathed in linen. His eyes were unnaturally bright.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know what has befallen?&rdquo; asked Mardonius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They have told me. I almost alone of all the Hellenes have not been
  called to the heroes&rsquo; Elysium, to the glory of Theseus and Achilles,
  the glory that shall not die. Yet I am content. For plainly the Olympians
  have destined that I should see and do great things in Hellas, otherwise they
  would not have kept me back from Leonidas&rsquo;s glory.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Athenian&rsquo;s voice rang confidently. None of the halting weakness
  remained that had made it falter once when Mardonius asked him, &ldquo;Will
  your Hellenes fight?&rdquo; He spoke as might one returned crowned with the
  victor&rsquo;s laurel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And wherefore are you grown so bold?&rdquo; The bow-bearer was
  troubled as he looked on him. &ldquo;Nobly you and your handful fought. We
  Persians honour the brave, and full honour we give to you. But was it not
  graven upon the stars what should befall? Were not Leonidas, his men, and you
  all mad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! divinely mad.&rdquo; Brighter still grew the
  Athenian&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;For that moment of exultation when we charged
  to meet the king I would again pay a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet the gateway of Hellas is unlocked. Your bravest are fallen.
  Your land is defenceless. What else can be written hereafter save, &lsquo;The
  Hellenes strove with fierce courage to fling back Xerxes. Their valour was
  foolishness. The god turned against them. The king prevailed.&rsquo;
  &rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Glaucon met the Persian&rsquo;s glance with one more bold.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Mardonius, good friend, for do not think that we must be foes
  one to another because our people are at war,&mdash;I can answer you with
  ease. Leonidas you have slain, and his handful, and you have pierced the
  mountain wall of &OElig;ta, and no doubt your king&rsquo;s host will march
  even to Athens. But do not dream Hellas is conquered by striding over her
  land. Before you shall possess the land you must first possess the men. And I
  say to you, Athens is still left, and Sparta left, free and strong, with men
  whose hearts and hands can never fail. I doubted once. But now I doubt no
  more. And our gods will fight for us. Your Ahura-Mazda has still to prevail
  over Zeus the Thunderer and Athena of the Pure Heart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; asked the Persian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And as for me, I know I have cast away by my own act all the good
  things you and your king would fain bestow upon me. Perhaps I deserve death
  at your hands. I will never plead for respite, but this I know, whether I
  live or die, it shall be as Glaucon of Athens who owns no king but Zeus, no
  loyalty save to the land that bore him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was stillness in the tent. The wounded man sank back on the pillows,
  breathing deep, closing his eyes, expectant almost of a burst of wrath from
  the Persian. But Mardonius answered without trace of anger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Friend, your words cut keenly, and your boasts are high. Only the
  Most High knoweth whether you boast aright. Yet this I say, that much as I
  desire your friendship, would see you my brother, even,&mdash;you know
  that,&mdash;I dare not tell you you do wholly wrong. A man is given one
  country and one manner of faith in God. He does not choose them. I was born
  to serve the lord of the Aryans, and to spread the triumphs of Mithra the
  Glorious, and you were born in Athens. I would it were otherwise. Artazostra
  and I would fain have made you Persian like ourselves. My sister loves you.
  Yet we cannot strive against fate. Will you go back to your own people and
  share their lot, however direful?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Since life is given me, I will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mardonius stepped to the bedside and gave the Athenian his right hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At the island you saved my life and that of my best beloved. Let it
  never be said that Mardonius, son of Gobryas, is ungrateful. To-day, in some
  measure, I have repaid the debt I owe. If you will have it so, as speedily as
  your strength returns and opportunity offers I will return you to your
  people. And amongst them may your own gods show you favour, for you will have
  none from ours!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon took the proffered hand in silent gratitude. He was still very
  weak and rested on the pillows, breathing hard. The bow-bearer went out to
  his wife and his sister and told his promise. There was little to be said.
  The Athenian must go his path, and they go theirs, unless he were to be
  handed over to Xerxes to die a death of torments. And not even Roxana, keenly
  as pierced her sorrow, would think of that.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>XXIII. -- THE DARKEST HOUR</h2>

  <p class="first">A city of two hundred thousand awaiting a common sentence of
  death,&mdash;such seemed the doom of Athens.</p>

  <p>Every morning the golden majesty of the sun rose above the wall of
  Hymettus, but few could lift their hands to Lord Helios and give praise for
  another day of light. &ldquo;Each sunrise brings Xerxes nearer.&rdquo; The
  bravest forgot not that.</p>

  <p>Yet Athens was never more truly the &ldquo;Violet-Crowned City&rdquo; than
  on these last days before the fearful advent. The sun at morn on Hymettus,
  the sun at night on Daphni, the nightingales and cicadas in the olives by
  Cephissus, the hum of bees on the sweet thyme of the mountain, the purple of
  the hills, the blue and the fire of the bay, the merry tinkle of the goat
  bells upon the rocks, the laugh of little children in the streets&mdash;all
  these made Athens fair, but could not take the cloud from the hearts of the
  people.</p>

  <p>Trade was at standstill in the Agora. The most careless frequented the
  temples. Old foes composed their cases before the arbitrator. The courts were
  closed, but there was meeting after meeting in the Pnyx, with incessant
  speeches on one theme&mdash;how Athens must resist to the bitter end.</p>

  <p>And why should not the end be bitter? Argos and Crete had Medized. Corcyra
  promised and did nothing. Thebes was weakening. Thessaly had sent earth and
  water. Corinth, Ægina, and a few lesser states were moderately loyal, but
  great Sparta only procrastinated and despatched no help to her Athenian ally.
  So every day the Persian thunder-cloud was darkening.</p>

  <p>But one man never faltered, nor suffered others about him to
  falter,&mdash;Themistocles. The people heard him gladly&mdash;he would never
  talk of defeat. He had a thousand reasons why the invader should be baffled,
  from a convenient hexameter in old Bacis&rsquo;s oracle book, up to the fact
  that the Greeks used the longest spears. If he found it weary work looking
  the crowding peril in the face and smiling still, he never confessed it. His
  friends would marvel at his serenity. Only when they saw him sit silent, saw
  his brows knit, his hand comb at his beard, they knew his inexhaustible brain
  was weaving the web which should ensnare the lord of the Aryans.</p>

  <p>Thus day after day&mdash;while men thought dark things in their
  hearts.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Hermippus had come down to his city house from Eleusis, and
  with him his wife and daughter. The Eleusinian was very busy. He was a member
  of the Areopagus, the old council of ex-archons, an experienced body that
  found much to do. Hermippus had strained his own resources to provide shields
  for the hoplites. He was constantly with Themistocles, which implied being
  much with Democrates. The more he saw of the young orator, the better the
  Eleusinian liked him. True, not every story ran to Democrates&rsquo;s credit,
  but Hermippus knew the world, and could forgive a young man if he had
  occasionally spent a jolly night. Democrates seemed to have forsworn Ionian
  harp-girls now. His patriotism was self-evident. The Eleusinian saw in him a
  most desirable protector in the perils of war for Hermione and her child.
  Hermione&rsquo;s dislike for her husband&rsquo;s destroyer was
  natural,&mdash;nay, in bounds, laudable,&mdash;but one must not give way too
  much to women&rsquo;s phantasies. The lady was making a Cyclops of Democrates
  by sheer imagination; an interview would dispel her prejudices. Therefore
  Hermippus planned, and his plan was not hard to execute.</p>

  <p>On the day the fleet sailed to Artemisium, Hermione went with her mother
  to the havens, as all the city went, to wish godspeed to the &ldquo;wooden
  wall&rdquo; of Hellas.</p>

  <p>One hundred and twenty-seven triremes were to go forth, and three and
  fifty to follow, bearing the best and bravest of Athens with them.
  Themistocles was in absolute command, and perhaps in his heart of hearts
  Democrates was not mournful if it lay out of his power to do a second
  ill-turn to his country.</p>

  <p>It was again summer, and again such a day as when Glaucon with glad
  friends had rowed toward Salamis. The Saronian bay flashed fairest azure. The
  scattered isles and the headlands of Argolis rose in clear beauty. The city
  had emptied itself. Mothers hung on the necks of sons as the latter strode
  toward Peiræus; friends clasped hands for the last time as he who remained
  promised him who went that the wife and little ones should never be
  forgotten. Only Hermione, as she stood on the hill of Munychia above the
  triple havens, shed no tear. The ship bearing her all was gone long since.
  Themistocles would never lead it back. Hermippus was at the quay in Peiræus,
  taking leave of the admiral. Old Cleopis held the babe as Hermione stood by
  her mother. The younger woman had suffered her gaze to wander to far Ægina,
  where a featherlike cloud hung above the topmost summit of the isle, when her
  mother&rsquo;s voice called her back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A line of streamers blew from the foremast of the <i>Nausicaä</i> as the
  piper on the flag-ship gave the time to the oars. The triple line of blades,
  pumiced white, splashed with a steady rhythm. The long black hull glided
  away. The trailing line of consorts swiftly followed. From the hill and the
  quays a shout uprose from the thousands, to be answered by the fleet,&mdash;a
  cheer or a prayer to sea-ruling Poseidon those who gave it hardly knew. The
  people stood silent till the last dark hull crept around the southern
  headland; then, still in silence, the multitudes dissolved. The young and the
  strong had gone from them. For Athens this was the beginning of the war.</p>

  <p>Hermione and Lysistra awaited Hermippus before setting homeward, but the
  Eleusinian was delayed. The fleet had vanished. The havens were empty. In
  Cleopis&rsquo;s arms little Ph&oelig;nix wept. His mother was anxious to be
  gone, when she was surprised to see a figure climbing the almost deserted
  slope. A moment more and she was face to face with Democrates, who advanced
  outstretching his hand and smiling.</p>

  <p>The orator wore the dress of his new office of strategus. The purple-edged
  cloak, the light helmet wreathed with myrtle, the short sword at his side,
  all became him well. If there were deeper lines about his face than on the
  day Hermione last saw him, even an enemy would confess a leader of the
  Athenians had cause to be thoughtful. He was cordially greeted by Lysistra
  and seemed not at all abashed that Hermione gave only a sullen nod. From the
  ladies he turned with laughter to Cleopis and her burden.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A new Athenian!&rdquo; spoke he, lightly, &ldquo;and I fear Xerxes
  will have been chased away before he has a chance to prove his valour. But
  fear not, there will be more brave days in store.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hermione shook her head, ill-pleased.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blessed be Hera, my babe is too young to know aught of wars. And if
  we survive this one, will not just Zeus spare us from further
  bloodshed?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates, without answering, approached the nurse, and
  Ph&oelig;nix&mdash;for reasons best known to himself&mdash;ceased lamenting
  and smiled up in the orator&rsquo;s face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His mother&rsquo;s features and eyes,&rdquo; cried Democrates.
  &ldquo;I swear it&mdash;ay, by all Athena&rsquo;s owls&mdash;that young
  Hermes when he lay in Maia&rsquo;s cave on Mt. Cylene was not finer or
  lustier than he. His mother&rsquo;s face and eyes, I say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His father&rsquo;s,&rdquo; corrected Hermione. &ldquo;Is not his
  name Ph&oelig;nix? In him will not Glaucon the Beautiful live again? Will he
  not grow to man&rsquo;s estate to avenge his murdered father?&rdquo; The lady
  spoke without passion, but with a cold bitterness that made Democrates cease
  from smiling. He turned away from the babe.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forgive me, dear lady,&rdquo; he answered her, &ldquo;I am wiser at
  ruling the Athenians than at ruling children, but I see nothing of Glaucon
  about the babe, though much of his beautiful mother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You had once a better memory, Democrates,&rdquo; said Hermione,
  reproachfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not understand your Ladyship.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean that Glaucon has been dead one brief year. Can you forget
  <i>his</i> face in so short a while?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But here Lysistra interposed with all good intent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are fond and foolish, Hermione, and like all young mothers are
  enraged if all the world does not see his father&rsquo;s image in their
  first-born.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Democrates knows what I would say,&rdquo; said the younger woman,
  soberly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Since your Ladyship is pleased to speak in riddles and I am no seer
  nor oracle-monger, I must confess I cannot follow. But we will contend no
  more concerning little Ph&oelig;nix. Enough that he will grow up fair as the
  Delian Apollo and an unspeakable joy to his mother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Her only joy,&rdquo; was Hermione&rsquo;s icy answer. &ldquo;Wrap
  up the child, Cleopis. My father is coming. It is a long walk home to the
  city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With a rustle of white Hermione went down the slope in advance of her
  mother. Hermippus and Lysistra were not pleased. Plainly their daughter kept
  all her prejudice against Democrates. Her cold contempt was more
  disappointing even than open fury.</p>

  <p>Once at home Hermione held little Ph&oelig;nix long to her heart and wept
  over him. For the sake of her dead husband&rsquo;s child, if for naught else,
  how could she suffer them to give her to Democrates? That the orator had
  destroyed Glaucon in black malice had become a corner-stone in her belief.
  She could at first give for it only a woman&rsquo;s reason&mdash;blind
  intuition. She could not discuss her conviction with her mother or with any
  save a strange confidant&mdash;Phormio.</p>

  <p>She had met the fishmonger in the Agora once when she went with the slaves
  to buy a mackerel. The auctioneer had astonished everybody by knocking down
  to her a noble fish an obol under price, then under pretext of showing her a
  rare B&oelig;otian eel got her aside into his booth and whispered a few words
  that made the red and white come and go from her cheeks, after which the
  lady&rsquo;s hand went quickly to her purse, and she spoke quick words about
  &ldquo;the evening&rdquo; and &ldquo;the garden gate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Phormio refused the drachma brusquely, but kept the tryst. Cleopis had the
  key to the garden, and would contrive anything for her
  mistress&mdash;especially as all Athens knew Phormio was harmless save with
  his tongue. That evening for the first time Hermione heard the true story of
  Glaucon&rsquo;s escape by the <i>Solon</i>, but when the fishmonger paused
  she hung down her head closer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You saved him, then? I bless you. But was the sea more merciful
  than the executioner?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The fishmonger let his voice fall lower.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Democrates is unhappy. Something weighs on his mind. He is
  afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bias his slave came to see me again last night. Many of his
  master&rsquo;s doings have been strange to him. Many are riddles still, but
  one thing at last is plain. Hiram has been to see Democrates once more,
  despite the previous threats. Bias listened. He could not understand
  everything, but he heard Lycon&rsquo;s name passed many times, then one thing
  he caught clearly. &lsquo;<i>The Babylonish carpet-seller was the Prince
  Mardonius.</i>&rsquo; &lsquo;The Babylonian fled on the <i>Solon</i>.&rsquo;
  &lsquo;The Prince is safe in Sardis.&rsquo; If Mardonius could escape the
  storm and wreck, why not Glaucon, a king among swimmers?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hermione clapped her hands to her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t torture me. I&rsquo;ve long since trodden out hope. Why
  has he sent me no word in all these months of pain?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is not the easiest thing to get a letter across the Ægean in
  these days of roaring war.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I dare not believe it. What else did Bias hear?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very little. Hiram was urging something. Democrates always said,
  &lsquo;Impossible.&rsquo; Hiram went away with a very sour grin. However,
  Democrates caught Bias lurking.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And flogged him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Bias ran into the street and cried out he would flee to the
  Temple of Theseus, the slave&rsquo;s sanctuary, and demand that the archon
  sell him to a kinder master. Then suddenly Democrates forgave him and gave
  him five drachmæ to say no more about it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And so Bias at once told you?&rdquo; Hermione could not forbear a
  smile, but her gesture was of desperation. &ldquo;O Father Zeus&mdash;only
  the testimony of a slave to lean on, I a weak woman and Democrates one of the
  chief men in Athens! O for strength to wring out all the bitter
  truth!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace, <i>kyria</i>,&rdquo; said Phormio, not ungently,
  &ldquo;Aletheia, Mistress Truth, is a patient dame, but she says her word at
  last. And you see that hope is not quite dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I dare not cherish it. If I were but a man!&rdquo; repeated
  Hermione. But she thanked Phormio many times, would not let him refuse her
  money, and bade him come often again and bring her all the Agora gossip about
  the war. &ldquo;For we are friends,&rdquo; she concluded; &ldquo;you and I
  are the only persons who hold Glaucon innocent in all the world. And is that
  not tie enough?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So Phormio came frequently, glad perhaps to escape the discipline of his
  spouse. Now he brought a rumour of Xerxes&rsquo;s progress, now a bit of
  Bias&rsquo;s tattling about his master. The talebearing counted for little,
  but went to make Hermione&rsquo;s conviction like adamant. Every night she
  would speak over Ph&oelig;nix as she held him whilst he slept.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Grow fast, <i>makaire</i>, grow strong, for there is work for you
  to do! Your father cries, &lsquo;Avenge me well,&rsquo; even from
  Hades.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">After the departure of the fleet Athens seemed silent as the
  grave. On the streets one met only slaves and graybeards. In the Agora the
  hucksters&rsquo; booths were silent, but little groups of white-headed men
  sat in the shaded porticos and watched eagerly for the appearing of the
  archon before the government house to read the last despatch of the progress
  of Xerxes. The Pnyx was deserted. The gymnasia were closed. The more
  superstitious scanned the heavens for a lucky or unlucky flight of hawks. The
  priestesses sang litanies all day and all night on the Acropolis where the
  great altar to Athena smoked with victims continually. At last, after the
  days of uncertainty and wavering rumour, came surer tidings of battles.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Leonidas is fighting at Thermopylæ. The fleets are fighting at
  Artemisium, off Eub&oelig;a. The first onsets of the Barbarians have failed,
  but nothing is decided.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This was the substance, and tantalizingly meagre. And the strong army of
  Sparta and her allies still tarried at the Isthmus instead of hasting to aid
  the pitiful handful at Thermopylæ. Therefore the old men wagged their heads,
  the altars were loaded with victims, and the women wept over their
  children.</p>

  <p>So ended the first day after news came of the fighting. The second was
  like it&mdash;only more tense. Hermione never knew that snail called time to
  creep more slowly. Never had she chafed more against the iron custom which
  commanded Athenian gentlewomen to keep, tortoise-like, at home in days of
  distress and tumult. On the evening of the second day came once more the
  dusty courier. Leonidas was holding the gate of Hellas. The Barbarians had
  perished by thousands. At Artemisium, Themistocles and the allied Greek
  admirals were making head against the Persian armadas. But still nothing was
  decided. Still the Spartan host lingered at the Isthmus, and Leonidas must
  fight his battle alone. The sun sank that night with tens of thousands
  wishing his car might stand fast. At gray dawn Athens was awake and watching.
  Men forgot to eat, forgot to drink. One food would have
  contented&mdash;news!</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was about noon&mdash;&ldquo;the end of market
  time,&rdquo; had there been any market then at Athens&mdash;when Hermione
  knew by instinct that news had come from the battle and that it was evil. She
  and her mother had sat since dawn by the upper window, craning forth their
  heads up the street toward the Agora, where they knew all couriers must
  hasten. Along the street in all the houses other women were peering forth
  also. When little Ph&oelig;nix cried in his cradle, his mother for the first
  time in his life almost angrily bade him be silent. Cleopis, the only one of
  the fluttering servants who went placidly about the wonted tasks, vainly
  coaxed her young mistress with figs and a little wine. Hermippus was at the
  council. The street, save for the leaning heads of the women, was deserted.
  Then suddenly came a change.</p>

  <p>First a man ran toward the Agora, panting,&mdash;his himation blew from
  his shoulders, he never stopped to recover it. Next shouts, scattered in the
  beginning, then louder, and coming not as a roar but as a wailing, rising,
  falling like the billows of the howling sea,&mdash;as if the thousands in the
  market-place groaned in sore agony. Shrill and hideous they rose, and a hand
  of ice fell on the hearts of the listening women. Then more runners, until
  the street seemed alive by magic, slaves and old men all crowding to the
  Agora. And still the shout and ever more dreadful. The women leaned from the
  windows and cried vainly to the trampling crowd below.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell us! In the name of Athena, tell us!&rdquo; No answer for long,
  till at last a runner came not toward the Agora but from it. They had hardly
  need to hear what he was calling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Leonidas is slain. Thermopylæ is turned! Xerxes is
  advancing!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hermione staggered back from the lattice. In the cradle Ph&oelig;nix
  awoke; seeing his mother bending over him, he crowed cheerily and flung his
  chubby fists in her face. She caught him up and again could not fight the
  tears away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon! Glaucon!&rdquo; she prayed,&mdash;for her husband was all
  but a deity in her sight,&mdash;&ldquo;hear us wherever you are, even if in
  the blessed land of Rhadamanthus. Take us thither, your child and me, for
  there is no peace or shelter left on earth!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then, seeing her panic-stricken women flying hither and thither like
  witless birds, her patrician blood asserted itself. She dashed the drops from
  her eyes and joined her mother in quieting the maids. Whatever there was to
  hope or fear, their fate would not be lightened by wild moaning. Soon the
  direful wailing from the Agora ceased. A blue flag waved over the Council
  House, a sign that the &ldquo;Five Hundred&rdquo; had been called in hurried
  session. Simultaneously a dense column of smoke leaped up from the
  market-place. The archons had ordered the hucksters&rsquo; booths to be
  burned, as a signal to all Attica that the worst had befallen.</p>

  <p>After inexpressibly long waiting Phormio came, then Hermippus, to tell all
  they knew. Leonidas had perished gloriously. His name was with the immortals,
  but the mountain wall of Hellas had been unlocked. No Spartan army was in
  B&oelig;otia. The bravest of Athens were in the fleet. The easy Attic passes
  of Phyle and Decelea could never be defended. Nothing could save Athens from
  Xerxes. The calamity had been foreseen, but to foresee is not to realize.
  That night in Athens no man slept.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>XXIV. -- THE EVACUATION OF ATHENS</h2>

  <p class="first">It had come at last,&mdash;the hour wise men had dreaded,
  fools had scoffed at, cowards had dared not face. The Barbarian was within
  five days&rsquo; march of Attica. The Athenians must bow the knee to the
  world monarch or go forth exiles from their country.</p>

  <p>In the morning after the night of terror came another courier, not this
  time from Thermopylæ. He bore a letter from Themistocles, who was returning
  from Eub&oelig;a with the whole allied Grecian fleet. The reading of the
  letter in the Agora was the first rift in the cloud above the city.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be strong, prove yourselves sons of Athens. Do what a year ago you
  so boldly voted. Prepare to evacuate Attica. All is not lost. In three days I
  will be with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was no time for an assembly at the Pnyx, but the Five Hundred and
  the Areopagus council acted for the people. It was ordered to remove the
  entire population of Attica, with all their movable goods, across the bay to
  Salamis or to the friendly Peloponnesus, and that same noon the heralds went
  over the land to bear the direful summons.</p>

  <p>To Hermione, who in the calm after-years looked back on all this year of
  agony and stress as on an unreal thing, one time always was stamped on memory
  as no dream, but vivid, unforgetable,&mdash;these days of the great
  evacuation. Up and down the pleasant plain country of the Mesogia to
  southward, to the rolling highlands beyond Pentelicus and Parnes, to the
  slumbering villages by Marathon, to the fertile farm-land by Eleusis, went
  the proclaimers of ill-tidings.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quit your homes, hasten to Athens, take with you what you can, but
  hasten, or stay as Xerxes&rsquo;s slaves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For the next two days a piteous multitude was passing through the city. A
  country of four hundred thousand inhabitants was to be swept clean and left
  naked and profitless to the invader. Under Hermione&rsquo;s window, as she
  gazed up and down the street, jostled the army of fugitives, women old and
  young, shrinking from the bustle and uproar, grandsires on their staves, boys
  driving the bleating goats or the patient donkeys piled high with pots and
  panniers, little girls tearfully hugging a pet puppy or hen. But few strong
  men were seen, for the fleet had not yet rounded Sunium to bear the people
  away.</p>

  <p>The well-loved villas and farmsteads were tenantless. They left the
  standing grain, the ripening orchards, the groves of the sacred olives. Men
  rushed for the last time to the shrines where their fathers had
  prayed,&mdash;the temples of Theseus, Olympian Zeus, Dionysus, Aphrodite. The
  tombs of the worthies of old, stretching out along the Sacred Way to Eleusis,
  where Solon, Clisthenes, Miltiades, and many another bulwark of Athens slept,
  had the last votive wreath hung lovingly upon them. And especially men sought
  the great temple of the &ldquo;Rock,&rdquo; to lift their hands to Athena
  Polias, and vow awful vows of how harm to the Virgin Goddess should be wiped
  away in blood.</p>

  <p>So the throng passed through the city and toward the shore, awaiting the
  fleet.</p>

  <p>It came after eager watching. The whole fighting force of Athens and her
  Corinthian, Æginetan, and other allies. Before the rest raced a stately ship,
  the <i>Nausicaä</i>, her triple-oar bank flying faster than the spray. The
  people crowded to the water&rsquo;s edge when the great trireme cast off her
  pinnace and a well-known figure stepped therein.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Themistocles is with us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He landed at Phaleron, the thousands greeted him as if he were a god. He
  seemed their only hope&mdash;the Atlas upbearing all the fates of Athens.
  With the glance of his eye, with a few quick words, he chased the terrors
  from the strategi and archons that crowded up around him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why distressed? Have we not held the Barbarians back nobly at
  Artemisium? Will we not soon sweep his power from the seas in fair
  battle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With almost a conqueror&rsquo;s train he swept up to the city. A last
  assembly filled the Pnyx. Themistocles had never been more hopeful, more
  eloquent. With one voice men voted never to bend the knee to the king. If the
  gods forbade them to win back their own dear country, they would go together
  to Italy, to found a new and better Athens far from the Persian&rsquo;s
  power. And at Themistocles&rsquo;s motion they voted to recall all the
  political exiles, especially Themistocles&rsquo;s own great enemy Aristeides
  the Just, banished by the son of Neocles only a few years before. The
  assembly dispersed&mdash;not weeping but with cheers. Already it was time to
  be quitting the city. Couriers told how the Tartar horsemen were burning the
  villages beyond Parnes. The magistrates and admirals went to the house of
  Athena. The last incense smoked before the image. The bucklers hanging on the
  temple wall were taken down by Cimon and the other young patricians. The
  statue was reverently lifted, wound in fine linen, and borne swiftly to the
  fleet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come, <i>makaira</i>!&rdquo; called Hermippus, entering his house
  to summon his daughter. Hermione sent a last glance around the disordered
  aula; her mother called to the bevy of pallid, whimpering maids. Cleopis was
  bearing Ph&oelig;nix, but Hermione took him from her. Only his own mother
  should bear him now. They went through the thinning Agora and took one hard
  look at each familiar building and temple. When they should return to them,
  the inscrutable god kept hid. So to Peiræus,&mdash;and to the rapid pinnaces
  which bore them across the narrow sea to Salamis, where for the moment at
  least was peace.</p>

  <p>All that day the boats were bearing the people, and late into the night,
  until the task was accomplished, the like whereof is not found in history. No
  Athenian who willed was left to the power of Xerxes. One brain and voice
  planned and directed all. Leonidas, Ajax of the Hellenes, had been taken.
  Themistocles, their Odysseus, valiant as Ajax and gifted with the craft of
  the immortals, remained. Could that craft and that valour turn back the might
  of even the god-king of the Aryans?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25"></a>XXV. -- THE ACROPOLIS FLAMES</h2>

  <p class="first">A few days only Xerxes and his host rested after the dear-
  bought triumph at Thermopylæ. An expedition sent to plunder Delphi returned
  discomfited&mdash;thanks, said common report, to Apollo himself, who broke
  off two mountain crags to crush the impious invaders. But no such miracle
  halted the march on Athens. B&oelig;otia and her cities welcomed the king;
  Thespiæ and Platæa, which had stood fast for Hellas, were burned. The
  Peloponnesian army lingered at Corinth, busy with a wall across the Isthmus,
  instead of risking valorous battle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the soul of my father,&rdquo; the king had sworn, &ldquo;I
  believe that after the lesson at Thermopylæ these madmen will not fight
  again!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By land they will not,&rdquo; said Mardonius, always at his
  lord&rsquo;s elbow, &ldquo;by sea&mdash;it remains for your Eternity to
  discover.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will they really dare to fight by sea?&rdquo; asked Xerxes, hardly
  pleased at the suggestion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Omnipotence, you have slain Leonidas, but a second great enemy
  remains. While Themistocles lives, it is likely your slaves will have another
  opportunity to prove to you their devotion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! A stubborn rogue, I hear. Well&mdash;if we must fight by
  sea, it shall be under my own eyes. My loyal Ph&oelig;nician and Egyptian
  mariners did not do themselves full justice at Artemisium; they lacked the
  valour which comes from being in the presence of their king.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which makes a dutiful subject fight as ten,&rdquo; quickly added
  Pharnaspes the fan-bearer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; smiled the monarch, &ldquo;and now I must ask
  again, Mardonius, how fares it with my handsome Prexaspes?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only indifferently, your Majesty, since you graciously deign to
  inquire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Such a sad wound? That is heavy news. He takes long in recovering.
  I trust he wants for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, Omnipotence. He has the best surgeons in the
  camp.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-day I will send him Helbon wine from my own table. I miss his
  comely face about me. I want him here to play at dice. Tell him to recover
  because his king desires it. If he has become right Persian, that will be
  better than any physic.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no doubt he will be deeply moved to learn of your
  Eternity&rsquo;s kindness,&rdquo; rejoined the bow-bearer, who was not sorry
  that further discussion of this delicate subject was averted by the
  arch-usher introducing certain cavalry officers with their report on the most
  practicable line of march through B&oelig;otia.</p>

  <p>Glaucon, in fact, was long since out of danger, thanks to the sturdy
  bronze of his Laconian helmet. He was able to walk, and, if need be, ride,
  but Mardonius would not suffer him to go outside his own tents. The Athenian
  would be certain to be recognized, and at once Xerxes would send for him, and
  how Glaucon, in his new frame of mind, would deport himself before majesty,
  whether he would not taunt the irascible monarch to his face, the bow-bearer
  did not know. Therefore the Athenian endured a manner of captivity in the
  tents with the eunuchs, pages, and women. Artazostra was often with him, and
  less frequently Roxana. But the Egyptian had lost all power over him now. He
  treated her with a cold courtesy more painful than contempt. Once or twice
  Artazostra had tried to turn him back from his purpose, but her words always
  broke themselves over one barrier.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am born a Hellene, lady. My gods are not yours. I must live and
  die after the manner of my people. And that our gods are strong and will give
  victory, after that morning with Leonidas I dare not doubt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When the host advanced south and eastward from Thermopylæ, Glaucon went
  with it, riding in a closed travelling carriage guarded by Mardonius&rsquo;s
  eunuchs. All who saw it said that here went one of the bow-bearer&rsquo;s
  harem women, and as for the king, every day he asked for his favourite, and
  every day Mardonius told him, &ldquo;He is even as before,&rdquo; an answer
  which the bow-bearer prayed to truth-loving Mithra might not be accounted a
  lie.</p>

  <p>It was while the army lay at Platæa that news came which might have shaken
  Glaucon&rsquo;s purpose, had that purpose been shakable. Euboulus the
  Corinthian had been slain in a skirmish shortly after the forcing of
  Thermopylæ. The tidings meant that no one lived who could tell in Athens that
  on the day of testing the outlaw had cast in his lot with Hellas. Leonidas
  was dead. The Spartan soldiers who had heard Glaucon avow his identity were
  dead. In the hurried conference of captains preceding the retreat, Leonidas
  had told his informant&rsquo;s precise name only to Euboulus. And now
  Euboulus was slain, doubtless before any word from him of Glaucon&rsquo;s
  deed could spread abroad. To Athenians Glaucon was still the
  &ldquo;Traitor,&rdquo; doubly execrated in this hour of trial. If he returned
  to his people, would he not be torn in pieces by the mob? But the young
  Alcmæonid was resolved. Since he had not died at Thermopylæ, no life in the
  camp of the Barbarian was tolerable. He would trust sovran Athena who had
  plucked him out of one death to deliver from a second. Therefore he nursed
  his strength&mdash;a caged lion waiting for freedom,&mdash;and almost wished
  the Persian host would advance more swiftly that he might haste onward to his
  own.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Glaucon had cherished a hope to see the whole power of the
  Peloponnesus in array in B&oelig;otia, but that hope proved quickly vain. The
  oracle was truly to be fulfilled,&mdash;the whole of &ldquo;the land of
  Cecrops&rdquo; was to be possessed by the Barbarian. The mountain passes were
  open. No arrows greeted the Persian vanguard as it cantered down the defiles,
  and once more the king&rsquo;s courtiers told their smiling master that not
  another hand would be raised against him.</p>

  <p>The fourth month after quitting the Hellespont Xerxes entered Athens. The
  gates stood ajar. The invaders walked in silent streets as of a city of the
  dead. A few runaway slaves alone greeted them. Only in the Acropolis a
  handful of superstitious old men and temple warders had barricaded
  themselves, trusting that Athena would still defend her holy mountain. For a
  few days they defended the steep, rolling down huge boulders, but the end was
  inevitable. The Persians discovered a secret path upward. The defenders were
  surprised and dashed themselves from the crags or were massacred. A Median
  spear-man flung a fire-brand. The house of the guardian goddess went up in
  flame. The red column leaping to heaven was a beacon for leagues around that
  Xerxes held the length and breadth of Attica.</p>

  <p>Glaucon watched the burning temple with grinding teeth. Mardonius&rsquo;s
  tents were pitched in the eastern city by the fountain of Callirhoë,&mdash;a
  spot of fond memories for the Alcmæonid. Here first he had met Hermione, come
  with her maids to draw water, and had gone away dreaming of Aphrodite arising
  from the sea. Often here he had sat with Democrates by the little pool,
  whilst the cypresses above talked their sweet, monotonous music. Before him
  rose the Rock of Athena,&mdash;the same, yet not the same. The temple of his
  fathers was vanishing in smoke and ashes. What wonder that he turned to
  Artazostra at his side with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lady, your people have their will. But do not think Athena
  Nikephorus, the Lady of Triumphs, will forget this day when we stand against
  you in battle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She did not answer him. He knew that many noblemen had advised Xerxes
  against driving the Greeks to desperation by this sacrilege, but this fact
  hardly made him the happier.</p>

  <p>At dusk the next evening Mardonius suffered him to go with two faithful
  eunuchs and rove through the deserted city. The Persians were mostly encamped
  without the walls, and plundering was forbidden. Only Hydarnes with the
  Immortals pitched on Areopagus, and the king had taken his abode by the
  Agora. It was like walking through the country of the dead. Everything
  familiar, everything changed. The eunuchs carried torches. They wandered down
  one street after another, where the house doors stood open, where the aulas
  were strewn with the débris of household stuff which the fleeing citizens had
  abandoned. A deserter had already told Glaucon of his father&rsquo;s death;
  he was not amazed therefore to find the house of his birth empty and
  desolate. But everywhere else, also, it was to call back memories of glad
  days never to return. Here was the school where crusty Pollicharmes had
  driven the &ldquo;reading, writing, and music&rdquo; into Democrates and
  himself between the blows. Here was the corner Hermes, before which he had
  sacrificed the day he won his first wreath in the public games. Here was the
  house of Cimon, in whose dining room he had enjoyed many a bright symposium.
  He trod the Agora and walked under the porticos where he had lounged in the
  golden evenings after the brisk stroll from the wrestling ground at
  Cynosarges, and had chatted and chaffered with light-hearted friends about
  &ldquo;the war&rdquo; and &ldquo;the king,&rdquo; in the days when the
  Persian seemed very far away. Last of all an instinct&mdash;he could not call
  it desire&mdash;drove him to seek the house of Hermippus.</p>

  <p>They had to force the door open with a stone. The first red torch-light
  that glimmered around the aula told that the Eumolpid had awaited the enemy
  in Athens, not in Eleusis. The court was littered with all manner of
  stuff,&mdash;crockery, blankets, tables, stools,&mdash;which the late
  inhabitants had been forced to forsake. A tame quail hopped from the tripod
  by the now cold hearth. Glaucon held out his hand, the bird came quickly,
  expecting the bit of grain. Had not Hermione possessed such a quail? The
  outlaw&rsquo;s blood ran quicker. He felt the heat glowing in his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>A chest of clothes stood open by the entrance. He dragged forth the
  contents&mdash;women&rsquo;s dresses and uppermost a white airy gauze of
  Amorgos that clung to his hands as if he were lifting clouds. Out of its
  folds fell a pair of white shoes with clasps of gold. Then he recognized this
  dress Hermione had worn in the Panathenæa and on the night of his ruin. He
  threw it down, next stood staring over it like a man possessed. The friendly
  eunuchs watched his strange movements. He could not endure to have them
  follow him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give me a torch. I return in a moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He went up the stair alone to the upper story, to the chambers of the
  women. Confusion here also,&mdash;the more valuable possessions gone, but
  much remaining. In one corner stood the loom and stretched upon it the
  half-made web of a shawl. He could trace the pattern clearly wrought in
  bright wools,&mdash;Ariadne sitting desolate awaiting the returning of
  Theseus. Would the wife or the betrothed of Democrates busy herself with
  <i>that</i>, whatever the griefs in her heart? Glaucon&rsquo;s temples now
  were throbbing as if to burst.</p>

  <p>A second room, and more littered confusion, but in one corner stood a
  bronze statue,&mdash;Apollo bending his bow against the Achæans,&mdash;which
  Glaucon had given to Hermione. At the foot of the statue hung a wreath of
  purple asters, dead and dry, but he plucked it asunder and set many blossoms
  in his breast.</p>

  <p>A third room, and almost empty. He was moving back in disappointment, when
  the torch-light shook over something that swung betwixt two beams,&mdash;a
  wicker cradle. The woollen swaddling bands were still in it. One could see
  the spot on the little pillow with the impress of the tiny head. Glaucon
  almost dropped the torch. He pressed his hand to his brow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Zeus pity me!&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;preserve my reason. How can
  I serve Hellas and those I love if thou strikest me mad?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With feverish anxiety he sent his eyes around that chamber. His search was
  not in vain. He almost trampled upon the thing that lay at his feet,&mdash;a
  wooden rattle, the toy older than the Egyptian pyramids. He seized it, shook
  it as a warrior his sword. He scanned it eagerly. Upon the handle were
  letters carved, but there was a mist before his eyes which took long to pass
  away. Then he read the rude inscription: &ldquo;F????? : ???S :
  G????????S.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ph&oelig;nix the son of Glaucon.&rdquo; <i>His</i>
  child. He was the father of a fair son. His wife, he was sure thereof, had
  not yet been given to Democrates.</p>

  <p>Overcome by a thousand emotions, he flung himself upon a chest and pressed
  the homely toy many times to his lips.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">After a long interval he recovered himself enough to go down
  to the eunuchs, who were misdoubting his long absence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Persian,&rdquo; he said to Mardonius, when he was again at the
  bow-bearer&rsquo;s tents, &ldquo;either suffer me to go back to my people
  right soon or put me to death. My wife has borne me a son. My place is where
  I can defend him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mardonius frowned, but nodded his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know I desire it otherwise. But my word is given. And the word
  of a prince of the Aryans is not to be recalled. You know what to expect
  among your people&mdash;perhaps a foul death for a deed of
  another.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know it. I also know that Hellas needs me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To fight against us?&rdquo; asked the bow-bearer, with a sigh.
  &ldquo;Yet you shall go. Eran is not so weak that adding one more to her
  enemies will halt her triumph. To-morrow night a boat shall be ready on the
  strand. Take it. And after that may your gods guard you, for I can do no
  more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All the next day Glaucon sat in the tents and watched the smoke cloud
  above the Acropolis and the soldiers in the plain hewing down the sacred
  olives, Athena&rsquo;s trees, which no Athenian might injure and thereafter
  live. But Glaucon was past cursing now,&mdash;endure a little longer and
  after that, what vengeance!</p>

  <p>The gossiping eunuchs told readily what the king had determined. Xerxes
  was at Phaleron reviewing his fleet. The Hellenes&rsquo; ships confronted him
  at Salamis. The Persians had met in council, deliberating one night over
  their wine, reconsidering the next morning when sober. Their wisdom each time
  had been to force a battle. Let the king destroy the enemy at Salamis, and he
  could land troops at ease at the very doors of Sparta, defying the vain wall
  across the Isthmus. Was not victory certain? Had he not two ships to the
  Hellenes&rsquo; one? So the Ph&oelig;nician vassal kings and all his admirals
  assured him. Only Artemisia, the martial queen of Halicarnassus, spoke
  otherwise, but none would hear her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow the war is ended,&rdquo; a cup-bearer had told a butler
  in Glaucon&rsquo;s hearing, and never noticed how the Athenian took a
  horseshoe in his slim fingers and straightened it, whilst looking on the
  scorched columns of the Acropolis.</p>

  <p>At length the sun spread his last gold of the evening. The eunuchs called
  Glaucon to the pavilion of Artazostra, who came forth with Roxana for their
  farewell. They were in royal purple. The amethysts in their hair were worth a
  month&rsquo;s revenues of Corinth. Roxana had never been lovelier. Glaucon
  was again in the simple Greek dress, but he knelt and kissed the robes of
  both the women. Then rising he spoke to them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To you, O princess, my benefactress, I wish all manner of blessing.
  May you be crowned with happy age, may your fame surpass Semiramis, the
  conqueror queen of the fables, let the gods refuse only one prayer&mdash;the
  conquest of Hellas. The rest of the world is yours, leave then to us our
  own.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you, sister of Mardonius,&rdquo; he turned to Roxana now,
  &ldquo;do not think I despise your love or your beauty. That I have given you
  pain, is double pain to me. But I loved you only in a dream. My life is not
  for the rose valleys of Bactria, but for the stony hills by Athens. May
  Aphrodite give you another love, a brighter fortune than might ever come by
  linking your fate to mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They held out their hands. He kissed them. He saw tears on the long lashes
  of Roxana.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; spoke the women, simply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; he answered. He turned from them. He knew they
  were re-entering the tent. He never saw the women again.</p>

  <p>Mardonius accompanied him all the long way from the fount of Callirhoë to
  the sea-shore. Glaucon protested, but the bow-bearer would not hearken.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have saved my life, Athenian,&rdquo; was his answer,
  &ldquo;when you leave me now, it is forever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The moon was lifting above the gloomy mass of Hymettus and scattering all
  the Attic plain with her pale gold. The Acropolis Rock loomed high above
  them. Glaucon, looking upward, saw the moonlight flash on the spear point and
  shield of a soldier,&mdash;a Barbarian standing sentry on the ruined shrine
  of the Virgin Goddess. Once more the Alcmæonid was leaving Athens, but with
  very different thoughts than on that other night when he had fled at
  Phormio&rsquo;s side. They quitted the desolate city and the sleeping camp.
  The last bars of day had long since dimmed in the west when before them
  loomed the hill of Munychia clustered also with tents, and beyond it the
  violet-black vista of the sea. A forest of masts crowded the havens, the
  fleet of the &ldquo;Lord of the World&rdquo; that was to complete his mastery
  with the returning sun. Mardonius did not lead Glaucon to the ports, but
  southward, where beyond the little point of Colias spread an open sandy
  beach. The night waves lapped softly. The wind had sunk to warm puffs from
  the southward. They heard the rattle of anchor-chains and tackle-blocks, but
  from far away. Beyond the vague promontory of Peiræus rose dark mountains and
  headlands, at their foot lay a sprinkling of lights.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Salamis!&rdquo; cried Glaucon, pointing. &ldquo;Yonder are the
  ships of Hellas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mardonius walked with him upon the shelving shore. A skiff, small but
  stanch, was ready with oars.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What else will you?&rdquo; asked the bow-bearer.
  &ldquo;Gold?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing. Yet take this.&rdquo; Glaucon unclasped from his waist the
  golden belt Xerxes had bestowed at Sardis. &ldquo;A Hellene I went forth, a
  Hellene I return.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He made to kiss the Persian&rsquo;s dress, but Mardonius would not suffer
  it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did I not desire you for my brother?&rdquo; he said, and they
  embraced. As their arms parted, the bow-bearer spoke three words in earnest
  whisper:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beware of Democrates.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can say no more. Yet be wise. Beware of Democrates.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The attendants, faithful body-servants of Mardonius, and mute witnesses of
  all that passed, were thrusting the skiff into the water. There were no long
  farewells. Both knew that the parting was absolute, that Glaucon might be
  dead on the morrow. A last clasping of the hands and quickly the boat was
  drifting out upon the heaving waters. Glaucon stood one moment watching the
  figures on the beach and pondering on Mardonius&rsquo;s strange warning. Then
  he set himself to the oars, rowing westward, skirting the Barbarian fleet as
  it rode at anchor, observing its numbers and array and how it was aligned for
  battle. After that, with more rapid stroke, he sent the skiff across the dark
  ribbon toward Salamis.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26"></a>XXVI. -- THEMISTOCLES IS THINKING</h2>

  <p class="first">Leonidas was taken. Themistocles was left,&mdash;left to
  bear as crushing a load as ever weighed on man,&mdash;to fight two battles,
  one with the Persian, one with his own unheroic allies, and the last was the
  harder. Three hundred and seventy Greek triremes rode off Salamis, half from
  Athens, but the commander-in-chief was Eurybiades of Sparta, the sluggard
  state that sent only sixteen ships, yet the only state the bickering
  Peloponnesians would obey. Hence Themistocles&rsquo;s sore problems.</p>

  <p>Different from the man of unruffled brow who ruled from the bema was he
  who paced the state cabin of the <i>Nausicaä</i> a few nights after the
  evacuation. For <i>he</i> at least knew the morn would bring Hellas her doom.
  There had been a gloomy council that afternoon. They had seen the Acropolis
  flame two days before. The great fleet of Xerxes rode off the Attic havens.
  At the gathering of the Greek chiefs in Eurybiades&rsquo;s cabin Themistocles
  had spoken one word many times,&mdash;&ldquo;Fight!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To which Adeimantus, the craven admiral of Corinth, and many another had
  answered:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Delay! Back to the Isthmus! Risk nothing!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then at last the son of Neocles silenced them, not with arguments but
  threats. &ldquo;Either here in the narrow straits we can fight the king or
  not at all. In the open seas his numbers can crush us. Either vote to fight
  here or we Athenians sail for Italy and leave you to stem Xerxes as you
  can.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There had been sullen silence after that, the admirals misliking the
  furrow drawn above Themistocles&rsquo;s eyes. Then Eurybiades had haltingly
  given orders for battle.</p>

  <p>That had been the command, but as the Athenian left the Spartan flag-ship
  in his pinnace he heard Globryas, the admiral of Sicyon, muttering,
  &ldquo;Headstrong fool&mdash;he shall not destroy us!&rdquo; and saw
  Adeimantus turn back for a word in Eurybiades&rsquo;s ear. The Spartan had
  shaken his head, but Themistocles did not deceive himself. In the battle at
  morn half of the Hellenes would go to battle asking more &ldquo;how
  escape?&rdquo; than &ldquo;how conquer?&rdquo; and that was no question to
  ask before a victory.</p>

  <p>The cabin was empty now save for the admiral. On the deck above the hearty
  shouts of Ameinias the trierarch, and chanting of the seamen told that on the
  <i>Nausicaä</i> at least there would be no slackness in the fight. The ship
  was being stripped for action, needless spars and sails sent ashore, extra
  oars made ready, and grappling-irons placed. &ldquo;Battle&rdquo; was what
  every Athenian prayed for, but amongst the allies Themistocles knew it was
  otherwise. The crucial hour of his life found him nervous, moody, silent. He
  repelled the zealous subalterns who came for orders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My directions have been given. Execute them. Has Aristeides come
  yet?&rdquo; The last question was to Simonides, who had been half-companion,
  half-counsellor, in all these days of storm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is not yet come from Ægina.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Leave me, then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles&rsquo;s frown deepened. The others went out.</p>

  <p>The state cabin was elegant, considering its place. Themistocles had
  furnished it according to his luxurious taste,&mdash;stanchions cased in
  bronze hammered work, heavy rugs from Carthage, lamps swinging from chains of
  precious Corinthian brass. Behind a tripod stood an image of Aphrodite of
  Fair Counsel, the admiral&rsquo;s favourite deity. By force of habit now he
  crossed the cabin, took the golden box, and shook a few grains of
  frankincense upon the tripod.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Attend, O queen,&rdquo; he said mechanically, &ldquo;and be thou
  propitious to all my prayers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He knew the words meant nothing. The puff of night air from the port-hole
  carried the fragrance from the room. The image wore its unchanging,
  meaningless smile, and Themistocles smiled too, albeit bitterly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So this is the end. A losing fight, cowardice, slavery&mdash;no, I
  shall not live to see that last.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked from the port-hole. He could see the lights of the Barbarian
  fleet clearly. He took long breaths of the clear brine.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So the tragedy ends&mdash;worse than Phrynicus&rsquo;s poorest,
  when they pelted his chorus from the orchestra with date-stones. And
  yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He never formulated what came next even in his own mind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Eu!</i>&rdquo; he cried, springing back with part of his old
  lightness, &ldquo;I have borne a brave front before it all. I have looked the
  Cyclops in the face, even when he glowered the fiercest. But it all will
  pass. I presume Thersytes the caitiff and Agamemnon the king have the same
  sleep and the same dreams in Orchus. And a few years more or a few less in a
  man&rsquo;s life make little matter. But it would be sweeter to go out
  thinking &lsquo;I have triumphed&rsquo; than &lsquo;I have failed, and all
  the things I loved fail with me.&rsquo; And Athens&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again he stopped. When he resumed his monologue, it was in a different
  key.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are many things I cannot understand. They cannot unlock the
  riddles at Delphi, no seer can read them in the omens of birds. Why was
  Glaucon blasted? Was he a traitor? What was the truth concerning his treason?
  Since his going I have lost half my faith in mortal men.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Once more his thoughts wandered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How they trust me, my followers of Athens! Is it not better to be a
  leader of one city of freemen than a Xerxes, master of a hundred million
  slaves? How they greeted me, as if I were Apollo the Saviour, when I returned
  to Peiræus! And must it be written by the chroniclers thereafter,
  &lsquo;About this time Themistocles, son of Neocles, aroused the Athenians to
  hopeless resistance and drew on them utter destruction&rsquo;? O Father Zeus,
  must men say <i>that</i>? Am I a fool or crazed for wishing to save my land
  from the fate of Media, Lydia, Babylonia, Egypt, Ionia? Has dark Atropos
  decreed that the Persians should conquer forever? Then, O Zeus, or whatever
  be thy name, O Power of Powers, look to thine empire! Xerxes is not a king,
  but a god; he will besiege Olympus, even thy throne.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He crossed the cabin with hard strides.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How can I?&rdquo; he cried half-aloud, beating his forehead.
  &ldquo;How can I make these Hellenes fight?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His hand tightened over his sword-hilt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is the only place where we can fight to advantage. Here in the
  strait betwixt Salamis and Attica we have space to deploy all our ships,
  while the Barbarians will be crowded by numbers. And if we once
  retreat?&mdash;Let Adeimantus and the rest prate about&mdash;&lsquo;The wall,
  the wall across the Isthmus! The king can never storm it.&rsquo; Nor will he
  try to, unless his councillors are turned stark mad. Will he not have command
  of the sea? can he not land his army behind the wall, wherever he wills? Have
  I not dinned that argument in those doltish Peloponnesians&rsquo; ears until
  I have grown hoarse? Earth and gods! suffer me rather to convince a stone
  statue than a Dorian. The task is less hard. Yet they call themselves
  reasoning beings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A knock upon the cabin door. Simonides reëntered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You do not come on deck, Themistocles? The men ask for you.
  Ameinias&rsquo;s cook has prepared a noble supper&mdash;anchovies and
  tunny&mdash;will you not join the other officers and drink a cup to Tyche,
  Lady Fortune, that she prosper us in the morning?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am at odds with Tyche, Simonides. I cannot come with
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The case is bad, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, bad. But keep a brave face before the men. There&rsquo;s no
  call to pawn our last chance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has it come to that?&rdquo; quoth the little poet, in curiosity and
  concern.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Leave me!&rdquo; ordered Themistocles, with a sweep of the hand,
  and Simonides was wise enough to obey.</p>

  <p>Themistocles took a pen from the table, but instead of writing on the
  outspread sheet of papyrus, thrust the reed between his teeth and bit it
  fiercely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How can I? How can I make these Hellenes fight? Tell that, King
  Zeus, tell that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then quickly his eager brain ran from expedient to expedient.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Another oracle, some lucky prediction that we shall conquer? But I
  have shaken the oracle books till there is only chaff in them. Or a bribe to
  Adeimantus and his fellows? But gold can buy only souls, not courage. Or
  another brave speech and convincing argument? Had I the tongue of Nestor and
  the wisdom of Thales, would those doltish Dorians listen?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again the knock, still again Simonides. The dapper poet&rsquo;s face was a
  cubit long.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, grief to report it! Cimon sends a boat from his ship the
  <i>Perseus</i>. He says the <i>Dike</i>, the Sicyonian ship beside him, is
  not stripping for battle, but rigging sail on her spars as if to flee
  away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Themistocles, calmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And there is also a message that Adeimantus and many other admirals
  who are minded like him have gone again to Eurybiades to urge him not to
  fight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I expected it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will the Spartan yield?&rdquo; The little poet was whitening.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very likely. Eurybiades would be a coward if he were not too much
  of a fool.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you are not going to him instantly, to confound the faint
  hearts and urge them to quit themselves like Hellenes?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the dog of Egypt, man,&rdquo; cried Simonides, seizing his
  friend&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know that if nothing&rsquo;s done,
  we&rsquo;ll all walk the asphodel to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course. I am doing all I can.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All? You stand with folded hands!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All&mdash;for I am thinking.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thinking&mdash;oh, make actions of your thoughts!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When the god opens the way. Just now the way is fast
  closed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ai!</i> woe&mdash;and it is already far into the evening, and
  Hellas is lost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles laughed almost lightly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, my friend. Hellas will not be lost until to-morrow morning, and
  much can happen in a night. Now go, and let me think yet more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Simonides lingered. He was not sure Themistocles was master of himself.
  But the admiral beckoned peremptorily, the poet&rsquo;s hand was on the cabin
  door, when a loud knock sounded on the other side. The <i>proreus</i>,
  commander of the fore-deck and Ameinas&rsquo;s chief lieutenant, entered and
  saluted swiftly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your business?&rdquo; questioned the admiral, sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May it please your Excellency, a deserter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A deserter, and how and why here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He came to the <i>Nausicaä</i> in a skiff. He swears he has just
  come from the Barbarians at Phaleron. He demands to see the
  admiral.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is a Barbarian?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, a Greek. He affects to speak a kind of Doric
  dialect.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles laughed again, and even more lightly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A deserter, you say. Then why, by Athena&rsquo;s owls, has he left
  &lsquo;the Land of Roast Hare&rsquo; among the Persians, whither so many are
  betaking themselves? We&rsquo;ve not so many deserters to our cause that
  to-night we can ignore one. Fetch him in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But the council with Eurybiades?&rdquo; implored Simonides, almost
  on his knees.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the harpies with it! I asked Zeus for an omen. It comes&mdash;a
  fair one. There is time to hear this deserter, to confound Adeimantus, and to
  save Hellas too!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles tossed his head. The wavering, the doubting frown was gone.
  He was himself again. What he hoped for, what device lay in that
  inexhaustible brain of his, Simonides did not know. But the sight itself of
  this strong, smiling man gave courage. The officer reëntered, with him a
  young man, his face in part concealed by a thick beard and a peaked cap drawn
  low upon his forehead. The stranger came boldly across to Themistocles, spoke
  a few words, whereat the admiral instantly bade the officer to quit the
  cabin.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27"></a>XXVII. -- THE CRAFT OF ODYSSEUS</h2>

  <p class="first">The stranger drew back the shaggy cap. Simonides and
  Themistocles saw a young, well-formed man. With his thick beard and the
  flickering cabin lamps it was impossible to discover more. The newcomer stood
  silent as if awaiting remark from the others, and they in turn looked on
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; spoke the admiral, at length, &ldquo;who are you? Why
  are you here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You do not know me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not in the least, and my memory is good. But your speech now is
  Attic, not Doric as they told me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It may well be Attic, I am Athenian born.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Athenian? And still to me a stranger? Ah! an instant. Your voice is
  familiar. Where have I heard it before?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The last time,&rdquo; rejoined the stranger, his tones rising,
  &ldquo;it was a certain night at Colonus. Democrates and Hermippus were with
  you&mdash;likewise&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles leaped back three steps.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The sea gives up its dead. You are Glaucon son of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Conon,&rdquo; completed the fugitive, folding his arms calmly, but
  the admiral was not so calm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miserable youth! What harpy, what evil god has brought you hither?
  What prevents that I give you over to the crew to crucify at the
  foremast?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing hinders! nothing&rdquo;&mdash;Glaucon&rsquo;s voice mounted
  to shrillness&mdash;&ldquo;save that Athens and Hellas need all their sons
  this night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A loyal son you have been!&rdquo; darted Themistocles, his lips
  curling. &ldquo;Where did you escape the sea?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was washed on Astypalæa.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where have you been since?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In Sardis.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who protected you there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mardonius.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did the Persians treat you so shabbily that you were glad to desert
  them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They loaded me with riches and honour. Xerxes showered me with
  benefits.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you accompanied their army to Hellas? You went with the other
  Greek renegades&mdash;the sons of Hippias and the rest?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon&rsquo;s brow grew very red, but he met Themistocles&rsquo;s
  arrowlike gaze.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did&mdash;and yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes&mdash;the &lsquo;yet,&rsquo; &rdquo; observed Themistocles,
  sarcastically. &ldquo;I had expected it. Well, I can imagine many motives for
  coming,&mdash;to betray our hopes to the Persians, or even because Athena has
  put some contrite manhood in your heart. You know, of course, that the
  resolution we passed recalling the exiles did not extend pardon to
  traitors.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles flung himself into a chair. The admiral was in a rare
  condition for him,&mdash;truly at a loss to divine the best word and
  question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sit also, Simonides,&rdquo; his order, &ldquo;and you, once
  Alcmæonid and now outlaw, tell why, after these confessions, I should believe
  any other part of your story?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not ask you to believe,&rdquo;&mdash;Glaucon stood like a
  statue,&mdash;&ldquo;I shall not blame you if you do the worst,&mdash;yet you
  shall hear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The admiral made an impatient gesture, commanding &ldquo;Begin,&rdquo; and
  the fugitive poured out his tale. All the voyage from Phaleron he had been
  nerving himself for this ordeal; his composure did not desert now. He related
  lucidly, briefly, how the fates had dealt with him since he fled Colonus.
  Only when he told of his abiding with Leonidas Themistocles&rsquo;s gaze grew
  sharper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell that again. Be careful. I am very good at detecting
  lies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon repeated unfalteringly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What proof that you were with Leonidas?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None but my word. Euboulus of Corinth and the Spartans alone knew
  my name. They are dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! And you expect me to accept the boast of a traitor with a
  price upon his head?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You said you were good at detecting lies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles&rsquo;s head went down between his hands; at last he lifted
  it and gazed the deserter in the face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, son of Conon, do you still persist that you are innocent? Do
  you repeat those oaths you swore at Colonus?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All. I did not write that letter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who did, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A malignant god, I said. I will say it again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gods take human agencies to ruin a man in these days, even Hermes
  the Trickster. Again I say, who wrote that letter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Athena knows.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And unfortunately her Ladyship the Goddess will not tell,&rdquo;
  cried the admiral, blasphemously. &ldquo;Let us fall back on easier
  questions. Did I write it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Absurd.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did Democrates?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Absurd again, still&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you not see, dearest outlaw,&rdquo; said Themistocles, mildly,
  &ldquo;until you can lay that letter on some other man&rsquo;s shoulders, I
  cannot answer, &lsquo;I believe you&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not ask that. I have a simpler request. Will you let me serve
  Hellas?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do I know you are not a spy sent from Mardonius?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because too many deserters and talebearers are flying to Xerxes now
  to require that I thrust my head in the Hydra&rsquo;s jaws. You know surely
  that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s truth said there, Simonides. What do you
  think?&rdquo; The last question was to the poet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That this Glaucon, whatever his guilt a year ago, comes to-night in
  good faith.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Euge!</i> that&rsquo;s easily said. But what if he betrays us
  again?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I understand aright,&rdquo; spoke Simonides, shrewdly,
  &ldquo;our case is such there&rsquo;s little left worth betraying.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not badly put,&rdquo;&mdash;again Themistocles pressed his
  forehead, while Glaucon stood as passive as hard marble. Then the admiral
  suddenly began to rain questions like an arrow volley.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You come from the king&rsquo;s camp?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And have heard the plans of battle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was not at the council, but nothing is concealed. The Persians
  are too confident.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course. How do their ships lie?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Crowded around the havens of Athens. The vassal Ionians have their
  ships on the left. The Ph&oelig;nicians, Xerxes&rsquo;s chief hope, lie on
  the right, but on the extreme right anchor the Egyptians.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you know this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From the camp-followers&rsquo; talk. Then, too, I rowed by the
  whole armada while on my way to Salamis. I have eyes. The moon was shining. I
  was not mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know where rides the trireme of Ariabignes, Xerxes&rsquo;s
  admiral-in-chief?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Off the entrance to Peiræus. It is easy to find her. She is covered
  with lights.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! and the Egyptian squadron is on the extreme right and closest
  to Salamis?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very close.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If they went up the coast as far as the promontory on Mt. Ægaleos,
  the strait toward Eleusis would be closed?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And on the south the way is already blocked by the
  Ionians.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had trouble in passing even in my skiff.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>More questions, Glaucon not knowing whither they all were drifting.
  Without warning Themistocles uprose and smote his thigh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you are anxious to serve Hellas?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have I not said it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dare you die for her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I made the choice once with Leonidas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dare you do a thing which, if it slip, may give you into the hands
  of the Barbarians to be torn by wild horses or of the Greeks to be
  crucified?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But it shall not slip!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Euge!</i> that is a noble answer. Now let us come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whither?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Eurybiades&rsquo;s flag-ship. Then I can know whether you must
  risk the deed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles touched a bronze gong; a marine adjutant entered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My pinnace,&rdquo; ordered the admiral. As the man went out,
  Themistocles took a long himation from the locker and wrapped it around the
  newcomer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Since even Simonides and I did not recognize you in your long
  beard, I doubt if you are in danger of detection to-night. But remember your
  name is Critias. You can dye your hair if you come safe back from this
  adventure. Have you eaten?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who has hunger now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So say all of us. But if the gifts of Demeter cannot strengthen, it
  is not so with those of Dionysus. Drink.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took from a hook a leathern bottle and poured out a hornful of hot
  Chian. Glaucon did not refuse. After he had finished the admiral did
  likewise. Then Glaucon in turn asked questions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is my wife?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the town of Salamis, with her father; do you know she has
  borne&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A son. Are both well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well. The child is fair as the son of Leto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They could see the light flash out of the eyes of the outlaw. He turned
  toward the statue and stretched out his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Aphrodite, I bless thee!&rdquo; Then again to the admiral,
  &ldquo;And Hermione is not yet given to Democrates in marriage?&rdquo; The
  words came swiftly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not yet. Hermippus desires it. Hermione resists. She calls
  Democrates your destroyer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon turned away his face that they might not behold it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The god has not yet forgotten mercy,&rdquo; Simonides thought he
  heard him say.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The pinnace is waiting, <i>kyrie</i>,&rdquo; announced the orderly
  from the companionway.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let the deserter&rsquo;s skiff be towed behind,&rdquo; ordered
  Themistocles, once on deck, &ldquo;and let Sicinnus also go with
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The keen-eyed Asiatic took his place with Themistocles and Glaucon in the
  stern. The sturdy boatmen sent the pinnace dancing. All through the brief
  voyage the admiral was at whispers with Sicinnus. As they reached the Spartan
  flag-ship, half a score of pinnaces trailing behind told how the
  Peloponnesian admirals were already aboard clamouring at Eurybiades for
  orders to fly. From the ports of the stern-cabin the glare of many lamps
  spread wavering bars of light across the water. Voices came, upraised in
  jarring debate. The marine guard saluted with his spear as Themistocles went
  up the ladder. Leaving his companions on deck, the admiral hastened below. An
  instant later he was back and beckoned the Asiatic and the outlaw to the
  ship&rsquo;s rail.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take Sicinnus to the Persian high admiral,&rdquo; was his ominous
  whisper, &ldquo;and fail not,&mdash;fail not, for I say to you except the god
  prosper you now, not all Olympus can save our Hellas to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Not another word as he turned again to the cabin. The pinnace crew had
  brought the skiff alongside, Sicinnus entered it, Glaucon took the oars,
  pulled out a little, as if back to the <i>Nausicaä</i>, then sent the head of
  the skiff around, pointing across the strait, toward the havens of Athens.
  Sicinnus sat in silence, but Glaucon guessed the errand. The wind was rising
  and bringing clouds. This would hide the moon and lessen the danger. But
  above all things speed was needful. The athlete put his strength upon the
  oars till the heavy skiff shot across the black void of the water.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was little short of midnight when Glaucon swung the skiff
  away from the tall trireme of Ariabignes, the Barbarian&rsquo;s admiral. The
  deed was done. He had sat in the bobbing boat while Sicinnus had been above
  with the Persian chiefs. Officers who had exchanged the wine-cup with Glaucon
  in the days when he stood at Xerxes&rsquo;s side passed through the glare of
  the battle lanterns swaying above the rail. The Athenian had gripped at the
  dagger in his belt as he watched them. Better in the instant of discovery to
  slay one&rsquo;s self than die a few hours afterward by slow tortures! But
  discovery had not come. Sicinnus had come down the ladder, smiling, jesting,
  a dozen subalterns salaaming as he went, and offering all manner of service,
  for had he not been a bearer of great good tidings to the king?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Till to-morrow,&rdquo; an olive-skinned Cilician navarch had
  spoken.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Till to-morrow,&rdquo; waved the messenger, lightly. He did all
  things coolly, as if he had been bearing an invitation to a feast, took his
  post in the stern of the skiff deliberately, then turned to the silent man
  with him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pull.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whither?&rdquo; Glaucon was already tugging the oars.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Eurybiades&rsquo;s ship. Themistocles is waiting. And again all
  speed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The line of twinkling water betwixt the skiff and the Persian widened. For
  a few moments Glaucon bent himself silently to his task, then for the first
  time questioned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Even in the darkness he knew Sicinnus grinned and showed his teeth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the name of Themistocles I have told the Barbarian chiefs that
  the Hellenes are at strife one with another, that they are meditating a hasty
  flight, that if the king&rsquo;s captains will but move their ships so as to
  enclose them, it is likely there will be no battle in the morning, but the
  Hellenes will fall into the hands of Xerxes unresisting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the Persian answered?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That I and my master would not fail of reward for this service to
  the king. That the Egyptian ships would be swung at once across the strait to
  cut off all flight by the Hellenes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The outlaw made no answer, but pulled at the oars. The reaction from the
  day and evening of strain and peril was upon him. He was unutterably weary,
  though more in mind than in body. The clumsy skiff seemed only to crawl.
  Trusting the orders of Sicinnus to steer him aright, he closed his eyes. One
  picture after another of his old life came up before him now he was in the
  stadium at Corinth and facing the giant Spartan, now he stood by Hermione on
  the sacred Rock at Athens, now he was at Xerxes&rsquo;s side with the fleets
  and the myriads passing before them at the Hellespont, he saw his wife, he
  saw Roxana, and all other things fair and lovely that had crossed his life.
  Had he made the best choice? Were the desperate fates of Hellas better than
  the flower-banked streams of Bactria, whose delights he had forever thrust
  by? Would his Fortune, guider of every human destiny, bring him at last to a
  calm haven, or would his life go out amid the crashing ships to-morrow? The
  oars bumped on the thole-pins. He pulled mechanically, the revery ever
  deepening, then a sharp hail awoke him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O-op! What do you here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The call was in Ph&oelig;nician. Glaucon scarce knew the harsh Semitic
  speech, but the <i>lembos</i>, a many-oared patrol cutter, was nearly on
  them. A moment more, and seizure would be followed by identification. Life,
  death, Hellas, Hermione, all flashed before his eyes as he sat numbed, but
  Sicinnus saved them both.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The password to-night? You know it,&rdquo; he demanded in quick
  whisper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Hystaspes,&rsquo; &rdquo; muttered Glaucon, still
  wool-gathering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are you? Why here?&rdquo; An officer in the cutter was rising
  and upholding an unmasked lantern. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been ordered to cruise
  in the channel and snap up deserters, and by Baal, here are twain! The crows
  will pick at your eyes to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sicinnus stood upright in the skiff.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fool,&rdquo; he answered in good Sidonian, &ldquo;dare you halt the
  king&rsquo;s privy messenger? It is not <i>our</i> heads that the crows will
  find the soonest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The cutter was close beside them, but the officer dropped his lantern.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good, then. Give the password.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Hystaspes.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

  <p>They could see the Ph&oelig;nician&rsquo;s hand rise to his head in
  salute.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forgive my rudeness, worthy sir. It&rsquo;s truly needless to seek
  deserters to-night with the Hellenes&rsquo; affairs so desperate, yet we must
  obey his Eternity&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I pardon you,&rdquo; quoth the emissary, loftily, &ldquo;I will
  commend your vigilance to the admiral.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May Moloch give your Lordship ten thousand children,&rdquo; called
  back the mollified Semite.</p>

  <p>The crew of the cutter dropped their blades into the water. The boats
  glided apart. Not till there was a safe stretch betwixt them did Glaucon
  begin to grow hot, then cold, then hot again. Chill Thanatos had passed and
  missed by a hair&rsquo;s breadth. Again the bumping of the oars and the slow,
  slow creeping over the water. The night was darkening. The clouds had hid the
  moon and all her stars. Sicinnus, shrewd and weatherwise, remarked,
  &ldquo;There will be a stiff wind in the morning,&rdquo; and lapsed into
  silence. Glaucon toiled on resolutely. A fixed conviction was taking
  possession of his mind,&mdash;one that had come on the day he had been
  preserved at Thermopylæ, now deepened by the event just passed,&mdash;that he
  was being reserved by the god for some crowning service to Hellas, after
  which should come peace, whether the peace of a warrior who dies in the arms
  of victory, whether the peace of a life spent after a deed well done, he
  scarcely knew, and in the meantime, if the storms must beat and the waves
  rise up against him, he would bear them still. Like the hero of his race, he
  could say, &ldquo;Already have I suffered much and much have I toiled in
  perils of waves and war, let this be added to the tale of those.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bump&mdash;bump, the oars played their monotonous music on the thole-pins.
  Sicinnus stirred on his seat. He was peering northward anxiously, and Glaucon
  knew what he was seeking. Through the void of the night their straining eyes
  saw masses gliding across the face of the water. Ariabignes was making his
  promise good. Yonder the Egyptian fleet were swinging forth to close the last
  retreat of the Hellenes. Thus on the north, and southward, too, other
  triremes were thrusting out, bearing&mdash;both watchers wisely
  guessed&mdash;a force to disembark on Psyttaleia, the islet betwixt Salamis
  and the main, a vantage-point in the coming battle.</p>

  <p>The coming battle? It was so silent, ghostlike, far away, imagination
  scarce could picture it. Was this black slumberous water to be the scene at
  dawn of a combat beside which that of Hector and Achilles under Troy would be
  only as a tale that is told? And was he, Glaucon, son of Conon the Alcmæonid,
  sitting there in the skiff alone with Sicinnus, to have a part therein, in a
  battle the fame whereof should ring through the ages? Bump, bump&mdash;still
  the monologue of the oars. A fish near by leaped from the water, splashing
  loudly. Then for an instant the clouds broke. Selene uncovered her face. The
  silvery flash quickly come, more quickly flying, showed him the headlands of
  that Attica now in Xerxes&rsquo;s hands. He saw Pentelicus and Hymettus,
  Parnes and Cithæron, the hills he had wandered over in glad boyhood, the
  hills where rested his ancestors&rsquo; dust. It was no dream. He felt his
  warm blood quicken. He felt the round-bowed skiff spring over the waves, as
  with unwearied hands he tugged at the oar. There are moments when the dullest
  mind grows prophetic, and the mind of the Athenian was not dull. The
  moonlight had vanished. In its place through the magic darkness seemed
  gathering all the heroes of his people beckoning him and his compeers onward.
  Perseus was there, and Theseus and Erechtheus, Heracles the Mighty, and
  Odysseus the Patient, whose intellect Themistocles possessed, Solon the Wise,
  Periander the Crafty, Diomedes the Undaunted, men of reality, men of fable,
  sages, warriors, demigods, crowding together, speaking one message: &ldquo;Be
  strong, for the heritage of what you do this coming day shall be passed
  beyond children&rsquo;s children, shall be passed down to peoples to whom the
  tongue, the gods, yea, the name of Hellas, are but as a dream.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon felt the weariness fly from him. He was refreshed as never by
  wine. Then through the void in place of the band of heroes slowly outspread
  the tracery of a vessel at anchor,&mdash;the outermost guardship of the fleet
  of the Hellenes. They were again amongst friends. The watcher on the trireme
  was keeping himself awake after the manner of sentries by singing. In the
  night-stillness the catch from Archilochus rang lustily.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;By my spear I have won my bread,<br>
  By spear won my clear, red wine,<br>
  On my spear I will lean and drink,&mdash;<br>
  Show me a merrier life than is mine!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>The trolling called Glaucon back to reality. Guided by Sicinnus, who knew
  the stations of the Greek fleet better than he, a second time they came
  beside the Spartan admiral. The lamps were still burning in the stern-cabin.
  Even before they were alongside, they caught the clamours of fierce
  debate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Still arguing?&rdquo; quoth Sicinnus to the yawning marine officer
  who advanced to greet them as they reached the top of the ladder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Still arguing,&rdquo; grunted the Spartan. &ldquo;I think your
  master has dragged forth all his old arguments and invented a thousand new
  ones. He talks continuously, as if battling for time, though only Castor
  knows wherefore. There&rsquo;s surely a majority against him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The emissary descended the companionway, Themistocles leaped up from his
  seat in the crowded council. A few whispers, the Asiatic returned to Glaucon
  on the deck. The two gazed down the companionway, observing everything. They
  had not long to wait.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28"></a>XXVIII. -- BEFORE THE DEATH GRAPPLE</h2>

  <p class="first">For the fourth time the subaltern who stood at
  Eurybiades&rsquo;s elbow turned the water-glass that marked the passing of
  the hours. The lamps in the low-ceiled cabin were flickering dimly. Men
  glared on one another across the narrow table with drawn and heated faces.
  Adeimantus of Corinth was rising to reply to the last appeal of the
  Athenian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have had enough, Eurybiades, of Themistocles&rsquo;s wordy
  folly. Because the Athenian admiral is resolved to lead all Hellas to
  destruction, is no reason that we should follow. As for his threat that he
  will desert us with his ships if we refuse to fight, I fling it in his face
  that he dare not make it good. Why go all over the well-threshed straw again?
  Is not the fleet of the king overwhelming? Were we not saved by a miracle
  from overthrow at Artemisium? Do not the scouts tell us the Persians are
  advancing beyond Eleusis toward Megara and the Isthmus? Is not our best
  fighting blood here in the fleet? Then if the Isthmus is threatened, our
  business is to defend it and save the Peloponnesus, the last remnant of
  Hellas unconquered. Now then, headstrong son of Neocles, answer
  that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Corinthian, a tall domineering man, threw back his shoulders like a
  boxer awaiting battle. Themistocles did not answer, but only smiled up at him
  from his seat opposite.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have silenced you, grinning babbler, at last,&rdquo; thundered
  Adeimantus, &ldquo;and I demand of you, O Eurybiades, that we end this
  tedious debate. If we are to retreat, let us retreat. A vote, I say, a
  vote!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Eurybiades rose at the head of the table. He was a heavy, florid
  individual with more than the average Spartan&rsquo;s slowness of tongue and
  intellect. Physically he was no coward, but he dreaded responsibility.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Much has been said,&rdquo; he announced ponderously, &ldquo;many
  opinions offered. It would seem the majority of the council favour the
  decision to retire forthwith. Has Themistocles anything more to say why the
  vote should not be taken?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; rejoined the Athenian, with an equanimity that made
  Adeimantus snap his teeth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will therefore take the vote city by city,&rdquo; went on
  Eurybiades. &ldquo;Do you, Phlegon of Seriphos, give your vote.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Seriphos&mdash;wretched islet&mdash;sent only one ship, but thanks to the
  Greek mania for &ldquo;equality&rdquo; Phlegon&rsquo;s vote had equal weight
  with that of Themistocles.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Salamis is not defensible,&rdquo; announced the Seriphian, shortly.
  &ldquo;Retreat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you, Charmides of Melos?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Retreat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you, Phoibodas of Tr&oelig;zene?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Retreat, by all the gods.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you, Hippocrates of Ægina?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay and fight. If you go back to the Isthmus, Ægina must be
  abandoned to the Barbarians. I am with Themistocles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Record his vote,&rdquo; shouted Adeimantus, ill-naturedly,
  &ldquo;he is but one against twenty. But I warn you, Eurybiades, do not call
  for Themistocles&rsquo;s vote, or the rest of us will be angry. The man whose
  city is under the power of the Barbarian has no vote in this council, however
  much we condescend to listen to his chatterings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Athenian sprang from his seat, his aspect as threatening as Apollo
  descending Olympus in wrath.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is my country, Adeimantus? Yonder!&rdquo; he pointed out the
  open port-hole, &ldquo;there rides the array of our Athenian ships. What
  other state in Hellas sends so many and sets better men within them? Athens
  still lives, though her Acropolis be wrapped in flames. &lsquo;Strong-hearted
  men and naught else are warp and woof of a city.&rsquo; Do you forget
  Alcæus&rsquo;s word so soon, O Boaster from Corinth? Yes, by Athena
  Promachos, Mistress of Battles, while those nine score ships ride on the
  deep, I have a city fairer, braver, than yours. And will you still deny me
  equal voice and vote with this noble trierarch from Siphinos with his one, or
  with his comrade from Melos with his twain?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles&rsquo;s voice rang like a trumpet. Adeimantus winced.
  Eurybiades broke in with soothing tones.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No one intends to deny your right to vote, Themistocles. The
  excellent Corinthian did but jest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fitting hour for jesting!&rdquo; muttered the Athenian, sinking
  back into his seat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The vote, the vote!&rdquo; urged the Sicyonian chief, from
  Adeimantus&rsquo;s elbow, and the voting went on. Of more than twenty voices
  only three&mdash;Themistocles&rsquo;s and those of the Æginetan and Megarian
  admirals&mdash;were in favour of abiding the onset. Yet even when Eurybiades
  arose to announce the decision, the son of Neocles sat with his hands
  sprawling on the table, his face set in an inscrutable smile as he looked on
  Adeimantus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is the plain opinion,&rdquo;&mdash;Eurybiades hemmed and hawed
  with his words,&mdash;&ldquo;the plain opinion, I say, of this council that
  the allied fleet retire at once to the Isthmus. Therefore, I, as
  admiral-in-chief, do order each commander to proceed to his own flag-ship and
  prepare his triremes to retire at dawn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well said,&rdquo; shouted Adeimantus, already on his feet;
  &ldquo;now to obey.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But with him rose Themistocles. He stood tall and calm, his thumbs thrust
  in his girdle. His smile was a little broader, his head held a little higher,
  than of wont.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Eurybiades, I grieve to blast the wisdom of all these valiant
  gentlemen, but they cannot retire if they wish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Explain!&rdquo; a dozen shouted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very simply. I have had good reason to know that the king has moved
  forward the western horn of his fleet, so as to enclose our anchorage at
  Salamis. It is impossible to retire save through the Persian line of
  battle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Perseus upholding the Gorgon&rsquo;s head before Polydectes&rsquo;s guests
  and turning them to stone wrought hardly more of a miracle than this calm
  announcement of Themistocles. Men stared at him vacantly, stunned by the
  tidings, then Adeimantus&rsquo;s frightened wrath broke loose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fox!(10) Was this your doing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[10 Equivalent to crying &ldquo;Hound!&rdquo; in
  English.]</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not ask you to thank me, <i>philotate</i>,&rdquo; was the
  easy answer. &ldquo;It is, however, urgent to consider whether you wish to be
  taken unresisting in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Corinthian shook his fist across the table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Liar, as a last device to ruin us, you invent this
  folly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is easy to see if I lie,&rdquo; rejoined Themistocles;
  &ldquo;send out a pinnace and note where the Persians anchor. It will not
  take long.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For an instant swords seemed about to leap from their scabbards, and the
  enraged Peloponnesians to sheathe them in the Athenian&rsquo;s breast. He
  stood unflinching, smiling, while a volley of curses flew over him. Then an
  orderly summoned him on deck, while Adeimantus and his fellows foamed and
  contended below. Under the battle lantern Themistocles saw a man who was his
  elder in years, rugged in feature, with massive forehead and wise gray eyes.
  This was Aristeides the Just, the admiral&rsquo;s enemy, but their feud had
  died when Xerxes drew near to Athens.</p>

  <p>Hands clasped heartily as the twain stood face to face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our rivalry forever more shall be a rivalry which of us can do most
  to profit Athens,&rdquo; spoke the returning exile; then Aristeides told how
  he had even now come from Ægina, how he had heard of the clamours to retreat,
  how retreat was impossible, for the Persians were pressing in. A laugh from
  Themistocles interrupted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My handiwork! Come to the council. They will not believe me, no,
  not my oath.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Aristeides told his story, and how his vessel to Salamis had scarce
  escaped the Egyptian triremes, and how by this time all entrance and exit was
  surely closed. But even now many an angry captain called him
  &ldquo;liar.&rdquo; The strife of words was at white heat when Eurybiades
  himself silenced the fiercest doubter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Captains of Hellas, a trireme of Teos has deserted from the
  Barbarian to us. Her navarch sends word that all is even as Themistocles and
  Aristeides tell. The Egyptians hold the passage to Eleusis. Infantry are
  disembarked on Psyttaleia. The Ph&oelig;nicians and Ionians enclose us on the
  eastern strait. We are hemmed in.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Once more the orderly turned the water-clock. It was past
  midnight. The clouds had blown apart before the rising wind. The debate must
  end. Eurybiades stood again to take the votes of the wearied, tense-strung
  men.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In view of the report of the Teans, what is your voice and
  vote?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Before all the rest up leaped Adeimantus. He was no craven at heart,
  though an evil genius had possessed him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have your will, Themistocles,&rdquo; he made the concession
  sullenly yet firmly, &ldquo;you have your will. May Poseidon prove you in the
  right. If it is battle or slavery at dawn, the choice is quick.
  Battle!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Battle!&rdquo; shouted the twenty, arising together, and Eurybiades
  had no need to declare the vote. The commanders scattered to their
  flag-ships, to give orders to be ready to fight at dawn. Themistocles went to
  his pinnace last. He walked proudly. He knew that whatever glory he might
  gain on the morrow, he could never win a fairer victory than he had won that
  night. When his barge came alongside, his boat crew knew that his eyes were
  dancing, that his whole mien was of a man in love with his fortune. Many
  times, as Glaucon sat beside him, he heard the son of Neocles repeating as in
  ecstasy:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They must fight. They must fight.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Glaucon sat mutely in the pinnace which had headed not for
  the <i>Nausicaä</i>, but toward the shore, where a few faint beacons were
  burning.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must confer with the strategi as to the morning,&rdquo;
  Themistocles declared after a long interval, at which Sicinnus broke in
  anxiously:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will not sleep, <i>kyrie</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sleep?&rdquo; laughed the admiral, as at an excellent jest,
  &ldquo;I have forgotten there was such a god as Hypnos.&rdquo; Then, ignoring
  Sicinnus, he addressed the outlaw.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am grateful to you, my friend,&rdquo; he did not call Glaucon by
  name before the others, &ldquo;you have saved me, and I have saved Hellas.
  You brought me a new plan when I seemed at the last resource. How can the son
  of Neocles reward you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give me a part to play to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thermopylæ was not brisk enough fighting, ha? Can you still fling a
  javelin?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can try.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Euge!</i> Try you shall.&rdquo; He let his voice drop. &ldquo;Do
  not forget your name henceforth is Critias. The <i>Nausicaä&rsquo;s</i> crew
  are mostly from Sunium and the Mesogia. They&rsquo;d hardly recognize you
  under that beard; still Sicinnus must alter you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Command me, <i>kyrie</i>,&rdquo; said the Asiatic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A strange time and place, but you must do it. Find some dark dye
  for this man&rsquo;s hair to-night, and at dawn have him aboard the
  flag-ship.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The thing can be done, <i>kyrie</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After that, lie down and sleep. Because Themistocles is awake, is
  no cause for others&rsquo; star-gazing. Sleep sound. Pray Apollo and
  Hephæstus to make your eye sure, your hand strong. Then awake to see the
  glory of Hellas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Confidence, yes, power came through the tones of the admiral&rsquo;s
  voice. Themistocles went away to the belated council. Sicinnus led his charge
  through the crooked streets of the town of Salamis. Sailors were sleeping in
  the open night, and they stumbled over them. At last they found a small
  tavern where a dozen shipmen sprawled on the earthen floor, and a gaping host
  was just quenching his last lamp. Sicinnus, however, seemed to know him.
  There was much protesting and headshaking, at last ended by the glint of a
  daric. The man grumbled, departed, returned after a tedious interval with a
  pot of ointment, found Hermes knew where. By a rush-candle&rsquo;s flicker
  Sicinnus applied the dark dye with a practised hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know the art well,&rdquo; observed the outlaw.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly; the agent of Themistocles must be a Proteus with his
  disguises.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sicinnus laid down his pot and brushes. They had no mirror, but Glaucon
  knew that he was transformed. The host got his daric. Again they went out
  into the night and forsaking the crowded town sought the seaside. The strand
  was broad, the sand soft and cool, the circling stars gave three hours yet of
  night, and they lay down to rest. The sea and the shore stretched away, a
  magic vista with a thousand mystic shapes springing out of the charmed
  darkness, made and unmade as overwrought fancy summoned them. As from an
  unreal world Glaucon&mdash;whilst he lay&mdash;saw the lights of the
  scattered ships, heard the clank of chains, the rattling of tacklings. Nature
  slept. Only man was waking.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;The mountain brows, the rocks, the peaks are
  sleeping,<br>
  Uplands and gorges hush!<br>
  The thousand moorland things are silence keeping,<br>
  The beasts under each bush<br>
  Crouch, and the hived bees<br>
  Rest in their honeyed ease;<br>
  In the purple sea fish lie as they were dead,<br>
  And each bird folds his wing over his head.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>The school-learned lines of Alcman, with a thousand other trivial things,
  swarmed back through the head of Glaucon the Alcmæonid. How much he had lived
  through that night, how much he would live through,&mdash;if indeed he was to
  live,&mdash;upon the morrow! The thought was benumbing in its greatness. His
  head swam with confused memories. Then at last all things dimmed. Once more
  he dreamed. He was with Hermione gathering red poppies on the hill above
  Eleusis. She had filled her basket full. He called to her to wait for him.
  She ran away. He chased, she fled with laughter and sparkling eyes. He could
  hear the wavings of her dress, the little cries she flung back over her
  shoulder. Then by the sacred well near the temple he caught her. He felt her
  struggling gayly. He felt her warm breath upon his face, her hair was
  touching his forehead. Rejoicing in his strength, he was bending her head
  toward his&mdash;but here he wakened. Sicinnus had disappeared. A bar of gray
  gold hung over the water in the east.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This was the day. <i>This was the day!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Some moments he lay trying to realize the fact in its full moment. A thin
  mist rested on the black water waiting to be dispelled by the sun. From afar
  came sounds not of seamen&rsquo;s trumpets, but horns, harps, kettledrums,
  from the hidden mainland across the strait, as of a host advancing along the
  shore. &ldquo;Xerxes goes down to the marge with his myriads,&rdquo; Glaucon
  told himself. &ldquo;Have not all his captains bowed and smiled, &lsquo;Your
  Eternity&rsquo;s victory is certain. Come and behold.&rsquo; &rdquo; But here
  the Athenian shut his teeth.</p>

  <p>People at length were passing up and down the strand. The coast was
  waking. The gray bar was becoming silver. Friends passed, deep in
  talk,&mdash;perchance for the last time. Glaucon lay still a moment longer,
  and as he rested caught a voice so familiar he felt all the blood surge to
  his forehead,&mdash;Democrates&rsquo;s voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I tell you, Hiram,&mdash;I told you before,&mdash;I have no part in
  the ordering of the fleet. Were I to interfere with ever so good a heart, it
  would only breed trouble for us all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So close were the twain, the orator&rsquo;s trailing chiton almost fell on
  Glaucon&rsquo;s face. The latter marvelled that his own heart did not spring
  from its prison in his breast, so fierce were its beatings.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If my Lord would go to Adeimantus and suggest,&rdquo;&mdash;the
  other&rsquo;s Greek came with a marked Oriental accent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Harpy! Adeimantus is no Medizer. He is pushed to bay now, and is
  sure to fight. Have you Barbarians no confidence? Has not the king two
  triremes to our one? Only fools can demand more. Tell Lycon, your master, I
  have long since done my uttermost to serve him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet remember, Excellency.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Begone, scoundrel. Don&rsquo;t threaten again. If I know your power
  over me, I can also promise you not to go down to Orchus alone, but take
  excellent pains to have fair company.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry to bear such tidings to Lycon, Excellency.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Away with you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do not raise your voice, <i>kyrie</i>,&rdquo; spoke Hiram, never
  more blandly, &ldquo;here is a man asleep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The hint sent Democrates from the spot almost on a run. Hiram disappeared
  in the opposite direction. Glaucon rose, shook the sand from his cloak, and
  stood an instant with his head whirling. The voice of his boyhood friend, of
  the man who had ruined him because of a suspicion of treason&mdash;and now
  deep in compromising talk with the agent of the chief of the peace party at
  Sparta! And wherefore had Mardonius spoken those mysterious words at their
  parting, &ldquo;Beware of Democrates&rdquo;? For an instant the problems
  evoked made him forget even the coming battle.</p>

  <p>A clear trumpet-blast down the strand gave a truce to questioning.
  Sicinnus reappeared, and led Glaucon to one of the great fires roaring on the
  beach, where the provident Greek sailors were breakfasting on barley porridge
  and meat broth before dining on spears and arrow-heads. A silent company, no
  laughter, no jesting. All knew another sun for them might never rise. Glaucon
  ate not because he hungered, but because duty ordered it. As the light
  strengthened, the strand grew alive with thousands of men at toil. The
  triremes drawn on shore went down into the sea on their rollers. More
  trumpet-blasts sent the rowers aboard their ships. But last of all, before
  thrusting out to do or die, the Greeks must feast their ears as well as their
  stomachs. On the sloping beach gathered the officers and the armoured
  marines,&mdash;eighteen from each trireme,&mdash;and heard one stirring
  harangue after another. The old feuds were forgotten. Adeimantus and
  Eurybiades both spoke bravely. The seers announced that every bird and cloud
  gave good omen. Prayer was offered to Ajax of Salamis that the hero should
  fight for his people. Last of all Themistocles spoke, and never to fairer
  purpose. No boasts, no lip courage, a painting of the noble and the base, the
  glory of dying as freemen, the infamy of existing as slaves. He told of
  Marathon, of Thermopylæ, and asked if Leonidas had died as died a fool. He
  drew tears. He drew vows of vengeance. He never drew applause. Men were too
  strained for that. At last he sent the thousands forth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go, then. Quit yourselves as Hellenes. That is all the task. And I
  say to you, in the after days this shall be your joy, to hear the greatest
  declare of you, &lsquo;Reverence this man, for he saved us all at
  Salamis.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

  <p>The company dispersed, each man to his ship. Themistocles went to his
  pinnace, and a cheer uprose from sea and land as the boat shot out to the
  <i>Nausicaä</i>. Eurybiades might be chief in name; who did not know that
  Themistocles was the surest bulwark of Hellas?</p>

  <p>The son of Neocles, standing in the boat, uplifted his face to the now
  golden east.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be witness, Helios,&rdquo; he cried aloud, &ldquo;be witness when
  thou comest, I have done all things possible. And do thou and thy fellow-gods
  on bright Olympus rule our battle now; the lot is in your hands!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29"></a>XXIX. -- SALAMIS</h2>

  <p class="first">Sunrise. The <i>Nausicaä</i> was ready. Ameinias the navarch
  walked the deck above the stern-cabin with nervous strides. All that human
  forethought could do to prepare the ship had long been done. The slim hull
  one hundred and fifty feet long had been stripped of every superfluous rope
  and spar. The masts had been lowered. On the cat-heads hung the anchors
  weighted with stone to fend off an enemy, astern towed the pinnace ready to
  drag alongside and break the force of the hostile ram. The heavy-armed
  marines stood with their long boarding spears, to lead an attack or cast off
  grappling-irons. But the true weapon of the <i>Nausicaä</i> was herself. To
  send the three-toothed beak through a foeman&rsquo;s side was the end of her
  being. To meet the shock of collision two heavy cables had been bound
  horizontally around the hull from stem to stern. The oarsmen,&mdash;the
  <i>thranites</i> of the upper tier, the <i>zygites</i> of the middle, the
  <i>thalamites</i> of the lower,&mdash;one hundred and seventy swart,
  nervous-eyed men, sat on their benches, and let their hands close tight upon
  those oars which trailed now in the drifting water, but which soon and
  eagerly should spring to life. At the belt of every oarsman dangled a sword,
  for boarders&rsquo; work was more than likely. Thirty spare rowers rested
  impatiently on the centre deck, ready to leap wherever needed. On the
  forecastle commanded the <i>proreus</i>, Ameinias&rsquo;s lieutenant, and
  with him the <i>keleustes</i>, the oar master who must give time on his
  sounding-board for the rowing, and never fail,&mdash;not though the ships
  around reeled down to watery grave. And finally on the poop by the captain
  stood the &ldquo;governor,&rdquo;&mdash;knotted, grizzled, and
  keen,&mdash;the man whose touch upon the heavy steering oars might give the
  <i>Nausicaä</i> life or destruction when the ships charged beak to beak.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The trireme is ready, admiral,&rdquo; reported Ameinias, as
  Themistocles came up leisurely from the stern-cabin.</p>

  <p>The son of Neocles threw back his helmet, that all might see his calm,
  untroubled face. He wore a cuirass of silvered scale-armour over his purple
  chiton. At his side walked a young man, whom the ship&rsquo;s people imagined
  the deserter of the preceding night, but he had drawn his helmet close.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is Critias,&rdquo; said Themistocles, briefly, to the navarch;
  &ldquo;he is a good caster. See that he has plenty of darts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One of Themistocles&rsquo;s secret agents,&rdquo; muttered the
  captain to the governor, &ldquo;we should have guessed it.&rdquo; And they
  all had other things to think of than the whence and wherefore of this
  stranger.</p>

  <p>It was a weary, nervous interval. Men had said everything, done
  everything, hoped and feared everything. They were in no mood even to invoke
  the gods. In desperation some jested riotously as they gripped the oars on
  the benches,&mdash;demonstrations which the <i>proreus</i> quelled with a
  loud &ldquo;Silence in the ship.&rdquo; The morning mist was breaking. A
  brisk wind was coming with the sun. Clear and strong sang the Notus, the
  breeze of the kindly south. It covered the blue bay with crisping whitecaps,
  it sent the surf foaming up along the Attic shore across the strait.
  Themistocles watched it all with silent eyes, but eyes that spoke of
  gladness. He knew the waves would beat with full force on the Persian prows,
  and make their swift movement difficult while the Greeks, taking the
  galloping surf astern, would suffer little.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Æolus fights for us. The first omen and a fair one.&rdquo; The word
  ran in whispers down the benches, and every soul on the trireme rejoiced.</p>

  <p>How long did they sit thus? An æon? Would Eurybiades never draw out his
  line of battle? Would Adeimantus prove craven at the end? Would treachery
  undo Hellas to-day, as once before at Lade when the Ionian Greeks had faced
  the Persian fleet in vain? Now as the vapour broke, men began to be able to
  look about them, and be delivered from their own thoughts. The shores of
  Salamis were alive,&mdash;old men, women, little children,&mdash;the
  fugitives from Attica were crowding to the marge in thousands to watch the
  deed that should decide their all. And many a bronze-cheeked oarsman arose
  from his bench to wave farewell to the wife or father or mother, and sank
  back again,&mdash;a clutching in his throat, a mist before his eyes, while
  his grip upon the oar grew like to steel.</p>

  <p>As the <i>Nausicaä</i> rode at her place in the long line of ships spread
  up and down the shore of Salamis, it was easy to detect forms if not faces on
  the strand. And Glaucon, peering out from his helmet bars, saw Democrates
  himself standing on the sands and beckoning to Themistocles. Then other
  figures became clear to him out of the many, this one or that whom he had
  loved and clasped hands with in the sunlit days gone by. And last of all he
  saw those his gaze hungered for the most, Hermippus, Lysistra, and another
  standing at their side all in white, and in her arms she bore something he
  knew must be her child,&mdash;Hermione&rsquo;s son, his son, born to the lot
  of a free man of Athens or a slave of Xerxes according as his elders played
  their part this day. Only a glimpse,&mdash;the throng of strangers opened to
  disclose them closed again; Glaucon leaned on a capstan. All the strength for
  the moment was gone out of him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You rowed and wrought too much last night, Critias,&rdquo; spoke
  Themistocles, who had eyes for everything. &ldquo;To the cabin, Sicinnus,
  bring a cup of Chian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No wine, for Athena&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; cried the outlaw, drawing
  himself together, &ldquo;it is passed. I am strong again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A great shout from the shores and the waiting fleet made him forget even
  the sight of Hermione.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They come! The Persians! The Persians!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The fleet of the Barbarians was advancing from the havens of Athens.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The sun rose higher. He was far above Hymettus now, and
  shooting his bright javelins over mainland, islands, and waters. With his
  rising the southern breeze sang ever clearer, making the narrow channel
  betwixt Salamis and Attica white, and tossing each trireme merrily. Not a
  cloud hung upon Pentelicus, Hymettus, or the purple northern range of Parnes.
  Over the desolate Acropolis hovered a thin mist,&mdash;smoke from the
  smouldering temple, the sight of which made every Attic sailor blink hard and
  think of the vengeance.</p>

  <p>Yonder on the shore of the mainland the host of the Persian was moving:
  horsemen in gilded panoply, Hydarnes&rsquo;s spearmen in armour like suns.
  They stood by myriads in glittering masses about a little spur of Mt.
  Ægaleos, where a holy close of Heracles looked out upon the sea. To them were
  coming more horsemen, chariots, litters, and across the strait drifted the
  thunderous acclamation, &ldquo;Victory to the king!&rdquo; For here on the
  ivory throne, with his mighty men, his captains, his harem, about him, the
  &ldquo;Lord of the World&rdquo; would look down on the battle and see how his
  slaves could fight.</p>

  <p>Now the Barbarians began to move forth by sea. From the havens of Peiræus
  and their anchorages along the shore swept their
  galleys,&mdash;Ph&oelig;nician, Cilician, Egyptian, and, sorrow of sorrows,
  Ionian&mdash;Greek arrayed against Greek! Six hundred triremes and more they
  were, taller in poop and prow than the Hellenes, and braver to look upon.</p>

  <p>Each vied with each in the splendour of the scarlet, purple, and gold upon
  stern and foreship. Their thousands of white oars moved like the onward march
  of an army as they trampled down the foam. From the masts of their many
  admirals flew innumerable gay signal-flags. The commands shouted through
  trumpets in a dozen strange tongues&mdash;the shrill pipings of the oar
  masters, the hoarse shouts of the rowers&mdash;went up to heaven in a
  clamorous babel. &ldquo;Swallows&rsquo; chatter,&rdquo; cried the deriding
  Hellenes, but hearts were beating quicker, breath was coming faster in many a
  breast by Salamis then,&mdash;and no shame. For now was the hour of trial,
  the wrestle of Olympian Zeus with Ahura-Mazda. Now would a mighty one speak
  from the heavens to Hellas, and say to her &ldquo;Die!&rdquo; or
  &ldquo;Be!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Barbarians&rsquo; armadas were forming. Their black beaks, all
  pointing toward Salamis, stretched in two bristling lines from the islet of
  Psyttaleia&mdash;whence the shields of the landing force glittered&mdash;to
  that brighter glitter on the promontory by Ægaleos where sat the king. To
  charge their array seemed charging a moving hedge of spears, impenetrable in
  defence, invincible in attack. Slowly, rocked by the sea and rowing in steady
  order, the armament approached Salamis. And still the Greek ships lay spread
  out along the shore, each trireme swinging at the end of the cable which
  moored her to the land, each mariner listening to the beatings of his own
  heart and straining his eyes on one ship
  now&mdash;Eurybiades&rsquo;s&mdash;which rode at the centre of their line and
  far ahead.</p>

  <p>All could read the order of battle at last as squadron lay against
  squadron. On the west, under Xerxes&rsquo;s own eye, the Athenians must
  charge the serried Ph&oelig;nicians, at the centre the Æginetans must face
  the Cilicians, on the east Adeimantus and his fellows from Peloponnese must
  make good against the vassal Ionians. But would the signal to row and strike
  never come? Had some god numbed Eurybiades&rsquo;s will? Was treachery doing
  its darkest work? With men so highly wrought moments were precious. The bow
  strung too long will lose power. And wherefore did Eurybiades tarry?</p>

  <p>Every soul in the <i>Nausicaä</i> kept his curses soft, and
  waited&mdash;waited till that trailing monster, the Persian fleet, had crept
  halfway from Psyttaleia toward them, then up the shrouds of the Spartan
  admiral leaped a flag. Eager hands drew it, yet it seemed mounting as a
  snail, till at the masthead the clear wind blew it wide,&mdash;a plain red
  banner, but as it spread hundreds of axes were hewing the cables that bound
  the triremes to the shore, every Greek oar was biting the sea, the ships were
  leaping away from Salamis. From the strand a shout went up, a prayer more
  than a cheer, mothers, wives, little ones, calling it together:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Zeus prosper you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A roar from the fleet, the tearing of countless blades on the thole-pins
  answered them. Eurybiades had spoken. There was no treason. All now was in
  the hand of the god.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Across the strait they went, and the Barbarians seemed
  springing to meet them. From the mainland a tumult of voices was rising, the
  myriads around Xerxes encouraging their comrades by sea to play the man. No
  indecisive, half-hearted battle should this be, as at Artemisium. Persian and
  Hellene knew that. The keen Ph&oelig;nicians, who had chafed at being kept
  from action so long, sent their line of ships sweeping over the waves with
  furious strokes. The grudges, the commercial rivalries between Greek and
  Sidonian, were old. No Persian was hotter for Xerxes&rsquo;s cause than his
  Ph&oelig;nician vassals that day.</p>

  <p>And as they charged, the foemen&rsquo;s lines seemed so dense, their ships
  so tall, their power so vast, that involuntarily hesitancy came over the
  Greeks. Their strokes slowed. The whole line lagged. Here an Æginetan galley
  dropped behind, yonder a Corinthian navarch suffered his men to back water.
  Even the <i>keleustes</i> of the <i>Nausicaä</i> slackened his beating on the
  sounding-board. Eurybiades&rsquo;s ship had drifted behind to the line of her
  sisters, as in defiance a towering Sidonian sprang ahead of the Barbarian
  line of battle, twenty trumpets from her poop and foreship asking,
  &ldquo;Dare you meet me?&rdquo; The Greek line became almost stationary. Some
  ships were backing water. It was a moment which, suffered to slip unchecked,
  leads to irreparable disaster. Then like a god sprang Themistocles upon the
  capstan on his poop. He had torn off his helmet. The crews of scores of
  triremes saw him. His voice was like Stentor&rsquo;s, the herald whose call
  was strong as fifty common men.</p>

  <p>In a lull amidst the howls of the Barbarians his call rang up and down the
  flagging ships:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;O Sons of Hellas! save your land,<br>
  Your children save, your altars and your wives!<br>
  Now dare and do, for ye have staked your all!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;Now dare and do, for ye have staked your all!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Navarch shouted it to navarch. The cry went up and down the line of the
  Hellenes, &ldquo;loud as when billows lash the beetling crags.&rdquo; The
  trailing oars beat again into the water, and even as the ships once more
  gained way, Themistocles nodded to Ameinias, and he to the <i>keleustes</i>.
  The master oarsman leaped from his seat and crashed his gavel down upon the
  sounding-board.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Aru! Aru! Aru!</i> Put it on, my men!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The <i>Nausicaä</i> answered with a leap. Men wrought at the oar butts,
  tugging like mad, their backs toward the foe, conscious only that duty bade
  them send the trireme across the waves as a stone whirls from the sling. Thus
  the men, but Themistocles, on the poop, standing at the captain&rsquo;s and
  governor&rsquo;s side, never took his gaze from the great Barbarian that
  leaped defiantly to meet them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can we risk the trick?&rdquo; his swift question to Ameinias.</p>

  <p>The captain nodded. &ldquo;With this crew&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Two stadia, one stadium, half a stadium, a ship&rsquo;s length, the
  triremes were charging prow to prow, rushing on a common death, when Ameinias
  clapped a whistle to his lips and blew shrilly. As one man every rower on the
  port-side leaped to his feet and dragged his oar inward through its row-hole.
  The deed was barely done ere the Sidonian was on them. They heard the roaring
  water round her prow, the cracking of the whips as the petty officers ran up
  and down the gangways urging on the panting cattle at the oars. Then almost
  at the shock the governor touched his steering oar. The
  <i>Nausicaä</i>swerved. The prow of the Sidonian rushed past them. A shower
  of darts pattered down on the deck of the Hellene, but a twinkling later from
  the Barbarians arose a frightful cry. Right across her triple oar bank, still
  in full speed, ploughed the Athenian. The Sidonian&rsquo;s oars were snapping
  like faggots. The luckless rowers were flung from their benches in heaps. In
  less time than the telling every oar on the Barbarian&rsquo;s port-side had
  been put out of play. The <i>diekplous</i>, favourite trick of the Grecian
  seamen, had never been done more fairly.</p>

  <p>Now was Themistocles&rsquo;s chance. He used it. There was no need for him
  to give orders to the oar master. Automatically every rower on the port-tiers
  of the <i>Nausicaä</i> had run out his blade again. The governor sent the
  head of the trireme around with a grim smile locked about his grizzled lips.
  It was no woman&rsquo;s task which lay before them. Exposing her whole
  broadside lay the long Sidonian; she was helpless, striving vainly to crawl
  away with her remaining oar banks. Her people were running to and fro,
  howling to Baal, Astarte, Moloch, and all their other foul gods, and
  stretching their hands for help to consorts too far away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Aru! Aru! Aru!</i>&rdquo; was the shout of the oar master; again
  the <i>Nausicaä</i> answered with her leap. Straight across the narrow water
  she shot, the firm hand of the governor never veering now. The stroke grew
  faster, faster. Then with one instinct men dropped the oars, to trail in the
  rushing water, and seized stanchions, beams, anything to brace themselves for
  the shock. The crash which followed was heard on the mainland and on Salamis.
  The side of the Ph&oelig;nician was beaten in like an egg-shell. From the
  <i>Nausicaä&rsquo;s</i> poop they saw her open hull reel over, saw the
  hundreds of upturned, frantic faces, heard the howls of agony, saw the waves
  leap into the gaping void.&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Back water,&rdquo; thundered Ameinias, &ldquo;clear the vortex, she
  is going down!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The <i>Nausicaä&rsquo;s</i> people staggered to the oars. So busy were
  they in righting their own ship few saw the crowning horror. A moment more
  and a few drifting spars, a few bobbing heads, were all that was left of the
  Ph&oelig;nician. The Ægean had swallowed her.</p>

  <p>A shout was pealing from the ships of the Hellenes. &ldquo;Zeus is with
  us! Athena is with us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At the outset of the battle, when advantage tells the most, advantage had
  been won. Themistocles&rsquo;s deed had fused all the Greeks with hopeful
  courage. Eurybiades was charging. Adeimantus was charging. Their ships and
  all the rest went racing to meet the foe.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">But the <i>Nausicaä</i> had paid for her victory. In the
  shock of ramming the triple-toothed beak on her prow had been wrenched away.
  In the <i>mêlée</i> of ships which had just begun, she must play her part
  robbed of her keenest weapon. The sinking of the Barbarian had been met with
  cheers by the Hellenes, by howls of revengeful rage by the host against them.
  Not lightly were the Asiatics who fought beneath the eyes of the king to be
  daunted. They came crowding up the strait in such masses that sheer numbers
  hindered them, leaving no space for the play of the oars, much less for fine
  man&oelig;uvre. Yet for an instant it seemed as if mere weight would sweep
  the Hellenes back to Salamis. Then the lines of battle dissolved into
  confused fragments. Captains singled out an opponent and charged home
  desperately, unmindful how it fared elsewhere in the battle. Here an Egyptian
  ran down a Eub&oelig;an, there a Sicyonian grappled a Cilician and flung her
  boarders on to the foeman&rsquo;s decks. To the onlookers the scene could
  have meant naught save confusion. A hundred duels, a hundred varying
  victories, but to which side the final glory would fall, who
  knew?&mdash;perchance not even Zeus.</p>

  <p>In the roaring <i>mêlée</i> the <i>Nausicaä</i> had for some moments moved
  almost aimlessly, her men gathering breath and letting their unscathed
  comrades pass. Then gradually the battle drifted round them also. A Cyprian,
  noting they had lost their ram, strove to charge them bow to bow. The skill
  of the governor avoided that disaster. They ran under the stem of a Tyrian,
  and Glaucon proved he had not forgotten his skill when he sent his javelins
  among the officers upon the poop. A second Sidonian swept down on them, but
  grown wise by her consort&rsquo;s destruction turned aside to lock with an
  Æginetan galley. How the fight at large was going, who was winning, who
  losing, Glaucon saw no more than any one else. An arrow grazed his arm. He
  first learned it when he found his armour bloody. A sling-stone smote the
  marine next to him on the forehead. The man dropped without a groan. Glaucon
  flung the body overboard, almost by instinct. Themistocles was everywhere, on
  the poop, on the foreship, among the rowers&rsquo; benches, shouting,
  laughing, cheering, ordering, standing up boldly where the arrows flew
  thickest, yet never hit. So for a while, till out of the confusion of ships
  and wrecks came darting a trireme, loftier than her peers. The railing on
  poop and prow was silver. The shields of the javelin-men that crowded her
  high fighting decks were gilded. Ten pennons whipped from her masts, and the
  cry of horns, tambours, and kettledrums blended with the shoutings of her
  crew. A partially disabled Hellene drifted across her path. She ran the
  luckless ship down in a twinkling. Then her bow swung. She headed toward the
  <i>Nausicaä</i>.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know this ship?&rdquo; asked Themistocles, at
  Glaucon&rsquo;s side on the poop.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A Tyrian, the newest in their fleet, but her captain is the admiral
  Ariamenes, Xerxes&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is attacking us, Excellency,&rdquo; called Ameinias, in his
  chief&rsquo;s ear. The din which covered the sea was beyond telling.</p>

  <p>Themistocles measured the water with his eye.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She will be alongside then in a moment,&rdquo; was his answer,
  &ldquo;and the beak is gone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gone, and ten of our best rowers are dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles drew down the helmet, covering his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Euge!</i> Since the choice is to grapple or fly, we had better
  grapple.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The governor shifted again the steering paddles. The head of the
  <i>Nausicaä</i> fell away toward her attacker, but no signal was given to
  quicken the oars. The Barbarian, noting what her opponent did, but justly
  fearing the handiness of the Greeks, slackened also. The two ships drifted
  slowly together. Long before they closed in unfriendly contact the arrows of
  the Ph&oelig;nician pelted over the <i>Nausicaä</i> like hail. Rowers fell as
  they sat on the upper benches; on the poop the <i>proreus</i> lay with half
  his men. Glaucon never counted how many missiles dinted his helmet and
  buckler. The next instant the two ships were drifting without steerage-way.
  The grappling-irons dashed down upon the Athenian, and simultaneously the
  brown Ph&oelig;nician boarders were scrambling like cats upon her decks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Swords, men!&rdquo; called Themistocles, never less daunted than at
  the pinch, &ldquo;up and feed them with iron!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Three times the Ph&oelig;nicians poured as a flood over the
  <i>Nausicaä</i>. Three times they were flung back with loss, but only to
  rage, call on their gods, and return with tenfold fury. Glaucon had hurled
  one sheaf of javelins, and tore loose another, eye and arm aiming, casting
  mechanically. In the lulls he saw how wind and sea were sweeping the two
  ships landward, until almost in arrow-shot of the rocky point where sat
  Xerxes and his lords. He saw the king upon his ivory throne and all his
  mighty men around him. He saw the scribes standing near with parchment and
  papyrus, inscribing the names of this or that ship which did well or ill in
  behalf of the lord of the Aryans. He saw the gaudy dresses of the eunuchs,
  the litters, and from them peering forth the veiled women. Did Artazostra
  think <i>now</i> the Hellenes were mad fools to look her brother&rsquo;s
  power in the face? From the shores of Attica and of Salamis, where the
  myriads rejoiced or wept as the scattered battle changed, the cries were
  rising, falling, like the throb of a tragic chorus,&mdash;a chorus of Titans,
  with the actors gods.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Another charge!&rdquo; shouted Ameinias, through the din,
  &ldquo;meet them briskly, lads!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Once more the hoarse Semitic war-shout, the dark-faced Asiatics dropping
  upon the decks, the whir of javelins, the scream of dying men, the clash of
  steel on steel. A frantic charge, but stoutly met. Themistocles was in the
  thickest <i>mêlée</i>. With his own spear he dashed two Tyrians overboard, as
  they sprang upon the poop. The band that had leaped down among the oar
  benches were hewn in pieces by the seamen. The remnant of the attackers
  recoiled in howls of despair. On the Ph&oelig;nician&rsquo;s decks the Greeks
  saw the officers laying the lash mercilessly across their men, but the
  disheartened creatures did not stir. Now could be seen Ariamenes, the high
  admiral himself, a giant warrior in his purple and gilded armour, going up
  and down the poop, cursing, praying, threatening,&mdash;all in vain. The
  <i>Nausicaä&rsquo;s</i> people rose and cheered madly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Enough! They have enough! Glory to Athens!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But here Ameinias gripped Themistocles&rsquo;s arm. The chief turned, and
  all the Hellenes with him. The cheer died on their lips. A tall trireme was
  bearing down on them in full charge even while the <i>Nausicaä</i> drifted.
  They were as helpless as the Sidonian they had sent to death. One groan broke
  from the Athenians.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Save, Athena! Save! It is Artemisia! The queen of
  Halicarnassus!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The heavy trireme of the amazon princess was a magnificent sight as they
  looked on her. Her oars flew in a flashing rhythm. The foam leaped in a
  cataract over her ram. The sun made fire of the tossing weapons on her prow.
  A yell of triumph rose from the Ph&oelig;nicians. On the <i>Nausicaä</i> men
  dropped sword and spear, moaned, raved, and gazed wildly on Themistocles as
  if he were a god possessing power to dash the death aside.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To your places, men!&rdquo; rang his shout, as he faced the foe
  unmoved, &ldquo;and die as Athenians!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then even while men glanced up at the sun to greet Helios for the last
  time, there was a marvel. The threatening beak shot around. The trireme flew
  past them, her oars leaping madly, her people too intent on escape even to
  give a flight of javelins. And again the Athenians cheered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The <i>Perseus</i>! Cimon has saved us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Not three ships&rsquo; lengths behind the Halicarnassian raced the ship of
  the son of Miltiades. They knew now why Artemisia had veered. Well she might;
  had she struck the <i>Nausicaä</i> down, her own broadside would have swung
  defenceless to the fleet pursuer. The <i>Perseus</i> sped past her consort at
  full speed, Athenian cheering Athenian as she went.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Need you help?&rdquo; called Cimon, from his poop, as Themistocles
  waved his sword.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None, press on, smite the Barbarian! Athena is with us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Athena is with us! Zeus is with us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The <i>Nausicaä&rsquo;s</i> crew were lifted from panic to mad enthusiasm.
  Still above them towered the tall Ph&oelig;nician, but they could have scaled
  Mt. Caucasus at that instant.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Onward! Up and after them,&rdquo; rang Ameinias&rsquo;s blast,
  &ldquo;she is our own, we will take her under the king&rsquo;s own
  eye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The javelins and arrows were pelting from the Barbarian. The Athenians
  mocked the shower as they leaped the void from bulwark to bulwark. Vainly the
  Ph&oelig;nicians strove to clear the grapples. Too firm! Their foes came on
  to their decks with long leaps, or here and there ran deftly on projecting
  spars, for what athlete of Hellas could not run the tight rope? In an instant
  the long rowers&rsquo; deck of the Tyrian was won, and the attackers cheered
  and blessed Athena. But this was only storming the first outpost. Like
  castles forward and aft reared the prow and poop, whither the sullen
  defenders retreated. Turning at bay, the Ph&oelig;nicians swarmed back into
  the waist, waiting no scourging from their officers. Now their proud admiral
  himself plunged into the <i>mêlée</i>, laying about with a mighty sword
  worthy of Ajax at Troy, showing he was a prince of the Aryans indeed. It took
  all the steadiness of Ameinias and his stoutest men to stop the rush, and
  save the Athenians in turn from being driven overboard. The rush was halted
  finally, though this was mere respite before a fiercer breaking of the storm.
  The two ships were drifting yet closer to the strand. Only the fear of
  striking their own men kept the Persians around the king from clouding the
  air with arrows. Glaucon saw the grandees near Xerxes&rsquo;s throne
  brandishing their swords. In imagination he saw the monarch leaping from his
  throne in agony as at Thermopylæ.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Back to the charge,&rdquo; pealed Ariamenes&rsquo;s summons to the
  Tyrians; &ldquo;will you be cowards and dogs beneath the very eyes of the
  king?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The defenders answered with a second rush. Others again hurled darts from
  the stern and foreship. Then out of the mælstrom of men and weapons came a
  truce. Athenian and Tyrian drew back, whilst Themistocles and Ariamenes were
  fighting blade to blade. Twice the giant Persian almost dashed the Hellene
  down. Twice Themistocles recovered poise, and paid back stroke for stroke. He
  had smitten the helmet from Ariamenes&rsquo;s head and was swinging for a
  master-blow when his foot slipped on the bloody plank. He staggered. Before
  he could recover, the Persian had brought his own weapon up, and flung his
  might into the downward stroke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The admiral&mdash;lost!&rdquo; Athenians shuddered together, but
  with the groan shot a javelin. Clear through the scales of the cuirass it
  tore, and into the Persian&rsquo;s shoulder,&mdash;Glaucon&rsquo;s cast,
  never at the Isthmus truer with hand or eye. The ponderous blade turned,
  grazed the Athenian&rsquo;s corselet, clattered on the deck. The Persian
  sprang back disarmed and powerless. At sight thereof the Ph&oelig;nicians
  flung down their swords. True Orientals, in the fate of their chief they saw
  decreeing Destiny,&mdash;what use to resist it?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yield, my Lord, yield,&rdquo; called Glaucon, in Persian,
  &ldquo;the battle is against you, and no fault of yours. Save the lives of
  your men.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ariamenes gave a toss of his princely head, and with his left hand plucked
  the javelin from his shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A prince of the Aryans knows how to die, but not how to
  yield,&rdquo; he cast back, and before the Athenians guessed his intent he
  sprang upon the bulwark. There in the sight of his king he stood and bowed
  his head and with his left arm made the sign of adoration.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seize him!&rdquo; shouted Ameinias, divining his intent, but too
  late. The Persian leaped into the water. In his heavy mail he sank like lead.
  The wave closed over him, as he passed forever from the sight of man.</p>

  <p>There was stillness on the Tyrian for a moment. A groan of helpless horror
  was rising from the Barbarians on the shore. Then the Ph&oelig;nicians fell
  upon their knees, crying in their harsh tongue, &ldquo;Quarter!
  Quarter!&rdquo; and embracing and kissing the feet of the victors. Thanks to
  the moment of quietness given them, the Athenians&rsquo; blood had cooled a
  little; they gathered up the weapons cast upon the deck; there was no
  massacre.</p>

  <p>Themistocles mounted the poop of the captured flag-ship, and Glaucon with
  him. The wind was wafting them again into the centre of the channel. For the
  first time for many moments they were able to look about them, to ask,
  &ldquo;How goes the battle?&rdquo; Not the petty duel they had fought, but
  the great battle of battles which was the life-struggle of Hellas. And
  behold, as they gazed they pressed their hands upon their eyes and looked and
  looked again, for the thing they saw seemed overgood for truth. Where the
  great Barbarian line had been pushing up the strait, were only bands of
  scattered ships, and most of these turning their beaks from Salamis. The
  waves were strewn with wrecks, and nigh every one a Persian. And right, left,
  and centre the triumphant Hellenes were pressing home, ramming, grappling,
  capturing. Even whilst the fight raged, pinnaces were thrusting out from
  Salamis&mdash;Aristeides&rsquo;s deed, they later heard&mdash;crowded with
  martial graybeards who could not look idly on while their sons fought on the
  ships, and who speedily landed on Psyttaleia to massacre the luckless
  Persians there stationed. The cheers of the Barbarians were ended now; from
  the shores came only a beastlike howling which drowned the pæans of the
  victors. As the <i>Nausicaä&rsquo;s</i> people looked, they could see the
  once haughty Ph&oelig;nicians and Cilicians thrusting back against the land,
  and the thousands of footmen running down upon the shore to drag the
  shattered triremes up and away from the triumphant Hellenes.</p>

  <p>The <i>Nausicaä&rsquo;s</i> people in wondering gaze stood there for a
  long time as if transfixed, forgetful how their ship and its prize drifted,
  forgetful of weariness, forgetful of wounds. Then as one man they turned to
  the poop of the captured Tyrian, and to Themistocles. <i>He</i> had done
  it&mdash;their admiral. He had saved Hellas under the eyes of the vaunting
  demigod who thought to be her destroyer. They called to Themistocles, they
  worshipped as if he were the Olympian himself.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30"></a>XXX. -- THEMISTOCLES GIVES A PROMISE</h2>

  <p class="first">After the <i>Nausicaä</i> had returned that night to
  Salamis, after the old men and the women had laughed and wept over the
  living,&mdash;they were too proud to weep over the dead,&mdash;after the
  prudent admirals had set the fleet again in order, for Xerxes might tempt
  fate again in the morning with his remaining ships, Themistocles found
  himself once more in his cabin. With him was only Glaucon the Alcmæonid. The
  admiral&rsquo;s words were few and pointed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son of Conon, last night you gave me the thought whereby I could
  save Hellas. To-day your javelin saved me from death. I owe you much. I will
  repay in true coin. To-morrow I can give you back to your wife and all your
  friends if you will but suffer me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The younger man flushed a little, but his eyes did not brighten. He felt
  Themistocles&rsquo;s reservation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On what terms?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shall be presented to the Athenians as one who, yielding for a
  moment to overmastering temptation, has atoned for one error by rendering
  infinite service.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I am to be &lsquo;Glaucon the Traitor&rsquo; still, even if
  &lsquo;Glaucon the Repentant Traitor&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your words are hard, son of Conon; what may I say? Have you any new
  explanation for the letter to Argos?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The old one&mdash;I did not write it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us not bandy useless arguments. Do you not see I shall be doing
  all that is possible?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me think a little.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The younger Athenian held down his head, and Themistocles saw his brows
  knitting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son of Neocles,&rdquo; said Glaucon, at length, &ldquo;I thank you.
  You are a just man. Whatever of sorrow has or will be mine, you have no part
  therein, but I cannot return&mdash;not to Hermione and my child&mdash;on any
  terms you name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your purpose, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-day the gods show mercy to Hellas, later they may show justice
  to me. The war is far from ended. Can you not let me serve on some ship of
  the allies where none can recognize me? Thus let me wait a year, and trust
  that in that year the sphinx will find her riddle answered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To wait thus long is hard,&rdquo; spoke the other, kindly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have done many hard things, Themistocles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And your wife?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hera pity her! She bade me return when Athens knew me innocent.
  Better that she wait a little longer, though in sorrow, when I can return to
  her even as she bade me. Nevertheless, promise one thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Name it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That if her parents are about to give her to Democrates or any
  other, you will prevent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles&rsquo;s face lightened. He laid a friendly hand on the young
  man&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not know how to answer your cry of innocency,
  <i>philotate</i>, but this I know, in all Hellas I think none is fairer in
  body or soul than you. Have no fear for Hermione, and in the year to come may
  Revealer Apollo make all of your dark things bright.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon bowed his head. Themistocles had given everything the outlaw could
  ask, and the latter went out of the cabin.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31"></a>XXXI. -- DEMOCRATES SURRENDERS</h2>

  <p>Hellas was saved. But whether forever or only for a year the gods kept
  hid. Panic-stricken, the &ldquo;Lord of the World&rdquo; had fled to Asia
  after the great disaster. The eunuchs, the harem women, the soft-handed
  pages, had escaped with their master to luxurious Sardis, the remnant of the
  fleet fled back across the Ægean. But the brain and right arm of the
  Persians, Mardonius the Valiant, remained in Hellas. With him were still the
  Median infantry, the Tartar horse-archers, the matchless Persian
  lancers,&mdash;the backbone of the undefeated army. Hellas was not yet
  safe.</p>

  <p>Democrates had prospered. He had been reëlected strategus. If Themistocles
  no longer trusted him quite so freely as once, Aristeides, restored now to
  much of his former power, gave him full confidence. Democrates found constant
  and honourable employment through the winter in the endless negotiations at
  Sparta, at Corinth, and elsewhere, while the jealous Greek states wrangled
  and intrigued, more to humiliate some rival than to advance the safety of
  Hellas. But amongst all the patriot chiefs none seemed more devoted to the
  common weal of Hellas than the Athenian orator.</p>

  <p>Hermippus at least was convinced of this. The Eleusinian had settled at
  Tr&oelig;zene on the Argive coast, a hospitable city that received many an
  outcast Athenian. He found his daughter&rsquo;s resistance to another
  marriage increasingly unreasonable. Was not Glaucon dead for more than a
  year? Ought not any woman to bless Hera who gave her so noble, so eloquent, a
  husband as Democrates&mdash;pious, rich, trusted by the greatest, and with
  the best of worldly prospects?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you truly desire any other worthy man, <i>makaira</i>,&rdquo;
  said Hermippus, once, &ldquo;you shall not find me obstinate. Can a loving
  father say more? But if you are simply resolved never to marry, I will give
  you to him despite your will. A senseless whim must not blast your highest
  happiness.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He ruined Glaucon,&rdquo; said Hermione, tearfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; returned Lysistra, who like many good women could
  say exceeding cruel things, &ldquo;<i>he</i> has never been a traitor to his
  country.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hermione&rsquo;s answer was to fly to her chamber, and to weep&mdash;as
  many a time before&mdash;over Ph&oelig;nix in the cradle. Here old Cleopis
  found her, took her in her arms, and sang her the old song about Alphæus
  chasing Arethusa&mdash;a song more fit for Ph&oelig;nix than his mother, but
  most comforting. So the contest for the moment passed, but after a conference
  with Hermippus, Democrates went away on public business to Corinth unusually
  well pleased with the world and himself.</p>

  <p>It was a tedious, jangling conference held at the Isthmus city. Mardonius
  had tempted the Athenians sorely. In the spring had come his envoys
  proffering reparation for all injuries in the wars, enlarged territory, and
  not slavery, but free alliance with the Great King, if they would but join
  against their fellow-Hellenes. The Athenians had met the tempter as became
  Athenians. Aristeides had given the envoys the answer of the whole
  people.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We know your power. Yet tell it to Mardonius, that so long as
  Helios moves in the heavens we will not make alliance with Xerxes, but rather
  trust to the gods whose temples he has burned.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bravely said, but when the Athenians looked to Sparta for the great army
  to hasten north and give Mardonius his death-stroke, it was the old wearisome
  tale of excuses and delay. At the conference in Corinth Aristeides and
  Democrates had passed from arguments to all but threats, even such as
  Themistocles had used at Salamis. It was after one of these fruitless debates
  that Democrates passed out of the gathering at the Corinthian prytaneum, with
  his colleagues all breathing forth their wrath against Dorian stupidity and
  evasiveness.</p>

  <p>Democrates himself crossed the city Agora, seeking the house of the
  friendly merchant where he was to sup. He walked briskly, his thoughts more
  perhaps on the waiting betrothal feast at Tr&oelig;zene, than on the
  discussion behind him. The Agora scene had little to interest, the same
  buyers, booths, and babel as in Athens, only the citadel above was the mount
  of Acro-Corinthus, not the tawny rock of Athena. And in late months he had
  begun to find his old fears and terrors flee away. Every day he was growing
  more certain that his former &ldquo;missteps&rdquo;&mdash;that was his own
  name for certain occurrences&mdash;could have no malign influence.
  &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he was reflecting, &ldquo;Nemesis is a very
  capricious goddess. Often she forgets for a lifetime, and after
  death&mdash;who knows what is beyond the Styx?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was on such noble terms with all about him that he could even give ear
  to the whine of a beggar. The man was sitting on the steps between the
  pillars of a colonnade, with a tame crow perched upon his fist, and as
  Democrates passed he began his doggerel prayer:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good master, a handful of barley bestow On the child of Apollo, the
  sage, sable crow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Athenian began to fumble in his belt for an obol, when he was rudely
  distracted by a twitch upon his chiton. Turning, he was little pleased to
  come face to face with no less a giant than Lycon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was an hour, <i>philotate</i>,&rdquo; spoke the Spartan, with
  ill-concealed sneer, &ldquo;when you did not have so much silver to scatter
  out to beggars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Time had not mended Lycon&rsquo;s aspect, nor taken from his eye that
  sinister twinkle which was so marked a foil to his brutishness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not invite you, dear fellow,&rdquo; rejoined the Athenian,
  &ldquo;to remind me of the fact.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet you should have gratitude, and you have lacked that virtue of
  late. It was a sorry plight Mardonius&rsquo;s money saved you from two years
  since, and nobly have you remembered his good service.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Worthy Lacedæmonian,&rdquo; said Democrates, with what patience he
  could command, &ldquo;if you desire to go over all that little business which
  concerned us then, at least I would suggest not in the open Agora.&rdquo; He
  started to walk swiftly away. The Spartan&rsquo;s ponderous strides easily
  kept beside him. Democrates looked vainly for an associate whom he could
  approach and on some pretext could accompany. None in sight. Lycon kept fast
  hold of his cloak. For practical purposes Democrates was prisoner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why in Corinth?&rdquo; he threw out sullenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For three reasons, <i>philotate</i>,&rdquo; Lycon grinned over his
  shoulder, &ldquo;first, the women at the Grove of Aphrodite here are
  handsome; second, I am weary of Sparta and its black broth and iron money;
  third, and here is the rose for my garland, I had need to confer with your
  noble self.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would not Hiram be your dutiful messenger again?&rdquo; queried the
  other, vainly watching for escape.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hiram is worth twenty talents as a helper;&rdquo;&mdash;Lycon gave
  a hound-like chuckle,&mdash;&ldquo;still he is not Apollo, and there are too
  many strings on this lyre for him to play them all. Besides, he failed at
  Salamis.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He did! Zeus blast his importunity and yours likewise. Where are
  you taking me? I warn you in advance, you are &lsquo;shearing an
  ass,&rsquo;&mdash;attempting the impossible,&mdash;if you deceive yourself as
  to my power. I can do nothing more to prevent the war from being pressed
  against Mardonius. It is only your Laconian ephors that are
  hindering.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall see, <i>philotate</i>, we shall see,&rdquo; grunted the
  Spartan, exasperatingly cool. &ldquo;Here is Poseidon&rsquo;s Temple. Let us
  sit in the shaded portico.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates resigned himself to be led to a stone seat against the wall.
  The gray old &ldquo;dog-watcher&rdquo; by the gate glanced up to see that no
  dogs were straying into the holy house, noted only two gentlemen come for a
  chat, and resumed his siesta. Lycon took a long time in opening his
  business.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The world has used you well of late, dear fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Passing well, by Athena&rsquo;s favour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You should say by Hermes&rsquo;s favour, but I would trust you
  Athenians to grow fat on successful villany and then bless the righteous
  gods.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope you haven&rsquo;t left Sparta just to revile me!&rdquo;
  cried Democrates, leaping up, to be thrust back by Lycon&rsquo;s giant
  paw.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ai!</i> mix a little honey with your speech, it costs nothing.
  Well, the length and breadth of my errand is this, Mardonius must fight soon,
  and must be victorious.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is for your brave ephors to say,&rdquo; darted Democrates.
  &ldquo;According to their valiant proposals they desire this war to imitate
  that with Troy,&mdash;to last ten years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed&mdash;but I always held my people surpassed in
  procrastination, as yours in deceiving. However, their minds will
  change.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aristeides and Themistocles will bless you for that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lycon shrugged his great shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll surpass the gods, who can seldom please all men.
  Still it is quite true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear Democrates, you know what&rsquo;s befallen in Sparta. Since
  Leonidas died, his rivals from my own side of the royal house have gathered a
  great deal more of power. My uncle Nicander is at present head of the board
  of ephors, and gladly takes my advice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; Democrates began to divine the drift.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It seemed best to me after the affair at Salamis to give the lie to
  my calumniators, who hinted that I desired to &lsquo;Medize,&rsquo; and that
  it was by my intriguing that the late king took so small a force to
  Thermopylæ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All Hellas knows <i>your</i> patriotism!&rdquo; cried Democrates,
  satirically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Even so. I have silenced my fiercest abusers. If I have not yet
  urged in our assembly that we should fight Mardonius, it is merely
  because&mdash;it is not yet prudent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excellent scoundrel,&rdquo; declared the other, writhing on his
  seat, &ldquo;you are no Spartan, but long-winded as a Sicilian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Patience, <i>philotate</i>, a Spartan must either speak in
  apothegms or take all day. I have not advised a battle yet because I was not
  certain of your aid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, by Zeus,&rdquo; broke out Democrates, &ldquo;that ointment I
  sniffed a long way off. I can give you quick answer. Fly back to Sparta,
  swift as Boreas; plot, conspire, earn Tartarus, to your heart&rsquo;s
  content&mdash;you&rsquo;ll get no more help from me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I expected that speech.&rdquo; Lycon&rsquo;s coolness drove his
  victim almost frantic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the affair of Tempe I bent to you for the last time,&rdquo;
  Democrates charged desperately. &ldquo;I have counted the cost. Perhaps you
  can use against me certain documents, but I am on a surer footing than once.
  In the last year I have done such service to Hellas I can even hope to be
  forgiven, should these old mistakes be proved. And if you drive me to bay, be
  sure of this, I will see to it that all the dealings betwixt the Barbarian
  and your noble self are expounded to your admiring countrymen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You show truly excellent courage, dear Democrates,&rdquo; cried
  Lycon, in pseudo-admiration. &ldquo;That speech was quite worthy of a tragic
  actor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re in the theatre, let the chorus sing its last strophe
  and have done. You disgust me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace, peace,&rdquo; ordered Lycon, his hand still on the
  Athenian&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;I will make all the haste I can, but
  obstinacy is disagreeable. I repeat, you are needed, sorely needed, by
  Mardonius to enable him to complete the conquest of Hellas. You shall not
  call the Persians ungrateful&mdash;the tyranny of Athens under the easy
  suzerainty of the king, is that no dish to whet your appetite?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knew of the offer before.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A great pity you are not more eager. Hermes seldom sends such
  chances twice. I hoped to have you for &lsquo;my royal brother&rsquo; when
  they gave me the like lordship of Lacedæmon. However, the matter does not end
  with your refusal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have said, &lsquo;Do your worst.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And my worst is&mdash;Agis.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For an instant Lycon was dismayed. He thought he had slain his victim with
  one word. Democrates dropped from his clutch and upon the pavement as though
  stricken through the heart by an arrow. He was pallid as a corpse, at first
  he only groaned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Eu! eu!</i> good comrade,&rdquo; cried the Spartan, dragging him
  up, half triumphant, half sympathetic, &ldquo;I did not know I was throwing
  Zeus&rsquo;s thunderbolts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Athenian sat with his head on his hands. In all his dealings with the
  Spartan he had believed he had covered the details of the fate of Glaucon.
  Lycon could surmise what he liked, but the proof to make the damning charges
  good Democrates believed he had safe in his own keeping. Only one man could
  have unlocked the casket of infamy&mdash;Agis&mdash;and the mention of his
  name was as a bolt from the blue.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is he? I heard he was killed at Artemisium.&rdquo; Lycon
  hardly understood his victim&rsquo;s thick whispers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wounded indeed, <i>philotate</i>, taken prisoner, and sent to
  Thebes. There friends of mine found he had a story to tell&mdash;greatly to
  my advantage. It is only a little time since he came to Sparta.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What lies has he told?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Several, dear fellow, although if they are lies, then Aletheia,
  Lady Truth, must almost own them for her children. At least they are
  interesting lies; as, for example, how you advised the Cyprian to escape from
  Athens, how you gave Agis a letter to hide in the boots of Glaucon&rsquo;s
  messenger, of your interviews with Lampaxo and Archias, of the charming art
  you possess of imitating handwritings and seals.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Base-born swine! who will believe him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Base born, Democrates, but hardly swinish. He can tell a very clear
  story. Likewise, Lampaxo and Archias must testify at the trial, also your
  slave Bias can tell many interesting things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only if I consent to produce him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When did a master ever refuse to let his slave testify, if
  demanded, unless he wished to blast his own cause with the jury? No,
  <i>makaire</i>, you will not enjoy the day when Themistocles arrays the
  testimony against you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates shivered. The late spring sun was warm. He felt no heat. A mere
  charge of treason he was almost prepared now to endure. If Mistress Fortune
  helped him, he might refute it, but to be branded before Hellas as the
  destroyer of his bosom friend, and that by guile the like whereof Tantalus,
  Sisyphus, and Ixion conjoined had never wrought&mdash;what wonder his knees
  smote together? Why had he not foreseen that Agis would fall into
  Lycon&rsquo;s hands? Why had he trusted that lying tale from Artemisium? And
  worst of all, worse than the howls of the people who would tear his body
  asunder like dogs, not waiting the work of the hemlock, was the thought of
  Hermione. She hated him now. How she would love him, though he sat on
  Xerxes&rsquo;s throne, if once her suspicion rose to certainty! He saw
  himself ruined in life and in love, and blazoned as infamous forever.</p>

  <p>Lycon was wise enough to sit some moments, letting his utterance do its
  work. He was confident, and rightly. Democrates looked on him at last. The
  workings of the Athenian&rsquo;s face were terrible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am your slave, Spartan. Had you bought me for ten minæ and held
  the bill of sale, I were not yours more utterly. Your wish?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lycon chose his words and answered slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must serve Persia. Not for a moment, but for all time. You must
  place that dreadful gift of yours at our disposal. And in return take what is
  promised,&mdash;the lordship of Athens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No word of that,&rdquo; groaned the wretched man, &ldquo;what will
  you do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aristeides is soon going to Sparta to press home his demands that
  the Lacedæmonians march in full force against Mardonius. I can see to it that
  his mission succeeds. A great battle will be fought in B&oelig;otia.
  <i>We</i> can see to it that Mardonius is so victorious that all further
  resistance becomes a dream.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And my part in this monster&rsquo;s work?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The demands and propositions with which Lycon answered this despairing
  question will unfold themselves in due place and time. Suffice it here, that
  when he let the Athenian go his way Lycon was convinced that Democrates had
  bound himself heart and soul to forward his enterprise. The orator was no
  merry guest for his Corinthian hosts that night. He returned to his old
  manner of drinking unmixed wine. &ldquo;Thirsty as a Macedonian!&rdquo; cried
  his companions, in vain endeavour to drive him into a laugh. They did not
  know that once more the chorus of the Furies was singing about his ears, and
  he could not still it by the deepest wine-cup. They did not know that every
  time he closed his eyes he was seeing the face of Glaucon. That morning he
  had mocked at Nemesis. That night he heard the beating of her brazen
  wings.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32"></a>XXXII. -- THE STRANGER IN TR&OElig;ZENE</h2>

  <p class="first">Despite exile, life had moved pleasantly for
  Hermippus&rsquo;s household that spring. The Tr&oelig;zenians had surpassed
  all duties to Zeus Xenios&mdash;the stranger&rsquo;s god&mdash;in
  entertaining the outcast Athenians. The fugitives had received two obols per
  day to keep them in figs and porridge. Their children had been suffered to
  roam and plunder the orchards. But Hermippus had not needed such generosity.
  He had placed several talents at interest in Corinth; likewise bonds of
  &ldquo;guest-friendship&rdquo; with prominent Tr&oelig;zenians made his
  residence very agreeable. He had hired a comfortable house, and could enjoy
  even luxury with his wife, daughter, young sons, and score of slaves.</p>

  <p>Little Ph&oelig;nix grew marvellously day by day, as if obeying his
  mother&rsquo;s command to wax strong and avenge his father. Old Cleopis vowed
  he was the healthiest, least tearful babe, as well as the handsomest, she had
  ever known,&mdash;and she spoke from wide experience. When he was one year
  old, he was so active they had to tie him in the cradle. When the golden
  spring days came, he would ride forth upon his nurse&rsquo;s back, surveying
  the Hellas he was born to inherit, and seeming to find it exceeding good.</p>

  <p>But as spring verged on summer, Hermione demanded so much of
  Cleopis&rsquo;s care that even Ph&oelig;nix ceased to be the focus of
  attention. The lordly Alcmæonid fell into the custody of one Niobe, a
  dark-haired lass of the islands, who treated him well, but cared too much for
  certain young &ldquo;serving-gentlemen&rdquo; to waste on her charge any
  unreciprocated adoration. So on one day, just as the dying grass told the
  full reign of the Sun King, she went forth with her precious bundle wriggling
  in her arms, but her thoughts hardly on Master Ph&oelig;nix. Procles the
  steward had been cold of late, he had even cast sly glances at Jocasta,
  Lysistra&rsquo;s tiring-woman. Mistress Niobe was ready&mdash;since fair
  means of recalling the fickle Apollo failed&mdash;to resort to foul. Instead,
  therefore, of going to the promenade over the sea, she went&mdash;burden and
  all&mdash;to the Agora, where she was sure old Dion, who kept a
  soothsayer&rsquo;s shop, would give due assistance in return for half a
  drachma.</p>

  <p>The market was just thinning. Niobe picked her way amongst the vegetable
  women, fought off a boy who thrust on her a pair of geese, and found in a
  quiet corner by a temple porch the booth of Dion, who grinned with his
  toothless gums in way of greeting. He listened with paternal interest to her
  story, soothed her when she sniffled at Procles&rsquo;s name, and made her
  show her silver, then began pulling over his bags and vials of strange
  powders and liquids.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, kind Master Dion,&rdquo; began Niobe, for the sixth time,
  &ldquo;if only some philtre could make Procles loath that abominable
  Jocasta!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Eu! eu!</i>&rdquo; muttered the old sinner, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
  hard to say what&rsquo;s best,&mdash;powder of toad&rsquo;s bone or the
  mixture of wormwood and adder&rsquo;s fat. The safest thing is to consult the
  god&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, my holy cock here, hatched at Delphi with Apollo&rsquo;s
  blessings on him.&rdquo; Dion pointed with his thumb to the small coop at his
  feet. &ldquo;The oracle is simple. You cast before him two piles of corn; if
  he picks at the one to right we take toad&rsquo;s bone, to left the
  adder&rsquo;s fat. Heaven will speak to us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; cried Niobe, brightening.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, of course, we must use only consecrated corn, that&rsquo;s two
  obols more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Niobe&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only this
  half-drachma.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then, <i>philotata</i>,&rdquo; said Dion, kindly but firmly,
  &ldquo;we had better wait a little longer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Niobe wept. &ldquo;<i>Ai!</i> woe. &lsquo;A little longer&rsquo; and
  Jocasta has Procles. I can&rsquo;t ask Hermione again for money. <i>Ai!
  ai!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Two round tears did not move Dion in the slightest. Niobe was sobbing, at
  her small wits&rsquo; end, when a voice sounded behind her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there wrong, lass? By Zeus, but you carry a handsome
  child!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Niobe glanced, and instantly stopped weeping. A young man dressed roughly
  as a sailor, and with long black hair and beard, had approached her, but
  despite dress and beard she was quite aware he was far handsomer than even
  Procles.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I beg pardon, <i>kyrie</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;she said
  &ldquo;<i>kyrie</i>&rdquo; by instinct,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only an honest
  maid. Dion is terribly extortionate.&rdquo; She cast down her eyes, expecting
  instant succour from the susceptible seaman, but to her disgust she saw he
  was admiring only the babe, not herself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! Gods and goddesses, what a beautiful child! A girl?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A boy,&rdquo; answered Niobe, almost sullenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blessed the house in Tr&oelig;zene then that can boast of such a
  son.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s not Tr&oelig;zenian, but one of the exiles from
  Athens,&rdquo; volunteered Dion, who kept all the tittle-tattle of the little
  city in stock along with his philtres.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An Athenian! Praised be Athena Polias, then. I am from Athens
  myself. And his father?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The brat will never boast of his father,&rdquo; quoth Dion, rolling
  his eyes. &ldquo;He left the world in a way, I wager five minæ, the mother
  hopes she can hide from her darling, but the babe&rsquo;s of right good
  stock, an Alcmæonid, and the grandfather is that Hermippus&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hermippus?&rdquo; The stranger seemed to catch the word out of
  Dion&rsquo;s mouth. A donkey had broken loose at the upper end of the Agora;
  he turned and stared at it and its pursuers intently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re Athenian,&rdquo; went on the soothsayer, &ldquo;the
  story&rsquo;s an old one&mdash;of Glaucon the Traitor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The stranger turned back again. For a moment Dion saw he was blinking, but
  no doubt it was dust. Then he suddenly began to fumble in his girdle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you want, girl?&rdquo; he demanded of Niobe, nigh
  fiercely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two obols.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take two drachmæ. I was once a friend to that Glaucon, and traitor
  though he has been blazed, his child is yet dear to me. Let me take
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Without waiting her answer he thrust the coin into her hands, and caught
  the child out of them. Ph&oelig;nix looked up into the strange, bearded face,
  and deliberated an instant whether to crow or to weep. Then some friendly god
  decided him. He laughed as sweetly, as musically, as ever one can at his most
  august age. With both chubby hands he plucked at the black beard and held
  tight. The strange sailor answered laugh with laugh, and released himself
  right gayly. Then whilst Niobe and Dion watched and wondered they saw the
  sailor kiss the child full fifty times, all the time whispering soft words in
  his ear, at which Ph&oelig;nix crowed and laughed yet more.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An old family servant,&rdquo; threw out Dion, in a whisper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sheep!&rdquo; retorted the nurse, &ldquo;do you call yourself wise?
  Do you think a man with that face and those long hands ever felt the stocks
  or the whip? He&rsquo;s gentleman born, by Demeter!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;War makes many changes,&rdquo; rejoined Dion. &ldquo;<i>Ai!</i> is
  he beside himself or a kidnapper? He is walking off with the babe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The stranger indeed had seemed to forget them all and was going with swift
  strides up the Agora, but just before Niobe could begin her outcry he
  wheeled, and brought his merry burden back to the nurse&rsquo;s arms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You ought to be exceeding proud, my girl,&rdquo; he remarked almost
  severely, &ldquo;to have such a precious babe in charge. I trust you are
  dutiful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So I strive, <i>kyrie</i>, but he grows very strong. One cannot
  keep the swaddling clothes on him now. They say he will be a mighty athlete
  like his father.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes&mdash;his father&mdash;&rdquo; The sailor looked down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You knew Master Glaucon well?&rdquo; pressed Dion, itching for a
  new bit of gossip.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered the sailor, standing gazing on the child as
  though something held him fascinated, then shot another question. &ldquo;And
  does the babe&rsquo;s lady-mother prosper?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is passing well in body, <i>kyrie</i>, but grievously ill in
  mind. Hera give her a release from all her sorrow!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorrow?&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s eyes were opening wider, wider.
  &ldquo;What mean you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, all Tr&oelig;zene knows it, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not from Tr&oelig;zene. My ship made port from Naxos this
  morning. Speak, girl!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He seized Niobe&rsquo;s wrist in a grip which she thought would crush the
  bone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ai!</i> Let go, sir, you hurt. Don&rsquo;t stare so. I&rsquo;m
  frightened. I&rsquo;ll tell as fast as I can. Master Democrates has come back
  from Corinth. Hermippus is resolved to make the <i>kyria</i> wed him, however
  bitterly she resists. It&rsquo;s taken a long time for her father to
  determine to break her will, but now his mind&rsquo;s made up. The betrothal
  is in three days, the wedding ten days thereafter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The sailor had dropped her hand. She shrank at the pallor of his face. He
  seemed struggling for words; when they came she made nothing of them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Themistocles, Themistocles&mdash;your promise!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then by some giant exercise of will he steadied. His speech grew more
  coherent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give me the child,&rdquo; he commanded, and Niobe mutely obeyed. He
  kissed Ph&oelig;nix on both cheeks, mouth, forehead. They saw that tears were
  running down his bronzed face. He handed back the babe and again held out
  money,&mdash;a coin for both the slave girl and the soothsayer,&mdash;gold
  half-darics, that they gaped at wonderingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say nothing!&rdquo; ordered the sailor, &ldquo;nothing of what I
  have said or done, or as Helios shines this noon, I will kill you
  both.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Not waiting reply, he went down the Agora at a run, and never looked back.
  It took some moments for Dion and Niobe to recover their equanimity; they
  would have believed it all a dream, but lo! in their hands gleamed the
  money.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are times,&rdquo; remarked the soothsayer, dubiously at last,
  &ldquo;when I begin to think the gods again walk the earth and work wonders.
  This is a very high matter. Even I with my art dare not meddle with it. It is
  best to heed the injunction to silence. Wagging tongues always have troubles
  as their children. Now let us proceed with my sacred cock and his
  divination.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Niobe got her philtre,&mdash;though whether it reconquered Procles is not
  contained in this history. Likewise, she heeded Dion&rsquo;s injunction.
  There was something uncanny about the strange sailor; she hid away the
  half-daric, and related nothing of her adventure even to her confidant
  Cleopis.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Three days later Democrates was not drinking wine at his
  betrothal feast, but sending this cipher letter by a swift and trusty
  &ldquo;distance-runner&rdquo; to Sparta.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Democrates to Lycon, greeting:&mdash;At Corinth I cursed you.
  Rejoice therefore; you are my only hope. I am with you whether your path
  leads to Olympus or to Hades. Tartarus is opened at my feet. You must save
  me. My words are confused, do you think? Then hear this, and ask if I have
  not cause for turning mad.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yesterday, even as Hermippus hung garlands on his house, and
  summoned the guests to witness the betrothal contract, Themistocles returned
  suddenly from Eub&oelig;a. He called Hermippus and myself aside.
  &lsquo;<i>Glaucon lives</i>,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and with the god&rsquo;s
  help we&rsquo;ll prove his innocence.&rsquo; Hermippus at once broke off the
  betrothal. No one else knows aught thereof, not even Hermione. Themistocles
  refuses all further details. &lsquo;Glaucon lives,&rsquo;&mdash;I can think
  of nothing else. Where is he? What does he? How soon will the awful truth go
  flying through Hellas? I trembled when I heard he was dead. But name my
  terrors now I know he is alive! Send Hiram. He, if any snake living, can find
  me my enemy before it is too late. And speed the victory of Mardonius!
  <i>Chaire.</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon lives.&rdquo; Democrates had only written one least part of
  his terrors. Two words&mdash;but enough to make the orator the most miserable
  man in Hellas, the most supple of Xerxes&rsquo;s hundred million slaves.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33"></a>XXXIII. -- WHAT BEFELL ON THE HILLSIDE</h2>

  <p class="first">Once more the Persians pressed into Attica, once more the
  Athenians,&mdash;or such few of them as had ventured home in the
  winter,&mdash;fled with their movables to Salamis or Peloponnesus, and an
  embassy, headed by Aristeides, hastened to Sparta to demand for the last time
  that the tardy ephors make good their promise in sending forth their infantry
  to hurl back the invader. If not, Aristeides spoke plainly, his people must
  perforce close alliance with Mardonius.</p>

  <p>Almost to the amazement of the Athenian chiefs, so accustomed were they to
  Dorian doltishness and immobility, after a ten days&rsquo; delay and excuses
  that &ldquo;they must celebrate their festival the Hyacinthia,&rdquo; the
  ephors called forth their whole levy. Ten thousand heavy infantrymen with a
  host of lightly armed &ldquo;helots&rdquo;(11) were started northward under
  the able lead of Pausanias, the regent for Leonidas&rsquo;s young son.
  Likewise all the allies of Lacedæmon&mdash;Corinthians, Sicyonians, Elians,
  Arcadians&mdash;began to hurry toward the Isthmus. Therefore men who had
  loved Hellas and had almost despaired for her took courage. &ldquo;At last we
  will have a great land battle, and an end to the Barbarian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[11 The serfs of the Spartans.]</p>

  <p>All was excitement in the Athenian colony at Tr&oelig;zene. The board of
  strategi met and voted that now was the time for a crowning effort. Five
  thousand men-at-arms should march under Aristeides to join against Mardonius
  in B&oelig;otia. By sea Themistocles should go with every available ship to
  Delos, meet the allied squadrons there, and use his infallible art in
  persuading the sluggish Spartan high admiral to conduct a raid across the
  Ægean at Xerxes&rsquo;s own doors. Of the ten strategi Democrates had called
  loudest for instant action, so loudly indeed that Themistocles had cautioned
  him against rashness. Hermippus was old, but experienced men trusted him,
  therefore he was appointed to command the contingent of his tribe. Democrates
  was to accompany Aristeides as general adjutant; his diplomatic training
  would be invaluable in ending the frictions sure to arise amongst the allies.
  Cimon would go with Themistocles, and so every other man was sent to his
  place. In the general preparation private problems seemed forgotten.
  Hermippus and Democrates both announced that the betrothal of Hermione had
  been postponed, pending the public crisis. The old Eleusinian had not told
  his daughter, or even his wife, why he had seemed to relax his announced
  purpose of forcing Hermione to an unwelcome marriage. The young widow knew
  she had respite&mdash;for how long nothing told her, but for every day her
  agony was postponed she blessed kind Hera. Then came the morning when her
  father must go forth with his men. She still loved him, despite the grief he
  was giving her. She did him justice to believe he acted in affection. The gay
  ribbons that laced his cuirass, the red and blue embroidery that edged his
  &ldquo;taxiarch&rsquo;s&rdquo; cloak, were from the needle of his daughter.
  Hermione kissed him as she stood with her mother in the aula. He coughed
  gruffly when he answered their &ldquo;farewell.&rdquo; The house door closed
  behind him, and Hermione and Lysistra ran into one another&rsquo;s arms. They
  had given to Hellas their best, and now must look to Athena.</p>

  <p>Hermippus and Aristeides were gone, Democrates remained in Tr&oelig;zene.
  His business, he said, was more diplomatic than military, and he was
  expecting advices from the islands which he must take to Pausanias in person.
  He had a number of interviews with Themistocles, when it was observed that
  every time he came away with clouded brow and gruff answers to all who
  accosted. It began to be hinted that all was not as well as formerly between
  the admiral and the orator, that Democrates had chosen to tie too closely to
  Aristeides for the son of Neocles&rsquo;s liking, and that as soon as the
  campaign was decided, a bitter feud would break out betwixt them. But this
  was merest gossip. Outwardly Democrates and Themistocles continued friends,
  dined together, exchanged civilities. On the day when Themistocles was to
  sail for Delos he walked arm in arm with Democrates to the quay. The hundreds
  of onlookers saw him embrace the young strategus in a manner belying any
  rumour of estrangement, whilst Democrates stood on the sand waving his good
  wishes until the admiral climbed the ladder of the <i>Nausicaä</i>.</p>

  <p>It was another day and landscape which the stranger in Hellas would have
  remembered long. The haven of Tr&oelig;zene, noblest in Peloponnesus, girt by
  its two mountain promontories, Methana and the holy hill Calauria, opened its
  bright blue into the deeper blue of the Saronic bay. Under the eye of the
  beholder Ægina and the coasts of Attica stood forth, a fit frame to the far
  horizon. Sun, sea, hills, and shore wrought together to make one glorious
  harmony, endless variety, yet ordered and fashioned into a divine whole.
  &ldquo;Euopis,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Fair-Faced,&rdquo; the beauty-loving
  dwellers of the country called it, and they named aright.</p>

  <p>Something of the beauty touched even Hermione as she stood on the hill
  slope, gazing across the sea. Only Cleopis was with her. The young widow had
  less trembling when she looked on the <i>Nausicaä</i> than when one year
  before the stately trireme had sailed for Artemisium. If ill news must come,
  it would be from the plains of B&oelig;otia. Most of Themistocles&rsquo;s
  fleet was already at Delos. He led only a dozen sail. When his squadron
  glided on into the blue deep, the haven seemed deserted save for the
  Carthaginian trader that swung at her cables close upon the land. As Hermione
  looked and saw the climbing sun change the tintings of the waters, here
  spreading a line of green gold amidst the blue, here flashing the waves with
  dark violet, something of the peace and majesty of the scene entered into her
  own breast. The waves at the foot of the slope beat in monotonous music. She
  did not wonder that Thetis, Galatea, and all the hundred Nereids loved their
  home. Somewhere, far off on that shimmering plain, Glaucon the Beautiful had
  fallen asleep; whether he waked in the land of Rhadamanthus, whether he had
  been stolen away by Leucothea and the other nymphs to be their playfellow,
  she did not know. She was not sad, even to think of him crowned with green
  seaweed, and sitting under the sea-floor with fish-tailed Tritons at their
  tables of pearl, while the finny shoals like birds flitted above their heads.
  Thales the Sage made all life proceed out of the sea. Perchance all life
  should return to it. Then she would find her husband again, not beyond, but
  within the realms of great Oceanus. With such beauty spreading out before her
  eyes the phantasy was almost welcome.</p>

  <p>The people had wandered homeward. Cleopis set the parasol on the dry grass
  where it would shade her mistress and betook herself to the shelter of a
  rock. If Hermione was pleased to meditate so long, she would not deny her
  slave a siesta. So the Athenian sat and mused, now sadly, now with a gleam of
  brightness, for she was too young to have her sun clouded always.</p>

  <p>A speaker near by her called her out of her reverie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You sit long, <i>kyria</i>, and gaze forth as if you were Zeus in
  Olympus and could look on all the world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hermione had not exchanged a word with Democrates since that day she cast
  scorn on him on that other hill slope at Munychia, but this did not make his
  intrusion more welcome. With mortification she realized that she had
  forgotten herself. That she lay on the sunny bank with her feet outstretched
  and her hair shaken loose on her shoulders. Her feet she instantly covered
  with her long himation. Her hands flew instantly to her hair. Then she
  uprose, flushing haughtily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It has pleased my father, sir,&rdquo; she spoke with frigid
  dignity, &ldquo;to tell me that you are some day perchance to be my husband.
  The fulfilment lies with the gods. But to-day the strategus Democrates knows
  our customs too well to thrust himself upon an Attic gentlewoman who finds
  herself alone save for one servant.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>kyria</i>; pardon the word, it&rsquo;s overcold;
  <i>makaira</i>, I&rsquo;d say more gladly,&rdquo; Democrates was marvellously
  at his ease despite her frowns, &ldquo;your noble father will take nothing
  amiss if I ask you to sit again that we may talk together.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not think so.&rdquo; Hermione drew herself up at full height.
  But Democrates deliberately placed himself in the path up the hillside. To
  have run toward the water seemed folly. She could expect no help from
  Cleopis, who would hardly oppose a man soon probably to be her master. As the
  less of evils, Hermione did not indeed sit as desired, but stood facing her
  unloved lover and hearkening.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How long I&rsquo;ve desired this instant!&rdquo; Democrates looked
  as if he might seize her hands to kiss them, but she thrust them behind her.
  &ldquo;I know you hate me bitterly because, touching your late husband, I did
  my duty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your duty?&rdquo; Nestor&rsquo;s eloquence was in her incredulous
  echo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I have pained you beyond telling, do you think my act was a
  pleasant one for me? A bosom friend to ruin, the most sacred bonds to sever,
  last and not least, to give infinite sorrow to her I love?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hardly understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates drew a step nearer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! Hera, Artemis, Aphrodite the Golden&mdash;by what name shall I
  call my goddess?&rdquo; Hermione drew back a step. There was danger in his
  eyes. &ldquo;I have loved you, loved you long. Before Glaucon took you in
  marriage I loved you. But Eros and Hymen hearkened to his prayers, not mine.
  You became his bride. I wore a bright face at your wedding. You remember I
  was Glaucon&rsquo;s groomsman, and rode beside you in the bridal car. You
  loved him, he seemed worthy of you. Therefore I trod my own grief down into
  my heart, and rejoiced with my friends. But to cease loving you I could not.
  Truly they say Eros is the strongest god, and pitiless&mdash;do not the poets
  say bloody Ares begat him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Spare me mythologies,&rdquo; interposed Hermione, with another step
  back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As you will, but you shall hearken. I have desired this moment for
  two years. Not as the weak girl given by her father, but as the fair goddess
  who comes to me gladly, I do desire you. And I know you will smile on me when
  you have heard me through.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Keep back your eloquence. You have destroyed Glaucon. That is
  enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hear me.&rdquo; Democrates cried desperately now. Hermione feared
  even to retreat farther, lest he pass to violence. She summoned courage and
  looked him in the eye.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say on, then. But remember I am a woman and alone save for Cleopis.
  If you profess to love me, you will not forget that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Democrates was passing almost beyond the limits of coherent
  speech.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, when you come to me, you will not know what a price I have paid
  for you. In Homer&rsquo;s day men wooed their wives with costly gifts, but
  I&mdash;have I not paid for you with my soul? My soul, I say&mdash;honour,
  friendship, country, what has weighed against Himeros, &lsquo;Master
  Desire,&rsquo;&mdash;the desire ever for you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She hardly understood him, his speech flowed so thick. She knew he was on
  the edge of reason, and feared to answer lest she drive beyond it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you hear the price I have paid? Do you still look on in cold
  hate, lady? Ah, by Zeus, even in your coldest, most forbidding mood you are
  fair as the Paphian when she sprang above the sea! And I will win you, lady,
  I will win your heart, for they shall do you homage, even all Athens, and I
  will make you a queen. Yes! the house of Athena on the Acropolis shall be
  your palace if you will, and they will cry in the Agora, &lsquo;Way, way for
  Hermione, glorious consort of Democrates our king!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; spoke Hermione, while her hands grew chill, for now she
  was sure he raved, &ldquo;I have not the joy to comprehend. There is no king
  in Athens, please Athena, there never will be. Treason and blasphemy you
  speak all in one.&rdquo; She sought vainly with her eyes for refuge. None in
  sight. The hill slope seemed empty save for the scattered brown boulders. Far
  away a goat was wandering. She motioned to Cleopis. The old woman was staring
  now, and doubtless thought Democrates was carrying his familiarities too far,
  but she was a weak creature, and at best could only scream.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Treason and blasphemy,&rdquo; cried Democrates, dropping on his
  knees, his frame shaking with dishonest passion, &ldquo;yes! call them so
  now. They will be blessed truth for me in a month, for me, for you. Hermes
  the Trickster is a mighty god. He has befriended Eros. I shall possess Athens
  and possess you. I shall be the most fortunate mortal upon earth as now I am
  most miserable. Ah! but I have waited so long.&rdquo; He sprang to his feet.
  &ldquo;Tarry, <i>makaira</i>, tarry! A kiss!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hermione screamed at last shrilly and turned to fly. Instantly Democrates
  was upon her. In that fluttering white dress escape was hopeless.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Apollo pursuing Daphne!&rdquo;&mdash;his crazed shout as his arms
  closed around her,&mdash;&ldquo;but Daphne becomes no laurel this time. Her
  race is lost. She shall pay the forfeit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She felt him seize her girdle. He swung her face to face. She saw his wide
  eyes, his mad smile. His hot breath smote her cheek. Cleopis at last was
  screaming.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; he triumphed, while he forced her resisting head to
  his own, &ldquo;there is none to hinder!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But even while the woman&rsquo;s flesh crept back at his impure kiss, a
  giant power came rending the twain apart. A man had sundered them, sprung
  from the ground or from heaven belike, or from behind a boulder? He tore
  Democrates&rsquo;s hands away as a lion tears a lamb. He dashed the mad
  orator prone upon the sod, and kicked him twice, as of mingled hatred and
  contempt. All this Hermione only knew in half, while her senses swam. Then
  she came to herself enough to see that the stranger was a young man in a
  sailor&rsquo;s loose dress, his features almost hidden under the dishevelled
  hair and beard. All this time he uttered no word, but having smitten
  Democrates down, leaped back, rubbing his hands upon his thigh, as if
  despising to touch so foul an object. The orator groaned, staggered upward.
  He wore a sword. It flew from its scabbard as he leaped on the sailor. The
  stranger put forth his hand, snatched his opponent&rsquo;s wrist, and with
  lightning dexterity sent the blade spinning back upon the grass. Then he
  threw Democrates a second time, and the latter did not rise again hastily,
  but lay cursing. The fall had not been gentle.</p>

  <p>But all this while Cleopis was screaming. People were hastening up the
  hill,&mdash;fishermen from a skiff upon the beach, slaves who had been
  carrying bales to the haven. In a moment they would be surrounded by a dozen.
  The strange sailor turned as if to fly. He had not spoken one word. Hermione
  herself at last called to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My preserver! Your name! Blessed be you forever!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The fisherfolk were very close. Cleopis was still screaming. The sailor
  looked once into the lady&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am nameless! You owe me nothing!&rdquo; And with that he was gone
  up the hill slopes, springing with long bounds that would have mocked
  pursuing, had any attempted. But Cleopis quenched her outcry instantly; her
  screams had been drowned by a louder scream from Hermione, who fell upon the
  greensward, no marble whiter than her face. The nurse ran to her mistress.
  Democrates staggered to his feet. Whatever else the chastisement had given
  him, it had restored his balance of mind. He told the fisherfolk a glib story
  that a sailor wandering along the strand had accosted Hermione, that he
  himself had chased the villain off, but had tripped whilst trying to follow.
  If the tale was not of perfect workmanship at all points, there was no one
  with interest to gainsay it. A few ran up the hill slope, but the sailor was
  nowhere in sight. Hermione was still speechless. They made a litter of oars
  and sail-cloth and carried her to her mother. Democrates oiled
  Cleopis&rsquo;s palm well, that she should tell nothing amiss to Lysistra. It
  was a long time before Hermione opened her eyes in her chamber. Her first
  words were:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon! I have seen Glaucon!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have had a strange dream, <i>philotata</i>,&rdquo; soothed
  Lysistra, shifting the pillows, &ldquo;lie still and rest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Hermione shook her shining brown head and repeated, many
  times:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No dream! No dream! I have seen Glaucon face to face. In that
  instant he spoke and looked on me I knew him. He lives. He saved me. Ah! why
  does he stay away?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lysistra, whose husband had not deemed it prudent to inform her of
  Themistocles&rsquo;s revelations, was infinitely distressed. She sent for the
  best physicians of the city, and despatched a slave to the temple of
  Asclepius at Epidaurus&mdash;not distant&mdash;to sacrifice two cocks for her
  daughter&rsquo;s recovery. The doctors looked wise and recommended heavy
  doses of spiced wine, and if those did not suffice, said that the patient
  might spend a night in the temple of the Healer, who would no doubt explain
  the true remedy in a dream. A &ldquo;wise woman&rdquo; who had great
  following among the slaves advised that a young puppy be tied upon
  Hermione&rsquo;s temples to absorb the disaffection of her brain. Lysistra
  was barely persuaded not to follow her admonitions. After a few days the
  patient grew better, recovered strength, took an interest in her child. Yet
  ever and anon she would repeat over Ph&oelig;nix&rsquo;s cradle:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your father lives! I have seen him! I have seen him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>What, however, puzzled Lysistra most, was the fact that Cleopis did not
  contradict her young mistress in the least, but maintained a mysterious
  silence about the whole adventure.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch34"
     name="ch34"></a>XXXIV. -- THE LOYALTY OF LAMPAXO</h2>

  <p class="first">The night after his adventure on the hill slope Democrates
  received in his chambers no less an individual than Hiram. That industrious
  Ph&oelig;nician had been several days in Tr&oelig;zene, occupied in a manner
  he and his superior discreetly kept to themselves. The orator had a bandage
  above one eye, where a heavy sandal had kicked him. He was exceedingly pale,
  and sat in the arm-chair propped with pillows. That he had awaited Hiram
  eagerly, betrayed itself by the promptness with which he cut short the
  inevitable salaam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, my dear rascal, have you found him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May it please your Excellency to hearken to even the least of your
  slaves?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you hear, fox?&mdash;have you found him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My Lord shall judge for himself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cerberus eat you, fellow,&mdash;though you&rsquo;d be a poisonous
  mouthful,&mdash;tell your story in as few words as possible. I
  <i>know</i>that he is lurking about Tr&oelig;zene.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Compassion, your Lordship, compassion,&rdquo;&mdash;Hiram seemed
  washing his hands in oil, they waved so soothingly&mdash;&ldquo;if your
  Benignity will grant it, I have a very worthy woman here who, I think, can
  tell a story that will be interesting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In with her, then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The person Hiram escorted into the room proved to be no more nor less than
  Lampaxo. Two years had not removed the wrinkles from her cheek, the sharpness
  from her nose, the rasping from her tongue. At sight of her Democrates half
  rose from his seat and held out his hand affably, the demagogue&rsquo;s
  instinct uppermost.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! my good dame, whom do I recognize? Are you not the wife of our
  excellent fishmonger, Phormio? A truly sterling man, and how, pray, is your
  good husband?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poorly, poorly, <i>kyrie</i>.&rdquo; Lampaxo looked down and
  fumbled her dirty chiton. Such condescension on the part of a magnate barely
  less than Themistocles or Aristeides was overpowering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poorly? I grieve to learn it. I was informed that he was
  comfortably settled here until it was safe to return to Attica, and had even
  opened a prosperous stall in the market-place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course, <i>kyrie</i>; and the trade, considering the times, is
  not so bad&mdash;Athena be praised&mdash;and he&rsquo;s not sick in body.
  It&rsquo;s worse, far worse. I was even on the point of going to your
  Lordship to state my misgivings, when your good friend, the Ph&oelig;nician,
  fell into my company, and I found he was searching for the very thing I
  wanted to reveal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Democrates leaned forward and battled against his
  impatience,&mdash;&ldquo;and what is the matter wherein I can be of service
  to so deserving a citizen as your husband?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I fear me,&rdquo;&mdash;Lampaxo put her apron dutifully to her face
  and began to sniff,&mdash;&ldquo;your Excellency won&rsquo;t call him
  &lsquo;deserving&rsquo; any more. Hellas knows your Excellency is patriotism
  itself. The fact is Phormio has &lsquo;Medized.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Medized!&rdquo; The orator started as became an actor. &ldquo;Gods
  and goddesses! what trust is in men if Phormio the Athenian has
  Medized?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hear my story, <i>mu! mu!</i>&rdquo; groaned Lampaxo.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a terrible thing to accuse one&rsquo;s own husband, but
  duty to Hellas is duty. Your Excellency is a merciful man, if he could only
  warn Phormio in private.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woman,&rdquo;&mdash;Democrates pulled his most consequential
  frown,&mdash;&ldquo;Medizing is treason. On your duty as a daughter of Athens
  I charge you tell everything, then rely on my wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly, <i>kyrie</i>, certainly,&rdquo; gasped Lampaxo, and so
  she began a recital mingled with many moans and protestations, which
  Democrates dared not bid her hasten.</p>

  <p>The good woman commenced by reminding the strategus how he had visited her
  and her brother Polus to question them as to the doings of the Babylonish
  carpet merchant, and how it had seemed plain to them that Glaucon was nothing
  less than a traitor. Next she proceeded to relate how her husband had enabled
  the criminal to fly by sea, and her own part therein&mdash;for she loudly
  accused herself of treason in possessing a guilty knowledge of the
  outlaw&rsquo;s manner of escape. As for Bias, he had just now gone on a
  message to Megara, but Democrates would surely castigate his own slave.
  &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; wound up Lampaxo, &ldquo;the traitor seemed drowned, and
  his treason locked up in Phorcys&rsquo;s strong box, and so I said nothing
  about him. More&rsquo;s the pity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The more reason for concealing nothing now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Zeus strike me if I keep back anything. It&rsquo;s now about ten
  days since <i>he</i> returned.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;He?&rsquo; Whom do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not overeasy to tell, <i>kyrie</i>. He calls himself
  Critias, and wears a long black beard and tangled hair. Phormio brought him
  home one evening&mdash;said he was the <i>proreus</i> of a Melian trireme
  caulking at Epidaurus, but was once in the fish trade at Peiræus and an old
  friend. I told Phormio we had enough these days to fill our own bellies, but
  my husband would be hospitable. I had to bring out my best honey cakes. Your
  Lordship knows I take just pride in my honey cakes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Beyond doubt,&rdquo;&mdash;Democrates&rsquo;s hand twitched with
  impatience,&mdash;&ldquo;but tell of the stranger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At once, <i>kyrie</i>; well, we all sat down to sup. Phormio kept
  pressing wine on the fellow as if we had not only one little jar of yellow
  Rhodian in the cellar. All the time the sailor barely spoke a few words of
  island Doric, but my heart misgave. He seemed so refined, so handsome. And
  near the roots of his hair it was not so dark&mdash;as if dyed and needing
  renewal. Trust a woman&rsquo;s eyes for that. When supper was over Phormio
  orders me, &lsquo;Up the ladder and to bed. I&rsquo;ll come shortly, but
  leave a blanket and pillow for our friend who sleeps on the hearth.&rsquo;
  Your Excellency knows we hired a little house on the &lsquo;Carpenter&rsquo;s
  Street,&rsquo; very reasonably you will grant&mdash;only half a minæ for the
  winter. I gave the stranger a fine pillow and a blanket embroidered by
  Stephanium, she was my great-aunt, and left it to me by will, and the
  beautiful red wool was from Byzantium&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you spoke of Critias?&rdquo; Democrates could scarce keep upon
  his seat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>kyrie</i>. Well, I warned Phormio not to give him any more
  wine. Then I went up the ladder. O Mother Demeter, how sharply I listened,
  but the rascals spoke too low together for me to catch anything, save that
  Critias had dropped his Doric and spoke good Attic now. At last Phormio came
  up to me, and I pretended to snore. In the morning, lo! the scoundrelly
  stranger had slipped away. In the evening he returns late. Phormio harbours
  him again. So for several nights, coming late, going early. Then to-night he
  comes a bit before his wont. He and Phormio drank more than common. After
  Phormio sent me away, they talked a long time and in louder voice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You overheard?&rdquo; Democrates gripped his arm-chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>kyrie</i>, blessed be Athena! The stranger spoke pure Attic
  such as your Excellency might use. Many times I heard Hermione named, and
  yourself once&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And how?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The stranger said: &lsquo;So she will not wed Democrates. She
  loathes him. Aphrodite shed joy on her forever.&rsquo; Then Phormio answered
  him, &lsquo;Therefore, dear Glaucon, you should trust the gods a little
  longer.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Glaucon,&rsquo; said he?&rdquo; Democrates leaped from the
  chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Glaucon,&rsquo; on my oath by the Styx. Then I covered my
  head and wept. I knew my husband harboured the arch-traitor. Heaven can tell
  how he escaped the sea. As soon as Phormio was sleeping snug beside me, I
  went down the ladder, intending to call the watch. In the street I met a man,
  this good Ph&oelig;nician here,&mdash;he explained he was suspecting this
  &lsquo;Critias&rsquo; himself, and lurked about in hopes of tracing him in
  the morning. I told my story. He said it was best to come straight to you.
  And now I have accused my own husband, Excellency. <i>Ai!</i> was wife ever
  harder beset? Phormio is a kindly and commonly obedient man, even if he
  doesn&rsquo;t know the value of an obol. You will be
  merciful&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; commanded Democrates, with portentous gravity,
  &ldquo;justice first, mercy later. Do you solemnly swear you heard Phormio
  call this stranger &lsquo;Glaucon&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>kyrie</i>. Woe! woe!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you say he is now asleep in your house?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, the wine has made them both very heavy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have done well.&rdquo; Democrates extended his hand again.
  &ldquo;You are a worthy daughter of Athens. In years to come they will name
  you with King Codrus who sacrificed his life for the freedom of Attica, for
  have you not sacrificed what should be dearer than life,&mdash;the fair name
  of your husband? But courage. Your patriotism may extenuate his crime. Only
  the traitor must be taken.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he was breathing hard when I went out. Ah! seize him
  quickly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Retire,&rdquo; commanded Democrates, with a flourish; &ldquo;leave
  me to concert with this excellent Hiram the means of thwarting I know not
  what gross villany.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The door had hardly closed behind Lampaxo, when Democrates fell as a heap
  into the cushions. He was ashen and palsied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Courage, master,&rdquo;&mdash;Hiram was drawing a suggestive finger
  across his throat,&mdash;&ldquo;the woman&rsquo;s tale is true metal. Critias
  shall sleep snug and sweetly to-night, if perchance too soundly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; shrieked the wretched man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The thing is marvellously simple, master. The night is not yet old.
  Hasdrubal and his crew of Carthaginians are here and by the grace of Baal can
  serve you. This cackling hen will guide us to the house. Heaven has put your
  enemy off his guard. He and Phormio will never wake to feel their throats
  cut. Then a good stone on each foot takes the corpses down in the
  harbour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Democrates dashed his hand in negation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, by the infernal gods, not so! No murder. I cannot bear the
  curse of the Furies. Seize him, carry him to the ends of the earth, to
  hardest slavery. Let him never cross my path again. But no
  bloodshed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hiram almost lost his never failing smile, so much he marvelled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, your Lordship, the man is a giant, mighty as Melkarth.(12)
  Seizing will be hard. Sheol is the safest prison.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[12 The Ph&oelig;nician Hercules.]</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Democrates was still shaking. &ldquo;His ghost came to
  me a thousand times, though yet he lived. It would hound me mad if I murdered
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> would not murder him. Your slave is not afflicted by
  dreams.&rdquo; Hiram&rsquo;s smile was extremely insinuating.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t quibble with words. It would be I who slew him, though
  I never struck the blow. You can seize him. Is he not asleep? Call
  Hasdrubal&mdash;bind Glaucon, gag him, drag him to the ship. But he must not
  die.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very good, Excellency.&rdquo; Hiram seldom quarrelled to no purpose
  with his betters. &ldquo;Let your Lordship deign to leave this small matter
  to his slave. By Baal&rsquo;s favour Hasdrubal and six of his crew sleep on
  shore to-night. Let us pray they be not deep in wine. Wait for me one hour,
  perhaps two, and your heart and liver shall be comforted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go, go! I will wait and pray to Hermes Dolios.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hiram even now did not forget his punctilious salaam before departing.
  Never had he seemed more the beautiful serpent with the shining scales than
  the instant he bent gracefully at Democrates&rsquo;s feet, the red light
  falling on his gleaming ear and nose rings, his smooth brown skin and beady
  eyes. The door turned on its pivots&mdash;closed. Democrates heard the
  retiring footsteps. No doubt the Ph&oelig;nician was taking Lampaxo with him.
  The Athenian staggered across the room to his bed and flung himself on it,
  laughing hysterically. How absolutely his enemy was delivered into his hands!
  How the Moræ in sending that Carthaginian ship, to do Lycon&rsquo;s business
  and his, had provided the means of ridding him of the haunting terror! How
  everything conspired to aid him! He need not even kill Glaucon. He would have
  no blood guiltiness, he need not dread Alecto and her sister Furies. He could
  trust Hiram and Hasdrubal to see to it that Glaucon never returned to plague
  him. And Hermione? Democrates laughed again. He was almost frightened at his
  own glee.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A month, my nymph, a month, and you and your dear father, yes,
  Themistocles himself, will be in no state to answer me
  &lsquo;nay,&rsquo;&mdash;though Glaucon come to claim you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Thus he lay a long time, while the drip, drip from the water-clock in the
  corner told how the night was passing. The lamp flickered and burned lower.
  He never knew the hours to creep so slowly.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At last, a knock; Scodrus, the yawning valet, ushering in a
  black and bearded sailor, who crouched eastern fashion at the feet of the
  strategus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have seized him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blessed be Moloch, Baal, and Melkarth! They have poured sleep upon
  my Lord&rsquo;s enemy.&rdquo; The sailor&rsquo;s Greek was harsh and
  execrable. &ldquo;Your servants did even as commanded. The woman let us in.
  The young man my Lord hates was bound and gagged almost ere he could waken,
  likewise the fishmonger was seized.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bravely done. I never forget good service. And the
  woman?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is retained likewise. I have hastened hither to learn the
  further will of my Lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates arose hastily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My himation, staff, and shoes, boy!&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;I
  will go forth myself. The prisoners are still at the fishmonger&rsquo;s
  house?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Even so, Excellency.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I go back with you. I must see this stranger with my own eyes.
  There must be no mistake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Scodrus stared widely when he saw his master go out into the dark, for his
  only escort a black Carthaginian sailor with a dirk a cubit long. Democrates
  did not even ask for a lantern. None of the servants could fathom their
  master&rsquo;s doings of late. He gave strappings when they asked questions,
  and Bias was away.</p>

  <p>The streets of Tr&oelig;zene were utterly deserted when Democrates
  threaded them. There was no moon, neither he nor his companion were
  overcertain of the way. Once they missed the right turn, wandered down a
  blind alley, and plunged into a pile of offal awaiting the scavenger dogs.
  But finally the seaman stopped at a low door in a narrow street, and a triple
  rap made it open. The scene was squalid. A rush-candle was burning on a
  table. Around it squatted seven men who rose and bowed as the strategus
  entered. In the dim flicker he could just recognize the burly shipmaster
  Hasdrubal and gigantic Hib, the Libyan &ldquo;governor,&rdquo; whose ebon
  face betrayed itself even there.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have expected you, <i>kyrie</i>,&rdquo; said Hiram, who was one
  of the group.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks be to Hermes and to you all. I have told my guide already I
  will be grateful. Where is he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the kitchen behind, your Lordship. We were singularly favoured.
  Hib had the cord around his arms before he wakened. He could scarcely
  struggle despite his power. The fishmonger awoke before Hasdrubal could nip
  him. For a moment we feared his outcries would rouse the street. But again
  the gods blessed us. No one stirred, and we soon throttled him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take the light,&rdquo; ordered Democrates. &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Accompanied by Hiram, the orator entered the kitchen, a small square room.
  The white-washed ceiling was blacked around the smoke-hole, a few pots and
  pans lay in the corners, a few dying embers gleamed on the hearth. But
  Democrates had eyes only for two objects,&mdash;human figures tightly bound
  lying rigid as faggots in the further corner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which is he?&rdquo; asked Democrates again, stepping softly as
  though going to danger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The further one is Phormio, the nearer is my Lord&rsquo;s enemy.
  Your Excellency need not fear to draw close. He is quite secure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give me the candle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates held the light high and trod gently over to the prostrate men.
  Hiram spoke rightly that his victim was secure. They had lashed him hand and
  foot, using small chains in lieu of cords. A bit of wood had been thrust into
  his mouth and tied with twine under the ears. Democrates stood an instant
  looking down, then very deliberately knelt beside the prisoner and moved the
  candle closer. He could see now the face hidden half by the tangled black
  hair and beard and the gag&mdash;but who could doubt it?&mdash;the deep blue
  eye, the chiselled profile, the small, fine lips, yes, and the godlike form
  visible in its comeliness despite the bands. He was gazing upon the man who
  two years ago had called him &ldquo;bosom-friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The prisoner looked straight upward. The only thing he could move was his
  eyes, and these followed Democrates&rsquo;s least motion. The orator pressed
  the candle closer yet. He even put out his hand, and touched the face to
  brush away the hair. A long look&mdash;and he was satisfied. No mistake was
  possible. Democrates arose and stood over the prisoner, then spoke aloud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon, I have played at dice with Fortune. I have conquered. I
  did not ruin you willingly. There was no other way. A man must first be a
  friend to himself, and then friendly to others. I have cast in my lot with
  the Persians. It was I who wrote that letter which blasted you at Colonus.
  Very soon there will be a great battle fought in B&oelig;otia. Lycon and I
  will make it certain that Mardonius conquers. I am to be tyrant of Athens.
  Hermione shall be my wife.&rdquo; The workings of the prisoner&rsquo;s face
  made Democrates wince; from Glaucon&rsquo;s throat came rattlings, his eyes
  were terrible. But the other drove recklessly forward. &ldquo;As for you, you
  pass this night out of my life. How you escaped the sea I know not and care
  less. Hasdrubal will take you to Carthage, and sell you into the interior of
  Libya. I wish you no misery, only you go where you shall never see Hellas
  again. I am merciful. Your life is in my hands. But I restore it. I am
  without blood guiltiness. What I have done you would have done, had you loved
  as I&mdash;had you been under necessity as I. Eros is a great god, but
  Anangkë, Dame Necessity, is yet mightier. So to-night we
  part&mdash;farewell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A strong spasm passed through the prisoner&rsquo;s frame. For a moment
  Democrates thought the bonds would snap. Too strong. The orator swung on his
  heel and returned to the outer room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The night wanes, <i>kyrie</i>,&rdquo; remarked Hasdrubal; &ldquo;if
  these good people are to be taken to the ship, it must be soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As you will. I do nothing more concerning them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fetch down the woman,&rdquo; ordered Hasdrubal; in the mongrel
  Greek current amongst Mediterranean sea-folk. Two of his seamen ascended the
  ladder and returned with Lampaxo, who smirked and simpered at sight of
  Democrates and bobbed him a courtesy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The traitor is seized, your Excellency. I hope your Excellency will
  see that he drinks hemlock. You will be merciful to my poor husband, even if
  he must be arrested for the night. Gods and goddesses! what are these men
  doing to me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A stalwart Carthaginian was in the act of knotting a cord around the good
  woman&rsquo;s arms preparatory to pinioning them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Kyrie! kyrie!</i>&rdquo; she screamed, &ldquo;they are binding
  me, too! Me&mdash;the most loyal woman in Attica.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates scowled and turned his back on her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your Lordship surely intended this woman to be taken also,&rdquo;
  suggested Hiram, sweetly. &ldquo;It cannot be he will leave such a dangerous
  witness at large.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course not. Off with her!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Kyrie! kyrie!</i>&rdquo; was her shriek, but quickly ended, for
  Hasdrubal knitted his fingers around her throat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A gag,&rdquo; he ordered, and with a few more struggles Lampaxo
  stood helpless and silent.</p>

  <p>A little later the band was threading its stealthy way down the black
  streets. Four of the Carthaginians carried Glaucon, slung hands and feet over
  a pole. They dared not trust him on his feet. Phormio and Lampaxo walked,
  closely pinioned and pricked on by the captain&rsquo;s dagger. They were soon
  at the deserted strand, and their ship&rsquo;s pinnace lay upon the beach.
  Democrates accompanied them as far as the dark marge, and watched while the
  boat glided out into the gloom of the haven. The orator paced homeward alone.
  Everything had favoured him. He had even cleared himself of the curse of the
  Furies and the pursuit of Nemesis. He had, he congratulated himself, shown
  marvellous qualities of mercy. Glaucon lived? Yes&mdash;but the parching
  sand-plains of Libya would be as fast a prison as the grave, and the life of
  a slave in Africa was a short one. Glaucon had passed from his horizon
  forever.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch35"
     name="ch35"></a>XXXV. -- MOLOCH BETRAYS THE PH&OElig;NICIAN</h2>

  <p class="first">Even whilst the boat pulled out to the trader, Hiram
  suggested that since his superior&rsquo;s &ldquo;unfortunate scruples&rdquo;
  forbade them to shed blood, at least they could disable the most dangerous
  captive by putting out his eyes. But Hasdrubal, thrifty Semite, would not
  hearken.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is not the fellow worth five hundred shekels in the Carthage
  market?&mdash;but who will give two for a blind dog?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And once at the ship the prisoners were stowed in the hold so securely
  that even Hiram ceased to concern himself. In the morning some of the
  neighbours indeed wondered at Phormio&rsquo;s closed door and the silence of
  the jangling voice of Lampaxo; but the fishmonger was after all an exile, and
  might have returned suddenly to Attica, now the Persians had retreated again
  to B&oelig;otia, and before these surmises could change to misdoubting, the
  <i>Bozra</i> was bearing forth into the Ægean.</p>

  <p>The business of Hasdrubal with the <i>Bozra</i> at Tr&oelig;zene appeared
  simple. The war had disturbed the Greek harvests. He had come accordingly
  with a cargo of African corn, and was taking a light return lading of olive
  oil and salt fish. But those who walked along the harbour front remarked that
  the <i>Bozra</i> was hardly a common merchantman. She was a
  &ldquo;sea-mouse,&rdquo; long, shallow, and very fast under sail; she also
  carried again an unwontedly heavy crew. When Hasdrubal&rsquo;s cargo seemed
  completed, he lingered a couple of days, alleging he was repairing a cable;
  then the third morning after his nocturnal adventure a cipher letter to
  Democrates sent the Carthaginian to sea. The letter went thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lycon, in the camp of the Greeks in B&oelig;otia, to Democrates in
  Tr&oelig;zene, greeting:&mdash;The armies have now faced many days. The
  soothsayers declare that the aggressor is sure to be defeated, still there
  has been some skirmishing in which your Athenians slew Masistes,
  Mardonius&rsquo;s chief of cavalry. This, however, is no great loss to us.
  Your presence with Aristeides is now urgently needed. Send Hasdrubal and
  Hiram at once to Asia with the papers we arranged in Corinth. Come yourself
  with speed to the army. Ten days and this merry dice-throwing is ended.
  <i>Chaire!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates immediately after this gave Hiram a small packet of papyrus
  sheets rolled very tight, with the ominous injunction to &ldquo;conceal
  carefully, weight it with lead, and fling it overboard if there is danger of
  capture.&rdquo; At which Hiram bowed more elegantly than usual and answered,
  &ldquo;Fear not; it shall be guarded as the priests guard the ark of Moloch,
  and when next your slave comes, it is to salute my Lord as the sovran of
  Athens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hiram smiled fulsomely and departed. An hour later the <i>Bozra</i> ran
  out on the light wind around the point of Calauria and into the sparkling sea
  to eastward. Democrates stood gazing after her until she was a dark speck on
  the horizon.</p>

  <p>The speck at last vanished. The strategus walked homeward. Glaucon was
  gone. The fateful packet binding Democrates irrevocably to the Persian cause
  was gone. He could not turn back. At the gray of morning with a few servants
  he quitted Tr&oelig;zene, and hastened to join Aristeides and Pausanias in
  B&oelig;otia.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In the hold of the <i>Bozra</i>, where Hasdrubal had stowed
  his unwilling passengers, there crept just enough sunlight to make darkness
  visible. The gags had been removed from the prisoners, suffering them to eat,
  whereupon Lampaxo had raised a truly prodigious outcry which must needs be
  silenced by a vigorous anointing with Hasdrubal&rsquo;s whip of
  bullock&rsquo;s hide. Her husband and Glaucon disdained to join a clamour
  which could never escape the dreary cavern of the hold, and which only drew
  the hoots of their unmagnanimous guardians. The Carthaginians had not
  misinterpreted Glaucon&rsquo;s silence, however. They knew well they had a
  Titan in custody, and did not even unlash his hands. His feet and
  Phormio&rsquo;s were tied between two beams in lieu of stocks. The giant Hib
  took it upon himself to feed them bean porridge with a wooden spoon, making
  the dainty sweeter with tales of the parching heats of Africa and the life of
  a slave under Libyan task-masters.</p>

  <p>So one day, another, and another, while the <i>Bozra</i> rocked at anchor,
  and the prisoners knew that liberty lay two short cable lengths away, yet
  might have been in Atlantis for all it profited them. Phormio never reviled
  his wife as the author of their calamity, and Lampaxo, with nigh childish
  earnestness, would protest that surely Democrates knew not what the sailors
  did when they bound her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So noble a patriot! An evil god bewitched him into letting these
  harpies take us. Woe! woe! What misfortune!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To which plaint the others only smiled horribly and ground their
  teeth.</p>

  <p>Phormio as well as Glaucon had heard the avowal of Democrates on the night
  of the seizure. There was no longer any doubt of the answer to the great
  riddle. But disheartening, benumbing beyond all personal anguish was the
  dread for Hellas. The sacrifice at Thermopylæ vain. The glory of Salamis
  vain. Hellas and Athens enslaved. The will of Xerxes and Mardonius
  accomplished not because of their valour, but because of their enemies&rsquo;
  infamy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O gods, if indeed there be gods!&rdquo; Glaucon was greatly
  doubting that at last; &ldquo;if ye have any power, if justice, truth, and
  honour weigh against iniquity, put that power forth, or never claim the
  prayers and sacrifice of men again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon was past dreading for himself. He prayed that Hermione might be
  spared a long life of tears, and that Artemis might slay her quickly by her
  silent arrows. To follow his thoughts in all their dark mazes were
  profitless. Suffice it that the night which had brooded over his soul from
  the hour he fled from Colonus was never so dark as now. He was too despairing
  even to curse.</p>

  <p>The last hope fled when they heard the rattling of the cables weighing
  anchor. Soon the soft slap of the water around the bow and the regular
  heaving motion told that the <i>Bozra</i> was under way. The sea-mouse
  creaked and groaned through all her timbers and her lading. The foul
  bilge-water made the hold stifling as a charnel-house. Lampaxo, Hib being
  absent, began to howl and moan.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Queen Hera! O Queen Hera, I die for a breath of air&mdash;I, the
  most patriotic woman in Athens!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silence, goodwife,&rdquo; muttered Phormio, twisting desperately on
  the filthy straw under him. &ldquo;Have I not enough to fret about without
  the addition of your pipings?&rdquo; And he muttered underbreath the old saw
  of Hesiod:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;He who doth a woman trust,<br>
  Doth trust a den of thieves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silence below there, you squealing sow,&rdquo; ordered Hib, from
  the hatchway. &ldquo;Must I tan your hide again?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lampaxo subsided. Phormio tugged vainly at his feet in the stocks. Glaucon
  said nothing. A terrible hope had come to him. If he could not speedily die,
  at least he would soon go mad, and that would rescue him from his most
  terrible enemy&mdash;himself.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The <i>Bozra</i>, it has been said, headed not south but
  eastward. Hasdrubal&rsquo;s commission was to fetch Samos, where the still
  formidable fleet of the Barbarian lay, and to put the precious packet from
  Democrates in the hands of Tigranes, Xerxes&rsquo;s commander-in-chief on the
  coast of Asia Minor. But although speed had been enjoined, the voyage did not
  go prosperously. Off Belbina the wind deserted them altogether, and Hasdrubal
  had been compelled to force his craft along by sweeps,&mdash;ponderous oars,
  worked by three men,&mdash;but his progress at best was slow. Off Cythnos the
  breeze had again arisen, but it was the Eurus from the southeast, worse than
  useless; the <i>Bozra</i> had been obliged to ride at anchor off the island
  for two days. Then another calm; and at last, &ldquo;because,&rdquo; said
  Hasdrubal piously, &ldquo;he had vowed two black lambs to the Wind
  God,&rdquo; the breeze came clear and cool from the north, which, if not
  wholly favourable, enabled the merchantman to plough onward. It was the fifth
  day, finally, after quitting Tr&oelig;zene, that the headlands of Naxos came
  in sight at dawn, and the master began to take comfort. The fleet of the
  Greeks&mdash;a fisherboat had told him&mdash;was swinging inactive at Delos
  well to the north and westward, and he could fairly consider himself in
  waters dominated by the king.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fortunate voyage,&rdquo; the master was boasting to Hiram, as he
  sat at breakfast in the stern-cabin above a platter of boiled dolphin;
  &ldquo;two talents from the Persians for acting as their messenger; a
  thousand drachmæ profit on the corn; a hundred from Master Democrates in
  return for our little service, not to mention the profit on the return cargo,
  and last but not least the three slaves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, the three slaves. I had almost forgotten about
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see, my dear Hiram,&rdquo; quoth the master, betwixt two
  unwontedly huge mouthfuls, &ldquo;you see what folly it was of you to suggest
  putting out that handsome fellow&rsquo;s eyes. I am strongly thinking of
  selling him not to Carthage, but to Babylon. I know a trader at Ephesus who
  makes a specialty of handsome youths. The satrap Artabozares has commissioned
  him to find as many good-looking out-runners as possible. Also for his
  harem&mdash;if this Glaucon were only a eunuch&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hiram, breaking a large disk of bread, was smiling very suggestively
  before making reply, when a sailor shouted at the hatch:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ships, master! Ships with oars!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In what quarter?&rdquo; Hasdrubal sprang up, letting the dishes
  clatter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From Myconus. They come up fast. Hib at the masthead counts eleven
  triremes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Baal preserve us!&rdquo; The master at once clambered on deck.
  &ldquo;The Greek fleet may be quitting Delos. We must pray for
  wind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was a gray, hazy day after a dozen bright ones. The northerly breeze
  seemed falling. The water spread out a sombre lead colour. The heights of
  Naxos were in sight to starboard, but none too clearly. Much more interesting
  to Hasdrubal was the line of dots spreading on the horizon to northwest.
  Despite the distance his keen eyes could catch the rise and fall of the oar
  banks&mdash;war-ships, not traders. Hib was right, and Hasdrubal&rsquo;s face
  grew longer. No triremes save the Greeks could be bearing thither, and a
  merchantman, even from nominally neutral Carthage, caught headed for the
  king&rsquo;s coasts in those days of blazing war was nothing if not fair
  prize. The master&rsquo;s decision was prompt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are far off. Put the ship before the wind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The sea-mouse was fleet indeed for a trader, but unlike a trireme must
  count on her canvas for her speed. With a piping breeze she could mock
  pursuit. In a calm she was fearfully handicapped. However, for a moment
  Hasdrubal congratulated himself he could slip away unnoticed. The distance
  was very great. Then his dark lips cursed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Moloch consume me! If I see aright, we are chased.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Two vessels, in fact, seemed turning away from the rest. They were heading
  straight after the <i>Bozra</i>. A long race it would be, but with the gale
  so light the chances were against the sea-mouse. Hasdrubal had no need to
  urge his crew to rig out the oars and tug furiously, if they wished to escape
  a Greek prison and a slave market.</p>

  <p>The whole crew, forty black-visaged, black-eyed creatures, were soon busy
  over the dozen great sweeps in a frantic attempt to force the
  <i>Bozra</i>beyond danger. Panting, yelling, blaspheming, for a while they
  seemed holding their own, but the master watched with sinking heart the
  waning breeze. At the end of an hour their pursuers could be
  distinguished,&mdash;a tall trireme behind, but closer, pulling more rapidly,
  a penteconter, a slim scouting galley working fifty oars in a single
  bank.</p>

  <p>Hasdrubal began to shout desperately: &ldquo;Wind, Baal, wind! Fill the
  sails, and seven he-goats await thy altar in Carthage!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Either the god found the bribe too small or lacked the power to accept it.
  The breeze did not stiffen. The sailors strove like demons at the sweeps, but
  almost imperceptibly the gap betwixt them and the war-ships was
  narrowing.</p>

  <p>Hiram, who had been rowing, now left his post to approach the master.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What of the captives? Crucifixion waits us all if they are found on
  the ship and tell their story. Kill them at once and fling the bodies
  overboard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hasdrubal shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not yet. Still a good chance. I&rsquo;ll not cast five hundred
  bright shekels to the fish till harder pressed. The breeze may
  strengthen.&rdquo; Then he redoubled his shout. &ldquo;Wind, Baal,
  wind!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But a little later the gap betwixt the sea-mouse and the penteconter had
  so dwindled that even the master&rsquo;s inborn thrift began to yield to
  prudence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hark you, Hib,&rdquo; he cried from the helm. &ldquo;Take Adherbal
  and Lars the Etruscan. It&rsquo;s a good ten furlongs to that cursed galley
  still, but we must have those prisoners ready on deck. Over they go if the
  chase gets a bit closer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The giant Libyan hastened to comply, while all the crew joined in the
  captain&rsquo;s howl, &ldquo;Wind, Baal, wind!&rdquo; and cried reckless
  vows, while they scanned the fateful stretch of gray-green water behind the
  stern, whereon liberty if not life depended.</p>

  <p>The trireme, pulling only one of her banks, was dropping behind, her
  navarch leaving the tiring chase to the penteconter, but the latter hung on
  doggedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curse those war-ships with their long oars and heavy crews,&rdquo;
  growled Hib, reappearing above the hatch with the prisoners. &ldquo;The
  penteconter&rsquo;s only nine furlongs off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had been obliged to release the captives from the stocks, but Hib had
  taken the precaution to place on the formidable athlete a pair of leg irons
  joined by a shackle. Not merely were Glaucon&rsquo;s arms pinioned by a stout
  cord, but the great Libyan was gripping them tightly. Lars and Adherbal
  conducted the other prisoners, whose feet, however, were not bound. For a
  moment the three captives stood blinking at the unfamiliar light, unconscious
  of the situation and their extremity, whilst Hasdrubal for the fortieth time
  measured the distance. The wind had strengthened a little. Let it strengthen
  a trifle more and the <i>Bozra</i> would hold her own. Still her people were
  nearly spent with their toiling, and the keen beak and large complement of
  the man-of-war made resistance madness if she once came alongside.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have ready sand-bags,&rdquo; ordered Hasdrubal, &ldquo;to tie to
  these wretches&rsquo; feet. Set them by the boat mast, so the sail can hide
  our pretty deed from the penteconter. Have ready an axe. We&rsquo;ll bide a
  little longer, though, before we say &lsquo;farewell&rsquo; to our
  passengers. The gods may help yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hib and his fellows were marching the prisoners to the poop, when the
  sight of the war-ship told Phormio all the story. No gag now hindered his
  tongue.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, dragons from Carthage, are you going to murder us?&rdquo; he
  began in tones more indignant than terrified.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, save as Heaven enjoins it!&rdquo; quoth the master, clapping
  his hands to urge on the rowing stroke. &ldquo;Pray, then, your Æolus,
  Hellene, to stiffen the breeze.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pray, then, to Pluto, whelps,&rdquo; bawled the undaunted
  fishmonger, &ldquo;to give you a snug berth in Orcus. Ha! but it&rsquo;s a
  merry thought of you and all your pretty lads stretched on crosses and
  waiting for the crows.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But a violent screech came from Lampaxo, who had just comprehended the
  fate awaiting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ai! ai!</i> save me, fellow-Hellenes!&rdquo; she bawled toward
  the penteconter, &ldquo;a citizeness of Athens, the most patriotic woman in
  the city, slaughtered by Barbarians&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silence the squealing sow!&rdquo; roared Hasdrubal.
  &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll hear her on the war-ship. Aft with her and overboard at
  once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But as they dragged Lampaxo on the poop, her outcry rose to a tempest till
  Lars the Etruscan clapped his hand upon her mouth. Her screaming stilled, but
  his own outcry more than replaced it. In a twinkling the virago&rsquo;s hard
  teeth closed over his fingers. Two ran from the oars to him. But the woman,
  conscious that she fought for life or death, held fast. Curses, blows, even a
  dagger pried betwixt her lips&mdash;all bootless. She seemed as a thing
  possessed. And all the time the Etruscan howled in mortal agony.</p>

  <p>The thin dagger, bent too hard, snapped betwixt her teeth. Lars&rsquo;s
  clamour could surely be heard on the penteconter. Again the breeze was
  falling.</p>

  <p>They seized the fury&rsquo;s throat, and pressed it till she turned black,
  but the grip of her jaw only tightened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Attatai! attatai!</i>&rdquo; groaned the victim, &ldquo;forbear.
  Don&rsquo;t throttle her. Her teeth are iron. They are biting through the
  bone. If you strangle her, they will never relax. <i>Attatai!
  attatai!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nip him tight, little wife,&rdquo; called Phormio, for once
  regarding his spouse with supreme satisfaction. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dainty
  morsel you have in your mouth. Chew it well!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lampaxo&rsquo;s attackers paused an instant, uncertain how to release the
  Etruscan. To their threats of torture the woman was deaf as the mainmast, and
  still the Etruscan screamed.</p>

  <p>Glaucon had stood perfectly passive during all this grim by-play. Once
  Phormio saw his fellow-captive&rsquo;s face twist into a smile, but in the
  excitement of the moment the fishmonger as well as the Carthaginians almost
  forgot the Isthmionices, and Hib relaxed his grip and guard. Lars&rsquo;s
  finger was streaming red, when Hasdrubal threw away the steering-paddle in a
  rage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silence her forever! The axe, Hib. Split her skull open!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The axe lay at the Libyan&rsquo;s feet. One instant, only one, betook his
  hands from the athlete&rsquo;s wrists to seize the weapon, but in that
  instant the yell from all the crew drowned even the howls of Lars. Had any
  watched, they might have seen all the muscles in the Alcmæonid&rsquo;s
  glorious body contract, might have seen the fire spring from his eyes as he
  put forth a godlike might. Heracles and Athena Polias had been with him when
  he threw his strength upon the bands that held his arms. The crushing of
  Lycon down had been no feat like this. In a twinkling the cords about his
  wrists were snapped. He swung his free hands in the air.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Athens!&rdquo; he shouted, whilst the crew stood spellbound.
  &ldquo;Hermione! Glaucon is still Glaucon!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hib had grasped the axe, but he never knew what smote him once behind the
  ear and sent him rolling lifeless against the bulwark. In an instant his
  bright weapon was swinging high above the athlete&rsquo;s head. Glaucon stood
  terrible as Achilles before the cowering Trojans.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woe! woe! he is Melkarth. We are lost men!&rdquo; groaned the
  crew.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At him, fools!&rdquo; bawled Hasdrubal, first to recover wits,
  &ldquo;his feet are still shackled.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But whilst the master called to them, the axe dashed down upon the
  fetters, and one great stroke smote the coupling-link in twain. The Athenian
  stood a moment looking right and left, the axe dancing as a toy in his grasp,
  and a smile on his face inviting, &ldquo;Prove me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A javelin singing from the hand of Adherbal flew at him. An imperceptible
  bending of the body, a red streak on Glaucon&rsquo;s naked side, and it dug
  into the deck. Yet whilst it quivered, was out again and hurled through the
  Carthaginian&rsquo;s breast and shoulders. He fell in a heap beside the
  Libyan.</p>

  <p>Another howl from the sailors.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not Melkarth, but Baal the Dragon-Slayer. We are lost. Who can
  contend with him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cowards!&rdquo; thundered Hasdrubal, whipping the sword from his
  thigh, &ldquo;do you not know these three sniff our true business? If they
  live when the penteconter comes, it&rsquo;s not prison but Sheol that&rsquo;s
  waiting. Their lives or ours. One rush and we have this madman
  down!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But their terrible adversary gave the master no time to gather his
  myrmidons. One stroke of the axe had already released Phormio, who clutched
  the arms of his wife.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The cabin!&rdquo; the ready-witted fishmonger commanded, and
  Lampaxo, scarce knowing what she did, released her ungentle hold on Lars and
  suffered her husband to drag her down the ladder. Glaucon went last; no man
  loving death enough to come within reach of the axe. Hasdrubal saw his
  victims escaping under his eyes and groaned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is only one hatchway. We must force it. Darts, belaying-pins,
  ballast stones&mdash;fling anything down. It&rsquo;s for life or
  death!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The penteconter is four furlongs away!&rdquo; shrieked a sailor,
  growing gray under his dark skin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And Democrates&rsquo;s despatches are hid in the cabin,&rdquo;
  added Hiram, chattering. &ldquo;If they do not go overboard, our deaths will
  be terrible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hear, King Moloch!&rdquo; called Hasdrubal, lifting his swarthy
  arms to heaven, then striking them with his sword till the blood gushed down,
  &ldquo;suffer us to escape this calamity and I vow thee even my daughter
  Tibaït,&mdash;a child in her tenth year,&mdash;she shall die in thy holy
  furnace a sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hear, Baal! Hear, Moloch!&rdquo; chorussed the crew; and gathering
  courage from necessity seized boat-hooks, oars, dirks, and all other handy
  weapons for their attack.</p>

  <p>But below the released prisoners had not been idle. Never&mdash;Glaucon
  knew it&mdash;had his brain been clearer, his invention more fertile than
  now, and Phormio was not too old to cease to be a valiant helper. The cabin
  was small. A few spears and swords stood in the rack about the mast. The
  athlete bolted the sliding hatch-cover, and tore down the weapons.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Release your wife,&rdquo; he ordered Phormio; &ldquo;yonder sea
  chest is strong. Drag it over to bar the hatch-ladder. Work as Titans if you
  hope for another sun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ai, ai, ai!</i>&rdquo; screeched Lampaxo, who had released
  Lars&rsquo;s fingers only to resume her din, &ldquo;we all perish. They are
  hewing the hatch-cover with their axes. Hera preserve us! The wood splinters.
  We die.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have no time to die,&rdquo; called the athlete, &ldquo;but only
  to save Hellas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A dozen blows beat the frail hatch-cover to splinters. A dark face with
  grinning teeth showed itself. A heavy ballast stone grazed the
  athlete&rsquo;s shoulder, but the intruder fell back with a gurgling in his
  throat, his hands clutching the empty air. Glaucon had sent a heavy spear
  clean through him.</p>

  <p>More ballast stones, but the Titanic Alcmæonid had torn a mattress from a
  bunk, and held it as effective shield. By main force the others dragged the
  chest across to the hatchway, making the entrance doubly narrow. Vainly
  Hasdrubal stormed at his men to rush down boldly. They barely dared to fling
  stones and darts, so fast their adversary sped them back, and to the
  mark.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A god! a god! We fight against Heaven!&rdquo; bleated the
  seamen.</p>

  <p>Their groans were answered by the screechings of Lampaxo through the
  port-hole and the taunts of Phormio.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sing, sing, pretty Pisinoë, sweetest of the sirens,&rdquo; tossed
  the fishmonger, playing his part at Glaucon&rsquo;s side; &ldquo;lure that
  dear penteconter a little nearer. And you, brave, gentle sirs, don&rsquo;t
  try &lsquo;to flay a skinned dog&rsquo; by thrusting down here. Your hands
  are just itching for the nails, I warrant!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hasdrubal redoubled his vows to Moloch. In place of his daughter he
  substituted his son, though the lad was fourteen years old and the darling of
  his parents. But the god was not tempted even now. The attack on the cabin
  had called the sailors from the oars. The penteconter consequently had gained
  fast upon them. The trireme behind was manning her other banks and drawing
  down apace. Hiram cast a hopeless glance toward her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know those &lsquo;eyes&rsquo;&mdash;those red
  hawse-holes&mdash;the <i>Nausicaä</i>. Come what may, Themistocles must not
  read the packet in the cabin. There is one chance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He approached the splintered hatchway and outstretched his
  hands&mdash;weaponless.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, good and gracious Master Glaucon, and your honest friends, your
  gods of Hellas are very great and have delivered us, your poor slaves, into
  your hands. Your friends approach. We will resist no longer. Come on deck;
  and when the ship is taken, entreat the navarch to be merciful and
  generous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; spat Phormio, &ldquo;you write your promises in water,
  or better in oil, black-scaled viper. We know what time of day it is with us,
  and what for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hiram saw Glaucon&rsquo;s hand rise with a javelin, and shrank
  shivering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t hearken. All&rsquo;s lost,&rdquo; he whimpered,
  his smile becoming ghastly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Another rush, men!&rdquo; pleaded Hasdrubal.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lead the charge yourself, master!&rdquo; retorted the seamen,
  sullenly.</p>

  <p>The captain, swinging a cutlass, leaped down the bloodstained hatch. One
  moment the desperate fury of his attack carried Glaucon backward. The two
  fought&mdash;sword against axe&mdash;in doubtful combat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Follow! follow!&rdquo; called Hasdrubal, dashing Phormio aside with
  the flat of his blade. &ldquo;I have him at last!&rdquo; But just as Hiram
  was leading down a dozen more, the athlete&rsquo;s axe swept past the sword,
  and fell like a millstone on the master&rsquo;s skull. He never screamed as
  he crashed upon the planks.</p>

  <p>This was enough. The seamen were at the end of their valour. If they must
  die, they must die. What use resisting destiny?</p>

  <p>Slowly, slowly the moments crept for the three in the cabin. Even Lampaxo
  grew still. They heard Hiram pleading frantically, vainly, for another
  attempt, and raving strange things about Democrates, Lycon, and the Persian.
  Then behind the <i>Bozra</i> sounded the rushing of foam around a ram, the
  bumping of fifty oars plying on the thole-pins. Into their sight shot the
  penteconter, the brass glistening on her prow, the white blades leaping in
  rhythm. Marines in armour stood on the forecastle. A few arrows pattered on
  the plankings of the <i>Bozra</i>. Her abject crew obeyed the demand to
  surrender. Their helmsman pushed over the steering-paddle, and flung himself
  upon the deck. The sea-mouse went up into the wind. The grappling-irons
  rattled over the bulwark. Glaucon heard the Ph&oelig;nicians whining,
  &ldquo;Mercy! mercy!&rdquo; as they embraced the boarders&rsquo; feet, then
  the <i>proreus</i>, in hearty Attic, calling, &ldquo;Secure the prisoners and
  rummage the prize!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon had suffered many things of late. He had faced intolerable
  captivity, immediate death. Now around his eyes swam hot mist. He fell upon a
  sea chest, and for a little cared not for anything around, whilst down his
  cheeks would flow the tears.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch36"
     name="ch36"></a>XXXVI. -- THE READING OF THE RIDDLE</h2>

  <p class="first">A hard chase. The rowers of the penteconter were well winded
  before they caught the <i>Bozra</i>. A merchantman making for Asia was,
  however, undoubted prize; the luckless crew could be sold in the Agora, the
  cargo of oil, fish, and pottery was likewise of value. Cimon was standing on
  his poop, listening to the report of his <i>proreus</i>.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all a mina richer for the race, captain, and
  they&rsquo;ve some jars of their good Numidian wine in the
  forecastle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But here a seaman interrupted, staring blankly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Kyrie</i>, here&rsquo;s a strange prize. Five men lie dead on
  the deck. The planks are bloody. In the cabin are two men and a woman. All
  three seem mad. They are Greeks. They keep us out, and bawl, &lsquo;The
  navarch! show us the navarch, or Hellas is lost.&rsquo; And one of
  them&mdash;as true as that I sucked my mother&rsquo;s milk&mdash;is
  Phormio&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Phormio the fishmonger,&rdquo;&mdash;Cimon dropped his steering
  oar,&mdash;&ldquo;on a Carthaginian ship? You&rsquo;re mad yourself,
  man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See with your own eyes, captain. They&rsquo;ll yield to none save
  you. The prisoners are howling that one of these men is a giant.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For the active son of Miltiades to leap from bulwark to bulwark took an
  instant. Only when he showed himself did the three in the cabin scramble up
  the ladder, covered with blood, the red lines of the fetters marked into
  wrist and ankle. Lampaxo had thrown her dress over her head and was screaming
  still, despite assurances. The third Hellene&rsquo;s face was hid under a
  tangle of hair. But Cimon knew the fishmonger. Many a morning had he haggled
  with him merrily for a fine mackerel or tunny, and the navarch recoiled in
  horror at his fellow-citizen&rsquo;s plight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Infernal gods! You a prisoner here? Where is this cursed vessel
  from?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From Tr&oelig;zene,&rdquo; gasped the refugee; &ldquo;if you love
  Athens and Hellas&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He turned just in time to fling an arm about Hiram, who&mdash;carelessly
  guarded&mdash;was gliding down the hatchway.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seize that viper, bind, torture; he knows all. Make him tell or
  Hellas is lost!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Control yourself, friend,&rdquo; adjured Cimon, sorely perplexed,
  while Hiram struggled and began tugging out a crooked knife, before two
  brawny seamen nipped him fast and disarmed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! you carrion meat,&rdquo; shouted Phormio, shaking his fists
  under the helpless creature&rsquo;s nose. &ldquo;Honest men have their day at
  last. There&rsquo;s a gay hour coming before Zeus claps the lid over you in
  Tartarus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; commanded the navarch, who betwixt Phormio&rsquo;s
  shouts, Lampaxo&rsquo;s howls, and Hiram&rsquo;s moans was at his wit&rsquo;s
  end. &ldquo;Has no one on this ship kept aboard his senses?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you will be so good, sir captain,&rdquo; the third Hellene at
  last broke his silence, &ldquo;you will hearken to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The <i>proreus</i> of the <i>Alcyone</i> of Melos. More of myself
  hereafter. But if you love the weal of Hellas, demand of this Hiram where he
  concealed the treasonable despatches he received at Tr&oelig;zene and now has
  aboard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hiram? O Lord Apollo, I recognize the snake! The one that was
  always gliding around Lycon at the Isthmus. If despatches he has, I know the
  way to get them. Now, black-hearted Cyclops,&rdquo;&mdash;Cimon&rsquo;s tone
  was not gentle,&mdash;&ldquo;where are your papers?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hiram had turned gray as a corpse, but his white teeth came together.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Phormio is mistaken. Your slave has none.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; threw out Cimon, &ldquo;I can smell your lies like
  garlic. Silent still? Good, see how I am better than Asclepius. I make the
  dumb talk by a miracle. A cord and belaying-pin, Naon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The seaman addressed passed a cord about the Ph&oelig;nician&rsquo;s
  forehead with a fearful dexterity, and put the iron pin at the back of the
  skull.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Twist!&rdquo; commanded Cimon. Two mariners gripped the
  victim&rsquo;s arms. Naon pressed the cord tighter, tighter. A beastlike
  groan came through the lips of the Ph&oelig;nician. His beady eyes started
  from his head, but he did not speak.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Again,&rdquo; thundered the navarch, and as the cord stretched a
  howl of mortal agony escaped the prisoner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pity! Mercy! My head bursts. I will tell!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell quick, or we&rsquo;ll squeeze your brains out. Relax a little,
  Naon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the boat mast.&rdquo; Hiram spit the words out one by one.
  &ldquo;In the cabin. There is a peg. Pull it out. The mast is hollowed. You
  will find the papers. Woe! woe! cursed the day I was born. Cursed my mother
  for bearing me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The miserable creature fell to the deck, pressing his hands to his temples
  and moaning in agony. No one heeded him now. Cimon himself ran below to the
  mast, and wrenched the peg from its socket. Papyrus sheets were there, rolled
  compactly, covered with writing and sealed. The navarch turned over the
  packet curiously, then to the amazement of the sailors seemed to stagger
  against the mast. He was as pale as Hiram. He thrust the packet into the
  hands of his <i>proreus</i>, who stood near.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What make you of this seal? As you fear Athena, tell the
  truth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You need not adjure me so, captain. The device is simple: Theseus
  slaying the Minotaur.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And who, in Zeus&rsquo;s name, do you know in Athens who uses a
  seal like that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Silence for a moment, then the <i>proreus</i> himself was pale.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your Excellency does not mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Democrates!&rdquo; cried the trembling navarch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And why not Democrates?&rdquo; The words came from the released
  prisoner, who had been so silent, but who had glided down and stood at
  Cimon&rsquo;s elbow. He spoke in a changed voice now; again the navarch was
  startled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is Themistocles on the <i>Nausicaä</i>?&rdquo; asked the stranger,
  whilst Cimon gazed on him spellbound, asking if he himself were growing
  mad.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but your voice, your face, your manner&mdash;my head is
  dizzy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The stranger touched him gently on the hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have I so changed, you quite forget me, Cimon?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The son of Miltiades was a strong man. He had looked on Hiram&rsquo;s
  tortures with a laugh. To his own death he would have gone with no eyelash
  trembling. But now the rest saw him blench; then with a cry, at once of
  wonder and inexpressible joy, his arms closed round the tattered
  outlaw&rsquo;s neck. Treason or no treason&mdash;what matter! He forgot all
  save that before him was his long-time comrade.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My friend! My boyhood&rsquo;s friend!&rdquo; and so for many times
  they kissed.</p>

  <p>The <i>Nausicaä</i> had followed the chase at easy distance, ready with
  aid in case the <i>Bozra</i> resisted. Themistocles was in his cabin with
  Simonides, when Cimon and Glaucon came to him. The admiral heard his young
  navarch&rsquo;s report, then took the unopened packet and requested Cimon and
  the poet to withdraw. As their feet sounded on the ladder in the
  companionway, Themistocles turned on the outlaw, it seemed, fiercely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell your story.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon told it: the encounter on the hillside at Tr&oelig;zene, the
  seizure in Phormio&rsquo;s house, the coming of Democrates and his boasts
  over the captives, the voyage and the pursuing. The son of Neocles never
  hastened the recital, though once or twice he widened it by an incisive
  question. At the end he demanded:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And does Phormio confirm all this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All. Question him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! He&rsquo;s a truthful man in everything save the price of
  fish. Now let us open the packet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles was exceeding deliberate. He drew his dagger and pried the
  wrapper open without breaking the seals or tearing the papyrus. He turned the
  strips of paper carefully one by one, opened a casket, and drew thence a
  written sheet which he compared painfully with those before him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The same hand,&rdquo; his remark in undertone.</p>

  <p>He was so calm that a stranger would have thought him engaged with routine
  business. Many of the sheets he simply lifted, glanced at, laid down again.
  They did not seem to interest. So through half the roll, but the outlaw,
  watching patiently, at last saw he eyebrows of the son of Neocles pressing
  ever closer,&mdash;sign that the inscrutable brain was at its fateful
  work.</p>

  <p>At last he uttered one word, &ldquo;Cipher.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A sheet lay before him covered with broken words and
  phrases&mdash;seemingly without meaning&mdash;but the admiral knew the secret
  of the Spartan <i>scytale</i>, the &ldquo;cipher wood.&rdquo; Forth from his
  casket came a number of rounded sticks of varying lengths. On one after
  another he wound the sheet spirally until at the fifth trial the scattered
  words came together. He read with ease. Then Themistocles&rsquo;s brows grew
  closer than before. He muttered softly in his beard. But still he said
  nothing aloud. He read the cipher sheet through once, twice; it seemed
  thrice. Other sheets he fingered delicately, as though he feared the touch of
  venom. All without haste, but at the end, when Themistocles arose from his
  seat, the outlaw trembled. Many things he had seen, but never a face so
  changed. The admiral was neither flushed nor pale. But ten years seemed added
  to those lines above his eyes. His cheeks were hollowed. Was it fancy that
  put the gray into his beard and hair? Slowly he rose; slowly he ordered the
  marine on guard outside the cabin to summon Simonides, Cimon, and all the
  officers of the flag-ship. They trooped hither and filled the narrow
  cabin&mdash;fifteen or more hale, handsome Athenians, intent on the orders of
  the admiral. Were they to dash at once for Samos and surprise the Persian? Or
  what other adventure waited? The breeze had died. The gray breast of the
  Ægean rocked the <i>Nausicaä</i> softly. The thranites of the upper oar bank
  were alone on the benches, and stroking the great trireme along to a singsong
  chant about Amphitrite and the Tritons. On the poop above two sailors were
  grumbling lest the penteconter&rsquo;s people get all the booty of the
  <i>Bozra</i>. Glaucon heard their grunts and complainings whilst he looked on
  Themistocles&rsquo;s awful face.</p>

  <p>The officers ranged themselves and saluted stiffly. Themistocles stood
  before them, his hands closed over the packet. The first time he started to
  speak his lips closed desperately. The silence grew awkward. Then the admiral
  gave his head a toss, and drew his form together as a runner before a
  race.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Democrates is a traitor. Unless Athena shows us mercy, Hellas is
  lost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Democrates is a traitor!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The cry from the startled men rang through the ship. The rowers ceased
  their chant and their stroking. Themistocles beckoned angrily for
  silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did not call you down to wail and groan.&rdquo; He never raised
  his voice; his calmness made him terrible. But now the questions broke loose
  as a flood.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When? How? Declare.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace, men of Athens; you conquered the Persian at Salamis, conquer
  now yourselves. Harken to this cipher. Then to our task and prove our
  comrades did not die in vain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Yet despite him men wept on one another&rsquo;s shoulders as became true
  Hellenes, whilst Themistocles, whose inexorable face never relaxed, rewound
  the papyrus on the cipher stick and read in hard voice the words of doom.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is the letter secreted on the Carthaginian. The hand is
  Democrates&rsquo;s, the seals are his. Give ear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Democrates the Athenian to Tigranes, commander of the hosts of
  Xerxes on the coasts of Asia, greeting:&mdash;Understand, dear Persian, that
  Lycon and I as well as the other friends of the king among the Hellenes are
  prepared to bring all things to pass in a way right pleasing to your master.
  Even now I depart from Tr&oelig;zene to join the army of the allied Hellenes
  in B&oelig;otia, and, the gods helping, we cannot fail. Lycon and I will
  contrive to separate the Athenians and Spartans from their other allies, to
  force them to give battle, and at the crisis cause the divisions under our
  personal commands to retire, breaking the phalanx and making
  Mardonius&rsquo;s victory certain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For your part, excellent Tigranes, you must avoid the Hellenic
  ships at Delos and come back to Mardonius with your fleet ready to second him
  at once after his victory, which will be speedy; then with your aid he can
  readily turn the wall at the Isthmus. I send also letters written, as it
  were, in the hand of Themistocles. See that they fall into the hands of the
  other Greek admirals. They will breed more hurt amongst the Hellenes than you
  can accomplish with all your ships. I send, likewise, lists of such Athenians
  and Spartans as are friendly to his Majesty, also memoranda of such secret
  plans of the Greeks as have come to my knowledge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From Tr&oelig;zene, given into the hands of Hiram on the second of
  Metageitnion, in the archonship of Xanthippus. <i>Chaire!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles ceased. No man spoke a word. It was as if a god had flung a
  bolt from heaven. What use to cry against it? Then, in an ominously low
  voice, Simonides asked a question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are these letters which purport to come from your pen,
  Themistocles?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The admiral unrolled another papyrus, and as he looked thereon his fine
  face contracted with loathing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let another read. I am made to pour contempt and ridicule upon my
  fellow-captains. I am made to boast &lsquo;when the war ends, I will be
  tyrant of Athens.&rsquo; A thousand follies and wickednesses are put in my
  mouth. Were this letter true, I were the vilest wretch escaping Orcus. Since
  forged&mdash;&rdquo; his hands clinched&mdash;&ldquo;by that man, that man
  whom I have trusted, loved, cherished, called &lsquo;younger brother,&rsquo;
  &lsquo;oldest son&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; He spat in rising fury and was
  still.</p>

  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Fain would I grip his liver in my teeth,&rsquo; &rdquo;
  cried the little poet, even in storm and stress not forgetting his Homer. And
  the howl from the man-of-war&rsquo;s men was as the howl of beasts desiring
  their prey. But the admiral&rsquo;s burst of anger ended. He stood again an
  image of calm power. The voice that had charmed the thousands rang forth in
  its strength and sweetness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Men of Athens, this is no hour for windy rage. Else I should rage
  the most, for who is more wronged than I? One whom we loved is
  fallen&mdash;later let us weep for him. One whom we trusted is
  false&mdash;later punish him. But now the work is neither to weep nor to
  punish, but to save Hellas. A great battle impends in B&oelig;otia. Except
  the Zeus of our sires and Athena of the Pure Eyes be with us, we are men
  without home, without fatherland. Pausanias and Aristeides must be warned.
  The <i>Nausicaä</i> is the &lsquo;Salaminia,&rsquo;&mdash;the swiftest
  trireme in the fleet. Ours must be the deed, and ours the glory. Enough of
  this&mdash;the men must hear, and then to the oars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles had changed from despair to a triumph note. There was uplift
  even to look upon him. He strode before all his lieutenants up and out upon
  the poop. The long tiers of benches and the gangways filled with rowers
  peered up at him. They had seen their officers gather in the cabin, and Dame
  Rumour, subtlest of Zeus&rsquo;s messengers, had breathed
  &ldquo;ill-tidings.&rdquo; Now the admiral stood forth, and in few words told
  all the heavy tale. Again a great shout, whilst the bronzed men groaned on
  the benches.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Democrates is a traitor!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A deity had fallen from their Olympus; the darling of the
  Athenians&rsquo;s democracy was sunk to vilest of the vile. But the admiral
  knew how to play on their two hundred hearts better than Orpheus upon his
  lyre. Again the note changed from despair to incitement, and when at last he
  called, &ldquo;And can we cross the Ægean as never trireme crossed and pluck
  back Hellas from her fate?&rdquo; thalamite, zygite, and thranite rose,
  tossing their brawny arms into the air.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>We can!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Themistocles folded his own arms and smiled. He felt the god was
  still with him.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Yet, eager as was the will, they could not race forth
  instantly. Orders must be written to Xanthippus, the Athenian vice-admiral
  far away, bidding him at all hazards to keep the Persian fleet near Samos.
  Cimon was long in privy council with Themistocles in the state cabin. At the
  same time a prisoner was passed aboard the <i>Nausicaä</i>, not gently
  bound,&mdash;Hiram, a precious witness, before the dogs had their final meal
  on him. But the rest of the <i>Bozra&rsquo;s</i> people found a quicker
  release. The penteconter&rsquo;s people decided their fate with a yell.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sell such harpies for slaves? The money would stink through our
  pouches!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So two by two, tied neck to neck and heel to heel, the wretches were flung
  overboard, &ldquo;because we lack place and wood to crucify you,&rdquo;
  called the <i>Nausicaä&rsquo;s</i> governor, as he pushed the last pair off
  into the leaden sea,&mdash;for the day was distant when the destruction of
  such Barbarian rogues would weigh even on tender consciences.</p>

  <p>So the Carthaginians ceased from troubling, but before the penteconter and
  the <i>Bozra</i> bore away to join the remaining fleet, another deed was done
  in sight of all three ships. For whilst Themistocles was with Cimon,
  Simonides and Sicinnus had taken Glaucon to the <i>Nausicaä&rsquo;s</i>
  forecastle. Now as the penteconter was casting off, again he came to view,
  and the shout that greeted him was not of fear this time, but wonder and
  delight. The Alcmæonid was clean-shaven, his hair clipped close, the black
  dye even in a manner washed away. He had flung off the rough seaman&rsquo;s
  dress, and stood forth in all his godlike beauty.</p>

  <p>Before all men Cimon, coming from the cabin, ran and kissed him once more,
  whilst the rowers clapped their hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Apollo&mdash;it is Delian Apollo! Glaucon the Beautiful lives
  again. <i>Io! Io! pæan!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; spoke Themistocles, in a burst of gladness. &ldquo;The
  gods take one friend, they restore another. &OElig;dipus has read the
  sphinx&rsquo;s riddle. Honour this man, for he is worthy of honour through
  Hellas!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The officers ran to the athlete, after them the sailors. They covered his
  face and hands with kisses. He seemed escaped the Carthaginian to perish in
  the embrace of his countrymen. Never was his blush more boyish, more divine.
  Then a bugle-blast sent every man to his station. Cimon leaped across to his
  smaller ship. The rowers of the <i>Nausicaä</i> ran out their oars, the
  hundred and seventy blades trailed in the water. Every man took a long breath
  and fixed his eyes on the admiral standing on the poop. He held a golden
  goblet set with turquoise, and filled with the blood-red Pramnian wine.
  Loudly Themistocles prayed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Zeus of Olympus and Dodona, Zeus Orchios, rewarder of the
  oath-breaker, to whom the Hellenes do not vainly pray, and thou Athena of the
  Pure Eyes, give ear. Make our ship swift, our arms strong, our hearts bold.
  Hold back the battle that we come not too late. Grant that we confound the
  guilty, put to flight the Barbarian, recompense the traitor. So to you and
  all other holy gods whose love is for the righteous we will proffer prayer
  and sacrifice forever. Amen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He poured out the crimson liquor; far into the sea he flung the golden
  cup.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heaven speed you!&rdquo; shouted from the penteconter. Themistocles
  nodded. The <i>keleustes</i> smote his gavel upon the sounding-board. The
  triple oar bank rose as one and plunged into the foam. A long
  &ldquo;h-a!&rdquo; went up from the benches. The race to save Hellas was
  begun.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch37"
     name="ch37"></a>XXXVII. -- THE RACE TO SAVE HELLAS</h2>

  <p class="first">The chase had cost the Athenians dear. Before the
  <i>Bozra</i> had submitted to her fate, she had led the <i>Nausicaä</i> and
  her consort well down into the southern Ægean. A little more and they would
  have lifted the shaggy headlands of Crete. The route before the great trireme
  was a long one. Two thousand stadia,(13) as the crow flies, sundered them
  from the Euripus, the nearest point whence they could despatch a runner to
  Pausanias and Aristeides; and what with the twistings around the scattered
  Cyclades the route was one-fourth longer. But men had ceased reckoning
  distance. Their hearts were in the flying oars, and at first the
  <i>Nausicaä</i> ran leaping across the waves as leaps the dolphin,&mdash;the
  long gleaming blades springing like shuttles in the hands of the ready crew.
  They had taken from the penteconter all her spare rowers, and to make the
  great ship bound over the steel-gray deep was children&rsquo;s play.
  &ldquo;We must save Hellas, and we can!&rdquo; That was the thought of all
  from Themistocles to the meanest thranite.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[13 Nearly two hundred miles.]</p>

  <p>So at the beginning when the task seemed light and hands were strong. The
  breeze that had betrayed the <i>Bozra</i> ever sank lower. Presently it died
  altogether. The sails they set hung limp on the mast. The navarch had them
  furled. The sea spread out before them, a glassy, leaden-coloured floor; the
  waves roaring in their wake faded in a wide ripple far behind. To hearten his
  men the <i>keleustes</i> ceased his beating on the sounding-board, and
  clapped lips to his pipe. The whole trireme chorussed the familiar song
  together:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Fast and more fast<br>
  O&rsquo;er the foam-spray we&rsquo;re passed.<br>
  And our creaking sails swell<br>
  To the swift-breathing blast,<br>
  For Poseidon&rsquo;s wild steeds<br>
  With their manifold feet,<br>
  Like a hundred white nymphs<br>
  On the blue sea-floor fleet.<br>
  And we wake as we go<br>
  Gray old Phorcys below,<br>
  Whilst on shell-clustered trumpets<br>
  The loud Tritons blow!<br>
  The loud Tritons blow!</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;All of Æolus&rsquo;s train<br>
  Springing o&rsquo;er the blue main<br>
  To our pæans reply<br>
  With their long, long refrain;<br>
  And the sea-folk upleap<br>
  From their dark weedy caves;<br>
  With a clear, briny laugh<br>
  They dance over the waves;<br>
  Now their mistress below,&mdash;<br>
  See bright Thetis go,<br>
  As she leads the mad revels,<br>
  While loud Tritons blow!<br>
  While loud Tritons blow!</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;With the foam gliding white,<br>
  Where the light flash is bright.<br>
  We feel the live keel<br>
  Leaping on with delight;<br>
  And in melody wild<br>
  Men and Nereids and wind<br>
  Sing and laugh all their praise,<br>
  To the bluff seagods kind;<br>
  Whilst deep down below,<br>
  Where no storm blasts may go,<br>
  On their care-charming trumpets<br>
  The loud Tritons blow,<br>
  The loud Tritons blow.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Bravely thus for a while, but at last Themistocles, watching from the poop
  with eyes that nothing evaded, saw how here and there the dip of the blades
  was weakening, here and there a breast was heaving rapidly, a mouth was
  panting for air.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The relief,&rdquo; he ordered. And the spare rowers ran gladly to
  the places of those who seemed the weariest. Only a partial respite. Fifty
  supernumeraries were a poor stop-gap for the one hundred and seventy. Only
  the weakest could be relieved, and even those wept and pled to continue at
  the benches a little longer. The thunderous threat of Ameinias, that he who
  refused a proffered relief must stand all day by the mast with an iron anchor
  on his shoulder, alone sufficed to make the malcontents give place. Yet after
  a little while the singing died. Breath was too precious to waste. It was
  mockery to troll of &ldquo;Æolus&rsquo;s winds&rdquo; whilst the sea was one
  motionless mirror of gray. The monotonous &ldquo;beat,&rdquo;
  &ldquo;beat&rdquo; of the <i>keleustes&rsquo;s</i> hammer, and the creaking
  of the oars in their leathered holes alone broke the stillness that reigned
  through the length of the trireme. The penteconter and her prize had long
  since faded below the horizon. With almost wistful eyes men watched the
  islets as they glided past one after another, Thera now, then Ios, and
  presently the greater Paros and Naxos lay before them. They relieved oars
  whenever possible. The supernumeraries needed no urging after their scanty
  rest to spring to the place of him who was fainting, but hardly any man spoke
  a word.</p>

  <p>The first time the relief went in Glaucon had stepped forward.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am strong. I am able to pull an oar,&rdquo; he had cried almost
  angrily when Themistocles laid his hand upon him, but the admiral would have
  none of it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shall not. Sooner will I go on to the bench myself. You have
  been through the gates of Tartarus these last days, and need all your
  strength. Are you not the Isthmionices,&mdash;the swiftest runner in
  Hellas?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Glaucon had stepped back and said no more. He knew now for what
  Themistocles reserved him,&mdash;that after the <i>Nausicaä</i> made land he
  must run, as never man ran before across wide B&oelig;otia to bear the
  tidings to Pausanias.</p>

  <p>They were betwixt Paros and Naxos at last. Wine and barley cakes soaked in
  oil were passed among the men at the oars. They ate without leaving the
  benches. And still the sea spread out glassy, motionless, and the pennon hung
  limp on the mainmast. The <i>keleustes</i> slowed his beatings, but the men
  did not obey him. No whipped cattle were they, such as rowed the triremes of
  Ph&oelig;nicia, but freemen born, sons of Athens, who called it joy to die
  for her in time of need. Therefore despite the <i>keleustes&rsquo;s</i>
  beats, despite Themistocles&rsquo;s command, the rowing might not slacken.
  And the black wave around the <i>Nausicaä&rsquo;s</i> bow sang its monotonous
  music.</p>

  <p>But Themistocles ever turned his face eastward, until men thought he was
  awaiting some foe in chase, and presently&mdash;just as a rower among the
  zygites fell back with the blood gushing from mouth and nostrils&mdash;the
  admiral pointed his finger toward the sky-line of the morning.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look! Athena is with us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And for the first time in hours those panting, straining men let the hot
  oar butts slip from their hands, even trail in the darkling water, whilst
  they rose, looked, and blessed their gods.</p>

  <p>It was coming, the strong kind Eurus out of the south and east. They could
  see the black ripple springing over the glassy sea; they could hear the
  singing of the cordage; they could catch the sweet sniff of the brine.
  Admiral and rower lifted their hands together at this manifest favour of
  heaven.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poseidon is with us! Athena is with us! Æolus is with us! We can
  save Hellas!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Soon the sun burst forth above the mist. All the wide ocean floor was
  adance with sparkling wavelets. No need of Ameinias&rsquo;s lusty call to
  bend again the sails. The smaller canvas on the foremast and great spread on
  the mainmast were bellying to the piping gale. A fair wind, but no storm. The
  oars were but helpers now,&mdash;men laughed, hugged one another as boys,
  wept as girls, and let the benignant wind gods labour for them. Delos the
  Holy they passed, and Tenos, and soon the heights of Andros lifted, as the
  ship with its lading of fate flew over the island-strewn sea. At last, just
  as the day was leaving them, they saw Helios going down into the fire-tinged
  waves in a parting burst of glory. Darkness next, but the kindly wind failed
  not. Through the night no man on that trireme slumbered. Breeze or calm, he
  who had an obol&rsquo;s weight of power spent it at the oars.</p>

  <p>Long after midnight Themistocles and Glaucon clambered the giddy cordage
  to the ship&rsquo;s top above the swelling mainsail. On the narrow platform,
  with the stars above, the dim tracery of the wide sail, the still dimmer
  tracery of the long ship below, they seemed transported to another world. Far
  beneath by the glimmer of the lanterns they saw the rowers swaying at their
  toil. In the wake the phosphorous bubbles ran away, opalescent gleams
  springing upward, as if torches of Doris and her dancing Nereids. So much had
  admiral and outlaw lived through this day they had thought little of
  themselves. Now calmer thought returned. Glaucon could tell of many things he
  had heard and thought, of the conversation overheard the morning before
  Salamis, of what Phormio had related during the weary captivity in the hold
  of the <i>Bozra</i>. Themistocles pondered long. Yet for Glaucon when
  standing even on that calm pinnacle the trireme must creep over the deep too
  slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O give me wings, Father Zeus,&rdquo; was his prayer; &ldquo;yes,
  the wings of Icarus. Let me fly but once to confound the traitor and deliver
  thy Hellas,&mdash;after that, like Icarus let me fall. I am content to
  die.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Themistocles pressed close against his side. &ldquo;Ask for no
  wings,&rdquo;&mdash;in the admiral&rsquo;s voice was a tremor not there when
  he sped confidence through the crew,&mdash;&ldquo;if it be destined we save
  Hellas, it is destined; if we are to die, we die. &lsquo;No man of woman
  born, coward or brave, can shun the fate assigned.&rsquo; Hector said that to
  Andromache, and the Trojan was right. But we shall save Hellas. Zeus and
  Athena are great gods. They did not give us glory at Salamis to make that
  glory tenfold vain. We shall save Hellas. Yet I have fear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of what, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fear that Themistocles will be too merciful to be just. Ah! pity
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I understand&mdash;Democrates.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I pray he may escape to the Persians, or that Ares may slay him in
  fair battle. If not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The admiral&rsquo;s hold upon the younger Athenian&rsquo;s arm
  tightened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will prove that Aristeides is not the only man in Hellas who
  deserves the name of &lsquo;Just.&rsquo; When I was young, my tutor would
  predict great things of me. &lsquo;You will be nothing small, Themistocles,
  but great, whether for good or ill, I know not,&mdash;but great you will
  be.&rsquo; And I have always struggled upward. I have always prospered. I am
  the first man in Hellas. I have set my will against all the power of Persia.
  Zeus willing, I shall conquer. But the Olympians demand their price. For
  saving Hellas I must pay&mdash;Democrates. I loved him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The two men stood in silence long, whilst below the oars and the rushing
  water played their music. At last the admiral relaxed his hand on
  Glaucon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Eu!</i> They will call me &lsquo;Saviour of Hellas&rsquo; if all
  goes well. I shall be greater than Solon, or Lycurgus, or Periander, and in
  return I must do justice to a friend. Fair recompense!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The laugh of the son of Neocles was harsher than a cry. The other answered
  nothing. Themistocles set his foot on the ladder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must return to the men. I would go to an oar, only they will not
  let me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The admiral left Glaucon for a moment alone. All around him was the
  night,&mdash;the stars, the black æther, the blacker sea,&mdash;but he was
  not lonely. He felt as when in the foot-race he turned for the last burst
  toward the goal. One more struggle, one supreme summons of strength and will,
  and after that the triumph and the rest.&mdash;Hellas, Athens, Hermione, he
  was speeding back to all. Once again all the things past floated out of the
  dream-world and before him,&mdash;the wreck, the lotus-eating at Sardis,
  Thermopylæ, Salamis, the agony on the <i>Bozra</i>. Now came the end, the end
  promised in the moment of vision whilst he pulled the boat at Salamis. What
  was it? He tried not to ask. Enough it was to be the end. He, like
  Themistocles, had supreme confidence that the treason would be thwarted. The
  gods were cruel, but not so cruel that after so many deliverances they would
  crush him at the last. &ldquo;The miracles of Zeus are never wrought in
  vain.&rdquo; Had not Zeus wrought miracles for him once and twice? The
  proverb was great comfort.</p>

  <p>Suddenly whilst he built his palace of phantasy, a cry from the foreship
  dissolved it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Attica, Attica, hail, all hail!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He saw upon the sky-line the dim tracery of the Athenian headlands
  &ldquo;like a shield laid on the misty deep.&rdquo; Again men were springing
  from the oars, laughing, weeping, embracing, whilst under the clear,
  unflagging wind the <i>Nausicaä</i> sped up the narrowing strait betwixt
  Eub&oelig;a and the mainland. Dawn glowed at last, unveiling the brown Attic
  shoreline with Pentelicus the marble-fretted and all his darker peers.</p>

  <p>Hour by hour they ran onward. They skirted the long low coast of
  Eub&oelig;a to the starboard. They saw Marathon and its plain of fair
  memories stretching to port, and now the strait grew closer yet, and it
  needed all the governor&rsquo;s skill at the steering-oars to keep the
  <i>Nausicaä</i> from the threatening rocks. Marathon was behind at last. The
  trireme rounded the last promontory; the bay grew wider; the prow was set
  more to westward. Every man&mdash;the faintest&mdash;struggled back to his
  oar if he had left it&mdash;this was the last hundred stadia to Oropus, and
  after that the <i>Nausicaä</i> might do no more. Once again the
  <i>keleustes</i> piped, and his note was swift and feverish. The blades shot
  faster, faster, as the trireme raced down the sandy shore of the Attic
  &ldquo;Diacria.&rdquo; Once in the strait they saw a brown-sailed fisherboat,
  and the helm swerved enough to bring her within hail. The fishermen stared at
  the flying trireme and her straining, wide-eyed men.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has there been a battle?&rdquo; cried Ameinias.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not yet. We are from Styra on Eub&oelig;a; we expect the news
  daily. The armies are almost together.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And where are they?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Near to Platæa.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That was all. The war-ship left the fishermen rocking in her wake, but
  again Themistocles drew his eyebrows close together, while Glaucon tightened
  the buckle on his belt. Platæa,&mdash;the name meant that the courier must
  traverse the breadth of B&oelig;otia, and with the armies face to face how
  long would Zeus hold back the battle? How long indeed, with Democrates and
  Lycon intent on bringing battle to pass? The ship was more than ever silent
  as she rushed on the last stretch of her course. More men fell at the oars
  with blood upon their faces. The supernumeraries tossed them aside like logs
  of wood, and leaped upon their benches. Themistocles had vanished with
  Simonides in the cabin; all knew their work,&mdash;preparing letters to
  Aristeides and Pausanias to warn of the bitter truth. Then the haven at last:
  the white-stuccoed houses of Oropus clustering down upon the shore, the
  little mole, a few doltish peasants by the landing gaping at the great
  trireme. No others greeted them, for the terror of Mardonius&rsquo;s Tartar
  raiders had driven all but the poorest to some safe shelter. The oars slipped
  from numb fingers; the anchor plunged into the green water; the mainsail
  rattled down the mast. Men sat on the benches motionless, gulping down the
  clear air. They had done their part. The rest lay in the hands of the gods,
  and in the speed of him who two days since they had called &ldquo;Glaucon the
  Traitor.&rdquo; The messenger came from the cabin, half stripped, on his head
  a felt skullcap, on his feet high hunter&rsquo;s boots laced up to the knees.
  He had never shone in more noble beauty. The crew watched Themistocles place
  a papyrus roll in Glaucon&rsquo;s belt, and press his mouth to the
  messenger&rsquo;s ear in parting admonition. Glaucon gave his right hand to
  Themistocles, his left to Simonides. Fifty men were ready to man the pinnace
  to take him ashore. On the beach the <i>Nausicaä&rsquo;s</i> people saw him
  stand an instant, as he turned his face upward to the
  &ldquo;dawn-facing&rdquo; gods of Hellas, praying for strength and
  swiftness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Apollo speed you!&rdquo; called two hundred after him. He answered
  from the beach with a wave of his beautiful arms. A moment later he was hid
  behind a clump of olives. The <i>Nausicaä&rsquo;s</i> people knew the ordeal
  before him, but many a man said Glaucon had the easier task. He could run
  till life failed him. They now could only fold their hands and wait.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was long past noon when Glaucon left the desolate village
  of Oropus behind him. The day was hot, but after the manner of Greece not
  sultry, and the brisk breeze was stirring on the hill slopes. Over the
  distant mountains hung a tint of deep violet. It was early in
  B&oelig;dromion.(14) The fields&mdash;where indeed the Barbarian cavalry men
  had not deliberately burned them&mdash;were seared brown by the long dry
  summer. Here and there great black crows were picking, and a red fox would
  whisk out of a thicket and go with long bounds across the unharvested fields
  to some safer refuge. Glaucon knew his route. Three hundred and sixty stadia
  lay before him, and those not over the well-beaten course in the gymnasium,
  but by rocky goat trails and by-paths that made his task no easier. He
  started off slowly. He was too good an athlete to waste his speed by one
  fierce burst at the outset. At first his road was no bad one, for he skirted
  the willow-hung Asopus, the boundary stream betwixt Attica and B&oelig;otia.
  But he feared to keep too long upon this highway to Tanagra, and of the
  dangers of the road he soon met grim warnings.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[14 Approximately September.]</p>

  <p>First, it was a farmstead in black ruin, with the carcass of a horse half
  burned lying before the gate. Next, it was the body of a woman, three days
  slain, and in the centre of the road,&mdash;no pleasant sight, for the crows
  had been at their banquet,&mdash;and hardened though the Alcmæonid was to
  war, he stopped long enough to cast the ceremonial handful of dust on the
  poor remains, as symbolic burial, and sped a wish to King Pluto to give peace
  to the wanderer&rsquo;s spirit. Next, people met him: an old man, his wife,
  his young son,&mdash;wretched shepherd-folk dressed in sheepskins,&mdash;the
  boy helping his elders as they tottered along on their staves toward the
  mountain. At sight of Glaucon they feebly made to fly, but he held out his
  hand, showing he was unarmed, and they halted also.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whence and whither, good father?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whereat the old man began to shake all over and tell a mumbling story, how
  they had been set upon by the Scythian troopers in their little farm near
  &OElig;nophytæ, how he had seen the farmhouse burn, his two daughters swung
  shrieking upon the steeds of the wild Barbarians, and as for himself and his
  wife and son, Athena knew what saved them! They had lost all but life, and
  fearful for that were seeking a cave on Mt. Parnes. Would not the young man
  come with them, a thousand dangers lurked upon the way? But Glaucon did not
  wait to hear the story out. On he sped up the rocky road.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Mardonius! ah, Artazostra!&rdquo; he was speaking in his heart,
  &ldquo;noble and brave you are to your peers, but this is your rare
  handiwork,&mdash;and though you once called me friend, Zeus and Dike still
  rule, there is a price for this and you shall tell it out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Yet he bethought himself of the old man&rsquo;s warning, and left the
  beaten way. At the long steady trot learned in the stadium, he went onward
  under the greenwood behind the gleaming river, where the vines and branches
  whipped on his face; and now and again he crossed a half-dried brook, where
  he swept up a little water in his hands, and said a quick prayer to the
  friendly nymphs of the stream. Once or twice he sped through fig orchards,
  and snatched at the ripe fruit as he ran, eating without slackening his
  course. Presently the river began to bend away to westward. He knew if he
  followed it, he came soon to Tanagra, but whether that town were held by the
  Persians or burned by them, who could tell? He quitted the Asopus and its
  friendly foliage. The bare wide plain of B&oelig;otia was opening.
  Concealment was impossible, unless indeed he turned far eastward toward
  Attica and took refuge on the foothills of the mountains. But speed was more
  precious than safety. He passed Scolus, and found the village desolate,
  burned. No human being greeted him, only one or two starving dogs rushed
  forth to snap, bristle, and be chased away by a well-sent stone. Here and
  yonder in the fields were still the clusters of crows picking at
  carrion,&mdash;more tokens that Mardonius&rsquo;s Tartar raiders had done
  their work too well. Then at last, an hour or more before the sunset, just as
  the spurs of Cithæron, the long mountain over against Attica, began to thrust
  their bald summits up before the runner&rsquo;s ken, far ahead upon the way
  approached a cloud of dust. The Athenian paused in his run, dashed into the
  barren field, and flung himself flat between the furrows. He heard the
  hoof-beats of the wiry steppe horses, the clatter of targets and scabbards,
  the shrill shouts of the raiders. He lifted his head enough to see the red
  streamers on their lance tips flutter past. He let the noise die away before
  he dared to take the road once more. The time he lost was redeemed by a burst
  of speed. His head was growing very hot, but it was not time to think of
  that.</p>

  <p>Already the hills were spreading their shadows, and Platæa was many stadia
  away. Knowledge of how much remained made him reckless. He ran on without his
  former caution. The plain was again changing to undulating foothills. He had
  passed Erythræ now,&mdash;another village burned and deserted. He mounted a
  slope, was descending to mount another, when lo! over the hill before came
  eight riders at full speed. What must be done, must be done quickly. To
  plunge into the fallow field again were madness, the horsemen had surely seen
  him, and their sure-footed beasts could run over the furrows like rabbits.
  Glaucon stood stock still and stretched forth both hands, to show the
  horsemen he did not resist them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Athena Polias,&rdquo; uprose the prayer from his heart, &ldquo;if
  thou lovest not me, forget not thy love for Hellas, for Athens, for Hermione
  my wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The riders were on him instantly, their crooked swords flew out. They
  surrounded their captive, uttering outlandish cries and chatterings, ogling,
  muttering, pointing with their swords and lances as if debating among
  themselves whether to let the stranger go or hew him in pieces. Glaucon stood
  motionless, looking from one to another and asking for wisdom in his soul.
  Seven were Tartars, low-browed, yellow-skinned, flat of nose, with the grins
  of apes. He might expect the worst from these. But the eighth showed a long
  blond beard under his leather helm, and Glaucon rejoiced; the chief of the
  band was a Persian and more amenable.</p>

  <p>The Tartars continued gesturing and debating, flourishing their steel
  points right at the prisoner&rsquo;s breast. He regarded them calmly, so
  calmly that the Persian gave vent to his admiration.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Down with your lance-head, Rukhs. By Mithra, I think this Hellene
  is brave as he is beautiful! See how he stands. We must have him to the
  Prince.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excellency,&rdquo; spoke Glaucon, in his best court Persian,
  &ldquo;I am a courier to the Lord Mardonius. If you are faithful servants of
  his Eternity the king, where is your camp?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The chief started.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On the life of my father, you speak Persian as if you dwelled in
  Eran at the king&rsquo;s own doors! What do you here alone upon this road in
  Hellas?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Glaucon put out his hand before answering, caught the tip of Rukhs&rsquo;s
  lance, and snapped it short like a reed. He knew the way to win the
  admiration of the Barbarians. They yelled with delight, all at least save
  Rukhs.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Strong as he is brave and handsome,&rdquo; cried the Persian.
  &ldquo;Again&mdash;who are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Alcmæonid drew himself to full height and gave his head its lordliest
  poise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Understand, Persian, that I have indeed lived long at the
  king&rsquo;s gates. Yes,&mdash;I have learned my Aryan at the Lord
  Mardonius&rsquo;s own table, for I am the son of Attaginus of Thebes, who is
  not the least of the friends of his Eternity in Hellas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The mention of one of the foremost Medizers of Greece made the subaltern
  bend in his saddle. His tone became even obsequious.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, I understand. Your Excellency is a courier. You have despatches
  from the king?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Despatches of moment just landed from Asia. Now tell me where the
  army is encamped.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the Asopus, much to northward. The Hellenes lie to south. Here,
  Rukhs, take the noble courier behind you on the horse, and conduct him to the
  general.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heaven bless your generosity,&rdquo; cried the runner, with almost
  precipitate haste, &ldquo;but I know the country well, and the worthy Rukhs
  will not thank me if I deprive him of his share in your booty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, we have heard of a farm across the hills at Eleutheræ
  that&rsquo;s not yet been plundered,&mdash;handsome wenches, and we&rsquo;ll
  make the father dig up his pot of money. Mazda speed you, sir, for we are
  off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yeh! yeh!&rdquo; yelled the seven Tartars, none more loudly than
  Rukhs, who had no hankering for conducting a courier back into the camp. So
  the riders came and went, whilst Glaucon drew his girdle one notch tighter
  and ran onward through the gathering evening.</p>

  <p>The adventure had been a warning. Once Athena had saved him, not perchance
  twice,&mdash;again he took to the fields. He did not love the sight of the
  sun ever lower, on the long brown ridge of Helicon far to west. Until now he
  scarce thought enough of self to realize the terrible draughts he had made
  upon his treasure-house of strength. Could it be that he&mdash;the
  Isthmionices, who had crushed down the giant of Sparta before the cheering
  myriads&mdash;could faint like a weary girl, when the weal of Hellas was his
  to win or lose? Why did his tongue burn in his throat as a coal? Why did
  those feet&mdash;so swift, so ready when he sped from Oropus&mdash;lift so
  heavily?</p>

  <p>As a flash it came over him what he had endured,&mdash;the slow agony on
  the <i>Bozra</i>, the bursting of the bands, the fight for life, the scene
  with Themistocles, the sleepless night on the trireme. Now he was running as
  the wild hare runs before the baying chase. Could it be that all this race
  was vain?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Hellas! For Hermione!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whilst he groaned through his gritted teeth, some malignant god made him
  misstep, stumble. He fell between the hard furrows, bruising his face and
  hands. After a moment he rose, but rose to sink back again with keen pain
  shooting through an ankle. He had turned it. For an instant he sat
  motionless, taking breath, then his teeth came together harder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Themistocles trusts me. I carry the fate of Hellas. I can die, but
  I cannot fail.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was quite dusk now. The brief southern twilight was ending in pale bars
  of gold above Helicon. Glaucon rose again; the cold sweat sprang out upon his
  forehead. Before his eyes rose darkness, but he did not faint. Some kind
  destiny set a stout pole upright in the field,&mdash;perhaps for vines to
  clamber,&mdash;he clutched it, and stood until his sight cleared and the pain
  a little abated. He tore the pole from the ground, and reached the roadway.
  He must take his chance of meeting more raiders. He had one vast
  comfort,&mdash;if there had been no battle fought that day, there would be
  none before dawn. But he had still weary stadia before him, and running was
  out of the question. Ever and anon he would stop his hobbling, take air, and
  stare at the vague tracery of the hills,&mdash;Cithæron to southward, Helicon
  to west, and northward the wide dark Theban plain. He gave up counting how
  many times he halted, how many times he spoke the magic words, &ldquo;For
  Hellas! For Hermione!&rdquo; and forced onward his way. The moon failed, even
  the stars were clouded. A kind of brute instinct guided him. At last&mdash;he
  guessed it was nearly midnight&mdash;he caught once more the flashings of a
  shallow river and the dim outlines of shrubbery beside the bank&mdash;again
  the Asopus. He must take care or he would wander straight into
  Mardonius&rsquo;s camp. Therefore he stopped awhile, drank the cool water,
  and let the stream purl around his burning foot. Then he set his face to the
  south, for there lay Platæa. There he would find the Hellenes.</p>

  <p>He was almost unconscious of everything save the fierce pain and the need
  to go forward even to the end. At moments he thought he saw the mountains
  springing out of their gloom,&mdash;Helicon and Cithæron beckoning him on, as
  with living fingers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not too late. Marathon was not vain, nor Thermopylæ, nor Salamis.
  You can save Hellas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Who spoke that? He stared into the solitary night. Was he not alone? Then
  phantasms came as on a flood. He was in a kind of euthanasy. The pain of his
  foot had ceased. He saw the Paradise by Sardis and its bending feathery
  palms; he heard the tinkling of the Lydian harps, and Roxana singing of the
  magic Oxus, and the rose valleys of Eran. Next Roxana became Hermione. He was
  standing at her side on the knoll of Colonus, and watching the sun sink
  behind Daphni making the Acropolis glow with red fire and gold. Yet all the
  time he knew he was going onward. He must not stop.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Hellas! For Hermione!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At last even the vision of the Violet-Crowned City faded to mist. Had he
  reached the end,&mdash;the rest by the fields of Rhadamanthus, away from
  human strife? The night was ever darkening. He saw nothing, felt nothing,
  thought nothing save that he was still going onward, onward.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">At some time betwixt midnight and dawning an Athenian
  outpost was pacing his beat outside the lines of Aristeides. The allied
  Hellenes were retiring from their position by the Asopus to a more convenient
  spot by Platæa, less exposed to the dreaded Persian cavalry, but on the night
  march the contingents had become disordered. The Athenians were halting under
  arms,&mdash;awaiting orders from Pausanias the commander-in-chief. The
  outpost&mdash;Hippon, a worthy charcoal-burner of Archarnæ&mdash;was creeping
  gingerly behind the willow hedges, having a well-grounded fear of Tartar
  arrows. Presently his fox-keen ears caught footfalls from the road. His
  shield went up. He couched his spear. His eyes, sharpened by the long
  darkness, saw a man hardly running, nor walking, yet dragging one foot and
  leaning on a staff. Here was no Tartar, and Hippon sprang out boldly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Halt, stranger, tell your business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Aristeides.&rdquo; The apparition seemed holding out something
  in his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the watchword. Give it, or I must arrest
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Aristeides.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Zeus smite you, fellow, can&rsquo;t you speak Greek? What have you
  got for our general?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Aristeides.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The stranger was hoarse as a crow. He was pushing aside the spear and
  forcing a packet into Hippon&rsquo;s hands. The latter, sorely puzzled,
  whistled through his fingers. A moment more the locharch of the scouting
  division and three comrades appeared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why the alarm? Where&rsquo;s the enemy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No enemy, but a madman. Find what he wants.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The locharch in earlier days had kept an oil booth in the Athens Agora and
  knew the local celebrities as well as Phormio.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, friend,&rdquo; he spoke, &ldquo;your business, and shortly;
  we&rsquo;ve no time for chaffering.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Aristeides.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The fourth time he&rsquo;s said it,&mdash;sheep!&rdquo; cried
  Hippon, but as he spoke the newcomer fell forward heavily, groaned once, and
  lay on the roadway silent as the dead. The locharch drew forth the horn
  lantern he had masked under his chalmys and leaned over the stranger. The
  light fell on the seal of the packet gripped in the rigid fingers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Themistocles&rsquo;s seal,&rdquo; he cried, and hastily turned the
  fallen man&rsquo;s face upward to the light, when the lantern almost dropped
  from his own hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon the Alcmæonid! Glaucon the Traitor who was dead! He or his
  shade come back from Tartarus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The four soldiers stood quaking like aspen, but their leader was of
  stouter stuff. Never had his native Attic shrewdness guided him to more
  purpose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ghost, traitor, what not, this man has run himself all but to
  death. Look on his face. And Themistocles does not send a courier for
  nothing. This packet is for Aristeides, and to Aristeides take it with
  speed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hippon seized the papyrus. He thought it would fade out of his hands like
  a spectre. It did not. The sentinel dropped his spear and ran breathless
  toward Platæa, where he knew was his general.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch38"
     name="ch38"></a>XXXVIII. -- THE COUNCIL OF MARDONIUS</h2>

  <p class="first">Never since Salamis had Persian hopes been higher than that
  night. What if the Spartans were in the field at last, and the incessant
  skirmishing had been partly to Pausanias&rsquo;s advantage? Secure in his
  fortified camp by the Asopus, Mardonius could confidently wait the turn of
  the tide. His light Tartar cavalry had cut to pieces the convoys bringing
  provisions to the Hellenes. Rumour told that Pausanias&rsquo;s army was ill
  fed, and his captains were at loggerheads. Time was fighting for Mardonius. A
  joyful letter he had sent to Sardis the preceding morning: &ldquo;Let the
  king have patience. In forty days I shall be banqueting even in
  Sparta.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In the evening the Prince sat at council with his commanders. Xerxes had
  left behind his own war pavilion, and here the Persians met. Mardonius sat on
  the high seat of the dais. Gold, purple, a hundred torches, made the scene
  worthy of the monarch himself. Beside the general stood a young
  page,&mdash;beautiful as Armaiti, fairest of the archangels. All looked on
  the page, but discreetly kept their thoughts to whispers, though many had
  guessed the secret of Mardonius&rsquo;s companion.</p>

  <p>The debate was long and vehement. Especially Artabazus, general of the
  rear-guard, was loud in asserting no battle should be risked. He was a crafty
  man, who, the Prince suspected, was his personal enemy, but his opinion was
  worth respecting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I repeat what I said before. The Hellenes showed how they could
  fight at Thermopylæ. Let us retire to Thebes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bravely said, valiant general,&rdquo; sneered Mardonius, none too
  civilly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is mine to speak, yours to follow my opinion as you list. I say
  we can conquer these Hellenes with folded hands. Retreat to Thebes; money is
  plentiful with us; we can melt our gold cups into coin. Sprinkle bribes among
  the hostile chiefs. We know their weakness. Not steel but gold will unlock
  the way to Sparta.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The generalissimo stood up proudly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bribes and stealth? Did Cyrus and Darius win us empire with these?
  No, by the Fiend-Smiter, it was sharp steel and the song of the bow-string
  that made Eran to prosper, and prosper to this day. But lest Artabazus think
  that in putting on the lion I have forgotten the fox, let the strangers now
  come to us stand forth, that he and every other may know how I have done all
  things for the glory of my master and the Persian name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He smote with his commander&rsquo;s mace upon the bronze ewer on the
  table. Instantly there appeared two soldiers, between them two men, one of
  slight, one of gigantic, stature, but both in Grecian dress. Artabazus sprang
  to his feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who are these men&mdash;Thebans?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From greater cities than Thebes. You see two new servants of the
  king, therefore friends of us all. Behold Lycon of Sparta and Democrates,
  friend of Themistocles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His speech was Persian, but the newcomers both understood when he named
  them. The tall Laconian straightened his bull neck, as in defiance. The
  Athenian flushed. His head seemed sinking betwixt his shoulders. Much
  wormwood had he drunk of late, but none bitterer than this,&mdash;to be
  welcomed at the councils of the Barbarian. Artabazus salaamed to his superior
  half mockingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Verily, son of Gobryas, I was wrong. You are guileful as a Greek.
  There can be no higher praise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Prince&rsquo;s nostrils twitched. Perhaps he was not saying all he
  felt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let your praise await the issue,&rdquo; he rejoined coldly.
  &ldquo;Suffice it that these friends were long convinced of the wisdom of
  aiding his Eternity, and to-night come from the camp of the Hellenes to tell
  all that has passed and why we should make ready for battle at the
  dawning.&rdquo; He turned to the Greeks, ordering in their own tongue,
  &ldquo;Speak forth, I am interpreter for the council.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>An awkward instant followed. Lycon looked on Democrates.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are an Athenian, your tongue is readiest,&rdquo; he
  whispered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you the first to Medize. Finish your handiwork,&rdquo; the
  retort.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are waiting,&rdquo; prompted Mardonius, and Lycon held up his
  great head and began in short sentences which the general deftly turned into
  Persian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your cavalry has made our position by the Asopus intolerable. All
  the springs are exposed. We have to fight every time we try to draw water.
  To-day was a meeting of the commanders, many opinions, much wrangling, but
  all said we must retire. The town of Platæa is best. It is strong, with
  plenty of water. You cannot attack it. To-night our camp has been struck. The
  troops begin to retire, but in disorder. The contingent of each city marches
  by itself. The Athenians, thanks to Democrates, delay retreating; the
  Spartans I have delayed also. I have persuaded Amompharetus, my cousin, who
  leads the Pitanate <i>mora</i>,(15) and who was not at the council, that it
  is cowardly for a Spartan to retreat. He is a sheep-skulled fool and has
  believed me. Consequently, he and his men are holding back. The other
  Spartans wait for them. At dawn you will find the Athenians and Spartans
  alone near their old camping ground, their allies straggling in the rear.
  Attack boldly. When the onset joins, Democrates and I will order our own
  divisions to retire. The phalanxes will be broken up. With your cavalry you
  will have them at mercy, for once the spear-hedge is shattered, they are
  lost. The battle will not cost you twenty men.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[15 A division in the Spartan army.]</p>

  <p>Artabazus rose again and showed his teeth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A faithful servant of the king, Mardonius,&mdash;and so well is all
  provided, do we brave Aryans need even to string our bows?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Prince winced at the sarcasm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am serving the king, not my own pleasure,&rdquo; he retorted
  stiffly. &ldquo;The son of Gobryas is too well known to have slurs cast on
  his courage. And now what questions would my captains ask these Greeks?
  Promptly&mdash;they must be again in their own lines, or they are
  missed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>An officer here or there threw an interrogation. Lycon answered briefly.
  Democrates kept sullen silence. He was clearly present more to prove the good
  faith of his Medizing than for anything he might say. Mardonius smote the
  ewer again. The soldiers escorted the two Hellenes forth. As the curtains
  closed behind them, the curious saw that the features of the beautiful page
  by the general&rsquo;s side were contracted with disgust. Mardonius himself
  spat violently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dogs, and sons of dogs, let Angra-Mainyu wither them forever. Bear
  witness, men of Persia, how, for the sake of our Lord the King, I hold
  converse even with these vilest of the vile!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Soon the council was broken up. The final commands were given. Every
  officer knew his task. The cavalry was to be ready to charge across the
  Asopus at gray dawn. With Lycon and Democrates playing their part the issue
  was certain, too certain for many a grizzled captain who loved the ring of
  steel. In his own tent Mardonius held in his arms the beautiful
  page&mdash;Artazostra! Her wonderful face had never shone up at his more
  brightly than on that night, as he drew back his lips from a long fond
  kiss.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow&mdash;the triumph. You will be conqueror of Hellas.
  Xerxes will make you satrap. I wish we could conquer in fairer fight, but
  what wrong to vanquish these Hellenes with their own sly weapons? Do you
  remember what Glaucon said?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What thing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That Zeus and Athena were greater than Mazda the Pure and glorious
  Mithra? To-morrow will prove him wrong. I wonder whether he yet
  lives,&mdash;whether he will ever confess that Persia is
  irresistible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do not know. From the evening we parted at Phaleron he has faded
  from our world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was fair as the Amesha-Spentas, was he not? Poor
  Roxana&mdash;she is again in Sardis now. I hope she has ceased to eat her
  heart out with vain longing for her lover. He was noble minded and spoke the
  truth. How rare in a Hellene. But what will you do with these two gold-bought
  traitors, &lsquo;friends of the king&rsquo; indeed?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mardonius&rsquo;s face grew stern.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have promised them the lordships of Athens and of Sparta. The
  pledge shall be fulfilled, but after that,&rdquo;&mdash;Artazostra understood
  his sinister smile,&mdash;&ldquo;there are many ways of removing an unwelcome
  vassal prince, if I be the satrap of Hellas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you are that in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For your sake,&rdquo; was his cry, as again he kissed her, &ldquo;I
  would I were not satrap of Hellas only, but lord of all the world, that I
  might give it to you, O daughter of Darius and Atossa.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am mistress of the world,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;for my
  world is Mardonius. To-morrow the battle, the glory, and then what
  next&mdash;Sicily, Carthage, Italy? For Mazda will give us all
  things.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Otherwise talked Democrates and Lycon as they quitted the
  Persian pickets and made their way across the black plain, back to the lines
  of the Hellenes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You should be happy to-night,&rdquo; said the Athenian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly. I draw up my net and find it very full of mullets quite
  to my liking.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take care it be not so full that it break.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear Democrates,&rdquo;&mdash;Lycon slapped his paw on the
  other&rsquo;s shoulder,&mdash;&ldquo;why always imagine evil? Hermes is a
  very safe guide. I only hope our victory will be so complete Sparta will
  submit without fighting. It will be awkward to rule a plundered
  city.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shudder at the thought of being amongst even conquered Athenians;
  I shall see a tyrannicide in every boy in the Agora.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A stout Persian garrison in your Acropolis is the surest physic
  against that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the dog, Lycon, you speak like a Scythian. Hellene you surely
  are not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hellene I am, and show my native wisdom in seeing that Persia must
  conquer and trimming sail accordingly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Persia is not irresistible. With a fair battle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It will not be a fair battle. What can save Pausanias?
  Nothing&mdash;except a miracle sent from Zeus.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Such as what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As merciful Hiram&rsquo;s relenting and releasing your dear
  Glaucon.&rdquo; Lycon&rsquo;s chuckle was loud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never, as you hope me to be anything save your mortal enemy,
  mention that name again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As you like it&mdash;it&rsquo;s no very pretty tale, I grant, even
  amongst Medizers. Yet it was most imprudent to let him live.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have never heard the Furies, Lycon.&rdquo; Democrates&rsquo;s
  voice was so grave as to dry up the Spartan&rsquo;s banter. &ldquo;But I
  shall never see him again, and I shall possess Hermione.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A pretty consolation. <i>Eu!</i> here are our outposts. We must
  pass for officers reconnoitring the enemy. You know your part to-morrow. At
  the first charge bid your division &lsquo;wheel to rear.&rsquo; Three words,
  and the thing is done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lycon gave the watchword promptly to one of Pausanias&rsquo;s outposts.
  The man saluted his officers, and said that the Greeks of the lesser states
  had retreated far to the rear, that Amompharetus still refused to move his
  division, that the Spartans waited for him, and the Athenians for the
  Spartans.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Noble tidings,&rdquo; whispered the giant, as the two stood an
  instant, before each went to his own men. &ldquo;Behold how Hermes helps
  us&mdash;a great deity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think Nemesis is greater,&rdquo; said Democrates, once
  again refusing Lycon&rsquo;s proffered hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By noon you&rsquo;ll laugh at Nemesis, <i>philotate</i>, when we
  both drink Helbon wine in Xerxes&rsquo;s tent!&rdquo; and away went Lycon
  into the dark.</p>

  <p>Democrates went his own way also. Soon he was in the fallow-field, where
  under the warm night the Athenians were stretched, each man in armour, his
  helmet for a pillow. A few torches were moving. From a distance came the hum
  from a group of officers in excited conversation. As the orator picked his
  way among the sleeping men, a locharch with a lantern accosted him
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are Democrates the strategus?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aristeides summons you at once. Come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was no reason for refusing. Democrates followed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch39"
     name="ch39"></a>XXXIX. -- THE AVENGING OF LEONIDAS</h2>

  <p class="first">Morning at last, ruddy and windy. The Persian host had been
  long prepared. The Tartar cavalry with their bulls-hide targets and long
  lances, the heavy Persian cuirassiers, the Median and Assyrian archers with
  their ponderous wicker-shields, stood in rank waiting only the word that
  should dash them as sling-stones on Pausanias and his ill-starred following.
  The Magi had sacrificed a stallion, and reported that the holy fire gave
  every favouring sign. Mardonius went from his tent, all his eunuchs bowing
  their foreheads to the earth and chorussing, &ldquo;Victory to our Lord, to
  Persia, and to the King.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They brought Mardonius his favourite horse, a white steed of the sacred
  breed of Nisæa. The Prince had bound around his turban the gemmed tiara
  Xerxes had given him on his wedding-day. Few could wield the Babylonish
  cimeter that danced in the chieftain&rsquo;s hand. The captains cheered him
  loudly, as they might have cheered the king.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Life to the general! To the satrap of Hellas!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But beside the Nisæan pranced another, lighter and with a lighter mount.
  The rider was cased in silvered scale-armour, and bore only a steel-tipped
  reed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The general&rsquo;s page,&rdquo; ran the whisper, and other
  whispers, far softer, followed. None heard the quick words passed back and
  forth betwixt the two riders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may be riding to death, Artazostra. What place is a battle for
  women?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What place is the camp for the daughter of Darius, when her husband
  rides to war? We triumph together; we perish together. It shall be as Mazda
  decrees.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mardonius answered nothing. Long since he had learned the folly of setting
  his will against that of the masterful princess at his side. And was not
  victory certain? Was not Artazostra doing even as Semiramis of Nineveh had
  done of old?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The army is ready, Excellency,&rdquo; declared an adjutant, bowing
  in his saddle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forward, then, but slowly, to await the reconnoitring parties sent
  toward the Greeks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In the gray morning the host wound out of the stockaded camp. The women
  and grooms called fair wishes after them. The far slopes of Cithæron were
  reddening. A breeze whistled down the hills. It would disperse the mist. Soon
  the leader of the scouts came galloping, leaped down and salaamed to the
  general. &ldquo;Let my Lord&rsquo;s liver find peace. All is even as our
  friends declared. The enemy have in part fled far away. The Athenians halt on
  a foot-hill of the mountain. The Laconians sit in companies on the ground,
  waiting their division that will not retreat. Let my Lord charge, and glory
  waits for Eran!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mardonius&rsquo;s cimeter swung high.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forward, all! Mazda fights for us. Bid our allies the Thebans(16)
  attack the Athenians. Ours is the nobler prey&mdash;even the men of
  Sparta.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[16 Who in full force had joined the Persians.]</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Victory to the king!&rdquo; thundered the thousands. Confident of
  triumph, Mardonius suffered the ranks to be broken, as his myriads rushed
  onward. Over the Asopus and its shallow fords they swept, and raced across
  the plain-land. Horse mingled with foot; Persians with Tartars. The howlings
  in a score of tongues, the bray of cymbals and kettledrums, the clamour of
  spear-butts beaten on armour&mdash;who may tell it? Having unleashed his wild
  beasts, Mardonius dashed before to guide their ragings as he might. The white
  Nisæan and its companion led the way across the hard plain. Behind, as when
  in the springtime flood the watery wall goes crashing down the valley, so
  spread the thousands. A god looking from heaven would not have forgotten that
  sight of whirling plumes, plunging steeds, flying steel, in all the æons.</p>

  <p>Five stadia, six, seven, eight,&mdash;so Mardonius led. Already before him
  he could see the glistering crests and long files of the Spartans&mdash;the
  prey he would crush with one stroke as a vulture swoops over the sparrow.
  Then nigh involuntarily his hand drew rein. What came to greet him? A man on
  foot&mdash;no horseman even. A man of huge stature running at headlong
  speed.</p>

  <p>The risen sun was now dazzling. The general clapped his hand above his
  eyes. Then a tug on the bridle sent the Nisæan on his haunches.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lycon, as Mazda made me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Spartan was beside them soon, he had run so swiftly. He was so dazed
  he barely heeded Mardonius&rsquo;s call to halt and tell his tale. He was
  almost naked. His face was black with fear, never more brutish or
  loathsome.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All is betrayed. Democrates is seized. Pausanias and Aristeides are
  warned. They will give you fair battle. I barely escaped.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who betrayed you?&rdquo; cried the Prince.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon the Alcmæonid, he is risen from the dead. <i>Ai!</i> woe!
  no fault of mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Never before had the son of Gobryas smiled so fiercely as when the giant
  cowered beneath his darting eyes. The general&rsquo;s sword whistled down on
  the skull of the traitor. The Laconian sprawled in the dust without a groan.
  Mardonius laughed horribly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fair price then for unlucky villany. Blessed be Mithra, who
  suffers me to give recompense. Wish me joy,&rdquo;&mdash;as his captains came
  galloping around him,&mdash;&ldquo;our duty to the king is finished. We shall
  win Hellas in fair battle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then it were well, Excellency,&rdquo; thrust in Artabazus,
  &ldquo;since the plot is foiled, to retire to the camp.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mardonius&rsquo;s eyes flashed lightnings.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s counsel that! Are we not here to conquer Hellas? Yes,
  by Mithra the Glorious, we will fight, though every <i>dæva</i> in hell joins
  against us. Re-form the ranks. Halt the charge. Let the bowmen crush the
  Spartans with their arrows. Then we will see if these Greeks are stouter than
  Babylonian, Lydian, and Egyptian who played their game with Persia to sore
  cost. And you, Artabazus, to your rear-guard, and do your duty
  well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The general bowed stiffly. He knew the son of Gobryas, and that
  disobedience would have brought Mardonius&rsquo;s cimeter upon his own
  helmet. By a great effort the charge was stayed,&mdash;barely in
  time,&mdash;for to have flung that disorganized horde on the waiting Spartan
  spears would have been worse than madness. A single stadium sundered the two
  hosts when Mardonius brought his men to a stand, set his strong divisions of
  bowmen in array behind their wall of shields, and drew up his cavalry on the
  flanks of the bowmen. Battle he would give, but it must be cautious battle
  now, and he did not love the silence which reigned among the motionless lines
  of the Spartans.</p>

  <p>It was bright day at last. The two armies&mdash;the whole strength of the
  Barbarian, the Spartans with only their Tegean allies&mdash;stood facing, as
  athletes measuring strength before the grapple. The Spartan line was thinner
  than Mardonius&rsquo;s: no cavalry, few bowmen, but shield was set beside
  shield, and everywhere tossed the black and scarlet plumes of the helmets.
  Men who remembered Thermopylæ gripped their spear-stocks tighter. No long
  postponing now. On this narrow field, this bit of pebble and greensward, the
  gods would cast the last dice for the destiny of Hellas. All knew that.</p>

  <p>The stolidity of the Spartans was maddening. They stood like bronze
  statues. In clear view at the front was a tall man in scarlet chlamys, and
  two more in white,&mdash;Pausanias and his seers examining the entrails of
  doves, seeking a fair omen for the battle. Mardonius drew the turban lower
  over his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An end to this truce. Begin your arrows.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A cloud of bolts answered him. The Persian archers emptied their quivers.
  They could see men falling among the foe, but still Pausanias stood beside
  the seers, still he gave no signal to advance. The omens doubtless were
  unfavourable. His men never shifted a foot as the storm of death flew over
  them. Their rigidity was more terrifying than any battle-shout. What were
  these men whose iron discipline bound so fast that they could be pelted to
  death, and no eyelash seem to quiver? The archers renewed their volley. They
  shot against a rock. The Barbarians joined in one rending yell,&mdash;their
  answer was silence.</p>

  <p>Deliberately, arrows dropping around him as tree-blossoms in the gale,
  Pausanias raised his hand. The omens were good. The gods permitted battle.
  Deliberately, while men fell dying, he walked to his post on the right wing.
  Deliberately, while heaven seemed shaking with the Barbarians&rsquo; clamour,
  his hand went up again. Through a lull in the tumult pealed a trumpet.
  <i>Then the Spartans marched.</i></p>

  <p>Slowly their lines of bristling spear-points and nodding crests moved on
  like the sea-waves. Shrill above the booming Tartar drums, the blaring
  Persian war-horns pierced the screams of their pipers. And the Barbarians
  heard that which had never met their ears before,&mdash;the chanting of their
  foes as the long line crept nearer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&mdash;la&mdash;la&mdash;la&mdash;la!
  Ah!&mdash;la&mdash;la&mdash;la&mdash;la!&rdquo; deep, prolonged, bellowed in
  chorus from every bronze visor which peered above the serried shields.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Faster,&rdquo; stormed the Persian captains to their slingers and
  bowmen, &ldquo;beat these madmen down.&rdquo; The rain of arrows and
  sling-stones was like hail, like hail it rattled from the shields and helms.
  Here, there, a form sank, the inexorable phalanx closed and swept onward.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&mdash;la&mdash;la&mdash;la!
  Ah!&mdash;la&mdash;la&mdash;la!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The chant never ceased. The pipers screamed more shrilly. Eight deep,
  unhasting, unresting, Pausanias was bringing his heavy infantry across the
  two hundred paces betwixt himself and Mardonius. His Spartan spearmen might
  be unlearned, doltish, but they knew how to do one deed and that surpassingly
  well,&mdash;to march in line though lightnings dashed from heaven, and to
  thrust home with their lances. And not a pitiful three hundred, but ten
  thousand bold and strong stood against the Barbarian that morning. Mardonius
  was facing the finest infantry in the world, and the avenging of Leonidas was
  nigh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&mdash;la&mdash;la&mdash;la!
  Ah!&mdash;la&mdash;la&mdash;la!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Flesh and blood in the Persian host could not wait the death grip longer.
  &ldquo;Let us charge, or let us flee,&rdquo; many a stout officer cried to
  his chief, and he sitting stern-eyed on the white horse gave to a Tartar
  troop its word, &ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then like a mountain stream the wild Tartars charged. The clods flew high
  under the hoofs. The yell of the riders, the shock of spears on shields, the
  cry of dying men and dying beasts, the stamping, the dust-cloud, took but a
  moment. The chant of the Spartans ceased&mdash;an instant. An instant the
  long phalanx halted, from end to end bent and swayed. Then the dust-cloud
  passed, the chanting renewed. Half of the Tartars were spurring back, with
  shivered lances, bleeding steeds. The rest,&mdash;but the phalanx shook now
  here, now there, as the impenetrable infantry strode over red forms that had
  been men and horses. And still the Spartans marched, still the pipes and the
  war-chant.</p>

  <p>Then for the first time fear entered the heart of Mardonius, son of
  Gobryas, and he called to the thousand picked horsemen, who rode beside
  him,&mdash;not Tartars these, but Persians and Medes of lordly stock, men who
  had gone forth conquering and to conquer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now as your fathers followed Cyrus the Invincible and Darius the
  Dauntless, follow you me. Since for the honour of Eran and the king I ride
  this day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We ride. For Eran and the king!&rdquo; shouted the thousand. All
  the host joined. Mardonius led straight against the Spartan right wing where
  Pausanias&rsquo;s life-guard marched.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Old soldiers of Lacedæmon fighting their battles in the
  after days, when a warrior of Platæa was as a god to each youth in Hellas,
  would tell how the Persian cavalrymen rode their phalanx down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And say never,&rdquo; they always added, &ldquo;the Barbarians know
  not how to fight and how to die. Fools say it, not we of Platæa. For our
  first line seemed broken in a twinkling. The Pitanate <i>mora</i> was cut to
  pieces; Athena Promachus and Ares the City-Waster alone turned back that
  charge when Mardonius led the way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But turned it was. And the thousand horse, no thousand now, drifted to the
  cover of their shield wall, raging, undaunted, yet beaten back.</p>

  <p>Then at last the phalanx locked with the Persian footmen and their rampart
  of wicker shields. At short spear length men grinned in each other&rsquo;s
  faces, while their veins were turned to fire. Many a soldier&mdash;Spartan,
  Aryan&mdash;had seen his twenty fights, but never a fight like this. And the
  Persians&mdash;those that knew Greek&mdash;heard words flung through their
  foemen&rsquo;s helmets that made each Hellene fight as ten.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Remember Leonidas! Remember Thermopylæ!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Orders there were none; the trumpets were drowned in the tumult. Each man
  fought as he stood, knowing only he must slay the man before him, while
  slowly, as though by a cord tighter and ever tighter drawn, the Persian
  shield wall was bending back before the unrelenting thrusting of the
  Spartans. Then as a cord snaps so broke the barrier. One instant down and the
  Hellenes were sweeping the light-armed Asiatic footmen before them, as the
  scythe sweeps down the standing grain. So with the Persian infantry, for
  their scanty armour and short spears were at terrible disadvantage, but the
  strength of the Barbarian was not spent. Many times Mardonius led the cavalry
  in headlong charge, each repulse the prelude to a fiercer shock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Mazda, for Eran, for the king!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The call of the Prince was a call that turned his wild horsemen into
  demons, but demons who strove with gods. The phalanx was shaken, halted even,
  broken never; and foot by foot, fathom by fathom, it brushed the Barbarian
  horde back across the blood-bathed plain,&mdash;and to Mardonius&rsquo;s
  shout, a more terrible always answered:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Remember Leonidas! Remember Thermopylæ!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Prince seemed to bear a charmed life as he fought. He was in the
  thickest fray. He sent the white Nisæan against the Laconian spears and beat
  down a dozen lance-points with his sword. If one man&rsquo;s valour could
  have turned the tide, his would have wrought the miracle. And always behind,
  almost in reach of the Grecian sling-stones, rode that other,&mdash;the page
  in the silvered mail,&mdash;nor did any harm come to this rider. But after
  the fight had raged so long that men sank unwounded,&mdash;gasping, stricken
  by the heat and press,&mdash;the Prince drew back a little from the fray to a
  rising in the plain, where close by a rural temple of Demeter he could watch
  the drifting fight, and he saw the Aryans yielding ground finger by finger,
  yet yielding, and the phalanx impregnable as ever. Then he sent an aide with
  an urgent message.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To Artabazus and the reserve. Bid him take from the camp all the
  guards, every man, every eunuch that can lift a spear, and come with speed,
  or the day is lost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The adjutant&rsquo;s spurs grew red as he pricked away, while Mardonius
  wheeled the Nisæan and plunged back into the thickest fight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Mazda, for Eran, for the king!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His battle-call pealed even above the hellish din. The Persian nobles who
  had never ridden to aught save victory turned again. Their last charge was
  their fiercest. They bent the phalanx back like an inverted bow. Their
  footmen, reckless of self, plunged on the Greeks and snapped off the
  spear-points with their naked hands. Mardonius was never prouder of his host
  than in that hour. Proud&mdash;but the charge was vain. As the tide swept
  back, as the files of the Spartans locked once more, he knew his men had done
  their uttermost. They had fought since dawn. Their shield wall was broken.
  Their quivers were empty. Was not Mazda turning against them? Had not enough
  been dared for that king who lounged at ease in Sardis?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Mazda, for Eran, for the king!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mardonius&rsquo;s shout had no answer. Here, there, he saw horsemen and
  footmen, now singly, now in small companies, drifting backward across the
  plain to the last refuge of the defeated, the stockaded camp by the Asopus.
  The Prince called on his cavalry, so few about him now.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shall we die as scared dogs? Remember the Aryan glory. Another
  charge!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His bravest seemed never to hear him. The onward thrust of the phalanx
  quickened. It was gaining ground swiftly at last. Then the Spartans were
  dashing forward like men possessed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Athenians have vanquished the Thebans. They come to join us.
  On, men of Lacedæmon, ours alone must be this victory!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The shout of Pausanias was echoed by his captains. To the left and not far
  off charged a second phalanx,&mdash;five thousand nodding crests and gleaming
  points,&mdash;Aristeides bringing his whole array to his allies&rsquo;
  succour. But his help was not needed. The sight of his coming dashed out the
  last courage of the Barbarians. Before the redoubled shock of the Spartans
  the Asiatics crumbled like sand. Even whilst these broke once more, the
  adjutant drew rein beside Mardonius.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord, Artabazus is coward or traitor. Believing the battle lost, he
  has fled. There is no help to bring.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Prince bowed his head an instant, while the flight surged round him.
  The Nisæan was covered with blood, but his rider spurred him across the path
  of a squadron of flying Medians.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Turn! Are you grown women!&rdquo; Mardonius smote the nearest with
  his sword. &ldquo;If we cannot as Aryans conquer, let us at least as Aryans
  die!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ai! ai!</i> Mithra deserts us. Artabazus is fled. Save who
  can!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They swept past him. He flung himself before a band of Tartars. He had
  better pleaded with the north wind to stay its course. Horse, foot,
  Babylonians, Ethiopians, Persians, Medes, were huddled in fleeing rout.
  &ldquo;To the camp,&rdquo; their cry, but Mardonius, looking on the onrushing
  phalanxes knew there was no refuge there....</p>

  <p>And now sing it, O mountains and rivers of Hellas. Sing it, Asopus, to
  Spartan Eurotas, and you to hill-girt Alphæus. And let the maidens,
  white-robed and poppy-crowned, sweep in thanksgiving up to the welcoming
  temples,&mdash;honouring Zeus of the Thunders, Poseidon the Earth-Shaker,
  Athena the Mighty in War. The Barbarian is vanquished. The ordeal is ended.
  Thermopylæ was not in vain, nor Salamis. Hellas is saved, and with her saved
  the world.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Again on the knoll by the temple, apart from the rushing
  fugitives, Mardonius reined. His companion was once more beside him. He
  leaned that she might hear him through the tumult.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The battle is lost. The camp is defenceless. What shall we
  do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Artazostra flung back the gold-laced cap and let the sun play over her
  face and hair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are Aryans,&rdquo; was all her answer.</p>

  <p>He understood, but even whilst he was reaching out to catch her bridle
  that their horses might run together, he saw her lithe form bend. The arrow
  from a Laconian helot had smitten through the silvered mail. He saw the red
  spring out over her breast. With a quick grasp he swung her before him on the
  white horse. She smiled up in his face, never lovelier.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon was right,&rdquo; she said,&mdash;their lips were very
  close,&mdash;&ldquo;Zeus and Athena are greater than Mazda and Mithra. The
  future belongs to Hellas. But we have naught for shame. We have fought as
  Aryans, as the children of conquerors and kings. We shall be glad together in
  Garonmana the Blessed, and what is left to dread?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A quiver passed through her. The Spartan spear-line was close. Mardonius
  looked once across the field. His men were fleeing like sheep. And so it
  passed,&mdash;the dream of a satrapy of Hellas, of wider conquests, of an
  empire of the world. He kissed the face of Artazostra and pressed her still
  form against his breast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Mazda, for Eran, for the king!&rdquo; he shouted, and threw
  away his sword. Then he turned the head of his wounded steed and rode on the
  Spartan lances.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch40"
     name="ch40"></a>XL. -- THE SONG OF THE FURIES</h2>

  <p class="first">Themistocles had started from Oropus with Simonides, a small
  guard of mariners, and a fettered prisoner, as soon as the
  <i>Nausicaä&rsquo;s</i>people were a little rested. Half the night they
  themselves were plodding on wearily. At Tanagra the following afternoon a
  runner with a palm branch met them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mardonius is slain. Artabazus with the rear-guard has fled
  northward. The Athenians aided by the Spartans stormed the camp. Glory to
  Athena, who gives us victory!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And the traitors?&rdquo; Themistocles showed surprisingly little
  joy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lycon&rsquo;s body was found drifting in the Asopus. Democrates
  lies fettered by Aristeides&rsquo;s tents.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then the other Athenians broke forth into pæans, but Themistocles bowed
  his head and was still, though the messenger told how Pausanias and his
  allies had taken countless treasure, and now were making ready to attack
  disloyal Thebes. So the admiral and his escort went at leisure across
  B&oelig;otia, till they reached the Hellenic host still camped near the
  battle-field. There Themistocles was long in conference with Aristeides and
  Pausanias. After midnight he left Aristeides&rsquo;s tent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is the prisoner?&rdquo; he asked of the sentinel before the
  headquarters.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your Excellency means the traitor?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will guide you.&rdquo; The soldier took a torch and led the way.
  The two went down dark avenues of tents, and halted at one where five
  hoplites stood guard with their spears ready, five more slept before the
  entrance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We watch him closely, <i>kyrie</i>,&rdquo; explained the decarch,
  saluting. &ldquo;Naturally we fear suicide as well as escape. Two more are
  within the tent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Withdraw them. Do you all stand at distance. For what happens I
  will be responsible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The two guards inside emerged yawning. Themistocles took the torch and
  entered the squalid hair-cloth pavilion. The sentries noticed he had a casket
  under his cloak.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The prisoner sleeps,&rdquo; said a hoplite, &ldquo;in spite of his
  fetters.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Themistocles set down the casket and carefully drew the tent-flap. With
  silent tread he approached the slumberer. The face was upturned; white it
  was, but it showed the same winsome features that had won the clappings a
  hundred times in the Pnyx. The sleep seemed heavy, dreamless.</p>

  <p>Themistocles&rsquo;s own lips tightened as he stood in contemplation, then
  he bent to touch the other&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Democrates,&rdquo;&mdash;no answer.
  &ldquo;Democrates,&rdquo;&mdash;still silence.
  &ldquo;Democrates,&rdquo;&mdash;a stirring, a clanking of metal. The eyes
  opened,&mdash;for one instant a smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ei</i>, Themistocles, it is you?&rdquo; to be succeeded by a
  flash of unspeakable horror. &ldquo;O Zeus, the gyves! That I should come to
  this!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The prisoner rose to a sitting posture upon his truss of straw. His
  fettered hands seized his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; ordered the admiral, gently. &ldquo;Do not rave. I
  have sent the sentries away. No one will hear us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates grew calmer. &ldquo;You are merciful. You do not know how I was
  tempted. You will save me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will do all I can.&rdquo; Themistocles&rsquo;s voice was solemn
  as an æolian harp, but the prisoner caught at everything eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, you can do so much. Pausanias fought the battle, but they call
  you the true saviour of Hellas. They will do anything you say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am glad.&rdquo; Themistocles&rsquo;s face was impenetrable as the
  sphinx&rsquo;s. Democrates seized the admiral&rsquo;s red chlamys with his
  fettered hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will save me! I will fly to Sicily, Carthage, the Tin Isles, as
  you wish. Have you forgotten our old-time friendship?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I loved you,&rdquo; spoke the admiral, tremulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, recall that love to-night!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O piteous Zeus, why then is your face so awful? If you will aid me
  to escape&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will aid you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blessings, blessings, but quick! I fear to be stoned to death by
  the soldiers in the morning. They threaten to crucify&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They shall not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blessings, blessings,&mdash;can I escape to-night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; but Themistocles&rsquo;s tone made the prisoner&rsquo;s
  blood run chill. He cowered helplessly. The admiral stood, his own fine face
  covered with a mingling of pity, contempt, pain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Democrates, hearken,&rdquo;&mdash;his voice was hard as flint.
  &ldquo;We have seized your camp chest, found the key to your ciphers, and
  know all your correspondence with Lycon. We have discovered your fearful
  power of forgery. Hermes the Trickster gave it you for your own destruction.
  We have brought Hiram hither from the ship. This night he has ridden the
  &lsquo;Little Horse.&rsquo;(17) He has howled out everything. We have seized
  Bias and heard his story. There is nothing to conceal. From the beginning of
  your peculation of the public money, till the moment when, the prisoners say,
  you were in Mardonius&rsquo;s camp, all is known to us. You need not confess.
  There is nothing worth confessing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[17 The rack.]</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo;&mdash;great beads were on the prisoner&rsquo;s
  brow,&mdash;&ldquo;but you do not realize the temptation. Have you never
  yourself been betwixt Scylla and Charybdis? Have I not vowed every false step
  should be the last? I fought against Lycon. I fought against Mardonius. They
  were too strong. Athena knoweth I did not crave the tyranny of Athens! It was
  not that which drove me to betray Hellas.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe you. But why did you not trust me at the
  first?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hardly understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When first your need of money drove you to crime, why did you not
  come to me? You knew I loved you. You knew I looked on you as my political
  son and heir in the great work of making Athens the light of Hellas. I would
  have given you the gold,&mdash;yes, fifty talents.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ai, ai</i>, if I had only dared! I thought of it. I was
  afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; Themistocles&rsquo;s lip was curling. &ldquo;You are
  more coward than knave or traitor. Phobos, Black Fear, has been your leading
  god, not Hermes. And now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you have promised I shall escape.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-night? What is that you have?&rdquo; Themistocles was opening
  the casket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The papers seized in your chest. They implicate many noble Hellenes
  in Corinth, Sicyon, Sparta. Behold&mdash;&rdquo; Themistocles held one
  papyrus after another in the torch-flame,&mdash;&ldquo;here is crumbling to
  ashes the evidence that would destroy them all as Medizers. Mardonius is
  dead. Let the war die with him. Hellas is safe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blessings, blessings! Help me to escape. You have a sword. Pry off
  these gyves. How easy for you to let me fly!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; The admiral&rsquo;s peremptory voice silenced the
  prisoner. Themistocles finished his task. Suddenly, however, Democrates
  howled with animal fear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are you taking now&mdash;a goblet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; Themistocles was indeed holding a silver cup and
  flask. &ldquo;Have I not said you should escape this
  captivity&mdash;to-night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be quick, then, the night wanes fast.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The admiral strode over beside the creature who plucked at his hem.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give ear again, Democrates. Your crimes against Athens and Hellas
  were wrought under sore temptation. The money you stole from the public
  chest, if not returned already, I will myself make good. So much is
  forgiven.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are a true friend, Themistocles.&rdquo; The prisoner&rsquo;s
  voice was husky, but the admiral&rsquo;s eyes flashed like flint-stones
  struck by the steel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Friend!&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;Yes, by Zeus Orcios, guardian of
  oaths and friendship, you had a friend. Where is he now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates lay on the turf floor of the tent, not even groaning.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You had a friend,&rdquo;&mdash;the admiral&rsquo;s intensity was
  awful. &ldquo;You blasted his good name, you sought his life, you sought his
  wife, you broke every bond, human or divine, to destroy him. At last, to
  silence conscience&rsquo; sting, you thought you did a deed of mercy in
  sending him in captivity to a death in life. Fool! Nemesis is not mocked.
  Glaucon has lain at death&rsquo;s door. He has saved Hellas, but at a price.
  The surgeons say he will live, but that his foot is crippled. Glaucon can
  never run again. You have brought him misery. You have brought anguish to
  Hermione, the noblest woman in Hellas, whom you&mdash;ah!
  mockery&mdash;professed to hold in love! You have done worse than murder. Yet
  I have promised you shall escape this night. Rise up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Democrates staggered to his feet clumsily, only half knowing what he did.
  Themistocles was extending the silver cup. &ldquo;Escape. Drink!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is this cup?&rdquo; The prisoner had turned gray.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hemlock, coward! Did you not bid Glaucon to take his life that
  night in Colonus? The death you proffered him in his innocency I proffer you
  now in your guilt. Drink!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have called me friend. You have said you loved me. I dare not
  die. A little time! Pity! Mercy! What god can I invoke?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None. Cerberus himself would not hearken to such as you.
  Drink.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pity, by our old-time friendship!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The admiral&rsquo;s tall form straightened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Themistocles the Friend is dead; Themistocles the Just is
  here,&mdash;drink.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you promised escape?&rdquo; The prisoner&rsquo;s whisper was
  just audible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, truly, from the court-martial before the roaring camp in the
  morning, the unmasking of all your accomplices, the deeper shame of every
  one-time friend, the blazoning of your infamy in public evidence through
  Hellas, the soldiers howling for your blood, the stoning, perchance the
  plucking in pieces. By the gods Olympian, by the gods Infernal, do your past
  lovers one last service&mdash;drink!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That was not all Themistocles said, that was all Democrates heard. In his
  ears sounded, even once again, the song of the Furies,&mdash;never so clearly
  as now.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;With scourge and with ban<br>
  We prostrate the man<br>
  Who with smooth-woven wile<br>
  And a fair-facèd smile<br>
  Hath planted a snare for his friend!<br>
  Though fleet, we shall find him,<br>
  Though strong, we shall bind him,<br>
  Who planted a snare for his friend!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Nemesis&mdash;Nemesis, the implacable goddess, had come for her own at
  last.</p>

  <p>Democrates took the cup.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch41"
     name="ch41"></a>XLI. -- THE BRIGHTNESS OF HELIOS</h2>

  <p class="first">The day that disloyal Thebes surrendered came the tidings of
  the crowning of the Hellenes&rsquo; victories. At Mycale by Samos the Greek
  fleets had disembarked their crews and defeated the Persians almost at the
  doors of the Great King in Sardis. Artabazus had escaped through Thrace to
  Asia in caitiff flight. The war&mdash;at least the perilous part
  thereof&mdash;was at end. There might be more battles with the Barbarian, but
  no second Salamis or Platæa.</p>

  <p>The Spartans had found the body of Mardonius pierced with five
  lances&mdash;all in front. Pausanias had honoured the brave dead,&mdash;the
  Persian had been carried from the battle-ground on a shield, and covered by
  the red cloak of a Laconian general. But the body mysteriously disappeared.
  Its fate was never known. Perhaps the curious would have gladly heard what
  Glaucon on his sick-bed told Themistocles, and what Sicinnus did afterward.
  Certain it is that the shrewd Asiatic later displayed a costly ring which the
  satrap Zariaspes, Mardonius&rsquo;s cousin, sent him &ldquo;for a great
  service to the house of Gobryas.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">On the same day that Thebes capitulated the household of
  Hermippus left Tr&oelig;zene to return to Athens. When they had told Hermione
  all that had befallen,&mdash;the great good, the little ill,&mdash;she had
  not fainted, though Cleopis had been sure thereof. The colour had risen to
  her cheeks, the love-light to her eyes. She went to the cradle where
  Ph&oelig;nix cooed and tossed his baby feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Little one, little one,&rdquo; she said, while he beamed up at her,
  &ldquo;you have not to avenge your father now. You have a better, greater
  task, to be as fair in body and still more in mind as he.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then came the rush of tears, the sobbing, the laughter, and Lysistra and
  Cleopis, who feared the shock of too much joy, were glad.</p>

  <p>The <i>Nausicaä</i> bore them to Peiræus. The harbour towns were in black
  ruins, for Mardonius had wasted everything before retiring to B&oelig;otia
  for his last battle. In Athens, as they entered it, the houses were roofless,
  the streets scattered with rubbish. But Hermione did not think of these
  things. The Agora at last,&mdash;the porticos were only shattered,
  fire-scarred pillars,&mdash;and everywhere were tents and booths and
  bustle,&mdash;the brisk Athenians wasting no time in lamentation, but busy
  rebuilding and making good the loss. Above Hermione&rsquo;s head rose a few
  blackened columns,&mdash;all that was left of the holy house of
  Athena,&mdash;but the crystalline air and the red Rock of the Acropolis no
  Persian had been able to take away.</p>

  <p>And even as Hermione crossed the Agora she heard a shouting, a word
  running from lip to lip as a wave leaps over the sea.</p>

  <p>In the centre of the buzzing mart she stopped. All the blood sprang to her
  face, then left it. She passed her fingers over her hair, and waited with
  twitching, upturned face. Through the hucksters&rsquo; booths, amid the
  clamouring buyers and sellers, went a runner, striking left and right with
  his staff, for the people were packing close, and he had much ado to clear
  the way. Horsemen next, prancing chargers, the prizes from the Barbarian, and
  after them a litter. Noble youths bore it, sons of the Eupatrid houses of
  Athens. At sight of the litter the buzz of the Agora became a roar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The beautiful! The fortunate! The deliverer! <i>Io! Io,
  pæan!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hermione stood; only her eyes followed the litter. Its curtains were flung
  back; she saw some one within, lying on purple cushions. She saw the
  features, beautiful as Pentelic marble and as pale. She cared not for the
  people. She cared not that Ph&oelig;nix, frighted by the shouting, had begun
  to wail. The statue in the litter moved, rose on one elbow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, dearest and best,&rdquo;&mdash;his voice had the old-time ring,
  his head the old-time poise,&mdash;&ldquo;you need not fear to call me
  husband now!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glaucon,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I am not fit to be your wife. I
  am not fit to kiss your feet.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">They set the litter down. Even little Simonides, though a
  king among the curious, found the Acropolis peculiarly worthy of his study.
  Enough that Hermione&rsquo;s hands were pressing her husband, and these two
  cared not whether a thousand watched or only Helios on high. Penelope was
  greeting the returning Odysseus:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Welcome even as to shipmen<br>
  On the swelling, raging sea;<br>
  When Poseidon flings the whirlwind,<br>
  When a thousand blasts roam free,<br>
  Then at last the land appeareth;&mdash;<br>
  E&rsquo;en so welcome in her sight<br>
  Was her lord, her arms long clasped him,<br>
  And her eyes shone pure and bright.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>After a long time Glaucon commanded, &ldquo;Bring me our child,&rdquo; and
  Cleopis gladly obeyed. Ph&oelig;nix ceased weeping and thrust his red fists
  in his father&rsquo;s face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ei</i>, pretty snail,&rdquo; said Glaucon, pressing him fast by
  one hand, whilst he held his mother by the other, &ldquo;if I say you are a
  merry wight, the nurse will not marvel any more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Hermione had already heard from Niobe of the adventure in the
  market-place at Tr&oelig;zene.</p>

  <p>The young men were just taking up the litter, when the Agora again broke
  into cheers. Themistocles, saviour of Hellas, had crossed to Glaucon. The
  admiral&mdash;never more worshipped than now, when every plan he wove seemed
  perfect as a god&rsquo;s&mdash;took Glaucon and Hermione, one by each
  hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>philotatoi</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to all of us is given
  by the sisters above so much bliss and so much sorrow. Some drink the bitter
  first, some the sweet. And you have drained the bitter to the lees. Therefore
  look up at the Sun-King boldly. He will not darken for you again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where now?&rdquo; asked Hermione, in all things looking to her
  husband.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the Acropolis,&rdquo; ordered Glaucon. &ldquo;If the temple is
  desolate, the Rock is still holy. Let us give thanks to Athena.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He even would have left the litter, had not Themistocles firmly forbidden.
  In time the Alcmæonid&rsquo;s strength would return, though never the speed
  that had left the stadia behind whilst he raced to save Hellas.</p>

  <p>They mounted the Rock. From above, in the old-time brightness, the noonday
  light, the sunlight of Athens, sprang down to them. Hermione, looking on
  Glaucon&rsquo;s face, saw him gaze eagerly upon her, his child, the sacred
  Rock, and the glory from Helios. Then his face wore a strange smile she could
  not understand. She did not know that he was saying in his heart:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I thought for the rose vales of Bactria to
  forfeit&mdash;this!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They were on the summit. The litter was set down on the projecting spur by
  the southwest corner. The area of the Acropolis was desolation, ashes, drums
  of overturned pillars, a few lone and scarred columns. The works of man were
  in ruin, but the works of the god, of yesterday, to-day, and forever were yet
  the same. They turned their backs on the ruin. Westward they
  looked&mdash;across land and sea, beautiful always, most beautiful now, for
  had they not been redeemed with blood and tears? The Barbarian was
  vanquished; the impossible accomplished. Hellas and Athens were their own,
  with none to take away.</p>

  <p>They saw the blue bay of Phaleron. They saw the craggy height of Munychia,
  Salamis with its strait of the victory, farther yet the brown dome of
  Acro-Corinthus and the wide breast of the clear Saronian sea. To the left was
  Hymettus the Shaggy, to right the long crest of Daphni, behind them rose
  Pentelicus, home of the marble that should take the shape of the gods. With
  one voice they fell to praising Athens and Hellas, wisely or foolishly,
  according to their wit. Only Hermione and Glaucon kept silence, hand within
  hand, and speaking fast,&mdash;not with their lips,&mdash;but with their
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Then at the end Themistocles spoke, and as always spoke the best.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have flung back the Barbarian. We have set our might against the
  God-King and have conquered. Athens lies in ruins. We shall rebuild her. We
  shall make her more truly than before the &lsquo;Beautiful,&rsquo; the
  &lsquo;Violet-Crowned City,&rsquo; worthy of the guardian Athena. The
  conquering of the Persian was hard. The making of Athens immortal by the
  beauty of our lives, and words, and deeds is harder. Yet in this also we
  shall conquer. Yea, verily, for the day shall come that wherever the eye is
  charmed by the beautiful, the heart is thrilled by the noble, or the soul
  yearns after the perfect,&mdash;there in the spirit shall stand
  Athens.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">After they had prayed to the goddess, they went down from
  the Rock and its vision of beauty. Below a mule car met them. They set
  Glaucon and Hermione with the babe therein, and these three were driven over
  the Sacred Way toward the purple-bosomed hills, through the olive groves and
  the pine trees, across the slope of Daphni, to rest and peace in
  Eleusis-by-the-Sea.</p>
