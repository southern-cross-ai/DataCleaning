  <h2><a name="pre"
     id="pre"></a>PREFACE TO FIFTH EDITION</h2>

  <p class="first">This historical novel is the second in a series of five
  which the writer has composed from the history of The Netherlands, a subject
  hitherto untouched by English romancers. <i>Prince and Heretic</i> dealt with
  William I of Orange (called in English "William the Silent"), in the early
  days of his career, and with his first marriage, and the beginning of the
  revolt in The Netherlands, those northern provinces of Philip II's Dutch
  dominions which finally wrested themselves free from his power, and
  constituted the Dutch Republic, the first free country in Europe.</p>

  <p>The present story, which is a sequel to the first, brings us into the
  heart of the struggle, and commences when the prospects of the Dutch looked
  dark and even disastrous. The tale introduces William as a fugitive, but in
  no way dispirited or disheartened, and still animated by that intense ardour
  and enthusiasm for the work to which he had set his hand and which was, in
  the end, to prove eminently successful.</p>

  <p>The effect of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew on the cause and on the
  Prince next follows. The book covers the battle of Mookerheide, with the
  tragic death of the two young Nassau princes, the brothers of William, the
  siege of Leiden, and finally the assassination of William at Delft by Gèrard,
  the fanatic Burgundian.</p>

  <p>The story, however, does not end on a note of despair, for, if William of
  Nassau was killed, his son Maurice of Nassau lived; and that son was to prove
  a more than worthy successor to his great father, and regain for The
  Netherlands many towns and villages, and to set on a firm basis the Dutch
  Republic that his brother, Frederic Henry, was to raise to a bright pinnacle
  of glory.</p>

  <p>Women do not play a great part in this story, which is essentially of men
  and men's affairs, and deals with the building up of a nation; but there are
  portraits of Charlotte of Bourbon, the one-time nun, and Louise, the last
  wives of William of Orange, and the devotion of an obscure lady-in-waiting
  runs like a quiet <i>obbligato</i> through all the affairs of state and all
  the pomp of war.</p>

  <p>Nearly a hundred years later, the Dutch Republic, built up by William of
  Orange and his friends and sup porters into one of the great powers of
  Europe, was again in grave danger&mdash;this time in peril of utter
  extinction by a foreign foe, as it had been through the efforts of the King
  of Spain in peril of utter extinction almost before it was created.</p>

  <p>This time it was France that swept The Netherlands, and again it was a
  Prince of the House of Orange who rescued them. This story, one of the most
  splendid in modern history, is told in the three books, <i>I Will Maintain,
  Defender of the Faith, God and The King</i>, which carries the story of
  Holland down to the opening years of the eighteenth century.</p>

  <p>The last of this series covers the history of England at that period as
  well, the fortunes of the two nations being then one; nor is the story of
  William the Silent without interest for English readers, for it touches our
  story at many points&mdash;Philip II, his grim opponent, was the husband of
  one of our English queens, Mary Tudor, and her Protestant sister, Queen
  Elizabeth, did send help to William the Silent, though perhaps in a paltry
  measure. Sidney and Leicester are still well-known names in The Netherlands,
  and there are few towns which have not some memory of the help given by
  England to the Dutch in the sixteenth century. Zutphen is still celebrated as
  the spot where the famous Sir Philip Sidney met his end, and there can be no
  doubt that the firm resistance of the Dutch to the aggressions of Spain did
  keep at bay a most formidable foreign power that was striving, with every
  effort, to reduce the prestige and even the very existence of England, the
  England as was then established after the Reformation.</p>

  <p>English volunteers in considerable numbers also helped Maurice of Nassau,
  later Prince of Orange, though he had no official assistance from England,
  and the names of the Veres and Charles Morgan are still strongly associated
  with these long wars in the Low Countries, only finally terminated by the
  Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which put an end to these religious conflicts:
  thus concluding the long struggle for the Dutch Independence and the Thirty
  Years War in Germany which, for a great part of the time, ran side by side
  with it, and which produced another great Protestant hero from the north,
  Gustavus-Adolphus, to assist in holding back the power of Rome and the
  princes helped and inspired by Rome. How far these wars were really political
  and how far really religious, it is now impossible to decide, then as now
  men's motives being so mixed; but, with all the allowances made for the
  intrigues of politicians and the ambitions of princes, there can be no doubt
  that these Protestants&mdash;from kings to peasants&mdash;were fighting, in
  the main, for the cause of liberty, and struggling to break away from
  tyrannies Which had become insupportable, and which were represented by
  Catholic powers&mdash;the Pope, the Emperor, the Kings of France and
  Spain&mdash;all, on their several occasions, striving to overwhelm and
  destroy the countries of the north which had adopted the reformed religion:
  England, The Netherlands and Scandinavia, and parts of Germany itself, the
  cradle of the Reformation.</p>

  <p>It is this struggle, continuing for so many years, which is the main theme
  of these five romances of which this is the second; and, though the heroes
  change, the cause does not, and the theme, though treated with many varieties
  of scene and character, remains identical from first to last of these five
  books.</p>

  <p>Though written mainly from a Protestant angle, they contain no prejudice
  whatever against the Roman Catholics, in whose cause many grand figures
  fought, and for whose politics and outlook there was, of course, a great deal
  to be said; and who had, in many of their pretensions, considerable
  justification, at least in the matter of worldly rights. One need cherish no
  bias for one side or the other to be enabled to appreciate the stories of
  these Princes of the House of Orange, and their long and persistent struggles
  against unequal odds.</p>

  <h2><a name="pt1"
     id="pt1"></a>PART I. "OUT OF THE DEPTHS"</h2>

  <h2>I. &mdash; MYNHEER CERTAIN</h2>

  <p class="first">A man was travelling through the Palatine towards the Nassau
  country; he rode a shabby little horse and his plain riding suit was both
  worn and mended, a cloak of dark blue Tabinet protected him from the March
  winds and a leaf hat without a buckle was pulled over his face.</p>

  <p>He rode steadily until he came to an inn, the only house visible in all
  the long grey road, and there he dismounted, took his horse himself to the
  stable, then passed into the parlour and, going straight to the fire, warmed
  his hands with an air of pleasure and good humour.</p>

  <p>Two other men were there, travellers like himself; they looked at him
  keenly, with suspicion, apprehension ready to change into open enmity.</p>

  <p>One of these addressed the new-comer.</p>

  <p>"Early in the year and late in the day to be on the road," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"I come from France," was the answer, "business that will not wait forces
  me to overlook time and season."</p>

  <p>"My name is Certain," he added, "a poor merchant from the
  Netherlands."</p>

  <p>He smiled at them, advanced to the table and seated himself there, looking
  at his companions still with that smiling intentness.</p>

  <p>He had revealed himself as a man of middle height, hardly yet in his full
  maturity, his figure and his bearing were both notably graceful, his hands
  extremely fine, his head was small, his complexion olive, his eyes and
  cropped hair brown, his beard shaved close; a muslin collar finished his
  ancient green suit; he wore no jewels nor ornaments; at his waist hung a
  short sword and a frayed leather wallet.</p>

  <p>There was something remarkable in his appearance that caused the other two
  to gaze at him with undiminished curiosity.</p>

  <p>Mynheer Certain, for his part, had soon summed up them and knew them very
  accurately for what they were, a French pastor of the Calvinist faith and a
  German clerk or shopkeeper of the poorer sort.</p>

  <p>"You appear to doubt me," said the merchant pleasantly; he tapped on the
  table and when the drawer came ordered wine.</p>

  <p>"I doubt the name you gave us," returned the French man; "who in these
  times travels under his own name?"</p>

  <p>"And I," said the other, "was wondering at your nationality&mdash;from the
  Netherlands you say! I did not know that Alva had left any Netherlanders
  alive."</p>

  <p>"A few," Mynheer Certain still smiled.</p>

  <p>"So few that we may consider it a country lost from the world, a nation
  consumed with the fires of its own homesteads," he said, and he looked with a
  certain commiseration at the Netherlander.</p>

  <p>"You think, then, there is no hope for my unhappy land?" asked that
  person.</p>

  <p>"None," said the Calvinist. "The wrath of the Lord has unchained a devil
  upon them. Evil has strangled there truth and piety&mdash;as in
  France&mdash;where indeed can the Reformed Faith claim a foothold save in
  this realm of the Elector Palatine? You are of the Reformed Faith?"</p>

  <p>"Of the Reformed Faith, yes."</p>

  <p>The wine had been brought, and the merchant was drinking it slowly, with
  the relish of a tired man.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said the German, "you have lost everything under Alva?"</p>

  <p>Mynheer Certain gave his ready smile; his face, though lined with fatigue,
  was charming in contour and expression, and his manner was one of exquisite
  courtesy.</p>

  <p>"Everything," he answered. "My property, my houses,&mdash;my son&mdash;my
  dignities, my revenues, my country. For I am an outlaw, an exile. Under the
  ban of King Philip."</p>

  <p>"For your faith, Monsieur?" asked the Calvinsit with sympathy.</p>

  <p>"For that, yes."</p>

  <p>"You must hate Alva," said the German.</p>

  <p>"Hate Alva?" repeated Mynheer Certain. "I do not know if I hate
  Alva&mdash;or King Philip."</p>

  <p>"You have, then, no wish for revenge?" asked the pastor. "No wish to
  assist your wretched brethren, who, like you, have not only lost their all,
  but are under the hellish dominion of Spain?"</p>

  <p>"Every wish," returned the merchant gently, "but no means."</p>

  <p>"You are yourself a fugitive?" asked the pastor. "You fly, like all the
  persecuted, to the Court of the Elector Frederic?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the Netherlander. "I am employed by a French house, trading in
  wool. I make my living."</p>

  <p>The Calvinist regarded him with some contempt.</p>

  <p>"You are too young to be so idle&mdash;there are men fighting for the
  Reformed Faith&mdash;fighting."</p>

  <p>"Fighting in a hopeless cause," added the young German.</p>

  <p>"So some say," said Mynheer Certain. He finished his wine and pushed back
  his chair. "Since Condé died at Jarnac&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Neither of the others answered; the fatal name of Jarnac, where the
  Protestants had gone down to final defeat before the Catholic legions of
  France, silenced them.</p>

  <p>Only the Netherlander spoke, completing his sentence.</p>

  <p>"Who is there to take his place?"</p>

  <p>"Coligny," said the pastor with a flash of hope.</p>

  <p>"A great man&mdash;a helpless one," replied the merchant.</p>

  <p>"The Prince of Nassau," said the clerk. He rose, brushing his hat with his
  coat sleeve.</p>

  <p>"They are but as dust before the wind of Philip's wrath," returned the
  Calvinist. "And the Prince of Orange&mdash;he failed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Failed so often," remarked Mynheer Certain, "failed so utterly."</p>

  <p>"A great name once," said the German, "a great gentle man, too. I was in
  Leipsic when he was married to the Elector's niece."</p>

  <p>The merchant looked at him sharply.</p>

  <p>"You were there?"</p>

  <p>"I, yes. I used to work for the Elector's alchemist. What an excitement
  that marriage was!&mdash;the Prince was Catholic then and we all thought that
  it was a cruelty to the Princess," he laughed. "She has proved to be a mad
  woman and a wanton too, they say, a disgrace to a proud family."</p>

  <p>"Speak of what you know," reproved the merchant sternly, "the name of the
  Princess of Orange is not for vulgar handling."</p>

  <p>"I speak of what all the world knows," returned the young man lightly. "A
  great wedding," he repeated. "I saw the Prince once, but it seems a thousand
  years ago&mdash;now he is an outlaw like yourself, Mynheer Certain."</p>

  <p>"He failed; he failed!" cried the Calvinist impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Who was he to withstand Philip?" demanded the German, clapping on his
  hat. "Though he had titles which would fill a parchment roll and the revenue
  of an Emperor&mdash;yet Philip! 'Tis the greatest king in the world, what
  subject of his could dream rebellion against him?"</p>

  <p>"He of whom you speak," said the merchant quietly, "is no subject of
  Philip, but a sovereign ruler&mdash;Prince of Orange, by the Grace of
  God."</p>

  <p>"By the Grace of God," repeated the Calvinist. "May be yet, God will use
  him for our deliverance, but humanly speaking I have no hope of him."</p>

  <p>"Nor I," added the clerk. "I am due at Heidelberg&mdash;so a good evening,
  sir."</p>

  <p>"A good evening," answered the merchant courteously. The Calvinist rose; a
  life of continual persecution had given him a furtive look; the resignation
  taught by his stern faith lent some dignity to an appearance of poverty and
  despair. He was an elderly man and all his life had known nothing but the
  disappointments of a losing cause, the bitterness of being one of a despised
  minority.</p>

  <p>"How long, O Lord, how long?" he murmured.</p>

  <p>He drew his cloak precisely about him and left the room; when the door had
  closed his heavy tread could be heard mounting to the little room that was
  his temporary refuge in his wanderings.</p>

  <p>The Netherlander stood motionless by the fire; at that moment the sense of
  the intense unreality of life came oyez him with terrible force.</p>

  <p>He thought of the past and time ceased to exist. The days of his
  prosperity, the days of his exile, moments of anguish, moments of ease
  mingled together in one intricate pattern, all his life seemed without period
  or date, a con fusion of events and emotion.</p>

  <p>A thousand years ago seemed the marriage of the Prince of Orange, the
  young man had said&mdash;the Netherlander had also been in Leipsic for that
  ceremony&mdash;a thousand years ago&mdash;it seemed no less to him...he
  recalled his own past, pleasant days of gaiety, sport and jest&mdash;so
  utterly lost that no magic could recall them, days when the world had been
  normal, when all things had moved, pleasantly in their accustomed grooves,
  days when he had not lacked respect, companions, money, nor
  leisure&mdash;days such as might come into another's life, never again into
  his...half reluctantly his mind travelled the chaos that had followed the
  ending of those pleasant times, the exile, poverty, humiliation,
  failure&mdash;the loss of all, the country from which he was banished, the
  wife who had deserted him, the friends who had died or fallen away from his
  perilous cause.</p>

  <p>No shadow disturbed the composure of his serene face, but the great
  sadness that was in his eyes deepened, and tears filled them.</p>

  <p>With the restless movement of one in pain, he turned from the hearth to
  the window.</p>

  <p>It was raining heavily; the Netherlander looked out steadily at this view
  of rain, wet trees and loose sky.</p>

  <p>A word used by the stranger who had just spoken to him continually
  recurred to his mind&mdash;the Prince of Orange had failed.</p>

  <p>In this moment the man looking out at the rain was acknowledging failure,
  accepting it, failure so complete, until he stood stripped, barren,
  humiliated before his enemies, a landless exile, banned and proscribed.</p>

  <p>Again his mind travelled back to the old days. He contemplated his
  downfall; he remembered that at one time he had counted on happiness as a
  right, taken it for granted. Now that seemed to him extraordinary.</p>

  <p>He returned to the table and took a little notebook from his pocket,
  looked through it and laid it down, then he brought out a handful of money,
  some silver pieces and one piece of gold; this was all he possessed, and
  taking from his wallet a sheet of paper, he began writing a letter to his
  brother...</p>

  <p>"In the long coffer in my room is a suit of grey and a pair of hosen you
  may have mended for me&mdash;I am in sore need of these and shall thank you
  for your kind offices could you find a cheap small horse? I need one for a
  good friend of mine who at present goes a-foot, this is a very necessary
  thing if the means could be found."</p>

  <p>He was penning this letter with a certain haste, as if eager to be rid of
  a disagreeable task, when the door of the little parlour opened. The
  traveller at once and swiftly put away his letter.</p>

  <p>Voices sounded in the passage and a woman entered the room.</p>

  <p>She wore a brown cloth riding suit and carried her wet skirts high,
  showing her muddied boots; the rain had draggled the long black feather in
  her buff hat and the locks of reddish hair that had been blown across her
  wind-flushed face; she was handsome in an imposing, opulent fashion, but her
  expression was humble and sad.</p>

  <p>&mdash;Mynheer Certain had risen from his seat at her entry and was
  turning away, but the instant's glance he had of the woman caused him to
  pause and glance at her again.</p>

  <p>She, entering, came face to face with him and stood arrested in all
  movement, her face flushing with a look of bewilderment and joy.</p>

  <p>The innkeeper behind her began talking of her lame horse and when he might
  be able to procure her another. She composed herself to answer him.</p>

  <p>"If need be I can walk to the Castle," she said, "it is so
  near&mdash;and&mdash;I will rest a little while&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped and began pulling off her gloves.</p>

  <p>The landlord left, and the man and woman looked at each other again.</p>

  <p>"You remember me?" he said gently</p>

  <p>"I was your servant," she answered, "&mdash;but <i>you</i> remember
  <i>me</i>?"</p>

  <p>"My lady's waiting-woman, the heretic maid from Dresden&mdash;Rénée le
  Meuny. But perhaps you have changed that name?"</p>

  <p>"No," she was looking at him breathlessly. "Why do you speak of <i>me</i>?
  What of yourself?"</p>

  <p>All humility and reverence were in her words; her knees trembled and her
  lips quivered.</p>

  <p>"How I have <i>prayed</i> for your Highness," she murmured. The tears
  sprang to her eyes. "All these years&mdash;" He was moved at that; his
  sensitive nature was touched by the thought of her remembering and praying
  when he had forgotten her utterly until he had come face to face with her
  again.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;All these years," repeated Rénée le Meuny. "You were ever very
  loyal," he said kindly.</p>

  <p>"Loyal?" she answered strangely.</p>

  <p>"Loyal," he repeated. "I remember that I noticed that quality in
  you&mdash;from the first."</p>

  <p>He recalled her now very clearly, her impassiveness and reserve, her
  endless patience before the caprices of an intolerable mistress, the
  stedfastness with which she had once or twice ventured to speak to him of her
  persecuted faith.</p>

  <p>"I hope all is well with you," he said, and there was a certain tenderness
  mingled with the usual perfect courtesy of his manner; tenderness for the
  past and the part Rénée le Meuny had played therein.</p>

  <p>She did not appear to hear what he was saying, so utterly absorbed was she
  by the wonder of meeting him, of seeing actually before her the man who had
  so long occupied her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"We think of you so much at the Castle," she said, "so much."</p>

  <p>"You are at the Castle?"</p>

  <p>"With the good Electress, yea. She shelters so many&mdash;your Highness is
  coming to the Castle?"</p>

  <p>"I had not thought to do so," he answered. "I have no news for the Elector
  Palatine. I travel as Mynheer Certain&mdash;to keep in touch with some agents
  of mine. My eventual goal is Dillenburg."</p>

  <p>"But you will come to Heidelberg," she said, clasping her hands nervously.
  "You would not pass them by&mdash;they&mdash;I&mdash;we have waited so long
  for news of you&mdash;so patiently."</p>

  <p>"I have no news," he said again and turned away his tired eyes.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness must come," she pleaded. "Oh, your Highness will come!"</p>

  <p>She strangely tempted him&mdash;to be among friends, to snatch a few hours
  of ease, of comfort, why not?</p>

  <p>It had not been his intention to ask the sympathy even of those whom he
  knew would offer it lovingly, but this resolve of his now faltered; something
  in the personality of the woman swayed him; he had long lacked the devotion
  of a woman in his life; lately he had met few, refined and comely as Rénée le
  Meuny; once such women had been as plentiful round him as the flowers in his
  parterres and as little noticed, now they were a rarity; he even felt
  grateful to this lady who looked at him in an amaze of pleasure and
  reverence.</p>

  <p>"Why should I not come?" he said with a smile. "It grows dark and you will
  need an escort to the Castle."</p>

  <p>"You would ride with me?" she exclaimed. He was almost startled at her
  tone.</p>

  <p>"Why should I not ride with you?" he asked gently. "I was your servant,
  one of the least of your servants," she said.</p>

  <p>"I am a landless man now," he answered. "I have no servants, and but few
  friends&mdash;make these one more, Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>She moved a little away from him.</p>

  <p>"To me," she said simply, "you are always William of Orange."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-2"
     id="ch1-2"></a>II. &mdash; THE RIDE</h2>

  <p class="first">Slowly they rode together through the pine forest; the rain
  fell steadily yet gently, there was a faint warmth in the air like the first
  beginning of the beautiful heat of summer; here and there fresh green tipped
  the winter darkness of the trees.</p>

  <p>They rode with a certain leisure as people who are at no haste to be at
  their journey's end. To the woman it was an episode of pure happiness in a
  life that had always been unhappy, to the man it was a pleasant interlude in
  a life of stress and turmoil unutterable; he rode his shabby hack and she the
  borrowed horse from the inn; their wet cloaks clung about them and the
  moisture dripped from their felt hats; the woman's heart glowed with a joy
  that made the grey afternoon as radiant to her as a midsummer noonday, her
  mind admitted nothing beyond the fact that they were riding alone together.
  It seemed incredible after all these years of patience, of abnegations, of
  dreams.</p>

  <p>"You think often of the Netherlands?" asked the Prince.</p>

  <p>"Often," she said. "I have wondered if I am ever to return to my
  unfortunate country&mdash;believe me I would go," she added, "if my going was
  of the least service, but I have always been one of the useless."</p>

  <p>"We are all useless compared with our tasks," said the Prince gravely. "I
  feel myself a handful of dust before the wind, a straw before the tide."</p>

  <p>"You are the guiding star of a whole nation," said Rénée le Meuny, "the
  hope of a Faith&mdash;the solace of a Cause." He smiled, turning on her his
  sad eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are good to think that of me&mdash;it is their own courage guides and
  supports the Netherlanders, not II am a man who set himself against great
  odds and who has failed."</p>

  <p>"But who is not defeated, Highness."</p>

  <p>"No, not defeated," he assented quietly. "I have yet my brain, my two
  hands, the name&mdash;a name something loved&mdash;nothing else."</p>

  <p>She looked at him; under the broad brim of his hat his dark face showed
  pale; the exact fine features had changed since the day she had seen him
  first; the day when he had mounted the stairs of Leipsic town hall to greet
  his bride, Anne of Saxony&mdash;the smooth olive cheek was hollowed, the
  brilliant eyes shadowed, in the thick close chestnut locks the white hairs
  were sprinkled; he looked infinitely tired, and there was great sadness in
  the resolute lines of his full lips.</p>

  <p>Rénée remembered&mdash;remembered days of pomp and magnificence and this
  man moving through them, courted, beloved, and serene, a Prince, a Grandee of
  Spain, the greatest man in the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>And the years between then and now were not so many, and yet she, his
  wife's waiting-woman, who had courtesied from his path with awe, had met him,
  a forlorn and penniless exile in a wayside inn, and they were riding together
  as equals.</p>

  <p>Equals&mdash;her heart trembled at the word; she knew it was but another
  dream, that he would always remain a sovereign Prince and she a humble
  commoner, yet for the moment it was a dream with the semblance of reality; at
  least all outward sign of difference was done away with, they rode together
  as fellow exiles, as two of the same country and the same faith&mdash;as mere
  man and woman. And his wife was no longer between them; the worthless,
  faithless, wanton woman whom Rénée had laboured so long and patiently to
  save, was repudiated at last, insane in the care of her own kinsfolk.</p>

  <p>"If we could ride for ever," thought Rénée, "if the world would stop about
  us and we could ride on like this through all eternity."</p>

  <p>The rain ceased and the light of sunset showed in a faint blur through the
  straight dark stems of the trees, a pale saffron glow diffused itself through
  the wood, an indistinct gleam of sunshine quivered along the ground.</p>

  <p>"Afterwards," said the Prince, looking at his companion, "when I am again
  lost in my obscure wanderings, I shall remember this ride very
  pleasantly."</p>

  <p>She turned her glance to her gauntleted hands so slackly holding the
  reins.</p>

  <p>"Count Louis is in health?" she asked. "He is so much spoken of at
  Heidelberg."</p>

  <p>A look of tenderness softened the Prince's face at mention of his younger
  brother.</p>

  <p>"Louis is well and gay," he answered. "His bright spirits help us all to
  have confidence in our desperate cause."</p>

  <p>Rénée recalled her first meeting with Count Louis&mdash;the idle young
  gallant&mdash;she remembered too how she had despised him for his air of
  foppery&mdash;how he had shamed her judgment. She had also felt some contempt
  for the handsome gorgeous Prince of Orange and his political marriage, but
  that Rénée had now forgotten utterly.</p>

  <p>"You remember the days in Brussels?" smiled the Prince, "the feasts, the
  tourneys&mdash;poor wild Brederode&mdash;Hoogstraaten&mdash;Egmount,
  Hoorne&mdash;my brother Adolphus&mdash;Bergen, Floris Montmorency all
  dead!&mdash;dead as the ashes of those festal fires, Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>Rénée shuddered.</p>

  <p>"How will Philip answer to God for all these lives, all those other lives,
  obscure, miserable as these were great?"</p>

  <p>He glanced at her still with that wistful smile about his lips.</p>

  <p>"Philip? He has pleased <i>his</i> God and knows no other." Rénée was
  puzzled.</p>

  <p>"But there surely is Judgment for such a man?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows?" said William calmly. "Judgment is not in our hands,
  Mademoiselle, we perform our little task while we can and when our day is
  done&mdash;good night! So much to do, so little time to do it in!"</p>

  <p>"You do not hate Philip?" she asked as the Calvinist had asked.</p>

  <p>"I have hated him. These last years I have got beyond hate&mdash;and
  beyond despair. Mademoiselle, I have been very much in the depths&mdash;I
  have seen grief and sorrow very close. I have been in those places where a
  man leaves his life or his passions. I lived. I think there was nothing left
  of what I used to be but a certain faith in human endeavour, a certain hope
  in the triumph of this world's better things&mdash;even against a
  Philip."</p>

  <p>She was silent, overwhelmed that he should thus speak to her.</p>

  <p>"So I have hope, even for the Netherlands," continued the Prince. "So I
  have faith&mdash;even in the coming of that time when there shall be no one
  creed tryannizing over another creed. Even in that I have faith&mdash;but one
  can do so little&mdash;only all of us doing something may bring nearer the
  day of deliverance. So little!" he repeated softly, "to serve the truth as we
  see it&mdash;God as we know Him&mdash;justice as it is revealed to
  us&mdash;so little!"</p>

  <p>"This from your Highness&mdash;who has done everything!"</p>

  <p>"Lost everything. The two strangers I parted from just now spoke of my
  name and failure&mdash;coupled the words together!"</p>

  <p>But as he spoke he smiled and his eyes were serene.</p>

  <p>Rénée thought of all he had endured&mdash;defeat, humiliation, contempt,
  the endless endeavour, the slow patience, the vast energy, the indomitable
  resource that had again and again been wasted in a fruitless task.</p>

  <p>"You will achieve," she said in a low voice, "such as your Highness always
  achieve."</p>

  <p>"If I could do only a little," he answered quietly. "Lately I have been
  afraid they would kill me before I could do anything at all."</p>

  <p>"Kill you?" she stammered.</p>

  <p>"Philip thinks me of some importance still," he answered simply, with a
  little smile. "I am on the list of those he considers dangerous&mdash;the
  list on which he put Hoorne and Egmont."</p>

  <p>"They&mdash;try to assassinate you?"</p>

  <p>"Persistently. Philip has not forgotten that I escaped the net that caught
  the others."</p>

  <p>Rénée's face quivered, she looked away.</p>

  <p>"God would not let you be killed," she said. "Too many need your
  Highness."</p>

  <p>He did not answer this; he too had his faith, but it was not so simple as
  hers; he did not think that Heaven had given him any special mission or would
  afford him any special protection; to him Eternal Truth and Eternal Justice
  were throned high above the mud and blood of the present strife, nor did he
  believe that his endeavours would be even noticed by that Vastness men called
  God; so far he was a fatalist, and to this point the Calvinist religion, that
  it had become most expedient for him to embrace, was congenial to him; but
  had it not been a matter of political wisdom he would not have joined any
  particular sect; narrowness was hateful to him and the very essence of the
  cause for which he had given everything was liberty of conscience.</p>

  <p>They came out from the pine forest on to the high road; dusk was closing
  in and before them gleamed the lights in the windows of Heidelberg
  Castle.</p>

  <p>As the Prince saw the Castle before him, his expression subtly changed;
  the moment of softness passed; like a shadow the reserved look of the man of
  great affairs, of one engaged in perilous causes and burdened with heavy
  secrets, came over his face.</p>

  <p>"The Elector is at home?" he asked, and Rénée saw that he had already put
  her from his thoughts and was considering how this chance visit he had been
  persuaded into might be turned into political account.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Monseigneur," she answered, instantly subduing herself to his
  service, "he will be most honoured at your Highness's coming."</p>

  <p>"A pity," observed William, "that he is not so powerful as he is well
  meaning."</p>

  <p>"He is very generous," said Rénée, loyal to the man whose little Court had
  sheltered her and so many of her co-religionists. "He does not refuse his
  protection to the most destitute and insignificant. The Electress, too, is
  wide in charity."</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle de Montpensier is with her?" asked the Prince.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Highness. I am her particular attendant. At some peril to themselves
  their Highnesses shelter this lady, who fled from France to
  them&mdash;Monseigneur knows the story?"</p>

  <p>"Of Mademoiselle de Montpensier, the abbess of Jouane?" smiled William,
  then added with a sudden gravity, "I do not know why I smile, her action
  showed great courage in the lady."</p>

  <p>"Such courage, Monseigneur, for one enclosed in a convent since she was a
  child of eleven!" said Rénée eagerly, "but she is brave, the Princess, and
  strong."</p>

  <p>"Such women are needed in these times," answered William. "Mademoiselle
  should marry and comfort some weary man."</p>

  <p>Rénée knew that there had been long and persistent talk of a union between
  William's brother, Louis of Nassau, and Charlotte de Montpensier and she
  thought that it was to this that he alluded.</p>

  <p>"The Electress is eager for such a marriage," she said, "but the Princess
  is dowerless; her father will give her nothing, and her sister, Madame de
  Bouillon, cannot."</p>

  <p>"Many a man will wed without a dower now as many a woman without an
  establishment&mdash;your little princess will find her mate&mdash;she looks a
  woman for a home."</p>

  <p>Rénée was startled.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness has seen her?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Once. When I first came to France." He dismissed the subject with a
  certain abruptness. "We are almost at the Castle, Mademoiselle. I trust your
  good offices," he added with a very winning courtesy, "to assure my
  welcome."</p>

  <p>"Your Highness humbles me," breathed Rénée. This meeting with the Prince
  had changed everything for her, so suddenly, so utterly, that she was giddy
  with it.</p>

  <p>In the courtyard he helped her to dismount; and held her gloved hand for a
  moment after she was standing beside him.</p>

  <p>"I thank you for a pleasurable hour, Mademoiselle," he said, and his voice
  had a quality of gratitude as if he had not been lately used to such sympathy
  as she had offered him.</p>

  <p>She turned towards the Castle entrance, and the Prince, taking off his
  shabby hat and shaking the water from the brim, followed her.</p>

  <p>An officer standing in the hall stared curiously at the slim shabby man
  behind Rénée.</p>

  <p>"The Elector!" she asked.</p>

  <p>"His Highness"&mdash;he began.</p>

  <p>As he spoke Frederic himself came down the wide stairs; beside his stern
  martial figure was the slender one of the young Count Christopher.</p>

  <p>Rénée turned to them.</p>

  <p>"Messieurs, I bring you a very notable guest."</p>

  <p>"In very notable attire," added William, and he laughed. The Elector came
  swiftly down the stairs, his face coloured with pleasure. He put his hands on
  the Prince's shoulders and kissed him on either cheek.</p>

  <p>Rénée sped past them, up the stairs and to the apartments of Mademoiselle
  de Montpensier.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle," said Rénée breathlessly, "he is here!"</p>

  <p>"Who is here, my dear?" asked the Princess. "Your knight at last? I
  thought that you must have one, Rénée."</p>

  <p>Rénée turned away; her lips trembled, her throat was dry and she could not
  speak.</p>

  <p>Charlotte de Bourbon did, not lift her eyes from her work.</p>

  <p>This Princess, daughter of the proud Duc de Montpensier, who had been
  forced by her parents into a cloister at the age of eleven, who had taken her
  vows under protest, and abandoned her position as abbess in one of the most
  princely and wealthy establishments in France, to fly into the Palatinate and
  embrace the Reformed Faith, was a slight fair girl of no great appearance of
  energy or force of character.</p>

  <p>Her features were small, her hair soft and fine, the chin was a little
  heavy, the eyes dark blue, her manner was one of, above all, serenity. She
  wore a puce-coloured gown and a falling ruff of delicate muslin covered with
  needlework.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" she asked again without looking up. "The Prince of Orange,
  Mademoiselle," answered Rénée quickly.</p>

  <p>Now Charlotte dropped her work.</p>

  <p>"The Prince of Orange!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mademoiselle, he is now in the castle."</p>

  <p>"Secretly&mdash;in disguise?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I left him with the Elector."</p>

  <p>Charlotte looked thoughtful; Rénée, who believed the common rumour that
  the Princess was interested in and would eventually marry Louis of Nassau,
  remarked, timidly.</p>

  <p>"His Highness spoke of his brother&mdash;Count Louis, who is safe and
  well."</p>

  <p>Charlotte glanced at her calmly; the serenity that had enabled
  Mademoiselle de Montpensier to support with dignity so many years of
  conventual life was always apparent in her demeanour, and Rénée, at least,
  had never seen any of the spirit that had urged her to break her enforced
  vows and escape her convent; there still seemed much of the abbess in
  Charlotte, the dignity of one trained to command, the poise of one who is
  remote from the world and impervious to worldly troubles.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that I am so eager for news of Count Louis?" she asked
  pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Rénée frankly; she was as intimate with the Princess as any
  woman, but Charlotte had a quality of elusive remoteness difficult to the
  warm and impulsive nature of the Fleming.</p>

  <p>"You listen to gossip," smiled the Princess gently, "but I shall be glad
  to meet the Prince. He has been wonderful. I believe he will do something
  yet, even against Alva."</p>

  <p>"He has given all he has," answered Rénée. "Everything&mdash;you cannot
  imagine how great and splendid he was, how magnificent&mdash;and
  now&mdash;like a beggar&mdash;lonely."</p>

  <p>"You speak with great enthusiasm," said Charlotte, looking up. "You knew
  him very well?"</p>

  <p>It was in Rénée's heart and almost on her lips to disclose her long-kept
  secret&mdash;"I love him," but something in the utter gentle calm of the
  Princess checked her; she kept a stern rein over her agitation and answered
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"When I was with his wife I saw much of His Highness."</p>

  <p>"Where is his wife?" asked Charlotte; the disastrous ending of the
  Prince's marriage was a thing hushed and mysterious; these two had never
  spoken of it before.</p>

  <p>"I believe she may be at Dillenburg in the custody of Count John," said
  Rénée. "Count Louis told me that the Prince had repudiated her and that the
  Elector of Saxony was to take her back. She is mad."</p>

  <p>"Poor wretch!" murmured Charlotte.</p>

  <p>Rénée flushed.</p>

  <p>"There is no need to pity her, Mademoiselle, she made the Prince's life a
  humiliation and a misery. I knew her as few others could and there was no
  good in her. And when the trouble came she deserted him&mdash;and&mdash;and
  stooped to another man."</p>

  <p>"I know," said the Princess, "therefore I say, 'poor wretch!' Do you not
  pity such as these, Rénée?</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;at least for her I had no pity."</p>

  <p>Charlotte was silent.</p>

  <p>"And now the Prince is free," added Rénée. "Free? He considers himself
  free?"</p>

  <p>"He is now a Protestant, and Protestant Divines have freed him from a
  union the woman trampled on."</p>

  <p>Charlotte said no more; she folded away her silks and ribbons into a
  cedar-wood box.</p>

  <p>The rain had begun again, heavy drops splashed down the wide chimney on to
  the log fire, a high wind shook the window behind the heavy curtain.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-3"
     id="ch1-3"></a>III. &mdash; THE INTERRUPTION OF THE PRINCESS
     CHARLOTTE</h2>

  <p class="first">The Prince of Orange sat in the Elector's private cabinet
  and listened to his host speaking on the confusions and disorders that rent
  the nations. It was second nature in him to listen to all, to defer, to
  soothe, to conduct intricate intrigue secretly and use people while they
  thought they used him; he was still the accomplished diplomat he had been in
  the days of his power when the redoubtable Cardinal Granvelle had described
  him as "the most dangerous man in the Netherlands," and he still masked his
  abilities with that show of perfect good humour and tolerance that had always
  gained him so many adherents.</p>

  <p>In his heart he was sick of all men; he himself saw so clearly, so
  straightly both the great issues that he had at heart and the means to
  achievement of these same issues, that it was weariness to him to have to
  wait always on the whims and crooked policies of others.</p>

  <p>On every side these others baulked him; the Queen of England was a
  Protestant, but she would not help him, in despite of her half-promises,
  because it was not her policy to go to war with Spain, the Protestant Princes
  of Germany would not risk their all in an encounter with Alva, the French
  played fast and loose with Protestant and Romanist, Condé's little band with
  whom William and his brothers had thrown in their fortunes had been scattered
  like chaff; the Prince had no allies beyond his brothers, John, Louis and
  Henry, and no resources beyond his own apacity.</p>

  <p>The Elector admired him and sympathized with both his cause and his
  situation, yet William would not even have troubled to visit Heidelberg had
  he not met Rénée le Meuny, so hopeless did he know it to be to ask Frederic
  for material.</p>

  <p>So he listened to the good Elector's denunciation of Rome and Philip, Alva
  and the Inquisition, and in his heart was the great sadness and weariness of
  the man who has undertaken an almost impossible task and knows that he must
  shoulder it alone.</p>

  <p>Frederic sat by the fireplace, his fine, rather heavy face was flushed and
  animated, his eyes shone under his grey hair and his mouth was firmly set
  between the grey moustaches and beard.</p>

  <p>William, silent, shabby yet elegant, with his air of courteous attention,
  sat at the round table that occupied the centre of the room; his eyes were
  fixed intently on the Elector, yet when Frederic, ceasing his powerful yet
  vague reproaches against the supporters of the Christian faith, asked a
  sudden question it was with an effort that William recalled himself from his
  own straying thoughts to answer.</p>

  <p>"Why do you rely on the French?" the Elector had demanded.</p>

  <p>The Prince utterly unable and unwishful to explain his intricate policies
  to even such a loyal friend as Frederic, answered smoothly. "I doubt if I
  could tell why I try for French support," he said, "save that a desperate man
  clutches at straws. I do not, however, rely on them."</p>

  <p>"'Twere wiser not to do so," remarked the Elector shrewdly. "Think you
  Catherine or her sons could play fair?"</p>

  <p>"There is the Guise," replied William. "It is a country split with
  factions&mdash;one of their ambitious young Princes might be tempted."</p>

  <p>"By what?"</p>

  <p>"The kingdom of the Netherlands," said the Prince calmly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you would offer that?"</p>

  <p>"My ideal would be a Republic," answered the Prince, "but I think that
  unattainable in these times. Therefore I would create a kingdom and offer it
  to the Prince who would deliver us from Philip and the Inquisition."</p>

  <p>"A bold plan," said the Elector with admiration and a little amazement.
  "Your Highness really thinks it possible to completely deliver the
  Netherlands?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then it is your Highness should have the throne of this new kingdom."</p>

  <p>William appeared neither startled nor flattered; the idea was not new to
  him.</p>

  <p>"A more powerful Protector than myself is needed, Highness. I am a
  landless man. I can neither command one chest of money nor one regiment of
  foot. The Netherlands require one who can liberate before he can rule."</p>

  <p>"If there is a man in Europe can do that," declared the Elector, "it is
  yourself."</p>

  <p>William slightly flushed.</p>

  <p>"I have tried and failed. More than once. I have gathered armies to see
  them scattered, I have spent all I had with no results. I have lost all I
  ever had in this cause, all but life," he added, "for what am I now but a
  derision to Philip and Alva and an object of pity to the world? I undertook
  what I could not do. I shall try again, but it cannot be alone."</p>

  <p>"Better alone than with treacherous help," said the Elector.</p>

  <p>William did not answer; the vast schemes that he was meditating required
  the aid of nations, not only individuals; to attempt alone the task to which
  he had set his hand was to play a fool's part; he thought the Elector did not
  understand this but considered him a forlorn adventurer, and therefore he did
  not answer.</p>

  <p>"Whom would you trust?" pursued Frederic. "France, Austria, England?"</p>

  <p>"I work," replied the Prince, "with all three, with all&mdash;with any. I
  cannot too carefully choose my means for these ends I have in view&mdash;the
  liberation of the Netherlands and toleration for the Reformed Religion."</p>

  <p>The Elector sighed; there was still that look of faint amazement in his
  face. It seemed quite hopeless to defy Philip, for he was sincere in his
  profession of the Reformed Faith and ardent in his championship of his
  co-religionists in the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>For an instant the younger man's faith almost convinced him; he looked
  searchingly at William's steadfast face.</p>

  <p>Supposing these golden dreams did come true, supposing the defeated Prince
  did snatch a nation from Philip's wrath and Alva's sword?</p>

  <p>"You have great confidence in success, Highness?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," replied William slowly. "I cannot tell how long I
  have."</p>

  <p>"You think that Philip pursues you?" asked Frederic gloomily.</p>

  <p>"I know it. I was on the same list as Hoorne and Floris, Egmont and
  Bergen. The King will not rest till I have joined them, Highness."</p>

  <p>"Assassination! the Spanish hound!" cried the Elector. "Death some way,"
  said William. "They have tried several times. Once they will try and not
  fail."</p>

  <p>"You think that?"</p>

  <p>"Is it likely, Highness, that such a man as Philip would fail in such an
  aim?"</p>

  <p>"This is a horrible thing for you to live with," muttered the Elector.</p>

  <p>"I am used to it. I know that some day Philip's steel or bullet or poison
  will end me as it ended them. Unless the chance of battle saves me. The
  question is, how much I can accomplish first."</p>

  <p>Frederic had no good answer ready; it seemed to him indeed unlikely that
  Philip who had set William under a ban, and resolved on his death by any
  means and at any cost, would allow to escape the last and most illustrious of
  the Netherlanders who had defied his authority.</p>

  <p>The Prince's thoughts had travelled far from the subject; there was one
  question only he wished to put to the Elector. "How many men would you raise
  for me in the Palatinate?" talk of other matters was but waste of time, and
  he would consider his evening wasted if he could not obtain some promise of
  support from Frederic.</p>

  <p>He rose and crossed to the hearth with the intention of asking the Elector
  for a levy of men; though he would very willingly have been silent on this
  matter to the Elector; but his policy had been too long that of ceaseless
  endeavour in every direction for him to leave unused this chance that had
  come his way.</p>

  <p>He was about to speak when the door opened and two women entered the
  apartment.</p>

  <p>The foremost was the Electress, she who had been the wife of the wild
  Beggar leader, Count Brederode, and her companion was Mademoiselle de
  Montpensier.</p>

  <p>"Highness," said the Electress, addressing the Prince of Orange, "since
  you would not come to wait on us we are here to wait on you," she held out
  her hand frankly and smiled. "We used to know each other in Brussels,
  Monseigneur, will you ignore old friends?"</p>

  <p>"I was in no trim to speak to ladies," answered William. "I go darkly,
  shadowed with misfortune, and would not offend gentle eyes nor sadden
  hearts."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he looked at her wistfully, for in truth she reminded him of
  those old Brussels days&mdash;the days of youth and pleasure.</p>

  <p>"I knew they would bring you their homage, Prince," smiled the Elector.
  "Your name is ever on their tongues&mdash;this," he drew forward his young
  guest, "this is Mademoiselle Charlotte de Bourbon, the Duc de Montpensier's
  daughter, lately of that faith, Highness, for which you fight."</p>

  <p>The Prince glanced at her quickly; the Elector had drawn her into the
  golden circle of the lamplight.</p>

  <p>In that moment Charlotte looked beautiful, her face was flushed and soft
  above the fine gauze ruff, the fair hair loosened about the low placid brow
  and the eyes shining with an eager light.</p>

  <p>"We met before, twice," said William.</p>

  <p>"Twice?"</p>

  <p>"Once at the Louvre&mdash;you were a very little maid, you stood in an
  alcove and watched the Queen of Scotland dance. It was a little while before
  King Henry died."</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"You saw me? A funny little child! Soon after that they made me a
  nun."</p>

  <p>"And now you have taken your freedom. With great courage."</p>

  <p>The Princess impulsively caught the Elector's hand, while her eyes turned
  affectionately towards his wife.</p>

  <p>"These saved me. I am homeless but for them. My father disowns me. I am
  exile as yourself, Highness; closed to me is France&mdash;but I am very happy
  here," she added instantly; despite her dignity there was a certain
  childishness about her as she spoke infinitely touching.</p>

  <p>"She is not happy," said the Electress gently. "Who could be in such times
  as these? Who could be, cast from their home and their country? But we will
  find an establishment for her."</p>

  <p>Frederic smiled kindly at the little refugee.</p>

  <p>"She deserves good fortune, this fair heretic," he said.</p>

  <p>Charlotte looked at the Prince, who was gazing at her very intently; he
  was recalling that morning, early in the year, soon after he had entered
  France, and how she had ridden by, an abbess with her train of nuns...and how
  she, even then, had wished him "God speed" on his perilous adventure.</p>

  <p>Seeing his eyes on her she flushed, but her gaze was steady.</p>

  <p>"What great talk have we interrupted with our coming?" she asked
  seriously.</p>

  <p>The Elector shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The Prince has said nothing. You must use your persuasions to make him
  talk, Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>"What of?" smiled William. "I have long since become rusty in subjects
  interesting to a lady's ears."</p>

  <p>Charlotte looked at him gravely; he was impressed now, as he had been when
  he had seen her last, by a certain nobility in her face.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness must not dismiss us as trifles now," she said. "Women can
  be of use, even in these times. We have changed as the men have
  changed&mdash;is it not so, Madame?" She turned to the Electress.</p>

  <p>"At least we understand," was the gentle answer.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness would never realize how we have followed your exploits,
  waited for news, hoped, prayed&mdash;and blessed you, Prince, you and Count
  Louis and Count John and all who fight."</p>

  <p>William, looking at these two earnest and intelligent women, thought of
  the wife who still bore his name, the woman who had insulted him and his
  cause, who had deserted him and his faith and stooped to a low intrigue with
  one scarce a gentleman.</p>

  <p>The pain of this thought caused him to turn away abruptly; he walked to
  the wide hearth, then turned again, facing the three.</p>

  <p>None of them could have guessed his secret disease, but all saw the sudden
  cloud on his face and a little silence fell.</p>

  <p>It was the Princess Charlotte who broke it; she did what was to William an
  amazing thing. She turned quietly to Frederic.</p>

  <p>"How many men can you raise for his Highness?" she said.</p>

  <p>William started to hear the question that had been so insistently in his
  own mind, started to hear her ask so quietly the question he, a Prince, had
  not cared to ask.</p>

  <p>The Elector looked at her straightly, almost with a challenge.</p>

  <p>"Who told you, Mademoiselle," he asked, "that I proposed to raise a levy
  for the Prince of Orange?" She answered simply:</p>

  <p>"I was sure you would help to your utmost, Highness." She smiled as she
  added, "The Duke Christopher is eager to go."</p>

  <p>"Ah, he has no secrets from you, eh?" smiled the Elector.</p>

  <p>"I do not know his secrets, Highness, only this, that he is eager to
  volunteer under the Prince of Orange."</p>

  <p>"Well, better that than to spend his life in sloth," he answered.</p>

  <p>"And how many men can the Palatinate raise?" asked Charlotte.</p>

  <p>"She has a courage," remarked the Electress with a smile.</p>

  <p>"What courage?" asked Charlotte; she too was smiling. "Is it not true that
  the Elector is a Protestant Prince&mdash;and is it not true," she turned
  shyly to William, "that His Highness requires men for his campaign against
  Alva in the Netherlands?"</p>

  <p>William had been watching this little scene with an intent curiosity.</p>

  <p>"It is very true," he answered at once. "How can I thank my gracious
  advocate?"</p>

  <p>"Thank the Elector," said Charlotte, "when he has given you the
  levy&mdash;and now a good night, for I have had my say. Before your going I
  shall see your Highness."</p>

  <p>She took the arm of the Electress and the two were gone as quickly and
  unceremoniously as they had entered. Frederic turned to William.</p>

  <p>"I will help you to the best of my power," he said, and held out his
  hand.</p>

  <p>Charlotte left the Electress and ran up to her own chamber, where Rénée le
  Meuny sat by the fire.</p>

  <p>"I have seen him," said Charlotte.</p>

  <p>"The Prince?" Rénée looked up.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I thought that he was here secretly and would see no one but the
  Elector," said Rénée slowly.</p>

  <p>"What did you think of him?" she asked with reluctance.</p>

  <p>Charlotte answered gravely.</p>

  <p>"He is such as I should wish to marry, to serve and be with always."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-4"
     id="ch1-4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE EXILES</h2>

  <p class="first">They met again, the Prince and Charlotte de Bourbon; he, who
  was used to only a few hours' sleep, was up almost with the early spring
  dawn; the day was sunny and misty after yesterday's rain; she and Rénée were
  walking in the garden when the Prince found them.</p>

  <p>At sight of him the waiting-woman withdrew herself, as she had withdrawn
  herself all her life, but her step was heavy and her shoulders drooped as she
  went.</p>

  <p>The Princess greeted him with her simple serenity, trained to be composed
  and distant in graciousness.</p>

  <p>"I wished to see you again, Mademoiselle," said William.</p>

  <p>They fell into step side by side, walking slowly between the flower beds
  where the snowdrops showed beneath the bushes.</p>

  <p>"You leave soon?" asked Charlotte.</p>

  <p>"In a few hours."</p>

  <p>"Your Highness is not long in any one place," she smiled. "No&mdash;an
  exile's life!"</p>

  <p>"We are both exiles," said Charlotte, "and for the same cause."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he asked, "how you came to this great resolution, Mademoiselle,
  to leave all?"</p>

  <p>It did indeed seem strange to him that she, a mere girl, should have dared
  to break her bonds, her vows, and return to the world from which she had been
  forever excluded and embrace the faith that was one with damnation to her
  people and her kin.</p>

  <p>He was puzzled also because he did not see in her any great energy or
  force of character, she seemed rather simple and conformed.</p>

  <p>Yet she had done this thing, uninfluenced and unaided.</p>

  <p>"I never wished to be a nun," she answered. "When I took my vows I made a
  protest before the Novices. I was then eleven years old. I loathed the
  life&mdash;from the first."</p>

  <p>"And you heard of what was taking place in the world?"</p>

  <p>"A little. Something of this great new freedom that was
  coming&mdash;something of the great conflict in France&mdash;of what the
  Queen of Navarre and the Elector were doing, and my sister's lord, Monsieur
  de Bouillon. I thought it was the moment to free myself."</p>

  <p>"And you left everything?"</p>

  <p>She looked up at him as if she did not understand his meaning.</p>

  <p>"I mean you lost your inheritance, your country and your home? Is this not
  so, Mademoiselle?" insisted William.</p>

  <p>"Has not your Highness lost as much, and more?" she replied.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I!" he smiled.</p>

  <p>She continued looking at him, knitting her brows in the earnestness of her
  speech.</p>

  <p>"And your life must have been pleasant, was it not?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think it was, Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>"While mine was hateful to me&mdash;so mine was a very little sacrifice
  beside yours," said the Princess.</p>

  <p>"And you," smiled William, "are a very little person beside me&mdash;and
  half my years."</p>

  <p>"But Monsieur, you think me very foolish?"</p>

  <p>"I wonder at you. I know what it was to break from all custom, old
  tradition&mdash;to renounce all that one had hitherto held sacred."</p>

  <p>"But I," said Charlotte, "had never felt these things sacred."</p>

  <p>"No?"</p>

  <p>"No," repeated the Princess. "I thought we all have the right to our own
  lives always&mdash;and freedom&mdash;I never believed in priests and I always
  thought one faith as good as another and the Reformed Faith a deal more
  convenient. And I never could believe the plaster statues were the Mothers of
  God, or the little wax Christmas babies Our Lord."</p>

  <p>In these words, spoken with great earnestness, he saw now her strength,
  the calm force of her steadfast character, her common-sense view, undazzled
  by tradition; the simplicity of her character pleased his mind, itself so
  tortured by a thousand intricacies of thought, and the boldness of her
  outlook a little amazed him, accustomed as he was to numberless sophistries
  and hesitations, both in his own innermost beliefs and those of the men whom
  he dealt with.</p>

  <p>"And you have never repented your step, Mademoiselle?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. I am happy here."</p>

  <p>Yet he saw that she was no enthusiast for the cause to which she had given
  such singular evidence of devotion.</p>

  <p>"The religion was the excuse to leave the nun's life?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Charlotte slowly, "had I not been forced to be a nun I might
  have been content with the old faith. My whole sympathy, though, is with the
  Protestants and I shall ever be a true professor of their faith."</p>

  <p>He believed her; there was great loyalty, he saw, in her character, she
  would be very sincere in all her dealings.</p>

  <p>They came to a little stone seat beneath an ash tree just covered with the
  first black buds and seated themselves. William found it pleasant to look at
  her, and as he looked a sense of her sweetness touched him very deeply; he
  imagined her as the centre of a home, as the mother of children, and the
  thought came to him&mdash;"If I had had such a woman these last years, how
  different my life would have been."</p>

  <p>He spoke, prompted by these thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Now you are in the world, Mademoiselle, you will do as the world
  does?"</p>

  <p>She did not affect to misunderstand him.</p>

  <p>"I wish to marry, Monsieur, when the time comes that one I can admire
  wishes for me, and to help in making life easy for one of your fighting men.
  But I am dowerless," she added with a smile.</p>

  <p>"He who weds you will not look for a dowry," said William. "You have heard
  of my brother, Count Louis, and his admiration of you?"</p>

  <p>"I have seen him," she answered. "He is not my suitor, Highness."</p>

  <p>"Not openly as yet, he is afraid, because he has so little to offer."</p>

  <p>She shook her head sadly.</p>

  <p>"Too much for me to accept."</p>

  <p>"Nay, in worldly gear nothing," said William, "but in himself he is a
  knight for any maiden's dreams, Mademoiselle."</p>

  <p>"I do believe it," she answered simply.</p>

  <p>She looked round at him; he was gazing at her and as their glances met she
  faintly coloured, but her eyes continued steadfast.</p>

  <p>They were a strange contrast, she in her youth' and candour, in her
  spotless gown and linen, he in his worn maturity, his shabby clothes, his
  dark face sad and thoughtful, his reserved manner, his courtesy; yet they had
  something in common, for each had flung aside the shackles life had hung on
  them and now stood free.</p>

  <p>And each nursed a dream; and though his was to free a nation, establish a
  religion and enthrone freedom securely in Europe, and hers was but to have
  her own house and her man to tend and her baby in her arms, still each was
  equally sincere, equally passionate, and this gave them in common the
  steadfastness imparted by a burning desire and a deep resolve.</p>

  <p>For even as William meant to accomplish his tremendous aims, so Charlotte
  meant to accomplish her hidden hopes, but while he was active she was
  passive, while he strove she waited.</p>

  <p>"If it should be Count Louis," he said, "I should be glad."</p>

  <p>"I thank you for that," she answered, "but you speak of what is not in the
  hearts of either of us, Monseigneur."</p>

  <p>While he was silent she spoke again, as if she had completely dismissed
  Count Louis from her thoughts. "Your Highness leaves here to-day?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>His face became graver; he had allowed himself this rare interval of
  distraction, with a feeling of relief, and now he thought with distaste upon
  the resumption of his task: "If I had my own home," he thought strangely,
  "this work of mine would seem different to me."</p>

  <p>The thoughts of the Princess were working on different lines.</p>

  <p>She leant forward a little, greatly interested.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness has hopes from my country?"</p>

  <p>"France could do everything."</p>

  <p>"Alas, that my people are Catholic and on the side of your Highness's
  enemies."</p>

  <p>"At least you are not," he said.</p>

  <p>He put out his hand and took hers.</p>

  <p>"You are my friend, are you not? Mademoiselle, good wishes such as yours
  do help as well as armies."</p>

  <p>"But I would rather give you the armies," she smiled, colouring a little
  and letting her hand lie in his while she looked at him with her truthful
  eyes.</p>

  <p>He kissed the fingers he held, then rose.</p>

  <p>"I hope you will have good news of me," he said, "but you must expect bad,
  Mademoiselle. Meanwhile my pleasant hours pass, and I must leave
  Heidelberg."</p>

  <p>She rose also and they looked at each other wistfully, as it they had more
  to say than words could at that moment express.</p>

  <p>Then they parted.</p>

  <p>He returned to the Castle to take his leave and Charlotte remained in the
  garden.</p>

  <p>The bright sunshine of the early day had now changed into a fitful light
  obscured by clouds, the air became chilly and the Princess drew her wrap
  closer.</p>

  <p>Presently she began gathering the snowdrops and Rénée, who had not
  returned to the palace, now perceived she was alone and joined her.</p>

  <p>"The Prince has gone?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He has left to take his leave of the Elector," replied Charlotte.</p>

  <p>She showed Rénée her flowers, but the other woman looked at the Princess
  and disliked her serene face.</p>

  <p>"What a life is this!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Charlotte gave her a glance of surprise.</p>

  <p>"You are tired of Heidelberg?"</p>

  <p>"Tired of life."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Your Highness would not understand."</p>

  <p>"I do not know," replied Charlotte gravely. "I understand what it is to be
  dull and unhappy; you forget how many years I was a nun."</p>

  <p>Rénée laughed bitterly.</p>

  <p>"For longer years I have been a waiting-woman, exiled, dependent on
  charity."</p>

  <p>"It is a weary life&mdash;it must be," said the Princess gently. Rénée was
  surprised, but not softened by her sympathy. "I think I will end it," she
  said with a sigh.</p>

  <p>"How can you?"</p>

  <p>"Some way&mdash;any way&mdash;I could return to the Netherlands&mdash;even
  on foot, and die as others are dying, every day."</p>

  <p>"You serve better by waiting&mdash;the tide will turn&mdash;perhaps
  soon."</p>

  <p>"I am tired of waiting," said Rénée passionately.</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;I know how tired I was, of the eventless life, the even
  days."</p>

  <p>"But your Highness," said Rénée, "had the fortune to gain release."</p>

  <p>"I had to make my own fortune."</p>

  <p>"But you were a Princess, with powerful friends. I have no one. I am so
  obscure no one cares if I live or die; why should they, since neither my
  living nor dying can make any difference to any one."</p>

  <p>She turned away abruptly, but not before the Princess had seen the tears
  in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Charlotte put her hand on the elder woman's sleeve, and spoke, without
  attempting to look into her averted face.</p>

  <p>"I do not know your special grief," she said gently, "but if it is mere
  loneliness&mdash;I know indeed what you suffer&mdash;believe me."</p>

  <p>She paused a moment, then added sadly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose that I am happy? Am I not also dependent on charity? Are
  these kind people my people? or even of my nation? I also am hopeless,
  penniless, cast out."</p>

  <p>Rénée was silent.</p>

  <p>"If ever," continued the Princess simply, "I should have the happiness to
  have a home, you shall share it."</p>

  <p>Rénée turned and looked at her wildly.</p>

  <p>"Truly your Highness does not understand," she said in a low voice. "Your
  Highness must forgive me&mdash;I am not well to-day. These winds give me
  pains in my head&mdash;I speak more than I mean and of things I do not
  understand how to express."</p>

  <p>She moved away; Charlotte, looking after, shook her head.</p>

  <p>More than once this barrier had come between them, friendly as they had
  been during their short acquaintance. Charlotte did not know, though Rénée
  did, that it was the difference in their natures that came between them,
  Charlotte was incapable of feeling passion or even of understanding it, and
  Rénée was capable of assuming, but not of feeling, the calm serenity that
  maintained the Princess through all her misfortunes.</p>

  <p>Charlotte returned to the Castle and went to join the Electress in the
  still-room.</p>

  <p>She did not even know exactly the hour when the Prince left the Castle,
  but Rénée was at an upper window watching for his departure.</p>

  <p>She saw him ride away, wrapped in the shabby cloak, and her gaze followed
  him until the walls of Heidelberg hid him from her view.</p>

  <p>And her heart ached after him with a great and intolerable yearning.</p>

  <p>If she could have ridden behind him&mdash;as his foot-boy&mdash;as his
  slave, if she could be with him, to soften ever so little his troubles and
  discomforts&mdash;</p>

  <p>But she was&mdash;as ever, useless.</p>

  <p>And now he had gone and she must live on rumours again, such scraps of
  news as she could gather from people who never considered that she had any
  special interest in, or right to know of, the doings of William of
  Orange.</p>

  <p>Long she remained looking from the window, gazing at the dull grey clouds
  that now filled the sky.</p>

  <p>She recalled other times when she had watched him ride forth from his
  house in Brussels&mdash;his attire, his gay face, the gentlemen who had
  crowded round him, men who had all fallen victims to the wrath and the guile
  of Philip.</p>

  <p>Egmont and Hoorne, who had died by public execution in the market-place,
  Berghen and Floris Montmorency, inveigled to Spain and strangled or poisoned
  in Spanish jails, Hoogstraaten and Adolphus of Nassau dead in battle, poor
  brave Brederode dead of a broken heart, who now was left of all those gallant
  nobles who had defied the tyrant king and the bigot priest? None save these
  two ruined men, William and Louis of Nassau.</p>

  <p>"And how long have they?" thought Rénée, "for they also are under the ban
  of Spain."</p>

  <p>She trembled for the lonely rider she had just seen depart and the tears
  washed the tired eyes that had so often wept for the Netherlands and William
  of Orange.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-5"
     id="ch1-5"></a>V. &mdash; BROTHERS IN ARMS</h2>

  <p class="first">William, acting on a change of humour prompted AM, his visit
  to Heidelberg, decided not to go to Dillenburg.</p>

  <p>The sight of those dear to him, his motherless children, the wreck of his
  once princely establishment, always disturbed him&mdash;now he felt he would
  not face them&mdash;and with empty news as always&mdash;to talk of further
  need of money, to demand new sacrifices from those who had already sacrificed
  almost everything&mdash;to be reminded, most painfully, of his mad wife and
  his son a prisoner in the hands of Philip.</p>

  <p>This time he would avoid these things.</p>

  <p>He turned aside instead to a little village on the edge of the Nassau
  lands and went to the house of a certain miller who was one of his agents;
  with great labour William had constructed an elaborate system of spies and
  agents in Germany, France and even the Netherlands and Spain; he had been
  trained by Charles V and was no novice in ways of guile, he even had his
  emissary in the very cabinet of Philip.</p>

  <p>It was to pay for these things that he wore a threadbare suit and rode a
  worn hack.</p>

  <p>One of his posts or messengers was waiting at the mill for news, on
  meeting the Prince in person, he handed him a packet in cipher that had come
  slowly from Spain, having been slipped secretly from one faithful hand to
  another.</p>

  <p>William finished the letter to his brother that had been interrupted by
  the entrance of Rénée le Meuny and added a postscript telling of his
  whereabouts and asking Count John to come there and see him&mdash;"as for the
  moment I have no courage for Dillenburg."</p>

  <p>He sent this on by the messenger who had brought him the news from Spain
  and took up his lodging in the mill-house.</p>

  <p>The place was curiously peaceful with that sense of utter detachment from
  the world found in some rustic spots that are unvisited by change or
  trouble.</p>

  <p>Behind, the hill rose to a little forest of chestnut and briar hedges
  where the first wild roses showed; a little vineyard and a little vegetable
  garden were attached to the house, both, at present, bare, with the fresh
  earth newly turned.</p>

  <p>The mill-wheel, dark and dripping with weeds and slime, stood the other
  side of the house where the stream rushed past the rock on which the building
  stood.</p>

  <p>Here the Prince must pass the empty hours, looking up at the high line of
  the bare chestnut trees against the cold blue sky, or down at the racing
  water.</p>

  <p>Here, seated on a fallen log, he read the letter from Spain.</p>

  <p>It told him little or nothing that he had not known or guessed before.</p>

  <p>Spain was full of unrest, the King was desperately in want of money, the
  people were bent beneath the load of taxation, the Court favourites absorbed
  all, Philip was driven by the monks&mdash;"like a blinded mule."</p>

  <p>Yet, as William knew, the King had his secret obstinate principles and
  ideas from which not even monks could have moved him.</p>

  <p>If the Pope himself had preached tolerance and mercy, Philip would have
  given no heed, but would have quoted the council of Trent as the yardstick by
  which to measure Christians and have gone his way.</p>

  <p>His was the terrible strength of bigotry, of a nature unbalanced by
  unlimited power, his was the unswerving purpose of a nature corrupt and cruel
  to the inmost fibre, the diseased, half-insane product of a degenerate
  race.</p>

  <p>William had never deceived himself into thinking of Philip as a puppet in
  the hands of men like Granvelle and Alva or women like the Princess of
  Eboli&mdash;Philip in himself was terrible, awful and greatly to be
  feared.</p>

  <p>His personal, ceaseless industry had woven the nets that had caught the
  grandees of the Netherlands, his personal flattery had lured Egmont to the
  block and Berghen to his secret death, his personal wish had forced the
  Inquisition on the Netherlands and imposed those edicts which had made a
  hideous ruin of a prosperous country and condemned to deaths of a horror
  unspeakable thousands of those innocent of all save the desire of liberty of
  conscience.</p>

  <p>He had had willing, greedy and unscrupulous tools, but the mainspring of
  all their actions had been his own inexorable will, his unfaltering command,
  his pitiless intrigue, his insatiable cruelty.</p>

  <p>Behind Alva, as behind Granvelle, was always Philip.</p>

  <p>William knew that he had to struggle with Philip of Spain, that thin
  precise figure with the white face and reddish hair and beard, the bright
  blue eyes, and the under-hanging jaw that he had known in the old days when
  he was friend and favourite of Charles V.</p>

  <p>What use the corruption, the faction, the intrigue, the financial
  embarrassments of Spain while Philip continued her unquestioned
  ruler&mdash;his narrow policies might involve in ruin his own empire as well
  as the countries subject to him, but they would never yield.</p>

  <p>No peace, no agreement could ever be come to with Philip, who "would
  rather lose all his dominions than see them peopled with heretics," and who
  would never spare even his own in pursuance of his inflexible resolves, as he
  had not spared his miserable son. William had long ago faced this, he was
  fighting a foe who had stripped him of everything and was using infinite
  pains to deprive him of life itself. To fight Philip was like fighting wind
  and tide in a rudderless boat.</p>

  <p>Yet the Prince of Orange never faltered in his belief that it could be
  done.</p>

  <p>He slowly read the letter which contained details of the recent death of
  Hoorne's brother, Montigny.</p>

  <p>The gallant young Netherlander, after long enduring the torture of a
  Spanish jail, had been secretly executed on the eve of Philip's third wife's
  entry into Spain.</p>

  <p>The king knew that the dowager Countess of Hoorne had besought this bride,
  the Austrian Princess, to ask her son's life as a first favour from her
  husband and he had forestalled her petition.</p>

  <p>William folded up the paper and stared down into the swirling
  mill-stream.</p>

  <p>A slow colour mounted into his face; Montigny had been his
  friend&mdash;well he recalled him, young, honourable, and impetuous.</p>

  <p>A brilliant life, full of promise&mdash;and because he had defied Philip
  it had ended in the executioner putting the cord round his neck.</p>

  <p>William mused bitterly; he wondered, if ever he should even partially
  succeed, whether any of his friends would be there to rejoice with him.</p>

  <p>Even now there were so few...he felt curiously lonely; yet if only they
  left him Louis, his beloved brother, and Henry, the boy who had so eagerly
  followed the fortunes of his elders, and John, the faithful and
  loyal&mdash;</p>

  <p>Could these but remain there might yet be happiness snatched from
  bereavement.</p>

  <p>He wished Louis would marry, and, thinking this, he thought of Charlotte
  de Bourbon.</p>

  <p>She would make a man happy in his home; she was formed for that; his mind
  dwelt on her with great tenderness.</p>

  <p>He had no passion to give any woman now&mdash;but he might need a wife. At
  this reflection he smiled to himself&mdash;she a renegade, a runaway nun, he
  a homeless exile.</p>

  <p>And his wife lived, disgraced, mad, repudiated, she yet lived.</p>

  <p>He thought of her with no pity; that loveless marriage of convenience had
  burnt itself out into bitter ashes indeed and he could rake no spark of
  sympathy nor kindness from them; but he thought of her son Maurice with
  affection&mdash;his only son, since that poor prisoner in Spain was dead to
  him and to the Netherlanders.</p>

  <p>But Maurice "who may live to complete what I can scarcely
  begin"&mdash;William dwelt on him with pride&mdash;a fine boy, and again he
  thought, he and the others would be better for a home.</p>

  <p>Count John came to the mill as fast as his horse could carry him, but the
  time of waiting had seemed long to William, who almost regretted that he had
  not pushed on to Dillenburg.</p>

  <p>They met outside the mill-house, on the rocky banks of the stream.</p>

  <p>John of Nassau was the most ordinary member of his house, he had neither
  the genius of his elder nor fire of his younger brothers, but he was dearly
  loved by all, and his character, loyal and courageous, was felt by them to be
  something always stable and unchanging in the midst of their shifting and
  desperate fortunes.</p>

  <p>They could always turn to John, keeping up the home at Dillenburg,
  offering asylum and protection to the weaker members of the family, supplying
  what assistance he could.</p>

  <p>He was not, perhaps, the man to have done what William and Louis had done,
  but rather one to go peacefully with the tide, but this made his
  self-sacrifice the finer, for he had practically ruined himself for the cause
  which his brothers had embraced and staked all, without a complaint, in a
  quarrel that was none of his seeking.</p>

  <p>The Prince often thought, with a gratitude that was not unlike remorse, of
  what the quiet John had done for him without a thought of recompense or
  return and in his heavy moments it seemed to him as if he had dragged the
  whole of his family into an undeserved ruin.</p>

  <p>The brothers sat down on the short dry grass.</p>

  <p>"It is so dark in those small rooms," said William, "and I have grown
  enamoured of the open air."</p>

  <p>He asked after all at Dillenburg, and John answered with an eagerness that
  was almost impatience; it was plain that he had great news to impart.</p>

  <p>"You have something to tell me?" asked the Prince keenly.</p>

  <p>"Something that you should have known before," replied the other with a
  certain reproach, "but you keep us so short of news&mdash;we know not of your
  whereabouts from one week to another."</p>

  <p>"It is not so easy to send messengers," said William, "wandering as I do
  in disguise from place to place through unfriendly countries. Now give me
  your news."</p>

  <p>His worn face slightly flushed in response to the obvious excitement of
  his brother's.</p>

  <p>"Guess," said John, "from where it comes."</p>

  <p>"From England?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, their game is too cautious, they play but for their own
  profit&mdash;it is no great nation, but your Sea Beggars who have brought you
  fortune."</p>

  <p>"The Sea Beggars!" said William, and the light died from his eyes.</p>

  <p>He had no faith in these pirates who sailed his flag and held his charter
  and had long since dismissed them from his mind as of no profit and some
  disgrace to his cause.</p>

  <p>Under his right as a sovereign Prince he had some years ago issued
  "letters of mark" to a number of Netherland nobles, with the idea that the
  ships they commanded would form the nucleus of a navy to annoy Philip and
  defend the Low Countries.</p>

  <p>But his mandates had been disobeyed and his authority defied, and the Sea
  Beggars, as they called themselves, had degenerated into pirates, whose
  excesses had dishonoured their flag and whose plunder went no further than
  their own pockets.</p>

  <p>The last that William had heard of them was that Elizabeth of England, in
  deference either to the continued protests of Philip, or because of the
  behaviour of the pirates themselves, had closed her ports to them and that
  they were, henceforth, without harbours or any refuge, but compelled to
  remain on the High Seas, without a base, and depending on coast raids, and
  now his brother told him that these ruffians, lately reduced to desperation,
  had brought him fortune.</p>

  <p>"I had not looked to hear good news from De la Marck," smiled William.</p>

  <p>John laid his hand on his brother's shabby sleeve. "He has descended on
  Brill&mdash;captured the Spanish garrison, received the keys in your name and
  hoisted your flag."</p>

  <p>William coloured swiftly.</p>

  <p>"De la Marck has done this?" he exclaimed, and he thought of the despair
  and contempt with which he had hitherto regarded his Admiral&mdash;as a
  useless instrument he had always considered him.</p>

  <p>"Yes. We have now a base in the Netherlands, a town we can call our own.
  It is a great thing&mdash;the turning of the tide."</p>

  <p>For one moment William shared his brother's enthusiasm; he saw this
  success as the beginning of a real change of fortune&mdash;himself taking up,
  by will of the people, the former stadtholderships he had held, Holland,
  Zeeland and Utrecht&mdash;then his native prudence, strengthened by so many
  disappointments, cast down his spirits.</p>

  <p>"Can one trust De la Marck or his Beggars?" he asked sadly. "The thing is
  hasty, I will not build on it. I have better hopes in this tax of Alva, which
  he is resolved to enforce and which greatly rouses the Netherlands."</p>

  <p>"That also works in our favour," agreed John. "There has not been so much
  dissatisfaction since Alva began to rule."</p>

  <p>"That I count on&mdash;not on De la Marck!"</p>

  <p>"But you are wrong," said John earnestly. "Have you heard Louis'
  news?"</p>

  <p>"He is still at La Rochelle?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;but descending into the Netherlands on Mons&mdash;he too, they
  say, called the Beggars hasty, but he is endeavouring to follow up their
  success, I believe he has affected some agreement with the French Huguenots,
  but his letters are brief."</p>

  <p>William sat thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"Louis was ever sanguine," he said, "and so he would fall on Mons,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"And you?" asked John.</p>

  <p>"You would ask what I have done? I rely on Coligny, John&mdash;he is a
  great power, and may bring a quarter of France to our aid, the Protestant
  faction is strong there."</p>

  <p>"And the King&mdash;the Queen-Mother?"</p>

  <p>"I believe that they may think it wise to conclude a Protestant
  alliance&mdash;the marriage between the King's sister and the King of Navarre
  seems likely to be accomplished."</p>

  <p>"You trust them?"</p>

  <p>"Nay,&mdash;but I believe that expediency will force them to act in our
  interests&mdash;and on Coligny I do rely."</p>

  <p>"What will you do?" asked John.</p>

  <p>"I must a little while consider," replied the Prince; he rose, "let us
  into the house."</p>

  <p>As they turned towards the mill he spoke again and abruptly.</p>

  <p>"What of the Princess&mdash;Anne my wife?"</p>

  <p>"She is at Beilstein still, under restraint&mdash;partially."</p>

  <p>"She should be wholly so&mdash;we maintain her?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;it is a heavy drain, William, her mad fancies cost dearly."</p>

  <p>"She shall," replied the Prince with a most unusual force, "be returned to
  her people. And Jan Rubens?"</p>

  <p>"Is still in prison."</p>

  <p>"Let him go&mdash;to punish him would be to make the affair public, and,
  poor fool, we know whose fault it was."</p>

  <p>"She did confess as much when writing to me to intercede for her."</p>

  <p>"I will never," said William, "see her again, yet I would have her
  dishonour kept secret, for the sake of the name&mdash;and of Maurice."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-6"
     id="ch1-6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE TURNING TIDE</h2>

  <p class="first">That spring of 1572 was a time of great hope for the
  hitherto apparently lost cause of the Protestants and their leaders, the
  Nassau Princes and Admiral Coligny.</p>

  <p>The bold capture of the Brill, though accompanied by many outrages and
  cruelties on the part of De la Marck, had undoubtedly been a turning-point in
  the long struggle between Philip and his Dutch subjects.</p>

  <p>The rebels now possessed a town, had proclaimed their leader Stadtholder
  of three provinces and held a stronghold is the Netherlands, as the Huguenots
  held La Rochelle in France. Never had the country been more favourably
  inclined to throw off the dominion of Philip, never had Alva been so
  unpopular nor his agents so hated.</p>

  <p>The tax of the tenth penny, proclaimed some time ago, but not so far
  enforced, had done more to rouse the people even than persecution and the
  Inquisition; even those who were prepared to abjure their faith were not
  prepared to submit to a tax that struck at the roots of their livelihood, and
  the menace of revolt was again heard threatening Philip from Zeeland to
  Brabant. But Alva was desperate as well as pitiless; he could get no money
  from Spain and did not hesitate in the ruthless expedient of wringing the
  last drops of blood from the country crushed by his tyranny.</p>

  <p>The tax was enforced with great vigour, men now suffered for their
  property as they had formerly suffered for their religion, tradesmen who had
  proved obdurate were hanged outside their shops, merchants who protested were
  denounced to the Inquisition and hurried away to a secret death.</p>

  <p>None the less the money came in slowly and the mutterings of revolt grew
  louder, and Alva, though he believed the Netherlanders crushed and the Prince
  of Orange broken, was angry enough to increase his cruelties and thereby the
  hatred felt against him.</p>

  <p>The capture of the Brill had been a rude blow to Spanish pride and now
  Louis of Nassau was advancing on Mons with an army of French Huguenots, and a
  high tide of enthusiasm was rising for the Protestant cause and the Prince of
  Orange.</p>

  <p>William himself was not idle; he did not wholly approve of the capture of
  the Brill, nor was his brother's impetuous march into Flanders entirely to
  his mind, but he knew how to take advantage of the reckless actions of other
  men.</p>

  <p>His pamphlets, inciting citizens to protest and towns to revolt, were
  distributed, despite Alva's precautions, in the length and breadth of the
  Netherlands, and many a lampoon and pointed pasquinade found its way into the
  palace at Brussels and into the Viceroy's own hand.</p>

  <p>Abroad also, politics now favoured the Reformed Faith. Elizabeth of
  England, despite the recent closing of her ports to the Sea Beggars, was not
  on friendly terms with Philip, whose dismissal of her ambassador to. Madrid
  she chose to regard as an affront, and she held out more than one tentative
  hope that she might help the Netherlanders when they had a little further
  helped themselves; William did not place much reliance on these
  half-promises, knowing that the Queen of England cared for neither rebels nor
  Calvinists and was certainly not ever likely to espouse a losing cause; at
  the same time she had good reason to both hate and fear Philip and might
  easily ally herself with any rising power which should threaten his dominion;
  the daughter of the Englishwoman who had displaced a Spanish Princess, the
  Protestant who was regarded by Catholics as illegitimate could not have
  anything but expediency in common with Philip of Spain, who had burnt alive
  and tortured to death many a less ardent Protestant than was Elizabeth of
  England herself.</p>

  <p>But the Prince of Orange's greatest hopes were fixed on France.</p>

  <p>It seemed that finally the shifting, dubious policies of the Italian
  Queen-Mother had decided on a pacific course with regard to the powerful
  party of the Protestants within her kingdom.</p>

  <p>The marriage of her daughter Margaret, with Henry, son of Antony de
  Bourbon and the heroic Jeanne D'Albret, Queen of Navarre, was finally
  arranged and to take place that autumn, Coligny and his faction were more or
  less in favour and William's representations on behalf of the provinces
  listened to at least graciously.</p>

  <p>It appeared not to be ungrateful to the Queen-Mother to put forward one of
  her younger sons as competitor for the sovereignty of the Netherlands when
  they should be wrested from Spain, nor was she at all averse to dealing
  underhand mischief to Philip. William of Orange cared for none of these
  intrigues, despised all these motives, but he believed that he could not free
  the Province without powerful foreign aid, and to obtain this he was prepared
  to make any sacrifice. He was willing to himself step into the background and
  offer the crown of the Netherlands to any Prince who would take them under
  his protection; he knew, in his heart, that while he lived, any such king
  would be only a puppet, and he had long since taken the measure of the
  degenerate princes of the House of Valois, yet he was prepared to use any of
  these who might come forward, to outwardly defer to them, to invest them with
  all show of authority as long as he could obtain the alliance of France to
  set against the might of Spain.</p>

  <p>Not all his advisers agreed with him in this, but William did not see how
  he could succeed alone in the task he had undertaken. If when first he threw
  down the gage to Philip he had ever cherished such dreams, he had now long
  since dismissed them with other illusions of his youth.</p>

  <p>Too clearly did he see the difficulties, to be dazzled by the dreams that
  still kept Louis on fire with enthusiasm and spurned him on to his reckless
  glorious deeds.</p>

  <p>Yet he was not half-hearted in the cause in which he had staked and lost
  all&mdash;the spring had not blossomed into summer before he had once more
  taken the field and was marching towards Mons to effect a juncture with Louis
  who had now forced Mondvagon, the commander of the garrison, to surrender,
  and himself occupied the town.</p>

  <p>William's troops were partly German mercenaries and partly levies supplied
  by the rebellious states of Holland and Zeeland, who had accepted him again
  as their Stadtholder, ignoring Philip's nominee, Count van Bossu.</p>

  <p>Money began to come in, some provided by the State, some offered by
  private individuals, and William was encouraged.</p>

  <p>He was still, by a ludicrous adhesion to formula, acting as Philip's
  lieutenant, as such he had been received by the estates "without prejudice to
  any of the customs and rights of the land," so, bound by judicial convention
  and the laws of the states he was defending, William defied Philip in
  Philip's name and carried on a revolution in the outward symbol of the power
  he was rebelling against.</p>

  <p>Delay followed delay, before sufficient supplies were guaranteed to enable
  William to proceed in his campaign.</p>

  <p>Louis was beleaguered in Mons, and as yet his brother was not strong
  enough to attempt to relieve him.</p>

  <p>When at last the supplies came William crossed the Meuse and occupied
  Diest, Piulemont, Louvain, and Mechlin, which last town opened its gates and
  accepted his authority.</p>

  <p>William had now every hope of being able to raise the siege of Mons, join
  his brother and march through the Netherlands, delivering the towns and
  calling the people to his standard as he proceeded.</p>

  <p>He sat in his little tent this still August night and read letters from
  Admiral Coligny, promising him three thousand foot and twelve thousand
  arquebusiers which he was levying to help Louis in Mons.</p>

  <p>William read the news and allowed his hopes to paint a glorious
  future...</p>

  <p>Why not? he asked himself.</p>

  <p>He and Coligny, the two of them together, could they not do something?</p>

  <p>Freedom&mdash;liberty of conscience, the end of persecution, the return of
  prosperity, thriving cities with their busy market towns, a flourishing
  country-side, becoming powerful, respected, while such tyrannies as those of
  Philip decayed from their own inward rottenness and sank into oblivion.</p>

  <p>A mad dream, yet such things had been?</p>

  <p>So he mused; for all his astuteness and caution there was something mystic
  in his nature that responded to the unseen forces about him; to-night he felt
  them strongly. This sense of being withdrawn from himself soon became
  unbearable; he roused himself, made an abrupt movement and lifted his eyes.
  The tent flap was raised and a strange face was looking in on him, a face
  illumined by the lamp, yellow, haggard and lit by a melancholy smile.</p>

  <p>"The Prince of Orange dreams?" said this stranger and advanced into the
  tent.</p>

  <p>William regarded him steadily; the new-comer was a tall man wrapped in a
  large shabby black cloak.</p>

  <p>William put his hand round to his dagger; he thought this was one of
  Philip's assassins; with his senses all alert he waited.</p>

  <p>The stranger spread out his arms, which had been folded in his mantle, and
  thus showed that he was weaponless. "I am harmless," he said.</p>

  <p>He was indeed such a thin and miserable creature that William's curiosity
  was mingled with pity.</p>

  <p>"What errand have you come upon?" he asked. The other folded his arms
  again and gazed at him searchingly. "You do not remember me?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Yet we have many memories in common," replied the stranger. "I am a wise
  man, an astrologer."</p>

  <p>"Now I recall you&mdash;the alchemist's assistant&mdash;Dubois."</p>

  <p>"The man who foretold the death of your brother Adolphus."</p>

  <p>"And mine," smiled William.</p>

  <p>"And yours, Highness," said the astrologer sadly. The Prince was
  interested.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and talk to me," he said.</p>

  <p>Dubois obeyed and chose the little stool directly opposite the Prince.</p>

  <p>There was between them only the bare table with the plain lamp.</p>

  <p>"Tell me my fortunes," smiled the Prince. "To-night I am in a mounting
  mood and full of good augury."</p>

  <p>The spirit raiser shook his head gloomily and fixed his eyes on the figure
  of the man before him.</p>

  <p>William was seated on a folding camp chair of leather; behind him was a
  little desk covered with papers.</p>

  <p>He had put aside his mantle, for the night was oppressively hot, and his
  slight figure was clad in the brown cloth beneath armour, high soft boots and
  a collar of white lawn.</p>

  <p>His face was thin, the dark powerful eyes shadowed, the hair was mingled
  with grey on the temples, while he bore his forty years heavily, a man whose
  youth was utterly gone.</p>

  <p>There was little trace now of the splendid young Prince who had come to
  Leipsic to marry Anne of Saxony, nor of the magnificent Grandee who had held
  his state in Brussels during the rule of Margaret of Parma.</p>

  <p>"We have come to much the same level, Prince," said Dubois.</p>

  <p>"You are a strange fellow," answered William. "Why are you in my
  camp?"</p>

  <p>"I am like a dog, I follow where there is meat and drink."</p>

  <p>"What did you come to tell me?"</p>

  <p>"Your fortune, if you will."</p>

  <p>"I make my own fortune."</p>

  <p>"Let your Princely Grace tell me, then, what will your to-morrow be?"</p>

  <p>"A short day," said William, "and one with a red sunset&mdash;do I not
  prophesy well?"</p>

  <p>"Your Highness has much courage," said the astrologer. "Do you truly
  foresee this future before you?"</p>

  <p>"I see," replied William, "that I shall no more escape Philip than my
  friends have escaped him, whom you have seen fall one by one."</p>

  <p>"And Louis?"</p>

  <p>"Louis and Henry and John," said the Prince. "I think the whole House of
  Nassau is dedicate to sacrifice."</p>

  <p>Dubois did not answer and William too was silent, staring at the fantastic
  figure of the man; no prophecies could frighten the Prince, his own mind
  prophesied his own violent end, but he was confident that he might accomplish
  much before that, he cherished also a secret hope that the young Louis and
  the boyish Henry might be spared his fate and survive to see the triumphs he
  would not enjoy.</p>

  <p>Dubois looked at him and sighed.</p>

  <p>"And Coligny?" he said. "What does your Highness foresee for Coligny?"</p>

  <p>William was startled.</p>

  <p>"I had no dark thoughts for Coligny," he answered quickly.</p>

  <p>"You hope much from France?"</p>

  <p>"That is common knowledge."</p>

  <p>Dubois looked at him long and earnestly as he replied.</p>

  <p>"It were wise for your Highness to rely on none but yourself&mdash;so you
  will best escape disappointment." William smiled, but the old chill of
  disillusion touched his heart; he thought the fellow half mad, a trickster,
  yet his words had their effect, for William knew that he did rely on Coligny
  and the promised aid from France. His mood of tolerance for the charlatan
  vanished.</p>

  <p>"You must learn less melancholy if you would be successful," he said, "and
  to-night&mdash;I listen to no forebodings&mdash;my star is in the ascendant,"
  he added with a little smile. Dubois bowed, and without waiting for the piece
  of money William was about to give him in memory of Leipsic and Brussels
  days, left the tent as silently as he had entered. The Prince turned again to
  the Admiral's letter; his mood was still one of elation&mdash;he seemed to
  hear the cries of victory and all the ill-lit gloom of his tent was filled
  with the light of the dawn of another and triumphant day.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-7"
     id="ch1-7"></a>VII. &mdash; AUGUST, 1572</h2>

  <p class="first">A great heat fell over the land; and the nights were as
  stifling as the days. The army of William of Orange moved forward under the
  blazing skies, always toward Mons.</p>

  <p>As yet Alva had made no sign; they were unopposed, and at first everywhere
  the peasants rose to welcome them, believing that justice would follow in the
  wake of the banner of the Prince of Orange.</p>

  <p>But William's advance began soon to be attended with the difficulties and
  perils inseparable from his enterprise and the humiliations always attendant
  on a leader of mercenaries.</p>

  <p>Excess, pillage, and ruin began to mark the track of his army and he was
  as powerless to control the men he led as he had been powerless to control
  the wild pirates of De la Marck.</p>

  <p>The villagers began to flee at their approach, the towns to shut their
  gates, preferring the tenth penny tax to the mercy of the German mercenaries.
  But William refused to be disheartened, even when Philip Marnix, Lord of Ste.
  Aldegonde, was discouraged and fell into a melancholy.</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde was, after the Nassau brothers, the Prince's truest friend
  and most trusted councillor, his eloquent pen was always at William's service
  and his writing had proved of material service in furthering the cause of the
  rebels in the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>To his sensitive nature the conduct of the Prince's troops was a bitter
  grief.</p>

  <p>He even ventured to remonstrate with the Prince for taking things too
  easily.</p>

  <p>The little invading army had pressed on within two leagues of Mons;
  between them and the city was the army of Alva, under the command of Don
  Frederic de Toledo, his son.</p>

  <p>Scouts had reported that their headquarters were at the little village of
  St. Florin, near one of the town gates.</p>

  <p>William was cautiously making for this point; when the reinforcements
  arrived from France he intended to fall on the Spaniards and force his way in
  to his brother in Mons.</p>

  <p>He had already managed to send a letter to Louis in which he conjured him
  to hold out until the arrival of Coligny and the Huguenots, and Louis had
  replied cheerfully; his faith was also placed on the French.</p>

  <p>The Prince's lodging was in a deserted farmhouse, while the rambling
  out-buildings were occupied by troops and horses; none of the farm creatures
  were left save only the great flock of white pigeons that flew in and out of
  their half-ruined houses.</p>

  <p>The Prince's residence had little changed the room; he had touched
  nothing; his mantle over the bed, his pistols on the bureau, his dog asleep
  in the square of sunlight on the floor, and a wallet full of papers on the
  linen press were the only signs of his occupation.</p>

  <p>He had been several hours in the saddle, inspecting his army, and was
  tired.</p>

  <p>He sat at the window, reclining in one of the deep old chairs.</p>

  <p>When Ste. Aldegonde entered he hardly turned his head; the was interested
  in watching the play of the pigeons below as they chased each other across
  the warm bricks, ruffling their breasts and spreading their tails.</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde saw the Prince's fatigue, but was too full of his subject
  to refrain from speaking.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness is pleased with your men?" he asked with some
  abruptness.</p>

  <p>William slightly lifted his shoulders and did not answer.</p>

  <p>"You are too easy," said Philip Marnix.</p>

  <p>William looked at him with sudden keenness; it occurred to him, with a
  touch of bitter humour, that he had always been too easy&mdash;to all, from
  his wife to his dog, it was proof of it that Philip Marnix was so talking to
  him now.</p>

  <p>"Go on with the indictment," he said, and again looked from the
  window.</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde was in earnest; he spoke of what had long rankled in his
  heart and disturbed his conscience.</p>

  <p>"It were better for you to be as formerly," he said, "without a sword to
  answer your call, than to lead these cutthroats. Your soldiers," continued
  Ste. Aldegonde, "commit the very wrongs they come to redress."</p>

  <p>"It is one of the ironies of life," replied the Prince, "that evil must be
  fought with evil."</p>

  <p>"You cover yourself with discredit&mdash;you make your approach dreaded as
  much as the approach of Alva," he said.</p>

  <p>"What would you have me do?" asked William. "Dismiss these mercenaries and
  wait to be captured by the Spanish&mdash;abandon Louis and fly back to
  Dillenburg?"</p>

  <p>"There should be discipline and punishment," said Philip Marnix.</p>

  <p>The Prince looked at him sternly, and spoke, contrary to his custom, with
  some passion.</p>

  <p>"Have you not seen for yourself that I have tried these I If I were a
  great and sovereign Prince I might hang every man who touched the property of
  the poorest kind&mdash;I might make myself obeyed and feared. But I am a poor
  adventurer, Ste. Aldegonde, whose pay is miserable and whose authority is
  dubious, I am a rebel defying a great king&mdash;a man outlawed and exiled,
  shall I then get any but the desperate and the undisciplined to fight for
  me?"</p>

  <p>"You have the greatest cause in the world!" cried Philip Marnix&mdash;"the
  cause of liberty."</p>

  <p>"Find me saints and angels to sustain me," replied the Prince, "and we
  will keep this cause unsullied, but while I have to buy human assistance I
  shall have such an army as this I lead now. Do you not see it, Ste.
  Aldegonde?"</p>

  <p>"I see, Highness, nothing but confusion," replied his friend bitterly.</p>

  <p>"You take too near a view&mdash;look ahead and see the thing in the
  broad."</p>

  <p>Philip Marnix walked up and down the polished floor. "De la Marck&mdash;do
  you approve of him?"</p>

  <p>The Prince raised his eyebrows but answered gravely&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The capture of the Brill has proved a turning-point for us."</p>

  <p>"And a shame also. How many martyrs may not the Catholics make from De la
  Marck's victims? Did he not behead four Spanish captains?"</p>

  <p>"Two for Egmont and two for Hoorne," said William. "And what of it? Do you
  think that this issue will be decided by gentle deeds? Do you think that all
  the fiends of hate and vengeance that Philip's men have roused in these
  wretched countries can be easily silenced? This was a peaceful
  people&mdash;if monks are murdered, blame the Inquisition which made the name
  of monk an infamy; if churches are sacked, blame the hideous deeds that were
  committed in the name of God; if the poor and helpless are wronged and slain,
  blame that tyranny which showed how little value the humble had in the eyes
  of Princes and of Governments."</p>

  <p>He spoke quietly but with force and his words brought the colour into his
  thin face.</p>

  <p>"You will then take any means to your end?" asked Ste. Aldegonde.</p>

  <p>"I must take the only means or stand aside with folded hands."</p>

  <p>"Is this the only means? You are Stadtholder again of three provinces, do
  you need men like De la Marck, troops like these German mercenaries?"</p>

  <p>The Prince smiled at his friend's earnestness.</p>

  <p>"I do indeed," he answered. "Think you that I am yet on stable
  ground?"</p>

  <p>Philip Marnix looked away with a clouded face. "At least Coligny is a
  clean ally," he said.</p>

  <p>"Coligny, yes!" answered William, "and his soldiers are men who fight not
  for money but for their faith&mdash;but they are not enough."</p>

  <p>He rose, stretched himself and looked out of the window; he was ever in
  the hopes of seeing a messenger from the Admiral telling of his near
  approach; William had expected the arrival of the Huguenots before this,
  inasmuch as it had been agreed that the attack on the Spanish was to wait
  until French help was available and Louis would not be able to hold Mons much
  longer.</p>

  <p>In the courtyard sat Dubois, the so-called astrologer, who had attached
  himself to the camp, where he was tolerated because of the amusement to be
  derived from his profession, which he was always willing to exercise in
  exchange for food, clothes or a handful of white money.</p>

  <p>William half liked the melancholy seer, who had told hint his fortune on
  his wedding day and whom he had sheltered so long in his palace.</p>

  <p>That Dubois had repaid this protection by allowing the Princess of Orange
  to use his laboratory as a place of rendezvous with the young lawyer, Jan
  Rubens, William did not know; so indifferent was he to the doings of little
  people that he would probably have cared nothing had he been aware of the
  charlatan's intrigues.</p>

  <p>He now called Ste. Aldegonde and pointed out the tall thin figure of the
  wise man, seated huddled on the base of the wall that ran round the
  courtyard.</p>

  <p>"See my astrologer," he smiled. "Shall I not have my court as well as
  Philip?"</p>

  <p>But Philip Marnix was not the man to understand the Prince's lightness;
  his simple outlook could not appreciate William's complexity.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness is too easy," he repeated.</p>

  <p>"While we live in the world we must live as the world," said William,
  "when we are saints in heaven we may cease to jest and cease to sin."</p>

  <p>"You are in a gay mood," replied Ste. Aldegonde.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Philip, I do feel within me the portents of success. Shall we not all
  be happy when Coligny comes?"</p>

  <p>He took his friend's arm and Ste. Aldegonde smiled.</p>

  <p>William's personality was stronger than his cause in winning men.</p>

  <p>"Let my wise man come up and he shall make you laugh."</p>

  <p>So saying the Prince leant from the window and called to Dubois, who came
  slowly into the house.</p>

  <p>The room faced west and the late sunshine now filled it from end to
  end.</p>

  <p>The Prince sat in his low place, but Ste. Aldegonde was restless and ill
  at ease; William offered him wine; himself he drank cinnamon and barley
  water; he could live on water and black bread, but he was an epicure and fond
  of fine living and he could not drink the sour wines his companions found
  satisfying.</p>

  <p>Dubois entered, and gave a glance full of suspicion at the slender figure
  and dark face of Ste. Aldegonde, then looked at the Prince.</p>

  <p>"What did your Grace want with me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We have a space of idleness," he said, "bring out your charts and read
  the future."</p>

  <p>Dubois said nothing; he took his chin in his hand and stared out of the
  window.</p>

  <p>William's glance followed the astrologer's look.</p>

  <p>"Tell me I shall never enter Mons," he said. "You were always a merry
  prophet."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing of Mons," returned Dubois with an angry air.</p>

  <p>The Prince turned to look sharply at him.</p>

  <p>"What mood are you in, fellow?" asked Ste. Aldegonde, who was vexed at the
  intrusion of the seer.</p>

  <p>Dubois did not reply; his demeanour was strange, sullen and secretive.</p>

  <p>He avoided the gaze of either of the gentlemen and continued to fix his
  eyes on the sunset.</p>

  <p>"The spirits are recalcitrant to-day," said William. "Do they say nothing,
  friend?"</p>

  <p>Dubois looked at him now, his features were drawn by a slow grin.</p>

  <p>"They say that you had better not wait for Admiral Coligny."</p>

  <p>"I am half of their opinion," returned William good-humouredly, "and
  minded to make the attack without him."</p>

  <p>"Neither with nor without him will you enter Mons," replied Dubois. "Your
  Grace knows I have the second sight&mdash;to-day I see very clear."</p>

  <p>Philip Marnix shivered; he was not free of the common superstitions and
  supernatural fears engendered in the minds of men; nor did the Prince scorn
  occult arts; he loved to search for the grain of truth usually hidden in the
  husks of the charlatan's tricks and fooleries.</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you see," he said, and he leant forward a little.</p>

  <p>"The air is full of portent," replied Dubois. "I see nothing clearly but
  disaster."</p>

  <p>"Enough, enough!" cried Philip Marnix.</p>

  <p>"Nay, I will hear," said the Prince. "Tell me what you know."</p>

  <p>Dubois narrowed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I know that Admiral Coligny is dead."</p>

  <p>This was so unexpected, so unlikely and so terrible that both listeners
  were startled into an exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Dead some days," continued Dubois, careless of the impression he made. "I
  saw him last night walking up and down the camp and wringing his hands. He
  was all covered with wounds and had a rope round his neck."</p>

  <p>William rose.</p>

  <p>"You turn my complaisance into an ugly jest," he said sternly.</p>

  <p>"You bade me speak."</p>

  <p>"And now unsay your words," cried Ste. Aldegonde in great agitation.</p>

  <p>"I am silent," replied Dubois sullenly.</p>

  <p>William recovered his composure.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he said quietly, "how should Coligny be in this manner
  slain?"</p>

  <p>The seer shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I only know that at this moment&mdash;and for this many a day past,
  Coligny's body has been hanging on the gallows and his spirit wailing up and
  down the camp&mdash;but who had eyes to see it?"</p>

  <p>William looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"You give my jest a strange turn. If this were true it would be the
  bitterest news I could receive."</p>

  <p>"Did I not tell you," replied Dubois with a certain eagerness, as if
  defending himself, "that it were better if you relied upon
  yourself&mdash;yourself alone, Prince?"</p>

  <p>"Let him go," said Ste. Aldegonde nervously, "he does not know what he
  says. Why should your Grace discourage yourself with these hideous tales of
  folly?"</p>

  <p>Dubois gave him a cunning look.</p>

  <p>"You believe in what I say and you are afraid, Seigneur de Ste.
  Aldegonde."</p>

  <p>"Why should I be afraid?" retorted Philip Marais fiercely.</p>

  <p>The Prince, who had never taken his eyes off Dubois, now spoke.</p>

  <p>"Whether you have a power or speak from wantonness," he said, "your words
  are useless. What can I do but wait?"</p>

  <p>"Your Highness is a fatalist," returned Dubois with some admiration.</p>

  <p>"What you will," said William, with a faint smile, at which Ste. Aldegonde
  greatly wondered. "Sometimes I can make events, more often I must wait on
  them&mdash;as now."</p>

  <p>"I swear to you," said Dubois, with more life than he had yet shown, "that
  Gaspard de Coligny is dead and hanging on the gallows."</p>

  <p>William gazed at him in silence.</p>

  <p>The astrologer bowed and left the room.</p>

  <p>The Prince looked at his friend, who was discomposed and flushed.</p>

  <p>"You do not believe and yet you fear?"</p>

  <p>"I think, Highness&mdash;supposing this fellow had received private
  information?"</p>

  <p>They looked at each other.</p>

  <p>"That is what I also thought," said William.</p>

  <p>That evening arrived the stupendous news that on St. Bartholomew's and the
  wedding day of Margaret de Valois and Henry of Navarre all the Huguenots in
  Paris had been massacred by order of the Queen-Mother, and that Admiral
  Coligny, after having been butchered in his own home, had been flung from the
  window amid the insults of his assassins and then dragged to the public
  gallows.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-8"
     id="ch1-8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE FUGITIVES</h2>

  <p class="first">For the first time in his career William was stunned by the
  extent of his misfortune; he remained, as did all the Protestants of Europe,
  bewildered and amazed.</p>

  <p>The thing was so incredible, so sudden, had been prepared with such
  cunning secrecy, that it silenced like a blow delivered in the dark.
  Catherine de' Medici had completely deceived the Protestants, who were
  rejoicing at her alliance and at the marriage of her daughter with the
  Huguenot King of Navarre at the very moment when she was planning their utter
  destruction.</p>

  <p>And utter destruction it had been; the defenceless victims gathered in
  Paris for the marriage festivities had no chance of resistance nor of escape;
  in the streets, houses, shops, in the palace itself, they were butchered
  where they stood and the lunatic king himself sat at his window and fired on
  the wretched fugitives in the courtyard.</p>

  <p>The Admiral and his son-in-law had died a hideous and ignominious death
  and with them ended the party of the Huguenots in France.</p>

  <p>William saw that very clearly; what had been a compact powerful movement
  led by a man of enthusiasm and genius had now ceased to exist; nor was there
  any hope that it might be re-created&mdash;at least for many years.</p>

  <p>The flame of the Reformed Faith that had burnt so bravely and steadily in
  France was now quenched in blood; the Netherlands 'must look elsewhere for
  help.</p>

  <p>At one blow William's strongest hopes had been swept away.</p>

  <p>He could almost hear Philip's laughter and Granvelle's words of triumph;
  no reinforcements would come from France, no encouragement from Coligny. He
  stood alone, isolated with his little mercenary army, more or less in Alva's
  power.</p>

  <p>And Louis too had been counting on French help, and</p>

  <p>Louis had loved Coligny; William's heart ached for his brother facing this
  in the beleaguered city. The morning after he had received the news he sent
  again for the messenger that he might hear the incredible, horrible thing in
  full detail.</p>

  <p>This messenger was an agent or spy of his own whose post was on the French
  frontier; he had heard the awful story from some hall-insane survivors who
  had fled from Paris and had at once travelled into the Low Countries to
  inform the Prince, whose ordinary agencies would not be able to get the news
  through for some time yet; he had brought with him some of these fugitives,
  who were lodging now at the village of Hermigny, near by the camp.</p>

  <p>William received this man, Joort Van Pengers, who had been long in his
  employ, in his room in the farm-house.</p>

  <p>The shock of the news had told on the Prince; he was pale from a sleepless
  night and moved heavily, with his chin sunk on his breast.</p>

  <p>Van Pengers could tell him no more, he knew nothing beyond the bare
  facts.</p>

  <p>"And Coligny, you do not know how Coligny died?"</p>

  <p>"Only that he was murdered, Highness; they told different tales. But he
  was killed and thrown from the window and afterwards hung on the
  gallows."</p>

  <p>William could still hardly believe that he had been so utterly deceived in
  his estimate of the French Court and what they would do. If this was Philip's
  doing, if he had engineered this to prevent the Huguenots bringing help to
  the Netherlanders, then, William admitted, this time he had been outwitted by
  the cunning of the Escurial; the blood rushed to his face with this thought
  and he stared with angry eyes at Van Pengers.</p>

  <p>"So they killed him&mdash;butchered him like a rat in a corner. Poor,
  brave Coligny! He has gone after the others. As I shall go."</p>

  <p>"God forbid!" cried Van Pengers.</p>

  <p>"Ah, God "&mdash;said the Prince in a strange voice. "Why should He save
  me in preference to the others?"</p>

  <p>The old Netherlander was not at a loss.</p>

  <p>"Because your Highness is the very staff and support of a whole nation.
  What matter if the tree be lopped of its branches if the trunk remain?"</p>

  <p>William did not answer; he shaded his tired eyes with his hand and looked
  down at the floor. He was recalling a certain day in the woods of Vincennes
  when he had ridden with the King of France, and Henry had spoken in rash
  confidence of a scheme undertaken in conjunction with Spain for secretly
  planning a massacre of "these pestilent Huguenots."</p>

  <p>William, shocked and startled, had held his peace, but from then on he had
  felt that interest in, and sympathy for, the persecuted Protestants to whom
  he was now the guiding star.</p>

  <p>Yet he had allowed himself to be fooled, to be taken unawares and
  unprepared; he had never trusted France any more than he had trusted
  Spain...yet he had been fooled.</p>

  <p>Not an inkling of Catherine de' Medici's purpose had leaked out, nor from
  the cabinets of the Escurial had a single word of warning issued.</p>

  <p>His spies had been at fault, his costly and elaborate system of secret
  service had failed.</p>

  <p>And Louis was trapped in Mons and he was trapped outside, and Alva had but
  to move to crush them both.</p>

  <p>William, in the bitterness of his grief and disappointment, felt himself a
  useless fool.</p>

  <p>"I am no general and no statesman," he thought passionately, "and I had
  better give up this hopeless task."</p>

  <p>Van Pengers, looking at him wistfully, waited for his further word.</p>

  <p>The Prince roused himself to speak.</p>

  <p>"The King of Navarre escaped?"</p>

  <p>"Through good fortune and no lack of pains on the part of the Catholics.
  Most of his companions were slain."</p>

  <p>"And the King was cognisant of this?"</p>

  <p>"With his own hand he shot his subjects down," said the old man solemnly.
  "Many saw him, leaning from a window of the Louvre with a smoking carbine in
  his hand and shouting, 'Kill! kill!'"</p>

  <p>"He is insane," said William.</p>

  <p>"Ay," replied the Netherlander sadly, "but he is King of France."</p>

  <p>The Prince looked sharply at him</p>

  <p>"You are right," he said, "these madmen must be dealt with."</p>

  <p>He sighed and glanced out of the window.</p>

  <p>The meagreness of Van Penger's account disappointed him.</p>

  <p>"You can tell me no more?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have those under my protection who could tell your Highness
  everything."</p>

  <p>"Why did you bring them here?" asked William sadly, "we can do nothing for
  any."</p>

  <p>"Highness, these are two women"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Women!"</p>

  <p>&mdash;"of gentle nature. They had no escort but myself and I was engaged
  to find your Highness. So they accompanied me, but I think their thought was
  Switzerland where one has friends."</p>

  <p>"Who are they? I might know their names."</p>

  <p>"I am sworn," said Van Pengers humbly, "not to give their names, but if
  your Highness will visit them I believe that they will tell you
  everything."</p>

  <p>"Where do they lie?"</p>

  <p>"At Hermigny."</p>

  <p>"We push on there to-night and make that our headquarters, since I alone
  must attempt to relieve Louis."</p>

  <p>"Will your Grace see them?"</p>

  <p>"If they will allow of it. Go ahead and acquaint them of my coming, Van
  Pengers."</p>

  <p>That evening when the camp was struck and the little army moving nearer
  Mons, William rode to the tiny village of Hermigny and stopped at the humble
  cottage where the fugitives from Paris sheltered. Van Pengers, who had
  conducted him, ushered him into the kitchen and left.</p>

  <p>A peasant woman was setting yellow bowls and wooden spoons on the round
  wooden table; she hastened shyly through a side door as William entered.</p>

  <p>The place was very poor and made the Prince's lodging seem luxurious by
  contrast; a dim oil lamp gave the only light, the plaster walls were filled
  by rude shelves of crockery; in the wide open fireplace burnt a few boughs
  and sticks, over which hung an iron pot on a tripod.</p>

  <p>So bad was the light that for a moment William did not see a girl who sat
  on a bench inside the ingle-nook and who was intently regarding him. When he
  observed her she moved, and came forward into the room.</p>

  <p>She was no more than seventeen, fair with the fairness of some
  Frenchwomen, her features were firmly marked, her eyes large, her lips
  full.</p>

  <p>Her gown was of a coarse dark woollen stuff, fastened by a leathern
  girdle.</p>

  <p>Her desolate and pathetic appearance touched him; looking into her tragic
  eyes he could guess what St. Bartholomew had been.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle!"</p>

  <p>She interrupted.</p>

  <p>"I am a widow, Monseigneur. Your brother, Count Louis, was at my
  wedding."</p>

  <p>William looked at her; she stood near enough to the glow of the lamp for
  him to see that her eyes were swollen with weeping.</p>

  <p>"Why did your Highness come?" she asked, without either smile or
  resentment, but dully, like one who has ceased to feel much.</p>

  <p>"I hold myself the friend of all who suffer for Coligny," he said.</p>

  <p>"I am Louise de Coligny," she said.</p>

  <p>"The Admiral's daughter!"</p>

  <p>"His daughter and Charles de Teligny's widow. Both are murdered."</p>

  <p>For a moment he was too moved for speech&mdash;he raised her hand and
  pressed it closely between his and gazed into her face; in the delicate
  features of the daughter he could trace a resemblance to the father's noble
  countenance.</p>

  <p>The girl's tears overflowed again and ran slowly down her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I loved your father," said William.</p>

  <p>"I know. He spoke of you so often."</p>

  <p>"I thought to meet him before Mons."</p>

  <p>"To the last that was his intention&mdash;he was most hopeful of this
  enterprise."</p>

  <p>She withdrew her hand from his and seated herself at the table, supporting
  her chin in her palm.</p>

  <p>"And now he is gone&mdash;is dead," she said, "he and Charles&mdash;your
  Highness has heard of my husband?"</p>

  <p>"Monsieur de Teligny&mdash;he whom the Queen of Navarre sent to Jouane to
  help in the escape of the Princess de Bourbon?"</p>

  <p>"That was he. And now he is dead."</p>

  <p>"What can I say?" answered the Prince gently. "He died a martyr."</p>

  <p>"He died as they all died. All day the slaughter was&mdash;all
  day&mdash;in the morning the bells rang the signal and in the evening the
  work was not complete. They did not spare the women nor the little
  children&mdash;it was all blood, from the Louvre to the walls."</p>

  <p>She rose, staring at the Prince.</p>

  <p>"God let it be&mdash;though I saw it I can scarcely believe it."</p>

  <p>"And I," said William in a tone of great sadness, "am helpless to avenge
  them."</p>

  <p>"Vengeance will come from God," replied Louise de Coligny sternly.</p>

  <p>William saw that she held the same strong faith as her father had
  cherished; an intensity of conviction in the truth of one particular creed, a
  sincere belief in the protection and justice of God that the Prince with his
  complex nature had often envied.</p>

  <p>"Your messenger tells me you would hear how my father died," continued the
  girl. "Will your Highness be seated?"</p>

  <p>He took the chair opposite to her; and the earthenware lamp cast a thick
  yellow light over his dark face and her pale features.</p>

  <p>"He was wounded, Monseigneur. When he left the Louvre on the King of
  Navarre's wedding day one shot at him from the window of a house belonging to
  a creature of the Guise."</p>

  <p>"It was the Guise&mdash;I knew!"</p>

  <p>"He and his mother. The shot missed his heart but shattered his arm and
  his fingers."</p>

  <p>She paused, steadying herself, then went on in a lower voice.</p>

  <p>"I came to help my stepmother, Jacqueline, nurse him&mdash;my husband was
  with me. There began to be many rumours and many fears in Paris. That
  day&mdash;St. Bartholomew&mdash;the bells began to ring, very early&mdash;all
  over Paris.</p>

  <p>"There were so many people in the streets I went to watch at the window to
  see what was afoot, and so I saw the Guise coming&mdash;with all his men
  behind him&mdash;all villains with the white bandage on their
  arm&mdash;Monseigneur, they broke into the house, only the Duke remained
  below.</p>

  <p>"My husband ran out on to the stairs&mdash;they killed him and flung him
  into the hall.</p>

  <p>"Jacqueline and I stood in front of my father. There was no one else, but
  they pulled us apart and sent a pike through his breast.</p>

  <p>"He said no word and they dragged him to the window, and I, following, saw
  the Guise laugh and put his foot on him and his soldiers hacking at the
  corpse."</p>

  <p>She was silent a moment, staring at the lamp, and William could not
  speak.</p>

  <p>"I do not know what happened then&mdash;they overlooked us, I suppose.
  When night came on we fled and passed, somehow, the city gates&mdash;and so
  to your agent, of whom I had heard Charles speak, and he brought us
  here."</p>

  <p>"Madame de Coligny is with you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. She is ill and quite broken in spirit."</p>

  <p>"I do not think you will despair," said William.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said Madame de Teligny, "perhaps when I am very old I shall
  know peace and think of this as of a dream."</p>

  <p>"And I, who am not so young, shall never see peace, I think."</p>

  <p>"Your Highness was my father's great hope," continued the girl earnestly.
  "I know that he thought of you to the last."</p>

  <p>He thought of Charlotte de Bourbon and compared her with the daughter of
  the Huguenot leader; they were very different, yet they both held this
  unconquerable faith, and he smiled half wistfully at this earnestness.</p>

  <p>Yet it did encourage and hearten him to see these who had lost all
  themselves looking towards him with such trustfulness for the salvation of
  their common cause.</p>

  <p>"Do you know Mademoiselle de Bourbon?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, Highness, my husband saw her when she was Abbess of Jouane."</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle de Bourbon is at Heidelberg since this spring&mdash;you and
  Madame de Coligny would find a home there."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"We would live quite hidden. We saved some of our jewels and we have
  friends in Switzerland. Van Pengers was my father's close confidant, he will
  escort us, if your Highness permits."</p>

  <p>He did not attempt to argue with her.</p>

  <p>"I will see Van Pengers takes you away before there is an engagement," he
  said.</p>

  <p>And she answered, "Thank your grace, and commend me to Count Louis."</p>

  <p>And so they parted.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-9"
     id="ch1-9"></a>IX. &mdash; BEFORE MONS</h2>

  <p class="first">William could get no message through to Louis and no word
  came to him from Mons.</p>

  <p>But he knew that Louis must be aware that his brother was still pressing
  to his aid, despite the terrible disappointment of the French tragedy, and
  the thought of the Count and the little French garrison relying on him
  strengthened him into a firm resolve not to give up his task, despite the
  daily discouragements he received and the disheartened and even mutinous
  behaviour of the troops.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile no news came from the Spanish camp; no scouts nor spies could
  bring any information as to the likely movements of Don Frederic, who
  remained at St. Florin, guarding the principal entrance into Mons.</p>

  <p>The Prince fell into a resigned sadness, the reaction from his late brief
  period of hope.</p>

  <p>He had no love for the things of war.</p>

  <p>His heart was not in this work; his place was in the cabinet or in the
  Court; he himself knew his own strength; as a statesman he had no equal in
  Europe, as a general he was inferior to his brother Louis, and as an
  adventuring captain of mercenaries he was entirely unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>On the night of the eleventh of September a council was held in his
  tent.</p>

  <p>As he leant back in the deep chair that was his seat of state he looked at
  those gathered about him.</p>

  <p>His scrutiny had the calm interest of the man who sees too much and too
  clearly; these men, honest, well meaning, faithful, yet seemed to him so
  infinitely small compared with his requirements as to be hardly of any
  account.</p>

  <p>The dead friends of the past, Egmont, Montigny, Hoorne, Hoogstraaten, even
  Brederode, with all their faults, seemed gigantic in comparison with these
  with whom he had now to deal, and among whom he felt himself something of an
  alien.</p>

  <p>There were none left of his peers, save only his brothers. Coligny had
  been his mental equal, and now Coligny was gone.</p>

  <p>He clasped his long fingers under his chin and glanced from one to another
  of the little captains and petty burghers who comprised his council.</p>

  <p>All were talking together, eager with advice and suggestion.</p>

  <p>William was not listening, he knew that nothing they could say would alter
  his intentions or in the least sway his mind, for he intended to make an
  attack on the Spanish early the next morning.</p>

  <p>Yet still he sat in his place, courteous and smiling, and not one of them
  but believed that he was pleased with them and considering and weighing their
  arguments.</p>

  <p>The deputies of the three States were devoted in their expressions towards
  him, yet they preserved the fiction that Philip was still their king and
  master and that in his name they were fighting his generals.</p>

  <p>This did not irritate William nor even cause him to smile, it was a
  sophistry pleasing to his own line of thought.</p>

  <p>He would sooner fight Philip under forms of laws than openly avow himself
  a rebel, because, deep in his heart, there yet lingered the hope that he
  might force Philip to accept his terms and still remain Protector of the
  Netherlands. Some such thought animated the burghers, they were in revolt
  against Alva and the Inquisition and not against that far-away and vague
  figure, Philip of Spain.</p>

  <p>One stated that no more trust was to be put in France, and a murmur of
  assent went up from the others.</p>

  <p>"Not after St. Bartholomew," said a little deputy from Holland.</p>

  <p>William spoke, almost for the first time since the meeting had
  assembled.</p>

  <p>"Messieurs, we may have to use France, even after St. Bartholomew."</p>

  <p>They all looked at him, and the Prince explained himself.</p>

  <p>"What else have we to play against Spain?" he asked.</p>

  <p>They accepted his bluntness, not reminding him of the fiction of their
  loyalty.</p>

  <p>Only one said:</p>

  <p>"Better to be under one's natural tyrant than a foreign one."</p>

  <p>William smiled.</p>

  <p>"I said France might be used&mdash;not submitted to."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but can she be used?" asked Philip Marnix swiftly.</p>

  <p>General voices echoed his distrust.</p>

  <p>"The King is mad"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The Queen a sly Italian"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"They have murdered all the honest men."</p>

  <p>"Better trust England."</p>

  <p>"Better," said William, "trust no one. Messieurs, I said
  use&mdash;use!"</p>

  <p>He placed his hands on the table, leaning forward and looking at them.</p>

  <p>"England is as crafty as France," he continued, "and both as crafty as
  Spain. Do you think there is any pity, any admiration, any charity for us in
  the heart of Elizabeth? She works her own policies for her own benefit, and
  if she give us reluctant promises or still more reluctant aid, it is because
  she sees her interest in so doing. Yet which of you would refuse her
  help?"</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>"At least she is Protestant and has disfigured herself with no great
  treachery."</p>

  <p>"Such deeds as this of Bartholomew are not in the nature of the
  Northerners. The English will work in other ways."</p>

  <p>"Let your Highness, then," said the Deputy from Utrecht, "deal with
  England, not with France."</p>

  <p>But William would not relinquish the long-cherished idea of the French
  alliance.</p>

  <p>"I must deal where I can, Monsieur," he replied. "Do you not see that the
  position is a desperate one?"</p>

  <p>A captain of the German mercenaries ventured to remonstrate with the
  Prince.</p>

  <p>"Highness, who is left in France? Is not the Queen of Navarre suddenly
  dead at the French Court and her son forced to abjure his faith? Coligny and
  his friends murdered?"</p>

  <p>"Truly," replied the Prince. "I rely neither on the King of Navarre nor on
  the party of the Huguenots. These are no more to be considered, nor do I
  think that they will ever come to power again."</p>

  <p>"Why then," asked Ste. Aldegonde, "does your Grace speak of using
  France?"</p>

  <p>"I would use the Valois themselves."</p>

  <p>"In what way?"</p>

  <p>"By tempting their greed, their ambition and their vanity," said William
  calmly.</p>

  <p>There was silence; no one agreed with him, and he smiled a little,
  perceiving this.</p>

  <p>"It is soon to talk of this," he added pleasantly. "The next move is
  certainly in our own hands, Messieurs. It depends on us, and on us alone,
  whether or no we relieve Mons."</p>

  <p>He rose, dismissing them; his easy courtliness and his long experience
  made him completely master in any such gathering; they accepted his opinion
  without further demur and left the tent.</p>

  <p>The three States that now called him Stadtholder had already granted him
  larger powers than had ever been given before; he enjoyed a firmer foothold
  there than in any town in Belgium which had submitted to his authority.</p>

  <p>Philip Marnix lingered.</p>

  <p>William went to the entrance and looked out on to the night.</p>

  <p>He did not regret his lost power and splendour, but he would never become
  content with helplessness and poverty; he meant to regain what he had lost or
  in the attempt find his grave.</p>

  <p>"Ste. Aldegonde," he said, returning to the tent, "grow old."</p>

  <p>William was in his forty-first year, yet he spoke seriously when he spoke
  of age.</p>

  <p>He seated himself on the couch his friend had prepared.</p>

  <p>"Old unto death," he said.</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde recognized the cry of the man who has lost everything,
  home, children, wife, a place in the world, and who has cared for these
  things and misses them bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness was not made for this rough life," he answered
  sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>"You think that I hunger after the flesh-pots?" smiled the Prince. "Not
  that&mdash;but I am sometimes very lonely."</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde's quick sympathy knew that he was thinking of that secret
  shame, that cankering grief, his wretched wife, whose miserable existence
  drained his purse as it dishonoured his name.</p>

  <p>Whether he considered himself free or not Ste. Aldegonde did not know, so
  closely had the Nassau family concealed from even their friends the disgrace
  of the Princess of Orange and the particulars of her repudiation by her
  husband.</p>

  <p>It was only known that he never saw her nor spoke of her and that she
  lived at Beilstein under the guardianship of Count John, but never came to
  Dillenburg.</p>

  <p>"Do you think Count Louis will marry?" asked William suddenly.</p>

  <p>"If he can find an heiress," said Ste. Aldegonde frankly.</p>

  <p>The young Count, an easy lover and a favourite with women, had never
  disguised his intention of following the custom of his house and marrying a
  fortune.</p>

  <p>But to hear this to-night did not please William.</p>

  <p>"Heiresses do not wed with knight-errants," he replied. "I wish Louis
  would marry with Mademoiselle de Bourbon."</p>

  <p>"It has been suggested&mdash;but would be, Highness, unpopular."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked the Prince keenly.</p>

  <p>"Because she is penniless&mdash;a renegade"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Mat should endear her to the Protestants," smiled the Prince. "Well,
  well," said he "I think she is a woman to make a man happy. And now good
  night," he added, "we talk of nothing&mdash;like two old women."</p>

  <p>As soon as he was alone he laid himself down to sleep, having only removed
  his boots and his collar.</p>

  <p>Before William had put out the light he had looked to his weapons, fetched
  one of the pistols and placed it on the stool by his side.</p>

  <p>He knew that he was well guarded, but he knew also that Philip's
  emissaries did not ever relax their efforts to destroy him, and with the dark
  came the thought of his constant danger of assassination.</p>

  <p>The fate of Coligny had brought this danger more clearly to his mind.</p>

  <p>The Admiral had been murdered in full day, in his own home, shortly after
  a friendly visit from the King...if he had thus fallen, what chance had the
  rebel and the exile?</p>

  <p>William knew that his life hung by the slenderest thread of chance, and
  with each of his colleagues who fell he felt his own fate closing in upon him
  more relentlessly.</p>

  <p>He pulled his mantle over him as well as the bed covering, for the tent
  was chilly, and soon his senses drowsed and he fell asleep.</p>

  <p>He was roused by something wet and warm on his face, and then a shrill
  barking penetrated his ear.</p>

  <p>All at once he realized that his dog was licking his face in the intervals
  of barking.</p>

  <p>He sat up at once, putting out his hand to the creature, who whined in
  joyful excitement out of the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Danger, eh, friend?" whispered the Prince, now collected and alert.</p>

  <p>Hastily he fumbled his way to the chair and pulled on his boots, picked up
  his weapons, threw on his cloak and left the tent, the spaniel at his
  heels.</p>

  <p>It was still completely dark, for the moon had set.</p>

  <p>The Prince could not see what had happened; no sentries challenged him;
  the distant sounds of confusion grew louder.</p>

  <p>He found his way to the tent of Ste. Aldegonde, and as he reached it some
  one gripped his arm.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?"</p>

  <p>William recognized the voice of Philip Marna.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;the Prince"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"God be praised&mdash;they have surprised the camp, all are slain&mdash;I
  had two horses ready"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"A night surprise!&mdash;the Spaniards! And I slept!"</p>

  <p>He said nothing else; the sounds of the carnage grew louder about
  them&mdash;the army was being butchered as it slept.</p>

  <p>A few officers joined Ste. Aldegonde; one had a torch; they helped William
  to a horse; then he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Give me the dog."</p>

  <p>The little spaniel was lifted to his saddle; the others mounted; they
  could hear the Spanish musketry close behind them. They fled through the
  little village street and into the merciful darkness of the wet meadows.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-10"
     id="ch1-10"></a>X. &mdash; "OUT OF THE DEPTHS"</h2>

  <p class="first">A small party of soldiers were proceeding through the Low
  Countries towards the German frontier; four of their number carried a litter;
  the curtains of this were drawn back and a young man looked out with sad eyes
  on the passing landscape.</p>

  <p>His head was raised on a pile of cushions, his features were sunken, his
  eyes dim, the fingers were pale and wasted. The remains of one-time
  comeliness showed in the shape of his small head and the fallen contours of
  his countenance, in his bright waving hair.</p>

  <p>But disease and disappointment had marred his youth.</p>

  <p>Melancholy dulled the face that had once been so gay and fearless, as the
  fever of agitation and hope deferred had prostrated the restless young
  body.</p>

  <p>Such was Count Louis of Nassau, as he was carried from Mons to his home in
  Dillenburg.</p>

  <p>The news of St. Bartholomew had overthrown health 6 already feeble from
  sickness, the autumn fever of the Low Countries, and the swift following
  disaster whereby William's troops had been cut to pieces in a night surprise
  had completed the work; Count Louis was ill of grief and the shock of the
  tragedy that had befallen his friends in France.</p>

  <p>Louis had loved Coligny almost as a father and had himself been the star
  of the Huguenot party now destroyed.</p>

  <p>Unable to any longer hold Mons, he had surrendered the town to Don
  Frederic, having obtained good terms and being allowed to march out with the
  honours of war.</p>

  <p>His army, however, was disbanded, and he remained, like his brother, a
  defeated man, accompanied by only a small escort.</p>

  <p>Late in the afternoon the little procession halted at a village and the
  Count was carried to the best room in the inn.</p>

  <p>His brother had promised to meet him here; he sent anxiously to ascertain
  if the Prince had arrived. By his particular wish his couch had been drawn
  near the window and he lay on his side and looked out at the brilliant autumn
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>Here was no trace of war nor of desolation; the prospect was soothing to
  the sick soldier, yet filled him with a sense of regret for his own
  inactivity.</p>

  <p>The door was opened softly and the Prince of Orange entered, stooping his
  head to avoid the great entrance beam.</p>

  <p>There was silence; neither knew of any word to say in this moment.</p>

  <p>Louis put out his hand.</p>

  <p>The younger brother was the first to speak.</p>

  <p>"We have nothing but bitterness to discuss," he said. "The news of St.
  Bartholomew took my strength from me."</p>

  <p>"And I was unable to help you."</p>

  <p>"So Mons has gone. I think that the cause is lost." William looked at him
  intently.</p>

  <p>"And you were always so hopeful!" he said very gently.</p>

  <p>The sick man closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"That was while Coligny lived."</p>

  <p>"The King is mad, It seems," said William evasively he did not care to
  disturb his brother's direct judgments with his own subtleties.</p>

  <p>"I think," said Louis, "my heart broke when I heard of St.
  Bartholomew."</p>

  <p>William did not reply.</p>

  <p>With great tenderness he looked at his brother and pressed the feeble hand
  that lay in his.</p>

  <p>"I go to Dillenburg," added the Count, "but when I can stand on my feet I
  will return."</p>

  <p>"Something may yet be done," said the Prince. "Your news?" asked
  Louis.</p>

  <p>"My news?"</p>

  <p>"At least tell me what your position is."</p>

  <p>"I have failed completely," he said, and there was a slight tremor in his
  voice.</p>

  <p>The Count lay silent.</p>

  <p>"I have," continued the Prince, "accomplished nothing from the moment I
  crossed the Meuse four years ago. Nothing. I thought recently that the tide
  had turned&mdash;the capture of the Brill and your success encouraged me. I
  met much enthusiasm and help in the Netherlands"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And all are discouraged?"</p>

  <p>"More than that&mdash;they are terrified," replied the Prince quietly. "On
  all sides cities lose heart and fall away. One place after another has ceased
  to resist the Spaniards, one after another."</p>

  <p>"And we have no foothold left?"</p>

  <p>"I left a garrison in Poermond, but no sooner was I gone than they
  abandoned the town," said the Prince.</p>

  <p>"Is no one left who had any affection for the cause?" exclaimed Louis.</p>

  <p>"As I said, they are frightened, they see us powerless to protect them and
  they know what Alva&mdash;and what his master is."</p>

  <p>But Louis could not so easily accept William's attitude of
  resignation.</p>

  <p>"Only a short while since and all so hopeful!" he said.</p>

  <p>"But now there is a great change&mdash;even our warmest sympathisers are
  discouraged. Coligny is no more."</p>

  <p>"And it seems that we," returned Louis bitterly, "might as well have
  ceased to exist."</p>

  <p>William rose without speaking.</p>

  <p>"Do you see any hope?" persisted the Count, raising himself on one
  elbow.</p>

  <p>"One place after another has ceased resisting the Spanish "&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Haarlem and Alkmaar hold out?"</p>

  <p>"Those two, yes."</p>

  <p>"But have you no hopes of relieving either?"</p>

  <p>"With the few Netherland troops that I have I will endeavour to do
  something&mdash;I might get further assistance from Germany or even from
  England, but, as I said, I have no hopes."</p>

  <p>Louis sighed.</p>

  <p>"I fear that in the end I shall find myself alone, abandoned by every
  one," continued the Prince, "death takes the stout-hearted and the
  faint-hearted fall back."</p>

  <p>Louis clasped his hands and turned his distracted young face heavenwards
  with a look of despair and supplication.</p>

  <p>"Out of the depths have I cried unto thee!" he said, "out of the depths,
  oh Lord!"</p>

  <p>To William, God was very far away and as likely to listen to the
  supplications of Louis as to the prayers of Philip.</p>

  <p>Yet the strength and comfort of a narrow and defined faith appealed to
  William in this moment of his utter discomfiture and overthrow.</p>

  <p>"You think the Lord will help us, Louis?" he asked tenderly and with a
  certain wistfulness.</p>

  <p>The younger brother replied firmly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I do believe it&mdash;though I have my moments of despair, I do believe
  it."</p>

  <p>"Only not in Belgium," said William with a certain humour. "Here
  everything is lost."</p>

  <p>"Where then would you plant your flag?"</p>

  <p>"In the States of Holland."</p>

  <p>"You will go there?"</p>

  <p>"So I have determined&mdash;and you?"</p>

  <p>"I have decided nothing. I have been, indeed, too weary."</p>

  <p>"Poor Louis, you must stay awhile and help John at Dillenburg&mdash;there
  is much business there which you can do and he cannot."</p>

  <p>"For a while, for a little while, but I shall join you very soon."</p>

  <p>William returned to his side.</p>

  <p>"Louis," he said, smiling, "will you not marry soon?"</p>

  <p>"If your Grace will find me a good fortune," replied the Count.</p>

  <p>"I did not think of that."</p>

  <p>"Then let it be. I want money, but not a wife, William."</p>

  <p>"I thought of Mademoiselle de Bourbon."</p>

  <p>Louis smiled.</p>

  <p>"Are my fortunes in good trim for a penniless marriage, think you?"</p>

  <p>William lifted his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"How can I keep a wife," continued the Count, "when I have not two suits
  to my back?"</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle de Bourbon does not think of worldly things."</p>

  <p>"But I must."</p>

  <p>"Which means that you will not think of her?" smiled William.</p>

  <p>"In the way of marriage, no."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry."</p>

  <p>"Who am I," said Louis, "to think of marriage? Sooner should I choose my
  grave than my wife."</p>

  <p>"Our graves are near to our hands, I well believe," replied the Prince
  quietly, "but I did not speak of an ordinary woman but of one well prepared
  to face misfortune."</p>

  <p>"I think that of her also," said Louis, "but she is not for me, speak no
  more of it."</p>

  <p>Louis looked at him in silence a little while, then William rose.</p>

  <p>"What will you do?" asked Louis.</p>

  <p>"I shall go to Holland," replied the Prince, "and there maintain my cause,
  or find my sepulchre."</p>

  <h2><a name="pt2"
     id="pt2"></a>PART II. "THE NEW REPUBLIC"</h2>

  <p style="text-align:center">"<i>Sapis rejectus caput anguli.</i>"<br>
  <i>Orange Medal, 1574.</i></p>

  <h2>I. &mdash; THE KING</h2>

  <p class="first">A man sat before a great pile of papers neatly arranged on a
  black wood desk. The little cabinet about him was sombre and lit only by one
  high arched window, from which issued a pale light that fell coldly on the
  worker at the desk.</p>

  <p>He had an air of being overwhelmed by his task, from which he never lifted
  his eyes. With neat patient fingers he sorted and docketed the papers, read,
  selected and arranged the letters, now and then writing comments on the
  margins or putting a query to some sentence that he did not understand.</p>

  <p>He was a man of middle age, slight and of a remarkable appearance.</p>

  <p>The pallor of his thin face was emphasized by his scanty red-gold hair and
  beard, his eyes were slightly bloodshot and had a blank but steady
  expression, his mouth was large, his law underhung, while broken teeth added
  to his appearance of ill health. He wore a suit of dull black taffeta,
  buttoned tight with gold buttons across his narrow chest, and a stiff little
  collar of pleated lawn high under his ears.</p>

  <p>There was no ornament or object of beauty in the room, while above the
  desk hung an ebony crucifix on the white wall, and on the other side of the
  window was a picture of an emaciated saint, bleeding from many wounds,
  praying in the midst of a stormy landscape.</p>

  <p>The whole had the air of a monk's cell, cheerless, austere,
  melancholy.</p>

  <p>Such was the person and the occupation and the surrounding of Philip, King
  of Spain, ruler of the mightiest and wealthiest nation in the world.</p>

  <p>Presently he came upon a letter that interested him more than any he had
  so far perused.</p>

  <p>It was from the private secretary of the Duke of Alva, Viceroy in the
  Netherlands, to the King's chief secretary, and had been placed there for
  Philip's special attention.</p>

  <p>This passage was underlined:</p>

  <p>"The man who brought Coligny's head has offered to strike off the head of
  another who has injured Christianity as much as that scamp now in Hell."</p>

  <p>Philip reflected.</p>

  <p>Then he neatly wrote his commentary on the side margin of the
  parchment.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand this, because I do not know where Coligny's head was
  taken, or whose this other head is, although it seems to be that of Orange.
  Certainly they had shown little pluck in not killing him, for that would be
  the best remedy."</p>

  <p>As he finished writing the door was opened; the King looked up to see
  Cardinal Granvelle before him.</p>

  <p>Philip glanced at the little brass clock on the desk; he did not wish to
  be interrupted, but on seeing that the Cardinal was exact to the time he had
  appointed for him, he said nothing, but sprinkled sand over his newly written
  note and put it away.</p>

  <p>The Cardinal came forward with familiar ease; he appeared more worldly
  than the King, as he certainly was more graceful and urbane in appearance and
  manner.</p>

  <p>Philip eyed him gloomily, then sighed, resting his elbows on the desk and
  the tips of his long fingers together. The Cardinal seated himself; his rich
  ecclesiastical dress, his jewels and his handsome smiling face lightened the
  gloom of the cabinet.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty wished to speak of the Netherlands?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Philip had always relied on the Cardinal's knowledge and judgment of the
  rebellious heretic provinces, which he had ruled over the shoulder of
  Margaret of Parma in the early days.</p>

  <p>"I have to let you know," said the King, "that I have decided to recall
  Alva."</p>

  <p>The Cardinal bent his head.</p>

  <p>He was not surprised at the decision, but rather that it had come so soon
  and without his knowledge; in it he traced the influence of Antonio Perez,
  the King's secretary, and the Princess of Eboli, Ruz de Gonez's widow, who
  were fast becoming more powerful than himself or any other adviser, open or
  secret.</p>

  <p>"Alva has failed," added Philip with the ghastly calm with which he
  announced any news, good or bad.</p>

  <p>"Not through lack of zeal," said Granvelle.</p>

  <p>"He has failed," repeated the King as if the statement admitted of no
  qualification.</p>

  <p>"Who will succeed?" asked Granvelle with slight bitterness; he was
  thinking that he also had failed in the task of ruling the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>"Alva's letters," said Philip with the same calm which was not tinged by
  any disappointment or displeasure, "have for some time past spoken of nothing
  but failure."</p>

  <p>He looked at Granvelle out of his implacable tired blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"The tenth penny tax has failed&mdash;force has failed to raise
  money&mdash;the siege of Alkmaar has been raised, they have not yet taken
  Leiden."</p>

  <p>"And Orange lives."</p>

  <p>"And Orange lives," repeated the King impassively. "And while he lives the
  rebels will never be subdued."</p>

  <p>"He and his brother," said Granvelle, "should be treated like Turks."</p>

  <p>"Like Coligny," replied Philip.</p>

  <p>"Where is the man to do it? There lacks the Guise here."</p>

  <p>Philip drew a paper from one of the pigeon-holes of his desk and unfolded
  it.</p>

  <p>It contained a list of all the nobles of the Low Countries who had
  incurred, either by protest or rebellion, the King's displeasure.</p>

  <p>At the top was the name of William of Orange, beneath it that of his
  brother Louis.</p>

  <p>These were the only two names unmarked.</p>

  <p>The others had a cross in red ink at the side; the King handed the paper
  to Granvelle.</p>

  <p>"Only two left," he remarked.</p>

  <p>The Cardinal smiled; he knew that the red crosses meant that the dangerous
  enemy had in each case been disposed of, all, from Egmont to Montigny, by
  Philip's means.</p>

  <p>"But the most dangerous remains," said the Cardinal.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but it cannot be for long," replied Philip. "God will not for
  long permit such a monstrous rebel and heretic to live."</p>

  <p>He meant what he said; he could not believe that his prayers, his
  penances, his self-inflicted sufferings, his austere laborious life, the
  tremendous efforts that he had made to repress heresy in his dominions would
  go for nothing in the eyes of Heaven, or that such a lost soul as the Prince
  of Orange would long escape the judgment of God.</p>

  <p>In one just day of vengeance Coligny and his Huguenots had been swept away
  like a nest of hornets cast to the flames.</p>

  <p>Philip waited for such another day to dawn over the Netherlands&mdash;for
  such another act of vengeance to take place.</p>

  <p>He had ceased to expect Alva to accomplish this.</p>

  <p>The ceaseless cruelties, the rigorous legal enactments, the iron rule and
  the military successes of Alva were not sufficient in the eyes of his master.
  He had not crushed the heretics&mdash;he had not slain the Prince of
  Orange.</p>

  <p>On the contrary the great Rebel had established himself in Holland and
  Zeeland, held his Court at Delft and conducted a rival government to that of
  Brussels.</p>

  <p>Louis of Nassau had reopened negotiations with the French and English and
  was reported to be leading a new army to the support of his brother.
  Meanwhile the Regent was completely at the end of his resources, unable to
  raise money, burdened by private debts and overwhelmed by public hatred. And
  Philip, poisoned against him by Antonio Perez and Ana de Mendoza, took a hard
  view of his failure.</p>

  <p>"I had hoped better from the Duke of Alva," he said; this, from his
  reserve, was a notable expression of opinion.</p>

  <p>Granvelle saw that the Viceroy would return in disgrace; the priest was
  not the man to put in a word for the fallen and he had never loved the
  haughty Alva.</p>

  <p>He knew also the impossibility of altering any idea Philip might hold, and
  therefore was silent, though he thought in his heart that Alva had done all
  that could be done with an impossible task.</p>

  <p>"Who takes his place, sire?" he asked, and he added the name that had been
  most discussed in this connection. "Medina Coeli?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Philip slowly. "I think&mdash;the Grand Commander of
  Castile."</p>

  <p>He looked thoughtfully down at his papers.</p>

  <p>"The Netherlands must be subdued," he added, "and soon." He had used every
  weapon in his power and the rebels were still defiant.</p>

  <p>From the midst of their blood and tears, from the ashes of their towns and
  the ruins of their country-side, they faced him undauntedly; he had
  sacrificed in vain one of the richest portions of his realm; in vain he had
  stamped out industry, commerce, trade and prosperity in his effort to stamp
  out heresy.</p>

  <p>The provinces that had brought in a princely income to his father were now
  an immense drain on his almost bankrupt resources; but Philip did not care
  for this&mdash;gave no thought to it, any more than he had given any thought
  to the ruin he had inflicted on a large and flourishing portion of his
  kingdom by his recent expulsion of the Moriscos from Andalusia.</p>

  <p>Now his mind was on the Prince of Orange, whom he hated.</p>

  <p>"Your Eminence knows of a man suitable to the purpose? Of dealing with
  Orange as Coligny was dealt with?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The man I had in mind was one Gaspar D'Anastro, a Spaniard living in
  Antwerp," said Granvelle. "I believe for a reward he would find an
  instrument."</p>

  <p>"Give him," said Philip, "whatever he should ask, Eminence."</p>

  <p>"But since I spoke to your Majesty I have heard reports that have made my
  faith in the fellow slacken. It seems that he is more inspired by love of
  money than love of God."</p>

  <p>"That is no matter," remarked the King, "as long as the deed be done."</p>

  <p>"It shall be done, sire."</p>

  <p>"I believe it&mdash;yet the man seems to me to bear a life charmed by evil
  arts."</p>

  <p>"It is indeed difficult to come at him&mdash;several good Catholics have
  met their death before ever they could put foot in Delft."</p>

  <p>"God will reward them," said Philip.</p>

  <p>He took back his list from Granvelle and a slight gleam came into his
  passive eyes as he dwelt once more on the names of these, the flower of the
  Flemish nobility, who had fallen victims to the wrath of God and Philip.</p>

  <p>And the Prince of Orange would fall too, even the Devil could not always
  protect such a man, the King thought.</p>

  <p>He rose stiffly; it was the hour for his relaxation and his devotions.</p>

  <p>To-day these would be long, for his news had been bad</p>

  <p>The English had plundered several more of his silver ships, some money he
  had hoped to raise from the nobles of Castile had failed, several peculation
  on the part of his American Viceroys had come to light, the young Valois
  princes were again tampering with the accursed rebels.</p>

  <p>And everywhere was a lack of money.</p>

  <p>His brother, Don Juan of Austria, wrote frantic letters from Messina,
  entreating for means to follow up the victory of Lepanto, and threatening the
  loss of Tunis and La Goleta.</p>

  <p>Philip had no money to send; besides Don Juan also had his enemies who
  whispered that he tried to found an Empire for himself in the East.</p>

  <p>Granvelle rose and followed the King, who went into a little gallery which
  overlooked the garden; an autumn greyness was abroad and the sunless air was
  heavy.</p>

  <p>In a chair of leather with her feet on a gold cushion, sat the Queen,
  Philip's fourth wife, Anne of Austria, daughter of the Emperor.</p>

  <p>She was pretty in a gay vivacious style, but despite her smile and her
  quick movements she looked ill and unhappy.</p>

  <p>By her side stood a pretty child, who was winding a ball of white yarn
  from an ebony frame.</p>

  <p>Behind were the ladies, and here, as every where in the</p>

  <p>Escurial, were priests.</p>

  <p>Two walked up and down the gallery, the Queen's confessor sat with the
  waiting-women.</p>

  <p>The whole group had a sad and formal air; they seemed people who had
  reduced life to an empty ceremony.</p>

  <p>Philip looked kindly at his wife, but with far deeper affection at the
  child.</p>

  <p>She was his favourite daughter and bore a likeness to her mother, the late
  French Queen, the lovely Isabelle de Valois.</p>

  <p>Looking at her he sighed, thinking of her mother, whose death had been the
  deepest grief of his life, but he did not speak either to her or to the Queen
  and they remained dutifully silent.</p>

  <p>Instead he turned to the priests, those eyes, ears and tongues of the
  Escurial, and keepers of his conscience. These were all about him instantly
  and he walked up and down the gallery with them, the Cardinal at his
  side.</p>

  <p>The Queen's glance travelled after him; the child continued carding the
  yarn; she had already the austere manner of the Spanish Court.</p>

  <p>The duennas yawned behind their tortoise-shell fans</p>

  <p>It seemed as if nothing had ever happened or would ever happen to break
  the monotony of this ordered life.</p>

  <p>The Queen took her gaze from the figure of her husband and glanced at the
  clouds, then down into the formal garden.</p>

  <p>A clock struck.</p>

  <p>Anne rose and, giving a little signal to her ladies, left the gallery.</p>

  <p>It was the hour for prayers, which here were as regular as in any
  convent.</p>

  <p>The Queen's confessor followed her, the other priests came behind with the
  King.</p>

  <p>Among them was the one who had put Granvelle in touch with Gaspar
  D'Anastro, the Spanish merchant in Antwerp who had offered to find a man to
  assassinate the Prince of Orange.</p>

  <p>"But I have since discovered a fellow better adapted to your Majesty's
  purpose," said this priest. "A young captain from Arragon, full of a devout
  spirit and much loyalty."</p>

  <p>"Is he willing to undertake the business?" asked Philip.</p>

  <p>"Very eager, sire."</p>

  <p>"He knows the difficulties?"</p>

  <p>"I believe him well aware of them&mdash;and also that he would shrink from
  nothing in the service of your Majesty." The King did not appear wholly
  convinced.</p>

  <p>"Is he familiar with Flemish?" he asked, for he remembered that another
  emissary sent to murder William had failed to obtain an entry into Delft on
  account of his scant knowledge of the Flemish language and the strong Spanish
  accent which had betrayed him.</p>

  <p>"I believe he is proficient in it," put in Granvelle. "He was in the
  service of the Council when I was in Brussels."</p>

  <p>"He may try then," said the King.</p>

  <p>"Is he one of these penniless fellows?" he added, as they entered the
  palace.</p>

  <p>"I believe he can pay his own expenses," replied the priest. "But it would
  be worth your Majesty's while to give him a few ducats to further bind him to
  your service."</p>

  <p>But Philip, always hampered by poverty, was chary of his ducats.</p>

  <p>"I will promise him the cross of Santiago if he succeed," he answered.
  "And you, father, shall confess and absolve him before he starts."</p>

  <p>They reached the door of the sombre chapel, where the Queen was already on
  her knees.</p>

  <p>"Afterwards I myself will see this man," said Philip, on reflection that
  he had better judge of this creature of Granvelle's for himself.</p>

  <p>He was unsparing in his attention to these petty details.</p>

  <p>Dismissing all mundane business from his mind he entered the chapel and
  prostrated himself in abject adoration and supplication.</p>

  <p>In a passion of self-abasement he prayed for the subjection of the
  heretics and the peaceful reign of the true faith, and declared to God, in a
  fervour of self-sacrifice, that if he had not yet done sufficient penances,
  if he had not yet been sufficiently punished by the loss of his dear wife and
  the tragic end of the insane son on whom so many high hopes had been placed,
  he was willing to meekly endure any misfortune that might be laid on him as
  long as he might be permitted to be the means of rooting out the
  heretics.</p>

  <p>When the service was over, Philip rose from his devotions and went to
  interview the man who had undertaken to murder William of Orange.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-2"
     id="ch2-2"></a>II. &mdash; THE CARDINAL MUSES</h2>

  <p class="first">Cardinal Granvelle had apartments in the Escurial, the only
  chambers in the huge building furnished with taste and luxury, for even the
  Queen's rooms were dull and sombre.</p>

  <p>But the Burgundian priest had surrounded himself with something of the
  florid Flemish magnificence to which he had become used during his residence
  in the gorgeous capital of Brabant.</p>

  <p>Stamped leather and tapestry adorned the walls, the furniture was rich and
  costly, the books choice and numerous, though nothing could soften the
  stiffness of the narrow window which admitted a cold light that no internal
  splendour could counteract.</p>

  <p>Granvelle, a man of a soft and easy habit and of voluptuous tastes, did
  not like the Escurial, sometimes he confessed to himself that he did not like
  Spain.</p>

  <p>To-day after he had left the King and Queen in the gallery he retired to
  his cabinet in a spirit of profound dissatisfaction.</p>

  <p>Cardinal Granvelle was not a great man; his keen intelligence was
  continually irritated by this fact; he was not of noble birth and this
  pricked his pride; he was clever enough to see how far short his success fell
  of his ambitions, and this recognition of his own limit galled him
  unbearably. He was, after all, nothing but one of the many tools of Philip,
  and this position which entirely satisfied such as Antonio Perez or Alva was
  irksome to the Cardinal. He did not see how he could ever be other than what
  he was; his nearest approach to greatness had been when, as adviser to
  Margaret of Parma, he had been virtually Governor of the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>That chance he had lost through the persistent opposition of the great
  Flemish nobles who had finally obtained his recall.</p>

  <p>The Cardinal retained the bitterest hatred towards these men.</p>

  <p>Most of them were dead; Philip had fully avenged himself on the opponents
  of his favoured Minister&mdash;Egmont and Hoorne on the block, Adolphus of
  Nassau and Hoogstraaten on the battlefield&mdash;Berghen and Floris de
  Montmorency in a Spanish prison&mdash;Brederode of a broken heart&mdash;it
  might seem as if the Cardinal could be satisfied.</p>

  <p>But the Netherlands were not subdued&mdash;and William of Orange
  lived.</p>

  <p>And this Prince the Cardinal regarded with an intensity of hatred that
  nothing but death could satisfy.</p>

  <p>The Prince was ruined, discredited, humiliated, he had fallen from the
  position of one of the greatest grandees in the world to that of a penniless
  exile, but the Cardinal's hatred was not appeased nor his fear of his
  opponent at rest.</p>

  <p>He had long ago called William the most dangerous man in the Netherlands
  and his opinion had not altered&mdash;even though the revolted Provinces were
  now crushed under the rule of Alva and the Nassau family had ruined
  themselves in vain for the cause which they had espoused. It was an exceeding
  grievance with the Cardinal that William was still alive; there seemed to him
  something miraculous in the rebel's constant escape from peril, the manner in
  which he perpetually evaded the meshes of Philip's net of intrigue and secret
  plot, as there was something miraculous in the way he was, in face of his
  constant misfortunes, able to maintain his influence among the Netherlanders,
  to lead parties in France and England, to raise armies and collect money, to
  now even hold a court in Delft.</p>

  <p>It seemed to the Cardinal that if Philip could not destroy William,
  William would destroy Philip&mdash;</p>

  <p>"&mdash;like a rat gnawing at the foundations of a house," he said to
  himself.</p>

  <p>This thought, apart from his personal animosity to the man, affected him
  with a nobler grief&mdash;the Spanish Empire represented all that he believed
  in and admired and he was sincere in his passionate abhorrence of the heretic
  and the rebel.</p>

  <p>"If I were a younger man," his thoughts continued, "I would track down the
  cursed Prince myself."</p>

  <p>He rose impulsively and looked about him as if suddenly impatient of the
  confinement of the room.</p>

  <p>An atmosphere of trouble and tumult pervaded his soul and coloured his
  surroundings; he saw himself as a mere detail in a vortex of events utterly
  beyond his control. His rage and irritation became so acute that he cast
  about for some one on whom to vent his mood.</p>

  <p>The King was both the nearest and most satisfactory object on which to
  turn his venom; the Cardinal left his rich apartments for the dark and narrow
  chambers of Philip. As he passed up a steep cold staircase, he saw the Queen
  and her ladies cross the landing beneath him.</p>

  <p>They were on their way from the chapel and carried their books of
  prayer.</p>

  <p>Granvelle leant over the stair-rail and looked at them. He noticed, as he
  had never noticed before, the utter sadness of these women's faces.</p>

  <p>They also seemed discontented, though housed in a palace and protected by
  the greatest King in the world.</p>

  <p>Philip was kind and affectionate towards his wife, but the look on the
  young Austrian's face was that of cowed and sullen endurance; and Granvelle
  remembered the look on the frail features of the last Queen, a look of dumb
  terror&mdash;and on the face of Don Carlos, the King's only son&mdash;a look
  of fear and cunning&mdash;the stare and grin of insanity.</p>

  <p>There was no happiness in the Escurial&mdash;what then was the good of any
  of it, since all of them were discontented&mdash;so thought the Cardinal with
  a certain fierce impatience, for he was one who wished for material joy and
  pleasure as proof and sign of power and place.</p>

  <p>He was at once admitted, and Philip was as usual at his desk, writing one
  of his long despatches which were all penned by his own hand and compiled
  with the minutest care.</p>

  <p>He worked harder than any clerk in his employment and with the persistent
  application of the dull-witted.</p>

  <p>Granvelle despised him for this, yet he could not dissociate the man from
  the King and he always looked with a certain awe at this bent thin figure in
  the dull room&mdash;the man who could devote a nation to destruction by
  signing his name.</p>

  <p>"I write to England," Philip said in that tone of respect he always used
  when speaking to a churchman, and as he liked Granvelle his manner was
  friendly as well as courteous.</p>

  <p>He put down his pen and leant back in his chair; his eyes fixed Granvelle
  with a thoughtful look; his heavy lower lip was loose and flaccid, showing
  his broken teeth; the sagging skin showed the bony structure of the face.</p>

  <p>Cardinal Granvelle considered him; this was not his ideal of King; he
  recalled that graceful yet robust figure, comely and at ease&mdash;William of
  Orange.</p>

  <p>Had they met in private life William would not have considered Philip of
  sufficient capacity to be his humblest clerk; Granvelle knew this&mdash;he
  saw Philip as he was, mean of soul as of intelligence, but he was King of
  Spain.</p>

  <p>And Granvelle saw in Philip another thing besides the fact of kingship;
  the obstinacy of bigotry and prejudice; the Cardinal respected this because
  it had again and again defeated his purpose and his wish.</p>

  <p>His one satisfaction was that this quality in the King had also defeated
  the genius of the Prince of Orange. Philip pushed back his papers.</p>

  <p>"England meddles in the Netherlands," he said as if he stated a
  secret.</p>

  <p>"And France," answered the Cardinal gravely.</p>

  <p>"The party of the rebels is very powerful in France," returned Philip with
  an air of utter gloom. "I think they will set up the Duc D'Anjou as a
  pretender in my provinces."</p>

  <p>Granvelle did not wish to indulge the King in a minute discussion of
  events that were already argued threadbare; he knew to a nicety the exact
  position of the rebel Netherlanders in the politics of Europe.</p>

  <p>He came to the point which was always uppermost in his own mind.</p>

  <p>"It is the Prince of Orange, sire, who does you active mischief, both in
  England and France and the Empire."</p>

  <p>Philip seemed to have forgotten his recent idea to remove the Prince; now
  he blinked like a man pushed from darkness into light.</p>

  <p>"The Prince of Orange, yes," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"He and no other, sire. Remove him and you go at ease in Europe. As you
  know and have decided, sire."</p>

  <p>The King went off the main subject again.</p>

  <p>"There are others&mdash;I hear Louis of Nassau would marry the Abbess of
  Jouane. God protect us," he shivered and crossed himself.</p>

  <p>"There are no others," said the Cardinal firmly. "If the Prince were dead
  the rebellion would be dead and no more heard of these enemies of your
  Majesty in foreign states."</p>

  <p>"But Louis&mdash;John&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"None of those men matter&mdash;Count Louis is an adventurer, Count John a
  ruined, broken man, the rest are but the desperate knaves and fools that
  gather round any great villain."</p>

  <p>"The Prince of Orange is also ruined," said the King slowly. "He has
  nothing left of all his possessions, he is disgraced through his wife. I am
  assured that he has neither credit nor abiding place anywhere save in that
  pestilent town of Delft."</p>

  <p>"That is true, sire, but for all that your Majesty has no other enemy to
  reckon with save this one. I would not have you slacken in your endeavour to
  remove this ruffian."</p>

  <p>Philip frowned; it irritated him to be convinced of what his minister told
  him; it was hard to realize that one whom he regarded as his rebel subject
  could be so dangerous.</p>

  <p>"What power has this man?" he asked sullenly.</p>

  <p>The answer&mdash;"the quality of greatness," was on Granvelle's lips, but
  he checked the words and replied, "The devil supports a thrice perjured
  heretic."</p>

  <p>This satisfied Philip; he was used to fighting the devil; his eyes gleamed
  with a sombre enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"He must die, this William," he said; with his chin propped on his hand he
  considered the destruction of his enemy.</p>

  <p>"The heretic escapes all efforts of your Majesty's wrath," the Cardinal
  reminded him. "We have heard no more of D'Anastro's man."</p>

  <p>"I would he could have come to Spain," said Philip slowly. "As Egmont,
  Berghen and Floris Montmorency did."</p>

  <p>"He was always cunning."</p>

  <p>"If he had come to Madrid," continued the King, "he would have died."</p>

  <p>"But the others," said Philip more cheerfully, "I have crushed. They pay
  their debt in Hell now."</p>

  <p>"None of them mattered as the Prince matters, sire. And he escapes."</p>

  <p>"He too will go," returned the King with more energy than he had yet
  shown. "Do you doubt that? Do you think, Eminence, that the Almighty God will
  long tolerate such a foul heretic?"</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty should not rest day or night while this man lives."</p>

  <p>Philip fired at that.</p>

  <p>"Do I rest? Do I not labour incessantly? What have I not sacrificed in the
  cause of my God and my Realm? My eyes fail and my hand shakes and my head is
  weary, but I do not cease to labour."</p>

  <p>There was something of grandeur in his words, but as he spoke his face had
  a sudden resemblance to his murdered son and the Cardinal lowered his glance,
  almost imperceptibly blenching from what gazed at him from the eyes of
  Philip.</p>

  <p>"Is it for some sin of mine," continued the King, "that this man lives? I
  have done great penance for my sins. Have I not been punished? Did I not
  sacrifice my son?"</p>

  <p>He looked round the room as if searching for a third presence.</p>

  <p>"In His good time God will permit me to destroy this William."</p>

  <p>"It should be done swiftly," urged the Cardinal.</p>

  <p>"Have I not tried?" asked the King; his head fell forward a little, and
  his voice sounded hoarse and mournful.</p>

  <p>"The instruments were wrong and it is hard to trace one who wanders in
  disguise&mdash;he has also spies and friends everywhere, even in the cabinet
  of your Majesty&mdash;yet the deed can be done&mdash;especially now he is
  often in Delft."</p>

  <p>Philip groaned.</p>

  <p>"They all play me false, but I am not deceived."</p>

  <p>Granvelle knew that he was, and by those most in his confidence, such as
  Antonio Perez and the Princess of Eboli, yet the Cardinal winced, for Philip,
  believing in none, might at the slightest cause strike at all or any.</p>

  <p>"I at least have been a very faithful servant," he said quietly; and it
  was the truth.</p>

  <p>Philip was silent; either out of disbelief or because his thoughts had
  wandered.</p>

  <p>The Cardinal held his peace, there was a certain weariness upon his
  spirit; to be with Philip made him melancholy.</p>

  <p>"Alva," said the King suddenly out of the dusk. "I wonder if Alva is
  loyal?"</p>

  <p>Granvelle was utterly amazed; even though he knew Alva was under recall he
  would not have believed that even Philip's untiring suspicions would fall on
  Alva, that brilliant and merciless instrument of Spanish power and Romanist
  wrath.</p>

  <p>"The Duke of Alva," he ejaculated.</p>

  <p>"Why did he put on the tenth penny tax?" demanded the King. "It has
  greatly inflamed the Netherlanders."</p>

  <p>Granvelle could have laughed; he knew that the burden of the Viceroy's
  letters was one desperate demand for money which Philip never sent.</p>

  <p>"The Duke could not govern without gold," he said. "Money is
  necessary&mdash;Resquesens will be the same." Philip broke in fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Money. I have no money!" he cried, confessing with these words that all
  the boasted wealth of Spain was becoming exhausted in the effort to crush
  heresy in the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>"But you have power, sire," said the Cardinal.</p>

  <p>Philip's energy waned as quickly as it had flamed, he drooped in his chair
  like a sick man; his right hand reached out to the desk and grasped the quill
  with feeble haste.</p>

  <p>"Candles," he said harshly, "candles. I must finish my dispatch."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-3"
     id="ch2-3"></a>III. &mdash; NEWS FROM THE REBELS</h2>

  <p class="first">But Philip did not write long even after the candles D had
  been brought; for once his mind turned from the petty detail to the large
  issue; Granvelle's words rankled in his mind; he could not but admit that the
  news from the Netherlands was far from good and that the Prince of Orange was
  still a perpetual goad in his side.</p>

  <p>True, Haarlem had been reduced after a desperate resistance and laid in
  ashes, but Alkmaar had resisted successfully, Middleburg had fallen into the
  hands of the rebels, leaving them masters of the island of Zeeland and
  Walcheren and of the sea coast; on the sea itself they from the first had
  been, and still were, victorious.</p>

  <p>The Prince of Orange had established himself in Delft and had surrounded
  himself with the nucleus of an independent state; he was known to be in close
  communication with France and England, and to be skilfully playing one
  against the other; how far he had succeeded in obtaining help from either,
  Philip did not know, but he was informed by his spies that the Duc d'Alençon
  had promised countenance and help to Louis of Nassau, who was in France
  endeavouring to raise troops with which to relieve Leiden, a city which stood
  for the Prince and had been long hardly pressed by the Spaniards.</p>

  <p>Philip sighed.</p>

  <p>He almost regretted Alva; Resquesens, the new Governor, was as poor a
  statesman and not so good a general, and his policy, less ferocious and
  bloodthirsty than that of his predecessor, had not proved any more successful
  in subduing the rebel heretics; how could the King forgive him the defeat of
  his Armada at Romerswael, which had left the rebels with the supremacy of the
  sea?</p>

  <p>If Alva had failed and Resquesens had failed, who was to succeed!</p>

  <p>Philip bit his quill and blinked at the candle flame. The door opened
  gently and a woman entered with a light yet decided step.</p>

  <p>She wore a dark green gown and a black lace mantilla; her hair was dark
  and arranged in heavy masses either side of her sallow face, which was
  aquiline in feature and not beautiful save in the large and intelligent
  eyes.</p>

  <p>She looked at Philip with something of the same expression with which
  Granvelle had looked at him&mdash;a mingling of disdain for the man and awe
  for the King.</p>

  <p>She was Ana D'Eboli, widow of his Minister, for a long while his adviser
  and his lover, but in neither respect faithful to him, for Antonio Perez held
  what she had of heart and loyalty; no one deceived Philip more than these two
  to whom he extended that confidence of which he was usually so niggardly; the
  Princess D'Eboli believed that he trusted her completely, and so was,
  perhaps, overconfident in her bearing towards the King, but so far her
  domination and her fascination held him; she was absolutely the most
  brilliant person, the finest in wit and judgment, of any who had come in
  contact with him.</p>

  <p>"Cardinal Granvelle has been with you," she said; she seated herself
  opposite the King; her presence filled the meagre chamber with a certain
  magnificence, her voice was caressing; but the disdain of the clever woman
  for the dull man was never wholly hidden.</p>

  <p>"Granvelle worries me," said Philip; before Ana D'Eboli he permitted
  himself a little show of irritation; though long habit had made his impassive
  manner hardly capable of displaying any emotion.</p>

  <p>"I believe that I have come to worry you also, sire," said the
  Princess.</p>

  <p>"You have news?" The King knew that she had her own secret channels of
  information and that her spies were often quicker than his own; what he did
  not know was her intrigue with Antonio Perez and that the advancement of this
  man was the thread that held together all her actions; at present she
  intended to ruin the Governor of the Netherlands, who was the political enemy
  of Perez.</p>

  <p>"I have news that Louis of Nassau is marching on Maastricht," she
  answered.</p>

  <p>Philip sighed as was his habit to do when other men would have cursed;
  that he was profoundly agitated showed from his shaking hands as he clutched
  the arms of his chair.</p>

  <p>"Which means raising the siege of Leiden," added Ana D'Eboli gently.</p>

  <p>"God will protect us, God will deliver us," muttered the King.</p>

  <p>"Not while Resquesens is your Majesty's Governor in the Netherlands."</p>

  <p>The King shook his head dismally.</p>

  <p>"There is no one else," he said.</p>

  <p>But Ana D'Eboli had her own schemes; not only did she wish to disgrace
  Resquesens by a recall, but she wished to ruin another man by sending him to
  undertake the impossible and heart-breaking task of governing the
  Netherlands.</p>

  <p>"Don John has been so successful with the Turks, surely he can crush the
  heretics," she replied.</p>

  <p>The King stroked his chin.</p>

  <p>"Don John," he said thoughtfully; he did not love his half brother, whose
  glorious achievements had cast so much splendour on his reign, for it was not
  in him to love youth and gaiety in a man; certainly he had raised Don John up
  but he was equally prepared to cast him down and there was an ingenuity about
  the suggestion of the Princess that pleased him; Resquesens was obviously
  incapable, Don John was clamouring for employment and possibly his brilliant
  gifts might avail where even Alva had failed.</p>

  <p>"Do you think," he added cautiously, "that Don John is a match for the
  Prince of Orange?"</p>

  <p>"No man is a match for that devil," answered the Princess decisively.</p>

  <p>"But some day," said the King patiently, "God will permit that a knife or
  a bullet reach his heart."</p>

  <p>"What of Gaspar D'Anastro's man?"</p>

  <p>"I have heard nothing more."</p>

  <p>The King turned his mind from this disagreeable subject.</p>

  <p>"What troops has Louis of Nassau?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He has engaged the escort that was taking the Duc D'Anjou to
  Poland&mdash;other troops raised in France and German mercenaries."</p>

  <p>"How will he pay these troops?" asked Philip bitterly.</p>

  <p>Ana D'Eboli shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"How have the Nassau family paid so far? They are ruined men&mdash;and yet
  they can always raise money&mdash;men&mdash;This should be the last
  time."</p>

  <p>The King looked at her and a light blazed in his dull eyes.</p>

  <p>"Whether or no it be the last time, rest assured that they will not
  succeed in their rebellion, even if I have to raze to the ground every town
  in the Netherlands."</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty must be careful that the rebels do not raze the towns
  themselves&mdash;Count Louis, as I said, advances on Maastricht."</p>

  <p>A light foam gathered on the King's lips and he stared fixedly in front of
  him.</p>

  <p>His enemy seemed to loom monstrous before him, casting a dark shadow over
  his might and his power; menacing even the existence of his Empire; he saw
  William of Orange as evil incarnate before whom every weapon was powerless,
  and the rebellion of which he was the life and soul as a plague spot, which,
  spreading, would in time ruin all his kingdoms.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if the rebels had nothing and he had everything; yet in truth
  he was cruelly hampered: embarrassed for money, surrounded by a corrupt Court
  and governing vast dominions by means of a network of minute and tortuous
  intrigue, watched with jealousy and suspicion by both England and France,
  each of whom were ready and eager to foment trouble in his realms, Philip of
  Spain was by no means completely master of his vast kingdom.</p>

  <p>Still the odds were greatly on his side, and it remained a marvel to even
  his dull intelligence that the rebels could so long hold aloft the flag of
  their independence.</p>

  <p>Ana D'Eboli was quick to see this feeling in him and to play upon it for
  her own purpose.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty's credit is sufficiently shaken already in the Netherlands,"
  she said, "by the manner in which the Prince of Orange has been able to
  establish himself in Holland and Zeeland&mdash;this expedition of Count Louis
  must be crushed."</p>

  <p>"It shall be."</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty must see to it&mdash;under pain of your displeasure
  Resquesens must crush Count Louis&mdash;for on him are staked the hopes of
  all the rebels."</p>

  <p>"Not on him, but on William of Orange," said Philip with a rare flash of
  insight. "Resquesens must do his utmost&mdash;can I do more than command him
  to do that?"</p>

  <p>Ana D'Eboli saw that she had sufficiently pressed her point and deftly
  changed the subject.</p>

  <p>"The ultimate end is not in doubt," she said.</p>

  <p>"Nor the ultimate punishment," said the King grimly. Ana D'Eboli rose.</p>

  <p>Even to her there was an oppression in the air of the King's cabinet; a
  terrible sense of dullness and gloom in the presence of the King.</p>

  <p>She looked out of the narrow pointed window on to the unfinished gardens,
  cold in the still light of the February afternoon.</p>

  <p>Like Granvelle had thought&mdash;so she thought&mdash;'what is the use of
  all of it since none of us are happy?</p>

  <p>She leant her head against the mullions and the chilly gleam of the hidden
  sun was full on her sallow face.</p>

  <p>At that moment the Princess D'Eboli felt as hungry for happiness as had
  ever Rénée le Meuny or any poor Netherland exile.</p>

  <p>Yet why?</p>

  <p>She asked herself the question with disdain&mdash;she had security, power,
  and even love, yet somehow her crooked life was not pleasing, even to
  herself; the close air of the Escurial seemed crowded with the presence of
  murdered men.</p>

  <p>Ana. D'Eboli had had no pity for any of them; yet the thought of them
  oppressed her; she could not, either, soon forget those two who had died so
  near together&mdash;Isabelle de Valois and Don Carlos; to the first she had
  been indifferent, the second she had disliked&mdash;yet she did not care to
  reflect upon the sudden end of either Queen or Prince&mdash;Isabelle's fallen
  loveliness was as unpleasant to recall as the mad hideousness of the
  Prince.</p>

  <p>She glanced, half furtively, at Philip.</p>

  <p>He sat with his chin resting on his chest; his jaw had dropped a little
  and his eyes were half closed.</p>

  <p>He looked both like his father, the great Emperor, in those last days of
  insane penitence, and his imbecile son whom he had been forced to
  destroy.</p>

  <p>Ana D'Eboli did not care to look at him, and crept from the room.</p>

  <p>In the first chamber through which she had to pass, the Queen and several
  of her women were gathered before a fire of pine logs which filled the musty
  chamber with a pleasant odour.</p>

  <p>Anne of Austria was seated in a deep chair; her attire, though splendid in
  itself, was disordered, her ruff open round her full throat, threads of
  tumbled fair hair waved across a candid brow.</p>

  <p>She had something of an air of nobility, and seemed as if she might have
  been, under some circumstances, happy and gay.</p>

  <p>Ana D'Eboli came up behind her chair; the powerful favourite was familiar
  and even haughty with the foreign Queen; yet Philip loved Anne of Austria,
  though not to the extent with which he had loved Isabelle de Valois.</p>

  <p>The Queen looked up with a clear glance from her grey-blue eyes.</p>

  <p>She knew perfectly well the position and power of Ana D'Eboli and was not
  afraid of either; she had the nerve and spirit that her predecessor had
  lacked and she was the Emperor's daughter; besides being of the same blood as
  Philip and having something of his craft:</p>

  <p>"With what gaieties shall we pass the time?" she asked.</p>

  <p>She laughed and her laugh was hard.</p>

  <p>"No one speaks of anything but this rebellion in the Netherlands," she
  added with malice, for she knew perfectly well that Ana D'Eboli had been with
  the King and conferring with him on this subject.</p>

  <p>"It is something to talk of," said the Princess calmly. "Louis of Nassau
  has raised a large mercenary army and Count John finds the money."</p>

  <p>The Queen made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"It is astonishing how Count John continues to find money," she
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"His pocket is deep but it has a bottom," returned the Princess.</p>

  <p>Anne of Austria smiled slowly.</p>

  <p>"You may say the same of the coffers of Spain," she said.</p>

  <p>"No," answered the Princess. "I do not think you can say that there is a
  limit to the resources of Spain, madam."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said the Queen easily. "Count Louis is a gallant knight," she
  added.</p>

  <p>The Spanish ladies glanced at each other; the bold speaking of their
  mistress filled them with mingled delight and awe; some crossed themselves
  when they heard her speak of the heretic rebel.</p>

  <p>"A gallant knight your Majesty thinks?" asked the Princess with great
  bitterness and meaning in her tone.</p>

  <p>Anne of Austria looked at her with complete composure and contempt
  scarcely concealed.</p>

  <p>"I think," she said, "a gallant knight&mdash;such as one might
  admire&mdash;and love."</p>

  <p>Again a little movement went through the waiting-women.</p>

  <p>"And love?" echoed the Princess.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" smiled the Queen. "Young,&mdash;audacious, leader of a
  desperate cause&mdash;such have always evoked love, madam."</p>

  <p>"Among the light and frivolous, yes," returned the Princess. "They say
  that this Nassau is beloved by the renegade Abbess of Jouane&mdash;your
  Majesty has heard that?"</p>

  <p>"She will marry some one&mdash;why not Louis of Nassau?" said the
  Queen.</p>

  <p>"Certainly&mdash;a fitting match, the heretic and the nun," answered the
  Princess drily.</p>

  <p>Anne of Austria slightly lifted her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I hear she also is beautiful&mdash;and young," she said, "therefore no
  doubt it is a fitting match."</p>

  <p>"It is your Majesty's pleasure to be tolerant," remarked Ana D'Eboli
  sarcastically.</p>

  <p>The Queen's shapely hand toyed with a little ornament of rubies.</p>

  <p>"I was not trained in harshness," she replied quietly. "I can admire these
  rebel heretics when they are brave."</p>

  <p>She looked into the logs and her face softened.</p>

  <p>"And they are brave," she added. "I have heard tales&mdash;" she paused
  and smiled, as if at inner thoughts, "and the Nassau Princes&mdash;are they
  not fearless as lions?"</p>

  <p>"The Devil doubtless gives them confidence," said Ana D'Eboli.</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;the Devil&mdash;" repeated the Queen in a curious tone, still
  gazing into the fire.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty perhaps approves of the Devil?" asked the Princess.</p>

  <p>Anne of Austria laughed with a superb indifference. "Sometimes," she
  answered.</p>

  <p>The Princess's dark face flushed, for there was a certain insolence in the
  reply that seemed levelled at her, and the waiting-women shuddered at the
  royal blasphemy.</p>

  <p>But the Queen remained unconcerned; fair she looked in the dull glow of
  the pine fire.</p>

  <p>The creaking of a board caused the two women to lock round.</p>

  <p>From behind the tall screen of stamped leather came the thin figure of the
  King.</p>

  <p>In a moment the waiting-women were as if lifeless in their stiff attitudes
  of respect.</p>

  <p>The Queen retained her indifferent position and looked at her husband with
  weary eyes; Ana D'Eboli withdrew into the vast shadows that filled the tall
  chamber; she had seen that Philip's first glance had turned to his wife and
  she could afford to sometimes remain in the background; besides she cared so
  little for Philip that it cost her no pang of jealousy to see his attention
  drawn to another woman.</p>

  <p>"What do you muse about, madam?" asked Philip.</p>

  <p>He put out his cold hand and touched her sleeve.</p>

  <p>"On the glory of your Empire, sire, and the folly of those who rise in
  rebellion against you," said the Queen quietly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-4"
     id="ch2-4"></a>IV. &mdash; DELFT</h2>

  <p class="first">The same day that Philip and Ana D'Eboli were discussing the
  expedition of Louis of Nassau, his brother was writing him from Delft a
  letter full of encouragement and hope.</p>

  <p>To William of Orange this invasion of the Netherlands was of signal
  importance.</p>

  <p>He hoped with those troops the now independent states of Holland and
  Zeeland could supply him, to effect a juncture with Count Louis that would
  effectually cut off and check the Royalist troops and draw them away from the
  siege of Leiden&mdash;he felt justified in contemplating a success more
  signal in its effects and more important in its results than even the capture
  of Brill.</p>

  <p>As usual he had but little ground for these hopes, which depended entirely
  on himself and his family, and, also as usual, the difficulties were immense,
  and to any but a Nassau would have appeared stupendous. Louis' troops were
  all mercenaries whose services depended on their pay, and that pay depended
  on the personal efforts of William and Ma two brothers; a rising in the
  Provinces still under Resquesens was hardly to be expected, as these were
  still too firmly held in bondage by the Spanish, and the tiny Republic which
  William had founded was straining her utmost to maintain herself.</p>

  <p>Still the Prince had found his foothold&mdash;he could call Delft his home
  and Holland his Kingdom&mdash;"Here I stay to conquer or to find my grave,"
  he had said.</p>

  <p>He was surrounded by men who were faithful to him, who believed in him,
  who were eager to carry out his commands, yet his soul was lonely for he had
  not a single confidant, save his brothers, who either fully understood his
  aims or the means by which he hoped to achieve them, no one on whose capacity
  and judgment he could rely.</p>

  <p>Even Ste. Aldegonde had weakened through the rigours of a Spanish prison
  and wrote, sometimes despairing, counsels tinged by the gloom of his
  confinement.</p>

  <p>Even he, once most enthusiastic of supporters, seemed to think William's
  task hopeless; Philip could not be with impunity defied; would it not be
  better to submit and trust to the King's mercy?</p>

  <p>There remained only John and Louis. John, full of patience and trust, and
  Louis, as energetic and unflinching as the Prince himself.</p>

  <p>These two were the Prince's great reliance&mdash;but there were two others
  equally eager and single-hearted in his cause, the youngest brother, Henry,
  and Duke Christopher, the son of the Elector Palatine.</p>

  <p>Both these were now with Count Louis.</p>

  <p>William recalled them as he sealed his letter to his brother.</p>

  <p>And thinking of them he remembered his marriage day in Leipsic and how he
  and these young men had sat round in a dark room while the alchemist's
  assistant raised spirits by means of his magic table.</p>

  <p>William recalled also how the seer had described a picture of red and
  black&mdash;a bloody fight beneath a sombre sky and men falling in the press
  never to rise again till the Judgment Day.</p>

  <p>Aye, a violent death had the wise man predicted for all of them&mdash;it
  seemed likely enough.</p>

  <p>Yet the man was only a charlatan earning his living as best he
  could&mdash;there was little need to think of his wild prophecies.</p>

  <p>William's mind dwelt on that wedding day&mdash;no prophecy of that
  marriage's ending could have been wilder than the truth.</p>

  <p>With what splendour had that marriage, barren in all save misery, been
  solemnized!</p>

  <p>What would bride or bridegroom have said to one who could have shown them
  a mirror of the future? Ruin and exile for him, and for her dishonour and
  insanity.</p>

  <p>William bent his head as he thought of that marriage.</p>

  <p>The desertion of his wife and her faithlessness had been the last stab to
  the hunted and homeless Prince.</p>

  <p>His present loneliness was to be traced to that mistaken marriage.</p>

  <p>His children were with his brother, Count John, for he had nothing to
  offer them and he passed his life in the company of soldiers and servants; he
  often thought of his first wife, Anne of Egmont, and how pleasant she had
  made his days&mdash;he greatly lacked the sweet companionship of love and
  sympathy.</p>

  <p>Restlessly he wandered up and down the room, which was that of a
  middle-class burgher.</p>

  <p>There could not well be a greater contrast than between this and the
  Prince's palace in Brussels, yet compared with what his surroundings had been
  since his exile, it was luxury.</p>

  <p>The Prince noticed neither the comfort nor the plainness; he had long
  ceased to take heed of what was about him.</p>

  <p>His clothes now were of coarse cloth, his falling band of plain linen, his
  sword of the simplest workmanship, his shoes of rough leather; yet the innate
  grace of his figure and bearing was in no way affected by these things.</p>

  <p>Presently he seated himself at his table by the window.</p>

  <p>The fine profile was worn and haggard, all savour of youthfulness had
  gone, though the Prince was no more than in the prime of life.</p>

  <p>All that was left of the gay cavalier and brilliant grandee 8 were the
  poise and manner of one equally at home with King and peasant, the gracious
  composure and the self-possessed diplomat.</p>

  <p>He knew that he was surrounded by continual danger, that Philip's spies
  and assassins were continually on his track and that it could only be a
  question of time before his name was added to that of Egmont and Hoorne and
  those others on that list in the Escurial who had already satisfied the wrath
  of Spain. He could only hope that first a little time might be allowed him in
  which to do some of the work which he had before him and to forward the cause
  on which he had set his very heart.</p>

  <p>This work was slow and at times distasteful; his present intrigues with
  the French Court were not pleasant to him; it could not be agreeable to the
  great champion of the Reformed Faith to deal with the King who had sanctioned
  Saint Bartholomew.</p>

  <p>But William knew that if he stopped to use only clean tools he would never
  accomplish anything, and one of his favourite schemes was to pit France
  against Spain and secure, for the struggling little states he had rescued
  from Philip, the powerful protection of one of the Princes of the House of
  Valois.</p>

  <p>So far he, and Louis as his agent, had succeeded not only in obtaining
  constant expressions of repentance for the infamous massacre from the Court
  of France, but also its formal assurances that henceforth it would not molest
  those of the Reformed Religion in its dominion and would aid to the utmost
  the cause of the United Provinces.</p>

  <p>To such concessions was France driven by internal disorders, hatred of
  Spain and desire of the friendship of England and the hand of England's Queen
  for François de Valois.</p>

  <p>Louis had raised soldiers there, had spoken and written fearlessly and
  boldly to King and Dowager, had a large party on his side which his
  confidence and ability made daily larger-but William was not one to be lulled
  by this appearance of success. His position was by no means brilliant; even
  Zeeland and Holland were not completely his; though Middleburg had fallen,
  Zeeland was divided by the loss of Haarlem and the siege of Leiden; the
  Estates were difficult and often irritating on the question of supplies, and
  though the patriots held the sea successfully, the land forces were mostly
  mercenary and therefore not to be depended on if the money raised now with
  such difficulty should fail.</p>

  <p>So it was that William's hopes rested mostly on France; the Duke d'Alençon
  and the King of Poland had sworn assistance; the Prince knew both to be
  puppets of circumstance, but he believed he might pull their strings to his
  own purpose.</p>

  <p>Putting his letter to Louis in his pocket he left the room and the house
  and stepped out on to the brick pathway that ran beside the canal; this was
  planted with lime trees, whose leafless boughs cast a pleasant tracing of
  shade, and were reflected in the quiet waters of the canal.</p>

  <p>A small boat was moored in front of the steps that led from the causeway
  to the water in front of the Prince's house, and in this boat were seated two
  boys who were busily engaged in mending a kite.</p>

  <p>The door of the house opposite stood open and near the step sat a woman
  knitting; by her knee stood a child engaged in unravelling her ball of
  wool.</p>

  <p>The red tiled roofs were covered with pigeons that circled high and
  low.</p>

  <p>Over all was the clear cold sky of early spring and the light of pale
  sunshine.</p>

  <p>Standing here, by the quiet canal, watching the children at their play and
  the woman at her work it might almost seem as if it was a time of peace.</p>

  <p>To William it appeared as a prophecy of what might yet be in the years to
  come&mdash;when all the land would be as this spot was now by chance; he
  thought of the time when men would go to and fro and not wonder at seeing
  peace about them, but accept it naturally and look upon war and violence as
  some dreadful dream&mdash;a thing to be imagined and read of, not to be
  experienced.</p>

  <p>Not for him those days&mdash;yet it was pleasant to think that by his
  means and the means of those whom he inspired they might be at some distant
  date achieved.</p>

  <p>Pleasant indeed to think that the children of their children might come to
  remember and bless the name of William of Orange as that of one who had
  secured to them the priceless gift of liberty.</p>

  <p>The Prince turned towards the fortifications of the city.</p>

  <p>He walked quickly, and passed over low bridges, under the gleaming windows
  of houses and before Gothic churches now spoiled of their original splendours
  and changed from their original uses; here and there an early tree was
  faintly veiled in green, here and there a hyacinth showed in a garden patch,
  or a few snowdrops pushed up through the dark earth.</p>

  <p>There were very few people abroad, and those few, harmless folk, women,
  children, old men; all the strong manhood was at the war.</p>

  <p>William came to the bridge that separated the great canal leading to
  Rotterdam from the smaller canal running through the city.</p>

  <p>Here he paused and leaning on the low brick parapet gazed on the flat
  prospect of land and water already beginning to be blended by the thin mists
  of evening.</p>

  <p>The paleness of the sky, reflected in the water, became silver, and on
  this gloomy surface of the canal rested the dark shape of boats, and by the
  low straight banks grew the straight dark spikes of reeds and grass.</p>

  <p>A strong wind blew abroad over the land, the Prince felt it on his face
  like the touch of a cold hand.</p>

  <p>As he gazed across the land which the inhabitants had rescued with such
  desperate courage from the sea and from the oppressor, the spread of cloud
  grew larger and rapidly enveloped the sweep of open sky, and the current of
  the wind rose higher like the swell of water rising against the land.</p>

  <p>Still the Prince stood motionless on the bridge, a solitary figure fast
  being absorbed into the encroaching darkness which was hiding from his gaze
  the land that he loved, for it was the land on which he had planted his final
  standard, the spot of ground where he would maintain himself or die.</p>

  <p>While he was deep in reverie a messenger from his house came hurrying
  through the gloomy streets.</p>

  <p>He brought dispatches from Louis.</p>

  <p>William read them by the light of the lantern his valet carried.</p>

  <p>They were but a few lines that told that Louis was already marching into
  the heart of the enemy and hoped soon to effect a juncture with William
  between Delft and Rotterdam.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-5"
     id="ch2-5"></a>V. &mdash; COUNT LOUIS</h2>

  <p class="first">The winds blew round the Castle of Fauquemont, howled
  through the ruined portion and shook the doors and windows and lifted the
  tapestry in those rooms that were still habitable.</p>

  <p>In one of these, which once had been a magnificent apartment, but had been
  despoiled when the castle had been ruined, the younger brothers of William of
  Orange sat at Council with the few dependable officers of their mercenary
  force which had advanced thus far into the enemy's country and was now
  encamped on the Meuse, in the Duchy of Limburg a few miles from Maastricht,
  the first objective of the expedition, the second and principal being the
  junction with William and the forces of the Estates at Bommel in Holland.</p>

  <p>The other officers, French and Dutch, sat on such heavy chairs of state as
  the pillagers had left; on a great black table stood candles thrust into the
  necks of bottles and a stamp, for none of these Princes travelled with
  camp.</p>

  <p>A fire of such logs as could be found near by burnt in the wide grate and
  gave a fugitive heat to a portion of the great cold chamber, and cast a
  flickering and sombre light on three young men seated by the black bed.</p>

  <p>Of these Count Louis was by far the most remarkable, though all had in
  common a singular air of serene ardour, of bright youth and enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>The Nassau brothers were alike in the elegance of their appearance, in
  their alert manner, but Louis had an added charm of face and deportment, an
  air of dignity and command that made him well fitted to be the leader of a
  noble and romantic cause.</p>

  <p>He was now in the prime of life, his countenance, no longer so soft as it
  had been in the days of his extravagant youth, was eminently pleasing, his
  steady eyes were full of light and fire and the curls of his brown locks fell
  either side a brow still smooth.</p>

  <p>He wore his armour, black damascened with gold, over which was knotted a
  scarf of orange silk, a high collar of white linen was buttoned under his
  chin; he was leaning slightly forward, his left hand on his hip.</p>

  <p>His brother was darker and taller; he had the Nassau gaiety and had
  already proved himself to have the Nassau boldness and discretion; he wore a
  leathern coat and breeches marked by the pressure of his mail.</p>

  <p>The Elector's son was a youth of a melancholy deportment but of steadfast
  eyes and mouth; he spoke little and seemed to greatly lean on the words of
  Count Louis; he was large and comely and was partially armed in heavy
  plate.</p>

  <p>Louis held a little parchment on which was roughly drawn a map of the
  Meuse and the fortifications of the enemy, who was encamped on the opposite
  bank of the river.</p>

  <p>He was explaining this to the assembled officers, who listened to him in a
  silence that was something gloomy.</p>

  <p>Disaster had already marked the progress of the little army; they had been
  unable to cross the Meuse owing to the ice, which, insufficient to bear the
  passage of troops, had yet been sufficient to prevent the use of boats, more
  than a thousand of the mercenaries had deserted at the first hint of failure
  and Mendoza had inflicted on them a night surprise which had cost them seven
  hundred men.</p>

  <p>In view of these facts the general opinion was that it was now necessary
  to abandon the project of taking Maastricht, which had been reinforced by the
  arrival of Braccamonte and Mondrogan with several companies of foot and
  horse.</p>

  <p>"But we must," said Louis with great earnestness and firmness, "cross the
  Meuse and effect a juncture with the Prince in Holland else this expedition
  from which so much is hoped will prove fruitless."</p>

  <p>They did not contradict; the whole project had been at best but a
  desperate enterprise and they were all soldiers of fortune.</p>

  <p>"Besides," continued the young General, "the men become impatient, without
  some action one cannot hold them long satisfied."</p>

  <p>It was not his policy to admit his financial position, even to his
  officers, but the truth was that his troops were on the verge of mutiny for
  lack of pay and he had nothing but promises to give them.</p>

  <p>"Therefore," said Duke Christopher with a little smile, "since we cannot
  go backwards, we must go forward."</p>

  <p>"Therefore," answered the Count, "I propose to move down the river to this
  point," he indicated it on the map, "and there to cross and give battle to
  the Spaniards. Mark me, gentlemen, if we are successful we shall go far to
  drive these devils out of the country."</p>

  <p>To those listening to him there seemed nothing wild in these words, for
  they were men who lived on hope in the midst of desperate
  circumstances&mdash;and they knew that Count Louis had already accomplished
  much out of nothing and had re-arisen again and again from defeat to further
  endeavour.</p>

  <p>As for the Count he believed what he said; even William bad declared that
  a decisive victory now and a successful juncture with his own troops would
  suffice to drive the Spaniards from Holland and Zeeland.</p>

  <p>And in his heart Louis had still the hope of taking</p>

  <p>Maastricht, despite Mondrogan and Braccamonte and their foot and
  horse.</p>

  <p>Rising he went to the table and by the light of the guttering candles
  pointed out, on his rude map, the course he proposed to follow, along the
  right bank of the Meuse, between that river and the Rhine, towards
  Nemiuegen.</p>

  <p>"There," he said, "we can cross the river and give battle to the forces of
  D'Avila. If we can achieve a victory now," he added, "half the Provinces will
  rise against Resquesens."</p>

  <p>"If we turn back?" suggested one of the captains quietly.</p>

  <p>"We leave the Hollanders to despair," replied Louis briefly.</p>

  <p>"But we shall not turn back," said Count Henry, looking at his
  brother.</p>

  <p>"No," said Louis.</p>

  <p>There was a little silence.</p>

  <p>Each man was thinking of what was likely to be the result of this venture,
  already attended by misfortune and becoming daily more doubtful in
  character.</p>

  <p>It was no ordinary combat in which they proposed to engage but a battle in
  which they must conquer or most certainly fall victims to the wrath of the
  victors.</p>

  <p>In these fierce struggles of mutual hate there was never any pity for the
  vanquished; and the little force of Louis was advancing into the enemy
  country with all means of escape closed behind it&mdash;and the enemy was
  skilful, powerful and ruthless.</p>

  <p>The Count looked from one to another of his captains and, smiling,
  dismissed them.</p>

  <p>Count Henry and Duke Christopher alone remained.</p>

  <p>As the door closed on the last of the officers, another figure, hitherto
  concealed in the heavy shadows at the end of the room, crept forward into the
  ruddy gloom of the now dying fire.</p>

  <p>A miserable figure, bent and shabby, with an unsteady gait and a cowering
  air, it crept to the embers and spread out shivering hands.</p>

  <p>Count Louis, standing at the table, sunk in reverie, the open map in his
  hand, did not observe this figure, but the other two noticed him with a
  little movement of distaste.</p>

  <p>It was Dubois, fallen on the extreme of evil fortune. Lately meeting the
  Count Louis in Paris he had presumed on his acquaintance with the Nassau
  family to attach himself to his person.</p>

  <p>Nor had Louis shown himself other than kind to this wretch who was now
  reduced to the lowest means of making a miserable livelihood.</p>

  <p>He remembered him at his brother's wedding in Leipsic and as belonging to
  his brother's establishment in Brussels.</p>

  <p>The other two princes also remembered the fellow and his ghastly Leipsic
  prophecy and it did not please them to see him in attendance on Count
  Louis.</p>

  <p>Louis, turning suddenly, saw him</p>

  <p>"Ah, thou&mdash;for ever at my heels," he said, good-humouredly. "Like my
  dog&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Say rather a bird of prey or evil omen," remarked Duke Christopher
  gloomily.</p>

  <p>Count Henry laughed; Louis, still gazing at the charlatan, smiled.</p>

  <p>"See, these gentlemen are afraid of you, Dubois," he said.</p>

  <p>The Frenchman wheeled round; his tall, bent figure was clearly outlined
  against the steady glow of the fire.</p>

  <p>"Afraid of me?" he asked in a tone half sarcastic, "because I can see a
  little farther than most folk?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," answered the Elector's son, "I for one am in no mood for dismal
  forebodings."</p>

  <p>"What have I said of dismal?" replied the charlatan. Duke Christopher
  laughed shortly.</p>

  <p>"I recall well enough what thou didst say at Leipsic when we meddled with
  the spirits, fellow!"</p>

  <p>"Disaster and death to all, was it not?" asked Henry lightly.</p>

  <p>"To all the House of Nassau," said Louis with a smiling gravity; "well,
  the war thou didst foretell has broken&mdash;the battles have been fought and
  one has been sacrificed of those thou didst name that day."</p>

  <p>"Alas&mdash;!" muttered the charlatan. "Alas!"</p>

  <p>"Why alas?" asked the Count Louis calmly. "We go our appointed way and so
  far all hath been in honour."</p>

  <p>"Honour, yes," returned Dubois, "your lordship shall not lack in
  honour."</p>

  <p>"In what then shall we lack?" asked Duke Christopher with some
  grimness.</p>

  <p>The charlatan did not answer.</p>

  <p>Count Louis, looking at him, spoke.</p>

  <p>"No auguries of thine could be darker than those my own heart gives," he
  said.</p>

  <p>These words of his, so at variance both with his usual enthusiastic
  cheerfulness and the tone he had taken at the council of war, echoed
  mournfully in the vast chamber.</p>

  <p>The two young men looked at him sharply; Dubois did not turn.</p>

  <p>"Has thou come to the end of thy hopefulness?" asked Duke Christopher.</p>

  <p>"I do feel, deep in my soul," returned Louis steadily, "that this
  expedition of mine is destined to disaster."</p>

  <p>"Disaster?" repeated Henry; it was strange to him to hear his brother use
  that word.</p>

  <p>Louis threw back his head as if rousing himself from a reverie.</p>

  <p>"Why should I speak like this to-night? I do not know. Never before have I
  felt so full of doubt&mdash;yet often before have our enterprises been as
  perilous."</p>

  <p>The charlatan moved suddenly and came to the table; two of the candles had
  guttered and the Frenchman's pale and emaciated face appeared to the Count
  gazing through a veil of smoke.</p>

  <p>"What sayest thou to these thoughts of mine?" he asked. "Have the spirits
  no cheerful assurances to give me?"</p>

  <p>"It is a while since I saw the spirits," answered the charlatan, "but the
  air is heavy with portent and presage. That which your lordship feels is
  Heaven warning you to turn back."</p>

  <p>Louis smiled.</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows me better. The dear God for whom I battle could never
  suppose me a coward."</p>

  <p>Dubois looked at him earnestly; both affection and sorrow showed in the
  faded eyes of the charlatan as he gazed at the young soldier.</p>

  <p>"Is it cowardice to obey the dictates of the power above us, which warns
  us of oncoming defeat?" he asked, "and thereby tries to save us?"</p>

  <p>"Man is not so easily turned aside from his destiny," said Duke
  Christopher, "and I, at least, since first I engaged in this cause, have
  never thought to outlive my youth."</p>

  <p>Louis looked at him keenly.</p>

  <p>"Thou also hast melancholy forebodings?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"No more now than always," replied the young Lutheran calmly. "We fight in
  a cause that is yet feeble and build a fabric whose bricks will take much
  blood to cement."</p>

  <p>"The blood of the best and noblest," said Dubois, gazing at Count
  Louis.</p>

  <p>"We cannot go back, for that means dishonour," said Count Henry.</p>

  <p>He rose, and stretched himself; a sudden rush of wind lifted the few
  pieces of tapestry still covering the walls and shook them; Count Louis blew
  out the two guttering candles, leaving the apartment in partial darkness, for
  the fire was now only a few embers.</p>

  <p>The charlatan glanced towards the window.</p>

  <p>"It is near the hour of the dawn," he said.</p>

  <p>"So late!" exclaimed Count Louis.</p>

  <p>"Why, I would sleep a little before we march," said his brother and
  slipped his arm through that of the Elector's son.</p>

  <p>Count Louis went to the window and lifting the iron bar that held the
  shutters in place flung them open.</p>

  <p>The chamber faced east; the whole sky opposite was pale and luminous with
  light; but about the horizon lay banks of black clouds and the land lay dark
  and lifeless.</p>

  <p>Count Louis stood with his hands resting on the sill and the pure cold air
  of early morning blew on his face. He thought of the brother waiting for him
  in tense anxiety, of the people of Holland expecting his coming with such joy
  and impatience, of how much hung on this battle that be must undertake
  despite all his own strange foreboding, and the misfortunes that must attend
  a defeat.</p>

  <p>He might have still saved himself by a retreat, but he had never been of
  that temper to refuse to accept the odds of fate, never one to turn back
  before any obstacle.</p>

  <p>His judgment told him that he must abandon Maastricht, but he resolved to
  endeavour with his last strength to effect the junction with his brother on
  which so much depended.</p>

  <p>As he gazed at the east the clear sky brightened by the rays of the yet
  unseen sun.</p>

  <p>Then, suddenly a light vaporous cloud arose and, as Count Louis looked, it
  turned red, flushing to a deep crimson until the whole heavens seemed stained
  by streaks of blood. And in that melancholy hour Louis of Nassau read his
  doom in the sky before him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-6"
     id="ch2-6"></a>VI. &mdash; MOOKER HEYDE</h2>

  <p class="first">By the middle of April Louis of Nassau was encamped at the
  village of Mook, on the Meuse, near Cleves. Don Sancho D'Avila&mdash;the
  Spanish General, had out-marched him and now was facing him on the same side
  of the river which he had crossed by means of a bridge of boats.</p>

  <p>The position of Louis was not favourable; behind he was hemmed in by a
  chain of hills, so that his superiority in cavalry was greatly discounted by
  the limited space in which he could move; he had with difficulty quelled a
  mutiny which had broken out on the eve of battle among the mercenaries, who
  had demanded their pay as was their custom to do at the moment when they
  considered their services most valuable; and he had received the news that De
  Hierges and Valdez were on their way with reinforcements for the Spaniards to
  the number of five or six thousand. More desperate than ever seemed his
  chances of success as that success became more needful and more precious in
  his sight.</p>

  <p>Passionately did he long to effect the promised meeting with the
  Prince.</p>

  <p>But before that could be accomplished he had to fight his way through the
  Spanish forces.</p>

  <p>He had not wished for this battle, least of all under these circumstances,
  and he was acutely conscious that misfortune had followed his expedition from
  the first, but it was now obviously impossible to make the passage of the
  river without giving battle to the enemy, and there was nothing in the heart
  or mind of Louis of Nassau that bade him flinch from the inevitable
  conflict.</p>

  <p>His cheerful and gallant demeanour had even persuaded the mercenaries to
  fight without further ado; Louis had pledged his honour for their pay, and
  neither he nor his brother had ever failed in that&mdash;those who fought for
  them had always been paid to the full extent of their engagement, even if
  Louis went without camp furniture and William had not the wherewithal to make
  a present to one who had done him a service; moreover, something, in even the
  lowest of the French and German adventurers, had responded to the figure of
  fortitude and honour represented by the young Count.</p>

  <p>The day of battle dawned dull and stormy; low black clouds filled the
  sky.</p>

  <p>The spring was late this year and in the minds of all men the winter
  seemed interminable and the summer very far away.</p>

  <p>Count Louis armed in the bedroom of the farm-house that he had made his
  headquarters. A lantern hung on the whitewashed walls and through the small
  unshuttered window filtered the pallid glow of the yet unrisen sun.</p>

  <p>Between these two lights stood the young commander; his squire had just
  left him and he was himself knotting the scarf of orange silk across his
  breast.</p>

  <p>On the rush chair near the low bed where he had spent a few hours of rest,
  but not of sleep, were his casque with black plumes, his baton and his sword
  attached to the baldrick of embroidered leather given him by some French
  ladies.</p>

  <p>Louis recalled the gentle donors when he came to fasten on his weapon; but
  there was no particular woman in his mind.</p>

  <p>He was sorry for that; but he had never attached himself to the one woman
  who would have been alone in his thoughts at such a moment as this.</p>

  <p>Though rumour had persistently coupled his name with that of the Abbess of
  Jouane, she was nothing to him but one among many gracious figures of
  women.</p>

  <p>There was no one who would do more than heave a sigh&mdash;he had no
  lover.</p>

  <p>With a little laugh he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;why should he think of
  these things now: he turned to the window and gazed at the grey land and
  river and wide pale sky, every moment brightening.</p>

  <p>The nearer prospect was filled by his troops of foot and horse, now:
  beginning to move into the prearranged order of battle, some of the cavalry
  reaching as far as the hills that formed the horizon. As the Count looked his
  brother came behind him and touched his arm.</p>

  <p>"The day is cold&mdash;a late spring," Louis said.</p>

  <p>"The merrier when it comes," answered Henry with a certain gaiety.</p>

  <p>"I think it will come too late for you and me," returned his brother. "The
  flowers of this year will not be for our gathering."</p>

  <p>"I have never known you gloomy," said Count Henry. "What presentiment is
  this?"</p>

  <p>"No presentiment&mdash;the conviction of my heart. Our task finishes
  to-day. What we have done, good or ill, stands to our names and we have no
  more time to efface it. Look well upon this sun&mdash;I think we shall not
  see another earthly dawn."</p>

  <p>"God's Will be done," said Count Henry.</p>

  <p>"I would first have taken the Prince's hand again&mdash;but he will
  understand."</p>

  <p>"That we did our utmost," added Henry simply. He leant slightly from the
  window and gazed to where lay the gathering forces of Spain. "But why should
  you talk of defeat&mdash;we had such high hopes."</p>

  <p>"My hopes have failed me," answered Louis&mdash;"for me this battle ends
  all."</p>

  <p>Taking his baton of command in his hand he left the humble room and
  stepped through the adjoining kitchen into the open air.</p>

  <p>Henry followed him; the two mounted their great Flemish steeds and turned
  towards the centre of the patriot troops.</p>

  <p>They had scarcely started before they were joined by Duke Christopher, who
  rode a white horse of remarkable size and beauty trapped with fine scarlet
  leather and golden bosses.</p>

  <p>The young knight was not so sternly melancholy as usual, and wore in his
  casque, beneath the white plumes, a bunch of spring flowers, against the
  polished steel.</p>

  <p>"Will they give battle before the reinforcements arrive?" he asked, gazing
  in the direction of the enemy.</p>

  <p>"Remembering Heilger Lee they may wait, yet I do not think so," returned
  Louis. "D'Avila is both bold and prudent and will not risk our slipping past
  him."</p>

  <p>The sun rose above the hills, casting long rays of light on armour and
  lances, harness and cannon, muskets and pikes and the tiled roofs of the
  little village of Mook.</p>

  <p>Duke Christopher looked towards this rising light which fell full on his
  comely face and raised his hand as if in salute.</p>

  <p>"You also!" said Count Louis. "Do you say farewell?"</p>

  <p>The Elector's son smiled at him.</p>

  <p>"My auguries are even as thine&mdash;this day we are not destined to
  conquer, Count."</p>

  <p>"Then it is foolish to do battle," said Count Henry lightly.</p>

  <p>"But it is too late to turn back," answered Louis quietly. "Too late! The
  sun has already risen&mdash;our fate hangs upon the next few hours."</p>

  <p>"When this sun sets this battle must be lost or won," said Duke
  Christopher.</p>

  <p>"When this sun sets I at least shall be beyond the darkness," smiled Count
  Louis.</p>

  <p>The three separated, each to take command of his own division.</p>

  <p>The Spaniards still showed no sign of advancing and Louis began to be
  impatient for the battle to commence.</p>

  <p>He rode from one part of the field to the other visiting his forces, which
  were now drawn up in full battle array; ten companies of infantry massed
  together in the centre and four squadrons of cavalry reaching as far as the
  low hills which circumscribed the field.</p>

  <p>The forces of the enemy could be plainly discerned; the pikemen and
  musketeers to the right, the cavalry and sharpshooters to the left, with the
  carbineers in front and the Spanish lancers behind.</p>

  <p>At the first hour of light the Spaniards had made an attack on the deep
  trench with which Count Louis had surrounded himself, and an intermittent
  skirmishing was taking place at this point without bringing on a general
  engagement.</p>

  <p>The Spaniards, who had already received reinforcements to the number of a
  thousand men, were, in truth, debating the expediency of deferring the combat
  until the arrival of Valdez with about five thousand more troops which might
  be looked for by the following morning; at present the royalists were
  outnumbered by about three thousand men.</p>

  <p>While the Spaniards were holding a hurried council of war, Louis was
  forcing them to a combat; his trumpets sounded a defiance and his army stood
  ready.</p>

  <p>This challenge was soon answered by the shrill notes of the Spanish
  bugles, for D'Avila decided not to wait the reinforcements, lest, during the
  oncoming night Louis should contrive to effect the passage of the river and
  join his brother.</p>

  <p>Therefore another assault was ordered on the trench, which was slowly
  carried, the royalists charging on the village, from which, however, they
  were soon expelled by the patriots, Louis having sent a large number of men
  to strengthen this point.</p>

  <p>In a short time the battle involved almost the whole of the troops either
  side, the army of Louis and the army of D'Avila swaying to and fro in serried
  masses either side the disputed trench and village.</p>

  <p>Louis sat motionless at the head of his cavalry, watching the
  struggle.</p>

  <p>The sun had been soon obscured by light rising clouds and had disappeared
  behind their watery vapour to be seen no more that day; the first brightness
  of the morning had passed and the weather was dull and grey, cold too, with a
  fine thin wind blowing above the river and the wet marshes.</p>

  <p>The clouds seemed to press low and heavily on the heads of the gathered
  armies, and lances and armour, swords and muskets, helmets and carbines
  gleamed here and there with a sinister brightness amid the dark confusion of
  the battle.</p>

  <p>Count Louis glanced once up into the clouds, then, raising his baton, gave
  the order to charge.</p>

  <p>His keen and practised eye had discerned that his infantry was beginning
  to break, and indeed almost before his cavalry was in motion, they had given
  way and were flying from their posts, completely routed, leaving the enemy in
  possession of the trench and the village.</p>

  <p>Louis set his teeth as he saw his men going down like cornstalks before
  the tempest and hurled himself with fury upon the ranks of the Spanish
  horse.</p>

  <p>The men who followed him in that desperate charge were not German
  mercenaries or any soldiers who fought for hire, but noble gentlemen of the
  Netherlands, stern patriots of Holland and Brabant and French Huguenots who
  had served under Coligny.</p>

  <p>9</p>

  <p>The hired cavalry was behind them, but these, pressing close behind their
  leader, bore the brunt of the battle as befitted the flower of the army.</p>

  <p>With the first fury of their charge they bore down before them the
  carbineers who formed the vanguard of the royalist cavalry and who broke at
  once and fled in panic towards the river.</p>

  <p>Rising in his stirrups and waving to his men Count Louis followed in
  pursuit; in the marshes and on the river bank the royalists went down, horse
  and man; the patriots only paused in their pursuit when the sullen waters of
  the river lapped at their horses' feet and they saw the fugitives either
  sinking beneath the sullied ripples or desperately swimming to the opposite
  bank; then Louis turned to see the issue of the general battle.</p>

  <p>A confused action was now taking place on all parts of the field; the
  Spanish lances and the German Black Horse, who had withstood Louis's
  onslaught, had fallen on the remainder of his cavalry when they had retired
  to reload their weapons and a fierce and desperate conflict ensued.</p>

  <p>Spaniard and Netherlander, German and Frenchman struggled together amid
  the smoke, the spurting flame, the flash of uplifted weapon; nodding plumes
  were struck to the ground, men fell from their horses to be trodden into the
  mud by frenzied hoofs, foot and cavalry were intermingled in one maddened
  mass; shouts and oaths of men rose with the cries of wounded animals and
  pierced with rage and terror the hoarse clamour of the encounter.</p>

  <p>While Louis gazed he saw that the fight was going against him&mdash;even
  as his heart had predicted.</p>

  <p>Galloping to the head of those who had followed him in his pursuit to the
  river bank, he dashed back to the centre of the conflict where his forces,
  horse and foot, were being borne down before the Spanish spears and the
  German lances.</p>

  <p>Louis, galloping from one part of the field to another in the effort to
  rally his remaining men, saw that the day was lost before well begun.</p>

  <p>Black clouds were rising from the horizon and closing over the grey vault
  of heaven; a low thunder rolled in the west and heavy drops of rain began to
  fall.</p>

  <p>A Spanish captain, recognizing the Nassau chieftain by his orange scarf,
  rode at him full tilt; Louis drew his sword and struck the enemy down, then,
  controlling his plunging horse, turned to where the last nucleus of his
  cavalry were drawn together by the entrance to the village of Mook; at the
  head of them was Count Henry, taut as a bow in his saddle, keen as a hawk in
  his eager glance, waiting to see how best he could fall on the enemy and meet
  his own inevitable fate.</p>

  <p>Louis rode to his side.</p>

  <p>"The day is lost," he said, pointing to the bloody field above which the
  storm clouds hung low, "the fight is over, it is now but a carnage and a
  massacre."</p>

  <p>The youngest Nassau looked towards the battle where so many fair and high
  hopes were being for ever shattered. "Let us," he answered, "make haste to
  die."</p>

  <p>As he spoke they were joined by the Elector's son; his surtout hung in
  tatters over his armour and he held a broken sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>"It is over!" he said, breathing heavily, "it is over and I have said
  farewell to life."</p>

  <p>Louis of Nassau took the casque from his head and threw it away; his fair
  face and bright hair showed above his soiled armour; the little body of
  cavalry gathered about him; the thunder rolled louder; in the pause were the
  groans and shrieks of the dying and the fierce Spanish shouts of murderous
  revenge and triumph.</p>

  <p>The three young princes clasped hands; their figures were illumined by the
  glare from some farm-houses near by which the Spaniards had fired; the rain
  fell on their uncovered heads.</p>

  <p>Gathering their men about them with words of encouragement, they charged
  with the fury of despair into the midst of the dark and hideous fight.</p>

  <p>And as they went a wild and miserable figure spray g from the shelter of
  some ruined cottages and hurled himself upon the bridle of Count Louis's
  rearing steed, finding at the side of the man who had been kind to him his
  own death in the midst of that battle he had predicted at Prince William's
  marriage feast.</p>

  <p>For Dubois, the charlatan, the two Nassau princes, and Duke Christopher,
  the Elector's son, went down together on that day of woe and terror, and
  never, alive or dead, did any again behold them.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-7"
     id="ch2-7"></a>VII. &mdash; RÉNÉE</h2>

  <p class="first">The fields round Heidelberg were full of flowers; the first
  days of May soft with sunshine lingered pleasantly over woods flushing into
  leaf, and banks of violets, narcissus, primroses and the young fronds of fern
  all fragrant in the damp richness of the forest.</p>

  <p>Among these flowers, towards the fall of the day, Charlotte de Bourbon
  walked with Rénée le Meuny.</p>

  <p>A silence that seemed to hold encompassed them, they wandered aimlessly
  between the slender trunks of the young aspen and the round massive trunks of
  the ancient beech trees.</p>

  <p>The Princess carried a flat rush basket and now and then plucked and
  placed therein long-stalked flowers; but Rénée did not pick the blossoms
  though she moved so as not to tread them under foot.</p>

  <p>A gentle light was diffused through the high branches so delicately
  covered with the budding green, and pale shadows fell over the slowly moving
  figures of the two women.</p>

  <p>Charlotte de Bourbon wore a gown of violet cloth with a white cloak and
  hood; her hair was slightly disordered by the soft spring winds which had
  also brought a colour to her usually pale face.</p>

  <p>Rénée's attire was plain and careless and ill accorded with the scene; her
  beauty was under its habitual eclipse of indifferency and apathy; lines of
  weariness were beginning to disfigure her smooth contours and sadness to dim
  the light of her eyes for life still passed her by and she had no longer the
  hopeful charms of youth to support her loneliness, no longer any service to
  perform with which to occupy her time; she missed even the exacting days of
  labour passed under the rule of Anne of Saxony, for then at least she was
  performing a self-imposed task and satisfying her own ideal&mdash;rendering
  the only service in her power to the only human being for whom she had ever
  cared.</p>

  <p>But now&mdash;what was she but a useless dependent on charity, a creature
  devoted to little tasks any serving-maid could have performed as well.</p>

  <p>Her most constant companion was the Princess Charlotte, but the two had
  not come close together; this was not the fault of the Frenchwoman, Rénée had
  no love, no confidence, no friendship to give to any one, all was
  concentrated in that one feeling that ran deep and secret as life itself.</p>

  <p>Rénée thought of the Prince and nothing but the Prince, it was the
  devotion of the soldier for his captain, of the patriot for his leader, of
  the oppressed for his saviour&mdash;and the love of a woman for a man, all
  strengthened and idealized by time and distance until the passion had become
  an obsession, the devotion a creed, from which she had no distraction, no
  relief, nor would she find or accept any.</p>

  <p>Charlotte de Bourbon, with the tact of one trained to observe and command,
  had always respected her reserve; the Princess herself had a self-contained
  nature that required no confidant, a firmness of purpose that required no
  support from others.</p>

  <p>In their wandering they reached a bank where the primroses grew thick in
  clusters between the damp mosses and dead leaves of last year and there
  Charlotte seated herself, on the fallen bough of a beech tree which had sunk
  half into the earth.</p>

  <p>With delicate fingers she picked the flowers to right and left of her and
  laid them in her basket.</p>

  <p>"Do you think," she asked, lifting her eyes to Rénée, "that Louis of
  Nassau is dead?"</p>

  <p>Rénée was a little startled at this calm in Charlotte, for she had always
  believed, in common with many others, that Count Louis was the chosen husband
  of the Princess.</p>

  <p>"I know what you know, madam," she returned, "that only a few survived the
  fight of Mooker Heyde."</p>

  <p>"Duke Christopher, too," said Charlotte thoughtfully, "and Count
  Henry&mdash;all gone together&mdash;it does not seem possible."</p>

  <p>"The Elector will not believe it yet, so why should we?"</p>

  <p>"In his heart the Elector believes it, though he will not wear
  mourning."</p>

  <p>"He believes it?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," returned the Princess quietly. "He told me this morning that
  he had received a dispatch from the Prince&mdash;His Highness has written and
  written to his brother and received no answer, and no news whatever of the
  Princes has come to him."</p>

  <p>"It is too terrible," said Rénée, "such a disaster! Why has God turned
  away his face? All our hopes went down at Mooker Heyde."</p>

  <p>"Nay," answered Charlotte. "William of Orange lives."</p>

  <p>The waiting-woman looked at her swiftly.</p>

  <p>"But His Highness cannot do everything," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Why, I think he can&mdash;do everything," said the Princess. She had
  picked all the primroses within reach and now sat with her hands in her
  lap.</p>

  <p>"Even if these two other branches be lopped from the House of Nassau," she
  continued, "the cause is not lost&mdash;not while the Prince lives."</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;she never cared for the Count&mdash;never cared," thought
  Rénée; she leant against the mossy trunk of the great beech tree that threw a
  soft shade over the Princess; she was in darker shadow herself.</p>

  <p>"You do not weep for Count Louis, madam?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Why should I weep?" returned the Princess. "He died young and splendid.
  What did the Elector say of his son?&mdash;'Better die thus than live in
  sloth or evil.'"</p>

  <p>"Hard words for love to say, madam.'</p>

  <p>"Brave words," returned the Princess.</p>

  <p>Rénée was looking at her curiously.</p>

  <p>"I could not take so calmly the loss of one beloved." Charlotte looked
  thoughtfully at her flowers.</p>

  <p>"No," she said slowly. "Perhaps I could not&mdash;it is easy when one is
  heart free!"</p>

  <p>"Heart free!" echoed Rénée. "Then Count Louis was nothing to you?"</p>

  <p>Charlotte flushed at the abruptness of the question and Rénée coloured
  also when she realized what she had said. But the Princess answered
  gravely&mdash;</p>

  <p>"He was no suitor of mine, if that is your meaning, though I know that our
  names have been coupled."</p>

  <p>"Why, madam, what right have I to speak?" interrupted Rénée with a certain
  recklessness. "I have never been in the confidence of your Highness."</p>

  <p>In some way, strange even to herself, she was troubled that Charlotte had
  not given her heart to Louis of Nassau.</p>

  <p>"I have no confidences to give," replied the Princess serenely. "Believe
  me, none."</p>

  <p>Rénée did not reply; her heart was weary; she was thinking of another
  forest, dull in its winter barrenness, through which she had ridden one magic
  day, with the hero of her dreams.</p>

  <p>Charlotte rose.</p>

  <p>"Let us return," she said, "see how low the sun shines through the
  trees."</p>

  <p>Rénée followed her in silence.</p>

  <p>"I am thinking," continued Charlotte, "of the Prince of Orange."</p>

  <p>Rénée looked at her intently.</p>

  <p>"Is it not a sad life now and a lonely one?" added the Princess. "He had
  so many hopes on this enterprise&mdash;Think now, the suspense, the waiting,
  the anxiety and gradually the sure knowledge of disaster.</p>

  <p>"You think more of him then, than of those who have fallen?"</p>

  <p>"They are beyond my pity," answered Charlotte gravely. "Nay, pity I would
  not say, for who am I to pity such as the Prince?&mdash;but they suffer no
  more." Her voice faltered a little on the last words.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that the Prince suffers?" asked Rénée slowly.</p>

  <p>"He must suffer&mdash;one who has undertaken such a task&mdash;against
  such odds!" replied Charlotte. "And alone&mdash;he tells the Elector that
  there is no one in whom he can trust."</p>

  <p>"He was always alone," said Rénée, "even in Brussels&mdash;he is better
  now than when he had his wife."</p>

  <p>"Do not call her his wife, she is that no longer&mdash;the clergy have
  declared a divorce."</p>

  <p>Rénée had not heard this news; it startled her to think that the Prince
  was free; her thoughts went to the wretched woman whom she had so long
  served.</p>

  <p>"And Anne of Saxony?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"She has been returned to her people," said Charlotte. "She is mad."</p>

  <p>"Well for her when Death releases her," replied Rénée, "her life has been
  but suffering and she brought pleasure to none. I was much with her and I
  know the truth. The Prince was very patient and magnanimous, madam, and of a
  great kindness."</p>

  <p>"He married for ambition," replied the Princess, "and therefore paid."</p>

  <p>They had now reached the end of the wood and were passing through the last
  scattered trees.</p>

  <p>The spring fields lay about them; the faint azure of the sky was stained
  by the rosy gold of sunset; pale clouds were piled about the western horizon
  and a low wind was abroad which gently shook the budding boughs and bent the
  frail early flowers and caused the two women to shiver a little within their
  cloaks.</p>

  <p>Rénée, shading her eyes from the level rays of the sun, that she might see
  the pathway home, discerned a man coming towards them.</p>

  <p>He was a ragged fellow and leant upon a stout stick. Mendicants who were,
  or claimed to be, wounded soldiers from the theatre of war, or fugitives from
  the persecutions in the Netherlands, were common enough; but this one,
  despite his attire, seemed to be of the better sort. "A soldier," said
  Rénée.</p>

  <p>Charlotte turned and the man approached them, took off his ragged hat and
  very civilly asked the way to the Castle.</p>

  <p>"You are a Fleming?" asked Rénée, speaking in her own tongue.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Your speech shows it," answered Rénée; she looked keenly at his ragged
  leathern clothes, his emaciated figure and haggard face.</p>

  <p>"You want the Castle?" asked Charlotte.</p>

  <p>"Strange that must seem to you, madam," he answered with a smile and an
  air of breeding, "but I wish to see the Elector himself."</p>

  <p>"You have news?" exclaimed the Princess, "we are from the Castle and you
  may speak fully to us, sir."</p>

  <p>"I was one of Count Louis' officers, madam, and have escaped from the
  fight of Mooker Heyde," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Then indeed the Elector will welcome you," said Charlotte. "Have you news
  of his son, Duke Christopher?"</p>

  <p>"I last saw him in the fight, madam&mdash;he and Count Louis and Count
  Henry&mdash;and no man has seen them since, I think. All went down together
  in the battle."</p>

  <p>"And none know how they died?" asked the Princess.</p>

  <p>"How should one know in such a fight, madam?" he answered. "And after the
  fight there was great slaughter. And many were trampled into the marshes or
  burnt in the flames of the villages and the farmhouses which the Spaniards
  fired&mdash;who can tell which way these three princes died?"</p>

  <p>Charlotte shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Does the Prince of Orange know this news?" asked Rénée.</p>

  <p>"I have not been to Holland, madam, and know nothing. One hears rumours,
  reports&mdash;little is certain. Probably the Prince is at Bommel or Delft,
  by now he would know. This every one says&mdash;that Leiden is again
  beleaguered."</p>

  <p>"This defeat has been indeed a disaster!" exclaimed Rénée.</p>

  <p>"Yet not of great advantage to the Spaniards," replied the officer, "for
  there was a meeting among their troops after the battle and they marched on
  Brussels and occupied the city with much disorder. Nor is there the money to
  pay them or any means of quieting them."</p>

  <p>Charlotte roused herself from her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"You must tell these things to the Elector, we detain you, sir. Whether
  this victory be fruitful or barren to the enemy there is nothing can replace
  the loss of Count Louis."</p>

  <p>The soldier responded with great animation and earnestness.</p>

  <p>"He was beloved by all of us, madam&mdash;the soul of the army&mdash;the
  guiding -hand."</p>

  <p>"A charming gentleman," said Charlotte, and the tears were in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Sweet and brave, madam, and of a great cheerfulness even in
  adversity."</p>

  <p>"The Prince&mdash;" began Rénée.</p>

  <p>"The Prince will weep for him, madam, even till the day of his own
  death."</p>

  <p>"The Prince has but one brother left," said Charlotte as they turned
  towards the castle, "three princes lost from the House of Nassau since this
  bitter fight began."</p>

  <p>"Do you think any will be left?" queried the soldier mournfully. "Ah,
  madam, it is not the House of Nassau only that has been stripped of its
  sons&mdash;many a noble family is desolate&mdash;when will the good times
  come that will repay for this time of tears?"</p>

  <p>"If the Prince is spared," said the Princess, "we shall see these good
  times."</p>

  <p>"The Prince?" replied the Netherlander, "have you faith that the Prince
  will be spared? His life is not worth a white piece&mdash;Philip's assassins
  are for ever on his track&mdash;it is but a question of time."</p>

  <p>Charlotte caught hold of Rénée's arm; she laughed and her step was
  unsteady.</p>

  <p>The waiting-woman stared down at her; her impulse was to shake her off; to
  speak to her with anger, demanding&mdash;"What is it to you that danger
  threatens the Prince of Orange?" But the Princess, all unconscious, clung to
  her as one woman will cling to another in a moment of agitation or
  trouble.</p>

  <p>"The Prince must go&mdash;go," she said. "All our hopes are on the
  Prince."</p>

  <p>Rénée read the truth in her flushed face and startled eyes.</p>

  <p>She drew away so sharply that the Princess almost stumbled in her
  walk.</p>

  <p>"When so many have gone is it likely that the Prince of Orange will be
  spared?" she demanded, harshly. "As certainly as Philip punished those others
  who offended him will he punish the Prince."</p>

  <p>Charlotte gazed at her in amazement.</p>

  <p>"You speak so strangely," she said.</p>

  <p>"Do I?" smiled Rénée. "I have strange thoughts in my heart."</p>

  <p>They had now reached the Castle gate and Rénée abruptly left her two
  companions and went to her own chamber in one of the turrets; there she flung
  herself on her knees beside her bed and rested her beautiful head on the
  pillow; from the narrow pointed window a little ray of the last light
  penetrated the shadows of the room and fell over her bowed figure.</p>

  <p>She had surprised the secret of Charlotte de Bourbon, which was the same
  as her-own; the Princess also had made a hero of William of
  Orange&mdash;probably loved him.</p>

  <p>And he was free&mdash;and she was of the same rank&mdash;the same
  faith.</p>

  <p>Rénée understood now; it was not Louis but William who would be the
  husband of the exiled Princess.</p>

  <p>And she&mdash;she was to play her old part&mdash;to be the confidante
  before marriage, the serving-maid afterwards&mdash;a convenient figure in the
  background. It would be different, yes, as Charlotte de Bourbon was different
  from Anne of Saxony.</p>

  <p>But Rénée knew that the kindness of the new mistress would be as hard to
  bear as the harshness of the old.</p>

  <p>And her days for patient self-sacrifice were gone by; she could not do
  again what she had once done.</p>

  <p>She could not serve Charlotte's happiness as she had served Anne's misery;
  she could not again be a dependent in the house of the Prince.</p>

  <p>"I want to die," she said, pressing her face to the pillow.</p>

  <p>"I have never been any use and now I want to die." Presently, and before
  the hour of the supper, when her absence would be noticed, she rose and
  taking nothing with her but what little money she possessed, left the Castle.
  The keen evening air and the light of the moon pleased her; she turned her
  back on the Castle of Heidelberg and took the road by which the Netherlander
  had come.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-8"
     id="ch2-8"></a>VIII. &mdash; LEIDEN</h2>

  <p class="first">Attended by a small mounted escort William of Orange rode
  from Delft to Polderwaert, a fortress between that city and Rotterdam.</p>

  <p>A summer sun was overhead and the fields reclaimed from the sea were green
  with the first lush green of grain and grass.</p>

  <p>High banked clouds, rising like battlements into the heavens, were
  reflected clearly in the motionless waters of the canal along the side of
  which the Prince rode.</p>

  <p>His demeanour was melancholy, and, for the first time in this struggle of
  seven years, he appeared both ill and tired.</p>

  <p>Mooker Heyde had gone as far to break his spirit as anything could; even
  his superb health had been shaken under the continued strain of waiting for
  news, the long anxiety, the final realization that Louis and Henry were both
  lost for ever&mdash;that his right hand, his own confidant, his beloved
  friend and ever faithful follower, had gone down in that dark battle where so
  many fair hopes had been trampled into the marshes by the Meuse.</p>

  <p>Politically the defeat of the patriots had had but little effect upon' the
  fortunes of war, quickly followed as it had been by the mutiny of the Spanish
  troops and the success of Admiral Boisat, who after the victory of Bergen had
  sailed up the Scheldt and at Antwerp destroyed the fleet, which had escaped
  him on a former occasion, thus securing the supremacy of the Netherlanders on
  the sea, and Resquesens himself admitted that as long as they held that it
  would be impossible to bring them into complete subjection.</p>

  <p>Of almost equal importance in the eyes of the Prince was the fact that the
  amnesty recently issued by Resquesens had entirely failed in its effect.</p>

  <p>This document, by which Philip humbled himself so far as to offer a
  complete pardon to all of his rebels subjects who would return to the
  Romanist Church, had been accepted by none.</p>

  <p>The Reformed religion had acquired too firm a hold among the Netherlanders
  and there was not one of them who was not prepared to combat to the last,
  both for the land of his birth and the religion of his adoption.</p>

  <p>William, who for a moment had feared the effect of a general pardon coming
  so soon after the disheartening failure of Louis' expedition, had been
  exceedingly encouraged by the disdain with which it had been received.</p>

  <p>But there was one consequence of Mooker Heyde which now almost entirely
  occupied his thoughts.</p>

  <p>The beautiful city of Leiden, one of the fairest in the Netherlands, was
  now strictly beleaguered again, no less than eight thousand troops closely
  surrounding it; while the town itself was ungarrisoned and unprovisioned.</p>

  <p>And they were depending on the Prince, who had entreated them to endure a
  siege of at least three months, earnestly promising them, as did the Estates
  of Holland, that relief was at hand, and that sooner than Leiden should
  perish as had perished Haarlem and other fair cities, taken by the Spaniards,
  the whole country would contend to the last man.</p>

  <p>And the Prince felt that indeed the whole issue of the struggle was bound
  up in the fate of Leiden, if that city fell there was but little hope for the
  struggling Provinces.</p>

  <p>Day and night he toiled, devising schemes for the rescue of the people
  whose sole trust was in him and who were passing long hours of anguished
  suspense waiting for the succour that had not yet come, which he had assured
  them of, and which they waited for.</p>

  <p>Land relief was, since Mooker Heyde, out of the question.</p>

  <p>There remained the sea.</p>

  <p>Since the first the sea had been in William's mind as the means by which
  he could save his city.</p>

  <p>Leiden was not on the sea&mdash;but the sea might come to Leiden.</p>

  <p>Although the Spaniards held the coast from the Hague to Naardingen, the
  Prince held the dykes along the Meuse and Yssel.</p>

  <p>The Estates were yet to be finally convinced of the absolute necessity of
  this bold and desperate plan, but the Prince was resolved that they should
  give their consent.</p>

  <p>As he rode now he looked from right to left at the flat rich country, at
  the fair plenteous fields, the numerous windmills, the villages, orchards and
  country houses which he was prepared to give to the ocean to save Leiden.</p>

  <p>A curious love for this country that was not his by birth filled his heart
  with a deep tenderness; the tenderness felt towards the thing for which he
  had forfeited everything, on which he had staked his all, and to which, he
  never doubted, his life would be finally sacrificed.</p>

  <p>&mdash;"Or here to find my grave," he had said of Holland; and he knew
  that somewhere among the low fields, in one of these old churches that rose
  massive above the low line of the land, his body would rest&mdash;this was
  his home now and would be his tomb.</p>

  <p>Might that tomb be among a free people and perhaps looked on with a little
  love by unborn generations&mdash;this was now his sole ambition; liberty for
  the future, a prosperous country flourishing in freedom.</p>

  <p>He raised his eyes to the clouds and something in their loftiness touched
  his spirit.</p>

  <p>"Ride," he said to the men behind him, "for the rain comes."</p>

  <p>He wrapped his black cloak about him and shivered, for the fever was upon
  him.</p>

  <p>For several days he had been ill, but the energy of his spirit had forced
  the weakness of his body, and to none had he admitted his state, which was
  betrayed by his pallid cheeks and languid eyes and the feebleness of his
  movements, usually so full of life and force.</p>

  <p>When the little cavalcade rode into the courtyard of the Castle of
  Polderwaert the Prince nearly dropped from the saddle; he had been exercising
  great effort of will to maintain himself upright so long.</p>

  <p>"I can no more to-day," he said with a smiling look, taking hold of the
  arm of one of his companions, Cornelius Van Mierop, the Receiver-General of
  Rotterdam, who, seeing him stagger, had hastened to his assistance, "never
  have I felt so weak," he added, "and never have I needed strength more."</p>

  <p>They helped him upstairs to the little chamber furnished for his use and
  he sank with a sigh into the great rush-bottomed chair by the window.</p>

  <p>He had scarcely flung off his hat and cloak before the commandant of the
  castle was in his presence and had presented him with a letter arrived that
  morning by carrier pigeon from Leiden.</p>

  <p>With fingers that had lost their usual steadiness William tore open the
  missive.</p>

  <p>As he read the feverish colour deepened in his worn face.</p>

  <p>The letter was an appeal for help, a reminder of his promise&mdash;a
  statement of the fact that provisions were running out&mdash;that Leiden had
  endured almost as much as it was possible to endure.</p>

  <p>The Prince crushed up the letter in his hand.</p>

  <p>"The dykes must be cut," he exclaimed, "the sluices must be opened!"</p>

  <p>"Your Highness must then persuade the Estates," said Van Mierop.</p>

  <p>The Prince leant back in his chair, taken by a sudden weakness.</p>

  <p>He stared out of the window and the landscape swam before his eyes.</p>

  <p>The appeal of the starving city struck to his heart and brain like a
  tongue of flame.</p>

  <p>"Leiden must be saved," he said passionately. "If she sinks the country
  sinks with her!"</p>

  <p>"But to-night let your Highness repose," said his secretary, looking
  anxiously at his haggard face.</p>

  <p>"Nay," replied William, "I have to write to the Estates."</p>

  <p>Collecting his strength he rose with an effort and went to the little
  black desk in the corner of the chamber.</p>

  <p>He called for candles, for the light was beginning to leave the room.</p>

  <p>Refusing the services of his secretary he took up the quill. "What is it
  your Highness must write?" enquired Van Meirop, humbly standing before
  him.</p>

  <p>"Mynheer," answered the Prince, looking at him with eyes unnaturally
  bright, "they starve in Leiden."</p>

  <p>"Then let your Highness remember," returned Van Meirop earnestly, "that
  the hopes of this city are on your Highness."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that I shall fail them?" asked the Prince quickly.</p>

  <p>"I think," replied the Receiver-General, "that your health may fail your
  Highness."</p>

  <p>But William shook his head with the confidence of a man who had never been
  sick nor feeble, nor had to give a thought to his body.</p>

  <p>"My strength will last me for my work, Mynheer," he said.</p>

  <p>He drew the paper towards him and began writing with eager haste.</p>

  <p>With lucidity and force, eloquence and passion, he described the city of
  Leiden's plight and urged the one means of her relief&mdash;the cutting of
  the dykes.</p>

  <p>As he sealed this epistle which was quickly written he turned to the
  Receiver-General who was seated near him, the other side of the candle
  glow.</p>

  <p>"Mynheer, the sluices must be opened," he said; narrowing his eyes to
  watch the other's face.</p>

  <p>Cornelius Van Meirop bent his head; he was thinking of his own fair villa
  and farm, achieved by a lifetime of labour, which he had hoped to leave to
  his children and which would be among the first to be swallowed by the waves
  once the sea was let in over Holland.</p>

  <p>"How exactly does your Highness mean to relieve Leiden?" he asked.</p>

  <p>William read the thoughts of the man before him and was pitiful towards
  them.</p>

  <p>"Mynheer," he said gently, "I would open the sluices at Schiedam and
  Rotterdam and out the dykes along the Yssel. Then I would gather together the
  fleet at Rotterdam and Delfhaven and let them float to Leiden on the rising
  waters."</p>

  <p>"But the Sand-scheiding, they can never pass that," answered Van
  Meirop.</p>

  <p>He referred to a difficulty that had been in the Prince's mind from the
  first.</p>

  <p>The Sand-scheiding was a great dyke within five miles of Leiden which city
  it shielded from the sea, and even if the ocean should rise high enough to
  permit vessels to float over this there were beyond it several mighty
  bulwarks built to defend the town against the water which it would be
  necessary to break through.</p>

  <p>To add to the difficulty all this portion of reclaimed land, which
  contained rich pastures and several villages, was in the hands of the
  Spaniards, who also held the Sand-scheiding.</p>

  <p>"It is difficult," admitted the Prince, "but it must be done. The
  Sand-scheiding must be stormed and pierced for the fleet to sail
  through."</p>

  <p>"And if the wind is contrary?" asked Van Meirop, "and blows the fleet back
  or keeps it motionless, Highness?"</p>

  <p>"They must wait till it sets fair."</p>

  <p>"There are a thousand obstacles."</p>

  <p>"What is our life," returned the Prince, "but the overcoming of
  obstacles?"</p>

  <p>"If the thing is humanly possible your Highness can accomplish it," said
  Van Meirop.</p>

  <p>William lifted his dark eyes, now so sunken and shadowed.</p>

  <p>"It is strange to think that any have faith in me," he answered, "I feel
  myself so weak and impotent."</p>

  <p>He raised his hand and let it fall on the desk; his breath was coming
  quickly and the flush of fever darkened his brow.</p>

  <p>"I must to Rotterdam to-day," he said.</p>

  <p>"To-day? It is already late, Highness."</p>

  <p>"My work cannot stop for time nor season, Mynheer Van Meirop."</p>

  <p>"What urges your Highness to Rotterdam?"</p>

  <p>The Prince rose, steadying himself by holding on to the arms of the rush
  chair.</p>

  <p>"I wish to press this question of the opening of the dykes&mdash;there is
  no time to be lost."</p>

  <p>"Your Highness takes much to heart the fate of Leiden."</p>

  <p>"Because with the fate of Leiden is bound the fate of Holland," said
  William, and handed his letter to the Estates, bidding it be dispatched
  immediately.</p>

  <p>"And with the fate of Holland," he added, after a little, "is bound the
  fate of a new nation and many generations yet to come."</p>

  <p>He picked up his cloak and slowly put it round his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mynheer," he said, "we do not struggle for a little thing nor contend
  for a mean advantage but for what will be precious in the future."</p>

  <p>But Van Meirop was thinking of his pleasant villa and fertile pastures
  that must be sacrificed to save Leiden and his face was gloomy; he was
  growing an old man and the struggle which was to strip him of everything
  seemed very long and the bright future it was to purchase very far away.</p>

  <p>The Prince laid his hand gently on the Receiver-General's sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Courage, friend, courage," he said quietly, "the good time
  comes&mdash;for all."</p>

  <p>Van Meirop turned his face away quickly with the shamed tears in his eyes,
  for he saw that the Prince had read his thoughts, and there came quickly to
  his mind all that William had sacrificed in the cause of a country and a
  religion not by birth his own; sacrifices compared to which the poor little
  quota of such as he was indeed as nothing.</p>

  <p>The Prince picked up his hat and left the chamber, followed by his
  secretary and Van Meirop.</p>

  <p>When they took horse for Rotterdam the west was blazing red about a lake
  of molten gold where the sun was sinking below the watery horizon and the
  wide waters that traversed the pastures were also shot with gold.</p>

  <p>William rode a little ahead of his companions; it did not seem to him that
  he was alone.</p>

  <p>His thoughts turned, as they ever did when he was at a little leisure, to
  Count Louis, and it seemed to him he was accompanied by that young and
  martial figure that smiled at him with eyes of unquenchable hope and a look
  of love and confidence.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-9"
     id="ch2-9"></a>IX. &mdash; NEWS FROM HEIDELBERG</h2>

  <p class="first">The Prince lay ill at Rotterdam; a humble house near the
  harbour was his lodging, and there he lay during the long days and close
  nights in a fever that now rose to delirium and now left him prostrate with
  utter weakness. The physicians could do nothing for him&mdash;it was, they
  said, an illness of the mind and unless he might have repose of brain and
  spirit they feared for his life.</p>

  <p>But none could give him this repose while Leiden was unrelieved.</p>

  <p>He had obtained the consent of the Estates to the cutting of the dykes and
  the opening of the sluices and the work was in progress, but it proceeded
  slowly.</p>

  <p>In the interval he dictated letters of encouragement to the beleaguered
  city, of exhortation to the states and the relieving fleet, which, ready
  provisioned, lay waiting under the command of Admiral Boisat at
  Delfshaven.</p>

  <p>Too long had he borne the burden of a nation struggling into freedom on
  his shoulders; even his perfect health had broken beneath the continued
  strain of mind and body.</p>

  <p>His feeling of helplessness added to the agitation of his spirit; never
  before had he known what it was to have his body fail him and to lie helpless
  at the moment when he most needed his energy.</p>

  <p>One afternoon he lay thus, and waking from a heavy sleep he looked about
  his room regarding it as if it was a strange place.</p>

  <p>The windows were open wide on the sunshine; on the sill was a blue and
  white pot of coarse earthenware holding a plant of scarlet geranium which
  showed vivid in its red and green amid the encircling light.</p>

  <p>The short curtains of coarse white linen very slightly waved in the
  delicate breeze.</p>

  <p>The walls, half panelled wood and half whitewash, were full of shelves and
  open cupboards which held articles of brass and copper, china and earthenware
  in shining hues of blues and reds.</p>

  <p>The Prince looked, and his mind flashed vividly back to the last appeal
  from Leiden reminding him of his promise to relieve them.</p>

  <p>"We have endured the three months to which we pledged ourselves; we have
  held out two months with bread and a month without."</p>

  <p>The sentence rang in his brain, he tried to move himself but fell back,
  for a fierce pain shot through his limbs.</p>

  <p>He lay there helpless, and again his tired eyes travelled round the
  chamber.</p>

  <p>This time they encountered the figure of a woman sitting in the corner of
  the room farthest from the bed.</p>

  <p>She wore a plain dress of dark grey and a ruff of fine muslin, she had her
  back to the Prince, so that he could not see her face, only her red-gold
  hair.</p>

  <p>Her hands passed quickly to and fro over a length of fine embroidery.</p>

  <p>The Prince watched her with the interest of a sick man</p>

  <p>He liked to see her there in her grace and calm, her delicate fingers
  working so steadily, her whole presence suggestive of repose and comfort. It
  was long since he had seen such a woman in any house or apartment of his; as
  this thought of his loneliness came to him he sighed.</p>

  <p>Instantly the lady turned her head and looked at him.</p>

  <p>Her face was perfectly familiar, but he could not give her a name nor tell
  where and when he had known her before.</p>

  <p>He lay still, in a curious world of his own bred of fever and weakness,
  the thought the old life in Brussels was about him.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness wishes for something?" asked the woman, laying down her
  work.</p>

  <p>Her voice broke through the Prince's dreams; with an effort he recalled
  himself to the present.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, "only to know your name, which surely I knew once."</p>

  <p>She smiled very faintly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, your Highness knew it once."</p>

  <p>She was beautiful with a beauty of sorrow and reserve.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were slightly shadowed, her lovely mouth slightly strained and
  her look was both grave and inscrutable.</p>

  <p>"I knew it once," repeated William slowly; languor held him motionless;
  his thought would go no further than the familiar stranger before him.</p>

  <p>"In Brussels. You remember, Highness?"</p>

  <p>He slightly shook his head on the pillow.</p>

  <p>"And once since Brussels," repeated the woman quietly.</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"At Heidelberg," she said; her clear cheeks delicately flushed; she began
  folding up her embroidery.</p>

  <p>"Heidelberg," William repeated; he closed his eyes and thought.</p>

  <p>The word brought before his mind a fair and gentle woman who had spoken in
  his cause and with whom he had talked in the Castle gardens&mdash;a fugitive
  vision of great sweetness.</p>

  <p>It was not the first time that this memory had come to him; it was,
  indeed, one on which he loved to dwell.</p>

  <p>"You were at Heidelberg?" his mind worked slowly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Highness," she hesitated a moment and then added: "We rode there
  together you and I, Prince, one March day."</p>

  <p>He opened wide his eyes.</p>

  <p>"One March day&mdash;a wet day. I remember&mdash;you are Rénée le
  Meuny."</p>

  <p>"Who was in your service once."</p>

  <p>"In Brussels&mdash;yes. In my&mdash;the service of the Princess."</p>

  <p>He lay silent awhile, looking at her. Nor did she speak. He recalled her
  now very clearly and the interest and curiosity her loveliness and patient
  service had provoked&mdash;an interest and a curiosity soon
  forgotten&mdash;yet both revived now finding her here in these circumstances,
  and these feelings were deepened because he looked upon her as a link with
  that pleasant and cherished memory of another woman.</p>

  <p>"You come from Heidelberg?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Some weeks ago I left the Castle, Highness," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I was weary of my exile."</p>

  <p>"Exile?"</p>

  <p>"I am a Fleming, Highness."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes!" He closed his eyes again and once more was for a little while
  silent.</p>

  <p>"How goes life at Heidelberg?" he added presently.</p>

  <p>"Highness, they are all sad for the fight at Mooker Heyde."</p>

  <p>"The Elector would feel that, yes," answered William slowly.</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes full as he spoke and looked at Rénée.</p>

  <p>She was gazing at him steadily, her hands folded in her lap; slowly the
  Prince began to realize her personality&mdash;so far she had been but a
  memory, a name, some one from the Castle at Heidelberg.</p>

  <p>"How have you come again into my service?" he asked with a faint
  smile.</p>

  <p>She answered calmly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I came to Rotterdam when I heard that your Highness was here,
  sick&mdash;your steward is one who was with you formerly and so knows me. And
  so I obtained permission to wait on your Highness, seeing that you had no
  women in your household beyond a rough serving-maid."</p>

  <p>"My household has long lacked women," replied William. "You, more than any
  other, know my long loneliness."</p>

  <p>"As much as a man can be lonely you have been, Highness, I know."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

  <p>"Because a woman can be lonely as no man ever is, Prince."</p>

  <p>"A woman?" again his thoughts went to the Castle at Heidelberg and the
  young exile there.</p>

  <p>"A woman can have no great occupation to distract her loneliness."</p>

  <p>"Mothers and wives have much to do if they are earnest of soul and good of
  heart."</p>

  <p>"Mothers and wives are not lonely," returned Rénée with a sudden flash in
  her large eyes. "I speak of women who are neither&mdash;or who have been and
  are now bereaved."</p>

  <p>And still William thought of Charlotte de Bourbon among strangers, a
  dependent, and estranged from all her relatives&mdash;surely her loneliness
  was greater than his.</p>

  <p>He moved his head impatiently, turning his eyes from Rénée and looking at
  the blue silk curtains in which the sunlight lay.</p>

  <p>"Where are all the others?" he asked in a feeble voice.</p>

  <p>"Does not your Highness remember that but a few hours ago you sent them
  away on various errands&mdash;soon after you received the dispatch from
  Leiden?"</p>

  <p>"Leiden," muttered the Prince, turning to look at her again. "Ah, God,
  Leiden&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Leiden holds out, Highness."</p>

  <p>"But how long can she hold out?" With a great effort he raised himself on
  his elbow. "Will the dykes never be cut&mdash;will Boisat never sail?"</p>

  <p>"Your Highness must get well&mdash;for on you all depends."</p>

  <p>"On me!" he laughed weakly. "And I am so useless. There needs," he added,
  "another, stronger than I and of greater influence. Therefore have I thought
  of France. Or England."</p>

  <p>"No Prince from France or England could be as beloved as is your Highness
  in the Netherlands," said Rénée.</p>

  <p>"But I have not the power to repay this love," answered William.</p>

  <p>Rénée rose, still looking at him with earnest eager eyes. "Believe that
  you will accomplish that to which you have put your hand, Prince," she
  replied.</p>

  <p>He gazed at her as steadily as she gazed at him; he seemed to recognize
  something strong and loyal and steadfast in this woman; something on which
  one might depend.</p>

  <p>And this sense of her strength and faithfulness touched him as with a
  great comfort in the feebleness of his sickness and moved him to open his
  heart on a subject on which it had hitherto remained closed.</p>

  <p>"You were the companion of Mademoiselle de Bourbon?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Rénée very slightly drew her brows together. "Yes," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"You loved her, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"No," answered Rénée, "why should I love her, Prince?" she added with a
  certain fierceness.</p>

  <p>"She seemed to me one who might&mdash;" he paused, and in his turn frowned
  a little.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;inspire love?" finished Rénée calmly.</p>

  <p>"One at least gentle and unfortunate&mdash;and courageous," said
  William.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Rénée assented, "she has those qualities and she is, I suppose,
  unfortunate."</p>

  <p>"Was there no talk of her espousals?"</p>

  <p>"With Count Louis?"</p>

  <p>"With any&mdash;my brother, no."</p>

  <p>"No name was ever mentioned but his&mdash;a dowerless Princess does not so
  easily find a husband," replied Rénée.</p>

  <p>"There is a sweet wife there," said the Prince.</p>

  <p>A faint pallor overspread the face of the woman who listened; her heart
  seemed to shrink and shrivel as under an icy touch.</p>

  <p>She put out her hand and rested it on the low mantel-shelf where stood the
  shining brass pots and candlesticks. Then, speaking slowly, she answered
  William's thoughts more than his words.</p>

  <p>"Does your Highness mean to ask for the hand of Mademoiselle?"</p>

  <p>A flush rose to the Prince's thin face.</p>

  <p>"You would not think me mad if I had that intention?" he answered.</p>

  <p>Closer closed the heart of Rénée; she watched with what eagerness he
  welcomed the boldness with which she had put into words what he perhaps had
  been shy to even think; she saw his distant look and knew that he had
  forgotten her save as some one who knew Charlotte de Bourbon.</p>

  <p>"I am worn out," he added in a tired voice, "old before my
  time&mdash;penniless also and encumbered with obligations and debts."</p>

  <p>"The Princess holds no better fortune," returned Rénée dully.</p>

  <p>He glanced at her gratefully.</p>

  <p>"You know her," he began, then paused. "Has she ever spoken of me?" he
  added at length.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Rénée forced herself to the truth, she was looking down that she
  might not see the eager interest with which he awaited her answer.</p>

  <p>"And in a kindly fashion?"</p>

  <p>"With admiration, Prince."</p>

  <p>William noticed the constraint of her tone but did not remotely guess the
  cause.</p>

  <p>He raised himself in bed and spoke with animation.</p>

  <p>"I would not force your confidence, I have no right to ask.&mdash;but this
  thing has been much in my mind of late&mdash;and now surely we may consider
  each other as a friend," he smiled, looking at her with great charm and
  sweetness, "and you can do me a service."</p>

  <p>Rénée was silent; she did not raise her eyes nor move.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," insisted the Prince, "if you believe, from your knowledge of
  Mademoiselle, that she would listen to my addresses?"</p>

  <p>Rénée was still silent; his humility stung her; why should he be humble
  before Charlotte de Bourbon?</p>

  <p>"Will you not?" added William, "answer me?"</p>

  <p>Rénée looked at him; it was in her power to make him believe any lie she
  liked, for he would never suspect her of any motive for telling an untruth,
  she might assure him that the affections of the Princess were engaged, or
  that she was indifferent towards marriage.</p>

  <p>But as she looked at him, eager, wistful, waiting for her answer, the
  truth rushed to her lips. She moved towards him with a sudden
  tenderness&mdash;almost a maternal tenderness.</p>

  <p>"Rest assured," she said, "that Mademoiselle de Bourbon loves you."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-10"
     id="ch2-10"></a>X. &mdash; THE CHILD OF THE REFUGEE</h2>

  <p class="first">Soon after the Prince's secretary returned and with him
  Cornelius Van Meirop.</p>

  <p>William, raising himself up in bed, began discussing the prospects for the
  relief of Leiden and his answer to the appeal of that city.</p>

  <p>Rénée moved from the room, and as she stood at the door she lingered a
  moment and looked back at the dark thin face of the Prince propped by the
  white bed pillows, looked at it intently as if to impress those features on
  her mind and went out into the sunny street.</p>

  <p>The shallow steps of the simple house led to the wide flagged causeway
  that edged a deep canal. Full-leaved elm trees shaded both water and stone,
  where the sun penetrated the deep leafage it shone in vivid flakes in the
  ripples of the canal and in patches of gold on the worn stones and smooth
  trodden bricks.</p>

  <p>The air was very warm and full of a distant murmur of noise, voices and
  all the interwoven sounds of a city. But here there was peace.</p>

  <p>Through the open window of the house opposite Rénée could see the
  serving-maid polishing a brass dish.</p>

  <p>While the only person in sight along the vista of the canal-way was a boy
  who floated a kite which fluttered feebly in the slight summer breeze.</p>

  <p>She leant against one of the elm trees and looked up at the pots of
  geranium which marked the window of the Prince's room.</p>

  <p>Strange that he should have chosen her as his confidante and from his own
  lips have confirmed what she had already guessed, the unspoken understanding
  between himself and Charlotte de Bourbon.</p>

  <p>So he would marry again, and had already chosen his wife&mdash;a woman
  who, as Rénée knew, would not hesitate to accept him.</p>

  <p>And she, the escaped nun, the exile, who had seen him but on one occasion
  and knew him only by hearsay, would be his companion, his confidante
  constantly with him, the sharer of his difficulties, his troubles and of that
  ultimate triumph in which Rénée never doubted.</p>

  <p>It was natural that this should be so&mdash;natural that he should choose
  this wife, a woman of his own faith, who had suffered for that faith in much
  the same way as he had suffered, it was natural that her loneliness and
  exile, her unprotected state and the courage with which she had maintained
  her conviction and her liberty in front of the opposition of all her kin,
  should appeal to him, as it was natural that she should make a hero of the
  man who was the champion of the cause and the religion she had embraced.</p>

  <p>Yet the confirmation of what she had guessed ever since her last interview
  with Charlotte de Bourbon, came with a certain shock.</p>

  <p>Some things cannot be discounted; Rénée could no more have spared herself
  the pang she had that day received than she could have spared herself the
  pang of the Prince's death by knowing beforehand that he was doomed. Yet no
  hopes had been dashed to the ground, no prospects blighted&mdash;the Prince
  could never have been more to her than he was whether or no he had met
  Mademoiselle de Bourbon.</p>

  <p>The gulf between them would be no wider than it was now, they could not be
  further removed than they had ever been. Yet, the sting, the grief and the
  bitterness remained and could not be argued away.</p>

  <p>And in her heart she knew that Charlotte de Bourbon, as woman compared to
  woman, was of no finer quality than herself.&mdash;and she doubted if she
  could bring him as much devotion, as much love.</p>

  <p>But she was the woman on whom his eye had fallen, the wife of his
  choice&mdash;while Rénée had always been the waiting-woman&mdash;a part of
  the background.</p>

  <p>And circumstances had again combined to cast her into his service, to
  bring her into his presence as a dependent; she had not meant this to be so,
  when she had left Heidelberg it had been with no idea of seeing the Prince
  again, till knowing him ill and even lonely she had thought again of nothing
  but his service.</p>

  <p>And with this result&mdash;that she had been forced to tell him that he
  had nothing to fear from Charlotte de Bourbon.</p>

  <p>She would never forget his look of amaze and shame at having, as he
  thought, forced her confidence, the way the blood had rushed to his face, his
  quick attempt to turn aside her words, to make a jest of the whole
  matter&mdash;and yet, all the while, as Rénée well knew, he fixed in his
  heart a hope and a resolve&mdash;firmly and for ever.</p>

  <p>"He will ask her hand on the first occasion that offers," thought Rénée,
  "and I may hear her marriage bells and see her arrive to meet him."</p>

  <p>She tried to soothe the dull sickness of her spirit by thinking of all the
  sorrow and misfortune abroad in the world in this time of horror.</p>

  <p>Of the starving women in Leiden who had to watch their children, of the
  maidens who had to see their lovers go forth, never to return, of the women
  whose husbands were taken from them, the exiled and defeated, the crying
  children, the laments of age and feebleness in this time of war.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Rénée as if never again would the world be bright and
  gorgeous, never again would youth go gaily forth to greet the spring, and
  those dear to each other remain united in happy homes.</p>

  <p>As her thoughts ran thus she looked at the boy with the kite, and the idea
  came to her that perhaps this child would live to see the peace she imagined
  for ever lost.</p>

  <p>And this peace-once achieved, would last and blossom in an age which in
  all the present unhappiness of which she was part would be forgotten.</p>

  <p>"What avail will that be to me?" thought Rénée. "I shall not have
  helped&mdash;I am no use to any&mdash;I will pass away, the children of the
  future will play over my dust."</p>

  <p>She walked slowly along the causeway, thinking of her own story interwoven
  with the great events among which she moved, of the Prince, whose life had
  come so near to her yet from whom she was for ever separated, of the nation
  coming, with throes and agonies, into being about her, of whom she was part,
  yet in which somehow she seemed to have no interest.</p>

  <p>Her enthusiasm was dead, her patriotism did not warm her; she had been
  exiled too long to any longer feel pleasure in her native land, or any longer
  feel the sense of home.</p>

  <p>Her religion had become vague; the convictions for which her parents had
  died no longer seemed near and vital but far away and feeble.</p>

  <p>In that moment she desired death; she thought how strange it was that one
  always had the means of death at hand and so seldom the will or the spirit to
  achieve this last means of deliverance.</p>

  <p>Why had she so long endured life when at any moment she could have escaped
  from it.</p>

  <p>Was it because some hope had lurked deep in her heart amid all her
  hopelessness&mdash;that there was still some use for her in the world?</p>

  <p>She was still young&mdash;strange as it seemed to her to think it, life
  might yet hold something for her&mdash;some work, some duty, perhaps even
  some pleasure.</p>

  <p>In this flutter of hope, youth and health asserted itself.</p>

  <p>The warm air was about her, the sun overhead and the green leaves, even to
  her dulled spirit these things brought some comfort.</p>

  <p>No passer-by would have thought the beautiful gracious woman, walking with
  leisured step in the sunshine, was so near despair, for the calm of long
  habit appeared the calm of serenity.</p>

  <p>She reached the end of the canal and turned into another street of a
  poorer sort.</p>

  <p>As she glanced down this a poor funeral met her eye; the coffin, covered
  by a simple black cloth, was borne aloft on the shoulders of four men.</p>

  <p>There were no followers and no flowers&mdash;only in the doorway of the
  house from which the coffin had been carried stood an old woman with a bundle
  in her arms.</p>

  <p>The desire for some distraction from her thoughts, moved Rénée to go up to
  this woman and ask whose body it was the four old men were carrying away.</p>

  <p>The withered creature looked at her with the patient friendliness of the
  unfortunate.</p>

  <p>"A woman," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Young?"</p>

  <p>"Eighteen years."</p>

  <p>Rénée gazed after the slender coffin.</p>

  <p>"Why did she die?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows? He was with Count Louis' army and she never heard of him since
  Mooker Heyde," was the answer.</p>

  <p>"But Mooker Heyde&mdash;that is already some time ago," said Rénée.</p>

  <p>"Ah, there was the baby coming, she lived for that. Then when it was born
  she lost her strength all at once&mdash;and went out. Like a lamp without
  oil."</p>

  <p>"And the baby? faltered Rénée.</p>

  <p>"A fortnight old, to-day. A girl."</p>

  <p>The funeral had now passed out of sight; Rénée looked down at the bundle
  in the old woman's shrunken arms.</p>

  <p>"Is this the baby?" she asked with a certain curious sense of awe.</p>

  <p>The old woman raised the white shawl with pride. Rénée looked within.</p>

  <p>Wrapped in an inner covering of white wool and linen lay a little baby
  asleep.</p>

  <p>She wore a close cap of Flemish lace, the deep border of which fell over
  and shaded her minute face, which was of a marvellous delicacy and beauty.
  Her complexion was of a pearly fairness, a tiny hand, with the fingers
  outspread, lay on the edge of the shawl.</p>

  <p>As Rénée gazed she felt as if her heart had been suddenly broken within
  her; her limbs trembled and the tears rushed to her eyes. The heartrending
  serenity of the baby seemed to her unendurable.</p>

  <p>"Might I hold her in my arms?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Come into the house," returned the old woman readily. "I am alone and
  there is much to do. Sickness makes work."</p>

  <p>Rénée followed her into the dark room, where the green lattices were drawn
  over the windows, excluding the sun, which only filtered here and there into
  the dusky atmosphere.</p>

  <p>A door stood open into an inner room; set in the wall of this was the
  smooth white bed; here too the shutters were closed and the chamber was
  filled with a golden darkness.</p>

  <p>Rénée looked about her; the white porcelain stove was lit, and before it
  were arranged the child's swaddling clothes, newly washed.</p>

  <p>At the other end of the room was a wicker cradle filled with soft
  cushions.</p>

  <p>"You are the grandmother?" asked Rénée.</p>

  <p>"No. I am a stranger. They fled from Haarlem before the siege. Then he
  went to fight and she took lodgings with me. They had saved a little
  money."</p>

  <p>"All gone now?"</p>

  <p>"Some time since," replied the old woman quietly. Rénée looked at the
  little garments by the stove.</p>

  <p>"And the baby?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I do what I can. But I am poor. My son is at the war and does not come
  back. The other works at an armourer's, but the pay is not good now."</p>

  <p>The old woman spoke with a certain wistful eagerness as if she ventured to
  hope that this stranger who belonged obviously to the better sort might be
  interested in her miserable fortunes, hitherto too obscure and too ordinary
  to attract the attention of any.</p>

  <p>"And the baby?" repeated Rénée.</p>

  <p>"My son wants to send her to the hospital&mdash;I would keep her if I
  could. The pastor says he may find some one to take her. He paid for the
  funeral, but he too is poor."</p>

  <p>And she suddenly smiled as if there was something diverting in this almost
  universal poverty and misery.</p>

  <p>Rénée seated herself in a wand chair by the cradle. "Keep her for the
  time; I will think of something," she said.</p>

  <p>The old woman crossed the room and placed the baby in Rénée's arms.</p>

  <p>"You will take her perhaps?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am not rich."</p>

  <p>"Married, with little ones of your own?"</p>

  <p>Rénée shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I come from Heidelberg," she answered. "I was one of the Electress's
  women. Now I am in employment in the house where lodges the Prince."</p>

  <p>"Ah, the Prince!" said the old woman. "Do you think him a great man,
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you do? My son thinks Count Louis was the one; he maintains he would
  have saved us all if he had lived. Aye, that was a black day at Mooker
  Heyde!"</p>

  <p>"The Prince will save us all," returned Rénée earnestly.</p>

  <p>"God, He knows," said the old woman; she went into the inner room and
  began to rearrange the bed.</p>

  <p>Now that she was alone Rénée timidly raised the baby and laid its face
  against her own.</p>

  <p>With a hand that trembled she touched the tiny head, the clenched hand,
  the soft cheeks.</p>

  <p>The baby moved and with a little cry awoke. The old woman came
  hurrying.</p>

  <p>"You do not know how to hold her," she said indulgently. "Nay, I will not
  hurt her," pleaded Rénée.</p>

  <p>The baby closed her eyes again and moved her head to and fro.</p>

  <p>"She is hungry," said Rénée, with quick instinct interpreting the
  searching movement.</p>

  <p>"I would have lived if the child had been mine," she added almost
  fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Ah, she thought of her husband, that girl, and so she died.'</p>

  <p>"But it is not certain that he is dead?"</p>

  <p>"Who survived from Mooker Heyde?"</p>

  <p>As she spoke the old woman took the child from Rénée's arms.</p>

  <p>"She must have her food and go to sleep," she added, "before my son comes
  in."</p>

  <p>Rénée rose.</p>

  <p>"I will come in to-morrow and talk to you of the child," she said. "What
  is the name?"</p>

  <p>"Van Posen, they called themselves. She was a goldsmith's daughter, she
  said."</p>

  <p>"And the name of the baby?"</p>

  <p>"She was christened Wilhelmina, because, the pastor said, of the
  Prince."</p>

  <p>"I will come to-morrow," repeated Rénée.</p>

  <p>She left the house and returned with a quick step to the Prince's
  house.</p>

  <p>On the dark stairway she met William's secretary. He looked at her
  keenly.</p>

  <p>"You seem as if you had had good news," he said, smiling it</p>

  <p>Rénée smiled too.</p>

  <p>"What of Leiden?" she counter-questioned.</p>

  <p>"Boisat makes progress&mdash;if only the city can hold out!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-11"
     id="ch2-11"></a>XI. &mdash; AT DELFT</h2>

  <p class="first">The days of a hot summer passed into the days of a stormy
  autumn and still Leiden was not relieved. The ocean had now overflowed the
  pierced dykes and was coming slowly to the relief of the beleaguered
  city.</p>

  <p>But too slowly for the starving thousands in Leiden, who daily climbed the
  ramparts and the ancient tower of Hengist to gaze across the waste of waters
  for a sight of the sails of the fleet of Admiral Boisat. But the winds were
  contrary: Boisat was stranded at North Aa, in a depth of water not sufficient
  to float his smallest vessel, and the powerful forts which guarded Leiden,
  such as Zoeterwowde and Samnen, still remained in the possession of the
  Spaniards.</p>

  <p>And though the patriots had made great advances, such as seizing the
  Sand-scheiding, there still remained in their way great obstacles, such as
  the mere by the city, the redoubts manned by the enemy and the ridges
  bristling with cannon which protected the approach to Leiden.</p>

  <p>And the sea hung back and only slow and reluctant waves lapped the ruined
  crops, the abandoned houses, the desolate farmsteads, which seemed as if they
  had been sacrificed for nothing, while the fleet of Holland remained idle and
  impotent within sight of the starving town.</p>

  <p>The Prince dragged himself from his bed to come on board Admiral Boisat's
  ship and inspect the gallant and desperate means being taken to relieve the
  despairing city.</p>

  <p>He saw that all that human endeavour could do had been done and nothing
  could help now but the ocean, and he returned to Delft sad but not
  despairing.</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde, released from prison on parole, was with him and lodged
  with him in the quiet house at Delft which was now William's home.</p>

  <p>The Prince loved his friend and trusted his affection, but no longer could
  he put faith in his fortitude and courage.</p>

  <p>The continued misfortunes of the patriot cause, the seeming hopelessness
  of the task William had undertaken, the loss of all those stout hearts who
  had lent such a glory to the opening conflict, and his own personal
  experience of imprisonment at the hands of the Spaniards had combined to turn
  Ste. Aldegonde, once so ardent and confident, into a waverer and a doubter;
  only the Prince's personal influence over him prevented him from retiring in
  despair from an active part in the conflict.</p>

  <p>He returned now from the visit to the fleet profoundly depressed.</p>

  <p>The Prince, with that sense of humour no misfortune could destroy, laughed
  at his gloomy face.</p>

  <p>"Thou art not in Leiden," he said as they sat at supper; "there is no need
  to starve."</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde sighed.</p>

  <p>"You have ever too light a temper, Highness," he rejoined.</p>

  <p>"Had my disposition been heavy it would have sunk beneath my misfortunes,"
  returned the Prince. "Let me smile when I can, Ste. Aldegonde."</p>

  <p>He leant back in the dark carved chair, and with a little movement of
  weariness, his head sunk against the black leathern cushions.</p>

  <p>He was still pale and haggard from his recent illness, from which indeed
  he had hardly recovered, the comely face was thin, the eyes lacked something
  of their wonted fire and the white hairs had appeared thickly among the
  chestnut locks.</p>

  <p>His dress was that of a burgher, grey cloth and riding boots and a little
  ruffled collar of native needlework.</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde looked at him and was not greatly encouraged.</p>

  <p>He thought of the magnificent cavalier, rich and young, who had set out
  with his companions to break the power of Spain and in the quiet tired figure
  before him he could see nothing but the signs of failure.</p>

  <p>William still smiled, looking at him as if he divined his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"We shall conquer yet," he said.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness is indomitable."</p>

  <p>"You saw those Zeelanders to-day," continued the Prince, "you noticed the
  spirit of those men? They would sooner all perish, man by man, than abandon
  Leiden."</p>

  <p>"They will not relieve Leiden."</p>

  <p>"They will," said William. "They will."</p>

  <p>"Does your Highness think that the city can hold out till the wind
  changes?"</p>

  <p>"I do."</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Have they not already captured fort after fort and driven the enemy from
  the great dyke."</p>

  <p>"There are other forts&mdash;and the men."</p>

  <p>"Yes," responded the Prince, "there are always difficulties in every
  enterprise. But we," he looked steadily into his friend's face, "are not here
  to enumerate them."</p>

  <p>"God grant that your fortitude and hopefulness will be rewarded," returned
  Ste. Aldegonde in a moved voice.</p>

  <p>"I have never," replied William quietly, "doubted the ultimate victory.
  But if we are doomed to perish, in the name of God be it so!"</p>

  <p>He turned his head and looked out of the window at the quiet street where
  the last sunlight lay peacefully on brickwork and canal.</p>

  <p>"At least," he added, "we shall have the honour to have done what no
  nation ever did before us&mdash;for we have defended and maintained ourselves
  in a small country against the tremendous efforts of a powerful enemy. And as
  long as the poor inhabitants here, even if they be deserted by all the world,
  hold firm, it will cost the Spaniards the half of Spain, in men and money,
  before they can make an end of us."</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde was, if only for the moment, and against his own private
  judgment, convinced. When the Prince spoke, even the waverers were silenced,
  even the most timid was reassured.</p>

  <p>William looked again towards his friend.</p>

  <p>"Why are you so sad? Do you think it nothing to have been born in these
  honourable times?"</p>

  <p>"I would," replied Ste. Aldegonde, "have been born before these troubles
  began.</p>

  <p>"Or a hundred years hence," smiled William, "when they are all
  forgiven&mdash;or, perhaps worse, are abroad for our grandchildren to battle
  with. But you are strong, Ste. Aldegonde. Humanity has no greater privilege
  than this&mdash;. to help in the establishment of liberty and truth."</p>

  <p>"And I echo the Apostle&mdash;' what is truth '&mdash;and add what is
  liberty? Philip holds it God's truth that we are rebel traitors, swine fit
  only for the shambles. And that liberty consists in his liberty to do as he
  wishes."</p>

  <p>"Liberty and truth," replied William, "are understood by the poorest and
  humblest, they know what is real liberty and what is genuine truth and for
  these things are prepared to die. These and not the standards of the Escurial
  are right."</p>

  <p>"I think the King would die for his belief as cheerfully as any
  Calvinist."</p>

  <p>"Aye," replied William. "Tyranny has its courage, and wrong its fortitude.
  But leave these matters, where we confuse ourselves with terms. I will talk
  to you on another theme."</p>

  <p>As he spoke the Prince bent his steady eyes on his friend. "There is," he
  continued, "a matter I have had much in mind of late."</p>

  <p>He paused thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"And now the time has come to speak of it," he added. "Highness, you
  arouse my curiosity," said Ste. Aldegonde, leaning forward a little across
  the supper table. "I shall surprise you," answered William; he suddenly
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"It is a gay matter, then, Highness?"</p>

  <p>"It is this&mdash;I have a mind to marry."</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde was more than surprised, he was startled, almost
  shocked.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness thinks of marriage!"</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde evolved a thousand aspects of the case in his
  mind&mdash;William's previous marriage, the fact that the wretched Anne of
  Saxony still lived and was by many still considered as the Prince's
  wife&mdash;the dissension and bitterness the marriage of the Prince was
  likely to cause among Anne's German relations, whom it was most essential to
  keep in a good humour, and the general comment, not to say scandal, that was
  likely to be everywhere aroused.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, as Ste. Aldegonde was quick to see, if the Prince
  married politically and wisely, his cause might be benefited, his influence
  extended, his coffers filled.</p>

  <p>"You disapprove?" smiled the Prince.</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;I wonder."</p>

  <p>"At one of my age and fortunes seeking a wife?"</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde warmed to the defence of his friend and Prince.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness is yet young and your fortunes are such as any would be
  proud to share."</p>

  <p>"My forty-two years weigh heavily upon me," replied William, "and I can
  give no marriage portion, nay, am burdened with debts and settlements."</p>

  <p>"A good dowry would repair these."</p>

  <p>"This lady has no dowry."</p>

  <p>"The bride is chosen then!" exclaimed Aldegonde in amaze.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied William, "I do not speak of any marriage, but of a
  particular marriage."</p>

  <p>"Politics&mdash;" began Ste. Aldegonde.</p>

  <p>"For once," interrupted the Prince, "you must leave politics out of the
  question."</p>

  <p>"Then why," asked the other in unfeigned astonishment, "should your
  Highness marry at all?"</p>

  <p>The Prince slightly flushed.</p>

  <p>"For affection, Ste. Aldegonde."</p>

  <p>"Has it never occurred to you," added the Prince almost wistfully, "that I
  am very lonely?"</p>

  <p>His friend had no answer; certainly he had given little thought to
  William's inner life; he had always considered him as the leader, the man of
  affairs, the soldier, he had never given a thought to the other side of the
  man, who, warm-hearted, must do without affection, who must be homeless, who,
  kindly and sociable in disposition, must spend many sad hours alone; he had
  never thought what it must mean to William to reflect on the misery of his
  last marriage, the outrage inflicted on him by his half-insane wife, the pain
  and humiliation of her desertion.</p>

  <p>But now that the Prince spoke so, Ste. Aldegonde reflected on the
  matter&mdash;why should not this man be as other men?</p>

  <p>"You marvel at me," said William, who had been watching him keenly.</p>

  <p>"Nay, I was endeavouring to understand."</p>

  <p>"I love the lady," said William simply.</p>

  <p>His life of late years had brought him so little into contact with any
  woman of his own rank, that Ste. Aldegonde was completely puzzled.</p>

  <p>"When has your Highness found time for love-making?" he asked with a
  little smile.</p>

  <p>"There has been no love-making," answered the Prince gently.</p>

  <p>"But your Highness seems sure of her consent," said Ste. Aldegonde.</p>

  <p>Again William slightly flushed.</p>

  <p>"She is of the same temper as myself&mdash;the same faith&mdash;her
  circumstances are even the same&mdash;an exile."</p>

  <p>Still Ste. Aldegonde could not think who this lady might be.</p>

  <p>"Why does your Highness give me this incomplete confidence?" he demanded
  bluntly.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you all," returned William, "for I wish you to be my emissary
  to ask the hand of this gentlewoman."</p>

  <p>"A poor proxy," smiled Ste. Aldegonde ruefully, "I have forgotten Court
  ways."</p>

  <p>William slightly hesitated; the name of Charlotte de Bourbon had been so
  long treasured in the silent depths of his heart as something sacred that he
  disliked to divulge it even to the man whom he had chosen to be his
  ambassador to his beloved.</p>

  <p>"It is Mademoiselle de Bourbon," he said at length. If Ste. Aldegonde was
  amazed before he was now completely stupefied.</p>

  <p>He stared at William the Prince, so utterly impossible, from every point
  of view, seemed the match that he proposed; Ste. Aldegonde was a Calvinist,
  but even to him Charlotte de Bourbon was a renegade nun who had broken her
  vows&mdash;then, her name had been persistently associated with Louis of
  Nassau, then, again, she was friendless as well as penniless and could bring
  no friends, while she would certainly make, by her marriage with William, a
  host of enemies, she was estranged from her father and the Court of France
  and living on the charity of the Elector&mdash;in brief, the marriage was as
  impolitic and rash as any could well be.</p>

  <p>William was prepared for this astonishment&mdash;he looked into Ste.
  Aldegonde's amazed face and laughed.</p>

  <p>"I know your arguments," he said good-naturedly, "so spare them!"</p>

  <p>"Your Highness has considered&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Everything."</p>

  <p>"And the advantages of this match?"</p>

  <p>"For once," returned William, "I would consult my own inclinations."</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde was silent.</p>

  <p>"I sold myself once for wealth&mdash;once for political advantage,"
  continued William sternly, "well for me that I am blessed in my son. You know
  something of what I have suffered from this Saxony marriage. Now I want
  peace&mdash;at least in my home."</p>

  <p>"And this lady will give it to you?"</p>

  <p>"I do believe it, Ste. Aldegonde."</p>

  <p>William rose and pulled the bell cord and when the serving-maid came asked
  for lights; he wished to cut short the protests and arguments he knew that
  his friend was burning to make.</p>

  <p>"You will&mdash;as soon as may be&mdash;undertake this mission to
  Heidelberg," he added.</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde made a gesture of despair.</p>

  <p>"You know what will be said!"</p>

  <p>"I can guess."</p>

  <p>"No one will support you!"</p>

  <p>"I am prepared for it."</p>

  <p>"Even Count John will disapprove."</p>

  <p>"Ste. Aldegonde&mdash;I have told you, this time I please myself."</p>

  <p>He spoke smilingly yet with a touch of authority, and his friend could say
  no more.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2-12"
     id="ch2-12"></a>XII. &mdash; FORTUNE TURNS</h2>

  <p class="first">Rénée Le Meuny had a room in the top story of a house in the
  Cathedral square at Delft and when the bells rang they filled it with
  sound.</p>

  <p>It was the house of the verger, and he was old and his wife bedridden, so
  Rénée helped them in the house and in the church.</p>

  <p>And in her leisure she worked the fine lace that she had learnt to do in
  Brussels and for which there was a good price when it could be sent to the
  markets in England and France.</p>

  <p>So Rénée made her poor living her life had been always so circumscribed,
  her tastes so modest that she did not notice her present restriction.</p>

  <p>Her poverty did not gall her, for she had all that she wanted.</p>

  <p>And, after the long dissatisfaction of her life she seemed at last to have
  found peace, for the wide room with the smooth sloping floor and latticed
  window was shared by the refugee's baby.</p>

  <p>Rénée, when she left the service of the Prince in Rotterdam had taken the
  child with her; the old woman had been glad to be rid of the embarrassment,
  and there had been an outbreak of the plague in the city rendering the air
  infected and unsafe for the little creature.</p>

  <p>So Rénée had brought the baby to Delft, leaving her name with the
  armourer's mother in case any one should come to claim the child.</p>

  <p>But this was unlikely indeed; little Wilhelmina seemed as certainly
  without friends or relatives as was Rénée herself.</p>

  <p>An unbounded tenderness for the baby filled Willie's heart.</p>

  <p>She took an interest in things that before she had not even noticed; in
  dresses, and laces and ribbons, because the baby must wear them, in children,
  because presently the baby would be as these; in the humble work of the
  house, the sweeping and cleaning, because everything must be kept sweet about
  the baby, in the fine work of her own fingers, the money for which would be
  needed soon when the baby grew bigger and needed, ah, so many things.</p>

  <p>A girl was hired to take the baby out, but never further than the square,
  so that Rénée, seated at the window at her lace-making, might see them every
  time she raised her eyes.</p>

  <p>It was wonderful how the old couple who had lost their all in the war,
  noticed and soon loved this tiny stranger, how soon she became the centre of
  interest in the quiet old house, the one pleasure for so many sad hearts.</p>

  <p>It pleased her to go in the morning into the great church and help this
  old man clean and sweep and stack the huge stoves with wood ready for
  lighting a little before the service, for though it was yet early in the
  autumn the church was cold, especially in the evenings.</p>

  <p>The church, stripped of all Popish decorations, the walls whitewashed from
  vaulted roof to floor, the windows with plain glass instead of coloured, was
  very wonderful to Rénée.</p>

  <p>Her people had been among those whose blood had gone to pay for this
  liberty, for the freedom now enjoyed by the city of Delft and the worshippers
  who daily gathered in the cathedral of Saint Ursula.</p>

  <p>The whitewashed interior, the unshaded windows, which filled every corner
  with a cold clear light, the hard benches and pulpit of plain dark wood all
  were to Rénée beautiful, for they seemed to her part of her
  inheritance&mdash;and one for which she had dearly paid.</p>

  <p>And gradually she withdrew herself from her long isolation of mind and
  spirit and came more in touch with her fellow creatures, sharing their
  anxieties and hopes.</p>

  <p>She would mingle with the other women after service and listen to their
  talk until she drew a certain comfort from these other lives passing so near
  her own and filled with cares and sorrows so much the same.</p>

  <p>Often she saw the Prince, for he was much in Delft these days; occupied
  mostly for the relief of Leiden, which was yet beleaguered by the Spaniards
  despite all the efforts of Admiral Boisat.</p>

  <p>But William never saw her; she had disappeared from his house in Rotterdam
  before he had recovered from the sickness and they had not spoken since he
  had asked her of Charlotte de Bourbon.</p>

  <p>When he attended church Rénée watched his passing from her window and then
  followed, when concealed by one of the white pillars she could watch him
  throughout the short service; and before he rose to go she would slip away
  and from her window mark his return.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, in the evening, when the baby was asleep she would carry her
  down in her wicker cradle and put her beside the verger's wife, who lay
  patient under her white linen coverlet, and leaving these two together she
  would go softly from the house, cross the dark square, pass the bridge over
  the canal and stand beneath the dwelling of the Prince.</p>

  <p>Sometimes she would see him at a window, or returning late, nearly always
  she saw a light in his room.</p>

  <p>If it chanced that he had left Delft and she did not know it, and coming
  there she found the house in darkness, she experienced a curious sense of
  disappointment.</p>

  <p>She knew that he was contemplating a marriage with Mademoiselle de
  Bourbon.</p>

  <p>The matter was common knowledge and she had had it direct from the mouth
  of the Prince's secretary, whom she had met by chance.</p>

  <p>But it would not be yet, he had added, till Leiden was relieved the Prince
  would think of nothing else, and he wished to see his cause on a sure way to
  success before he thought of taking a wife&mdash;but next year&mdash;if
  things were happier&mdash;</p>

  <p>Rénée was no longer disturbed by the thought of Charlotte de Bourbon, but
  she was glad that she had definitely severed her life from hers.</p>

  <p>She felt her present existence happiness compared with that she had led at
  Heidelberg, though there she had been one of a Court and now she was little
  better than a maidservant.</p>

  <p>The last days of September were cold and stormy and Rénée had to go into
  the church before the services to light the stoves and draw the heavy green
  curtains across those portions of the church not used, so as to make a little
  protection against the draughts.</p>

  <p>There was one curtain across the space where there had once stood the
  altar and the lady chapel; this was large enough for a church in itself and
  beneath were burial vaults.</p>

  <p>The verger remembered when it had all been canopied in gold tapestry and
  the altar had been dressed in purple and scarlet with candlesticks in
  Florentine copper, and the Host in a white shrine curtained with
  dove-coloured silk. And there had been seats for the monks in carved wood,
  lamps that burnt day and night.</p>

  <p>And the church was now bare and cold and white. "It is well," said
  Rénée.</p>

  <p>It was the first Sunday in October. The sullen stillness following a great
  storm had fallen over the land.</p>

  <p>Huge masses of dark clouds lay piled on the horizon, a chill wind blew
  across the flat country and ruffled the waters of the canals.</p>

  <p>Rénée was standing at the door of the church, and she shuddered in her
  grey cloth cloak; though it was yet early in the autumn the summer seemed
  very far away and a long leaden winter seemed to stretch ahead in an endless
  succession of short dull days and long stormy nights.</p>

  <p>Rénée had rejoiced in the storm, because she knew that the strong easterly
  wind was driving the sea across the broken dykes and sending the ships of
  Admiral Boisat to the very gates of Leiden.</p>

  <p>But these hopes, which she shared in common with the entire population,
  had been destroyed by a letter a carrier pigeon had brought from Boisat to
  the Prince and which told him of new difficulties, and announced that the
  storm had lulled before he had been able to pass the great mere and the
  almost impregnable forts which guarded the entrance to the city and unless
  another tempest should arise he would be obliged to make a long detour round
  Leiden, which would take more time than he believed the city could
  endure.</p>

  <p>She shared the firm belief of the Prince that the fate of Leiden was
  representative of the fate of the little states which were just struggling
  into independent existence.</p>

  <p>If that beautiful city fell there was little to hope for the rest of
  Holland.</p>

  <p>If, on the other hand, Leiden should triumphantly resist, if Admiral
  Boisat should succeed in breaking the leaguer and driving off the besiegers,
  then the arms of the Netherlanders would have secured a victory such as had
  not fallen to their lot since the capture of Brill, and one that would be as
  instantaneous in its effects, material and moral, as had been that action of
  the Sea Beggars, which had meant the turn of the tide for the cause of the
  Netherlands.</p>

  <p>The old verger joined Rénée in the doorway of the church.</p>

  <p>He also looked at the clouds and the weather-vanes.</p>

  <p>"The Prince will be anxious to-day," he said and pulled down the lapels of
  his cap over his ears.</p>

  <p>"The Prince is always anxious," answered Rénée.</p>

  <p>"Ay, I do not think he sleeps much of nights," muttered the old man. "He
  walks with a spring under his feet and a sword over his head. I dreamt last
  night he was dead, drowned in the waters that come to relieve Leiden."</p>

  <p>He shambled back into the church and crouched near the stove by the door,
  warming his gnarled fingers.</p>

  <p>Rénée instead remained at the door; she looked at the house where the old
  woman and the baby and the little hired maid waited alone.</p>

  <p>They held their own service; the girl read the Bible to the old woman, and
  then they would pray together&mdash;for the Prince, for Holland and for the
  relief of Leiden. And between them, in her small cradle, lay little
  Wilhelmina.</p>

  <p>A little smile curved Rénée's lips at the thought of the baby.</p>

  <p>She seemed to hold a happy secret safe in her heart, something that
  consoled her, and even gave her a certain protection against sorrow.</p>

  <p>Differently from her usual custom she did not return home to await till
  the service commenced but retreated into the shadow of the double doors.</p>

  <p>The church was full that morning; young and old, rich and poor had come to
  offer up a prayer for Leiden.</p>

  <p>Rénée saw the Prince coming across the square&mdash;she drew her hood
  closer across her face and moved further into the shadow.</p>

  <p>William had his secretary and Ste. Aldegonde with him; he walked a little
  apart from these and absently returned the salutations of the people, most of
  whom passed him on the way to the church, for his step was slow this
  morning.</p>

  <p>As he passed Rénée in the porch she marked how pale and haggard he
  looked.</p>

  <p>She knew that he was thinking of the letter from Admiral Boisat.</p>

  <p>Her eyes filled with unreasonable tears as she looked across at the figure
  of the Prince, seated erect, like a soldier on duty, opposite the place for
  the preacher and other clergy, where stood the great Bibles with their long
  green markers.</p>

  <p>As she gazed at that slender figure in the coarse brown frieze, at that
  grave face so thoughtful and sad, her heart ached with intolerable longing
  for the old days&mdash;for the young cavalier with the smiling lips and the
  chestnut curls who had come and gone from the splendid mansion in
  Brussels.</p>

  <p>She wondered if William ever thought of those times, contrasted with these
  bare walls and cold-lit spaces the luxurious church of Ste. Gudule, where he
  had worshipped amid the pomp of the Romanist faith.</p>

  <p>She would not have had him other than he was; his very homeliness was
  proof of his self-sacrifice and heroism&mdash;he had given everything, even
  his youth; but being a woman her heart contracted with pain to think that the
  days of his gorgeous careless magnificence were gone for ever, that never
  more would he go hawking with his famous white falcons and hounds, laugh at a
  banquet or step the figures of a dance&mdash;such foolishness, thought Rénée,
  yet the tears ran down her cheeks.</p>

  <p>She speculated eagerly as to what the Prince's thoughts were at this
  moment&mdash;did he recall the past or think of Charlotte de Bourbon&mdash;or
  was he thinking of nothing but Leiden?</p>

  <p>None of these things were in the mind of William of Orange.</p>

  <p>He had even for the moment forgotten the peril of Leiden.</p>

  <p>Instead he dwelt with the recollection of a great sorrow, on the death of
  Count Louis; even now he could hardly realize that he would never see him
  again, never receive a letter from him&mdash;never hear news of him&mdash;he
  was dead, his body trampled into the marshes of Mooker Heyde.</p>

  <p>William heard nothing of the sermon; it was with a start he turned to see
  one of his servants beside him who gave him a letter and hastened away to the
  back of the church.</p>

  <p>A letter from Admiral Boisat.</p>

  <p>The Prince broke the seal, glanced at the contents, and then sat still,
  his hand over his face.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, at the termination of the service, he sent the letter
  up to the pulpit with the request for the pastor to read it aloud.</p>

  <p>Leiden was relieved.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-13"
     id="ch2-13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE PRINCE'S WIFE</h2>

  <p class="first">On the eleventh day of the June following the relief of
  Leiden William of Orange was married to Charlotte de Bourbon, despite the
  German Princes and the disapproval of his own party even including his
  brother John, hitherto so docile to all the schemes and projects of the
  Prince.</p>

  <p>The wedding festivities were held at Dort, and soon after William brought
  his wife to the quiet house in Delft which was the sole marriage gift he was
  able to make, for, though he was on the eve of accepting the Government of
  Holland and Zeeland with sovereign powers and the name of Stadtholder, this
  meant little betterment in his private fortunes, which were encumbered by
  debts and settlements.</p>

  <p>But the bride made no complaint at the modest maintenance offered her;
  secured by the declarations of the Protestant clergy in the legality of her
  position she accepted with grace and dignity the rôle of Princess of Orange
  and wife of the chief magistrate of the freed Provinces.</p>

  <p>Rénée, living her quiet monotonous life, heard on every side a good report
  of the new Princess.</p>

  <p>And somehow, within herself, she smiled; she had always known that
  Charlotte de Bourbon would not fail in anything she undertook.</p>

  <p>That summer, soon after the solemn ceremony by which the Prince had
  accepted the government, Rénée resolved to wait upon Charlotte de
  Bourbon.</p>

  <p>She chose a day when the Prince was absent at Rotterdam, put on her best
  gown and went to the house opposite the old church.</p>

  <p>There was no more pomp than there had been in the old days; a maid-servant
  showed Rénée into the presence of her mistress.</p>

  <p>Charlotte was seated in the window space, sewing; her bright hair and lace
  cap were all of exquisite freshness and neatness, her serene face bloomed
  with gentle contentment.</p>

  <p>She rose with surprise.</p>

  <p>"I did not know you were in Delft&mdash;I have so often thought of
  you."</p>

  <p>Rénée came forward to kiss her hand, but Charlotte instead embraced her
  and led her to the seat near her own.</p>

  <p>A silence and an embarrassment fell on Rénée; she sat mute, wishing she
  had not come.</p>

  <p>The Princess noted her worn dress, her hands roughened with work, and her
  face which was a little hollowed and faded in tint, but still lovely beneath
  the plaits of red-brown hair.</p>

  <p>Charlotte was acutely aware of something strange, closed and secret about
  the Fleming, something she had always been aware of, but had been too
  self-absorbed to dwell upon.</p>

  <p>"You live here?" she asked gently; something prevented her from
  questioning Rénée as to the motive of her sudden leaving of Heidelberg or in
  any way forcing her confidence.</p>

  <p>Rénée was prepared for this question.</p>

  <p>"No," she said quickly. "I chance to be in Delft. I have no home."</p>

  <p>The lie came readily to her lips; she had a desire that was almost
  passionate to disguise from Charlotte and from the Prince the life she had
  evolved for herself in Delft.</p>

  <p>This and the existence of little Wilhelmina were secrets she would never
  divulge.</p>

  <p>It was in Charlotte's heart and almost on her lips to ask her to enter her
  service; but again something, perhaps the sense of the aloof in Rénée,
  prevented her.</p>

  <p>"I am glad that you came to see me," she said instead. "I am much
  alone."</p>

  <p>Rénée looked at her sharply.</p>

  <p>"Alone?"</p>

  <p>Charlotte's smile was not without sadness as she replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You would not believe how absorbed His Highness is in affairs and how
  little I see of him."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Rénée, "he would have much to do now."</p>

  <p>"So much&mdash;he works day and night. For the rest I have few friends. I
  am still the foreigner&mdash;the newcomer."</p>

  <p>Rénée's eyes remained fixed steadily on the fair face of the Princess.</p>

  <p>"Does it seem strange to your Highness," she asked, "to sit here the wife
  of William of Orange?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes it seems very strange," she answered simply. "You remember, at
  Heidelberg, how we used to talk of him but I always thought you would marry
  Count Louis."</p>

  <p>"I know."</p>

  <p>The two women were silent for a moment and continued to look at each
  other.</p>

  <p>"You think that I am very happy?" asked Charlotte at last, under her
  breath.</p>

  <p>Rénée gave a little shudder but did not answer or move.</p>

  <p>"I have made many enemies by my marriage," continued the Princess, "and I
  fear, plunged my lord into much dispute and imbroglio. Sometimes I think I
  did wrong."</p>

  <p>"His Highness pleased himself," answered Rénée in a constrained tone.</p>

  <p>"I brought him nothing," said Charlotte with the same simple frankness. "I
  can make a home for him and his children, that is all."</p>

  <p>"Any woman could do that," thought Rénée; she averted her eyes and said
  aloud:</p>

  <p>"It is curious you should speak as if you justified your marriage&mdash;to
  me, madam!"</p>

  <p>"I know you have been a faithful friend to the Prince. You may have
  thought, as other friends of his have thought, that this marriage was
  wrong&mdash;a mistake."</p>

  <p>Her eyes filled with tears as she spoke; as she continued her voice
  shook.</p>

  <p>"Believe me&mdash;my great desire was to serve him&mdash;believe
  me&mdash;I suffer."</p>

  <p>"Suffer?" Rénée was startled.</p>

  <p>"I live with him in the midst of death&mdash;he never leaves me but I say
  farewell, thinking it may be farewell indeed&mdash;every day some new peril
  arises&mdash;do you think that Philip will suffer him to live?"</p>

  <p>Rénée looking at her, saw that lines of care already marked the brow that
  had been so smooth, that the serene eyes were tired, saw that Charlotte, whom
  she had judged cold and precise, was after all a woman like herself, full of
  anguish that must be suppressed and fears that must be hidden.</p>

  <p>"You could not think," continued the Princess, and her voice was quite
  broken now, "the letters he receives&mdash;the warnings, the threats, the
  scurrilous attacks. And Philip on the watch, always. Philip and his
  spies."</p>

  <p>She clutched Rénée's hand desperately.</p>

  <p>"Some day it will happen," she said, "and I may have to stand by."</p>

  <p>Rénée's heart seemed suddenly unlocked; she burst into tears.</p>

  <p>"I have thought of this&mdash;have I not thought of this&mdash;day and
  night!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"It will happen," said Charlotte. "God help us." With a mutual instinct
  the women turned to each other and clasped hands.</p>

  <p>Charlotte was the first to recover herself.</p>

  <p>"Such fools we are, we die a thousand deaths," she said with a trembling
  smile.</p>

  <p>"But you&mdash;you," stammered Rénée, "why are you so afraid? His Highness
  grows greater every day&mdash;a nation surrounds him now."</p>

  <p>"The more reason Philip should seek to destroy him!"</p>

  <p>"Nay," replied Rénée in great agitation. "Your Highness must not think of
  these things&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you," said Charlotte, "did you not say you had thought of
  this&mdash;day and night?"</p>

  <p>The blood beat in Rénée's tear-stained cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness unnerved me," she murmured. "I&mdash;yes, I have
  had&mdash;fears&mdash;about the Prince," she paused, then added with an
  effort. "The Prince," she repeated, "the life of His Highness means so much
  to us Netherlanders."</p>

  <p>"I know," replied the Princess, "take this comfort&mdash;. he has already
  done a work that not all the might of Philip can undo. He has established in
  Holland that which no earthly power can destroy. And if God gives him a few
  more years, you will see a great nation established in these states."</p>

  <p>Rénée felt that she had been mistaken in Charlotte de Bourbon in judging
  her incapable of great emotion and noble feeling.</p>

  <p>The woman who spoke now was the woman who had had the courage to fling off
  a vocation into which she had been forced, the spirit to renounce a creed
  that was hateful to her, to choose her own life and pursue her own course
  with unfaltering steps.</p>

  <p>Under the precise manner of one trained since childhood to restraint, was
  the lofty spirit and serene soul of a good and sweet woman.</p>

  <p>Rénée saw this; as she saw also that Charlotte suffered, that her life was
  one of anxiety and foreboding, and might at any moment be changed into the
  darkness of bitter anguish.</p>

  <p>She loosened her hands from the gentle clasp of the Princess and turned
  away.</p>

  <p>She no longer felt hard or bitter but humbled and abashed. Charlotte
  looked at her with puzzled eyes.</p>

  <p>"You were very intimate&mdash;in the Prince's house in Brussels?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;with the Princess."</p>

  <p>Charlotte steadied her voice with a palpable effort. "Tell me&mdash;about
  her."</p>

  <p>"About her? Madam, it seems another life."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but I must think of her sometimes. You understand that."</p>

  <p>Rénée had thought of her too; she knew the fate of Anne of Saxony.</p>

  <p>Returned at length to her outraged and indignant relatives, divorced from
  the husband she had reviled and abandoned, separated from the children she
  had never cared for, and from the lover for whose ignoble sake she had cast
  the last remnants of her honour and dignity aside, the wretched Princess,
  whose mind was now completely gone, was now kept as a hopeless prisoner.</p>

  <p>This punishment of the last Princess of Orange for a life that had indeed
  been full of fault and folly was no secret.</p>

  <p>Rénée believed that Charlotte must know of it; but it was something that
  she could not speak of to the woman who occupied Anne's place.</p>

  <p>"The Princess was mad," she said, "and His Highness ever magnanimous."</p>

  <p>"He never&mdash;cared for her?"</p>

  <p>"A marriage of convenience. But he was ever gentle and considerate. She
  might have been a happy woman."</p>

  <p>"It was that I wished to know&mdash;you, so continually with her, must be
  aware of the truth."</p>

  <p>"That is the truth, madam. She was mad&mdash;even before her
  marriage."</p>

  <p>Charlotte was silent awhile, looking out over the sunny courtyard.</p>

  <p>Then she spoke, suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I asked you because I have her children with me. Maurice is a beautiful
  boy."</p>

  <p>Rénée remembered him but vaguely; she had been continually with Anne and
  therefore had seen but little of the children, who had always lived apart
  from their mother.</p>

  <p>"He has the spirit of his father," said Charlotte wistfully, and as she
  spoke Rénée divined another of her sorrows&mdash;that she was not the mother
  of the Prince's heir.</p>

  <p>"The Princess's father was the great Elector Maurice," answered Rénée;
  "perhaps the young Count favours him."</p>

  <p>"Would you like to see him?" she asked, and without waiting for an answer
  she pulled the bell-rope near to her hand.</p>

  <p>"What am I to him?" answered Rénée; it seemed to her a curious fancy of
  Charlotte to speak of William's son.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes he came.</p>

  <p>The Prince's eldest son, Count Philip, remained, lost to his family and
  his country, a prisoner in Spain, and Maurice was his only other son, and, in
  the eyes of all, his heir.</p>

  <p>He stood, a well-grown boy of eight years; he held a parrot on his
  wrist.</p>

  <p>He was like neither of his parents; he showed promise of a heavier make
  than the Prince, and the thick hair that fell around his face was almost
  blonde.</p>

  <p>His eyes, large and clear grey, were full of intelligence and he had
  already a very notable carriage, graceful and bold.</p>

  <p>He glanced at the stranger with little interest; but</p>

  <p>Rénée noted that for the Princess he had a smile of affection.</p>

  <p>Charlotte asked him some trivial questions about the parrot and sent him
  away.</p>

  <p>"You are fond of him, Highness?" asked Rénée. The Princess looked at her
  straightly.</p>

  <p>"I try to train him to take his father's place when the time comes," she
  answered gravely. "Perhaps, after all, the Saxon marriage will not have been
  in vain."</p>

  <p>She smiled at Rénée, who was silent, bewildered by this new point of
  view.</p>

  <p>"You see I try to do my duty," added the Princess bravely. "And to help in
  the work of His Highness."</p>

  <h2><a name="pt3"
     id="pt3"></a>PART III THE BAN</h2>

  <p class="quote">"God in His Mercy will maintain my innocence and my honour
  during my life and in future ages. As to my fortune and my life, I have
  dedicated both, long since, to His service." &mdash; William of Orange.</p>

  <h2>I. &mdash; SPANISH COUNCILS</h2>

  <p class="first">The Burgundian priest sat by the bedside of his sovereign. A
  low fever kept Philip in his room, but now the weakness of his illness was
  passing and he had summoned Granvelle to discuss with him the eternal
  business that for ever occupied his mind.</p>

  <p>For the moment, however, he slept, and the Cardinal waited at his ease in
  the great chair that stood by the King's bed; the chamber was dark,
  overheated, the air heavy with the perfume of drugs and herbs.</p>

  <p>It was yet early afternoon, but the shutters were closed and the glow of
  an oil lamp mingled with the red glimmer of the fire.</p>

  <p>The black furniture threw heavy shadows on the walls hung with
  leather.</p>

  <p>On the wall opposite to the foot of the bed hung an ebony crucifix,
  beneath it was a beautiful Italian picture recently purchased by the
  King.</p>

  <p>At the side of the room an open door showed the antechamber, there waited
  the chamberlain, the doctor and the apothecary. They were all seated at a
  round table, and as Granvelle looked at their figures they seemed to him to
  be asleep.</p>

  <p>The Cardinal himself yawned, but his active brain was alert; he sat
  motionless, withdrawn into the shadows, but his pose was full of energy, his
  eyes watchful.</p>

  <p>With a bitter philosophy his acute judgment reviewed the recent events in
  the struggle in which he had taken so personal an interest, the scenes and
  actors of the world amid which he moved.</p>

  <p>Eight years had passed since he had first suggested to Philip the wisdom
  of removing William of Orange by assassination, and that Prince still lived
  and by sheer skill of statecraft had guided the destinies of the rebel
  provinces until by the Pacification of Ghent he had secured the adhesion of
  seven states to the Union which defied Philip.</p>

  <p>The Cardinal, never one to blink facts, did not deny to himself that
  William was so far the victor in the long and terrible conflict which he
  always considered to have begun that day the young Prince had come to defy
  him in his luxurious house outside Brussels.</p>

  <p>The sudden death of the Governor, Resquesens, the subsequent confusion of
  the country left without a Viceroy and the mutiny of the Spanish soldiery,
  culminating in the ghastly sack of Antwerp&mdash;these events had been turned
  to good account by William of Orange.</p>

  <p>And the new Governor, the famous brother of the King, Don John of Austria,
  the dupe of Philip, the victim of the hate and jealousy of Aña D'Eboli and
  Antonio Perez, what had he been but William's puppet?</p>

  <p>The most brilliant hero in Christendom, the most charming of gentlemen had
  exerted his fascination in vain against the influence of the Prince of
  Orange, whom he could neither buy nor subdue.</p>

  <p>In despair at his impossible task, overwhelmed by the steady power of the
  man 'who opposed him, all his gorgeous schemes laid in the dust, abandoned by
  the cold distrust of Philip in whose service he had obtained such deathless
  renown, the brilliant adventurer had died heartbroken.</p>

  <p>And William of Orange pursued his way.</p>

  <p>Granvelle hoped more from Don John's successor than he had ever hoped from
  that knight himself, Alexander of Parma, nephew of the King and son of the
  late Regent, the Duchess Margaret, now held the reins of government, and
  Granvelle had greater faith in the cold crafty Italian, energetic and
  masterful, than he ever had hoped from Don John, generous, and ambitious,
  worthless as a statesman and inferior to Parma as a soldier.</p>

  <p>But even the qualities of Alexander Farnese had not as yet proved equal to
  the Prince of Orange.</p>

  <p>He also had had his puppets, from behind whose back he had governed the
  states he had wrested from Philip.</p>

  <p>First the Archduke Mathias, who had served his turn, and now a more
  formidable figure-head to flout and irritate Spain, to wit Francis Hercules,
  Duke of Anjou, brother of the King of France and in the favour of the Queen
  of England, even, as rumour still said, her future husband. This personage
  had William secured as his mask and protection, and the twisted policies of
  the Duke's mother, the Medicean Queen, were thus supporting the heretics
  against the King who had most rejoiced in the massacre of Saint
  Bartholomew.</p>

  <p>It was a great thing for William to have thus obtained the open support of
  France, and the tacit support of England, and Granvelle could well imagine
  the satisfaction with which he allowed the French Prince to assume the
  trappings of Duke of Brabant and all the symbols of authority, while he, as
  ever sleeplessly watchful, patient and wary, continued to steer the ship of
  state through the perilous depths of wars and diplomacy.</p>

  <p>What was Anjou?</p>

  <p>No more than Mathias in power or prestige, and of the half-mad Valois
  blood.</p>

  <p>Already he was tampering with Parma; Spain could always buy him if the
  price was high enough, he was but another royal adventurer, a mere counter in
  the game who might at any moment be swept from the board as Don John and
  Mathias and many another had already been swept.</p>

  <p>But the Prince&mdash;he, now as always, was the man with whom Spain had to
  reckon. For years Granvelle had been constant to this one hope and
  aim&mdash;the accomplishment of the death of the Prince of Orange.</p>

  <p>So far all private attempts on his life had failed. He had escaped these
  perils as he had survived the dangers and fatigues to which he was constantly
  exposed. His body seemed as sound and perfect as his mind, since it
  successfully resisted disease, weariness and almost super-human labour.</p>

  <p>Louis of Nassau and Count Henry had gone now, also the young heir of the
  Elector&mdash;who indeed was left of those who had set out to defy
  Philip?</p>

  <p>Only this one man.</p>

  <p>"But all the others might have lived," said Granvelle in his heart, "could
  this great man but have been taken."</p>

  <p>A feeling of despair overcame him as if William were protected by some
  supernatural power; it seemed little less than miraculous, even to the
  cynical mind of the Cardinal, that William had so long escaped every trap and
  snare when so many less illustrious and dangerous persons had fallen victim
  to the wrath of Philip.</p>

  <p>It might have seemed as if every weapon had been tried, but the acute
  brain of Granvelle had evolved yet another means with which to strike at the
  heart of William of Orange.</p>

  <p>As he sat there silent in the shadows by Philip's bed, he held a roll of
  parchment in his hands which was the most powerful instrument yet directed
  against the life of the rebel heretic.</p>

  <p>The Cardinal had designed, and Philip had approved and signed, a Ban
  against the Prince as direct and wide embracing in its effects as any Bull of
  Excommunication issued by any Pope.</p>

  <p>This document, after an elaborate preamble setting forth the crimes and
  treasons of the Prince from his first ingratitude to Philip till the Union of
  Utrecht, declared him "traitor and miscreant, enemy of ourselves and of the
  country. As such we banish him perpetually from our realms, forbidding all
  our subjects of whatever degree to communicate with him openly or privately,
  to administer to him. We allow all to injure him in property or life. We
  expose the said William of Nassau as an enemy of the human race&mdash;giving
  his property to all who may seize it. And if any one of our subjects or any
  stranger should be found sufficiently generous of heart to rid us of this
  pest, delivering him to us, alive or dead, or taking his life, we will cause
  to be furnished to him immediately after the deed shall have been done, the
  sum of twenty-five thousand crowns in gold. If he have committed any crime,
  however heinous, we promise to pardon him, and if he be not already noble, we
  will ennoble him for his valour."</p>

  <p>Cardinal Granvelle knew these words, which were of his own dictating, by
  heart.</p>

  <p>This time the net of Spain had been thrown wide&mdash;it was intended to
  catch all the villains of the world and turn them to the King's uses. All the
  swarming mercenaries, all the wandering ruffians, the scum of Europe, all the
  professional assassins of Italy and Spain, all the fanatics were now tempted
  and exhorted to remove this man.</p>

  <p>They were promised the protection of Spain, admission to the ranks of the
  proudest nobility in the world, forgiveness of any crime they might have
  committed and a sum of money that represented a fortune.</p>

  <p>Granvelle could not believe that among all those who would assuredly try
  for these prizes, there was not one who would eventually be successful.</p>

  <p>And there was the moral effect of the Ban; the Cardinal greatly reckoned
  on that.</p>

  <p>William's courage had been tried in many ways but he had not yet been
  tried by the supreme test of all-the certainty of assassination, the
  knowledge that all the villainy, cupidity and fanaticism of Europe was being
  urged and bribed to remove him&mdash;that poison might lurk in every dish he
  tasted, a dagger in the hand of every stranger who approached him.</p>

  <p>"Let us see now," said the Cardinal to himself, "if this rogue is able to
  pursue his business unperturbed." Alva, Resquesens, Don John, Parma,
  Granvelle himself, had failed to bribe, cajole, or move this man, he had
  proved impervious to all attempts to win him and escaped all efforts to
  dispose of his life or his liberty; now the wrath of Spain was unmasked, her
  full venom and deadly sting were exposed&mdash;perhaps by the hand of some
  obscure ruffian she could accomplish what she had failed to do by means of
  her greatest captains, Princes and statesmen.</p>

  <p>Philip stirred in the great bed and the Cardinal looked at his master.</p>

  <p>So slight and thin was Philip that his meagre figure hardly showed beneath
  the massive coverlet, his head resting on the huge pillow looked like a mask
  placed there, so closely did the skin cling to his bones, so lifeless were
  the eyes, sunken and half closed.</p>

  <p>As he looked at Philip his lip curled.</p>

  <p>"The dupe of Ana D'Eboli and Antonio Perez!" he thought, "the puppet of a
  wanton and a rogue."</p>

  <p>These two still ruled the Court of Spain; they had been able to bring to
  the dust Don John and to remove by murder his secretary Excordo, and still
  Philip suspected nothing of an intrigue of which he alone in Spain seemed
  ignorant.</p>

  <p>Granvelle stared closer at the miserable wasted face of the King and the
  contempt deepened in his own countenance.</p>

  <p>Philip suddenly opened his eyes and seeing Granvelle bending over him
  moved back his head a little and gazed at the Cardinal.</p>

  <p>The contempt froze on Granvelle's face; he drew back with a cautious
  swiftness; the movement of one who has suddenly found himself too near
  something poisonous and fierce.</p>

  <p>The King's pallid eyes fixed him with a steady stare; his straight gaze
  was terrible and Granvelle saw now no longer the sickly dupe, the prey of
  such as Perez and his lover, but the man who was ruler of half the world.</p>

  <p>"I wished to read to your Majesty the finished version of the Ban," he
  said, smoothly.</p>

  <p>"The Ban," repeated the King in a voice monotonous and weak. "I remember
  very well the contents. Twenty-five thousand crowns is too high."</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty yourself wrote to the Prince of Parma that thirty thousand
  crowns would be well spent in this affair."</p>

  <p>"But you," replied Philip, still staring at him with unblinking eyes,
  "dictated that letter. I always thought the sum too much."</p>

  <p>He raised himself in bed and looked round to see if there was any food
  ready on the table by his side.</p>

  <p>There was none 'and he stretched out a trembling yellow hand and struck
  the bell near him.</p>

  <p>"No sum would be too high to pay for the removal of the Prince of Orange,"
  said Granvelle, controlling his exasperation at Philip's parsimony, which was
  to him a continual source of irritation.</p>

  <p>"But if we can get the work done for ten why offer twenty-five?" asked
  Philip.</p>

  <p>"The higher the reward the greater number it will attract," answered
  Granvelle.</p>

  <p>"There are many," insisted Philip, "who would do the business not for
  money but for the love of our Lord."</p>

  <p>"Those who demand no pay need not receive any," said the Cardinal, "but
  there are very many neither good Catholics nor honest men who would do this
  thing for money."</p>

  <p>"I regret the amount," said Philip; his chamberlain entered and the King
  ordered food.</p>

  <p>"Sire," returned Granvelle, "it is not likely that the man who kills
  William of Orange will live to claim a reward."</p>

  <p>"True," said Philip, brightening.</p>

  <p>"He will almost certainly be captured and put to death by the
  Estates."</p>

  <p>"But there will be his family," objected the King, depressed again</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty can satisfy the family out of the property forfeited by the
  Prince of Orange."</p>

  <p>Philip considered this suggestion so brilliant that he smiled, showing his
  teeth above the ragged line of red beard.</p>

  <p>The idea of rewarding William's murderer out of William's own pocket gave
  him great pleasure; his eyes brightened and he continued to smile at
  Granvelle.</p>

  <p>"The twenty-five thousand crowns can remain on the Ban," continued the
  Cardinal, "and your Majesty can make up the amount in lands&mdash;those in
  Franché-Comte, for instance."</p>

  <p>The King nodded; his 'valet de chambre' was entering with a tray of food
  and this for the moment engaged his attention.</p>

  <p>Granvelle folded up the copy of the Ban; he saw that it was useless to try
  and read it to the King while the latter was engaged in reviewing the young
  fowl cooked in wine, the mushrooms stuffed with snow, the spiced meats, the
  tarts, sweets and fruits that had been placed before him.</p>

  <p>This rich food was always ready when the King called for it, as, even in
  sickness, he preserved an enormous appetite.</p>

  <p>The Cardinal was something disgusted by this sight of Philip so intent on
  his meal; he himself was fond of luxurious living, but not to the exclusion
  of higher interests.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty is then satisfied with the wording of the Ban?"</p>

  <p>"Surely," said Philip, testing the tenderness of the fowl with a knife,
  "we can say no more. When I hear the Prince has been taken off it will be a
  happier day for me than that of Saint Bartholomew," this reminding him of
  French affairs, he added mournfully, "I wish we could put a price on the head
  of the Duke of Anjou."</p>

  <p>"He is a son of France," replied the Cardinal, "and for the moment we had
  better not meddle with him."</p>

  <p>"Parma may buy him yet," answered the King. "Parma is the best man I have
  had in the Netherlands."</p>

  <p>Granvelle did not endorse this statement; to hear another praised in the
  conduct of the Netherlands, reminded him of the ever galling subject of his
  own ill success there. Seeing the King absorbed in the meal, he took his
  leave; he was glad to be away from the close unhealthy air of the
  sick-chamber.</p>

  <p>When he reached the corridor he opened the nearest window and leant out
  into the cold March air.</p>

  <p>With a little smile he held up the Ban as if he traced the form of the man
  he hated in the loose flying grey clouds.</p>

  <p>"A good many years since you defied me, William of Nassau, but perhaps
  now, at last&mdash;"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-2"
     id="ch3-2"></a>II. &mdash; THE FIRST FRUITS OF THE BAN</h2>

  <p class="first">The June of that year the Ban was published in the
  Netherlands. If Philip had thrown aside the mask so now did William of
  Nassau.</p>

  <p>His answer to the Ban was the 'Apology,' in which he defied the wrath of
  Spain, point by point defended his conduct and arraigned Philip for his
  crimes against liberty and honour as fearlessly and emphatically as Philip
  and Granvelle had arraigned him.</p>

  <p>There was no longer any subtleties, any juggling of words between these
  two, Philip no longer flattered, William was no longer deferential; their
  long enmity had taken on another phase, it was now open, ruthless without
  disguise or hope of reconciliation, war to the death.</p>

  <p>Philip gave William's life to the assassin, his property to the thief, his
  substance to the four winds of heaven. William in his reply gave Philip's
  actions to the judgment of all mankind.</p>

  <p>Wherever the Ban was circulated the Apology went also, and before all
  noble minds William was vindicated.</p>

  <p>And the months passed without producing either any outward sign of the
  effect of the Ban upon minds that were not noble but low, fanatic and
  mercenary.</p>

  <p>William seemed too encircled by love and devotion, for any murderer's arm
  to reach him.</p>

  <p>Neither was he, as Granvelle had hoped, in the least intimidated by
  Philip's awful threats.</p>

  <p>Unmoved as ever by the machinations of his enemies and the extraordinary
  internal difficulties of a country that was yet divided, he proceeded to
  consolidate the position of the Provinces by act after act in which they
  asserted their freedom and threw off the Spanish yoke.</p>

  <p>In the midsummer of 1581, the United Provinces solemnly and for ever
  renounced their allegiance to Philip; the sovereignty of Holland and Zeeland
  was vested in William, the other Provinces agreed to accept Francis of Anjou
  as the successor to Philip, the Prince from many motives having declined to
  accept the entire government and having only received that of the Northern
  States with extreme reluctance.</p>

  <p>It had never been his desire to advance himself by the troubles of these
  times, and he was resolute not to incur the imputation of having contended
  for his own private fortunes instead of for the freedom of the
  Netherlands.</p>

  <p>Besides, he believed that the struggling states would be safer under the
  protection of the brother of the King of France and the friend of England
  than trusting solely to him, a landless man, plunged deeply in danger and
  difficulty. For this reason he endeavoured, though without avail, to induce
  Holland and Zeeland to join the other Provinces in electing as their
  sovereign the Duke of Anjou&mdash;the union of all under one chief being his
  great desire.</p>

  <p>That the French King's brother was the ideal person to fill this position
  the Prince did not pretend, but there was no one else offering; if assistance
  did not come from France there was nowhere it could come from; Anjou was an
  unknown quantity, but Ste. Aldegonde had spoken well of him; he was
  young&mdash;he might serve.</p>

  <p>So, while William persuaded the States and persuaded himself, and it was
  generally considered probable that Anjou would marry the Queen of England,
  and thus a double protection be secured for the States, in the early spring
  of 1582, the Duke crossed from England, where he had been feted and flattered
  by Elizabeth, and landed at Flushing accompanied by an English escort.</p>

  <p>A few days later he took the oaths at Kiel and entered Antwerp as Duke of
  Brabant.</p>

  <p>His inauguration was made with a display of wealth, pomp and magnificence
  which astonished and vexed the French.</p>

  <p>The Duke subscribed the constitutional pact of twenty-seven articles and
  was accepted as Duke of Brabant. The Prince who had placed him in this
  position had circumscribed his power, so that he was no more than a chief
  magistrate of a republic; the Frenchman made no protest, he swore the oaths
  glibly, but in his heart the unscrupulous adventurer was by no means pleased
  by the limitations imposed on an authority which he had hoped and expected
  would be absolute; he wanted not only Philip's place, but Philip's power.</p>

  <p>For the moment the festivities offered by Antwerp, which pleased his idle
  and luxurious nature, wholly occupied his mind, but while preparing for the
  great banquet which he was giving on his birthday, a few weeks after his
  arrival, he suddenly expressed himself as tired of the position in which the
  Prince of Orange had placed him.</p>

  <p>"I am not," he said, glancing round the little court of young nobles who
  surrounded him, "this Dutchman's doll."</p>

  <p>He sat in a great gilt chair in the palace of Saint Michael, and a long
  mirror placed opposite him that he might view himself in his festival
  garment, reflected his entire figure.</p>

  <p>The man whom Fate had chosen as the last rival to Philip on the troubled
  scene of the Netherlands, was now twenty-eight years old and of a singularly
  unprepossessing appearance.</p>

  <p>When William had met him on the quay at Flushing he had glanced from him
  to the stately figure of the English nobleman who had accompanied him, Robert
  Dudley, Earl of Leicester, and William, looking from Elizabeth's favourite to
  Elizabeth's suitor, had but little hopes for the pretensions of Francis of
  Anjou.</p>

  <p>His originally insignificant face was seamed by the scars of smallpox,
  which disease had so swollen and disfigured his nose that it appeared to be
  double.</p>

  <p>His small light eyes sparkled with cunning and malice, his mouth was loose
  and ugly, a quantity of smooth fair hair was turned back from his narrow
  forehead and his stoop was so pronounced as to be almost a hump.</p>

  <p>This miserable figure was clad in the utmost pomp and magnificence,
  perfumed, curled and adorned.</p>

  <p>His doublet of white satin, stuffed to render more imposing his meagre
  proportions, was braided with gold and seed pearls, an enormous triple ruff
  of the finest needlework surrounded his face and from his shoulders hung a
  mantle of rich blue velvet lined with yellow satin.</p>

  <p>Hose of fine white silk, garters of pearl and turquoise, gilt shoes
  completed his attire.</p>

  <p>On his left arm he carried a muff of white fur, on his breast sparkled
  several jewelled chains, and in one ear was a long brilliant drop, attached
  to which was a plait of auburn hair, believed to be that of the Queen of
  England.</p>

  <p>The demeanour of the Duke was in keeping with this elaborate attire; he
  was by no means depressed by his physical disabilities, but carried himself
  with the air of a handsome cavalier.</p>

  <p>His little group of "mignons," as adorned, as scented and all more elegant
  than himself, stood in the embrasure of the handsome window talking together
  in whispers and eyeing their master.</p>

  <p>From the moment of their landing they had seen and fostered the Duke's
  dislike of the Flemings and his antipathy to William of Orange.</p>

  <p>They took as an outrage the limitations imposed on the man who would one
  day be King of France, they had not come to the Netherlands to be the
  servants of the States, but to lord it over the inhabitants of the Provinces
  as they were used to lord it over the French.</p>

  <p>The debauched, criminal and tyrannical Court of the Valois was their
  model; Catholics, they despised heretics, nobles, they despised the burghers
  who largely composed the states, and always in want of money the wealth and
  splendour of such a city as Antwerp excited their envy and cupidity.</p>

  <p>Such were the men let loose upon the soil of the Netherlands under the
  pretence of protecting their recently redeemed liberties.</p>

  <p>Anjou shared these feelings.</p>

  <p>He was not unintelligent and he had quickly seen what position William of
  Orange expected him to occupy and that Prince's motives in securing for him
  the sovereignty of the Provinces.</p>

  <p>Neither of these was to his liking and he hated the man who, he felt, was
  merely using him for his own ends.</p>

  <p>From the first he had resolved to outwit William; as he had not hesitated
  to endeavour to overcome the magnificent Leicester in the lists of love, so
  he did not hesitate to measure himself on the fields of diplomacy with the
  Prince of Orange.</p>

  <p>He had already opened secret and tentative negotiations with Parma and was
  prepared to deliver to Spain all the liberties which he had so recently sworn
  to defend if he would find his own advancement in so doing.</p>

  <p>But Parma was wary, the Duke saw but little to be gained in this
  direction, at least for the moment.</p>

  <p>He began to be discontented with the whole adventure and to feel a
  deepening spite against the Prince of Orange.</p>

  <p>"I will not be another Mathias!" he exclaimed aloud. "Nay, this Prince
  mistakes my quality."</p>

  <p>"Truly," said one of the young nobles, "I warned your Grace from the first
  he was a fellow who spoke always with a double meaning. A man of a serpentine
  policy."</p>

  <p>"Now, however," added another, "he deals with a son of France."</p>

  <p>"Not a puppet like Mathias, poor fool."</p>

  <p>"But a great Prince."</p>

  <p>"He will soon find the difference."</p>

  <p>Anjou listened to his flatterers with a satisfied air.</p>

  <p>"Seigneurs," he said complacently, "you will see me very easily foil this
  Prince."</p>

  <p>So calmly did the frivolous young adventurer talk of undoing the work at
  which William of Orange had laboured for twelve years and in which he had
  spent all his fortunes and energies, so lightly did he consider undermining
  the liberties which a whole brave people, at the cost of unutterable
  sacrifices had fought so long to redeem.</p>

  <p>"Your Grace must make yourself master of Antwerp and other such cities,"
  said one of the flatterers.</p>

  <p>"In this town alone," remarked another, "there are treasures worth the
  sacking." And his dissipated eyes glittered, for he was encumbered with
  debts.</p>

  <p>"Have you marked the goldsmiths' shops?" cried a third. "I never saw such
  jewels."</p>

  <p>Anjou smiled as he listened; he intended to make himself absolute master
  of this wealth that had so dazzled his favourites.</p>

  <p>"We shall see," he remarked, "who is lord in the Netherlands&mdash;myself
  or this Prince of Orange."</p>

  <p>The Duke sipped his orange water and meditated his plans of thwarting the
  Prince of Orange and making himself complete master of the Provinces.</p>

  <p>His reflections were suddenly interrupted by the abrupt opening of the
  door.</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde, pallid and disordered in appearance, stood upon the
  threshold.</p>

  <p>Francis of Anjou, always on the outlook for violence and treachery,
  clapped his hand to the little Italian dagger he kept concealed in the folds
  of his breeches.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde moved his lips but did not answer at once. The Duke
  paled.</p>

  <p>His suspicious mind scented some disaster, some mishap which would involve
  his own person.</p>

  <p>"Mon Dieu, my friend, are you speechless?" he asked, rising.</p>

  <p>"The Prince," stammered Ste. Aldegonde. "His Highness&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Duke still had his hand on the dagger, but he had regained his
  composure of manner.</p>

  <p>"What has happened to my cousin the Prince?" he asked with a good show of
  concern.</p>

  <p>"His Highness has been assassinated," returned Ste. Aldegonde.</p>

  <p>Anjou staggered; he felt as if the ground had been cut beneath him.</p>

  <p>"Assassinated," repeated Ste. Aldegonde, "shot through the head by a
  villain who presented a petition."</p>

  <p>A few moments before Anjou was thinking with hatred and impatience of the
  restraining hand of William of Orange, now that he heard that the man who had
  placed him where he was had been murdered, he felt a sensation of terror as
  if he had been abandoned, as if some strength on which he leant had been
  suddenly withdrawn.</p>

  <p>He kept his wits, however, through all his terror, and noticed that Ste.
  Aldegonde's distorted face was turned towards him, his bloodshot eyes keenly
  fixed on him.</p>

  <p>"They suspect me," thought Anjou faintly, and with a lively pang he
  pre-visioned his probable fate if the Netherlanders held him responsible for
  the murder of the Prince.</p>

  <p>"Has the assassin been caught?" he asked, pressing his handkerchief to his
  shaking lips.</p>

  <p>"He was stabbed to death instantly by those about the Prince. Count
  Maurice guards the body."</p>

  <p>"A&mdash;Spaniard?" queried the Duke.</p>

  <p>"Highness, nothing is known yet."</p>

  <p>"Certainly it is a Spaniard," said the Duke, taking courage; "these are
  the first fruits of the Ban."</p>

  <p>"Will your Grace come to the Prince?" he breathed.</p>

  <p>"What should I do?" demanded Anjou, trembling.</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde gave a dubious glance at the Prince in whose cause he had
  been so enthusiastic; he was beginning to doubt the wisdom of the choice of
  this new protector of the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>"Highness," he said sternly, "the Prince's last words, as he fell were:
  'Ah, what a servant His Highness loses in me!'&mdash;and now the place of
  your Grace is by his side."</p>

  <p>"Mon Dieu!" exclaimed the Duke in agitation, gazing round at his pale and
  silent courtiers; "how do I know what humour the people are in that I should
  venture forth?"</p>

  <p>"The clean conscience of your Highness will be your buckler," returned
  Ste. Aldegonde, who was still by no means certain that Anjou was not
  implicated in the recent crime.</p>

  <p>"I had rather have a hundred armed men," said Anjou. "I do not like your
  Flemings when they are in an ugly mood."</p>

  <p>"All the more reason that your Grace should show yourself to them. There
  is a terrible apprehension abroad&mdash;your Highness must face the
  people."</p>

  <p>Anjou and his followers gazed at each other with expressions of
  undisguised dismay.</p>

  <p>"I was abandoned of God the day I left England, where I was both honoured
  and safe!" exclaimed the Duke.</p>

  <p>He stared at Ste. Aldegonde with an apprehension that was almost
  ludicrous.</p>

  <p>"Mon Dieu, but I will not go forth," he added defiantly.</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde was spared an answer by the arrival of an officer of the
  Prince's household with the news that the young Count had found papers on the
  body of the assassin which proved him to have been inspired by one D'Anastro,
  a Spanish merchant long since in the pay of the Court of Spain; the crime was
  entirely the result of the Ban and the French were in no way responsible; the
  Count Maurice had at once communicated this news to the alarmed magistrates
  of the city, who were thus able to calm the people infuriated by the deed and
  apprehensive of another Saint Bartholomew.</p>

  <p>Anjou gasped with relief at the conclusion of this recital.</p>

  <p>"The young Count has shown great wisdom for his years," he remarked
  graciously. "As for the Prince I would have shed the last drop of my blood
  sooner than this should have happened. How goes His Highness?"</p>

  <p>"He is conscious and he speaks," returned the officer, "but there is
  little hope of his life." And as he spoke the rough soldier broke into
  tears.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-3"
     id="ch3-3"></a>III. &mdash; D'ANASTRO'S FAILURE</h2>

  <p class="first">Gaspar D'Anastro, merchant and spy of Spain, had long
  dallied with the lucrative but dangerous prospect of murdering the Prince of
  Orange.</p>

  <p>It was years since he had been mentioned to Granvelle as a man likely to
  do the deed.</p>

  <p>At last, faced by the prospect of bankruptcy in his own affairs and
  tempted by the enormous reward offered by the Ban, having made a contract
  with Philip by which the King promised to award him the Cross of Santiago and
  eighty thousand pieces of silver for the successful accomplishment of the
  crime, Gaspar D'Anastro, Venero, his cashier, and Zimmerman, his priest, had
  combined together to inspire and bribe the poor fanatical fool Jean Jauregay
  to the execution of the deed for which their own courage failed them.</p>

  <p>A vigorous research soon brought these facts to light; Venero and
  Zimmerman was arrested and wrote a full confession.</p>

  <p>D'Anastro himself had contrived to leave the city and was now safe within
  Parma's lines.</p>

  <p>But his hireling's shot had failed.</p>

  <p>Early in April while the Prince still lay between life and death in his
  house near the citadel a woman and a child came to Antwerp and lodged in one
  of the many inns for travellers which occupied the great Cathedral
  Square.</p>

  <p>This woman was Rénée le Meuny; she had left Delft for the first time since
  she had taken up her abode there, seven years before, with the infant
  daughter of the refugee of Rotterdam.</p>

  <p>She had borne with what patience she could the long and terrible suspense
  that hung over the Netherlands during the illness of the Prince; at last she
  could no longer endure the waiting and the solitude of Delft, and thus came
  to Antwerp, feeling very lonely and strange in this great city so full of
  movement and commotion, the splendour of a court and the coming and going of
  troops of soldiers.</p>

  <p>It was so long since Rénée had had any active part in life, any connection
  with the world in which she had been once at home, that she felt lost indeed
  on the tide of momentous events&mdash;a middle-aged provincial out of place
  and out of humour with her surroundings.</p>

  <p>She had meant to present herself to the Princess of Orange; but now she
  lacked the courage to introduce herself once more to Charlotte de Bourbon,
  whom she had not seen since that interview in Delft, a few days after the
  wedding&mdash;and who would probably not know her now, she told herself.</p>

  <p>So she sat day after day in the inn parlour or walked in the crowded
  streets, listening to men talking of the Prince, of the Duke&mdash;seeing the
  magistrates, the French and English lords, the burgher guards, the foreign
  soldiery go by&mdash;hearing always this one theme&mdash;the Prince, would
  the Prince recover?</p>

  <p>How far she seemed to have travelled since his last illness when she had
  helped to nurse him in Rotterdam.</p>

  <p>Then she had tended him with her own hands&mdash;now she must ask news of
  him in the street, like other humble strangers.</p>

  <p>She had not spoken to him since his marriage. Nor, though she lived so
  near to where he had made his modest home, did she think he had ever seen
  her.</p>

  <p>It had always been her fate to never touch his life deeply enough to be
  remembered by him, always been that the man who occupied her entire thoughts
  should never have one thought for her; Rénée had long since accepted this, a
  great calm had come to her with the passing of the years and the tending of a
  little child.</p>

  <p>Yet as she sat now, amidst the strangers of an inn, lonely amid the noise
  and confusion of the magnificent city, she was astonished at the depth of her
  own feeling for the Prince, she marvelled herself at this love which had been
  powerful enough to outlive so much. For she was not thinking now of what the
  loss of the Prince would mean to the Netherlands or to the Reformed Religion,
  of his task unfinished or the triumph of Spain&mdash;she was thinking of the
  man himself, sick and in pain, consumed by anxiety and helpless.</p>

  <p>She had been told that the Duke of Anjou, who was so far proceeding with
  his administration with tolerable discretion, visited him every day and that
  the Prince dictated letters from his sick-bed and still was the guiding
  spirit of the affairs of the Provinces.</p>

  <p>"He will kill himself in this service," she had said, and she felt
  indignant with those who allowed him this labour.</p>

  <p>One day she saw the Count Maurice ride past the windows, though only
  fifteen years of age he appeared in every way a man and to Rénée he seemed
  his uncle Count Louis thus returned to finish the fight he had left
  incomplete.</p>

  <p>She had often seen him in Delft, but the lad had changed; he seemed to
  have assumed the mantle of his race, to be now both a prince and a warrior;
  so firmly and well had he taken his father's place from the very moment that
  Jauregay's shot was fired.</p>

  <p>It was said openly that Anjou was afraid of him and stepped warily for
  fear of the eyes of Maurice.</p>

  <p>The day on which she saw the young Count was afterwards remembered as a
  notable one by Rénée.</p>

  <p>It was cold and stormy and in the afternoon a heavy rain fell.</p>

  <p>Two ladies on horseback dismounted and took shelter in the inn parlour
  where Rénée sat lace-making.</p>

  <p>She looked at the new-comers with interest and they greeted her with ready
  courtesy.</p>

  <p>They were plainly of that world to which she had once belonged, but which
  she had left so long that she felt abashed before these strangers in their
  elegance.</p>

  <p>Yet it was from their manner only that she judged their quality for their
  apparel was not rich.</p>

  <p>Both wore riding suits of dark cloth that had seen good service and little
  plain high-crowned hats with heron plumes.</p>

  <p>They were both of an age, but one far outshone the other in presence and
  beauty.</p>

  <p>She had fixed Rénée's attention from the moment of her entrance.</p>

  <p>Above the middle height, she had an air of dignity and of tranquillity
  very charming to behold; she seemed to Rénée the same type, as she was
  obviously of the same nationality, as Charlotte de Bourbon; but this lady had
  greater beauty and a more worldly air than the Princess, was gayer and more
  full of animation.</p>

  <p>She attracted Rénée as Charlotte had never attracted her; she watched with
  a certain pleasure this graceful creature radiant with youth and health.</p>

  <p>The lady smiled at little Wilhelmina, who was seated by the stove before a
  small pillow of blue linen on which she was carefully pricking out the
  pattern of a design of lace.</p>

  <p>Rénée drew herself a little further into the corner, but the lady looked
  at her, smiled and spoke.</p>

  <p>"I have such good news," she said, "that I must share it with all."</p>

  <p>"Good news?" faltered Rénée, she thought at once of the Prince.</p>

  <p>It seemed that he was also in the stranger's mind. "His Highness
  recovers," she said.</p>

  <p>She took off her wet hat and shook out the dripping heron feather; her
  fair hair, loosened by the wind, hung in ringlets on to her close lawn
  ruff.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Madam!" cried Rénée. "Is this true?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. We have just come from His Highness."</p>

  <p>Rénée stared at her with wonder and envy; she had not then been mistaken
  in supposing that these ladies belonged to the great world.</p>

  <p>"The blood had begun again to flow from the wound," continued the
  stranger, "when the Duke of Anjou's body physician thought of this expedient
  of healing it&mdash;one attendant after another to hold their thumb on the
  place day and night&mdash;and to-day the wound closed."</p>

  <p>"And you may see by the look in His Highness' face that he is mending,"
  added the other lady.</p>

  <p>"God is merciful," said Rénée.</p>

  <p>"The Prince will not be taken until he has done his work," replied the
  stranger who had spoken last.</p>

  <p>But the other turned to her with great earnestness.</p>

  <p>"So you count the powers of darkness so weak?" she asked. "Do we not know
  of those who were foully murdered before their work was done?"</p>

  <p>"Truly I am sorry that the Prince trusts in Valois," returned her
  companion.</p>

  <p>"Uses him, not trusts him, I hope," said the lady; "indeed when I met him
  in the Prince's house to-day it was difficult for me to pass him in
  silence."</p>

  <p>"You are French and you think of Saint Bartholomew?" asked Rénée.</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam," answered the fair stranger.</p>

  <p>"You are a friend of your countrywoman, the Princess?" added Rénée, though
  she did not remember seeing either in Delft.</p>

  <p>"Nay, we are but newly come to the Netherlands. Hitherto our place of
  exile has been Switzerland."</p>

  <p>"I was for long an exile," said Rénée, "but now the Prince has secured for
  us Flemings a place we may call home."</p>

  <p>"You live here?"</p>

  <p>"No, in Delft. I came here because of my great anxiety to hear the truth
  about the condition of the Prince. There were so many rumours."</p>

  <p>"But I doubt if you have come nearer the truth in Antwerp than in Delft,"
  smiled the lady, "therefore I am glad to have met you and to tell you that
  truly His Highness mends&mdash;with my own eyes I saw him this morning. He
  may not yet speak, but he sits up in bed and writes."</p>

  <p>"And the Princess?" asked Rénée.</p>

  <p>"The Princess looked ill. She has hardly left his bedside and seemed worn
  with fear and hope. She said she had been living in the shadow of death ever
  since the Ban was published."</p>

  <p>"Ah, the Ban," shuddered Rénée; that too was her constant terror.</p>

  <p>"It was the Ban and not some French Plot?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Truly I think, though I believe the Valois capable of any baseness. The
  assassin had nought but Spanish papers in his pocket&mdash;a poor fanatical
  fool driven on by that villain his master&mdash;tempted by the rewards
  offered by Spain."</p>

  <p>"And how many others will not that reward tempt?" asked Rénée.</p>

  <p>"We must not think of that," said the stranger.</p>

  <p>Again Rénée looked at the Frenchwoman with a certain pleasure, she
  reminded her of her own lost youth and the days in Brussels, so gallant was
  she in her beauty.</p>

  <p>The dark clouds broke behind the tall tower of the cathedral, a pale sun
  came forth and sparkled in the wet streets.</p>

  <p>A ray came into the dusky inn parlour, fell over the child intent on her
  pins and cushion, the two ladies glanced at the weather and took their leave,
  giving a gentle "adieu" to Rénée.</p>

  <p>She went to the window to watch them ride away and her gaze was almost
  wistful.</p>

  <p>"Who are they?" she asked the wife of the host, who entered with her hands
  full of shining brass platters and dishes. "Do you know those two French
  ladies?"</p>

  <p>"It is the widow of Admiral Coligny, and the fair one is his son's widow,
  Madame de Teligny."</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;they have their residence here?"</p>

  <p>"For the moment they are in Antwerp&mdash;the Princess has received them
  kindly, being her countrywomen. Both widowed by Saint Bartholomew! It is
  strange that they can live under a Valois!"</p>

  <p>"For the moment Anjou is our good friend," said Rénée, but without much
  conviction&mdash;she had heard nothing but distrust and dislike of the Duke
  ever since she had been in Antwerp; but she was loyal to the policy of the
  Prince&mdash;she believed there must be some merit in the man whom he
  protected.</p>

  <p>"We need no good friends of that kind," returned the stout Fleming as she
  arranged her platters on the shelves. "The Prince is our only friend."</p>

  <p>"But Anjou is now our Duke."</p>

  <p>"And a sad thing. Why could not His Highness himself take this charge to
  rule over us as he has done over Holland and Zeeland, instead of giving us
  this Frenchman as our plaster?"</p>

  <p>Rénée smiled; in her heart she agreed with the roughly expressed
  convictions of the housewife; it seemed to her that William was indeed the
  fitting ruler of the country he had himself built up with such immense toil
  and labour.</p>

  <p>But she respected, if she could not altogether understand, William's
  policy in endeavouring to secure for the Netherlands a royal protector and
  the friendship of two great nations by his choice of the Duke of Anjou to
  take the place of Philip as sovereign of the United provinces; and she knew
  also, what had been well hinted abroad, the oaths Anjou had had to take prior
  to his installation as Duke of Brabant, and the way he was bound hand and
  foot by limitations and restrictions until in reality he had little more
  power than the unfortunate Archduke Mathias had possessed.</p>

  <p>What she did not know was that the Frenchman had been quick to notice that
  his position was not that of arbitrary kingship which he had hoped for and
  that he was only waiting his opportunity to assert what he and his followers
  considered his rights.</p>

  <p>The square was now full of sun and revealed a vast sweep of sky behind the
  cathedral; this sky had the blueness of spring.</p>

  <p>Rénée thought of that long dead spring so memorable for her, when she had
  first seen the Prince at Leipsic; how clearly she could recall his
  magnificent figure lightly mounting the stairs to where the bride stood in
  her splendid garments.</p>

  <p>Anne of Saxony was dead now; released for ever from her prison, from her
  shame and misery; and her son was almost a man, and one who had already shown
  himself worthy of his father and his grandfather, the great Elector whose
  name he bore.</p>

  <p>Rénée wondered if the Prince forgave Anne when he looked on her splendid
  boy.</p>

  <p>Rénée opened the lattice and looked out into the street.</p>

  <p>Her mind was still busy with those memories; she recalled Count
  Louis&mdash;a boy he had seemed then, frivolous and shallow.</p>

  <p>When she had found him lolling over the counter of the alchemist's shop
  her judgment of him had been severe.</p>

  <p>Now it was so long since he had gone down in the bloody press of Mooker
  Heyde that men were beginning to forget his name.</p>

  <p>Gone too the young son of the Elector, gone Count Adolphus and Count
  Henry, those youths who had seemed born to ease and pleasure.</p>

  <p>How many were left of that brilliant retinue that had accompanied William
  to Leipsic? Most had met a violent and terrible end for this cause which was
  yet hanging in the balance.</p>

  <p>And now he, the leader, the soul of the enterprise, lay brought near to
  death by that same hand which had crushed the others.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Rénée that Philip was as great as he was awful, that the
  decrees of the Escurial were never in vain.</p>

  <p>As the others had gone so, she thought, William would be taken.</p>

  <p>This attempt had failed, but the next and the next&mdash;if this once a
  miracle had saved him&mdash;there might come a time when the blow would be
  struck more surely.</p>

  <p>And always there were Granvelle and Philip, watching, alert and
  implacable.</p>

  <p>Rénée felt that not all the love of the Netherlands could for ever shield
  William from the deep design and craft of Philip.</p>

  <p>She turned again into the room, put on the child's cloak and led her out
  into the streets now flushed with the full light of the evening sun.</p>

  <p>There was an air of joyousness abroad in Antwerp&mdash;so soon had the
  news spread that the Prince was mending.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-4"
     id="ch3-4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE VICTIM OF JAUREGAY</h2>

  <p class="first">Rénée Le Meuny stayed in Antwerp till after the great
  thanksgiving service for the recovery of the Prince which was offered in the
  cathedral amid the profound joy and emotion of the people.</p>

  <p>Once more she knelt in church behind William, watching that frail figure
  on which the strength of the whole nation depended.</p>

  <p>When the Prince had risen from his sickness he had been anew implored to
  accept for ever the Countship of Holland and Zeeland, and this time had not
  been able to resist the outburst of love and enthusiasm evoked by his peril
  and his recovery.</p>

  <p>Rénée had heard that the Prince was to take the charge of ruling the
  Northern Provinces, they to thus entirely sever their connection with the
  Empire and remain a Republic under his Stadtholdership.</p>

  <p>Thus, so far, the crime inspired by Philip had but served to closely unite
  his enemies in his despite and defiance.</p>

  <p>The Prince's superb constitution had brought him unscathed through the
  ordeal he had undergone; he was neither stooping nor feeble as he stood in
  the great church returning thanks to God for allowing him a few more years of
  toil.</p>

  <p>To Rénée he seemed little changed save that he was pale from loss of blood
  and his simple presence seemed the more splendid beside the glittering
  magnificence of the deformed Anjou.</p>

  <p>The new Duke of Brabant was on his right hand and on his left was Count
  Maurice girt with a sword and wearing the air of a man.</p>

  <p>But the Princess was not there.</p>

  <p>This surprised Rénée; she had heard that Charlotte had a light fever, but
  she had not supposed it serious enough to prevent her staying away on this
  great occasion.</p>

  <p>The next day Rénée was preparing to return to Delft when she received the
  news, then flying from mouth to mouth, and making a commotion in the city,
  that the Princess's illness was so suddenly grave that the physician had
  little hope of saving her life.</p>

  <p>The news gave Rénée a curious shock; the Princess was nothing to her, she
  told herself, had now indeed become almost a stranger.</p>

  <p>But the curious feeling of tenderness that had come over her when she had
  spoken to Charlotte after her marriage, revived in her now.</p>

  <p>No one had thought much about the Princess during the long strain of the
  Prince's illness, now it was over and she was dying they might judge how she
  had suffered.</p>

  <p>Rénée could imagine what a life of anxiety and tension she had led since
  the publication of the Ban, she could understand how her strength, already
  enfeebled, had been lavishly spent in the service of the Prince; she had done
  more than she was able and now she paid.</p>

  <p>Jauregay had found a victim after all; Philip might now add another to his
  list, a woman's name, as surely killed by him as had been Egmont or
  Montigny.</p>

  <p>Rénée recalled the old days at Heidelberg with a strange affection.</p>

  <p>She could not grudge Charlotte a happiness which had been so dearly paid
  for and so short-lived.</p>

  <p>Leaving little Wilhelmina in charge of the host's wife Rénée went to the
  Prince's house near the citadel and asked if she might wait upon the
  Princess.</p>

  <p>There seemed little hope of this request being granted in such a moment,
  but Rénée gave her name to the usher.</p>

  <p>Charlotte had always lived in a fashion so modest and simple that there
  was nothing strange in humble folk demanding her presence.</p>

  <p>The reception of Anjou in Antwerp was the first time since her own wedding
  on which the Princess had mingled in any kind of pomp.</p>

  <p>Hitherto she had lived like any burgher's wife in the quiet house in
  Delft, tending her own children and those of Anne of Saxony with equal
  devotion and care.</p>

  <p>After a little delay Rénée was admitted to the antechamber.</p>

  <p>"The Princess is then not so ill," she thought, "or they would never have
  brought me here."</p>

  <p>A chamber-woman came forward and asked her name: "If you are Rénée le
  Meuny who was at Heidelberg, Her Highness will see you."</p>

  <p>"I am Rénée le Meuny."</p>

  <p>"Will you then come to the bed of the Princess, madam?" Rénée passed from
  the crowded anteroom into the bedroom.</p>

  <p>She felt surprised that Charlotte should have remembered her, yet it would
  have been strange if the Princess should have forgotten those long first days
  of her exile when Rénée was her constant companion.</p>

  <p>The bedroom was dark, and furnished by a set of tapestries representing
  sea pieces, brought by the Princess from Delft.</p>

  <p>The bed itself, of huge proportions, was hung with purple satin and
  covered with a quilt of needlework. Charlotte de Bourbon was sitting up,
  propped by pillows.</p>

  <p>She was so changed that she seemed only a remembrance of her former
  self.</p>

  <p>Rénée would hardly have recognized in this ghastly and haggard woman the
  blooming girl of Heidelberg or the fair matron of Delft.</p>

  <p>Death had already embraced Charlotte de Bourbon and the imprint of his
  cold kiss was on her cheek.</p>

  <p>She saw Rénée at once and smiled.</p>

  <p>That smile went to Rénée's heart; the tears filled her eyes as she stood
  hesitant on the threshold.</p>

  <p>The room was full of people&mdash;pastors, women officials, ushers and
  children.</p>

  <p>The Prince was not there, being engaged in the affairs of 14 the city, but
  it was the first time that day he had left her and then only on the assurance
  of the physicians that she was better.</p>

  <p>The Princess had indeed shown such an increase of strength that hopes
  began to be entertained of her recovery.</p>

  <p>Even now a doctor was bending down to assure her that the fever was past
  and she had only to rest and wait for strength.</p>

  <p>Charlotte de Bourbon looked up at him and slightly shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I feel the life here," and she laid her hand above her heart, "leaving
  me."</p>

  <p>Rénée had now reached the bedside.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you have come," said Charlotte earnestly. "Highness, I could
  not hope that you would recall me." Charlotte smiled.</p>

  <p>"You always played a part with me, Rénée le Meuny. Tell me the truth now,
  I am surely dying."</p>

  <p>Rénée stood with bent head; she was alone with the Princess in the shadow
  of the bed curtains; the others had withdrawn to the back of the chamber.</p>

  <p>"I wished to see your Highness," said Rénée at last. Charlotte lay silent,
  gazing at her. Her very eyes appeared pallid, and her figure was supported on
  so many cushions it seemed to be utterly without life.</p>

  <p>Now that Rénée's vision became used to the dim shadows of the bedplace she
  saw that the Princess's right arm was folded round a bundle of fine
  linen.</p>

  <p>It reminded Rénée of that bundle she had taken from the old woman's arms
  in Rotterdam seven years ago.</p>

  <p>"The baby," she said.</p>

  <p>"My last baby," answered Charlotte. "They call her Emilia Secunda."</p>

  <p>Rénée bent lower and looked at the face sleeping so peacefully.</p>

  <p>"See what the nuns miss," smiled Charlotte, then she added: "I am sorry to
  have brought His Highness nothing but girls."</p>

  <p>"What should the Prince need with sons?" asked Rénée.</p>

  <p>"True he has his heir, if ever God release him from that Spain. And he has
  Maurice."</p>

  <p>She looked at Rénée with a certain wistfulness.</p>

  <p>"I tried to make Maurice love me. Do you not think him a noble boy?"</p>

  <p>"A knight like Count Louis."</p>

  <p>"I meant him to redeem it all&mdash;the Saxon marriage&mdash;his mother's
  life. And having no sons of my own&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her eyes remained open but their sudden light seemed to fail.</p>

  <p>"I can hear the shot now," she added. "I have never slept of nights since
  the Ban. Did you think they would do that&mdash;put a price on his head? Even
  Philip&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused and her head sank a little to one side: Rénée knelt on the wide
  bed step to be nearer to her; the curtains enclosed them.</p>

  <p>"You live in Delft?" said the Princess suddenly.</p>

  <p>Rénée flushed hotly; she had imagined she was so safely hidden in the old
  house in the church square, and all the while the Princess had known.</p>

  <p>"I would have had you for my friend," continued Charlotte, "but I saw you
  did not wish it."</p>

  <p>"Nay, madam," cried Rénée. "I have been so useless, I did think myself
  forgotten of all. I am the keeper of the church now the old man is dead."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Charlotte.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;and I have a little child I brought up&mdash;a refugee's child,
  madam."</p>

  <p>"I know that, also."</p>

  <p>"&mdash;and these things made my life. Why should I think of such as Your
  Highness?"</p>

  <p>Charlotte smiled in silence and Rénée shivered lest her long concealed
  secret was at last discovered.</p>

  <p>"The Prince too considered you as his friend and would have been glad to
  have had you in his house," said Charlotte.</p>

  <p>Rénée looked up; she saw that the Princess did not know.</p>

  <p>"But why speak of these things?" continued Charlotte. "These days are
  over&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, madam, we shall all return to Delft."</p>

  <p>"My life is over."</p>

  <p>"Your Highness must not think so."</p>

  <p>"Rénée, do not maintain with me the pitiful fiction of the doctor towards
  his patient. I would I could live since my lord lives. But I feel my strength
  go from me as water goes from a vessel."</p>

  <p>The child stirred in her arm and she was too weak to lift her up.</p>

  <p>"Put her on the other side," she said to Rénée. "So&mdash;my little
  girl&mdash;see what fair hair she has. Think&mdash;she may live to see the
  strife over and all these present wounds healed."</p>

  <p>"Her life will see the death of Philip," returned Rénée. A long shudder
  shook the Princess.</p>

  <p>"Think you that my lord will escape Philip?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Has he not just been saved, as by the direct hand of God?"</p>

  <p>Charlotte was silent a moment; then she said, under her breath:</p>

  <p>"I rejoice that I must die first."</p>

  <p>She touched the hand Rénée rested on the edge of the quilt.</p>

  <p>"Go to my house in Delft after I am dead and ask for my chamber-woman. I
  have thought of you and your little child. Stay in Delft, near him. He needs
  all his friends."</p>

  <p>"My dwelling will never change."</p>

  <p>"And if His Highness marries again, wait on that lady and seek to be a
  friend to her. Look you, he will marry, he is not one who can live
  alone."</p>

  <p>Her fingers tightened over Rénée's hand.</p>

  <p>"You remember the days in Heidelberg?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, madam!"</p>

  <p>"I knew so little. I only guessed at life."</p>

  <p>Her eyes closed and she seemed to think profoundly;</p>

  <p>Rénée waited, listening to the sick woman's difficult breath.</p>

  <p>"Was it not strange, my marriage?" said Charlotte. "I have wondered since
  where I found the courage to do what I did."</p>

  <p>Rénée was silent; her life had given her no chance for courage or action;
  but she believed she also could have fulfilled a noble destiny.</p>

  <p>"And now it is all over. And I have been with him such a short while. You
  remember how we used to speak of him? And Count Louis? I saw him last night
  in my dream&mdash;I dreamt of Mooker Heyde."</p>

  <p>"Strange that your Highness should think now of Mooker Heyde."</p>

  <p>"I did dream of that&mdash;and as the fever overcame me I heard the rush
  of armies and saw the three young Princes all stained with blood and they
  encouraged me&mdash;saying&mdash;'You too, who are only a woman, can die in
  this quarrel,' and I saw all the marsh, black and wet."</p>

  <p>Her head drooped lower and she took her hand from Rénée and laid it above
  her heart.</p>

  <p>"I have so little time," she continued with a faint smile "Lift me up, for
  I feel as if I fall into the blackness of nothingness."</p>

  <p>Rénée raised her on the deep pillows and gently taking the child from her
  laid it on the side of the bed.</p>

  <p>Charlotte moved a little and seemed to stretch her limbs as with a slight
  sigh of ease or relief.</p>

  <p>"I feel as if I have done nothing," she murmured, "and I meant to do so
  much, though it is well that we do not know how short a time we have or we
  should not have the courage to go on."</p>

  <p>She lifted her shadowed eyes and looked up at Rénée's face.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;" she asked with great earnestness, "you think I have failed?
  You must have thought that I had a presumption in marrying His Highness."</p>

  <p>Rénée laughed weakly.</p>

  <p>"I brought him nothing. I meant to do so much to help build this nation
  up. I had dreams of great things. It has just been a round of little cares
  and one long anxiety."</p>

  <p>Her lips trembled and her eyes closed; it seemed to Rénée that she was
  very weak.</p>

  <p>Rénée moved back and looked round the heavy curtains to call some one; but
  Charlotte heard and stretched out her hand.</p>

  <p>"Do not go," she said.</p>

  <p>Rénée took the cold fingers.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," said Charlotte de Bourbon. "May your life be blessed at last
  in the name of God and His Reformed religion."</p>

  <p>When she had spoken she lay silent, breathing slowly and with
  difficulty.</p>

  <p>Rénée bent and kissed her hand, then left the deep shadow of the bed.</p>

  <p>She saw the silent people moving from the door and the Prince
  entering.</p>

  <p>Without a glance about him, he came to the bedside of his wife and Rénée
  shrank into the crowd.</p>

  <p>She went her way and that afternoon taught the child a new pattern in
  lace-making.</p>

  <p>Two days later the Princess died and Rénée was one of the two thousand
  that followed her funeral.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch3-5"
     id="ch3-5"></a>V. &mdash; THE LITTLE CLERK</h2>

  <p class="first">Of all those who heard the news of the thanksgiving in
  Antwerp that celebrated the recovery of the Prince of Orange, none received a
  keener shock of bitter personal disappointment than a certain little clerk,
  in the employment of John Duprêle, secretary to Count Mansfield, Governor of
  the County of Luxembourg.</p>

  <p>When this little clerk had heard of the supposed death of William of
  Orange he had gone on his knees and thanked God.</p>

  <p>"Not only for the justice done on a great traitor," he said, "but also
  because now there is no need for me to put myself in danger."</p>

  <p>For this Balthazar Gerard had for five years nourished an idea.</p>

  <p>It was no less than the assassination of the Prince of Orange.</p>

  <p>This fanatical desire had been flamed by the publication of the Ban and
  motives of cupidity tinged the promptings of religious fervour.</p>

  <p>These intermingled feelings returned with renewed strength when he heard
  of the marvellous recovery of the Prince.</p>

  <p>As a preliminary step he resigned his appointment, and proceeded to
  Trêves, which city he had selected because it was the seat of a large Jesuit
  college.</p>

  <p>It was the intention of Balthazar Gerard to obtain the advice of these
  holy fathers before proceeding further on his way.</p>

  <p>His journey was considerably lightened by news from the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Anjou and his minions had broken loose and set the French
  soldiery on to Antwerp, pillaging that rich and unfortunate city as
  thoroughly as had the Spaniards during the famous mutiny.</p>

  <p>The Prince of Orange, so the report said, had been completely deceived,
  and had trusted, in common with the magistrates, to the oaths sworn by Anjou
  as Duke of Brabant and sovereign of the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>Therefore, although in the city at the time, he found himself without
  means to make any resistance against the assault of the French troops.</p>

  <p>At the same moment a concerted attempt had been made on Dunkirk, Bruges,
  Vilvorde and Ghent, the intention of the Duke being to exclusively establish
  the Romanist religion, make himself absolute master of the Provinces and
  deprive William of the sovereignty of the Northern States.</p>

  <p>Whether this plan had been wholly successful or not did not yet appear,
  but at least, it was obvious that the Prince of Orange had nourished a
  creature as dangerous and poisonous as any sent against him by Philip and
  that the infant commonwealth had found for a protector one who was ready to
  put his sword to her throat and his hand in her pocket.</p>

  <p>Gerard dined at a humble inn and was further heartened by hearing of the
  success of the Duke of Parma, who had taken instant advantage of the
  confusion caused in the Netherlanders by the action of Anjou.</p>

  <p>"But none of these successes are of any use while Orange lives," said one
  sitting near to Gerard, and the eyes of the little clerk gleamed as he nodded
  in silence.</p>

  <p>That night before he went to bed he prayed for these three great Princes,
  the King of Spain, the Duke of Parma and the Duke of Anjou.</p>

  <p>And he added a humble petition that he might be permitted to be the
  instrument to remove that odious heretic and very cunning villain, William of
  Orange.</p>

  <p>The next morning he presented himself at the college of the Jesuits and,
  by the use of Count Mansfield's name, obtained an audience of the regent.</p>

  <p>There were two priests in the room; one sat at a table and the other stood
  behind him.</p>

  <p>Gerard soon saw that the seated personage was the regent of the college
  and made a low obeisance, kissing the fingers that the priest extended.</p>

  <p>"You have important business?" asked the Jesuit with some severity; he was
  a man of a graceful figure and a noble pose; he looked with some disapproval
  at the meagre person of the little clerk. "You have sent me an impression of
  Count Mansfield's seals," he added and he glanced at the imprint in red wax
  Gerard had sent in with the name of the Governor of Luxembourg. "Has Count
  Mansfield sent you?"</p>

  <p>"No, I stole the seals, reverend father."</p>

  <p>The Jesuit leant back in his chair and looked narrowly at the little man
  before him.</p>

  <p>"You stole the seals?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I was in the employment of the Count's secretary and I took the
  impress of all the seals&mdash;for which sin I need absolution."</p>

  <p>The Jesuit did not answer.</p>

  <p>He saw a young man, narrow-chested, undersized, with a bilious complexion,
  muddy eyes and bad teeth, with an air of timidity and reserve; his whole
  personality appeared one of utter insignificance.</p>

  <p>His clothes were of a piece with his figure, worn and out of fashion, but
  neat and clean.</p>

  <p>The Jesuit looked at him with scant favour, he did not believe that such
  an one could have anything to say worth hearing; yet he was rather interested
  in the story of Mansfield's seals.</p>

  <p>"Why did you steal these seals?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I thought they would be useful in gaining the confidence of the rebels,"
  Gerard replied. "I know the taking of them was a great sin against God and
  Count Mansfield. And for that I hope to be forgiven."</p>

  <p>"Why should you wish to go among the rebels?" demanded the Jesuit.</p>

  <p>"Reverend father," he said, "I hope to kill the Prince of Orange. I have
  had this design for six years."</p>

  <p>"My son," said the regent with more friendliness than he had yet shown,
  "you show a laudable spirit."</p>

  <p>"And now I require advice as to how I may set about this business."</p>

  <p>The two Jesuits exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you think that I am presumptuous," added Gerard.</p>

  <p>"I certainly think the affair holds many difficulties," returned the
  priest.</p>

  <p>"I am prepared for them&mdash;and for the danger," said the little
  clerk.</p>

  <p>The Jesuit pondered.</p>

  <p>The project broached by Gerard was certainly one which he was bound to
  encourage; at the same time he knew that ever since the publication of the
  Ban the Low Countries had swarmed with men eager to take the life of William
  of Orange, and where all these had failed it was not in the least likely that
  this obscure little civilian would succeed.</p>

  <p>"What grounds have you for hopes in this enterprise?" asked the Jesuit at
  last. "You have heard of the attempts of Salseda and Baza&mdash;and later
  Pietro Dovdogno?"</p>

  <p>"All these things I know," returned the little clerk patiently, "and
  certainly these gentlemen were unfortunate&mdash;and it is for the very
  reason of the failure of these others that I have resolved to do the deed
  myself.</p>

  <p>"This is a spirit much to be commended," said the regent of the Jesuits,
  "and may God bless your holy ardour. Yet I cannot but see danger and trouble
  in this matter of the forging of Count Mansfield's seals."</p>

  <p>"For that I am sorry, as I said," returned Gerard, "and wish your
  absolution."</p>

  <p>"Let it not rest on your conscience, my son," answered the priest. "And so
  surely as you accomplish this plan so you shall not only be forgiven this
  theft, but be ennobled and rewarded."</p>

  <p>"And if I lose my life?" asked Gerard.</p>

  <p>"Then you shall be enrolled among the company of saintly martyrs who have
  suffered for the Holy Faith."</p>

  <p>A look of exalted enthusiasm shone in Gerard's pale eyes.</p>

  <p>"Will you give me your blessing, reverend father?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Assuredly, and all the spiritual comfort that may be."</p>

  <p>Here the other priest, thinking his superior was transgressing the limits
  of prudence, touched him lightly on the sleeve and smoothly addressed
  Gerard.</p>

  <p>"We Jesuits deal more in affairs of the other world than in this," he
  remarked, "and I should advise that this business was laid before His
  Highness, the Prince of Parma."</p>

  <p>Gerard looked disappointed, as he had hoped for more introductions and
  perhaps money; he did not need to come to Trêves to be told to put his plan
  before Philip's general.</p>

  <p>But the regent of the Jesuits had taken the cue from his secretary.</p>

  <p>"It would be ill accepted by all," he said, "if we were to meddle in
  politics, and certainly I can give you no better advice than to do this."</p>

  <p>Meagre and miserable he looked, and little hope had either of the priests
  that he would ever get as far as the presence of Parma.</p>

  <p>"Our blessing and our encouragement," said the Jesuit, "and if you are
  determined on this course&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Gerard drew himself erect.</p>

  <p>"You think I am too mean to accomplish this thing?" he asked quietly.</p>

  <p>Out of his humility, his commonplace servility and abnegation something
  seemed to emanate that held silent the two priests, who till now had held him
  hardly worth the time he occupied by his discourse.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you think it is not for me," continued Gerard, "but this man must
  die. It was certain even before the publication of the Ban," he said. "As it
  was certain who would be the instrument. I&mdash;Balthazar Gerard. I tell you
  that was bound to be, for I am he who is to do this task."</p>

  <p>"He who is so convinced of the success of his mission is well armed,"
  returned the Jesuit. "Get you to Father Gery, the Franciscan at Tournay, and
  he will give you letters to some one about Parma's person."</p>

  <p>"I will go to Tournay to-morrow," said Gerard resolutely. The priest
  opened a box and took out a gold piece which he handed to the little
  clerk.</p>

  <p>"This will help you on your way, my son," he said; "His Highness will
  further supply you if he thinks well of your story."</p>

  <p>"Whether the Prince of Parma is willing or no to pay my expenses I will
  carry this thing through."</p>

  <p>The Jesuit gave Gerard his blessing and instructions where to find Father
  Gery at Tournay, and the Burgundian left the college and returned to his
  chamber under the leads of the inn.</p>

  <p>Besides the Jesuit's charity all that he possessed in the world were a few
  white bits and the residue of the miserable savings with which he had left
  Luxembourg&mdash;a hoard he wished to leave untouched. This, however, did not
  in the least dishearten him, he did not doubt that his further needs would be
  supplied.</p>

  <p>He was sorry not to have received more direct and definite assistance, but
  rested on the interview with Father Gery.</p>

  <p>After prayer and telling his beads he crept downstairs to the tavern
  kitchen, from whence issued a rich smell of cooking that had roused his
  appetite.</p>

  <p>Shivering in among the bolder and more prosperous folk who were crowding
  round the table, or the fire, with their plates and dishes, Balthazar Gerard
  ordered a frugal meal and listened eagerly to the political gossip that was
  passing.</p>

  <p>The news from the Netherlands was not so triumphant as had at first
  seemed; the burghers of Antwerp had flown to arms, and had driven forth the
  treacherous French with great loss; Anjou himself had been forced to flee,
  leaving behind him even his personal effects, and the city remained in the
  hands of the Prince of Orange.</p>

  <p>The similar attempts on the other cities of the Netherlands had likewise
  failed.</p>

  <p>The little clerk was vexed, but he did not lose heart.</p>

  <p>"All these troubles will be ended when I have dispatched the Prince of
  Orange," he thought as he munched his supper, which comforted him
  marvellously.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-6"
     id="ch3-6"></a>VI. &mdash; IN DELFT</h2>

  <p class="first">"What have I accomplished," said William of Orange, "after
  so much danger, so many losses?&mdash;nothing."</p>

  <p>He quietly folded up and sealed the packet of papers that he had been
  reading; papers that showed what base treachery, what low motives and ignoble
  cunning were undermining the fabric of the new republic he was so laboriously
  erecting amid the stormy politics of Europe.</p>

  <p>Among these documents that he put by was a letter from Catherine de Medici
  left behind in her son's lodging on his flight from Antwerp, which urged him
  to re-establish the Catholic religion in the Netherlands and promised him the
  hand of the Infanta of Spain as a reward.</p>

  <p>The other papers proved the fact that Anjou was holding secret meeting
  with the agents of Parma and that the extent of his demands was the only
  reason why the bargain had not yet been concluded by which he was to sell
  himself to Spain.</p>

  <p>The powerful Prince who was to protect the Provinces had proved an
  impudent adventurer, empty of shame and capable only of mean attempts at his
  own aggrandisement, regardless alike of honour, policy or prudence.</p>

  <p>Parma dealt with him simply because there was only one sickly life between
  him and the throne of France, and for the same reason William had to disguise
  his wrath and contempt; France must not be offended, nor Elizabeth of
  England, who also had her word to say for this miserable Anjou.</p>

  <p>He locked his desk and went into the outer room that looked on the
  courtyard; he was expecting his brother John and Ste. Aldegonde.</p>

  <p>It was strange to find himself alone; he was so used to business occupying
  every minute of his time.</p>

  <p>He seated himself in the great black chair by the fireplace and reviewed
  the result of his long labours&mdash;a position perilous and doubtful, a task
  but half achieved.</p>

  <p>He had founded a republic in the Northern States, but he had not yet
  accomplished that union of the Provinces which he had striven for from the
  first moment of his defiance of Philip, and the treachery of Anjou rendered
  this object yet more difficult of attainment.</p>

  <p>He had been betrayed by one in whom he had believed, whom he had placed in
  a position of trust and honour.</p>

  <p>The defection of the Duke of Anjou, his attempt to seize by force the
  Netherland cities entrusted to his protection, his secret plots with Parma
  had rendered the position of the Prince of Orange even more delicate and
  perilous than it had been before.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for him to openly break with the French and found a
  Union of the States independent of all outside assistance, for he knew well
  that the Provinces were still too weak to stand alone.</p>

  <p>Even such as Anjou must be tolerated rather than range against them such
  powerful enemies as France and England&mdash;for they had no other friends.
  The Empire was cold and Germany almost openly hostile, while in Alexander
  Farnese the Prince had an opponent, beside whom even Alva had been as
  nothing.</p>

  <p>Brilliant, subtle, unscrupulous, equally an adept at the game of war and
  the game of politics, the Prince of Parma was an enemy to be feared.</p>

  <p>And William did fear him, as much as it was in his nature to fear any one,
  for in Parma he was matched with a man who called forth his utmost skill and
  daring.</p>

  <p>In the first intercepted correspondence he had noted with what art Parma
  played Anjou, how he had read that rogue, and was using him&mdash;and at
  Spain's own price.</p>

  <p>Philip's fifth Governor seemed to be able to accomplish the almost
  superhuman task of ruling that confusion to which tyranny and bigotry had
  reduced the Spanish administration in the Low Countries.</p>

  <p>William felt neither baffled nor daunted by the Italian Prince, but to a
  certain extent he felt himself held in check by him and saw himself as
  considerably weakened as the enemy was considerably strengthened by the
  betrayal of Anjou.</p>

  <p>A great weariness came over him as he surveyed the vast field of the
  endless struggle, for though he knew himself full of health and vigour, still
  his best years were behind him.</p>

  <p>"And what have I accomplished?" he asked himself again. "If one of Spain's
  hired rogues was to kill me tomorrow would this work I have done endure?"</p>

  <p>A melancholy touched him at the thought. There was Maurice, he had great
  hopes of Maurice&mdash;but he might be taken before his son was a man, while
  his heir, Count Buren, remained in the hands of Philip.</p>

  <p>But the future&mdash;that was still his&mdash;still stretched ahead of
  him.</p>

  <p>Much might be accomplished, much should be accomplished if Philip's
  assassins did not succeed in adding his name to that long list in the drawer
  of the King's private bureau in the Escurial.</p>

  <p>A sad smile touched William's lips as he reflected how completely it was
  in the power of any mean ruffian to end and therefore largely destroy his
  work.</p>

  <p>Even now, bitterly as he had been disappointed in Anjou, he began at once
  to consider how he might best repair the damage caused by his treachery and
  still make use of this base son of France.</p>

  <p>His brother and Ste. Aldegonde came upon him while he was thus deep in
  reflection.</p>

  <p>They reproached him with the ease with which they had been able to enter
  his presence&mdash;there was not even a sentry at the gate.</p>

  <p>"Nay, there should have been," smiled William. "I must keep more
  state."</p>

  <p>Count John looked at him.</p>

  <p>"You make a jest of it," he said, "but others cannot forget the Ban."</p>

  <p>The Prince looked at the only brother this quarrel had left him.</p>

  <p>"Think you I can evade the Ban by a sentry at the door?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You can take precautions," replied Ste. Aldegonde anxiously.</p>

  <p>The Prince smiled again, not in bravado but in resignation.</p>

  <p>"To take precautions is to die a thousand times," he answered, "to suspect
  all who come near me, to doubt the bread I eat, the water I drink&mdash;and I
  have lived too long in this easy fashion. I cannot now adopt a close
  suspicious habit."</p>

  <p>"Yet it were well your Grace did," said Count John gravely, "for the spies
  of Spain are in every part."</p>

  <p>"And therefore it is useless to avoid them," laughed the Prince, taking
  his brother's arm and rising; "remember I am a Calvinist. What God ordains
  man may not avoid."</p>

  <p>"Amen," said Ste. Aldegonde. "Yet your Highness might have a sentry at the
  gate."</p>

  <p>"You shall be satisfied," said the Prince, still smiling, then, as he
  looked from one face to another&mdash;his two faithful lieutenants, the only
  two left of those who had started with him in the morning of this enterprise,
  the sudden tears smote his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said with an effort, "let us get to our politics."</p>

  <p>With a charming, half deprecating gesture he laid his hand on his
  brother's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I fear I shall displease you," he said, almost wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness is ever doing that," returned the Count with a certain
  grimness, for he guessed what the Prince was going to say.</p>

  <p>"Ay," added Ste. Aldegonde, "we have had some inkling of your Highness's
  intentions from your letters."</p>

  <p>"And what has brought me to Delft but the hope to dissuade you," said
  Count John, "since I have long ago left all active part in the governing of
  these Provinces of yours-but I do suppose it is useless to argue with
  you."</p>

  <p>"Quite useless," answered the Prince quietly.</p>

  <p>"Then," said the Count bluntly, "I am to believe that you refuse the
  sovereignty of these Provinces, so often urged?"</p>

  <p>"I refuse any honour but that I have as the chief magistrate of these
  Northern States."</p>

  <p>"And instead offer the country to that false rogue, Anjou?"</p>

  <p>"Brother," said William gravely, "we must not offend France."</p>

  <p>"As soon Spain as France&mdash;if there must be a tyrant why not keep the
  old one?" asked the Count with some bitterness.</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde was silent; though he heartily approved of what the Count
  said he did not feel at much liberty to endorse him, as he had been of those
  most completely deceived in Anjou, one of those who had most warmly urged him
  on William.</p>

  <p>"I cannot enter now," said the Prince, "into all those fine arguments and
  devious reasonings which have made me so hold my mind, even after this rude
  treachery which shows how poor a creature is this French Duke. But this I
  know and do maintain that without some powerful foreign Prince to set against
  Philip we are no better than lost. And at this moment no one offers but this
  Anjou."</p>

  <p>"A vermin," said Count John.</p>

  <p>"A son of France," answered William drily, "and the friend of England.
  Parma cannot offend him, do you think we dare to?"</p>

  <p>"Better offend him than give him our throats to cut," returned his
  brother.</p>

  <p>"He did not succeed before in his attempt on our liberties, and this time
  shall be so hedged about he will be powerless&mdash;believe me, I have played
  better men than Anjou to my own ends."</p>

  <p>Ste. Aldegonde answered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"That is where we are sore, Highness. Why should you play other men? Why
  not yourself, this is your work&mdash;take the reward of it!"</p>

  <p>William knew that in these blunt, almost rough words of his old friend,
  was expressed the sentiment of the whole people whom he had liberated and
  championed, but he was not moved.</p>

  <p>"I am a landless man with a price on my head," he answered simply, "and
  such is not the man the Provinces need."</p>

  <p>There was nothing to be said in answer to the bold truth of the first
  statement, but Count John replied stoutly to the second.</p>

  <p>"You and you only are the man this nation needs, no Prince could mean to
  the Netherlands what you mean." William shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You will not persuade me," he answered. "If my first reason was not
  strong enough I have yet another."</p>

  <p>"What other can there be?" asked Ste. Aldegonde, "since it is impossible
  that your Highness is afraid of the dangers of the post."</p>

  <p>"Nay," replied William simply. "I had not thought of that, and as for
  dangers I do believe I am already involved up to the neck in them and have
  nothing more to lose but my life, and that worth but a poor price."</p>

  <p>"What other consideration then can move you?" demanded Count John.</p>

  <p>William looked straightly at him as he answered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I have lost everything&mdash;and without regret, I have endured much and
  shall not lament, there is one thing I will do for my own sake, one course I
  will take to please myself&mdash;I will not make it possible for men to say I
  have done what I have done for ambition. I will not be open to the charge
  that in this struggle I have found my advantage."</p>

  <p>They spoke to him no more about his acceptance of these honours, but in
  their hearts they were not convinced.</p>

  <p>When he was alone again William went to the window and looked out into the
  cold twilight. The quiet night seemed full of figures, pressing onwards to
  new events, new struggles, new victories.</p>

  <p>Philip was there and Parma-but William did not see a third&mdash;the
  shabby figure of a little clerk walking the dusty road from Trêves to Tournay
  to save the coach fare.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-7"
     id="ch3-7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE PRINCE OF PARMA</h2>

  <p class="first">Balthazar Gerard had his interview with Father Gery at
  Tournay and received much encouragement from that learned Franciscan whereby
  he was considerably heartened and strengthened in his project.</p>

  <p>But this priest had the same delicacy as the Jesuits of</p>

  <p>Trêves in mingling with affairs politic and could give Gerard no practical
  assistance beyond repeating the advice to lay the matter before the Prince of
  Parma.</p>

  <p>He supplied some money for the present meagre needs of the little clerk
  and urged him to put his case without delay before the Governor of the
  Netherlands.</p>

  <p>But he was still baffled by his insignificance and his poverty.</p>

  <p>His few miserable savings he had hitherto kept untouched, for he was
  haunted by the fear that he might be baulked in his design by actual lack of
  pence.</p>

  <p>The months went by and he still hung about Tournay, earning a little money
  by clerk's work, brooding ever on the same idea.</p>

  <p>He had frequent recourse to Father Gery and was an enthusiastic attendant
  at the Franciscan church.</p>

  <p>At last in the spring, and, as he realized with impatience, nearly two
  years since Jauregay's attempt, he resolved to wait no longer for some
  outside assistance which seemed as if it was indeed never forthcoming, but to
  follow the advice of Father Gery and seek out the Prince of Parma.</p>

  <p>Accordingly he packed his poor belongings into a wallet that he strapped
  on to his back and proceeded to near Oudenarde, where the Governor then held
  his court and camp, having profited by the treachery of Anjou to advance into
  the enemy's country and cast his eye on Bruges and Ghent.</p>

  <p>Before he had left Tournay Gerard had written a letter in which he set
  forth what he proposed to do and his reasons for doing it; one copy of this
  letter he left in the hands of the Principal of the Franciscan college, the
  other he kept inside his shabby doublet for presentation to Parma.</p>

  <p>At Oudenarde, then but recently captured from the rebels, he again put
  himself in touch with the priests, quoting Father Gery, and by this means
  obtained an introduction to one of the councillors of the Prince, a certain
  D'Assonleville, to whom he delivered the letter he had written for Parma.</p>

  <p>While he was waiting for a response to this epistle he heard the news that
  the fourth marriage of the Prince of Orange, that with Louise de Teligny, had
  been rendered popular by the birth of a son.</p>

  <p>Gerard heard this news with a yet grimmer determination to remove one who
  still further added to his manifold offences by this blasphemous marriage
  with the daughter-in-law of that arch heretic Coligny.</p>

  <p>A few days after the delivery of his letter, he was summoned into the
  presence of the Prince of Parma, who had but recently returned from an attack
  on Ypres and Bruges&mdash;which two cities he looked to see soon fall into
  his hands.</p>

  <p>Parma had not been particularly impressed by the letter Gerard had written
  with so much pains and enthusiasm, and he was cynical of any one succeeding
  in taking the life of the Prince of Orange, so many had tried and failed, so
  many had taken payment and not even tried, and William was now established
  and guarded in the city of Delft among his own people and it was by no means
  easy for any foreigner to gain access to the city.</p>

  <p>Therefore, though Parma had been long looking for some one to rid him of
  the man who was effectually preventing him from reducing the chronic
  rebellion of the Netherlands, he would not have accorded an interview to the
  runaway civilian if Gerard in his letter had not spoken of a new plan by
  which to reach the person of the Prince&mdash;"a trap to bait the fox."</p>

  <p>These words interested Parma, for hitherto all attempts on William had
  been direct&mdash;to get him by guile was a scheme that recommended itself to
  the subtle Alexander Farnese.</p>

  <p>He received Gerard in the plain room of the modest house he occupied when
  in Oudenarde; the Prince of wholly martial tastes and not given to any
  frivolity or display though his life was full of a sombre magnificence, he
  held no court in the proper sense of the word and fixed his residence where
  he pitched his camp during a vice-royalty that was one long campaign.
  D'Assonleville conducted Gerard into the presence of the Prince, who was
  alone with Haultfenne, another of his councillors.</p>

  <p>The only splendour in the apartment gathered in the person of Parma, whose
  bronze satins were closely worked with pearl and gold, whose triple ruff was
  of finest lace and whose sword and baldrick shone with jewels.</p>

  <p>He stood in the embrasure of the latticed window and faced Gerard directly
  on his entrance.</p>

  <p>Tall, with the powerful and graceful figure of an athlete and the carriage
  of an accomplished swordsman, his features were of a serene and regular
  beauty, his complexion pale, his expression at once cold and haughty. His
  face was marred by the eyes, which were hard and steady and something
  menacing in their look.</p>

  <p>Such was the person who directed his searching and contemptuous glance at
  Balthazar Gerard; a glance before which many a more exalted individual had
  quailed.</p>

  <p>But the little clerk returned his scrutiny with the same self-possession
  and absolute calm with which he had fronted the priests at Trêves and at
  Tournay.</p>

  <p>He was not abashed either by Alexander's splendid presence nor
  discouraging frown, but stepped into the centre of the room and made his
  reverence.</p>

  <p>The Prince came to the point.</p>

  <p>"You have a project to remove William of Nassau?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness," said Gerard, "I have had this project for seven
  years."</p>

  <p>"And it was quickened by the publication of the Ban, eh?" demanded Parma
  cynically.</p>

  <p>Gerard eyed him without flinching.</p>

  <p>"For the matter of my reward I will trust to the liberality of His
  Majesty. I do not do this for money&mdash;<i>but because of the unalterable
  determination I have to kill the Prince of Orange</i>."</p>

  <p>"And whence comes this determination?" asked Alexander.</p>

  <p>"The reasons are set forth in my letter," answered Balthazar.</p>

  <p>Parma replied haughtily and briefly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I do not recall thy letter. Thy reasons?"</p>

  <p>The little clerk was not abashed.</p>

  <p>"Is it not enough," he asked with some dignity, "that I am a faithful
  Catholic and loyal subject of His Majesty and that this Prince is a wretch
  who has brought much evil on my religion and my King?"</p>

  <p>Alexander regarded him closely, and he was not prepossessed in Gerard's
  favour.</p>

  <p>"Dost thou not know," he asked with a cold smile, "that every day men come
  to me on this errand? Men of all nationalities and breeds? Art thou aware
  that I have listened to French, Scotch, English, Italian, Irish, Germans, all
  coming with tales like thine, all promising me to dispatch the Prince of
  Orange?"</p>

  <p>"I know," answered the little clerk quietly, "that many have come
  forward&mdash;but I am he who was ordained to do this deed."</p>

  <p>The two regarded each other for a moment in silence.</p>

  <p>Parma was still not greatly impressed by the shabby little stranger; he
  could not believe him capable of a deed of daring and of bloodshed.</p>

  <p>"Hast thou the courage for this enterprise?" he asked, without attempting
  to disguise his disdain.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Gerard, almost as if he answered a question of little
  importance.</p>

  <p>Parma glanced at Haultfenne, the councillor who stood beside him in the
  window space.</p>

  <p>"I think that this fellow does not know what he talks of," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"I should advise your grace to listen to him," returned the other. "It
  seems to me that he is very much in earnest."</p>

  <p>Parma lifted his brows and again fixed his hard cold glance on Gerard.</p>

  <p>"Disclose to me thy plan for approaching the person of the Prince of
  Orange," he demanded.</p>

  <p>Gerard, who had maintained the same attitude of complete composure,
  answered at once.</p>

  <p>"I have the idea of going to Delft and applying to some friend of the
  Prince, and representing myself as a heretic, a Calvinist ruined for his
  faith and wishing for some employment&mdash;I will show Mansfield's seals as
  a guarantee of my truth and I will complain of the cruelties I have
  undergone, saying that my father was executed for his religion. I shall gain
  the confidence of those about Nassau and sooner or later shall surely obtain
  access to his person."</p>

  <p>"And then?" asked Parma drily.</p>

  <p>"Then," answered Gerard quietly, "I shall kill him with any weapon I may
  have in my hand."</p>

  <p>Parma smiled</p>

  <p>"Does your Grace think I shall fail like Jauregay did?" he asked. "My hand
  will not tremble nor my wit fail."</p>

  <p>"And art thou not aware how slight are thy chances of escape and how
  horrid is the death these rebels will give thee?" asked Parma, not because he
  in the least cared what became of Gerard; he would have thought the death of
  the Prince of Orange cheap at the cost of the lives of a thousand
  such&mdash;he wished to test the nerve of the little clerk.</p>

  <p>"If I die, I die a martyr," quietly replied Gerard. "The holy fathers have
  assured me that. And I shall have rendered a great service to His Majesty,
  who I hope will not forget my poor family."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Parma, "if you do this thing you lose your life, and the
  reward shall be paid to your family, if you escape, to you."</p>

  <p>"Then I am indeed happy!" exclaimed Gerard with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"But I tell you this," added Alexander, "there are at present four men in
  Delft, all unknown to the other and of different nationalities, all seeking
  to encompass the death of the Nassau."</p>

  <p>"If they succeed I am relieved from my task," said Gerard, "but I do not
  think they will succeed, since I am the man ordained to do this thing."</p>

  <p>Parma again glanced at Haultfenne and very slightly lifted his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Go thy ways," he said, "only do not ask me for a white piece in advance,
  I have paid too many and to no purpose."</p>

  <p>Gerard was considerably disappointed at this statement; he saw the old
  lack of money which had meant such a long delay in the execution of his task
  again rising up to hamper and perhaps defeat him.</p>

  <p>Parma saw how his face fell and this completed his bad opinion of the man;
  he thought he was, after all, but after the money, like so many other of
  these adventurers who had come to him with the same scheme.</p>

  <p>Therefore he said brusquely:</p>

  <p>"I need to make economies, my friend. If thou art in earnest, thou wilt
  accomplish this design without my bounty."</p>

  <p>"This will I do," said Gerard, "and in a short while you shall hear from
  me."</p>

  <p>Parma waved his hand to D'Assonleville to take away the little clerk.</p>

  <p>Gerard followed the councilor out into the street. D'Assonleville turned
  to his companion with some curiosity.</p>

  <p>"And what will you do now, my son?" he asked kindly. "I shall go to
  Delft&mdash;the Governor has encouraged me, has he not?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly he has encouraged you, but remember you must not involve the
  Prince of Parma," said D'Assonleville, leading him by the arm, "you must not
  say, <i>even under torture</i>, that he encouraged you and thereby expose him
  to the vengeance of frantic rebels."</p>

  <p>"I shall not," replied Gerard, "<i>even under torture</i>."</p>

  <p>"God give you courage and fortitude," said the councillor. They had now
  reached the door of Gerard's lodging near the gate.</p>

  <p>The little clerk hesitated on the step.</p>

  <p>"If you could get His Highness to advance me fifty crowns," he began
  timidly, stroking his thin beard.</p>

  <p>But D'Assonleville was firm on that point.</p>

  <p>"It is useless. His Highness has paid too often for nothing."</p>

  <p>"But this time it will not be for nothing," replied Gerard. The councillor
  lifted his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"The Prince is a hard man. Especially in the matter of money. I have no
  hope at all," said D'Assonleville, to close the subject.</p>

  <p>Gerard sighed again.</p>

  <p>"Well," he answered, "I will pay my own expenses, and, as I told His
  Highness, you shall hear of me&mdash;and in a short while."</p>

  <p>"All the world will hear of you," returned the councillor warmly. "You
  will earn the gratitude of Spain and gain for yourself an immortal name.
  Haste to Delft," he concluded, "lest one get before thee in this glorious
  deed."</p>

  <p>"You shall hear of me," repeated Gerard with trembling lips, "you shall
  hear of me."</p>

  <p>He hastened upstairs to his attic room and pulled out the pitiful hoard
  that was his last resource.</p>

  <p>With the strictest economy and most painful self-denial it would be enough
  to take him to Delft.</p>

  <p>A sigh escaped him at the thought of Parma's parsimony; but, after all,
  what did this matter if he could achieve his grand, his supreme object?</p>

  <p>With a rush of enthusiasm he went on his knees and thanked God for the
  possession of the few coins that rendered the journey to Delft possible.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-8"
     id="ch3-8"></a>VIII. &mdash; LOUISE OF ORANGE</h2>

  <p class="first">Rene Le Meuny was present at the christening of the Prince's
  infant son in the church of which she was now the sole guardian, who was
  christened Frederick Henry after his two royal sponsors.</p>

  <p>The new Princess of Orange had seen Rénée in Delft and was not to be
  denied her acquaintanceship.</p>

  <p>Louise de Teligny was of a nature different from Charlotte de Bourbon,
  neither so shy nor so placid, and she had not listened to Rénée's desire for
  quiet retirement nor found it ridiculous that the wife of William of Orange
  should be friends with such as Rénée le Meuny.</p>

  <p>"I knew we should love each other when I saw you in the inn at Antwerp,"
  she had said and Rénée could not resist her; so after all these years she
  became intimate in the house opposite the old Kirk where she had gone to
  watch the light in the Prince's windows when she first came to Delft.</p>

  <p>William received her as an old friend; probably, thought Rénée, he
  recalled Heidelberg and Charlotte de Bourbon.</p>

  <p>Nothing seemed strange to her now, not even the sight of this foreigner as
  mistress of the Prince's house.</p>

  <p>Jealousy was dead in Rénée; Louise did not trouble her as Charlotte had
  troubled her; she felt a kindness that was almost maternal for the beautiful
  high-spirited young woman who had known suffering and poverty.</p>

  <p>The position of the Princess, as had been at first that of her
  predecessor, was sufficiently isolated and even lonely, and she chose to make
  a companion of Rénée, who submitted, though with a sense of irony, to this
  friendship which formed another link in the chain which bound her life to
  that of William of Orange.</p>

  <p>The spring of the birth of the Prince's third son was a time of anxiety
  and trial for the Netherlanders; the defection of the Prince of Chimay, and
  of William's brother-in-law, Count van der Berg, had involved the Provinces
  in the loss of several important cities, including Bruges, and Parma was
  known to be straining every nerve to crush the patriots.</p>

  <p>William was pushing negotiations with Anjou, who had retired to Cambrai,
  and endeavouring to persuade him to come to terms for the resumption of the
  government of the Netherlands; meanwhile preparations were being made for the
  formal installation of the Prince as Stadtholder of the Northern Provinces, a
  position he had finally accepted; whether or no he ever achieved his
  cherished ambition of uniting the entire seventeen provinces under one ruler,
  here at least he had established liberty and independence and the Reformed
  religion on a basis that the rudest shocks of tyranny were not likely to
  disturb.</p>

  <p>And despite the general perils, alarms and anxieties that beset the little
  Republic, from the Prince down to his humblest soldier there reigned in this
  spring of 1684 a feeling of hopefulness, of confidence, almost of
  joyousness.</p>

  <p>All seemed to feel that their most cruel trials were over, their bitterest
  suffering completed.</p>

  <p>And men even forgot the Ban.</p>

  <p>In May Rénée was walking with the Princess of Orange beside the quay.</p>

  <p>The lime trees were already far advanced in leaf and cast a shadow on the
  waters of the canal that sparkled with light.</p>

  <p>The Prince was absent and the Princess had begged Rénée's company.</p>

  <p>"I hope to be trusted and loved in this country where I have made my
  home," she had said simply, "but, at present, I am only a foreigner."</p>

  <p>"You have your son, madam," Rénée had answered, "all love you because of
  him."</p>

  <p>They walked now quietly side by side, Rénée in her severe grey gown, the
  beautiful hair, now threaded with grey, bound back beneath a linen cap, the
  still beautiful face framed by a stiff ruff of pleated lawn.</p>

  <p>The French Princess was simple also in her attire, but she always went
  more splendidly than her royal predecessor.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she said, "looking back over your life, does it not seem
  strange?"</p>

  <p>"Strange?" echoed Rénée. "Nay, madam, nothing seems strange to me
  now."</p>

  <p>"To me my life seems curious beyond any tale&mdash;to see this
  revolt&mdash;this new nation formed, to have watched His Highness as you have
  watched him engaged in this long struggle, to see him change as you must have
  seen him change. What things we live through," said the Princess; she was
  thinking of Saint Bartholomew when her young husband had been murdered so
  soon after the wedding, when she, but a child in years, had been turned from
  her home, an exile.</p>

  <p>"What things we forget," she added.</p>

  <p>"Nay," said Rénée, "what has once entered our hearts never leaves it,
  madam&mdash;but our hearts close sometimes and we lose the key&mdash;but
  forget, no, no."</p>

  <p>Louise looked curiously at this woman whom she had taken into her
  confidence, but of whom she knew so little, and she wondered what Rénée's
  memories were and what was the secret of her loneliness.</p>

  <p>"Here comes M. de Villars," said Rénée, "and he has a stranger with
  him."</p>

  <p>The Princess glanced along the quay and saw Mynheer de Villars, a pastor
  and confidential friend of the Prince, approaching, accompanied by a young
  man in a shabby suit.</p>

  <p>"A Frenchman?" said the Princess, "a refugee?"</p>

  <p>The couple approached and the clergyman dismissed the young man, who with
  a humble reverence turned away down a side street.</p>

  <p>Louise was sorry for him because he was so plain and humble looking, but
  she did not like his face, which appeared to her to be singularly
  unprepossessing.</p>

  <p>"Who is your friend?" she asked M. de Villars. "A poor refugee."</p>

  <p>"I thought so&mdash;your charity shelters a number of such!" smiled
  Louise.</p>

  <p>"His father was an executed Calvinist, he himself has long secretly
  professed the faith."</p>

  <p>"What does he want?"</p>

  <p>"Employment, Highness."</p>

  <p>"Have you spoken to the Prince?" asked Louise, her pity struggling with
  her repulsion.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and his Grace told me to send him to Biron, at Cambrai."</p>

  <p>"I am glad he is leaving Delft," said the Princess impulsively. "I think
  he has a villainous face."</p>

  <p>The pastor smiled indulgently.</p>

  <p>"Poor Gaion! He is an honest soul, madam, and most religious."</p>

  <p>The Princess was as quick to withdraw her opinion as she had been to voice
  it.</p>

  <p>"You must not listen to me, Mynheer de Villars&mdash;a woman's foolish
  judgment of a face!"</p>

  <p>The pastor was still eager to defend one whom he had taken under his
  protection.</p>

  <p>"Since he has been at Delft, madam, he has never missed a church service
  and I have not seen him without a Bible under his arm."</p>

  <p>"I withdraw," smiled Louise, "I withdraw, Mynheer."</p>

  <p>"Nay," returned the pastor, "I admit that your Highness is right inasmuch
  as the fellow has an insignificant aspect&mdash;a poor mien, but I have
  conversed with him, and observed him, and found him honest and sincere."</p>

  <p>"Then I am glad you have found him employment," said the Princess. "Was he
  not pleased to go to France?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, madam, he seemed strangely disappointed from the first, he expressed
  a most earnest desire to be near the Prince, for whom he has a great
  devotion."</p>

  <p>Rénée had listened with little interest to this conversation; the young
  man had not attracted her attention as he had attracted that of the
  Princess.</p>

  <p>She was wondering if the Prince would return that night to Delft, she was
  speculating on how went his affairs with the Duke of Anjou; her thoughts were
  never long from William and his business.</p>

  <p>M. de Villars dismissed, the two women turned to the Prince's house.</p>

  <p>There were one or two soldiers at the gate, for the rest the place was
  like the house of any burgher or merchant.</p>

  <p>Rénée would have gone home but the Princess pressed her to enter and the
  two went up to Louise's chamber where the infant Count Frederick Henry lay in
  his cradle and the Prince's sister, Catherine, sat at a frame,
  embroidering.</p>

  <p>Louise seated herself with a little sigh; she did not yet fit as perfectly
  into her place as had Charlotte de Bourbon; she was still a stranger among
  strangers.</p>

  <p>But when the step and voice of the Prince were heard below she rose at
  once alert and animated.</p>

  <p>Rénée remained listening to the chatter of the nurses and watching the
  calm countenance of the Prince's sister.</p>

  <p>She soon rose to take her leave; Wilhelmina had a maid now, but Rénée did
  not leave her long alone.</p>

  <p>As she descended the curved dark stairs the Prince came from the
  dining-room and, turning, stood across her path.</p>

  <p>He was then fifty-one years of age, still retained a look of youth and an
  expression of unconquerable energy; he still wore his broad-leaved hat and
  his doublet and travelling cloak of grey frieze.</p>

  <p>Rénée wondered if he thought of the Brussels days as he looked at her; she
  knew that she too had changed&mdash;she knew that if she meant anything to
  him, she must mean strange memories.</p>

  <p>"Your Grace is thoughtful," she said, for he continued to look at her
  without speaking.</p>

  <p>"I am wondering about this work of mine, these poor people," he answered
  simply. "Daily the difficulties increase&mdash;I know not how I do even what
  I do."</p>

  <p>He sighed, like a man over-fatigued.</p>

  <p>"I always think of you as one who knew Count Louis," he added
  irrelevantly. "I dreamt of him the other night. I take it as a good
  omen."</p>

  <p>He ascended the stairs and Rénée to allow him to pass stepped into a
  little archway that was sunk into the wall. With extraordinary vividness
  there came before her eyes the picture of her first meeting with him, when he
  had mounted the stairs of Leipsic Town Hall in all his magnificence...She
  seemed to see beside her the figure of Anne of Saxony...</p>

  <p>The Prince saluted her kindly and passed up the stairs. Rénée went her
  way.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-9"
     id="ch3-9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE PROGRESS OF THE LITTLE CLERK</h2>

  <p class="first">In the July of that year Francis Gaion, the young Calvinist
  who had claimed the protection of M. de Villars and of the Prince, returned
  to Delft, carrying important dispatches.</p>

  <p>On a Sunday morning he sat, dusty and shabby, in the hall of the Prince's
  house; William was still in bed and the dispatches had been taken up to his
  chamber.</p>

  <p>This was a moment of triumph for Balthazar Gerard, calling himself Francis
  Gaion, for not only had he returned to Delft, but he was actually in the
  house of the Prince; he could not doubt that his long patient waiting would
  be at length rewarded and that he would finally find himself in the presence
  of William of Nassau.</p>

  <p>He had been patient and humble, he had gone to France, though greatly
  against his wish, and he had waited till the chance had come for his return;
  his good conduct and his piety had earned him the confidence of Marshal
  Biron, and finally he had been chosen as the messenger to send to Delft.</p>

  <p>He was tired and ill-fed and poor; his services had been paid with a sum
  sufficient only for his bare living, but the calm and desperate character
  hidden under his miserable exterior never faltered in the fixed idea of the
  one terrible design.</p>

  <p>He felt content now, like a man who has reached his goal and needs but to
  put out his hand to take the prize which is the reward of his toils and
  labours.</p>

  <p>He was in Delft, he had the confidence of the rebels, it was but a
  question of patience.</p>

  <p>As he sat there, staring out at the sunshine and turning over in his mind
  under what excuse he might introduce himself into the presence of William, he
  was touched on the shoulder by the Prince's secretary and told that His
  Highness wished to see him immediately.</p>

  <p>Gerard rose; his countenance was so agitated that the secretary thought
  that he was overwhelmed at the honour suddenly vouchsafed him and encouraged
  him kindly.</p>

  <p>The messenger followed up the dark stairway to the private apartments of
  the Prince.</p>

  <p>He was ushered directly into William's bed-chamber; the secretary left him
  alone with the man whom he hated and by whose death he meant to satisfy his
  conscience, obtain worldly honours and heavenly glory.</p>

  <p>The Prince was in bed, unarmed.</p>

  <p>The Burgundian's emotion was so considerable that he could not speak; he
  stood within the door, a shambling meagre figure, staring at the man sitting
  up in bed.</p>

  <p>William, too, was troubled.</p>

  <p>For the dispatches of Biron contained the news of the death of the Duke of
  Anjou.</p>

  <p>The Valois had succumbed to a ghastly and rapid illness of the same nature
  as that which had proved mortal in his brother, King Charles, and William
  must now choose another figure-head for his scheme of consolidation of the
  Netherlands.</p>

  <p>The death of this worthless young man had upset schemes long pondered and
  deeply cherished. The loss of Anjou might mean the loss of the friendship of
  England and France.</p>

  <p>William lifted his eyes from the documents scattered over the bed coverlet
  and looked at the messenger.</p>

  <p>"You are one Gaion, who was recommended to me by M. de Villars?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I am he, Highness," said Gerard. "In the service of M. de Schoneval."</p>

  <p>But William did not notice the messenger's agitation, his thoughts were
  entirely absorbed by the news which he had just received.</p>

  <p>He saw in the persecuted Calvinist whom the pastor had recommended to him,
  a young man of an insignificant aspect and thought no more of him.</p>

  <p>"You were at Cambrai on the occasion of the death of the Duke?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, monseigneur."</p>

  <p>"Then you can give me more details than are contained in these
  dispatches."</p>

  <p>Gerard could hardly answer; his mind was concentrated on the one thing;
  that here was his enemy, the heretic rebel, the cause of so much woe to His
  Majesty and to the Holy Church, lying alone before him, unarmed and
  helpless.</p>

  <p>The great opportunity so long prayed for and toiled for had at last
  arrived; and had found him unprepared.</p>

  <p>For he was without weapons; had he possessed even a two-inch dagger he
  would have used it; he even thought of his bare hands, but one glance at the
  Prince showed him that William was by far the stronger man and could easily
  have defended himself.</p>

  <p>The Prince waited for a reply, he thought the fellow stupid or
  embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"What name did they give this illness of the Duke?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>"Poison, monseigneur," stammered Gerard. "Some said poison."</p>

  <p>"Was it so sudden?"</p>

  <p>"Very sudden, monseigneur. He was taken with great pains, so they
  said."</p>

  <p>William turned over the papers thoughtfully; he remembered Saint
  Bartholomew; he believed his wife would say the horrible deaths of the Valois
  Princes were well deserved.</p>

  <p>"And there is nothing known, nothing suspected?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," replied Gerard. "His Grace was not much lamented."</p>

  <p>"Why no," said William drily, "he had done little to be beloved."</p>

  <p>"And his death was a just punishment for his crimes," said Gerard, who had
  hated Anjou for allowing himself to be used by William against Philip.</p>

  <p>The Prince thought that the messenger, as a Calvinist, referred to Anjou's
  attempt on the liberties of the States.</p>

  <p>"Ah, my friend," he answered, "this young man was a Prince of France and
  as such useful to the poor provinces."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless he perished as a reward of his crimes," said Gerard
  stubbornly. "And so will perish all who follow his example."</p>

  <p>William noticed the curious emphasis of these words and smiled</p>

  <p>"You have but little charity, Francis Gaion."</p>

  <p>"Towards the enemies of the faith I have neither charity nor pity,
  monseigneur."</p>

  <p>The Prince sighed.</p>

  <p>"Intolerance is a hideous thing," he said, "but how uselessly do I make
  war on it! Ye who abhor the Romaniste must ye imitate them in that?"</p>

  <p>"Was John Calvin tolerant, monseigneur?" asked Gerard.</p>

  <p>"Had he been he would have been a greater man," replied the Prince. "I
  stand neither for John Calvin nor for any other teacher, but for liberty and
  enlightenment in all things. Know you any other particulars concerning the
  death of his Grace?"</p>

  <p>Gerard controlled himself to answer calmly.</p>

  <p>"It was all terror and confusion, monseigneur&mdash;some said the Duke had
  been poisoned."</p>

  <p>"But the motive, the murderer?" asked William, who was thinking of
  Spain.</p>

  <p>"They talked of a woman, monseigneur."</p>

  <p>"A woman!"</p>

  <p>"You are surprised, monseigneur?"</p>

  <p>"Surprised, no&mdash;but I had not thought of it," replied the Prince.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness thought of politics?"</p>

  <p>"I thought of Parma&mdash;or of Granvelle," said William. Gerard started;
  his limbs were so shaking with excitement that he had to lean against the
  bedpost to support himself.</p>

  <p>"Of Parma!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"Parma has his murderers," answered William, "and Granvelle his
  agents."</p>

  <p>Gerard controlled himself; he put his hand to his trembling mouth.</p>

  <p>"There was no talk of Parma," he said in a dull voice.</p>

  <p>"Nay, he may be clear of this&mdash;Spain could have bought Anjou, as all
  the world knows, but Parma is thrifty and might have found this the cheaper
  way."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Parma is thrifty," thought Gerard, "or I should not be standing here
  weaponless!"</p>

  <p>And he felt bitter against D'Assonleville who had refused to advance him
  the money with which he could have bought a dagger to carry always about his
  person.</p>

  <p>As it was this golden opportunity was lost&mdash;lost, and he could only
  stare at the Prince and bite his finger with vexation.</p>

  <p>"That is all," said William, dismissing him.</p>

  <p>"A passport&mdash;a passport," stammered Gerard, clutching at any excuse
  to return into the presence of the Prince.</p>

  <p>"A passport?" William looked up from the papers which he was
  re-reading.</p>

  <p>"I have to return to Cambrai, monseigneur. I am attached to the service of
  M. de Schoneval," returned Gerard.</p>

  <p>"I will see later about the passport&mdash;you will stay a few days in
  Delft?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, monseigneur," said Gerard, and in his heart he added, "I shall not
  leave Delft while you, monster, are alive."</p>

  <p>There was now nothing for him to do but to take his leave.</p>

  <p>He slowly descended the stairs and noticed the shallow arch near the
  vestibule.</p>

  <p>As well as he was able he observed the plan of the building, which was old
  and rambling, having in former times been the residence of the priors
  attached to the church opposite.</p>

  <p>He noticed that the dining-room was to the right of the vestibule, and
  that to reach the Prince's apartments above, the dark bend of stairs
  containing the arch had to be passed.</p>

  <p>He went to further inspect the building, but was interrupted by a young
  man of about eighteen, fair and martial in appearance, who entered suddenly
  from the courtyard.</p>

  <p>Gerard knew him for Count Maurice.</p>

  <p>He passed without a glance at the Burgundian, who bowed humbly.</p>

  <p>Slowly he crossed the courtyard and lingered about the house to observe
  the outside; in making the plan for his escape he would need to know the
  arrangements of the building.</p>

  <p>He had already marked that the left wall formed one side of a narrow lane
  which ran alongside the Prince's stables to the city ramparts.</p>

  <p>Now he was noticing with a keen eye where the sentry was posted, the
  position of the gate and the height of the walls.</p>

  <p>The people began to enter the church opposite for the morning service.</p>

  <p>Gerard approached the gate and watched them, an orderly procession
  crossing the little bridge over the canal passing under the shade of the
  limes and entering the wide porch of the church.</p>

  <p>The sentry, who had long been aware of the solitary little stranger
  hesitating round the courtyard, now came from his place and spoke to him.</p>

  <p>"Have you any further business with the Prince?" he asked pleasantly.</p>

  <p>Gerard glanced up at the good-natured Netherlander; he saw here an
  opportunity to further his supreme purpose, which now, as ever, halted for
  lack of means.</p>

  <p>"I am one of Sieur de Schoneval's gentlemen," he said, "and have come with
  a message from Cambrai, and truly I would join those pious people opposite,
  but in such attire how can I enter the church? I was ashamed to approach His
  Highness in these weeds!"</p>

  <p>And he pointed to his broken shoes, threadbare hose and shabby
  garment.</p>

  <p>"Is it lack of means hinders you, friend?" asked the sentry.</p>

  <p>"Even that," replied Gerard. "I am a poor Calvinist of Bescanon who lost
  all because of my faith."</p>

  <p>At this moment a young officer entered from the street and the sentry
  approached him, telling him of Gerard's plight.</p>

  <p>"And I think he lacks a good meal as much as a pair of shoes, Mynheer,"
  added the halberdier.</p>

  <p>"I will speak to the Prince," replied the officer, after a glance at
  Gerard. "It is the little clerk who was recommended by M. de Villars."</p>

  <p>"The same," said the soldier, "a poor little fellow, always starving."</p>

  <p>The officer went towards the house and the sentry returned to Gerard.</p>

  <p>"The captain is speaking to the Prince about your needs," he said.</p>

  <p>"The Prince!" Gerard lowered his eyes. "I am sorry to disturb His Highness
  for such as I."</p>

  <p>"His Highness never sends any one away," returned the soldier. "You should
  have told him your situation before."</p>

  <p>"I was ashamed," murmured Gerard.</p>

  <p>"Oh," said the halberdier, "as for that, His Highness has himself starved
  and gone in broken shoes."</p>

  <p>Gerard glancing sideways under his lids saw the officer returning and his
  heart gave a great leap; was he at last to obtain the money wherewith to
  carry out his purpose.</p>

  <p>The young captain approached him smiling.</p>

  <p>"His Highness at once sends you this for your immediate wants, and he says
  he will speak to M. de Villars about you and tell him to see that you are
  supplied for your return journey."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he put into Gerard's hand three gold pieces.</p>

  <p>At finding himself at last in possession of the means to accomplish his
  design such a deep exultation shook his soul, but the next instant the little
  clerk was humble and downcast and profuse in his gratitude.</p>

  <p>The people had all passed into the church now and the great doors were
  shut.</p>

  <p>Gerard hurried along the quayside with William's bounty clasped tightly in
  his hot hand.</p>

  <p>"I will repay your heirs out of King Philip's reward," he said, and
  laughed aloud, for the joke pleased him; he was indeed supremely happy.</p>

  <p>The money was sufficient to buy a weapon and to leave enough for his
  journey from Delft, if, indeed, it was God's will that he should escape.</p>

  <p>It would also procure him the pair of shoes and hose he must have to avoid
  comment on his return to the Prince's house.</p>

  <p>He now turned to the outskirts of the town towards the Rotterdam canal
  where no one who had noticed him that morning would be likely to see him Here
  he found a modest tavern of the sort usually favoured by him, and entering
  ordered a meagre meal, the cost of which was covered by the few pence of his
  own he had left. William's charity was left untouched for William's murder.
  Frugality was a choice and a habit with Gerard, he did not notice the
  scantiness of his meal; the three gold coins laid carefully in the rusty
  pouch from which he never took his hands afforded him such infinite
  satisfaction, that, rather than disturb them, he would have gone without food
  at all, though he had not eaten since yesterday.</p>

  <p>It gave him a pleasant sensation also to look round the tavern at these
  jolly fresh-faced heretics and rebels, so comfortable and secure in their
  eating and drinking and to think that he, the little insignificance they did
  not even notice, would shortly throw them into terror and confusion and
  despair.</p>

  <p>He exulted in the thought that he was alone against all these, that he
  alone in this city stood for the true faith and the true King, and his hatred
  of the man whom he had come to kill, and of the people by whom he was
  surrounded filled him with strength like wine.</p>

  <p>He had laid his plans of escape, but he knew that they were not likely to
  succeed; this, however, did not trouble him in the least, for Balthazar
  Gerard was absolutely without fear.</p>

  <p>When he had finished his meal he approached a soldier who was drinking
  beer by the door and asked him if he knew of a shop where he could buy a good
  pistol.</p>

  <p>"I know of many such," replied the soldier briskly, "but you must pay a
  high price these days."</p>

  <p>He glanced at Gerard and added, with the patronage of the soldier towards
  the civilian, "Do you know a good pistol, Mynheer?"</p>

  <p>Gerard was at once deprecating.</p>

  <p>"Nay, I cannot pretend to much knowledge of these things&mdash;but the
  truth is, I have a long journey to undertake to Cambrai. I have come unarmed
  and will not so return. The roads are dangerous for one alone."</p>

  <p>The Netherlander agreed.</p>

  <p>"As long as those dogs of Spaniards pollute the land." Gerard shivered
  with a sensation of rage; his light eyes flickered.</p>

  <p>"So if you know where I could get a weapon," he repeated meekly.</p>

  <p>"As for that, as I said, it is a question of price&mdash;if you like to
  pay&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I cannot afford much," said Gerard quickly. "And I need bullets, there is
  a kind of chopped slugs I have a fancy for."</p>

  <p>"Well," answered the soldier reflectively, "I have such a weapon myself I
  would sell you for a' reasonable sum."</p>

  <p>He went and fetched a pair of small pistols from a pile of his possessions
  he had heaped on the floor in the corner.</p>

  <p>Gerard looked at them keenly; they were in good condition, which was all
  that he required for his purpose. After a long chaffering over the price, he
  secured the weapons for a moderate sum, together with a supply of
  bullets.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3-10"
     id="ch3-10"></a>X. &mdash; MAURICE OF NASSAU</h2>

  <p class="first">The next day Balthazar Gerard employed in purchasing his
  shoes and hose and a pair of bladders which he meant to distend with air and
  fasten to his person when he should cross the city moat; for his desperate
  plan of escape was this: to run down the lane at the side of the Prince's
  house, scale the ramparts and drop into the moat; once he could pass the
  water unobserved he had every hope of gaining Parma's lines.</p>

  <p>But he remembered the fate of Jean Jauregay and knew that this might very
  likely be his&mdash;or a worse if he was captured alive by the infuriated
  Netherlanders, this thought did not, even now, on the eve of his attempt
  cause him to hesitate or even shudder; his courage was as complete as his
  resolution.</p>

  <p>When in Cambrai he had managed to purchase from one of the attendants of
  the Duke's physician a small quantity of a virulent poison which he had
  declared he wanted for a cat which annoyed him by continually penetrating
  into his chamber. With this he now thoroughly saturated three of the bullets
  he had purchased and then carefully loaded the weapon.</p>

  <p>After which he said his prayers, and imploring a blessing on his great
  enterprise.</p>

  <p>He prayed for his own soul (it was a matter of regret to him that he had
  not been able to confess and obtain absolution since he had left Cambrai,
  where he had secretly visited one of the Duke's priests), for the Duke of
  Parma and the King of Spain, for Cardinal Granvelle and the holy Spanish
  Inquisition.</p>

  <p>The next morning, after a night of sound sleep, he left his room, and,
  armed with his pistols, he started for the Prince's house.</p>

  <p>As he crossed the wide square he saw a woman and a child coming towards
  him.</p>

  <p>He had trained himself not to forget faces and he remembered that this was
  the lady whom he had seen walking with Louise de Teligny along the canal the
  day that M. de Villars had sent him to France in the suite of M. de
  Schoneval.</p>

  <p>It occurred to him that, as she was a friend of the Princess, she might be
  useful in obtaining an entrance for him into the Prince's house. Therefore he
  approached and saluted her.</p>

  <p>Rénée did not remember him, but seeing him so humble and inoffensive she
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am the poor Gaion, madam," said Gerard, "who was with M. de Villars one
  day when he met you walking with Her Highness."</p>

  <p>Rénée recalled him.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you have returned to Delft&mdash;for long?"</p>

  <p>"No, madam, I must return to France, even to-day&mdash;I go now to see if
  I may obtain a passport&mdash;you see I am armed for the journey," he added
  with a smile, for he had seen Rénée glance at the pistols.</p>

  <p>"The roads are dangerous?"</p>

  <p>"For a civilian travelling alone, yes."</p>

  <p>He walked beside Rénée across the square; she did not notice the
  repulsiveness in his appearance that had impressed the Princess; to her he
  was a poor little refugee, one of the drift and wreckage left from Spanish
  cruelty, and she was sorry for him.</p>

  <p>And the fierce and implacable spirit that was hidden in the miserable
  exterior of the man who walked beside her was hating her bitterly as a type
  of the rebel heretic to him utterly abominable.</p>

  <p>He hated her grave fair face, her plain attire, her precise white linen of
  cap and kerchief, he hated the serious blonde-haired child in the long grey
  kirtle and modest hood.</p>

  <p>"It is your daughter?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The child of a refugee like yourself," replied Rénée. "Her father went
  down at Mooker Heyde with Count Louis&mdash;how long ago it seems!"</p>

  <p>"Long enough for Count Louis to be forgotten," replied Gerard.</p>

  <p>"Nay, he will never be forgotten, while the House of Nassau is remembered,
  and that will be to the end of time," replied Rénée proudly.</p>

  <p>"The Prince at least will be remembered," said Gerard</p>

  <p>"Among the greatest of men."</p>

  <p>"And I," said Gerard quietly, "I also hope to make a name&mdash;even one
  that may be written alongside that of the Prince."</p>

  <p>Rénée glanced at him curiously; she had not credited him with being either
  crazy or ambitious.</p>

  <p>"Well, you are still young," she answered, humouring him.</p>

  <p>He lifted his shoulders and suddenly laughed.</p>

  <p>They were admitted without difficulty into the Prince's house.</p>

  <p>Rénée went upstairs to the apartments of the Princess to present to her
  some of her exquisite lace that she had just finished.</p>

  <p>Gerard loitered round the entrance-hall until one of the Prince's
  secretaries spoke to him, when he asked for a passport.</p>

  <p>He was told that one would be given him; that it was, in fact, ready and
  only required the Prince's signature.</p>

  <p>At this moment and before Gerard could well realize it, the Prince turned
  the corner of the stairs and crossed the vestibule to go to the
  dining-room.</p>

  <p>The Princess was beside him, leaning on his arm, her youth and vivacity
  contrasted with his dignity and stateliness.</p>

  <p>He pressed forward and Louise saw him and knew him instantly.</p>

  <p>Her former impression of him was revived so vividly that she could not
  forbear an exclamation.</p>

  <p>"What is that fellow doing here?"</p>

  <p>The Prince turned.</p>

  <p>"A passport," muttered Gerard.</p>

  <p>"See that the passport is made out," said William and went on.</p>

  <p>"It is a villainous face," murmured Louise.</p>

  <p>But the Prince reassured her, saying it was only the messenger from
  Cambrai come for his papers, and so they passed into the dining-room.</p>

  <p>The secretary asked Gerard to come into his chamber, but the Burgundian
  excused himself, saying he had a headache and desired the fresh air; indeed
  he looked so pale that his words were easily believed.</p>

  <p>"Besides," he added, "it is a fine sight to see the Prince and his family.
  I would like to behold them pass again. You do not know, monsieur, what it
  means to me to look upon William of Nassau."</p>

  <p>So he was allowed to remain in the courtyard, where for two hours he
  wandered up and down, none amongst those who came and went taking any notice
  of his insignificance.</p>

  <p>Rénée from an upper window, where she stayed with the Princess's women,
  observed him and was sorry for him, he looked so shrunken and puny and drew
  aside so humbly from every passer-by.</p>

  <p>Presently Gerard stepped out of the sunshine into the darkness of the
  vestibule.</p>

  <p>There was no one about, but he could hear sounds from the dining-room and
  the voice of the Prince, cheerful, animated.</p>

  <p>Gerard turned and stepped into the arch he had noticed on descending from
  the Prince's chamber two days before.</p>

  <p>Though the stairs were lighted by the large window half-way up, the
  vestibule was in darkness and the arch which concealed Gerard was in the
  complete shadow of the door.</p>

  <p>At the back of it a narrow entrance opened on to the lane which led to the
  ramparts; it was by this that Gerard intended to make his escape.</p>

  <p>The Prince appeared in the door leading from the dining-room; he was
  talking to the Burgomaster of Leewarden, his guest, and said something about
  the future of Friesland.</p>

  <p>"No future for you," whispered Gerard, "here ends the history of William
  of Orange."</p>

  <p>He fixed his eyes with an intensity of hatred on the noble figure of the
  Prince as he leisurely crossed the narrow vestibule, as if he wished to
  imprint on his memory the last look and gesture of his victim.</p>

  <p>William was smiling; he put his foot on the lower stair and turned his
  head to speak to the burgomaster.</p>

  <p>Gerard stepped from the arch; he was but two paces from William and he
  discharged the three poisoned balls full at the Prince's body.</p>

  <p>"Now the King's vengeance is complete!" cried Gerard, and dashed out of
  the door beside his hiding place.</p>

  <p>A little shriek rose from the women; William fell backwards into the arms
  of his master of the house.</p>

  <p>"God have mercy on my soul!" he exclaimed. "God have mercy on this poor
  people!"</p>

  <p>His hat fell off, revealing his face already distorted with the terrible
  expression of the final agony; he sank on to the stairs.</p>

  <p>"He is dying," said Count Maurice, and, lifting up his father in his
  strong, young arms, he conveyed him, with the assistance of the burgomaster
  and the master of the house back into the dining-room.</p>

  <p>They laid him on a couch; the meal from which he had just risen was still
  on the table; no one could believe what had happened; Louise fell on her
  knees and tried to loosen his ruff and doublet but her fingers laboured
  uselessly at the fastenings.</p>

  <p>"Do you commend your soul to Christ?" asked Catherine Swartzburg.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said William, and on the word the last breath passed his lips.</p>

  <p>"Dead," said Maurice, bending over him, "dead&mdash;oh, my father."</p>

  <p>The room was full of the frightened household; Rénée was in the crowd,
  catching the ghastly truth as it passed from one trembling lip to
  another.</p>

  <p>She saw the murderer dragged in through the side door from which he had
  made his escape covered with the filth into which he had fallen, bleeding
  from rough usage, but calm and triumphant.</p>

  <p>"I would come a thousand miles to do this deed again," he said.</p>

  <p>She was pushed along in the press, the little girl clinging to her hand.
  One word was on every one's tongue, it beat in her brain as the sound of the
  sea beats in the brain of the watcher at the window near by&mdash;this one
  word&mdash;"dead, dead, dead."</p>

  <p>It seemed to her that all life had ceased everywhere, and that these were
  but ghosts that ran and cried and commanded and lamented.</p>

  <p>Thrust against a corner of the dining-table she saw, through the moving
  press of figures, a glimpse of that still form on the couch, not the face,
  but the shapely body and one fine hand with the fingers curled inwards
  slackly. The burden of the murmur about her forced itself on her stunned
  consciousness.</p>

  <p>"Dead&mdash;dead," she said aloud.</p>

  <p>A young man passing turned at these words.</p>

  <p>"The Prince is dead," he answered, "but the Netherlands live."</p>

  <p>"How do they live&mdash;now?" cried Rénée.</p>

  <p>"In such as these," he pointed to the child, "and in me, Maurice of
  Nassau."</p>
