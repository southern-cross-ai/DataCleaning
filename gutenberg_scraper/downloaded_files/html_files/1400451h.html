<h3>A GREAT AMERICAN PHILOSOPHER SAYS OF THIS FAMOUS BOOK</h3>
<p>I would say to the reader, "Taste it, try it for yourself. Keep
it close at hand, read a page or two, a paragraph, opening at
random. Browse about in it; read it consecutively. Keep it on a
bedside table and read it to compose your mind at night and to
arouse it in the morning." For it is compact with the wisdom
gathered in years at observation of the author and others.</p>

<p>The reader finds in it suggestions of ways to estimate the
quality of his own thinking...There are at least a dozen
suggestions offered, any one of which will lead to improvements of
mental habits.</p>

<p>No one can read the book...and not realize that sluggishness,
parasitical dependence upon others, slackness of taste, and similar
defects of character cause more deficiencies of mind than do lacks
which are distinctly intellectual in origin. If there are those
fortunate enough not to need any of the author's counsels, I still
urge them to read the book if only to make the acquaintance of an
experienced and deeply wise personality.</p>

<p>&mdash;John Dewey</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-0" id="ch-0"></a>PREFACE</h2>
<p>What writer would dare to appropriate Voltaire's verse in <i>Le
Pauvre Diable</i>, and would dare to say of his reader:</p>

<p class="poem"><i>Il me choisit pour l'aider à penser?</i></p>

<p>Yet, it is a fact that millions of men and women are anxious to
take lessons in the Art of Thinking and that some other men and
women have to take the risk of seeming presumptuous in offering
those lessons.</p>

<p>Anybody who does it need not be a genius. Genius has never been
supposed to be a particularly good teacher of any art. It is better
that the teacher of the Art of Thinking should not be a person who
knows no difficulty in thinking, or produces such brilliant
thoughts that they will be disheartening to the tyro. A delicate
physician does not give the example of health&mdash;any woodsman
can do that&mdash;he only gives the example of a small capital of
health intelligently increased: yet, we know he can be more useful
from his comprehension of indifferent health and from his
appreciation of hygiene, and we often prefer him. The author of
this book is certainly not prepared to say that he has acted, or
even is now acting, up to his own principles; still he is not
bragging in saying that he has probably felt their value more than
many people nearer to genius than he is. Is not this enough? And is
not a keen desire to be of use a sufficient claim to give modest
advice?</p>

<p>The reader will soon find that this book, whatever its
shortcomings, has been written for him. Its effort at being lucid
and brief, its aversion to philosophical jargon, its antipathy for
a discouraging and generally useless bibliographical display, all
come from a wish to help instead of dazzle. Most books are composed
with the more or less avowed object of being works of art, that is
to say of being an end in themselves and ultimately rousing
admiration. Egotism, in writing of any art, especially of an Art of
Thinking, would be criminal, and it can be honestly said that it had
as little a share as possible in the preparation of this work.</p>

<p>It will be enough if the reader is conscious of sympathy to
which he has a right, and of a continuous striving to help him in
his effort to think his best and live his noblest.</p>

<h2>PART ONE. ON THINKING</h2>
<h3>Chapter One. On Thinking</h3>
<p>A familiar scene. Five o'clock late in October, sunset over the
reddening garden. You are standing near the doorsill, looking, and
not looking, thinking. Somebody steals by and you hear the words
whispered "a penny for your thoughts." What is your answer?</p>

<p>Later in the day you are deep, or seem to be deep, in a book.
But your face does not look as it usually does when you are happy
in your reading: your contracted brow reveals intense
concentration, too intense for mere reading. In fact, you are miles
away, and to the questions: "What are you thinking? What book is
that?" you answer very much as you did when caught in that reverie,
during the afternoon: "Oh! Thinking of nothing" or, "Thinking of
all sorts of things." Indeed, you were thinking of so many things
that it was as if you had been thinking of nothing. Once more you
were conscious of something experienced many times before: our mind
is not like a brilliantly lit and perfectly ordered room; it is
much more like an encumbered garret inhabited by moths born and
grown up in half lights: our thoughts; the moment we open the door
to see them better the drab little butterflies vanish.</p>

<p>The consciousness of this phenomenon is discouraging, of course.
This accounts for the fact that, when offered a penny for our
thoughts, we generally look, sot only puzzled, but embarrassed, and
anxious to be let alone not only by the questioner but by the
question as well. We are like the puppy who is willing to bark once
at his own image in the mirror and to snap eagerly behind it, but
who, after the second trial, looks away in disgust. Yet, with some
curiosity and some practice, it is not impossible to have, at
least, a peep at one's mind. It should not be attempted when we are
too abstracted, that is to say, when our consciousness is
completely off its guard, but when there are favorable occasions. When we
are reading the newspaper and the quickly changing subjects begin
to tire, without quite exhausting us; when the motion of the train
or of the car sets our thoughts to a certain rhythm which may soon
become abstraction or drowsiness, but still is only a slackening of
the mental processes; when the lecture we hear is neither good
enough to rivet our attention, or bad enough to irritate us; then,
and every time we are in a mental lull, is our chance to get a
glimpse of our mind as it really works and as it reveals our
innermost nature. By a sudden stiffening of our consciousness, a
quick face-about inwards, we can, as it were, solidify a section of
mental stream which, during three or four seconds, will lie ready
for our inspection. If one succeeds in doing it once, one will
certainly feel like doing it again, for no examination of
conscience is so strikingly illuminating as that one, and the more
frequent it will be, the easier, at least during certain periods,
it will also become.</p>

<p>Why not do it now? A penny for your thoughts! What are you
thinking of?...</p>

<p>You look up, surprised at what you regard as an exhibition of
very poor taste in a writer.</p>

<p><i>"Thinking? Why, I am thinking of your book. You may not be as
interested in writing, as I am in reading it. I love this
subject."</i></p>

<p>"Yes, I saw you were remarkably attentive; that's why I
interrupted you. Had you been wandering, it would have been
useless. So you love this subject?"</p>

<p><i>"I do indeed, and wish you would go on. Books should not
talk."</i></p>

<p>"When you say you love this subject, you mean it interests you,
it excites something in you; in short, it makes you think."</p>

<p><i>"Quite."</i></p>

<p>"Of course, these thoughts which occur to you as you read are
your own, they are no mere reflections of what I am saying, and
that is the chief reason for which you enjoy them as they rise from
behind my sentences. Is it not so?"</p>

<p><i>"Very likely, Sir. I begin to like this
conversation."</i></p>

<p>"Yes, it is about you; I knew you would like it. So, these
thoughts which are your own and not mine are exterior to this book.
Don't you think they could be called a sort of distraction?"</p>

<p><i>"It would be rather unfair, Sir. I assure you I am following
you closely; yet, I must admit that I am not trying to memorize
what you say: it would spoil all the pleasure I find in this. I am
even willing to admit that my pleasure is my own and therefore
might be called, as you say, a sort of distraction. In fact, I was
thinking..."</i></p>

<p>"Ah! here we are! You were thinking...?"</p>

<p><i>"Well, I was thinking of a farm, up in Maine, where there
used to be a garret like the one you spoke of. In summer, when we
were there, the smell of winter apples was still in it, and I loved
it. I would sit there for hours, as a boy, thinking. You see, after
all, I was thinking of thinking. As a matter of fact, often when I
see the picture which gives me the deepest impression of happy
thinking&mdash;the portrait of Erasmus writing&mdash;I think of the
old garret. I have no doubt that I thought of Erasmus, a few
minutes ago, for I was positively annoyed, for a moment, at the
recollection of a man who once stood before that picture and asked
me: who is this old fellow looking down his long nose? I hate a
fool. The memory of this one actually made me fidget in my chair,
and I had to make an effort to think of something else."</i></p>

<p>"You see that I was not far wrong; you have been thinking of a
number of things which were not in this book."</p>

<p><i>"Yes, but they came because of the book, and I should not be
surprised if I were to think of your book, remember whole passages
of it, I mean, tomorrow while doing important work at my
office."</i></p>

<p>"Thank you. Have you been thinking of that too?"</p>

<p><i>"Why, it would be difficult not to. What I shall be signing
tomorrow involves a sum I might take five years to make. However, I
am almost sure that everything will go well and I can buy poor Jim
the partnership he wants."</i></p>

<p>"In the meantime here's the penny I owe you. For I begin to know
your thoughts pretty well. Naturally they are, every one of them,
about you, and that is as it should be. There are, of course, in
your mind, thoughts hidden so deep that no amount of digging up
could reveal them, but there is no doubt that they would be even
nearer your ego than those you have discovered in the course of our
conversation. Sometimes, very unexpectedly, we become aware of the
tingling of our arteries in our heads, even of the fact that we are
alive; this consciousness is of no use whatever to us, unless it
somehow concurs in keeping us alive, but we are lavish when our
Self is at stake. Do not imagine that I am reproaching you."</p>

<p><i>"You would be ungrateful, for let me repeat that I have
seldom read anything so attentively as this book."</i></p>

<p>"Certainly. Yet, you must also admit that while were interested
in this book you were interested in something else. It is so with
everybody. Have you ever heard that Sir Walter Scott, when he had
found the nucleus of a new novel by which his imagination would
naturally be engrossed, would, however, read volume after volume
that had no reference to his subject, merely because reading
intensified the working of his brain? These books did for his power
of invention what the crowds in the city did for Dickens's. When
you say that you were reading this book attentively, you mean that
your intellect was expending some share of your
consciousness&mdash;let us say one fifth or, at best, one third of
it&mdash;on the book. But your intellect is only a sort of superior
clerk doing outside jobs for you. You, yourself, did not cease for
all that, doing the work of your Self, infinitely more important to
you than any theory. What is important to you is the garret in
which you used to muse away hours with the smell of apples floating
around you, the picture of Erasmus which you love, your undying
indignation at the man who did not appreciate that picture, your
son's future and an exceptional chance of improving it. All the
time you were imagining that the <i>Art of Thinking</i> was making
you think, you were thinking of Jim, Erasmus, the fool, the garret
and business, undoubtedly too, of dozens of other things we have
not been able to trace back to your consciousness. Those thoughts
which you are tempted to call distractions, are what your Self is
thinking, in <i>spite</i> of the book, and, to tell the truth, the
book is your distraction. Even writing can be the same
thing.&mdash;Shall I tell you what my Self thinks while the
superior clerk holds my pen? It thinks that I should do my work
with perfect happiness if, two hours ago, I had not seen a poor
stray cat wandering in the drizzle with two frightened kittens at
her side. I love cats as much as you hate fools."</p>

<p>Introspection, as it is called, looking inwards, while the mind
is active, will always disclose similar things. Psychologists speak
of the "mental stream." and this expression alone has meant an
immense progress in the domain of interior observation as compared
with the misleading division of the soul into separate faculties.
In reality, the flux in our brain carries along
images&mdash;remembered or modified&mdash;feelings, resolves, and
intellectual, or partly intellectual conclusions, in vague or
seething confusion. And this process never stops, not even in our
sleep, any more than a river ever stops in its course. The mental
stream is more like a mountain brook, constantly hindered in its
course, and whirling as often as it flows. When we look in we are
conscious of the perpetual motion, but, if we do more than merely
peep and at once look away, we promptly notice the circular
displacement and reappearance of whole psychological trains.</p>

<p>These trains are invariably produced by some image in whose wake
they follow. The gentleman with whom I just had such an
enlightening conversation had his mind full of a multitude of
images&mdash;inconsiderable reflections, as swift and also as
broken and impossible to arrest as the wavelets in a
stream&mdash;but he was conscious, or semiconscious of only a few.
What were they? A room in a country house, the picture of Erasmus
by Holbein, a fool, Jim. To change our simile&mdash;the more we
use, the nearer we shall be to the endless changing
reality&mdash;these representations were like the larger and
brighter fragments in a kaleidoscope. To these the mind of the
gentleman would every few minutes revert.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that these images acted upon him
as all images act upon us. We are attracted by some and repelled by
others. The old apple-room was altogether satisfactory; so would
Erasmus have been, had it not been for that silly man, and, in
time, even the silly man would have been tolerable because he
produced not only irritation but a pleasant sense of superiority.
As for Jim, it was delightful to see his not very good-looking face
transformed by joy as he heard his father begin: "Well, old man,
it's all right"; but it was the reverse to imagine him, a year from
now, taking the same 8:17 train to do the same inferior work.
Probably when the gentleman imagined he was smelling the
shrivelled-up apples, happy Jim was behind the door, but when the
fool's unforgettable six words were heard in that satisfied oily
voice, Pelham station and the silent slaves streaming in with poor
Jim were not far. I say probably, for who knows? Quite possibly,
relief from an unpleasant picture was sought in a pleasanter one.
The stream runs fast and so deep between its brambly sides that it
is impossible to see anything clearly in it.</p>

<p>All we can say is: 1. That most of our mental operations are
inseparable from images, or are produced by images. We do not
differ in this from the dear animals near us. (If anybody does not
realize that a dog's brain registers an encyclopedia of images,
sounds and odors as large as a dictionary and far better
remembered, the dog's behavior will be entirely unintelligible.) 2.
That those images closely correspond to wishes or repulsions, to
things we want or do not want, so that this wanting or not wanting
seems to be the ultimate motive power in our psychology, probably
in connection with elementary conditions in our being. 3. That
inevitably, people will reveal in their thoughts and speeches, in
their outlook on life and in their lives themselves, the quality of
the images filling their minds. Investigation and estimation of
these images, together with investigation and estimation of our
likes and dislikes, will tell us what we are worth morally more
accurately than even our actions, for they are the roots of action.
But to this we shall revert later.</p>

<p>Surely, you say, what you have described so far is not thought.
Our brain must be free sometimes from images, from likes or
dislikes, from wants and repulsions. There must be a superior kind
of mental operation, something immaterial resulting in
abstractions. How are mathematical and philosophical systems
evolved? What is logic?</p>

<p>Yes, there are languages abbreviating billions of experiences,
and there are formulas filling whole libraries. The one of our
savage ancestors, who, wrestling with onomatopoeia and almost in
despair at seeing a shade of meaning which he could not express,
for the first time invented the future tense by conglobing
"to-morrow," or "sun-rise," or "morning hunger" with a crude
verb-noun, was a genius; and intellectual work has produced
libraries which, in their turn, keep the noblest minds occupied;
and all this tends to abstraction. But the study of it belongs to
the Science of Thought, while we are here concerned only with the
Art of Thinking. Yet, it is useful, even for our purpose, to say a
word about this less practical aspect of the subject.</p>

<p>We have an idea that thought&mdash;as diamonds are
wrongly-supposed to do&mdash;can exist in a pure state, and is
elaborated without images. We feel sure that we are not
infrequently conscious of conclusions, practical or speculative
arrived at without the help of images.</p>

<p>Ah, What are they? But, first of all, are there any? How can we
be sure that there are any? Every time we really succeed in
watching our mental process we discover the presence of images. You
say "thoughts," "pure thought," and you are persuaded that you say
this without any accompanying image, but are you right or wrong?
While you say "thought," is it, or is it not possible that you see
a man's head, or his brow, or the inside of his head visualized,
not as a horrible brain jelly, but perhaps as a more or less
complicated wire frame destined to classify and keep in place the
results arrived at, or as an infinitely delicate clockwork?</p>

<p>The names of mental operations which are now abstract were not
so originally. To <i>see</i> and to <i>know</i> are the same word
in Greek; to <i>ponder</i>, which sounds so intellectual, obviously
means to <i>weigh</i>; to <i>think</i> is the ghostlike descendant
of a much rougher word meaning to <i>seem</i>; <i>logic</i> and
<i>speech</i> are the same word; so, in fine&mdash;as if to protest
against too much intellectual pride&mdash;are <i>idea</i> and
<i>image!</i></p>

<p>Images can be subconscious and harder to detect than people who
have not tried suppose. We can be conscious of one reel unrolling
itself&mdash;with many crazy interruptions&mdash;in our inward
cinema, and not be quite conscious of another fixed image, visible,
but not easily visible, through the film. Nothing is more frequent
than this superposition of two sets of images progressing with
variable speeds. They account for the unexpected. Conclusions at
which we arrive while apparently attentive to entirely different
matters. A gentleman whose mind is occupied, while reading, with
the tiny photographs his memory once took of a house up in Maine,
may suddenly hear an inward voice say clearly to him: "It is very
bad to read when you need not," and may shut up the book at once.
Why? The process of solidification mentioned above would disclose
under the Maine film the image of Dr. Wilmer, since the last visit
hardly absent one instant from the subconscious. There would be
three strata (perhaps more, of course) perceptible in the same
consciousness:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Book on the Art of Thinking<br>
<br>
<i>House in Maine</i><br>
<br>
<i>Oculist</i></p>

<p>Sometimes we are aware of a succession of images driving, in
fact, telescoping, one another toward a worded conclusion with
extraordinary rapidity. The same gentleman whom I am sorry to have
now made pathetic (but he will never go blind) may come to the
unexpected conclusion: "I will buy that house in New Jersey!"
Incredible! Not at all. The succession of telescoping images may be
seen perfectly clearly:</p>

<p>House in Maine + slow trains + two changes + cold winters +
Joneses near = not wanted.</p>

<p>House in Lakewood (recommended by agent) + good trains = near +
no mosquitoes = sleep. Sleep + nearness + pine trees + sandy soil =
attractive = smile = buy.</p>

<p>All these images may succeed one another with the rapidity of
lightning, and, as we generally think of rapidity as a quality of
thought, the concatenation will be called thought, but in reality
it will only be a sequence of images, as usual.</p>

<p>Pretty often, we are conscious of isolated words vaguely
obtruding while our mind is thus busy: they are like labels on the
silks in a lady's workbox. More exceptionally, we see or hear a
whole scroll of eight or ten words, as the gentleman did, and we
are tempted to imagine we think in words, which would be superior
to thinking in images. But we do not. The words and the scrolls are
there from the habit which most of us have of sometimes audibly
whispering: "plus seventy-five" while counting money, or "this must
not happen again" when admonishing ourselves. The inner words are
only an anticipation.</p>

<p>So, we are confronted with images, images, and more images.
Abstractions, being the product of images, inevitably recall them.
It is difficult to think of history without visualizing great men
or some great period, and I doubt if we can mention science without
remembering famous experiments. Few words, surely, are as spiritual
as the word Truth, but when we hear it mentioned, we associate it
either with some instance of devotion to truth, or with some
particular search which makes us realize the beauty of truth, and,
once more, definite contingencies reappear. Needless to point out
how closely associated with figures even geometry is. As for logic,
it means nothing if it is not pronouncing on congruousness or
incongruity. Why should it not be the congruousness or incongruity
of two images or clusters of images, accompanied by an abstract
statement? In fact, we are constantly conscious that it is so.</p>

<p>It will be urged: but is there not in our mind something which
is its very nature, and without which there would be no mind at
all?</p>

<p>I see. You have heard of the principles of pure reason. Well,
read the philosophers, and tell me if you are much excited, much
enlightened, or much impelled to thought by being told that when
you see a billiard ball send another rolling, your intellect
registers that nothing happens without a cause or without
sufficient reason. What Kant, or even a more practically inclined
metaphysician, like Sir William Hamilton, tells us about the nature
of the intellect may represent a powerful mental effort, but the
results are not commensurate with it. We can catch a glimpse of the
working of our mind, vague and not much more satisfactory than was
the X-ray screen twenty years ago, but its nature must remain a
mystery among many other mysteries. This idea, added to the fact
that we are dealing with a practical art, and not with philosophy
proper, should reconcile us to our ignorance.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-1-02" id="ch-1-02"></a>Chapter Two. How to Estimate
Thought</h3>
<p>The quality of a man's thinking may seem difficult to detect on
account of the various strata under which real thought generally is
hiding, but, if introspection is applied, all the apparent
difficulty vanishes. An experiment or two will make it clear that
the criteria of estimation of a man's thought are, first, the
images on which it exercises itself; second, the likes and dislikes
corresponding to these images, and lastly, the mental energy which
enables us to combine intellectual data with more or less
success.</p>

<p>It is evident that a person whose mind is filled with the images
of petty pleasure, comfort, good food, good clothes, dancing,
traveling, amusing company, in short, material well-being, is
farther away from what we call thought than the person whose
imagination will be engrossed by beautiful scenes&mdash;Italian
scenery, for instance&mdash;with noble fabrics, the quaintness or
the appeal of antiquity, churches, and museums full of the
realisation of beauty, and the recollections of great artistic
lives everywhere. The superiority of an artist to a society man or
woman who is nothing else is undisputed, and it comes from no other
cause than the superiority of one class of images to another.
Again, when the mind of a Ruskin or a William Morris is inhabited,
not solely by images of sensuous beauty, but by visions of a better
and happier mankind, we bow to nobler images than those which
delight the mere artist. It is not difficult to go up the scale of
moral values attached to magnetic images by visualizing in
succession those characteristic of the patriot, the social
reformer, the moral reformer, the saint or the great religious
interpreter. These images become more and more sublimized, but they
are as vivid to the mystic as to the artist. What visions pass
through our mind when it is at leisure, what scenes do we
spontaneously imagine? We should know, for the mere description of
introspection is inevitably followed by an experiment. So we can be
our own judges. The thought is rather formidable.</p>

<p>Of course, our likes and dislikes are of the same order with the
images corresponding to them, and it would be tedious to dwell at
any length on the subject. It is evident that any images of which
we have no particular right to be proud would, not be frequent in
our minds if they were met with the verdict: not wanted, not
liked.</p>

<p>On the other hand, attention should be drawn to the fact that
most people are more conscious of their dislikes than of their
sympathies, the latter are weak while hatreds are strong. It is one
of the humiliating features of human nature that we resent a few
little things which happen to irritate us more than we appreciate a
great deal for which we ought to be grateful. A traveler's point of
view can be modified quite unjustly because, during the last few
days of his visit, he has been unlucky enough to meet bores, fools,
or bullies. But sometimes he prefers meeting them because he enjoys
grievances, and irritation agrees with him. A critic who feels like
praising a book will gladly damn it if the last chapter antagonizes
some pet idea of his. High-minded men and women endowed with warm
natures are almost invariably optimistic, even when they realize
the rottenness of the world, but how few they are! It is striking
to reflect that Antoine, the Belgian faith-healer, made a European
reputation by preaching love of our enemies&mdash;a doctrine so
traditional (theoretically) for Christians. Thousands fortunately
took it as a novelty and were enthusiastic in consequence.</p>

<p>Another symptom or cause of the pessimistic tendency is the
presence in our consciousness of the depressing mental habits which
Freudians call <i>complexes</i>. We shall revert to them in the
second part of this book but we must note them here at once because
their effects cannot be overlooked in an estimation of the quality
of our thinking.</p>

<p>Introspection can be supplemented and controlled by two sources
of information which we can hardly hold in suspicion: our private
letters and above all our talk. Both are open to the full light of
wide-awake consciousness and need not be investigated through the
more psychological process. What are we hearing ourselves say? Are
we satisfied with merely speaking the exterior or interior cinema?
("This car is going too fast." ... "I wish we had a Studebaker."
... "I feel quite ready for tea.") In the same way, are not our
letters full of small talk and cheap details, different from the
cook's only by virtue of a little more grammar and spelling? Does
not our pleasure in criticizing rather than appreciating break out
in many sentences beginning "I hate," "I detest," "I despise," "how
I loathe"...and so forth? If so, we cannot help escaping the
self-pronounced verdict: ORDINARY.</p>

<p>The third element to be taken into consideration if we want our
inventory to be complete is mental resilience. Glibness,
confidence, a retentive memory enabling its possessor to air easily
acquired, sometimes shamelessly pirated, knowledge, can deceive
observation at first, but not for long. As a rule, we can tell
which of two men is the more energetic thinker as we can tell in a
natatorium who is the swiftest swimmer. As for our estimate of our
own mental elasticity, it is a matter of mere honesty requiring
only the simplest investigation. If our mind is little better than
the cinema mentioned above, we do not think any more than does a
mirror. If we are bored by any topic above those which give food to
our small dislikes or even smaller likes, we do not think. If, the
moment a book or a newspaper raises a question demanding some
supplementary information or reflection, we yawn, fidget, or
hurriedly do something else, we abhor thinking. If, when trying to
reflect, we at once feel a weariness, a drowsiness or a tendency to
repeat mere words, we do not know what thought is. If we do know
what it is, but, as Montaigne says, are too lazy to tackle a
problem with more than "a charge or two," we are feeble thinkers.
Then what are we really?</p>

<p>Copy-cats, humble slaves imitating their masters. When a
traveller visits the United States for the first time he cannot
help noticing a curious phenomenon. Americanization, the
transforming of foreign dissimilarity into American conformity, is
not done, as Americanizing centres imagine, by the substitution of
a new set of ideas for another The thing is done more simply. Long
before the new arrival begins to know the language which he calls
the American, and even before changing his name from Silvio into
Sullivan, he is trying to be as American as his simple resources
will let him. He shaves off his moustache and has his hair cut in
the most military style. He goes to games and quickly learns to
yell. Soon he begins to suppress the native vivacity on his face
and replaces it by good-natured slowness. Nine times out of ten you
will see him copy the hesitancy before speaking accompanied by a
mute motion of the lips which is frequent in Americans of his
class. He has no difficulty in adopting the salute with the hand
which possibly America has borrowed from his Roman ancestors. He
has been told, before leaving Naples, that a good American consists
largely of good clothes, and his first money goes to that. He has
no doubt that a country in which a boy of eighteen makes a hundred
and fifty lire a day cannot but be God's own country. The notion
gives him a horror for the smells of Italy. Shortly after this he
has the revelation of the abyss there is between "the girls" and
"le donne." By the time he can write home that he now speaks the
"American" he is ready to make the world safe, at any cost, for
democracy and the American woman, and he should be given his papers
without another weeks delay. The whole process has come from
outside and its chief element may have been the mute motion of the
lips which is a symptom of high receptivity.</p>

<p>What do most people do who are not poor emigrants but "people"?
Do they not consist of clothes, fashions, mannerisms, formulas
(listen to what you hear at the opera or at art exhibitions)? Are
not only their attitudes, but even their attitude before life,
copied from models approved for standardization? Are not their
lives all alike?</p>

<p>Most of this questioning is superfluous. We know that nineteen
people in twenty do not think but live like automata. I once
reproached Mr. Arnold Bennett for entitling one of his books <i>How
to Live on Twenty-four Hours a Day</i>. This title evidently
suggests a book for hectic people in quest of a method to compress
forty-eight hours into twenty-four. On the contrary, the book is
destined for idle people and intended to make them live twenty-four
hours a day. The real title ought to have been: "How to Live
Twenty-four Hours," or "an hour" or "ten minutes" a day. For most
people do not live even that long a day, and Mr. Bennett's book was
worth writing.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-1-03" id="ch-1-03"></a>Chapter Three. Real
Thinking</h3>
<p>Enter thinker. We have all seen him standing amidst the
surprised, incredulous and often silly group of non-thinkers.
Sometimes he is a very simple man, the roadside mechanic slowly
walking out of his garage. Round the car two or three men, hot with
ineffective guessing are still talking excitedly when the taciturn
man appears; for an hour they have talked, tried and failed. They
stop and not another word is heard. The intelligent eyes of the
artisan, helped by his seemingly infallible hands go over the
organs of the machine; meanwhile we know that his mind is going
over dozens of hypotheses which to us are only riddles. Soon the
trouble is found. Sometimes the man smiles. At what? At whom? I
often wonder. At any rate we have felt the presence of a brain.</p>

<p>A score of medical students are standing round a bed: three or
four of them have examined the patient and an interne is now doing
it, for the case is exceptionally interesting and may go on record.
Every now and then the young doctor says a few words which a score
of pencils note down. But a flutter passes over the little crowd.
The <i>patron</i>, Potain himself, is here. He has heard of this
case and wants to see for himself. In a few moments his magnificent
head bends toward the patient and a scene, unforgettable to those
who once witnessed it, begins. Not a word. The splendid
intelligence of the famous physician now abides in his ear. With
closed eyes and a marvelous receptivity over his face, Potain
listens. At intervals something like beatitude in his expression
shows that this examination goes well: every infinitesimal sound,
every absence of sound is interrogated: the students know that even
a crease in the pleura becomes visible to this prodigious man as he
listens. Half an hour passes without one of these young men getting
tired of this scene, however mute, and entirely given up to
thought. At last Potain reappears: the case is as clear as if all
the organs were on the dissecting table&mdash;as, alas! they will
be in a few days&mdash;and a few plain words describe it: through
the solid thorax an irresistible intellect has done its divining
work.</p>

<p>Do you know Cézanne's portrait by himself, a marvellous thing
produced with such simple means that the artist might have found
them on a desert island? If you have looked at it for only ten
seconds, you will never forget the eyes, clear, hard, harsh, cold
and sharp as steel. Artists often possess those eyes less made to
love reality, as people say, than to go straight to its essentials.
Degas had exactly that kind of eyes. Not very long ago, I saw those
eyes in the head of a smartly dressed, dark-looking young painter,
outside the "Ruche," in Vaugirard: he interested me and our glances
were like crossed swords, high above the sphere of mere politeness.
Those eyes see where others see not. What is the power of a
Napoleon, even of a Mussolini? Not mere "power," but magnetism, and
the magnetism is more intelligence than force. Such men <i>see</i>,
they see the necessities of an epoch, and woe to the people who
will not see them as they do. The contempt of the eagle for crawling
creatures will fall upon them.</p>

<p>I remember once taking Angellier[*], rather by surprise, to a
drawing-room which the Quality was filling with the soft hubbub of
elegant nothingness. He sat down and listened. Certainly he had a
head which even conventionality at its worst could not pass by, a
superb head so well poised on athletic shoulders that many people
imagined the man was tall, though he was not. But, above all, he
had a power of attention so visible in his deep sunken eyes that it
actually seemed to throw out a net on the exterior world. The
disproportion between what Angellier seemed to expect and what he
was treated to, that afternoon, could not be left unnoticed, yet in
a few minutes the conversation became more substantial, every word
of it addressed to this unknown man with the expectant face. Soon,
too, the reward came. Angellier was seized by his demon and gave us
of his best: a succession of illuminating statements which his
Shakespearean metaphors clothed in magical brilliance. A rare
spectacle. It recalled Angellier's own description of Robert Burns
in the Edinburgh drawing-rooms.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Auguste Angellier (1848-1912), professor of
English Literature in Lille and Paris, critic and poet. His two
volumes on Robert Burns and his sonnets <i>A l'Amie Perdue</i> are
his chief titles to fame. His personal influence was
extraordinary.]</p>

<p>All great men, you say, all more or less famous men! True, but
is there a single human being who does not know in his immediate
vicinity a man or woman gifted with a power of intellectual vision
so superior to the average as to be striking? Is there a village
where some tavern star does not play the part acted by Branwell
Brontë in Haworth? Is there a single family, or little social
circle, without its <i>tintinnajo</i>, the family oracle of whom it
is said, when difficult questions are at issue: Oh! <i>he</i> will
see the whole thing? Few conversations pass without our making the
mental note: I had not thought of that. It means that somebody,
perhaps accidentally, has been a thinker. Shortly after the Russian
Revolution, in 1917, half a dozen people in a Paris salon were
indulging in the then familiar pastime of comparing the Czar with
Louis the Sixteenth, the Czarina with Marie-Antoinette, Kerensky
with the Girondists, etc., so that the future of Russia could
easily be inferred from the history of the French Revolution.
Somebody said: "Oh! you think the crisis is over, don't you? But
what is that Council of Soldiers and Workmen which meets at the
Finland Station? Wait; you will see what comes out of that." A
brilliant intuition, which, in a few weeks, facts began to
corroborate.</p>

<p>Such experiences are familiar to all of us and often leave a
deep impression behind them. We love to see the thinker in action,
for his personality, joined to the unexpectedness of his
performances, acts upon us even more than the illumination he
provides. Nobody denies that thought, like oratory, gains by being
drunk at the spring. The Port-Royalists appreciated nothing in
Pascal so much as what they called his "eloquence": to them the
word did not mean, as it does to us, persuasive rhetoric, but a
capacity for the ready expression of thoughts difficult to clothe
in words. Probably their interest in the almost indecipherable
memoranda left by the philosopher lay in the hope that these scraps
of paper might revive the impression of his originality. Readers of
Boswell do not doubt that Johnson was an extraordinary
conversationalist, but how few students of English literature have
a clear notion that a decade or two of the eighteenth century would
never have been called the Age of Johnson had it been only for the
<i>Dictionary, Rasselas</i> or the <i>Lives of the Poets</i>?
Johnson's genius was in his talk and not in his books. As Léon
Daudet says it, à propos of Marcel Proust, we love a conversation
"full of flowers and stars," the stars being the rare thoughts and
the flowers their fascinating expression.</p>

<p>Yet, from time to time, we see a thinker's ideas progress
independently of him, either because the thinker was not eloquent,
or because his ideas were difficult to grasp, or because the man
himself remained nebulous to his contemporaries. This phenomenon
cannot but give us an exalted idea of the greatness of thought.
Measure Descartes, the refugee to Holland, or his disciple Spinoza,
the artisan, or that typical provincial professor, Kant, or Karl
Marx, by confronting their personalities with their influence. The
contrast between those humble lives and the mental effervescence
they have left behind them is startling. One flash through a human
brain, and, in spite of a total lack of worldly influence, in spite
of the recondite character of the doctrines, in spite of the
absence of literary talent, the whole intellectual trend of mankind
will be changed for several generations. Much more spectacular the
process is when the man's personality is as powerful as his
influence (Julius Ceasar, Napoleon), but it is not so
extraordinary. Thought can indeed be called divine, for it is
creative.</p>

<p>What is it that characterises the thinker? First of all, and
obviously, vision: the word underlies every line of the
descriptions above. The thinker is preeminently a man who sees
where others do not. The novelty of what he says, its character as
a sort of revelation, the charm that attaches to it all come from
the fact that he sees. He seems to be head and shoulders above the
crowd, or to be walking on the ridge-way while others trudge at the
bottom. Independence is the word which describes the moral aspect
of this capacity for vision. Nothing is more striking than the
absence of intellectual independence in most human beings: they
conform in opinion, as they do in manner, and are perfectly content
with repeating formulas. While they do so, the thinker calmly looks
round, giving full play to his mental freedom. He may agree with
the consensus known as public opinion, but it will not be because
it is universal opinion. Even the sacrosanct thing called common
sense is not enough to intimidate him into conformity. What could seem
nearer to insanity, in the sixteenth century, than a denial of the
fact&mdash;for it was a fact&mdash;that the sun revolves round the
earth? Galileo did not mind: his intellectual bravery should be
even more surprising to us than his physical courage. But, three
hundred years later, it was no less difficult for Henri Poincare to
assert that there was as much scientific truth in the old notion as
in Galileo's doctrine. Einstein's denial of the principle that two
parallels can never meet is another stupendous proof of
intellectual independence.</p>

<p>How many people, in August 1914, shook their heads at the
world's certainty that the war could not last more than three or
four months? Very few. Hundreds of people in Europe are trying to
protect pedestrians from motorists; only one, that I know of, ever
thought of the radical measure which alone would compel the
motorist to slacken his speed: take away his Klaxon from him.
Everybody laughs at the bombastic eloquence resounding in
Parliament-houses, and obviously destined for some far-away
constituency. There would be an easy method for greatly diminishing
this evil, which would be to compel orators to speak seated, but
who thinks of it? How many Americans realize that their country is
not a democracy but an oligarchy, and owes a good deal of its
stability to that fact? How many Frenchmen see&mdash;for it can be
seen&mdash;the contrast between their modern architecture and the
sublime or exquisite monuments scattered all over their soil?
Indeed the world lives on words which it goes on repeating till
some thinker, or repeated experience&mdash;<i>experientia magistra
stultorum</i>&mdash;makes a breach in the solid and stolid wall of
conformity.</p>

<p>People who think for themselves often appear haughty and
self-satisfied, because they can hardly be dissatisfied with
themselves, or irreverent, because they knock down idols and cannot
but enjoy the sport. Men of the intellectual type of Mr. Bernard
Shaw would evidently be sorry if all silly people suddenly became
as wise as themselves. Hating folly and playing with it rather
cruelly is a healthy exercise of the faculties: the Bible abounds
with instances. Thinkers are also apt to appear dictatorial, to
compel people to follow in their wake. The reason is because seeing
the truth&mdash;whose other name is salvation&mdash;and realizing
that other people will not see it, they treat them as grown-ups
must treat children. Once more Mussolini can be used as an instance
in point. But, in their innermost nature, thinkers are preeminently
teachers, and it is to the credit of most of them that they devote
their lives to preaching the truth they see. Some of them do so in
admirable speeches or books, others in the picturesque language of
the artist, but, whatever the vehicle, the devotion to truth
remains visible. Some literary men appear original because of the
bizarre character of their expression; but the least effort to boil
down their most arresting page to its salt of pure thought will
show that they have little to say: not being able to pose as
teachers, they must be content with imitating the acrobat who makes
a speech standing on his head while gesticulating with his legs.
Such men will find imitators but no followers, whereas the thinker,
whether he wishes it or not, is a leader.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-1-04" id="ch-1-04"></a>Chapter Four. Possibility of
an Art of Thinking</h3>
<p>What is our reaction in the presence of a thinker? The same that
we experience in the presence of beauty: we are surprised at first,
but immediately after, we admire. Only, with some people admiration
is accompanied by discouragement, with others it creates emulation.
Purely literary people who think too much of brilliance are early
dazzled by it into inertness. Average people react differently. The
more confident almost invariably think: "What a shame that I should
not talk like that! I might have. If only I had this man's chances,
his education, his experience of travel, his connection with people
accustomed to a higher kind of conversation, or only even to a
better vocabulary, I should not be the dumb, dull creature I must
appear to be." In their hearts, they think distinction is found,
not gained, and they blame destiny. Others suspect under it all a
recipe which they do not know but might learn. "Tell me how" they
seem to say, and entertain not a doubt that, if they were given the
formula, results would immediately follow. Apart from the stupid
listeners who regard a brilliant conversationalist much as a
miserly old French farmer regards a generous American, that is to
say, as a freak, people feel a kinship between themselves and the
more gifted specimens of mankind. The only difference they see
between the latter and themselves is accidental and likely to be
effaced in an instant: in other words, they believe in an Art of
Thinking.</p>

<p>Why do they? Simply because the most ordinary of us know moments
during which we glimpse the very states of mind which brilliant
conversation mirrors. Anybody familiar with country people, even of
the most uncultivated sort, realizes that they appreciate natural
beauty, a landscape, the last smile of autumn on a wood, a sunset,
the flash of a wild bird, quite as much as a professional artist or
versifier. All they lack is words or oftener confidence; many of
them are as loath to speak of their innermost loves as to change
their accent.</p>

<p>Humdrum people cease to be humdrum when they hear a fine speech
or read the kind of book likely to act on their dormant
possibilities. Perhaps one human being in a thousand is absolutely
impervious to the charm of music: the rest, no matter how crude,
cannot hear Taps or <i>le Chant du Départ</i>, or a good organ, or
a girl's song on a warm evening, without a beginning of
intoxication which differs only in degree from the mental condition
in which Shelley produced <i>The Skylark</i>. A tumult of seldom
experienced and consequently more valued intellectual impressions,
with the sensation of an unwonted warmth round the heart, are known
to all men and women. We all treasure the recollection of such
moments, and we never become quite so ossified by what is called
life and its hardening influence as not to wish for their
return.</p>

<p>Everybody too is conscious of spells during which his mind is at
its best, works swiftly and infallibly. Insomnia, before ending in
exhaustion, generally produces a lucidity which no amount of normal
meditation will replace, and the vigils of literary men testify to
the fact. Prolonged solitude accompanied by a little fasting acts
in the same way. This too is known to all literary people. Dickens
used to walk and walk through the streets of London in the small
hours of the night when he could meet only sleepy policemen or
stray cats. Most writers realize that their books are only written,
not lived, when they cannot separate themselves from their families
and seek the quiet of an old town or remote country inn where
nobody speaks to them. Let anybody try the experiment of crossing
the ocean on one of the quieter boats without making anybody's
acquaintance." He will find, after three or four days, that his
mind is not the same. The ten days', or even thirty days silent
retreats, in use in some religious orders, are the outcome of such
experiences.</p>

<p>Were it even without the comparatively frequent recurrence of
exalted moments breaking our routine, we could, all of us, be
conscious of what is going on in the thinker's mind by recalling
our childhood. All children under nine or ten years of age are
poets and philosophers. They pretend to live with the rest of us,
and the rest of us imagine that we influence them so that their
lives are only a reflection of our own. But, as a matter of fact,
they are as self-contained as cats and as continuously attentive to
the magical charm of what they see inwardly. Their mental wealth is
extraordinary; only the greatest artists or poets, whose
resemblance to children is a banal certainty, can give us some idea
of it A golden-haired little fellow playing with his blocks in the
garden may be conscious all the time of the sunset while pretending
not to look at it. "Come along!" the nurse said to Felicité de la
Mennais, eight years old, "you have looked long enough at those
waves and everybody is going away." The answer: "<i>Ils regardent
ce que je regarde, mais ils ne voient pas ce que je vois</i>,"[*]
was no brag, but merely a plea to stay on. Who can tell what the
four Brontë tots saw or did not see in the moors through which, day
after day, they rambled holding hands? Cannot you remember looking
for long spells at a mere patch of red on a sheet of paper or in
your little paint-box? Most intelligent children, as was the case
with Newman, have the philosopher's doubts about the existence of
the world. You see them looking curiously at a stone; you think
"children are so funny" and all the time they are wondering if the
stone may not be eternal, and what it is to be eternal. Have I not
heard a little girl of nine interrupt a conversation of professors
who were talking about nothing to ask the astounding question:
"Father, what is beauty? What makes it?"</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "They watch what I am watching, but they do
not see what I see."]</p>

<p>This superiority of intellect persists until the child's
imitativeness begins to work from the outside in. When Jack begins
to copy Daddy's way of shaking his head or shrugging his shoulders,
his poor little soul also begins to be satisfied with dismissing
questions. Pretty soon this magnificent tide of interest which
fills the child's soul will ebb away to leave it dry and arid.
There may be occasional returns of it. All school-boys, writing an
essay for their teacher, are visited by thoughts which they realize
would be what is called literature, but they do not dare to write
them down, and ill-treated inspiration, in its turn, does not dare
to return. It is to those moments that such of us whose vocation
turns out to be literary look back with despair, wondering what
brought a crop of platitudes where distinction used to spring
naturally. Only in a Blake or a Whitman is the passage from the
child to the artist imperceptible.</p>

<p>People forget their childhood, no doubt, and it is a loss which,
no matter how lightly they take it, is irreparable. But, for a long
time, they remember it, and, more or less consciously, they try to
relive it. It does not occur to one in a thousand, of course, that
he was more intelligent when he was eight than now when he is
fifty, but it is no less true that the relationship we feel between
ourselves and even the man who dazzles us is founded on
recollections of great hours or on recollections of childhood; "I
have deteriorated" we rightly think; or "I am a victim, I have had
no luck." Pretty often, too, we hear the inward admission
immediately followed by a more hopeful feeling: "I am in a rut, I
know, but if I would make the least effort, move only one line,
say: 'henceforth I will talk no more nonsense,' in an instant I
could be outside of the herd of the unthinking to become one of the
few leading it." A trifle, a mere nothing, the buzz of a fly or the
bang of a door may be enough to disturb this mood and bring back
commonplace thoughts in full force; but it is no less true that,
during a few moments, we have been separated from a higher mental
life only by a vision which we realized was within reach and by an
effort which did not seem to be an exertion.</p>

<p>All this amounts to saying that we have a natural belief in the
existence of an ART OF THINKING. Some men possess it, others not;
but those who do not possess it must blame themselves.</p>

<p>Is this a real intuition? Must we really believe that the
constant surging of thought and feeling in myriads of souls is as
much of a waste as the useless effort of the waves? Was Gray right
in thinking that:</p>

<p class="poem">Full many a gem of purest ray serene,<br>
The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear;<br>
Full many a flower is born to blush unseen<br>
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.</p>

<p>Who can doubt it? Was not Robert Burns separated from illiteracy
by the merest accident? Who does not see the element of luck in
Shakespeare's life? Does not the life of Rimbaud demonstrate that a
man can be two men? People who knew only M. Rimbaud, the East
African dealer, in his counting-house, must have been astounded
when told that this was Rimbaud, Rimbaud the genius, Rimbaud, who,
before he was nineteen, had written immortal poems, but who
despised literature ever after. What happened to Balzac? Here was a
man who, between his twentieth and his twenty-ninth year,
consistently wrote trash and, after that, produced nothing but
masterpieces. Is it not evident to even a casual student of his
development that the healthy working of his mind was hampered at
first by the imitation of English novelists who had little in
common with him, and only began to act freely when dealing with the
data in his own experience? How can the historian of art or
literature account for the marvelous growth of such epochs as the
age of Pericles or the thirteenth century without exceptionally
favorable circumstances preventing the waste of talent? Such
periods testify to the existence, not of superhuman capacities in a
few hundred individuals, but to that of a happy atmosphere helping
the growth of the many. Medieval anonymity is another evidence of
the diffusion of talent in those fortunate ages. Russians are
supposed to have rare facilities for the acquisition of languages.
Would it not be better to say that most nations look upon the
acquisition of languages with a dread paralyzing the individual's
possibilities? I have seen at least two French people born in
Russia, show the so-called Russian genius for languages, and an
Englishman who never manages to learn more than a hundred words of
Hindustani will not be surprised to see his children pick up three
or four Hindoo dialects in the bazaars of Rangoon. Produce certain
favorable conditions and you produce the Art of Thinking. The
question is, how to produce those conditions, but it is not, by any
means, a disheartening one.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-2" id="ch-2"></a>PART TWO. OBSTACLES TO
THOUGHT</h2>
<h4>Introductory Note</h4>
<p><i>It is obvious that the chief obstacle to thought is
stupidity, that is to say a congenital incapacity for thinking.
However, no abnormal condition will be dealt with in the following
pages. Most people who, in perfect good faith, tackle
psychoanalysis, in the hope of bettering themselves, are repulsed
by the fact that practically all Freudians seem interested only in
medical cases. The man who has no reason to doubt that he is
normal, but is conscious, like every one of us, of those obsessions
now currently called inferiority complexes and wants to get rid of
them, turns away in disgust from literature filled with hospital
experience. This book is intended for average minds equally remote
from genius which knows no obstacles, or from stupidity to which
everything is an obstacle. It presupposes average lives finding the
usual chances and encountering only the usual difficulties.</i></p>

<p><i>In the same way, no attention will be given to what is the
main cause of human errors, viz: passion. It seems at first sight
illogical to brush aside self-love, prejudice, and the innumerable
likes or dislikes which prevent us from seeing even facts as they
are, or inferring from them their natural conclusions. But the
subject of this book is the production, not the guidance of
thought, and its every chapter takes it for granted that we are
honest in our wish to produce unadulterated thought.</i></p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-2-05" id="ch-2-05"></a>Chapter Five. Obsessions on
Inferiority Complexes</h3>
<p>We all know them. We are all conscious of a double state of mind
in which, behind a fascinating object, we see a threatening or
discouraging phantasm doing its best to neutralize the healthy
influence we would love not to lose. For instance, we see somebody
we know engaged in a French conversation with a foreigner. How
exquisite is distinguished, well-modulated French! What fluidity
the loosening influence of the mute <i>e</i> and the nonchalance of the
<i>n</i> sounds give to that language. Why, that girl seems to speak like a
native. I had no idea she did. Not a trace of effort on her part,
and that Frenchman does not seem conscious of talking with a
foreigner. It is really wonderful. How absurd that I should have
given up French! I still read it without much difficulty when I
have to, but it is not often, and if I had to talk, I know I should
be ridiculous. I really must do something. This very evening I will
begin. Our French teacher used to say that if we would learn ten
words a day, which is nothing, we should know almost four thousand
words in a year, which sounds like a lot. Why should I not do it?
Of course I will. And in a year and a half, I shall go to Tours or
Grenoble to practise my four or five thousand words on harmonious
natives. That's really worth doing, instead of going to silly
plays.</p>

<p>Ten o'clock at night. Chardenal, the French Dictionary,
Mérimée's <i>Colomba</i>, and an austere-looking vocabulary once
bought in a hotel lobby are on the table. They do not look as
attractive as that conversation sounded. Chardenal does not look
attractive at all. Yet, the grammar must be swallowed, verbs and
all. Here are the four conjugations, not one less than last time
the book was opened, and as merciless as ever. (<i>Enter phantasms
as bad as phantoms</i>.) Of course, people with excellent memories
can learn those verbs, but my memory is not good. Ten words a day
is nothing, Mademoiselle used to say. Then, why is it that not a
single girl learned them then, or has learned them since? Everybody
imagined she would do it, but in fact nobody did. I have no
perseverance. I have not even perseverance enough to reduce. I am
not like So and So. No perseverance. So it is useless to try.
Besides, is it so necessary that I should know French? Everything
gets translated, and, when Sorel or Guitry come over, you can
always guess a little and pretend a little. As everybody does it,
and if I did know French nobody would believe that I did, it does
not matter. After all there are other useful things besides French.
That lecturer the other day pointed out quite correctly that we
talk about Shakespeare all the time but read him about as much as
the Bible. Let me read Shakespeare. One act every night should see
me through in five or six months. I'll finish this trashy, amusing
book I began last night, but immediately after I shall start on
<i>Titus Andronicus</i>.</p>

<p>Memory not good. No perseverance. What's the good? So and So can
do it. All these disheartening little visions are what Miss
Austen's characters used to call the "blues," not <i>idées
noires</i>, but <i>idées bleu foncé</i>, not exactly obsessions,
but parasitical obstructions. They all rush to the attack of a
nascent volition and try to crush it out. If it shows a little
fight in its desire to become a resolve, the hostile phantasms come
back seven times more numerous and charge again till they firmly
implant the inferiority complex: "I can't do it, it can't be
done."</p>

<p>If we will indulge in a little introspection we shall find that
our mind is peopled with more incipient obsessions than ideas, and
that their presence is largely the cause of our impotency.</p>

<p>Inferiority complexes are not always the result of the presence
of shadows like those I have just mentioned. It is sufficient that
some purpose or desire, foreign to the thought or possibility of
thought we are pursuing, should step in to arrest the process of
effective thinking. Many people act in daily life a character not
their own, and the working of their minds is hopelessly vitiated by
the constant effort. Quite a few Englishmen, having trimmed their
beards so as to look like Edward VII or George V, have never been
themselves afterwards. Their thoughts, words and actions have been
those of actors. I used to meet in Paris a man who looked
miraculously like Alfred de Musset. But he was not Alfred de
Musset, alas! and as he had persuaded himself he was no longer
Dupont or Durand, he was nothing at all. Politicians frequently act
historical characters and their natural insincerity becomes tenfold
in consequence. People who begin to possess a language well enough
to imagine that they may pass for natives, but have not really
mastered it enough to use it as their instrument, can be frequently
detected acting Italian exuberance, French vivacity, or British
stolidity. Few students who have completely annexed a foreign
language have escaped that rather ignominious phase; and they must
admit that, as long as it lasted, their thoughts were not quite
their own, but the reflection of some fancied Italian, French, or
English type. One cannot exaggerate the influence of the
English-American language in the Americanization of aliens.</p>

<p>Social intercourse with its requirements and its
indulgence,&mdash;its hypocrisy, to call it by its name,&mdash;is
highly productive of thought-hindering insincerity. How many people
dare to say they have not read the book which three or four other
people in a drawing room are discussing in non-committal language?
How many are brave enough not to join in with an "oh! yes, charming
book!" which does not deceive anybody, but which strengthens the
soul-devastating habit of saying something when one has nothing to
say. There is a quite as shameful <i>via media</i> between deceit
and sincerity which consists in buying the book even if it is never
to be opened. Casual inspection of some people's shelves is
illuminating. The leaves of a certain category of favourites are
uncut. I have no doubt that the success, not long ago, of one
philosophical best seller was of the uncut description.</p>

<p>The same comedy is acted especially by callow young people who
put on a profound air of having mastered it all They affect the
cant of sciences or arts about which they know nothing. What does
one hear at picture exhibitions? It takes even less knowledge to
display an after-the-concert appreciation summed up in "line, color
and sonority."</p>

<p>The desire to appear, instead of really being, can vitiate even
the legitimate operation of the intellect. Two men can be supposed,
for example, to apply their minds with equal intensity to the
question of the origins of the great war. If one of the two wants
to display in his mastery of this question either his patriotism or
his internationalism he will produce thought of a quality inferior
to the other mans, whose sole object is to discover facts. The
reason is that at every step onwards which he takes in his
investigation, the former student sees himself using the
information just gained, and the vision, like any parasitical
phantasm, weakens, because it divides, his thinking power. Again,
listen to a speech or read a poem with a view to remembering it:
you will remember it better, no doubt, but your impression of the
oratory or of the poetic charm will be diminished by such
extraneous preoccupation.</p>

<p>Two notions juxtaposed in the mind invariably hinder its
working. You do not see a picture as it really is when you have
been told it is a copy whereas it really is original. The moment you
hear that it is not a copy, the picture returns on you with an
energy it did not possess a few minutes before. The only comparison
that seems adequate is your surprise when you discover that what
you thought was only a flaw in the window-pane really is a large
kite in the sky: you actually see the tiny dot grow ten times as
large as it seemed before. Exactly the same phenomenon can take
place in our minds. We may have known a person, older than we are,
for many years without realizing, one may say without seeing, his
face: one day we suddenly see it and we are shocked to find it is
an old face.</p>

<p>We live on notions and with notions. I have seen an intelligent
and even, at tunes, scintillating man deteriorate long before his
time, because he used at first to save every brilliant thought
coming to him, for a better occasion, and gradually resent even
producing such thoughts, as the torpedo-fish may resent discharging
his electricity in the conviction that it must exhaust him. His
registering every intellectual operation he was conscious of
interfered with them all till, in time, he was a mere wreck.
Methodicalness pushed to an extreme is well known to produce
similar effects, because it becomes a haunting phantasm.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>It would seem as if writers who are professionally trained to
watch the operation of their minds, and in whose Mss. one is sure
to find rich material for the composition of an Art of Thinking,
ought to be freer than the rest of mankind from those blighting
shadows. But it is not so. Most writers endowed with the real
literary gift are nervous subjects, or at all events, exceptionally
sensitive individuals on whose imaginations all impressions work
freely and often cruelly. The Romanticists were proud of this
sensitiveness and tire us by too frequent allusions to it, but it
exists all the same, even in apparently robust intellects. In fact,
it is one of the literary professional characteristics and is
limited to the professional field. A number of literary people find
relaxation in drawing and do so without any consciousness of their
usual trammels. On the other hand, the careless and even reckless
freedom of many artists, when they happen to write, frequently
excites the envy of their purely literary brethren.</p>

<p>A writer is a man whose inner life is intended for public
inspection. Unless he feel powerful enough to take this ordeal as a
matter of course he is apt to think too continuously of this
inevitable exposition of himself, and the consciousness of it is a
weakening phantasm. Nobody knows so well as the writer that he
should not think of two things at a time, but nobody is more
inclined than he to do so. Even that perfect collector of mere
facts, that incarnation of unperturbed erudition, old Varro, has
noted it. He actually says, in pithy Latin, that the man who informs
himself in order to retail his information to others is a prey,
while so doing, to an inferiority complex.</p>

<p>The writer is constantly beset with phantasms. Taine was haunted
with a desire to hit upon an impossible world-mirroring formula,
until the study of history cured him of this yearning by
substituting such a simple summary of what history teaches us that,
at first, the author was ashamed of it. A kindred phantasm is the
fear of seeing only one aspect of the subject one is studying.
Carlyle admits that he knew this obsession and had to make a
desperate effort to overcome it. The writer is not afraid of mere
critics&mdash;they belong to his own craft and he is ready to fight
them with all professional weapons, including contempt&mdash;but he
dreads the smile of imaginary readers, men or women, whom he has
never met and who possibly do not exist, but whom he sees, in his
mind's eye, as the realisation of all he would wish to be,
mastering his subject as if they were giants. The obsession becomes
worse when the formidable reader is known to be in the flesh. Most
of Angellier's pupils have become writers: I have never known one
who did not shiver at the idea of his master's good-natured
criticisms, ruthless because they pointed out so infallibly the
incompleteness of the disciple's outlook. Yet, Angellier himself
was not always the olympian he seemed to be: the moment he thought
of his own works he frequently showed anxiety or even depression,
wondering at what height his inspiration really placed him,
wistfully mindful not only of the greatest and strongest, but even
of minors with a delicate handling of subtle nuances, dreading to
be inferior to what he had felt himself to be in his first great
effort, <i>l'Amie Perdue</i>, uncertain whether the subjects he was
attracted by were in his best vein, and, during many
years,&mdash;in fact, till he recovered some of his mother's
religious belief,&mdash;staking his hope of immortality on the
survival of some of his poems in the precarious memory of future
generations.</p>

<p>Nobody can tell how many sterling literary vocations have been
ruined by the notion that it is useless to repeat what must have
been said many times in the past. Men like Amiel, or, before him,
Joubert or Doudan, only escaped from this phantasm by writing
things which they imagined nobody else would ever read. On the few
occasions when they did write for the public, the cramping
influence became visible at once.</p>

<p>The list of such influences hindering a gifted man's thinking
could be endless. I cannot help adding that even a man as
deliberately free from any clogging accretions as Jules Lemaître
admits that the effort to visualise the past can become an
obsession: its victim walks through the delightful quaintness of
old Paris but docs not see it: where the bookbinders of to-day sip
their white wine of a warm afternoon, the obsession will show the
revolutionary workmen of <i>Les Dieux ont Soif</i>, and the two
visions neutralise each other. Many a Frenchman has never been able
to recapture his first delicious impression of Paris, after reading
the volumes of Marquis de Rochegude. Substitute Renan's or Signor
Ferrero's mental habit of seeing the past as if it were the
present, of speaking of the Roman <i>equites</i> in terms of Wall
Street, and everything will be clarified in an instant; but the
something which differentiated an <i>eques</i> from a banker, the
spell attached to the distant past, will vanish.</p>

<p>The act of writing itself is productive of phantasms and is
dangerous for the legitimate production of thought. Nobody ought to
write who does not write with pleasure. But a number of
professional writers are more conscious of an effort than of an
enjoyment. Yet, self-expression is a joy to everybody and is often
found to be a unique relief. The reason why it is not always so may
be an imperfect command of the language used, or lack of real
interest in the subject treated, or some one of the causes
enumerated in the foregoing pages. But it is chiefly a phantasm
acquired in school days, the habit of thinking of the blank sheets
lying under the one we are writing upon, hating their breadth and
length, and wondering how they can ever be all scribbled over.</p>

<p>Some people imagine they have to write a book as, at fifteen,
they had to write an essay, whether they liked it or not. All the
time they are at work on a chapter which ought to monopolise their
attention, they are anxious over future chapters still unborn and
even unconceived, and the anxiety throws its shadow over the page
just being written. As long as an author does not take the habit of
"only writing his book," as Joubert says, "when it is finished in
his mind," or cannot honestly say, like Racine: "My tragedy is
done, now I have only to write the verses," he will be a prey to
the schoolboy's error. Nothing is as exciting as the hunt after
thoughts or facts intended to elucidate a question we think vital
to us, and the enjoyment of writing when the hunt has been
successful is an unparalleled reward for intellectual honesty.
Leave only the slavish necessity or the meretricious desire for
producing a book and all the pleasure will be gone.</p>

<p>Some people who think freely and charmingly in speaking seem to
put their minds in a strait-jacket the moment they begin to write.
The wittiest man I have ever known, a French aristocrat, used to
produce drab letters over which he would plod for hours. A former
colleague of mine, with an entirely literary background, showed,
however, an interest in philosophy and, without having read any of
the philosophers, would discourse on the fundamental issues with
surprising originality. "The Robinson Crusoe of philosophy,"
another colleague used to call him. This genius, every time he was
compelled to write, relapsed into the state of mind in which he
used to be, years before, when going through examinations at the
Sorbonne. His own originality in thought or expression frightened
him, and the results of his efforts, or I should say probably
tortures, were cold, elaborate pages recalling dons' prefaces to
dictionaries.</p>

<p>Most writers are slaves to certain models of expression.
Millions of sentences might be curtailed of a final clause
beginning with <i>and</i> which may be unnecessary as it is so often a
mere repetition or summary added solely to round off the sentence.
The habit of using three verbs or three adjectives where only one
would suffice is almost as general. The average writer is not
guided but coerced by a cheap rhythm as inseparable from him as the
flute-player was from the orator of antiquity. A man's thought is
hampered by these miserable toils.</p>

<p>More artistic writers cannot get rid of the notion that the
language they use is fatally inferior to the classical style of
past generations and, consequently, what they produce is bound to
appear as a monument of decadence. They will not remember Goethe's
well-grounded remark that "the man who has been of his own time has
really been of all times." This thought would open the door of the
cage for them, but they go on knocking their heads against the
bars.</p>

<p>The writer the most cramped by adventitious preoccupations,
impairing even a beginning of sincerity, is the art critic. Compare
Reynolds' <i>Discourses</i>, or Ruskin's <i>Modern Painters</i>,
or, in French, the absolutely honest manual of de Piles with the
articles on art appearing in most newspapers. You will feel at once
that the so-called critics only pretend to know what they are
writing about, and write about this negative quantity in an
entirely artificial style. It is always a surprise to me to see a
forcible and direct writer of fiction use, in dealing with
pictures, a cliché style which, in another man, would disgust him
by its effete far-fetchedness. The cause is that the novelist
transmuted into an art critic is not himself any more but another
man, and the double consciousness is like a man's effort to see two
objects at the same time.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Our mind then, is like our eye; it must be single. Children,
plain people, saintly people, artists, all people possessed of a
mastering purpose leaving no room for inferior preoccupations,
reformers, apostles, leaders or aristocrats of all kinds, strike us
by the directness of their intellectual vision. On the contrary,
timid, weak, easily abashed people, people made to follow rather
than to guide, sensitive people anxious about the impression they
may produce, doubtful of the working of their own faculties and
everlastingly trying to get reassured, have a fatal capacity for
letting in extraneous thoughts or mental parasites, which at first
only obstruct but gradually obsess their own, hampering their
vision, and ultimately leaving upon them that chronic sense of
inadequacy which the term "inferiority complex" describes clearly,
at all events to the present generation. Had Freud and Adler done
nothing else but reveal the existence of such complexes and
popularize the belief that proper treatment can dissolve them,
their influence ought to be regarded as beneficial.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<h4>HOW MENTAL PARASITES ARE PRODUCED</h4>

<p><b>a) IMITATION AND GREGARIOUSNESS</b></p>

<p>I said in the first part of this book that all children enjoy a
few years of direct vision and immediate impressions with which the
most intense moments in their after-life remain connected. This
magical introduction to life can be compared to the charm of dawn
in the big city: during a brief spell everything seems as fresh as
if it had just sprung into existence, but the rumours and bustle of
the humdrum routine soon spoil even such a glorious background, and
banality sets in again.</p>

<p>Young children apprehend men and things without any
intermediary, and their first impression of them is so strong that
they need not go back to the original source of impression. Hence
the mistake many parents make in refusing to admit that childhood
is observant. Towards the tenth year things become different:
children grow cognizant of their elders and copy them. In a few
months, sometimes in a few weeks, you can notice the change: a
little man, a little woman, grown-up gestures, mannerisms in
pronunciation or phrasing, a faked interest in certain things or a
studied indifference to others appear; the expression of the face
may not be affected, but it ceases to be spontaneous. Boys are more
inclined to put on a rough, I-don't-care look,&mdash;sometimes
worse, if they happen to be in coarse surroundings; girls, on the
contrary, recall the thirteen-year-old brides whose mature
conversation and artificial letters the seventeenth century used to
take for granted. In many cases the observer fails to notice any
conscious effort on the part of these aspiring grown-ups, but he
cannot help being aware of a marked decrease in spontaneity and
charm. The ideas expressed, the attitude before life, sometimes
even before grief, are uninteresting or unpleasant. Soul resilience
is inferior to what it used, to be. You will see boys of twelve or
thirteen take stolidly their first experience of the ocean, of the
Canadian forests or of Rome or Egypt. Altogether these young beings
who, up to a quite recent day, had been like just-born clouds in
the summer sky, feeling every breeze and catching every reflection,
now are all passivity. As the years glide on, if no noble passion
helps them to climb up to the hill brow again, they will look more
and more like the multitude, lazily borrowing their thoughts,
attitudes or language from the millions.</p>

<p>What is to be done? It is the whole problem, for what can save a
child from conformity would also empower any one of us to produce
thoughts of his own. Children have to be educated, but they have
also to be left to educate themselves. In America it is in vain
that parents are naturally inclined, and schools are more and more
advised to allow children all the mental freedom they can use;
conformity is too strongly established and it takes genius to
escape from it. In France, and practically in all the old
countries, imitation and a certain amount of insincerity are
recommended. "Look at your father&mdash;do like father&mdash;think
of others and not of yourself&mdash;let them talk; they will love
you if you do&mdash;do not always say all you think; you will give
offence and people will not like you." There is no doubt that the
model proposed for imitation is not Alceste but Philinte. And
certainly Philinte is no fool; there is, well hidden in him, a
strain of irony which belongs only to a correct appreciation of
mankind, but who can deny that Alceste sees realities of a higher
kind?</p>

<p>It is needless to say that, given what the world is, most
children are more unfortunate than lucky in their surroundings.
When they are poor, and feel badly dressed, badly brought up, and
generally inferior, no matter how distinguished their intellects
may be, they will be apt to be browbeaten into conformity. When
they have stupid parents their questions, if they reveal any
originality, will be misunderstood and laughed at. It is not
unheard-of either that religion, the mainspring of man's rising
above himself, is used by children's elders as a method for
crushing them into conformity. Should they glimpse the fact that
Christ and the saints did not conform, they will pretty soon be
made to realize that Christ and the saints are in a world apart,
and good little children ought to be satisfied with doing what they
are told to do. So the combination of the natural instincts of man
for imitation with the antipathy of the multitude against
distinction, almost inevitably grinds thought out to leave only the
human gramophone.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Gregariousness is an instinct nearly akin to imitativeness and
tending to develop it. Nowhere is it so apparent as in the United
States. It may be that the early pioneers brought with them the
aptitude for cooperation natural to the Anglo-Saxon race, but could
not, for a long time, use it because of the comparative solitude in
which they had to live; the consequence was that they were
predisposed to give it full play as soon as they had a chance. At
all events, their descendants are the most social people on the
planet. French people in towns as well as in villages, meet on
Sundays, <i>à la sortie de la grand'messe</i>,&mdash;a distinctly
social expression-but after devoting ten minutes to questions
complementary of the all-round scrutiny during the sermon, they
retire to their <i>quant à soi</i>. Americans never have enough of
one another. The Club is insufficient and has to be supplemented by
midday luncheons, meetings or gatherings of all kinds, changes of
officers or initiations, a reception to this or a memorial ceremony
to that, stag or hen parties, to say nothing of concerts or the
theatre which are only pretences; and, when nothing better offers,
your social American will make the most of a hotel lobby or of the
"smoker" which I should be ungrateful to mock, for I owe partly to
it my knowledge of the American man's few faults and numerous
qualities. The word "joiner," which in England only designates a
carpenter, means in America something purely American, as the sound
of it,&mdash;as affectionate as sarcastic,&mdash;intimates.</p>

<p>It is well known that democracies produce uniformity. So do
social miniature democracies. Too much individuality there would
amount to not playing the game. When people form an association to
protect common interests or foster common tastes, they must be
expected to develop and encourage similarities. Attitudes are
created, standpoints are emphasized, slogans are circulated which
place a uniform imprint on people otherwise different Dissenting
where there is so much that can be promoted only by union, would be
worse than heretical and is practically impossible. Mental
resistance is hardly less so. The waves which sweep over
communities in times of great excitement or great calamities blind
and bewilder all ex-the most powerful. But the unseen continuous
influence of the collective consciousness produces the same
results. I have been amused several times in the United States to
find transplanted countrymen of mine showing the same prejudice
against negroes which prevails around them, but of which they had
no idea before emigrating. Here is no attitudinizing;
gregariousness in all its degrees makes individual thinking, viz.,
the only real thinking, an insuperable difficulty.</p>

<p>Examples in point could be adduced by the hundred. There is no
more striking evidence of the power of gregariousness than our
attention to the divisions of time. The almanac and the clock reign
supreme, and if they should disappear, civilization as we know it
would collapse. But, while we are enabled by them to catch the
train and to cash coupons, we are also their victims. Not only do
the active little seconds, in Maupassant's phrase, nibble away our
lives, but, every year, another birthday falls on us like a rock,
while the idea of age, as opposed to youth, is a gigantic phantasm.
Oscar Wilde says that the tragedy of old people is that they feel
young; that is to say, they really feel as young people would if
some wizardry made them imagine that they were old. There is no
evil spell here, but only clocks, calendars, and A.D.'S on every
human document we touch. If these could be removed, things would
change at once. Think of the delightful smile of the old Maryland
negress whom you foolishly ask about her age. She has no age. But
it costs a white man an effort amounting to genius to think away
the fallacy of anniversaries.</p>

<p>Fallacies are every day produced by ignorance or imperfect
knowledge, and are instantly circulated by the press. Their
presence is a positive static. It makes thinking an impossibility
until facts demonstrate that the apparently satisfactory notion was
the result of inadequate information. People say that wars are
inevitable till a League of Nations is founded; then they say that
peace can no longer be disturbed-until the failure of a Disarmament
Conference causes them to adopt another formula. A terse sentence
is enthusiastically repeated by people eager for some
classification of the facts they witness. In a few days this
sentence may be transformed by the press into a slogan with a whole
train of practical consequences behind it,-who can tell how many
divorces have been brought about by the "pursuit of happiness"
being mentioned as an elemental right in every American child's
text-book of the national history?</p>

<p><b>b) EDUCATION</b></p>

<p>Is it not paradoxical, to the extent of being in bad taste, to
speak of education as an obstacle and not as a help to thought? Is
it not a fact that we can tell an educated man from another, not
merely by his manners and language, nor even by his information,
but chiefly by his capacity for resisting another man's thought and
defending his own views? Is it not true that we are never
surprised, when we meet a brilliant young man, to hear that he
received his education at one of the great English public schools,
in a Paris <i>lycée</i>, or at a famous German or Polish gymnasium?
Practically all philosophers, from Plato to Herbert Spencer,
include an Art of Thinking as well as a treatise on education in
their philosophies, thereby implying that the two things hang
together. Horace Mann and Channing have produced in the United
States a vast progeny of men convinced that they can only raise the
democracy of their country up to real consciousness by education.
The more a man thinks the better adapted he becomes to thinking,
and education is nothing if it is not the methodical creation of
the habit of thinking.</p>

<p>Precisely. Theoretically, education is a mental training aiming
at greater intellectual elasticity, but the question is whether
education does not often strain, instead of train, a mind. Are
people generally satisfied with the education they have themselves
received or see dispensed to their children? Are they not
complaining about it all the time? It is remarkable that Rabelais,
Montaigne, Locke, Fenelon, Rousseau, as well as most of the
numerous educators who appeared during the nineteenth century, are
<i>against</i> teachers. It may be because most of these theorists
never had any experience of that wild unbroken thing, a class, and
imagine that what they now are they already were at twelve or
fourteen. But it is chiefly because their superiority of intellect
traces the shortcomings they are conscious of to bad methods of
which they were the victims in childhood. Teachers who&mdash;quite
rightly&mdash;pooh-pooh reformers possessed of the foolish notion
that a class is something else than an undisciplined young colt,
agree, nevertheless, that current methods of teaching are not good.
Their controversies, the tests and statistics they use to prove
their points fill libraries. This being the fact, it is difficult
to resist the conclusion that education is not the Art of Thinking
it ought to be.</p>

<p>However, our point is that it can be worse than this. At an age
when impressions are as deep as they are insidious, uneducating
education can produce mental parasites which, in time, are apt to
result in inferiority complexes, or&mdash;a worse evil&mdash;can
distort our whole outlook on life. In every country education has
its faults which it would take libraries to discuss. We must limit
ourselves. But it will not take long to show that education in the
United States is too resolutely practical and leaves in the pupil's
mind the phantasm that culture is the privilege or the amusement of
a few; whereas education in France is precisely the reverse and
places culture at such a height above action that the mere
pleasures of the intellect seem immeasurably more important than
the practical duties of life. In both cases the capacity for right
thinking is impaired and a lifetime may be necessary to correct the
initial mistake.</p>

<p>Education in America is still largely an education for pioneers
or the sons of pioneers. This affirmation may surprise people
living in the giant American cities, yet, even there, traces can
still be found of pioneers' ways or pioneers' ideas. The haphazard
method of indicating the names of the streets or the numbers of the
houses, sometimes on a bit of plank rescued from some wreckage, is
an obvious survival. So are the solitary letter-boxes on the ends
of sticks in the most civilized parts of ultra-civilized Long
Island. And I have no doubt that the notion so prevalent in the
United States, and so fruitful of consequences, that women are
scarce, is a relic of the days when women were really scarce and
the emigrant who secured a wife crowed like a Roman youth bringing
home a Sabine girl.</p>

<p>The American schools are mostly in the country, because
primitive American life was a country life and the Pilgrims had
seen the schools at home located in small towns or in open suburban
quarters like Westminster. And they are schools preeminently
intended to develop physical strength and its spiritual
counterpart, will-power. Where the ancestors used to fell trees in
the vicinity of dangerous Indians, and with an eye on the
ever-ready fowling-piece, the boys of Groton, St. Mark's or St.
Paul now develop superb bodies, a capacity for fending for
themselves, a passion for camp-life and an independent spirit to
which the instinct for cooperation adds rather than detracts.
Sports are still, and often avowedly so, the essential part of the
school life. I have not forgotten that, on my first introduction to
one of the above establishments, I was taken almost at once to the
cupboard in which glorious baseballs rest on silver rings, and
respectfully made my ignorant salaam to these fetishes. School news
in America is sport news. Notre Dame is a Catholic college,
certainly, but it is that much less than it is a stronghold of
football.</p>

<p>To be sure, athleticism is partly an art. Women frequently
enhance it by elegance and, when they do so, should they be as
ignorant as Saxon princesses of the seventh century, they achieve
an artistic result. But athleticism is not culture, and the
complaints continually heard in America about education arise from
the impossibility of reconciling too much athleticism with culture.
People often ask me: "Why do your young men seem to know so much
more than ours, and use it so much more effectively in their
conversation?" I am always surprised to see them stare when I
reply: "Because school life in France means getting up at five
o'clock and studying till eight at night with only two hours
recreation in between; because <i>travailler</i> in French means to
study, where as 'to work' in English applies to 'work' on the
football field or on the river. Our boys have mature brows but
narrow chests; yours have broad shoulders but childish
expressions."&mdash;"Is there no golden mean?"&mdash;"Yes, you will
find it, and plenty of it, at Smith, Vassar, or Bryn Mawr, or in
that perfect Thélème, the Princeton graduate school." "Ah! you do
me good. Your boys are narrow-chested, eh?"&mdash;"Yes, till they
have served a year or two in a regiment; we love to see them there,
not merely because they are keeping up the national militarism and
bloodthirstiness, but because the army gives them a chance of
broadening their shoulders."</p>

<p>The predominance of sports in schools, in the national life, in
the press, not only crowds out what is or should be more important,
but it creates an atmosphere in which these important things are
made to appear superfluous, or are even described in extremely
disrespectful slang. What does seem important is a bustling,
hustling life, with the excitement of getting in or out of a
scrimmage, beating somebody or something, getting there. All of
which is, within its limits, an excellent way of looking at life,
but is not culture. Angellier once asked a student which tragedies
he preferred, Racine's or Victor Hugo's. "Hugo's," was the reply,
"there is more life in them."&mdash;"More tussle," Angellier mused,
half to himself. Thoughtfulness, which is the highest form of life,
is reconcilable with tussle only in a deep biological sense which
is too subtle for this practical book to enter into. The plain fact
is that the boy who shows the greatest activity or initiative on
the game field is not by any means always the one who asks the most
intelligent questions. Frequently he asks no questions at all, and
his attitude is the "Tell us" which Madame de Maintenon used to
hold up to contempt to the Saint-Cyr girls and which some American
college professors have told me is likely to be retranslated in
American college English into the blunt: "It's <i>your</i> job to
tell us." A school is a place through which you have to pass before
entering life, but where the teaching proper does not prepare you
for life. What is called culture is in danger of being regarded, in
such an environment, as a specialty and not as an indispensable
requisite. Scholarship might be calculus. This accounts for the
fact that the American public at large, which cannot bear the idea
of foreign superiority in anything else, does not care a fig if it
is beaten in the field of thought or of the arts. Who worries if
one's neighbor is better than one's self at weighing the planets?
To what extent this indifference is carried can be measured from
the fact that an American newspaper never tells its readers whether
the speech it reports was a good speech or not. Oratory is a
specialty; only facts interest the millions. Yet, Americans love
eloquence.</p>

<p>I have often amused myself by imagining Cicero suddenly
appearing in America and being interviewed at the Hotel Biltmore by
two newspaper men, one French or British, full of school
reminiscences and beyond himself with excitement at the thought of
seeing the ORATOR; the other, an American, rehearsing questions
concerning prohibition or spiritualism, and really wondering if the
Acheron is now crossed by motor-boat, or whether the Elysian Fields
are properly gridironed.</p>

<p>To sum up: the notion of culture is too often dimmed in the
American mind by the phantasm, uselessness; and thought, with such
an impediment, is difficult indeed.</p>

<p>Has it always been so? Is this, a part of the American
idiosyncrasy which cannot be modified? Anybody who has disturbed
the files of early American newspapers or reviews does not hesitate
to give this question a negative answer. America is constantly
spoken of as a young nation or a nation of young people. I used to
be on my guard against this formula which I thought might be only
an extensible lid covering all boxes. Gradually I have come to the
conclusion that it is largely true. But it is true only of modern
America. Early America was not young; it was quite mature. Not one
of the men who signed the Declaration of Independence would have
struck a member of the contemporary English Parliament as unduly
young. The contrary would probably have been the fact. But not one
of those men could appear on the campus of one of the modern
successors of their Pennsylvania, Virginia or Maryland schools
without shrugging his shoulders at the seriousness with which mere
play is now taken. America has grown young during the latter part
of her career, but this youthful America is something different
from the historic United States. The American elite knows and
deplores this. The extraordinary effort towards the diffusion of
education seen everywhere in America is the vital reaction of a
society feeling itself threatened in its essentials. But the
resistance of the unwieldy mass, so far, is too great.</p>

<p>The requirements of this mass still fashion the educational
methods instead of the mass being fashioned by them, and no amount
of testing, trying, or theorizing has, as yet been able to change
this preposterous situation. The mass wants easy methods, and so
the methods are easy. It wants immediate practical results, and
practicality is considered first.</p>

<p>Easy methods seem to be a dogma with Americanizers. Easy is the
word one hears all the time in connection with the art of teaching.
I wrote, a few years ago, a school-book which was published in New
York under the title <i>French Grammar Made Clear</i>. The book has
been misquoted, scores of times, as <i>French Grammar Made
Easy</i>.</p>

<p>French grammar cannot be made easy. Nor can Latin grammar. It
can be made, and ought to be made, clear and interesting. But no
attempt at brightening it with Alma-Tadema pictures can conjure
away the declensions, conjugations and modes. The best psychology
is to persuade the pupil that hundreds and thousands of not very
intelligent people before him have conquered those dry beginnings
by mere perseverance. In fact little peasants trained for the
priesthood by plain country <i>curés</i> who never dream of calling
themselves scholars constantly master Latin morphology in three or
four months. More than once I have seen the neighboring clergyman
drop in during the lesson and play with the <i>petit latiniste</i>
as the Tuileries <i>enchanteur</i> plays with the sparrows. Seldom
does the red-faced little fellow miss a crumb of the cases or
tenses slyly filing at him. No inferiority complex with regard to
mere words has been planted in him. He does not think of his
declensions as something difficult or something easy, but as
something which everybody has to learn and does learn.</p>

<p>On the other hand, read the directions issued by the York Board
of Education concerning the teaching of elementary Latin. The
person who drew them up was evidently full of the notion that
everybody must think Latin morphology as uninviting as the
cuneiforms, and that can be done is to take it in easy, i.e.,
minute instalments. Several months are supposed to be necessary to
master the first three declensions; then a long rest is given to
the student as if to prepare him for a final and much worse spurt;
then the last two declensions are tackled or, I should say, played
with.</p>

<p>What psychological background is likely to be created by this
nerveless method? Evidently a notion that the Latin declensions are
a nightmare, but <i>dies</i> and <i>cornu</i> are more formidable
than the other three. My own teacher, who had no idea of any
directions but who possessed a tradition, said to us in perfect
good faith: "<i>Dies</i> and <i>cornu</i> being simplicity itself,
you shall learn these two declensions, instead of one, for next
time." The result was that even dunces were not afraid of the Latin
declensions. Ask most American boys and girls who have gone through
a classical course, and you will find that Latin morphology is as
vague in their minds as badly taught Greek is in Europe. People in
America remember being put through a book or two of Caesar, a book
or two of Virgil, an oration or two of Cicero, but their idea of
Latin as a language is that it is a University specialty, as
Sanskrit appears to most people, i.e., something you are not
expected to know. My surprise was great when I saw an American poet
who shows no small pretensions to scholarship entitling one of his
poems <i>Pueribus!</i> Such are the results produced by making
Latin easy.</p>

<p>The real result is that four, five or six years of so-called
study only leave the impression that "nobody knows Latin; nobody
can know it." A deeper and more dangerous one is that giving time
to such a hopeless task is an absurdity. The suspicion that to
compel young American citizens to go through an entirely useless
routine is absurd and even immoral is not far. Try to play the
Tuileries <i>enchanteur's</i> game with one of these school boys.
You will read a great deal in the bored or incredulous expression;
either an inferiority complex is there, working its usual damage,
or it has already been kicked out, along with ancient wisdom, by a
young barbarian who refuses to be made a fool of.</p>

<p>Utilitarianism in education is as disastrous to culture as
so-called easy methods are to scholarship. The preference for
scientific branches which can be turned to immediate account is of
course a manifestation of the utilitarian spirit. So is the purely
practical teaching of modern languages prevalent in most schools.
So is the absence of all philosophical teaching in the High
Schools.</p>

<p>But more striking is the way in which apparently disinterested
literary efforts are turned to mere utility. I was quite impressed
the first few times I was shown a school paper, and realized that a
staff of boys under a boy editor was responsible for what is
comparatively excellent stuff. It was only by degrees that&mdash;in
spite of the poems which Anglo-Saxon boys or girls produce with
more facility than French students&mdash;I realized that here was,
not a literary, but a newspaper training. The school newspaper is a
good newspaper but that is damning praise, for a good newspaper is
not literary and a school newspaper ought to be pre-eminently that.
The editor ought to have in mind Addison, Cobbett or Bernard Shaw
when he writes an essay; as a matter of fact he does not even think
of Mr. Mencken's imitators: the little home paper is his standard
of excellence. If Addison were imitated the results would be poor
but literary; as it is, the results are not literature, even if
they seem fair.</p>

<p>The same can be said of the short stories, one-act plays or
scenarios produced in the Fiction or Drama schools of many an
American college. The teaching is first-rate, the methods are far
more thorough than those used in the classical courses, the wish to
succeed and the effort towards success cannot be questioned. What
are the results? Undoubtedly superior in craftsmanship to, say
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>. The terseness, the rapidity, the turn of
the wrist, the balance, impress and almost intimidate you. In rime
you discover that these qualities are the accompaniment, or even
the creation, of an ardent desire to produce a "marketable"
article. Then you understand why the more you read of those
excellently manufactured stories the less claim they seem to have
to be called literature. Literature is not so clever. It wrestles
with life and often gets beaten, but the struggle compels our
homage. Anybody who has received a literary education feels this;
but if education goes over to the enemy and begins to teach
commercial methods, the minds, even of the <i>élite</i>, will be
invaded by the parasite of utility at all costs, and the power of
thinking in terms of beauty will lose in consequence.</p>

<p>The American boy leaves school with a more or less definite idea
that what is called culture is a luxury, that is to say a
superfluity. He has not been taught to view Latin as an artistic
mosaic, or English composition as an effort to rise above himself.
His imagination has been discouraged rather than cultivated. He is
far inferior, in cultural respect, to the Americans of eighty years
ago.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>In absolute opposition, French schools turn out young people
convinced that nothing, except the attainments of intellect, has
much right to respect. Educated French men and women, with whom
deep spiritual realities do not act as a counterweight find it
difficult to take a practical view of life because of a phantasm
created during their formative years: the self-sufficiency of the
brain.</p>

<p>Nine out of ten French schools are located in towns. The most
famous ones are in Paris. Many of them still use ancient monastic
buildings as different as can be from the château-like schools of
America, and these medieval monuments are, in many cases, the
successors of Gallo-Roman schools. A tradition of culture handed
down through many centuries clings to these grey walls, but the
very sight of the cramped courtyards shut in between tall houses
betrays a disregard, nay a complete ignorance, of bodily
requirements.</p>

<p>Many Frenchmen still alive knew no other exercise in their
school days than the dismal circuitous walk allowed to prisoners in
penitentiaries, and twice a week the melancholy walk through the
suburbs and back. The early recollections of such writers as Taine,
Daudet or Bourget are full of self-pity. But they admit that, while
their bodies were inactive, their minds were busy: these poor boys'
vitality was kept up by the excitement of discovery in thought or
expression and the clash of ideas, which make French conversation
something like an adventure.</p>

<p>Today the <i>lycéen</i> goes regularly to the "gym," and on
Sundays or Thursdays he actually has a chance of playing football
or tennis. But his daily routine still shows two hours given to
play as against eleven given to study, and the French champion on
the game field, if he happens to be dull elsewhere, will be an
object of amused wonderment rather than of admiration.</p>

<p>School in France does not mean boys, it means teachers and
books. For centuries the books were the Latin and Greek classics
taught in order to be spoken, or at all events written, as
naturally as the student's mother tongue. Little else was drawn
attention to, but the characters of ancient history became
familiar, and the main lines of the science of politics were
inferred, even when they were not taught.</p>

<p>Today literature has routed all its rivals, even science, no
matter how idolized, and it is so in schools as it is in life.
Greek, Latin and French classics stand on the schoolboy's desk
beside scientific books and manuals of history. But the one book to
which he will naturally revert, the one which his hand
instinctively seeks at vacant moments, is his Lanson or his
Desgranges, the manual of literary history. He may have a turn for
mathematics and know he must face years of severe effort before he
can get admission to the Ecole Polytechnique, but literary history
will be no less attractive to him.</p>

<p>What does he get out of this panorama of intellectual
development elsewhere almost exclusively reserved for grown-up
specialists? A mixture of good and bad. He certainly acquires a
philosophical bent by noticing the concatenation of ideas, systems
or sentimental reactions which make up the history of literature:
his mind becomes used to the logic of facts, and, year after year,
grows more enamoured of the lucidity resulting from the vision of
causes and effects. But, long before he has had time to do more
than take a cursory view of the great monuments of literature, he
has been given general ideas about them. He has acquired the
terrible French craving for summing up complex realities in one
formula, and too often he has grown accustomed to the
semi-philosophical jargon of the literary historian. If he is
mentally strong, his vocabulary will be helpful; if he is not, the
learned words and apparently illuminating fore-shortenings will
only give him a cheap superiority over people who have not had his
training. They will give him something even worse: insincerity.
For, in his heart, he knows that he says a great deal for which he
would be unable to give chapter and verse.</p>

<p>Even more frequent is the French boy's delight in reading about
a writer's personal development. The Romanticists, especially, from
Rousseau to Loti, ravish his soul. The possibility of living a life
rich in emotion and made sublime by inspiration seems to him the
one desirable goal. Read Fromentin's novel, <i>Dominique</i>, if
you wish to realize the havoc wrought by such a huge obstacle
placed at the outset on the path to right and sensible
thinking.</p>

<p>Is this exaggeration never corrected by French teachers? you
ask. A French teacher, in Paris especially, is unlikely to dispel
this fallacy, for he himself is a prey to it, Count the masters in
English and especially in American schools, who publish books. How
can they, since when they are not with the boys, teaching, they are
with them playing? A French teacher is a man who has written, is
writing, or wants to write a book, quite possibly a novel or a
play, and to whom literary renown is the one glory worth working
for. His example, as well as the point of view he cannot help
expressing, contributes to plant ever deeper in his boys'
imaginations the phantasm that literary men and women are the real
heroes The word genius is repeated in French schools till the
pupils cannot escape from the double conviction that it is the one
thing worth having and that they will never possess it.</p>

<p>Living incarnations of genius the French boy eagerly seeks.
Sooner or later he will Boswellize one of his own discovering. In
the meantime he delivers himself up to the influence of his
teacher, sometimes of the top boy, a French institution of which no
Steerforth can give an idea. I do not think that the scornful
French vocabulary cruelly distinguishing between the <i>tête</i> of
a class and its <i>queue</i> exists in any other language. It
predisposes the wretched <i>queue</i> to humble subservience to
what is wrongly supposed to be superior and diminishes its
self-respect In other countries sporting achievements, daring, or
some promise of business sense or executive ability will give those
so-called inferior boys a feeling of strength which saves them; but
in French schools intellectual superiority is unchallenged, and the
corresponding inferiority complex is at liberty to fill the soul it
has once invaded.</p>

<p>Practical consequences in the life of the nation itself are only
too visible. The passion of the French for ideas makes them imagine
that when an idea has been expressed, its own virtue will be
sufficient to get it realized. Properly analysed this fallacy can
be reduced to the notion that some practical person will do what we
are too superior to undertake. Hence the everlasting vision and
brilliant <i>exposé</i> of reforms accompanied by a caustic
denunciation of abuses so striking in French conversation. I once
took a foreign visitor to the house of a friend of mine where
social improvement was the business of the <i>salon</i>. This
extremely earnest young man was impressed to the highest degree. "A
lifetime," he said, "would not be enough to carry out all the plans
this two hours' talk has disclosed to me as possible." The Sunday
after I gave him the same treat. Not one of the possibilities which
had seemed so urgent a week before was as much as alluded to. A
brand new set was produced and passionately discussed. The young
man was astonished and I was a little anxious about his next
reaction, for earnestness does not flourish in the vicinity of
brilliance.</p>

<p>Foreigners who make in France a stay of sufficient duration to
be personally affected by the numerous shortcomings in the official
life of the nation are invariably puzzled. How can such intelligent
people put up with such absurdities? they ask. In time they give
themselves some sort of an answer. I have not forgotten the verdict
which, when I first visited the United States, in 1908, a famous
American politician passed in my presence. "The French are bright,"
he said, "but they are not intelligent." It was a comfort to
reflect that the word "bright" in American-English is marvellously
extensible, but I felt the sting of truth. Abuses are tolerated by
the French provided they can laugh, or make cynical remarks about
them. The press campaigns, the enlightenment drives which are
perseveringly carried on in the United States are impossible in
France.</p>

<p>The toleration by the French of their politicians is of the same
order and arises from the same feeling of superiority of ideas to
mere contingencies. Politicians are despised as roguish valets are
by indolent masters. The Scandinavian idea of compelling them to be
trustees for the community, or of expecting tangible results from
their presence on the boards of the national administration, never
occurs to the average Frenchman. Life, he thinks, is not very hard,
after all, even if governments do not try to make it perfect.
Good-humoured contempt is reform enough.</p>

<p>Preference for ideas, especially general ideas allowing
simplified visions, is a French trait, even when terrible
consequences may be the result. An Englishman, practically all the
time, an American, in most cases, will know when positive danger to
their country, and consequently to themselves, is imminent, and
promptly cease discussing ideas to see to practical measures. To
dance on a volcano is a decidedly French phrase describing a French
attitude. Ideas count more in France than facts, and as long as
education is at one with the national bias to prefer the art of
living to the struggle for life, this one-sided view will go
on.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Let us now remember our little boy of nine or ten, so receptive
that great poets envy him, and so full of searching curiosity that
philosophy cannot keep up with his questions. What becomes of him
when he leaves school? In America a husky young chap, all muscles,
heart and wishes; in France a slender young man, all brain, totally
unprepared for life, apt to mistake ideas for realities and words
for ideas. Both have received their education, both have had their
chance. The American will always remain ill-equipped, full of
intellectual gaps, uncertain between confidence and timidity and
showing it; the Frenchman, if he is not saved by his religion, by
patriotism or by some other uplift, will be largely artificial.
Both men will think the thoughts of their environment, not their
own, and education, which is nothing if it is not an applied Art of
Thinking for one's self, will be to blame for this result.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-2-06" id="ch-2-06"></a>Chapter Six. Thought
Weakened by Life</h3>
<h4>a) THE THINKER'S LIFE</h4>
<p>People are wont to praise life as the great educator. In fact,
nobody can deny that life is a succession of lessons enforced by
immediate reward, or, oftener, by immediate chastisement, which
cannot pass unnoticed. Our successes and our failures create in us
an instinct for safety which we decorate with the names of
experience or wisdom. It is also a fact that action, when it is of
certain quality and calls forth our best energies, acts upon us as
our noblest experiences may, and we look back to the few years or
months during which the effort lasted with a nostalgic yearning. To
some men the word "Front" means the place with the sublimely vague
name where their soul was at its fullest...On this high level,
action not only can help thought, but it produces it with a
continuity which raises it to the height of creativeness.</p>

<p>However, these are rare experiences, and it cannot be denied
that daily life, the apparently tremendous effort of one thousand
million mortals repeated day after day, adds little or no thought
to the common capital while, on the contrary, it wears out the
individual's thinking capacity. Plato says: "Experience takes away
more than it adds; young people are nearer ideas than old men."
Young saints are not scarce, an old one is a delightful exception.
We cannot dissociate solitude, freedom and leisure from our concept
of a life dedicated to thought: Spinoza in his one room where the
carefully chosen monotony of his manual work acted on him as the
monastic routine acts on a Benedictine scholar; Descartes leaving
Paris for a quiet suburb of far-away Hague; Bossuet retreating like
a hermit to the cabin at the end of his garden; Pasteur or Edison
in their inviolate laboratories; learned monks in their convents;
sages in the shady seclusion of a Massachusetts village; artists
everlastingly trying to form colonies uniquely dedicated to
disinterested work: all show us pictures of the kind of existence
we imagine as naturally favourable to thought. The social life they
conjure up is reduced to a minimum. It is little more than a soft
accompaniment to the working of the mind, as the hum of the
spinning-wheel is to Marguerite's reverie. We must feel some life
going on near us, and even an occasional dip into exaggerated
activity is a tonic, but social intercourse should never be more
exacting than that which we have with the watchman protecting us
during our nights.</p>

<h4>b) NON-THINKING LIVES</h4>
<p>Over against the calmness, security and concentration of the
life of a Spinoza, set the existence of most of the people we know.
They speak of themselves, rich or poor, as driven slaves, drudges,
who "cannot call their souls their own."</p>

<p>Millions are oppressed by manual work, either because there is
too much of it, or because the life has been taken out of it by
standardization, or because its alternate praising up or
depreciation by so-called labor leaders replaces their natural
attachment to their occupation by uncertainty and sometimes hatred.
Many hundreds of thousands who would feel inclined to think highly
of their work and realize its dignity cannot indulge the tendency
because of the insecurity in which they live. When you see the
traces of untimely weariness on a man's face, in nine cases out of
ten, you may be sure that overwork is not to be blamed; what is to
be blamed is the anxiety of not having any work to do; that has
sunk the eye and pinched the mouth. Literary or artistic people
with a vocation and no means are the classical instance and well
deserve to be. After they become famous their historians are apt to
repeat the thoughtless and heartless saw that it is good for
writers and artists to be a little hungry. The fact is that wealth
is injurious to art, but artists cannot live without a certain
amount of success. Failure and anxiety have never been known to
elicit the best from a man's faculties. Too often they have done
the reverse. The man seeks refuge in misanthropy or in dissipation.
If he tries the usual path to success, endeavours to make himself
agreeable or popular, curries favour with rich or influential
people, he loses his dignity, and the quality of his thinking
deteriorates simultaneously.</p>

<p>Driven, slaves, and drudges are also the rich. Preachers and
moralists are apt to say that rich people are less happy, have more
cares than the poor. I heard a bearded Capuchin once say that
golden crosses were heavier than wooden ones. These metaphors sound
well under the vaults of a cathedral, but they are not true. Golden
crosses large enough for one to be crucified upon do not exist; if
they did they could be sold for big sums and the price of them
given to charities. Rich people have fewer cares than poor
ones&mdash;that is the sober truth&mdash;but they are driven by
their fellow men and women, drudges to organized nothingness, and
slaves to amusements. Their endless complaint is that they never
have any time and are glad occasionally to be sick, in order to
steal a little rest. Yet, they dread solitude and their one antonym
for amusement is boredom. Travelling teaches them something of the
outside appearance of the world, and social life gives the best
gifted of them a store of facts&mdash;though it is surprising to
notice how little they know about human nature. But time for
thought they have not, a taste for serious conversation or serious
books they seldom have or soon lose. They live on their most
elementary instincts, seeking happiness in pleasure, affairs, or
power.</p>

<p>Whatever they do, they try to sell oftener than they buy, not
realizing that in the life of sentiment egotism gives us the shadow
for the substance. Soon their scale of values is falsified,
immediate fruition taking precedence over unknown deeper joys. A
worldling is pre-eminently a person whose judgment is not right,
because his mind is full of inferior images and tyrannical
phantasms. And gregariousness is the most powerful tyrant in such
lives. People, still more people! Often distinguished men or women
appear in the drawing-room or at the dinner-table. But of what use
are they beyond the petty satisfaction of win: "Oh! I know him"?
Who listens to them? Who helps the hostess in her effort to give
the lion a chance? Who wishes to make the most of a rare intellect?
On two occasions I saw Cardinal Mercier pitifully wasted. Americans
cannot realize how many chances for mental improvement they lose by
their inveterate habit of keeping up six conversations when there
are twelve people in the room.</p>

<p>To sum up, the child notices grown-ups and begins to think their
thoughts; he goes to school, and too often education imposes other
people's thoughts upon him instead of helping him to go back to his
own; once out of school, he makes money, or arrives, or amuses
himself; there is no question of thinking any more, unless we call
thinking using one's mind to attain practical ends. Altogether,
life does just the reverse of what it is supposed to do; it travels
away from thought, and the process begins when we are ten years
old.</p>

<h4>c) THE GREAT WASTE</h4>
<p>Reading is supposed to help thinking; a man who reads simply
borrows another man's thoughts, and this means a craving for
thinking. A scarcity of books is understood to amount to
intellectual fasting. Reading, Bacon says, makes a full man; and
Dangeau, dining with Louis XIV, once answered a question of the
King with the sentence: "Reading does to my mind what your
Majesty's partridges do to my cheeks."</p>

<p>But there is reading and reading. The word, like "intelligent,"
like "wit," has been in service a long time and its fringe has
gradually become different from what it used to be. Reading, in its
earliest stage, cannot have been remote from a magical or a
hieratic process and was part of a rite. Our way of reading by just
running our eye quickly along a page of type would have surprised
and shocked the Ancients. Few people, in antiquity, knew how to
read, and few possessed the bricks, stones or rolls necessary for
reading. So, like Herodotus at the Olympic games, they were
expected to impart to their less fortunate brethren something of
the treasure in their hands. Reading out loud seems to have been
the rule. It must long have been the custom even in private
reading, and the rustic who moves his lips as he reads is keeping
up a tradition. Candace's eunuch, who was reading Isaiah on the
Gaza road, would not have been overheard by Philip had he not read
his book aloud. A biographer of Saint Ambrose also tells us that
this learned archbishop was sorely tried in old age by having to
renounce reading, "because his throat was affected." So people
would only take up a book for a purpose and with a gravity now
reserved for reading the Bible or documents of a semi-sacred
character. The whole soul was in requisition and its whole power,
undiminished by distraction or by phantasms, was applied to the
high task. Who can doubt that reading, under such conditions, must
be effective? Legouvé, a mere man of the world, once beat Cousin, a
philosopher and a scholar, in the discussion of a doubtful passage
of La Fontaine. Cousin asked the reason, and the other man said: "I
always read La Fontaine out loud whereas you read the <i>Fables</i>
as most people do; my voice tells me when there is a danger of
misinterpreting a line."</p>

<p>So the quality of reading was excellent.</p>

<p>The quality of what was read was as good. Books were few and
costly and there was no idea of accumulating them indiscriminately.
Even the invention of printing did not at first modify the
composition of libraries: religious books, poets and philosophers
were the foundation; light reading was provided by Homer or by the
historians. The libraries of Kings and those of the rich
monasteries seldom counted more than a few thousand volumes.
Individual collections were naturally smaller. Spinoza possessed
less than sixty volumes, of which we have a list. A hundred years
later Kant collected three hundred, but half of this number were
narratives of travel, for Kant had a frivolous side.</p>

<p>People, from necessity, as well as from a traditional choice,
limited themselves to what we call today the classics but in those
days were simply called good books. They were mostly written in
difficult languages which it was not enough to play with, as our
students do today, but which must be mastered. Latin had to be
spoken, and even Greek was still used by Petavius when he defended
his thesis at the age of twenty-four. The <i>Thesaurus Linguae
Graecae</i> of Stephanus is full of echoes of Greek conversations
held in the printer's backshop. The scholarship of those days
tackled everything with a decision which was the very negation of
an inferiority complex. If you studied one volume, you knew the
sacred writings of the Christian religion; if you went through the
few tomes of Aquinas, you knew theology; if you annexed the
<i>Pandects</i> you knew law. The effort was made by thousands who
thought no more of it than a modern apprentice to an electrician
thinks of his hourly approach to the mastery of his trade. Every
minute counted.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that many men were supposed and
supposed themselves to be in possession of practically all the
knowledge of their day&mdash;a belief destructive of all phantasms.
It is not surprising either that men whom we should call young and
immature were regarded with unalloyed respect. We now speak of men
of forty-eight as young. This is a purely modern notion bred of the
fact that wisdom has now to be forced upon us. The men of the
French Revolution were never derided on account of their youth, as
the men of the Commune, eighty years later, were. Guy-Patin,
telling in 1660, the amusing story of the feud between the
physicians and the surgeons, relates that the former were defended
by M. Lenglet, professor of rhetoric in the Collège du Plessis, and
rector of the University. He subjoins that this remarkable orator
was a native of Beauvais and twenty-six years of age, but he
attaches no more importance to one particular than to the other. A
man of twenty-six was a man and not a boy, as we foolishly imagine
and openly say, to the detriment of the race by the diffusion of a
dangerous phantasm. If he began early enough, worked hard enough,
and worked under the best conditions, a man of the pre-scientific
periods felt himself thoroughly equipped before he was
twenty-five.</p>

<p>Today printing has gone mad and the world is in danger of being
submerged by the ocean of books. Eleven thousand volumes are
annually published in France alone to about seventy under Louis
XIV. And who can think, without feeling dizzy and sick, of the
billions of words deluging every Sunday morning the American towns?
"Make your own choice!" the guilty editors would say. "Know what
you want! We have it ready for you." A wise counsel, indeed, for
the whole Art of Thinking is in it, but only the man who knows how
to think can follow it. The 'others, millions of them, will be awed
or bewildered by the formidable inroad of printed things upon them.
In such a confusion, phantasms and inferiority complexes germinate
like microbes in an active solution. The worst of them is probably
the notion that one cannot have an opinion about every book, yet
one must seem to have one. This gives a free field, and secures a
multitude of slaves to slogans. People pretend they have read what
they have not read and repeat anyhow somebody else's judgment.
Nothing, of course, can be so destructive of thought and of the
capacity for thinking. No such lever can wrench a man from out of
his own soul.</p>

<p>When people do read, what do they read? Certainly not Aquinas or
the <i>Pandects</i>. Many pretend to read the Bible, but of how few
it is true! Three or four in a thousand read poets: they are
regarded with the same surprise&mdash;not unmixed with
mistrust&mdash;with which the poets themselves are considered. What
is produced by the gross, what is constantly forced on our
attention, trumpeted by publicity and magnified by criticism is
fiction. Novels fill the bookshops and suffocate our bookshelves.
What people read in the country where there is a little time to
read are novels; what people pretend to read or skim through in
town where there never is any time are novels. And the novels are
not those great works of fiction which, since the sixteenth
century, have added to our knowledge of mankind, or even their
modern successors of such fame that we cannot ignore them; they
are, and the readers know they are, pure and simple trash, the very
titles of which will be forgotten in a week. "What are you
reading?" I once asked an English friend, a woman of high character
and no mean achievements&mdash;"Novel."&mdash;"By
whom?"&mdash;"Don't know." (<i>Semi-guilty, semi-apologetic little
laugh.</i>)</p>

<p>Novels are read to kill time&mdash;the most sacrilegious phrase
in modern languages. And the word "read," since the people of the
past three or four generations have been weakened to death by
fiction, not only has lost its former majesty but has changed its
very meaning. It is now mentioned, along with smoking and playing
cards, as a semi-physical relaxation; the notion of a definite
purpose in giving one's self up to it is excluded. The real purpose
hidden under the gregarious act of reading is NOT TO THINK.</p>

<p>This is quite plainly visible when the time-killer is using
periodicals. I do not mean the reviews or even the magazines.
Anybody who, in default of books, has lighted in the country on a
forgotten nest of the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, or <i>The
Atlantic Monthly</i>, or even of <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>
must have realized how much substantial food is canned in those
apparently ephemeral objects. Moreover, I shall have a chance in
the third part of this volume to draw attention to the capacity of
the daily newspaper to transform itself into a first-rate
instrument of thought. But it requires a special need, a special
gift, or a special education to raise it up to that level. In most
cases the newspaper is not read at all or is barely glanced at.
Often it is still neatly folded up late in the afternoon until the
maids feel they must give it a chance. Or the way in which it lies
over an armchair is revelatory of the kind of attention it has been
vouchsafed.</p>

<p>The true measure of its possibilities as a thought-weakener is
taken when we watch an average newspaper reader in the train. I
remember once observing a man on the other side of the aisle
between Philadelphia and New York. We both had the <i>Philadelphia
Ledger</i> across our knees. I made a few red marks on my copy and
then began to notice the gentleman. He read the account of the
swimming feat accomplished by some lady in the Hudson River. This
was a story of some length which had to be continued on page 6,
column 3. But the gentleman was unequal to the effort of turning
three big sheets over; he was reading, not exerting himself.</p>

<p>So, leaving the grease-coated nymph, he went on to the
cross-examination of the Pig Woman in the New Jersey case, and,
dazed by the fusillade of irrelevant questions which the Pig Woman
herself described in an immortal sentence as "talk, talk, chatter,
chatter," he began alternately to fidget and yawn, but he never
skipped a line. The whole mortal newspaper was read through in that
way, on the brim of disgust or sleepiness, with occasional flickers
of energy accompanied by a stiffening of the bust and a falcon
glance at nothing through the window. In time the swimming lady
reappeared in a comer, and the Pig Woman filled serried columns
again, and there was a presidential message to Congress, and
editorials, and news of the corn market, and shipping and sporting
intelligence. All this was read on the same level, and with the
same unfathomable disinterestedness till we neared the tunnel. Then
the gentleman, all fagged and faint, showed a marvelous reflex; he
flung down the crumpled sheets, jumped to his feet and felt for his
cigarettes. He had been reading.</p>

<p>Imagine the effects, in the long run, of a so-called
intellectual process which consists in presenting to the mind a
score of different objects in none of which any real interest is
taken. If we remember that our most serious attempt at mastering
what we read is constantly hindered by adventitious images which we
call distractions, leaving possibly two thirds of our consciousness
available for what we read, we shall have little doubt that
reading, as practised by most people, is nothing but a method of
not thinking. Let this go on for several years and the brain will
become what is properly termed jellified. Now, this goes on through
a whole lifetime with the majority of men and women. They leave
school or college at eighteen or twenty-two. At that stage academic
necessities have compelled them to read mostly serious books and to
read them seriously. As far as education goes they were going in
the right direction. The first thing the world and its so-called
civilization do for them is to persuade them that masterpieces are
tedious, text-books or encyclopaedias bore-some, whereas light
literature goes along with freedom. Henceforth reading will be one
of the destructive forces, arrayed against them. The newspaper,
above all, will bewilder them by its desultoriness or weaken them
into faint-' hearted common scepticism by its contradictions. They
will be the toy of irresponsible head-liners.</p>

<p>Here let me conjure up, only for an instant, the wistful face of
the man immersed in business, thinking of intellectual culture as
of a Paradise Lost, and able at most to devote halt an hour a day
to religious or philosophical reading, or occasionally to a poet
worth the name. How noble and pathetic this visage looks! How we
bow to the often marvellous results produced by the thirty minutes
set aside for thought! But how rarely we encounter the almost
heroic person who will save himself from annihilation whereas
millions happily plunge into it. The idea of such a thing as
printing contributing to such a result is well-nigh unbearable.</p>

<p>Another waste&mdash;so well known and unfortunately so
inevitable that it is useless to say more than a word about
it&mdash;is conversation. "Conference makes a ready man," Bacon
said. Ready for what? The Ancients, like most Orientals today, seem
to have spoken only when they had something to say, and their scale
of valuing what was worth saying and what was not, appears to have
been the same as that of their best writers. Hence the pithiness of
their speeches. When a writer, not even of the highest
order,&mdash;say Mr. Galsworthy&mdash;hits upon the device of
contracting his dialogues to the two or three brief sentences with
which impassioned people will wind up a conversation, he produces
an unexpectedly powerful effect.</p>

<p>Now, think of the twaddle in the "smoker," of the empty boyish
tongue-wagging in club-houses, of the <i>risqué</i> gossip gilt
over with a dash of wit in French salons, or of the corresponding
Anglo-Saxon delight in stale anecdotes! What a mockery to repeat
that speech is the instrument of thought when it has become the
mere satisfaction of a physical craving! If Bacon should rewrite,
in the light of modern facts, the famous sentences from which I was
quoting above, he would say that reading despoils a man of his
personality and conference shows that he has lost it.</p>

<p><i>The general conclusion of this Part II can only be
melancholy. Man is born without phantasms or inferiority complexes
and with a capacity for observing and garnering thought-fostering
images. Life, including such&mdash;apparently&mdash;helpful
influences as education and literature, destroys this tendency, as
an April frost kills blossoms, and imitation, ignoble conformism,
takes the place of originality. Mankind is like
Herculaneum&mdash;covered over with a hard crust under which the
remains of real life lie forgotten. Poets and philosophers never
lose their way to some of the subterranean chambers in which
childhood once lived happy without knowing it. But the millions
know nothing except the thick lava of habit and repetition. A small
section of people tells them what they are to think and they think
it.</i></p>

<h2><a name="ch-3" id="ch-3"></a>PART THREE: HELPS TO THOUGHT</h2>
<h3>Chapter Seven. Living One's Life</h3>
<h4>a) EXTERIOR SOLITUDE</h4>
<p>Many people fear it and call it depressing, a selfish or
immortal, few really prefer it, but almost everybody thinks of it
with pleasure. The name has a beautiful sound which even the
hackneyed Latin jingle: <i>o beata solitudo, o sola beatitudo!</i>
has not succeeded in spoiling, and the idea is enchanting. We envy
Madame de Sévigné leaving the Court and her friends for the
retirement of her Breton&mdash;manor, Bossuet or Meredith alone in
their hidden cottages at the end of the garden, Rousseau in his
forest, Silvio Pellico in his prison, Alain Gerbault on his
ocean-bound boat Dickens among his friends charms us in Forster's
volumes; why are we even more attentive when we hear of his endless
rambles through the streets at night? The picture shows us nothing
except a man in quest of we know not what in the dark, yet we are
fascinated by it more than by anything immediately available.</p>

<p>The fact is that even the most worldly worldlings get tired of
the nothingness of their lives, and know the surfeit of sameness.
Although they play the game with a bravery worthy of a better
employment they feel beaten sometimes, and relieve themselves with
the profound complaint that "they cannot call their souls their
own." They hanker for solitude, even if it is only a few days in
Paris in Summer or in Newport in the Spring. They cannot always
afford it; then the semi-isolation of the concert, of a simple
service in an unfrequented church, or a few hours in the auto
relieves the intolerable pressure.</p>

<p>There is in every man a feeling of enmity to
things&mdash;whether they happen or only exist. We hate the
crowded, confused lumber-room where no motion is free, we want to
push rubbish out of our sight, to reduce objects to a minimum, as
the Carthusian does in his white cell with just a plain black cross
on the wall. The notion of vacuum is repellent to us, but let
enough appear round us and above us to create the idea of a shelter
and we breathe freely and happily. We "find ourselves," as the
phrase goes, our poor neglected self, dearest of friends, yet
dragged along everywhere like an ill-treated dog, hardly ever
spoken to or taken notice of, going where it listeth not, till at
last the unnaturalness of it all appears, and, for a few hours, we
live instead of just being alive.</p>

<p>The Art of Thinking is the art of being one's self and this art
can only be learned if one is by one's self. Society only produces
social thoughts, <i>vulgo</i> slogans, that is to say, words, but
words endowed with the power of a command. Solitude produces an
exhilaration of consciousness, the consciousness of our innermost,
whatever that may be. It never fails of this result. Take strong
coffee one morning, to keep yourself awake, lie not in bed but on a
couch for two or three hours, and try to simplify and again
simplify your problems, that is to say, in most cases, your
home-made annoyances, remembering that you are a Christian and not,
as Madame de Sévigné used to say, <i>une jolie payenne</i>. You
will soon understand why Descartes made his discoveries lying in
bed through the mornings.</p>

<p>How can we secure solitude when our path is beset with a variety
of undesirables? There is no answer to this question if we do not
really crave solitude. But if we do, solitude will come, for no
magnetism is as strong as a man's wish to be let alone. The day you
will notice with satisfaction that you are glad of being kept
waiting because this gives you a chance of being left alone, you
will know that you really love solitude, and you will not have to
seek it or pray for it any more. Solitude will be where you are. I
know, in busy New York, a woman with a home and family who manages
to be five hours in an upper room every morning, writing; I know
another who has rented a mysterious room on the ground-floor of her
own building and has never been found out yet, even by her own
maids. But I know another, apparently the very type of the social
woman with the most engaging smile on her face; she is always in
her house and never denies her door, yet she reads serious
literature, ancient and modern, as if she had an ocean of leisure,
and in fact never complains of not having time enough. How can that
be when her telephone ought to be buzzing all the time? People
are&mdash;afraid of this woman's wish to be let alone with her
serious books. They simply do not dare to ring up that number.</p>

<h4>b) INTERIOR SOLITUDE</h4>
<p>We call it concentration. As exterior solitude is the reduction
of human beings and even of objects around us to a minimum,
concentration is the elimination, one after the other, or by one
sweeping effort, of all images foreign to a train of thought This
train of thought is often spontaneous: we then call it absorption.
Common parlance rightly unites all mental conditions of this kind
under the term "to think." As long as whirlpools of uncontrolled
images fill our brain we are not supposed to think. The moment
images of the same nature come under our observation we know we
think and simultaneously we become unconscious of most things
extraneous to our thought.</p>

<p>Who has not seen a man walking through a crowd indifferent to
all except his interior vision? George Tyrrell had to be watched if
one wished to keep him within the visible circle in which he was
sitting: leave him two minutes to himself and he would be miles
away. Lovers, poets, artists can thus be solitary in spite of their
company. Alphonse Daudet never denied his door to any visitor. Only
the caller, no matter who he was, was immediately given full
details about the chapter on which the novelist was at work.
Daudet's mind was apparently more active when he could speak his
thoughts, and his invention was helped rather than hampered by the
presence of his fellow-men. People dominated by one great passion,
apostles of all degrees, live in their mastering purpose and do not
need exterior solitude to think. It is difficult not to be struck
by the contrast between Saint Paul's itinerant career and the
concentration and condensation of his writings. We know he dictated
his letters in rhythmical sentences. The presence of the secretary
or interpreter did not disturb him; he was used to constant company
and no doubt craved it During the war a strange-looking person one
day sat down next to me on a bench on the Terrace of Saint-German.
He was a Russian workman, a simple man with just a few hundred
words to his French vocabulary. In spite of this deficiency this
man was eloquent. For more than an hour he poured himself out in a
defense of pacifism which was not in season but which compelled my
admiration all the same. Visibly my presence was only a pretext or
an incentive for this worshipper of an absorbing idea.</p>

<p>Many people are professionally trained to concentration.
Napoleon could pass from one subject to a completely different one,
from strategy, for instance, to the Charter of the
Comédie-Française, as if he had been another man. He had in his
mind what he called sometimes drawers, sometimes atlases, providing
him with the matter he required. Lawyers, or spiritual directors,
often surprise us by the undivided attention they can give to one
consultant after another, but they limit themselves to kindred
cases and are collected rather than concentrated. However they too
manage to live in an interior solitude which constant knocking at
their door does not succeed in breaking. No doubt, such men are
nearer to thought than the ordinary mortal, as a librarian is
nearer to books than the costermonger in the street.</p>

<p>No complaint is more frequently heard than "I cannot
concentrate" unless it be the other groan "I have no memory." On
cross-examination you find that people who cannot concentrate are
conscious either of a heaviness nullifying every intellectual
effort, or of a volatility precluding any but a tip-of-the-wing
contact with the object of attention, the moment they try to
collect and focus their consciousness it seems as if there arose a
whole flight of irrelevant images to mock and confuse them. If they
fight this confusion nervousness frequently sets in, and its victim
will in every case prefer frivolity to pain. This accounts for the
numerous cases in which people are visibly trying to do anything
rather than think. I have observed boys fidgeting and evidently ill
at ease when an interesting book was read to the class. On the
contrary, they would sit apparently contented when the tedious
everyday drudgery went on. They hated the book, interesting enough
to keep them from thinking of something else, but did not mind or
rather liked the humdrum routine with its minimum demand and the
freedom it left to their imagination.</p>

<p>Can we learn to concentrate? The doubt implied in this question
is in itself an inferiority complex responsible for many a failure.
As a matter of fact nine out of ten men or women who possess the
capacity of folding their wings round their attention have acquired
it by patient practice. The nature of our mind is, as has been
shown in the first part of this book, to superimpose sets of
images; to eliminate as many of them as possible is an effort which
only necessity or some yearning can make a success. Attention is
less a gift than a habit, and the knowledge of this ought to
encourage those who wish to live inside then-own souls.</p>

<p>Nervousness is of course a tremendous obstacle to concentration.
People who are made nervous by company, who feel exaggeratedly the
superiority in wit or looks of others, who are made uncomfortable
by tricks or affectations, ought not to blame themselves for
feeling unable to concentrate in the presence of their
fellow-beings. Goldsmith certainly wrote like an angel: nothing can
be more logical, in spite of its gracefulness, than <i>The Vicar of
Wakefield</i>. When Oliver talked like poor Poll it was because he
was made unbearably nervous and had to say anything rather than
endure the pressure. He was not talking like poor Poll the day he
stopped some other writer's praise with the admission that it
tortured him to hear it. Goldsmith ought to have avoided commune
with literary people who carry irritability everywhere with them.
If you are conscious of the same fluttering, seek kind, simple
people rather than brilliant ones. When you are accosted by someone
whose talk you know by experience, disturbs all your concentration,
smile, feel charitable and Christian, but say nothing, keep
immovably silent, till the other man's sinister magnetism has spent
itself in talk. You will be aware of the moment when your chances
become even with his.</p>

<p>Interest of any kind produces concentration naturally. Selfish
people concentrate on their own immediate profits, idealists on
their idea. We cannot be five minutes with a person without
realizing what the nature and elevation of his interest may be:
whether it is gain, vanity or pleasure, or whether it is some
aspect of our multiform wish for the world's betterment.
Disinterestedness is its own reward, for it fills the soul more
than any conscious effort. Nobility of point of view or purpose, an
indifference to petty advantages, the charity of the true
Christian, the never-interrupted contemplation of the mystic, all
seem to us at the same time to confer intellectual superiority and
to create a paradise for their possessor.</p>

<p>If we descend to the merely intellectual level, we shall find
that here too real interest is essential for concentration and
creates it in an instant. The same boy who goes wool-gathering when
he has to write a literary essay can concentrate for half a day on
mathematics or on a new radio implement The same people who think
they can only read the lightest kind of fiction can get pleasure
out of innumerable memoirs undoubtedly easier to read than novels.
They never dare to say that they concentrate on novels, because
people would think it ridiculous, but they would not hesitate to
admit that they concentrated on the <i>chroniques</i> of courts,
and, in fact, they would know concentration as well as most
historians. "Walk a hundred steps straight away from the main
road"&mdash;Doudan says&mdash;"if you stick to one direction you
will find some deliriously shaded spot or even a springing well." I
used to know a French priest who, strangely enough, cared only for
the theatre, a taste he could hardly indulge in a sleepy cathedral
town. Beginning with the plays published by <i>L'Illustration</i>,
this frivolous ecclesiastic gradually formed a vast dramatic
collection. In a few years he was regarded as an authority on the
modern drama, and when death interrupted an occupation which had
become a specialty without ceasing to be a pleasure the sale of
those volumes accumulated to satisfy a whim, was a literary event
To collect is to specialize and specialization is only another word
for concentration. The upshot is that we are sure to concentrate
the moment we have an interest or find a pleasure in doing so. The
Art of Thinking is largely the finding out what gives our intellect
its satisfaction without any effort or any restlessness.</p>

<p>However, we cannot always follow our inclination in thinking as
we do in acting. There are dull problems that we have to tackle; we
know intellectual duties not any easier to discharge than moral
obligations: we may love poetry and dislike history, like Shelley,
but we feel we must not imitate Shelley in his indifference to
history, for only genius can disregard the general canons of
culture. How can we concentrate on subjects which, not being
attractive, naturally produce absent-mindedness? Another chapter
will be devoted to mental exercises every one of which tends to
create concentration. So would newspaper problems, questions and
answers of all descriptions, cross word puzzles, etc. Madame de
Maintenon, in her direct honest way, describes reflection as
"thinking attentively several times over of the same thing." This
definition provides excellent guidance when the object of our
concentration is one and not many and when it lies well in the
field of our mental microscope. But frequently things are
complicated instead of being simple, or we are trying to
discover&mdash;not just examine&mdash;thoughts, and the problem of
concentration in such cases becomes different from mere attention
to a schoolboy's lesson.</p>

<p>Let it be understood, to begin with, that concentration is
impossible if we are fagged or dull.. Too much sleep or too little
sleep leaves a vacuum in our brain. So does too much eating or too
much fasting. So does too much exercise or too little. Do not
imagine that when you feel sleepy mentally, violent physical
exercise, like squash, will wake you up. It will set all your
animal spirits in motion, but tingling arteries generally go along
with a spangly rush of disorderly images to the brain. Reading will
not help your mind into what you think is the proper path either.
Complete immobility, or a peaceful cigarette, or ten minutes at the
open window, or strolling alone under the trees, or, sometimes, a
cup of tea, will bring you nearer to the legitimate fountain of
your thoughts than anything else.</p>

<p>When your heart is calmed by the unusual stillness of your mind,
when the moths of distraction have dispersed, you are ready for
concentration, but you may still find yourself facing a blank. Many
intellectual workers are conscious that their effort to eliminate
superfluity seems to have eliminated essentials as well. What do I
want to think about? they wonder. What am I interested in? Am I
interested in anything?</p>

<p>People endowed with good memories seldom experience this
barrenness. Un the least provocation their drawers or atlases fly
open and they feel flush with data. It is the curse of most people
so gifted that their data have long been stereotyped, borrowed as
they often are from somebody else and never improved upon. On the
contrary, people conscious of working on living matter,
impressions, intuitions, or sentiments, pretty well pleased with
their minds one day, disgusted the next, are, so to speak,
cohabiting with nature, and their intellectual existence is a
drama. Their very lack of memory makes them feel the necessity of
continuity. They strive to rejoin themselves, to be in the natural
flux of their conscious or sub-conscious existence from the days of
childhood till now. Their memory is not an indelible board, it is
more the consciousness of a few highlights, peaks of interest round
which subordinate data naturally group themselves. Historians like
Michelet or Carlyle obviously have memories organized in that way,
but the main lines of even books like Gibbon's <i>Roman Empire</i>,
or Fustel de Coulanges's <i>La Cité Antique</i>, show a dominant
interest more purely intellectual, it is true, but still productive
of crystallization. On the contrary, Mommsen&mdash;to whom I owe
too much to speak of him disrespectfully&mdash;had an infallible
but inorganic memory. Our effort ought to be to resume where we
left off the last time we were vitally and completely active. We
should never take up the newspaper without remembering that our
interest in politics, that is to say, in contemporary history, must
not be mere curiosity. We want the world to be wiser and less
cruel; and, if there is a man or a country giving us hopes of the
improvement foreseen by the Isaiahs of all countries, it is the
progress of that man or that country that we want to follow. Our
continuity on that plane is the condition of our memory as well as
the channel of our concentration.</p>

<p>Concentration which, at first sight, is obtained by elimination,
the elimination of images not harmonious with our trend of thought,
can best be obtained by the conjuring of a suitable background. And
this background is nothing else than the multiplication of
harmonious images. If I want to concentrate, in order to understand
it, on American isolation, for instance, I must, first of all,
empty my sensibility of all irritation caused by narrow-minded
defenses of this isolation, then I must rapidly people my
imagination with such notions as the vastness of America&mdash;best
realized by the extent of its lakes or its deserts, its lack of
obtrusive neighbors, its self-supporting capacity, its tendency to
conformity and its surprising realization of the words "foreign"
and "foreigner"; I can remember that the Roumanian taxi-driver who
once took me about in New York spoke to me of his country, left
twenty years before, as if he had exchanged purgatory for Heaven;
he helped me to understand the Pilgrims, men who had shaken the
dust off their feet on the old continent&mdash;the very reverse of
colonists; and the Pilgrims, in their turn, help me to understand
the rebellious, the defiant ring of the word "American" in the
newspapers of the pre-revolutionary period I have on a few
occasions consulted. It is enough. If I finally remember that
Europe appears to the untraveled American as a many-mouthed hungry
monster, my concentration is complete. I think of nothing but the
isolation of America and I understand it so well that, were it not
for another set of images near by, I should promptly share in it.
Multiply such visions and distraction will not know where to have
you.</p>

<p>This is the natural and vital way of thinking. All our notions
come from such groups of images and when we wish to restore life to
an idea hardening into words we instinctively recall the concrete
circumstances from which it was originally evolved. Not otherwise
do speakers who hate memorising create in themselves the
mood&mdash;both intellectual and imaginative&mdash;from which real
eloquence will flow. The interior cinema unrolling its pictures for
their benefit is not, like more abstract trains of thought, at the
mercy of distractions; and the hubbub of the dinner-table, or the
revolving scenery outside the carriage-window, hardly interferes
with it.</p>

<p>Another infallible method of concentrating&mdash;or, so to
speak, tempering one's attention, is to take pen in hand and
prepare to write down what our mind will dictate. There 5 in the
very gesture something imperative which the most wandering mind
seldom resists. A successful writer whom I was asking about her
methods of working told me: "I take a blank sheet and a pencil, I
sit at a perfectly bare table and pretty quickly a story comes." So
also did Anton Chekhov who wrote for the magazines stories which
were not magazine-stories like those of this lady. But it is
especially when we want to be clear and definite, to make up our
minds about some issue, that the sheet and pencil process proves
helpful.</p>

<p>Apart from the thing in which we are vitally interested, the
more or less conscious objects on which our egotism concentrates
without any outward incentive, teacher, or advice, we spend our
lives in vagueness. Most men and women die vague about life and
death, religion or morals, politics or art. Even about purely
practical issues we are far from being clear. We imagine that other
people know definitely their own minds about their children's
education, about their own careers, or about the use they should
make of their money. The notion helps us to imagine that we
ourselves are only separated from decision on these important
issues by the lightest curtain of uncertainty. But it is not so.
Other people, like ourselves, live in perpetual vagueness. Like us
they foolishly imagine they are thinking of some important subject
when they are merely thinking of thinking about it. When this
fallacy has been nursed for some time in our sub consciousness we
decide that the question admits of no compelling answer and we act
according to the pressure of circumstances, or perfunctory advice,
or the slogans of the moment. It is surprising how few people's
testaments are really their wills. They had never been able to know
their own minds, so the lawyer or some relation dictated the
document.</p>

<p>If we should sit before the blank sheet, and write on two
columns the arguments pro and con an idea that occurs to us, the
truth would flash on us. We should either be struck by the evidence
of some considerations or, no less startlingly, should we see the
necessity for seeking Advice on this or that point. Advice of whom?
Do not go back to the illusion of just thinking of thinking about
the possible persons. Take another sheet and write down the
<i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> concerning advisers. Quite
instinctively you will keep those sheets in one envelope. This will
be a <i>dossier</i>, in every point similar to those shaping the
destinies of empires.</p>

<p>Robinson Crusoe had recourse to this method when he could have
recourse to nothing else. Saint Ignatius Loyola describes it at
full length and has made it the basis of spiritual life in his
Society; few people know that the fifty odd folio diaries left by
that incomparable adviser, Prince Albert, hold the written
preparation of the suggestions he used to give Queen Victoria. Try
the system once, you will never desert it. It is only fair to warn
you that the habit is apt to become tyrannical; you will
mechanically reach for your pad and pencil not only when you have
to decide about selling your house, but even when you have to pack
up a trunk. Everything has its inconveniences and I will point out
more fully further down some drawbacks of fixing one's thought by
writing. But making up our mind is a necessity and better be an
unsuspected crank than too visible a weathercock.</p>

<p>On the whole, concentration is a natural state which can easily
be reproduced by simple methods. It is only supposed to be
exceptional because people do not try and, in this, as in so many
other things, starve within an inch of plenty. Those who do try
have never been disappointed in the process but have sometimes
experienced disappointment in themselves.</p>

<p>"I only find ordinary thoughts," they complain.</p>

<p>"Yes, but they are your own and better produce ordinary thoughts
than nothing."</p>

<p>"I do see glimpses of deep truth or am conscious of brilliant
flashes, but they vanish like will o' the wisps."</p>

<p>"Blessed are you. You will not be eloquent, but you will be
phosphorescent."</p>

<p>A few years ago I sat at dinner next to an American woman who
charmed me by the subtlety of her judgment, but whose short flights
constantly disappointed expectations constantly rising again. Yet,
I never can open Joubert without thinking of her, a great
achievement for a society woman. And did not Montaigne admit,
without much concern, that he could "charge a difficulty only once
or twice after which he had to look away from it"? Boys who try to
read the hour on a church-clock a mile off know the dodge. What we
are expected to do is only to make the most of our
possibilities.</p>

<h4>C) MAKING TIME</h4>
<p>Have you really no time? Are you sincere, or are you just
repeating what everybody else is saying? No time! The extremity of
poverty! Perhaps your idea of having time is not having some time
to yourself, but having all the time, having nothing to do: Examine
your conscience and answer.</p>

<p>Axiom: <i>Very busy people always find time for
everything.</i></p>

<p>Conversely, people with immense leisure find time for
nothing.</p>

<p>Perhaps you do not know what concentration means. If so, sell
all your possessions, leave your dearest and nearest, and having
re-read the previous chapter devote three days or maybe three hours
to exercises in concentration. You will soon find out whether you
know how to concentrate or not.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you will do well to ask yourself a few
questions.</p>

<p>1&mdash;<i>About saving time</i>.</p>

<p>Is there no time you can reclaim, not from your work, not from
your exercise, not from your family or friends, but from pleasure
that really does not give you much pleasure, from empty talk at the
Club, from inferior plays, from doubtfully enjoyable weekends or
not very profitable trips?</p>

<p>Have you learned how not to give in to idlers? Can you steel
yourself against the temptation to give pleasure to people whose
laziness needs no assistance? Do you discriminate between kindness
and weakness, never refusing to do a good turn, but always refusing
to be a dupe? Are you an absolute slave to the telephone?</p>

<p>Do you know how to gather up fragments of time lest they perish?
Do you realize the value of minutes? One of the Lamoignons had a
wife who always kept him waiting a few minutes before dinner which
in those days was in broad daylight, at three o'clock. After a time
it occurred to him that eight or ten lines could be written during
this interval, and he had paper and ink laid in a convenient place
for that purpose. In time&mdash;for years are short but minutes are
long&mdash;several volumes of spiritual meditations were the
result. Mankind might be divided between the multitude who hate to
be kept waiting because they get bored and the happy few who rather
like it because it gives them time for thought The latter lead the
rest, of course.</p>

<p>What do you do in trains, cars or taxis? If you do nothing in
perfect contentment, well and good, but if you feel restless you
are to blame. Trollope, who was a commuter, wrote many a chapter in
the train. You might read these: they are worth your while, and
Trollope is in fashion. You cannot be reading or thinking without
avoiding company: people no doubt will remark that Vere de Vere
keeps much to himself, but it cannot be helped. If you try to
think, you must expect to be a little apart and not a little
above.</p>

<p>Do you carry a little book, a great little book of the approved
President Eliot description, or, oh joy! one of your own finding,
in your breast pocket?&mdash;"It isn't done"&mdash;"Oh! I beg your
pardon, I meant a pack of cards of course. Excuse my
absent-mindedness."</p>

<p>What time do you get up? Could it not be three quarters of an
hour, or half an hour earlier? If you give up reading in
bed&mdash;a practice condemned by all oculists and by not a few
moralists, you can manage it. Nobody has ever been able to explain
why a Latin education should give that curious superiority to
people, but it does. There is the same mystery about saving the
morning&mdash;"Clean up the morning trench," Fenelon wrote to a
lady&mdash;"for intellectual work." Somehow it does the trick. An
hour in the morning is worth two, and the nothingness that must
inevitably come in the silly hours afterwards will not submerge
you.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>2&mdash;<i>About frittering time away</i></p>

<p>Do you often hear yourself saying: "I forgot" or "I didn't
think"? These ejaculations mean that you are losing time, have to
go over beaten ground several times, through your own fault. We
should never forget, at all events so seldom that it will be a
surprise.</p>

<p>You will hardly ever forget, you will not be fumbling and
recommencing, if you possess two easily acquired habits, foresight
and order. To foresee means to imagine in advance. A quarter of an
hour can easily be saved in the Pullman if you have visualized what
night or morning things ought to be on the top of your suit-case
instead of lurking where the fingers will anxiously feel for them
with an accompanying scowl of the brow. Foresee that the customs
examination means your trunk-key in a well-defined pocket. If you
are liable to the emigration man's cross-examination, do not trust
to your passport alone, but have in readiness a letter, asked in
advance of your American hostess, where there will be references to
Long Island weekends or to the Opera, but no references to
lecturing, for lecturing is sure to mean atheism or Bolshevism. If
you forget to write for that letter four weeks before sailing it
will come after you have sailed. If you forget it in your stateroom
and have to fetch it there from amid the disgust and scorn of the
other aliens, you will find that your trunk has just been moved out
of your cabin and is somewhere on its way to letter D.</p>

<p>These are elementary exercises in imaginative foresight. You
will do well to visualize more important possibilities such as
marriage, old age, illness, death or lunacy, failure in this or
incomplete success in that, errors on your part and treason or
stupidity on the part of others. Read the future, do not be the
bleating sheep or the silly frisking lamb, and as your imagination
shows you things as they will probably be, only not so bad, jot
them down and keep the notes carefully. With surprising rapidity
you will find yourself in the possession of notebooks telling you
with fulness and clarity all you must do preparatory to moving out
or selling out or other important outs and ins.</p>

<p>"What a bore!" you exclaim, "what a slavery to
things!"&mdash;No! what freedom! what independence and security! My
note-book is a fortune. So is another fat dossier in which my
blunders are recorded for profitable private reading.</p>

<p>Order is the sister of foresight, as you can see. He is
unnatural who, visualizing a call on So and So does not put in his
greatcoat pocket, or next to his hat, the book long ago borrowed of
So and So. A bench in the hall strewn with things that have to go
out, memos on the rug round your desk do not mean untidiness but
order. Things should be where they will not be forgotten.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>"Are you sure you know the difference between order and
tidiness, dear Madam? Your boudoir certainly looks wonderfully
well-groomed and manicured, but where is that rather important
letter which came Saturday from the lawyer?" Ah! where is it? If we
should peep under the cover of that exquisite <i>bonheur du
jour</i> what should we see? What a conglomeration of letters, some
in their envelopes, some out of them, of bills, of invitations,
concert tickets, old programs and what not! How long it will take
to find the lawyer's letter! How many times will the dainty fingers
dart at a pile of papers, in the firm belief that the note must be
there, only to get out of it with the impatience of the
disappointed humming-bird!</p>

<p>Now let us go at it with a little order. Let us have on this
chair the opened letters, on that table the others, on the
<i>Standard Dictionary</i> the bills, everything else in the waste
basket.</p>

<p>"Wait! on one of those programs, oh! on one of those programs
are two lines of Crashaw which I would not lose for the world."</p>

<p>"Here they are. Where do they go?"</p>

<p>"Ah! where? In the <i>Cambridge History of Literature</i>,
section Crashaw?..."</p>

<p>"No, believe me, fetch a large strong envelope, tear it open at
the top, write Crashaw on it, put in that program, and lay it on
one of your shelves. Pretty soon there will be fifty more such
wrappers and your husband will say admiringly that this is a
regular office...Now, glance at the opened letters. Not a red
pencil mark on any, you surprise me. Well, you have to read the
letters all over again...All these useless? Why are they kept then?
Tear them to pieces and into the waste basket."</p>

<p>"These two from Mrs. Chambers I want to keep."</p>

<p>"Big envelope, Chambers written on top, lay next to Crashaw.
Simplify."</p>

<p>"These two, these four, these fifteen have to be answered."</p>

<p>"Heavens! I understand why all foreigners complain that
Americans do not answer letters. Most business-like nation in the
world; Well, there is no help for it. You are a lady, you must
answer letters. Take fifteen envelopes, put the fifteen letters in
them and, in the bitterness of your heart, write fifteen
superscriptions. Henceforth, the moment a letter comes, you will
red-pencil the important passages, ask yourself whether this letter
is for the waste basket, the Chambers-Crashaw shelf, or the
to-be-answered pile. If the latter, put the letter in an envelope,
write the superscription, affix stamp&mdash;if the letter goes to
Paris, please, do please stamp with a five and not with a two, as
you always do&mdash;the higher this pile of unanswered letters
rises the worse your conscience will feel, and annoyance will teach
you virtue.</p>

<p>"Why! There's the <i>bonheur du jour</i> empty! and here's the
waste basket full! and here's a happy surprised smile on your face,
and you know now the difference between tidiness which is hypocrisy
and order which means a place for everything and everything in its
place, whether it be a shelf, an envelope, or the waste basket.</p>

<p>"Do not say that it only took half an hour to clean out the
little desk and consequently you only wasted thirty minutes by not
being methodical. For the same jumble that was in your desk was
also in your mind, and even in your life, my dear lady; you lost
time and thought little of it, but moreover you were ineffective, a
poor fumbling tennis player who never gave a smash. Your ideal
should be never to waste a step, a word or a gesture. Looseness is
the reverse of elegance. Indeed it is in everything the first
cousin of slovenliness."</p>

<p>Next to lack of order, one of the most fatal ways of wasting
time as well as weakening one's life is to hesitate before acting.
A friend of mine came back from his four years in a prisoners' camp
in Germany with the nervous inability to decide called
<i>abulia</i>. I was watching him one day when he stood before the
hat rack for a full minute uncertain on which peg he should hang
his <i>képi</i>. The scene was pathetic. It is only irritating when
the hesitancy is the consequence, not of ill health, but of lack of
energy, intelligence, or method. Some people can dress in forty
minutes, because they have learned the automatism which M. Bergson
used to recommend so persuasively. Others will take an hour and a
half either because they have not adopted the invariable order
which, in time, becomes automatism, or because they hesitate before
decisions which ought to be mere gestures. You see them looking
round and wondering what next, sometimes looking out at the window
or smoking a cigarette to brighten up their wits, or endlessly
hesitating between two collars or two ties.</p>

<p>An old French word preserved only in a few Northern districts
describes this graphically. It is the verb <i>tourniquer</i> which
shows us a person aimlessly moving in a circle till an inspiration
for definite action comes. Of course the circling has a tendency to
last longer while the inspiration grows slower. Some people simply
use up their lives thus beginning and not beginning to begin. Five
minutes before a sheet of paper with the famous question of Foch on
top: "<i>De quoi s'agit-il</i>?" and a pencil to answer it, would
break the sinister charm, but chronic hesitancy looks for no
remedy. Its answer to itself is: we must first think about it; but
the thinking never begins. In fact the word beginning is
terrifying. Nothing can be truer and more encouraging to men
equally gifted with a human desire for action and a human
indulgence of laziness than the Greek sentence: <i>The beginning is
half the thing</i>. Writers know it well. Students at school ought
to be taught how true it is. You have to write at college an essay
on Ronsard. Go straight to the French professor who can best give
you a list of a dozen passages showing you Ronsard at his most
sublime, at his most graceful, at his worst greco-latin, etc. Go
straight home and read these, making notes of what you observe and
of how you react. Lose no time and sort these notes. Think about
them till some flesh comes on these bones, and, without losing
time, write down what you have to say and say no more.</p>

<p>Your will can be prepared and drawn up in the same way. So can
your answer to a proposal for a partnership. So can your
Machiavellian campaign for bringing So and So round to offering you
a partnership. Learn to attack things frontally but according to
the most scientific methods. Be the Lindbergh of whatever little
ocean you have to cross. Our life should consist of a thousand
brief dramas, complete in themselves, swift as a game of poker.
Some business men have given me a truly artistic pleasure by the
infallibility of their dictation. Each letter meant a rapid
weighing of <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i>, a decision, and the thing
done at once. Other business men...</p>

<p>Have you ever begun to learn French or German? Yes? and you feel
like beginning again? Believe me, do not. One experiment should be
enough. The demon of hesitancy delights in telling people that they
ought to learn languages. Rather collect match-boxes like the
Russian prince in <i>Sylvestre Bonnard</i>. He had only one missing
specimen to find and the search filled his life. Much rather begin
today, this very morning, some kind of social work that will give
you a right to eat your dinner without shame.</p>

<p>So time can be "made" and the well-worn phrase is not a
deception. If you possess lists of things to be done in given
circumstances (before going to the country, before sailing, before
entering on a study); if your agenda is a clearly-sectioned table
showing you at a glance what you have to do, you will be a busy
person, but you will have a sense of power over things. And if you
know how to concentrate, i.e., how to use the keen edge of your
mind, having time and possessing the tool, you will only need good
material for thought. It is to this material that the next chapters
will be devoted.</p>

<h3>Chapter Eight. Living One's Life on a Higher Plane</h3>
<h4>a) THOUGHT-PRODUCING IMAGES</h4>
<p>Remember that our mind is active on a constant succession of
more or less connected images. These images, as we said,
characterize our mental quality. Pass from a noble art gallery to
the picture department of a store, and you will be conscious of
mediocrity coming after distinction. Every man's imagination is a
picture gallery. If the pictures were visible, instead of having to
be inferred from the talk or general deportment of the individual,
we could grade our fellow-beings as we do vases in a shop.</p>

<p>It is useless to do more than recall what was said in §2 of Part
I about the general inferiority of the images filling the minds of
most human beings. Many of them are hardly superior to those
constituting the mentality of the animal, always remembering that
animals are not infrequently far above human beings in sensibility
or in the capacity for love. The mind of an habitual drunkard, or
that of an undeveloped peasant, knows little besides images
connected with elemental wants. Sex maniacs, of whom there are more
than people imagine, even the average specimen, the well-dressed
man who follows women through the streets, are almost incapable of
producing more than one category of images. Misers, men who build a
fortune, as modern parlance prefers to say, are also hypnotized by
one tyrannical set of pictures. So is the ambitious worldling, the
social climber who sees on his inward scroll mostly press notices
of his attendance at committees and public banquets or decorations
and titles. The most usual type, of course, is the man or woman
imprisoned in his or her paltry existence, and endlessly attentive
to its shabby details. Jane Austen is almost ferocious in her
descriptions of the superior specimens of this inferior type, the
one of course which we jostle every day.</p>

<p>We all probably have a word in our vocabulary to describe this
all-pervading mediocrity. When I was a boy in our little French
town I used to patronize a shop kept by a M. Pailla who was also
something of a farmer and was not devoid of the something that
makes a gentleman. He was a rotund and short elderly chap
unexpectedly nimble on his little feet. While looking round his
shop for the particular bonbons or jujubes I wanted, he would lend
an ear to the conversation kept up by his tall wife and lean
daughters in the next room. I came away disappointed when I did not
hear him sputter out his disgusted appreciation of their tattle:
"'<i>tits détails, 'tits détails!</i>" which stood for <i>petits
détails</i>, and has served me through life to characterize
inwardly nineteen-twentieths of what I hear and not a little of
what I say.</p>

<p>Can we think as we like? or is not our thought as fated as our
breathing?</p>

<p>Certainly we cannot help thinking any more than we can help
breathing out, but, just as we can choose to breathe pure air in a
pine wood on a high hill, we can place our mind where the images it
will work upon will be of a higher nature. What is to prevent me
from replacing the gossip of Main Street by the gossip of Europe?
Nobody can take real interest in the affairs of the world without
conferring a living personality on those great <i>dramatis
personae</i> of history: the old nations of Europe, the strange
resurgent peoples of Asia, or America now fully come of age. I can
speak of Great Britain and the United States as I might of two of
my neighbors. It will take a great deal of observation of the
latter to give a broad human value to what I may say of them, but
if I say of Britain that a long habit of world-wide power has
prepared her <i>élite</i> for shouldering responsibilities, whereas
America, not quite conscious yet of her new power, is more willing
to be kind than to be a leader, I shall be expressing a thought.
Such is the influence of a vast scene as compared with a narrow
one.</p>

<p>In the same way Signor Mussolini was personally as interesting
or even more so twenty years ago than now, yet what we learn about
him day after day is history and not personality.</p>

<p>Again, there is but little difference between the interests,
ambitions and rivalries of nations and those of clans or families,
as young students of history ought to be told from the beginning,
yet, international questions seem to belong to only a few
privileged observers.</p>

<p>Nothing can be farther away from the truth. Neither Madame de
Sévigné nor Saint-Simon, nor most authors of memoirs possessed a
wide range of political judgment, but they now seem high above
their fellows because their interest was of a dignified order.
Anybody can rise to that level and must blame himself if he does
not. During the war millions of simple individuals did it without
the least affectation and yet in the proper tone, because the daily
topic was history. Today they have relapsed to mere stories and
their thinking has lost proportionately. Yet, the same elements for
high and wide thinking daily offer themselves. I have never
forgotten the sunny Sunday in 1914 when the extras announcing the
Sarajevo news were sold on the boulevards. I could overhear a few
people talking history, but most looked away from this tragic
overture of the greatest drama in history to go back to the winner
at Longchamps, for it was the day of the Grand Prix. Hardly a week
passes, during the history-fraught years we are living, without
such a chance for natural yet high speculation coming our way.
Still, most people insist on talking about Jones or Brown.</p>

<p>It is strange that so many professional critics should make the
mistake of seeking original subjects among the lesser characters in
literary history. Some minors, of course, are of paramount interest
to the historian because, clumsily or unwittingly they started an
important movement Arthur Young counts in the history of
Romanticism, and Champfleury means more than Flaubert in the
apparition of Realism, but one book about Young or Champfleury is
enough, whereas libraries can be written about Balzac, Flaubert or
Byron. If a young scholar asks me for a subject about which plenty
can be said that has never as yet been said, I reply
unhesitatingly: Homer, Plato, Virgil, Milton, Racine, or Alexander,
Caesar, Napoleon, or the Apostolic Age, or the Revolution, or
Death, or Love. The test should be: what is likely to interest an
intelligent child? for children do not care for trivial details
till they have been spoiled by imitation. As for the <i>a
posteriori</i> proof, it is plentiful. What book on Napoleon has
<i>not</i> been successful? Would a young woman like Madame de
Stäel have made her mark, as she did, had not her high intellect
been attracted, from the first, by such vital subjects as the human
passions, the foundations of literature, the Revolution, or German
Romanticism? What parts of such an all-embracing production as
Sainte-Beuve's do we re-read, and which do we skip? Do we ever
prefer a collection of match-boxes to one of Raphaels? The curse of
daily journalism is that the triviality of its topics invites
perfunctoriness in treatment The moment the headline takes us back
to something rich and deep, the reporter makes room for a poet.</p>

<p>It is impossible to spend an hour in a room with a man
approaching greatness without feeling the contagiousness of
distinguished thinking. Such men cannot always be found, or our
chances for meeting them may be limited. But anybody with an
average knowledge of the history of nations, literature,
philanthropy, or art, not to speak of the history of great
religionists or saints, can people his imagination with groups of
superior men in every realm. I shall have an occasion further on to
point out how we can summon any great man to bear us company when
we feel at all lonely, but our serious hours cannot be devoted to a
more useful occupation than studying the lives or ideas of great
men.</p>

<p>Plutarch's <i>Parallel Lives</i> gave first-rate food to the
minds of the <i>élite</i> in all nations until it was regarded as a
classic instead of an amusing book. Madame de Maintenon, who was
neither a king's mistress, as too many people in America curiously
believe, or a bore, as modern French people foolishly imagine,
tells us that her Huguenot mother insisted on her and her brother
constantly bringing Plutarch's heroes into their games as well as
conversations, and adds that the command was obeyed with delight.
The French school-boy does not read any more Plutarch than his
syllabus compels him to wade through for his Greek examination, but
he replaces him by his textbook on French literature: children love
the exceptional and abhor banality in other people's as well as in
their own lives. Musset's moral example is a poor substitute for
Demosthenes; but as Musset's weaknesses finally produced the poetry
of the <i>Nuit d'Octobre</i>, the boyish inference is that there is
an elegant way of being ordinary and that is what should be copied.
His mind is full of this thought when you discover an unwonted
gravity on his brow while he packs his books into his
<i>serviette</i>. Who can say that this boy's thought is not nearer
to real thinking than it will be ten years later when the smart
young lawyer or financier will be attentive mostly to money,
success, and women?</p>

<p>No remedy for the banality of thought produced by the
inferiority of our lusts can equal the meditation of great lives.
Open Clemenceau's little book on Demosthenes and you will see and
positively touch as with your own hand the effect of a constant
preference for great patriots and great thinkers in an existence
which journalism, politics, duelling and all the empty
effervescence of the Forum might otherwise have made shallow. Many
degrees below Clemenceau I have more than once seen Socialist
ranters rise to unexpected dignity by merely claiming that their
action is in a line with that of the great Revolutionists. The sole
mention of greatness acts magically because we all realize its
unfailing influence upon us.</p>

<p>If, at any moment, you are unable to name a great man who is, or
has recently been, having an influence on your conduct, you will be
passing the verdict: ORDINARY on the quality of your own thought
and existence. Conversely, give me the public, utterances of this
or that politician or so-called leader, and I shall be able to tell
you whether he is haunted by some irresistible souvenir of
greatness or merely moved by the interests in the air. America does
not realize how much she owes to the fact that Lincoln is still a
living presence on the Capitol hill, unavoidable even if it is not
sought.</p>

<p>Unconvinced? cold? miles away from Lincoln or Plutarch, my fair
young reader? <i>Ah! que la vie est quotidienne!</i> Still you need
not despair and commit suicide by plunging headlong into chocolates
or boys. Surely you like nature. I met you once alone and happy on
the cliff-way in Newport. You like music, you like pictures, and
you adore laces. The idea of Rome means something to you when you
cross the gangway to the <i>Duilio</i>. It is enough. What a
distinguished person you would be, what a brilliant parterre your
mind would look like if you would generally exclude that which does
not give you the greatest enjoyment of which you are capable. But
it is one of the mysteries of our nature that when our table is
laden with delicious things, we go and cry before Mother Hubbard's
cupboard.</p>

<h4>b) MORAL ELEVATION A CONDITION OF HIGH THINKING</h4>
<p>"Great thoughts arise from the heart," Vauvenargues says; and
Joubert; "There is no light in souls in which there is no
warmth."</p>

<p>The modern French, in spite of Romanticism, show a growing
tendency to rejoin the Greeks in their purely intellectual view of
the production of thought. Yet, they will not infrequently belie
their philosophy by utterances like the above. In fact, it is
impossible to live without noticing how barren our intellect
becomes when it is supposed to be given unbounded chances. On the
other hand, we must all meet some day with men intellectually our
inferiors, yet for whose thoughts we cannot help expressing
admiration. Read the life of that French beggar, Saint Labre,
living in rags and filth on the steps of the Roman churches. Read
the life of the humble <i>curé</i> of Ars, Jean-Baptiste Vianney,
so little gifted intellectually that he was all but refused for
ordination at a period when the French clergy was too depleted to
be fastidious. These two men knew nothing, but they saw everything,
and their view of the world, what they would have been surprised to
hear called their philosophy and its expression, were of supreme
distinction. Look at their pictures. You will see in their eyes and
over their faces something luminous which means nothing if it does
not reflect thought.</p>

<p>Love, whether it be the attraction of Truth, or pure, simple,
elemental love, always opens up the intellect and gives it the
freedom of genius. Maternity also acts in that way. Animals of
course show it wonderfully, and&mdash;let it be said without any
attempt at cheap paradoxicalness&mdash;even artificial women show
it too. The transformation lasts as long as the flow of love
retains its power.</p>

<p>So does any great altruistic impulse filling the whole soul. The
war gave a unique chance to thousands of men and women with
unemployed reserves of devotion. I remember a well-known American
woman who called on me at the Pavilion Belgiojoso, in the College
Stanislas, towards 1908. She wanted information about the movement
of the <i>Sillon</i>, at that time in its full force. But I felt
that she would have welcomed information about anything that might
have given her soul-energies a chance. I remember the eager
questions in the throaty but distinguished voice: every word
betrayed a suppressed longing for something that would liberate her
head and heart. The war gave her the chance which her yearning was
praying for. She spent herself freely and her reward came at once.
I met her again in California in 1919. She had undergone a
transformation similar to that which a happy marriage is often
known to produce. The suppressed impassioned something which made
her at the same time distinguished and pitiful had disappeared, but
in its place there was a superb fulness in the working of the mind
and a mastery-of persuasive language. Fulfilment was implied in
every nuance.</p>

<p>Her case is one of many thousands. A missionary of the real
kind, a hospital worker of the real kind, the innumerable varieties
of social workers, women of the type of Mrs. Howe, or Florence
Nightingale, or Sister Rosalie, apparently merely devoted to an
ideal of action, are transformed mentally by it, and, as Madame
Guyon used to say, could write or speak endlessly about it.
Intellectual inferiority complexes melt away like thin snow in the
proximity of love, and the liberation of the soul is complete.</p>

<p>Nowhere is there such a chance of this liberation as in the
United States where the primitive impulse towards corporative and
cooperative betterment, far from having spent itself, seems to be
in full force. Whoever has been engaged, were it once in his life,
in the instructive task of collecting money for a charity must have
learned that, contrary to the general belief, many Americans of
means can refuse a dollar, but also that nowhere will an idea worth
collaboration find such collaborators as it finds there.
Intellectual generosity&mdash;of which charity is only the natural
sequence&mdash;is an instinct with the American. It is not
surprising therefore that he should find so many chances of
developing through pure love, and that the corporate thinking of
the United States, what people call its ideal, should be of an
exceptional quality.</p>

<p>But suppose these chances should fail honest desire, suppose all
men were happy and fifty-six thousand stray cats had not been found
enduring misery in the streets of Boston alone in one year, would
it not yet be possible to rise up to the region of thought through
moral efforts? Stop the stream of your consciousness for an
instant, look into your soul, arrest the images forming and
dissolving there. What will you see? Petty self-love, of course,
but even more frequently, petty irritations. Our nature is neither
noble nor generous. We remember slights more easily than
kindnesses. We may have lived for days in a home or a foreign
country without meeting with anything except courtesy. The moment
we feel irritated or offended we forget the happiness and nurse the
paltry grievances. We are touchy and on our guard. Self-seeking
possesses us. As we get older and should be more detached we become
on the contrary more alert to the main chance. A studied appearance
of frankness which we acquire in the course of years veils
realities which we would not care to exhibit for inspection. Joseph
de Maistre once said he did not know what a scoundrel's soul might
be, but he knew well what the soul of a good man consisted of, and
it was horrid. It is the whispered confession of us all. No wonder
therefore if, instead of noble images filling our minds, there
should be there a plentiful crop not only of <i>'tits détails</i>,
but of pretty low visions. Thought worth the name can never arise
from a nasty growth. But just as we can prefer decent company to
ordinary or worse, or good books to poor ones, we can crush out
inferior thought, and invite better ones. Just as we learn to sit
up straight, or do not give in, even in our privacy, to too much
freedom of attitudes, we can drive out soul visitors we are not
proud of. This humble beginning of sanctity will be rewarded by a
straighter judgment and by that broader sympathy which is an aspect
of intelligence. Good men generally think right. When they do not,
it seems unnatural, and the lower parts of our soul, the insurgents
in us always ready for an outcry, triumph meanly.</p>

<h4>c) HIGHER THOUGHTS FROM BOOKS</h4>
<p>If you will refer to §c. of Chapter 6, Part II, on the danger of
weak reading, you will know what to expect from this. Reading, to
most people, means an ashamed way of killing time disguised under a
dignified name. Trifling with print in that manner quickly
diminishes the resilience of the intellect. It goes directly
against an Art of Thinking.</p>

<p>If you wish to use books as an adjunct to thought, they must be
books that will not merely amuse or put your mind to sleep, but, on
the contrary, will keep it wide awake and alert.</p>

<p>What are those books?</p>

<p>What they are <i>you</i> know best, and I do not know in the
least. A book, like a landscape, is a state of consciousness
varying with readers. There exists some book, pamphlet, article in
an encyclopedia, or possibly an old clipping from a newspaper that
once set you thinking; there may be many; indeed you may be one of
those rare beings with whom a few lines of print are food enough
for thought because, as Lamartine says, their thoughts think
themselves. The something evocative for you may be poetry, history,
philosophy, the sciences, or moral sciences, i.e., the progress of
mankind. Some people who go to sleep over a volume will be
interested by a review which they think more condensed or better
within their reach. Read reviews if they help you to think, that is
to say if they leave in your mind images that will go on living
when you have forgotten where they came from; read a Shakespeare
calendar at the rate of four lines a day, if Shakespeare quotations
have on you the magic influence they have on some people; read
algebra, read the lives of great inventors or of great businessmen,
read <i>that</i> kind of books which you and nobody else know to be
thought-productive for you.</p>

<p>Some people get more poetry out of ten lines of classical
Thomson than out of the whole of Shelley because they first read
those ten lines in childhood or in a peculiarly receptive mental
condition. In the same way, there may be a deeper source of
romanticism in the brave melancholy of a seventeenth century
minuet, than in a Wagner opera. Nobody can think our thoughts for
us, and nobody can tell us what will act as dew or sun on our
thinking. The book that makes us think is the book we cannot shut
again after we have read one page, because we are entranced by what
it says to us; or it is the book we drop on our knee after reading
one page, because what it says starts us irresistibly questioning,
contradicting, or supplementing. No titles, no categories can be
given to you by anybody but yourself, and what I am going to say
hereafter should not intimidate you into doubting the wisdom of
your answer to the entirely personal question: what books help me
the best to think?</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott thought out his novels while reading books
perfectly foreign to his subject, and who can doubt but Kant was
visited by philosophical inspirations while going through those
narratives of travel he was so fond of? Have you ever analyzed what
has been going on in your mind when you have been pleased with a
lecture or a concert? Sometimes you may have enjoyed following the
argument or the music with more than usual clarity; oftener the
speech or the motif have given a chance to some lurking activity
deep in you and, during an hour, you have been at your most
personal. The Art of Thinking is merely the art of being that, as
easily and as frequently as possible.</p>

<p>Never read a book for the style. Newman's biographies say that
he used to read <i>Mansfield Park</i> every year for that, for the
style. Newman, himself a master of infallible English, must have
been sensible of the exquisite quality of Jane Austen's language,
but he was too much above mere words or mere elegance to care for
what people call the style of an author, that is to say the
gestures of his expression. So ought we to be if we do not wish to
fall to the level of the pedant dealing in mere words and whose
masterpiece can only be a cento. A decided attitude in this respect
will place us at once among the group of the virile people with
whom the substance of things is all-important. What a man means,
where it tends to, and what use it will be to us and to our
fellow-beings is what we want to know. If the Christian habit of
seeing everything <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i> raises this
attitude to the finality and charity that cannot belong to the
merely intellectual order, we shall be gainers.</p>

<p>And what books should we so read?</p>

<p>The principle which has never failed to confer superiority on a
man's thinking activity is the well-worn precept: DO NOT READ GOOD
BOOKS&mdash;life is too short for that&mdash;ONLY READ THE BEST.
This simple recipe is as infallible as good air and good food are
in physical hygiene. Yet, it is a fact that nineteen out of twenty
modern people quake away from it. "Masterpieces again," they groan,
"<i>The Aeneid</i>, the <i>Divina Commedia</i>, <i>Paradise
Lost</i>, we have heard that before: much rather be ordinary than
bored."</p>

<p>The notion that masterpieces are boresome school books
interpreted by dull teachers, or examination stuff, is a marvellous
product of education. Ignorance is assuredly less deadly, for it
can create no such inferiority complex as the schoolboy's notion of
his lack of kinship with the best literature. But this phantasm can
easily be exorcised if we modify the above principle to: ONLY READ
WHAT GIVES YOU THE GREATEST PLEASURE.</p>

<p>In the past century there lived in London a clerk of the
retiring disposition behooving a man of little means, yet with a
turn for the brilliant in civilization, especially for the theatre,
for beautiful actresses, for talent and elegance. This man was a
playgoer of course, but, in his leisure hours in the daytime, he
would read plays, plays of all times and all countries, plays of
any description, provided they gave him pleasure. No reader ever
placed his own enjoyment more decidedly before any other
consideration. We know his impressions, we can hardly be better
informed about the mental background of anybody than about this
absolute dilettante. Uniquely by his untiring application to
pleasing himself and by his delight in analyzing his pleasure, this
man achieved no mean originality. It is evident that, had he
compelled himself to read famous sermons, as many of his
contemporaries still did, he would have made his life not only less
enjoyable but useless. His name was Charles Lamb. When we look into
the kind of literature he used to read, we discover it was the pink
of dramatic literature, and the prejudice against perfection left
on us by the defects of teaching or teachers is so strong that
immediately our chin falls and we know the familiar impression of
disgust.</p>

<p>For all that, Lamb had a superb time all his life reading his
sixteenth century dramatists, a much better time than trash,
unhampered by any inferiority complex, can ever give even us.</p>

<p>A few years ago I travelled from Montreal down to Boston in a
Pullman car which, strange to say, never contained more than three
passengers till we reached our destination. Opposite me sat a
McGill girl&mdash;a junior I inferred from her conversation with
two other girls who were seeing her off. On the other side of the
aisle sat a young man, one of those handsome, perfectly
well-tailored American youths, so attractive that you are willing
to ascribe genius to them as well as a host of minor perfections.
This demi-god was reading. The McGill girl looked across at him for
some time till their eyes met. "Reading?" she half queried, after
an interval of mute presentation leading to a simultaneous smile.
"Yes," a very uncultivated voice answered, "what I want is a love
story with a kid in it and lots of deviltry in him." The book was
handed across the aisle and the girl began to read. The voice had
been an anti-climax and so, evidently, was the book, yet the girl
read on, skimming and skipping. After a while my professorial
conscience smote me and bending over the love-and-kid-story I
whispered: "Have you ever read <i>Vanity Fair</i>?" The girl looked
up, flushed a little and answered: "Dickens?"&mdash;"No," I said,
"Thack..."&mdash;"Oh! Thackeray, of course! No, it was not on our
list."</p>

<p>What would I not have given to have <i>Vanity Fair</i> in my
valise, open it at random and watch the girl's delight at Becky
Sharp's introduction to Sir Pitt's town-house and to his immortal
charwoman!</p>

<p>"You have never read <i>Vanity Fair</i>, which is a wonderfully
interesting book," I said, "and you waste an hour on a
kid-and-love-story which bores you to death."</p>

<p>The girl certainly was bored to death but she was not convinced.
As long as masterpieces appear as books "which are on our list,"
trash is sure to be preferred. Better be bored by it than excited
by great books.</p>

<p>Assignments, examination papers and the commentaries of pedants
are largely responsible for this. For, the moment a great book is
not supposed to be one, it recovers at once its original value as
entrancing reading. Another train incident once gave me a tangible
proof of this fact. I was in the Paris to Orléans train. Opposite
me an intelligent-looking but countrified man was sorting papers.
In the corner, on my side of the compartment, his little daughter,
a child of twelve in black, was reading a square little book also
habited in black canvas by some amateur bookbinder. I never saw
anybody read like that. It seemed as if the old-fashioned but
pretty and dainty little figure were trying to lose itself in that
book. In time my curiosity about a book that could be read with
such intensity became irresistible. I made a brief feint of talking
with the father and then suddenly turned to the little girl and
asked: "What are you reading so delightedly?" The eager little face
looked up, summoned, as it were, from faraway regions.
"<i>Monsieur, e'est l'Histoire Romaine</i>" (brief pause) "<i>et je
vais arriver à Jules César!</i>"&mdash;"How do you know you are
coming to Julius Caesar?"&mdash;"Oh! I have read this book many
times."</p>

<p>I have never forgotten the emphasis on: "<i>et je vais arriver à
Jules César!</i>" No prospect of Christmas, graduation, first
European trip, or <i>début</i>, ever produced emphasis of that
quality. I visualized the background in an instant: a farm on the
windy plain of wheat fields between long strips of grape vines, the
<i>salle</i> with its big mantelpiece; on the side ledge of this,
below the ancestral powder-horns, the tiny library of three or four
musty prayer-books, a gardening book, a cook-book, a surveyor's
manual, a Family Lawyer, a Larousse <i>Dictionary</i>, a few old
almanacs and, in the faraway corner, the little black canvas
<i>Histoire Romaine</i>. In a modern library of fiction or
magazines the squat volume would have been as forbidding to a child
as a black old monk. Next to the Lawyer's or Surveyor's stuff,
Roman History resumed its glamour and Julius Caesar became once
more the romantic hero he was during so many centuries. Owing to an
incredible chance the little girl summed up in herself the dreams,
yearnings and admirations of princesses. No wonder she looked
distinguished.</p>

<p>This is what classics do when they are not killed by those who
teach, them, or, above all, when they are not juxtaposed with trash
sure to make them look like the brown bread of Auvergne as compared
to cheap sweets. None of the inferior stuff to which our children
are treated, while we look on powerless, can ever give them the
feeling of elation, nay, the amusement which great books naturally
produce.</p>

<p>So, if you want to be vitalized into the power of thinking real
thoughts, and if you want never to know one dull instant while
reading, do what has been done by the best specimens of mankind
since there have been books, resolutely leave out whatever is not
of the best. If something in you rebels against this, you are not
in the mood for reading this book, you care for no Art of Thinking,
or you only want mental lozenges which I cannot produce, and so
farewell. But let it not be till you have drawn up a list of the
great books which do possess some attraction for you, and till a
few months' experience has shown you which of these gives you
unmixed pleasure. Those twenty or thirty volumes will be your
library, that is to say, your fountain of thought, your delight,
and when you see people envying you your pleasure&mdash;they will
be your pride.</p>

<p>Does this mean that we should give up contemporary literature,
and live entirely in the monuments of the past? No indeed, for
nothing helps thought like <i>hic et nunc</i> questions, and if you
do not belong to your own time what time can you belong to? We
should read modern poets and modern novelists and follow art in its
most advanced manifestations. There must have been towards 1840
suspicious old Londoners who refused to read the <i>Pickwick
Papers</i> because the book was so unlike Mr. Addison's
<i>Spectator</i>. These old fogeys were losers. It would be as
foolish today to ignore Mr. Sinclair Lewis or Mr. Arnold Bennett,
even if we suspect that, in eighty years, they will not appear like
the Dickenses of the early twentieth century. On the other hand, if
you try to keep up with the industrialized literary production of
today you will be swamped and lost. Is there no way of making a
selection?</p>

<p>There are dozens of ways, but here is an easy recipe. Nobody can
twit you with an affectation of indifference to the present time if
you leave out books which you find are forgotten three months, that
is to say, twelve short weeks, after their publication. Do not read
those. You will be surprised to see how few there will be left to
read. People do not realize that the feverish excitement often
produced on the publication of many books, and which the innocent
public can hardly resist, is entirely commercial and artificially
created by publishers. They imagine that the book itself does it
all. But the book does not do it, and the publisher cannot do it
longer than a week or two. When ten more weeks have put their dead
weight on the little excitement it is more than forgotten. Draw up
a list of the American writers whose works published several years
ago are still on the shelves where the eye and hand occasionally
travel. Those are the ones it would be unforgivable to desert, even
for far superior reading, but you will see how few they are.
Notoriety, high as it is above mere publicity, is still many
degrees below fame. If a man reproaches you for ignoring books that
have not made their author famous he is speaking from publishers'
blurbs and ought to be listened to accordingly.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>All that has been said above applies to literature, and
literature, especially the higher kind of poetry which ought to be
the staple of every cultivated reader, certainly provides a man
with the most accessible thought he needs. However, literature is
not our only field. Philosophy, the sciences, contemporary history
and what are called the moral sciences, all put in our way
explanations of the world and of man which are eminently
thought-productive. In fact, they lead by a straight way to
generalizations which are thought reduced to its most portable
form. Now, it is true that philosophy, history, and the sciences
have, as well as literature, their classics which cannot be
ignored. Plato or Darwin cannot be absent from our library. Yet, it
is especially in that domain that it is not only permissible but
imperative to look for the most up-to-date information, acquired
through the most modern methods. The history of the past interests
us only in so far as it illuminates the history of the present. The
politics and economics of today, the characters and ideas of
contemporary leaders, the tendencies of modern parties are what we
must endlessly revert to. We must be able to take out a map of the
world and read frontiers and their problems like a book.</p>

<p>The same can be said of philosophy. The position <i>today</i> of
the eternal problems means more to us than their solutions even in
the great past. Religious questions ought to be studied in their
latest exponents. So, of course, should plans for social reforms.
So, above all, should the philosophy of the sciences.</p>

<p>Great books, great men, great problems and great doctrines,
great facts and their lessons, all that is opposed to <i>'tits
détails</i> cannot but result in high thought. The busier we are,
the more severe our selection should be. Many men absorbed in
business show such a rare quality of culture that we are surprised
at it. The reason invariably is partly because hard work and even
the weariness it leaves carry a nobility with them, but also
because there is no room in such lives for inferior mental
occupation.</p>

<p>Parents anxious to give their children the best of everything
should as resolutely pack away trash of all kinds from their reach
as if it were poison. It is surprising that intelligent people
anxious to do their best should not realize that no book ought to
be left in the nursery that is inferior to <i>Robinson Crusoe, The
Arabian Nights</i>, or Perrault's <i>Fairy Tales</i>. You do not
wish your children to be too clever? You do not want them to be
like the twelve year old mature little women of the eighteenth
century? Open the window, listen for one instant to the young
people's conversation out on the lawn this week-end, and you will
be reassured. Only too glad will you be if you can teach them to
prefer distinction to vulgarity when they see it. Joseph de Maistre
tells us that his mother used to recite Racine's verses to him when
he was a little child and "his ears, having thus early drunk in
such a nectar, ever after rejected sour stuff." A rare result!</p>

<h4>d) HOW TO READ IN ORDER TO THINK</h4>
<p>The title of this chapter would have sounded incomprehensible to
an Ancient or even to a man of the classical ages. To them reading
meant thinking. So, once more I must insist that the
notion&mdash;and the habit&mdash;of reading as we absent-mindedly
listen to the soporiferous brook belong to a period of mental
decadence. The consequence is that they must be eliminated from the
background of anybody anxious to think. I have been tempted many
times to annex Schopenhauer's maxim in his <i>Paralipomena:</i> "Do
not read, think!" or to transform it into: NEVER READ, ALWAYS
STUDY. A harsh saying? Not if we realize that we should study
nothing that does not interest us, and that studying only applies
to the most enjoyable way of extracting from that what will
interest us the most. In precisely the same way does an artist
study a beautiful face instead of merely glancing at it. We can
never repeat often enough that nothing intellectual can be achieved
against the will of Minerva, that is to say, in a field that does
not attract us. Working in our vein, without a sense of effort,
and, on the contrary, with a sense of ease and freedom, is the
fundamental condition of a healthy mental operation. Do not tackle
algebra when you are attracted by comedies, and if farces attract
you more than comedies leave comedies alone and study farces. Only
STUDY them. You will not have done so long before discovering that
there is more and deeper pleasure in studying <i>le Misanthrope</i>
than in rehearsing <i>Scapin</i>.</p>

<p>This being laid down as a principle, how should you read? As you
please. If you please yourself by reading fast, read fast; if you
read slowly and do not feel like reading faster, read slowly.
Pascal does say that we are apt to read too fast or too slowly, but
he only blames an excess. (Levity is foolish to read too fast, but
seriousness will be a gainer in many cases if it reads briskly.)
Montaigne complains of a formal way of reading. "My thoughts go to
sleep when they are seated," he says, "so they and I walk." Honest
industry merely jogs along, curiosity flies on Mercury's pinions.
Passionate reading not only flies, it skips, but it only does so
because it can choose, which is a high intellectual achievement.
How do you read the time-table? You skip till you come to your
place, then you are indifferent to the whole world and engrossed by
your train, its departure, arrival, and connections. The same thing
with a map which a motorist lends the anxious cyclist at the
cross-roads. The latter's whole soul is in his reading. The same
thing with a financial tip in a letter which a friend is waiting
for you to return. The same thing with any formula for the
production of the philosopher's stone. Whatever we read from
intense curiosity gives us the model of how we should always read.
Plodding along page after page with an equal attention to each word
results in attention to mere words. Attention to words never
produces thought, but very promptly results in distractions, so
that an honourable effort is brought to nought by its own
ill-advised conscientiousness.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, a celebrated French writer dealing in very
serious subjects, has always seemed to me the typical active
reader. He writes his books for himself and prepares them for his
own pleasure. If he scents the least danger of boredom he studies
the suspicious objects at long range, as a sea-captain observes an
iceberg, and reports about it hurriedly and disgustedly. If, on the
contrary, a subject, or an aspect of a subject, charms him, he
approaches it tenderly and carries on a sort of exquisite dialogue
with it. Not with you. You and I do not count much. We are admitted
to the library in which the author bustles from his table to the
shelves or back, we overhear the humorous, admiring, or impatient
remarks he utters as one volume after another is pressed into the
service of the then favorite idea, but all that we get, apart from
this reflected pleasure, is an occasional wink when our unnecessary
presence chances to be remembered. A delightful writer, yes, but a
perfect reader. He never reads slowly; he never reads dully, he
never reads sleepily. Like Montaigne, on his legs all the time,
ready to fly from the book, as we do from a bore, the moment the
book ceases to be fascinating. There is a gulf between that way of
reading and what we have been given to understand is the serious
method, viz. what du Bellay called "Keeping the chair warm," but
Henri Bremond is right.</p>

<p>Does this apply to all kinds of books? Should a poet be read as
<i>Who's Who</i>? Sometimes. Tischendorf once read the New
Testament like that while two Roman prelates tried to keep him from
the Ms. with cheerful Italian chatter. But it is evident that it
cannot be done often. Poetry, like a queen, sets the pace and we
proceed as she dictates. So does the sententious style of wisdom in
any language. Obviously we must make a distinction between what we
read for our information and what we read for our formation,
between what we want for our use and what we need for our
development. History, whether it be the history of politics,
literature, art, philosophy, religions or the sciences, facts and
the conclusions from facts, whatever is best summed up in
encyclopaedias or easily reduced to textbooks, can never hope to be
read better than as a snob reads <i>Who's Who</i> concerning a
duchess or an actress. No attention to the book, no thought of the
author, but the whole mind engrossed by the matter, and striving to
annex it forever within a few moments. Information books, even
Gibbon's or Macaulay's or Mommsen's histories, have a right to our
respect, but they are tools and ought to be used as such. If we
only need to read twenty pages let us not think ourselves
conscientious&mdash;but rather merely passive&mdash;if we read
thirty. If we only read to refresh our memory concerning a subject
by merely glancing at a chapter we have mastered before, do not let
us waste time by rereading every word of it, or, if possible, let
us substitute our notes for it. Boys are told to mind their book.
They ought also to be told to think and not read, or to read with
one eye shut and the other only half opened, so that they will read
in their memory while the book will act as a mere prompter. Why
read a whole page if two lines give you a sufficient idea of
it?</p>

<p>Many books can even be read from their Table of Contents. The
title gives you of course a general idea of their subject. Ask
yourself how you would treat it, what your main line of argument
would be. Refer to the Table of Contents. If it is not one of those
farcical affairs which say "Chapter X: Emerson, Chapter XI:
Nietzsche," and of which publishers as well as authors ought to be
deeply ashamed, a quick and interesting perusal of the seven or
eight pages will tell you at once what you can expect from the
new-comer, where you ought to look for the information he has to
give, and where you are sure to dissent from him. Reading in that
way does not put you to sleep, it does not leave on your mind
shadows of ideas that you would be glad to be rid of, it keeps you
wide-awake as if the book were a living author which, as much as
possible, it ought to be.</p>

<p>Books are not well made. If their authors were anxious to be
useful, they would develop some imagination in trying to serve the
reader instead of strutting to him. They often realize quite
clearly that the statistics or the diagram which they are
themselves using would appeal much more directly to the reader than
page after page expanded from them. But they are not independent
enough or serviceable enough to give them to us in their nudeness.
Peguy was regarded as eccentric because he used typographical
artifices to make his meaning clearer, and until recently a
semi-colon at the end of a paragraph was considered a heresy, even
if it was full of significance. Too copious a table of contents is
discouraged by publishers as injurious to the book and over-helpful
to the reader. The whole concept of a book ought to be
modified.</p>

<p>In many cases you will get more out of a secretary's or a
friend's analysis of a book than out of direct reading. For you
will be questioning, which is the virile intellectual action, and
the other man will be alert. Busy people who have recourse to this
quick way often surprise us by the amount of their knowledge. King
Edward VII, who never read anything, was, however, up-to-date in
two or three literatures: shaving, dressing, smoking, he would ask
questions of intelligent people or have significant bits read out
to him, a truly royal highway to knowledge. La Bruyere alludes to
it when he says: "The children of Kings know everything without
having learned anything." Oral teaching is the most human and the
most profitable of all. The effort made in America to create
"community learning," or the growing habit of putting students in
informal contact with thinkers is in the right direction. People
are sometimes surprised at the results obtained by what they call
"mere crammers." Those results are due to the superiority of
methods making the student's mind more active than it has ever
been. Two students "quizzing" each other the week before an
examination may, for the first time in their lives, know what
mental alertness means. If crammers' methods were used in the
regular schools where sleepiness is often canonized as broad
general culture there would be no need of cramming
establishments.</p>

<p>At twenty, a man taught according to these methods ought to know
the essentials of even the encyclopaedic knowledge of today. He
ought to have given himself or bought himself from some specialist
as good a memory as he can ever get. He ought also to have acquired
the habit of making notes without which Sainte-Beuve says people
read as they eat cherries. If this way of approaching books should
become popular, as in time it must inevitably be, mankind would
cease to consist of an immense majority of minors.</p>

<p>This decisive, rather aggressive way of asking a volume: "What
have you to declare?" leads in a brisk way to information. But
formation or culture cannot be reached by the same high-handed
methods, they require more time, more love, and an admixture of
criticism and humility which is more easily discovered through
experience than defined in words.</p>

<p>Writers dealing with the soul in its subtler and more recondite
operations, poets, dramatists, moralists, psychologists (even using
such fiction as <i>Adolphe</i>), religious or spiritual authors all
create round themselves a zone of respect of which we are soon
aware. The tone and gait of their very first sentence warn us at
once that here the <i>sturm und drang</i> method cannot be used.
Comprehension must take the place of mere intelligence, which means
sympathy, reverence, and no haste. A medievalist may know all that
can be known about the Cistercians, Vézelay, and plain-song, and
yet raise his eyebrows on hearing a less erudite person say that
some celestial antiphons to the Blessed Virgin or the mysterious
light under an arch joining two uneven vaults make him realize the
spiritual life of twelfth century monks. It takes multiform
experiences of musical or architectural enjoyment, added to a sense
of spiritual beauty, to understand a statement of such quality.</p>

<p>On the other hand the words in which it is expressed may enter
an intellect and stay there, fashioning and dilating it till they
are understood. A rhythm, an image, a thought, thus contained in a
few words, may be enough for a meditation which the incidents of
life may suspend but not interrupt. I have never forgotten, and
certainly I have never exhausted, one verse of a ballad I once
heard a few poor children singing over and over outside my
window.</p>

<p class="poem"><i>Un jour l'amour nous blesse.</i></p>

<p>These children's voices were careless and mocking like life
itself, yet there was a touch of compassion in their insistence on
the longs in the iambs which once in the ear would not go out of
the soul. Of course there is an abyss between the human language
conveying mere information and poetry of this kind. In order to be
fully understood poetry has to be re-thought and felt over again,
and this cannot be done by any mind without something personal
being added to what we are pondering. When technicians speak of
"Creative Criticism?" they mean this reconstruction of a great
thought. Creative criticism ranks with the highest kind of
literature and with the higher kind of thought which we are to
study in Part IV.</p>

<h4>e) COMPREHENDING AND CRITICAL READING</h4>
<p>Whatever we read we must first comprehend and, when we have
comprehended, criticise.</p>

<p>Comprehension is the first and essential step in reading, but a
vast majority of readers do not care to take it. They understand or
think they understand what is obvious: the rest they regard as a
mistake or a freak of the writer. I once tried a number of readers
with that passage in <i>Aurora Leigh</i> in which Mrs. Browning
defines philosophy as "sympathy with God" (II, 293). Only one of
them seemed to think there was anything arresting in this phrase.
The others visibly were carried away by the rhythm or dazzled by
the superficial abstraction of the passage. When invited to fix
their attention on this "sympathy with God," most of them first
said it was farfetched but perfectly intelligible. But, being asked
what these perfectly intelligible words meant, they had to admit
they could not tell, and only two or three wished to hear. None
ventured on any conjecture or tried to hit upon one. Their attitude
was the uneducated one implying that if people use any except
everyday language, they ought not to hope to be understood.</p>

<p>There is an abyss between people who want a poem to be as
accessible as the morning paper and people in possession, or in
search of, culture. Scholars often spend years over a retrieved
fragment of a lost writer and read into it or infer from it the
most interesting information. I have seen Angellier refuse after an
hour's effort to give up an obscure passage of Herbert and succeed
in making it appear laden with meaning yet clear to minds used to
the rich language of poetry or philosophy. Certainly the habit of
French <i>lycée</i> professors to devote a whole two hours to
twenty lines of Seneca is first-rate intellectual training. Foreign
visitors who, at first, wonder at this method ultimately appreciate
it, and boys or girls compelled to use it are never slow in
recognizing its merits. If you happen to know two languages, try
your hand at really intelligent and artistic translation, were it
only of four lines every day. The habit of complete comprehension
will be a magnificent reward.</p>

<p>Too slow, you say, and too hard. But are we not endeavoring to
think?</p>

<p>Criticizing is only another aspect of the effort to comprehend.
The word in its etymology means "to judge," and in fact we think of
a critic as a competent, not a carping, judge. The capacity to
resist oral or printed affirmations, to have one's own opinion
about an idea, a poem, a doctrine or a work of art, and to see it
clearly enough to give it forcible expression is an exception. Most
people suspend their judgment till somebody else has expressed his
own and then they repeat it. Common parlance alludes to this
weakness in the frequently heard phrase: PEOPLE DO NOT THINK. These
four words describe the mental cowardice or sluggishness which
makes sheep of most people. Such passivity cannot be too early
counteracted. If it is done methodically and intelligently it will
never produce over-confidence, only the youthful mind will acquire
strength during the all-important formative period.</p>

<p>Teachers should attach the greatest value to the school exercise
called literary analysis. The student is placed face to face with a
literary piece worth while and examines its construction. This
means reading and reading it over again, grasping the main idea
which gave it birth, and observing how this idea is sustained
throughout its development. The first time a boy or girl does this
without any school preoccupation and realizes that a moderate
amount of attention is enough to accomplish it he becomes an adult
at once. Many remember the wonderful sensation of unexpected growth
ever after. History, the estimation of a great period or of a
famous man, the progress or regress of nations can give a teacher
even a better-chance than literature, more remote from the
student's early experience of life. Testing a proverb or an opinion
generally supposed to be right is equally useful.</p>

<p>The student must acquire the habit&mdash;which both Descartes
and Schopenhauer regard as the fundamental philosophical
attitude&mdash;not to receive anything as true or beautiful, but to
consider everything <i>as a problem</i>. Mr. Chesterton also
advises us to look at familiar objects till they seem strange, that
is to say till we actually see them, instead of being suggested how
to see them. Probably he remembers an experience which few people
have not had. We are in the train or riding in a motor-car. The
landscape, especially by moonlight, is unfamiliar and we note its
characteristics with the interest of novelty. Suddenly some objects
makes us realize that we have been mistaken, the section in our
vision was perfectly familiar: we have only been deceived by the
idea that we were elsewhere. At once, hills, trees and cottages
shrink to a smaller size and we look at them with the contempt of
habit. Our whole outlook on life and thought is vitiated in that
way till we devote time enough and energy enough to a reexamination
of things as they are.</p>

<p>We should be given the habit of critical attention so that our
first contact with anything worth the effort will give us as keen
an impression as we are capable of. Do you not remember hearing the
name of some foreign writer, Gorki, for instance, mentioned by
friends long before you had an opportunity to read any of his
writings? Your desire became keener in consequence. One day you
chanced, in a magazine, on a fragment of the writer's diary, twenty
pages on the return of Spring, with a beautiful narrative of a
child's death, and an old bishop's visit. Each sentence, each word
impressed, because of the intensity of your wish to make the most
of these short twenty pages; there was, over the whole chapter, a
mysterious charm like that of music or perhaps, perfumes. For a
long time you refused to read anything else of Gorki's, fearing to
break the spell and cherishing this chapter like a talisman. You
realized that people who had read every volume of Gorki did not
<i>possess</i> him as you did.</p>

<p>Criticism, when we read, think or feel in that way, is sure to
be what it ought always to be, viz. the balance of what we should
bow to with what we feel doubtful 01. We do not insult great
writers or great thinkers by submitting them to this test, but the
reverse. Have you ever seen a painter, a real artist, watch in a
gallery the masterpieces of his craft? What a difference between
him and the effusive crowd elbowing him. His eyes, as he takes in
detail after detail, have the hardness customary to a painter's
glance; nothing escapes them. But suddenly the artist shuts his
eyes and you know he is striving to project himself, so to speak,
into the perfect picture. Do not be afraid to let a student
accustomed to Shakespeare demur at calling Racine (who first wrote
his plays in prose) a poet, if further examination makes him
realize the perfection of the French dramatist as a painter of the
passions.</p>

<p>Comprehension is criticism, and criticism or judgment is a mere
synonym for thought.</p>

<h4>f) HOW TO READ THE NEWSPAPER</h4>
<p>Some people treat the newspaper with absurd respect, reading it
through as if every syllable mattered. Others speak of it with
contempt: "There never is anything in the newspaper: you waste time
reading it." Others again&mdash;few in number&mdash;armed with a
red pencil and big scissors sit beside a pile of newspapers which
they treat unceremoniously indeed. Half the sheets are flung aside
while the rest are eagerly but quickly gone over, the red pencil
every now and then zig-zagging through a column. In less than an
hour the seven or eight newspapers have been gone through and the
red-marked pages alone strew the table, sofa and piano. Then the
big scissors come into play. In a few minutes the clippings are
heaped up apart, a neat little sheaf, while the litter of crumpled
sheets is kicked aside till the maid can attend to it. Then the
reader will be seen slowly going over his clippings, thinking.
Nothing can look more different from the ordinary newspaper
reader's expression than this pensive brow. A few moments
afterwards the clippings will have disappeared, carefully tucked
away in various dossiers.</p>

<p>You may see the same man again later in the day, thoughtful and
absorbed. His mind is running over the things he has read in the
morning. You may meet him again in the evening. A circle of
interested but silent listeners surround him. He is an unaffected,
lucid and forcible speaker. Every now and then somebody asks him a
question, one of those questions which causes everybody else to
wish they could answer it. He does so, in a clear way, bringing in
facts which you remember catching a glimpse of in the morning
paper, but which you thought immaterial, whereas on his lips they
actually give you the key to developments of vast importance: "This
man thinks," you say to yourself.</p>

<p>What helps him to think? Simply taking the daily newspaper for
what it really is: a page of history. Look for history in those
ill-written sheets, you will think the thoughts of history; look
for society, business or sporting news, you will talk the language
of the tea-table, the stock-market or the field, but you will not
think.</p>

<p>"<i>I see. You advise us to treat the newspaper as a
school-book</i>."</p>

<p>Precisely. Few schoolbooks can sum up as many events of
world-wide importance as those which day after day have filled the
newspapers since 1914. There never were such political dramas as
those we can now follow. After Europe slowly regaining its balance,
Asia is giving us a spectacular lesson. Meanwhile America,
compelled by necessities of all sorts, is slowly being driven to
the forefront from which she has long been shrinking. Other ages
have taken generations to produce the mutations we can see in a
year. Indeed the newspaper is richer than any textbooks, and blind
indeed must be the people who daily glance at it without realizing
that if the quality of our thought depends upon that of the images
we garner in, here is an incomparable chance. But blind are indeed
most people, for the so-called wise and the foolish agree in
speaking contemptuously of what they all read unintelligently.</p>

<p>The two foregoing sections have been an effort to describe:</p>

<p>1&mdash;The preparation of our lives and minds for higher kind
of images.</p>

<p>2&mdash;The storing in of those images.</p>

<p>We now come to:</p>

<p>3&mdash;The elaboration of these acquisitions in the mind.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-3-09" id="ch-3-09"></a>Chapter Nine. Elaboration of
Data in the Mind</h3>
<h4>a) GOING OVER OUR KNOWLEDGE</h4>
<p>The son of the famous French painter Cazin, himself an artist of
note, once told me that his father used to take him on professional
rambles through the country. Every now and then the two men would
stop for a few moments, sometimes only one minute; then, turning
their backs on the landscape, they tested each other's recollection
of the values registered during this brief interval. The older
man's capacity for taking in and remembering was extraordinary.
Sometimes he could, after months, prove that half-tints
indistinguishable to the average vision were still clear in his
memory. Cazin had learned this practice from Lecoq de Boisbaudran,
who taught it to many other artists, Rodin among the number.</p>

<p>What artists do with color values we all can do with ordinary
data. The test, or the thought of the test, makes our mental energy
tenfold. Maroncelli, in his additions to Silvio Pellico's <i>Mie
Prigioni</i>, relates how Pellico and himself, being deprived of
books, pen and paper during the early months of their captivity,
easily managed to give food to their minds. They would, sometimes
singly, sometimes together, go over what they remembered, one day
about history, another day about literature, another day again
about philosophy. Supplementing each other it was surprising how
much more they could remember than they had imagined. Gradually
their knowledge, from being a useless chaos, became orderly and
ready. Their minds simultaneously grew freer. They could, without
pen and ink, compose long poems some of which lived exclusively in
their creators' minds till at last freedom came. It is easy to
infer from Maroncelli's words that the two men thrown back on
primitive methods, no doubt also helped by that exaltation of
primitive sentiments which prisoners in the Bolshevik gaols have
similarly recorded, were nearer to their souls and in fuller
possession of their powers than they had ever been.</p>

<p>We all can go through the same process, and no practice can
occupy empty hours or half-hours to better advantage. The curious
admixture of yearning and antipathy with which most of us think of
what we have learned at school comes almost invariably from one
cause. When we left school we felt near knowledge, which was a joy,
but since then we have seldom found that we were any nearer to it,
and the consciousness of this creates a phantasm with the usual
impression of inferiority. Let any chance offer to complete what
never was entirely achieved and the inferiority complex is promptly
exorcised, and we experience exhilaration. Many a parent helping a
child with his <i>Caesar</i> has been delighted to find, and easily
enjoy, elegance where it had been merely glimpsed many years
before. Should <i>Caesar</i> have been read over again at college
the result would have been the same, but <i>Caesar</i> was not read
at college: good-bye was said to it at school, and it was left as
an embryo of pleasure till an unexpected chance occurred. The same
can be said of practically all that we have learned or skimmed
through at school.</p>

<p>Go mentally over what you remember, completing it, when
necessary, by a few minutes' reading at home and you will promptly
know what education means. Was there no book by which you were
especially impressed at the period of life&mdash;when impressions
were deepest because there were so few? Is there not a poem you
remember hearing or learning and which, since that time, has
remained in your memory as the embodiment of poetry? Has there been
none since? I once saw a man take out of his pocketbook a neatly
folded clipping: it was a poem from one of the magazines which this
gentleman carried with him like a talisman. There must be some
poems that you too never can forget. When you have a few minutes
shut your eyes and enjoy one of them as you may enjoy any dear
memory. Many a drab hour in the train, at an uninteresting hotel,
or on shipboard, has been brightened up by this habit as a room is
by a bouquet.</p>

<p>In the same way, we all remember moments, happy crises which
were the peaks in our mental life, introducing strength where
weakness used to prevail, or calmness where there had been no rest.
We can recapture the feeling of those moments. When it inters our
soul every fibre in us vibrates again as champagne sparkles to the
touch of a crumb. We imagined we were merely going over a
chronology of our own actions, and suddenly we find ourselves in
the productive portion of our personality.</p>

<p>We can also be profitably occupied with the recollection of past
travelling that is worth remembering. People nowadays travel too
much and too early. One nail drives out the other, and you hear
philosophers of thirteen state the fact with perfect indifference.
Apparently less lucky people are more fortunate. Charlotte Brontë,
born within fifty miles of the sea, saw it for the first time when
she was twenty-four, but the sight overwhelmed her, and a year
later she would allude to the experience as another might allude to
first love. There is something exquisite in remembering our first
consciousness of being abroad, hearing a mysterious language,
feeling far away, a little less confident, and a little lost. The
first thing that an Umbrian town, a pine-surrounded cove in the
Mediterranean, or the Arizona desert, first seen in the solemn
dawn, told us ought never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Artistic beauty should also be cherished. Why count the impacts
of the track and calculate the speed of the train when we could
have a perfect half hour remembering a room or two in the Louvre?
With a little practice you can conjure up the <i>Venus de Milo</i>
or the <i>Wedding of Saint Catherine</i> clearly enough to feel
once more the fringe of impression which these works of art have
left on you. Give yourself a little time, and the serenity of
Greece or the luminous grace of Italy will be felt in turn. Without
any effort you will not merely be going through a mental exercise
but reaching the condition in which a Ruskin writes about art.</p>

<p>Great lives or great deeds can people any solitude. The lives of
the Saints, above all, the life of Christ, have filled the
existence of thousands of thinkers. French spiritual writers when
describing this meditation use a remarkable phrase: <i>s'entretenir
de la vie des Saints</i>, which means both carrying on a dialogue
with one's self about those noble souls and keeping one's self
alive by it. No word could be of a richer or more accurate
psychology.</p>

<p>The ancients realized the virtue of this practice. Remember that
Plutarch, who did more than anybody else, before the Christian
writers, to make it popular, was a priest and a moralist, and his
stories were the illustration of his doctrine. The passion for
history which characterized the classical ages, and only decreased
when artists took precedence over great doers of deeds, was fed by
the admiration of exceptional individuals rather than by sheer
interest in politics. In her charming memoirs Madame Campan says
that Madame Louise, the youngest daughter of Louis XV, kept her
busy during several months, reading out to her the history of
France, because she wanted to have heard it through before joining
the Carmelite nuns. When she adds "only one heroic action was
possible for this princess and she did it," we realize that the
examples of nobility gathered from that course of reading reacted
on the resolution of this rare King's daughter. Anybody interested
in the men and women without whom there would be no history, but
only insipid uniformity, knows that, dead as they are, there is
more life in them than in the automata we see walking around us.
Thinking about them would be the natural impulse of most of us if
the word highbrow or its synonyms were not terrifying a world of
sheep into conformity. Every one of the mental exercises I have
tried to describe has been not an effort but the most vitalizing
relaxation to whoever has given them a chance.</p>

<h4>b) REFLECTION</h4>
<p>This is what people generally call thinking. When a person is
neither speaking, writing, getting rid of some job, nor being
spoken to, if he is also not asleep he is supposed to be
thinking.</p>

<p>Reflecting is something more active. T said above that Madame de
Maintenon defines reflection as "thinking attentively of the same
thing several times over." This simplicity of language is
delightful and expresses what it means to convey quite as fully as
the scientific jargon made fashionable by the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>Certainly Madame de Maintenon's definition can be questioned,
for it seems to imply mere mention whereas various aspects of one
proposition are sure to appear to reflection, but it is accurate
inasmuch as it indicates the presence in the mind of one object
engrossing it.</p>

<p>We all know reflection, at first spontaneous, gradually more
deliberate and conscious. The moment a child is aware of fear or
attraction he revolves in his little head the means of escaping
from what is dreaded, or of securing what is wanted. This is done,
as usual, by the presentment of images or sets of images showing to
the mind pictures of what is likely to happen. Finally a sequence,
a whole scenario, seems more probable than its rivals, and the
intellect stops in its search after possibilities. This
interruption is what we call a decision, as the picture finally
retained sets our volitional powers in action. On the whole the
object of reflection is invariably the discovery of something
satisfying to the mind which was not there at the beginning of the
search. There is no fundamental difference between this discovery
and scientific invention. "How did you discover the law of
gravitation?" somebody once asked Newton. "By thinking about it all
the time," was the answer.</p>

<p>People are not often clear about this, because their best
thinking is done when they do not suppose they are thinking, and
consequently the successive phases of their thought can seldom be
reclaimed from the subconscious. But every time we succeed in
glimpsing the subconscious we do see the chain of images. Not
infrequently we get up in the morning clear about an issue which
appeared doubtful when we went to bed. If we can remember the last
set of images overnight, comparing it with the one we are now
satisfied with, we have no trouble in discovering the concatenation
of intermediary images.</p>

<p>So, reflection is a natural condition, but only in the
excitement produced by fear or desire. When this impulse is merely
superficial it produces imaginative reactions also too superficial
to be noted, which is our habitual mental state. If we have
acquired a taste for reflection, or, as we say, meditation, or if
some extraneous incentive makes us anxious to acquire it, we have
to fight off our inertness in order to think. The morning
meditation of pious people is a burden to them as long as it
depends on a book for its support and has not become personal, that
is to say, in plain English, egotistical. Otherwise we wait for the
book, or for some director, to do the required thinking for us.</p>

<p>Children ought to be put through regular thinking exercises at
school. The Montessori system arranges for intervals during which
the children veil their little faces and think. Madame de Maintenon
also recommended silent times, and the instruction I was referring
to above deals with the methods for turning them to the best
account. This experienced woman notes that the Saint-Cyr girls
insisted on being given the solution of all their
problems&mdash;even those set in play&mdash;and that "Please tell
us" was more frequently on their lips than "Let me think."</p>

<p>Ask a class of thirty what is their explanation of any little
subtlety interesting enough to fix their attention. Up will go most
hands. Shake your head and insist on the query being answered in
the copybook without any of the hubbub and excitement produced by
it; in a few moments you will see on the more intelligent faces a
smile meaning "I was going to talk like a fool and you knew it,"
whereas on the other faces you will see nothing at all. You will be
lucky if one scholar in the group does any thinking at all.</p>

<p>I have seen classes positively tortured by a practice which
however ought to be insisted on and the habit of which is soon
acquired. Give the scholars a Latin text just difficult enough for
them not to read it at sight&mdash;a pretty bit of Ovid, for
instance&mdash;and lay down the following terms:<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>1) Not a single word shall be written down for forty-five
minutes;</p>

<p>2) During the same period the dictionary shall not be consulted,
but the text will be studied, and puzzling phrases will be
scrutinized so as to make sense from the context;</p>

<p>3) At the end of the forty-five minutes the dictionary will be
allowed for eight minutes;</p>

<p>4) Only then, shall the translation be written down.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>I have never seen this method fail: it simply compels
reflection. But boyish minds are so averse to it that the trial at
first is an ordeal: the young fingers itch intolerably towards the
pencil and the dictionary, because the habit is to get rid of the
thing as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The average scholar hates the composition of an essay because
his past experiences have been anything but pleasant. He knows that
after writing a few lines there will be a vacuum created by the
necessity to write at all costs. If he were taught before his first
experience that not a word of an essay should be written down till
the whole of it is complete in the mind and <i>could be spoken in
simple but clear language</i>, he would never know this degrading
condition. Let him find by thinking out loud the subject in hand
that nothing is so fascinating as to make up one's mind about
something worth while, and that writing down the result of this
investigation is of no particular importance but is sure to be
easy, and the phantasm of an essay as a hopeless fight with vacuum
will disappear forever. You can as easily dispel the phantasm of
the superiority of books and of book-producers by pointing out that
a volume is nothing but a sequence of individual chapters thus
prepared, and that, as La Bruyere says, you can learn how to make a
book as you learn how to make a clock.</p>

<h4>c) WRITING AS A HELP TO THOUGHT</h4>
<p>The habit of using pen and ink in order to make up one's mind,
just described and already mentioned in the chapter dealing with
concentration, should be preserved through life. It is useful not
only as a help to reflection but as an important element in an
all-important inventory.</p>

<p>There are many questions which we regard as vital, yet about
which we are vague. God, immortality, the foundation of morals, the
nature and basis of happiness, love, marriage, the use of life,
education, literary or artistic principles, what do we know about
all these? So little that it is next to nothing. We have heard
these issues mentioned so often, we have mentioned them ourselves
in so many occurrences that we gradually acquire an idea that they
are familiar. But this is a mere fallacy, the same under which we
labor when, after long putting off our examination of a practical
issue&mdash;which however happens to be puzzling enough and serious
enough to haunt us&mdash;we finally come to a decision. We then
imagine that we have somehow been weighing the <i>pros</i> and
<i>cons</i> more than we realized, and we call our procrastination
the time we have taken to think. But as a matter of fact we have
not been thinking at all, we have only been wishing to think. If we
could add up the minutes we have devoted to a critical examination
of what we hold, say about a future life, we should be shocked at
the ridiculous sum. Thousands of allusions from ourselves or from
others to immortality do not make up a thought, they only mean that
immortality is an important problem which people cannot let alone.
I know a high ecclesiastical dignitary who has always wished but
always postponed studying his cathedral which is one of the famous
ones in Europe. Whenever I hear him say "my cathedral" I always
think: "No, you do not own that cathedral, the cathedral owns you."
So with those great questions of which we truly say that we are
possessed without daring to hint that we possess them.</p>

<p>There are in the daily press a number of writers, male and
female, who make it a point to have an opinion about everything.
Day after day, four or five hundred words from their pens appear in
which they express their views on an immense variety of subjects,
most of them interesting. An expert runs little risk of erring in
estimating how much time these fellow-writers of his have devoted
to each individual question. It can be counted in minutes rather
than in hours. The authors have seldom referred to any literature,
even to an encyclopaedia, they have been satisfied with summing up
their own flimsy knowledge of the data and their flimsier
impression of them. Yet, this is so much better than nothing that
we read the articles through.</p>

<p>It would be a great beginning if we too would do that, limiting
ourselves to recording what we know, what we are doubtful about,
and what we should like to know. It might be enough to place us on
the high road to knowledge, or, at any rate, understanding.
Seventeenth century people used to enter such meditations in a
copybook to which, from time to time, they would add fresh
information. Today we take some wrapper and put in it the note
which, like the parent crystal in a solution, may give solidity and
order to our thoughts on the subject. The results are
surprising.</p>

<p>Seventeenth century people also used their pens with similar
effect to make up their minds about living men and women. These
portraits were likely to be too elaborate, but they made
observation and criticalness a necessity, and some of them, written
by almost unknown people, have been valuable to the historian. Try
the method in the interest of your nearest friends, or in
self-defence, or from mere curiosity, and you will soon be
conscious of an insight into your neighbors' souls which years of
passivity had never given you.</p>

<p>Does it follow that professional writers stand the best chance
of thinking their best? Not necessarily. I said, in Part II, that
the professional writer is in danger of being a prey to many
phantasms. Controlled sensitiveness belongs only to the very
greatest. Average talent is constantly hampered by
over-sensitivness. The notion that one is writing for the public,
for criticalness and often for misinterpretation, produces ill
effects from which the person writing only to help his powers of
concentration is free. But this inevitable drawback is compensated
by the vitalizing influence of composition. Even a mere journalist,
if he is worth his ink, will often begin an article solely because
he has to write it, but, in a few minutes, will enjoy the work
because it sets his faculties free and gives them unexpected play.
The mind is an enchanted spot where you are sure to be visited by
fascinating apparitions as the nightly fisher on a marsh is sure to
see will o' the wisps.</p>

<p>This is not all. There is no good or even passable writing,
without some sort of outline destined to guide the pen. While
producing these sketches, entirely similar to the preparatory work
of an artist, the writer thinks no longer for his readers but for
himself and is sure to produce of his best.</p>

<p>There is a time in life when the writer is independent of his
reader, whose approval he does not doubt, as well as of his
predecessors whom he regards only as precursors, and when he can
sweep aside the most dangerous phantasms with a mere thrust of his
pen. Fortunate are the writers who, like Byron, Shelley, Barrès,
and a number of the philosophers, began to publish their thoughts
when still in their teens or barely out of their teens. Those are
not tormented by the phantasm that "all has been said." All the
great commonplaces which go on intriguing the world, as they
intrigue children, seem to them novelties which nobody has as yet
looked in the face as they do. <i>Pereant qui ante nos nostra
dixerunt!</i> Whatever they think seems to them worthy of
expression and even of publication. And they are largely right,
since no two musicians can ever play the same piece identically. As
they proceed in life their youthful thoughts solidified in print
surround them like a bodyguard and protect them against doubts or
diffidence. A man like Barrès who was only separated from timidity
by exceeding confidence might have consumed his powers in irony if
he had not begun at nineteen to regard all his thoughts as
poetry.</p>

<h4>d) PRESERVING ONE'S THOUGHTS</h4>
<p>To keep no track of what one learns or thinks is as foolish as
to till and seed one's land with great pains, and when the harvest
is ripe turn one's back upon it and think of it no more.</p>

<p>Some people have extraordinarily retentive memories and can do
with a minimum of notes, but phenomenal exceptions do not count.
Most men who have made a name in literature, politics or business
have found it necessary to have a paper memory and those who have
thought it possible to dispense with the drudgery of forming such a
one have inevitably some day rued it. For humorists who define
memory as the faculty enabling us to forget only emphasize an
unfortunate truth. Striking or vivid impressions which we imagine
can never be effaced from our consciousness do not survive in it
more than a few weeks, sometimes a few days, unless something is
done to give them permanence. A busy life teaches even congenital
idleness to do that. Anybody whom his fate compels to use his brain
actively soon realizes that he cannot afford to lose any of his
resources, and he devises some plan for stopping waste. If he is
rich enough he buys the assistance of a trained secretary. If not,
he reads the books in which the methods of erudition or those of
business (they are almost alike) are expounded, or he invents
devices of his own. We marvel at the immense knowledge which some
writers possess of what used to be called foreign politics but
should be called at present the politics of us all. We wonder at
the enormousness of the archives they must keep and at the
difficulty for even them to find their way through that mass of
papers. As a matter of fact, folio volumes of coarse paper on which
clippings from the newspapers can be glued according to some happy
combination of the vertical and the horizontal are all that is
necessary. Red ink annotations will provide indication of richer
dossiers. The secret is to clip all that seems important <i>at
once</i>. Newspapers are historical documents prepared by men and
women generally ignorant of, and indifferent to, history. An
occurrence of far-reaching consequence may be mentioned in an
inconspicuous column and in unemphatic type by so-called
specialists who do not realize its importance and will never allude
to it again. If the passage is not filed at once its absence may
mean the loss of a capital link in the chain of events.</p>

<p>Facts are only the material for thought. Thoughts themselves,
that is to say, the illumination produced in our mind by the
presence of rich facts, should be preserved even more carefully.
Certainly it is difficult and sometimes it may be
dangerous&mdash;for it stops the working of the mind&mdash;to
interrupt an intellectual reaction under pretence of noting it. But
while the final result of mediation is before us we can rescue it
from the fate of all dreams. The note must be brief enough to
preclude the danger of what the Veda calls "putting words between
the truth and ourselves," but it must be full enough to be clear to
future, i.e., almost alien, re-reading. If we are conscious of an
impulse to give a final form to an idea engrossing our mind it is
foolish to resist or defer it. The best pages of a book are those
written at a stretch under such an impulse. Many a writer compelled
by life to do his work in spite of adverse circumstances has been
grateful to himself for not giving in to laziness when the chance
of thus fixing a glimpse or even a glimmer offered itself. He does
not know the haunting and torturing phantasm that once his view of
an object was higher and clearer than it is now.</p>

<p>Book-writing is the province of specialists, living is the
business of us all. Moral life, sentimental life, religious life,
whatever is above the <i>terre à terre</i> of mere existing, also
consists of illuminations which once departed return no more. A
diary, a few old letters, a few sheets containing thoughts or
meditations, may keep up the connection between us today and our
better selves of the past. I was deeply impressed as a youth by the
advice of a spiritual writer to read one's own spiritual notes
preferably to even famous works. All saints seem to have done so.
The moment we realize that any thought, ours or borrowed, is
pregnant enough not to be wasted, or original enough not to be
likely to come back again, we must fix it on paper. Our manuscripts
should mirror our reading, our meditations, our ideals, and our
approach to it in our lives. Anybody who has early taken the habit
to record himself in that way knows that the loss of his papers
would also mean a loss to his thinking possibilities.</p>

<h4>e) TYPE OF MIND PRODUCED BY THIS INTELLECTUAL DISCIPLINE</h4>
<p>I have known personally a great many men whose mental
development has helped me materially in writing this book. Two of
them have impressed me more than the rest for reasons which the
reader will be told hereafter.</p>

<p>One of these men is a contributor to a famous magazine, a writer
universally known for his knowledge of world politics and his
<i>exposés</i> of them. His rich and luminous articles are eagerly
expected by people interested in Eastern questions who have not had
the same opportunities to go personally into them. They are
discussed with respect by all specialists and, on more than one
occasion, I have seen his views influence the attitudes of
statesmen quite strongly.</p>

<p>The other man is a historian of religions. To tackle the history
of religions with reverence and yet with independence, to secure a
hearing on these questions from liberal critics without forfeiting
the respect of conservatives, is a rare and difficult achievement.
This theologian has accomplished it: the few scores of specialists
who are interested in the same field show by their tone in
discussing his views that they regard them as the outcome of a
sincere wish to prefer the truth to opinion.</p>

<p>I have known these two distinguished men from the days of our
youth, and to tell the startling but instructive truth, both of
them used to strike me in those faraway days not as distinguished,
but as rather the reverse. To use plain parlance, they were
ordinary. To be sure, they exhibited the qualities of the
plodder&mdash;what obituary notices call indomitable
energy&mdash;and nobody ever dreamed of denying them more than
their share of common sense. Also they had that peculiar sort of
ambition not easily discernible from a taste for distinction which
ultimately must raise a man above his original triviality. But
their innate characteristics were ordinary. When I meet them, even
now, my first impression is still an uncomfortable feeling that
they may ruin the fabric of my respect for them by saying something
irreconcilable with the high opinion we all entertain of what they
write. They never do, yet I am never quite satisfied that they will
never do it. Sometimes, I notice a smile, sometimes a tone of
voice, sometimes a turn of phrasing which makes me feel on the
brink of the abyss. But nothing happens, and I never knew anybody
not familiar with these men from boyhood who was the least inclined
to feel as I do. Nobody speaks of them as geniuses, but practically
everybody regards them as a credit to serious literature. I know
that their original angle was narrow, yet they show a constant
interest in the higher issues, and when they do astonish a little
it is by a too explicit aversion for trivialities. Their erudition
is boundless. Visibly, they were born with excellent memories and
stocked them with innumerable data ranging from philosophical views
to mere human or picturesque details. I admit there never is
anything unexpectedly piercing in what they say, but they know
their own minds on a vast range of issues. They have come in
contact with so many theories and have read so many discussions of
them that arguments do not surprise or stagger them. Their arsenal
is full of facts which the arguments have to take into
consideration, or of counter-theories to qualify them. If all this
were not couched in language from which all freshness is absent it
would sound like the natural welling of powerful minds. For, there
is a light radiating from all the hard facts they handle, and the
illumination is enough to silence our inward reservations.</p>

<p>These men are the living demonstration that helps to thought, as
expounded in the previous chapters, produce something so like
thought as to be indiscernible from it, at all events enable a man
to think his best instead of thinking his easiest. They were
ambitious and hard-working, they substituted the pleasures of the
intellect for what people call pleasure, they preferred the nobler
issues to the less noble ones, and they chose to study methods.
They are rewarded not only by the esteem of their peers, or by
their subtle influence on events, but by the consciousness of
possessing rare intellectual health and of using their powers with
a minimum of waste. This result is well worth the initial effort of
preferring something to nothing and of renouncing the universal
vacuum.</p>

<p>More than once I have had opportunities to contrast these men
with others, far their superiors in talent, whom I used to regard
as predestined to brilliant careers. But the careers have been
spoiled at the start and the rare faculties have dwindled to
superficiality. Society, of course, is full of those failures which
it seems naturally to prepare, but you will find them even in
careers which apparently are their negation. Many promising young
professors, physicians or lawyers have disappointed expectation and
finally created disgust simply because they have accumulated
obstacles instead of helps on the path of then-thought.</p>

<p>What has been lacking? A taste for good books. These men have
preferred light conversation, cards, or the idleness of the country
club to what they were apparently born to love, and they have
deteriorated in consequence. Saint-Simon shows us a gallery of such
failures described with ruthless brilliance, but we need only look
around us to see the living replicas of them.</p>

<p>You will say: knowledge, information are not the same thing as
thought, and the art of educating one's self cannot be the Art of
Thinking. Certainly not in the case of genius. But providing one's
mind with the best food and with the best hygiene surely is the
only way for average faculties riot to nullify themselves. Take
away data,&mdash;and darkness will replace brilliant spots. Do we
not say that God KNOWS everything, instead of saying that He
understands everything? Imagine the difference in intellects like
Malebranche's or Rousseau's if they had been less satisfied with
their own phosphorescence and more eager for legitimate working.
And who can doubt that the difference between such an age as the
seventeenth century, all serenity, and our own, all nervousness,
arises chiefly from the equipment of the former period? What gives
cynical Frenchmen that strange political naiveness, at which
foreigners marvel, if not a lack of information? What made Bossuet,
a genius, inferior in controversy to Richard Simon, a mere scholar,
if not disparity in knowledge of biblical questions? No amount of
genius will replace facts where facts, and not genius, are
necessary. On the other hand, complete mastery on the data of a
question will give a man beside thoroughness that rapidity of
argument which we cannot help calling brilliant thinking though, in
reality, it is only information.</p>

<h4>f) FURTHER APPROXIMATION TO ORIGINAL THOUGHT</h4>
<p>I have purposely chosen, to illustrate the value of the methods
suggested in this Part III, two average specimens raised above
their apparent possibilities by self-imposed training. But the same
training applied to real talents produces results which fill the
historians of literature. No better type can be chosen to represent
these than Ernest Renan.</p>

<p>Renan, we all realize, was not a genius. Neither as a
philosopher, a scholar, or a writer can he be compared with truly
superior men. Yet, what intelligence! What insight and what
outsight! What an introduction such a book as <i>Marc-Aurèle</i> is
to an intelligent reading of history! The transformation of the
meaning of the world "intelligent" and the halo that has
simultaneously attached to it date from Renan. When M. Lanson
writes of Victor Hugo that it is pitiful to realize that such a
genius was not intelligent we know at once where the critic found
the nuance he is so daringly emphasizing. Renan, more than men of
greater power, remains the type of the capacity for comprehending.
A host of disciples&mdash;among whom Anatole France and Jules
Lemaitre are the best known,&mdash;have shown how easily the method
can be learnt and how certain its results must be.</p>

<p>1. Whoever has read the best books&mdash;not exclusively the
classics, but the critics and scientists of the past two
generations&mdash;has acquired not only information but a method of
thinking. Intelligence is as contagious as gracefulness and wit
used to be in the eighteenth century. This is not all. Taine used
to say that thought is a collective, not an individual process.
When we speak of "the mind in the making" we mean the same thing:
doctrines are tested and developed, methods are improved, views are
completed, the work of the whole world becomes the property of each
individual seeker who cares to annex its results. In one word the
volume of thought is growing.</p>

<p>2. Educated men who thus absorb the results of collective
efforts are constantly made to see relations between ideas or
between facts, and they take the habit of looking for such
relations themselves. A modern man cannot think of Mussolini
without thinking also of Napoleon; France after 1871 helps him to
understand certain aspects of the German mentality after 1919; the
colonizing methods of Britain throw light on those of Rome and
conversely. Renan does this on every page. His nimble mind is
everlastingly traveling over lists of data which he juxtaposes or,
on the contrary, opposes and this active treatment of them produces
light at every step. Signor Ferrero's habit of visualizing the
present in the past and constantly suggesting the process by his
choice of words shows the same method. It is indeed the method of
all modern historians, and it cannot be denied that the results are
immeasurably superior to the purely narrative method of former
writers.</p>

<p>3. This habit of never seeing a thing without visualizing
another beside it, or behind it, has in it something vital which
makes it akin to the methods of the dramatist. Receptivity and
imagination are constantly called into play. Many cultivated men
and women spend delightful hours resurrecting the past,
reconstructing a great historical fact, hearing a great historical
character talk, testing a philosophy by its probable practical
results, or imagining the future. All the time creative imagination
is at work.</p>

<p>What is that, if it is not THOUGHT, and yet, it is within the
possibility of innumerable people. Let them keep away from
trivialities, and, instead, stock their minds with knowledge worth
while; let them range freely through this mass of data, and thought
will be actively produced.</p>

<p><i>"What a shame; there is such a lot in these chapters that I
like: solitude, Spinoza, music, exhilaration and elevation, methods
for not forgetting any more, a sort of easy way of making life,
why, yes, of making life useful as well as beautiful. Yet, I am
disappointed. Shall I tell you the truth? I honestly thought that
this Part III would give me a real recipe for thinking. I mean some
quick way of making my intellect active and fascinating, a Coue
method of doing it all at a moment's notice...</i></p>

<p>"Or tabloids. Yes, it is a shame that thought-lozenges do not
exist. I should buy some too. Well, can't you take strong tea, and
lie down, as section a of chapter I says and see if your problems
will not simplify themselves? Or, can't you sail for Italy and
never open your mouth till you sight Naples? Nothing can be easier
and it does the trick, the book says."</p>

<p><i>"Oh, yes, but it does not. What does it are good books, and
reading only masterpieces, and never reading, always studying, in
short, a regular mental Battle Creek treatment which I know I can
no more submit to than to the real one. Yet, I know that if I
should go over these chapters |: again, I should hit upon dozens of
things which, as I read on, I have been longing to do. I love the
Julius Caesar little girl, and I abhor 'tits details, always did, I
think, for if I were really frivolous I should not be reading this
tantalizing stuff. Only, how I wish things could be as easy as they
sometimes seem!"</i></p>

<p>"You hate <i>'tits détails</i>, that is to say, commonness and
obviousness, and you love solitude, Spinoza, Carthusian monks in
white cells, good books which nobody else will read, Roman history
and rare little girls, music and philosophy and sober enthusiasm.
All this means that you are a perfect reader for this kind of book,
an exceptional candidate for real thinking. What you object to is
mental hygiene, adding up intellectual calories, and so forth, is
it not?"</p>

<p><i>"Exactly. You describe it all as if you felt as I do. Yes,
hygiene is hateful. Give me ten surgeons instead of one dietist. I
am ready to strike the bargain, chloroform and all."</i></p>

<p>"No, you do not hate hygiene. I see you riding that grey mare
every Tuesday. What you are afraid of is only the accumulation, the
avalanche of restricting advice. In fact, what you seem to enjoy in
this book is advice. You treasure each counsel as it comes, but
when you try to remember the hundreds of them, down they come upon
you like a landslide. Well, suppose you take one at a time, and for
a while forget the rest. Suppose you begin with reading the
<i>Times</i> as a page of history and..."</p>

<p><i>"Oh yes, I'll do that. I am sure I can do that. Don't tell me
any more, and do not tell anybody else. I want to see how it will
work with me."</i></p>

<p>"Work! You certainly do not doubt that wisdom works. So give the
<i>Times</i> a chance, and please, henceforth, only read one
chapter of this book at a time. The tabloid idea lies there."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-4" id="ch-4"></a>PART FOUR. CREATIVE THOUGHT</h2>
<h4>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h4>
<p><i>Does "creative thought" mean genius? Yes, but remember that
any creation, of any description, by the humblest artisan as well
as by a superman, is the product of a state of mind which ought to
be called genius.</i></p>

<p><i>Does it mean literary creation? Not any more than any other,
and the reader ought not to infer from a paragraph or two in
section 5 of this Part IV that the following pages are intended
chiefly for writers. No mistake would lead more fatally to
misunderstanding of the aim of this book. Its real object is to
make thought, even in its highest forms, and in any realm,
accessible to all of us.</i></p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-4-10" id="ch-4-10"></a>Chapter Ten. Creation</h3>
<p>THIS IS A FASCINATING WORD. The notion of producing something
out of nothing, or of substituting motion for immobility delights
even children. There had been many half-draped statues of Venus
before the <i>Venus de Milo</i>, but none producing such a powerful
spiritual effect with just stone: we see it, and instantaneously we
realize that a superior agency has been at work. Thousands of men
have looked up wistfully at a vanishing lark; only Shelley wrote an
immortal ode to it. Again, music worth the name means a wonderful
creation. Our soul was vacant, and here it is filled with images
and emotions produced by the most immaterial means. When we try to
think of the Deity we soon discard infinity and eternity, as
oppressive for our imagination, but creativeness we ponder on
without any effort.</p>

<p>The reverence, frequently the awe we experience in the presence
of genius, arises from the similarity between its gift and that
attribute of the Godhead. We are constantly tempted to exaggerate
our inferiority. We look at the busts of the great musicians or of
the great philosophers; we notice the powerful brows, the searching
eyes; we glance at our mirror and the consciousness of belonging to
another race weighs us down. We read the lives or the letters of
these exceptional men; we are not surprised to see them saying
about themselves things which we should be ridiculous even to think
about ourselves.</p>

<p>It is a good thing to read what has been written about genius
and geniuses: their lives, full of splendid but thwarted efforts,
act upon our minds as the lives of the saints act upon our
spiritual faculties. We feel a sort of pride in them which
testifies to our common origin and adds fresh vitality to our
nobler desires. The presence of superior men is also a unique
tonic. But it is futile to hope for an explanation of their gift;
they are superior because they are superior, that is all. If you
ask them how they are that, the answer will only be the laughter of
Rabelais, and you will feel smaller than ever.</p>

<p>It is also dangerous to place these men on a pedestal and to
adore a depressing phantasm in their shape. Literary men, poets,
dramatists and artists of all sorts have been overestimated since
one of them, Diderot, turned the whole capacity of a powerful mind
to the exaltation of their gift. It has not been good for a man
like Victor Hugo, or, above all, for a man like Alexander Dumas, to
be made the prophet of his generation. A phantasm, stronger even
than they were, was created which compelled them to fall into
attitudes.</p>

<p>Too often we forget that genius, too, depends upon the data
within its reach, that even Archimedes could not have devised
Edison's inventions. We also forget that genius is not genius all
the time, although it is superior all the time. There were long
intervals between Pasteur's major illuminations. Poets know
inspiration, but they also know periods of aridity during which
they live on hope, or faith, and memory. On the other hand, we
jnirnbler people, have our intuitions, our times for feeling on the
crest of the wave, for thinking our best and doing our best. Let us
foolishly imagine, while we are so favored, that our gift, after
all, is not of the first quality, and the spell will be broken in
an instant.</p>

<p>The partiality&mdash;to which I have just referred&mdash;of the
eighteenth century for purely intellectual superiority has had
baneful effects, especially in France. Voltaire and Diderot had no
respect for genius when incarnated in founders of religions and
there are still too many people who prefer brilliance to goodness.
Political or social reformers, diffusers of knowledge, great
organizers in any domain; apostles and missionaries, captains of
industry, the upbuilders of mighty fortunes, great generals or
great sailors, are treated rather contemptuously by critics and
pedants, though their mental gift is often as rare, and the
intensity of their physiognomy is as striking as the gifts and the
commanding foreheads of their rivals. Their creations are before
us, and many of them will be mentioned in history. But is there a
single community in the whole world in which there does not exist
the tangible proof that a keen wish for securing a noble result,
kept up through a lifetime of perseverance, must inevitably attain
its goal? Why should such efforts be regarded as inferior to
intellectual efforts, especially when, as is too often the case,
egotism is glaringly visible in these? Who would dare to say that
Florence Nightingale has not the same right to be regarded as a
creator as George Eliot?</p>

<p>We may go further. All human lives of any distinction, even if
no durable monument prolongs them, are creations, sometimes of an
artistic, sometimes of a moral nature. There are kind, thoughtful
men whose names will never be known to the world, but whose lives
appear as masterpieces to those who knew them well. Those men were
born with the faculties and the chances of us all, but they saw
what could be made of them and accomplished it. The diary of a
Joubert or the letters of a Cowper might never have been published,
but the people who loved Joubert or Cowper for more than there is
in their writings would be haunted to their dying day by the charm
emanating from those retiring existences. Madame Recamier has been
dead a hundred years, yet, more people stop in a reverie before her
picture than before that of Madame de Staël. She never wrote for
the public, she never orated or prophesied, but the life she led in
those three rooms at the Abbaye-aux-Bois is still an ideal for
innumerable women who have heard of it. Can we say that this
fascinating <i>aura</i> is not her own creation? And are not the
saints as magnetic as geniuses?</p>

<p>Compare these people who did things, or <i>were</i> the thing,
with those other people who never did anything and would have been
nothing but for a modest capacity for writing up what others were
doing. Which is the real creator, the person who creates
inspiration or the one who only receives it?</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-4-11" id="ch-4-11"></a>Chapter Eleven. The Root of
Creation: Ideas</h3>
<p>THE ROOT OF CREATION, whether speculative, artistic or practical
is, of course, an idea. Gradually this idea grows, annexing or
using its neighbors, and becomes a mastering purpose which cannot
be resisted. Finally it results in some creation. Taine falls in
love with a cat, gets fascinated by cats, treasures and cherishes
innumerable memories of the seductiveness of cats. When he looks
more the dried-up little old scholar than ever he produces the
famous sonnets on cats. Another man has watched a stray cat in the
streets: he has seen the poor little creature sometimes looking up
imploringly at an uncomprehending passenger, sometimes pretending
to itself that nothing is really happening and trotting along as if
surely home must be round the corner. The vision acts through
years. Another man might translate it into clumsy language, this
one speaks of it in tender words which go to one's heart. In time a
home for stray animals is the result.</p>

<p>Nothing can be simpler. Simplicity is the characteristic of all
creative notions. The two Frenchmen who had the greatest influence
on their countrymen during the latter part of the nineteenth
century and the early part of the twentieth were undoubtedly
Anatole France and Maurice Barrès. What acted on their minds before
the philosophies they evolved reacted in their turn on millions of
other minds? Anatole France looking at the starry sky was struck by
the insignificance of man with his ambitions and passions, of the
atom-Earth with its microscopic empires. Barrès, standing at his
father's grave in Charmes churchyard, while the bell was tolling
for Vespers and a solemnity was spreading over the village,
realized the continuity between his ancestors and himself, as well
as what he called the claims of the soil. Both visions filled the
two men's lives, and are still the souls of forty volumes, and have
influenced the thoughts of millions.</p>

<p>The problem obviously is how to have such soul-filling,
life-fashioning ideas.</p>

<p>Our soul is an ocean. Its possibilities, its receptivity and
elasticity are mysterious and seldom within our ken, but they
cannot be doubted. What it stores up during our life is as
mysterious, but it is as undoubtedly vast. Remember that the
Alsatian old woman was eighty when, during her last illness, she
began to talk Hebrew. It was sixty-five years since, as a little
maid in the village Rabbi's home, she had overheard the master
reading out <i>Genesis</i>. She was in the kitchen, she was not a
Jewess, she did not care a straw, and yet the whole series of
outlandish sounds had been preserved on one of the million records
in her memory. Who has not been amused or puzzled by the
reviviscence of an utterly indifferent sentence, heard years
before, caused by a few syllables bearing a faint resemblance to
it? The forgotten words fall on our ear, eerie but unmistakable. A
strain of music, the odor of mignonette will unexpectedly revive in
us states of mind from which, in childhood or adolescence, we shook
ourselves free because their vague pregnancy made them as hard to
sustain as their poignancy made them exquisite. Inspiration, the
high-strung condition in which emotion, eloquence, music, or merely
strong coffee can place us, reveals to us whole regions in our
souls which have nothing in common with the sandy barrenness of our
daily existence. Often too, in our lives, but more frequently at
certain periods than at others, we are conscious that our
intellectual vision is keener than people, or even than we
ourselves, supposed.</p>

<p>We hear a conversation and, as the words cross one another, we
register people's motives as if we were reading them. We go to a
lecture and we appreciate or criticize it, as it goes on, as we
seldom did before. We are conscious of all that flashes through our
minds. Meanwhile we know that other, less perceptible, gleams may
gather light if we watch them without pretending to do so, and a
rare illumination may follow.</p>

<p>What we then see, what we sometimes note on bits of paper which
we treasure like misers, are the germs from which creation springs,
or from which a fuller life is developed. They may be short-lived
and elusive, or jostled out of sight by a rush of others, but they
do not differ in nature from what ultimately becomes, in highly
gifted intellects, the work of genius. How they can be multiplied
or strengthened, above all, how they can be got at when they have
retreated to our subconsciousness, is the problem.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-4-12" id="ch-4-12"></a>Chapter Twelve. How We Can
Get At Our Own Ideas</h3>
<p>PHILOSOPHERS WORTHY OF THE NAME all entertain the ambition of
giving an explanation of the world. Most of them realize how much
that is purely tentative there is in those attempts. On the
contrary, most of them are emphatic in their recommendation of some
mental process through which we can attain Truth. This word is
getting worn out From over-use, and modern scepticism is on its
guard against it. But nobody objects if it is understood to denote
the illumination accompanying the contact of our mind with what we
call realities. When we are conscious of such an illumination, our
intellectual search is at an end and repose takes its place.</p>

<p>Intellectualists like Aristotle, the Schoolmen, Descartes, or
most modern scientists look for this illumination in formal logic.
They want a full and clear statement of data, and they set precise
rules for their elaboration and the verification of the conclusions
drawn from them. Their idea seems to be a scientific collection,
well-housed in a roomy hall and arranged in such logical sequence
that at no time is the visitor inclined to stop in uncertainty
before the specimens displayed for his inspection.</p>

<p>There is another, quite contrary, method, which has always
charmed people of a religious or poetic turn, viz. immediate
contact with spiritual realities. A lyrical poet does not refer to
encyclopaedias when he feels the coming of inspiration. We, humdrum
church-goers, are glad of a good sermon or a serviceable book to
help us with our plodding meditation, but great mystics have no
need of any such adjuvants: their minds are soon ravished, they do
not know where, and they stay there, rapt in contemplation. That
their minds are not the victims of a fascination, no matter how
noble, but, on the contrary, follow the rules of some logic is made
evident from the fact that, as appears from their writings,
contemplation reveals substantially the same things to them all.
The virtue of this mental process is also visible in their
writings. The characteristic of mystic literature is sublimity, of
course, but it is also a marvellous facility. Madame Guyon used to
say she could write endlessly about spiritual realities, and she
does not differ in this from safer guides than herself. No trace of
effort can be detected in Saint Teresa's <i>The Castle of the
Soul</i> or in the Fourth Book of the <i>Imitation</i>. Many
passages in the Letters of Saint Paul are more lyrical than
anything else. Compare the feverish tension perceptible in those of
Pascal's <i>Pensées</i> which are merely the work of his intellect
with the state of mind easily inferred from the few lines scribbled
on his famous amulet, which was the outcome of a revelation. From
Plotinus to Swedenborg all illuminists have descanted on the floods
of light produced by the contemplative process in which they
delighted. But is there a single man or woman who has not
experienced something of the kind?</p>

<p>Modern Intuitionists, like Newman or Bergson, are closely
related to Mystics. Men of such culture and such vast reading
cannot but know the value of accurate information, but they believe
in a superior logic making use of it. Pasteur was constantly
visited by intuitions which he was afterwards at great pains to
check by the ordinary canons of science. Such intuitions are not
revelations, they are only the result of flashlike comparisons or
oppositions of sets of images stored up in the mind and incredibly
more elastic than the formulas in our intellect which Newman calls
the "notional" as opposed to the "real." Read the <i>Grammar of
Assent</i>, or <i>Creative Evolution</i>, and you will realize that
here are the clear lineaments of an Art of Thinking, certainly
depending more on experience and less on mere exposes than the
advice given by Descartes, Locke, or Herbert Spencer, but aiming at
exactly the same goal. A process of lovingly bending over one's
consciousness is preferred to an exterior one, but the possession
of rich pregnant notions is the end in view just as well. In the
same way, it is difficult to read what poets say about their
visitations, or what artists say about their art without realizing
that these men, constantly bent upon turning their powers to the
best account are in reality laying down for themselves the
principles of an Art of Thinking. The writings of two typical
modern men, Nietzsche and Barrès, constantly describe or exemplify
a method for the production of thought.</p>

<p>Is it possible to sum up what all these introspectors say in an
immense variety of ways? Yes. Read them, listen to them, analyze
their methods, scan their attitude, you will find that they are
living and thinking as close as possible to two fundamental
precepts:</p>

<p>1. Be yourself.</p>

<p>2. Find yourself.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-4-13" id="ch-4-13"></a>Chapter Thirteen. "Be
Yourself"</h3>
<p>"Be yourself if you want to create anything original" is a
truism. How can you do anything that will really be yours if you
are not conscious of your own personality, if you are somebody
else, or even everybody else, or if you are not quite the man you
know you could be?</p>

<p>There are two main obstacles in the way of a man who wishes to
be himself: pretence and diffidence. Few people are not hampered,
or have not been hampered in some phase of their lives, by one or
the other.</p>

<p>Pretence or pose is not confidence. Confidence, when it is
associated with sterling qualities, is not mere confidence any
more: we call it brilliance. Balzac poured himself out in
conversation in a way which gave offence to people of an
over-refined taste, but which delighted psychologists. The same
fault is common in artists whose delight in their conceptions, and
gradually in themselves, is irrepressible. All people endowed with
powerful vitality or imagination, most people with a passion for
independence which life has not damped too severely, are not afraid
of forcing themselves to the forefront. Angle-Saxon simplicity,
added to Anglo-Saxon belief in individual rights, produces similar
results. People who think Anglo-Saxons taciturn or self-contained
have seen them under some restraint, or have not lived familiarly
with them.</p>

<p>Cynicism itself is not always a pose either. In its higher
specimens it is only an exaggeration of sincerity tainted by
conceit or by Rousseau's certainty that nobody is much better than
one's self. I have always found pleasure in a witty Parisian
Jewess's admission that "she would not be natural if she were not
affected." Most people die without saying anything as terse. Marie
Bashkirtseff, now that we have some portions of her diary in their
entirety and not carefully edited by Andre Theuriet, may be a Queen
of Flirts or a Queen of Snobs; she certainly is the author of one
of the most sincere human documents we possess. Is there a more
irritating book in English literature than <i>Evelina?</i> Yet,
Frances d'Arblay's self-complacency is so marvellously transparent
that after a century and a half the book has not been killed by its
faults.</p>

<p>Pose is insincerity in a degree which makes it impossible that
the pretender should not be aware of his own attitudinizing. It
means playing at seeming to be what one is not. How could there be
any vitality left for personal thought when it is used up in that
comedy? How can a man hope to be a creator, even on the humblest
scale, if he insists on being an actor? People who pretend they
follow without difficulty an intricate debate, who pick up formulas
thanks to which they can judge airily of literature and art, who
affect to be experts in foreign politics because they have
travelled and were in Geneva during the League's last session, who
give themselves the airs of knowing people they have never met and
say "my friend So and So" of a distinguished man they have met just
once; the innumerable people who would think themselves disgraced
if they were to say: "No, I have never read Walter Page's letters,
but I read trash in bed every night"; people who applaud a foreign
orator whose language they have never learnt&mdash;those people are
actors, some of them as clever as any on the stage, but they will
never say a word which somebody else will deem worth remembering,
and they will never have a thought which will give them the hope of
being better than mere gramophones.</p>

<p>Professional writers, by the score and the hundred, are apt to
be insincere and to lose thereby all their chances of honest
improvement. Many of them are almost compelled to be so. They were
sincere at first in their liking for literature but they had little
to say, and when that little was said, they were not in a position
to stop; writers they were, and to write they had. So, they do
write, without any real impulse, on a multitude of subjects. They
fill the newspapers, alas! Their jejune glibness, their dodging all
that might commit them, their artificial humor do not take in, for
one instant, even an unprofessional reader who wants information
and is conscious he is not getting it, but, all the same, that way
of writing is the great lullaby that puts the modern mind to sleep.
Observe that even so-called specialists or savants can debase
themselves by such tricks. I have read the works of medical or
archaeological experts who were expert above all at saying Yea and
Nay in the same sentence.</p>

<p>Literary fashions are destructive of the writer's personality.
How hot the French Romanticists used to make themselves by trying
to climb up to Victor Hugo's heights! How much French wit must have
perished in the darkness of Realism! How many writers between 1890
and 1920 copied the complacent rhythm of Anatole France without
being able to rival his range of illustration, his sensibility, or
even the quality of his naughtiness! Who can tell how much that is
sterling observation of life or of the human heart can be destroyed
by the mere affectation of a rhythm? Anybody who has tried his hand
at a pastiche must know how strangely this amusement helps the
special inspiration needed and what unexpected facility it develops
in one, but is not this what happens with a farcical drawing-room
imitation? The imitation of exterior qualities is detrimental to
real creativeness, and, as Herbart says, ultimately becomes
injurious to character. Acted, spoken, or written insincerity is
<i>per se</i> destructive of personality and comes to negative
results. The more we try to seem what we are not, the smaller our
chance becomes of fully being what we really can grow to be.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Diffidence is the other fault that prevents us from being
ourselves. It has a right to a great deal more attention and more
sympathy than its counterpart.</p>

<p>Diffidence must be carefully distinguished from indolence which
also frequently masquerades as modesty. Many people can never be
themselves because they cannot stiffen long enough to be conscious
of their own personality. They are the man they listen to, or the
book they are reading: they are not themselves. In childhood,
medicine or athletics can remedy this feebleness, for effort of any
kind is enough to create a beginning of personality. Properly
cultivated emulation or self-interest can also help education in
its work of developing individual possibilities. Later in life,
there would still be hope if the wish for individuality, or a
vision of the bliss there is in the feasts of the intellect, could
be conjured up. But they seldom can. Even catastrophes leave
supineness unmoved.</p>

<p>Diffidence proper may be a form of conceit: better shrink into
one's self than appear as one is, that is to say, inferior to what
one would like to be. Often too, it is the consciousness that one
is ill-prepared by natural inclination or gifts, by education, or
by present circumstances to do what one is doing. Or it is the
vague reproach of our conscience when our immediate preparation has
not been what it might have been. A charlatan does not mind, but an
honorable man, especially a man who lives more or less in the hope
of some day producing beauty, is afraid of spoiling one more chance
after many others.</p>

<p>Phantasms of all kinds naturally find an easy prey in sensitive
natures. Artists are well-known to be what people who are not
artists call ill-balanced. They may be pretty well satisfied with
what they have achieved in the past: a poem, a chapter of a novel
written by them several years before and beginning to be forgotten
enough to seem like the work of somebody else, will often give them
keen pleasure. But while this poem or chapter was being written it
procured more annoyance than satisfaction. The artist constantly
bears in his mind the idea of an impossible perfection. As he
works, or just before he begins to work, his mind is full of
elusive but the more fascinating images which he hopes to fix by
words. The moment he endeavors to do so, or even tries to see these
images more closely, they vanish, leaving only the fragments of
expression with which he has begun to clothe them. Those remnants
are enough to enrich masterpieces, but compared to the mysterious
appearances which came before them they are like mere dross. Read
Katherine Mansfield's <i>Diary</i>; you will realize what a writer
whose every touch seems to be final went through, feeling that all
she was doing, far from being final, was tentative and inadequate.
The notions: "This could be expressed better" or "Somebody is sure
to express this better" are paralyzing phantasms, and diffidence is
a mild word to describe their effect.</p>

<p>Many times too, the artist will think of some rival he may or
may not love, but admires, and imagine that this person would do
the same work with wonderful ease and in far better style.
Frequently he will be doubtful of his subject and regard it as
inferior to several others which a little thought might soon reveal
to him. He may have moral qualms too, imagining the practical
effects of what he is producing on minds whose weakness or
sensitiveness he exaggerates. Charlotte Brontë almost says that her
conscience would not have allowed her to write <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>, even if she had had her sister's inspiration for it.
All these ideas, extraneous to the one which ought to monopolize
attention, are phantasms obscuring the intellect and weakening the
will power necessary for artistic achievement. Suppose enough of
them, or a siege of one long enough to create a habit, and the man
will not be himself any more, or will be himself in a diminished
way.</p>

<p>What can be done? Dominique, in Fromentin's classical novel,
just gives up, thinking it better to be himself as a
gentleman-farmer than feel dwarfed as a poet. A desperate solution.
Balzac, after his seventh or eighth failure, might have adopted it
too and been satisfied with just being a printer, as indeed he was
at the time. Yet, he was within a year or two of the inspiration
which never left him afterwards. Perhaps the effort he made as a
business man kept his will power up to the mark as an artist. Every
body will be benefited by going into some enterprise, charitable or
other, in which responsibility of a definite character will be
involved; by being in some fight for a real idea, and by speaking
in public about it. The artist who is nothing else and feels
phantasms sitting on his chest is a martyr, and ought to do
anything to escape from the torture and humiliation.</p>

<p>Whatever method we resort to we shall find that any powerful
ideal or idea in us cures diffidence and creates not only
forcefulness but a magnetism. The moment we are conscious of any
such forces filling our minds and our lives, we shall also be
conscious of their irresistibility. So, the problem of how to be
one's self is ultimately a moral problem: viz, how to make the best
use of one's faculties.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ch-4-14" id="ch-4-14"></a>Chapter Fourteen. "Find
Yourself"</h3>
<p>TO BE ONE'S SELF, in the last resort means, as we said, a
stiffening of the attention or of the will. To find one's self
means the reverse. We are not living with ourselves when we are too
attentive to exterior things. We may feel the most conscious of our
own personality when we are the most active, when we are straining
every nerve in the pursuit of some object; but we never dream of
saying that we are finding ourselves when we are in that busy
condition. On the contrary, we are apt to wish for the end of it,
and we long for a time of quiet meditation to possess our soul in
peace. Languages are full of metaphors describing those opposite
states of consciousness.</p>

<p>We "find ourselves" in any mental atmosphere recalling that of a
course of reflections in solitude, of a reverie in the gloaming or
in a quiet autumnal scene, or of a moral crisis which revitalizes
without crushing us. We know times of intellectual intensity
produced we seldom know how, but during which we feel segregated
from the rest of the world, and yet in sympathy and understanding
with everything. Some great book, the vicinity of genius or
saintliness, music, are some of the causes, but there are many
others, sometimes as unlikely as those producing hypnotic
phenomena, which take us where our innermost is to be really found.
The violinist, bending with touching fondness over his instrument,
loves it, no doubt, for what it is giving him, but the soft
radiance over his face means that beginning of ecstasy which is the
ravishment of a soul into itself. All reflective, all productive
natures tend towards such states.</p>

<p>When I was a very little boy my people used to picnic sometimes
in a pretty Ardennes valley under a clump of oak trees shading the
grey walls and discolored slate roof of an ancient mill. Before
leaving, the party would visit the miller for a quarter of an hour,
and the salle became a scene of unusual animation. I generally
managed to slink out of it, unobserved, through an arch opening on
to a stone staircase. There was next to no light on those steps at
first, and what little there was made it look dismal and vaultlike.
You went down and down the winding staircase at least thirty steps,
the light growing stronger but of a strange green tint as you
approached the bottom. Dripping sounds and the rush of swift water
over pebbles were heard. Finally appeared the scene I had been
longing for. A deep cut through the polished slaty strata, mosses
and dainty ferns of all kinds hanging from every moist cranny;
strass pendants over it all. On my right the broad wooden wheel
seemed enormous and ferocious, and I would look away from it,
knowing that I should be terrified if it should suddenly begin to
turn and make its thumping noises while starting the stone and iron
machinery upstairs. But running swiftly past, there was the brook,
broad and shallow, marvellously clear and cool, catching every
green reflection from the walls and a little of the blue up above.
I would stay there for what seemed a long time, sometimes quite
nervous, yet unable to leave. What I saw, what I heard, what I felt
and thought in that magical place seemed to be more my own by right
of discovery than anything else.</p>

<p>I have never been able to read about the stream of consciousness
without remembering the miller's brook. We can only get at what is
nearest to our most personal, viz., our subconsciousness, by
leaving the hubbub of the world where it is and seeking in deep
repose for what differentiates us from other men and women.</p>

<p>The following seem to be the most practical rules for succeeding
in that search:</p>

<p>1. <i>Find your own vein</i>. Our vein means the stratum of our
consciousness that is the richest, and which will yield the most.
In other words, it means the objects, whatever they may be, about
which we think our best. What are those? It is unfortunate to have
to say that bad psychology, only too often influencing education,
answers: they are the objects on which you expend the greatest
amount of study. The answer, on the contrary, should be: they are
the material for thought which you handle with the greatest ease
and with the greatest enjoyment. It is impossible to reflect about
the principles of an Art of Thinking without admitting to one's
self that what one is endeavoring to do is to devise a method
bringing us all nearer to genius. Now genius is primarily power
resulting in ease. Genius never plods. When Buffon defines it as "a
long patience" he means not the patience of doggedness, but the
perseverance of enjoyment. Who will believe that, during the
seventeen years of his quest after his law, Newton did not derive
immense pleasure from what we wrongly call his work, but which
ought to be called the fascinating occupation of his mind? Genius
is well known to be able to devote longer stretches to its work
than ordinary talent which needs intervals of relaxation. The
reason is that the relaxation of genius lies in the consciousness
of doing what it loves to do and would hate to forego. Pope, who
once wrote:</p>

<p class="poem"><i>of happy convents bosomed deep in vines,</i></p>

<p>might have parodied Shelley, but he never could have written the
poem on the Euganean hills. Imagine Dickens writing society novels.
Genius may be associated with other talents and its brilliance may
deceive us by its multiform achievements, but we never mix it up
with versatility.</p>

<p>What books do you read with most pleasure? On our shelves are
some volumes which are our family, and others which are only
visitors. Which are the first? What are those from which we catch
ourselves mentally quoting to ourselves? What subjects keep us
really interested? What are those on which we talk the most easily,
and with the greatest pleasure, to ourselves and to others?
Education, the unfortunate notion that an effort must be associated
with everything great&mdash;a curious perverseness in many high
intellects&mdash;are responsible for ridiculous delusions. Ingres
preferred being complimented about his talent as a violinist to
hearing about his genius as a painter. Falguiere, the sculptor,
would show visitors his paintings, but not his statues. One day
Henner was being taken round the studio, and before every canvas
would, to Falguiere's delight, exclaim: Stunning! marvellous!
Coming to a small marble which Falguiere was passing by without a
glance, the other artist stopped short and said with his Alsatian
accent: "Ah! but this is good!"</p>

<p>What is nearest at hand is our vein, but it takes luck or
experience to convince us of it. The Spanish crew who were becalmed
in the ocean, off the mouth of the Amazon River, could not believe
the natives signalling that the water all round their ship was good
to drink and they had only to throw down the buckets. Far-fetched
is a phrase which, in its broader sense, applies to most of what we
do. Yet, we are all conscious that what we like best in a writer
are the works reflecting the most naturally his own peculiar gift
and temperament. Who reads Bossuet's uncouth poetry? We like things
to give us the impression that they flow. Again, what writer does
not realise that his most successful pages are the ones which gave
him the least trouble?</p>

<p>2. <i>Speak or write in your vein</i>. As you sing on the
breath. People in love or in anger, or possessed of some strong
conviction or desire, are always eloquent. Few of us have not had
some occasion to hear speeches, more stirring than those even of
great orators, poured out by highly-wrought people who did not care
a straw for eloquence.</p>

<p>Writers with a deep moral background of any description are well
known to possess a richer vein than mere artists. Why do people
nowadays prefer the violent ill-mannered Leon Bloy to Anatole
France? What makes Leon Daudet, in spite of his prejudices,
injustice and conceit, the Juvenal of this generation? Anybody
drawing on a similar reserve will produce similar effects. People
are right to make game of the exaggerations of Super-Realists. Mr.
James P. O'Reilly, writing in <i>The Irish Statesman</i> about Mr.
James Joyce, describes their method without any charity:<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>"Sit in a favorable spot where the mind can concentrate on
itself&mdash;or on nothing at all. Get into as passive or as
receptive a condition as possible. While thinking of nothing
definite, write quickly whatever comes to mind&mdash;quickly, so as
not to retain and so as not to rewrite. When you are conscious of
influencing by reason what your hand is writing, begin again.
Write, for example, a series of Ps until the letter unconsciously
begins a word, and your thought series continues. There's the
method."<br>
<br></p>

<p>Surely, this is the method of many practical jokers who call
themselves Super-Realists, but it is not the method of some
extremely talented young men among them, nor that of two of their
most famous predecessors. Read Péguy's <i>Jeanne d'Arc</i>, an an
undoubted masterpiece which the author produced at twenty-two. Read
most of Claudel's works, and you will know what is meant by writing
in one's vein. All rising literary schools are the outcome of a
mental experience showing a few born writers that freedom and
naturalness are essential to inspiration. They all re-discover the
same principles. I have said before that the Middle Ages owed their
unique creativeness, in all the realms of art, to their freedom
from phantasms. So did the French Romanticists till they became
hampered by the phantasm of admiration. Super-Realists want to
write from their subconsciousness, that is to say, as humanly,
richly and freely as possible. Everybody wants to draw on that
vein. When I hear that Racine, the perfection of his perfect age,
used to write his plays in prose before transmuting them into the
exquisite dramatic poems which foreigners find it so hard to call
poetry, I always feel inclined to think that those first drafts
were Super-Realist effusions, as different from <i>Phèdre</i> or
<i>Athalie</i> as Flaubert's first version of <i>La Temtation de
Saint Antoine</i> was different from the one he finally evolved and
definitely spoiled. Have you never noticed the tendency of most
artists to describe their first haunting view of their work in
familiar, or worse than familiar language? A super-realist effort
to keep away literary composition with its trammels and phantasms
as long as possible.</p>

<p>Some rhythms&mdash;taking the word in its fullest
meaning&mdash;keep the writer nearer his subconsciousness than
others. The Homeric rhythm does it more infallibly than any other.
You will feel it in Mr. Belloc's books, even if the author does not
tell you, as he once admitted to me, that Homer is the only
novelist he reads. You will feel it in Barrès' best book, <i>La
Colline Inspirée</i>, about which I also had the author's own
testimony. The habit of working on such a rhythm results in an
almost physical sensation informing us that we are drawing on our
innermost.</p>

<p>3. <i>Know the value of intuition</i>. An intuition is the
mental act we produce the most naturally and with the least
tangible alloy of extraneous elements. Suddenly an illumination
flashes upon us which we had perhaps longed for, perhaps not. In
one instant we see, as the word implies, what we had not seen
before, and we become conscious of the repose accompanying
certitude.</p>

<p>A solution of some difficulty which we have been fighting with,
perhaps for a long time; the transformation, as by magic, of a
whole situation which we had viewed in a pessimistic mood, now
quite differently; a clue unexpectedly found to a person's
disposition which used to puzzle us; the revelation of the
something indefinable we call the physiognomy of a city; an idea
for our work; a whole dramatic scene visualized as if it were acted
before us; a strong conviction, like that which filled Pasteur and
had filled three or four men before him, that a method which seems
preposterous to others is however as sensible as it seems to us,
are examples of intuitions. Hundreds could be found.</p>

<p>No strain, and on the contrary, a sensation of fulness and
freedom are felt during those brief but dazzling revelations. If
you have a gift for mimicry, you know that the moment you imagine
yourself to be the other person, you require no effort to think,
speak and gesticulate as he does. To an inferior actor this would
mean prolonged study of each individual imitation, to one
possessing this talent the whole thing is implied in the initial
vision.</p>

<p>Intuitions are not always as rich as the ones just enumerated,
they may only be rapid glimpses vanishing before we have had time
to seize them and as tantalizing as they are fascinating. But
fascinating they always are. They have nothing in common with the
teasing apprehensions or the depressing doubts which often shoot
across our consciousness in much the same manner. Some books, at
times any book, will produce them. We then experience a curious
duplication: we go on with the book because we love the
illuminations accompanying our reading, yet we are on our guard
against it, because we realize that if we should give it our full
attention we should also interrupt the magic display it has caused
but not produced. Hard pebbles would be substituted for the gems we
have been touching ever so caressingly.</p>

<p>These minor intuitions often come in clusters, or in a quick
succession, but most often without any apparent connection. When we
are dreaming awake, or under the influence of music, their number
is so great that no calculation can approximate it. We then
squander them freely. Yet, we know their value, for, sometimes,
they develop into protracted trains of thought, during which we
realize that our brain is doing its best work, yet doing it without
taxing our cooperation. This is what we want to reproduce after the
spell has been interrupted, this is what we call thinking, and the
mention of an Art of Thinking means to us chiefly the possibility
of recreating at will a similar state of mind. What we call
understanding or comprehending is this superior annexation of some
intellectual growth. Learning or deducing, as algebra or logic
teach us to do, we regard as inferior processes resulting in
joyless acquisitions.</p>

<p>4. <i>Treat intuitions tenderly</i>. Spiritual books
occasionally quote a Latin saying which has terrified more than one
soul: <i>time Jesum transeuntem et non revertentem</i>: "Dread the
passage of Jesus, for He does not return." This amounts to saying:
do not let religious intuitions escape you, for they do not come
twice.</p>

<p>It is an exaggeration to say that intuitions of any kind never
come twice, but they do not come twice with the same appeal. The
moment we feel their presence, it is as if we saw the ripple over
Bethesda and we ought to know that our chance is near. Silence,
both exterior and interior, should prevail; we ought to be
attentive but not eager or, above all, curious. The beautiful
visitor is like a butterfly, no longer the same when caught. So it
must not be caught. If your hand feels for a card and scribbles a
few words for fear another thought might displace the first, you
will be grateful to yourself, even if you have, many times, to
regret the concision forced upon you. But if you are over-wise, and
if, in your delight at the visitation, you strive to lose no aspect
of it, inserting it forcibly into your intellectual system and
greedily noting what it says to you in its rich pregnancy, you will
kill it. What is best in Pascal's <i>Pensées?</i> Certainly the
unfinished parts; the briefer these memos the deeper the vista. La
Bruyere would finish his portraits and most of the short essays he
has interspersed between them. However, he certainly cared less for
those cameos than for the short maxims which he never dared to
expand. Writing is one of the methods of relieving the mind, but a
desire satisfied is not a desire any more, and it is a pity.</p>

<p>Most French writers cannot put pen to paper without having done
what they call&mdash;too truly and almost cruelly&mdash;thinking
<i>out</i> their idea. There lies the once living thing, dissected
into paragraphs. It cannot be <i>thought</i> any more, it can only
be written. The vaunted French lucidity is due to that, but what
people sometimes call French unpoeticalness is also due to it.
English writers, and even more Russian writers, either feel the
presence of their inspiration more deeply, or they are in no such
hurry to fix their thoughts, or when they do so their thinking is
not over. They do not write because they have thought, they think
while writing. Obscurity, congestion, lack of balance are often the
consequences. Newman admitted there were passages in his own
<i>Grammar of Assent</i> which he did not understand. But, what of
that, if the writer makes you think, instead of merely teaching
you? I believe that French writers are more apt than others to feel
the disparity between what they had first conceived and what they
actually see between two book covers because of their
over-conscious method.</p>

<p>To work on an idea does not mean intellectual concentration of
the usual kind. No sweating here will do. A prayerful solitude with
a dash of austerity in the daily routine is necessary; then, what
Tyndall, describing the production of inventions, called
"brooding," and what Newton called "thinking of it all the time."
It seems as if the earnest wish to get at the whole thing should be
the chief thing, acting, of course, on our subconsciousness. The
experience of most artists is that the quality of their production
is in keeping with the intensity of their wish. As I said before,
Sir Walter Scott reading books with no relevance whatever to his
subjects, or Charles Dickens rambling through the deserted streets
at night, was trying to retard rather than hasten what we call
clear thought, but which ought to be called final thought. Real
work, real brooding consist in peopling the mind with congenial
images, sometimes called in by our desire, sometimes-conjured up
from our memories gone over at random rather than methodically.
When the light comes at last, as full as we can expect it ever to
be, whatever we do, do not let us map out what we have discovered
in the shape of a synopsis. Numbering and brackets are too unlike
thought ever to revive its first appearance.</p>

<p>5. <i>Cultivate evocative moods</i>. There is in us a stratum
more sensitive than the rest, which we know and where we can go at
will. A behaviorist would say that the inevitability of the
response from that stratum in our consciousness proves that it is
biological, but all I want to say is that we know from experience
that the response is sure. If we live a great deal with ourselves
we increase our personality, and if we revive certain facts or
periods, or phases of feeling in our lives, we heighten our
receptivity.</p>

<p>Our life with its peaks&mdash;which we know&mdash;of sentiment,
effort, nobility, or increased intelligence, is a veritable mine of
evocative moods. A few minutes' leisure is enough to replace
ourselves in such moods, and no sooner are we conscious of them
than the phosphorescence of intuitive-ness begins. Poets know it
well. Their own experience, sometimes woefully restricted in
appearance, is the constant support of their inspiration. They, as
well as artists, are remarkably like children, and have never
broken the thread binding the various periods of their lives
together, as men living in the world, and for the world, will do.
Their childhood especially, with its wealth and depth of
impressions, is frequently present to them. Nothing is more
evocative than the memory of early years. What narrative of a
childhood, from <i>David Copperfield</i> to <i>Du Côté de chez
Swann</i>, does not delight us, even when the novelist or
memorialist has not the power of a Dickens or a Proust? The reason
is that all the impressions recorded are fresh, and connect at once
with the freshest ones we possess. Life, in time, wrenches us from
those memories to mind what we call our fights, which are, in most
cases, anything but noble, but even very young people realize their
value to themselves. I used to know a schoolboy who, before
tackling an essay, would go back to his childish emotions or
griefs, and imagined he found himself at once in the productive
part of his soul.</p>

<p>Some faraway states of consciousness, difficult to define at the
time, because they were so rich, and never quite exhausted in spite
of frequent drawing upon them, still preserve their haunting
quality and evocative power. I shall never quite account for the
fact that long before visiting Spain I felt something Spanish in
the atmosphere of the Good Friday of a year when I was nine or ten.
The same <i>éclat</i>, the same impassioned violence. Later on, an
afternoon of All Souls' Day filled me with the same wondering
excitement which, even now, I can renew at a few minutes' notice.
It was a brilliant November afternoon, apparently ill-suited to the
melancholy of the day; the heavens were high and deep. An east wind
was blowing its mad exhilaration through the park avenues,
themselves all sunny and lyrical. From one kingly aspen thousands
of golden leaves seemed to leap into the blue, little souls
released, at last, and plunging into infinity. The chateau had not
been deserted for Paris, yet, but its inmates were not abroad, and
I was the only living person looking at the gorgeous sight. I felt
as if I possessed it all with all its magic, as if the mystery of
Autumn's beauty were solved at last; yet, I should have been unable
to analyze the scene and its effect upon me.</p>

<p>Who cannot remember such moments, and who, remembering them,
does not realize that he is where his soul is the most active,
although it does nothing to break its passivity? Such experiences,
renewed when we wish, do more than years of conscious effort or
laborious study to teach us what thought is and where it is.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-4-15" id="ch-4-15"></a>Chapter Fifteen. Literary
Production Possible to All</h3>
<p><i>"Literary production possible to all...You want us to be
writers like yourself, don't you?&mdash;Or, do you feel that
writing is the only way to reach perfection in thinking?"</i></p>

<p>"Far be it from me to wish for such a thing! If I could reduce
printed matter to one-thousandth of what it is, I should do it in a
second. And if there is a melancholy object it is the man or woman
trying to write, as others try to sing, or paint, or act, or do
anything, without talent."</p>

<p><i>"Well then, what is that marvellous literary production
which, being possible to all, is therefore possible to me? How can
I wriggle myself into the history of literature without adding to
that mountain of printed matter which you say you dislike?"</i></p>

<p>"Do you regard all that is in print as literature?"</p>

<p><i>"What a question! Ask me another.</i></p>

<p>"Then do you think that all that has a right to be called
literature is in print?"</p>

<p><i>"No, O Socrates, I do not. Every day we hear of famous
writers' unpublished manuscripts being discovered. They were
literature from the moment they were written, I should think. Year
after year we hear that somebody's correspondence or somebody's
memoirs have just been discovered and are going to be printed. I
suppose those memoirs and letters are literature, and were so even
in manuscript."</i></p>

<p>"Yes, Madame de Sévigné's or Chesterfield's letters are in every
textbook, and so are Saint-Simon's memoirs, and so is Pepys' diary,
and so are hundreds and hundreds of collections of letters or
memoirs by less known authors who, however, cannot be left out of
what we call literature. Why?"</p>

<p><i>"Well written, I suppose.</i></p>

<p>"But what is good writing?</p>

<p><i>"Why, distinguished language, or witty language, or noble, or
touching, or in any way fascinating language. Whatever is high
above the common run of what we all write is well written, I should
think."</i></p>

<p>"Excellent! You realize there is a distinction to be made
between mere words and the sentiments they express. If Jeanne
d'Arc, who certainly was no scholar, had left a correspondence, it
would be literature, no doubt."</p>

<p><i>"Why! If Tommy Jones' love-letters to Miss Brown were
revealed they would be literature. He once showed one to me and I
turned green with envy. Yet, Jones is no writer, bless
him."</i></p>

<p>"You mean that every deep or strong sentiment, faithfully
expressed, is literature. And so it is. That is why we all love
letters so, and read them as greedily fifty years after they were
written as the maid of fifty years ago did when she found them on
madame's desk. We hate egotism, but somehow we love to hear people
talk about themselves."</p>

<p><i>"Do you...do you think my letters are literature?"</i></p>

<p>"Some of your letters must have been. But those which you write
to me nowadays are certainly not. You never say a word about what
you think or feel, you tell me what you do or what other people do,
but you never analyze either your own, or their motives as you
would, as in fact you constantly do, while discussing people in the
smoking-room. Your letters are full of trivialities and full of
cliches. Surely Jones' letter to Miss Brown did not look like
that."</p>

<p><i>"I am afraid you are right, even if you are discouraging. But
shall I tell you why I write that kind of letter, why we all write
the same letter, alt the time? Well, business does that. You get
used to dictating twenty times over the same letter to different
people, and in time your mind cannot get away from the business
rhythm. I write to my wife as I do to you, and she used to complain
about it. Now she does not. She is used to it, I suppose."</i></p>

<p>"You've hit the nail on the head this time. When I say that we
all can produce literature in our letters I mean that a letter
gives us a unique chance of expressing our self. Nobody is reading
it over our shoulder, nobody is expected to criticize it after it
is written. In the terms used in this book, no phantasm is to be
feared, no inferiority complex is likely to weaken us. We are at
our best to express what we know best, namely the feelings
immediately perceptible to our consciousness. This ought to result
in absolute naturalness, which is literature. I know a novelist, a
woman, whose books are painful reading. The poor dear is never
herself. She is Sinclair Lewis one year, Willa Cather the next,
that is to say she tries to be, but only produces cheap imitations
like an Oklahoma seamstress trying to copy Paris styles. But the
same woman writes letters in which you see her life and her soul in
a transparent light, every word acting like a bright little bulb
instead of a dull little patch."</p>

<p><i>"Oh, I know what you mean, of course, but why should I write
literature?"</i></p>

<p>"Nobody wants you to write literature. What I object to is
waste. Every day you waste a chance, many chances in fact, of
getting at your innermost consciousness by expressing yourself as
you see yourself, and I say it is a pity because it makes you, year
after year and day after day, more like anybody else and more
anonymous. Mind you, you may have more strength, or what you call
strength, to-day than when you left college, but you had more
individuality at twenty-one than now. You were nearer to yourself
and nearer to good books, that is to say, to a standard of
satisfactory expression. Indeed, like most people, you wrote a much
better letter in those days. You have hardened and ossified from
mere laziness resulting in rather shameful imitation. You have to
bear your share of the blame for hearing the same conversation ten
times over if you go to ten different places. Literature is
self-expression, I &gt; tell you, and self-expression is
individuality, and our individuality is our self, which ought to be
our chief concern. But we enrich that poor self of ours all our
lives with money, and all our lives we impoverish it by stealing
from it what makes it our self till there is nothing left. The
language is only too accurate when it speaks of nobodies or
ciphers. The world is a huge number consisting of a few figures and
of an astronomical row of noughts. Therefore, stiffen, resist, say
no, for heaven's sake, and if you do, you will be a real man and
your letters will be real letters which might be printed as so many
have been."</p>

<p><i>"I will make a note of all this. It is worth it, and I dare
say it is what you call literature."</i></p>

<p>"Let literature alone, but by all means make notes. If you would
note all that you hear or think that you feel is worth remembering,
the collection would be a valuable diary. Read Amiel's Diary, it
will not bore you, and you will see what can happen in a life spent
in a little Swiss town in which apparently nothing ever happened.
Packed full with the only things that count: thoughts and
sentiments."</p>

<p><i>"Well, I am willing to produce literature of the kind you
describe, but how I should hate to appear in print!"</i></p>

<p>"I know. You only print the balance-sheet of your bank. That is
enough, and lots of people think it capital reading. But let me
assure you that innumerable writers whose books you hear mentioned
possessed less capacity for reading their own consciousness or
expressing it than many men of whom destiny made bankers."</p>

<p><i>To sum up, everyone of us can be personal, that is to say,
creative, if he is not in danger of losing his personality in
self-consciousness, or through the phantasms besetting whoever
tries to express himself. This means that he, at once, becomes
interesting to his fellow-beings and indifferent only to an
individual who will drown himself in the multitude. This interest
is the basis of literature, and so, it is obvious that we all can
produce what has a right to be called literature, but we must not
be thinking of literature while doing so. The doctrine underlying
this volume is that thought alone counts, and thought cannot
coexist with anything that is not our self in its highest and
noblest possibility.</i></p>

<h3><a name="ch-5" id="ch-5"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>THIS BOOK has not been written for literary people although it
had to be based on a writer's experience. Nothing could be farther
removed from its purpose than a tendency to regard the thinker as a
specialist instead of as merely a man worthy of the name. The
author feels deep respect for any man in possession of high
principles which speak through his conduct as well as through his
words. Whatever may be his deficiencies this man is a thought
incarnate.</p>

<p>Give such a person the means of strengthening his thinking
capacity by broadening the field and raising the level of his
thought, and you will make him and his influence proportionately
greater. Show him the possibility of attaining to Vision or
Creativeness, and you lift him up to the supreme height.</p>

<p>This is what this book is trying to do. It cannot produce the
wish to think where it does not exist, but, given this
indispensable germ, it ought to provide the necessary conditions to
bring it to maturity. Ask men who have developed what started them
on their progress. You will often be surprised by the simplicity as
well as by the variety of their answers. A few words in a book, the
catalog of a school, the mere outline of a method, the impression
left by an exceptional man, his reaction to intelligence or to
fatuity, the expression of his face, his very silences, may have
been enough.</p>

<p>A similar effect can be produced or, at all events, prepared, by
some random sentence in pages full as these are of a desire to help
thought. To some people the advice: "Read the newspaper as a page
of history," will sound like an epigram. But to others it may be
the starting point of a new mental life. Others again may be helped
by the mere rhythm of this work, by its Contents, or by its title
alone.</p>

<p>Here, as in other things, what is wanted is a beginning and a
method. The beginning belongs to God, but the method belongs to us,
and it can be learned, in a few hours, even from such a book as
this. The writer has had no other ambition and he cherishes no
greater hope than that of being useful.</p>
