  <h3>A POLICE CONSTABLE LEE STORY</h3>

  <h3>First Published in <i>Ideas</i>, May 26, 1909</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="blurb">In 1909 Edgar Wallace wrote 24 short stories featuring
  Police Contable Lee of the London "D" Division for publication in the British
  weekly magazine <i>Ideas</i>. A number of these were reprinted in
  <i>Ideas</i> in 1928-1929 (some under new titles) and in other magazines.
  Nine of the P.C. Lee stories were later included
  in the 1961 collection <i>The Undisclosed Client and Other Stories</i>. So
  far as could be ascertained, the only story in the series that appeared in
  any collection published during Wallace's lifetime was "Change," which was
  re-written (without P.C. Lee) as "Mr. Sigee's Relations" for <i>The Lady
  Called Nita</i>, published by George Newnes, London, in 1930.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">'LIKELY enough,' said P.C. Lee, 'you've heard me tell about
  Captain Kintock. He wasn't the sort of man you'd expect a police constable to
  have much to do with, because he was of the higher class of bad lot, but
  owin' to his livin' on my ground&mdash;a very fine house he had in Ladbroke
  Gardens&mdash;an' owin' to my knowin' Baine, that did most of his dirty work,
  I got a fair inside knowledge of what happened at Epsom.</p>

  <p>'In a sense, this story I'm goin' to tell you is a racin' story, though I
  don't want you to run away with the idea that I know much about it.</p>

  <p>'When people tell you that racin' is a game that is only followed by
  thieves an' blackguards, by sharps an' flats, do not believe them. Some of
  the worst men in England go racin', but then, again, some of the best go,
  too.</p>

  <p>'The bulk lie between the two extremes, an' are sane, decent citizens, who
  love the sport for the sport's sake.</p>

  <p>'But the bad men are very bad, because they are clever, an' a clever bad
  man is a dangerous animal.</p>

  <p>'Kintock was one the "Heads". He'd had money enough to sink a ship, at one
  time or another. A gambler born an' bred, he would bet on anything from
  horses to windmills.</p>

  <p>'But Kintock was a crook, it was against his nature to go straight an'
  when it was a question of an easy honest way of doin' a thing, an' a hard,
  dishonest way, he always chose the latter for the sheer devilry of it.</p>

  <p>'Rumly enough, he never took to horses till he'd run through every other
  form of gamblin', but when he did, he took to it colossal scale. He bought
  bloodstock in every direction, bought horses at the sales, an' out of sellin'
  races, an' took a lease of an old trainin' establishment down in Wiltshire,
  an' spent half his time between there an' Kensin'ton. Everybody knew he was a
  crook, but nobody knew enough about him to point to any definite act he had
  committed, an' so, somehow, he managed to get the Jockey Club to give him a
  licence to train.</p>

  <p>'He was an extraordinarily fascinatin' man. Tall, lean-limbed, with a face
  like one of those Greek gods you see at the British Museum, an' a head of
  brown, curly hair that was goin' grey.</p>

  <p>'So far as I could find out, he'd come into a lot of money&mdash;somethin'
  well into six figures&mdash;when he was twenty-one. He lived for a year at
  the rate of £500 a day, went into bankruptcy, an' was sent abroad. He made a
  fortune in the Argentine an' lost it in South Africa, floated a bogus company
  in Egypt, got concessions from the Turkish Government in Syria, an' turned up
  smilin' in England a rich man for the second time.</p>

  <p>'Then he disappeared suddenly, an' about the same time a lot of excited
  shareholders made the discovery that the concession in Syria wasn't worth the
  paper it was written on, an' the assets of the Egyptian company were just
  worth the market value of a roller-top desk an' an easy chair, which formed
  the furniture of the company's office in Mincin' Lane. I don't know how they
  settled it, but I rather think that some of his rich relations paid up an'
  liquidated the company, an' a year later Kintock was in Monte Carlo with
  enough banknotes to stuff a portmanteau. Soon after this it was that he came
  to England to work the horses.</p>

  <p>'I don't know how he froze on to Baine, but I can guess. Baine used to
  call himself a commission agent, had a house in Nottin' Dale, an' was a wrong
  'un through an' through. A little bullet-headed man with an enormous slit of
  a mouth an' bow legs that were always done up in horsey-lookin' gaiters, he
  was well known at small meetin's an' made his livin' by chummin' up to
  inexperienced young men an' "tellin' the tale". His <i>modus operandi</i> was
  to get them to invest a few sovereigns on a horse that hadn't got an earthly
  chance of winnin'. He would take the few sovereigns an' "invest" them by
  puttin' the money in his pocket. When the horse lost he'd come back to the
  "mug" an' spin a beautiful yarn about how the horse would have won if he
  hadn't been interfered with at the start.</p>

  <p>'Just about this time there was a young chap livin' in Kensin'ton Gardens
  by the name of Hite. He was one of those fellows who suffer from havin' too
  much money, an' naturally he turned to racin' as a cure for the disease. His
  father was one of them scientific fellows who don't take any notice of money,
  but spend their lives lookin' through a microscope to see the little bugs in
  the blood. A professor at Oxford he was, an' so young Sanderson Hite, who
  wasn't scientific, except with a book of form, got into touch with Baine.</p>

  <p>'Baine noticed him at one or two race meetin's, an' particularly noticed
  that he was always alone, an' so he struck up a sort of acquaintance with
  him, an' told him "the tale."</p>

  <p>'It was about the winner of the Newbury Spring Cup, an' Sandy took it all
  in, very eagerly.</p>

  <p>'Only when it came to the question of partin' with five pounds he
  hesitated an' said he'd put the money on himself.</p>

  <p>'To Baine's annoyance he went into the ring an' backed the horse which
  hadn't a hundred to one chance&mdash;for £250!</p>

  <p>'Baine absolutely gnashed his teeth when he saw all this good money goin'
  into the bookmaker's pocket, but he nearly died with amazement when this
  "dead" horse he'd recommended won the race by a short head, beatin' a hot
  favourite.</p>

  <p>'Two thousand pounds young Sandy cleared, an' he handed over a hundred to
  Baine for his information. After that, Baine couldn't do wrong so far as
  Sandy Hite was concerned. Seein' that he'd got hold of the original golden
  egg-layin' goose, Baine clamped himself on to it, an' laid himself out to get
  <i>bona fide</i> information, an' for weeks these two reaped in a fine
  harvest.</p>

  <p>'The Captain was beginnin' to win a few races just then, but was bettin'
  very light, for him, so that when Baine mentioned "Sandy" an' asked if he
  could put him "on" to a good thing that the Captain was runnin', he said he
  didn't mind.</p>

  <p>'Now, the most curious feature of the whole business was this, that
  Kintock never met Sandy, not even when he marked the boy down for pluckin'.
  He preferred to do it through Baine, an' what is more, he never touched Sandy
  for a penny until the great Highbury Boy bet.</p>

  <p>'Highbury Boy was a two-year-old, the property of Lord Horling. Entered
  for all the classic races an' tried, almost as a yearlin', to be well above
  the average, Kintock purchased the colt, with his engagements, for ten
  thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>'If ever there was a man who knew a horse, that man was the Captain, an'
  when he said that Highbury Boy would win the Derby, Baine believed him.</p>

  <p>'He ran him in a couple of his engagements an' ran a "bye". The colt could
  have won on both occasions, but the jockey, ridin' to orders, contrived to
  get himself shut in.</p>

  <p>'Then he brought him out for the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster, an' the
  Captain betted. He went into the ring, an' threw the money about as though he
  were bettin' on the most certain of certainties, an' Highbury Boy startin' at
  2 to 1 a strong favourite, won in a common canter.</p>

  <p>'That was the last race of his two-year-old days, an' when, just before
  Christmas of that year, bettin' on the next year's Derby began to creep into
  the papers, he would have been installed a hot favourite but for the
  disquietin' news published in the sportin' press, that he had trained off,
  accordin' to the papers.</p>

  <p>'Baine was very prosperous in those days&mdash;I think he was on the
  Captain's pension list&mdash;an' I don't doubt that some of the exclusive
  information published in the London sportin' papers came from him.</p>

  <p>'I saw him one day&mdash;Highbury Boy bein' at 20 to 1 an' me havin'
  backed him at sixes I was a bit upset.</p>

  <p>'"What about this horse of yours, Baine?" I ses.</p>

  <p>'"Highbury Boy?" ses he, innocent, "oh, he's trained off accordin' to the
  papers."</p>

  <p>'"I know all about the papers," I ses; "are you their special
  correspondent?"</p>

  <p>'"Without the word of a lie," he ses, very frank, "I am."</p>

  <p>'The Craven Stakes, the first race in which Highbury Boy was entered as a
  three-year-old, came, an' the "Boy" was scratched; the Two Thousand Guineas,
  won by Bel Mere (who also won the Craven), passed without the colt's puttin'
  in an appearance. He ran at Kempton for the Jubilee Handicap an' finished
  tenth, an' he went right out of the Derby list an' was spoken of as a
  doubtful starter.</p>

  <p>'On public form it looked a thousand pounds to an orange pip on Bel Mere,
  an' money was laid on him, an' the first an' most enthusiastic of his
  supporters was Sandy.</p>

  <p>'He was very jubilant, an' very confident, because he'd had a good season
  the year before, an' he'd come into somethin' like £40,000 by the death of an
  aunt.</p>

  <p>'"Baine," ses he one day when we were all in the tea-room at Newbury, "if
  these were the old days when one could bet in ten thousands, I could double
  my fortune on Bel Mere."</p>

  <p>'"What do you mean by old days, Mr. Hite?" ses Baine. "It is just as easy
  to get a bet on for ten thousand, or one of even twenty thousand for the
  matter of that, as it ever was."</p>

  <p>'Then he went on to tell him of Captain Kintock, of what a fine, generous
  "better" he was, an' how, even though Highbury Boy was a physical wreck, he
  was so cocksure that it would beat Bel Mere that he'd stake his life on
  it.</p>

  <p>'Sandy bit at the bait quicker than Baine thought possible.</p>

  <p>'"Would he?" he said eagerly. "What! After the Jubilee runnin'? I wish to
  goodness he would!"</p>

  <p>'If you wonder why this young man was prepared to make such a huge bet,
  you have got to remember that Bel Mere was extraordinarily superior to any
  other horse in that race except Highbury Boy, an' that Highbury Boy was
  popularly supposed to be a cripple on crutches. Well, the long an' the short
  of the discussion was that Baine promised to see the Captain an' ask him if
  he was prepared to back Highbury Boy against Bel Mere, an' after a lot of
  palaver an' an exchange of polite letters, the Captain expressed himself as
  willin' to lay one bet of £15,000 against Bel Mere beatin' Highbury Boy.</p>

  <p>'I heard all this afterwards.</p>

  <p>'Derby Day came nearer, an' then I believe there was some more
  correspondence, an' the £15,000 bet was increased to £25,000, an' then the
  Captain had a bit of bad luck, for the story of this wager got into the
  papers, an' the first thing that happened was old Mr. Sanderson Hite got to
  hear of the foolish tricks that his son was playin', an' puttin' aside his
  microscope an' his test-tubes an' his electric batteries, he came down to see
  Kintock, one simple old man with no worldly knowledge worth speakin'
  about&mdash;an' Kintock so wise an' cunnin' an' glib.</p>

  <p>'It was a gorgeous spring mornin' when he arrived at Epsom. Kintock had
  rented a house just outside the town, an' Highbury Boy was in the stable,
  guarded day an' night by a couple of men.</p>

  <p>'They were sittin' out on the lawn takin' eleven o'clock tea&mdash;he was
  a very abstemious man was the Captain&mdash;when old Mr. Hite was
  announced.</p>

  <p>'He came up the garden path, by Baine's account, a neat old figure dressed
  with scrupulous care. Spotless linen, perfectly fittin' frock coat, an' a big
  old-fashioned satin bow to his wing collar. His fashion was the fashion of
  forty years ago, he might have stepped out of an 1874 fashion plate.</p>

  <p>'He got straight to business with Kintock with an old-fashioned quietness
  of speech an' courtesy that was very puzzlin' to Baine. Without any
  preliminary he started in about Highbury Boy.</p>

  <p>'"I have taken the trouble," he ses, "to study the form&mdash;is that the
  word?&mdash;of Highbury Boy, an' to my surprise I find that it is quite
  possible to anticipate winners from the study of a horse's performances. If
  Highbury Boy were in good health, would he win the Derby, Mr. Kintock?"</p>

  <p>'The Captain hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he admitted after a pause.</p>

  <p>'"Is he well?"</p>

  <p>'The old man sat bolt upright in his chair, his thin white hands crossed
  upon his stick, an' the question was hurled at Kintock with a sudden ferocity
  that was surprisin'.</p>

  <p>'Baine saw the Captain shift uneasily at the directness of the attack.</p>

  <p>'Then the old man went on.</p>

  <p>'"You have told me all I want to know," he ses. "I have made diligent
  search for the origin of the stories of your horse's illness, an' I have
  traced the rumours an' head shakin's an' whispered reports. Now, I ask you,
  sir," he went on, "to do me a favour."</p>

  <p>'"I shall be happy to do anythin' in reason," said Kintock.</p>

  <p>'"I ask you to take your bettin' book an' run your pen through the bets my
  son has made with you concernin' your horse."</p>

  <p>'Kintock laughed.</p>

  <p>'"That I shall not do," he said calmly.</p>

  <p>'The old man rose with a little inclination of his head.</p>

  <p>'"Then your horse will not win," he said with such an air of confidence
  that the Captain was startled. "I have given you a chance, an' you have
  refused to take it. I do not care a straw how much money you may make from
  your other dupes, I am satisfied that the foolish young man who is my son
  shall be saved from his folly." 'Then Kintock got wild at the old man's
  confidence, an' did a foolish thing, for he lost his temper an' spoke
  frankly.</p>

  <p>'"My horse will win," he said angrily, "that's the truth, an' you might as
  well know it. Win! Why, Bel Mere will not see the way the Boy will go! An' as
  for your son, I hold him to his bargain. If he doesn't pay I'll post him,
  yes, by&mdash;"</p>

  <p>'The old man turned to go; then he hesitated an' came back.</p>

  <p>'"Would it be askin' too much if I asked your permission to see this
  wonderful horse of yours?" Then, as a suspicious frown gathered on Kintock's
  face, he went on, with a wry smile, "My interest is not an unnatural one, is
  it?"</p>

  <p>'But Kintock's suspicions were aroused.</p>

  <p>'"You may see the horse," he said, "but at a distance."</p>

  <p>'He called Baine aside, an' told him to watch the old man closely, an' if
  he made any movement that threatened the horse's safety to grip him.</p>

  <p>'He went to the stables himself, an' by-an'-by came back to invite the
  professor into the little meadow that adjoined the house, an' after a while
  the two grooms come in leadin' Highbury Boy.</p>

  <p>'The old man stood with his 'ands behind him watchin' the beautiful bay as
  they led him up an' down.</p>

  <p>'There never was a more perfect-lookin' colt than the Boy, an' somethin'
  like pride came into Kintock's face as he watched the horse movin'.</p>

  <p>'Then the old man spoke.</p>

  <p>'"Once more, Mr. Kintock, will you cancel my son's bet?"</p>

  <p>'"No," said Mr. Kintock briefly, an' the old man nodded.</p>

  <p>'Baine was watchin' him as a cat watches a mouse, but he made no sign.
  Still, with his hands clasped behind him, he stood like one lost in thought.
  Then he roused himself.</p>

  <p>'"Very well," was all he said, an' with bent head an' knitted brows he
  accompanied us back to the garden.</p>

  <p>'"I have one thing to say to you," he said to Kintock, "have you ever
  heard of a sayin', falsely ascribed to the Jesuits, that a man may do harm
  that good may come?"</p>

  <p>'"I have heard that very frequently," said Kintock. "Moreover, that has
  been my creed."</p>

  <p>'"Suppose," the old man said slowly, "suppose somebody got into the stable
  of this fine horse of yours, an'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>'"Nobbled it?" smiled Kintock.</p>

  <p>'"I think that is the word I have read in connection with similar
  occurrences," said Mr. Hite; "suppose this happened&mdash;suppose I sent my
  friends&mdash;"</p>

  <p>'"Try," said Kintock with an ugly smile; "if you or they succeed in
  gettin' at Highbury Boy they're welcome. I shall not complain. If that is
  your hope of preventin' him winnin', you are buildin' upon sand.
  Good-morning."</p>

  <p>'"We shall see," said old Mr. Sanderson Hite, an' he walked down the path
  to the gate.</p>

  <p>'Baine went round to see the Boy boxed for the day, an' after Kintock had
  issued his orders to the grooms, who were devoted to him body an' soul, he
  walked back across the meadow.</p>

  <p>'The Captain had already shaken off his annoyance, an' was laughin'
  quietly at the old man an' his threat.</p>

  <p>'"He is certainly an original, an' if young Sandy had half his
  brains&mdash;hullo!"</p>

  <p>'He stopped suddenly an' picked up a matchbox&mdash;he was the tidiest man
  I ever knew.</p>

  <p>'"Who dropped this?" he said. Then he looked at the box an' whistled. On
  the outside was printed in red letters&mdash;Tompkins, Tobacconist,
  Cambridge. "The old man dropped that," he said with a frown, "he was standin'
  close to this spot. He is not the sort of man to carry an empty matchbox
  about for fun, he didn't look like a smoker; now, what is the meanin' of
  this?"</p>

  <p>'Somehow old Mr. Hite's threat had a depressin' effect upon Kintock, an'
  he must have taken him more seriously than did Baine, for he ordered his bed
  to be taken to the room above the stables, an' had a square hole cut in the
  floor immediately over Highbury Boy's box, an' a pane of glass fitted. He was
  thus able to see all that was happenin' in the stable from the room above. He
  went farther than this, for he went to the police an' got a couple of
  officers specially detailed to watch the outside of the stable for the two
  nights that intervened between Mr. Hite's visit an' Derby Day. I was one of
  'em, an' that's how I come to know all about this story.</p>

  <p>'The Epsom summer meetin' begins on the Tuesday, an' it was on the Tuesday
  that Kintock started to bet. Highbury Boy stood at 50 to 1 in the list when
  Kintock started operations. He was a clever gambler, for he never showed his
  hand thoroughly. He had an agent in Holland backin' the horse, whilst he was
  simultaneously gettin' the odds from the biggest bookmakers on the course,
  an' by night Highbury Boy had been "backed down" to 4 to 1 an' was
  co-favourite with Bel Mere.</p>

  <p>'Kintock's great fear had been that his foolish outburst might have been
  taken advantage of by old Hite; that he would spoil his market, an' he put a
  man on to watch the old fellow.</p>

  <p>'The Captain came home to dinner the night before the Derby jubilant.</p>

  <p>'"He's gone back to Cambridge," he said, with a triumphant laugh, "an' to
  think I was worryin' about him!"</p>

  <p>'"He's thrown up the sponge," said Baine.</p>

  <p>'"Capitulated without firin' a shot," smiled Kintock, "but it may be a
  ruse to throw us off our guard. The Boy must not be left out of our
  sight."</p>

  <p>'Nothin' happened that night so far as I know, an' Derby Day dawned with
  me sittin' on a chair outside the favourite's stable smokin' a pipe.</p>

  <p>'It was a glorious May day, with bright sunshine, an' a fleck or two of
  white cloud in the sky, an' the Downs were crowded. The people stood in a
  solid black mass up the hill, an' ten deep from the startin' gate, round
  Tattenham Corner, to the winnin' post. In the paddock, big as it is, there
  was scarcely room to walk about, but we found a corner where the crowd was
  thin, an' there we saddled Highbury Boy an' gave him his final
  preparation.</p>

  <p>'Kerslake was the jockey, a lad who had won two Derbies, an' knew exactly
  every inch of the course.</p>

  <p>'The bell rang, an' Kerslake mounted.</p>

  <p>'Kintock had a few words with him, an' what the jockey said, I think,
  restored some of the Captain's assurance.</p>

  <p>'"I stand to win £60,000," he said to me, as he an' Baine walked back to
  the rings, me an' Baine to Tattersalls, an' he to the Members' enclosure,
  "an' that old man got on my nerves."</p>

  <p>'"Is he still at Cambridge?" says Baine, an' Kintock nodded.</p>

  <p>'"I've had a man watchin' him there, an' I received a wire from him only
  half an hour ago, sayin' that Hite was lecturin' this mornin' at eleven, an'
  he had seen him a few minutes before he sent the wire."</p>

  <p>'There was the usual parade an' canter, the usual string of horses pickin'
  a slow way across the Downs to the startin' gate, the usual delay, an'
  then&mdash;</p>

  <p>'"They're off!"</p>

  <p>'A roar from the stands an' an answerin' roar from the packed course as
  the bell rang, an' away went the field in a perfect line.</p>

  <p>'Baine was on the rails just behind me, an' was readin' the race through
  his glasses.</p>

  <p>'"Bel Mere is makin' the runnin' from Handy Lad, Mosempions, Highbury Boy,
  an' Cattino," he said.</p>

  <p>'They breasted the hill in a bunch, an' came sweepin' to the left to the
  famous corner.</p>

  <p>'They were all together when they turned into the straight, an' then
  without any glasses I saw Kerslake prepare to take his position.</p>

  <p>'Bel Mere was leadin' an' already stands an' course resounded with the
  yell: "Bel Mere wins!"</p>

  <p>'Then Kerslake went after the leader, caught him an' passed him in with
  one run an' down below in the ring a bookmaker shouted: "I'll back Highbury
  Boy!"</p>

  <p>'Up went the whip of Bel Mere's rider, but he could get no nearer, an'
  Highbury Boy came with his devastatin' strides nearer an' nearer the
  post.</p>

  <p>'Then he stopped . . .</p>

  <p>'There is no other word to describe what happened.</p>

  <p>'Stopped as dead as that horse did that was shot by the anti-gamblin'
  fanatic; then swerved right across the course, stopped again an' went down
  all of a heap as Bel Mere flashed past the post an easy winner.</p>

  <p>'I saw Kintock's white face on the Members' stand as I ran across to the
  horse.</p>

  <p>'Baine was at the horse's side first, an' with another policeman helped to
  lift the unconscious jockey. He was badly shaken by his fall, but was not
  seriously injured.</p>

  <p>'But Highbury Boy was finished, you could see that, long before the vet
  came with the horse ambulance.</p>

  <p>'Kintock, very quiet and self-possessed, directed operations.</p>

  <p>'As it happened there were two famous veterinary surgeons on the course
  an' they accompanied us back to the house&mdash;the Captain, Baine, Inspector
  Carbury an' me.</p>

  <p>'Highbury Boy was taken from the ambulance an' collapsed on the grass as
  we gathered round him.</p>

  <p>'Very carefully one of the surgeons made his examination.</p>

  <p>'"Has he been shot?" asked Kintock, but the doctor shook his head.</p>

  <p>'He continued his examination; then asked if we had a microscope.</p>

  <p>'Baine went into the town to borrow one, whilst the vet applied one or two
  rough an' ready remedies to the horse. By-an'-by he rose an' stood by the
  horse, eyein' him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>'"Remarkable, very remarkable," he ses; then he asked if he might see the
  stable.</p>

  <p>'He went in by himself an' was there ten minutes, an' when he came out he
  held in his hand&mdash;a matchbox!</p>

  <p>'Kintock started back with an oath.</p>

  <p>'"Where did you get that?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>'The surgeon looked surprised.</p>

  <p>'"Out of my pocket," he said, an' just then Baine came back with the
  microscope.</p>

  <p>'The veterinary surgeon took a little blood from the horse with the point
  of a needle an' adjourned to the house.</p>

  <p>'He was back in five minutes.</p>

  <p>'"Have you had any person here interested in tropical diseases?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>'A slow light dawned on Kintock's face an' he nodded.</p>

  <p>'"Because," said the vet, "whoever it was must have inadvertently left
  behind him, these."</p>

  <p>'He opened the matchbox he still held in his hand an' produced two dead
  flies.</p>

  <p>They were a little larger than the house-fly, of a dark-brown colour, an'
  their wings were folded over their backs in the shape of scissors.</p>

  <p>'"This," said the vet, "is the fly which is known to science as the
  <i>Glossina morsitans,</i> or as it is commonly called the 'tsetse fly'. Its
  bite is almost certain death to a horse, though, curiously enough, the usual
  symptoms peculiar to the disease are absent in your horse. Do you know who
  brought the flies here?"</p>

  <p>'"I can guess," ses the Captain with a grim smile.'</p>
