<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>I. &mdash; THE ETHER EDDY</h2>

<p class="first">I JERKED down the result-lever of my Merton
Calculator, and the rattle of its gears was loud in the deserted
reaches of Flight Control Headquarters. The flight-graph imprinted
itself on the space-chart, the thin red line that would guide the
newly launched <i>Phobos</i> on her maiden voyage to Venus. I
glanced through the transparent quartz wall at her tremendous bulk,
vague on the vast tarmac of New York's Spaceship Terminus in the
brooding dark of 3 a.m. The graph line I had just traced jogged
erratically, a million and a half miles out, detouring the
<i>Phobos'</i> course a hundred thousand miles. That hump was why I
was here, alone in the crystal hive. At midnight the message had
pulsed in on the infra-red ray from the domed air-cell on the Moon
where gaunt men ceaselessly scan the skies that Trade may ply
unhampered between Earth and her sister planets.</p>

<p>In their electelscopes a far-flung shimmer had appeared across
the blackness of space and they had leaped to send warning of the
one unconquered menace that harried the spaceways. An <i>ether
eddy</i>!</p>

<p>Sometimes I thought the old memories drowned, the thirty-year
lingering agony ended, that had wiped out for me forever the thrill
of space flight, the transcendant joy of leaping from this wrinkled
ball of ours and hurtling, godlike, among the stars. Then that
word, that damned word that had stripped the winged rocket from my
tunic and made of me a half alive juggler of charts and figures,
would strike my ears. The years would fade and I would be in hell
again.</p>

<p>As now. I saw Jay again, my brother, too poignantly real across
the span of three decades. I saw the wide-shouldered, thick-legged
bulk of him, a strand of yellow hair straggling over his brow, his
broad-planed face flushed with the excitement of his first command.
I felt my hand crushed in his own as I wished him the immemorial
"Happy landing."</p>

<p>The <i>Luna's</i> hatch shut him from my sight. The great craft
blasted-off from Earth. Tile scene shifted. In tortured imagining I
bent over an electelscope view field, pride pulsing in my veins as
I watched the long, clean arc of his flight. He had learned my
teaching well, the bantling. He would, push me hard for my laurels
as ace of Earth's space fleet.</p>

<p>Then there was that black shimmer across the firmament's
spangled black. The <i>Luna</i> plunged straight into it&mdash;and
vanished!</p>

<p>There&mdash;where a moment ago she had been, even in her
tininess, majestic as a symbol of man's conquest of unimaginable
distances, unrealizable cold&mdash;there the inscrutable panoply of
the stars stared horror at me and only a faint trail of rocket gas,
glowing and fading in the vacancy, showed that the <i>Luna</i> had
ever been.</p>

<p>In the madness that took me, I ripped the insignia of my craft
from my blouse and swore that never again should I leave Earth's
atmosphere. I kept that oath, but my great need drew me back to
this place where the space ships, in ever increasing numbers,
leaped for the stars.</p>

<p>Here, while I moldered in the dull routine of my clerk's job, I
could watch the swaggering youngsters who wore the winged rocket
and pretend to myself that perhaps the next craft to land would
bring Jay back to me. Here I had grown old...<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>The little hairs prickled on the nape of my neck. The silence
about me was eerie, the shadows played tricks on my overwrought
nerves. Somehow I felt that I was not alone. And I was afraid.</p>

<p>A furtive sound whispered behind me. My eyes flicked the desk
for a weapon, found none. I forced my swivel chair around, every
nerve protesting.</p>

<p>A tall figure stood in the dimness near the door, black-cloaked,
shapeless. Beneath its black hood was the pale oval of a face out
of which eyes glittered, catlike, in some vagrant gleam. The figure
was motionless, and all the more menacing because of its
immobility. I thought of the lead-capsuled radium in the strongroom
beyond my desk, the pellets that multiplied tenfold the power of
the oxy-hydrogen mixture in the fuel tanks. Five million solar
dollars would not replace them. Bait what thief would dare the
photroncells' spray of death that guarded the treasure?</p>

<p>The intruder moved.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" I rasped. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>A voice came from the shape, a strained, hoarse voice.</p>

<p>"I'm looking for Captain Silton."</p>

<p>Unaccountably blood thumped in my ears. My collar was suddenly
tight.</p>

<p>"I'm Silton," I grunted.</p>

<p>"But I mean Gurd Silton, commander of the <i>Terra</i>."</p>

<p>Long shivers ran through me, and a mad, impossible thought
clamored. That voice!</p>

<p>"I am Gurd Silton," I croaked. "And once I commanded the
<i>Terra</i>." I was no longer afraid. The ague that shook me was
not of fear.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you Gurd Silton!" The other's arm came up. Shrouded
by the fabric of his cloak it pointed at me like a bat's wing.
"You&mdash;impossible. You are an old man, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>I heaved from my chair.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" I said. "In God's name, who are you?"</p>

<p>I hurled myself across the space between, ripped the cloak away
before he could stop me, jerked the hood from his head. And then I
saw him&mdash;tousled yellow hair, a long strand dipping across his
clear brow; frank grey eyes, small now in puzzlement; broad-planed,
youthful face. I saw wide shoulders and thick legs planted in an
old, familiar stance. Sound ripped from my throat.
"<i>Jay!</i>"</p>

<p>He warded me off.</p>

<p>"I'm Jay Silton, all right. But you're white-haired, wrinkled!
You're an old man. You <i>can't</i> be Gurd!"</p>

<p>A queer rage thickened my utterance.</p>

<p>"What did you expect? Thirty years don't leave a man's hair
black."</p>

<p>And then it hit me! Jay wasn't changed at all. He was still,
apparently, a youth of twenty!</p>

<p>He was staring at me with wide, incredulous eyes.</p>

<p>"Thirty years," he whispered. "Why, it's only a month
since&mdash;"</p>

<p>Chaos whirled within my skull. Was I still in the delirium that
had followed his vanishment, my long Calvary only a nightmare? I
saw the space-chart, saw the date imprinted at its upper edge.
November 16, 2048! I pointed to it.</p>

<p>"Look!" I said huskily.</p>

<p>My brother stared at the paper. A vein pulsed in his neck. He
drew the back of a closed fist across his forehead and words
dripped from his working mouth.</p>

<p>"But I swear it's not a month since we&mdash;lost our way. Why,
there's still food left on the <i>Luna</i> and we had only a
month's supply."</p>

<p>His hand came out in a gesture of utter bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Gurd! Where have all the years gone?" His voice was edged with
hysteria, a long shudder ran through him: "Sanders is lost," he
muttered, "and Hollivant. And there are thirty years gone from my
life!"<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Madness flamed in his eyes. I must ease him somehow, say
anything to divert his thoughts from the horror.</p>

<p>"By the way, Jay, I didn't see the <i>Luna</i> land. Where is
she?"</p>

<p>"Hidden in the Adirondack Pleasure Park, in a glen where nobody
goes. I didn't dare land her here."</p>

<p>I was startled.</p>

<p>"Why? Of what are you afraid?" I recalled his furtive entrance,
his close-swathed hood cloak and low-drawn hood.</p>

<p>"Afraid? I told you my mates are gone. Have you forgotten Rule
Forty-nine?"</p>

<p>A chill ran through me. Rule Forty-nine is the most rigorously
enforced of all the Space Code. In case of disaster to a vessel;
her commander must be the last to seek safety. If he return minus
crew or passengers the penalty is&mdash;death in the lethal
chamber!</p>

<p>Severe this may be, but justified. Too often, in the early days,
did space madness seize crew and master alike. Too often did craft
land, with one, only, alive of those who had blasted-off.</p>

<p>It was the one solution, to place all weapons in control of the
master, and hold him straitly accountable for the safety of all
aboard.</p>

<p>"Jay!" my voice cracked. "You didn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No." There was utter truth in the grey eyes. "Of course
not."</p>

<p>"But where are they? Are they alive?"</p>

<p>"That's the hell of it, Gurd. I don't know whether they are dead
or alive. I don't know where they are."</p>

<p>If I was to help him I must get him talking sense.</p>

<p>"Come now, Jay," I rapped out, sternly. "You must have some idea
of where in the universe you have been."</p>

<p>I could see that he was trying to pull himself together, trying
to phrase something unphrasable. His hands fisted at his sides.
Then, "Gurd! It sounds insane. But I don't think it was
<i>anywhere</i> in the universe."</p>

<p>"What! You&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cold, rasping words, interrupted me. Toneless words from across
nine hundred thousand miles of space. "Newyork, Newyork, Newyork,"
the speaker disc above my desk blared. "From Lunar Observatory.
Ether eddy is fading. Ether eddy is fading. Corrections need not be
made. From Lunar Observatory. Newyork, Newyork, Newyork..."</p>

<p>Jay's arms flung above his head, and he shouted incredible
things.</p>

<p>"That's where they are! In that eddy or beyond it! That's where
I came from; It's going, and my last chance is gone! My last chance
to find them, to save them!"</p>

<p>In a flash I knew what must be done. I grabbed Jay's arm.</p>

<p>"Come on, quick!" Without his mates or a witness to his
non-culpability for their loss, death was certain for him. "We
still have time!" What happened to me did not matter. "Hurry!"</p>

<p>We were out of the room, were darting across the tarmac. The
<i>Phobos</i> loomed its dark bulk over us, and, praise be, its
entrance hatch was open. I plunged through, Jay after me.</p>

<p>"Close down," I shouted. "Close down!" The first command of a
space flight. How long since I had uttered it!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>II. &mdash; INTO A NEW
UNIVERSE</h2>

<p class="first">I HURTLED up the companionway, followed by the
clangor of the shutting airlock hatch. Thirty years since I had
flown, yet all the old, hard won spacemanship tingled at my
finger-tips as I burst into the control room and saw before me a
gleaming bank of levers and fuel wheels.</p>

<p>Jay's staccato report met me, from the speaker disc above the
gauge-board. "All tight, sir." Just as in the years when I taught
him the secrets of the void.</p>

<p>"Make it so, mister," I acknowledged in the unforgotten jargon.
"Stand by for the blast-off." Not for nothing had I conned the
plans of this latest product of the spaceship engineers, assuaging
nostalgia in vicarious flight. There was no lost motion now as I
dived for the protective couch, snapped straps around me, and
jammed down the main-feed lever. I functioned almost automatically,
thrown back a third of a century to the old routine.</p>

<p>The surge of sudden vast power, the down-thudding of
acceleration's weight, was a trip-hammer blow to my unaccustomed
flesh. For an instant I knew the agonies of the damned, then
merciful oblivion took me.</p>

<p>I do not know how long I was unconscious, nor what awesome speed
the <i>Phobos</i> attained before the Thorson electro-spring cut
off fuel flow. But when sight and thought returned, I saw in the
visi-screen, the blackness of space, the wide-spread panoply of
stars infinite in distance and number that I had thought never to
set my eyes upon again, and the ominous shimmer of the ether eddy,
straight ahead.</p>

<p>Terror jerked my unwilled hand to the braking valve, but it was
too late. The <i>Phobos</i> plunged straight into the heart of the
mystery from whence my brother had come.</p>

<p>In that instant livid fingers reached, twisting, into my
brain!</p>

<p>The <i>Phobos</i> jarred. That jar seemed repeated in every atom
of my being. Light poured in, a vivid, red light that paled the
gleam, of our argons, a crimson light that smote all color from the
cabin. I whirled to the visi-screen.</p>

<p>And then I was at the lever-bank, furiously, frantically active.
I had seen a great orb blotting out the sky, a gigantic, scarlet
sphere toward which we hurtled headlong.</p>

<p>The <i>Phobos</i> vibrated, screeched protest at the forces that
tore at her.</p>

<p>Great, whirling, scarlet clouds became distinct, blanketing the
strange world that had us in its grip. A craggy spire thrust above
the vapor, spearing to impale our vessel.</p>

<p>The nose-tubes were on full force and they couldn't brake her!
In minutes, in seconds, we should crash against the red world into
infinitesimal fragments. It wasn't thought, it was sheer instinct
unforgotten after thirty years that guided my flashing hands among
the wheels and levers. There was no time for thought.</p>

<p>I swung her! I swung the <i>Phobos</i> half about as she hurtled
to her doom, and with the maximum blast of her main tubes I
diverted her into a sideward path, parallel to the rounding surface
of the strange planet.</p>

<p>That held her! By the horns of Taurus, that held the craft in a
circling orbit, made her a satellite of the cloud-shrouded crimson
world!</p>

<p>I slumped, breathless, and stared at the five-fold visi-screen.
In one division I saw the mist-clothed, encarnadined bulk of the
world whose attraction had nearly done for us. To the side, and far
off, an immense sun sent scarlet streamers writhing out from a
scarlet, dazzling disc. In the other sectors the firmament was
revealed; a black firmament, star-studded. In all that vast panoply
of worlds and suns there was not one familiar constellation! They
were strange, all strange.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>A voice, a blessed human voice, broke the stillness.</p>

<p>"Glad! Are you all right?" Jay leaned against the hatch, his
face ghastly in the weird red light, his pupils unnaturally
enlarged, the corner of his mouth twitching.</p>

<p>"A little dazed, but whole. And you?"</p>

<p>His lips tried to twist into a smile. "I? Oh, I've been through
this before."</p>

<p>"Then this is what we are looking for. This is where you lost
Hollivant and Sanders.'"</p>

<p>He nodded. "If they're still alive, they're down there. We broke
through, like this. Just as you just did, I swung the <i>Luna</i>
about and forced her into a circling orbit.</p>

<p>"I did more. I turned my ship again, so that her stern was
toward that world and tried to blast her away. But I couldn't,
Gurd: The attraction was too great. We were held tight."</p>

<p>"But the <i>Luna</i> was powered to escape from Jupiter," I
exclaimed, "against five times Earth's gravity!"</p>

<p>"It wasn't enough. We were chained here, eternally doomed. I
dared not land, not knowing what lay under those clouds and not
being equipped for interplanetary exploration. We circled
endlessly, seeing below nothing but those rolling mists, now
scarlet in the light of the crimson sun, now black as we passed
over the night hemisphere. I refused to attempt a landing, hoping
reasonlessly that patience would bring release.</p>

<p>"At length Hollivant and Sanders demanded permission to take
space suits and make the attempt. I did not feel justified in
refusing. I opened the air-lock for them, watched their bulky
shapes spiral down, black against the red-lighted clouds, the
long-darting flames of their gas-tubes streaming ahead of them to
brake their descent. I saw them land on that peak we glimpsed, the
only evidence that the strange planet is solid. And
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"And then the <i>Luna</i> jarred. The crimson light was gone,
and in the visi-screen I saw Orion with his sword, I saw White
Rigel and topaz Betelgeuse blazing in splendor. The white blaze of
our own Sun warmed me, and little Earth was a green disc calling me
home."</p>

<p>"You had plunged through the ether eddy again!"</p>

<p>"I guessed that. But, Gurd. What does it all mean? What is this
strange universe, and what became of the thirty years that seem to
me less than a month?"</p>

<p>Somehow I knew the answer, must have reasoned it out
subconsciously as he spoke. "Science has moved while you were gone,
Jay. We know now that the ether eddy is the manifestation Of a
fourth dimensional tangency between two spatial hyperspheres.* You
remember your high school Einstein, don't you?"</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The figure in four-dimensional geometry that
is analogous to a sphere in three-dimensional i.e., the figure
described by a sphere rotated through the fourth dimension, as a
circle is rotated through the third dimension to describe a
sphere.]</p>

<p>"Of course. I get it. Einstein said space, <i>our</i> space, is
unbounded but finite, the three-dimensional surface of a
hypersphere within which, and without, nothing exists that is in
any way related to anything in our space. What's happened is that
we've&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Broken through into <i>another</i> space. Another universe. And
since, as you said, nothing in this space has any relation to
anything in ours, their Times are different, so that it is
perfectly reasonable that while you, here, were living only a month
I, there, aged thirty years."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;" He didn't finish his sentence. At least I
didn't hear him finish it. For I had kept my eyes on the
electelscope viewplate as we talked, and just then, the
<i>Phobos</i> having completed a circuit of the red planet, the
black peak came into its field. And I had caught a flicker of
movement on its surface.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>It was an Earthman, his space suit unmistakable! He seemed to be
struggling with something. A billow of cloud spurted upward and he
was lost to view.</p>

<p>"They're alive," I blurted. "One of them is alive. We've got to
go down there."</p>

<p>I managed it. With a gentle side discharge of the rocket flares
I changed our level circling to a slow, tightening spiral. Each
circuit we made through the shifting changes from black night to
crimson day brought us nearer and nearer the clouds, and then after
an interminable time, we were among them.</p>

<p>We were through them! We were over a great, almost level plain,
black as the belly of Jonah's whale. We landed, gently as
thistledown, right at the base of the needlelike spire that pierced
the clouds.</p>

<p>"How's that for navigating?" I grinned. "The old boy hasn't lost
his skill."</p>

<p>"Swell," Jay applauded. "But what's to do now? We can't climb
that mountain. It must be fifty miles high."</p>

<p>"Into space suits," I snapped. "And the <i>Phobos</i> carries a
small stratocar as a lifeboat. If there's any atmosphere at all,
and there must be or there wouldn't be any clouds, that will take
us up there quicker than we came down."</p>

<p>"Let's get going then. The fellows need our help, bad."</p>

<p>"We'll get going, but I'm afraid we're too late. Time's all
mixed up, Jay, by our circling, but I figure a week at least has
passed here since we saw him, although only minutes in the time of
this universe elapsed while you came back to Earth and we
returned."</p>

<p>"Never mind that. We've got to make a try."</p>

<p>"Okay. I'm with you," I responded. "Don't forget these trinite
guns. I've got a hunch we're going to need them badly."</p>

<p>The buzzing hum of the stratocar's hydroxy motor battered
against the side of that incredible mountain as we lifted straight
up to its summit. Suddenly, just under the cloud ceiling I saw a
hole in the rampart, underlined by a narrow ledge. And on that
ledge&mdash;the broken off hand-claw of a space suit.</p>

<p>"In there! They're in there," I shouted. It was with an effort
that I controlled my shaking hand sufficiently to land our little
conveyance on the ledge. Bulky in our space suits, we squeezed out;
stood precariously on the rock shelf.</p>

<p>The cave that confronted us seemed shallow, a blank wall closed
it only six feet back. But a tunnel angled off to the left, so
sharply that light, reflected not at all by the dull surface of
black rock, did not enter it. My tentative, testing step felt a
level floor in that Stygian darkness, and in the sensitive ear of
my space suit I heard the scrape of Jay's feet following me.</p>

<p>The jointed metal of my garment made sudden, echoing clangor as
I thumped into vertical stone. I froze. Surely that clumsy sound
would arouse the mysterious denizens of this cave would bring them
in sudden attack upon us! My hand-fork closed about my weapon's
butt.</p>

<p>The stillness was ripped by a long wailing cry, packed with
terror; a thin, hopeless, human wail that rose and fell, rose and
fell, somewhere ahead it snapped short. The following, intensified
silence was vibrant with horror.</p>

<p>I jumped forward. The ground dropped away from beneath me, and I
was falling, falling&mdash;</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>III. &mdash; THE TURTLE MEN</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was sound now, sound aplenty. The crash of
my own sheathed body, jerking from side to side. The crash of Jay
dropping too, above me. Rattle of loosened stones, following us
down. I dropped, dropped endlessly.</p>

<p>The sensation of falling ceased, but not the noises. I seemed to
be floating free in the eyeless dark. My flung-out hand touched the
side wall, was thrust away with terrific force. I knew then that I
was still falling, but not at an increasing rate, as I should have
if gravity alone were acting. Some intangible force was holding the
speed of my descent steady, so that, with nothing by which to
judge, I seemed to be at rest.</p>

<p>Precisely as if I were in a spaceship, zipping along at a
thousand miles a minute, with, nil acceleration. But this was in
the bowels of a world, not in the free leagues of space. Sooner or
later we'd hit something solid.</p>

<p>The blackness greyed slightly. I felt myself moving upward,
slowly. But so sudden a change of direction, at the speed I must
have attained, should have torn me to bits. It dawned on me that my
fall was merely slowing gradually. Queer! What could be causing
this gentle deceleration?</p>

<p>In a sort of drab dusk I could now see the glass-smooth, curved
walls blurring past. I twisted and saw Jay's queerly distorted form
below&mdash;no, above me. It must be above. I had fallen first, and
he had not passed me. Sensation was chaotic. As a space pilot I
should have been familiar with apparent changes of direction,
deceptively due to misinterpretation of changes in acceleration, in
rate of motion, by the monitors in our nervous system. But it was
so long since I had flown.</p>

<p>The light grew brighter. It was white light. White light!
Brighter and brighter it was, dazzling after the dark. Abruptly the
walls of the shaft were gone!</p>

<p>We had dropped through the roof of a tremendous cavern, its
boundaries miles away! Below, straight below us, five hundred feet
or more, a circular pool of what seemed white-hot, shining metal
blazed. I glimpsed forms moving about its edges, a road bordering
it, low-lying buildings. Beyond them fields, green fields. We were
falling straight for that white blaze!</p>

<p>A hurtling form shot sideward, from above me, blue gas spitting.
"Gurd. Your gas-tube! Your gas-tube, Gurd!"</p>

<p>Jay's howl shocked me back to thought, to action. I had clean
forgotten that this was a self-propelled space suit. My hand-fork
flashed to the control button. The death pool jerked away from
under me. I thudded hard to the cavern floor, beside the prone
figure of my brother. My head rang with the impact, my body felt a
mass of bruises, but I was alive!</p>

<p>Jay's helmet was split across the forehead! Was he dead from the
fall, or poisoned by unbreathable gases admitted through that
ominous tear in his head cover? I rolled to him, peered in through
his face-plate.</p>

<p>His eyelids flickered, opened. Color flowed back into his
cheeks, and he smiled, wryly.</p>

<p>"I'm all right, Gurd. Just got a rotten crack on the head."</p>

<p>I was nauseous with relief.</p>

<p>"I thought you were gone."</p>

<p>"Not yet. I was born to be gassed out." He sniffed. "I smell
flowers. What did you do, lay a wreath on me? A little previous,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Your helmet's cracked open."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, but this air is salubrious. Open up and get a whiff
of it."<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>I got to my knees, rigid with dismay. Across the level, grassy
meadow from the shining pool a horde of creatures were rushing
toward us, things out of some fantastic dream, gigantic in size, of
vivid, kaleidoscopic coloring.</p>

<p>As they came closer I saw that they were dome-shaped, more like
turtles than any other Earth creature. But there was no shell, no
tail, and their six unjointed legs were squarely beneath the
ungainly bodies. From the topmost point of the hemispherical
torsos, a full eight feet from the ground, sprang a series of long
tentacles, thin and writhing snakily. In front, fragile-seeming,
necks jutted, ending in comparatively tiny, globular heads, each
featureless save for one unwinking green eye and two drooping,
flapped ears.</p>

<p>Before I could move the turtle men closed around us in a
jostling, nightmare circle, leaving an open space about twenty feet
in diameter. They squashed into one another, seeming to merge in a
solid wall of obscene protoplasm, so that we were the center of a
serried circle of ball heads thrust out from a high barrier. From
that incredible ring came a high, squeaking chorus of whimpering
sound, oddly infantile.</p>

<p>I remained kneeling, gaping at that circled horror, could not
have moved had I so willed.</p>

<p>The whimpering squeals grew in volume, then, ceased altogether.
The ring parted, the crowding hosts behind gave way until there was
an open lane, stretching back to whence they had come. From the
direction of the pool, down that long passage, moving with vast
dignity, a little procession came slowly toward us.</p>

<p>In front was a turtle man, similar to those we had already seen,
save that his body was a steady blue and that in one of his
tentacles there was a bundle of what seemed like long grass which
he held aloft and waved slowly from side to side. Behind him, on
some sort of discoid platform whose bearers were screened from us
by the leader's bulk, lumped another of the creatures.</p>

<p>This one glowed purple, and even from a distance I could see
that his legs and tentacles were rudimentary, while the sphere of
his head was triple the size of the 'others'.</p>

<p>As they came on a wave accompanied them in the forest of
uplifted tentacles. They came down in evident obeisance, then
lifted again to resume their eternal weaving.</p>

<p>I rose and tried to assume what dignity of posture I could
muster. The blue turtle man came within the cleared circle of grass
land and moved to one side, turning as he did so. And I saw who it
was that bore the palanquin of his master.</p>

<p>Their once natty uniforms hanging in torn strips, their faces
smeared with dried blood and twisted in agony, their eyes great
pits of suffering, the two Earthmen were bent almost double beneath
the weight on their shoulders. Hal Sanders' face was seared by two
livid welts from ear to chin, and on Ralph Hollivant's chest, where
his tunic had been ripped away, another glowed angrily. I felt the
hot blood of rage surge into my face. My fists balled within their
gloved hand-forks.</p>

<p>The blue-hued major domo flicked out a tentacle that touched the
platform, and then the ground, in an obvious signal, The Earthmen
knelt, their necks cording with the effort, and struggled to put
the palanquin down evenly.</p>

<p>One side slipped from Sanders' shoulder, thumping against the
ground. The prime minister lashed a tentacle across the poor
fellow's cheek! Hal's shoulders jerked and I held my breath,
thinking he would spring at his tormentor. But, pitifully, his head
drooped and all he did was to rub the new mark of punishment with a
trembling, grimy hand.</p>

<p>I remembered Hal Sanders as a two-fisted, brawling chap,
impatient of discipline. To see him meekly accept the lash told
more eloquently than many words what he had gone through, what lay
in store for us.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>The enslaved men heaved painfully upright. They looked at us
with lack-luster eyes, not the least ripple in their dull faces
showing recognition of us, or wonder at our appearance.</p>

<p>"Hal! Ralph!" Jay cried. "What have these devils done to
you?"</p>

<p>Hollivant looked at his blue master, appeared to beg voicelessly
for permission to speak.</p>

<p>One of the turtle man's snakelike arms reached out to me, swept
shuddersomely over my metal suit, then to Ralph's puffed lips.</p>

<p>Hollivant's voice was almost unrecognizable as human speech. "He
wants you to get out of the space suits."</p>

<p>"Like hell we will," Jay blurted. "Let him try to take them
off."</p>

<p>"You had better. We tried to defy them, and look at us. They're
utter fiends."</p>

<p>Jay's gesture of negation was evidently understood by the weird
creature. His tentacle touched Hollivant's lips again, then waved
in an all-embracing movement.</p>

<p>"Evidently they don't want another scrap. We did some damage
before they got us down. I'm to explain the uselessness of defying
them."</p>

<p>"Never mind that," I broke in. "Tell us about this place. With
the benefit of what you have learned we may have a chance to get
you away."</p>

<p>"Impossible. If you have any weapons the best thing you can do
is kill yourselves and us." They were licked, there was no question
of that.</p>

<p>"Chin up, Ralph. Arch your back. That way out is always
available. Meantime we'll try to make a fight of it. What happened
to you?"</p>

<p>"We got down safely enough, landing somewhere on the slope of
the mountain through the center of which the entrance to this hell
shoots up. Hal took a chance on opening his faceplate, and when we
discovered that the air was breathable we decided to signal to
Captain Silton. We climbed the peak, keeping on our space
suits.</p>

<p>"Just as we reached the underside of the clouds, what I thought
was a snake whipped around me and coiled tight. I fought for a long
time, there in the red fog, against writhing, snakelike things I
could not see. The huge, soft, jellylike bulks gave no resistance
as I slashed, and slashed, and slashed in a delirium of struggle.
One of my hand-forks struck against rock and broke off, the other
was bent and useless. I grew weary, weary, and I could fight no
longer. The living ropes clamped tight around me, bound my arms, my
legs.</p>

<p>"I was dragged into pitch darkness, and then I was drifting
down, slowly down and down till I thought there was no end to
descent."</p>

<p>"Slowly? Our acceleration was tremendous at first."</p>

<p>The blue turtle man squealed protest at my interjection, and
waved a threatening tentacle. Hollivant winced.</p>

<p>"He's getting impatient. I'll have to cut it short."</p>

<p>"Get the salient facts over. I want to know especially how they
get up and down that shaft. I've got a hunch that the solution to
our problem lies there.'</p>

<p>"Okay. Here's the layout. The outside of this planet is
uninhabitable because there are no life-giving rays in the light
from its sun. But the pool in this cavern is a basin of highly
radioactive liquid that gives off light with all the necessary
vibrations at the violet end of the spectrum. As a result, animal
and vegetable life has prospered here, their evolution culminating
in these highly civilized creatures. Not only does the liquid give
off light, but it is also tremendously repellent. Since it is sunk
so deeply it acts only upward, more than cancelling the planet's
natural gravity."<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>"How do they manage to control that repulsion?"</p>

<p>"They have a compound, a transparent, glasslike sort of stuff,
that screens the pool effect. From the nearest building to the pond
they swing out leaves of this material, or retract them, so as to
moderate the repulsion; allowing it to act full force, or shutting
it off entirely. Ordinary gravity acts through this glass, so the
effect of covering the pool with it is to permit whatever is in the
shaft to fall, instead of rise as it would if the pool were
uncovered."</p>

<p>"I get it! By regulating the laminations they control the speed
of ascent or descent. That is why we fell so fast at first, then
had our speed gradually checked." Many things were clear to me now,
and already a desperate plan was forming in back of my head.</p>

<p>"They go up there to obtain a certain ore needed in some of
their scientific processes. One of their parties discovered and
captured Hal and myself. Others must have observed your
approach."</p>

<p>"We heard a scream of pain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was when I got this." He pointed to the scar on his chest.
"The hole is a great speaking tube, carries sound perfectly. I
heard what sounded like a space suit striking against rock, and
tried to call a warning. But I was caught at it." Memory of pain
was a dull flame in the lackluster eyes.</p>

<p>"You say they are civilized. The way they have acted to you
doesn't sound like it."</p>

<p>"They've outgrown all emotion, except one, loyalty and
veneration for their king. He is the be-all and end-all of their
economy. At a word from him the whole nation would kill
itself."</p>

<p>I had heard enough. "Listen, everybody," I said in a quiet tone,
and set out my scheme rapidly and succinctly, gesturing meanwhile
so as to indicate to the watching turtle man that although we
refused to remove our suits we should go with them peaceably.</p>

<p>At a gesture of command, Hal and Ralph bent to take up their
burden again, and Jay and I stepped forward to aid them.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>IV. &mdash; RELATIVITY
REVERSED</h2>

<p class="first">THE turtle king on his platform was unexpectedly
light, despite his great size, and the four-of us bore him easily,
as we followed his adjutant down the long passage that reopened
through the compact mass of his fellows. I chuckled grimly when I
saw that the path led straight to the edge of the pool.</p>

<p>"The palace," Hollivant whispered, "is on the other side. We
will pass the structure from which the screens are swung and then
swing around the pond."</p>

<p>Everything depended now on whether those screens were over the
pool or not. We slowly neared it, and the brilliant light grew
almost unbearable. It blazed through the major domo's body and made
of it a huge sapphire jewel. It struck pearly iridescence from the
walled bodies lining our course. There was an obscene beauty in the
play of color, but my attention was focussed on the great vault of
the cavern roof, and, directly over the deep-sunk shining pool, the
black hole that betokened the lower end of the shaft.</p>

<p>The procession leader reached the edge of the lake of light,
turned ponderously half left to skirt it. His bulk no longer
eclipsed my view. I saw the answer to the question that pounded at
my brain. Folded up against the wall of a building at our right I
saw the transparent screens, towering above the low structure's
roof. The pool was unobscured, was free to pour the full strength
of its repulsion up through the long vertical tunnel where lay our
only, way to release.</p>

<p>The blue turtle man was some ten feet ahead of us, the following
hosts a respectful twenty behind. It was now or never.</p>

<p>"Ready," I called, quietly, and shifted one arm so that it
curled up, over the palanquin edge, and gripped the upper surface.
The burden jolted, the least bit, and I knew the others had done
the same.</p>

<p>"Go!" my voice snapped, and I jumped straight for the center of
the pool, still clinging to the turtle king's support. It came with
me, as Jay and Ralph and Hal responded to my command. Straight out
over that blazing pond we leaped and suddenly we were falling!</p>

<p>Falling! But the pool was above us, and the cavern roof beneath!
The repulsion of that pond, taking the place of gravity, had
reversed directions for us, and while to the astounded turtle men
we were shooting upward to our own senses we were dropping as
rapidly.</p>

<p>Straight for the black aperture we went, and a squeal of rage
came from the palanquin. I looked up at a vast thicket of agitated
tentacles and saw a blue mound whirl and scuttle toward the
building against which the screens were folded. The prime minister,
rushing to cut off the pool's power and bring us back to
vengeance.</p>

<p>I jerked out my trinite gun, aimed carefully upward, past my
feet, at the huge plates that hung down from the ground. I winged
the trinite pellet with a prayer.</p>

<p>It struck, by the Pleiades! It struck squarely on the slowly
unhinging screens, and they shattered into a million fragments!</p>

<p>Even above the shattering crash of that destruction I heard a
vast high-pitched wail from the tossing multitudes above, and saw
them rush headlong into the pool, saw them hurtle downward after
us. Then we were in the obscurity of the shaft; falling, falling,
falling toward the surface of the red planet.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>"They'll blow up the shaft with their bombs," Sanders cried out.
"That'll cut off the pool power, and we'll be trapped here in
mid-earth."</p>

<p>"They won't do that as long as we have their king with us. I
thought they might use some such means of stopping us. That's why I
brought him along."</p>

<p>"Gurd!" Jay's voice. "We're accelerating rapidly. We'll crash at
the top. Now that you've destroyed the screens there's nothing to
stop us except the roof of the entrance cave."</p>

<p>"We'll slow up with our gas-tubes."</p>

<p>"Yeah? And give the turtle men a chance to catch up with
us?"</p>

<p>"Pluto! I didn't think of that! Well, it'll be a clean death,
anyway." I was licked.</p>

<p>But not Jay. "Try shooting at it," he yelled. "Maybe we can blow
off the top of the peak.</p>

<p>"Good boy! Shoot!" We emptied our guns past the discoid resting
place of the turtle king. Then we waited with bated breath, as we
continued the headlong rise that, to us, seemed a fall. We knew the
pellets we had loosed were speeding ahead of us, that they would
surely strike the overhanging rock that threatened us. We knew the
tremendous atomic power compact in each of the eighth-inch
globules. Would it be sufficient to blast away the black peak?</p>

<p>Thunder rolled back upon us, deafening. We were thrown violently
from side to side of the shaft as the disturbed air soughed past
us, and I heard a squeal of pain from the turtle king. I tried to
see past the platform edge, for some gleam of light that would tell
me our attempt was successful. But the darkness was complete.</p>

<p>"No go, fellows. We're in for it."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Gurd. It was a grand fight while it lasted."</p>

<p>I reached out, groping, and my hand-fork met Jay's, gripped it
hard.</p>

<p>Suddenly I was flung against the underside of the palanquin! I
heard a squashing thud, a high-pitched scream, gurgling horribly
into silence. I was one of a writhing mass of human arms, legs,
bodies, and was joining my voice to a chorus of shouted, husky
curses and objurgations. Something was around my neck, holding my
head as in a vise. A heel beat a tattoo on the metal of my space
suit.</p>

<p>"Hey, let up! Get your toe out of my eye!" That was Jay. I shook
my head to clear it of the dizzy whirl that scrambled my brains,
realized that we were no longer falling, that we were piled atop
the bottom of the platform that had preceded us in all that long
descent, that we were miraculously alive!</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what's happened?" someone gasped.</p>

<p>"That's easy!" I had figured it out. "The back-flash of the
explosion of our trinite pellets against the roof slowed us up a
darn sight more than we realized. And the eight-foot mass of jelly
the other side of this sedan-chair did the rest. That turtle king
made a swell bumper."</p>

<p>"Whew! Let's get out of here. That mob will be on us in a
second."</p>

<p>"Gad! I'd forgotten them. How is it they haven't caught us
already?"

<p"The explosion slowed them up also. But they'll be here, too quick
for comfort."<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>I pushed to the side of the platform, reached around, and got a
grip on the under surface. I pushed out under the rocky floor of
the tunnel. Instantly directions were reversed. I hung now, from
the disc that had just been under me. What was down was now up, up,
now down. I knew then that miles of solid ground was between me and
the repulsion of the pool, that I was definitely out of the shaft.
I let go, dropped, sprawled on solid, grateful rock.</p>

<p>Jay landed beside me.</p>

<p>"Next time I come here," he grunted, "I'm going to paste a label
on me, 'This side up, with care.' Am I on my head or my tail
now?"</p>

<p>"Hustle," I yelled, and took it on the run. The others were
close behind.</p>

<p>Our stratocar still perched, birdlike on the outer ledge. We
piled inside. The motor took hold sweetly, and the stratocar zipped
out of reach.</p>

<p>The <i>Phobos'</i> power was triple that of the <i>Luna</i>. She
lifted easily through the crimson clouds.</p>

<p>"Where now?" Hal Sanders queried. "How are we going to get
back?"</p>

<p>"The same way Jay did, through the ether eddy?'</p>

<p>"I suppose you've got a chart of the route," Jay scoffed. "Just
issued by the Interuniverse Flying Board."</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"Quit your spoofing."</p>

<p>"I'm not. The blind luck that attends children and drunks
brought the eddy in your path, when you were here before. I, being
somewhat more intelligent, know enough to look for it."</p>

<p>"I suppose it's all set for you?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," I responded drily. "There it is, straight ahead.
Look."</p>

<p>And so it was, shimmering discreetly, a vague intangible veil
across the black curtain of this other-space. But now it breathed
promise instead of fear. The <i>Phobos</i> plunged straight for its
heart.</p>
